Question:
There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that:

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Correct Answer:
The problem says 'some', so not all cells must be occupied. We start by doing casework on the column on the left. There can be 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 black chip. The same goes for white chips, so we will multiply by 2 at the end. There is $1$ way to select $5$ cells with black chips. Because of the 2nd condition, there can be no white, and the grid must be all black, yielding $1$ way. There are $5$ ways to select $4$ cells with black chips. We now consider the row that does not contain a black chip. The first cell must be blank, and the remaining $4$ cells have $2^4 - 1$ different ways ($-1$ comes from all blank). This gives us $75$ ways. Notice that for $3$, $2$, or $1$ black chips on the left, there is a pattern. Once the first blank row is chosen, the rest of the blank rows must be ordered similarly. For example, with $2$ black chips on the left, there will be $3$ blank rows. There are $15$ ways for the first row to be chosen, and the following $2$ rows must have the same order. Thus, the number of ways for $3$, $2$, and $1$ black chips is $10\times 15$, $10\times 15$, $5\times 15$. Adding these up, we have $1 + 75 + 150 + 150 + 75 = 451$. Multiplying this by $2$, we get $902$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand the requirements step by step.

First, there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they are indistinguishable. That means I can't tell them apart; I just need to count how many ways I can place some of them on the grid.

The grid has 25 cells, each of which can hold at most one chip. So, I can't have two chips in the same cell.

Next, the conditions say that all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column must have the same color. Hmm, that's interesting. So, for each row, if I place any chips, they must all be either white or black. Similarly, for each column, all chips in that column must be the same color.

Additionally, the placement must be "saturated," meaning that if I were to add another chip, it would violate one of the previous conditions. So, I can't add any more chips without breaking the rules.

Let me try to break this down. First, the grid has 5 rows and 5 columns. Each row must be entirely white or entirely black. Each column must be entirely white or entirely black. So, the color of each row and column is fixed once I choose whether each is white or black.

But since the chips are placed on the grid, the overlap of rows and columns must also be considered. If a row is white, then all the cells in that row must be white (if any are filled). Similarly, if a column is white, all cells in that column must be white. But wait, that can't be, because a cell is in both a row and a column. So, actually, if a row is white, then all the cells in that row must be white, but that doesn't necessarily mean the entire column is white. Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, the condition is that all chips in the same row have the same color, and all chips in the same column have the same color. So, if a row has any chips, they must be the same color, and that color could be different from the color of the column it's in. But then, if a cell is in a row of color A and a column of color B, then that cell must be both color A and color B. Which would require that A equals B. So, in other words, every row and every column must be monochromatic, but the row and column colors must agree in each cell.

Therefore, the coloring of the grid must be such that all the rows and all the columns are monochromatic, and the color of each row must be equal to the color of each column that intersects it at a cell with a chip.

Wait, so this seems similar to a grid where each row is assigned a color (white or black) and each column is assigned a color (white or black), but such that if a row is colored white, then all columns that intersect it (i.e., all columns that have any chip in that row) must also be white. Similarly, if a column is colored white, then all rows that intersect it (i.e., all rows that have any chip in that column) must also be white.

But actually, since each cell must be both the color of its row and the color of its column, the color of the row and the color of the column must match for every cell that's occupied. So, if I have a cell at (i,j) that's occupied, then the color of row i must equal the color of column j.

Therefore, this essentially imposes that the set of rows and columns that are white must form a rectangle, i.e., if some rows are white, then all columns that have any white chips in those rows must themselves be white, and similarly, if some columns are white, all rows that have any white chips in those columns must be white.

Wait, actually, maybe the entire grid must be either all white or all black, but that can't be because we can have some chips. No, wait, no. Let me think differently.

Suppose that all the white rows and white columns must form a rectangle. Similarly, all black rows and black columns must form another rectangle, and these two rectangles must be disjoint, i.e., they don't overlap in any cell. Because if they overlapped, that cell would have to be both white and black, which is impossible.

So, in other words, the grid is divided into four regions:

1. White rows and white columns: this is a rectangle where the intersection is white.

2. White rows and black columns: this is a rectangle where the intersection is white in the rows but black in the columns, but wait, that can't be because each cell must be both the color of its row and the color of its column. So, if a row is white, then all cells in that row must be white, regardless of the column color. Similarly, if a column is white, all cells in that column must be white, regardless of the row color.

Wait, perhaps the only way this can happen is if all the white rows are paired with white columns, and the black rows are paired with black columns, but in such a way that the white regions form a rectangle and the black regions form another rectangle.

Wait, maybe it's similar to a chessboard pattern, but more constrained.

Wait, think of the grid as being partitioned into four blocks:

- Top-left: white rows and white columns.

- Top-right: white rows and black columns.

- Bottom-left: black rows and white columns.

- Bottom-right: black rows and black columns.

But in this case, the cells in the top-right block would have to be both white (because the rows are white) and black (because the columns are black), which is a contradiction. Similarly, the cells in the bottom-left block would have to be both black (rows) and white (columns), which is also a contradiction.

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if either:

1. The white rows are exactly the same as the white columns, forming a square or rectangle in the grid.

2. The black rows are exactly the same as the black columns.

Wait, that might not be precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the set of white rows must be a subset of the white columns, and the set of black rows must be a subset of the black columns, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think in terms of the color assignments. Each row is assigned a color, either white or black. Each column is assigned a color, either white or black. For the placement to satisfy the condition, every cell (i,j) that has a chip must have row i color equal to column j color.

Therefore, the set of cells with chips must be such that if a cell is colored, the row and column colors agree.

So, the cells with chips must lie in the intersection of white rows and white columns, or in the intersection of black rows and black columns.

Therefore, the set of cells with chips must be entirely contained within either:

- The intersection of some white rows and some white columns.

OR

- The intersection of some black rows and some black columns.

Furthermore, these two regions must not overlap. Because if a cell is in both a white row and a black column, it would have to be both white and black, which is impossible.

Therefore, the chips must lie entirely within either a white rectangle or a black rectangle, but not both.

Moreover, the placement must be saturated, meaning that adding any other chip would violate the conditions. So, the white rectangle or black rectangle must be such that any additional cell outside of it cannot have a chip without violating the color condition.

Therefore, the white rectangle must be as large as possible in terms of the rows and columns assigned to white, and similarly for the black rectangle.

Wait, but if we have both white and black regions, then adding a chip in the black region would only be allowed if we adjust the colors of the rows or columns accordingly.

But since the placement is saturated, meaning no more chips can be added without violating the conditions, that suggests that the white and black regions are maximal in some sense.

Wait, perhaps the entire grid is colored either white or black, but that can't be because we can have some chips. Wait, no, if the entire grid is white, you could add more chips, but since it's saturated, it must be that every possible cell is filled with the same color, but that contradicts the idea of having some white and some black.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the grid can have multiple regions, but any additional chip must cause a conflict either in its row or column.

So, if I have a white rectangle in the grid, such that every cell in that rectangle is white, and all other cells are black, then adding any chip outside the white rectangle would require that cell to be white, but it's already black, so that's a conflict. Similarly, adding a chip inside the white rectangle would require that cell to be black, but it's already white, so that's a conflict.

Wait, no. Wait, if I have a white rectangle, then all cells in that rectangle are white, and all others are black. So, if I try to add a chip in a black cell, that black cell is in a row and column that are black. So, adding a white chip would violate the condition that all chips in that row or column must be the same color. Therefore, you can't add any chips to black cells because they are already black, and you can't add white chips to white cells because they're already white.

Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me think again.

Suppose I have a white rectangle in the grid. Then, all the cells in that rectangle are white, and all the cells outside are black. Now, if I try to add another white chip in a black cell, that cell is in a row and column that are black, so adding a white chip would make that row and column have both black and white chips, which violates the conditions. Similarly, adding a black chip in a white cell would also violate the conditions because that cell is in a row and column that are white, so you can't have a black chip there.

Therefore, the grid must already be entirely white or entirely black if you have a single rectangle.

But wait, that can't be, because the problem says "some of these chips," meaning we don't have to fill the entire grid.

Wait, perhaps the grid is divided into two rectangles, one white and one black, such that the white rectangle is in one corner and the black rectangle is in another corner, but the rest of the cells are empty. But then, adding chips to the empty cells would have to be either white or black, but then you have to make sure that the rows and columns are monochromatic.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try a different approach.

Since each row must be all white or all black, and each column must be all white or all black, the entire grid must be a union of two rectangles: one all white and one all black, but these two rectangles cannot overlap in any cell because overlapping would require that cell to be both white and black, which is impossible.

Therefore, the grid is divided into two rectangles, one white and one black, and the rest of the grid is empty. But the key is that you cannot have both a white and a black cell in the same row or column unless all the cells in that row or column are empty.

Wait, no. If a row is white, then all cells in that row must be white. If a column is white, all cells in that column must be white. Similarly for black.

Therefore, if you have a white rectangle, say, in the top-left corner, then all the rows and columns that intersect this rectangle are white. Similarly, the black rectangle must be in the bottom-right corner, and all the rows and columns that intersect this rectangle are black.

But in this case, the white rectangle and the black rectangle can't overlap, so the white rectangle must be entirely above and to the left of the black rectangle.

Therefore, the grid is divided into four regions:

1. Top-left: white rectangle (rows 1 to a, columns 1 to b)

2. Top-right: empty (rows 1 to a, columns b+1 to 5)

3. Bottom-left: empty (rows a+1 to 5, columns 1 to b)

4. Bottom-right: black rectangle (rows a+1 to 5, columns b+1 to 5)

Moreover, the rows 1 to a are white, and the columns 1 to b are white. The rows a+1 to 5 are black, and the columns b+1 to 5 are black.

Additionally, the white rectangle must be such that any white cell is in a white row and a white column, and any black cell is in a black row and a black column.

Therefore, the grid is divided into four blocks:

- White: rows 1 to a, columns 1 to b

- Black: rows a+1 to 5, columns b+1 to 5

- The rest are empty.

Now, since the placement must be saturated, meaning we cannot add any more chips without violating the conditions, then every possible cell outside of the white and black rectangles must be empty. Because if we try to place a chip in any of those empty cells, we would have to make sure that the entire row or column it's in is monochromatic.

But if we place a white chip in a cell in rows a+1 to 5, it would require that entire row to be white, which is impossible because those rows are black. Similarly, placing a black chip in a cell in rows 1 to a would require the entire row to be black, which is impossible because those rows are white. The same applies to columns.

Therefore, the only way the placement is saturated is if all the white rows and white columns are exactly the regions we've defined, and the black rows and black columns are exactly the regions as well, with the rest empty.

Therefore, the number of such placements is determined by the number of ways to choose the white rectangle and black rectangle such that they don't overlap.

But wait, actually, the white rectangle is determined by the number of white rows and white columns, and the black rectangle is determined by the number of black rows and black columns.

So, to count the number of such placements, I can consider the number of ways to choose a white rectangle (a x b) in the 5x5 grid, where a is the number of white rows (from 1 to 5) and b is the number of white columns (from 1 to 5). Then, the remaining rows (5 - a) must be black, and the remaining columns (5 - b) must be black. The intersection of these black rows and black columns forms the black rectangle (5 - a) x (5 - b).

But wait, each such choice of a and b defines a unique white rectangle and a unique black rectangle, and the rest of the grid is empty. Therefore, each choice of a and b corresponds to exactly one such placement.

However, we have to ensure that the white rectangle and black rectangle do not overlap, which is automatically satisfied because a and b are the number of white rows and columns, so the black rows are the remaining (5 - a) rows, and the black columns are the remaining (5 - b) columns.

Therefore, the number of such placements is equal to the number of possible pairs (a, b), where a and b can range from 0 to 5, inclusive. But we have to subtract the cases where a=0 and b=0 because that would mean the entire grid is black, but we are allowed to place some chips. Wait, actually, the problem says "some of these chips," so we need to exclude the case where no chips are placed.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells..." So, "some" means at least one chip. So, we have to include all placements with at least one chip.

But in our previous reasoning, each pair (a, b) where a and b are from 0 to 5 defines a placement. However, the case where a=0 and b=0 corresponds to all cells being black, which is allowed, but we also need to consider placements where some cells are white and some are black.

Wait, actually, if a=0 and b=0, then all rows are black and all columns are black, so all cells are black. Similarly, if a=5 and b=5, all cells are white. So, these are two specific cases.

But in our problem, we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but we are only placing some of them, right? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: "There is a collection of 25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells..." So, we can place any number of chips from 0 to 25, but with the constraints.

But in our previous reasoning, each (a, b) corresponds to a unique placement where the white rectangle is a x b and the black rectangle is (5 - a) x (5 - b). But in this case, the number of chips is a*b + (5 - a)*(5 - b). So, for each (a, b), the number of chips is a*b + (5 - a)*(5 - b). So, different (a, b) pairs can result in the same number of chips.

But our problem is not about counting the number of chips, but rather the number of placements. So, regardless of how many chips are placed, each (a, b) defines a unique placement, except for the fact that a and b can range from 0 to 5, but we need to ensure that the placement is saturated.

Wait, but in our earlier reasoning, the number of such placements is equal to the number of possible (a, b) pairs, where a is the number of white rows and b is the number of white columns. Since a can be from 0 to 5 and b can be from 0 to 5, there are 6*6=36 possible pairs. However, each pair defines a unique placement.

But wait, some of these pairs would result in the same placement. For example, a=1, b=1 is different from a=1, b=2, etc. So, actually, each (a, b) pair corresponds to a unique placement.

But hold on, a=0, b=0: all cells are black.

a=0, b=1: first column is white, rest black.

a=0, b=2: first two columns white, rest black.

Similarly, a=0, b=5: all columns white, which is a=0, b=5, but wait, if a=0, all rows are black, so even if b=5, all columns are white, but all rows are black, so the white rectangle is 0x5, which is empty. Similarly, the black rectangle is 5x0, which is also empty. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, if a=0, then all rows are black, meaning that all cells in black rows are black, but if b=5, then all columns are white, meaning that all cells in white columns are white. So, the intersection of a=0 and b=5 is that all columns are white, but all rows are black. But that would require that the entire grid is white, but the rows are black. Contradiction.

Therefore, actually, a and b cannot be independently chosen. Because if all columns are white, then all rows must be white as well, because each column is white, so every cell in that column must be white, meaning every cell in every row that intersects that column must be white. But if all columns are white, then all rows must be white, so a cannot be 0 if b=5.

Similarly, if all rows are white, then all columns must be white, so b cannot be 0 if a=5.

Therefore, the pairs (a, b) must satisfy that if a=0, then b=0, and if b=0, then a=0. Similarly, if a=5, then b=5, and if b=5, then a=5.

Wait, that seems too restrictive. Let me think again.

Suppose a=0, which means all rows are black. Then, if b=1, meaning the first column is white, but since all rows are black, the first column must be entirely black. Therefore, b cannot be 1 if a=0.

Similarly, if a=0, then b must also be 0, because all columns are black as well.

Similarly, if b=0, then all columns are black, so a must be 0.

Similarly, if a=5, all rows are white, so b must be 5.

So, actually, the possible (a, b) pairs are those where a and b are either both 0 or both between 1 and 5, but with the constraint that a=5 requires b=5, and b=5 requires a=5.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. If a=5, all rows are white, which would require that all columns are white as well because each row is white, so all cells in each row must be white, but that doesn't necessarily fix the columns. Wait, no, each column is independent.

Wait, let me clarify again.

Each row is assigned a color: white or black.

Each column is assigned a color: white or black.

However, for a cell (i,j), if it has a chip, its row color must equal its column color.

So, if all rows are white, then all cells in the grid must be white. Because every cell is in a white row and a white column, so they must all be white.

Similarly, if all columns are white, then all cells must be white.

Therefore, the only possible (a, b) pairs where a=5 or b=5 are the cases where all cells are white.

Similarly, if a=0 or b=0, all cells are black.

Therefore, the possible (a, b) pairs are:

- (0, 0): all black

- (5, 5): all white

- (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤4 and 1 ≤ b ≤4: white rectangle of size a x b, black rectangle of size (5 - a) x (5 - b)

Wait, but in this case, if a=1 and b=1, you have a white cell at (1,1) and the rest of the grid is black, but actually, the white rectangle is 1x1, and the black rectangle is 4x4. So, that's a valid placement.

Similarly, a=2, b=3: white rectangle 2x3, black rectangle 3x2.

But wait, a=2, b=3 would mean that rows 1 and 2 are white, columns 1,2,3 are white, and the rest are black. So, the white rectangle is 2x3, and the black rectangle is 3x2.

Wait, but then the intersection of the black rows (3,4,5) and black columns (4,5) is 3x2, which is fine.

So, each (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤4 and 1 ≤ b ≤4 corresponds to a unique placement.

Additionally, we have the case where all cells are white (a=5, b=5) and all cells are black (a=0, b=0). So, in total, we have:

- 1 case for all white

- 1 case for all black

- For a from 1 to 4 and b from 1 to 4, each pair (a, b) corresponds to a unique placement.

So, how many such pairs are there? For a=1 to 4 and b=1 to 4, that's 4x4=16.

So, total placements would be 16 + 1 + 1 = 18.

But wait, the problem says "some of these chips," so we have to exclude the case where no chips are placed. But in our current count, (a=0, b=0) corresponds to all cells black, but in our problem, we can also have some white and some black cells. Wait, no, in the (a=0, b=0) case, all cells are black, so there are no white cells. Similarly, in the (a=5, b=5) case, all cells are white. So, these are two placements where all chips are of one color.

But the problem says "some of these chips," meaning that we can have any number of chips from 1 to 25. So, the case where all cells are black (0 white chips) and all cells are white (0 black chips) are allowed since "some" can include all of one color.

But wait, actually, if all cells are white, that's 25 white chips, which is allowed. Similarly, all cells black is 25 black chips, which is allowed.

So, in our count, we have:

- 16 placements where both a and b are between 1 and 4.

- 1 placement where a=5, b=5 (all white).

- 1 placement where a=0, b=0 (all black).

So, total placements: 18.

But wait, is that the case? Let me verify.

For a from 1 to 4 and b from 1 to 4, each pair (a, b) defines a unique placement with a white rectangle a x b and a black rectangle (5 - a) x (5 - b). So, 16 such placements.

Plus the two monochromatic placements: all white and all black. So, 16 + 2 = 18.

But wait, is that the correct count?

Alternatively, maybe the number is 25, because for each cell, you can decide to make it white or black, but that would be overcounting because of the constraints.

Wait, but the constraints are that in each row and each column, all chips must be the same color, and the placement must be saturated. So, the only valid configurations are those where the grid is divided into two rectangles: one white and one black, with no overlapping, and the rest empty.

Therefore, the number of such configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a white rectangle and a black rectangle that don't overlap.

Which is equivalent to choosing a white rectangle of size a x b (where a and b range from 0 to 5) and a black rectangle of size (5 - a) x (5 - b). However, as we saw earlier, when a=0, b must also be 0, and when a=5, b must also be 5.

Thus, the number of configurations is:

- 1 for all white.

- 1 for all black.

- For a=1 to 4, b=1 to 4: 4x4=16.

Total: 18.

Therefore, the number of ways is 18.

Wait, but let me make sure. Is there another way to interpret the problem?

The problem says: "Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5×5 grid such that each cell contains at most one chip, all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour, and any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions."

So, the key here is that the placement must be such that it's saturated; you can't add any more chips without violating the condition.

Therefore, the only way to have a saturated placement is if every cell that can potentially be added is either:

- For a white cell, all the rows and columns that intersect it are white.

- For a black cell, all the rows and columns that intersect it are black.

Therefore, the only possible configurations are those where all the white cells form a rectangle (a x b), and all the black cells form another rectangle ((5 - a) x (5 - b)), with these two rectangles not overlapping.

Thus, the number of such configurations is as we calculated: 18.

But wait, let me consider another angle. Each such configuration is determined by the choice of the white rectangle. The black rectangle is then fixed once the white rectangle is chosen.

So, the number of white rectangles is (number of ways to choose rows) x (number of ways to choose columns). The number of ways to choose rows is 6 (from 0 to 5), and the number of ways to choose columns is 6. However, as we saw earlier, only certain combinations are allowed.

Wait, no. Actually, each white rectangle is determined by choosing a certain number of rows and a certain number of columns, but the rows and columns must be contiguous.

Wait, no, actually, in this problem, the white rectangle doesn't have to be contiguous. Wait, hold on.

Wait, actually, no. Because the white rows are a set of rows, and the white columns are a set of columns. So, the white rectangle is the intersection of these white rows and white columns. So, it's a rectangle in the grid, but not necessarily contiguous.

Wait, but in a 5x5 grid, if I choose, say, rows 1 and 3 to be white, and columns 2 and 4 to be white, then the white cells are (1,2), (1,4), (3,2), (3,4). So, it's not a solid rectangle, but rather a set of cells that form a rectangle in the grid.

But in this case, the white cells form a rectangle only if the chosen rows and columns are contiguous.

Wait, no, actually, no. If you choose rows 1 and 3, and columns 2 and 4, the white cells are scattered, but they don't form a solid rectangle.

Wait, but in the problem, the condition is that all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color. So, if a row has chips, they must all be the same color. Similarly, if a column has chips, they must all be the same color.

Therefore, the white cells must form a union of entire rows and entire columns. So, the white cells must consist of some entire rows and some entire columns, but their intersection.

Wait, so actually, the white cells must form a grid where certain rows and certain columns are entirely white, but the intersection of these rows and columns is a rectangle.

Wait, for example, choosing rows 1, 2, 4 and columns 3,5, the white cells would be the union of rows 1,2,4 and columns 3,5. So, the white cells would be all cells in rows 1,2,4 and columns 3,5, but not necessarily forming a solid rectangle.

Wait, no, that's not correct. If you choose certain rows and certain columns to be white, then the white cells are all cells in those rows and all cells in those columns. So, the white cells form a grid where the union of the chosen rows and chosen columns are white.

But in such a case, the white cells would not necessarily form a rectangle unless the chosen rows and columns are contiguous.

Wait, so for example, if I choose rows 1, 3, 5 and columns 2,4, then the white cells are all cells in rows 1,3,5 and all cells in columns 2,4. So, the white cells are not forming a single rectangle but rather multiple rectangles.

But in that case, the white cells would form a union of rectangles, each from a chosen row or column.

But in this problem, the placement must be saturated, meaning that adding any more chips would violate the conditions. Therefore, if you have white cells spread out across multiple rows and columns, you could potentially add more chips in those rows and columns as long as they are consistent.

But if the white cells are already in multiple rows and columns, you can't add chips in those rows or columns without making them all white. But since they are already white, adding more chips is allowed, but since they are already white, you can add chips to those rows and columns without violating the condition.

Wait, but in our problem, the placement must be saturated, which means that you cannot add any more chips without violating the conditions. So, if you have white cells in multiple rows and columns, you could potentially add more chips in those rows or columns, but since you can't add more without violating the condition, it must mean that all the rows and columns that have any white chips are already completely white.

Wait, that is, if a row has any white chips, then all cells in that row must be white. Similarly, if a column has any white chips, all cells in that column must be white.

Therefore, the white cells must form a rectangle, where all the chosen rows and all the chosen columns are entirely white. So, the white cells must form a solid rectangle in the grid.

Similarly, the black cells must form another solid rectangle in the remaining part of the grid.

Therefore, the only possible configurations are those where the white cells form a solid rectangle a x b, and the black cells form a solid rectangle (5 - a) x (5 - b), where a and b can range from 0 to 5.

But as before, when a=0 or b=0, all cells must be black, and when a=5 or b=5, all cells must be white.

Therefore, the number of such configurations is:

- 1 for all white.

- 1 for all black.

- For a=1 to 4 and b=1 to 4: 4x4=16.

So, 16 + 2 = 18.

Therefore, the number of ways is 18.

Wait, but let me confirm by thinking about smaller grids.

Suppose we have a 1x1 grid. Then, the number of ways would be 2: all white or all black.

For a 2x2 grid, let's see:

- All white: 1

- All black: 1

- White 1x1 in the top-left, black 1x1 in the bottom-right: 1

- White 1x1 in the top-right, black 1x1 in the bottom-left: 1

- White 2x1 in the top, black 1x2 in the bottom: 1

- White 1x2 in the left, black 2x1 in the right: 1

- White 2x2:1

- Black 2x2:1

Wait, but no, in a 2x2 grid, the white rectangle can be 1x1, 1x2, 2x1, or 2x2, and similarly for the black rectangle.

But actually, in a 2x2 grid, the number of such placements would be:

- All white:1

- All black:1

- White 1x1, black 1x1: 4 possibilities (since the white cell can be in any of the four positions, but the black cell must be in the opposite corner). Wait, no, actually, the white rectangle and black rectangle can't overlap, so in a 2x2 grid, you can have:

- White 1x1 and black 1x1: there are 2 possibilities: the white cell is in one corner, and the black cell is in the opposite corner, but mirrored.

Wait, maybe it's 2: top-left white, bottom-right black; or top-right white, bottom-left black.

Similarly, for white 1x2 and black 1x2: 2 possibilities: top white, bottom black; or bottom white, top black.

Similarly for white 2x1 and black 2x1: 2 possibilities.

And then all white and all black.

So, total of 1 (all white) + 1 (all black) + 2 (1x1 opposite corners) + 2 (1x2 opposite) + 2 (2x1 opposite) = 8.

But according to our formula, for a 2x2 grid, the number of placements would be:

- a=0, b=0:1

- a=5, b=5:1

Wait, no, in our formula, for 2x2 grid, a and b go from 0 to 2.

So, the number of placements would be:

1 (all white) + 1 (all black) + (2-1)*(2-1)=1, but in reality, for 2x2, we have 8. Therefore, our formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that for a=1 to n-1 and b=1 to n-1, the number of placements is (n-1)^2. But in the 2x2 case, that would give 1, but in reality, there are more.

Therefore, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, in the 2x2 grid, the number of possible white rectangles is:

- 1x1: 4

- 1x2: 2

- 2x1: 2

- 2x2:1

Similarly, for black rectangles.

But considering that the white and black rectangles can't overlap, the number of possible placements is:

- All white:1

- All black:1

- White 1x1 and black 1x1: 2 (diagonal)

- White 1x2 and black 1x2: 2 (top and bottom)

- White 2x1 and black 2x1: 2 (left and right)

So, total: 1 +1 +2 +2 +2=8.

Therefore, in the 2x2 case, the number of placements is 8.

Similarly, in the 1x1 case, it's 2.

In the 3x3 case, how many would it be?

But maybe instead of trying smaller grids, I should think differently.

Wait, in the original problem, the grid is 5x5.

Each such placement is determined by choosing a white rectangle (a x b) where a is the number of white rows and b is the number of white columns, and the black rectangle is (5 - a) x (5 - b).

But in the 2x2 case, when a=1 and b=1, you can have the white rectangle in any of the four cells, but in reality, it's constrained because the white rectangle must be a solid rectangle.

Wait, hold on, in the 2x2 grid, a white rectangle of size 1x1 can be placed in any of the four cells, but actually, the white rectangle is the intersection of the chosen rows and columns. So, in a 2x2 grid, if you choose row 1 and column 1, the white rectangle is cell (1,1). If you choose row 1 and column 2, the white rectangle is cell (1,2). Similarly, choosing row 2 and column 1 is cell (2,1), and row 2 and column 2 is cell (2,2). So, in this case, each choice of a=1 and b=1 corresponds to a unique white rectangle, but in the 5x5 case, the white rectangle is not just a single cell but a rectangle.

So, in the 5x5 grid, if a=1 and b=1, the white rectangle is 1x1, so there are 5x5=25 choices for where the white rectangle is. But wait, no, because the white rectangle is determined by the intersection of a single row and a single column, so it's just a single cell.

Wait, hold on, no. If a=1, then only one row is white, and if b=1, only one column is white. Therefore, the white rectangle is the intersection of that row and column, which is a single cell.

Therefore, for a=1 and b=1, there are 5x5=25 possible placements, each corresponding to a single white cell.

Similarly, for a=1 and b=2, the white rectangle is 1x2, which is two cells in a row. The number of such placements is 5 rows x C(5,2)=10 columns, so 5x10=50.

Wait, but wait, no. If a=1, it's a single row, and b=2, it's two columns. So, the white rectangle is the intersection of that row and those two columns, which is two cells in that row. The number of such placements is 5 rows x C(5,2)=10 columns, so 5x10=50.

Similarly, for a=2 and b=1: two rows and one column, so two cells in each of the two rows, but since it's a rectangle, it's two rows x one column. So, the number of such placements is C(5,2)=10 rows x 5 columns=50.

For a=2 and b=2: two rows and two columns, forming a 2x2 white rectangle. The number of such placements is C(5,2)=10 rows x C(5,2)=10 columns=100.

Similarly, for a=1 and b=3: 5xC(5,3)=10=5x10=50.

Wait, but in this case, the white rectangle is 1x3, which is three cells in a single row. So, for each row, the number of ways to choose 3 columns is C(5,3)=10, so 5x10=50.

Similarly, a=1, b=4: 5x5=25.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the total number of placements is the sum over all a and b of the number of ways to choose a white rectangle of size a x b.

In a 5x5 grid, the number of white rectangles of size a x b is (6 - a)(6 - b). Because for each a, you can choose a starting row, and for each b, you can choose a starting column. So, the number is (6 - a)(6 - b).

Therefore, the total number of placements would be the sum over a=0 to5 and b=0 to5 of (6 - a)(6 - b), but with the caveat that if a=0, then b=0, and if a=5, then b=5.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, for each a and b, the number of white rectangles is (6 - a)(6 - b). So, the total number would be the sum over a=0 to5 and b=0 to5 of (6 - a)(6 - b). But that's equal to [sum_{a=0}^5 (6 - a)]^2 = [21]^2 = 441.

But that can't be, because the total number of possible subsets is 2^25, which is way larger, but our problem is about specific subsets where all chips in the same row and column are the same color.

Wait, actually, in our problem, the subsets must form a white rectangle and a black rectangle, so the number is not that big.

Wait, no, in our problem, each such subset is defined by choosing a white rectangle (a x b) and a black rectangle ((5 - a) x (5 - b)). The number of such subsets is equal to the number of possible white rectangles, because the black rectangle is uniquely determined once the white rectangle is chosen.

But the number of white rectangles is (number of ways to choose a x b). For each a from 0 to5, and for each b from 0 to5, the number is (6 - a)(6 - b). So, the total number is sum_{a=0}^5 sum_{b=0}^5 (6 - a)(6 - b).

But that sum is equal to [sum_{a=0}^5 (6 - a)]^2 = [21]^2 = 441.

But that's the total number of possible white rectangles, including the all-white and all-black cases.

But in our problem, each such white rectangle defines a unique placement, but we have to subtract the cases where adding more chips would violate the conditions. Wait, no, actually, in our problem, each placement is defined by a white rectangle, and the black rectangle is the complement. So, the number of placements is exactly the number of white rectangles, which is 441.

But that contradicts our earlier reasoning where we considered only non-overlapping rectangles. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.

Wait, but in the 2x2 grid, the number of white rectangles is 9: 4 single cells, 2 horizontal dominoes, 2 vertical dominoes, and 1 2x2 square. So, 4 + 2 + 2 +1=9, which is equal to (3)^2=9.

Similarly, in the 5x5 grid, the number of white rectangles would be (6)^2=36. Wait, no, in 2x2 grid, it's 3x3=9, so in 5x5 grid, it's 6x6=36.

Wait, but in the 2x2 grid, according to our earlier count, we had 8 placements, but according to white rectangles, it's 9. So, that seems conflicting.

Wait, actually, in the 2x2 grid, the number of white rectangles is 9, but the number of valid placements is 8, because all-white and all-black are included in the white rectangle count, but when you have a=2, b=2, it's all white, which is 1, and a=0, b=0 is all black, which is 1, so 9 total white rectangles, but only 8 non-empty placements.

Wait, no, in our problem, the number of placements is the number of white rectangles, which includes all-white and all-black, so it's 9 in 2x2, but in our earlier reasoning, we had 8.

Wait, maybe not. Wait, in our problem, the number of placements is the number of white rectangles, which includes all possible white configurations, regardless of whether they are empty or not. But actually, in the problem statement, we're supposed to place some chips, so at least one chip.

Therefore, in the 2x2 grid, the number of placements would be 9 (all white rectangles) minus 1 (all black) minus 1 (all white) =7? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps my entire approach is incorrect.

Wait, let me try to think differently.

Each placement corresponds to choosing a subset of cells such that:

- All cells in each chosen row are white.

- All cells in each chosen column are white.

Similarly for black.

So, the white cells must form a rectangle (union of entire rows and entire columns), and the black cells must form another rectangle.

But in this case, the white cells can be any union of entire rows and entire columns, but they must form a single rectangle.

Wait, no, the white cells can be multiple rows and multiple columns, but their intersection must be a solid rectangle.

Wait, actually, no, the white cells can be any union of entire rows and entire columns, but the problem is that adding any more chips must either violate the row or column condition or make the placement non-saturated.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 6^2=36, but that seems too low.

Wait, in the 2x2 grid, the number of placements was 8, which is (2+1)^2=9 minus 1=8.

Similarly, in the 5x5 grid, it's (5+1)^2=36 minus 1=35? But in our previous count, it's 18.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, in the 2x2 grid, the number of valid placements is 8, which is 2^(2+1) - 2=8.

Similarly, for 5x5, it's 2^(5+1) - 2=62.

But that seems arbitrary.

Wait, perhaps the number of such placements is equal to the number of ways to choose a white rectangle, which is (number of ways to choose rows) x (number of ways to choose columns). For each a from 0 to5, the number of ways to choose a rows is C(5, a). Similarly, for columns. So, the number of white rectangles is sum_{a=0}^5 sum_{b=0}^5 C(5, a) C(5, b).

But that is (sum_{a=0}^5 C(5, a))^2=2^5 x 2^5=1024. But that's too large.

Wait, no, in our problem, the white rectangle is determined by choosing entire rows and entire columns. So, it's not about choosing subsets of rows and columns, but choosing entire rows and entire columns.

Therefore, the number of white rectangles is (number of subsets of rows) x (number of subsets of columns), but with the constraint that the rows and columns chosen are contiguous.

Wait, no, the rows and columns don't have to be contiguous. So, for example, in a 2x2 grid, choosing row 1 and column 2 would result in a white cell at (1,2).

Therefore, the number of white rectangles is (number of ways to choose any subset of rows) x (number of ways to choose any subset of columns). But in our problem, it's not any subset, but only those subsets where all the cells in the selected rows and columns are white.

Therefore, the number of white rectangles is (2^5) x (2^5)=1024, but this includes all possible subsets, which is not the case because the white cells must form a rectangle.

Wait, no, in our problem, the white cells must form a rectangle, which is the intersection of selected rows and selected columns. So, each white rectangle is uniquely determined by choosing a subset of rows and a subset of columns, such that if a row is chosen, all its cells are white, and if a column is chosen, all its cells are white.

Therefore, the number of white rectangles is (number of ways to choose any subset of rows) x (number of ways to choose any subset of columns). But in our problem, the white cells must form a rectangle, which is exactly the intersection of the chosen rows and columns. So, the number of white rectangles is 2^5 x 2^5=1024.

But in our problem, the placement is determined by such a white rectangle, so the number of placements is 1024.

But this can't be, because in our earlier 2x2 grid, the number was 9, but we had to subtract the all-black and all-white cases if we needed non-empty placements.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, in the problem statement, we're to place some chips, so at least one, and the placement must be saturated. So, the number of such placements is equal to the number of non-empty white rectangles, where a white rectangle is defined as the intersection of any subset of rows and any subset of columns.

Thus, the number of non-empty white rectangles is (2^5 -1) x (2^5 -1)=31x31=961.

But that seems too high.

Wait, no, because each white rectangle is determined by a subset of rows and a subset of columns, but the white rectangle must consist of all cells in the chosen rows and all cells in the chosen columns. Therefore, the number of white rectangles is indeed (2^5)(2^5)=1024, but excluding the all-black and all-white cases, it's 1024 - 2=1022.

But in the 2x2 grid, this would give 16 - 2=14, but we know that the number of valid placements is 8.

Therefore, my reasoning is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps only solid rectangles are allowed, not just any intersection.

Wait, in the problem, the placement must be such that all cells in each row and column are the same color. Therefore, the white cells must form a solid rectangle where entire rows and entire columns are white.

Therefore, the white cells must be a union of entire rows and entire columns, but their intersection must form a rectangle.

Wait, that is, the white cells must be the union of some entire rows and some entire columns, but the rows and columns are not necessarily contiguous.

Wait, in that case, the white cells would form a cross shape, but not necessarily a rectangle.

Wait, for example, in a 5x5 grid, choosing rows 1 and 3 and columns 2 and 4, the white cells would be (1,2), (1,4), (3,2), (3,4), but this is four cells, not a rectangle.

Therefore, in order for the white cells to form a rectangle, the chosen rows and columns must be contiguous.

Therefore, the white rectangle must be a solid rectangle, i.e., a set of consecutive rows and consecutive columns.

Therefore, the number of white rectangles is (number of ways to choose a consecutive set of rows) x (number of ways to choose a consecutive set of columns).

The number of ways to choose a consecutive set of rows in a 5x5 grid is 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1=15.

Similarly, for columns, it's 15.

Therefore, the number of white rectangles is 15x15=225.

But, in our problem, the white rectangle can be any size, from 1x1 up to 5x5.

But in addition, the black rectangle is determined by the complement.

Wait, but in this case, the number of placements is 225, but that includes all possible white rectangles, including the all-white and all-black.

But in our problem, we need to place some chips, so at least one.

Therefore, the number of placements is 225 -1=224.

But in the 2x2 grid, this would give 9 -1=8, which matches our earlier count. So, that seems correct.

Therefore, in the 5x5 grid, the number of placements is 15x15 -1=224.

But wait, in the 2x2 grid, the number of white rectangles is 9, which includes all-white and all-black, so the number of non-empty placements is 9 -1=8. So, in the 5x5 grid, it's 15x15=225 white rectangles, so non-empty placements are 225 -1=224.

But wait, in the 5x5 grid, is the number of white rectangles 15x15=225?

Wait, actually, no. Because the number of consecutive row selections is 15, which is the sum from 1 to5: 5*(5+1)/2=15. Similarly for columns. So, the number of white rectangles is 15*15=225, which includes all possible solid rectangles.

Therefore, the number of non-empty placements is 225 -1=224.

But in our earlier reasoning, we thought it was 18, but that was under a different interpretation.

Wait, so to resolve this, let's think about the problem again.

The problem says: "some of these chips in the 25 unit cells... all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour." So, for each row, all chips in that row are the same color, and for each column, all chips in that column are the same color.

Therefore, the coloring is such that the set of white cells is a rectangle (union of entire rows and entire columns), and similarly for black cells, which is the complement.

But crucially, the white rectangle must be a solid rectangle, meaning that the white cells form a contiguous block.

Therefore, the number of such white rectangles is equal to the number of ways to choose a solid rectangle in the grid, which is 15x15=225, as above.

But in our problem, the white rectangle can be any size, from 1x1 up to 5x5.

But in our initial reasoning, we thought of the number of placements as 18, but that was under a different assumption.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the white rectangle as the intersection of some rows and some columns, but the rows and columns don't have to be contiguous.

But in that case, the white rectangle would not necessarily be a solid rectangle.

Wait, no, because if you choose non-consecutive rows and columns, their intersection is still a rectangle, but it's not necessarily a solid rectangle.

Wait, now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the white cells must form a solid rectangle, which is the intersection of some consecutive rows and some consecutive columns.

Therefore, the number of white rectangles is 15x15=225.

Therefore, the number of such placements is 225.

But in the 2x2 grid, that would be 9, which is correct.

But in our problem, the number is 225, but the answer is 225, but that's 225 including all-white and all-black.

But in our problem, we are supposed to place some chips, so we need to exclude the all-black and all-white cases.

Therefore, the number of placements is 225 -2=223.

But in the 2x2 grid, 9 -2=7, but earlier we had 8 placements.

Wait, this is conflicting.

Wait, in the 2x2 grid, with all-white, all-black, and 6 other placements where white is a single cell or a pair of cells.

So, total 8.

But according to the 15x15 logic, it's 9 total white rectangles, minus 1 for all-black, gives 8.

Wait, but in the 2x2 grid, the number of white rectangles is 9, which includes all-white, all-black, and 7 others. So, if we want non-empty, non-saturated placements, it's 8.

Therefore, in the 5x5 grid, the number of non-empty, non-saturated placements is 225 -1=224.

But that seems too large.

Wait, but let's go back to the 2x2 grid.

In the 2x2 grid, the number of white rectangles is 9:

- 4 single cells

- 2 horizontal dominoes

- 2 vertical dominoes

- 1 2x2 square

So, 4 + 2 + 2 +1=9.

So, if we consider all-white, that's 1, all-black is another, so non-empty placements are 9 -2=7. But earlier, I thought it was 8.

But in reality, in the 2x2 grid, the number of non-empty placements is 8, which includes all the single cell white and all the dominoes, but not the all-black. Wait, no.

Wait, actually, when you have a single cell white, then the rest are black, so that's a valid placement. Similarly, when you have a domino white, the rest are black. So, that's 4 +2 +2 +1=9 white rectangles, each corresponding to a unique placement.

But in the problem statement, "some of these chips in the 25 unit cells... all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour."

So, in the 2x2 grid, the all-black placement is allowed, as well as the all-white.

But the problem says "some of these chips", meaning that at least one chip must be placed.

Therefore, all-black is allowed, as it's "some" chips, but it's all black.

But in our earlier count, we considered all-white and all-black as two of the 9 white rectangles.

Therefore, the number of non-empty placements is 9 -1=8, because all-black is allowed, but all-white is a non-empty placement as well.

Wait, no, all-black is a non-empty placement, as it has some chips (all 4 in 2x2). Similarly, all-white is non-empty.

Therefore, all 9 white rectangles are non-empty, so the number of placements is 9.

But in the problem statement, the placement must be saturated, meaning that you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions.

Therefore, in the 2x2 grid, the all-white placement is saturated, because adding any more chips would require changing the color of the row or column.

Similarly, the all-black placement is saturated.

Similarly, each single white cell is saturated because adding any more chips in that row or column would require changing the color.

Therefore, in the 2x2 grid, all 9 white rectangles are valid placements.

But in our initial reasoning, we thought it was 8, but actually, it should be 9.

Therefore, in the 5x5 grid, the number of placements is 225, which includes all-white, all-black, and all the other white rectangles.

But in our problem, do we count all-black as a valid placement? Yes, because it has some chips (all 25 are black). So, all-black is a valid placement.

Similarly, all-white is a valid placement.

Therefore, the number of placements is 225, which includes all-black and all-white.

But in the problem statement, it says "some of these chips", which includes all-black and all-white as they have some chips.

Therefore, the number of valid placements is 225.

But that seems high because, for example, in the 2x2 grid, it's 9, which is 3x3.

But then, in the 5x5 grid, it's 15x15=225.

But let me think about the problem statement again.

We have a 5x5 grid, and we need to place some chips (at least one) such that all chips in the same row and same column have the same color, and the placement is saturated.

So, the placement is determined by a white rectangle and a black rectangle, which are complements.

In this case, the number of such placements is equal to the number of white rectangles, which is 15x15=225.

Therefore, the answer is 225.

But in our initial reasoning, we thought it's 18, but that was under a different assumption.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 225, but let me verify.

Wait, in the 5x5 grid, the number of white rectangles is 15x15=225.

Each white rectangle defines a unique placement, as the black cells are just the complement.

Therefore, the number of placements is 225.

But in the 2x2 grid, this would give 9, which includes all-black and all-white. So, in our problem, the number of placements is 225, which includes all-black and all-white.

But the problem says "some of these chips", so it's okay to have all-black or all-white.

Therefore, the answer is 225.

But wait, in the 2x2 grid, the number is 9, which is 3x3. So, for an n x n grid, it's (n(n+1)/2)^2.

In 2x2, that's (2*3/2)^2=3^2=9, which matches.

In 5x5, it's (5*6/2)^2=15^2=225.

Therefore, the answer is 225.

But wait, let me make sure.

In the 1x1 grid, it's (1*2/2)^2=1^2=1, which is correct, since there's only one cell, either white or black.

Wait, but in the 1x1 grid, the number of placements is 2: all white or all black.

But according to the formula, it's 1. So, that's a problem.

Wait, let's see:

Wait, in the 1x1 grid, the number of white rectangles is 2: either the single cell is white or the single cell is black.

Wait, no, actually, in the 1x1 grid, the number of white rectangles is 1: just the single cell. Similarly, the number of black rectangles is 1. So, total number of white rectangles is 1, but all-black is also a white rectangle? No, all-black is a black rectangle.

Wait, no, in the 1x1 grid, the number of white rectangles is 1: the empty set is not considered because the placement must have some chips. So, the number of white rectangles is 1: the single cell.

But in our problem, all-black is a placement, so the number of placements is 2: all-white and all-black.

But according to the formula, it's (1*2/2)^2=1, which is wrong.

Therefore, the formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the number of white rectangles is (n(n+1)/2), but that counts all possible selections of rows and columns, but in reality, for the white rectangle, it's the intersection of selected rows and selected columns.

So, for the 1x1 grid, the number of white rectangles is 1: the single cell.

But in terms of the problem, the number of placements is 2: all-white and all-black.

Therefore, the formula is not directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps in the 1x1 grid, the number of placements is 2, in the 2x2 grid, it's 9, in the 3x3 grid, it's 36, which is (3*4/2)^2=6^2=36.

Wait, that is, for n x n grid, the number of placements is [ (n(n+1)/2) ]^2.

But in 1x1, that's (1*2/2)^2=1, which is wrong, as we need 2.

Similarly, in 2x2, it's 9, which is correct as per the formula, but in 1x1, it's wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, actually, in the 1x1 grid, the number of white rectangles is 1: the single cell, but the number of placements is 2: all-white and all-black.

Therefore, the formula (n(n+1)/2)^2 gives the number of white rectangles, but in our problem, the number of placements is 2*(n(n+1)/2)^2.

But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps in the 1x1 grid, the number of white rectangles is 1, and the number of black rectangles is 1, so the number of placements is 2, which is 2*(1)^2=2.

Similarly, in 2x2 grid, it's 2*(3)^2=18, but we know it's 9.

Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of placements is equal to the number of white rectangles plus the number of black rectangles, which is 2*(number of white rectangles).

But in 1x1, it's 2, which is 2*(1).

In 2x2 grid, it's 2*(9)=18, but we know that in 2x2 grid, the number of placements is 9.

Therefore, that's also conflicting.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

In the 1x1 grid, the number of placements is 2: all white or all black.

In the 2x2 grid, it's 9: all-white, all-black, and 7 others.

Wait, but that doesn't add up. Wait, in the 2x2 grid, we have 9 white rectangles, which correspond to 9 placements, each with some chips, including all-white and all-black.

Therefore, in the 1x1 grid, the number of placements is 2: all-white and all-black.

In the 2x2 grid, it's 9: all-white, all-black, and 7 others.

In the 3x3 grid, it's 36: all-white, all-black, and 34 others.

Thus, the formula is for n x n grid, the number of placements is (n(n+1)/2)^2.

Which is:

- n=1: (1*2/2)^2=1, but actual is 2.

Wait, so that formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the number of white rectangles is (n+1) x (n+1), but in n=1, it's 4, which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the number of white rectangles is (n+1 choose 2) x (n+1 choose 2), which is [(n+1)n/2]^2.

So, for n=1: (2*1/2)^2=1, which is wrong.

For n=2: (3*2/2)^2=9, which is correct.

For n=3: (4*3/2)^2=36, which is correct.

But for n=1, it's wrong.

So, perhaps in the 1x1 grid, it's a special case.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is correct for n >=2, but for n=1, the number of placements is 2.

Therefore, for n=5, it's (5*6/2)^2=15^2=225.

Therefore, the answer is 225.

But in the 1x1 grid, the number of placements is 2, which is different.

But since the problem is about a 5x5 grid, and the formula gives 225, which is correct for n=2,3, etc., I think that's the answer.

Therefore, the number of ways is 225.

But wait, let me make sure.

Each white rectangle is defined by selecting a set of consecutive rows and a set of consecutive columns. The number of such selections for rows is 15, same for columns, so 15x15=225.

Each such selection defines a unique white rectangle, which in turn defines a unique placement.

Therefore, the number of placements is 225.

But the problem says "some of these chips", so at least one chip. Since the all-black is allowed, which is 25 chips, and all-white is 25 chips, but wait, no.

Wait, in the problem, all-black is a placement with 25 chips, which is allowed.

Similarly, all-white is also allowed.

Therefore, the number of placements is 225, which includes all-black and all-white.

But in the 1x1 grid, the formula doesn't hold, but in 5x5 it does.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{225}

**Final Answer**
The number of ways is \boxed{225}.

To solve the problem of placing some chips in a 5x5 grid such that each row and column has the same color and the placement is saturated, we need to consider the following:

1. Each row and each column must be uniformly colored (all red or all blue).
2. The placement must be saturated, meaning we cannot add any more chips without violating the row or column color constraint.
3. The number of ways to place the chips is equivalent to the number of possible white rectangles (since the black cells form the complement of the white rectangles).

A white rectangle is defined by selecting a set of consecutive rows and a set of consecutive columns. The number of such rectangles is determined by the number of ways to choose consecutive rows and columns in a 5x5 grid.

The number of ways to choose consecutive rows in a 5x5 grid is given by the sum of the first 5 natural numbers, which is:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{5} i = \frac{5 \times 6}{2} = 15 \]

Similarly, the number of ways to choose consecutive columns is also 15. Therefore, the number of white rectangles (and hence the number of placements) is:
\[ 15 \times 15 = 225 \]

Thus, the number of ways to place the chips is:
\[
\boxed{225}
\]
