Question:
There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that:

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Correct Answer:
The problem says 'some', so not all cells must be occupied. We start by doing casework on the column on the left. There can be 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 black chip. The same goes for white chips, so we will multiply by 2 at the end. There is $1$ way to select $5$ cells with black chips. Because of the 2nd condition, there can be no white, and the grid must be all black, yielding $1$ way. There are $5$ ways to select $4$ cells with black chips. We now consider the row that does not contain a black chip. The first cell must be blank, and the remaining $4$ cells have $2^4 - 1$ different ways ($-1$ comes from all blank). This gives us $75$ ways. Notice that for $3$, $2$, or $1$ black chips on the left, there is a pattern. Once the first blank row is chosen, the rest of the blank rows must be ordered similarly. For example, with $2$ black chips on the left, there will be $3$ blank rows. There are $15$ ways for the first row to be chosen, and the following $2$ rows must have the same order. Thus, the number of ways for $3$, $2$, and $1$ black chips is $10\times 15$, $10\times 15$, $5\times 15$. Adding these up, we have $1 + 75 + 150 + 150 + 75 = 451$. Multiplying this by $2$, we get $902$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the number of ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. The chips can be either white or black, and they're indistinguishable. Each cell can have at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Additionally, any additional chip placed would violate one or more of these conditions. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down.

First, I need to visualize the grid. It's a 5x5 grid, so 25 cells in total. Each cell can have either a white chip, a black chip, or be empty. But with the constraints that all chips in a row must be the same color, and all chips in a column must be the same color. Plus, we can't add any more chips without breaking these rules.

Wait, so if a row has some chips, they all have to be the same color. Similarly, for each column, all the chips must be the same color. That means, for example, if I have a row with white chips, then every column that intersects with that row must also have white chips. But hold on, no, because each column can independently have its own color, but if a column intersects with a row that's all white, then that column must also be all white.

Wait, is that necessarily true? Let's think. Suppose I have a row that's all white. Then, any column that has a chip in that row must also be white because the column's chips have to be the same color. Similarly, if a column is all black, then any row that intersects with that column must also be black. So, actually, the rows and columns must be consistent with each other.

This seems like a grid where the colors of the rows and columns are interdependent. So, perhaps, the grid has some kind of rectangular blocks where entire subgrids are filled with a single color, and these subgrids must align such that their rows and columns don't conflict.

But wait, the problem says that each cell can have at most one chip, but it doesn't say that each cell must have a chip. So, some cells can be empty. But we have to place as many chips as possible without violating the conditions, and adding any more chips would break the conditions.

So, the condition that adding any more chips would violate either the row or column constraints. That suggests that the placement we're looking for is a maximal set under these constraints. So, it's a placement where you can't add another chip without either violating a row or a column color constraint.

Hmm, okay. So, perhaps, the grid is divided into regions where each region is a rectangle of a single color, and these regions don't overlap. But since it's a 5x5 grid, it's possible that some rows and columns are entirely empty or entirely filled with chips of a single color.

Wait, maybe it's simpler to think in terms of the rows and columns. Since each row must be all one color or empty, and each column must be all one color or empty. So, the grid can be thought of as a combination of some rows and some columns, each colored either white or black, such that their intersections are consistent.

But wait, if a row is colored white, then every column that intersects with that row must also be colored white. Similarly, if a column is colored black, then every row that intersects with that column must be colored black. So, the coloring of rows and columns is interdependent.

Therefore, the colorings of the rows and columns must form a consistent partition of the grid into rectangles where each rectangle is entirely white or entirely black. So, for example, you could have some rows colored white and some columns colored white, but their intersection must be white, and similarly for black.

Wait, is that right? Let me think. Suppose I color a row white. Then, any column that has a chip in that row must also be white. So, if I have a row that's white, the entire column where that row intersects must also be white. Similarly, if I color a column black, then the entire row where that column intersects must be black.

Therefore, the coloring is such that if a row is colored, say, white, then all columns that have any chips in that row must be white. Similarly, if a column is colored black, then all rows that have any chips in that column must be black.

Therefore, the grid can be partitioned into four regions:

1. White rows and white columns: Intersection is white.
2. White rows and black columns: Intersection is white.
3. Black rows and white columns: Intersection is black.
4. Black rows and black columns: Intersection is black.

But since we can't have both white and black in the same row or column, the regions must be such that once a row is colored white, all columns intersecting it must be white, and if a column is colored black, all rows intersecting it must be black.

So, the grid is divided into four blocks:

- Top-left: White rows and white columns.
- Top-right: White rows and black columns.
- Bottom-left: Black rows and white columns.
- Bottom-right: Black rows and black columns.

But in this case, all the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right blocks must be entirely white, black, white, or black respectively.

Wait, no. Because if a row is white, then all columns intersecting it must be white. Similarly, if a column is black, all rows intersecting it must be black.

Therefore, the grid can be partitioned into two sets:

- A set of rows colored white, and a set of columns colored white. Their intersection is white.
- A set of rows colored black, and a set of columns colored black. Their intersection is black.

Additionally, the white rows can also have columns colored black, but wait, no, because if a column is colored black, then the entire row must be black. So, if a column is black, all the rows that intersect with it must be black. Similarly, if a row is white, all columns that intersect with it must be white. So, this actually creates a sort of grid where if any row is white, all the columns that intersect it must be white, meaning all the cells in those columns are white.

Similarly, if any column is black, all the rows intersecting it must be black. So, this seems like the grid is divided into four quadrants, but the top-left and bottom-right can be colored independently, while the top-right and bottom-left are determined by the colors of the rows and columns.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of selecting some rows to be white and some columns to be white, and the remaining rows and columns must be black or something else. Wait, no, because if you have a row that is white, all the columns that have a chip in that row must be white. So, perhaps, if you have a row colored white, all the columns that have a chip in that row are colored white, and similarly, if a column is colored black, all the rows that have a chip in that column are colored black.

Therefore, the grid is divided into two parts: white and black. The white part consists of some rows and some columns, and the black part consists of the remaining rows and columns. But the white part is such that any cell in a white row and a white column is white, but a white row and a black column would conflict because if a column is black, the row must be black. Similarly, a black row and a white column would conflict because if a row is black, the column must be black.

Therefore, the grid must be such that all white rows have all their columns white, and all black rows have all their columns black. Similarly, all white columns have all their rows white, and all black columns have all their rows black.

Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me clarify.

Suppose I have a row colored white. Then, any column that intersects this row must also be white. So, if I have a white row, all the columns that intersect it must be white. Similarly, if I have a black column, all the rows that intersect it must be black.

Therefore, the grid is divided into two parts:

1. A white rectangle formed by a set of white rows and white columns.
2. A black rectangle formed by the remaining black rows and black columns.

But wait, the white rectangle and the black rectangle can't overlap because rows and columns are either white or black, so the white rectangle is the intersection of white rows and white columns, and the black rectangle is the intersection of black rows and black columns. The other regions (white rows and black columns, black rows and white columns) are empty because you can't have a white row and a black column in the same grid without violating the constraints.

Wait, no, actually, the white rows can have black columns, but if a column is black, then the entire row must be black. So, if a column is black, all the rows that intersect it must be black, which would mean that the white rows can't intersect with black columns. Therefore, the white rows must only intersect with white columns, and the black columns must only intersect with black rows. Similarly, white columns can only intersect with white rows, and black rows can only intersect with black columns.

Therefore, the grid is divided into four quadrants:

1. Top-left: White rows and white columns.
2. Top-right: White rows and black columns. But wait, if a column is black, all rows intersecting must be black, so top-right can't have white rows.
3. Bottom-left: Black rows and white columns. But if a row is black, all columns intersecting must be black, so bottom-left can't have white columns.
4. Bottom-right: Black rows and black columns.

So, the only regions that can be non-empty are the top-left (white) and the bottom-right (black). The top-right and bottom-left must be empty because they would violate the constraints if they were non-empty.

Therefore, the grid is split into two separate rectangles: one white rectangle on the top-left and one black rectangle on the bottom-right. The top-right and bottom-left are empty.

Wait, but the grid is 5x5, so how do we split it? The white rectangle can be any size from 0x0 up to 5x5, but actually, it can't be larger than 5x5. Similarly, the black rectangle can be any size from 0x0 up to 5x5, but their intersection must be empty.

But actually, the white rectangle is formed by a certain number of white rows and white columns, and the black rectangle is formed by the remaining black rows and black columns.

So, for example, if I choose k white rows and l white columns, then the white rectangle is k x l. The remaining (5 - k) rows are black, and the remaining (5 - l) columns are black. The black rectangle is (5 - k) x (5 - l). But the white rectangle and the black rectangle don't overlap because the white rows don't intersect with the black columns and the black rows don't intersect with the white columns.

Therefore, the entire grid is partitioned into these two rectangles, one white and one black, with the rest being empty. So, the key is that the placement must consist of a white rectangle and a black rectangle, with the rest empty, such that any additional chip would violate the row or column constraints.

But wait, no, the problem says that any additional chip would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So, that means that the placement is such that it's maximal. So, in other words, it's a placement where you can't add another chip without either violating the row or column color condition.

Therefore, the placement must be such that every possible cell that could be filled either is already filled, or if filled, would violate the row or column color condition.

Wait, so it's a maximal set, meaning it's a placement where all possible extensions would violate the constraints. So, in this case, the grid is divided into two rectangles: a white rectangle and a black rectangle, with no overlapping, and the rest of the grid is empty.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of such maximal placements, which corresponds to choosing a white rectangle and a black rectangle such that they don't overlap and together they form a maximal set.

But wait, how do we count these? It seems like for each possible white rectangle, we can compute the corresponding black rectangle, but we have to ensure that the black rectangle is placed in the remaining area.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as choosing a subset of rows and columns to be white, and the remaining rows and columns to be black. But with the constraints that the white rows and columns don't interfere with the black rows and columns.

But since the white rows must be entirely white, and the black rows must be entirely black, and similarly for columns. Therefore, the grid is divided into four regions:

1. White rows and white columns: All white.
2. White rows and black columns: Must be white, but if a column is black, the entire row must be black. Therefore, the white rows can only have white columns, so this region must be empty.
3. Black rows and white columns: Similarly, if a row is black, the entire column must be black, so this region must be empty.
4. Black rows and black columns: All black.

Thus, the grid is divided into two regions: the top-left (white) and the bottom-right (black), with the top-right and bottom-left regions being empty.

Therefore, the grid is split into two rectangles: one white and one black, with the remaining cells being empty. The key is that both rectangles must be placed in such a way that they don't overlap, and they are each rectangles (i.e., contiguous blocks).

Wait, but in a grid, rectangles can be any size, as long as they are contiguous. So, the white rectangle can be any rectangle in the top-left corner, and the black rectangle can be any rectangle in the bottom-right corner. The regions in between must be empty.

But actually, in a 5x5 grid, the top-left rectangle and the bottom-right rectangle can be any size, but their positions are fixed by the number of rows and columns chosen for each color.

Wait, actually, if I choose k white rows and l white columns, then the white rectangle is k x l. Then, the black rectangle is (5 - k) x (5 - l), but it has to fit into the remaining grid. So, the white rectangle is placed in the top-left k x l area, and the black rectangle is placed in the bottom-right (5 - k) x (5 - l) area.

But the black rectangle can't overlap with the white rectangle, so the white rectangle is from rows 1 to k and columns 1 to l, and the black rectangle is from rows k+1 to 5 and columns l+1 to 5.

Therefore, for each k and l, where k is the number of white rows and l is the number of white columns, we can define a unique maximal placement where the top-left k x l is white, the bottom-right (5 - k) x (5 - l) is black, and the rest is empty.

But wait, is that the only way? Because if I choose different positions for the black rectangle, but given the constraints, the black rectangle must be in the bottom-right corner. So, actually, no, the black rectangle is determined by the white rectangle.

Alternatively, maybe the black rectangle can be anywhere else, but no, because if you have a black column, all rows in that column must be black, so it can't be in the middle. Similarly, a black row can't be in the middle because that would require all columns in that row to be black, which would conflict with the white columns.

Therefore, the only way to have a maximal placement is to have a white rectangle on the top-left and a black rectangle on the bottom-right, with the rest being empty.

Therefore, the number of such maximal placements is equal to the number of possible white rectangles, which is determined by the number of white rows and white columns.

So, for each possible number of white rows k (from 0 to 5) and white columns l (from 0 to 5), we can have a white rectangle of size k x l, and the black rectangle will be (5 - k) x (5 - l) in the bottom-right corner.

However, we have to ensure that the black rectangle is non-overlapping with the white rectangle, which is naturally satisfied because the white rectangle is in the top-left and the black rectangle is in the bottom-right.

But wait, for example, if we choose k = 0 white rows, then the entire grid is black, so the black rectangle is 5 x 5. Similarly, if we choose l = 0 white columns, the entire grid is black. Similarly, if we choose k = 5 white rows, the entire grid is white, and so on.

But in the problem statement, it says "some of these chips," so we can have placements where all cells are empty, but that might be a trivial case. However, the problem specifies that each cell contains at most one chip, so the empty placement is allowed, but I think the condition about adding another chip only applies if you can add a chip. If the grid is completely empty, then adding any chip would violate the conditions? Wait, no. Because if the grid is completely empty, you can add a chip anywhere, but you have to maintain the row and column color constraints.

Wait, but the problem says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color." If the grid is empty, then adding a chip would require that row and column to have the same color, but since there's only one chip, it can be considered as either white or black. But actually, the color is arbitrary.

Wait, maybe the empty grid is considered a valid placement because you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions, but actually, you can add chips. So, the empty grid would not satisfy the condition that adding any more chips would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. Because you can add chips without violating the conditions.

Therefore, the empty grid is not a maximal placement because you can add more chips. So, the maximal placements must be such that every possible addition would violate a row or a column condition.

Therefore, in our earlier analysis, the grid must be divided into a white rectangle and a black rectangle, with the rest empty, and these two rectangles must cover all possible cells that can be added without violating the constraints.

Wait, but if the grid is divided into a white rectangle and a black rectangle, the cells outside of these two rectangles are empty. So, adding a chip to the white rectangle would require that row and column to have the same color, which they already do, so you can add chips to the white rectangle without violating anything. Similarly, adding a chip to the black rectangle is also allowed.

Wait, that contradicts the condition that adding any more chips would violate one or more of the conditions. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the white rectangle and the black rectangle must cover the entire grid. That is, every cell is either in the white rectangle or the black rectangle. Therefore, you can't add any more chips because every cell is already occupied. So, that would mean the grid is either entirely white, entirely black, or divided into a white rectangle and a black rectangle such that all cells are covered.

But in that case, the entire grid is either white, black, or a combination where the white rectangle and black rectangle together cover the entire grid. But in a 5x5 grid, how can the white rectangle and black rectangle cover the entire grid? They would have to be such that the white rectangle is in the top-left and the black rectangle is in the bottom-right with no overlapping. But then, the cells in the top-right and bottom-left would be empty, so you can add chips there.

Wait, so maybe it's not necessary that the entire grid is covered. Instead, to be maximal, every possible cell not in the current placement must be in a position where adding a chip would violate either its row or column constraints.

Therefore, if a cell is in the top-right, which is white rows and black columns, adding a chip there would require that the corresponding row (white) and column (black). But since the column is black, all the rows in that column must be black, but the row is white, so that's a contradiction. Similarly, if a cell is in the bottom-left, which is black rows and white columns, adding a chip there would require that the corresponding row (black) and column (white). But since the row is black, all the columns in that row must be black, but the column is white, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, adding a chip to the top-right or bottom-left regions would violate the constraints. Therefore, these regions must be empty, so the only possible cells to place chips are in the white rectangle (top-left) and the black rectangle (bottom-right). But since the grid is 5x5, the white rectangle can be any size from 0x0 up to 5x5, and the black rectangle is determined by the remaining rows and columns.

Wait, so the maximal placement must consist of two rectangles: the top-left (white) and the bottom-right (black). The rest of the grid (top-right and bottom-left) must be empty because otherwise, you could add a chip there without violating the constraints.

Therefore, the number of such maximal placements is equal to the number of possible white rectangles in the top-left corner, which is determined by the number of white rows and white columns. For each k from 0 to 5 (number of white rows) and l from 0 to 5 (number of white columns), we can define a white rectangle of size k x l, and the rest of the grid is either empty or black.

But wait, no, because the black rectangle is determined by the remaining rows and columns. So, for each k and l, the black rectangle is (5 - k) x (5 - l). But the black rectangle must also be placed in the bottom-right corner, so k and l must satisfy that k <= 5 and l <= 5, but also, the black rectangle must be in the remaining part.

But actually, for each k and l, the white rectangle is k x l, and the black rectangle is (5 - k) x (5 - l). However, in order to have a valid black rectangle, we must have that (5 - k) and (5 - l) are non-negative, which they are because k and l are between 0 and 5.

But in this case, the total number of maximal placements would be the number of possible k and l, which is 6 x 6 = 36. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me think. For each k from 0 to 5, and for each l from 0 to 5, we can define a unique maximal placement where the top-left k x l is white, the bottom-right (5 - k) x (5 - l) is black, and the rest is empty. So, yes, that would give us 6 x 6 = 36 possibilities.

But hold on, when k = 0 and l = 0, the entire grid is black. Similarly, when k = 5 and l = 5, the entire grid is white. When k = 5 and l = 0, the entire grid is black in the bottom-right 0 x 5, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, if k = 5, then the white rectangle is 5 x l, and the black rectangle is 0 x (5 - l). So, when k = 5, the white rectangle is the entire grid in terms of rows, but you can choose any number of columns l, which would make the white rectangle 5 x l, and the black rectangle would be 0 x (5 - l), which is just empty.

Similarly, when l = 5, the white rectangle is k x 5, and the black rectangle is (5 - k) x 0, which is also empty.

Therefore, all 36 possibilities are valid, but some of them correspond to the same grid. For example, when k = 5 and l = 5, the entire grid is white. When k = 5 and l = 0, the entire grid is black. So, each choice of k and l gives a unique grid.

But wait, actually, the number of distinct maximal placements is 36 because each k and l defines a unique configuration.

However, let me think again. If we fix k and l, then the grid is uniquely determined: top-left k x l is white, bottom-right (5 - k) x (5 - l) is black, and the rest is empty. So, yes, each pair (k, l) gives a unique grid. Therefore, the number is 6 x 6 = 36.

But wait, in the case where k = 0 and l = 0, the entire grid is black. Similarly, when k = 5 and l = 5, the entire grid is white. So, those are just two of the 36 cases. So, the total number is indeed 36.

But hold on, let me test this with smaller grids to see if this logic holds. Let's take a 1x1 grid. Then, k and l can be 0 or 1, so 2x2=4 possibilities. Let's enumerate them:

1. k=0, l=0: entire grid is black.
2. k=0, l=1: top-left 0x1 is empty, bottom-right 1x0 is empty. So, the grid is empty? Wait, no. If k=0, l=1, the white rectangle is 0x1 (top-left), and the black rectangle is 1x0 (bottom-right). So, the grid is empty? But can we have an empty grid?

Wait, but in the 1x1 case, if we have k=0, l=1, then the white rectangle is 0x1, which is empty, and the black rectangle is 1x0, which is also empty. So, the grid is empty. Similarly, if k=1, l=0, the grid is empty. If k=1, l=1, the grid is white. So, actually, for 1x1, we have three possibilities: empty, white, or black. But according to our formula, 2x2=4, which is not matching.

Hmm, so that suggests that our initial reasoning is flawed.

Wait, in the 1x1 grid, the number of maximal placements is 3: empty, white, or black. But according to our earlier logic, it's 4. So, there's a discrepancy.

Wait, maybe in the 1x1 grid, the empty grid is not a maximal placement because you can add a chip anywhere. So, the empty grid is not a maximal placement because adding a chip would not violate the conditions. So, actually, the only maximal placements are the all-white and all-black grids, which are two.

But wait, in the 1x1 grid, if you have an empty grid, adding a chip would require that row and column to be colored, but since the grid is 1x1, it's just one row and one column. So, you could color it white or black. So, the empty grid is not maximal because you can add a chip. Therefore, only the all-white and all-black grids are maximal. So, the answer is 2.

But according to our earlier formula, it's 4. So, the formula is overcounting because it includes empty grids which are not maximal.

So, perhaps, we need to adjust our reasoning.

Wait, in the 1x1 grid, the maximal placements are only two: all white and all black.

Similarly, in the 2x2 grid, let's see how many maximal placements there are.

If k=0 and l=0: entire grid is black.
k=0, l=1: top-left 0x1 is empty, bottom-right 2x1 is black. So, the grid has two black chips in the bottom row.
k=0, l=2: entire grid is black.
k=1, l=0: top-left 1x0 is empty, bottom-right 1x2 is black. So, two black chips in the right column.
k=1, l=1: top-left 1x1 is white, bottom-right 1x1 is black. So, one white chip in top-left and one black chip in bottom-right.
k=1, l=2: top-left 1x2 is white, bottom-right 1x0 is empty. So, two white chips in the top row.
k=2, l=0: entire grid is white.
k=2, l=1: entire grid is white.
k=2, l=2: entire grid is white.

So, in this case, the number of maximal placements is:

- All white: k=2, l=0; k=2, l=1; k=2, l=2. But actually, k=2, l=0 is the entire grid in the top-left 2x0, which is empty, and the bottom-right 0x2, which is also empty. Wait, no, if k=2, l=0: the white rectangle is 2x0, which is empty, and the black rectangle is 0x2, which is also empty. So, the grid is empty. Similarly, k=2, l=1: white rectangle is 2x1, so the left column is white, and the right column is empty. But the black rectangle is 0x1, which is empty. So, the grid has two white chips in the left column. Similarly, k=2, l=2: entire grid is white.

Wait, so for the 2x2 grid, the maximal placements are:

1. Entire white.
2. Entire black.
3. Two white in the left column, two black in the right column.
4. Two white in the top row, two black in the bottom row.

Wait, that seems like four maximal placements.

But according to the formula, which was 3x3=9, which is way too high.

Wait, so clearly, our initial formula is incorrect because in the 2x2 grid, we have four maximal placements, not nine.

Therefore, our earlier reasoning is flawed.

Alternative approach: Let's think of the grid as having two parts: the white area and the black area. The white area is a rectangle on the top-left, and the black area is a rectangle on the bottom-right. The regions in between must be empty because otherwise, you can add chips there without violating the constraints.

Therefore, for each possible white rectangle (k x l), where k is the number of white rows and l is the number of white columns, the black rectangle is fixed as (5 - k) x (5 - l). So, the number of maximal placements is equal to the number of possible k and l such that k and l are non-negative integers, and k <= 5, l <=5.

But in the 1x1 grid, that would give 2x2=4, but we saw that only two are valid. So, perhaps in the 1x1 grid, some of the cases are invalid because the black rectangle is of size (1 - k) x (1 - l), which when k=0, l=0, gives 1x1, which is the entire grid, but that would be the same as k=1, l=1. So, in that case, it's overlapping.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that in the 1x1 grid, when you choose k=0, l=0, it's equivalent to choosing k=1, l=1, since the entire grid is black. Similarly, k=0, l=1 is equivalent to k=1, l=0, because it's just a single cell. So, in the 1x1 grid, the number of unique maximal placements is 3: all white, all black, or a single cell (either white or black). But wait, but in the 1x1 grid, if you have a single cell, you can add another chip, which would be the same cell, but since you can only have one chip, you can't add another. Wait, but in the 1x1 grid, the single cell is already occupied.

Wait, actually, in the 1x1 grid, the only maximal placements are:

1. The grid is entirely white.
2. The grid is entirely black.
3. The grid has one white chip.
4. The grid has one black chip.

But wait, but if you have one white chip, then you can't add another chip anywhere else because the row and column would already be white, and you can't add a black chip to the same row or column. Similarly, if you have one black chip, you can't add a white chip.

But in the problem statement, it says "some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5×5 grid such that...". So, the empty grid is not a valid placement because you can add a chip. So, the empty grid is not considered, but the single chip placements are considered because they cannot have more chips added.

Therefore, in the 1x1 grid, the number of maximal placements is 4: all white, all black, white, or black.

But earlier, when we thought about the empty grid, we considered it invalid because you can add a chip. So, in the 1x1 grid, the number of maximal placements is 4, but according to our initial formula, it's 4 as well. So, maybe the formula is correct.

Wait, let me clarify. In the 1x1 grid, the possible maximal placements are:

- All white: 1 way.
- All black: 1 way.
- Single white: 1 way.
- Single black: 1 way.

So, total of 4, which is equal to 2x2=4.

But in the 2x2 grid, according to this, the number would be 3x3=9. But when I thought about it earlier, I only found four maximal placements, but maybe I was wrong.

Wait, let me think again. In the 2x2 grid, k can be 0,1,2, and l can be 0,1,2.

So, for k=0, l=0: entire grid is black.
k=0, l=1: bottom-right 2x1 is black, top-left 0x1 is empty. So, two black chips in the bottom row.
k=0, l=2: entire grid is black.
k=1, l=0: bottom-right 1x2 is black, top-left 1x0 is empty. So, two black chips in the right column.
k=1, l=1: top-left 1x1 is white, bottom-right 1x1 is black. One white and one black chip.
k=1, l=2: top-left 1x2 is white, bottom-right 1x0 is empty. Two white chips in the top row.
k=2, l=0: entire grid is white.
k=2, l=1: top-left 2x1 is white, bottom-right 0x1 is empty. Two white chips in the left column.
k=2, l=2: entire grid is white.

So, in this case, the number of unique maximal placements is:

- All white.
- All black.
- Two white in top row.
- Two white in left column.
- Two black in bottom row.
- Two black in right column.
- One white and one black in the center.

Wait, that's 7 maximal placements, not 9. Hmm, so in this case, some k and l combinations result in the same grid as others.

For example, k=0, l=1 is two black chips in the bottom row, which is the same as k=1, l=2 (two white in the top row). Wait, no, they are different because one is two black in the bottom row, and the other is two white in the top row.

Wait, but in the 2x2 grid, k=0, l=1 is two black in the bottom row; k=1, l=0 is two black in the right column. So, they are different.

Similarly, k=1, l=1 is a single white in top-left and single black in bottom-right.

So, in total, 7 maximal placements.

Wait, so in the 2x2 grid, the number is 7, which is less than 9.

So, this suggests that the formula k x l with k and l from 0 to n is not correct because it overcounts due to symmetries or overlaps in the grids.

Therefore, perhaps the formula is incorrect, and we need a different approach.

Alternative approach: Instead of considering all possible k and l, let's think about the possible ways to choose the white and black regions.

Given that in the 5x5 grid, the white rectangle is a rectangle in the top-left corner, and the black rectangle is a rectangle in the bottom-right corner, with the rest of the grid empty.

So, for each possible white rectangle (k x l), the black rectangle is uniquely determined as (5 - k) x (5 - l). Therefore, the number of such placements is (number of possible k) x (number of possible l).

But in the 1x1 grid, this would be 2 x 2 = 4, which is correct because we have four maximal placements.

In the 2x2 grid, it's 3 x 3 = 9, but we saw that in reality, some of these are equivalent or invalid.

Wait, but in the 2x2 grid, according to the earlier enumeration, it's 7. So, perhaps the formula is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in enumerating the 2x2 grid.

Let me list all possible k and l:

k=0, l=0: entire grid black.
k=0, l=1: bottom-right 2x1 black, top-left 0x1 empty.
k=0, l=2: entire grid black.
k=1, l=0: bottom-right 1x2 black, top-left 1x0 empty.
k=1, l=1: top-left 1x1 white, bottom-right 1x1 black.
k=1, l=2: top-left 1x2 white, bottom-right 1x0 empty.
k=2, l=0: entire grid white.
k=2, l=1: top-left 2x1 white, bottom-right 0x1 empty.
k=2, l=2: entire grid white.

So, each of these is unique, so it's 9.

But earlier, I thought that some of these are equivalent, but actually, they are not. Each k and l defines a unique grid.

Wait, so in the 2x2 grid, the number is indeed 9, as per the formula. So, where did I go wrong earlier?

Ah, I think I was confusing the regions. For example, k=0, l=1 is different from k=1, l=0 because in one case, the black rectangle is in the bottom row, and in the other, it's in the right column. So, they are different grids.

Similarly, k=1, l=1 is a single white and single black, which is different from k=0, l=1 (two blacks) or k=1, l=0 (two blacks). So, in total, 9 unique grids.

So, maybe the formula is correct after all. In the 1x1 grid, 4 maximal placements, in the 2x2 grid, 9, in the 5x5 grid, 36.

But wait, when we thought about the 1x1 grid, we considered all four possibilities, but in reality, some of them are not allowed because you can add more chips.

Wait, no, in the 1x1 grid, the formula gives 4, which are:

- All white.
- All black.
- Single white.
- Single black.

But in the problem statement, it says "some of these chips in the 25 unit cells... such that... any additional chip... would violate one or more of the previous two conditions."

So, in the 1x1 grid, the empty grid is not allowed because you can add a chip, which would not violate the conditions. Therefore, the empty grid is not a valid maximal placement.

Similarly, in the 2x2 grid, the empty grid is not a valid maximal placement because you can add chips anywhere.

Therefore, perhaps the formula counts the empty grid as a valid maximal placement, but in reality, it's not, so we need to subtract 1.

In the 1x1 grid, formula says 4, but actual maximal placements are 3 (all white, all black, single white, single black). Wait, 4 is still correct because single white and single black are separate, plus all white and all black.

Wait, in the 1x1 grid, the empty grid is invalid, but all other 3 are valid? No, because the empty grid is just one, but in the formula, it's counted as k=0, l=0; k=0, l=1; k=1, l=0; k=1, l=1. So, four possibilities, but only three are valid because the empty grid is invalid.

Wait, no, in the 1x1 grid, for k=0, l=0: the grid is entirely black. For k=0, l=1: the grid has a single white chip. For k=1, l=0: the grid has a single black chip. For k=1, l=1: the grid is entirely white.

So, in this case, all four are valid maximal placements because:

- All white: cannot add any more chips.
- All black: cannot add any more chips.
- Single white: cannot add any more chips because the row and column are already white.
- Single black: same as above.

So, all four are valid. Therefore, in the 1x1 grid, the formula gives the correct count.

Similarly, in the 2x2 grid, the formula gives 9, which are all valid maximal placements because each one cannot have additional chips added without violating the constraints.

So, going back, in the 5x5 grid, the number of maximal placements is 6 x 6 = 36.

But let me think again. For each k from 0 to 5, and l from 0 to 5, each combination gives a unique maximal placement where the top-left k x l is white, and the bottom-right (5 - k) x (5 - l) is black, with the rest empty. Each of these placements is such that adding any additional chip would require placing it either in the top-right or bottom-left regions, which cannot be done without violating the row or column color constraints.

Therefore, in the 5x5 grid, the number of such maximal placements is indeed 6 x 6 = 36.

But wait, let me check for a slightly larger grid, say 3x3, to see if the formula holds.

In a 3x3 grid, according to the formula, the number of maximal placements would be 4 x 4 = 16.

Let me see:

- All white: 1
- All black: 1
- Single white: 4 (each cell)
- Single black: 4 (each cell)
- Two white in a row: 3 rows x 2 columns = 6
- Two white in a column: 3 columns x 2 rows = 6
- etc.

Wait, but actually, for each k and l, the number of maximal placements is 4, which is 2x2, but in a 3x3 grid, k and l can be 0,1,2,3, so 4x4=16.

But enumerating them would be tedious, but if we accept that the formula works for smaller grids, then we can trust it for 5x5.

Therefore, the answer should be 6 x 6 = 36.

But wait, let me make sure that each of these placements is indeed maximal.

For example, take a 5x5 grid with k=3, l=2. So, the top-left 3x2 is white, and the bottom-right 2x3 is black. The rest is empty. Can we add a chip anywhere?

If I try to add a chip to the top-right region (columns 3-5, rows 1-3), it would have to be either white or black. If it's white, then the entire row 1-3 must be white, but they already have white in columns 1-2, but columns 3-5 are empty, so if I make them white, row 1-3 would be all white, but the columns 3-5 would now have white chips, so they must be white. Similarly, adding a white chip to the top-right would require the entire top-right region to be white, which would make the top-left 3x2 and top-right 3x3 all white, making the top 3 rows entirely white, which would require the bottom 2 rows to also be white because column 1-5 would be white.

Wait, no, because in the initial placement, the bottom-right is black. So, if I add a white chip in the top-right, since column 3-5, row 1-3, the entire column must be white. So, columns 3-5 would have white chips in rows 1-3, but the bottom part of columns 3-5 is in the black rectangle, so they must already be black. Therefore, adding a white chip to column 3-5, row 1-3 would be a contradiction because the bottom part of column 3-5 is black. Therefore, you cannot add a white chip there.

Similarly, if you try to add a black chip to the top-right region, the entire column would have to be black, but the top part is already white, so that's a contradiction.

Therefore, the top-right region cannot have any chips added. Similarly, the bottom-left region cannot have any chips added because adding a white chip to the bottom-left would require the entire row and column to be white, which would conflict with the existing black rectangle.

Therefore, each of these placements is indeed maximal.

Therefore, the number of such maximal placements is 6 x 6 = 36.

Hence, the answer is 36.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{36}
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some chips in a 5x5 grid such that each cell contains at most one chip, all chips in the same row and column have the same color, and any additional chip would violate one or more of these conditions.

1. **Understanding the Constraints**:
   - Each cell can contain at most one chip.
   - All chips in the same row and column must have the same color.
   - Adding any additional chip must violate the row or column color constraint.

2. **Grid Division**:
   - The grid can be divided into four regions: top-left (white), top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right (black).
   - The top-right and bottom-left regions must be empty because adding a chip there would violate the constraints.

3. **Maximal Placements**:
   - The grid is divided into a white rectangle on the top-left and a black rectangle on the bottom-right.
   - The white rectangle can be of any size from 0x0 to 5x5, and the black rectangle is determined by the remaining rows and columns.

4. **Counting the Placements**:
   - For each possible number of rows \( k \) (from 0 to 5) and columns \( l \) (from 0 to 5), we can form a white rectangle of size \( k \times l \).
   - The black rectangle is then of size \( (5 - k) \times (5 - l) \).

5. **Result**:
   - The number of such maximal placements is determined by the number of possible pairs \((k, l)\), which is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \).

Thus, the number of ways to place the chips is \(\boxed{36}\).
