Question:
Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Correct Answer:
Let $r$ be the number of red vertices and $b$ be the number of blue vertices, where $r+b=8$. By the Pigeonhole Principle, $r\geq{b} \Longrightarrow b\leq4$ if a configuration is valid.

We claim that if $b\leq3$, then any configuration is valid. We attempt to prove by the following:

If there are $b\in{0,1,2}$ vertices, then intuitively any configuration is valid. For $b=3$, we do cases:

If all the vertices in $b$ are non-adjacent, then simply rotating once in any direction suffices. If there are $2$ adjacent vertices, then WLOG let us create a set $\{b_1,b_2,r_1\cdots\}$ where the third $b_3$ is somewhere later in the set. If we assign the set as $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$ and $b_3\leq4$, then intuitively, rotating it $4$ will suffice. If $b_3=5$, then rotating it by 2 will suffice. Consider any other $b_3>5$ as simply a mirror to a configuration of the cases.

Therefore, if $b\leq3$, then there are $\sum_{i=0}^{3}{\binom{8}{i}}=93$ ways. We do count the degenerate case.

Now if $b=4$, we do casework on the number of adjacent vertices. 0 adjacent: $\{b_1,r_1,b_2,r_2\cdots{r_4}\}$. There are 4 axes of symmetry so there are only $\frac{8}{4}=2$ rotations of this configuration.

1 adjacent: WLOG $\{b_1,b_2\cdots{b_3}\cdots{b_4}\}$ where $b_4\neq{8}$. Listing out the cases and trying, we get that $b_3=4$ and $b_4=7$ is the only configuration. There are $8$ ways to choose $b_1$ and $b_2$ and the rest is set, so there are $8$ ways.

2 adjacent: We can have WLOG $\{b_1,b_2\cdots{b_3},b_4\}$ or $\{b_1,b_2,b_3\cdots\}$ where $b_4\neq{8}$. The former yields the case $b_3=5$ and $b_4=6$ by simply rotating it 2 times. The latter yields none. There are 2 axes of symmetry so there are $\frac{8}{2}=4$ configurations.

3 adjacent: WLOG $\{b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4\cdots\}$ which intuitively works. There are $8$ configurations here as $b_1$ can is unique.

In total, $b=4$ yields $2+8+4+8=22$ configurations.

There are $22+93=115$ configurations in total. There are $2^8=256$ total cases, so the probability is $\frac{115}{256}$. Adding them up, we get $115+256=\boxed{371}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this probability problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal chance. I need to find the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Let me try to parse this problem step by step.

First, a regular octagon has 8 vertices, each of which is colored red or blue with probability 1/2 each. So, the total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256. That's our denominator for the probability.

Now, the question is about the probability that there exists a rotation (which can be by any multiple of 45 degrees, since it's a regular octagon) such that after rotating the octagon, every blue vertex is in a position that was originally red.

Wait, let me make sure I get this. So, after rotation, wherever a blue vertex is, the original vertex there was red. So, all blue vertices are mapped to red vertices. But importantly, the original blue vertices can be anywhere, but after rotation, they end up on red vertices.

Wait, but the octagon is being rotated, so the labeling of the vertices doesn't change; instead, the colors are being moved. So, actually, it's about the set of blue vertices being such that when the octagon is rotated, the set of blue vertices is a subset of the original red vertices.

Or, more precisely, the set of blue vertices can be rotated to lie entirely within the original red vertices.

So, in other words, the set of blue vertices is a subset of some rotated version of the original red vertices.

Wait, let me try to think in terms of group theory maybe? The octagon's rotational symmetries form a cyclic group of order 8. So, each rotation corresponds to a cyclic shift by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions.

So, we can think of the coloring as a binary string of length 8, where each bit is 0 (red) or 1 (blue). Then, the question is: what is the probability that there exists some rotation k (where k = 0 to 7) such that the rotated coloring (which is a cyclic shift of the original coloring) has all 1s (blue) in positions that were originally 0s (red).

Wait, that might not be exactly right. Let me think again. If we rotate the octagon by k positions, then each vertex moves k positions forward. So, the color at position i moves to position (i + k) mod 8.

So, in order for all blue vertices after rotation to be on original red vertices, the set of blue vertices must be a subset of the original red vertices shifted by k. That is, after shifting, the blue vertices are within the original red positions.

Alternatively, the set of blue vertices is a subset of the set (Red + k), where Red is the set of original red vertices, and Red + k is the set after shifting each vertex by k positions.

But since the coloring is random, we can model this as: For the coloring C, there exists some k such that C shifted by k is a subset of the complement of C.

In other words, C is a subset of (C shifted by k)^c.

Wait, that might not be the right way to frame it. Let me try another approach.

Let me denote S as the set of blue vertices. Then, the condition is that there exists a rotation k (i.e., a shift by k positions) such that S + k is a subset of the original red vertices, which is S^c.

So, S + k ⊆ S^c.

Which implies that S and S + k are disjoint.

But S is the set of blue vertices, and S + k is the set shifted by k. So, if they are disjoint, that would mean that S and S + k don't overlap. So, S ∩ (S + k) = empty set.

But wait, in group theory terms, if S is a subset of the group (which is Z_8), then S and S + k being disjoint would imply that k is not in S - S, where S - S is the difference set.

Wait, perhaps that's complicating things. Maybe I should think in terms of necklaces or something.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model this as a constraint on the coloring. For each coloring C, we need that there exists a k such that C and C shifted by k have no overlapping blue vertices.

Wait, but isn't that similar to the coloring being a "derangement" under rotation? Or maybe not exactly, but similar in spirit.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the problem as such: the number of colorings where S and S + k are disjoint for some k.

So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of subsets S of {0,1,...,7} such that there exists a k where S ∩ (S + k) = empty.

Then, since each coloring is equally likely, the probability would be equal to the number of such subsets divided by 2^8.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets S of Z_8 such that there exists a k where S and S + k are disjoint.

Alternatively, since S is a subset, we can think of this as S being a subset that can be shifted to be disjoint from itself.

Hmm, so such subsets are called "shifted-disjoint" or something similar? Maybe not exactly, but perhaps in the context of group theory or combinatorics, there might be a term for this.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that S must be a subset such that the minimal shift k where S and S + k are disjoint is such that k is co-prime with 8? Or something along those lines.

Wait, maybe not necessarily co-prime. Let me think.

If S is a subset of Z_8, then for some k, S and S + k are disjoint. So, the shift k must be such that S ∩ (S + k) = empty.

What does that imply about S?

Well, for such a shift k, all elements of S must not be congruent modulo 8 to any element of S + k, which is equivalent to saying that for all s in S, s - k is not in S.

So, S ∩ (S - k) = empty.

Therefore, S must not contain any pair of elements differing by k.

So, in other words, S must not contain any two elements that are k apart.

So, for each k, S must be a subset with no two elements at distance k.

But we need that there exists some k where this is true.

So, the problem reduces to: count the number of subsets S of Z_8 such that there exists a k (from 1 to 7) where S does not contain any two elements differing by k.

Wait, but k is the shift, which is equivalent to the difference between elements.

So, for example, if k = 1, then S cannot contain two consecutive elements.

Similarly, if k = 2, then S cannot contain two elements with one element between them.

Wait, but in the problem, it's for any k. So, it's not that S must avoid all differences, but for some k, S avoids that difference.

So, for a given S, if there exists a k such that S does not contain any two elements differing by k, then S is acceptable.

So, our task is to count all such subsets S.

Therefore, the number of subsets S where for some k in {1,2,...,7}, the set S has no two elements differing by k.

Wait, but perhaps another way to think about it is that the minimal distance between any two elements in S is greater than k.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of forbidden differences.

So, for each k, the forbidden difference is k. So, for each k, we can count the number of subsets S that do not contain any pair differing by k, and then take the union over all k.

But since the problem is about the union over all k, we have to be careful with inclusion-exclusion.

But inclusion-exclusion might get complicated because the sets of subsets avoiding different k's can overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a formula or a generating function for this.

Wait, maybe another approach: If we fix a k, the number of subsets S avoiding difference k is equal to the number of subsets with no two elements at distance k.

This is similar to counting independent sets in a graph where edges connect elements differing by k.

In other words, for each k, the graph is a union of cycles, each cycle corresponding to the orbits under the shift by k.

So, for example, if k is co-prime with 8, then the graph is a single cycle of length 8.

But if k is not co-prime, say k = 2, then the graph is two cycles of length 4.

Similarly, k = 4 would give four cycles of length 2.

Wait, so in general, for a shift k, the graph consists of gcd(k,8) cycles, each of length 8 / gcd(k,8).

Therefore, the number of subsets S avoiding difference k is equal to the product over each cycle of (1 + 1)^{length of cycle}, since for each cycle, we can choose any subset of the cycle's vertices, but since we can't have two adjacent vertices in the cycle (since they differ by k), it's equivalent to counting independent sets on a cycle graph.

Wait, no. Actually, in our case, the graph is a cycle where edges connect elements differing by k. So, each cycle is a cycle graph where adjacency is defined by differing by k.

Therefore, the number of subsets avoiding edges (i.e., independent sets) on each cycle is equal to the number of independent sets on a cycle graph with m vertices, which is known to be F_{m} + F_{m-2} or something like that.

Wait, actually, for a cycle graph with m vertices, the number of independent sets is F_{m-1} + F_{m+1}, but I might be misremembering.

Wait, let me recall. For a path graph (not a cycle) with m vertices, the number of independent sets is F_{m+2}, where F is the Fibonacci sequence. But for a cycle, it's F_{m} + F_{m-2}.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look it up, but since I can't do that, I need to think it through.

For a cycle graph C_m, the number of independent sets is equal to the mth Lucas number, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the number of independent sets on a cycle graph C_m is equal to the number of independent sets on a path graph P_m minus the number of independent sets where both the first and last vertices are included, which would form a cycle.

Wait, maybe.

Alternatively, here's a recursive approach. Let me denote i(C_m) as the number of independent sets on cycle C_m.

Similarly, i(P_m) is the number for the path.

We know that i(P_m) = i(P_{m-1}) + i(P_{m-2}).

For the cycle, i(C_m) = i(P_m) - i(C_{m-1}).

Wait, not sure. Maybe I should consider the recurrence.

Alternatively, for a cycle, the number of independent sets is i(C_m) = i(P_m) - i(C_{m-1}).

Wait, I think that's the case, but I'm not 100% certain.

Alternatively, another way to compute it is using inclusion-exclusion.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Since for each shift k, the forbidden difference is k, and the graph is a union of cycles as I mentioned.

So, for a given shift k, the graph is made up of d cycles, each of length n = 8 / d, where d = gcd(k,8).

Therefore, the number of independent sets on each cycle is equal to the number of independent sets on a cycle graph of length n.

So, if I can compute the number of independent sets on a cycle graph of length n, then the total number of subsets S avoiding difference k is the product over each cycle of the number of independent sets on that cycle.

Wait, but in our case, the forbidden difference is k, so the graph is a union of d cycles, each of length n, and on each cycle, edges connect vertices differing by k.

Therefore, the number of independent sets on each cycle is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of the cycle such that no two adjacent vertices are chosen. Since in our case, the edges are defined by the difference k, which in the cycle corresponds to adjacency.

Therefore, for each such cycle, the number of independent sets is equal to the number of independent sets on a cycle graph of length n, which is known to be F_{n} + F_{n-2} or something similar.

Wait, let me recall that the number of independent sets on a cycle graph C_n is F_{n-1} + F_{n+1}, but I need to verify.

Wait, actually, I think for a cycle graph C_n, the number of independent sets is equal to the nth Lucas number, which is L_n.

Lucas numbers satisfy L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}, with L_1 = 1, L_2 = 3.

But let me check for small n.

For n = 1: only one vertex, so independent sets are 2: either the vertex is included or not. But wait, no, wait, independent sets on a single vertex are 2: empty set and the vertex itself. But actually, in graph theory, the number of independent sets on a single vertex is 2. For two vertices connected by an edge, the independent sets are: empty set, {1}, {2}, so 3. For a triangle (n=3), the independent sets are: empty set, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,3}. Wait, that's 5. Hmm, Lucas numbers are 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11,... So, starting from n=1: L_1=2, n=2: L_2=3, n=3: L_3=4, but wait, we have 5 independent sets for a triangle.

Wait, maybe my initial understanding is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Fibonacci sequence offset.

Wait, for a path graph P_n, the number of independent sets is F_{n+2}, where F is the Fibonacci sequence with F_1=1, F_2=1, etc.

But for a cycle graph C_n, is it F_{n} + F_{n-2}}?

Wait, let's check for n=3: C_3 is a triangle. The independent sets are: empty set, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,3}. So that's 5. If we take F_3 + F_1: F_3=2, F_1=1, so 3, which is not equal to 5. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's L_n, the Lucas numbers. Lucas numbers start as L_1=1, L_2=3, L_3=4, L_4=7, L_5=11, etc. For n=3, the number of independent sets is 5, which is not equal to L_3=4. Hmm, that doesn't match either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe it's better to compute the number of independent sets on a cycle graph manually for small n.

For C_1: just one vertex, independent sets: empty set, {v} => 2.

For C_2: two vertices connected by an edge. Independent sets: empty set, {v1}, {v2} => 3.

For C_3: triangle. Independent sets: empty set, {v1}, {v2}, {v3}, {v1, v3} => 5.

For C_4: square. Independent sets: let's see, empty set, single vertices (4), two non-adjacent vertices (2), so total 1 + 4 + 2 = 7.

Wait, but for C_4, is it 7? Let me list them:

- Empty set: 1

- Single vertices: 4

- Two non-adjacent vertices: 2 (since in a square, you can have {v1, v3} and {v2, v4})

Total: 1 + 4 + 2 = 7.

So, for C_4, it's 7.

Similarly, for C_1:2, C_2:3, C_3:5, C_4:7.

Wait, so for n=1:2, n=2:3, n=3:5, n=4:7.

This seems like starting from n=1, the number of independent sets on C_n is equal to F_{n+1} + F_{n-1}.

Wait, let's check:

For n=1: F_2 + F_0. Hmm, Fibonacci usually starts at F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, etc. So, if we take F_{n+1} + F_{n-1}:

n=1: F_2 + F_0. But F_0 is usually 0. So, 1 + 0 =1, but we have 2. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe n=1 is a special case. Let's check n=2:

F_3 + F_1 = 2 + 1 = 3, which matches.

n=3:

F_4 + F_2 = 3 + 1 = 4, but we have 5. Hmm, doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's F_{n} + F_{n-2}:

n=1: F_1 + F_{-1}? Hmm, undefined.

n=2: F_2 + F_0 =1 +0=1, which doesn't match.

n=3: F_3 + F_1=2 +1=3, which doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps it's a different recurrence.

Wait, actually, the number of independent sets on a cycle graph satisfies the recurrence:

i(C_n) = i(P_n) - i(C_{n-1}).

Wait, let me check:

For n=1: i(C_1)=2, i(P_1)=2, so 2 - i(C_0). Wait, but I don't know i(C_0). Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for independent sets on a cycle graph:

The number of independent sets on C_n is equal to i(C_n) = F_{n-1} + F_{n+1}, where F_n is the nth Fibonacci number.

Wait, let's test this:

For n=3: F_2 + F_4 =1 + 3=4, but we have 5. Hmm, doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the formula is i(C_n) = F_{n} + F_{n-2}.

For n=3: F_3 + F_1=2 +1=3≠5.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of independent sets on a cycle graph is equal to the number of independent sets on a path graph minus the number of independent sets that include both endpoints.

So, for C_n, i(C_n) = i(P_n) - i(P_{n-2}).

Let me test this:

For n=3: i(P_3)=3, i(P_1)=2, so 3 - 2=1≠5.

No, that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe another approach: for each cycle, the number of independent sets is equal to the number of subsets where no two elements are adjacent.

In a cycle, the number is equal to the number of independent sets on a path plus something.

Wait, actually, according to some references I recall, the number of independent sets on a cycle graph C_n is equal to F_{n-1} + F_{n+1}.

But let's test it:

For n=3: F_2 + F_4=1 + 3=4≠5.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute it manually for small n and see.

n=1: 2

n=2:3

n=3:5

n=4:7

n=5: ?

Wait, for C_5, the number of independent sets:

- Empty set:1

- Single vertices:5

- Two non-adjacent vertices: Let's see, in C_5, each vertex has two neighbors, so the number of ways to choose two non-adjacent vertices is 5 choose 2 minus 5 (the edges). So, 10 -5=5.

Wait, but in C_5, two vertices are non-adjacent if they are not connected by an edge. So, the number of two-element independent sets is 5.

Similarly, three-element independent sets: In C_5, can we have three non-adjacent vertices?

Yes, but only in specific ways.

Wait, actually, in C_5, the maximum independent set is 2, because if you pick three vertices, at least two will be adjacent.

Wait, no, actually, in C_5, you can have independent sets of size up to 2. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, in a cycle of 5, each vertex is connected to two others, so an independent set can't have three vertices without two being adjacent.

Wait, actually, no, that's not true. Wait, in a cycle of 5, if you pick every other vertex, you can get an independent set of size 2, but not 3.

Wait, maybe my understanding is off.

Wait, let's think of the cycle as 1-2-3-4-5-1.

An independent set cannot have two adjacent numbers.

So, for size 3, can we have {1,3,5}? Let's see: 1 is adjacent to 2 and 5, 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4, 5 is adjacent to 4 and 1. So, in {1,3,5}, 1 and 5 are adjacent, so that's not allowed.

Similarly, {1,3,4}: 3 and 4 are adjacent.

Wait, actually, in C_5, the maximum independent set is 2.

Therefore, for independent sets on C_5:

- Size 0:1

- Size1:5

- Size2:5

Total:11.

Wait, 1 +5 +5=11.

Wait, so i(C_5)=11.

Similarly, let's check the Lucas numbers: L_5=11. So, Lucas numbers: L_1=1, L_2=3, L_3=4, L_4=7, L_5=11, L_6=18, etc.

So, in this case, for n=5, the number of independent sets is 11, which is L_5.

Similarly, for n=3: L_3=4, but earlier, I found 5 independent sets.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the formula is different.

Wait, if n is the number of vertices, then for cycle graphs, the number of independent sets is L_n, but starting from n=1.

Wait, but for n=3, L_3=4, but we have 5. Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps it's another kind of number.

Wait, let's see, in the literature, the number of independent sets on a cycle graph C_n is equal to F_{n} + F_{n-2}.

Wait, for n=3: F_3 + F_1=2 +1=3≠5.

n=4: F_4 + F_2=3 +1=4≠7.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of independent sets on a cycle graph is equal to F_{n+1} + F_{n-1}.

For n=3: F_4 + F_2=3 +1=4≠5.

n=4: F_5 + F_3=5 +2=7, which matches.

n=5: F_6 + F_4=8 +3=11, which matches.

n=1: F_2 + F_0=1 +0=1≠2.

Wait, but for n=1, the formula doesn't hold. Maybe n=1 is a special case.

But for n >=2, the formula seems to hold: i(C_n) = F_{n+1} + F_{n-1}.

Wait, for n=2: F_3 + F_1=2 +1=3, which matches.

n=1: Maybe it's a special case, i(C_1)=2, while the formula gives 1.

So, perhaps the formula is valid for n >=2.

Therefore, assuming that for n >=2, the number of independent sets on C_n is F_{n+1} + F_{n-1}.

So, then, for a shift k, which gives us d = gcd(k,8) cycles, each of length n=8/d.

So, for each shift k, the number of subsets S avoiding difference k is equal to the product over each cycle of the number of independent sets on each cycle.

Since each cycle is of length n=8/d, and as per the formula, the number of independent sets on each cycle is F_{n+1} + F_{n-1} = F_{8/d +1} + F_{8/d -1}.

Therefore, the total number of subsets S avoiding difference k is (F_{(8/d)+1} + F_{(8/d)-1})^{d}.

Wait, but hold on, each cycle is independent, so the number of independent sets on the whole graph is the product of the number of independent sets on each cycle.

But since each cycle is of length n=8/d, and the number of independent sets on each cycle is F_{n+1} + F_{n-1}, then for d cycles, the total number is (F_{n+1} + F_{n-1})^{d} = (F_{(8/d)+1} + F_{(8/d)-1})^{d}.

But let me verify for specific k.

Take k=1: Then d = gcd(1,8)=1, so n=8/1=8.

Therefore, the number of independent sets on C_8 is F_{9} + F_{7}.

F_9 is 34, F_7 is 13, so 34 +13=47.

Therefore, the number of subsets S avoiding difference 1 is 47.

Similarly, for k=2: d = gcd(2,8)=2, so n=8/2=4.

Each cycle is of length 4, so number of independent sets on each C_4 is F_5 + F_3=5 +2=7.

Since there are 2 cycles, the total number is 7^2=49.

Similarly, for k=3: d = gcd(3,8)=1, so n=8, so number of subsets is 47.

k=4: d = gcd(4,8)=4, so n=2.

Each cycle is of length 2, number of independent sets on each C_2 is F_3 + F_1=2 +1=3.

Total number of subsets is 3^4=81.

k=5: same as k=3, since gcd(5,8)=1, so n=8, number of subsets is 47.

k=6: same as k=2, since gcd(6,8)=2, n=4, number of subsets is 49.

k=7: same as k=1, since gcd(7,8)=1, number of subsets is 47.

k=8: Well, shifting by 8 is the same as shifting by 0, so it's the identity. So, S must be a subset such that S and S are disjoint, which only happens if S is empty. So, number of subsets is 1.

Wait, but k=8 is equivalent to k=0, which is the identity shift. So, in that case, the condition is that S is a subset of S^c, which is always true because S and S^c are complements. So, the number of subsets is 2^8=256.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier logic, so I think I need to handle k=0 separately.

Wait, no, in our original problem, k ranges from 0 to7, but shifting by 0 is the identity. So, when k=0, the condition is that all blue vertices are at positions where the original red vertices are. But since the octagon is being rotated, shifting by 0 doesn't change the coloring. So, the condition is trivially satisfied for any coloring, because shifting by 0 doesn't change anything.

Wait, but the problem says "the octagon can be rotated so that...", so k=0 is actually allowed, but it doesn't impose any condition except the trivial one. So, for k=0, all colorings satisfy the condition, so the number of subsets S is 2^8=256.

But wait, in our previous calculations, for k=1,2,...,7, we had different counts, but for k=0, it's 256.

So, in total, the number of subsets S that satisfy S ⊆ (S +k)^c for some k in {0,1,2,...,7} is equal to:

Number for k=0:256

Plus the numbers for k=1,2,...,7: but we have to be careful not to double-count subsets that satisfy the condition for multiple k.

Wait, but the problem is to count the number of subsets S for which there exists a k such that S ⊆ (S +k)^c. So, the union over all k of the subsets S that satisfy S ⊆ (S +k)^c.

Therefore, the total number is equal to the union of N_k, where N_k is the set of subsets S such that S ⊆ (S +k)^c.

So, to compute |Union N_k|, we can use inclusion-exclusion:

|Union N_k| = sum |N_k| - sum |N_k ∩ N_j| + sum |N_k ∩ N_j ∩ N_m| - ... + (-1)^{m+1}|N_0 ∩ N_1 ∩ ... ∩ N_7}|.

But this seems complicated, as we have 8 sets to consider, and their intersections.

But perhaps there is a smarter way.

Wait, notice that for k=0, N_0 is all subsets, which is 256.

For k=1 to7, N_k is the subsets S avoiding difference k, which we've computed as 47,49,47,81,47,49,47.

But the problem is that these sets overlap. So, for example, a subset S that avoids both differences 1 and 2 would be counted in both N_1 and N_2.

Therefore, inclusion-exclusion is necessary.

But with 8 sets, inclusion-exclusion would be quite involved.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a generating function or some other combinatorial construct.

Wait, an alternative approach: think of each coloring as a binary string of length 8, with each bit indicating red or blue.

We need to count the number of binary strings such that there exists a rotation k where the blue bits are all in positions that were originally red.

In other words, for some k, the blue bits are a subset of the red bits rotated by k.

Which is equivalent to saying that the blue bits are a subset of the union of the red bits under rotation by k.

Wait, perhaps another way: for a given coloring, the set of blue vertices must be a subset of some rotated version of the red vertices.

So, the red vertices form a set R, and the blue vertices B must be a subset of some rotation of R.

Therefore, the condition is that B is a subset of R +k for some k.

So, to rephrase, for a given R, if we can find a k such that B is a subset of R +k.

Which is the same as saying that the symmetric difference R Δ B is equal to B, since B is a subset of R +k, which is a shift of R.

Wait, not sure.

Wait, but let me think of the problem as: for a given coloring, is the set of blue vertices a subset of some rotated version of the red vertices.

Therefore, the number of colorings where B is a subset of some rotation of R.

So, in other words, for each coloring, check if B is a subset of R +k for some k.

Now, the problem is to count how many such colorings exist.

So, perhaps an alternate approach is to count the number of pairs (R, B) where B is a subset of R +k for some k, where R and B are complements.

Alternatively, since R and B are complements, R = S^c where S=B.

So, for each subset S, check if S is a subset of (S^c) +k for some k.

Which is equivalent to S being a subset of (S^c +k), which is equivalent to S ∩ (S^c +k) = S.

Which is equivalent to S being a subset of (S +k)^c.

Which is exactly the condition we had before.

So, back to square one.

So, perhaps the best way is to compute the total number via inclusion-exclusion.

But the problem is that 8 is a manageable number, but still, inclusion-exclusion up to 8 terms is going to be difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that the total number is equal to the sum over k=0 to7 of |N_k| minus the sum over i < j of |N_i ∩ N_j| plus the sum over i < j < l of |N_i ∩ N_j ∩ N_l}|, etc.

But computing all these terms is going to be a lot.

Alternatively, since each N_k is a set of subsets S that avoid difference k, and the intersections N_k ∩ N_j are subsets S that avoid both differences k and j, which is equivalent to subsets S that avoid differences k and j.

Therefore, perhaps we can compute for each d, the number of subsets S that avoid differences corresponding to a set of shifts.

But I need to think about how the shifts relate in terms of their gcd.

Wait, perhaps we can instead think in terms of the minimal periods.

Wait, another thought: For a subset S, if it is periodic with some period d, then it avoids shifts of size d.

So, for example, if S is periodic with period d, then shifting by d leaves S invariant.

But in our case, we are looking for S that is a subset of (S^c +k) for some k, which is equivalent to S ∩ (S^c +k) = empty.

Which is equivalent to S being a subset of (S +k)^c, as before.

Wait, another idea: If S is such that S is a subset of (S +k)^c, then S is a subset of the complement of S +k.

Which is equivalent to S +k is a subset of S^c.

But S +k is a subset of S^c.

So, S +k is a subset of S^c.

Which is equivalent to saying that (S +k) ∩ S = empty.

Which is equivalent to S and S +k being disjoint.

Which is equivalent to the condition that S is a union of some cycles under the shift by k.

Wait, maybe.

Wait, but if S and S +k are disjoint, then S is a subset of (S +k)^c.

So, the condition is that S is a subset of (S +k)^c, which is equivalent to S and S +k being disjoint.

So, for a given k, the number of subsets S where S and S +k are disjoint is equal to the number of independent sets on the graph where edges connect elements differing by k.

Which is similar to what I thought earlier.

So, perhaps the number of such subsets is 2^{c}, where c is the number of connected components in the graph.

But in our case, the graph is a union of cycles, each of length n=8/d, where d = gcd(k,8).

Each cycle is a set of vertices where each is connected to the next via the shift k.

Therefore, the number of connected components is d.

Therefore, the number of subsets S where S and S +k are disjoint is 2^{d}.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, if you have a graph that is a union of d cycles, each of length 8/d, then the number of independent sets is equal to (number of independent sets on each cycle)^d.

Earlier, we had that for each cycle of length n=8/d, the number of independent sets is F_{n+1} + F_{n-1}.

But that seems complicated.

But wait, perhaps for each cycle of length n, the number of independent sets where S and S +k are disjoint is 2.

Wait, that might not be correct.

Wait, for a cycle of length n, the number of subsets S such that S and S +k are disjoint is equal to 2, because you can choose S to be the set of all vertices in even positions or odd positions, which are invariant under shifting by k.

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, for a single cycle of length n, the number of subsets S where S and S +k are disjoint is equal to the number of subsets S that are unions of independent sets on the cycle graph.

But in this case, since the graph is a cycle, the number of such subsets S is equal to the number of independent sets on the cycle graph, which is the Lucas number.

Wait, but earlier, we saw that for n=3, it was 5, not 2.

Wait, perhaps my previous thought was wrong.

Wait, perhaps if the graph is a cycle, then the number of subsets S such that S and S +k are disjoint is equal to the number of independent sets on the cycle graph, which is L_n.

But in our case, for each cycle, the number is L_{n}, where n is the length of the cycle.

Therefore, for each shift k, the number of subsets S where S and S +k are disjoint is equal to product over each cycle of L_n, where n=8/d and d=gcd(k,8).

Wait, but in that case, for k=1, the number would be L_8=47.

Which matches our previous calculation.

Wait, but if I have d cycles, each of length n=8/d, then the number of subsets S where S and S +k are disjoint is equal to (L_n)^d.

But that seems too large.

Wait, for example, when k=2, d=2, n=4, so L_4=7.

Thus, number of subsets would be 7^2=49, which matches our earlier number.

Similarly, for k=4, d=4, n=2, L_2=3, so 3^4=81.

Therefore, the formula seems to hold.

Therefore, for each shift k, the number of subsets S such that S and S +k are disjoint is equal to (L_{n})^{d}, where n=8/d and d=gcd(k,8).

Wait, but hold on, for k=0, which is the identity shift, the number of subsets S where S and S +0 are disjoint is the number of subsets S that are subsets of S^c, which only occurs when S is empty.

Therefore, for k=0, the number of such subsets S is 1, not (L_8)^1=47.

Therefore, the formula only applies for k>=1.

So, in summary, for each k from 1 to7, the number of subsets S where S and S +k are disjoint is equal to (L_{n})^{d}, where n=8/d and d=gcd(k,8).

Therefore, the total number of subsets S that satisfy the condition for some k is equal to the sum over k=1 to7 of (L_{8/d})^d, where d=gcd(k,8), minus the intersections.

But this is still complicated.

Wait, but since we're dealing with inclusion-exclusion, perhaps another approach is to note that the total number is equal to the sum over d|8 of μ(d) * 2^{8/d}, where μ is the Möbius function.

Wait, that might be related to the necklace problem or something similar.

Wait, actually, the number of aperiodic necklaces is given by Möbius inversion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the number of subsets S such that S is aperiodic modulo d is equal to something with Möbius function.

But perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, considering that the problem is about rotational symmetry, perhaps we can use Burnside's lemma.

Wait, Burnside's lemma is used to count distinct necklaces under group actions, but I'm not sure if it's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps think about the problem probabilistically.

Wait, the total number of colorings is 2^8.

The number of colorings where the blue vertices can be rotated to lie on the original red vertices is equal to the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of a subset of the red set.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think of the problem as counting the number of colorings where the blue vertices form a subset that is a rotation of some subset of red vertices.

Therefore, for each rotation k, the number of colorings where B is a subset of R +k.

So, for each k, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of pairs (R, B) where B is a subset of R +k.

But B is the complement of R, so this is equivalent to R being a subset of (B +k).

Wait, but R is the complement of B, so R = B^c.

Therefore, B is a subset of (B^c +k). Which is the same as saying B ∩ (B^c +k) = B.

Which is equivalent to B being a subset of (B^c +k).

Which is equivalent to (B^c +k) covering all of B.

Which is equivalent to B being a subset of (B^c +k).

Which is equivalent to B ∩ (B^c +k) = B.

Which is equivalent to B being a subset of the union of (B^c +k).

Which is always true, since B is a subset of the union of all its translates.

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps another way.

Each coloring can be represented as a binary string of length 8, with 0s and 1s.

We need to count the number of binary strings where there exists a rotation such that all the 1s in the string are contained within some rotation of the 0s.

Wait, that is, the string can be rotated so that all the 1s are on top of the 0s.

Which is equivalent to saying that the 1s are a subset of the 0s rotated by some k.

So, in terms of the binary string, the 1s must lie entirely within some rotation of the 0s.

Therefore, the binary string must have all its 1s contained within a single block of 0s when the string is rotated appropriately.

But since the string is circular, the 1s must lie within a single run of 0s when considering the string as circular.

Wait, if all the 1s are contained within a run of 0s, then rotating the string so that this run is aligned with the original string would make the 1s lie on top of the 0s.

Therefore, the condition is equivalent to the binary string having all its 1s lying within a single run of 0s when considered circularly.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of binary necklaces with all 1s contained within a single run of 0s.

Therefore, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of binary necklaces where all the 1s are consecutive when the necklace is considered circular.

Wait, that's a helpful rephrasing.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of binary necklaces of length 8 where all the 1s are contained within a single run.

Which is equivalent to counting the number of binary necklaces where the 1s form a single contiguous block, possibly wrapping around the end.

In combinatorics, such necklaces are called "consecutive" or "single block" necklaces.

The number of such necklaces can be calculated using the formula for binary necklaces with a single block of ones.

Wait, for a binary necklace of length n with exactly m ones, all consecutive, the number is equal to n divided by the number of rotational symmetries.

Wait, but in our case, the number of ones can vary.

Wait, actually, for each number of ones, say m, from 0 to8, we can count the number of necklaces with exactly m ones, all consecutive.

Then, sum over m=0 to8.

But for each m, the number of such necklaces is equal to the number of ways to place a block of m consecutive 1s on a circle of length 8, divided by 8 for rotational symmetry.

Wait, no, actually, the number of distinct necklaces with exactly m consecutive 1s is equal to 8 for each m, unless m=0 or8, in which case it's 1.

Wait, no, for m=0, all zeros: 1 necklace.

For m=1: choosing any single position, but in a necklace, all single 1s are equivalent under rotation. So, only 1 distinct necklace.

Similarly, for m=2: the number of distinct necklaces with two consecutive 1s is 1, because any two consecutive 1s can be rotated to any other two consecutive positions.

Wait, actually, no.

Wait, for m=2, the number of distinct necklaces with exactly two consecutive 1s is 8 divided by the number of symmetries, but I think it's equal to the number of orbits under rotation.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of distinct necklaces, which is equal to the number of ways to place the block of 1s, considering rotations.

So, for m=1: 1 necklace.

For m=2: 1 necklace, since all two consecutive 1s are equivalent under rotation.

Similarly, for m=3: 1 necklace.

Wait, but that can't be, because for m=4, you can have two blocks of two 1s, but in our case, all 1s must be consecutive.

Wait, no, in our problem, all 1s must be consecutive, so for each m, the number of necklaces is 1 if m=0,1,2,...,8, except when m=0 and m=8, which are both 1.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, actually, for each m from 1 to7, the number of necklaces with exactly m consecutive 1s is equal to 1, because all such necklaces are rotationally symmetric.

But that can't be, because for m=4, you can have the block starting at position 1,2,3,4, but under rotation, they are all equivalent.

Wait, actually, for m=4, in a necklace of 8, the number of distinct necklaces with a block of 4 consecutive 1s is 2: one where the 1s are in a block of 4, and one where the 1s are in a block of 4, but the necklace is flipped, but since we are dealing with necklaces (which consider rotations and reflections as equivalent), actually, no, in standard necklace counting, we only consider rotations, not reflections.

Wait, no, in our case, we only have rotations, not reflections, since the octagon is fixed in space.

Wait, no, in our problem, we are only considering rotational shifts to align the blue vertices over red vertices, so reflections aren't considered.

Therefore, in our problem, we only need to consider rotational shifts, not reflections.

Therefore, for our purposes, necklaces are considered up to rotation, but not reflection.

Therefore, for m=4, the number of distinct necklaces with a block of 4 consecutive 1s is equal to 1, since all such blocks are equivalent under rotation.

Wait, but in reality, when m=4, in a necklace of 8, the number of distinct necklaces with a block of 4 consecutive 1s is equal to 1, because you can rotate the necklace so that the block of 1s starts at any position.

Therefore, for each m, the number of such necklaces is 1, except for m=0 and m=8.

So, the total number of necklaces would be 9 (from m=0 to8).

But that can't be, because the total number of colorings is 256, which is 2^8=256, and if we have 9 necklaces, each accounting for multiple colorings, then it must be more.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, actually, each necklace with m ones corresponds to multiple colorings, depending on the symmetries.

Wait, no, actually, for each m, the number of distinct necklaces with exactly m consecutive 1s is equal to 1, but each necklace corresponds to multiple binary strings.

For example, for m=1, the necklace with one 1 corresponds to 8 different binary strings, since the single 1 can be in any of the 8 positions.

Similarly, for m=2, the necklace with two consecutive 1s corresponds to 8 different binary strings, since the block can start at any of the 8 positions.

Wait, but no, actually, in the case of necklaces, if we consider rotational symmetry, then for m=1, the number of necklaces is 1, but the number of binary strings is 8.

Similarly, for m=2, the number of necklaces is 1, but the number of binary strings is 8.

Wait, but in our problem, we need to count the number of binary strings, not the number of necklaces.

Therefore, for each m, the number of binary strings with exactly m consecutive 1s is equal to 8, unless m=0 or8, where it's 1.

Therefore, the total number of binary strings where all the 1s are consecutive is equal to sum_{m=0}^8 8, except for m=0 and8, which contribute 1 each.

Wait, no, actually, for each m from1 to7, we have 8 strings, and for m=0 and8, we have 1 string each.

So, total number is 2*1 + 7*8=2 +56=58.

Wait, but 58 is much less than 256, which is the total number of colorings.

But in our problem, we need to count the number of colorings where there exists a rotation k such that all blue vertices (1s) are contained within some rotation of the red vertices (0s). Which, as we saw earlier, is equivalent to the blue vertices forming a single consecutive block, possibly wrapping around.

Therefore, the number of such colorings is 58.

Wait, but 58 seems low, but let's think.

Each m from1 to7, contributes 8 strings, which are the ones with m consecutive 1s, each rotated to different positions.

Therefore, for m=1, 8 strings: each with a single 1.

For m=2, 8 strings: each with two consecutive 1s.

Similarly up to m=7, 8 strings each.

Plus, the all-0s and all-1s strings, which are 1 each.

So, 2 + 7*8=58.

Therefore, the number of such colorings is 58.

Wait, but 58 is the number of binary strings where all 1s are consecutive.

But the problem is about colorings where the blue vertices can be rotated to lie on the original red vertices.

Which is equivalent to the blue vertices forming a single consecutive block in some rotation.

Therefore, the number of colorings is 58.

Therefore, the probability is 58/256.

Simplify that: divide numerator and denominator by 2:29/128.

Therefore, m=29, n=128, which are coprime.

Therefore, m + n=29 +128=157.

Therefore, the answer is 157.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{157}
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that an octagon with each vertex independently colored red or blue can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. 

First, we note that the total number of colorings of the octagon is \(2^8 = 256\).

We need to count the number of colorings where the blue vertices can be rotated to lie on the original red vertices. This is equivalent to counting the number of binary strings (colorings) where all the 1s (blue vertices) form a single consecutive block, possibly wrapping around the octagon.

For each number of blue vertices \(m\) (from 0 to 8), we consider the number of distinct binary strings where all 1s are consecutive. 

- For \(m = 0\) (all red), there is 1 string.
- For \(m = 8\) (all blue), there is 1 string.
- For each \(m\) from 1 to 7, there are 8 distinct binary strings where the 1s form a single consecutive block.

Thus, the total number of such colorings is:
- 2 strings for \(m = 0\) and \(m = 8\)
- 8 strings for each \(m\) from 1 to 7, giving \(7 \times 8 = 56\) strings

Adding these together, we get \(2 + 56 = 58\) valid colorings.

The probability is therefore \(\frac{58}{256}\). Simplifying this fraction, we get \(\frac{29}{128}\).

Thus, \(m = 29\) and \(n = 128\), and their sum is \(29 + 128 = 157\).

\[
\boxed{157}
\]
