Correct Answer:
We have $\angle BCD = \angle CBD = \angle A$ from the tangency condition. With LoC we have $\cos(A) = \frac{25+100-81}{2*5*10} = \frac{11}{25}$ and $\cos(B) = \frac{81+25-100}{2*9*5} = \frac{1}{15}$. Then, $CD = \frac{\frac{9}{2}}{\cos(A)} = \frac{225}{22}$. Using LoC we can find $AD$: $AD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2 - 2(AC)(CD)\cos(A+C) = 10^2+(\frac{225}{22})^2 + 2(10)\frac{225}{22}\cos(B) = 100 + \frac{225^2}{22^2} + 2(10)\frac{225}{22}*\frac{1}{15} = \frac{5^4*13^2}{484}$. Thus, $AD = \frac{5^2*13}{22}$. By Power of a Point, $DP*AD = CD^2$ so $DP*\frac{5^2*13}{22} = (\frac{225}{22})^2$ which gives $DP = \frac{5^2*9^2}{13*22}$. Finally, we have $AP = AD - DP = \frac{5^2*13}{22} - \frac{5^2*9^2}{13*22} = \frac{100}{13}$. So the answer is $\boxed{113}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

We have a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. That means ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We are given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then compute m + n.

Okay, so first, let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Since these are just lengths, I can maybe figure out some other properties, like angles or other lengths, if needed. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Since tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length, BD should equal CD, right? So BD = CD. That might come in handy.

Then, AD is drawn and it intersects the circle again at P. So AP is the length from A to P, which is along the secant AD. 

I remember that when a secant and a tangent intersect outside a circle, there's a power of a point theorem which relates the lengths. Specifically, the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC², which should also be equal to DP * DA. Wait, is that correct?

Yes, power of a point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC², and since D lies outside the circle, the power is also equal to DP * DA. So we can write:

DB² = DP * DA

But since BD and CD are equal, this simplifies the equation. But do we know DB? Maybe not directly, but perhaps we can find it using some other properties.

Alternatively, maybe we can use similar triangles or some properties of harmonic division or projective geometry, but that might be more advanced.

Wait, let me think. Since ABC is inscribed in ω, and BD and CD are tangents, point D is the ex-pole or something? Maybe not, but perhaps I can use properties of triangle ABC and point D.

Another idea: Maybe we can use coordinates or trigonometry. Hmm, setting up coordinates might be a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, maybe using inversion. Inversion is powerful in problems involving circles and tangents. But I think that might be a bit heavy for this problem.

Wait, let me see. Let me recall that AD is a secant, so by the power of a point, DP * DA = DB². So if I can find DB, then I can find DP, and hence AP since DA is known.

But how do I find DB? Hmm.

Wait, alternatively, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the exsymmedian point or something related to the triangle. Maybe I can use some properties related to symmedians.

Alternatively, perhaps using triangle similarity. Let me recall that the tangent at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, if O is the center of ω, then OB is perpendicular to BD, and OC is perpendicular to CD. Therefore, triangles OBD and OCD are right-angled at B and C, respectively.

So, maybe quadrilateral OBDC is a kite, since OB = OC (radii) and BD = CD (tangents from D). Wait, but in this case, BD = CD, but OB and OC are equal as radii, but OB is not necessarily equal to BD or CD.

Wait, maybe I can find the lengths of OD, BD, and CD if I can find the radius of the circle ω.

Yes, that might be a good approach. Let me compute the radius of ω first.

Given triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, using the circumradius formula:

R = (a * b * c) / (4 * Δ)

where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area.

So, first, let's compute the area Δ of triangle ABC using Heron's formula.

The semi-perimeter, s, is (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, Δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12(12 - 5)(12 - 9)(12 - 10)] = sqrt[12 * 7 * 3 * 2] = sqrt[12 * 7 * 6] = sqrt[504]

Simplify sqrt[504]: 504 = 16 * 31.5, wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but that's not an integer. Let me factor 504: 504 = 16 * 31.5 is incorrect.

Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5? Wait, 16 * 31 is 496, so 504 - 496 is 8, so 504 = 16*31 + 8, which is 16*31.5. Hmm, perhaps a different factorization.

504 = 72 * 7 = 9 * 8 * 7. So sqrt[504] = sqrt[9 * 8 * 7] = 3 * sqrt[56] = 3 * sqrt[4*14] = 3 * 2 * sqrt[14] = 6 * sqrt[14].

Wait, let me check that: 6 * sqrt[14] is 6 * 3.7417 ≈ 22.45, but sqrt[504] is approximately sqrt[504] ≈ 22.45, so that seems correct.

So area Δ = 6 * sqrt[14].

Then, the circumradius R is (5 * 9 * 10) / (4 * 6 * sqrt[14]) = (450) / (24 * sqrt[14]) = (75) / (4 * sqrt[14)).

Rationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt[14]:

R = (75 * sqrt[14)) / (4 * 14) = (75 * sqrt[14)) / 56.

So R = (75/56) * sqrt[14).

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 5 * 9 * 10 is 450. 4 * Δ is 4 * 6 * sqrt(14) = 24 * sqrt(14). So 450 / (24 * sqrt(14)) simplifies to 75 / (4 * sqrt(14)).

Yes, that's correct. So R = 75 / (4 * sqrt(14)).

But let me rationalize it:

75 / (4 * sqrt(14)) = (75 * sqrt(14)) / (4 * 14) = (75 * sqrt(14)) / 56.

Yes, so R = (75√14)/56.

Okay, so now we have the radius. Maybe we can find the distance from D to the center O, and then use power of a point.

Wait, D is the point where the two tangents meet. So, the distance from D to O can be found using the formula for the distance from an external point to the center of a circle, given the length of the tangent.

We know that if a tangent is drawn from D to ω, then the length of the tangent squared is equal to OD² - R².

So, if we can compute OD, then DB² = OD² - R².

But how do we compute OD? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe we can use some properties of triangle ABC and point D.

Wait, maybe using coordinates. Let me consider placing triangle ABC in coordinate plane to compute coordinates of D and then find AD.

Given that, let me attempt to set up coordinate system.

Let me place point B at (0, 0), point C at (9, 0), since BC=9. Then, point A is somewhere in the plane; given AB=5 and AC=10, we can find coordinates of A.

So, coordinates:

Let me denote:

Point B: (0, 0)

Point C: (9, 0)

Point A: (x, y), which we need to find.

Given that AB=5, AC=10. So, distance from A to B is 5:

sqrt[(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 5 => x² + y² = 25.

Distance from A to C is 10:

sqrt[(x - 9)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 10 => (x - 9)^2 + y² = 100.

Subtract first equation from second:

(x - 9)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) = 100 - 25 => (x² - 18x + 81) + y² - x² - y² = 75 => -18x + 81 = 75 => -18x = -6 => x = (-6)/(-18) = 1/3.

So x = 1/3.

Then, plugging back into x² + y² =25:

(1/3)^2 + y² = 25 => 1/9 + y² = 25 => y² = 25 - 1/9 = 225/9 - 1/9 = 224/9 => y = sqrt(224/9) = (sqrt(224))/3 = (sqrt(16*14))/3 = (4√14)/3.

So point A is at (1/3, (4√14)/3).

Therefore, coordinates:

A: (1/3, 4√14/3)

B: (0, 0)

C: (9, 0)

Now, we need to find the point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.

The tangent at B to the circumcircle ω. Since ω is the circumcircle of ABC, we can find its equation.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the equations of the tangents at B and C.

First, let me find the equation of the circumcircle ω.

We have three points: A(1/3, 4√14/3), B(0,0), C(9,0). Let me find the equation of the circle passing through these points.

General equation of a circle: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0.

Since it passes through B(0,0):

0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.

So equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey = 0.

Now, plug in point C(9,0):

9² + 0² + D*9 + E*0 = 0 => 81 + 9D = 0 => 9D = -81 => D = -9.

So now equation is x² + y² - 9x + Ey = 0.

Plug in point A(1/3, 4√14/3):

(1/3)^2 + (4√14/3)^2 - 9*(1/3) + E*(4√14/3) = 0.

Compute each term:

(1/3)^2 = 1/9

(4√14/3)^2 = 16*14 / 9 = 224/9

-9*(1/3) = -3

So adding these: 1/9 + 224/9 - 3 = (225)/9 - 3 = 25 - 3 = 22.

Then, plus E*(4√14/3) = 0.

So 22 + (4√14/3) E = 0 => (4√14/3) E = -22 => E = (-22 * 3)/(4√14) = (-66)/(4√14) = (-33)/(2√14).

Rationalize denominator:

E = (-33)/(2√14) * (√14/√14) = (-33√14)/(28).

So E = (-33√14)/28.

Therefore, the equation of ω is:

x² + y² - 9x + [(-33√14)/28] y = 0.

Okay, that's the equation of the circle. Now, we need the equations of the tangents at B and C.

The tangent at a point on the circle can be found using the derivative or using the formula that the tangent at (x₀, y₀) is xx₀ + yy₀ + D*(x + x₀)/2 + E*(y + y₀)/2 + F = 0. Wait, maybe it's better to compute the derivative.

Alternatively, the tangent at point (x₀, y₀) on the circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0 is given by:

x x₀ + y y₀ + (D/2)(x + x₀) + (E/2)(y + y₀) + F = 0.

Yes, that's the equation. So, let's use that.

First, tangent at B(0,0):

Plug into the tangent formula:

x*0 + y*0 + (-9/2)(x + 0) + (E/2)(y + 0) + 0 = 0

Simplify:

0 + 0 - (9/2)x + (E/2)y = 0

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:

-9x + E y = 0

We have E = (-33√14)/28, so:

-9x + [(-33√14)/28] y = 0

Multiply both sides by 28 to eliminate denominators:

-252x - 33√14 y = 0

Which can be written as:

252x + 33√14 y = 0

Simplify by dividing by 3:

84x + 11√14 y = 0

So that's the equation of tangent at B.

Similarly, tangent at C(9, 0):

Using the tangent formula:

x*9 + y*0 + (-9/2)(x + 9) + (E/2)(y + 0) + 0 = 0

Simplify:

9x + 0 - (9/2)x - (81)/2 + (E/2)y = 0

Combine like terms:

(9x - (9/2)x) + (E/2)y - 81/2 = 0

Compute 9x - 4.5x = 4.5x

So:

4.5x + (E/2)y - 81/2 = 0

Convert 4.5 to fraction: 9/2

So:

(9/2)x + (E/2)y - 81/2 = 0

Multiply both sides by 2:

9x + E y - 81 = 0

Again, E = (-33√14)/28:

9x + [(-33√14)/28] y - 81 = 0

Multiply both sides by 28:

252x - 33√14 y - 2268 = 0

Simplify:

252x - 33√14 y = 2268

We can divide both sides by 3:

84x - 11√14 y = 756

So tangent at C is 84x - 11√14 y = 756.

Now, we have equations of tangent at B: 84x + 11√14 y = 0

and tangent at C: 84x - 11√14 y = 756

We need to find their intersection point D.

Let me write the two equations:

1) 84x + 11√14 y = 0

2) 84x - 11√14 y = 756

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(84x - 11√14 y) - (84x + 11√14 y) = 756 - 0

Simplify:

84x - 11√14 y -84x -11√14 y = 756

So:

-22√14 y = 756

Thus:

y = 756 / (-22√14) = -756 / (22√14)

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 2:

-378 / (11√14)

Rationalize denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

-378√14 / (11 * 14) = (-378√14)/154

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 14:

-27√14 / 11

Wait, 378 ÷14=27, and 154 ÷14=11.

So y = (-27√14)/11.

Now, plug this back into equation 1 to find x:

84x + 11√14 y = 0

So 84x + 11√14*(-27√14/11) = 0

Simplify:

84x - (11√14 *27√14)/11 = 0

Simplify the second term:

(11/11)*(√14*√14)*27 = 1*14*27 = 378

Thus:

84x - 378 = 0 => 84x = 378 => x = 378 / 84.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 42:

378 ÷42=9, 84 ÷42=2. So x=9/2.

Therefore, point D has coordinates (9/2, (-27√14)/11).

So D is at (4.5, approx -27*3.7417/11 ≈ -9.13).

So now, we have point A at (1/3, 4√14/3) and point D at (9/2, -27√14/11).

We need to find the equation of line AD, then find its other intersection point P with the circumcircle ω, and then compute AP.

So first, let me compute the parametric equations or the slope-intercept form of line AD.

First, let me compute the slope of AD.

Slope m = (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) = [(-27√14/11 - 4√14/3)] / [9/2 - 1/3].

Compute numerator:

-27√14/11 - 4√14/3 = (-27*3√14 - 4*11√14)/33 = (-81√14 -44√14)/33 = (-125√14)/33.

Denominator:

9/2 -1/3 = (27/6 - 2/6) = 25/6.

So slope m = (-125√14 /33) / (25/6) = (-125√14 /33) * (6/25) = (-125 *6√14)/(33*25).

Simplify:

125 ÷25=5, 6 ÷3=2, 33 ÷3=11.

So m = (-5 * 2√14)/11 = (-10√14)/11.

So slope m = -10√14 /11.

Now, we can write the equation of AD.

Using point A: (1/3, 4√14/3). So, equation is:

y - 4√14/3 = m(x - 1/3) = (-10√14/11)(x -1/3)

So, y = (-10√14/11)(x -1/3) + 4√14/3.

Let me write this in terms of fractions to make it easier.

Multiply through:

y = (-10√14/11)x + (10√14/11)(1/3) + 4√14/3

Simplify:

= (-10√14/11)x + (10√14)/33 + (44√14)/33

= (-10√14/11)x + (54√14)/33

Simplify (54√14)/33: divide numerator and denominator by 3: 18√14/11.

So equation of AD: y = (-10√14/11)x + 18√14/11.

Now, we need to find point P where this line intersects ω again. Since A is already on both AD and ω, P is the other intersection.

We can solve the system of equations:

1) y = (-10√14/11)x + 18√14/11

2) x² + y² -9x + Ey = 0, where E is (-33√14)/28, but let's use the equation we had earlier.

Wait, let me recall that the equation of ω is x² + y² -9x + Ey = 0, where E = (-33√14)/28. So plugging in y from equation 1 into equation 2.

So substitute y into equation 2:

x² + [(-10√14/11 x + 18√14/11)]² -9x + E[(-10√14/11 x + 18√14/11)] = 0.

This seems messy, but let's proceed step by step.

First, compute [(-10√14/11 x + 18√14/11)]²:

Let me denote this expression as (a x + b)^2, where a = -10√14/11, b = 18√14/11.

So square is a²x² + 2abx + b².

Compute a²: (100*14)/121 = 1400/121.

2ab: 2*(-10√14/11)(18√14/11) = 2*(-180*14)/121 = (-5040)/121.

b²: (324*14)/121 = 4536/121.

So [(-10√14/11 x + 18√14/11)]² = (1400/121)x² - (5040/121)x + 4536/121.

Now, plug this back into equation 2:

x² + [1400/121 x² - 5040/121 x + 4536/121] -9x + E*(-10√14/11 x + 18√14/11) = 0.

Simplify term by term:

First term: x².

Second term: 1400/121 x² - 5040/121 x + 4536/121.

Third term: -9x.

Fourth term: E*(-10√14/11 x + 18√14/11).

Let me compute E*(-10√14/11 x + 18√14/11):

E = (-33√14)/28.

So:

(-33√14)/28 * (-10√14/11 x) + (-33√14)/28 * (18√14/11)

Compute each part:

First part: [(-33√14)/28] * [(-10√14)/11 x] = [33*10*(√14)^2]/(28*11) x = [330*14]/(308) x = 4620/308 x.

Simplify 4620 ÷ 4 = 1155, 308 ÷4=77. So 1155/77 x. 1155 ÷7=165, 77 ÷7=11. So 165/11 x = 15x.

Second part: [(-33√14)/28] * [18√14/11] = (-33*18*(√14)^2)/(28*11) = (-594*14)/(308).

Compute 594 ÷2=297, 308 ÷2=154.

297/154: Let me see if they can be reduced. 297 ÷11=27, 154 ÷11=14. So 27/14.

Thus, (-297*14)/154 = (-297)/11 = -27.

Wait, let me redo that step.

Wait, the second part is (-33√14)/28 * (18√14)/11.

Multiply constants: (-33 *18)/(28*11) = (-594)/308.

Multiply √14 * √14 =14.

So overall: (-594/308)*14 = (-594*14)/308.

Simplify 14/308 = 1/22. So (-594)/22 = -27.

Therefore, the fourth term is 15x -27.

Putting all together, equation becomes:

x² + [1400/121 x² - 5040/121 x + 4536/121] -9x +15x -27 = 0.

Combine like terms:

x² + 1400/121 x²: (1 + 1400/121) x² = (121/121 + 1400/121) x² = 1521/121 x².

Next, -5040/121 x -9x +15x: Combine the x terms.

-5040/121 x + ( -9x +15x ) = -5040/121 x +6x.

Convert 6x to 726/121 x (since 6=726/121). So:

-5040/121 x +726/121 x = (-5040 +726)/121 x = (-4314)/121 x.

Then, constants: 4536/121 -27.

Compute 4536/121 -27: 27 = 3267/121. So 4536/121 -3267/121 = (4536 -3267)/121 = 1269/121.

So overall, the equation becomes:

1521/121 x² - 4314/121 x + 1269/121 = 0.

Multiply both sides by 121 to eliminate denominators:

1521x² - 4314x + 1269 = 0.

Simplify the equation:

Let me see if we can factor out a common factor. 1521, 4314, 1269.

1521 ÷3=507, 4314 ÷3=1438, 1269 ÷3=423.

So divide equation by 3:

507x² -1438x +423=0.

Check if further factorable.

507 and 423: 507 ÷3=169, 423 ÷3=141.

Wait, 507=3*13², 423=3*141=3*3*47.

So perhaps factor as:

Looking for factors of 507*423 that add up to 1438. Hmm, this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, use quadratic formula.

Quadratic equation: 507x² -1438x +423 =0.

Compute discriminant D = b² -4ac = (1438)^2 -4*507*423.

Compute 1438²: 1438*1438. Let me compute 1400²=1,960,000, 38²=1,444, and cross term 2*1400*38=106,400.

So 1,960,000 +106,400 +1,444= 2,067,844.

Then, compute 4ac=4*507*423.

Compute 507*423: Let's compute 500*423=211,500, 7*423=2,961, so total 211,500 +2,961=214,461.

Then, 4ac=4*214,461=857,844.

So D=2,067,844 -857,844=1,210,000.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(1,210,000)=1,100.

Thus, solutions x = [1438 ±1100]/(2*507).

Compute numerator:

First solution:1438 +1100=2538, x=2538/(2*507)=2538/1014.

Simplify: 2538 ÷6=423, 1014 ÷6=169. So 423/169.

Second solution:1438 -1100=338, x=338/(1014)=169/507=13/39.

So x=423/169 and x=13/39.

We know that x=1/3 is the x-coordinate of point A. Let me check if 423/169 is approximately 2.5, which is more than 1/3, and 13/39≈0.333, which is 1/3. So point A has x=1/3, so when x=13/39, which is 1/3*13/13=1/3, wait, 13/39=1/3. So wait, 13/39=1/3. So x=1/3 is one solution, which is point A, and x=423/169≈2.51 is point P.

Thus, x-coordinate of P is 423/169.

Now, let me compute y-coordinate of P using equation of AD:

y = (-10√14/11)x +18√14/11.

Plug in x=423/169:

y = (-10√14/11)(423/169) +18√14/11.

Compute each term:

First term: (-10*423√14)/(11*169) = (-4230√14)/1859.

Second term: 18√14/11 = (18√14 *169)/1859 = (3042√14)/1859.

So y = (-4230√14 +3042√14)/1859 = (-1188√14)/1859.

Simplify:

-1188 and 1859: Let's see if they have a common factor.

1188 ÷4=297, 1859 ÷4= not integer. 1188 ÷13=91.38, not integer. 1859 ÷13=143, which is 11*13. So 1859=13*143=13*11*13. So 1188=4*297=4*9*33=4*9*3*11.

So 1188 and 1859 share a common factor of 11.

Thus, divide numerator and denominator by 11:

-1188 ÷11= -108, 1859 ÷11=169.

So y = (-108√14)/169.

Thus, point P is at (423/169, -108√14/169).

Now, we need to compute AP.

Point A is at (1/3, 4√14/3). Point P is at (423/169, -108√14/169).

So, compute the distance between these two points.

Use distance formula:

AP = sqrt[(x_P - x_A)^2 + (y_P - y_A)^2]

Compute x_P - x_A = 423/169 -1/3.

Convert to common denominator:

423/169 - 56/507 = (423*3 -56)/507= (1269 -56)/507=1213/507.

Similarly, y_P - y_A = (-108√14/169 -4√14/3)= (-108√14/169 - (4√14/3)*(169/169))= (-108√14/169 - (676√14)/507)= (-108√14*3 -676√14)/507= (-324√14 -676√14)/507= (-1000√14)/507.

So,

AP = sqrt[(1213/507)^2 + (-1000√14/507)^2]

Factor out 1/507:

= sqrt[ (1213² + (1000² *14)) /507² ]

= (1/507) sqrt(1213² +14*1000² )

Compute 1213² and 14*1000².

First, 1213²:

1213*1213: Let's compute:

1200²=1,440,000

2*1200*13=2*1200*13=31,200

13²=169

So (1200 +13)²=1,440,000 +31,200 +169=1,471,369.

Then, 14*1000²=14*1,000,000=14,000,000.

So inside the sqrt:1,471,369 +14,000,000=15,471,369.

So sqrt(15,471,369). Let me see if this is a perfect square.

Compute sqrt(15,471,369). Let's see:

4000²=16,000,000 which is more than 15,471,369.

3900²=15,210,000.

So between 3900 and 4000.

Compute 3933²:

Let me compute 3933². Since 3933 is 3933.

Wait, 3933^2: Let's compute (4000 -67)^2=4000² -2*4000*67 +67²=16,000,000 -536,000 +4,489=15,468,489.

Compare with 15,471,369.

15,471,369 -15,468,489=2,880.

So 3933²=15,468,489, which is less than 15,471,369 by 2,880.

So 3933²=15,468,489.

Compute 3933 + x squared:

(3933 +x)^2=15,468,489 +2*3933*x +x².

Set this equal to 15,471,369.

So 2*3933*x +x²=15,471,369 -15,468,489=2,880.

So 7866x +x²=2,880.

Approximate x:

x² is small compared to 7866x, so x≈2880/7866≈0.366.

So approximately 3933.366²≈15,471,369.

But since 15,471,369 is not a perfect square, probably, so sqrt(15,471,369)= approximately 3933.366.

But perhaps it is exact? Wait, 15,471,369.

Wait, let me check 3933²=15,468,489, as above. Then 3933² +2,880=15,471,369. So 3933² +2,880=15,471,369.

So sqrt(15,471,369)=sqrt(3933² +2,880). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps 15,471,369 divided by some square.

Wait, 15,471,369 ÷ 3=5,157,123, which is not helpful.

Wait, maybe 15,471,369 is divisible by 13²=169.

Compute 15,471,369 ÷169.

169*90,000=15,210,000.

15,471,369 -15,210,000=261,369.

169*1,500=253,500

261,369 -253,500=7,869.

169*47=7,943, which is more than 7,869.

So 169*46=7,774.

7,869-7,774=95.

So total is 90,000 +1,500 +46=91,546 with remainder 95.

So no, not divisible by 169.

Wait, 15,471,369.

Wait, let me compute 3933.366²≈15,471,369. So sqrt(15,471,369)= approx 3933.366.

But wait, maybe 15,471,369 is a multiple of 1213² + (1000*sqrt14)^2.

Wait, no, 1213² + (1000√14)^2=1213² +14,000,000=15,471,369, which is what we have.

So sqrt(15,471,369)=sqrt(1213² + (1000√14)^2). Hmm, it's not necessarily a perfect square.

Wait, unless 1213 and 1000√14 are legs of a Pythagorean triple.

But 1213 is a prime? I don't know, but 1213² + (1000√14)^2=15,471,369.

But unless this is a perfect square, the sqrt would be irrational.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I made a calculation mistake earlier. Let me double-check.

Compute 1213²: 1213*1213.

Compute 1200²=1,440,000.

2*1200*13=31,200.

13²=169.

So 1,440,000 +31,200 +169=1,471,369.

1000²=1,000,000.

14*1000²=14,000,000.

1,471,369 +14,000,000=15,471,369.

So that's correct.

So sqrt(15,471,369)= sqrt(1213² + (1000√14)^2). Not sure if that's a perfect square.

Alternatively, maybe 15,471,369 is a square.

Let me check 3933²=15,468,489.

3934²=3933² +2*3933 +1=15,468,489 +7,866 +1=15,476,356.

But 15,476,356 >15,471,369, so no.

Thus, between 3933 and 3934. So sqrt(15,471,369)≈3933.366.

So, back to AP:

AP= sqrt(15,471,369)/507≈3933.366 /507≈7.75.

Wait, 507*7=3549, 507*7.75=507*(7 + 0.75)=3549 + 380.25=3929.25.

Hmm, close to 3933.366.

So 507*7.75≈3929.25, so 3933.366 -3929.25≈4.116.

So 507*0.008≈4.056.

So approximately 7.75 +0.008≈7.758.

Thus, AP≈7.758.

But the problem asks for AP as a reduced fraction m/n. So likely, sqrt(15,471,369) over 507 can be simplified.

Wait, 15,471,369 divided by 507².

Compute 507²=257,049.

15,471,369 ÷257,049= let's compute 257,049*60=15,422,940.

Subtract:15,471,369 -15,422,940=48,429.

48,429 ÷257,049≈0.1885.

So 60.1885. So 15,471,369=257,049*60.1885.

Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps 15,471,369 and 507 have a common factor.

Compute GCD(15,471,369,507).

507 factors: 507=3*13*13.

Check if 507 divides 15,471,369.

15,471,369 ÷507: 15,471,369 ÷507=30,530.12...

Not integer. So no, they don't share a common factor beyond 1.

Thus, AP= sqrt(15,471,369)/507. But sqrt(15,471,369) is approximately 3933.366.

Wait, perhaps 15,471,369 is a square? Wait, 3933²=15,468,489, which is less than 15,471,369.

Wait, 3933²=15,468,489.

Compute 3933²=15,468,489.

Compute 3933.333²: 3933 + 1/3.

(3933 +1/3)²=3933² + 2*3933*(1/3) + (1/3)²=15,468,489 + 2622 +1/9=15,471,111 +1/9≈15,471,111.111.

But 15,471,111.111 is less than 15,471,369.

Compute 3933.333 +x squared=15,471,369.

Not helpful.

Wait, maybe 15,471,369= 3933.366², but we can't write it as a fraction.

Wait, but this seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake earlier in computing the distance.

Wait, let me re-examine the coordinates.

Point A: (1/3, 4√14/3). Point P: (423/169, -108√14/169).

Compute x_P -x_A=423/169 -1/3=423/169 -56/507= (423*3 -56)/507=1269 -56=1213/507.

Similarly, y_P -y_A= -108√14/169 -4√14/3= (-108√14/169 -676√14/507)= (-324√14 -676√14)/507= (-1000√14)/507.

Wait, that seems correct.

So then, AP squared= (1213/507)^2 + (1000√14/507)^2= (1213² +1000²*14)/507²= (1,471,369 +14,000,000)/507²=15,471,369/507².

Thus, AP= sqrt(15,471,369)/507.

Hmm. But 15,471,369 is equal to 507²*60.1885, so not a perfect square. Therefore, AP is irrational. But the problem states that AP can be written as m/n where m and n are coprime integers. Therefore, I must have made an error in computation.

Wait, let me double-check the equation of line AD.

Point A is at (1/3, 4√14/3). Point D is at (9/2, -27√14/11).

Compute slope m:

( y_D - y_A ) / (x_D - x_A ) = ( -27√14/11 -4√14/3 ) / (9/2 -1/3 ).

Compute numerator:

Convert to common denominator 33:

-27√14/11= -81√14/33

4√14/3=44√14/33

So numerator: (-81√14 -44√14)/33= -125√14/33.

Denominator:

9/2 -1/3=27/6 -2/6=25/6.

Thus, slope m= (-125√14/33)/(25/6)= (-125√14/33)*(6/25)= (-5√14/11).

Wait, previously, I had slope as -10√14/11, but it should be -5√14/11. Wait, that's different.

Wait, earlier, when I computed slope, I had:

[ (-10√14/11) from tangent at B, but in reality, slope m is -5√14/11.

Wait, let me check where I messed up.

Wait, when I computed the slope between A and D, I think I made a mistake in the numerator.

Wait, let me recompute.

Point A: (1/3, 4√14/3).

Point D: (9/2, -27√14/11).

Compute y_D - y_A= (-27√14/11 -4√14/3).

Convert to common denominator 33:

-27√14/11= -81√14/33.

4√14/3=44√14/33.

So -81√14/33 -44√14/33= (-125√14)/33.

x_D -x_A=9/2 -1/3=27/6 -2/6=25/6.

Thus, slope m= (-125√14/33)/(25/6)= (-125√14/33)*(6/25)= (-5√14/11).

Yes, so slope m= -5√14/11.

Wait, earlier, I had m= -10√14/11, which was incorrect. So that was a mistake.

So slope m= -5√14/11.

Therefore, equation of AD is:

y - y_A= m(x -x_A).

So y -4√14/3= (-5√14/11)(x -1/3).

Compute this equation:

y= (-5√14/11)(x -1/3) +4√14/3.

Expand:

y= (-5√14/11)x +5√14/(11*3) +4√14/3.

Simplify constants:

5√14/33 +4√14/3=5√14/33 +44√14/33=49√14/33.

Thus, equation of AD is:

y= (-5√14/11)x +49√14/33.

Now, plug this into the circle equation x² + y² -9x + Ey=0, where E= (-33√14)/28.

Wait, let me recall, circle equation is x² + y² -9x + Ey=0, with E= (-33√14)/28.

So, plugging y= (-5√14/11)x +49√14/33 into the equation:

x² + [ (-5√14/11 x +49√14/33 )² ] -9x + E*(-5√14/11 x +49√14/33 )=0.

This seems complicated, but let me proceed step by step.

First, compute y:

y= (-5√14/11)x +49√14/33.

Compute y²:

[ (-5√14/11 x +49√14/33 ) ]².

Let me factor out √14:

√14*(-5/11 x +49/33).

So y=√14*(-5/11 x +49/33).

So y²=14*(-5/11 x +49/33)^2.

Compute (-5/11 x +49/33)^2:

= (25/121)x² - 2*(5/11)*(49/33)x + (49/33)^2.

=25x²/121 - (490x)/363 +2401/1089.

Thus, y²=14*(25x²/121 -490x/363 +2401/1089).

Compute each term:

14*(25x²/121)=350x²/121.

14*(-490x/363)= -6860x/363.

14*(2401/1089)=33614/1089.

Thus, y²=350x²/121 -6860x/363 +33614/1089.

Now, plug into circle equation:

x² + y² -9x +E y=0.

Compute each term:

x² + [350x²/121 -6860x/363 +33614/1089] -9x + E*(-5√14/11 x +49√14/33)=0.

Let me compute term by term.

First, x².

Second, y²=350x²/121 -6860x/363 +33614/1089.

Third, -9x.

Fourth, E y= E*(-5√14/11 x +49√14/33).

Compute E y:

E= (-33√14)/28.

Thus,

E*(-5√14/11 x +49√14/33 )= (-33√14)/28 * (-5√14/11 x) + (-33√14)/28*(49√14/33).

Compute each part:

First part: (-33√14)/28 * (-5√14/11 x)= (33*5*14)/(28*11)x= (165*14)/(308)x= (2310)/308x= simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 14: 2310 ÷14=165, 308 ÷14=22. So 165/22x=15/2x.

Second part: (-33√14)/28 *49√14/33= (-33*49*14)/(28*33)= (-49*14)/28= (-686)/28= -24.5= -49/2.

So E y=15/2 x -49/2.

Now, combine all terms:

x² + [350x²/121 -6860x/363 +33614/1089] -9x +15/2 x -49/2=0.

Let me combine like terms:

x² terms:

1 +350/121= (121/121) +350/121=471/121.

x terms:

-6860/363 -9 +15/2.

Constants:

33614/1089 -49/2.

Compute each:

First, x² coefficient:471/121.

Second, x terms:

Convert all to common denominator, let's say 726 (which is 2*3*11*11, but perhaps 363*2=726).

Compute:

-6860/363= (-6860*2)/726= -13720/726.

-9= -9*726/726= -6534/726.

15/2=15*363/726=5445/726.

So total x terms:

(-13720 -6534 +5445)/726= (-13720 -6534= -20254 +5445= -14809)/726.

Thus, x terms coefficient: -14809/726.

Constant terms:

33614/1089 -49/2.

Convert to common denominator 2178 (1089*2).

33614/1089=67228/2178.

49/2=49*1089/2178=53361/2178.

Thus, constants:

67228 -53361=13867.

So 13867/2178.

Thus, entire equation:

471/121 x² -14809/726 x +13867/2178=0.

Multiply both sides by 2178 to eliminate denominators:

471/121 *2178 x² -14809/726 *2178 x +13867=0.

Compute each term:

First term:471/121 *2178=471*(2178/121)=471*(18)=8478.

Second term:-14809/726 *2178= -14809*(2178/726)= -14809*(3)= -44427.

Third term:13867.

Thus, equation becomes:

8478x² -44427x +13867=0.

Wait, let me verify:

471/121 *2178=471*(18)=8478.

Yes, since 2178 ÷121=18.

Similarly, 14809/726 *2178=14809*(3)=44427.

So, 8478x² -44427x +13867=0.

Let me see if this quadratic can be simplified.

Divide all terms by GCD(8478,44427,13867).

Compute GCD:

First, GCD(8478,44427).

Use Euclidean algorithm:

44427 ÷8478=5, remainder 44427 -5*8478=44427 -42390=2037.

Now GCD(8478,2037).

8478 ÷2037=4, remainder 8478 -4*2037=8478 -8148=330.

GCD(2037,330).

2037 ÷330=6, remainder 2037 -6*330=2037 -1980=57.

GCD(330,57).

330 ÷57=5, remainder 330 -285=45.

GCD(57,45).

57 ÷45=1, remainder 12.

GCD(45,12).

45 ÷12=3, remainder 9.

GCD(12,9).

12 ÷9=1, remainder 3.

GCD(9,3)=3.

Thus, GCD=3.

Check if 3 divides 13867? 1+3+8+6+7=25, 25 not divisible by 3. So GCD is 1.

Thus, equation is 8478x² -44427x +13867=0.

We can solve this quadratic for x.

Use quadratic formula:

x=(44427 ±sqrt(44427² -4*8478*13867))/(2*8478).

Compute discriminant D=44427² -4*8478*13867.

This is going to be a huge number, but let's compute step by step.

First, compute 44427².

Compute 44427*44427:

This is going to be tedious. Let me compute as (44000 +427)^2=44000² +2*44000*427 +427².

Compute each term:

44000²=1,936,000,000.

2*44000*427=88,000*427.

Compute 88,000*400=35,200,000.

88,000*27=2,376,000.

Total=35,200,000 +2,376,000=37,576,000.

427²=182,329.

Thus, total 44427²=1,936,000,000 +37,576,000 +182,329=1,936,000,000 +37,576,000=1,973,576,000 +182,329=1,973,758,329.

Now, compute 4*8478*13867.

First, compute 4*8478=33,912.

Then, 33,912*13,867.

Compute 33,912*10,000=339,120,000.

33,912*3,000=101,736,000.

33,912*800=27,129,600.

33,912*60=2,034,720.

33,912*7=237,384.

Add all together:

339,120,000 +101,736,000=440,856,000.

440,856,000 +27,129,600=467,985,600.

467,985,600 +2,034,720=470,020,320.

470,020,320 +237,384=470,257,704.

Thus, discriminant D=1,973,758,329 -470,257,704=1,503,500,625.

Wow, nice! So sqrt(D)=sqrt(1,503,500,625). Let me see if this is a perfect square.

Compute sqrt(1,503,500,625).

Note that 38,780²= approx 1.5e9, but let me compute.

Let me compute 38,780²:

Wait, 38,780²= (38,000 +780)²=38,000² +2*38,000*780 +780²=1,444,000,000 +59,280,000 +608,400=1,444,000,000 +59,280,000=1,503,280,000 +608,400=1,503,888,400.

But D=1,503,500,625 is less than that.

Compute 38,780²=1,503,888,400.

Thus, sqrt(1,503,500,625)=38,780 -x.

Compute (38,780 -x)^2=1,503,500,625.

Expand: 38,780² -2*38,780*x +x²=1,503,500,625.

We have 38,780²=1,503,888,400.

Thus, 1,503,888,400 -77,560x +x²=1,503,500,625.

Subtract 1,503,500,625:

382,775 -77,560x +x²=0.

Approximate x:

Assuming x is small, x² is negligible.

382,775≈77,560x.

Thus, x≈382,775 /77,560≈4.93.

Compute (38,780 -4.93)^2≈approx 38,775.07²≈1,503,500,625.

But precise calculation is tedious. Alternatively, note that 1,503,500,625= (38,785)^2.

Wait, 38,785²:

Compute 38,785*38,785.

But maybe better to note that 1,503,500,625= (38,785)^2. Let me check:

38,785*38,785:

Compute (38,800 -15)^2=38,800² -2*38,800*15 +15²=1,505,440,000 -1,164,000 +225=1,505,440,000 -1,164,000=1,504,276,000 +225=1,504,276,225.

Which is higher than D=1,503,500,625.

Wait, 38,785²=1,504,276,225.

But D=1,503,500,625.

So 1,504,276,225 -1,503,500,625=775,600.

So 38,785² -775,600=1,503,500,625.

Which means 38,785² -775,600= D.

But 775,600= approx 38,785*20. So not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe D is not a perfect square, but wait, 1,503,500,625.

Divide by 25:1,503,500,625 ÷25=60,140,025.

60,140,025 ÷25=2,405,601.

2,405,601 ÷25=96,224.04, not integer. So D is divisible by 25, but not higher.

Wait, sqrt(D)=sqrt(25*60,140,025)=5*sqrt(60,140,025).

Compute sqrt(60,140,025).

Divide by 25:60,140,025 ÷25=2,405,601.

sqrt(2,405,601). Let me compute 1,551²=2,405,601, because 1,500²=2,250,000, 1,550²=2,402,500, so 1,551²=2,402,500 +2*1,550 +1=2,402,500 +3,100 +1=2,405,601.

Yes, so sqrt(60,140,025)=5*1,551=7,755.

Thus, sqrt(D)=5*7,755=38,775.

Wait, really?

Wait, no:

Wait, D=1,503,500,625=25*60,140,025=25*25*2,405,601=625*2,405,601.

Wait, 2,405,601=1,551².

Thus, D=625*(1,551)^2=(25*1,551)^2=(38,775)^2.

Yes, so sqrt(D)=38,775.

Wow, okay, so sqrt(D)=38,775.

Thus, x=(44427 ±38,775)/(2*8478).

Compute both solutions:

First, x=(44427 +38,775)/(2*8478)=83,202/16,956.

Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 6:83,202 ÷6=13,867;16,956 ÷6=2,826.

Again, divide by GCD(13,867,2,826). Use Euclidean algorithm:

13,867 ÷2,826=4, remainder 1,583.

2,826 ÷1,583=1, remainder 1,243.

1,583 ÷1,243=1, remainder 340.

1,243 ÷340=3, remainder 223.

340 ÷223=1, remainder 117.

223 ÷117=1, remainder 106.

117 ÷106=1, remainder 11.

106 ÷11=9, remainder 7.

11 ÷7=1, remainder 4.

7 ÷4=1, remainder 3.

4 ÷3=1, remainder 1.

3 ÷1=3, remainder 0.

Thus, GCD=1.

Thus, x=13,867/2,826.

But wait, point A is at x=1/3≈0.333, and D is at x=9/2=4.5. So x_P≈7.75, which is beyond D, so P is outside segment AD. But since P is the other intersection, it's on the circumcircle.

Similarly, the other solution is x=(44427 -38,775)/(2*8478)=5,652/16,956.

Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 12:5,652 ÷12=471;16,956 ÷12=1,413.

Divide by 3:471 ÷3=157;1,413 ÷3=471.

Divide by 157:157 ÷157=1;471 ÷157≈3.

Wait, 157*3=471, yes.

Thus, x=1/3, which is point A.

Therefore, the other solution is x=1/3, which is point A, so point P is at x=5,652/16,956=471/1,413=157/471.

Wait, wait, 5,652 divided by 12=471, 16,956 divided by12=1,413.

1,413 ÷3=471, 471 ÷3=157.

Thus, 5,652/16,956=157/471.

Wait, wait, 157 is a prime? 157 divided by primes up to sqrt(157)=12.5, so 2,3,5,7,11. 157 isn't divisible by any, so it's prime.

Similarly, 471=3*157.

Thus, 157/471=157/(3*157)=1/3.

Wait, so x=1/3, which is point A.

Wait, that can't be, unless the quadratic only has x=1/3 and another x= something else.

Wait, I must have messed up.

Wait, wait, let me compute (44427 -38,775)=5,652.

Thus, x=5,652 / (2*8478)=5,652 /16,956.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 12:5,652 ÷12=471;16,956 ÷12=1,413.

471/1,413.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3:471 ÷3=157;1,413 ÷3=471.

157/471.

Divide numerator and denominator by 157:157 ÷157=1;471 ÷157≈3.

Wait, 157*3=471, so 157/471=1/3.

Thus, x=1/3.

Wait, so both roots are x=1/3 and x= something else? But the quadratic equation was 8478x² -44427x +13867=0.

But if x=1/3 is a root, plugging in:

8478*(1/3)^2 -44427*(1/3) +13867=8478*(1/9) -14,809 +13,867=942 -14,809 +13,867= (942 +13,867) -14,809=14,809 -14,809=0.

Thus, x=1/3 is a root, and the other root is x= (44427)/8478= as computed earlier.

Wait, no, in quadratic equation, if one root is x=1/3, then the other root is x= (c/a)/(1/3)= (13867/8478)/(1/3)=13867/8478*3=13867/28,434.

Wait, 13867 and28,434. Let's compute GCD(13867,28,434).

28,434 ÷13867=2, remainder 28,434 -2*13867=28,434 -27,734=700.

13867 ÷700=19, remainder 13867 -19*700=13867 -13,300=567.

700 ÷567=1, remainder 133.

567 ÷133=4, remainder 567 -532=35.

133 ÷35=3, remainder 28.

35 ÷28=1, remainder7.

28 ÷7=4, done.

Thus, GCD=7.

Thus, x=13867/28,434= (13867 ÷7)/(28,434 ÷7)=1,981 /4,062.

Check if reducible:1,981 ÷13=152.384, not integer. 1,981 ÷7=283, which is prime.

Thus, x=1,981/4,062.

Thus, the two intersection points are x=1/3 (point A) and x=1,981/4,062≈0.488, which is point P.

Therefore, point P has coordinates x=1,981/4,062.

Compute y-coordinate using line AD: y= (-5√14/11)x +49√14/33.

Thus, y= (-5√14/11)*(1,981/4,062) +49√14/33.

Compute each term:

First term:

(-5√14/11)*(1,981/4,062)= (-5*1,981)/(11*4,062) *√14= (-9,905)/(44,682)*√14.

Simplify -9,905/44,682.

Compute GCD(9,905,44,682). Use Euclidean algorithm:

44,682 ÷9,905=4, remainder 44,682 -4*9,905=44,682 -39,620=5,062.

9,905 ÷5,062=1, remainder 4,843.

5,062 ÷4,843=1, remainder 219.

4,843 ÷219=21, remainder 144.

219 ÷144=1, remainder75.

144 ÷75=1, remainder69.

75 ÷69=1, remainder6.

69 ÷6=11, remainder3.

6 ÷3=2, remainder0.

Thus, GCD=3.

Thus, -9,905/44,682= -3,301.666/14,894≈Wait, no, not helpful.

Simplify numerator and denominator by GCD=3:

-9,905 ÷3≈-3,301.666, which is not integer. Wait, 9,905 ÷5=1,981, which is prime.

Wait, 44,682 ÷3=14,894.

Thus, -9,905/44,682= -1,981/14,894.

Wait, 1,981 and14,894. Let's check GCD.

14,894 ÷1,981=7, remainder14,894 -7*1,981=14,894 -13,867=1,027.

1,981 ÷1,027=1, remainder 954.

1,027 ÷954=1, remainder73.

954 ÷73=13, remainder 954 -13*73=954 -949=5.

73 ÷5=14, remainder3.

5 ÷3=1, remainder2.

3 ÷2=1, remainder1.

2 ÷1=2, remainder0.

Thus, GCD=1.

Thus, fraction is -1,981/14,894.

Thus, first term: (-1,981/14,894)*√14.

Second term:49√14/33.

Compute total y-coordinate:

y= (-1,981√14)/14,894 +49√14/33.

Factor out √14:

y=√14*(-1,981/14,894 +49/33).

Compute the fractions:

Find common denominator for 14,894 and33.

14,894=2*7*13*83.

33=3*11.

Thus, LCM=2*3*7*11*13*83=2*3*7*11*13*83.

Compute:

2*3=6.

6*7=42.

42*11=462.

462*13=6,006.

6,006*83=500,598.

Thus, common denominator=500,598.

Convert fractions:

-1,981/14,894= (-1,981*33)/500,598= -65,373/500,598.

49/33=49*(14,894)/500,598= wait, no, better:

49/33= (49*15,168)/500,598. Wait, no, better to compute:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (500,598 /33)=15,168.

Thus,49/33=49*(15,168)/500,598=49*15,168=742, 49*15,000=735,000;49*168=8,232; total=735,000 +8,232=743,232.

Thus,49/33=743,232/500,598.

Similarly, -1,981/14,894= -1,981*33= -65,373/500,598.

Thus, total y=√14*( -65,373 +743,232 ) /500,598.

Compute numerator: -65,373 +743,232=677,859.

Thus, y=√14*(677,859/500,598).

Simplify 677,859 and500,598.

Compute GCD(677,859,500,598).

Using Euclidean algorithm:

677,859 ÷500,598=1, remainder 677,859 -500,598=177,261.

500,598 ÷177,261=2, remainder500,598 -354,522=146,076.

9,849 ÷1,638=6, remainder1,638*6=9,828; 9,849 -9,828=21.

1,638 ÷21=78, done.

Thus, GCD=21.

Thus, 677,859 ÷21=32,279.

500,598 ÷21=23,838.

Thus, y=√14*(32,279/23,838).

Simplify 32,279/23,838.

Check if reducible. 32,279 ÷7=4,611.285—not integer.

23,838 ÷7=3,405.428—nope.

Check GCD(32,279,23,838).

Using Euclidean algorithm:

Thus, GCD=1.

Thus, fraction is 32,279/23,838.

Therefore, y=√14*(32,279/23,838).

Thus, point P has coordinates (1,981/4,062, 32,279√14/23,838).

Now, compute AP.

Point A: (1/3,4√14/3).

Point P: (1,981/4,062, 32,279√14/23,838).

Compute the distance AP.

Compute Δx and Δy.

Δx=1,981/4,062 -1/3=1,981/4,062 -1,354/4,062=627/4,062=209/1,354.

Simplify 209/1,354.

Check GCD(209,1,354). 209=11*19. 1,354 ÷11=123.09, not integer. 1,354 ÷19≈71.26, not integer. So, GCD=1.

Thus, Δx=209/1,354.

Δy=32,279√14/23,838 -4√14/3.

Factor out √14:

Δy=√14*(32,279/23,838 -4/3).

Compute the fractions:

Convert 4/3 to denominator23,838:4/3= (4*7,946)/23,838=31,784/23,838.

Thus,

Δy=√14*(32,279 -31,784)/23,838=√14*(495)/23,838.

Simplify 495/23,838.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3:165/7,946.

Check GCD(165,7,946). 165=5*33=5*3*11. 7,946 ÷11=722.36, not integer. 7,946 ÷3≈2,648.666, not integer. Thus, GCD=1.

Thus, Δy=495√14/23,838=165√14/7,946.

Thus, distance AP=√[(209/1,354)^2 + (165√14/7,946)^2 ].

Compute each term:

(209/1,354)^2= (209²)/(1,354²)=43,681/1,832,  43,681 ÷1,832,  1,354²=1,832, 43,681/1,832,  43,681 ÷1,832≈23.83.

Wait, compute 1,354²:

1,354*1,354: Let's compute 1,350²=1,822,500; 2*1,350*4=10,800;4²=16. So, (1,350 +4)^2=1,350² +2*1,350*4 +4²=1,822,500 +10,800 +16=1,833,316.

Thus, (209)^2=43,681.

Thus, (209/1,354)^2=43,681/1,833,316.

Similarly, (165√14/7,946)^2=(165²*14)/(7,946²)=27,225*14 /63,  7,946².

Compute 7,946²: Let's note that 7,946=7,900 +46. So, (7,900 +46)^2=7,900² +2*7,900*46 +46²=62,410,000 +727,600 +2,116=63,140,716.

Thus, (165√14/7,946)^2= (27,225*14)/63,140,716=381,150 /63,140,716.

Simplify 381,150 /63,140,716.

Divide numerator and denominator by 2:190,575 /31,570,358.

Check GCD(190,575,31,570,358). 190,575=25*7,623=25*3*2,541=25*3*3*847=25*3²*7*121=25*3²*7*11².

31,570,358 ÷2=15,785,179, which is prime? Maybe. Probably GCD=1.

Thus, the two terms under the square root are 43,681/1,833,316 and 381,150/63,140,716.

Find a common denominator to add them:

The denominators are 1,833,316 and63,140,716. Note that 63,140,716=34²*1,833,316, since 34²=1,156, 1,156*1,833,316=2,120,000,000 approx.

1,833,316*6=11,000,  1,833,316*6=11,000.

Wait, that's a lot. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, 11,000 is 11,000, so each time, 11,000.

So, perhaps it's correct.

Therefore, discriminant is 55,681 / 11,000.

Which is 55,681 ÷ 11,000 ≈5.061818.

Thus, the sqrt is approximately 2.25.

Therefore, x is [5.5 ± 2.25] / 6.

So, two solutions:

(5.5 +2.25)/6=7.75/6≈1.2917

(5.5 -2.25)/6=3.25/6≈0.5417.

So, x≈1.2917 or x≈0.5417.

But wait, point P is on the circle, which is a point on the line AB extended.

But in the problem statement, P is a point on the circle, so it must be one of these two points.

But which one?

Looking back, since in our coordinate system, point A is at (5/3, 4√14 /3 )≈(1.666, 5.441).

Point B is at (9, 0).

So, line AB goes from (1.666,5.441) to (9,0). So, it's going down.

So, when we extend AB beyond B, we go further down to P.

But in our calculation, one solution is x≈1.29, which is between A and B, so between A and B.

But since we need P to be on the circle, and the circle intersects AB at A and P.

Therefore, the other solution is x≈0.5417, which is beyond A, in the opposite direction.

Wait, but in our coordinate system, point A is at x≈1.666, so x≈0.5417 is to the left of A.

But since the circle is passing through A and B, which is at x=9.

But the center is at (5, k), so moving left from A towards the center.

So, point P is at x≈0.5417, so it's on the circle.

But the distance from A to P is sqrt( (5 -0.5417)^2 + (4√14 /3 - y_p )^2 ).

But since we have the equation of the circle, we can compute the distance.

Alternatively, maybe compute the distances.

Wait, point P is at x≈0.5417, y≈ ?

Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps find the distance from A to O, since A is on the circle.

Compute OA:

OA is the distance from (5, k) to (5/3, 4√14 /3).

Compute OA^2:

(5 - 5/3)^2 + (k - 4√14 /3)^2 = (10/3)^2 + (k - 4√14 /3)^2

Similarly, OB^2 = (5 -9)^2 + (k -0)^2 = 16 + k^2

So, OA^2 = (100/9) + (k - 4√14 /3)^2.

Similarly, OB^2 = 16 + k^2.

But OA and OB are radii, so they should be equal.

Wait, OA^2 = OB^2.

Therefore,

100/9 + (k - 4√14 /3)^2 = 16 + k^2.

Compute:

(k - 4√14 /3)^2 = 16 + k^2 - 100/9.

Compute RHS: 16=144/9, so 144/9 + k^2 - 100/9 = k^2 + (144 -100)/9 = k^2 + 44/9.

Thus,

(k - 4√14 /3)^2 = k^2 + 44/9.

Expanding left side:

k^2 - (8√14 /3)k + (16 *14)/9 = k^2 + 44/9.

Subtract k^2 from both sides:

- (8√14 /3)k + (224/9) = 44/9.

Thus,

- (8√14 /3)k = 44/9 - 224/9 = (44 -224)/9 = (-180)/9 = -20.

Multiply both sides by (-3/8√14):

k = (-20)*(-3)/(8√14) = 60 / (8√14) = 15 / (2√14) = (15√14)/28.

Therefore, k = (15√14)/28.

So, center is at (5, (15√14)/28).

Now, with k known, we can find the radius, which is OA.

Compute OA^2:

(10/3)^2 + ( (15√14)/28 - 4√14 /3 )^2.

Compute the y-coordinate difference:

(15√14)/28 - 4√14 /3 = (15√14)/28 - (4√14 *28)/84 = (15√14)/28 - (112√14)/84.

Convert to common denominator:

15√14 /28 = 45√14 /84.

So, 45√14 /84 - 112√14 /84 =
