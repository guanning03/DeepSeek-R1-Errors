Question:
Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

Correct Answer:
We will denote $h(x)=4g(f(x))$ for simplicity. Denote $p(x)$ as the first equation and $q(y)$ as the graph of the second. We notice that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ oscillate between 0 and 1. The intersections are thus all in the square $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(1,0)$. Every $p(x)$ wave going up and down crosses every $q(y)$ wave. Now, we need to find the number of times each wave touches 0 and 1.

We notice that $h(x)=0$ occurs at $x=-\frac{3}{4}, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}$, and $h(x)=1$ occurs at $x=-1, -\frac{1}{2}, 0,\frac{1}{2},1$. A sinusoid passes through each point twice during each period, but it only passes through the extrema once. $p(x)$ has 1 period between 0 and 1, giving 8 solutions for $p(x)=0$ and 9 solutions for $p(x)=1$, or 16 up and down waves. $q(y)$ has 1.5 periods, giving 12 solutions for $q(y)=0$ and 13 solutions for $q(y)=1$, or 24 up and down waves. This amounts to $16\cdot24=384$ intersections.

However, we have to be very careful when counting around $(1, 1)$. At this point, $q(y)$ has an infinite downwards slope and $p(x)$ is slanted, giving us an extra intersection; thus, we need to add 1 to our answer to get $\boxed{385}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions involved are pretty complicated, involving absolute values and compositions of functions. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let me write down the functions as given:

- \( f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \)
- \( g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \)

And the equations of the graphs are:

1. \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)

I need to find how many times these two graphs intersect each other. That is, how many pairs \((x, y)\) satisfy both equations simultaneously.

Hmm, okay. So, intersections occur where both equations are true for the same \(x\) and \(y\). So, essentially, solving the system:

\[
\begin{cases}
y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \\
x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))
\end{cases}
\]

I think a good starting point is to analyze the functions \(f\) and \(g\) first because they seem to be building blocks here.

Let me try to understand what \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) look like.

Starting with \(f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right|\). Let's break this down:

- \( |x| \) is a V-shaped graph with its vertex at (0,0).
- Subtracting \(\frac{1}{2}\) shifts it down by \(\frac{1}{2}\), so now the vertex is at (0, -\(\frac{1}{2}\)).
- Then taking the absolute value of that result will reflect any negative parts back above the x-axis.

So, let's plot this:

1. For \(|x| \geq \frac{1}{2}\), \( |x| - \frac{1}{2} \) is non-negative, so \(f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2}\).
2. For \(|x| < \frac{1}{2}\), \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x|\).

Therefore, \(f(x)\) is a piecewise linear function with a "V" shape, but it's been shifted and inverted. Specifically, it has a V pointing upwards for \(|x| \geq \frac{1}{2}\) and a V pointing downwards for \(|x| < \frac{1}{2}\). Wait, actually, since it's the absolute value, it will be symmetric about the y-axis.

Let me sketch this mentally:

- At \(x = 0\), \(f(0) = \frac{1}{2}\).
- At \(x = \pm \frac{1}{2}\), \(f(x) = 0\).
- For \(|x| > \frac{1}{2}\), \(f(x)\) increases linearly with slope 1.

Similarly, for \(g(x)\):

\(g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right|\).

Same idea:

1. For \(|x| \geq \frac{1}{4}\), \(g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4}\).
2. For \(|x| < \frac{1}{4}\), \(g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x|\).

So, similar structure but with different thresholds.

So, both \(f\) and \(g\) are piecewise linear, with different breakpoints at \(\pm \frac{1}{2}\) and \(\pm \frac{1}{4}\) respectively.

Now, moving on to the functions \(y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\) and \(x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\).

Let me analyze these composite functions step by step.

First, \(f(\sin(2\pi x))\):

- The inner function is \(\sin(2\pi x)\), which has a period of 1, oscillating between -1 and 1.
- Then, \(f\) is applied to this. Since \(f\) takes any real number and maps it to a non-negative value, the range of \(f(\sin(2\pi x))\) will be between 0 and some maximum value.

Wait, let's compute the range of \(f(u)\) where \(u = \sin(2\pi x)\). Since \(u\) will vary between -1 and 1, let's see how \(f(u)\) behaves over that interval.

Given that \(f(u) = \left| |u| - \frac{1}{2} \right|\), let's evaluate this for \(u \in [-1, 1]\).

First, note that \(|u|\) is in [0, 1]. Then, \(|u| - 1/2\) will be in [-1/2, 1/2]. Taking the absolute value, \(f(u)\) will be in [0, 1/2].

So, \(f(\sin(2\pi x))\) has a range of [0, \(\frac{1}{2}\)].

Similarly, \(g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\) is \(g\) applied to a value between 0 and \(\frac{1}{2}\).

Let's compute the range of \(g(v)\) where \(v \in [0, \frac{1}{2}]\).

Given that \(g(v) = \left| v - \frac{1}{4} \right|\), because \(v\) is non-negative here.

Therefore, \(v\) is from 0 to 1/2:

- When \(v < 1/4\), \(g(v) = \frac{1}{4} - v\).
- When \(v \geq 1/4\), \(g(v) = v - \frac{1}{4}\).

So, \(g(v)\) will have a maximum at \(v = 0\) (g(0) = 1/4) and decrease until \(v = 1/4\) (g(1/4) = 0), then increase again to g(1/2) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Wait, so \(g(v)\) on [0, 1/2] is symmetric around \(v = 1/4\), with a V shape.

Therefore, \(g(v)\) reaches maximum 1/4 at both ends \(v=0\) and \(v=1/2\), and minimum 0 at \(v=1/4\).

So, \(g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\) will range between 0 and 1/4.

Therefore, when we multiply by 4, as in \(y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\), the range of \(y\) is [0, 1].

Similarly, looking at the second equation \(x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\), the right-hand side is similar:

- \(f(\cos(3\pi y))\): \(f\) takes \(\cos(3\pi y)\) which is in [-1, 1], same as before, so \(f(\cos(3\pi y))\) is in [0, 1/2].
- Then, \(g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\) is similar to above, but \(v\) is in [0, 1/2], so it's in [0, 1/4].
- Multiply by 4, so \(x\) is in [0, 1].

So, both \(x\) and \(y\) are in [0,1]. So, we can limit our analysis to \(x, y \in [0,1]\).

Given that, perhaps I can consider the behavior of these functions within this interval.

But before that, let me note that \(f\) and \(g\) are even functions, because they involve absolute values. So, \(f(-x) = f(x)\), \(g(-x) = g(x)\). Therefore, the composite functions \(4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\) and \(4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\) are also even in their inner functions.

But since we are dealing with \(x\) and \(y\) in [0,1], perhaps the functions are symmetric around 0.5 or something? Wait, not necessarily, because the periods of the sine and cosine functions might complicate things.

Wait, let's think about the inner functions.

For \(y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\):

- \(2\pi x\) has a period of 1, so \(\sin(2\pi x)\) is periodic with period 1.
- Then, \(f(\sin(2\pi x))\) is also periodic with period 1.
- Then, \(g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\) is also periodic with period 1.
- So, \(y\) is periodic with period 1.

Similarly, for \(x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\):

- \(3\pi y\) has a period of \(2/3\), so \(\cos(3\pi y)\) is periodic with period \(2/3\).
- Then, \(f(\cos(3\pi y))\) has period \(2/3\).
- Then, \(g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\) also has period \(2/3\).
- So, \(x\) is periodic with period \(2/3\).

So, the first equation is 1-periodic in \(x\), and the second is \(2/3\)-periodic in \(y\). Hmm, interesting. So, their periods are different.

But since we're looking for intersections over all real numbers, but due to the periodicity, perhaps we can focus on a common interval where both functions repeat their behavior.

Wait, but both equations are defined for all real \(x\) and \(y\), but the functions \(y\) and \(x\) are periodic, so their graphs will consist of repeating patterns. Therefore, the number of intersections is infinite, right?

But wait, that can't be. Because the problem is asking for the number of intersections, so it must be finite. Maybe I misinterpret something. Let me check.

Wait, actually, the functions are defined for all real \(x\) and \(y\), but the equations are \(y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\) and \(x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\). So, these are curves in the plane, but they are not necessarily bounded. However, since \(4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\) and \(4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\) are both bounded between 0 and 1, as we saw earlier, because \(g\) and \(f\) map to [0, 1/2] and then scaled by 4 gives [0, 2]. Wait, hold on, hold on.

Wait, no, let me double-check:

Wait, actually, \(f(x)\) is \(\left| |x| - 1/2 \right|\). So, if \(x\) is in [-1,1], \(f(x)\) is in [0, 1/2]. Then \(g(f(x))\) is \(\left| f(x) - 1/4 \right|\). Since \(f(x)\) is in [0, 1/2], then \(g(f(x))\) is in [0, 1/4] as before.

Wait, but then \(4g(f(x))\) is in [0, 1]. So, \(y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\) is in [0,1], same with \(x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\) is in [0,1].

Therefore, both \(x\) and \(y\) are in [0,1], so the graphs are confined to the unit square [0,1]x[0,1].

But wait, that's only if \(x\) and \(y\) are in [0,1], but actually, since \(\sin(2\pi x)\) and \(\cos(3\pi y)\) can take any real values, but \(f\) and \(g\) will map them into [0,1/2], so scaling by 4 gives [0,2], but then in the equations, \(y\) and \(x\) are set equal to these scaled values.

Wait, hold on, I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me re-examine:

\(f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right|\), which for any real \(x\), is non-negative, but is it bounded?

No, actually, as \(x\) becomes large, \(f(x)\) behaves like \(|x| - 1/2\), so it goes to infinity as \(x\) increases.

Similarly, \(g(x)\) is similar, but with 1/4 instead. So, \(g(x)\) also goes to infinity as \(x\) increases.

Therefore, \(4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\): since \(f(\sin(2\pi x))\) is in [0, 1/2], as we saw earlier, because \(f\) is applied to \(\sin(2\pi x)\), which is bounded between -1 and 1.

Wait, no, hold on. Let me correct that.

Wait, \(f(x)\) is \(\left| |x| - 1/2 \right|\). So, if \(x\) is any real number, \(|x|\) can be anything, so \(f(x)\) can be anything from 0 to infinity. But in our case, \(x\) is \(\sin(2\pi x)\), which is between -1 and 1. So, \(f(\sin(2\pi x))\) is \(\left| |\sin(2\pi x)| - 1/2 \right|\), which is in [0, 1/2].

Therefore, \(4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\) is \(4 \times \left| f(\sin(2\pi x)) - 1/4 \right|\), where \(f(\sin(2\pi x))\) is in [0, 1/2]. Therefore, \(g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\) is in [0, 1/4], as before, so \(4g(f(...))\) is in [0,1].

Similarly, \(4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\) is also in [0,1].

Therefore, both \(x\) and \(y\) are confined to [0,1]. So, the graphs are within the unit square.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of intersections within [0,1]x[0,1].

So, now, to find the number of pairs \((x, y)\) in [0,1]x[0,1] such that:

1. \(y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\)
2. \(x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\)

Since both \(x\) and \(y\) are determined by functions of the other variable, this is a system of equations that could have multiple solutions.

To solve this, I can consider that for each \(x\), \(y\) is determined by the first equation, and for each \(y\), \(x\) is determined by the second. So, perhaps I can think of this as a mapping from \(x\) to \(y\) and then back to \(x\), and see when the mapping is consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the composition of these functions.

But before getting into that, maybe it's helpful to analyze the behavior of the functions involved.

First, let me define:

Let \(A(x) = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\) and \(B(y) = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\).

Then, the equations become:

1. \(y = A(x)\)
2. \(x = B(y)\)

Therefore, substituting the first into the second:

\(x = B(A(x))\)

So, we're looking for fixed points of the function \(B \circ A\), that is, points where \(x = B(A(x))\).

Similarly, since \(y = A(x)\), once we find such \(x\), we can find \(y\) accordingly.

Therefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of fixed points of \(B \circ A\) in [0,1], which is also equal to the number of intersections between the curves \(y = A(x)\) and \(x = B(y)\).

So, now, to find the number of fixed points, we can analyze the function \(B \circ A(x)\) and see how many times it intersects the line \(y = x\).

But perhaps I can plot these functions or analyze their behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the periodicity and symmetry to figure out how many times they intersect.

Given that \(A(x)\) is periodic with period 1, as we saw earlier, because it's composed with \(\sin(2\pi x)\), which has period 1.

Similarly, \(B(y)\) is periodic with period \(2/3\), because it's composed with \(\cos(3\pi y)\), which has period \(2/3\).

But since both \(x\) and \(y\) are in [0,1], perhaps I can consider how these functions behave within this interval.

Wait, but \(B(y)\) is defined for all \(y\), but since \(y\) is in [0,1], \(B(y)\) is also in [0,1].

So, perhaps I can consider that \(B(A(x))\) is a function from [0,1] to [0,1], and I can analyze its fixed points.

But to get an idea, maybe I can figure out the possible ranges and how the functions \(A(x)\) and \(B(y)\) behave.

First, let's understand \(A(x) = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))\).

Given that \(f(\sin(2\pi x))\) is \(\left| |\sin(2\pi x)| - 1/2 \right|\), which we established is in [0, 1/2].

Then, \(g\) of that is \(\left| f(\sin(2\pi x)) - 1/4 \right|\), which is in [0, 1/4].

So, \(4g\) is in [0,1].

Therefore, \(A(x)\) is a function from [0,1] to [0,1].

Similarly for \(B(y)\).

Now, perhaps I can analyze \(A(x)\) and \(B(y)\) in more detail.

Starting with \(A(x)\):

\(A(x) = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = 4 \left| f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \right|\).

Given \(f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \left| |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \right|\), so:

\(A(x) = 4 \left| \left| |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right|\).

This expression is a bit complicated, but let's try to simplify it.

Let me define \(s = |\sin(2\pi x)|\), so \(s\) is in [0,1].

Then, \(A(x) = 4 \left| |s - 1/2| - 1/4 \right|\).

Let me analyze this expression as a function of \(s\):

Define \(h(s) = 4 \left| |s - 1/2| - 1/4 \right|\).

Given \(s \in [0,1]\), let's break it down:

First, \(|s - 1/2|\) is a V-shaped function with minimum at \(s = 1/2\), value 0.

Then, subtracting 1/4:

- When \(|s - 1/2| >= 1/4\), \( |s - 1/2| - 1/4 \) is positive or negative.

Wait, actually, \( | |s - 1/2| - 1/4 | \) is the absolute value of \( |s - 1/2| - 1/4 \), so regardless of the sign, it's non-negative.

Therefore, \(h(s)\) is equal to 4 times that.

So, let's compute \(h(s)\) for different ranges of \(s\):

Case 1: \(|s - 1/2| >= 1/4\). Then, \( | |s - 1/2| - 1/4 | = |s - 1/2| - 1/4 \). So, \(h(s) = 4(|s - 1/2| - 1/4) = 4|s - 1/2| - 1\).

Case 2: \(|s - 1/2| < 1/4\). Then, \( | |s - 1/2| - 1/4 | = 1/4 - |s - 1/2| \). So, \(h(s) = 4(1/4 - |s - 1/2|) = 1 - 4|s - 1/2|\).

Therefore, \(h(s)\) is a piecewise function:

- For \(s \in [0, 1/4]\) and \(s \in [3/4, 1]\), \(h(s) = 4|s - 1/2| - 1\).
- For \(s \in (1/4, 3/4)\), \(h(s) = 1 - 4|s - 1/2|\).

Wait, let me verify that:

Wait, \(|s - 1/2| >= 1/4\) when \(s <= 1/4\) or \(s >= 3/4\).

Yes, so in these regions, \(h(s) = 4(|s - 1/2| - 1/4) = 4|s - 1/2| - 1\).

In the middle region, \(s \in (1/4, 3/4)\), \(h(s) = 1 - 4|s - 1/2|\).

So, \(h(s)\) is a piecewise linear function with different slopes in different intervals.

Let me compute \(h(s)\) at specific points:

- At \(s = 0\): \(h(0) = 4(1/2 - 1/4) = 4(1/4) = 1\).
- At \(s = 1/4\): \(h(1/4) = 1 - 4|1/4 - 1/2| = 1 - 4*(1/4) = 1 - 1 = 0\).
- At \(s = 1/2\): \(h(1/2) = 1 - 4*0 = 1\).
- At \(s = 3/4\): \(h(3/4) = 1 - 4|3/4 - 1/2| = 1 - 4*(1/4) = 0.
- At \(s = 1\): \(h(1) = 4(1/2 - 1/4) = 1.

Wait, hold on, that seems interesting.

Wait, at \(s = 0\), \(h(s) = 1\); at \(s = 1/4\), \(h(s) = 0\); at \(s = 1/2\), \(h(s) = 1\); at \(s = 3/4\), \(h(s) = 0\); at \(s = 1\), \(h(s) = 1\).

So, plotting this, \(h(s)\) is a V-shaped function that starts at (0,1), goes down to (1/4,0), up to (1/2,1), down to (3/4,0), and back up to (1,1). So, it's like two triangles overlapping.

Wait, but actually, given the piecewise definitions:

- For \(s \in [0, 1/4]\), \(h(s) = 4|s - 1/2| - 1\). Let me compute this:

At \(s = 0\): \(4*(1/2) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\).

At \(s = 1/4\): \(4*(1/4) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0\).

So, in [0,1/4], it's a line from (0,1) to (1/4,0), which is a downward line.

Similarly, for \(s \in [1/2, 3/4]\), \(h(s) = 4|s - 1/2| - 1\). At \(s = 1/2\), it's 0; at \(s = 3/4\), it's \(4*(1/4) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait.

Wait, no, for \(s >= 3/4\), \(h(s) = 4(s - 1/2) -1\), but wait, let's step back.

Wait, actually, in the earlier breakdown, for \(s \in [0,1/4] \cup [3/4,1]\), \(h(s) = 4|s - 1/2| -1\). So, for \(s >= 3/4\), \(h(s) = 4(s - 1/2) -1\). So, at \(s = 3/4\), it's \(4*(1/4) -1 = 1 -1 = 0\), and at \(s=1\), it's \(4*(1/2) -1 = 2 -1 =1\). So, it's a line from (3/4, 0) to (1,1).

Similarly, for \(s \in [1/4, 1/2)\), \(h(s) = 1 - 4|s - 1/2|\). So, at \(s =1/4\), it's \(1 - 4*(1/4) = 0\); at \(s=1/2\), it's 1.

Therefore, the graph of \(h(s)\) consists of four segments:

1. From (0,1) to (1/4,0): decreasing line with slope -4.
2. From (1/4,0) to (1/2,1): increasing line with slope +4.
3. From (1/2,1) to (3/4,0): decreasing line with slope -4.
4. From (3/4,0) to (1,1): increasing line with slope +4.

So, it's a zig-zag pattern, forming two triangles.

Therefore, \(h(s)\), which is \(A(x)\), is a function that goes from 1 at 0, down to 0 at 1/4, up to 1 at 1/2, down to 0 at 3/4, and up to 1 at 1.

So, it's a periodic function with period 1, oscillating between 0 and 1, with peaks at 0, 1/2, and 1.

So, \(A(x)\) is a piecewise linear function with peaks at x = 0, 1/2, 1, and zeros at x = 1/4, 3/4.

Similarly, let's analyze \(B(y) = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\).

Let me define \(t = |\cos(3\pi y)|\), so \(t \in [0,1]\).

Then, \(B(y) = 4 \left| t - 1/4 \right|\), where \(t = |\cos(3\pi y)|\).

Wait, because \(f(t) = | |t| - 1/2 | = |t - 1/2|\) since \(t >=0\). So, \(f(t) = |t - 1/2|\). Then, \(g(f(t)) = | |t - 1/2| - 1/4 | \), so \(B(y) = 4 | |t - 1/2| - 1/4 | \).

So, \(B(y) = 4 | | |\cos(3\pi y)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 | \).

Simplify this expression, similar to \(A(x)\):

Let me define \(k(s) = 4 | |s - 1/2| - 1/4 | \), where \(s = |\cos(3\pi y)|\), \(s \in [0,1]\).

So, similar to \(h(s)\), \(k(s)\) is a piecewise linear function:

- When \(|s - 1/2| >= 1/4\), \(k(s) = 4(|s - 1/2| - 1/4) = 4|s - 1/2| - 1\).
- When \(|s - 1/2| < 1/4\), \(k(s) = 4(1/4 - |s - 1/2|) = 1 - 4|s - 1/2|\).

So, similar to \(h(s)\), \(k(s)\) has peaks at 0 and 1, and dips at 1/4 and 3/4.

But wait, let me verify:

Wait, \(s = |\cos(3\pi y)|\), so \(s\) is in [0,1], oscillating between 0 and 1 as \(y\) changes.

So, \(k(s)\) is similar to \(h(s)\). So, \(k(s)\) is a function that goes from 1 at \(s=0\), down to 0 at \(s=1/4\), up to 1 at \(s=1/2\), down to 0 at \(s=3/4\), and back up to 1 at \(s=1\).

Therefore, \(B(y)\) is a function that is determined by \(k(s)\), which is similar to \(A(x)\), but with a different argument.

Given that \(s = |\cos(3\pi y)|\), the function \(s\) itself is periodic with period \(2/3\) because \(3\pi y\) has period \(2/3\). So, \(s\) oscillates between 0 and 1 with period \(2/3\).

But since \(y\) is in [0,1], and \(s\) is periodic, \(s(y)\) will complete 3/2 oscillations over [0,1]. Because over [0,1], \(y\) goes from 0 to 1, so \(3\pi y\) goes from 0 to \(3\pi\), which is 1.5 periods of cosine.

Therefore, \(s(y) = |\cos(3\pi y)|\) will go from 1 down to 0 at \(y = 1/6\), back to 1 at \(y = 1/3\), down to 0 at \(y = 1/2\), back to 1 at \(y = 2/3\), down to 0 at \(y = 5/6\), and back to 1 at \(y =1\).

Wait, let me compute specific points:

- At \(y=0\): \(s = |\cos(0)| = 1\).
- At \(y=1/6\): \(3\pi y = \pi/2\), so \(s = |\cos(\pi/2)| = 0\).
- At \(y=1/3\): \(3\pi y = \pi\), so \(s = |\cos(\pi)| = 1.
- At \(y=1/2\): \(3\pi y = 3\pi/2\), \(s = |\cos(3\pi/2)| = 0.
- At \(y=2/3\): \(3\pi y = 2\pi\), \(s = |\cos(2\pi)| = 1.
- At \(y=5/6\): \(3\pi y = 5\pi/2\), \(s = |\cos(5\pi/2)| = 0.
- At \(y=1\): \(3\pi y = 3\pi\), \(s = |\cos(3\pi)| = 1.

So, yes, \(s(y)\) is a function that oscillates between 1 and 0 three times over [0,1], peaking at 1 and troughing at 0.

Therefore, \(k(s(y))\) is also a function that oscillates between 1 and 0 three times, but transformed by \(k(s)\).

But since \(k(s)\) is similar to \(h(s)\), with peaks at 0 and 1, and troughs at 1/4 and 3/4, we can expect \(B(y)\) to have similar behavior.

But since \(s(y)\) is itself oscillating between 0 and 1, \(k(s(y))\) will have more complex behavior.

So, putting it all together, \(B(y)\) is a function that starts at 1 when \(y=0\), then goes down to 0 when \(s(y)\) reaches 1/4, which happens at some points, then goes back up to 1, etc.

But since \(s(y)\) is a periodic function with three peaks in [0,1], \(B(y)\) will also have a complicated oscillating behavior, but perhaps with more oscillations.

But perhaps instead of trying to plot it, I can think about how \(A(x)\) and \(B(y)\) behave and how they can intersect.

Given that both \(A(x)\) and \(B(y)\) are in [0,1], and each has their own periodicity, the composition \(B(A(x))\) will have a period that is the least common multiple of the periods of \(A(x)\) and \(B(y)\).

Wait, \(A(x)\) has period 1, and \(B(y)\) has period \(2/3\). The LCM of 1 and \(2/3\) is 2/3, since 1 = 3/3, and 2/3 is the larger denominator.

Therefore, \(B(A(x))\) will have period \(2/3\). Therefore, in the interval [0,1], \(B(A(x))\) will complete \(1 / (2/3) = 3/2\) periods.

Therefore, \(B(A(x))\) will oscillate 1.5 times over [0,1].

Similarly, \(A(x)\) itself oscillates once over [0,1].

Therefore, the composition \(B(A(x))\) is more oscillatory.

So, now, going back to the equation \(x = B(A(x))\), which is \(x = B(A(x))\), we're looking for fixed points of this function.

In order to find the number of solutions, maybe I can consider how \(x\) and \(B(A(x))\) behave.

First, let's note that \(A(x)\) is a function that goes from 1 to 0 at 1/4, back to 1 at 1/2, down to 0 at 3/4, and back to 1 at 1.

So, \(A(x)\) is a function that has peaks at x=0, 1/2, 1, and zeros at x=1/4, 3/4.

Then, \(B(A(x))\) is \(4g(f(\cos(3\pi A(x))))\). Let's analyze this.

Given that \(A(x)\) is a function from [0,1] to [0,1], then \(f(\cos(3\pi A(x))) = \left| |\cos(3\pi A(x))| - 1/2 \right|\).

But wait, actually, \(B(y)\) is \(4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))\), so \(B(A(x)) = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi A(x))))\).

So, similar to \(A(x)\), \(B(A(x))\) is a composition of functions that transform the input through absolute values and linear operations.

But perhaps it's too convoluted. Maybe instead of trying to compute it symbolically, I can consider the behavior of \(B(A(x))\) in relation to \(x\).

Given that both \(A(x)\) and \(B(A(x))\) map [0,1] to [0,1], and that \(A(x)\) has a certain oscillatory behavior, \(B(A(x))\) will have a more complex oscillatory behavior, but still within [0,1].

Therefore, the equation \(x = B(A(x))\) is asking where the function \(B(A(x))\) intersects the line \(y = x\). Each intersection corresponds to a solution.

Given that both functions are within [0,1], and \(B(A(x))\) is oscillating, it's likely that there are multiple intersections.

But how many exactly?

To count the number of intersections, I can consider the number of times \(B(A(x))\) crosses the line \(y = x\).

Given that \(B(A(x))\) is a composition of periodic functions, it might cross the line \(y = x\) multiple times.

But to be precise, maybe I can consider the number of extrema in \(B(A(x))\), as each extremum could potentially lead to a crossing.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the number of solutions by considering the number of times \(A(x)\) and \(B^{-1}(x)\) intersect, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another idea: since \(x = B(A(x))\), let me consider the function \(F(x) = B(A(x)) - x\). The number of zeros of \(F(x)\) is the number of solutions.

To find the number of zeros, I can analyze the behavior of \(F(x)\) over [0,1].

First, let's compute \(F(0)\):

- \(A(0) = 4g(f(\sin(0))) = 4g(f(0)) = 4g(1/2) = 4*(1/4) = 1\).
- Then, \(B(A(0)) = B(1) = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi*1))) = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi))) = 4g(f(-1)) = 4g(1/2) = 1.
- Therefore, \(F(0) = B(A(0)) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1 > 0\).

Similarly, \(F(1)\):

- \(A(1) = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi*1))) = 4g(f(0)) = 1.
- \(B(A(1)) = B(1) = 1, as before.
- So, \(F(1) = 1 - 1 = 0\).

So, at x=1, \(F(1) = 0\), which is one solution.

At x=0, \(F(0) = 1\), so positive.

Now, let's check at x=1/4:

- \(A(1/4) = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi*(1/4)))) = 4g(f(\sin(\pi/2))) = 4g(1) = 4*(0) = 0.
- Then, \(B(A(1/4)) = B(0) = 4g(f(\cos(0))) = 4g(f(1)) = 4g(1/2) = 1.
- So, \(F(1/4) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 > 0\).

At x=1/2:

- \(A(1/2) = 4g(f(\sin(\pi))) = 4g(f(0)) = 1.
- \(B(A(1/2)) = 1, so \(F(1/2) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 > 0\).

At x=3/4:

- \(A(3/4) = 4g(f(\sin(3\pi/2))) = 4g(f(-1)) = 4g(1/2) = 1.
- Then, \(B(A(3/4)) = 1, so \(F(3/4) = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 > 0\).

At x=1/8:

- \(A(1/8) = 4g(f(\sin(\pi/4))) = 4g(f(\sqrt{2}/2)) = 4g(|\sqrt{2}/2| - 1/2) = 4g( (sqrt(2)/2 - 1/2) )\).
Wait, hold on. Let me compute step by step.

Compute \(A(1/8)\):

1. \(\sin(2\pi*(1/8)) = \sin(\pi/4) = \sqrt{2}/2 \approx 0.707\).
2. \(f(\sqrt{2}/2) = | |\sqrt{2}/2| - 1/2 | = | \sqrt{2}/2 - 1/2 | \approx |0.707 - 0.5| = 0.207\).
3. \(g(0.207) = |0.207 - 1/4| = |0.207 - 0.25| = 0.043.
4. \(A(1/8) = 4*0.043 ≈ 0.172\).

Then, compute \(B(A(1/8)) = B(0.172)\):

1. \(f(\cos(3\pi*0.172))\):

First, compute \(\cos(3\pi*0.172) ≈ \cos(1.65) ≈ -0.096\).

So, \(f(-0.096) = | |-0.096| - 1/2 | = |0.096 - 0.5| = | -0.404 | = 0.404.

Then, \(g(0.404) = |0.404 - 1/4| = |0.404 - 0.25| = 0.154.

So, \(B(0.172) = 4*0.154 ≈ 0.616\).

Therefore, \(F(1/8) = 0.616 - 0.125 ≈ 0.491 > 0\).

Similarly, at x=1/8, \(F(x) ≈ 0.491 > 0\).

Hmm, so at x=0, F=1; at x=1/8, F≈0.491; at x=1/4, F=0.75; at x=1/2, F=0.5; at x=3/4, F=0.25; at x=1, F=0.

Wait, that seems inconsistent because at x=1/4, F=0.75, which is higher than at x=1/8.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-examine.

At x=1/8:

- \(A(1/8)\) was calculated as ≈0.172, which is correct.

Then, \(B(0.172)\):

Compute \(f(\cos(3\pi * 0.172))\).

First, \(3\pi * 0.172 ≈ 1.65\), \(\cos(1.65) ≈ -0.096\), so absolute value is 0.096.

Then, \(f(0.096) = |0.096 - 0.5| = 0.404.

Then, \(g(0.404) = |0.404 - 0.25| = 0.154.

Then, \(B(0.172) = 4*0.154 ≈ 0.616\).

Therefore, \(F(1/8) = B(A(1/8)) - 1/8 ≈ 0.616 - 0.125 ≈ 0.491 > 0\).

Similarly, at x=1/4:

- \(A(1/4) = 0\), so \(B(A(1/4)) = B(0) = 1\), so \(F(1/4) = 1 - 1/4 = 0.75 > 0\).

Wait, but at x=1/4, A(x)=0, so B(A(x))=B(0)=1.

Therefore, the function \(F(x)\) at x=1/4 is 1 - 1/4 = 0.75.

Wait, so as x increases from 0 to 1/4, \(A(x)\) goes from 1 to 0, so \(B(A(x))\) goes from 1 to 1, but with a dip?

Wait, no, \(A(x)\) goes from 1 to 0 at x=1/4, so B(A(x)) goes from B(1) = 1 to B(0) = 1. But \(B(A(x))\) is a composition, so it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps my earlier reasoning is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider how \(B(A(x))\) behaves when x increases from 0 to 1.

Given that \(A(x)\) starts at 1, goes down to 0 at x=1/4, then back to 1 at x=1/2, down to 0 at x=3/4, and back to 1 at x=1.

Therefore, \(A(x)\) is oscillating between 1 and 0 three times over [0,1].

Then, \(B(A(x))\) is \(4g(f(\cos(3\pi A(x))))\).

Since \(A(x)\) is between 0 and 1, \(f(\cos(3\pi A(x)))\) is between 0 and 1/2.

Wait, because \(f(t) = | |t| - 1/2 | \leq 1/2\), as we saw earlier.

Therefore, \(g(f(\cos(3\pi A(x))))\) is between 0 and 1/4.

Therefore, \(B(A(x)) = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi A(x))))\) is between 0 and 1.

So, in effect, \(B(A(x))\) is a function that is oscillating between 0 and 1.

But since \(A(x)\) itself is oscillating between 0 and 1, and \(B(y)\) is another oscillating function, \(B(A(x))\) is a composition of oscillations, leading to a function with more oscillations.

Wait, since \(A(x)\) has three main oscillations (peaks at 0, 1/2, 1), and \(B(y)\) has oscillations based on \(y\), which is \(A(x)\).

Therefore, \(B(A(x))\) will have oscillations modulated by \(A(x)\), leading to a higher frequency.

But this is getting too abstract.

Perhaps it's better to consider graphically.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of times \(B(A(x))\) can cross the line \(y = x\). Since \(B(A(x))\) is oscillating between 0 and 1, and \(y = x\) is a straight line from (0,0) to (1,1).

Given that both functions start at (0,1) and end at (1,1), but in between, \(B(A(x))\) oscillates, so it might cross the line \(y = x\) several times.

But how many?

Wait, let me think about how many times \(B(A(x))\) can cross \(y = x\). Each oscillation could potentially cross the line twice, but given the specific nature of these functions, maybe it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that \(A(x)\) is a piecewise linear function with known crossings and \(B(y)\) is similar, so their composition could lead to multiple intersections.

But perhaps I can consider that each oscillation in \(B(A(x))\) can lead to two intersections with \(y = x\), except at the extremes.

Since \(B(A(x))\) is oscillating between 0 and 1, and \(y = x\) is a straight line from 0 to 1, with a slope of 1.

So, when \(B(A(x))\) is decreasing, it might cross \(y = x\) once, and when it's increasing, it might cross once as well.

Given that \(B(A(x))\) is oscillating, perhaps each peak and trough could lead to two crossings.

But since \(B(A(x))\) is a composition, how many oscillations does it have?

Earlier, I thought \(B(A(x))\) has a period of 2/3 over [0,1], so 3/2 periods. Therefore, it's going up and down 1.5 times.

Therefore, starting from 1 at x=0, going down to 0 at x=1/4, back to 1 at x=1/2, down to 0 at x=3/4, and back to 1 at x=1.

So, in this case, \(B(A(x))\) is oscillating 1.5 times, starting and ending at 1.

Therefore, each oscillation (each "up" and "down") could potentially cross \(y = x\) twice.

But let's see:

From x=0 to x=1/4: \(B(A(x))\) goes from 1 to 0. Since \(y = x\) is increasing from 0 to 1/4, in this interval, \(B(A(x))\) starts above \(y = x\) (1 > 0) and goes below \(y = x\) (0 < 1/4). Therefore, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one crossing in this interval.

Similarly, from x=1/4 to x=1/2: \(B(A(x))\) goes from 0 back to 1. Here, \(y = x\) goes from 1/4 to 1/2. So, \(B(A(x))\) starts below \(y = x\) (0 < 1/4) and goes above \(y = x\) (1 > 1/2). Therefore, there must be at least one crossing in this interval.

From x=1/2 to x=3/4: \(B(A(x))\) goes from 1 down to 0. \(y = x\) goes from 1/2 to 3/4. So, \(B(A(x))\) starts above \(y = x\) (1 > 1/2) and goes below \(y = x\) (0 < 3/4). Therefore, another crossing.

From x=3/4 to x=1: \(B(A(x))\) goes from 0 back to 1. \(y = x\) goes from 3/4 to 1. So, \(B(A(x))\) starts below \(y = x\) (0 < 3/4) and goes above \(y = x\) (1 > 1). Wait, at x=1, both are equal to 1. So, is x=1 a crossing?

Wait, at x=1, both \(B(A(1)) = 1\) and \(y = x = 1\), so that's a point of intersection.

But in the interval x=3/4 to 1, \(B(A(x))\) goes from 0 to 1, while \(y = x\) goes from 3/4 to 1.

So, at x=3/4, \(B(A(3/4)) = 1\), and \(y = 3/4\). So, \(B(A(3/4)) = 1 > 3/4\). At x=1, both are 1. So, does \(B(A(x))\) cross \(y = x\) in this interval?

At x=3/4, \(B(A(x)) = 1 > 3/4\). As x increases to 1, \(B(A(x))\) decreases to 1? Wait, no, \(B(A(x))\) goes from 0 at x=3/4 to 1 at x=1. So, it's increasing from 0 to 1.

Meanwhile, \(y = x\) is increasing from 3/4 to 1.

So, in this interval, \(B(A(x))\) starts below \(y = x\) (0 < 3/4) and ends at the same value (1 = 1). So, it must cross \(y = x\) exactly once in this interval.

Therefore, in total, we have crossings in each of the four intervals:

1. x=0 to x=1/4: 1 crossing.
2. x=1/4 to x=1/2: 1 crossing.
3. x=1/2 to x=3/4: 1 crossing.
4. x=3/4 to x=1: 1 crossing.

Wait, but at x=1, both functions meet at (1,1), so that's one solution.

Wait, but in the last interval, from x=3/4 to 1, we had that \(B(A(x))\) starts at 0, goes up to 1, while \(y = x\) goes from 3/4 to 1.

So, at x=3/4, \(B(A(x)) = 1\) and \(y = 3/4\). So, \(B(A(x))\) is above \(y = x\) here. Then, as x approaches 1, both approach 1.

So, from x=3/4 to x=1, \(B(A(x))\) is above \(y = x\) at x=3/4, and they both meet at x=1. Therefore, is there a crossing in between?

Wait, at x=1, they meet, but is it a crossing or just a touchpoint?

At x=1, \(B(A(1)) = 1\) and \(y = x = 1\). So, it's a touchpoint, not necessarily a crossing.

But to know if \(B(A(x))\) crosses \(y = x\) in the interval (3/4, 1), we can check at some point in the middle.

Let me pick x=0.9:

- \(A(0.9)\): \(A(0.9) = 4g(f(\sin(1.8\pi)))\).

Compute \(\sin(1.8\pi) = \sin(3\pi/5 + 0.8\pi) = \sin(1.8\pi)\). Wait, 1.8π is 3π - 0.2π, which is in the fourth quadrant.

\(\sin(1.8\pi) = \sin(\pi - 0.2\pi) = -\sin(0.2\pi)\). So, approximately, \(\sin(0.2\pi) \approx 0.5878\), so \(\sin(1.8\pi) \approx -0.5878\).

Therefore, \(f(\sin(1.8\pi)) = | | -0.5878 | - 1/2 | = |0.5878 - 0.5| = 0.0878\).

Then, \(g(0.0878) = |0.0878 - 1/4| = |0.0878 - 0.25| = 0.1622\).

Therefore, \(A(0.9) = 4*0.1622 ≈ 0.6488\).

Then, \(B(A(0.9)) = B(0.6488)\).

Compute \(B(0.6488) = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi*0.6488)))\).

First, compute \(3\pi*0.6488 ≈ 6.196\).

\(\cos(6.196) ≈ \cos(6.196 - 2π) ≈ \cos(6.196 - 6.283) ≈ \cos(-0.087) ≈ \cos(0.087) ≈ 0.996\).

So, \(\cos(3\pi*0.6488) ≈ 0.996\).

Then, \(f(0.996) = |0.996 - 1/2| = |0.996 - 0.5| = 0.496.

Then, \(g(0.496) = |0.496 - 1/4| = |0.496 - 0.25| = 0.246.

So, \(B(0.6488) = 4*0.246 ≈ 0.984\).

Therefore, \(F(0.9) = 0.984 - 0.9 ≈ 0.084 > 0\).

So, at x=0.9, \(F(x) ≈ 0.084 > 0\).

At x=1, \(F(1) = 0\).

So, in the interval (0.75, 1), \(F(x)\) goes from 0.984 - 0.75 ≈ 0.234 at x=0.75, to 0.984 - 0.9 ≈ 0.084 at x=0.9, and 0 at x=1.

Wait, but earlier, at x=0.9, \(F(x) ≈ 0.084\), which is positive.

So, \(F(x)\) starts at x=0.75 with \(F(0.75) = 0.616 - 0.75 = -0.134\).

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, at x=0.75, \(A(0.75) = 1\), so \(B(A(0.75)) = B(1) = 1\), so \(F(0.75) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25\). Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, no, \(F(x) = B(A(x)) - x\). So, at x=0.75, \(B(A(0.75)) = 1\), so \(F(0.75) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 > 0\).

Wait, this is conflicting with my previous statement where I thought \(F(0.75) = -0.134\). I must have made an error.

Wait, let me recompute \(F(0.75)\):

- \(A(0.75) = 4g(f(\sin(3\pi*0.75))) = 4g(f(\sin(2.25\pi))) = 4g(f(0)) = 4g(1/2) = 1\).
- \(B(A(0.75)) = B(1) = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi*1))) = 4g(f(-1)) = 4g(1/2) = 1.
- So, \(F(0.75) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 > 0\).

Similarly, at x=0.75, \(F(x) = 0.25\).

Earlier, at x=0.9, \(F(x) ≈ 0.084 > 0\), and at x=1, \(F(x) = 0\).

So, in the interval x=0.75 to x=1, \(F(x)\) goes from 0.25 to 0, passing through 0 at x=1. So, it's always positive except at x=1, where it's zero.

Wait, so in this interval, does \(F(x)\) cross zero?

At x=1, it's zero, but from x=0.75 to x=1, it starts at 0.25 and decreases to 0. So, it just touches zero at x=1.

Therefore, in this interval, there's only one crossing at x=1.

So, in total:

1. x=0 to x=1/4: one crossing.
2. x=1/4 to x=1/2: one crossing.
3. x=1/2 to x=3/4: one crossing.
4. x=3/4 to x=1: one crossing.

But at x=1, F(x)=0, so that's a crossing, but it's at the endpoint.

Wait, so each interval x=0 to 1/4, 1/4 to 1/2, 1/2 to 3/4, 3/4 to 1, each contributes one crossing.

Therefore, total number of crossings is 4.

However, at x=1, it's a crossing, but since it's the endpoint, is it counted as a crossing?

In the problem statement, we are to find the number of intersections, which includes all points where the curves meet. So, x=1 is a valid solution, but depending on whether we count endpoints as intersections.

But in the system given, both x and y are in [0,1], so x=1 is a valid point of intersection.

Therefore, in each of the four intervals, we have one crossing, so total crossings are 4.

But wait, let me verify.

Wait, at x=1/4, \(F(1/4) = 1 - 1/4 = 0.75 > 0\).

At x=1/2, \(F(1/2) = 1 - 1/2 = 0.5 > 0\).

At x=3/4, \(F(3/4) = 1 - 3/4 = 0.25 > 0\).

So, in each interval between 0 and 1/4, 1/4 and 1/2, 1/2 and 3/4, 3/4 and 1, \(F(x)\) is positive at the start and ends at 0 or positive at the end.

Wait, so in each interval, \(F(x)\) starts positive and goes to 0 or stays positive.

Wait, that would imply that \(F(x)\) only crosses zero once in each interval.

Wait, but in the interval x=3/4 to 1, \(F(x)\) starts at 0.25 and goes to 0, so it's always positive except at x=1, where it's zero.

Therefore, in each interval, it crosses zero once.

But wait, at x=1/4, the function \(F(x)\) is 0.75, which is above zero, and then it goes to 0.5 at x=1/2.

Wait, but in each interval, from x=0 to 1/4, x=1/4 to 1/2, x=1/2 to 3/4, and x=3/4 to 1, \(F(x)\) is positive at the start and remains positive or only touches zero at the end.

Therefore, does that mean that each interval has one crossing?

Wait, no, actually, in the interval x=0 to 1/4, \(F(x)\) starts at 1 and goes down to 0.75, which is still positive, so it doesn't cross zero. Wait, but at x=0, F(x)=1, and at x=1/4, F(x)=0.75, which is positive. So, it doesn't cross zero.

Wait, so maybe my earlier reasoning was incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the crossings occur in other intervals.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the derivative or the behavior of \(F(x)\).

Wait, maybe it's better to graphically imagine how \(B(A(x))\) behaves.

Since \(B(A(x))\) is a composition of functions, it might oscillate multiple times, crossing \(y = x\) several times.

But given that it's a composition, perhaps each oscillation could result in two crossings.

Alternatively, considering that \(B(A(x))\) is a function with 3 peaks and 3 troughs over [0,1], it might cross the line \(y = x\) multiple times.

Wait, actually, in my earlier reasoning, I considered that \(B(A(x))\) has 1.5 periods over [0,1], so 1.5 oscillations.

Each oscillation could potentially cross the line \(y = x\) twice, once on the rising slope and once on the falling slope.

Therefore, with 1.5 oscillations, we might have 3 crossings.

But wait, at x=1, it's a touchpoint, so maybe 3 crossings.

Alternatively, let's think about the number of times \(B(A(x))\) can go above and below \(y = x\).

Wait, \(B(A(x))\) starts at 1, goes down to 0 at x=1/4, up to 1 at x=1/2, down to 0 at x=3/4, and up to 1 at x=1.

Meanwhile, \(y = x\) is a straight line from 0 to 1.

Therefore, between x=0 and 1/4: \(B(A(x))\) is above y=x (1 > 0, 0.75 > 1/4, 0.5 > 1/2? Wait, at x=1/2, \(B(A(x)) = 1\), which is above y=x=0.5.

Wait, maybe it's better to see in each interval.

Wait, perhaps plotting \(B(A(x))\) against \(y = x\):

1. From x=0 to x=1/4:

   - \(B(A(x))\) goes from 1 to 0.
   - \(y = x\) goes from 0 to 1/4.
   - So, \(B(A(x))\) starts above \(y = x\) and ends below \(y = x\).
   - Therefore, by Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a crossing in this interval.

2. From x=1/4 to x=1/2:

   - \(B(A(x))\) goes from 0 to 1.
   - \(y = x\) goes from 1/4 to 1/2.
   - So, \(B(A(x))\) starts below \(y = x\) (0 < 1/4) and ends above \(y = x\) (1 > 1/2).
   - Therefore, another crossing in this interval.

3. From x=1/2 to x=3/4:

   - \(B(A(x))\) goes from 1 to 0.
   - \(y = x\) goes from 1/2 to 3/4.
   - So, \(B(A(x))\) starts above \(y = x\) (1 > 1/2) and ends below \(y = x\) (0 < 3/4).
   - Therefore, another crossing in this interval.

4. From x=3/4 to x=1:

   - \(B(A(x))\) goes from 0 to 1.
   - \(y = x\) goes from 3/4 to 1.
   - So, \(B(A(x))\) starts below \(y = x\) (0 < 3/4) and ends equal to \(y = x\) at x=1.
   - Therefore, another crossing in this interval.

So, in each interval, there is exactly one crossing.

Therefore, total number of crossings is 4.

But at x=1, it's a crossing, but since it's the endpoint, perhaps it's considered a single solution.

But in each of the four intervals between 0-1/4, 1/4-1/2, 1/2-3/4, 3/4-1, we have one crossing each, so 4 crossings.

Therefore, the number of intersection points is 4.

Wait, but earlier, when I computed \(F(1/8) ≈ 0.491 > 0\), \(F(1/4) = 0.75 > 0\), \(F(1/2) = 0.5 > 0\), \(F(3/4) = 0.25 > 0\), and \(F(1) = 0\). So, it seems that at x=1, the function meets, but in between, the function \(F(x)\) is positive.

Wait, perhaps my initial analysis is conflicting with the step-by-step interval analysis.

Wait, to clarify, perhaps it's better to note that \(B(A(x))\) is oscillating four times over [0,1], crossing \(y = x\) each time.

Therefore, the number of intersections is 4.

But in reality, \(B(A(x))\) is a composition function with multiple oscillations, each potentially causing two crossings.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the number of times \(B(A(x))\) crosses \(y = x\) as the number of solutions, which is 4.

But in my earlier analysis, each interval gives one crossing, so total 4.

But in the interval from x=3/4 to 1, \(F(x)\) starts at 0.25 and decreases to 0, so it's positive throughout, except at x=1 where it's zero. So, is that considered as a crossing?

Well, if you consider the entire interval [3/4,1], \(F(x)\) is positive at x=3/4 (0.25) and decreases to 0 at x=1. So, it touches zero at x=1 but doesn't cross it.

Therefore, in that interval, is there a crossing?

In calculus, a crossing is when the function goes from positive to negative or vice versa. If it only touches zero at the endpoint, it's not considered a crossing in the interior.

Therefore, in each interval:

1. [0,1/4]: crosses once.
2. [1/4,1/2]: crosses once.
3. [1/2,3/4]: crosses once.
4. [3/4,1]: does not cross, just touches at x=1.

Therefore, total number of crossings is 3.

But wait, at x=1, it's a solution, but it's only a touchpoint, not a crossing.

So, in terms of crossings (transverse intersections), it's 3.

But in terms of solutions, x=1 is a solution as well.

Therefore, depending on the definition, if we count x=1 as a solution, it's 4; if not, it's 3.

But in the problem, it's asking for the number of intersections, which includes all points where the curves meet, regardless of crossing or not.

Therefore, in the interval [0,1], \(B(A(x))\) and \(y = x\) meet at 4 points: one in each interval [0,1/4), [1/4,1/2), [1/2,3/4), and [3/4,1).

Wait, but earlier, in [3/4,1), \(F(x)\) starts at 0.25 and goes to 0, so it must cross zero once? Wait, no, because it starts at 0.25 and ends at 0, without crossing zero in between.

Wait, is there a crossing in [3/4,1)?

Wait, at x=3/4, F(x) = 0.25.

At x=0.9, F(x) ≈ 0.084.

At x=0.95:

- \(A(0.95)\): \(\sin(2\pi*0.95) ≈ \sin(1.9\pi) ≈ \sin(\pi + 0.9\pi) ≈ -\sin(0.9\pi) ≈ -0.3090\).

So, \(f(\sin(1.9\pi)) = | | -0.3090 | - 1/2 | = |0.3090 - 0.5| = 0.191.

Then, \(g(0.191) = |0.191 - 1/4| = |0.191 - 0.25| = 0.059.

So, \(A(0.95) ≈ 4*0.059 ≈ 0.236.

Then, \(B(A(0.95)) = B(0.236)\).

Compute \(B(0.236)\):

First, \(f(\cos(3\pi*0.236))\).

\(3\pi*0.236 ≈ 0.708\pi ≈ 2.220.

\(\cos(2.220) ≈ -0.529.

So, \(f(-0.529) = | | -0.529 | - 1/2 | = |0.529 - 0.5| = 0.029.

Then, \(g(0.029) = |0.029 - 0.25| = 0.221.

So, \(B(0.236) = 4*0.221 ≈ 0.884.

Therefore, \(F(0.95) = 0.884 - 0.95 ≈ -0.066 < 0\).

So, at x=0.95, \(F(x) ≈ -0.066\).

But at x=0.9, \(F(x) ≈ 0.084\).

So, between x=0.9 and x=0.95, \(F(x)\) goes from positive to negative, implying a crossing in that interval.

Therefore, in the interval [3/4, 1), \(F(x)\) crosses zero once.

Thus, in total, each interval [0,1/4], [1/4,1/2], [1/2,3/4], and [3/4,1) contains exactly one crossing.

Therefore, total number of crossings is 4.

Hence, the number of intersection points is 4.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{4}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{4}
</think>

To find the number of intersections of the graphs of the given functions, we analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), and then consider the composition of these functions in the given equations.

The functions are:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]

We need to solve the system of equations:
\[ y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

First, we analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). Both functions are periodic and piecewise linear, with oscillations between 0 and 1. 

Next, we consider the compositions:
1. \( A(x) = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
2. \( B(y) = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)

We find that \( A(x) \) and \( B(y) \) both oscillate between 0 and 1 with different periods. \( A(x) \) has a period of 1, while \( B(y) \) has a period of \( \frac{2}{3} \).

To find the number of intersections, we need to solve the equation \( x = B(A(x)) \). Given the periodicity and oscillations, we analyze the function \( F(x) = B(A(x)) - x \) over the interval [0,1].

By evaluating \( F(x) \) at key points and considering the oscillations, we determine that \( F(x) \) crosses the line \( y = x \) four times. Each interval [0, 1/4], [1/4, 1/2], [1/2, 3/4], and [3/4, 1] contains exactly one crossing.

Thus, the number of intersection points is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]
