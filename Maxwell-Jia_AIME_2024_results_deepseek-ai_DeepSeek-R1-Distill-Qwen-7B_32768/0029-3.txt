Question:
Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

Correct Answer:
Note that $n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ means $\text{ord}_{p}(n) = 8 \mid p-1.$ The smallest prime that does this is $17$ and $2^4 + 1 = 17$ for example. Now let $g$ be a primitive root of $17^2.$ The satisfying $n$ are of the form, $g^{\frac{p(p-1)}{8}}, g^{3\frac{p(p-1)}{8}}, g^{5\frac{p(p-1)}{8}}, g^{7\frac{p(p-1)}{8}}.$ So if we find one such $n$, then all $n$ are $n, n^3, n^5, n^7.$ Consider the $2$ from before. Note $17^2 \mid 2^{4 \cdot 17} + 1$ by LTE. Hence the possible $n$ are, $2^{17}, 2^{51}, 2^{85}, 2^{119}.$ Some modular arithmetic yields that $2^{51} \equiv \boxed{110}$ is the least value.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the least prime number \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, I also need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try breaking it down.

First, I remember that if \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \), then \( p \) must divide \( n^4 + 1 \) as well. So, maybe I should start by looking into primes \( p \) for which \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) has a solution. Then, perhaps check if that solution can be lifted to modulo \( p^2 \).

I also recall that primes for which -1 is a quartic residue (i.e., there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \)) are primes where 4 divides \( p-1 \), because the multiplicative order of -1 should divide \( (p-1)/2 \). Wait, let me think. The multiplicative group modulo \( p \) is cyclic of order \( p-1 \), so the equation \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) would have solutions if and only if the order of \( -1 \) divides \( (p-1)/4 \). Hmm, maybe I need to check the order of -1 modulo \( p \).

Alternatively, since \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \), then \( x^8 \equiv 1 \mod p \), so the order of \( x \) modulo \( p \) must divide 8. Therefore, the multiplicative order of \( x \) is 8, which implies that 8 divides \( p-1 \). Hence, \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \). So, primes \( p \) must be congruent to 1 modulo 8. So, the smallest primes like that are 17, 97, etc. Wait, but 17 is quite big. Maybe I need to check smaller primes and see if \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Wait, hold on. Maybe it's not necessarily 8, but let's think again. If \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \), then \( x^8 \equiv 1 \mod p \). So, the multiplicative order of \( x \) modulo \( p \) is 8, which implies 8 divides \( p-1 \). So, \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \). Therefore, primes like 17, 97, 113, etc. So, 17 is the smallest prime congruent to 1 mod 8.

But maybe other primes can satisfy the condition where \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Maybe some primes where 4 divides \( p-1 \), but not necessarily 8? Let me think. Suppose that \( p \) is a prime where \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) has a solution. Then, if \( p \) is 1 mod 4, but not necessarily 1 mod 8. For example, primes like 5, 13, 17, etc.

Wait, I should check for primes where \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) is solvable. Let's check small primes:

- For \( p = 2 \): \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 + 1 = 1 \mod 2 \). So, not divisible by 2.

- \( p = 3 \): Let's see, \( n^4 \mod 3 \). Since \( n \) can be 0,1,2 mod 3. \( 0^4=0 \), \( 1^4=1 \), \( 2^4=16 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \). So, \( n^4 \equiv 0 \) or 1 mod 3. So, \( n^4 +1 \equiv 1 \) or 2 mod 3. Never 0. So, no solution.

- \( p = 5 \): Let's compute \( n^4 \mod 5 \). \( n \) from 0 to 4:

  - 0: 0
  - 1: 1
  - 2: 16 ≡ 1
  - 3: 81 ≡ 1
  - 4: 256 ≡ 1

  So, \( n^4 \) mod 5 is either 0 or 1. Hence, \( n^4 +1 \) is either 1 or 2 mod 5. So, no solution.

- \( p = 7 \): Let's compute \( n^4 \mod 7 \). \( n \) from 0 to 6:

  - 0: 0
  - 1: 1
  - 2: 16 ≡ 2
  - 3: 81 ≡ 4
  - 4: 256 ≡ 4
  - 5: 625 ≡ 2
  - 6: 1296 ≡ 1

  So, \( n^4 \) mod 7 gives 0,1,2,4. So, \( n^4 +1 \) is 1,2,3,5 mod 7. So, 1,2,3,5. So, 3 is present, but 0 is not. So, no solution.

- \( p = 11 \): Let's compute \( n^4 \mod 11 \). \( n \) from 0 to 10:

  Calculating each:

  - 0: 0
  - 1: 1
  - 2: 16
  - 3: 81 ≡ 4
  - 4: 256 ≡ 3
  - 5: 625 ≡ 10
  - 6: 1296 ≡ 1296 - 117*11=1296-1287=9
  - 7: 2401 ≡ 2401 - 218*11=2401-2398=3
  - 8: 4096 ≡ 4096 - 372*11=4096-4092=4
  - 9: 6561 ≡ 6561 - 596*11=6561-6556=5
  - 10: 10000 ≡ 10000 - 909*11=10000-9999=1

  So, \( n^4 \) mod 11: 0,1,3,4,5,9,10. So, \( n^4 +1 \) mod 11 is 1,2,4,5,6,10,0. Wait, 0! So, when \( n=5 \), \( 5^4 = 625 ≡ 10 \mod 11 \), so \( 5^4 +1 = 10 +1 =11 ≡0 \mod 11 \). So, \( n=5 \) is a solution for \( p=11 \). So, 11 divides \( 5^4 +1 \).

But does \( 11^2 \) divide \( 5^4 +1 \)? Let's compute \( 5^4 +1 = 625 +1 = 626 \). Then, 626 divided by 121 (11^2) is 626 / 121 ≈ 5.17. So, 121 * 5 = 605, 626 - 605 = 21. So, 626 = 121*5 +21, so remainder 21. So, 11^2 does not divide 626.

So, 11 is a prime where \( n^4 +1 \) is divisible by 11, but not by 11 squared. So, maybe we need a larger prime.

Wait, but let me check \( p = 17 \). Earlier, I thought primes congruent to 1 mod 8. Let me check if \( n^4 +1 \) is divisible by 17^2.

First, check if there exists \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 17 \).

Compute \( n^4 \mod 17 \):

I can compute powers:

1^4=1; 2^4=16; 3^4=81≡13; 4^4=256≡1; 5^4=625≡625-36*17=625-612=13; 6^4=1296≡1296-76*17=1296-1292=4; 7^4=2401≡2401-141*17=2401-2397=4; 8^4=4096≡4096-241*17=4096-4097=-1≡16; 9^4=6561≡6561-385*17=6561-6545=16; 10^4=10000≡10000-588*17=10000-9996=4; 11^4=14641≡14641-861*17=14641-14637=4; 12^4=20736≡20736-1219*17=20736-20723=13; 13^4=28561≡28561-1680*17=28561-28560=1; 14^4=38416≡38416-2260*17=38416-38420=-4≡13; 15^4=50625≡50625-2978*17=50625-50626=-1≡16; 16^4=65536≡65536-3855*17=65536-65535=1.

So, \( n^4 \mod 17 \) gives: 1,16,13,1,13,4,4,16,16,4,4,13,1,13,16,16,1.

Looking for \( n^4 ≡ -1 mod 17 \). Since -1 mod 17 is 16. So, does 16 appear in the list? Yes, for n=2,8,9,15. So, n=2: 2^4=16≡-1 mod17. So, n=2 is a solution. Then, does 17^2 divide \( 2^4 +1 \)?

Compute \( 2^4 +1 = 16 +1 =17 \). 17 divided by 17^2 is 1/17, which is not an integer. So, 17^2 does not divide 17. So, 17 is not the prime we need.

Wait, so maybe we need to check higher primes. Next prime after 17 congruent to 1 mod 8 is 17, then 73,  maybe 89, etc.

Wait, let me check 11 again. Earlier, I saw that 11 divides \( 5^4 +1 =626 \), but 11^2 doesn't divide 626. 626 divided by 121 is 5 remainder 21, so 5*121=605, 626-605=21. So, no.

Wait, is there another prime where \( n^4 +1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \)? Maybe 3? Let's check.

Wait, \( p=2 \): \( n^4 +1 \) is 1 or 2 mod 2, so 1 or 0, but 0 for even n. So, n=1: 1+1=2, which is 0 mod 2, but 2^2=4 does 4 divide 2? No. n=2: 16 +1=17, which is 1 mod 4. So, no.

Wait, maybe 13? Let's see. \( p=13 \): Check if any n satisfies \( n^4 ≡ -1 mod13 \). Then, \( n^4 +1 ≡0 mod13 \). Compute \( n^4 mod13 \):

n=0:0; 1:1; 2:16≡3; 3:81≡3; 4:256≡256-19*13=256-247=9; 5:625≡625-48*13=625-624=1; 6:1296≡1296-99*13=1296-1287=9; 7:2401≡2401-184*13=2401-2392=9; 8:4096≡4096-315*13=4096-4095=1; 9:6561≡6561-504*13=6561-6552=9; 10:10000≡10000-769*13=10000-9997=3; 11:14641≡14641-1126*13=14641-14638=3; 12:20736≡20736-1595*13=20736-20735=1.

So, \( n^4 mod13 \) gives 0,1,3,9. So, \( n^4 +1 \) mod13 is 1,2,4,10. So, 10 is present. So, when \( n=4 \): 4^4=256≡9 mod13, so 9+1=10≡10 mod13, which is not 0. Wait, no. Wait, 4^4=256≡9, so 4^4 +1=257≡257-19*13=257-247=10≡10 mod13≠0. So, no solution for \( n^4 +1 ≡0 mod13 \). So, 13 doesn't work.

Wait, but when n=5: 5^4=625≡1 mod13, so 1+1=2≡2 mod13≠0. n=2:16≡3 mod13, 3+1=4≠0. So, no, no solution.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's double-check \( n=3 \): 3^4=81≡3 mod13, so 3+1=4≡4 mod13≠0. n=6:9+1=10≡10≠0. So, indeed, no solution for \( n^4 ≡ -1 mod13 \). So, 13 is out.

Moving on to p=41, which is 1 mod 8 (since 41-1=40, which is divisible by 8). Let's check if \( n^4 ≡ -1 mod41 \) has a solution. Maybe n= some number.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Since I need the least prime p such that p^2 divides n^4 +1 for some n. Maybe I need to recall that primes p for which -1 is a quartic residue mod p are primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8, but also 2 is a quartic residue. Wait, maybe that's too vague.

Alternatively, I remember that if p is a prime such that p ≡ 1 mod 8, then the equation x^4 ≡ -1 mod p has solutions. But in this problem, we need p such that p^2 divides n^4 +1. So, perhaps even though p=11 divides some n^4 +1, but p^2 doesn't. So, maybe the minimal p is 17?

But earlier, when I checked p=17, n=2 gives 2^4 +1=17, which is divisible by 17, but not by 17^2. So, 17 isn't the answer. Maybe the next prime p=97.

Wait, let's check p=97. Is there n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by 97^2? Maybe, but that seems a bit tedious. Maybe I need a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps Hensel's lemma can help. If we have a solution modulo p, and if the derivative of the polynomial f(n)=n^4 +1 is not divisible by p, then we can lift the solution to modulo p^2. Wait, let me recall Hensel's lemma.

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n) ≡0 mod p and f'(n) not ≡0 mod p, then there exists a unique lift of n modulo p^2 such that f(n)≡0 mod p^2. So, in our case, if I have a solution n ≡ a mod p such that a^4 ≡-1 mod p, and if f'(a)=4a^3 ≡ not 0 mod p, then we can lift a to a solution modulo p^2.

So, if for some prime p, there exists a solution n ≡a mod p, and 4a^3 not≡0 mod p, then there exists a unique solution modulo p^2. So, if p=17, then let's see.

Earlier, for p=17, n=2 is a solution since 2^4=16≡-1 mod17. Then, f'(2)=4*(2)^3=32≡15 mod17≠0. So, f'(2)≡15≠0 mod17. So, by Hensel's lemma, there exists a unique solution modulo 17^2. So, that means that 2 can be lifted to a solution modulo 17^2.

Therefore, there exists n such that n ≡2 mod17 and n^4 ≡-1 mod17^2. So, 17^2 divides n^4 +1. So, that would mean p=17 is the prime we are looking for. But wait, earlier, n=2 gives n^4 +1=17, which is only divisible by 17, not 17^2. So, how come Hensel's lemma says that we can lift it to modulo 17^2?

Ah, right. Hensel's lemma allows us to find a solution n ≡2 mod17 such that n^4 ≡-1 mod17^2. So, that n is not necessarily 2, but some number congruent to 2 mod17. So, it's a different n.

Therefore, n is of the form 2 +17k for some integer k. Let's compute n^4 +1 modulo 17^2.

Let me compute (2 +17k)^4 +1 mod 17^2.

First, expand (2 +17k)^4:

Using binomial expansion:

(2 +17k)^4 = 2^4 + 4*(2)^3*(17k) + 6*(2)^2*(17k)^2 + 4*(2)*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

Compute this modulo 17^2=289.

Each term:

- 2^4=16
- 4*(8)*(17k)=4*8*17k=544k≡544k mod289. Since 544 divided by289 is 1*289=289, 544-289=255. So, 544k≡255k mod289.
- 6*(4)*(17k)^2=24*(289k^2). But 289k^2 is 0 mod289, so this term is 0.
- 4*(2)*(17k)^3=8*(4913k^3). 4913 is 17^3=4913, which is 17*289=4913. So, 4913k^3≡0 mod289, so this term is 0.
- (17k)^4=83521k^4≡0 mod289.

Therefore, modulo289, (2+17k)^4 ≡16 +255k.

Thus, (2+17k)^4 +1 ≡16 +255k +1=17 +255k mod289.

We need this ≡0 mod289. So, 17 +255k ≡0 mod289.

Simplify:

255k ≡ -17 mod289.

Let me write 255k ≡272 mod289 (since -17 mod289=272).

Now, let's solve for k: 255k ≡272 mod289.

Since 255 and 289 are co-prime? Let's check gcd(255,289).

255 factors: 5*51=5*3*17.

289 is 17^2.

So, gcd(255,289)=17.

So, 17 divides 272?

272 divided by17=16. So, yes, 17 divides 272.

Therefore, the equation 255k ≡272 mod289 can be simplified by dividing by17.

So, 255/17=15, 272/17=16, 289/17=17.

Thus, the equation becomes 15k ≡16 mod17.

Now, solve 15k ≡16 mod17.

15 and17 are coprime, so we can find the inverse of15 mod17.

Find x such that15x≡1 mod17.

15*1=15≡15

15*2=30≡13

15*3=45≡11

15*4=60≡16

15*5=75≡75-4*17=75-68=7

15*6=90≡90-5*17=90-85=5

15*7=105≡105-6*17=105-102=3

15*8=120≡120-7*17=120-119=1

So, 15*8≡1 mod17. So, inverse of15 mod17 is8.

Therefore, k≡16*8 mod17≡128 mod17.

128 divided by17: 17*7=119, 128-119=9. So, k≡9 mod17.

Therefore, k=9 +17m for some integer m.

Thus, the solution for n is n=2 +17k=2 +17*(9 +17m)=2 +153 +289m=155 +289m.

Therefore, the smallest positive integer solution n is155.

Thus, the least prime p is17, and the least positive integer m is155.

Wait, but let me check: 155^4 +1. Is that divisible by17^2=289.

Compute 155 mod17: 17*9=153, so 155≡2 mod17. So, 155≡2 mod17, so 155≡2 mod17, so 155^4≡2^4=16≡-1 mod17, so 155^4 +1≡0 mod17. But we need mod289.

From earlier, we have that 155^4 +1= (2+17*9)^4 +1≡17 +255*9=17 +2295=2312.

Now, compute 2312 divided by289: 289*8=2312. So, yes, 289*8=2312, so 2312≡0 mod289. Therefore, 155^4 +1 is divisible by289.

So, yes, 155 is the minimal positive integer m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by17^2.

Therefore, the answer is p=17, m=155.

But wait, let me check if p=17 is indeed the smallest such prime. Earlier, I thought p=11 was a candidate, but it didn't work because 11^2 didn't divide626. Next, p=17 works, but is there a smaller prime? The primes smaller than17, which are congruent to1 mod8, are17 only? Wait, 17 is the first prime with p≡1 mod8. Wait, 17 is the fifth prime, but primes before that like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,13,17.

Wait, 17 is the first prime where p≡1 mod8, and for that prime, as shown, we can lift the solution n=2 to modulo17^2. So, p=17 is the least such prime.

Therefore, my conclusion is that p=17, and m=155.

**Final Answer**
The least positive integer \( m \) is \boxed{155}.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find the least prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, we need to identify the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) has a solution. This prime \( p \) must satisfy the condition that 8 divides \( p - 1 \), meaning \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \). The smallest such prime is 17.

Next, we use Hensel's lemma to lift the solution modulo \( p \) to a solution modulo \( p^2 \). For \( p = 17 \), we know that \( n = 2 \) is a solution to \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 17 \). Using Hensel's lemma, we can lift this solution to modulo \( 17^2 \).

We expand \( (2 + 17k)^4 + 1 \) modulo \( 289 \) and solve for \( k \):

\[
(2 + 17k)^4 \equiv 16 + 255k \mod 289
\]

We need this to be congruent to 0 modulo 289:

\[
16 + 255k + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 289
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
17 + 255k \equiv 0 \mod 289
\]

This reduces to solving:

\[
255k \equiv -17 \mod 289
\]

Dividing by 17, we get:

\[
15k \equiv 16 \mod 17
\]

The inverse of 15 modulo 17 is 8, so:

\[
k \equiv 16 \cdot 8 \mod 17 \equiv 128 \mod 17 \equiv 9 \mod 17
\]

Thus, \( k = 9 + 17m \) for some integer \( m \). The smallest positive \( n \) is:

\[
n = 2 + 17 \cdot 9 = 155
\]

Therefore, the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \) is 155.

\[
\boxed{155}
\]
