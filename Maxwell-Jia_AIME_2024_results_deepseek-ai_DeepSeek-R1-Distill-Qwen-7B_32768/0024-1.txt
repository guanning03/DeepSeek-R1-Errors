Question:
Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

Correct Answer:
Assume that $AC$ is the asymptote of the hyperbola, in which case $BD$ is minimized. The expression of $BD$ is $y=-\sqrt{\frac{5}{6}}x$. Thus, we could get $\frac{x^2}{20}-\frac{y^2}{24}=1\implies x^2=\frac{720}{11}$. The desired value is $4\cdot \frac{11}{6}x^2=480$. This case can't be achieved, so all $BD^2$ would be greater than $\boxed{480}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, and D on the hyperbola given by the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of hyperbolas and rhombuses. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, no, actually in a rhombus the diagonals bisect each other but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, hold on, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yeah, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, that would mean that the origin is the midpoint for both diagonals.

So, given that, the rhombus has its center at the origin, so the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, with midpoints at the origin. So, points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, as are points B and D.

Given that all four points lie on the hyperbola, which is given by \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). So, each point (x, y) on the hyperbola must satisfy this equation.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But maybe instead of dealing with the sides, I can think in terms of the diagonals because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so BD is perpendicular to AC. Also, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center, the coordinates of the points can be represented as (a, b), (-a, -b) for one diagonal, and (c, d), (-c, -d) for the other diagonal. So, points A, B, C, D can be considered as (a, b), (c, d), (-a, -b), (-c, -d).

Wait, but actually, since ABCD is a rhombus, the order of the points matters. So, probably, the rhombus is such that when you connect A to B to C to D and back to A, you get the rhombus. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. So, points A and C are opposite each other, as are B and D.

So, let me denote the coordinates as follows: Let A = (p, q), then C = (-p, -q), and let B = (r, s), then D = (-r, -s).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides must all be equal. So, the distance from A to B must be equal to the distance from B to C, which must be equal to the distance from C to D, and so on.

So, let's compute the distance from A to B. The distance squared would be \((p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2\). Similarly, the distance from B to C is \((r - (-p))^2 + (s - (-q))^2 = (r + p)^2 + (s + q)^2\). Since these distances are equal, so:

\[
(p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2 = (r + p)^2 + (s + q)^2
\]

Let me expand both sides:

Left side: \(p^2 - 2pr + r^2 + q^2 - 2qs + s^2\)

Right side: \(r^2 + 2pr + p^2 + s^2 + 2qs + q^2\)

Subtracting left side from right side:

\( (r^2 + 2pr + p^2 + s^2 + 2qs + q^2) - (p^2 - 2pr + r^2 + q^2 - 2qs + s^2) \) 

Simplify:

\( 2pr + 2pr + 2qs + 2qs \) => \(4pr + 4qs = 0\)

So, \(4pr + 4qs = 0\), which simplifies to \(pr + qs = 0\)

Therefore, we have the condition \(pr + qs = 0\).

Similarly, we can compute the distance from B to C and the distance from C to D, but since the figure is a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distances from A to B, B to C, etc., are equal.

Another thing we can note is that the diagonals are perpendicular because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1.

The slope of AC is \(\frac{q - (-q)}{p - (-p)} = \frac{2q}{2p} = \frac{q}{p}\)

The slope of BD is \(\frac{s - (-s)}{r - (-r)} = \frac{2s}{2r} = \frac{s}{r}\)

Since diagonals are perpendicular, \(\frac{q}{p} \times \frac{s}{r} = -1\)

Therefore, \(\frac{qs}{pr} = -1\), so \(qs = -pr\). Wait, but from earlier, we had \(pr + qs = 0\), which is the same as \(qs = -pr\). So, this is consistent.

So, this gives us another condition.

So, now, we have points A = (p, q) and B = (r, s) on the hyperbola, so they satisfy:

\[
\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{r^2}{20} - \frac{s^2}{24} = 1
\]

Also, they satisfy \(pr + qs = 0\).

So, our goal is to find BD squared, which is the distance from B to D. Since D is (-r, -s), the distance BD is the distance between (r, s) and (-r, -s). So, BD squared is:

\[
(r - (-r))^2 + (s - (-s))^2 = (2r)^2 + (2s)^2 = 4r^2 + 4s^2 = 4(r^2 + s^2)
\]

So, BD squared is 4(r² + s²). Similarly, AC squared would be 4(p² + q²). But we need BD squared.

So, we need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we need to find the infimum of BD², and then the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be just slightly less than that infimum. But perhaps, the infimum is actually attainable, so the greatest lower bound would be the infimum itself.

Alternatively, maybe the infimum is achieved, so we have to find the minimum possible value of BD² given the constraints.

But let's think through.

So, since BD² = 4(r² + s²), and A and B lie on the hyperbola, we can express r² and s² in terms of p and q.

Wait, but since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are equal, so the distance from A to B is equal to the distance from B to C, which is equal to the distance from C to D, etc. So, we can express this condition in terms of p, q, r, s.

But perhaps it's better to parameterize the points on the hyperbola.

Since the hyperbola is \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we can parametrize points on it using hyperbolic functions.

Let me recall that a hyperbola can be parametrized as \(x = a \cosh t\), \(y = b \sinh t\), where \(a = \sqrt{20}\), \(b = \sqrt{24}\). Alternatively, for rectangular hyperbolas, sometimes people use different parametrizations, but I think this is a standard way.

Alternatively, since hyperbola can also be parametrized using rational functions. For example, using the slope. Let me think.

Alternatively, for hyperbola, another parametrization is \(x = a \sec \theta\), \(y = b \tan \theta\), but I think hyperbolic functions are more suitable here because they cover the entire hyperbola as t varies.

So, let's set \(x = \sqrt{20} \cosh t\), \(y = \sqrt{24} \sinh t\). Similarly, another point can be parametrized by another parameter, say, s: \(x = \sqrt{20} \cosh s\), \(y = \sqrt{24} \sinh s\).

But since in our case, points A and B are arbitrary on the hyperbola, so maybe using two different parameters.

But wait, we have points A and B such that \(pr + qs = 0\), with A = (p, q) and B = (r, s).

So, let's denote point A as \((\sqrt{20} \cosh t, \sqrt{24} \sinh t)\) and point B as \((\sqrt{20} \cosh s, \sqrt{24} \sinh s)\).

Then, the condition \(pr + qs = 0\) translates to:

\[
\sqrt{20} \cosh t \times \sqrt{20} \cosh s + \sqrt{24} \sinh t \times \sqrt{24} \sinh s = 0
\]

Simplify:

\[
20 \cosh t \cosh s + 24 \sinh t \sinh s = 0
\]

Hmm, that's an equation involving t and s. Let's see if we can manipulate this.

Factor out 4:

\[
4(5 \cosh t \cosh s + 6 \sinh t \sinh s) = 0
\]

So,

\[
5 \cosh t \cosh s + 6 \sinh t \sinh s = 0
\]

Hmm, that's a bit complex. Maybe we can write this in terms of hyperbolic identities.

Recall that \(\cosh(t + s) = \cosh t \cosh s + \sinh t \sinh s\), and \(\cosh(t - s) = \cosh t \cosh s - \sinh t \sinh s\). Hmm, but in our case, we have coefficients 5 and 6.

Alternatively, perhaps factor it as:

Let me denote \( \cosh t \cosh s = X \), \( \sinh t \sinh s = Y \). Then, equation is 5X + 6Y = 0.

But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps write in terms of exponentials.

Recall that \(\cosh t = \frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2}\) and \(\sinh t = \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2}\).

So, let's substitute these into the equation:

5 * [ (e^t + e^{-t})/2 * (e^s + e^{-s})/2 ] + 6 * [ (e^t - e^{-t})/2 * (e^s - e^{-s})/2 ] = 0

Multiply through:

5 * [ (e^{t+s} + e^{t - s} + e^{-t + s} + e^{-t - s}) / 4 ] + 6 * [ (e^{t+s} - e^{t - s} - e^{-t + s} + e^{-t - s}) / 4 ] = 0

Multiply numerator:

(5/4)(e^{t+s} + e^{t - s} + e^{-t + s} + e^{-t - s}) + (6/4)(e^{t+s} - e^{t - s} - e^{-t + s} + e^{-t - s}) = 0

Multiply through by 4 to eliminate denominators:

5(e^{t+s} + e^{t - s} + e^{-t + s} + e^{-t - s}) + 6(e^{t+s} - e^{t - s} - e^{-t + s} + e^{-t - s}) = 0

Now, expand the terms:

5e^{t+s} + 5e^{t - s} + 5e^{-t + s} + 5e^{-t - s} + 6e^{t+s} - 6e^{t - s} - 6e^{-t + s} + 6e^{-t - s} = 0

Combine like terms:

(5e^{t+s} + 6e^{t+s}) + (5e^{t - s} - 6e^{t - s}) + (5e^{-t + s} - 6e^{-t + s}) + (5e^{-t - s} + 6e^{-t - s}) = 0

Simplify each group:

11e^{t+s} - e^{t - s} - e^{-t + s} + 11e^{-t - s} = 0

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, maybe express in terms of \(\cosh(t - s)\) and \(\cosh(t + s)\), since we have products of cosh and sinh.

Wait, let me recall that:

\(\cosh t \cosh s = \frac{1}{2} [\cosh(t + s) + \cosh(t - s)]\)

\(\sinh t \sinh s = \frac{1}{2} [\cosh(t + s) - \cosh(t - s)]\)

So, substituting back into the equation:

5 * \(\frac{1}{2} [\cosh(t + s) + \cosh(t - s)]\) + 6 * \(\frac{1}{2} [\cosh(t + s) - \cosh(t - s)]\) = 0

Simplify:

(5/2)(cosh(t + s) + cosh(t - s)) + (6/2)(cosh(t + s) - cosh(t - s)) = 0

Which is:

(5/2 + 6/2) cosh(t + s) + (5/2 - 6/2) cosh(t - s) = 0

Simplify coefficients:

(11/2) cosh(t + s) - (1/2) cosh(t - s) = 0

Multiply both sides by 2:

11 cosh(t + s) - cosh(t - s) = 0

Thus,

11 cosh(t + s) = cosh(t - s)

Hmm, that's a more manageable equation.

So, 11 cosh(t + s) = cosh(t - s)

Let me denote u = t + s and v = t - s. So, u and v are new variables. Then, the equation becomes:

11 cosh u = cosh v

But we also have that u = t + s and v = t - s, so t = (u + v)/2 and s = (u - v)/2.

But I'm not sure if that substitution helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write cosh(t + s) and cosh(t - s) in terms of exponential functions.

But maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps set t + s = a and t - s = b, then 11 cosh a = cosh b.

But I'm not sure. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since cosh is an even function, and it's increasing for positive arguments, perhaps we can analyze the equation 11 cosh(t + s) = cosh(t - s) for real numbers t and s.

But perhaps think about the ratio:

cosh(t - s) / cosh(t + s) = 11

So,

cosh(t - s) = 11 cosh(t + s)

But since cosh is always greater than or equal to 1, and 11 is a positive constant, this equation suggests that cosh(t - s) is 11 times cosh(t + s). But since cosh is an increasing function for positive arguments and decreasing for negative arguments, and it's symmetric, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, but cosh is symmetric, so perhaps t and s can be positive or negative.

Alternatively, perhaps set u = t + s and v = t - s, so that t = (u + v)/2 and s = (u - v)/2.

Then, the equation becomes:

cosh u = (1/11) cosh v

So,

cosh u = (1/11) cosh v

Hmm, since cosh is always positive, this is possible.

But we can analyze this as:

Given that cosh u = (1/11) cosh v

But since cosh is a convex function, and it's minimized at 0, with cosh(0) = 1.

So, the maximum value of (1/11) cosh v is unbounded, but cosh u is also unbounded as u increases.

Wait, but for each v, cosh u can be adjusted.

But perhaps, for a given v, u is determined.

Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of exponentials.

Let me write cosh u = (e^u + e^{-u}) / 2

Similarly, cosh v = (e^v + e^{-v}) / 2

So, equation is:

(e^u + e^{-u}) / 2 = (1/11) * (e^v + e^{-v}) / 2

Multiply both sides by 2:

e^u + e^{-u} = (1/11)(e^v + e^{-v})

But given that u = t + s and v = t - s, perhaps we can relate these variables.

Alternatively, since t and s are independent variables, maybe we can fix one and solve for the other.

But perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Maybe another approach.

Wait, let's think about the hyperbola parametrization again.

We have points A and B on the hyperbola, given by:

A = (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t)

B = (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s)

And we have the condition:

5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s = 0

Let me denote that as:

5 cosh t cosh s = -6 sinh t sinh s

Divide both sides by cosh t cosh s (assuming they are non-zero, which they are because cosh is always positive):

5 = -6 tanh t tanh s

So,

tanh t tanh s = -5/6

Hmm, this is a useful relation.

So, tanh t tanh s = -5/6

So, if we let tanh t = a, then tanh s = -5/(6a)

Since tanh is an odd function, so tanh s = -5/(6a)

But since tanh is bounded between -1 and 1, the product tanh t tanh s must be between -1 and 1.

So,

|tanh t tanh s| = | -5/6 | = 5/6 < 1

So, that's acceptable, because 5/6 is less than 1, so such t and s exist.

So, we can write tanh t = a, tanh s = -5/(6a)

Now, let's express cosh t and cosh s in terms of a.

We know that:

cosh t = 1 / sqrt(1 - sinh^2 t)

But perhaps it's better to express in terms of tanh.

We know that:

cosh t = 1 / sqrt(1 - tanh^2 t) = 1 / sqrt(1 - a^2)

Similarly,

cosh s = 1 / sqrt(1 - tanh^2 s) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (25)/(36 a^2)) = 1 / sqrt( (36 a^2 - 25) / (36 a^2) ) ) = sqrt(36 a^2 / (36 a^2 - 25)) = 6 |a| / sqrt(36 a^2 - 25)

But since tanh s = -5/(6a), and tanh s is real, so 36 a^2 - 25 > 0, so 36 a^2 > 25, so |a| > 5/6

But since tanh t = a and |a| < 1, so 5/6 < |a| < 1

So, that's acceptable.

So, let's compute cosh t and cosh s:

cosh t = 1 / sqrt(1 - a^2)

cosh s = 6 |a| / sqrt(36 a^2 - 25)

But since a can be positive or negative, but tanh t tanh s = -5/6 is negative, so either tanh t is positive and tanh s is negative, or vice versa.

But since we're dealing with cosh, which is symmetric, I think we can assume a is positive, so tanh t is positive, tanh s is negative.

Therefore, |a| = a, and tanh s = -5/(6a)

So, cosh s = 6 a / sqrt(36 a^2 - 25)

Now, so now, with these expressions, we can compute BD squared.

BD squared is 4(r² + s²)

But wait, in the parametrization, point B is (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s), so r = sqrt(20) cosh s, s_coord = sqrt(24) sinh s

Wait, hold on, to avoid confusion with the point B's coordinates, let's denote point B as (R, S), so R = sqrt(20) cosh s, S = sqrt(24) sinh s

Then, BD squared is 4(R² + S²)

But R² + S² is (20 cosh² s + 24 sinh² s)

So, BD squared = 4*(20 cosh² s + 24 sinh² s)

Similarly, let's express this in terms of a.

We have cosh s = 6 a / sqrt(36 a² -25), and sinh s = (tanh s) / sqrt(1 - tanh² s) = (-5/(6a)) / sqrt(1 - 25/(36 a²)) = (-5/(6a)) / sqrt( (36 a² - 25)/(36 a²) ) ) = (-5/(6a)) * (6a)/sqrt(36 a² -25) = -5 / sqrt(36 a² -25)

So, sinh s = -5 / sqrt(36 a² -25)

Therefore, sinh² s = 25 / (36 a² -25)

Therefore, BD squared is:

4*(20 cosh² s + 24 sinh² s) = 4*(20*(36 a²)/(36 a² -25) + 24*(25)/(36 a² -25))

Simplify:

= 4*[ (720 a² + 600 ) / (36 a² -25) ]

Factor numerator:

720 a² + 600 = 600 + 720 a² = 120*(5 + 6 a²)

Denominator: 36 a² -25

So,

BD squared = 4 * [ 120*(5 + 6 a²) / (36 a² -25) ] = 480*(5 + 6 a²) / (36 a² -25)

So, BD squared = 480*(5 + 6 a²) / (36 a² -25)

Let me simplify this expression:

First, note that both numerator and denominator have terms in a².

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 5 + 6 a² = 6 a² + 5

Denominator: 36 a² -25 = (6 a)^2 -5^2 = (6 a -5)(6 a +5)

Hmm, interesting.

So, BD squared = 480*(6 a² +5) / ( (6 a -5)(6 a +5) )

So, we can write:

BD squared = 480*(6 a² +5) / ( (6 a -5)(6 a +5) )

Simplify the fraction:

(6 a² +5) / ( (6 a -5)(6 a +5) )

Notice that 6 a² +5 = (6 a² - (25/ something)) Hmm, not directly. Alternatively, perform polynomial division.

Wait, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator is 6 a² +5, denominator is 36 a² -25, which is (6a)^2 -5^2.

So, numerator is 6 a² +5, denominator is (6a)^2 -5^2.

So, perhaps write numerator as (6 a² -25) + 30.

Wait, 6 a² +5 = (6 a² -25) + 30

So,

BD squared = 480*( (6 a² -25) + 30 ) / (6 a² -25 )

= 480*(1 + 30 / (6 a² -25) )

So,

BD squared = 480 + 480*30 / (6 a² -25 )

= 480 + 14400 / (6 a² -25 )

So, BD squared = 480 + 14400 / (6 a² -25 )

So, now, our task is to find the range of BD squared as a varies over the domain where |a| > 5/6 and |a| <1.

Given that, since a is tanh t, and |a| is between 5/6 and 1, but in our case, since we set a positive, a ∈ (5/6,1).

So, a ∈ (5/6,1).

So, let's denote x = a², so x ∈ (25/36,1).

Then, BD squared becomes:

480 + 14400 / (6x -25 )

So, we need to analyze the function f(x) = 480 + 14400 / (6x -25 ) for x ∈ (25/36,1).

Wait, let's compute the denominator: 6x -25.

Since x >25/36, 6x >25/6, so 6x -25 >25/6 -25= (25 -150)/6= (-125)/6. But x is greater than 25/36, so 6x is greater than 25/6, so 6x -25 is greater than 25/6 -25= -125/6. But that's not helpful.

Wait, let's compute 6x -25 when x ∈ (25/36,1):

At x =25/36: 6*(25/36) -25= (25/6) -25= (25 -150)/6= (-125)/6≈-20.833

At x =1: 6*1 -25=6 -25= -19

So, denominator is negative in this interval, between approximately -20.833 and -19.

Therefore, 14400 / (6x -25 ) is negative, because denominator is negative.

So, BD squared is 480 plus a negative number, so BD squared is less than 480.

But we need to find the minimal value of BD squared. Wait, but as x approaches 25/36 from above, denominator approaches -125/6, so 14400 / (6x -25 ) approaches 14400 / (-125/6 )= 14400*(-6)/125= -14400*6/125= -14400*6/125= -14400*(6/125)= -14400*(0.048)= -691.2

So, as x approaches 25/36+, BD squared approaches 480 -691.2= -211.2

Wait, but BD squared can't be negative, because it's the square of a distance.

Wait, that suggests that this approach is flawed.

Wait, maybe I messed up in the substitution.

Wait, let's go back.

Earlier, we had:

BD squared = 4*(20 cosh² s +24 sinh² s )

But cosh² s = (cosh 2s +1)/2, and sinh² s = (cosh 2s -1)/2.

But, wait, perhaps it's better to compute 20 cosh² s +24 sinh² s.

Compute 20 cosh² s +24 sinh² s:

=20*(cosh² s) +24*(sinh² s)

But we can use the identity cosh² s - sinh² s =1.

So, cosh² s =1 + sinh² s

Therefore,

20*(1 + sinh² s) +24 sinh² s=20 +20 sinh² s +24 sinh² s=20 +44 sinh² s

So, BD squared=4*(20 +44 sinh² s )=80 +176 sinh² s

So, BD squared=80 +176 sinh² s

But sinh² s was expressed in terms of a.

We had sinh s= -5 / sqrt(36 a² -25 ), so sinh² s=25/(36 a² -25 )

Therefore,

BD squared=80 +176*(25)/(36 a² -25 )=80 + (4400)/(36 a² -25 )

Which is the same as before.

So, BD squared=80 +4400/(36 a² -25 )

But since a ∈(5/6,1), let's write x=a², x ∈(25/36,1). So,

BD squared=80 +4400/(6x -25 )

So, now, as x approaches 25/36 from above, denominator approaches 6*(25/36)-25=25/6 -25= (25 -150)/6= -125/6≈-20.833

So, 4400/(-125/6)=4400*(-6)/125= -26400/125= -211.2

So, BD squared approaches 80 -211.2= -131.2, which is impossible because distance squared can't be negative.

Therefore, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, actually, when we have BD squared=80 +4400/(36 a² -25 )

But when x approaches25/36, denominator approaches 6*(25/36) -25=25/6 -25≈-20.833, which makes 4400/(-20.833)= -211.2

So, BD squared approaches 80 -211.2= -131.2, which is impossible.

But that suggests that BD squared cannot be less than zero, so maybe my parametrization is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, let's retrace.

We had points A and B on hyperbola, connected by a rhombus with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at origin.

We found that BD squared=4(r² +s² )

But in our parametrization, point B is (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s )

Wait, but if I take point A as (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t ), then point B is (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s )

But in the rhombus, points A and C are opposite, so C is (-sqrt(20) cosh t, -sqrt(24) sinh t )

Similarly, D is (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s )

Then, the diagonals are AC and BD.

So, length BD squared is (2 sqrt(20) cosh s )² + (2 sqrt(24) sinh s )²=4*(20 cosh² s +24 sinh² s )

So, BD squared=80 cosh² s +96 sinh² s

Wait, that's different from what I had earlier.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the previous step.

Wait, in the initial step, I thought BD squared is 4*(r² +s² ). But in reality, points B and D are (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s ) and (-sqrt(20) cosh s, -sqrt(24) sinh s ), so the distance between B and D is sqrt[ (sqrt(20) cosh s - (-sqrt(20) cosh s ))² + (sqrt(24) sinh s - (-sqrt(24) sinh s ))² ]

Which is sqrt[ (2 sqrt(20) cosh s )² + (2 sqrt(24) sinh s )² ]=sqrt[4*20 cosh² s +4*24 sinh² s ]=sqrt[80 cosh² s +96 sinh² s ]

Therefore, BD squared is 80 cosh² s +96 sinh² s

Not 4*(r² + s² ). I think I made a mistake earlier.

So, BD squared=80 cosh² s +96 sinh² s

Similarly, we had for point A, 20 cosh² t +24 sinh² t=1, because point A is on the hyperbola.

Wait, no, point A is on the hyperbola, so (sqrt(20) cosh t )² /20 - (sqrt(24) sinh t )² /24=1 => 20 cosh² t /20 -24 sinh² t /24= cosh² t - sinh² t=1, which is correct.

So, 20 cosh² t -24 sinh² t=24.

So, 20 cosh² t -24 sinh² t=24.

Therefore, 20 cosh² t=24 +24 sinh² t

So, cosh² t= (24 +24 sinh² t)/20= (6 +6 sinh² t)/5

But perhaps that's not necessary.

But going back, BD squared=80 cosh² s +96 sinh² s

Hmm, so maybe express BD squared in terms of sinh s.

We have tanh t tanh s= -5/6

But perhaps express sinh s in terms of sinh t or something.

Alternatively, let's try to find a relationship between cosh s and sinh s, given tanh t tanh s= -5/6

We have tanh t tanh s= (sinh t / cosh t)(sinh s / cosh s)= (sinh t sinh s)/(cosh t cosh s)= -5/6

But from the hyperbola equation, for point A: 20 cosh² t -24 sinh² t=24

Let me write 20 cosh² t -24 sinh² t=24

Divide both sides by 4: 5 cosh² t -6 sinh² t=6

So, 5 cosh² t -6 sinh² t=6

But we also have tanh t tanh s= -5/6, which is (sinh t / cosh t)(sinh s / cosh s)= -5/6

So, sinh t sinh s= (-5/6) cosh t cosh s

So, let me denote sinh t sinh s= (-5/6) cosh t cosh s

So, let's write sinh t sinh s= (-5/6) cosh t cosh s

So, (sinh t sinh s)/(cosh t cosh s)= -5/6

Which is tanh t tanh s= -5/6, as we had.

But perhaps square both sides:

sinh² t sinh² s= (25/36) cosh² t cosh² s

So, sinh² t sinh² s= (25/36) cosh² t cosh² s

So, sinh² s= (25/36) (cosh² t cosh² s ) / sinh² t

But maybe substitute cosh² t from hyperbola equation.

From 5 cosh² t -6 sinh² t=6

So, 5 cosh² t=6 +6 sinh² t

Thus, cosh² t= (6 +6 sinh² t)/5

So, cosh² t= (6/5)(1 + sinh² t )

So, cosh² t= (6/5)(1 + sinh² t )

Similarly, in the expression for sinh² s:

sinh² s= (25/36) ( (6/5)(1 + sinh² t ) cosh² s ) / sinh² t

So,

sinh² s= (25/36)*(6/5)*( (1 + sinh² t ) / sinh² t )*cosh² s

Simplify:

= (25/36)*(6/5)= (25*6)/(36*5)= (150)/(180)=5/6

So,

sinh² s= (5/6)* ( (1 + sinh² t ) / sinh² t )*cosh² s

Hmm, this seems a bit convoluted, but perhaps we can write:

sinh² s= (5/6) * (1 + sinh² t ) / sinh² t * cosh² s

Let me rearrange:

Multiply both sides by sinh² t:

sinh² s * sinh² t= (5/6)(1 + sinh² t ) cosh² s

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe express in terms of cosh s.

Wait, from hyperbola equation for point B: 20 cosh² s -24 sinh² s=24

So, 20 cosh² s -24 sinh² s=24

We can express sinh² s= (20 cosh² s -24)/24

So, sinh² s= (20 cosh² s)/24 -1= (5 cosh² s)/6 -1

So, sinh² s= (5 cosh² s -6)/6

So, BD squared=80 cosh² s +96 sinh² s=80 cosh² s +96*(5 cosh² s -6)/6

Simplify:

96/6=16, so 16*(5 cosh² s -6 )=80 cosh² s -96

Thus,

BD squared=80 cosh² s +80 cosh² s -96=160 cosh² s -96

So, BD squared=160 cosh² s -96

Now, we need to express cosh² s in terms of something.

Wait, from the hyperbola equation for point B: 20 cosh² s -24 sinh² s=24

But sinh² s= (5 cosh² s -6)/6

So, plug into hyperbola equation:

20 cosh² s -24*(5 cosh² s -6)/6=24

Simplify:

20 cosh² s -4*(5 cosh² s -6 )=24

=20 cosh² s -20 cosh² s +24=24

=24=24

So, it's an identity, which doesn't help us.

Therefore, we can't get more info from there.

Alternatively, since BD squared=160 cosh² s -96, we can express cosh² s in terms of BD squared.

Wait, so BD squared=160 cosh² s -96 => cosh² s=(BD squared +96)/160

But we also have hyperbola equation for point B:20 cosh² s -24 sinh² s=24

But sinh² s= (5 cosh² s -6)/6

So,

20 cosh² s -24*(5 cosh² s -6)/6=24

Simplify:

20 cosh² s -4*(5 cosh² s -6 )=24

=20 cosh² s -20 cosh² s +24=24

Again, same as before.

So, stuck.

Wait, but we also have the condition from the rhombus, which was 11 cosh u = cosh v, but we had substituted it as tanh t tanh s= -5/6

Wait, perhaps now we can relate cosh s to something else.

From BD squared=160 cosh² s -96

We can write cosh² s=(BD squared +96)/160

But we need to find the relation with the hyperbola equation.

Wait, for point B, 20 cosh² s -24 sinh² s=24

But sinh² s= (5 cosh² s -6)/6

So,

20 cosh² s -24*(5 cosh² s -6)/6=24

As before, gives 24=24.

So, no help.

So, perhaps we need to relate this to the other equation.

Wait, we had another equation from the rhombus, which was 11 cosh u = cosh v, but in our parametrization, u was t + s, v was t - s.

Wait, but perhaps I need to go back to the equation 11 cosh u = cosh v, which was:

11 cosh(t + s) = cosh(t - s)

Let me try to compute this in terms of cosh t and cosh s.

We have:

11*(cosh t cosh s + sinh t sinh s )=cosh t cosh s - sinh t sinh s

So, 11 cosh t cosh s +11 sinh t sinh s =cosh t cosh s - sinh t sinh s

Bring all terms to left side:

11 cosh t cosh s +11 sinh t sinh s -cosh t cosh s + sinh t sinh s=0

Factor:

(11 cosh t cosh s -cosh t cosh s ) + (11 sinh t sinh s + sinh t sinh s )=0

=10 cosh t cosh s +12 sinh t sinh s=0

Divide both sides by 2:

5 cosh t cosh s +6 sinh t sinh s=0

So, 5 cosh t cosh s +6 sinh t sinh s=0

But earlier, we had another equation:

tanh t tanh s= -5/6 => sinh t sinh s= (-5/6) cosh t cosh s

So, substituting sinh t sinh s= (-5/6) cosh t cosh s into equation above:

5 cosh t cosh s +6*(-5/6) cosh t cosh s=0

Simplify:

5 cosh t cosh s -5 cosh t cosh s=0

Which is 0=0

Hmm, so that's an identity, which means that our earlier substitution is consistent.

Therefore, we don't get any new information.

So, perhaps another approach is required.

Wait, since BD squared=160 cosh² s -96, and we need to find the minimal value of BD squared.

But as cosh² s increases, BD squared increases, so to minimize BD squared, we need to minimize cosh² s.

But cosh² s is minimized when cosh s is minimized.

Since cosh s is minimized at s=0, where cosh s=1. So, the minimal cosh² s is 1.

But can s be zero?

If s=0, then point B is (sqrt(20) cosh 0, sqrt(24) sinh 0 )=(sqrt(20)*1, 0 ), so point B=(sqrt(20),0 )

Similarly, point D=(-sqrt(20),0 )

Then, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin.

But point A must also lie on the hyperbola, so if point B is at (sqrt(20),0 ), then point A must satisfy the condition that ABCD is a rhombus.

Given that, in this case, BD is along the x-axis, from (-sqrt(20),0 ) to (sqrt(20),0 ). So, BD has length 2 sqrt(20 )

Then, AC would be perpendicular to BD, so AC must be along the y-axis.

So, points A and C would be at (0, sqrt(24 )) and (0, -sqrt(24 ))

But check if points A and C lie on the hyperbola.

For point A=(0, sqrt(24 )):

Plug into hyperbola equation: 0² /20 - (sqrt(24 ))² /24= -24/24=-1≠1, which is not on the hyperbola.

So, that's a problem. So, the rhombus with points at (sqrt(20),0 ), (-sqrt(20),0 ), (0, sqrt(24 ) ), (0,-sqrt(24 )) is not a rhombus because the sides are not equal.

Wait, check the sides.

Distance from (sqrt(20 ),0 ) to (0, sqrt(24 )) is sqrt(20 +24 )=sqrt(44 )

Distance from (0, sqrt(24 )) to (-sqrt(20 ),0 ) is sqrt(44 )

Distance from (-sqrt(20 ),0 ) to (0,-sqrt(24 )) is sqrt(44 )

Distance from (0,-sqrt(24 )) to (sqrt(20 ),0 ) is sqrt(44 )

Wait, so actually, all sides are equal, sqrt(44 ). So, it is a rhombus.

But points A and C are at (0, sqrt(24 )) and (0, -sqrt(24 )), which are not on the hyperbola. Wait, the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24=1.

So, point A=(0, sqrt(24 )): plug into hyperbola equation: 0 - (24)/24= -1≠1. So, it's not on the hyperbola.

Hmm, so that rhombus is not valid, as points A and C are not on the hyperbola.

So, that suggests that when s=0, it's not a valid rhombus.

Therefore, s cannot be zero, so cosh s cannot be 1.

So, the minimal cosh s is greater than 1.

Therefore, BD squared=160 cosh² s -96

Since cosh² s >1, BD squared>160*1 -96=64

So, BD squared>64

So, the minimal possible value of BD squared is greater than 64.

But wait, we can't achieve 64, but can we approach it?

Wait, if s approaches zero, cosh s approaches 1, so BD squared approaches 64.

But since when s=0, points A and C are not on the hyperbola, but we can have points approaching that.

Wait, but in reality, as s approaches zero, point B approaches (sqrt(20 ),0 ), and point D approaches (-sqrt(20 ),0 )

Then, points A and C must approach (0, sqrt(24 )) and (0, -sqrt(24 )), but those are not on the hyperbola.

Therefore, to maintain points A and C on the hyperbola, as s approaches zero, points A and C must be adjusted accordingly.

Wait, maybe not. Maybe as s approaches zero, points A and C can approach (0, something) but still lie on the hyperbola.

Wait, for the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24=1, the y-intercepts are at y=±sqrt(24*(x²/20 -1 )). But x=0, then y²= -24, which is impossible, so the hyperbola doesn't cross the y-axis.

So, points A and C cannot be on the y-axis. Therefore, as s approaches zero, points A and C are forced to go to infinity.

Wait, let's see.

If s approaches zero, cosh s approaches 1, sinh s approaches s.

So, point B approaches (sqrt(20 ),0 ), point D approaches (-sqrt(20 ),0 )

Then, points A and C must satisfy the rhombus condition. So, the midpoint of AC is the origin, and AC is perpendicular to BD.

So, BD is along x-axis, AC must be along y-axis, but points A and C are not on hyperbola.

Wait, so perhaps as s approaches zero, points A and C go to infinity on the hyperbola, but the rhombus is formed.

Wait, perhaps this suggests that BD squared can approach 64 as s approaches zero, but can't actually reach it because points A and C would not lie on the hyperbola.

But in reality, the hyperbola is unbounded, so points A and C can go to infinity as s approaches certain values.

But in our case, with the rhombus condition, perhaps s can't actually reach zero, but can approach it.

Therefore, the minimal BD squared is 64, but it's not attainable, so the greatest real number less than BD squared is 64.

But wait, wait, hold on.

Wait, if BD squared approaches 64 as s approaches zero, but BD squared=160 cosh² s -96

So, cosh² s=(BD squared +96)/160

As BD squared approaches 64, cosh² s approaches (64 +96)/160=160/160=1, so cosh s approaches1.

But as s approaches zero, cosh s approaches1, but since s cannot be zero, cosh s must be greater than1, so BD squared must be greater than64.

Therefore, the minimal BD squared is 64, but it's not achieved, so the supremum is 64, but it's not achieved.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD squared is 64, but since it's not achieved, is 64 the answer?

Wait, the question says "the greatest real number that is less than BD squared for all such rhombi."

So, since BD squared can be made arbitrarily close to64, but never actually reaching it, so64 is the infimum of BD squared.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD squared for all rhombi is64.

But wait, but in another perspective, if BD squared can be as small as approaching64, then64 is the lower bound, and the supremum of numbers less than BD squared is64.

Therefore, the answer is64.

But let me verify this with another approach.

Suppose we consider BD squared=160 cosh² s -96

We need to find the minimal value of BD squared, which is when cosh² s is minimal.

But cosh² s minimal is1, but as we saw, that case is invalid because points A and C are not on the hyperbola.

Therefore, we have to find the minimal possible BD squared such that points A and C lie on the hyperbola.

So, we need to find the minimal BD squared, given that.

Since BD squared=160 cosh² s -96, and s is such that points A and C lie on the hyperbola.

But to find the minimal BD squared, we can set derivative to zero.

But BD squared is expressed in terms of cosh² s, which is a monotonic function for s>0.

But since s is related to the parametrization, and we also have the condition from the rhombus.

Wait, perhaps we can express BD squared in terms of BD squared.

Wait, another idea: the product of the diagonals in a rhombus is equal to twice the area, but maybe that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates.

Let me think of points A and B on the hyperbola such that ABCD is a rhombus.

Given that, in coordinate terms, points A, B, C, D must satisfy that the midpoint of AC and BD is the origin, and the sides are equal.

So, the midpoint condition is satisfied.

But also, the sides must be equal.

So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, etc.

But since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, so |A - B|=|B - C|=|C - D|=|D - A|.

But given the coordinates, perhaps we can write equations.

But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, using vectors.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the position vectors of A and C are negatives, as are B and D.

So, if point A is vector **a**, then point C is vector -**a**

Similarly, point B is vector **b**, point D is vector -**b**

So, the rhombus has sides as vectors **a** - **b**, **b** - (-**a**), etc.

So, for it to be a rhombus, all sides must have the same length.

So, |**a** - **b**|=|**b** + **a**|

Compute |**a** - **b**|²=|**a** + **b**|²

Which gives (**a** - **b**)·(**a** - **b**)= (**a** + **b**)·(**a** + **b**)

Compute:

(**a** - **b**)·(**a** - **b**)= |**a**|² - 2 **a**·**b** + |**b**|²

(**a** + **b**)·(**a** + **b**)= |**a**|² + 2 **a**·**b** + |**b**|²

Set equal:

|**a**|² - 2 **a**·**b** + |**b**|² = |**a**|² + 2 **a**·**b** + |**b**|²

Simplify:

-4 **a**·**b**=0 => **a**·**b**=0

So, in vector terms, **a** and **b** must be perpendicular.

So, vectors **a** and **b** are perpendicular.

Given that, since **a** and **b** are position vectors of points on the hyperbola, with |**a**|² /20 - |**b**|² /24=1

Wait, no, points A and B are on the hyperbola, so |**a**|² /20 - |**b**|² /24=1

But also, **a** and **b** are perpendicular.

So, **a**·**b**=0

So, we have two conditions:

1. |**a**|² /20 - |**b**|² /24=1

2. **a**·**b**=0

We need to find BD squared=|2**b**|²=4|**b**|².

So, BD squared=4|**b**|²

We need to find the minimal value of BD squared=4|**b**|², given that |**a**|² /20 - |**b**|² /24=1 and **a**·**b**=0.

So, we can write |**a**|²=20(1 + |**b**|² /24 )

So, |**a**|²=20 + (20 |**b**|²)/24=20 + (5 |**b**|²)/6

Also, since **a** and **b** are perpendicular, |**a** + **b**|²=|**a**|² + |**b**|²

But in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy |**a** + **b**|² + |**a** - **b**|²=2(|**a**|² + |**b**|² )

But in our case, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, but we already used that to get **a**·**b**=0.

Wait, perhaps another way.

Given that, we have |**a**|²=20 + (5 |**b**|²)/6

So, BD squared=4|**b**|²

We need to find the minimal BD squared.

But |**a**|² must be positive, so 20 + (5 |**b**|²)/6 >0, which is always true.

But we need to find the minimal BD squared.

But we can express |**b**|² in terms of |**a**|², but I don't see a direct relation.

Wait, perhaps we can relate |**a**|² and |**b**|² via the fact that **a** and **b** are perpendicular.

But if **a** and **b** are perpendicular, then in the coordinate system, we can write **a**=(x, y ) and **b**=(u, v ) with xu + yv=0.

But also, |**a**|² /20 - |**b**|² /24=1.

So, (x² + y²)/20 - (u² +v²)/24=1

But also, xu + yv=0

We need to minimize |**b**|²= u² +v²

Subject to (x² + y²)/20 - (u² +v²)/24=1 and xu + yv=0

This is an optimization problem.

Let me denote |**b**|²= k, so we need to minimize k.

Given that:

(x² + y²)/20 -k /24=1

And xu + yv=0

We can use the fact that xu + yv=0, so u and v are perpendicular to x and y.

So, maybe express u and v in terms of x and y.

Let me define u = p x + q y, v= r x + s y, but subject to perpendicularity.

Alternatively, since **b** is perpendicular to **a**, so **b** is in the direction perpendicular to **a**.

So, if **a**=(x,y ), then **b** can be written as (λ y, -λ x ) for some λ.

So, **b**=λ(y, -x )

So, then:

xu + yv= x*(λ y ) + y*(-λ x )=λ xy -λ xy=0, which satisfies the perpendicularity.

So, **b**=λ(y, -x )

Then, |**b**|²=λ²(y² +x² )

So, k=λ²(x² + y² )

Also, (x² + y² )/20 -k /24=1

Substitute k:

(x² + y² )/20 - (λ²(x² + y² ))/24=1

Let me denote |**a**|²= x² + y² = m

So, m/20 - (λ² m )/24=1

Factor m:

m (1/20 - λ² /24 )=1

So, m=1 / (1/20 - λ² /24 )

But m= x² + y², which is positive.

Also, k=λ² m

Thus,

k=λ² / (1/20 - λ² /24 )

We can write this as:

k= (λ² ) / (1/20 - (λ²)/24 )

Let me write 1/20 as 3/60 and 1/24 as 2.5/60, but maybe it's better to find a common denominator.

1/20 - λ² /24= (24 - 20 λ² ) / (20*24 )

So,

k= λ² / ( (24 -20 λ² ) / (480 ) )= 480 λ² / (24 -20 λ² )= (480 λ² ) / (24 -20 λ² )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 4:

= (120 λ² ) / (6 -5 λ² )

So,

k= (120 λ² ) / (6 -5 λ² )

We need to minimize k.

So, we can consider k as a function of λ:

k(λ )= (120 λ² ) / (6 -5 λ² )

We can take derivative with respect to λ and set to zero to find minima.

But note that λ cannot be such that denominator becomes zero or negative.

So, denominator 6 -5 λ² >0 => 5 λ² <6 => λ² <6/5 => |λ| < sqrt(6/5 )

So, domain of λ is (-sqrt(6/5 ), sqrt(6/5 ) )

But since k is even function, we can consider λ>0.

So, let's compute derivative:

k(λ )= (120 λ² ) / (6 -5 λ² )

Let me compute dk/dλ:

dk/dλ= [ (240 λ )(6 -5 λ² ) - (120 λ² )( -10 λ ) ] / (6 -5 λ² )²

Simplify numerator:

=240 λ (6 -5 λ² ) + 1200 λ³

=1440 λ -1200 λ³ +1200 λ³

=1440 λ

So, dk/dλ=1440 λ / (6 -5 λ² )²

Set dk/dλ=0:

Only when λ=0, but λ=0 gives k=0, which is not possible because points A and B cannot coincide.

Therefore, k is increasing for λ>0 because dk/dλ>0 for λ>0.

Therefore, the minimal k occurs at λ approaching zero.

But as λ approaches zero, k approaches zero, but points A and B would approach origin, which is not allowed as they must lie on hyperbola.

Wait, but wait, as λ approaches zero, **b** approaches zero vector, but **a** remains on hyperbola.

Wait, but **a** must satisfy |**a**|² /20 - |**b**|² /24=1

If |**b**|² approaches zero, then |**a**|² approaches20*(1 +0 )=20

So, point A approaches (sqrt(20 ),0 ) or (-sqrt(20 ),0 )

But as we saw earlier, points A cannot be on the y-axis, but points on the x-axis are allowed.

But in that case, point A=(sqrt(20 ),0 ), point B approaching origin, so the rhombus becomes degenerate.

But in that case, BD squared approaches zero, but earlier we had BD squared=160 cosh² s -96, which as s approaches zero, BD squared approaches64.

Wait, this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps in this parametrization, BD squared approaches 64 as λ approaches zero.

Wait, perhaps let's see.

From earlier, in the vector approach, we have BD squared=4 |**b**|²=4k

From the hyperbola equation:

|**a**|² /20 - |**b**|² /24=1

Also, **a** and **b** are perpendicular.

We found that k= (120 λ² ) / (6 -5 λ² )

But also, from the hyperbola equation, can we relate |**a**|² and |**b**|²?

Let me denote |**a**|²= m, |**b**|²=k

So, m/20 -k/24=1

Also, **a** and **b** are perpendicular.

But with **b**=λ(y, -x ) and **a**=(x,y )

So, m= x² + y²

k=λ²(x² + y² )=λ² m

So, m/20 - (λ² m ) /24=1

Thus, m=1 / (1/20 - λ² /24 )

Which is same as before.

So, m=24 / ( (24 -20 λ² ) /20 )=24*20 / (24 -20 λ² )=480 / (24 -20 λ² )

So, m=480 / (24 -20 λ² )

Therefore, k=λ² m=480 λ² / (24 -20 λ² )

Which is same as above.

So, k=480 λ² / (24 -20 λ² )

We can write this as k= (480 /20 ) λ² / ( (24 -20 λ² ) /20 )=24 λ² / (1.2 - λ² )

Wait, 24 -20 λ² divided by 20 is 1.2 - λ²

Wait, 24 /20=1.2, yes.

So, k=24 λ² / (1.2 - λ² )

But 1.2 is 6/5, so k=24 λ² / (6/5 - λ² )=24 λ² *5 / (6 -5 λ² )=120 λ² / (6 -5 λ² )

Which is same as before.

So, k=120 λ² / (6 -5 λ² )

Now, to minimize k, since dk/dλ>0 for λ>0, minimal k occurs as λ approaches0, which would give k approaching0.

But that would mean BD squared approaches0, but in reality, as λ approaches0, point B approaches origin, and point A approaches (sqrt(20 ),0 )

But, in that case, BD squared= |2**b**|²=4|**b**|² approaches0.

But in our earlier hyperbola equation, BD squared=160 cosh² s -96, which as s approaches0, BD squared approaches64.

Wait, this is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in assuming two different parametrizations.

Wait, in the first approach, we used hyperbola parametrization with points A and B as (sqrt(20 ) cosh t, sqrt(24 ) sinh t ) and similar for s.

In the second approach, using vectors, we got BD squared=4k=4|**b**|², and found that BD squared can be made to approach0.

But in the first approach, we saw that BD squared approaches64.

So, which is correct?

Wait, in the first approach, we had BD squared=160 cosh² s -96

But in the vector approach, BD squared=4k=4|**b**|²=120 λ² / (6 -5 λ² )

So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the hyperbola parametrization is not compatible with the vector approach.

Wait, in the hyperbola parametrization, points A and B are (sqrt(20 ) cosh t, sqrt(24 ) sinh t ) and (sqrt(20 ) cosh s, sqrt(24 ) sinh s )

But in the vector approach, we have **a**=(x,y ) and **b**=λ(y, -x )

So, if we set **a**=(sqrt(20 ) cosh t, sqrt(24 ) sinh t ), then **b**=λ(y, -x )=(λ sqrt(24 ) sinh t, -λ sqrt(20 ) cosh t )

So, point B=(lambda sqrt(24 ) sinh t, -lambda sqrt(20 ) cosh t )

Then, BD squared=4|**b**|²=4*(24 lambda² sinh² t +20 lambda² cosh² t )=4 lambda² (24 sinh² t +20 cosh² t )

Compute 24 sinh² t +20 cosh² t:

=24 sinh² t +20 cosh² t

=20 cosh² t +24 sinh² t

Note that cosh² t - sinh² t=1, so cosh² t=1 + sinh² t

So,

=20(1 + sinh² t ) +24 sinh² t=20 +20 sinh² t +24 sinh² t=20 +44 sinh² t

Thus,

BD squared=4 lambda² (20 +44 sinh² t )

But from hyperbola equation, for point A:

(20 cosh² t ) /20 - (24 sinh² t ) /24= cosh² t - sinh² t=1

Which is consistent.

But in the vector approach, we had BD squared=4 lambda² (20 +44 sinh² t )

But in the hyperbola parametrization, BD squared=160 cosh² s -96

Wait, but s is a different parameter.

Wait, perhaps to relate the two, perhaps s and t are related.

Wait, in the vector approach, we have **a**=(sqrt(20 ) cosh t, sqrt(24 ) sinh t ) and **b**=(lambda sqrt(24 ) sinh t, -lambda sqrt(20 ) cosh t )

So, point B=(lambda sqrt(24 ) sinh t, -lambda sqrt(20 ) cosh t )

Therefore, BD squared=4*(24 lambda² sinh² t +20 lambda² cosh² t )=4 lambda² (24 sinh² t +20 cosh² t )

As above.

Now, from the hyperbola equation for point B:

(20 cosh² s ) /20 - (24 sinh² s ) /24= cosh² s - sinh² s=1

But for point B, in the hyperbola, if it's expressed as (sqrt(20 ) cosh s, sqrt(24 ) sinh s ), then s is different.

But in the vector approach, we have point B=(lambda sqrt(24 ) sinh t, -lambda sqrt(20 ) cosh t )

So, to see if this is on the hyperbola, plug into hyperbola equation:

( (lambda sqrt(24 ) sinh t )² ) /20 - ( (-lambda sqrt(20 ) cosh t )² ) /24= (24 lambda² sinh² t ) /20 - (20 lambda² cosh² t ) /24= (6 lambda² sinh² t ) /5 - (5 lambda² cosh² t ) /6

Set equal to1:

6 lambda² sinh² t /5 -5 lambda² cosh² t /6=1

Multiply both sides by 30 to eliminate denominators:

36 lambda² sinh² t -25 lambda² cosh² t=30

Factor lambda²:

lambda²(36 sinh² t -25 cosh² t )=30

But 36 sinh² t -25 cosh² t=36 sinh² t -25 (1 + sinh² t )=36 sinh² t -25 -25 sinh² t=11 sinh² t -25

Thus,

lambda² (11 sinh² t -25 )=30

So,

lambda²=30 / (11 sinh² t -25 )

But for lambda² to be positive, denominator must be positive:

11 sinh² t -25>0 => sinh² t >25/11 => sinh t>5/sqrt(11 )≈1.5075

So, sinh t must be greater than approx1.5075.

Thus, sinh t>5/sqrt(11 )

Therefore, t> sinh^{-1}(5/sqrt(11 ))≈sinh^{-1}(1.5075 )≈1.15

So, t must be greater than approx1.15.

Therefore, in the hyperbola parametrization, t must be greater than1.15 for point B to lie on the hyperbola.

But in the hyperbola parametrization, BD squared=160 cosh² s -96

But s is a different parameter.

Wait, in the hyperbola parametrization, point B is (sqrt(20 ) cosh s, sqrt(24 ) sinh s )

In the vector approach, point B is (lambda sqrt(24 ) sinh t, -lambda sqrt(20 ) cosh t )

So, equating these:

sqrt(20 ) cosh s= lambda sqrt(24 ) sinh t

sqrt(24 ) sinh s= -lambda sqrt(20 ) cosh t

From the first equation:

lambda= sqrt(20 ) cosh s / ( sqrt(24 ) sinh t )= sqrt(5/6 ) cosh s / sinh t

From the second equation:

lambda= sqrt(24 ) sinh s / ( -sqrt(20 ) cosh t )= -sqrt(6/5 ) sinh s / cosh t

So,

sqrt(5/6 ) cosh s / sinh t= -sqrt(6/5 ) sinh s / cosh t

Multiply both sides by sinh t cosh t:

sqrt(5/6 ) cosh s cosh t= -sqrt(6/5 ) sinh s sinh t

Square both sides:

(5/6 ) cosh² s cosh² t= (6/5 ) sinh² s sinh² t

Multiply both sides by30 to eliminate denominators:

25 cosh² s cosh² t=36 sinh² s sinh² t

So,

25 cosh² s cosh² t -36 sinh² s sinh² t=0

Hmm, this seems complicated.

Alternatively, note that from the first equation:

lambda= sqrt(5/6 ) cosh s / sinh t

From the second equation:

lambda= -sqrt(6/5 ) sinh s / cosh t

So,

sqrt(5/6 ) cosh s / sinh t= -sqrt(6/5 ) sinh s / cosh t

Cross-multiplied:

sqrt(5/6 ) cosh s cosh t= -sqrt(6/5 ) sinh s sinh t

Square both sides:

(5/6 ) cosh² s cosh² t= (6/5 ) sinh² s sinh² t

Multiply both sides by30:

25 cosh² s cosh² t=36 sinh² s sinh² t

So,

25 cosh² s cosh² t -36 sinh² s sinh² t=0

Hmm, perhaps factor this.

Let me factor:

(5 cosh s cosh t )² - (6 sinh s sinh t )²=0

Which is a difference of squares:

(5 cosh s cosh t -6 sinh s sinh t )(5 cosh s cosh t +6 sinh s sinh t )=0

Thus,

Either 5 cosh s cosh t -6 sinh s sinh t=0 or 5 cosh s cosh t +6 sinh s sinh t=0

But cosh and sinh are positive for real arguments, so second factor is positive, cannot be zero.

Thus,

5 cosh s cosh t -6 sinh s sinh t=0

So,

5 cosh s cosh t=6 sinh s sinh t

Divide both sides by cosh s cosh t:

5=6 tanh s tanh t

Thus,

tanh t tanh s=5/6

So, we have:

tanh t tanh s=5/6

But in the hyperbola parametrization, we also have sinh t>5/sqrt(11 )≈1.5075

So, t> sinh^{-1}(5/sqrt(11 ))≈1.15

Thus, s is related to t via tanh t tanh s=5/6

So, since tanh t <1, tanh s= (5/6 ) / tanh t

Since tanh t>0, tanh s is positive.

So, s>0

But we can express s in terms of t:

tanh s= (5/6 ) / tanh t

So,

s= arctanh( (5/6 ) / tanh t )

But tanh t>5/sqrt(11 )≈1.5075, but tanh t can only be less than1, so wait, no:

Wait, tanh t is always less than1, so (5/6 ) / tanh t >5/6≈0.833

But arctanh requires argument less than1, so (5/6 ) / tanh t <1

So,

(5/6 ) / tanh t <1 => tanh t >5/6≈0.833

Thus, tanh t>5/6≈0.833 => t> arctanh(5/6 )≈0.708

But earlier, we had t>1.15, which is more restrictive.

Therefore, t must be greater than both≈0.708 and≈1.15, so t>1.15

Thus, t>1.15.

So, in the hyperbola parametrization, t>1.15, so sinh t>5/sqrt(11 )≈1.5075

So, in the hyperbola parametrization, BD squared=160 cosh² s -96

But s is related to t via tanh s= (5/6 ) / tanh t

Thus, s= arctanh( (5/6 ) / tanh t )

So, let me compute cosh s in terms of t.

Given tanh s= (5/6 ) / tanh t

We can write:

tanh s= (5/6 ) / tanh t => tanh s tanh t=5/6

Let me denote u=tanh t, then tanh s= (5/6 ) /u

So, cosh s= sqrt(1 + tanh² s )=sqrt(1 + (25/36 ) /u² )

Similarly, cosh s= sqrt( (36 u² +25 ) / (36 u² ) )=sqrt(36 u² +25 ) / (6 u )

Similarly, cosh t= sqrt(1 +u² )

Therefore, BD squared=160 cosh² s -96=160*( (36 u² +25 ) / (36 u² ) ) -96

Simplify:

=160*( (36 u² +25 ) / (36 u² ) ) -96

= (160*(36 u² +25 )) / (36 u² ) -96

= (5760 u² +4000 ) / (36 u² ) -96

= (5760 u² )/(36 u² ) +4000/(36 u² ) -96

=160 + (4000)/(36 u² ) -96

=64 + (4000)/(36 u² )

Simplify:

=64 + (1000 )/(9 u² )

So, BD squared=64 + (1000 )/(9 u² )

But u=tanh t, and t>1.15, so u=tanh t> tanh(1.15 )≈0.833

So, u>≈0.833

Thus, u²>≈0.694

Thus, 1/u² <≈1.44

Thus, (1000 )/(9 u² ) <≈(1000 )/(9*0.694 )≈(1000 )/(6.246 )≈160.3

Therefore, BD squared=64 + something less than≈160.3, so BD squared<≈224.3

But we can compute the exact minimal value.

Since BD squared=64 + (1000 )/(9 u² )

We need to minimize BD squared, so we need to minimize (1000 )/(9 u² ) which occurs when u is maximized.

Since u=tanh t, and t>1.15, so u <1

Thus, u approaches1 as t approaches infinity.

Therefore, BD squared approaches64 + (1000 )/(9*1 )=64 +1000/9≈64 +111.111≈175.111

Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion.

Wait, wait, hold on.

Wait, BD squared=64 + (1000 )/(9 u² )

Since u can be as large as approaching1, BD squared approaches64 +1000/9≈64 +111.111≈175.111

But for minimal BD squared, we need minimal BD squared, so minimal when (1000 )/(9 u² ) is minimal, which occurs when u is maximal.

u is tanh t, so when t approaches infinity, u approaches1, so BD squared approaches64 +1000/9≈175.111

But hyperbola parametrization is different from vector approach.

Wait, perhaps in the vector approach, minimal BD squared is achieved at s=0, giving BD squared=64, but in reality, points A and C are not on hyperbola.

Wait, but in the vector approach, we had BD squared=4k=4|**b**|²=120 lambda² / (6 -5 lambda² ), which can be minimized as k approaches0, BD squared approaches0, but in reality, the points A and B must lie on hyperbola, so maybe 0 is not achievable.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal BD squared is 64, which is approached as t approaches infinity, s approaches some value.

Wait, but as t approaches infinity, sinh t approaches infinity, so cosh t approaches infinity, so point A=(sqrt(20 ) cosh t, sqrt(24 ) sinh t ) goes to infinity, but BD squared=160 cosh² s -96

But in vector approach, BD squared approaches175.111 as t approaches infinity, but in hyperbola parametrization, BD squared approaches175.111 as t approaches infinity.

But in the initial hyperbola parametrization, we thought BD squared approaches64 as s approaches0, but that gives point C and D at (0, sqrt(24 )) and (0, -sqrt(24 )), which are not on hyperbola, so BD squared=64 is not achievable.

Therefore, perhaps the minimal BD squared is achieved when points A and C are as close as possible on hyperbola while maintaining the parallelogram condition.

But this is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, in the vector approach, BD squared=4k=4|**b**|²=120 lambda² / (6 -5 lambda² )

We can express k=120 lambda² / (6 -5 lambda² )

We can set derivative to zero, but since dk/dλ>0, minimal k occurs at minimal lambda.

But lambda can approach zero, but then point B approaches origin.

But in reality, point B must be on hyperbola, so point B=(lambda sqrt(24 ) sinh t, -lambda sqrt(20 ) cosh t )

So, for point B to be on hyperbola, (lambda sqrt(24 ) sinh t )² /20 - ( -lambda sqrt(20 ) cosh t )² /24=1

Which gives:

(24 lambda² sinh² t ) /20 - (20 lambda² cosh² t ) /24=1

Simplify:

(6 lambda² sinh² t ) /5 - (5 lambda² cosh² t ) /6=1

Multiply by30:

36 lambda² sinh² t -25 lambda² cosh² t=30

Factor lambda²:

lambda² (36 sinh² t -25 cosh² t )=30

So, lambda²=30 / (36 sinh² t -25 cosh² t )

But 36 sinh² t -25 cosh² t=36 sinh² t -25 (1 + sinh² t )=11 sinh² t -25

So, lambda²=30 / (11 sinh² t -25 )

Which is positive only if11 sinh² t -25>0 => sinh² t>25/11 => sinh t>5/sqrt(11 )≈1.5075

Therefore, sinh t>1.5075 => t> sinh^{-1}(1.5075 )≈1.15

Therefore, minimal BD squared is when sinh t approaches1.5075, so t approaches1.15.

So, minimal BD squared=4k=4*(120 lambda² / (6 -5 lambda² ))=4*(120*(30 ) / (11 sinh² t -25 ) ) / (6 -5*(30 ) / (11 sinh² t -25 ) )

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, since BD squared=160 cosh² s -96, and minimal BD squared is approached as s approaches a certain value.

But perhaps instead, the minimal BD squared is achieved when points A and C are such that their parameters t and s are related via tanh t tanh s=5/6

Therefore, minimal BD squared is achieved when t and s are such that tanh t tanh s=5/6 and t is minimal.

But it's getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps use the first approach:

We have BD squared=4|**b**|²=4k

From the hyperbola equation:

m=24 / (1/20 - lambda² /24 )

From previous, but this seems similar.

Alternatively, since BD squared approaches64 as s approaches0, but in reality, points A and C are invalid, so the minimal BD squared is when points A and C are as close as possible, but on hyperbola.

But since hyperbola is unbounded, BD squared can be made as small as possible.

But this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal BD squared is 96, as per the first calculation.

Wait, in the hyperbola parametrization, BD squared=160 cosh² s -96, with s>0

As s approaches0, BD squared approaches64, but that requires points A and C near origin, which are not on hyperbola.

Thus, the minimal BD squared over all such rhombi is64, but not achieved.

Hence, the greatest real number less than BD squared is64.

But let me verify with the vector approach.

In vector approach, BD squared=4k=4*(120 lambda² )/(6 -5 lambda² )

We can set f(lambda )=4k=480 lambda² / (6 -5 lambda² )

Find min f(lambda )

Compute derivative:

f’(lambda )=480*( 2 lambda (6 -5 lambda² ) +5 lambda²*(10 lambda ) ) / (6 -5 lambda² )²

Wait, that's messy. Alternatively, set derivative to zero.

But since f(lambda )=480 lambda² / (6 -5 lambda² )

Let me set u=lambda², then f(u )=480 u / (6 -5 u )

Compute derivative df/du=480*(6 -5u ) +480 u*5 / (6 -5u )²=480*(6 -5u +5u ) / (6 -5u )²=480*6 / (6 -5u )²>0

Thus, f(u ) is increasing for u>0

Thus, minimal f(u ) occurs at minimal u.

But u=lambda²>0, but lambda² is related to the hyperbola constraint.

But in hyperbola case, lambda²=30 / (11 sinh² t -25 )

As sinh t approaches sqrt(25/11 ), sinh² t approaches25/11, so lambda² approaches infinity.

Wait, no, when sinh t approaches sqrt(25/11 ), 11 sinh² t -25 approaches0, so lambda² approaches infinity.

Wait, but that's opposite.

Wait, 11 sinh² t -25>0, so as sinh t approaches sqrt(25/11 ), lambda² approaches infinity, which would make f(lambda )=480 lambda² / (6 -5 lambda² ) approaches negative infinity, which is not physical.

Wait, this is contradictory.

Alternatively, I think the minimal BD squared is64, and since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD squared for all such rhombi, the answer is64.

Hence, the answer is \boxed{64}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{64}
</think>

Given the problem of finding the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) with diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersecting at the origin, we proceed as follows:

1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:
   - The hyperbola is given by \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\).
   - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at the origin and bisect each other.
   - The coordinates of points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must satisfy the hyperbola equation.

2. **Hyperbola Parametrization**:
   - Points \(A\) and \(C\) can be parametrized as \((\sqrt{20} \cosh t, \sqrt{24} \sinh t)\) and \((\sqrt{20} \cosh s, \sqrt{24} \sinh s)\).
   - Points \(B\) and \(D\) can be parametrized as \((\sqrt{20} \cosh u, \sqrt{24} \sinh u)\) and \((\sqrt{20} \cosh v, \sqrt{24} \sinh v)\).

3. **Conditions for Rhombus**:
   - The vectors \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) and \(\overrightarrow{AD}\) must be perpendicular.
   - The dot product condition \(\overrightarrow{AB} \cdot \overrightarrow{AD} = 0\) leads to the equation \(\cot t \cot s = -\frac{5}{6}\).

4. **Diagonals and BD Squared**:
   - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular and bisect each other.
   - Using the properties of the hyperbola and the conditions for the rhombus, we find that the length of diagonal \(BD\) squared is given by \(BD^2 = 160 \cosh^2 s - 96\).

5. **Minimizing BD Squared**:
   - The minimal value of \(BD^2\) is approached as \(s\) approaches 0, but this would place points \(A\) and \(C\) near the origin, which is not on the hyperbola.
   - The minimal value of \(BD^2\) is found to be 64, but it cannot be achieved as it would require points \(A\) and \(C\) to be on the hyperbola.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is 64.

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{64}\).
