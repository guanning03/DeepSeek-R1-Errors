Question:
Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.

Correct Answer:
By Euler's formula $OI^{2}=R(R-2r)$, we have $OI^{2}=13(13-12)=13$. Thus, by the Pythagorean theorem, $AI^{2}=13^{2}-13=156$. Let $AI\cap(ABC)=M$; notice $\triangle AOM$ is isosceles and $\overline{OI}\perp\overline{AM}$ which is enough to imply that $I$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AM}$, and $M$ itself is the midpoint of $II_{a}$ where $I_{a}$ is the $A$-excenter of $\triangle ABC$. Therefore, $AI=IM=MI_{a}=\sqrt{156}$ and $\[AB\cdot AC=AI\cdot AI_{a}=3\cdot AI^{2}=468$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. Also, it says that IA is perpendicular to OI. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay, let's start by drawing a rough sketch of the triangle to visualize everything.

First, I remember that the circumradius R is 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter O is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. So both O and I are important centers in the triangle.

The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. That means the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line segment connecting the incenter I and the circumcenter O. Interesting. So, in the triangle, these two lines are perpendicular.

I think I need to recall some formulas and relationships involving the inradius, circumradius, distances between these centers, and maybe some trigonometric identities.

First, I remember the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumradius: OI^2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Yes, yes, that formula is correct. So, OI squared equals R times (R minus 2r). Since R is 13 and r is 6, let's compute OI:

OI^2 = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Okay, that's manageable.

Now, we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in the triangle, the line IA is perpendicular to OI. So if I consider the triangle formed by points I, O, and A, then OI and IA are perpendicular. So triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I.

Wait, is that correct? So OI is one leg, IA is the other leg, and OA is the hypotenuse. But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, in triangle OIA, we have:

OI^2 + IA^2 = OA^2

We know OI is sqrt(13), OA is 13, so we can solve for IA:

(sqrt(13))^2 + IA^2 = 13^2 => 13 + IA^2 = 169 => IA^2 = 169 - 13 = 156 => IA = sqrt(156). Hmm, sqrt(156) can be simplified: 156 is 4*39, so sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2*sqrt(39).

Okay, so IA is 2*sqrt(39). I need to relate this to AB and AC.

I recall that the length of the angle bisector from a vertex can be related to the sides of the triangle, but in this case, IA is not exactly an angle bisector; rather, it's the distance from the inradius to vertex A. Wait, actually, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A.

Yes, the formula for the distance from the inradius to a vertex is given by IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A, which is BC. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, let me verify that. The distance from the incenter to a vertex can be calculated using the formula:

IA = \sqrt{r^2 + \left(s - a\right)^2}

Yes, that's correct. Similarly, for IB and IC, we have similar expressions.

So, if IA = 2*sqrt(39), and r is 6, then:

2*sqrt(39) = sqrt{6^2 + (s - a)^2} => 2*sqrt(39) = sqrt{36 + (s - a)^2}

Squaring both sides:

4*39 = 36 + (s - a)^2 => 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 => (s - a)^2 = 120 => s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30)

So s - a = 2*sqrt(30). Since s is the semiperimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2, so s - a = (b + c - a)/2. Therefore, (b + c - a)/2 = 2*sqrt(30) => b + c - a = 4*sqrt(30). Hmm, interesting.

Now, I need to find AB * AC. Let me denote AB as c, AC as b, and BC as a. So, we have AB * AC = b * c. So, we need to find b * c.

I also know that the area of triangle ABC can be expressed both in terms of the inradius and the semiperimeter, and in terms of the circumradius and the sides.

First, area = r * s, where r is the inradius and s is the semiperimeter.

Also, area = (a * b * c) / (4R), where R is the circumradius.

So, equating these two expressions:

r * s = (a * b * c) / (4R)

We know r = 6, R = 13, so:

6 * s = (a * b * c) / (4 * 13) => 6 * s = (a * b * c) / 52 => a * b * c = 6 * s * 52 = 312 * s

So, a * b * c = 312 * s. Hmm, but I don't know s yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for the sides in terms of each other.

We also have that (b + c - a) = 4*sqrt(30). So, from this, we can write a = b + c - 4*sqrt(30).

Additionally, I know that in a triangle, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, substituting a into s:

s = ( (b + c - 4*sqrt(30)) + b + c ) / 2 = (2b + 2c - 4*sqrt(30)) / 2 = b + c - 2*sqrt(30)

So, s = b + c - 2*sqrt(30)

But we also have that b + c - a = 4*sqrt(30), which we used earlier.

Also, we have that s = (a + b + c)/2, so from a = b + c - 4*sqrt(30), we can write s = ( (b + c - 4*sqrt(30)) + b + c ) / 2 = (2b + 2c - 4*sqrt(30)) / 2 = b + c - 2*sqrt(30). Yep, consistent.

So, we have s = b + c - 2*sqrt(30)

And a = b + c - 4*sqrt(30)

Also, from the area expressions: area = r*s = 6*s

And area = (a*b*c)/(4*R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52

So, 6*s = (a*b*c)/52 => a*b*c = 312*s

But a*b*c = 312*s, and we can write a in terms of b and c: a = b + c - 4*sqrt(30)

So, substituting a into a*b*c:

(b + c - 4*sqrt(30)) * b * c = 312*s

But s is equal to b + c - 2*sqrt(30). So,

(b + c - 4*sqrt(30)) * b * c = 312*(b + c - 2*sqrt(30))

Hmm, so this is an equation involving b and c. Let me try to denote x = b, y = c for simplicity.

So, equation becomes:

(x + y - 4*sqrt(30)) * x * y = 312*(x + y - 2*sqrt(30))

Let me denote z = x + y, just to simplify. So, z = x + y.

Then, the equation becomes:

(z - 4*sqrt(30)) * x * y = 312*(z - 2*sqrt(30))

So, (z - 4*sqrt(30)) * x * y = 312*(z - 2*sqrt(30))

But I don't know z or x*y yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, I can write x * y = ?

Wait, maybe I can recall the formula that relates the product of two sides in terms of other triangle parameters.

Also, perhaps the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines can be helpful here.

Wait, the Law of Sines relates the sides with the angles and the circumradius: a / sin A = 2R.

Similarly, b / sin B = 2R, c / sin C = 2R.

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for b and c in terms of each other.

Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of s.

Wait, so s = z - 2*sqrt(30), where z = x + y.

So, s = z - 2*sqrt(30)

Also, from a = z - 4*sqrt(30)

So, we have a, b, c in terms of z and x*y.

But I need another equation to relate z and x*y.

Wait, perhaps I can use the area.

We have area = 6*s = 6*(z - 2*sqrt(30)) and area = (a*b*c)/52.

So, 6*(z - 2*sqrt(30)) = (a*b*c)/52

But a = z - 4*sqrt(30), so a*b*c = (z - 4*sqrt(30)) * x * y

So, 6*(z - 2*sqrt(30)) = ( (z - 4*sqrt(30)) * x * y ) / 52

So, 6*52*(z - 2*sqrt(30)) = (z - 4*sqrt(30)) * x * y

Which is 312*(z - 2*sqrt(30)) = (z - 4*sqrt(30)) * x * y

Which is the same as the previous equation. Hmm, so that doesn't add new information.

Wait, maybe we can find another relation. Let's think.

We know that in any triangle, the area is also equal to r*s, which is 6*s, as we have.

Additionally, the area can be expressed by Heron's formula: sqrt[s*(s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c)]

So, 6*s = sqrt[s*(s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c)]

Squaring both sides:

36*s^2 = s*(s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c)

Divide both sides by s (assuming s â‰  0, which it isn't):

36*s = (s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c)

But s - a = 2*sqrt(30), as we found earlier.

Also, s - b = (a + c - b)/2? Wait, no, s - b = (a + c - b)/2. Wait, no, s - b = (a + c - b)/2?

Wait, s = (a + b + c)/2, so s - b = (a + c - b)/2.

Similarly, s - c = (a + b - c)/2.

So, in our case, s - a = (b + c - a)/2 = 2*sqrt(30) as we have.

Similarly, s - b = (a + c - b)/2

s - c = (a + b - c)/2

So, our equation becomes 36*s = (2*sqrt(30)) * ( (a + c - b)/2 ) * ( (a + b - c)/2 )

Simplify:

36*s = 2*sqrt(30) * [ (a + c - b)/2 ] * [ (a + b - c)/2 ]

Simplify the denominators:

36*s = 2*sqrt(30) * ( (a + c - b)*(a + b - c) ) / 4

Simplify 2/4 = 1/2:

36*s = (sqrt(30)/2) * (a + c - b)*(a + b - c)

So, 36*s = (sqrt(30)/2) * (a + c - b)*(a + b - c)

But a + c - b = 2s - 2b, since a + b + c = 2s. Wait, a + c - b = 2s - 2b.

Similarly, a + b - c = 2s - 2c.

So, (a + c - b)*(a + b - c) = (2s - 2b)*(2s - 2c) = 4*(s - b)*(s - c)

Therefore, 36*s = (sqrt(30)/2) * 4*(s - b)*(s - c) => 36*s = 2*sqrt(30)*(s - b)*(s - c)

So, 36*s = 2*sqrt(30)*(s - b)*(s - c)

Divide both sides by 2:

18*s = sqrt(30)*(s - b)*(s - c)

So, (s - b)*(s - c) = (18*s)/sqrt(30) = (18*s*sqrt(30))/30 = (3*s*sqrt(30))/5

So, (s - b)*(s - c) = (3*s*sqrt(30))/5

Hmm, but I don't know s or b or c.

Alternatively, maybe express (s - b)*(s - c) in terms of a.

Wait, s - b = (a + c - b)/2, s - c = (a + b - c)/2

So, (s - b)*(s - c) = [ (a + c - b)/2 ] * [ (a + b - c)/2 ] = [ (a + c - b)(a + b - c) ] / 4

But we can also write (a + c - b)(a + b - c) = [a + (c - b)][a - (c - b)] = a^2 - (c - b)^2

So, (s - b)*(s - c) = [a^2 - (c - b)^2]/4

So, putting it back:

[ a^2 - (c - b)^2 ] / 4 = (3*s*sqrt(30))/5

Multiply both sides by 4:

a^2 - (c - b)^2 = (12*s*sqrt(30))/5

Hmm, but I don't know (c - b)^2 or a^2. Maybe I can find a relation between these.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express (c - b)^2 in terms of other variables.

Wait, I know that a = b + c - 4*sqrt(30). So, a = b + c - 4*sqrt(30). So, let's denote this as equation (1).

Also, from the Law of Cosines, we have:

a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc*cos A

But I don't know angle A. Hmm, maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express (c - b)^2 as:

(c - b)^2 = c^2 - 2bc + b^2

So, a^2 - (c - b)^2 = (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc*cos A) - (c^2 - 2bc + b^2) = -2bc*cos A + 2bc

So, a^2 - (c - b)^2 = 2bc(1 - cos A)

Wait, is that correct? Let's compute:

a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc*cos A

(c - b)^2 = c^2 - 2bc + b^2

So, a^2 - (c - b)^2 = (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc*cos A) - (c^2 - 2bc + b^2) = -2bc*cos A - (-2bc) = -2bc*cos A + 2bc = 2bc(1 - cos A)

Yes, that's correct.

So, a^2 - (c - b)^2 = 2bc(1 - cos A)

So, from the earlier equation:

a^2 - (c - b)^2 = (12*s*sqrt(30))/5

So,

2bc(1 - cos A) = (12*s*sqrt(30))/5 => bc(1 - cos A) = (6*s*sqrt(30))/5

Hmm, so if I can find 1 - cos A, then I can relate it to bc.

But I don't know cos A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find cos A using the Law of Cosines.

Wait, but I don't know sides b and c. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find another relation.

Wait, earlier, we had that s = b + c - 2*sqrt(30). So, s = b + c - 2*sqrt(30)

We can also express bc in terms of s.

Wait, but I don't have bc directly. Maybe I can relate bc with other terms.

Wait, let's denote bc = k, so we can write some equations in terms of k.

So, bc = k.

So, from the previous equation:

k*(1 - cos A) = (6*s*sqrt(30))/5

Also, from the Law of Cosines:

a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc*cos A

But a = b + c - 4*sqrt(30). So, let's square that:

a^2 = (b + c - 4*sqrt(30))^2 = b^2 + c^2 + 16*30 + 2bc*(-4*sqrt(30)) = b^2 + c^2 + 240 - 8*sqrt(30)*bc

So, a^2 = b^2 + c^2 + 240 - 8*sqrt(30)*bc

But from the Law of Cosines, a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc*cos A

So,

b^2 + c^2 - 2bc*cos A = b^2 + c^2 + 240 - 8*sqrt(30)*bc

Simplify:

-2bc*cos A = 240 - 8*sqrt(30)*bc

So,

-2bc*cos A = 240 - 8*sqrt(30)*bc

Divide both sides by bc (assuming bc â‰  0, which it isn't):

-2*cos A = (240 / bc) - 8*sqrt(30)

So,

-2*cos A = (240 / k) - 8*sqrt(30), where k = bc

From the previous equation, we had:

k*(1 - cos A) = (6*s*sqrt(30))/5

So, 1 - cos A = (6*s*sqrt(30))/(5k)

So, cos A = 1 - (6*s*sqrt(30))/(5k)

Plugging into the equation above:

-2*(1 - (6*s*sqrt(30))/(5k)) = (240 / k) - 8*sqrt(30)

Simplify:

-2 + (12*s*sqrt(30))/(5k) = 240/k - 8*sqrt(30)

Multiply all terms by 5k to eliminate denominators:

-10k + 12*s*sqrt(30) = 1200 - 40*sqrt(30)*k

Bring all terms to left side:

-10k + 12*s*sqrt(30) - 1200 + 40*sqrt(30)*k = 0

Factor terms:

(-10k + 40*sqrt(30)*k) + (12*s*sqrt(30) - 1200) = 0

Factor k:

k*(-10 + 40*sqrt(30)) + (12*s*sqrt(30) - 1200) = 0

So,

k = (1200 - 12*s*sqrt(30)) / ( -10 + 40*sqrt(30) )

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 12*(100 - s*sqrt(30))

Denominator: 10*(-1 + 4*sqrt(30))

Simplify:

k = [12*(100 - s*sqrt(30))] / [10*(-1 + 4*sqrt(30))] = [6*(100 - s*sqrt(30))] / [5*(-1 + 4*sqrt(30))]

Hmm, okay, so k = bc = [6*(100 - s*sqrt(30))]/[5*(-1 + 4*sqrt(30))]

But we also have that s = b + c - 2*sqrt(30). Hmm, so s is expressed in terms of b and c, but we need more relations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express s in terms of k.

Wait, since s = (a + b + c)/2, and a = b + c - 4*sqrt(30), then:

s = ( (b + c - 4*sqrt(30)) + b + c ) / 2 = (2b + 2c - 4*sqrt(30)) / 2 = b + c - 2*sqrt(30)

So, s = b + c - 2*sqrt(30)

But in terms of k and other variables, not sure.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, we can use the formula that relates r, R, and other terms.

Wait, I remember the formula that:

1/r = 1/(4R) + (sin(A/2) + sin(B/2) + sin(C/2))/(2R)

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that in a triangle,

cot(A/2) = (s - a)/r

Similarly for B and C.

So, cot(A/2) = (s - a)/r = (2*sqrt(30))/6 = sqrt(30)/3

So, cot(A/2) = sqrt(30)/3, so tan(A/2) = 3/sqrt(30) = sqrt(30)/10

Hmm, so tan(A/2) = sqrt(30)/10

I also know that in triangle ABC, tan(A/2) = r / (s - a). Wait, that's another formula. Wait, yes, tan(A/2) = r / (s - a). So, in our case, tan(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(30)) = 6 / (2*sqrt(30)) = 3 / sqrt(30) = sqrt(30)/10, which matches our earlier result. So, that's consistent.

But how does this help me? Maybe I can find sin A or cos A.

Since tan(A/2) = sqrt(30)/10, we can find sin A and cos A.

Recall that:

sin A = 2*sin(A/2)*cos(A/2)

And cos A = cos^2(A/2) - sin^2(A/2)

But we can express sin(A/2) and cos(A/2) in terms of tan(A/2).

Since tan(A/2) = sqrt(30)/10, we can construct a right triangle where the opposite side is sqrt(30) and the adjacent side is 10, so the hypotenuse is sqrt(30 + 100) = sqrt(130).

Therefore,

sin(A/2) = sqrt(30)/sqrt(130) = sqrt(30/130) = sqrt(3/13)

cos(A/2) = 10/sqrt(130) = sqrt(100/130) = sqrt(10/13)

Therefore,

sin A = 2*sin(A/2)*cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(3/13))*(sqrt(10/13)) = 2*sqrt(30)/13

Similarly,

cos A = cos^2(A/2) - sin^2(A/2) = (10/13) - (3/13) = 7/13

So, cos A = 7/13, sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13

Okay, so now we can go back to our earlier equation.

From the Law of Cosines, we had:

-2*cos A = (240 / k) - 8*sqrt(30)

But we found cos A = 7/13

So,

-2*(7/13) = (240 / k) - 8*sqrt(30)

Simplify:

-14/13 = (240 / k) - 8*sqrt(30)

So,

240/k = 8*sqrt(30) - 14/13

Multiply both sides by k:

240 = k*(8*sqrt(30) - 14/13)

Therefore,

k = 240 / (8*sqrt(30) - 14/13)

Let me rationalize the denominator or simplify this expression.

First, let's write 8*sqrt(30) - 14/13 as a single fraction:

8*sqrt(30) = (104*sqrt(30))/13, so 8*sqrt(30) - 14/13 = (104*sqrt(30) - 14)/13

Therefore,

k = 240 / [ (104*sqrt(30) - 14)/13 ] = 240 * 13 / (104*sqrt(30) - 14 )

Simplify numerator:

240 * 13 = 3120

So,

k = 3120 / (104*sqrt(30) - 14)

We can factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 3120

Denominator: 104*sqrt(30) - 14

Let me see if 104 and 14 have a common factor: 2.

So, 104 = 2*52, 14 = 2*7

So, factor 2:

Denominator: 2*(52*sqrt(30) - 7)

Similarly, numerator: 3120 = 2*1560

So,

k = (2*1560) / (2*(52*sqrt(30) - 7)) = 1560 / (52*sqrt(30) - 7)

Now, let's rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (52*sqrt(30) + 7):

k = [1560*(52*sqrt(30) + 7)] / [ (52*sqrt(30))^2 - 7^2 ]

Calculate denominator:

(52*sqrt(30))^2 = 52^2 * 30 = 2704 * 30 = 81120

7^2 = 49

So, denominator = 81120 - 49 = 81071

Numerator: 1560*(52*sqrt(30) + 7) = 1560*52*sqrt(30) + 1560*7

Compute 1560*52:

1560*50 = 78,000

1560*2 = 3,120

Total: 78,000 + 3,120 = 81,120

So, numerator: 81,120*sqrt(30) + 10,920

So,

k = (81,120*sqrt(30) + 10,920) / 81,071

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me check the earlier steps.

We had:

-2*cos A = (240 / k) - 8*sqrt(30)

cos A = 7/13, so:

-14/13 = (240 / k) - 8*sqrt(30)

So,

240/k = 8*sqrt(30) - 14/13

So,

240/k = (104*sqrt(30) - 14)/13

Therefore,

k = 240 * 13 / (104*sqrt(30) - 14) = 3120 / (104*sqrt(30) - 14)

Which is what we had before.

Then, factoring numerator and denominator:

3120 = 240*13

104*sqrt(30) -14 = 2*(52*sqrt(30) -7)

So, k = (240*13)/(2*(52*sqrt(30)-7)) = (120*13)/(52*sqrt(30)-7) = 1560/(52*sqrt(30)-7)

Then, rationalizing:

1560*(52*sqrt(30)+7) / [ (52*sqrt(30))^2 -7^2 ] = [1560*(52*sqrt(30)+7)] / [81120 -49] = [1560*(52*sqrt(30)+7)] / 81071

So, 1560*(52*sqrt(30)+7) = 1560*52*sqrt(30) + 1560*7 = 81,120*sqrt(30) + 10,920

Therefore, k = (81,120*sqrt(30) + 10,920)/81,071

Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe I can factor numerator and denominator.

Looking at the denominator, 81,071. Let's see if it's a multiple of something.

Wait, 81,071 divided by 13: 13*6,236 = 81,068, so 81,071 -81,068=3, so 81,071=13*6,236 +3, which is not divisible by 13.

Similarly, 81,071: check divisibility by 7: 7*11,581=81,067, 81,071-81,067=4, not divisible by 7.

Check 81,071 divided by 31: 31*2,615=81,065, 81,071-81,065=6, not divisible.

Hmm, perhaps it's a prime number? Maybe not, but it's not obvious.

Similarly, numerator is 81,120*sqrt(30) + 10,920. Hmm, maybe factor 120:

81,120 = 120*676, since 676*120=81,120

Similarly, 10,920 = 120*91

So, numerator: 120*(676*sqrt(30) + 91)

Denominator: 81,071

So, k = 120*(676*sqrt(30) + 91)/81,071

Not sure if that helps. It seems like this approach is getting too complicated.

Perhaps I need to take a different approach.

Wait, going back to the initial problem, maybe I can use trigonometric identities or other triangle centers.

Wait, we know that OI^2 = R(R - 2r) => 13 = 13*1 - 26 => Wait, no, OI^2 = R(R - 2r) => 13 = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) =13*1=13, which checks out.

But that didn't help us find AB*AC.

Wait, perhaps we can use the formula for area in terms of R and r:

Area = r*s = 6*s

Also, Area = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/52

So, 6*s = (a*b*c)/52 => a*b*c = 312*s

But we also have a = b + c - 4*sqrt(30), and s = (a + b + c)/2 = (2b + 2c -4*sqrt(30))/2 = b + c - 2*sqrt(30)

So, s = b + c - 2*sqrt(30)

So, a*b*c = 312*(b + c - 2*sqrt(30))

But a = b + c - 4*sqrt(30), so:

(b + c - 4*sqrt(30))*b*c = 312*(b + c - 2*sqrt(30))

Let me denote p = b + c, q = bc

So, equation becomes:

(p - 4*sqrt(30)) * q = 312*(p - 2*sqrt(30))

So,

(p - 4*sqrt(30)) * q = 312*p - 624*sqrt(30)

So,

q*p - 4*sqrt(30)*q = 312*p -624*sqrt(30)

Bring all terms to left:

q*p -4*sqrt(30)*q -312*p +624*sqrt(30)=0

Factor p and sqrt(30):

p*(q - 312) + sqrt(30)*(-4*q +624)=0

So,

p*(q - 312) = sqrt(30)*(4*q -624)

Divide both sides by sqrt(30):

p*(q - 312)/sqrt(30) = 4*q -624

Let me square both sides to eliminate sqrt(30):

[ p^2*(q - 312)^2 ] / 30 = (4*q -624)^2

Multiply both sides by 30:

p^2*(q -312)^2 = 30*(4*q -624)^2

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe expand both sides.

First, note that 4*q -624 = 4*(q - 156)

So,

p^2*(q - 312)^2 = 30*16*(q - 156)^2 => 30*16=480

So,

p^2*(q - 312)^2 = 480*(q - 156)^2

Take square roots on both sides:

p*(q -312) = sqrt(480)*(q -156)

But sqrt(480) = sqrt(16*30) =4*sqrt(30)

So,

p*(q -312)=4*sqrt(30)*(q -156)

But this is similar to what we had earlier.

Wait, we had:

p*(q -312) = sqrt(30)*(4*q -624) = sqrt(30)*4*(q -156) = 4*sqrt(30)*(q -156)

Which is the same as above.

So, so far, we have:

p*(q -312)=4*sqrt(30)*(q -156)

But p = b + c, q = b*c

So, p = b + c, q = b*c.

But we need another equation to relate p and q.

Wait, from the previous step, when we had:

From the area expressions, we have:

6*s = (a*b*c)/52, and s = b + c -2*sqrt(30), a = b + c -4*sqrt(30)

So, 6*(b + c -2*sqrt(30)) = ( (b + c -4*sqrt(30)) * b*c ) /52

But that's the same as the equation we had earlier, which led us to p and q.

Therefore, perhaps we need to solve for p and q.

Let me write:

p*(q -312)=4*sqrt(30)*(q -156)

So, p*(q -312) =4*sqrt(30)*(q -156)

Let me express p in terms of q:

p = [4*sqrt(30)*(q -156)] / (q -312)

Simplify numerator:

4*sqrt(30)*(q -156) =4*sqrt(30)*q -4*sqrt(30)*156

Denominator: q -312

So,

p = [4*sqrt(30)*q -624*sqrt(30)] / (q -312)

Factor numerator:

4*sqrt(30)*(q - 156) / (q -312)

So,

p = 4*sqrt(30)*(q -156)/(q -312)

But p = b + c, which is related to q = b*c.

We also know that in a triangle, (b + c)^2 >=4*b*c, by AM >= GM.

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express p in terms of q and then use some other relation.

But I don't see another equation.

Wait, maybe we can relate p and q through Heron's formula.

From Heron's formula, we have:

Area^2 = s*(s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c)

But we also have area =6*s, so:

(6*s)^2 = s*(s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c)

So,

36*s^2 = s*(s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c)

Divide both sides by s:

36*s = (s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c)

But we have s - a =2*sqrt(30), and s - b and s - c as (3*s*sqrt(30))/5 from earlier.

Wait, earlier we had:

(s - b)*(s - c) = (3*s*sqrt(30))/5

And (s - a) = 2*sqrt(30)

Therefore,

(s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c) =2*sqrt(30)*(3*s*sqrt(30))/5 =2*sqrt(30)*(3*s*sqrt(30))/5

Simplify:

2*sqrt(30)*3*s*sqrt(30)/5 =2*3*(sqrt(30))^2*s /5=6*30*s /5=18*30*s /5=18*6*s=108*s

So,

36*s =108*s

Which leads to 36*s=108*s, which implies 36s=108s => 72s=0, which is only possible if s=0, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be. So, I must have made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Wait, let's go back.

From Heron's formula:

Area^2 = s*(s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c)

We have:

Area =6*s

So,

(6*s)^2 = s*(s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c)

36*s^2 = s*(s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c)

Divide both sides by s (s â‰ 0):

36*s = (s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c)

But earlier, we computed (s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c) as:

(s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c) = (2*sqrt(30))*(something)

Wait, but I had (s - b)*(s - c) = (3*s*sqrt(30))/5

So,

(s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c) =2*sqrt(30)*(3*s*sqrt(30))/5= (6*30*s)/5=36*s

So,

36*s =36*s

Which is an identity, so no new information.

So, this doesn't help us find s.

Hmm, so perhaps we need another approach.

Wait, going back, we had:

p = [4*sqrt(30)*(q -156)] / (q -312)

But p = b + c, q = b*c

We also have from the Law of Cosines:

a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc*cos A

But a =b + c -4*sqrt(30), and cos A =7/13

So,

(b + c -4*sqrt(30))^2 =b^2 + c^2 -2*b*c*(7/13)

Let me expand the left side:

(b + c)^2 -8*sqrt(30)*(b + c) + 16*30 =b^2 + c^2 - (14/13)*b*c

So,

b^2 + c^2 + 2*b*c -8*sqrt(30)*(b + c) + 480 =b^2 + c^2 - (14/13)*b*c

Subtract b^2 + c^2 from both sides:

2*b*c -8*sqrt(30)*(b + c) +480 = - (14/13)*b*c

Bring all terms to left:

2*b*c + (14/13)*b*c -8*sqrt(30)*(b + c) +480=0

Combine like terms:

(2 +14/13)*b*c -8*sqrt(30)*(b + c) +480=0

Convert 2 to 26/13:

(26/13 +14/13)*b*c -8*sqrt(30)*(b + c) +480=0

So,

40/13 *b*c -8*sqrt(30)*(b + c) +480=0

Multiply both sides by13 to eliminate denominator:

40*b*c -104*sqrt(30)*(b + c) +6240=0

So,

40*q -104*sqrt(30)*p +6240=0

But p = [4*sqrt(30)*(q -156)] / (q -312)

So, substitute p into equation:

40*q -104*sqrt(30)*[4*sqrt(30)*(q -156)/(q -312)] +6240=0

Simplify:

40*q -104*sqrt(30)*[4*sqrt(30)*(q -156)/(q -312)] +6240=0

First, compute the second term:

-104*sqrt(30)*4*sqrt(30)*(q -156)/(q -312)

= -104*4*30*(q -156)/(q -312)

= -12,480*(q -156)/(q -312)

So, equation becomes:

40*q - [12,480*(q -156)/(q -312)] +6240=0

Multiply everything by (q -312) to eliminate denominator:

40*q*(q -312) -12,480*(q -156) +6240*(q -312)=0

Expand each term:

First term:40*q^2 -12,480*q

Second term:-12,480*q +1,958, 480

Third term:6240*q -1,958, 480

Wait, let me compute each term step by step.

First term:40*q*(q -312)=40*q^2 -12,480*q

Second term:-12,480*(q -156)= -12,480*q +12,480*156

Compute 12,480*156:

12,480*100=1,248,000

12,480*50=624,000

12,480*6=74,880

Total:1,248,000 +624,000=1,872,000 +74,880=1,946,880

So, second term: -12,480*q +1,946,880

Third term:6240*(q -312)=6240*q -6240*312

Compute 6240*312:

6240*300=1,872,000

6240*12=74,880

Total:1,872,000 +74,880=1,946,880

So, third term:6240*q -1,946,880

Now, putting it all together:

40*q^2 -12,480*q -12,480*q +1,946,880 +6240*q -1,946,880=0

Combine like terms:

40*q^2 + (-12,480*q -12,480*q +6240*q) + (1,946,880 -1,946,880)=0

Simplify:

40*q^2 + (-18,960*q) +0=0

So,

40*q^2 -18,960*q=0

Factor out q:

q*(40*q -18,960)=0

So, q=0 or 40*q -18,960=0

q=0 is not feasible because q= bc, and sides can't be zero.

So,

40*q -18,960=0 =>40*q=18,960 =>q=18,960/40=474

So, q=474, which is bc=474

Therefore, AB * AC =474

Wait, is that correct? So, after going through all that, the product AB*AC is 474.

But let me check if this makes sense.

So, bc=474.

Given that, going back, s = b + c -2*sqrt(30), and a = b + c -4*sqrt(30)

We can compute p =b + c.

Earlier, we had:

p*(q -312)=4*sqrt(30)*(q -156)

With q=474,

p*(474 -312)=4*sqrt(30)*(474 -156)

Compute 474 -312=162

474 -156=318

So,

p*162=4*sqrt(30)*318

Therefore,

p= (4*sqrt(30)*318)/162

Simplify:

318 and 162 share a common factor: 6

318/6=53, 162/6=27

So,

p= (4*sqrt(30)*53)/27= (212*sqrt(30))/27

So, p= b + c=212*sqrt(30)/27

So, we have b + c=212*sqrt(30)/27 and bc=474

So, b and c are roots of quadratic equation x^2 - p*x + q=0 =>x^2 - (212*sqrt(30)/27)x +474=0

I can compute discriminant:

D= p^2 -4*q= (212^2*30)/27^2 -4*474

Compute 212^2=44,944

So,

D= (44,944*30)/729 - 1,896

= (1,348,320)/729 -1,896

Divide 1,348,320 by729:

729*1840=1,348, 320- let's compute 729*1800=1,312,200

1,348,320 -1,312,200=36,120

729*50=36,450 which is more than 36,120, so 729*49=35,721

36,120 -35,721=399

So, 1,348,320=729*(1800 +49) +399=729*1849 +399

So, 1,348,320 /729=1849 + 399/729=1849 +133/243â‰ˆ1849 +0.547â‰ˆ1849.547

So, Dâ‰ˆ1849.547 -1,896â‰ˆ53.547

So, sqrt(D)=sqrt(53.547)â‰ˆ7.318

So, roots b and c are:

[212*sqrt(30)/27 Â±7.318]/2

Compute 212*sqrt(30)/27:

sqrt(30)â‰ˆ5.477

212*5.477â‰ˆ212*5 +212*0.477â‰ˆ1,060 +101â‰ˆ1,161

1,161 /27â‰ˆ43

So, approx 43.

So, bâ‰ˆ(43 Â±7.318)/2

So, bâ‰ˆ(43 +7.318)/2â‰ˆ50.318/2â‰ˆ25.159

câ‰ˆ(43 -7.318)/2â‰ˆ35.682/2â‰ˆ17.841

So, sides bâ‰ˆ25.159, câ‰ˆ17.841, aâ‰ˆb + c -4*sqrt(30)â‰ˆ25.159 +17.841 -4*5.477â‰ˆ43 -21.908â‰ˆ21.092

So, sides approximately 21.092, 17.841, 25.159

Check if these make sense with R=13 and r=6.

Compute semiperimeter sâ‰ˆ(21.092 +17.841 +25.159)/2â‰ˆ(64.092)/2â‰ˆ32.046

Areaâ‰ˆr*sâ‰ˆ6*32.046â‰ˆ192.276

Compute via Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)]â‰ˆsqrt[32.046*(32.046 -21.092)*(32.046 -17.841)*(32.046 -25.159)]

Compute:

32.046 -21.092â‰ˆ10.954

32.046 -17.841â‰ˆ14.205

32.046 -25.159â‰ˆ6.887

So, productâ‰ˆ32.046*10.954*14.205*6.887

Compute step by step:

32.046*10.954â‰ˆ32.046*10=320.46, 32.046*0.954â‰ˆ30.56, totalâ‰ˆ320.46+30.56â‰ˆ351.02

14.205*6.887â‰ˆ14*6.887â‰ˆ96.418, 0.205*6.887â‰ˆ1.416, totalâ‰ˆ96.418+1.416â‰ˆ97.834

Now, multiply 351.02*97.834â‰ˆ351*97=34,047, 351*0.834â‰ˆ292.7, totalâ‰ˆ34,047 +292.7â‰ˆ34,339.7

So, sqrt(34,339.7)â‰ˆ185.27

But earlier, areaâ‰ˆ192.276, which is close but not exact, probably due to approximated values.

But the key point is that bcâ‰ˆ474, which seems consistent.

Therefore, after a lot of algebraic manipulation and solving, we find that AB * AC = bc =474.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{474}
</think>

Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), where \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), circumradius \( R = 13 \), inradius \( r = 6 \), and in a circumradius \( 13 \). We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

1. **Distance between Incenter and Circumcenter**:
   Using the formula \( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \):
   \[
   OI^2 = 13(13 - 12) = 13
   \]
   Thus, \( OI = \sqrt{13} \).

2. **Distance between Incenter and Vertex**:
   Using the formula \( IA = \sqrt{r^2 + \left(s - a\right)^2} \):
   \[
   IA = \sqrt{6^2 + (s - a)^2} = \sqrt{36 + (s - a)^2}
   \]
   Given \( IA \perp OI \), the distance \( IA \) is:
   \[
   IA = \sqrt{156}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \sqrt{36 + (s - a)^2} = \sqrt{156} \implies 36 + (s - a)^2 = 156 \implies (s - a)^2 = 120 \implies s - a = 2\sqrt{30}
   \]

3. **Semiperimeter and Side Length**:
   Let \( a = BC \), \( b = AC \), and \( c = AB \). Then:
   \[
   s - a = 2\sqrt{30} \implies s = a + 2\sqrt{30}
   \]
   The semiperimeter \( s \) is:
   \[
   s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   a = b + c - 4\sqrt{30}
   \]

4. **Expressing Semiperimeter and Area**:
   Using Heron's formula and the given inradius:
   \[
   \text{Area} = r \cdot s = 6s
   \]
   The area can also be expressed using the circumradius:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{abc}{52}
   \]
   Equating the two expressions for the area:
   \[
   6s = \frac{abc}{52} \implies abc = 312s
   \]

5. **Solving for \( ab \cdot c \)**:
   Using the expressions for \( s \) and \( a \):
   \[
   s = b + c - 2\sqrt{30}
   \]
   Substituting into the area equation:
   \[
   6(b + c - 2\sqrt{30}) = \frac{(b + c - 4\sqrt{30})bc}{52}
   \]
   Simplifying and solving for \( bc \):
   \[
   6s = \frac{abc}{52} \implies abc = 312s
   \]
   After solving the quadratic equation and verifying the discriminant, we find:
   \[
   bc = 474
   \]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is \( \boxed{474} \).
