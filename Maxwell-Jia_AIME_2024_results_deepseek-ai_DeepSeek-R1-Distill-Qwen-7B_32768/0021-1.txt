Question:
Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

Correct Answer:
We will denote $h(x)=4g(f(x))$ for simplicity. Denote $p(x)$ as the first equation and $q(y)$ as the graph of the second. We notice that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ oscillate between 0 and 1. The intersections are thus all in the square $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(1,0)$. Every $p(x)$ wave going up and down crosses every $q(y)$ wave. Now, we need to find the number of times each wave touches 0 and 1.

We notice that $h(x)=0$ occurs at $x=-\frac{3}{4}, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}$, and $h(x)=1$ occurs at $x=-1, -\frac{1}{2}, 0,\frac{1}{2},1$. A sinusoid passes through each point twice during each period, but it only passes through the extrema once. $p(x)$ has 1 period between 0 and 1, giving 8 solutions for $p(x)=0$ and 9 solutions for $p(x)=1$, or 16 up and down waves. $q(y)$ has 1.5 periods, giving 12 solutions for $q(y)=0$ and 13 solutions for $q(y)=1$, or 24 up and down waves. This amounts to $16\cdot24=384$ intersections.

However, we have to be very careful when counting around $(1, 1)$. At this point, $q(y)$ has an infinite downwards slope and $p(x)$ is slanted, giving us an extra intersection; thus, we need to add 1 to our answer to get $\boxed{385}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs:

1. \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)

where \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \) and \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \).

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what the functions \( f \) and \( g \) do. Both are composed of absolute value functions, which I know can create piecewise linear graphs with different slopes in different regions.

Let me write down the definitions again:

- \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \)
- \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \)

So, both \( f \) and \( g \) take an absolute value, subtract a constant, and then take another absolute value.

I think the best approach is to analyze each function separately, figure out their shapes, and then see how they compose when applied to sine and cosine functions.

Starting with \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \):

1. Let me break it down. First, compute \( |x| \). That's a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0).
2. Then subtract \( \frac{1}{2} \). So, \( |x| - \frac{1}{2} \) would shift the V-shape down by \( \frac{1}{2} \). But wait, for negative values, this could create a negative result, so taking the absolute value again is necessary.
3. So, \( ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \) will flip any negative parts of \( |x| - \frac{1}{2} \) back up. So, this function is going to have a W-shape, perhaps?

Let me compute some specific values to get a sense:

- When \( x = 0 \): \( |0| = 0; 0 - 1/2 = -1/2; |-1/2| = 1/2 \). So, \( f(0) = 1/2 \).
- When \( x = 1/2 \): \( |1/2| = 1/2; 1/2 - 1/2 = 0; |0| = 0. \) So, \( f(1/2) = 0 \).
- When \( x = 1 \): \( |1| = 1; 1 - 1/2 = 1/2; |1/2| = 1/2. \) So, \( f(1) = 1/2 \).
- When \( x = -1/2 \): same as \( x = 1/2 \) because of absolute value, so \( f(-1/2) = 0 \).
- When \( x = 1/4 \): \( |1/4| = 1/4; 1/4 - 1/2 = -1/4; |-1/4| = 1/4. \) So, \( f(1/4) = 1/4 \).
- When \( x = 3/4 \): \( |3/4| = 3/4; 3/4 - 1/2 = 1/4; |1/4| = 1/4. \) So, \( f(3/4) = 1/4 \).

Hmm, so plotting these points, it seems like the graph of \( f(x) \) will have a V-shape between \( x = -1/2 \) and \( x = 1/2 \), going down to 0 at \( x = \pm 1/2 \), and then rising again to 1/2 at \( x = \pm 1 \). So, it's symmetric about the y-axis, with peaks at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \pm 1 \), and valleys at \( x = \pm 1/2 \).

Similarly, let's analyze \( g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| \):

- At \( x = 0 \): \( |0| = 0; 0 - 1/4 = -1/4; |-1/4| = 1/4 \). So, \( g(0) = 1/4 \).
- At \( x = 1/4 \): \( |1/4| = 1/4; 1/4 - 1/4 = 0; |0| = 0 \). So, \( g(1/4) = 0 \).
- At \( x = 1 \): \( |1| = 1; 1 - 1/4 = 3/4; |3/4| = 3/4 \). So, \( g(1) = 3/4 \).
- At \( x = 1/2 \): \( |1/2| = 1/2; 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4; |1/4| = 1/4 \). So, \( g(1/2) = 1/4 \).
- At \( x = 3/4 \): \( |3/4| = 3/4; 3/4 - 1/4 = 1/2; |1/2| = 1/2 \). So, \( g(3/4) = 1/2 \).

So, \( g(x) \) will have a V-shape between \( x = -1/4 \) and \( x = 1/4 \), going down to 0 at \( x = \pm 1/4 \), and then rising again to 1/4 at \( x = 0 \), 1/2 at \( x = \pm 3/4 \), and 3/4 at \( x = \pm 1 \). Hmm, so it's a bit different—peaks at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \pm 1 \), but the valleys are at \( x = \pm 1/4 \), with the function at \( x = \pm 1/2 \) being 1/4 and \( x = \pm 3/4 \) being 1/2.

Alright, so now I have a basic idea of what \( f \) and \( g \) look like. They are both W-shaped functions, but \( f \) has deeper valleys and higher peaks compared to \( g \).

Now, let's think about the composite functions involved in \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \).

First, let's break down the expression \( 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \):

1. Start with \( \sin(2\pi x) \). That's a sine wave with period 1, oscillating between -1 and 1.
2. Then, apply \( f \) to it: \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = ||\sin(2\pi x)| - 1/2| \).
3. Then, apply \( g \) to that result: \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = |||\sin(2\pi x)| - 1/2| - 1/4| \).
4. Finally, multiply by 4: \( 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \).

Similarly, for the other equation, \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \):

1. Start with \( \cos(3\pi y) \). That's a cosine wave with period \( 2/3 \), oscillating between -1 and 1.
2. Then, apply \( f \): \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = ||\cos(3\pi y)| - 1/2| \).
3. Apply \( g \): \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = |||\cos(3\pi y)| - 1/2| - 1/4| \).
4. Multiply by 4: \( 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \).

So, both equations are transformations of sine and cosine functions through these absolute value and shift operations.

Given that both \( f \) and \( g \) are non-linear and involve absolute values, these composite functions will have piecewise linear behavior, but it's going to be more complex.

Given the complexity, maybe it's helpful to first understand the range of the inner functions.

Starting with \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):

- The sine function \( \sin(2\pi x) \) has a range of [-1, 1].
- Applying \( f \) to it: \( f(t) = ||t| - 1/2| \), where \( t \in [-1, 1] \).
- Let's analyze \( f(t) \) over t from -1 to 1.

Since \( f(t) \) is even, it's symmetric about t=0. So, we can consider t from 0 to 1 and mirror it.

For t in [0, 1/2]: \( |t| = t, so ||t| - 1/2| = |t - 1/2| = 1/2 - t \).

For t in [1/2, 1]: \( |t| = t, so ||t| - 1/2| = |t - 1/2| = t - 1/2 \).

So, the function \( f(t) \) is a V-shape decreasing from t=0 to t=1/2 and then increasing from t=1/2 to t=1.

Therefore, \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) will oscillate between 0 and 1, with peaks at sin(2πx) = ±1 (giving f(t)=1/2) and minima at sin(2πx)=±1/2 (giving f(t)=0).

Similarly, applying \( g \) to this:

\( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = |||f(\sin(2\pi x))| - 1/4| \). But since f(t) is non-negative (as it's an absolute value function), this simplifies to \( |f(\sin(2\pi x)) - 1/4| \).

Wait, is that right? Let me check:

\( g(t) = ||t| - 1/4| \). So, if t is non-negative (which it is, since f(t) is non-negative), then \( g(t) = |t - 1/4| \).

So, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = |f(\sin(2\pi x)) - 1/4| \).

Therefore, \( 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = 4|f(\sin(2\pi x)) - 1/4| \).

So, now the equation is \( y = 4|f(\sin(2\pi x)) - 1/4| \).

Similarly, for the other equation, \( x = 4|f(\cos(3\pi y)) - 1/4| \).

So, both equations are of the form \( y = 4|f(\sin(2\pi x)) - 1/4| \) and \( x = 4|f(\cos(3\pi y)) - 1/4| \).

That simplifies things a bit. Now, I can think about the behavior of these functions.

First, let's note that both f and g are periodic and involve absolute values, so the composite functions will have periodic behavior as well. However, since they are inside sine and cosine functions, which are also periodic, the entire expressions may have periodicity.

But let's think about the range of each function.

Since \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) ranges from 0 to 1/2 because:

- When \( \sin(2\pi x) = \pm1 \), \( f(t) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2 \).
- When \( \sin(2\pi x) = \pm1/2 \), \( f(t) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0 \).

Wait, actually, when \( t = \sin(2\pi x) \) is in [-1,1], \( f(t) \) is in [0, 1/2].

Similarly, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = |f(t) - 1/4| \), which would range from \( |0 - 1/4| = 1/4 \) to \( |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4 \). Wait, that can't be.

Wait, hold on. If \( f(t) \) is in [0, 1/2], then \( |f(t) - 1/4| \) would be in [0, 1/4]. Because the closest point to 1/4 is 0, which is 1/4 away, and the farthest is 1/2, which is 1/4 away as well. So, actually, \( |f(t) - 1/4| \) is in [0, 1/4].

Hence, \( 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) is in [0, 1].

Similarly, for the other equation, \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \), which is also in [0, 1].

Therefore, both x and y are confined within [0,1]. So, the graphs of \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) lie within the unit square [0,1] x [0,1].

So, now the problem reduces to finding the number of intersections between two curves in the unit square.

Given that both functions are periodic, perhaps the number of intersections can be determined by analyzing their behavior over one period and then extending it.

But let's get back to the definitions.

Let me define \( h(x) = f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( k(y) = f(\cos(3\pi y)) \). Then, \( y = 4| h(x) - 1/4 | \) and \( x = 4| k(y) - 1/4 | \).

So, if I can understand the behavior of h(x) and k(y), I can figure out what 4| h(x) - 1/4 | and 4| k(y) - 1/4 | look like.

Let me first analyze h(x) = f(sin(2πx)).

As we saw earlier, f(t) is ||t| - 1/2|. So, when t = sin(2πx), which oscillates between -1 and 1, f(t) will oscillate between 0 and 1/2.

Specifically, as x varies, sin(2πx) goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 and back to 0, etc. So, over the interval [0,1], sin(2πx) completes one full cycle.

Similarly, f(sin(2πx)) will have the same periodicity as sin(2πx), which is 1. So, h(x) is periodic with period 1.

Similarly, k(y) = f(cos(3πy)).

Since cos(3πy) has a period of 2/(3π) * 2π = 2/3? Wait, no. Wait, the period of cos(ky) is 2π/k. So, for cos(3πy), the period is 2π/(3π) = 2/3.

So, k(y) has a period of 2/3.

Therefore, h(x) has period 1, and k(y) has period 2/3.

Now, let me analyze h(x) over one period [0,1]:

- When x increases from 0 to 1/4: sin(2πx) goes from 0 to sin(π/2) = 1.
  - So, t = sin(2πx) increases from 0 to 1.
  - f(t) = ||t| - 1/2| = |t - 1/2| since t ≥ 0.
  - So, f(t) decreases from |0 - 1/2| = 1/2 to |1 - 1/2| = 1/2. Wait, that's the same.

Wait, hold on. When t goes from 0 to 1, f(t) = |t - 1/2|.

So, when t is from 0 to 1/2, f(t) decreases from 1/2 to 0.

When t is from 1/2 to 1, f(t) increases from 0 to 1/2.

Therefore, over x from 0 to 1/4, t goes from 0 to 1, so f(t) goes from 1/2 to 0 and back to 1/2.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, when x goes from 0 to 1/4, t = sin(2πx) goes from 0 to 1. So, f(t) = |t - 1/2|, which starts at 1/2, decreases to 0 at t=1/2, then increases back to 1/2 at t=1.

Therefore, h(x) over [0,1/4] is a V-shape, decreasing to a minimum at t=1/2 (x=1/8) and then increasing.

Similarly, from x=1/4 to x=1/2, t = sin(2πx) decreases from 1 to 0.

So, f(t) = |t - 1/2|, which when t is decreasing from 1 to 0, f(t) first decreases from 1/2 to 0 at t=1/2 (x=1/8) and then increases to 1/2 at t=0 (x=1/2).

Wait, but x=1/2 is the midpoint, so actually, from x=1/4 to x=1/2, t goes from 1 to 0, so f(t) = |t - 1/2| goes from 1/2 to 0 at t=1/2 (x=1/8) and then to 1/2 again at t=0 (x=1/2). Hmm, that seems symmetric.

Wait, but when x is in [1/4, 1/2], sin(2πx) is decreasing from 1 to 0, so f(t) = |t - 1/2| is decreasing from 1/2 to 0 (as t goes from 1 to 1/2) and then increasing from 0 to 1/2 (as t goes from 1/2 to 0). So, it's symmetric.

Therefore, over [0,1/2], h(x) is a V-shape with minima at x=1/8 and x=3/8, both at f(t)=0.

Wait, hold on, actually, when x=1/8, t=sin(π/4)=√2/2≈0.707, which is above 1/2, so f(t)=t - 1/2≈0.207.

Wait, no, no, no, let me correct that.

Wait, x=1/8: t = sin(2π*(1/8)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈0.707.

So, f(t)=|√2/2 - 1/2|≈|0.707 - 0.5|=0.207.

Similarly, x=3/8: t=sin(2π*(3/8))=sin(3π/4)=√2/2≈0.707.

So, same as above.

Wait, so maybe my previous thought was wrong.

Wait, actually, when x increases from 0 to 1/4, t=sin(2πx) increases from 0 to 1, so f(t) goes from 1/2 to 0 and back to 1/2. So, h(x) is V-shaped in [0,1/4], with a minimum at x=1/8.

Similarly, from x=1/4 to x=1/2, t=sin(2πx) decreases from 1 to 0, so f(t) is |t - 1/2|, which goes from 1/2 to 0 and back to 1/2. So, h(x) is again V-shaped, but mirrored.

Therefore, over [0,1/2], h(x) is a series of Vs, but actually, wait, it's a single V in [0,1/4] and another V in [1/4,1/2], but both mirror images.

Wait, perhaps it's better to graph it step by step.

Let me list some key points for h(x) in [0,1/2]:

- x=0: t=0, f(t)=1/2, so h(x)=1/2.
- x=1/8: t=√2/2≈0.707, f(t)=|√2/2 - 1/2|≈0.207, so h(x)=0.207.
- x=1/4: t=1, f(t)=1/2, so h(x)=1/2.
- x=3/8: t=√2/2≈0.707, same as x=1/8, h(x)=0.207.
- x=1/2: t=0, f(t)=1/2, so h(x)=1/2.

So, between x=0 and x=1/4, h(x) goes from 1/2 down to 0.207 and back to 1/2. Similarly, between x=1/4 and x=1/2, h(x) goes from 1/2 down to 0.207 and back to 1/2.

Therefore, over [0,1/2], h(x) is a series of two Vs, each with a minimum at x=1/8 and x=3/8.

Similarly, from x=1/2 to x=3/4: t=sin(2πx) goes from 0 to -1, so f(t)=|t - 1/2|.

But since t is negative, |t - 1/2| = | - |t| - 1/2 | = ||t| + 1/2| = |t| + 1/2, because |t| is positive.

Wait, no, let me think:

Wait, t is negative, so |t| = -t.

Therefore, f(t) = ||t| - 1/2| = |(-t) - 1/2|.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, f(t) is defined as ||t| - 1/2|. So, it's the absolute value of |t| - 1/2.

So, regardless of t's sign, |t| is positive, so f(t) is the same as for positive t.

Therefore, when t is negative, |t| is positive, so f(t) is same as if t were positive.

Therefore, in x=1/2 to x=3/4, t=sin(2πx) goes from 0 to -1, but f(t) is same as | |t| - 1/2 |, which is same as when t is positive.

So, for t in [0,1], f(t) is V-shaped, peaking at 0 and 1, and dipping to 0 at t=1/2.

Similarly, for t in [-1,0], f(t) is same as for t in [0,1], because of absolute value.

Therefore, when t is negative, f(t) is same as | |t| - 1/2 |, which is same as for positive t.

So, in x=1/2 to x=3/4, t goes from 0 to -1, so f(t) goes from 1/2, down to 0 at t=-1/2 (x=5/8), then back to 1/2 at t=0 (x=3/4).

Similarly, from x=3/4 to x=1: t=sin(2πx) goes from -1 to 0, so f(t) goes from 1/2, down to 0 at t=-1/2 (x=5/8), then back to 1/2.

Therefore, overall, over [0,1], h(x) has the following behavior:

- From x=0 to x=1/4: V-shape from 1/2 down to 0.207 and back.
- From x=1/4 to x=3/4: V-shape from 1/2 down to 0 and back.
- From x=3/4 to x=1: V-shape from 1/2 down to 0.207 and back.

Wait, actually, in [1/4, 3/4], t goes from 1 to -1, so f(t) goes from 1/2, down to 0 at t=-1/2 (x=5/8), then back to 1/2.

Therefore, h(x) in [0,1] has four minima: at x=1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8, each with f(t)=0.207 (approx), and maxima at x=0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1 with f(t)=1/2.

Similarly, for k(y) = f(cos(3πy)).

Let me analyze k(y):

- cos(3πy) has period 2/3, as earlier.
- So, over [0,2/3], it goes from 1 to -1 and back to 1.
- Therefore, similar to h(x), f(cos(3πy)) would have a similar behavior.

But let's compute f(cos(3πy)).

Since cos(3πy) is in [-1,1], f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|.

Again, similar to h(x), f(t) is V-shaped in [0,1], peaking at t=0 and t=1, dipping to 0 at t=1/2.

So, over y in [0,1/3], cos(3πy) goes from 1 to 0.5 to -1 and back.

Wait, let me compute key points:

- y=0: t=cos(0)=1, f(t)=1/2.
- y=1/6: t=cos(π/2)=0, f(t)=1/2.
- y=1/3: t=cos(π)= -1, f(t)=1/2.
- y=1/2: t=cos(3π/2)=0, f(t)=1/2.
- y=2/3: t=cos(2π)=1, f(t)=1/2.

Wait, that seems similar to h(x). Wait, hold on.

Wait, cos(3πy) has period 2/3, so over [0,2/3], it goes from 1 to -1 and back to 1.

So, over [0,1/3], cos(3πy) decreases from 1 to -1.

Wait, but for y in [0,1/3]:

- y=0: t=1
- y=1/6: t=cos(π/2)=0
- y=1/3: t=cos(π)=-1

So, f(t)=||t| - 1/2|, so:

- At y=0: f(1)=1/2
- At y=1/6: f(0)=1/2
- At y=1/3: f(1)=1/2

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, at t=1, f(t)=1/2; at t=0, f(t)=1/2; at t=-1, f(t)=1/2. So, f(t) is 1/2 at all these points.

Wait, but in between:

At t=1/2, which occurs when cos(3πy)=1/2.

So, 3πy = ±π/3 + 2πk.

So, y= (1/3)(±1/3 + 2k).

Within [0,1], the relevant y are:

- y=1/9: t=cos(π/3)=1/2, so f(t)=0
- y=2/9: t=cos(π - π/3)=cos(2π/3)=-1/2, so f(t)=0
- y=4/9: t=cos(π + π/3)=cos(4π/3)=-1/2, f(t)=0
- y=5/9: t=cos(2π - π/3)=cos(5π/3)=1/2, f(t)=0
- Etc.

So, in [0,1/3], f(cos(3πy)) reaches minima at y=1/9, 2/9, etc.

Wait, let me compute f(cos(3πy)) over [0,1/3]:

- y=0: 1, f(t)=1/2
- y=1/9: cos(π/3)=1/2, f(t)=0
- y=1/6: cos(π/2)=0, f(t)=1/2
- y=2/9: cos(2π/3)=-1/2, f(t)=0
- y=1/3: cos(π)=-1, f(t)=1/2

So, in [0,1/3], k(y) goes from 1/2 to 0 at y=1/9, back to 1/2 at y=1/6, then to 0 at y=2/9, back to 1/2 at y=1/3.

Similarly, over [1/3, 2/3], cos(3πy) goes from -1 to 1, so f(t) behaves similarly, dipping to 0 at points where t=±1/2.

And over [2/3,1], it mirrors the behavior of [0,1/3], decreasing from 1/2 to 0 and back.

Therefore, k(y) over [0,1] is similar to h(x), with four minima at y=1/9, 2/9, 4/9, 5/9, etc., with f(t)=0, and maxima at y=0,1/3,2/3,1 with f(t)=1/2.

Thus, both h(x) and k(y) have similar structures, with periodic minima and maxima.

Given that, we can see that both h(x) and k(y) have similar graphs, with peaks at 1/2 and troughs at 0, with four troughs in each period.

Now, going back to the equations:

1. \( y = 4| h(x) - 1/4 | \)
2. \( x = 4| k(y) - 1/4 | \)

Since h(x) ranges from 0 to 1/2, so \( h(x) - 1/4 \) ranges from -1/4 to 1/4. Taking absolute value, \( | h(x) - 1/4 | \) ranges from 0 to 1/4. Then, multiplying by 4, y ranges from 0 to 1.

Similarly, x ranges from 0 to 1.

So, both x and y are constrained between 0 and 1, and the equations define curves within the unit square.

Given that, I can think of these as parametric equations, but I need to find their intersections.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the equations as functions and see where they intersect.

Wait, but they are not functions in the traditional sense because each x can correspond to multiple y's and vice versa. So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of fixed points or symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe I can use symmetry to find the number of intersections.

Given that both functions are periodic and have similar structures, perhaps the number of intersections can be determined by considering the number of times one function crosses the other within each period.

But wait, in this case, the equations are interdependent: y is a function of x, and x is a function of y. So, it's a system of equations:

\( y = 4| h(x) - 1/4 | \)

\( x = 4| k(y) - 1/4 | \)

This is similar to a system where each variable is a function of the other, so it's a kind of reflection or inverse function.

Perhaps, to find the number of solutions, we can consider how many times the curve \( y = 4| h(x) - 1/4 | \) intersects with the curve \( x = 4| k(y) - 1/4 | \).

Alternatively, if I substitute one into the other.

Given \( y = 4| h(x) - 1/4 | \), plug this into the second equation:

\( x = 4| k(4| h(x) - 1/4 | ) - 1/4 | \)

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can consider the behavior over each interval where h(x) and k(y) have linear segments.

Given that both h(x) and k(y) have linear segments between their minima and maxima, maybe we can break down the problem into intervals and count the number of intersections in each interval.

Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to look for the number of solutions by considering the number of times the two functions cross each other.

But it's still tricky because both functions are defined over overlapping intervals.

Alternatively, perhaps using symmetry.

Given that both functions are symmetric around their midpoints, perhaps the number of intersections is symmetric as well.

Moreover, since h(x) and k(y) have similar structures, the system might have a symmetric number of solutions.

Given that, perhaps the number of solutions is 64? Wait, that seems too high.

Wait, 64 is 8x8, but maybe 16? Or perhaps 20?

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of times each function oscillates and crosses the other.

Given that h(x) and k(y) each have four minima and maxima in [0,1], perhaps the curves are quite wiggly, leading to multiple intersections.

Wait, let me think about how y is defined in terms of x and x in terms of y.

Since both are periodic with periods 1 and 2/3, but confined to [0,1], the functions are somewhat overlapping in their periods.

Wait, perhaps I can model the number of solutions by considering how many times each function crosses the other in each interval.

Alternatively, let me try to plot or sketch the functions.

First, for \( y = 4| h(x) - 1/4 | \):

- Since h(x) ranges from 0 to 1/2, \( | h(x) - 1/4 | \) ranges from 0 to 1/4.
- Thus, y ranges from 0 to 1.
- The function is a series of V-shapes, each centered at the minima of h(x).

Similarly, \( x = 4| k(y) - 1/4 | \):

- Similarly, x ranges from 0 to 1.
- The function is a series of V-shapes in y, centered at the minima of k(y).

Given that, perhaps each V-shape in y will intersect with each V-shape in x a certain number of times.

But given that, since both h(x) and k(y) have four minima in [0,1], leading to four V-shapes in each function.

So, perhaps each V-shape in y will intersect with each V-shape in x, leading to multiple intersections.

But the exact number is tricky without precise plotting.

Alternatively, since both functions are symmetric and periodic, and considering the four minima in each, perhaps each function has 8 intersections, but I'm not sure.

Wait, actually, let's consider that each function is made up of 8 linear segments in [0,1], since each has four minima and maxima, leading to eight segments.

Therefore, if we have y as a function of x with eight segments and x as a function of y with eight segments, their intersection could be up to 8x8=64, but that's in the case where each segment crosses each segment once.

But in reality, due to the constraints of the unit square and the shapes of the functions, it's much less.

Wait, but each function is in the unit square, so maybe each function has eight linear segments, leading to 8x8=64 possible intersections, but likely fewer because of overlapping and constraints.

But this seems too high.

Alternatively, perhaps each function has four linear segments, leading to 16 intersections.

But let's think step by step.

First, define h(x):

h(x) has four minima in [0,1], so over [0,1], h(x) has eight linear segments (four increasing, four decreasing). Therefore, \( y = 4| h(x) - 1/4 | \) will have eight linear segments as well.

Similarly, k(y) has four minima in [0,1], leading to eight linear segments in \( x = 4| k(y) - 1/4 | \).

Thus, each equation is a piecewise linear function with eight segments.

Now, when two such piecewise linear functions intersect, the maximum number of intersections is 8x8=64, but in reality, due to the structure, it's fewer.

But in our case, the functions are constrained within [0,1], and both are V-shaped with multiple segments.

However, more importantly, both functions are symmetric and have similar structures, so perhaps each V-shape in y will intersect with each V-shape in x a fixed number of times.

But to figure this out, maybe I should consider the number of times y = f(x) and x = g(y) intersect when f and g are similar functions.

In general, for equations like y = f(x) and x = g(y), the number of solutions can be up to the product of the number of linear segments, but in reality, due to the shapes, it's often 2 per segment, but sometimes more.

Alternatively, think of it as a system where each equation is a function and its inverse. But since these are not inverse functions, but reciprocal in a way.

Wait, perhaps another approach: consider substituting one into the other.

From the first equation: y = 4| h(x) - 1/4 |.

From the second equation: x = 4| k(y) - 1/4 |.

So, substituting the first into the second:

x = 4| k(4| h(x) - 1/4 | ) - 1/4 |.

This is a complicated equation in x, but perhaps I can analyze how many solutions it has.

Given that h(x) is periodic and piecewise linear, and k(y) is similar, this equation would have multiple solutions.

But without precise computation, it's difficult to know the exact number.

Alternatively, perhaps note that both functions are built from similar components, so the number of intersections is the same as the number of fixed points in some sense.

Wait, but maybe it's better to think in terms of how many times each function can cross the other.

Since both functions are within [0,1], and each has multiple peaks and valleys, perhaps each function can intersect with the other multiple times.

But to estimate, let's consider that each function has 8 segments, so the maximum number of intersections is 16.

But in reality, considering the functions are symmetric and have similar shapes, maybe the number is 16.

Wait, 16 seems plausible, but I might be overestimating.

Wait, think about a simpler case: if both functions were straight lines, they would intersect once. If both were Vs, they might intersect twice or four times.

But in our case, both functions are made up of multiple Vs, each with their own minima and maxima.

Given that, perhaps each V in y can intersect with each V in x twice, leading to multiple intersections.

But, for example, each of the eight segments in y can intersect with each of the eight segments in x at most once, so 8x8=64, but that's the upper bound.

But since both functions are constrained within [0,1], and they are actually not crossing the entire range, perhaps the actual number is less.

Alternatively, maybe each function has four intersection points with the other, leading to a total of eight.

But I need a better approach.

Wait, perhaps considering the number of times the function y=4| h(x) -1/4 | crosses the function x=4| k(y)-1/4 |.

Given the periodicity and symmetry, each time a segment of y=4| h(x)-1/4 | crosses a segment of x=4| k(y)-1/4 |, it creates an intersection.

But to find the exact number, maybe it's better to note that both functions have similar structures, so the number of intersections would be the square of the number of segments in each function.

But both functions have eight segments, so 8x8=64, but again, that's the upper bound.

But given the nature of the functions, it's more likely that the number is 64, but that seems too high.

Wait, actually, on second thought, each function y=4| h(x)-1/4 | is a function of x, and x=4| k(y)-1/4 | is a function of y.

So, when we plot these, the first is a function y(x), the second is a function x(y). The intersection points are where both are satisfied.

But since both are defined on [0,1], they might intersect multiple times.

Alternatively, think of it as a system:

y = 4| h(x) - 1/4 |

x = 4| k(y) - 1/4 |

So, plugging y into the second equation:

x = 4| k(4| h(x) - 1/4 | ) - 1/4 |

This is a complicated equation, but perhaps it's symmetric.

Given that both h(x) and k(y) are symmetric about their midpoints, perhaps the equation is symmetric in some way, leading to an even number of solutions.

Alternatively, the number of intersections is 64, but since we are in a unit square, it's impossible.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times each function oscillates.

Given that h(x) has four minima in [0,1], so y=4| h(x)-1/4 | will have similar behavior: four V-shapes in y, each centered at the minima of h(x).

Similarly, x=4| k(y)-1/4 | will have four V-shapes in x, each centered at the minima of k(y).

Therefore, each V-shape in y can potentially intersect with each V-shape in x twice, leading to a total of 4x4x2=32 intersections.

But that seems high.

Alternatively, perhaps each V-shape in y can intersect each V-shape in x once, leading to 4x4=16 intersections.

But considering the symmetry, perhaps the number is 16.

Alternatively, perhaps each function is made of 8 linear segments, so the number of intersections is 8x8=64. But in reality, the functions are continuous and piecewise linear, so the number of intersections is finite.

Wait, actually, each function is a continuous, piecewise linear function with 8 segments, so when you plot them on the unit square, the maximum number of intersections is 16.

But if they are symmetric and carefully constructed, perhaps they intersect 16 times.

But maybe this is overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about how these functions behave.

Each function is a series of Vs, with four minima in each.

Therefore, in the unit square, you can imagine four Vs for y and four Vs for x.

Each V in y would cross each V in x twice, leading to 8x8=64, but considering the overlapping constraints, likely fewer.

Wait, actually, each of the four Vs in y will intersect with each of the four Vs in x a fixed number of times.

But each V-shape is a linear function, so two linear functions can intersect at most once.

Therefore, each pair of V-shapes can intersect at most once.

Given that, the total number of intersections is the number of pairs between the Vs in y and the Vs in x.

Since there are four Vs in y and four Vs in x, the total number of intersections is 4x4=16.

Thus, the number of intersections is 16.

But wait, actually, each V-shape in y can intersect with multiple V-shapes in x.

Wait, but each V-shape is a straight line segment, so each can intersect with each V-shape in x at most once.

Therefore, if there are four V-shapes in y and four V-shapes in x, the maximum number of intersections is 4x4=16.

But in reality, because of the specific shapes, some intersections may overlap or not occur.

But considering that both functions are symmetric and have similar structures, it's likely that they intersect 16 times.

But actually, I think it's 16.

Wait, but in the first equation, y is a function of x, so it's actually a curve in the plane. Similarly, the second equation is x as a function of y.

These are two curves, each defined over [0,1]x[0,1], and their intersection is the set of points (x,y) that satisfy both equations.

Given that, the maximum number of intersections is 16.

But actually, I think the correct number is 16, but I might be overcounting.

Wait, let me think about the number of times each function can cross.

Since y=4| h(x)-1/4 | has eight linear segments, each of which can intersect with the eight segments of x=4| k(y)-1/4 | once, giving 64 intersections, but in reality, since both functions are in [0,1], the number is limited.

But in reality, each function is actually a combination of Vs. So, each function is a union of eight line segments, each of which is either increasing or decreasing.

Thus, the intersection points can be found by solving each pair of segments.

Given that, since each function has eight segments, the maximum number of intersections is 8x8=64, but due to the constraints of the functions, it's much less.

Wait, but perhaps each segment of y=4| h(x)-1/4 | can intersect with each segment of x=4| k(y)-1/4 | once, leading to 64 intersections. But in reality, because of the overlapping ranges, it's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps each function is symmetric and each function has four "lobes" or "arcs", each of which can intersect with the other four arcs twice.

Therefore, 4x4x2=32 intersections.

But perhaps each lobe can only intersect once with each lobe.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the number of intersections in a different way.

Since both functions are symmetric, perhaps the number of intersections is 16.

Alternatively, maybe 64, but that seems too high.

Wait, I think I need a different approach.

Let me try to consider the graphs.

First, y = 4| h(x) - 1/4 |.

Given h(x) is V-shaped with four minima, so y will have peaks at 1 and minima at 0, forming a series of Vs.

Similarly, x = 4| k(y) - 1/4 |, so x is a function of y with similar structure.

Therefore, plotting y against x, you have a figure where both x and y are defined by similar V-shapes.

Therefore, the curves are like a grid of Vs in both x and y directions.

Therefore, the number of intersections is 16.

Wait, but in reality, plotting such functions would result in a grid-like pattern with multiple intersections.

But I think in this case, due to the complexity, the number of intersections is 16.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each function has four intersection points with the other, so total of eight.

But I need to think more carefully.

Wait, let me consider that each function has four minima, so maybe each function has four "lobes" where they go from high to low and back.

Therefore, in the unit square, each function has four lobes crossing the square.

Therefore, each lobe can intersect with the other function's lobes.

Given that, each lobe can intersect with four lobes of the other function, but since they are lobes in perpendicular directions, maybe each lobe intersects twice with each lobe.

Wait, perhaps not, since they are not overlapping in the same plane.

Alternatively, perhaps each function has four peaks and four valleys, so they can intersect eight times.

But no, the number is likely higher.

Wait, perhaps the number of intersections is 16.

Wait, actually, for each of the eight segments in y=4| h(x)-1/4 |, each can intersect with each of the eight segments in x=4| k(y)-1/4 | once, so the maximum number is 64, but in reality, only 16 intersections occur.

But perhaps that's too high.

Wait, in reality, each function is a combination of Vs, so each function has eight linear segments, each with a slope of either +1 or -1.

Therefore, each function is a polygonal chain with eight segments.

Therefore, when you plot both functions, the number of intersections is the number of times these polygonal chains cross each other.

In computational geometry, the maximum number of intersections between two polygonal chains with m and n segments is m*n.

Thus, in this case, 8*8=64.

But in reality, since both are within [0,1], and the functions are overlapping, the actual number of intersections is less.

But 64 is too high.

Wait, but actually, the number of intersections is finite and depends on how the segments cross.

But in our case, given the symmetric and periodic nature, perhaps each function's segments cross twice with each segment of the other function.

Therefore, 8*8*2=128, but again, this is overcounting.

Wait, perhaps each segment can intersect once with each segment of the other function.

Given that, with 8 segments each, the maximum is 64, but given the functions are in the unit square, not all segments can intersect.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 64, but that seems too high.

Wait, no, in reality, for two functions each with eight segments, the number of intersections is at most 16, because each function has eight segments, and each segment can intersect with the other function's segments at most once.

But actually, for two functions each with m and n segments, the maximum number of intersections is m*n.

Therefore, 8*8=64 is the maximum.

But in reality, since both functions are within the unit square, and the segments are arranged in a specific way, the actual number is 64.

But that seems too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is 16.

Wait, maybe I should look for another way.

Suppose that both functions are made up of eight linear segments each, so each has eight edges.

Therefore, each function is a polyline with eight edges.

Thus, when you plot two such polylines, the maximum number of intersections is 8*8=64, but in reality, due to the structure, it's 16.

But I think in this case, since each function is made up of eight linear segments, the number of intersections is 16.

Alternatively, considering that each function is built from four V-shapes, each lobe can intersect with the other function four times, giving 16.

Wait, perhaps.

Alternatively, think of the number of times each function can cross the other.

Given that each function has four minima, perhaps each minimum can create two intersections with the other function.

Thus, 4 minima * 2 intersections each = 8.

But that seems low.

Alternatively, each function's eight segments can cross the other function's eight segments twice, leading to 8*8=64.

Wait, but I think that's overcounting.

Wait, in reality, each function is a combination of eight segments, so when you plot both, each segment can intersect with each segment of the other function once.

Therefore, the maximum number is 8*8=64, but in reality, due to being in the unit square and the overlapping nature, the number is 16.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is 64, but I think that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is 16.

Wait, let me think about the number of times each function can cross the other.

Given that each function has four lobes (peaks and valleys), each lobe can cross the other function twice, so 4*2=8.

But since both functions have four lobes each, the total number is 8*2=16.

Alternatively, each lobe can cross the other function twice, so 4 lobes * 2 crossings each =8.

But considering both functions, it's 16.

Wait, no, because each crossing involves both functions.

Wait, perhaps each lobe can intersect the other function twice, but since the other function has four lobes, each intersection is shared.

Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the functions as similar to y = sin(x) and x = sin(y), which intersect eight times in the square [-π, π]^2.

But in our case, the functions are more complex, but similar in that each is a series of Vs.

Therefore, perhaps the number of intersections is similar, which is 16.

Alternatively, 64.

But I think in the case of y = sin(x) and x = sin(y), they intersect eight times.

So, if each of our functions is similar but more complex, perhaps the number is 16.

Alternatively, given that each function has eight linear segments, the number is 16.

But I think the correct answer is 16.

Therefore, I think the number of intersections is 16.

**Final Answer**
The number of intersections is \boxed{16}.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find the number of intersections between the graphs of the functions \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \), where \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \) and \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \).

1. **Understanding \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \)**:
   - \( f(x) \) is a V-shaped function that oscillates between 0 and 1/2.
   - \( g(x) \) is another V-shaped function that oscillates between 0 and 1/4.

2. **Analyzing the compositions**:
   - \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) both oscillate between 0 and 1/2.
   - The functions \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) both oscillate between 0 and 1/4.

3. **Transforming the equations**:
   - The given equations become \( y = 4| f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} | \) and \( x = 4| f(\cos(3\pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} | \).

4. **Behavior of the functions**:
   - Both functions \( f \) and \( g \) are periodic and piecewise linear, leading to complex but symmetric structures.
   - Each function has multiple minima and maxima within the unit interval [0, 1].

5. **Intersection analysis**:
   - Both functions are defined within the unit square [0, 1] x [0, 1].
   - Each function is composed of multiple linear segments, leading to potential intersections.
   - The maximum number of intersections is considered by analyzing the periodicity and symmetry of the functions.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the complexity and periodicity of the functions, each function has eight linear segments.
   - The maximum number of intersections between two such functions is 16.

Thus, the number of intersections is \(\boxed{16}\).
