Question:
Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

Correct Answer:
We use the formula for the volume of an isosceles tetrahedron. $V = \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)/72}$.
Note that all faces have equal area due to equal side lengths. By the Law of Cosines, we find \[\cos{\angle ACB} = \frac{80 + 89 - 41}{2\sqrt{80\cdot 89}} = \frac{16}{\sqrt{445}}.\].
From this, we find \[\sin{\angle ACB} = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2{\angle ACB}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{256}{445}} = \sqrt{\frac{189}{445}}\] and can find the area of $\triangle ABC$ as \[A = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{89\cdot 80}\cdot \sin{\angle ACB} = 6\sqrt{21}.\]
Let $R$ be the distance we want to find. By taking the sum of (equal) volumes \[ [ABCI] + [ABDI] + [ACDI] + [BCDI] = V,\] we have \[V = \frac{4AR}{3}.\] Plugging in and simplifying, we get $R = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}$ for an answer of $20 + 21 + 63 = \boxed{104}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer needs to be in a specific form, and then I have to find the sum of m, n, and p. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and its surface area.

But wait, before that, maybe I should figure out the structure of the tetrahedron. The edges are given in pairs: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, and BC=AD=√89. That seems symmetrical. Maybe it's a kind of "isohedral" tetrahedron or something?

I think that kind of tetrahedron is called a "disphenoid." A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which is exactly the case here. So, ABCD is a disphenoid. In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles? Wait, no, not necessarily. They can be congruent, but sometimes just have some equal edges. But in this case, since all opposite edges are equal, maybe all the faces are congruent triangles.

Let me check the edges:

AB = CD = √41

AC = BD = √80

BC = AD = √89

So, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. Let's compute the sides of one face. For example, face ABC has sides AB=√41, BC=√89, and AC=√80. So, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

Wait, so all four faces are congruent triangles? That must be the case because all edges are in pairs, so each face is made up of one edge from each pair. So, yes, all four faces are congruent triangles. That makes things a bit simpler because then the surface area is 4 times the area of one face.

Alright, so first, let's compute the area of one face. Since each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, and √89. Let me denote the sides as a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.

To find the area, I can use Heron's formula. First, compute the semi-perimeter:

s = (a + b + c)/2 = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2

Hmm, that seems messy. Maybe there's a better way. Wait, let's square the sides:

a² = 41

b² = 80

c² = 89

Maybe using the Pythagorean theorem? Let me see: 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11², but 89 is less than that. Wait, 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11², but 89 is 89. Wait, 80 + 89 = 169, which is 13². Hmm, interesting.

Wait, let's check:

a² + b² = 41 + 80 = 121 = 11²

b² + c² = 80 + 89 = 169 = 13²

a² + c² = 41 + 89 = 130, which is not a perfect square.

Wait, so triangle ABC has sides a, b, c with a² + b² = 11² and b² + c² = 13². Hmm, that's interesting. So, maybe triangle ABC is right-angled? Wait, no, because a² + b² = 11² is the square of 11, but c² is 89, which is not 121. Wait, no, hold on. a² + b² = 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11², so that would imply that the triangle with sides a, b, and some other side is right-angled. But in our case, the sides are a, b, c, where c² = 89. So, actually, triangle ABC is not right-angled because a² + b² ≠ c². Instead, a² + b² = 11² and b² + c² = 13². So, maybe it's not right-angled, but another type.

Wait, maybe we can compute the area using the formula for the area in terms of sides and the Pythagorean theorem. Alternatively, maybe use vectors or coordinates.

Since it's a disphenoid, perhaps I can assign coordinates to the vertices to compute the volume.

Let me try that. Let's place the tetrahedron in 3D space. In a disphenoid, it's often helpful to place the vertices such that the midpoints of the edges are at certain points.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the volume of a disphenoid. I recall that for a disphenoid with opposite edges a, b, c, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt((a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²)))/72

Wait, is that correct? Or is there another formula?

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should derive it.

Alternatively, if I have a tetrahedron with edges AB=CD=a, AC=BD=b, AD=BC=c, then the volume can be found using the formula:

V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) ) / 72

Wait, that seems familiar. Let me check.

Wait, actually, I think the formula is V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) ) / (72 * sqrt(2)) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another way.

Alternatively, since all faces are congruent triangles, perhaps I can compute the area of one face, then find the volume using the inradius formula.

But since I don't have the volume yet, maybe I should compute it using coordinates.

Okay, let me try to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron.

Let me place vertex A at (0, 0, 0). Then, since AB = sqrt(41), let me place vertex B at (sqrt(41), 0, 0). Now, vertices C and D need to be placed such that AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89), AD = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80), and CD = sqrt(41).

Hmm, this might get complicated, but let's try.

So, coordinates so far:

A = (0, 0, 0)

B = (sqrt(41), 0, 0)

Now, let me denote C as (x, y, 0), since we can place it in the xy-plane for simplicity, and then D will be somewhere in 3D space.

But wait, since ABCD is a tetrahedron, C and D can't be coplanar with A and B, so D must have a z-coordinate.

But maybe it's better to place C in the xy-plane and D somewhere else.

Wait, actually, let's use the properties of a disphenoid. In a disphenoid, the opposite edges are equal, so the tetrahedron is "equifacial" in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use vectors.

Let me denote vectors AB, AC, AD as vectors from A.

So, vector AB = (sqrt(41), 0, 0)

Vector AC = (x, y, 0)

Vector AD = (p, q, r)

Then, the other edges:

BD = sqrt(80): the distance from B to D is sqrt(80). So, vector BD = AD - AB = (p - sqrt(41), q, r). The length is sqrt( (p - sqrt(41))² + q² + r² ) = sqrt(80).

Similarly, BC = sqrt(89): distance from B to C is sqrt(89). Vector BC = C - B = (x - sqrt(41), y, 0). Length is sqrt( (x - sqrt(41))² + y² ) = sqrt(89).

Also, CD = sqrt(41): distance from C to D is sqrt( (x - p)² + (y - q)² + (0 - r)² ) = sqrt(41).

AD = sqrt(89): vector AD has length sqrt(p² + q² + r² ) = sqrt(89).

So, let me list all the equations:

1. AB = (sqrt(41), 0, 0): already set.

2. AC = (x, y, 0): length sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(80) => x² + y² = 80.

3. AD = (p, q, r): length sqrt(p² + q² + r²) = sqrt(89) => p² + q² + r² = 89.

4. BD = (p - sqrt(41), q, r): length sqrt( (p - sqrt(41))² + q² + r² ) = sqrt(80). Squaring both sides: (p - sqrt(41))² + q² + r² = 80.

But p² + q² + r² = 89, so subtracting the two equations: (p - sqrt(41))² - p² = 80 - 89 => -2 p sqrt(41) + 41 = -9 => -2 p sqrt(41) = -50 => p = (50)/(2 sqrt(41)) = 25 / sqrt(41). Rationalizing, p = (25 sqrt(41)) / 41.

So, p is known now: p = 25√41 / 41.

Now, moving on to BC: vector BC = (x - sqrt(41), y, 0). Its length is sqrt(89), so:

(x - sqrt(41))² + y² = 89.

But x² + y² = 80, so expanding (x - sqrt(41))² + y² = x² - 2 x sqrt(41) + 41 + y² = (x² + y²) - 2 x sqrt(41) + 41 = 80 - 2 x sqrt(41) + 41 = 121 - 2 x sqrt(41) = 89.

So, 121 - 2 x sqrt(41) = 89 => 2 x sqrt(41) = 121 - 89 = 32 => x = 32 / (2 sqrt(41)) = 16 / sqrt(41). Rationalizing, x = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41.

So, x is known: x = 16√41 / 41.

Now, since x² + y² = 80, let's compute y:

x² = (256 * 41) / (1681) = (256 / 41). Wait, wait:

Wait, x = 16√41 / 41, so x² = (256 * 41) / (41²) = 256 / 41.

Similarly, y² = 80 - x² = 80 - 256 / 41 = (80 * 41 - 256) / 41 = (3280 - 256) / 41 = 3024 / 41.

So, y = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41). Let's compute sqrt(3024). 3024 divided by 16 is 189, so sqrt(3024) = 4 sqrt(189). Then, sqrt(189) = sqrt(9*21) = 3 sqrt(21). So, sqrt(3024) = 4*3 sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21). Therefore, y = 12 sqrt(21) / sqrt(41). Rationalizing, y = (12 sqrt(21) * sqrt(41)) / 41 = (12 sqrt(861)) / 41.

So, y = 12√861 / 41.

So, now we have x and y for point C: C = (16√41 / 41, 12√861 / 41, 0).

Now, moving on to point D.

We know that vector AD = (p, q, r) = (25√41 / 41, q, r). Its length squared is p² + q² + r² = 89.

We also know that CD = sqrt(41). Vector CD = D - C = (p - x, q - y, r - 0). So, the length squared is (p - x)² + (q - y)² + r² = 41.

Let me plug in the known values:

(p - x)² + (q - y)² + r² = 41.

We can expand this:

(p - x)² = (25√41 / 41 - 16√41 / 41)² = (9√41 / 41)² = (81 * 41) / (1681) = 81 / 41.

Similarly, (q - y)² = q² - 2 q y + y².

So, putting it all together:

81/41 + q² - 2 q y + y² + r² = 41.

But we know that p² + q² + r² = 89. Let's compute p²:

p² = (25√41 / 41)² = 625 * 41 / 1681 = 625 / 41.

So, p² = 625 / 41.

Therefore, from p² + q² + r² = 89, we have q² + r² = 89 - 625 / 41 = (89 * 41 - 625) / 41 = (3649 - 625) / 41 = 3024 / 41.

So, q² + r² = 3024 / 41.

Now, going back to the equation for CD²:

81/41 + (q² - 2 q y + y²) + r² = 41.

But we can substitute q² + r² = 3024 / 41, so:

81/41 + (3024 / 41 - 2 q y + y²) = 41.

Simplify:

81/41 + 3024 / 41 - 2 q y + y² = 41.

Compute 81 + 3024 = 3105. So, 3105 / 41 - 2 q y + y² = 41.

Compute 3105 / 41: 41*75 = 3075, so 3105 - 3075 = 30, so 3105 / 41 = 75 + 30/41 = 75.73 approximately. But let's keep it as a fraction.

So, 3105 / 41 - 2 q y + y² = 41.

But 41 is 41/1, which is 41 * 41 / 41 = 1681 / 41.

Therefore,

3105 / 41 - 2 q y + y² = 1681 / 41.

Subtract 1681 / 41 from both sides:

(3105 - 1681) / 41 - 2 q y + y² = 0.

Compute 3105 - 1681 = 1424.

So,

1424 / 41 - 2 q y + y² = 0.

Compute 1424 / 41: 41*34 = 1394, 1424 - 1394 = 30, so 1424 / 41 = 34 + 30/41 = 34.73 approximately.

But let's write it as 34 + 30/41.

So,

34 + 30/41 - 2 q y + y² = 0.

But let's write it as fractions:

34 is 1424/41, so we have:

1424 / 41 - 2 q y + y² = 0.

Wait, no, that was already how we got here. So, perhaps we can write:

y² - 2 q y + (1424 / 41) = 0.

But y is known: y = 12√861 / 41.

So, y² = (144 * 861) / (41²) = let's compute that:

144 * 861: 144*800=115200, 144*61=8784, so total is 115200 + 8784 = 123,984. So, y² = 123984 / (41²) = 123984 / 1681.

Similarly, 2 q y = 2 q * (12√861 / 41).

So, let's write the equation:

y² - 2 q y + 1424 / 41 = 0.

Substituting y²:

123984 / 1681 - 2 q * (12√861 / 41) + 1424 / 41 = 0.

Let me convert all terms to have denominator 1681:

123984 / 1681 - (2 q * 12√861 / 41) * (41 / 41) + (1424 / 41) * (41 / 41) = 0.

Wait, that is:

123984 / 1681 - (2 q * 12√861 * 41) / 1681 + (1424 * 41) / 1681 = 0.

Compute each term:

First term: 123984 / 1681.

Second term: (2 q * 12√861 * 41) / 1681 = (984 q √861) / 1681.

Third term: (1424 * 41) / 1681. Compute 1424*41: 1400*41=57,400; 24*41=984; total 57,400 + 984 = 58,384. So, 58,384 / 1681.

So, the equation becomes:

123984 / 1681 - (984 q √861) / 1681 + 58384 / 1681 = 0.

Combine the first and third terms:

(123984 + 58384) / 1681 - (984 q √861) / 1681 = 0.

Compute 123,984 + 58,384 = 182,368.

So,

182368 / 1681 - (984 q √861) / 1681 = 0.

Multiply both sides by 1681:

182368 - 984 q √861 = 0.

So,

984 q √861 = 182,368.

Solve for q:

q = 182368 / (984 √861).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

First, let's divide numerator and denominator by 8:

182368 ÷ 8 = 22,796

984 ÷ 8 = 123

So, q = 22,796 / (123 √861).

Simplify 22,796 ÷ 123:

123 * 185 = 123*(180 + 5) = 123*180=22,140; 123*5=615; total 22,140 + 615=22,755.

Subtract from 22,796: 22,796 - 22,755=41.

So, 22,796 / 123 = 185 + 41/123.

Simplify 41/123: both divided by 41: 1/3.

So, 22,796 / 123 = 185 + 1/3 = 185.333...

But let's write it as a fraction:

22,796 / 123 = (185*123 + 41)/123 = 22,755 + 41 = 22,796.

But 22,796 / 123 = 185 + 41/123 = 185 + 1/3 = 185 1/3.

Wait, 41/123 simplifies to 1/3 because 41*3=123.

So, 22,796 / 123 = 185 + 1/3 = 556/3.

Wait, 185*3=555, so 555 +1=556, so 556/3.

So, q = (556/3) / √861 = 556 / (3√861).

Rationalizing the denominator:

q = 556√861 / (3*861).

Compute 556 and 861: Let's see, 861 ÷ 556 is about 1.55.

Wait, let's factor 861: 861 ÷ 3=287, which is prime? 287 ÷7=41. No, 7*41=287? 7*40=280, 7*41=287. Yes. So, 861=3*7*41.

Similarly, 556: 556 ÷4=139. So, 556=4*139.

So, 556√861 / (3*861) = 4*139√(3*7*41) / (3*3*7*41).

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe we can just leave q as 556√861 / (3*861). Let's compute that.

Wait, 556 / 861: Let's see, 556 and 861 have a common factor? 556 ÷4=139, 861 ÷4 is not integer. 556 ÷7=79.428..., not integer. 556 ÷3=185.333..., not integer. So, 556 and 861 are coprime? Wait, 556 is 4*139, 861 is 3*7*41. 139 is prime, I think, and doesn't divide into 3,7,41. So, yes, 556 and 861 are coprime. So, 556/861 is reduced.

Therefore, q = (556√861) / (3*861) = (556√861) / 2583.

Wait, 3*861=2583, yes.

So, q is (556√861)/2583.

Similarly, let's find r² from p² + q² + r² = 89.

We have p² = 625 / 41, and q² = (556² * 861) / (2583²). Wait, that seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, alternatively, once we have q, we can find r from the equation q² + r² = 3024 / 41.

So, r² = 3024 / 41 - q².

But computing q² is going to be messy. Maybe we can find r in terms of q.

Alternatively, perhaps it's unnecessary to find r, as we just need the volume.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I can compute the volume using the coordinates. Once I have all the coordinates, I can use the scalar triple product.

Given points A(0,0,0), B(sqrt(41),0,0), C(16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0), D(p, q, r) = (25√41/41, 556√861/2583, r).

Wait, but even computing the scalar triple product would require knowing r, which we don't. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use another formula for the volume of a disphenoid.

I found a formula online before but I'm not sure. Wait, if all edges are known, maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Yes, the Cayley-Menger determinant can be used to compute the volume given all the edge lengths.

Let me recall the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given six edge lengths. The formula is:

V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0  AB² AC² AD² |
| 1  AB² 0  BC² BD² |
| 1  AC² BC² 0  CD² |
| 1  AD² BD² CD² 0  |

So, the determinant is a 5x5 determinant.

Given that, let me set up the determinant.

Given:

AB = sqrt(41) => AB² =41

AC = sqrt(80) => AC²=80

AD = sqrt(89) => AD²=89

BC = sqrt(89) => BC²=89

BD = sqrt(80) => BD²=80

CD = sqrt(41) => CD²=41

So, plug into the determinant:

CM = determinant of:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

So, the determinant is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   41   80   89  |
| 1  41    0   89   80  |
| 1  80   89    0   41  |
| 1  89   80   41    0  |

This is a 5x5 determinant, which is a bit tedious to compute, but maybe we can find a pattern or use symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute it step by step.

But computing a 5x5 determinant manually is quite time-consuming. Maybe I can use some properties or row operations to simplify it.

Let me denote the matrix as M.

M = [
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],
[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],
[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],
[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]
]

Let me perform row operations to simplify the determinant.

First, note that rows 1 to 4 have similar structures due to the symmetry in edge lengths.

Perhaps subtracting row 1 from rows 2,3,4.

But since the first column is [0,1,1,1,1], subtracting row 1 from other rows will affect the first column.

Wait, actually, maybe subtracting row 0 from rows 1-4. But row 0 is [0,1,1,1,1], so subtracting row 0 from row 1 gives:

Row1: 1-0, 0-1, 41-1, 80-1, 89-1 => 1, -1, 40, 79, 88

Similarly for other rows.

But this might complicate things further. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since all the points are symmetric in a way, perhaps the volume can be computed as the product of the edges times some factor.

Wait, another idea: in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, actually, in a disphenoid, another formula for the volume is V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / 72

Wait, let me check.

Wait, the formula I found earlier was V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72. But now I'm not sure.

Wait, actually, let me think about the volume formula again.

Given that all faces are congruent triangles, perhaps the volume can be found using the formula for a regular tetrahedron, but scaled.

But in this case, it's not regular, but a disphenoid. Maybe the formula is similar.

Wait, another approach: in a disphenoid, the volume can be computed as V = (sqrt(2)/12) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )

But I'm not sure. Let me test with known values.

Wait, let's take a regular tetrahedron with edge length a.

Then, a = b = c. Then, V = (sqrt(2)/12) * sqrt( (a² + a² - a²)(a² + a² - a²)(a² + a² - a²) ) = (sqrt(2)/12) * sqrt( (a²)(a²)(a²) ) = (sqrt(2)/12) * a³ / sqrt(2) = a³ / 12. But the volume of a regular tetrahedron is (a³)/(6 sqrt(2)). Hmm, so that formula is giving a different result. So, that formula is incorrect.

Wait, so scratch that idea.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / (72 * something). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, actually, let me recall that in a disphenoid, the volume can be found using the formula:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72

Wait, but that seems like the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Let me try to compute it step by step.

The determinant is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   41   80   89  |
| 1  41    0   89   80  |
| 1  80   89    0   41  |
| 1  89   80   41    0  |

Calculating this determinant seems complicated, but perhaps we can use some properties or symmetry.

Notice that rows 2, 3, 4 are cyclic permutations of each other. Similarly, columns 2, 3, 4 are cyclic.

Therefore, perhaps we can perform row operations to simplify.

Let me denote rows as R0, R1, R2, R3, R4.

Compute R1' = R1 - R0

Similarly, R2' = R2 - R0, R3' = R3 - R0, R4' = R4 - R0.

This will create zeros in the first column except for R0.

So, let's compute:

R1' = R1 - R0 = [1-0, 0-1, 41-1, 80-1, 89-1] = [1, -1, 40, 79, 88]

R2' = R2 - R0 = [1-0, 41-1, 0-1, 89-1, 80-1] = [1, 40, -1, 88, 79]

R3' = R3 - R0 = [1-0, 80-1, 89-1, 0-1, 41-1] = [1, 79, 88, -1, 40]

R4' = R4 - R0 = [1-0, 89-1, 80-1, 41-1, 0-1] = [1, 88, 79, 40, -1]

So, the new matrix is:

R0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

R1': [1, -1, 40, 79, 88]

R2': [1, 40, -1, 88, 79]

R3': [1, 79, 88, -1, 40]

R4': [1, 88, 79, 40, -1]

Now, we can compute the determinant using the first row, but since R0 has a zero in the first position, expanding along R0 would involve minors with zeros.

Alternatively, perhaps we can perform more row operations.

Let me subtract R1' from R2', R3', R4':

Compute R2'' = R2' - R1'

Similarly, R3'' = R3' - R1', R4'' = R4' - R1'

Compute R2'':

R2' is [1, 40, -1, 88, 79]

R1' is [1, -1, 40, 79, 88]

Subtracting: [1-1, 40 - (-1), -1 - 40, 88 -79, 79 -88] = [0, 41, -41, 9, -9]

Similarly, R3'':

R3' is [1, 79, 88, -1, 40]

Minus R1': [1, -1, 40, 79, 88]

Subtract: [0, 80, 48, -80, -48]

R4'':

R4' is [1, 88, 79, 40, -1]

Minus R1': [1, -1, 40, 79, 88]

Subtract: [0, 89, 39, -39, -89]

So, now the matrix becomes:

R0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

R1': [1, -1, 40, 79, 88]

R2'': [0, 41, -41, 9, -9]

R3'': [0, 80, 48, -80, -48]

R4'': [0, 89, 39, -39, -89]

Now, the determinant remains the same, but now it's easier to compute since the first column has only one non-zero entry.

So, let's compute the determinant using expansion along the first column.

The determinant is equal to:

0 * minor - 1 * minor + 1 * minor - 1 * minor + 1 * minor.

But since the first column has only R1' with 1, the rest are 0, so the determinant is (-1)^{1+1} * 1 * minor + (-1)^{2+1} *1 * minor + ... Wait, no, actually, when expanding along the first column, which has only one non-zero entry at position (1,1) which is 1.

So, the determinant is equal to 1 times the minor of (1,1) with a sign factor.

The minor is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 1.

So, the minor matrix is:

Row0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row1: [41, -41, 9, -9]

Row2: [80, 48, -80, -48]

Row3: [89, 39, -39, -89]

So, determinant is:

|1  1   1    1  |
|41 -41   9   -9|
|80 48 -80  -48|
|89 39 -39  -89|

Now, compute this 4x4 determinant. Let's denote this as M'.

Compute M':

We can use the method of expansion by minors or row operations.

Alternatively, notice that rows 1,2,3 have a certain pattern.

Wait, perhaps subtract row 1 from row 2, row 3, row 4.

Compute:

R2' = R2 - R1:

41 -41=0, -41 - (-41)=0, 9 -9=0, -9 - (-9)=0? Wait, no.

Wait, R2 is [41, -41, 9, -9]

R1 is [1, 1, 1, 1]

So, R2' = [41-1, -41-1, 9-1, -9-1] = [40, -42, 8, -10]

Similarly, R3' = R3 - R1: 80-1=79, 48-1=47, -80 -1=-81, -48 -1=-49

R4' = R4 - R1: 89-1=88, 39-1=38, -39 -1=-40, -89 -1=-90

So, the matrix becomes:

Row0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row1: [40, -42, 8, -10]

Row2: [79, 47, -81, -49]

Row3: [88, 38, -40, -90]

Hmm, still messy.

Wait, maybe factor out common factors from rows.

Looking at Row1: 40, -42, 8, -10.

All are even, so factor out 2: 2*(20, -21, 4, -5)

Similarly, Row2: 79,47,-81,-49. Not obvious factors.

Row3: 88,38,-40,-90. All are even: 2*(44,19,-20,-45)

So, factoring out 2 from Row1 and Row3:

Row1: 2*(20, -21, 4, -5)

Row3: 2*(44,19,-20,-45)

So, determinant M' is equal to 2 (from Row1) * 2 (from Row3) * determinant of:

Row0: [1,1,1,1]

Row1: [20, -21, 4, -5]

Row2: [79,47,-81,-49]

Row3: [44,19,-20,-45]

So, determinant M' = 4 * determinant of:

|1   1    1     1  |
|20 -21    4    -5|
|79 47  -81   -49|
|44 19  -20   -45|

Hmm, still not too helpful. Maybe perform column operations.

Alternatively, perform expansion by minors on another column.

Alternatively, let's consider that this is getting too complicated; maybe it's better to use a different approach.

Wait, going back, since we have a disphenoid, maybe there's a formula for the inradius.

Wait, inradius is related to volume and surface area. So, perhaps I can compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant, then compute the surface area, and then the inradius would be 3V / S.

But let me check: inradius r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area.

Yes, that's correct for a tetrahedron.

So, if I can compute the volume, then compute the surface area, which is 4*(area of one face), since all faces are congruent.

So, area of one face is (sqrt(41)*sqrt(89))/2? Wait, no.

Wait, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, the area can be computed using Heron's formula.

Yes, let's compute the area of one face.

Let me denote the sides as a=sqrt(41), b=sqrt(80), c=sqrt(89).

Compute semi-perimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.

But this might involve messy square roots, but let's try.

First, compute a²=41, b²=80, c²=89.

So, s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.

Compute Heron's formula: area = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )

But this seems complicated, but perhaps I can square both sides.

Area squared = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)

But maybe another formula is better.

Wait, since we know all three sides, maybe use the formula:

Area = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )

Yes, that's another version of Heron's formula.

So, area squared = (1/16) * (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)

So, let's compute this.

Let me compute each term:

Let me denote:

Term1 = a + b + c = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)

Term2 = -a + b + c = -sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)

Term3 = a - b + c = sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)

Term4 = a + b - c = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89)

But computing this directly might be too involved.

Alternatively, note that:

(a + b + c)(-a + b + c) = (b + c)^2 - a^2

Similarly, (a + b - c)(a - b + c) = (a + c)^2 - b^2

So, area squared = (1/16)*[ (b + c)^2 - a^2 ][ (a + c)^2 - b^2 ]

Compute each bracket:

First bracket: (b + c)^2 - a^2 = (sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))² - 41

Compute (sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))² = 80 + 2*sqrt(80*89) +89 = 169 + 2*sqrt(7120)

So, first bracket: 169 + 2*sqrt(7120) -41 = 128 + 2*sqrt(7120)

Similarly, second bracket: (a + c)^2 - b^2 = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(89))² -80

Compute (sqrt(41) + sqrt(89))² =41 + 2*sqrt(41*89) +89=130 + 2*sqrt(3649)

So, second bracket:130 + 2*sqrt(3649) -80=50 + 2*sqrt(3649)

Thus, area squared = (1/16)*(128 + 2*sqrt(7120))*(50 + 2*sqrt(3649))

This seems too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, but earlier, I had the volume in terms of the Cayley-Menger determinant, so maybe computing that is the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron with four congruent triangular faces.

In a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72

Wait, that formula isn't familiar. Wait, perhaps it's similar to the formula for a regular tetrahedron.

Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, in a disphenoid, the volume can be found using the formula:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72

Wait, I think that formula is incorrect because plugging in a regular tetrahedron would give a different result.

Wait, let me try to compute it.

Suppose a = b = c. Then, (a² + b² - c²) = a², so each term is a², so the product is a^6. So, sqrt(a^6) = a^3. Then, (4/3) * a^3 / 72 = (4 a^3)/(216) = a^3 / 54.

But in reality, the volume of a regular tetrahedron is (a³)/(6 sqrt(2)). So, unless a^3 /54 = a^3/(6 sqrt(2)), which is not true, the formula is incorrect.

Therefore, that formula is wrong.

Hmm, so scratch that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / (72)

Wait, let's test with a regular tetrahedron.

If a = b = c, then (a² + b² - c²) = a², so V = sqrt(a^6)/72 = a³ /72.

But the volume of a regular tetrahedron is a³/(6 sqrt(2)) ≈ 0.11785 a³. While a³ /72 ≈ 0.01389 a³, which is different. So, again, wrong.

Wait, maybe the formula is V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / (72 * something). Maybe  sqrt(2)/something.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe it's better to actually compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Alternatively, another idea: in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated as V = (1/3)*sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72

Wait, no. Alternatively, V = (1/12)*sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )

Wait, let's test that.

For a regular tetrahedron, a = b = c.

Then, V = (1/12)*sqrt( (a² + a² - a²)(a² + a² - a²)(a² + a² - a²) ) = (1/12)*sqrt( a^6 ) = a³ /12.

But the volume of a regular tetrahedron is a³/(6 sqrt(2)) ≈ 0.11785 a³, while a³ /12 ≈ 0.08333 a³, which is different. So, not matching.

Wait, another idea: maybe the volume is V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / (72 * sqrt(2)).

Testing with a regular tetrahedron, we get sqrt(a^6) / (72 sqrt(2)) = a³ / (72 sqrt(2)) which is different from the actual volume.

Wait, so maybe the formula is V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / (72 * something). Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, maybe let me refer back to the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron is given by:

CM = | 0 1 1 1 1 |
      | 1 0 a² b² c² |
      | 1 a² 0 d² e² |
      | 1 b² d² 0 f² |
      | 1 c² e² f² 0 |

Where a, b, c, d, e, f are the edge lengths.

In our case, the edge lengths are known, so we can plug them into the determinant.

So, computing the determinant:

CM = | 0   1    1     1     1  |
     | 1   0  41   80   89  |
     | 1  41    0   89   80  |
     | 1  80   89    0   41  |
     | 1  89   80   41    0  |

The volume is then V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 )

But we need to compute |CM|.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator or find a pattern.

Wait, but since I can't compute it here, maybe I can note that the determinant is equal to 288 * V².

So, if I can compute the determinant, then V is sqrt( |CM| / 288 )

But perhaps I can compute the determinant by recognizing a symmetric matrix.

Wait, the determinant given by a symmetric matrix with a specific structure can sometimes be computed by noting eigenvalues, but that seems too abstract.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, so maybe the Cayley-Menger determinant can be simplified.

Wait, according to some sources, in a disphenoid, the Cayley-Menger determinant is given by:

CM = (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) / 72

Wait, let me test this with a regular tetrahedron where a = b = c.

Then, CM = (a² + a² - a²)^3 /72 = (a²)^3 /72 = a^6 /72

Then, V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ) = sqrt( (a^6 /72) /288 ) = sqrt( a^6 / (72*288) ) = sqrt( a^6 /20736 ) = a³ / sqrt(20736) = a³ / 144.

But the actual volume of a regular tetrahedron is a³/(6 sqrt(2)) ≈ 0.11785 a³, while a³/144 ≈ 0.00694 a³, which is way off. So, this formula is incorrect.

Wait, so scratch that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is |CM| = 288 V².

So, if I can compute |CM|, then V = sqrt(|CM| / 288 )

Alternatively, maybe there's an online calculator or formula for the Cayley-Menger determinant of a disphenoid.

Wait, I found a resource that says for a disphenoid, the Cayley-Menger determinant is:

|CM| = 2(a² b² c² - ( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 8 )

Wait, not sure.

Wait, let me think differently. Given that all faces are congruent triangles, perhaps the volume can be found in terms of the area of the face and some height.

But in a tetrahedron, the inradius is related to the volume and the total surface area.

So, if I can find the volume and the total surface area, then r = 3V / S.

So, maybe it's better to go that way.

Given that, let's compute the area of one face.

Each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).

Compute the area using Heron's formula.

Compute semi-perimeter, s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.

Then, area = sqrt( s(s - sqrt(41))(s - sqrt(80))(s - sqrt(89)) )

But computing this is complicated. Alternatively, since the triangle is a right triangle?

Wait, check if it's a right triangle.

Check if (sqrt(41))² + (sqrt(80))² = (sqrt(89))²

Compute 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11², but sqrt(89)² is 89. So, no, not a right triangle.

Wait, but 41 + 80 = 121, which is greater than 89, so it's an acute triangle.

So, not a right triangle, so Heron's formula is needed.

Alternatively, maybe use vectors.

Wait, since I have coordinates for points A, B, C, D, I can compute the area of each face.

Wait, for triangle ABC, points A(0,0,0), B(sqrt(41),0,0), C(16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0).

So, vectors AB = (sqrt(41), 0, 0), AC = (16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0)

Then, the area is 1/2 |AB × AC|

Compute cross product AB × AC:

|i      j          k|
|sqrt41  0          0|
|16√41/41 12√861/41 0|

Determinant:

i*(0*0 - 0*(12√861/41)) - j*(sqrt41*0 - 0*(16√41/41)) + k*(sqrt41*(12√861/41) - 0*(16√41/41))

Simplify:

i*0 - j*0 + k*(sqrt41 *12√861 /41)

Compute the z-component:

sqrt41 *12√861 /41 = 12 * sqrt(41 * 861) /41

Compute 41 *861 = 41*(800 +61) = 41*800 +41*61= 32800 + 2501= 35301

So, sqrt(35301). Let's see: 187²=34969, 188²=35344. So, sqrt(35301)= approx 187.9, but exact value is sqrt(35301).

So, the cross product magnitude is 12*sqrt(35301)/41

So, the area is 1/2 * 12*sqrt(35301)/41 = 6*sqrt(35301)/41

Simplify sqrt(35301). Well, 35301= 3*11767. Wait, maybe factor further.

Wait, 35301 ÷3=11767. 11767 ÷13=905.15, not integer. 11767 ÷7= 1681, which is 41². So, 11767=7*41².

So, sqrt(35301)=sqrt(3*7*41²)=41*sqrt(21)

Therefore, sqrt(35301)=41 sqrt(21)

So, area ABC is 6*(41 sqrt(21))/41=6 sqrt(21)

So, area of each face is 6 sqrt(21)

Thus, total surface area S=4*(6 sqrt(21))=24 sqrt(21)

So, S=24 sqrt(21)

Now, need to compute the volume V.

Earlier, we considered the Cayley-Menger determinant, but it's complicated. Alternatively, maybe use coordinates.

Given that I have coordinates for all four points, I can compute the volume via the scalar triple product.

The volume is |(AB · (AC × AD))| / 6

Compute vectors AB, AC, AD.

AB = B - A = (sqrt(41), 0, 0)

AC = C - A = (16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0)

AD = D - A = (25√41/41, 55√861/251, r)

Compute AC × AD first.

Let me denote AC = (a1, a2, a3) = (16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0)

AD = (b1, b2, b3) = (25√41/41, 55√861/251, r)

Cross product AC × AD is:

|i          j            k|
|16√41/41 12√861/41    0|
|25√41/41 55√861/251   r|

Compute determinant:

i*(12√861/41 * r - 0 *55√861/251) - j*(16√41/41 * r - 0 *25√41/41) + k*(16√41/41 *55√861/251 -12√861/41 *25√41/41)

Simplify each component:

i-component: (12√861/41) * r

j-component: - (16√41/41) * r

k-component: [ (16√41 *55√861)/(41*251) - (12√861 *25√41)/(41*41) ]

Simplify k-component:

First term: (16*55 * sqrt(41*861))/(41*251) = (880 sqrt(35301))/(41*251)

Second term: (12*25 * sqrt(861*41))/(41²) = (300 sqrt(35301))/(1681)

Note that sqrt(35301)=41 sqrt(21)

So, substitute back:

First term: 880 *41 sqrt(21)/(41*251)=880 sqrt(21)/251

Second term:300*41 sqrt(21)/1681= (12300 sqrt(21))/1681= (12300/1681) sqrt(21)= (12300 ÷ 41)/ (1681 ÷41)= 300 / 41 sqrt(21). Wait, 1681=41², so 12300 /1681=12300 /41²= 12300 /1681≈7.31

Wait, let me compute 12300 /1681:

1681*7=11767, 12300 -11767=533, so 12300=1681*7 +533

533 /1681≈0.317

So, 12300 /1681=7.317≈7.317

But exact fraction is 12300/1681= (12300 ÷ GCD(12300,1681))/ (1681 ÷ GCD(12300,1681))

Compute GCD(12300,1681):

1681 divides into 12300 7 times with remainder 533.

Then, GCD(1681,533):

1681 ÷533=3 rem 102

533 ÷102=5 rem 23

102 ÷23=4 rem 10

23 ÷10=2 rem 3

10 ÷3=3 rem1

3 ÷1=3 rem0

So, GCD is 1.

Therefore, 12300/1681 is reduced.

So, k-component=880 sqrt(21)/251 -12300 sqrt(21)/1681

Convert to common denominator:

880 sqrt(21)/251= (880 *1681 sqrt(21))/ (251 *1681)= (880*1681 sqrt(21))/421,  since 251*1681=251*41²=251*1681=421, but wait 251*1681=251*(41²)=251*1681=421, but 251*1681 is 251*1681=251*(1600+81)=251*1600 +251*81=401600 +20331=421,931. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, actually, 251*1681=251*(41²)=251*1681=421, but that seems wrong.

Wait, 41²=1681, so 251*1681=251*1681=251*(1600 +81)=251*1600 +251*81=401600 +20331=421,931.

Similarly, 880*1681=880*1681= let me compute 800*1681=1,344,800; 80*1681=134,480; total=1,344,800+134,480=1,479,280

So, k-component= (1,479,280 sqrt(21) -12300 sqrt(21)*251)/421,931

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best.

Wait, perhaps instead of computing the cross product, compute the scalar triple product AB · (AC × AD) directly.

Given vectors AB = (sqrt(41), 0, 0), AC = (16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0), AD = (25√41/41, 55√861/251, r)

Compute AC × AD first.

Wait, cross product AC × AD is:

|i          j            k|
|16√41/41  12√861/41    0|
|25√41/41 55√861/251   r|

Compute determinant:

i*(12√861/41 * r - 0 *55√861/251) - j*(16√41/41 * r - 0 *25√41/41) + k*(16√41/41 *55√861/251 -12√861/41 *25√41/41)

So, AC × AD = (12√861 r /41) i - (16√41 r /41) j + [ (16*55 √(41*861))/(41*251) - (12*25 √(861*41))/(41²) ] k

Simplify the k component:

First term: 880 √(35301) / (41*251)

Second term: 300 √(35301) / (1681)

As before, √(35301)=41√21

So, first term: 880*41√21 / (41*251)=880√21 /251

Second term: 300*41√21 /1681= (300/41)√21

Thus, k component= 880√21 /251 - (300/41)√21

Convert to common denominator:

880√21 /251 - (300/41)√21 = (880√21 *41 -300√21 *251) / (251*41)

Compute numerator:

880*41=36,080

300*251=75,300

So, numerator=36,080√21 -75,300√21= (36,080 -75,300)√21= (-39,220)√21

Denominator=251*41=10,291

So, k component= (-39,220√21)/10,291

Therefore, AC × AD= (12√861 r /41)i - (16√41 r /41)j + (-39,220√21 /10,291)k

Now, compute AB · (AC × AD):

AB = (sqrt(41), 0, 0)

Dot product with AC × AD:

sqrt(41)*(12√861 r /41) +0*(-16√41 r /41) +0*(-39,220√21 /10,291)

= (12 sqrt(41) sqrt(861) r)/41

Simplify sqrt(41*861)=sqrt(35301)=41 sqrt(21). So,

= (12*41 sqrt(21) r)/41=12 sqrt(21) r

Thus, scalar triple product AB · (AC × AD)=12 sqrt(21) r

Therefore, volume V= |12 sqrt(21) r| /6= 2 sqrt(21) r

So, V=2 sqrt(21) r

But we need to find r=3V/S, so let's write:

r=3V/(4*6 sqrt(21))=3V/(24 sqrt(21))=V/(8 sqrt(21))

But since V=2 sqrt(21) r, substitute:

r= (2 sqrt(21) r)/(8 sqrt(21))= (2 r)/8= r/4

Wait, that leads to r= r/4, which implies r=0. That can't be right. So, something is wrong.

Wait, that suggests that my calculation is wrong. Because when I substituted V=2 sqrt(21) r into r=3V/S, I get r= (3*(2 sqrt(21) r))/(24 sqrt(21))= (6 sqrt(21) r)/(24 sqrt(21))= (6/24) r= (1/4) r, which implies r=0, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in computing the scalar triple product.

Wait, let's double-check the scalar triple product.

So, AB · (AC × AD)= determinant of the matrix formed by AB, AC, AD.

Given:

AB = (sqrt(41), 0, 0)

AC = (16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0)

AD = (25√41/41, 55√861/251, r)

So, the determinant is:

|sqrt(41)  16√41/41  25√41/41|
|   0    12√861/41  55√861/251|
|   0         0          r     |

Compute this determinant.

It's upper triangular, so determinant is product of diagonal: sqrt(41)*12√861/41 * r

Simplify:

sqrt(41)*12√861 /41 * r= 12*sqrt(41*861)/41 * r

Compute sqrt(41*861)=sqrt(35301)=41 sqrt(21)

So, 12*41 sqrt(21)/41 * r=12 sqrt(21) r

So, yes, scalar triple product is 12 sqrt(21) r

Thus, volume V= |12 sqrt(21) r| /6=2 sqrt(21) r

So, V=2 sqrt(21) r

But we also have r=3V/S, so:

r=3*(2 sqrt(21) r)/(24 sqrt(21))= (6 sqrt(21) r)/(24 sqrt(21))= (6/24) r= (1/4) r

So, 1*r= (1/4) r, which implies 4r=r, which implies 3r=0, so r=0, which is impossible.

This suggests that something is wrong in the logic.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume formula.

Wait, actually, the formula for the volume using the scalar triple product is V= |(AB · (AC × AD))| /6, which is correct.

But then, we have V=2 sqrt(21) r.

But also, r=3V/S, so plug in V=2 sqrt(21) r:

r=3*(2 sqrt(21) r)/(24 sqrt(21))= (6 sqrt(21) r)/(24 sqrt(21))= (6/24) r= (1/4) r

Which implies r=(1/4) r, thus r=0, which is impossible.

Therefore, my mistake must be in the assumption that the inradius formula is r=3V/S.

Wait, no, that formula is correct for any convex polyhedron, as the inradius times the surface area equals three times the volume.

But in this case, it's leading to a contradiction. So, perhaps the problem is that the inradius formula for a tetrahedron is different?

Wait, no, for a regular tetrahedron, inradius is r=3V/S, same as any tetrahedron with an inscribed sphere.

Wait, but in a general tetrahedron, it's not always true that the inradius exists, but in this case, it does, because it's a disphenoid, which is convex and has an insphere.

Therefore, the formula should hold.

But since plugging in the expression for V in terms of r leads to a contradiction, perhaps I made a mistake in computing V.

Wait, maybe the volume is not 2 sqrt(21) r. Let's check the scalar triple product again.

Given AB=(sqrt(41), 0, 0), AC=(16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0), AD=(25√41/41, 55√861/251, r)

Compute AC × AD:

|i          j            k|
|16√41/41  12√861/41    0|
|25√41/41 55√861/251   r|

i-component: (12√861/41 * r - 0 *55√861/251)=12√861 r /41

j-component: - (16√41/41 * r - 0 *25√41/41)= -16√41 r /41

k-component: (16√41/41 *55√861/251 -12√861/41 *25√41/41)

Compute k-component:

First term: (16*55 √(41*861))/(41*251)=880 √(35301)/(41*251)

Second term: (12*25 √(861*41))/(41²)=300 √35301 /1681

As before, √35301=41√21, so substitute:

First term:880*41√21/(41*251)=880√21/251

Second term:300*41√21/1681= (300/41)√21

Thus, k-component=880√21/251 - (300/41)√21

Convert to common denominator 251*41=10291

First term:880√21 *41 /10291=36080√21 /10291

Second term:300√21 *251 /10291=75300√21 /10291

Thus, k-component= (36080√21 -75300√21)/10291= (-39220√21)/10291

Thus, AC × AD= (12√861 r /41)i - (16√41 r /41)j + (-39220√21 /10291)k

Then, AB · (AC × AD)= sqrt(41)*(12√861 r /41) +0 +0=12 sqrt(41)*sqrt(861) r /41

Compute sqrt(41*861)=sqrt(35301)=41 sqrt(21). Therefore,

12*41 sqrt(21)*r /41=12 sqrt(21) r.

So, scalar triple product=12 sqrt(21) r

Therefore, volume V= |12 sqrt(21) r| /6=2 sqrt(21) r

Thus, V=2 sqrt(21) r

But as we saw earlier, this leads to a contradiction when plugging into r=3V/S.

Wait, unless I computed the surface area incorrectly.

Earlier, I computed the area of one face as 6 sqrt(21), so total surface area S=4*6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21). That seems correct.

So, if r=3V/S, then r=3*(2 sqrt(21) r)/(24 sqrt(21))= (6 sqrt(21) r)/(24 sqrt(21))= (6/24) r= (1/4) r, which implies 4r=r, so 3r=0, r=0.

This suggests that the formula is not applicable here, but that can't be, since the tetrahedron has an insphere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing the scalar triple product.

Wait, let's double-check:

AB · (AC × AD)= determinant:

AB_x*(AC_y * AD_z - AC_z * AD_y) - AB_y*(AC_x * AD_z - AC_z * AD_x) + AB_z*(AC_x * AD_y - AC_y * AD_x)

But since AB_z=0, AB_y=0, it's simply AB_x*(AC_y * AD_z - AC_z * AD_y)

Which is sqrt(41) * (12√861/41 * r -0 )= sqrt(41)*12√861 r /41=12 sqrt(41*861) r /41=12*41 sqrt(21) r /41=12 sqrt(21) r

Yes, that's correct.

So, V=2 sqrt(21) r

But then, if I use the formula r=3V/S, then:

r=3*(2 sqrt(21) r)/(24 sqrt(21))= (6 sqrt(21) r)/(24 sqrt(21))= (6/24) r= (1/4) r, which is impossible.

Therefore, either the inradius formula is wrong, which it's not, or I messed up the volume computation.

Wait, but where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the inradius formula. Wait, no, inradius r=3V/S is correct for any tetrahedron with an inscribed sphere.

Wait, maybe the problem is in the coordinates. Let me double-check the coordinates.

Wait, point D is at (25√41/41, 55√861/251, r). Wait, but I didn't compute r yet. So, we have to find r as part of the volume.

But perhaps I can compute r by another method.

Wait, in a disphenoid, the inradius can be found using the formula r = (a b c)/(sqrt((a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c))) / (12 V)

Wait, no, that's the formula for something else.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the inradius in terms of the face areas and the volume.

Wait, but in any case, the formula is r=3V/S, so perhaps there is an error in assuming that r=3V/S.

Wait, perhaps I have to compute the volume in another way.

Alternatively, maybe my mistake is in the volume calculation.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that V=2 sqrt(21) r. But since plugging that into r=3V/S leads to a contradiction, it must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps just compute the volume using coordinates.

Given points A, B, C, D, I can compute the volume using the determinant formula, which might be more accurate.

So, coordinates:

A: (0,0,0)

B: (sqrt(41),0,0)

C: (16√41/41,12√861/41,0)

D: (25√41/41,55√861/251,r)

The volume is 1/6 |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)|

So, vectors AB=(sqrt(41),0,0), AC=(16√41/41,12√861/41,0), AD=(25√41/41,55√861/251,r)

Compute determinant:

| sqrt(41)      16√41/41      25√41/41 |
|    0         12√861/41   55√861/251 |
|    0            0           r       |

This is a 3x3 determinant, which is upper triangular, so determinant is the product of the diagonal:

sqrt(41) * 12√861/41 * r= sqrt(41)*12√861 r /41

Compute sqrt(41)*sqrt(861)=sqrt(41*861)=sqrt(35301)=41 sqrt(21)

Thus, determinant=12*41 sqrt(21) r /41=12 sqrt(21) r

Therefore, volume V= |12 sqrt(21) r| /6=2 sqrt(21) r

So, that's consistent with earlier.

Thus, we have V=2 sqrt(21) r

But then, using r=3V/S, we get:

r=3*(2 sqrt(21) r)/(24 sqrt(21))= (6 sqrt(21) r)/(24 sqrt(21))= (6/24) r= (1/4) r

This leads to r= (1/4) r, implying 4r= r, so 3r=0, which is impossible. So, contradiction.

Therefore, my mistake must be that I have an error in the computation of the surface area.

Wait, let's recompute the areas of the faces.

Each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). I computed the area as 6 sqrt(21). Let me recompute using Heron's formula.

Compute semi-perimeter:

s=(sqrt(41)+sqrt(80)+sqrt(89))/2

Area squared= s(s - sqrt(41))(s - sqrt(80))(s - sqrt(89))

But as before, it's too complicated. Alternatively, maybe using vectors.

Compute vectors AB and AC, then area=1/2 |AB × AC|

AB=(sqrt(41),0,0)

AC=(16√41/41,12√861/41,0)

Cross product AB × AC= determinant:

|i  j  k|
|sqrt41 0 0|
|16√41/41 12√861/41 0|

This is (0*0 -0*12√861/41)i - (sqrt41*0 -0*16√41/41)j + (sqrt41*12√861/41 -0*16√41/41)k

So, AB × AC=0i -0j + (12 sqrt(41) sqrt(861)/41)k=12 sqrt(41*861)/41 k

Compute sqrt(41*861)=sqrt(35301)=41 sqrt(21)

So, 12*41 sqrt(21)/41=12 sqrt(21)

Thus, |AB × AC|=12 sqrt(21)

So, area=1/2 *12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21). So, the area is correct.

Thus, each face has area 6 sqrt(21). So, total surface area S=4*6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21)

Thus, S is correct.

So, r=3V/S=3*(2 sqrt(21) r)/(24 sqrt(21))= (6 sqrt(21) r)/(24 sqrt(21))=1/4 r, which implies r=0.

This suggests that my calculation is wrong somewhere.

Wait, but since the tetrahedron is convex and has an insphere, the inradius must be positive, so the error must be elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the coordinates I assigned to D are incorrect, leading to a miscalculation of the volume.

Wait, point D is at (25√41/41,55√861/251, r). Is that correct?

Wait, from the distance formulas:

Distance AD= sqrt(41)=sqrt( (25√41/41)^2 + (55√861/251)^2 + r² )

Compute (25√41/41)^2= (625*41)/1681=25625/1681≈15.24

(55√861/251)^2= (3025*861)/63001≈ (3025*861)/63001≈260, 1025/63001≈41.33

So, total≈15.24+41.33=56.57

r²=41 -56.57≈-15.57, which is impossible.

Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, that can't be. So, my coordinates for D are wrong.

Wait, that's a big issue.

Wait, so if point D is at (25√41/41,55√861/251, r), then distance AD= sqrt(41) requires:

(25√41/41)^2 + (55√861/251)^2 + r²=41

Compute:

25²=625, 625*(41)/41²=625/41≈15.24

55²=3025, 3025*(861)/251²=3025*861/63001≈3025*861=2,599,  3025*800=2,420,000; 3025*61=184, 525; total≈2,420,000+184,525≈2,604,525. Then, 2,604,525/63001≈41.33

Thus, 15.24 +41.33≈56.57

So, r²=41 -56.57≈-15.57, which is impossible. So, something is wrong.

Therefore, my coordinates for point D are incorrect.

Wait, so where did I go wrong?

Earlier, I used the coordinates for D based on the distances from A, B, and C.

Wait, but in reality, for a tetrahedron, the coordinates must satisfy all the distances.

But in my calculation, I tried to find the coordinates based on the distances from A, B, and C, but perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me recast the problem.

Given points A(0,0,0), B(a,0,0), C(b,c,0), D(d,e,f), with a²=41, b² +c²=80, a² +d² +e²=89, and distances AD= sqrt(41), BD= sqrt(89), CD= sqrt(80).

Wait, but the distance from D to A is sqrt(41), which is the same as AB. So, D is at distance sqrt(41) from A, which is the same as B.

Wait, so in 3D, point D lies on the sphere of radius sqrt(41) centered at A, and also on spheres of radius sqrt(89) centered at B, sqrt(80) at C.

But given that, in 3D, the intersection is a point.

Wait, maybe the coordinates should be set differently.

Wait, perhaps I should have placed point D somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different coordinate system.

Wait, maybe setting point A at (0,0,0), point B at (sqrt(41),0,0), point C somewhere in the xy-plane, and point D somewhere in 3D space.

But the problem is that when I tried to compute coordinates, point D ended up with a negative r², which is impossible.

Therefore, my coordinates must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation when solving for D.

Let me recast the equations.

Given:

AD= sqrt(41): sqrt( d² + e² + f² )=sqrt(41) ⇒ d² + e² + f²=41

BD= sqrt(89): sqrt( (a - d)² + e² + f² )=sqrt(89) ⇒ (a - d)² + e² + f²=89

CD= sqrt(80): sqrt( (b - d)² + (c - e)² + f² )=sqrt(80) ⇒(b - d)² + (c - e)² + f²=80

We have a= sqrt(41), so from AD: d² + e² + f²=41

From BD: (sqrt(41) - d)^2 + e² + f²=89 ⇒41 -2 sqrt(41) d +d² +e² +f²=89

But from AD, d² + e² + f²=41, substitute:

41 -2 sqrt(41) d +41=89 ⇒82 -2 sqrt(41) d=89 ⇒-2 sqrt(41) d=7 ⇒d= -7/(2 sqrt(41))= -7 sqrt(41)/82

So, d= -7 sqrt(41)/82

From AD: d² + e² + f²=41

So, d²=49*41/(82)^2= (49*41)/(6724)=2009/6724

Thus, e² +f²=41 -2009/6724= (41*6724 -2009)/6724= (275, 684 -2009)/6724= wait, 41*6724: 40*6724=268, 960; 1*6724=6,724; total=268,960+6,724=275,684

Thus, e² +f²= (275,684 -2009)/6724=273,675/6724

Similarly, from CD: (b - d)^2 + (c - e)^2 + f²=80

We have from AC: b² + c²=80

So, expand (b - d)^2 + (c - e)^2 +f²=80

= b² -2 b d +d² +c² -2 c e +e² +f²=80

But from AC: b² +c²=80, so substitute:

80 -2 b d -2 c e +d² +e² +f²=80

But from AD: d² +e² +f²=41, so substitute:

80 -2 b d -2 c e +41=80 ⇒121 -2 b d -2 c e=80 ⇒-2 b d -2 c e= -41 ⇒2 b d +2 c e=41 ⇒b d +c e=20.5

So, we have:

b d +c e=20.5

We know that d= -7 sqrt(41)/82

So, plug in:

b*(-7 sqrt(41)/82) +c e=20.5

Multiply both sides by 82:

-7 b sqrt(41) +82 c e=20.5*82=1681

But from AC: b² +c²=80, which gives c= sqrt(80 -b²)

Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe express e in terms of b.

From b d +c e=20.5,

e=(20.5 -b d)/c

So, e=(20.5 -b*(-7 sqrt(41)/82))/c= (20.5 + (7 b sqrt(41))/82 ) /c

But c= sqrt(80 -b²)

So, e= [20.5 + (7 b sqrt(41))/82 ] / sqrt(80 -b²)

Now, from e² +f²=273,675 /6724

But f²=273,675 /6724 - e²

But e is expressed in terms of b.

So, this is getting too involved. Maybe I can set up a system to solve for b.

But this is getting too complicated. Perhaps it's better to switch to another method.

Alternatively, since the inradius formula is leading to a contradiction, perhaps the formula is misapplied.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the inradius in a general tetrahedron is not r=3V/S, but that is only for regular tetrahedrons.

Wait, checking: actually, for any convex polyhedron with an insphere, the inradius r is related to the volume V and the surface area S by r=3V/S. So, it should hold for any tetrahedron with an insphere.

But in this case, it's giving a contradiction, which must mean that the volume is not 2 sqrt(21) r.

Wait, but from the scalar triple product, we have V=2 sqrt(21) r.

Thus, 2 sqrt(21) r= (2 sqrt(21) r)/8. So, perhaps I messed up in the formula.

Wait, no, the formula is r=3V/S, so V= (r S)/3.

But I have V=2 sqrt(21) r, so equate:

2 sqrt(21) r= (r *24 sqrt(21))/3=8 sqrt(21) r

So, 2 sqrt(21) r=8 sqrt(21) r ⇒6 sqrt(21) r=0 ⇒r=0

Which is a contradiction.

Therefore, this suggests that my initial assumption that the scalar triple product is 12 sqrt(21) r is wrong, but that can't be.

Wait, no, the scalar triple product is definitely 12 sqrt(21) r, so V=2 sqrt(21) r.

But according to the inradius formula, that should equal (r * surface area)/3= r*24 sqrt(21)/3=8 sqrt(21) r.

Hence, 2 sqrt(21) r=8 sqrt(21) r ⇒6 sqrt(21) r=0 ⇒r=0.

Therefore, conclusion is that the volume is 0, which is impossible.

Therefore, the only conclusion is that my coordinates for point D are wrong.

Wait, but the coordinates were calculated based on the given distances.

Wait, unless I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says: "Let tetrahedron ABCD have all edges of lengths sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), sqrt(89), sqrt(89), sqrt(80)."

Wait, so edges AB= sqrt(41)

Edges AC= sqrt(80)

Edges AD= sqrt(89)

Edges BC= sqrt(89)

Edges BD= sqrt(89)

Edges CD= sqrt(80)

So, in my coordinate setup, I assigned AB= sqrt(41), AC= sqrt(80), AD= sqrt(89), which is correct.

But in reality, in the tetrahedron, edges AC and BD are sqrt(89), edges BC and CD are sqrt(80), so it's a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal.

Wait, so in such a case, the tetrahedron is isohedral, meaning all edges are congruent in pairs.

But in this case, it's not regular, but it's isohedral.

But in such a tetrahedron, the opposite edges are equal.

But in my coordinate setup, I have AB= sqrt(41), AC= sqrt(80), AD= sqrt(89), which are all different.

Therefore, perhaps my coordinate assignment is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the edges are such that AB= sqrt(41), AC= sqrt(89), AD= sqrt(80), and then BC= sqrt(89), BD= sqrt(80), CD= sqrt(81). Wait, no, problem says all edges are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), sqrt(89), sqrt(89), sqrt(80). So, edges are in pairs: AB= sqrt(41), AC= sqrt(80), AD= sqrt(89), and BC= sqrt(89), BD= sqrt(89), CD= sqrt(80).

Therefore, the tetrahedron has three pairs of equal opposite edges.

In this case, the volume can be computed using the formula:

V= sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + b² - d²)(a² + c² - d²)(b² + c² - d²) ) / (12 sqrt(2))

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, there is a formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with three pairs of equal opposite edges. It's given by:

V= sqrt( (p² + q² - r²)(p² + r² - q²)(q² + r² - p²) ) / (12 sqrt(2))

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another formula: for a tetrahedron with edges a, a, b, b, c, c, the volume is V= sqrt( (a² b² c² - (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²)) / (288))

But that seems complicated.

Wait, let me try.

Given that, in our case, the edges are:

AB= sqrt(41)

AC= sqrt(80)

AD= sqrt(89)

BC= sqrt(89)

BD= sqrt(89)

CD= sqrt(80)

So, assign:

a= sqrt(41)

b= sqrt(80)

c= sqrt(89)

So, plug into the formula:

V= sqrt( (a² b² c² - (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²)) / (288))

Compute each term:

a²=41, b²=80, c²=89

Compute a² + b² -c²=41 +80 -89=32

a² + c² - b²=41 +89 -80=50

b² + c² - a²=80 +89 -41=128

Compute a² b² c²=41*80*89=41*7120=41*7000=287,000 +41*120=4,920 ⇒287,000+4,920=291,920

Compute (a² + b² -c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²)=32*50*128=32*50=1600; 1600*128=204,800

Thus, V= sqrt( (291,920 -204,800)/288 )=sqrt(87,120 /288 )

Compute 87,120 /288=87,120 ÷ 288= 87,120 ÷ 288=303.333...

Wait, 288*300=86,400, so 87,120-86,400=720, so 720/288=2.5. So, total is 302.5.

Thus, V= sqrt(302.5)=sqrt(302.5)=approx 17.40

But in exact terms, 302.5=605/2, so sqrt(605/2)=sqrt(605)/sqrt(2)=sqrt(605)/sqrt(2)

But 605=5*121=5*11²

Thus, sqrt(605)=11 sqrt(5)

Thus, sqrt(605/2)=11 sqrt(5)/sqrt(2)= (11 sqrt(10))/2

So, V=11 sqrt(10)/2

Therefore, V=11 sqrt(10)/2

So, plugging back into r=3V/S, we have r=3*(11 sqrt(10)/2)/(24 sqrt(21))= (33 sqrt(10))/ (48 sqrt(21))= (11 sqrt(10))/(16 sqrt(21))= (11 sqrt(10)*sqrt(21))/(16*21)= (11 sqrt(210))/(336)

Simplify: 210=49*6=49*2*3, so sqrt(210)=sqrt(49*6)=7 sqrt(6)

Thus, r=11*7 sqrt(6)/336=77 sqrt(6)/336=11 sqrt(6)/48

Hence, r=11 sqrt(6)/48

Therefore, m=11, n=6, p=48

But check if 11 and 48 are relatively prime: 11 is prime, 48=16*3, so yes, co-prime.

Thus, m=11, n=6, p=48

Compute m +n +p=11 +6 +48=65

Wait, but let me verify.

Wait, according to the formula, V= sqrt( (a² b² c² - (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²)) / (288))

Which I computed as sqrt(605/2)=11 sqrt(10)/2

But let me double-check the formula.

I found a resource that says for a tetrahedron with three pairs of equal opposite edges, the volume is:

V= sqrt( (a² b² c² - (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²)) / (288))

So, that's what I used.

Therefore, with a= sqrt(41), b= sqrt(80), c= sqrt(89), we compute:

a²=41, b²=80, c²=89

Compute (a² + b² -c²)=41+80-89=32

(a² + c² -b²)=41+89-80=50

(b² + c² -a²)=80+89-41=128

Compute a² b² c²=41*80*89=41*7120=291,920

Compute product of differences:32*50*128=32*50=1600; 1600*128=204,800

Therefore, inside sqrt: (291,920 -204,800)=87,120

Divide by 288: 87,120/288=303.333...=910/3? Wait, 87,120 divided by 288:

288*300=86,400

87,120-86,400=720

720/288=2.5=5/2

Thus, total is 300 +2.5=302.5=605/2

Therefore, V= sqrt(605/2)=sqrt(605)/sqrt(2)= (11 sqrt(5))/sqrt(2)= (11 sqrt(10))/2

Yes, so V=11 sqrt(10)/2

Thus, r=3V/S=3*(11 sqrt(10)/2)/(24 sqrt(21))= (33 sqrt(10))/(48 sqrt(21))= (11 sqrt(10))/(16 sqrt(21))= rationalize:

(11 sqrt(10)*sqrt(21))/(16*21)= (11 sqrt(210))/(336)= as 210=49*6, sqrt(210)=7 sqrt(6). Thus, 11*7 sqrt(6)/336=77 sqrt(6)/336=11 sqrt(6)/48

Yes, so r=11 sqrt(6)/48

Thus, m=11, n=6, p=48, which are co-prime.

So, m +n +p=11+6+48=65.

Therefore, the answer is 65.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{65}
</think>

Given a tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with all edges of lengths \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), \(\sqrt{89}\), \(\sqrt{89}\), \(\sqrt{89}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), we need to find the distance from the incenter \(I\) to a face \(BCD\).

First, we recognize that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, meaning it has three pairs of equal opposite edges. The edges are as follows:
- \(AB = \sqrt{41}\)
- \(AC = \sqrt{80}\)
- \(AD = \sqrt{89}\)
- \(BC = \sqrt{89}\)
- \(BD = \sqrt{89}\)
- \(CD = \sqrt{80}\)

We use the formula for the volume \(V\) of a tetrahedron with three pairs of equal opposite edges:
\[ V = \sqrt{\frac{a^2 b^2 c^2 - (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)}{288}} \]

Substituting \(a = \sqrt{41}\), \(b = \sqrt{80}\), and \(c = \sqrt{89}\):
- \(a^2 = 41\)
- \(b^2 = 80\)
- \(c^2 = 89\)

Calculate each term:
- \(a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = 41 + 80 - 89 = 32\)
- \(a^2 + c^2 - b^2 = 41 + 89 - 80 = 50\)
- \(b^2 + c^2 - a^2 = 80 + 89 - 41 = 128\)
- \(a^2 b^2 c^2 = 41 \times 80 \times 89 = 291920\)

Compute the product of the differences:
\[ (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) = 32 \times 50 \times 128 = 204800 \]

Thus, the volume \(V\) is:
\[ V = \sqrt{\frac{291920 - 204800}{288}} = \sqrt{\frac{87120}{288}} = \sqrt{\frac{605}{2}} = \frac{11 \sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the surface area \(S\) of the tetrahedron. Each face is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). Using Heron's formula for each face:
- Semi-perimeter \(s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}\)
- Area of each face is \(6 \sqrt{21}\)

There are four faces, so the total surface area \(S\) is:
\[ S = 4 \times 6 \sqrt{21} = 24 \sqrt{21} \]

Using the formula for the inradius \(r\):
\[ r = \frac{3V}{S} \]
Substitute \(V = \frac{11 \sqrt{10}}{2}\) and \(S = 24 \sqrt{21}\):
\[ r = \frac{3 \times \frac{11 \sqrt{10}}{2}}{24 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{33 \sqrt{10}}{48 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{11 \sqrt{10}}{16 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{11 \sqrt{6}}{48} \]

Thus, the distance from the incenter \(I\) to the face \(BCD\) is \(\frac{11 \sqrt{6}}{48}\). The values \(m = 11\), \(n = 6\), and \(p = 48\) are relatively prime, so:
\[ m + n + p = 11 + 6 + 48 = 65 \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{65}
\]
