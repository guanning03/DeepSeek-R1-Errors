Question:
Let $O(0,0), A(\tfrac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. There is a unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$, distinct from $A$ and $B$, that does not belong to any segment from $\mathcal{F}$ other than $\overline{AB}$. Then $OC^2 = \tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p + q$.

Correct Answer:
Begin by finding the equation of the line $\overline{AB}$: $y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Now, consider the general equation of all lines that belong to $\mathcal{F}$. Let $P$ be located at $(a, 0)$ and $Q$ be located at $(0, b)$. With these assumptions, we may arrive at the equation $ay + bx = ab$. However, a critical condition that must be satisfied by our parameters is that $a^2 + b^2 = 1$, since the length of $\overline{PQ} = 1$. We wish to find a point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$ such that $\overline{PQ}$ passes through $C$ if and only if $a = \frac{1}{2}$. Since the property $a^2 + b^2 = 1$ implies that if $a = \frac{1}{2}$, then $\overline{PQ} = \overline{AB}$, we now proceed by finding the intersection of two lines: 

a(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + x\sqrt{1-a^2} = a\sqrt{1-a^2}.
After algebraic manipulations, we arrive at the equation: 
-a^4 + 2xa^3 + (-4x^2 + 3x + \frac{1}{4})a^2 - 2xa + x^2 = 0.
Note that $a = \frac{1}{2}$ is a solution to this polynomial. Perform polynomial division to eliminate the extraneous solution $a = \frac{1}{2}$. This yields: 
-a^3 + (2x - \frac{1}{2})a^2 + (-4x^2 + 4x)a - 2x^2 = 0.
We then plug in $a = \frac{1}{2}$ to find the corresponding values of $x$. This results in the quadratic equation: 
16x^2 - 10x + 1 = 0.
This is easily factored to give $x = \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{2}$. Since $x = \frac{1}{2}$ corresponds to a point already covered by the horizontal line segment, we discard it. Thus, $x = \frac{1}{8}$ is the only valid solution.
Now, we substitute $x = \frac{1}{8}$ into the equation of line $\overline{AB}$: $y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, which gives $y = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$.
The distance from the origin is then given by $\sqrt{\frac{1}{8^2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{7}{16}}$. Squaring this distance gives $\frac{7}{16}$, so the answer is $\boxed{23}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me first parse the question to make sure I understand all the parts.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a triangle OAB. The question is about a family of segments F, which are all segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each segment has one endpoint P on the x-axis and the other endpoint Q on the y-axis. So, for any such segment PQ, the length PQ is 1, and it connects a point P on the x-axis to a point Q on the y-axis.

Now, there's a unique point C on the segment AB, different from A and B, such that C doesn't lie on any other segment from F except for AB itself. The goal is to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin O to the point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers, then find p + q.

Okay, so let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the family of segments F looks like. Each segment PQ has unit length, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, such a segment can be parameterized by the x-coordinate of P, say t, where t is between 0 and 1. Then, since PQ has length 1, the coordinates of Q can be determined in terms of t.

Specifically, if P is (t, 0), then Q must be (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)) because the distance between (t, 0) and (0, s) must be 1. So, sqrt(t^2 + s^2) = 1, which gives s = sqrt(1 - t^2). So, each segment in F is determined by a parameter t, and the points P(t, 0) and Q(0, sqrt(1 - t^2)).

Therefore, the family F consists of all such segments where t ranges from 0 to 1. So, for each t in [0,1], we have a segment connecting (t, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)).

Now, the segment AB is between A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, AB is also a member of this family F, since when t = 1/2, we get P(1/2, 0) and Q(0, sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2)) = Q(0, sqrt(3)/2), which is exactly point B.

So, AB is one of these segments in F. The problem states that there is a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, I need to find such a point C.

To rephrase, C is a point on AB such that for any other segment PQ in F (where PQ is not equal to AB), C does not lie on PQ. So, C is only on AB and no other member of F.

So, my task is to find the coordinates of this point C and then compute OC^2.

Let me try to visualize this. The family F consists of all segments connecting (t, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)) for t in [0,1]. Each such segment is a line of length 1 in the first quadrant, connecting the x-axis to the y-axis. The segment AB is one such segment, connecting (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2).

Now, point C is on AB, and it doesn't lie on any other segment from F. So, if I can parametrize AB and find the point C where it doesn't intersect any other segment from F except AB, that should be the point.

Let me parametrize segment AB first. Since A is at (1/2, 0) and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), the parametric equations for AB can be given by:

x = (1/2)(1 - s)
y = (sqrt(3)/2)s

where s ranges from 0 to 1. When s = 0, we are at A, and when s = 1, we are at B.

So, any point C on AB can be written as ((1/2)(1 - s), (sqrt(3)/2)s) for some s in (0,1).

Now, I need to find the point C on AB such that for any other t in [0,1] (t ≠ 1/2), the point C is not on the segment PQ(t) connecting (t, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)).

So, for each t ≠ 1/2, the line PQ(t) should not pass through C.

Wait, but actually, in the plane, two lines either intersect or are parallel. Since all these segments PQ(t) are not parallel (they all connect the x-axis to the y-axis), so each PQ(t) will intersect other lines PQ(t') unless they are the same.

But in our case, each PQ(t) is a different segment, but they might intersect each other at some point. So, if point C is on AB, it might lie on other segments PQ(t) as well.

So, the point C is unique in the sense that it is on AB and not on any other PQ(t). So, we need to find such a point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ(t) except AB.

Therefore, we need to find a point C on AB such that for all t ≠ 1/2, the point C is not on PQ(t). So, C is not on any other PQ(t) except AB.

So, how can we find such a point C?

Perhaps, we can consider the envelope of the family F. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, if the envelope is tangent to each segment PQ(t), then the point of tangency is the only point where C might lie on PQ(t). So, if we can find the envelope of F, then the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

Therefore, maybe the unique point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.

Alternatively, maybe we can think of this in terms of the point C lying on AB such that it is the only point on AB not lying on any other PQ(t). So, if I can find a condition where C is not on PQ(t) for any t ≠ 1/2, then that should give us the required point.

Let me try to parametrize point C as ((1/2)(1 - s), (sqrt(3)/2)s). Then, for this point, I need to ensure that it is not on any PQ(t) for t ≠ 1/2.

Let me write the equation of the segment PQ(t). Since PQ(t) connects (t, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)), the equation of the line PQ(t) can be found.

The slope of PQ(t) is (sqrt(1 - t^2) - 0)/(0 - t) = -sqrt(1 - t^2)/t.

Therefore, the equation of PQ(t) is y = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)x + sqrt(1 - t^2).

So, any point (x, y) lying on PQ(t) must satisfy y = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)x + sqrt(1 - t^2).

Now, if point C is on PQ(t), then plugging the coordinates of C into this equation should hold.

So, let me write:

(sqrt(3)/2)s = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t) * (1/2)(1 - s) + sqrt(1 - t^2).

Let me write this equation:

(sqrt(3)/2)s = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t) * (1/2)(1 - s) + sqrt(1 - t^2).

Let me simplify this equation.

First, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:

sqrt(3) * s = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)(1 - s) + 2 sqrt(1 - t^2).

Let me write this as:

sqrt(3) s = sqrt(1 - t^2) [ (- (1 - s)/t ) + 2 ].

Let me compute the expression in the brackets:

(- (1 - s)/t ) + 2 = (- (1 - s) + 2t)/t.

So, we have:

sqrt(3) s = sqrt(1 - t^2) * [ (-1 + s + 2t)/t ].

So, sqrt(3) s = sqrt(1 - t^2) * (s + 2t - 1)/t.

Now, let me denote this as:

sqrt(3) s = [ (s + 2t - 1) / t ] * sqrt(1 - t^2).

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

3 s^2 = [ (s + 2t - 1)^2 / t^2 ] * (1 - t^2).

Multiplying both sides by t^2:

3 s^2 t^2 = (s + 2t - 1)^2 (1 - t^2).

Now, expand both sides.

First, the left-hand side (LHS):

LHS = 3 s^2 t^2.

The right-hand side (RHS):

RHS = (s + 2t - 1)^2 (1 - t^2).

First, let me expand (s + 2t - 1)^2:

= (s - 1 + 2t)^2
= (s - 1)^2 + 4t(s - 1) + 4t^2
= s^2 - 2s + 1 + 4ts - 4t + 4t^2.

So, RHS = [s^2 - 2s + 1 + 4ts - 4t + 4t^2] * (1 - t^2).

Let me expand this:

= (s^2 - 2s + 1 + 4ts - 4t + 4t^2) * (1 - t^2)
= (s^2 - 2s + 1 + 4ts - 4t + 4t^2) - (s^2 - 2s + 1 + 4ts - 4t + 4t^2) * t^2.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, expand the first term:

= s^2 - 2s + 1 + 4ts - 4t + 4t^2.

Now, the second term:

- (s^2 - 2s + 1 + 4ts - 4t + 4t^2) * t^2
= -s^2 t^2 + 2s t^2 - t^2 - 4t^3 s + 4t^3 - 4t^4.

So, combining both parts:

RHS = [s^2 - 2s + 1 + 4ts - 4t + 4t^2] + [ -s^2 t^2 + 2s t^2 - t^2 - 4t^3 s + 4t^3 - 4t^4 ].

Now, let me combine like terms:

Terms with s^2:
s^2 - s^2 t^2.

Terms with s:
-2s + 4ts + 2s t^2.

Terms with t:
-4t.

Terms with t^2:
4t^2 - t^2.

Terms with t^3:
-4t^3 s + 4t^3.

Terms with t^4:
-4t^4.

Let me write them all out:

= s^2(1 - t^2) + s(-2 + 4t + 2t^2) + (-4t) + t^2(4 - 1) + t^3(-4s + 4) + t^4(-4).

Simplify each:

= s^2(1 - t^2) + s(-2 + 4t + 2t^2) + (-4t) + 3t^2 + t^3(-4s + 4) - 4t^4.

Now, let's bring everything back to the equation:

3 s^2 t^2 = RHS = above expression.

So, the equation is:

3 s^2 t^2 = s^2(1 - t^2) + s(-2 + 4t + 2t^2) - 4t + 3t^2 + t^3(-4s + 4) - 4t^4.

Let me bring all terms to the left-hand side:

3 s^2 t^2 - s^2(1 - t^2) - s(-2 + 4t + 2t^2) + 4t - 3t^2 - t^3(-4s + 4) + 4t^4 = 0.

Now, let's expand and collect like terms.

First, expand 3 s^2 t^2 - s^2(1 - t^2):

= 3 s^2 t^2 - s^2 + s^2 t^2
= (3 t^2 + t^2) s^2 - s^2
= (4 t^2 - 1) s^2.

Next, expand -s(-2 + 4t + 2t^2):

= 2s - 4s t - 2s t^2.

Then, expand - t^3(-4s + 4):

= 4s t^3 - 4 t^3.

The other terms are +4t - 3t^2 + 4t^4.

Putting it all together:

(4 t^2 - 1) s^2 + (2s - 4s t - 2s t^2) + (4s t^3 - 4 t^3) + 4t - 3t^2 + 4t^4 = 0.

Now, let's collect like terms:

Terms with s^2:
(4 t^2 - 1) s^2.

Terms with s:
2s - 4s t - 2s t^2 + 4s t^3.

Terms with constants (without s):
4t - 3t^2 - 4t^3 + 4t^4.

So, the equation becomes:

(4 t^2 - 1) s^2 + s (2 - 4t - 2t^2 + 4t^3) + (4t - 3t^2 - 4t^3 + 4t^4) = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in s. Let me write it as:

A(s, t) s^2 + B(s, t) s + C(t) = 0,

where

A(s, t) = 4 t^2 - 1,

B(s, t) = 2 - 4t - 2t^2 + 4t^3,

C(t) = 4t - 3t^2 - 4t^3 + 4t^4.

Now, for a fixed t, this equation will have solutions for s. However, we want that for a specific t, the point C lies on PQ(t). But since we want C to lie only on AB and not on any other PQ(t), except when t = 1/2, we need that the quadratic equation has only one solution s (which is s = 1/2) or no solution for other t.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Actually, for each t ≠ 1/2, we want that there is no s such that C is on PQ(t). So, for each t ≠ 1/2, the equation should have no solution s. But since we have a quadratic in s, which can have 0, 1, or 2 solutions. So, for each t ≠ 1/2, we want that the equation has no solutions for s, meaning that the quadratic should have no real roots.

Therefore, for each t ≠ 1/2, the discriminant of the quadratic in s should be negative.

Let me compute the discriminant D of the quadratic equation:

D = B^2 - 4AC.

We need D < 0 for all t ≠ 1/2.

So, let me compute D:

D = [2 - 4t - 2t^2 + 4t^3]^2 - 4*(4t^2 - 1)*(4t - 3t^2 - 4t^3 + 4t^4).

This seems complicated, but let's try to compute it step by step.

First, compute B^2:

B = 2 - 4t - 2t^2 + 4t^3.

So, B^2 = (2 - 4t - 2t^2 + 4t^3)^2.

Let me compute this:

Let me denote u = 2 - 4t - 2t^2 + 4t^3.

Then, u^2 = (2)^2 + (-4t)^2 + (-2t^2)^2 + (4t^3)^2 + 2*(2*(-4t) + 2*(-2t^2) + 2*(4t^3) + (-4t)*(-2t^2) + (-4t)*(4t^3) + (-2t^2)*(4t^3)).

Wait, that might be too messy. Alternatively, let me multiply it out term by term:

(2 - 4t - 2t^2 + 4t^3)(2 - 4t - 2t^2 + 4t^3).

Multiply each term in the first polynomial with each term in the second.

First, 2*(2) = 4.

2*(-4t) = -8t.

2*(-2t^2) = -4t^2.

2*(4t^3) = 8t^3.

Next, -4t*(2) = -8t.

-4t*(-4t) = 16t^2.

-4t*(-2t^2) = 8t^3.

-4t*(4t^3) = -16t^4.

Next, -2t^2*(2) = -4t^2.

-2t^2*(-4t) = 8t^3.

-2t^2*(-2t^2) = 4t^4.

-2t^2*(4t^3) = -8t^5.

Next, 4t^3*(2) = 8t^3.

4t^3*(-4t) = -16t^4.

4t^3*(-2t^2) = -8t^5.

4t^3*(4t^3) = 16t^6.

Now, let's collect like terms:

Constant term: 4.

t terms: -8t -8t = -16t.

t^2 terms: -4t^2 + 16t^2 -4t^2 = 8t^2.

t^3 terms: 8t^3 + 8t^3 + 8t^3 = 24t^3.

t^4 terms: -16t^4 + 4t^4 -16t^4 = (-16 -16 + 4)t^4 = (-28t^4).

t^5 terms: -8t^5 -8t^5 = -16t^5.

t^6 term: 16t^6.

So, u^2 = B^2 = 4 - 16t + 8t^2 + 24t^3 - 28t^4 -16t^5 +16t^6.

Now, compute 4AC:

4AC = 4*(4t^2 - 1)*(4t - 3t^2 - 4t^3 + 4t^4).

First, compute (4t^2 -1)(4t -3t^2 -4t^3 +4t^4).

Let me denote v = 4t^2 -1,

w = 4t -3t^2 -4t^3 +4t^4.

Compute v*w:

(4t^2 -1)*(4t -3t^2 -4t^3 +4t^4).

Multiply each term in v with each term in w:

4t^2*(4t) = 16t^3.

4t^2*(-3t^2) = -12t^4.

4t^2*(-4t^3) = -16t^5.

4t^2*(4t^4) = 16t^6.

-1*(4t) = -4t.

-1*(-3t^2) = 3t^2.

-1*(-4t^3) = 4t^3.

-1*(4t^4) = -4t^4.

Now, collect like terms:

t terms: -4t.

t^2 terms: 3t^2.

t^3 terms: 16t^3 +4t^3 = 20t^3.

t^4 terms: -12t^4 -4t^4 = -16t^4.

t^5 terms: -16t^5.

t^6 terms: 16t^6.

So, v*w = -4t + 3t^2 + 20t^3 -16t^4 -16t^5 +16t^6.

Therefore, 4AC = 4*(-4t + 3t^2 + 20t^3 -16t^4 -16t^5 +16t^6)

= -16t + 12t^2 + 80t^3 -64t^4 -64t^5 +64t^6.

Now, the discriminant D = B^2 - 4AC = [4 - 16t + 8t^2 + 24t^3 - 28t^4 -16t^5 +16t^6] - [ -16t + 12t^2 + 80t^3 -64t^4 -64t^5 +64t^6 ].

Let me compute this term by term:

4 -16t +8t^2 +24t^3 -28t^4 -16t^5 +16t^6

minus

(-16t +12t^2 +80t^3 -64t^4 -64t^5 +64t^6)

= 4 -16t +8t^2 +24t^3 -28t^4 -16t^5 +16t^6 +16t -12t^2 -80t^3 +64t^4 +64t^5 -64t^6.

Now, combine like terms:

Constant term: 4.

t terms: -16t +16t = 0.

t^2 terms: 8t^2 -12t^2 = -4t^2.

t^3 terms: 24t^3 -80t^3 = -56t^3.

t^4 terms: -28t^4 +64t^4 = 36t^4.

t^5 terms: -16t^5 +64t^5 = 48t^5.

t^6 terms:16t^6 -64t^6 = -48t^6.

So, D = 4 -4t^2 -56t^3 +36t^4 +48t^5 -48t^6.

We can factor this expression.

Let me write it as:

D = -48t^6 +48t^5 +36t^4 -56t^3 -4t^2 +4.

Hmm, this is a sixth-degree polynomial. It's quite complicated, but maybe we can factor it.

Let me factor out a common factor if possible. Let's see:

Coefficients: -48, 48, 36, -56, -4, 4.

They are all multiples of 4, except the first term is -48, which is also a multiple of 4. So, let's factor out a -4:

D = -4(12t^6 -12t^5 -9t^4 +14t^3 + t^2 -1).

Wait, let me check:

-4*(-12t^6 +12t^5 +9t^4 -14t^3 -t^2 +1) = 48t^6 -48t^5 -36t^4 +56t^3 +4t^2 -4.

Wait, that's not matching. Wait, I think I messed up the signs when factoring out.

Wait, let me do it step by step.

Given D = -48t^6 +48t^5 +36t^4 -56t^3 -4t^2 +4.

Factor out a common factor of -4:

= -4*(12t^6 -12t^5 -9t^4 +14t^3 + t^2 -1).

Wait, let me compute:

-4*(12t^6) = -48t^6,

-4*(-12t^5) = +48t^5,

-4*(-9t^4) = +36t^4,

-4*(14t^3) = -56t^3,

-4*(t^2) = -4t^2,

-4*(-1) = +4.

Yes, that's correct. So, D = -4*(12t^6 -12t^5 -9t^4 +14t^3 +t^2 -1).

Now, let me try to factor the polynomial inside the parentheses: P(t) = 12t^6 -12t^5 -9t^4 +14t^3 +t^2 -1.

This is a sixth-degree polynomial. Let me attempt to factor it.

Perhaps using rational root theorem. The possible rational roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/3, ±1/4, ±1/6, ±1/12.

Let me test t = 1: P(1) = 12 -12 -9 +14 +1 -1 = (12-12) + (-9+14) + (1-1) = 0 +5 +0=5≠0.

t = -1: 12*(-1)^6 -12*(-1)^5 -9*(-1)^4 +14*(-1)^3 + (-1)^2 -1

=12*1 -12*(-1) -9*1 +14*(-1) +1 -1

=12 +12 -9 -14 +1 -1

= (12+12) + (-9-14) + (1-1) =24 -23 +0=1≠0.

t = 1/2: Let's compute P(1/2):

12*(1/2)^6 -12*(1/2)^5 -9*(1/2)^4 +14*(1/2)^3 + (1/2)^2 -1.

Compute each term:

12*(1/64) = 12/64 = 3/16,

-12*(1/32) = -12/32 = -3/8,

-9*(1/16) = -9/16,

14*(1/8) = 14/8 = 7/4,

(1/4),

-1.

Sum them up:

3/16 - 3/8 -9/16 +7/4 +1/4 -1.

Let me convert all to 16 denominator:

3/16 -6/16 -9/16 +28/16 +4/16 -16/16.

Compute:

(3 -6 -9 +28 +4 -16)/16 = (3 -6= -3; -3 -9= -12; -12 +28=16; 16 +4=20; 20 -16=4)/16 =4/16=1/4≠0.

So, t=1/2 is not a root.

t=1/3:

P(1/3)=12*(1/3)^6 -12*(1/3)^5 -9*(1/3)^4 +14*(1/3)^3 + (1/3)^2 -1.

Compute each term:

12*(1/729)=12/729=4/243,

-12*(1/243)=-12/243=-4/81,

-9*(1/81)=-1/9,

14*(1/27)=14/27,

1/9,

-1.

Convert all to denominator 729:

4/243 = 12/729,

-4/81 = -36/729,

-1/9 = -81/729,

14/27 = 378/729,

1/9 = 81/729,

-1 = -729/729.

Sum:

12 -36 -81 +378 +81 -729 all over 729.

Compute numerator:

12 -36= -24,

-24 -81= -105,

-105 +378=273,

273 +81=354,

354 -729= -375.

So, numerator is -375, so P(1/3)= -375/729 ≠0.

Similarly, t= -1/2:

P(-1/2)=12*(-1/2)^6 -12*(-1/2)^5 -9*(-1/2)^4 +14*(-1/2)^3 + (-1/2)^2 -1.

Compute each term:

12*(1/64)=3/16,

-12*(-1/32)=12/32=3/8,

-9*(1/16)=-9/16,

14*(-1/8)=-7/4,

(1/4),

-1.

Convert to 16 denominator:

3/16 +6/16 -9/16 -28/16 +4/16 -16/16.

Sum:

(3 +6 -9 -28 +4 -16)/16 = (9 -9=0; 0 -28= -28; -28 +4= -24; -24 -16= -40)/16= -40/16= -5/2≠0.

So, t=-1/2 is not a root.

t=1/4:

P(1/4)=12*(1/4)^6 -12*(1/4)^5 -9*(1/4)^4 +14*(1/4)^3 + (1/4)^2 -1.

Compute each term:

12*(1/4096)=12/4096=3/1024,

-12*(1/1024)=-12/1024=-3/256,

-9*(1/256)=-9/256,

14*(1/64)=14/64=7/32,

1/16,

-1.

Convert to 1024 denominator:

3/1024 - 12/1024 - 36/1024 + 224/1024 + 64/1024 -1024/1024.

Sum:

3 -12 -36 +224 +64 -1024 all over 1024.

Compute numerator:

3 -12=-9,

-9 -36=-45,

-45 +224=179,

179 +64=243,

243 -1024= -781.

So, P(1/4)= -781/1024 ≠0.

Similarly, t=1/6:

But maybe this is taking too long. Alternatively, perhaps D(t) is a perfect square or can be factored otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, maybe instead of going through all this, perhaps there's a geometric interpretation.

Given that point C is on AB and not lying on any other PQ(t) except for AB, so it's the unique point on AB that is not on any other segment from F. So, perhaps the envelope of the family F is tangent to AB at C, meaning that C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

Therefore, perhaps if I can find the envelope of family F, then find its tangent point with AB, which would be point C.

So, to find the envelope, I can use the standard method for finding the envelope of a family of curves.

Given a family of curves F(t, x, y) =0, the envelope satisfies F(t, x, y)=0 and dF/dt=0.

So, let's express the equation of PQ(t). Earlier, we had:

For PQ(t), the line is y = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)x + sqrt(1 - t^2).

So, let me write F(t, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)x - sqrt(1 - t^2) =0.

So, F(t, x, y)= y + (sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)x - sqrt(1 - t^2).

Compute dF/dt:

dF/dt = derivative of F with respect to t.

Let me compute derivative term by term.

First term: derivative of y w.r. to t is 0.

Second term: derivative of (sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)x.

Let me denote u = sqrt(1 - t^2)/t.

Then, du/dt = [ (-t^2/(sqrt(1 - t^2)) - sqrt(1 - t^2) ) / t^2 ].

Wait, let me compute it properly.

u = (1 - t^2)^{1/2} / t.

So, du/dt = [ ( (1/2)(1 - t^2)^{-1/2}*(-2t) )*t - (1 - t^2)^{1/2}*1 ] / t^2.

Simplify numerator:

= [ (-t)(1 - t^2)^{-1/2} - (1 - t^2)^{1/2} ].

Factor out - (1 - t^2)^{-1/2}:

= - (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} [ t + (1 - t^2) ].

= - (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} [ t +1 - t^2 ].

So, du/dt = - (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} ( t +1 - t^2 ) / t^2.

Third term: derivative of -sqrt(1 - t^2) is (-1/(2 sqrt(1 - t^2)))*(-2t) = t / sqrt(1 - t^2).

So, dF/dt = du/dt + derivative of last term:

= [ - (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} ( t +1 - t^2 ) / t^2 ] + [ t / sqrt(1 - t^2) ].

Set dF/dt =0:

[ - (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} ( t +1 - t^2 ) / t^2 ] + [ t / sqrt(1 - t^2) ] =0.

Multiply both sides by t^2 sqrt(1 - t^2) to eliminate denominators:

- ( t +1 - t^2 ) + t^3 =0.

Simplify:

- t -1 + t^2 + t^3 =0.

Rearranged:

t^3 + t^2 - t -1=0.

Factor this cubic equation:

t^3 + t^2 - t -1.

Let me factor by grouping:

(t^3 + t^2) + (-t -1) = t^2(t +1) -1(t +1) = (t^2 -1)(t +1) = (t -1)(t +1)(t +1).

So, t^3 + t^2 - t -1 = (t -1)(t +1)^2.

So, solutions are t=1 and t=-1.

But t ranges from 0 to1, so t=1 is the only relevant solution.

Therefore, the envelope is tangent to AB at t=1, which is point B(0, sqrt(3)/2). But point B is an endpoint of AB, so that can't be the point C we are looking for.

Wait, that's confusing. So, according to this, the envelope is tangent to AB at B, which is an endpoint, but we need a point C on AB, different from A and B, which does not lie on any other PQ(t).

But according to the envelope method, the only point where the envelope is tangent to AB is at B, so perhaps point C is B? But the problem states that C is not A or B, so maybe the envelope method is not applicable here or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the envelope is not the same as the point where C is located. Maybe instead, C is where the family F is not just tangent but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where the line AB is such that for all other t, the line PQ(t) doesn't pass through C.

Alternatively, perhaps it's where the derivative is zero, but since we only get t=1, which is B, that may not be the case.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that point C lies on AB and not on any other PQ(t). So, for C to not lie on any other PQ(t), the equation we had earlier:

sqrt(3)s = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)s + sqrt(1 - t^2)

must have no solution for t ≠1/2.

Which implies that the quadratic equation in s, for each t ≠1/2, has no real solution.

Therefore, discriminant D must be negative.

So, from earlier, D = -48t^6 +48t^5 +36t^4 -56t^3 -4t^2 +4.

We need D <0 for all t ≠1/2.

But we can factor D as:

D = -4*(12t^6 -12t^5 -9t^4 +14t^3 + t^2 -1).

Now, perhaps 12t^6 -12t^5 -9t^4 +14t^3 + t^2 -1 can be factored.

Let me try to factor it.

Let me attempt to factor 12t^6 -12t^5 -9t^4 +14t^3 +t^2 -1.

Perhaps group terms:

(12t^6 -12t^5) + (-9t^4 +14t^3) + (t^2 -1).

Factor:

12t^5(t -1) - t^3(9t -14) + (t -1)(t +1).

Hmm, doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps factor as (at^3 + bt^2 + ct + d)(et^3 + ft^2 + gt + h).

But that might take a long time.

Alternatively, maybe substitute s = t +1/t or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe try to factor 12t^6 -12t^5 -9t^4 +14t^3 +t^2 -1.

Wait, let me try t=1 again:

12 -12 -9 +14 +1 -1=5≠0.

t= -1: 12 +12 -9 -14 +1 -1= (24 -20)+( -9 +1 -1)=4 -9= -5≠0.

t=1/2: 12*(1/64) -12*(1/32) -9*(1/16)+14*(1/8)+1*(1/4) -1.

Compute:

12/64=3/16,

-12/32=-3/8,

-9/16,

14/8=7/4,

1/4,

-1.

Convert to 16 denominator:

3/16 -6/16 -9/16 +28/16 +4/16 -16/16.

Total: (3 -6 -9 +28 +4 -16)/16=(3-6= -3; -3-9= -12; -12+28=16; 16+4=20; 20-16=4)/16=4/16=1/4≠0.

t=1/3:

12*(1/729) -12*(1/243) -9*(1/81)+14*(1/27)+1*(1/9) -1.

Compute each term:

12/729=4/243≈0.0164,

-12/243≈-0.0494,

-9/81=-1/9≈-0.1111,

14/27≈0.5185,

1/9≈0.1111,

-1.

Convert to decimal:

≈0.0164 -0.0494 -0.1111 +0.5185 +0.1111 -1≈

0.0164 -0.0494≈-0.033,

-0.033 -0.1111≈-0.1441,

-0.1441 +0.5185≈0.3744,

0.3744 +0.1111≈0.4855,

0.4855 -1≈-0.5145≠0.

So, not a root.

Wait, maybe D(t) is always positive or always negative except at t=1/2.

But since at t=0, D(t)= -4*(12*0 -0 -0 +0 +0 -1)= -4*(-1)=4>0.

At t=1/2, D(t)=5>0.

At t=1, D(t)= -4*(12 -12 -9 +14 +1 -1)= -4*(5)= -20<0.

So, D(t) is positive at t=0, positive at t=1/2, negative at t=1.

Hence, there must be a root between t=1/2 and t=1 where D(t)=0, which corresponds to the envelope.

Wait, but earlier with the discriminant, we have D(t) being positive before t=1, but negative after t=1? Wait, but t is in [0,1].

Wait, if D(t) is positive for t=0 and t=1/2, but negative at t=1, then by continuity, it must cross zero somewhere between t=1/2 and t=1.

Therefore, there exists a t in (1/2,1) where D(t)=0, which would be the point where PQ(t) is tangent to AB.

Therefore, the envelope touches AB at that t, which would be the point C.

Wait, but the problem states that C is not equal to A or B. So, maybe that's this t.

But since the envelope is tangent to AB at that t, that would be point C.

Therefore, to find point C, we need to solve for t where discriminant D(t)=0, which is when dF/dt=0 and F(t,x,y)=0.

But since we can't factor D(t), perhaps let me try to solve D(t)=0.

From above, D(t) = -4*(12t^6 -12t^5 -9t^4 +14t^3 + t^2 -1).

Set D(t)=0:

12t^6 -12t^5 -9t^4 +14t^3 +t^2 -1=0.

I need to solve this equation for t in (1/2,1). Let me denote Q(t)=12t^6 -12t^5 -9t^4 +14t^3 +t^2 -1.

Compute Q(1)=12 -12 -9 +14 +1 -1=5.

Q(3/4)=12*(729/4096) -12*(243/1024) -9*(81/256) +14*(27/64) +9/16 -1.

Compute each term:

12*(729/4096)=8748/4096≈2.135,

-12*(243/1024)= -2916/1024≈-2.847,

-9*(81/256)= -729/256≈-2.847,

14*(27/64)=378/64≈5.906,

9/16≈0.5625,

-1.

So, sum≈2.135 -2.847 -2.847 +5.906 +0.5625 -1≈

2.135 -2.847≈-0.712,

-0.712 -2.847≈-3.559,

-3.559 +5.906≈2.347,

2.347 +0.5625≈2.909,

2.909 -1≈1.909>0.

So, Q(3/4)=~1.909>0.

Compute Q(0.8):

t=0.8.

Compute Q(0.8)=12*(0.8)^6 -12*(0.8)^5 -9*(0.8)^4 +14*(0.8)^3 + (0.8)^2 -1.

Compute each term:

0.8^2=0.64,

0.8^3=0.512,

0.8^4=0.4096,

0.8^5=0.32768,

0.8^6=0.262144.

So,

12*0.262144≈3.1457,

-12*0.32768≈-3.9322,

-9*0.4096≈-3.6864,

14*0.512≈7.168,

Sum:

3.1457 -3.9322≈-0.7865,

-0.7865 -3.6864≈-4.4729,

-4.4729 +7.168≈2.695,

2.695 +0.64≈3.335,

3.335 -1≈2.335>0.

So, Q(0.8)=~2.335>0.

t=0.9:

Compute Q(0.9):

0.9^2=0.81,

0.9^3=0.729,

0.9^4=0.6561,

0.9^5=0.59049,

0.9^6=0.531441.

Compute each term:

12*0.531441≈6.377,

-12*0.59049≈-7.0859,

-9*0.6561≈-5.9049,

14*0.729≈10.206,

0.81,

-1.

Sum:

6.377 -7.0859≈-0.7089,

-0.7089 -5.9049≈-6.6138,

-6.6138 +10.206≈3.592,

3.592 +0.81≈4.402,

4.402 -1≈3.402>0.

So, Q(0.9)=~3.402>0.

t=0.95:

Compute Q(0.95):

Compute each term:

-12*0.77378≈-9.285,

-9*0.8145≈-7.3305,

14*0.857375≈12.003,

0.9025,

-1.

Sum:

8.821 -9.285≈-0.464,

-0.464 -7.3305≈-7.7945,

-7.7945 +12.003≈4.2085,

4.2085 +0.9025≈5.111,

5.111 -1≈4.111>0.

So, Q(0.95)=~4.111>0.

Wait, but earlier, we saw that at t=1, Q(t)=5>0, but wait, earlier I thought D(t)= -4Q(t), so D(t) negative at t=1 because Q(t)=5, so D(t)= -4*5=-20<0.

Wait, but according to Q(t) at t=1, Q(1)=5>0, but Q(t) approaches 5 as t approaches1.

Wait, but that can't be, because earlier, when we computed D(t)= -4Q(t), and at t=1, D(t)=-20<0, which would imply Q(1)=5>0.

Wait, but at t=1, D(t)= -4*(5)= -20<0.

So, perhaps I need to recompute Q(t).

Wait, Q(t)=12t^6 -12t^5 -9t^4 +14t^3 +t^2 -1.

At t=1:

12 -12 -9 +14 +1 -1= (12-12)=0, (0-9)= -9, (-9+14)=5, (5+1)=6, (6-1)=5.

So, Q(1)=5>0.

So, as t approaches1, Q(t) approaches5>0.

Therefore, D(t)= -4Q(t) approaches -20<0.

Similarly, at t=0, Q(t)=0 -0 -0 +0 +0 -1= -1, so D(t)= -4*(-1)=4>0.

Therefore, Q(t) is negative at t=0, positive at t=1, but in our earlier computations, at t=1/2, Q(t)= -5/2= -2.5, which is negative, but wait, no.

Wait, Q(t)=12t^6 -12t^5 -9t^4 +14t^3 +t^2 -1.

At t=1/2:

12*(1/64)≈0.1875,

-12*(1/32)= -0.375,

-9*(1/16)= -0.5625,

14*(1/8)=1.75,

(1/4)=0.25,

-1.

Sum≈0.1875 -0.375 -0.5625 +1.75 +0.25 -1≈

0.1875 -0.375≈-0.1875,

-0.1875 -0.5625≈-0.75,

-0.75 +1.75≈1,

1 +0.25≈1.25,

1.25 -1≈0.25.

Wait, so Q(1/2)=0.25>0.

Wait, but earlier, when we considered D(t)= -4Q(t), D(t)= -4*(0.25)= -1<0. So, point C is when D(t)=0, which is when Q(t)=0.

So, Q(t)=0 somewhere between t=0 and t=1/2.

Wait, at t=0, Q(t)= -1<0,

At t=1/2, Q(t)=0.25>0,

Therefore, by Intermediate Value Theorem, Q(t)=0 has a root in (0,1/2).

Similarly, Q(t) is negative at t=0, positive at t=1/2, negative at t=1, etc.

Wait, but no, Q(t) is negative at t=0, positive at t=1/2, and then positive at t=1.

Wait, so it's crossing zero from negative to positive between t=0 and t=1/2, and then remains positive beyond t=1/2.

So, only one real root in (0,1/2).

But since D(t) was negative at t=1, but positive at t=1/2, that suggests that the envelope is tangent to AB at some t between 0 and1/2.

But in the problem statement, C is different from A and B, so it must be in (0,1). But according to Q(t), it's only crossing zero once in (0,1/2). So, maybe there is another point where another envelope is tangent.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach.

Given that point C lies on AB and is not on any other PQ(t), then for all other t≠1/2, the line PQ(t) does not pass through C.

So, the set of all such points C is the set of points on AB such that they are not covered by any PQ(t) except for AB itself.

Therefore, the point C is the point where the number of PQ(t) lines covering it is exactly one, which is AB.

But I need a way to find such a point.

Alternatively, perhaps think of AB as a line, and all PQ(t) as lines that cover AB except at point C, which is only covered by AB.

So, perhaps point C is such that it's the only point on AB not covered by any PQ(t) except AB.

Therefore, to find C, we need the point on AB which is not on any PQ(t) for t≠1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps find the point on AB which is not an image of any PQ(t) for t≠1/2.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the set of PQ(t) forms a family of lines with a certain envelope, and the point C is the intersection of AB with this envelope.

But earlier, we saw that the envelope is tangent to AB at t=1, which is point B.

But the problem says that C is not point A or B, so that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the envelope is only tangent at B, but perhaps point C is the intersection of AB with another envelope? Or maybe I need to consider something else.

Alternatively, maybe point C is the intersection point of AB with the envelope of the family F, but not a tangent point.

Wait, the envelope is the set of points where each envelope member is tangent to F(t).

Wait, perhaps I can find the envelope and then find its intersection with AB.

But as before, we found that the envelope is tangent to AB at B, so that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is the point on AB where it's not covered by any PQ(t) except AB.

Therefore, to find such a point, perhaps look for a point C on AB such that the line AC is not part of any PQ(t) except AB.

Wait, that may not be sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps think of it as follows: The family F is all segments from (t,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)). So, each such segment is a chord of the unit circle, right? Since (t,0) and (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)) lie on the unit circle.

So, the family F is the set of all chords from (t,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)) for t∈[0,1].

Therefore, the envelope of these chords is the set of points where these chords are tangent to some curve.

So, perhaps the envelope is the unit circle itself? But that can't be, because the chords are all secants.

Wait, no, the unit circle is the locus of all points (t, sqrt(1 - t^2)), but the chords are different.

Wait, actually, all these points (t, sqrt(1 - t^2)) lie on the unit circle, but the chords are the lines connecting (t,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)).

So, perhaps the envelope of these chords is the unit circle.

Wait, but if I take the envelope of all such chords, which are secant lines of the unit circle, the envelope would be the unit circle itself.

But in that case, the envelope is the unit circle, so the envelope is tangent to each chord at exactly one point.

But since the chords are secants, each chord would intersect the unit circle at two points: (t, sqrt(1 - t^2)) and (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)). Wait, no: (t,0) is on the unit circle if t=1, but (t,0) is only on the unit circle when t=1. Similarly, (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)) is on the unit circle when t=0.

Wait, actually, (t,0) is on the unit circle only when t=1, because sqrt(1 - t^2)=0 only when t=1.

Similarly, (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)) is on the unit circle only when t=0, because sqrt(1 - t^2)=1 when t=0.

So, each chord PQ(t) connects a point on the x-axis (t,0) to a point on the y-axis (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)), both of which lie on the unit circle except for t=1 and t=0.

Therefore, the chords PQ(t) are all secants of the unit circle, each connecting a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis.

So, the envelope of these chords is the unit circle. Therefore, each chord is tangent to the unit circle at exactly one point.

Wait, but each chord PQ(t) is connecting two points on the unit circle, so it's a secant, not a tangent.

Therefore, perhaps the envelope of the chords is not the unit circle.

Wait, I think the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point.

In this case, if the chords PQ(t) are secants of the unit circle, then their envelope would be the unit circle, since each chord is tangent to the unit circle at some point.

Wait, but each chord PQ(t) connects (t,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)), which are two different points on the unit circle.

Therefore, each chord is a secant, but the envelope might still be the unit circle.

Wait, let me consider a point on the unit circle, say (cosθ, sinθ). Is there a chord PQ(t) that's tangent to the unit circle at (cosθ, sinθ)?

The tangent to the unit circle at (cosθ, sinθ) is the line x cosθ + y sinθ =1.

So, if PQ(t) is tangent to the unit circle at (cosθ, sinθ), then the line x cosθ + y sinθ =1 must coincide with PQ(t).

But PQ(t) is the line connecting (t,0) and (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)).

So, let's find t such that PQ(t) is tangent to the unit circle at (cosθ, sinθ).

Thus, the equation of PQ(t) is x/(t) + y/sqrt(1 - t^2) =1.

And the tangent line at (cosθ, sinθ) is x cosθ + y sinθ=1.

Therefore, for these two lines to coincide, their coefficients must be proportional.

So,

1/t / cosθ = 1/sqrt(1 - t^2) / sinθ = 1/1.

So, 1/t / cosθ =1, and 1/sqrt(1 - t^2) / sinθ=1.

Therefore,

1/t = cosθ,

and

1/sqrt(1 - t^2) = sinθ.

From the first equation, cosθ =1/t.

From the second equation, sinθ=1/sqrt(1 - t^2).

But since cos²θ + sin²θ=1,

(1/t)^2 + (1/(1 - t^2))=1.

So,

1/t² + 1/(1 - t²)=1.

Let me solve this equation for t.

Multiply both sides by t²(1 - t²):

(1 - t²) + t² = t²(1 - t²).

Simplify numerator:

1 - t² + t² =1.

So,

1= t²(1 - t²).

Therefore,

t² - t⁴=1,

t⁴ - t² +1=0.

Wait, that equation is t⁴ - t² +1=0.

Discriminant: (-1)^2 -4*1*1=1 -4=-3<0.

Therefore, no real solutions.

Therefore, the chord PQ(t) is never tangent to the unit circle.

Therefore, the envelope of PQ(t) is not the unit circle.

Therefore, my previous assumption was wrong.

So, going back, since the envelope of the family PQ(t) is different, we need to find where it's tangent to AB.

Earlier, we tried setting dF/dt=0 and found t=1 and t=-1, but those correspond to endpoints.

But perhaps, actually, the envelope only touches AB at point B, which is not allowed.

Therefore, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps use the concept of poles and polars.

In projective geometry, the polar line of a point with respect to a circle is the set of points whose lines to the given point are conjugate.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is the intersection of AB with the polar of the origin with respect to the unit circle.

Wait, the unit circle has the equation x² + y²=1.

The polar of a point (x0, y0) with respect to the unit circle is xx0 + yy0=1.

So, the polar of the origin (0,0) is 0x +0y=1, which is not a valid line.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the point C such that for all PQ(t), the point C is not on PQ(t) unless t=1/2.

Therefore, to find such a point C, for each PQ(t), when t≠1/2, the line PQ(t) does not pass through C.

So, the set of all such points C is the set of points on AB that are not on any PQ(t) for t≠1/2.

Thus, the point C is the unique such point, which is not A or B.

So, how do we find such a point?

Perhaps, the point C can be found by considering that C is the intersection point of AB with the envelope of the family PQ(t).

But earlier, the envelope is tangent to AB only at B, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is the midpoint of AB.

Wait, let's compute the midpoint of AB.

Point A is (1/2, 0), point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2).

Midpoint is ( (1/2 +0)/2, (0 + sqrt(3)/2)/2 ) = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4).

So, point (1/4, sqrt(3)/4).

But is this point C?

Wait, let me check whether this point is on any PQ(t) for t≠1/2.

Compute whether (1/4, sqrt(3)/4) lies on PQ(t).

So, for some t≠1/2, does (1/4, sqrt(3)/4) lie on PQ(t)?

Equation of PQ(t):

y = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)x + sqrt(1 - t^2).

Set x=1/4, y= sqrt(3)/4.

So,

sqrt(3)/4 = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)*(1/4) + sqrt(1 - t^2).

Multiply both sides by 4:

sqrt(3) = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t) + 4 sqrt(1 - t^2).

Rearrange:

sqrt(3) + (sqrt(1 - t^2)/t) = 4 sqrt(1 - t^2).

Multiply both sides by t:

t sqrt(3) + sqrt(1 - t^2) = 4 t sqrt(1 - t^2).

Rearrange:

t sqrt(3) = 4 t sqrt(1 - t^2) - sqrt(1 - t^2).

Factor sqrt(1 - t^2):

t sqrt(3) = sqrt(1 - t^2)(4t -1).

Square both sides:

3 t² = (1 - t²)(16 t² -8t +1).

Expand RHS:

16 t² -8t +1 -16 t⁴ +8 t³ -t².

So,

16 t² -8t +1 -16 t⁴ +8 t³ -t²= -16 t⁴ +8 t³ +15 t² -8t +1.

Set equal to LHS:

3 t² = -16 t⁴ +8 t³ +15 t² -8t +1.

Bring all terms to RHS:

0= -16 t⁴ +8 t³ +15 t² -8t +1 -3 t².

Simplify:

-16 t⁴ +8 t³ +12 t² -8t +1=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

16 t⁴ -8 t³ -12 t² +8t -1=0.

Let me call this equation (4):

16 t⁴ -8 t³ -12 t² +8t -1=0.

Let me attempt to factor this.

Try t=1/2:

16*(1/16) -8*(1/8) -12*(1/4) +8*(1/2) -1=1 -1 -3 +4 -1=0.

So, t=1/2 is a root.

Therefore, factor out (t -1/2).

Use polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide 16t^4 -8t^3 -12t^2 +8t -1 by t -1/2.

Using synthetic division:

Multiply everything by 2 to make it integer coefficients:

32t^4 -16t^3 -24t^2 +16t -2.

Divide by 2t -1.

Using synthetic division:

Root t=1/2.

Bring down 32.

Multiply by 1/2:16.

Add to next coefficient: -16 +16=0.

Multiply by1/2:0.

Add to next coefficient: -24 +0=-24.

Multiply by1/2: -12.

Add to next coefficient:16 + (-12)=4.

Multiply by1/2:2.

Add to last coefficient: -2 +2=0.

So, the quotient polynomial is 32t^3 +0t^2 -24t +4.

Therefore,

32t^4 -16t^3 -24t^2 +16t -2= (2t -1)(32t^3 -24t +4).

Factor out 4 from the cubic:

= (2t -1)*4*(8t^3 -6t +1).

So, original equation:

16t^4 -8t^3 -12t^2 +8t -1= (t -1/2)(16t^3 -12t +2).

Wait, no, let me see.

Wait, 32t^4 -16t^3 -24t^2 +16t -2= (2t -1)(16t^3 -12t +2).

Therefore, original equation is 16t^4 -8t^3 -12t^2 +8t -1= (2t -1)(8t^3 -6t +1).

Wait, because 32t^4 -16t^3 -24t^2 +16t -2= (2t -1)(16t^3 -12t +2). So, dividing both sides by 2:

16t^4 -8t^3 -12t^2 +8t -1= (2t -1)(8t^3 -6t +1).

Therefore, our quartic factors as (2t -1)(8t^3 -6t +1)=0.

Thus, t=1/2 is a root, and the other roots are roots of 8t^3 -6t +1=0.

So, solving 8t^3 -6t +1=0.

Let me attempt to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem.

Possible roots are t=±1, t=±1/2, t=±1/4, t=±1/8.

Test t=1: 8 -6 +1=3≠0.

t= -1: -8 +6 +1=-1≠0.

t=1/2:8*(1/8) -6*(1/2) +1=1 -3 +1=-1≠0.

t= -1/2:8*(-1/8) -6*(-1/2) +1= -1 +3 +1=3≠0.

t=1/4:8*(1/64) -6*(1/4) +1=1/8 - 3/2 +1= (1 -12 +8)/8= (-3)/8≠0.

t= -1/4:8*(-1/64) -6*(-1/4) +1= -1/8 + 3/2 +1= (-1 +12 +8)/8=19/8≠0.

t=1/8:8*(1/512) -6*(1/8) +1=1/64 - 3/4 +1≈0.015625 -0.75 +1≈0.265625≠0.

t= -1/8:8*(-1/512) -6*(-1/8) +1≈-0.015625 +0.75 +1≈1.734375≠0.

So, no rational roots. Therefore, the cubic must be solved using methods for cubics.

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric substitution or Cardano's formula.

Let me write the cubic as 8t³ -6t +1=0.

Divide both sides by 2:

4t³ -3t +0.5=0.

Let me set u=2t.

Then, t=u/2.

Substitute into equation:

4*(u/2)^3 -3*(u/2) +0.5=0.

Compute each term:

4*(u³/8)=0.5u³,

-3*(u/2)= -1.5u,

+0.5.

So,

0.5u³ -1.5u +0.5=0.

Multiply both sides by 2:

u³ -3u +1=0.

So, the equation becomes u³ -3u +1=0.

This is a depressed cubic. Let me use Cardano's formula.

For equation u³ + pu + q=0, here p=-3, q=1.

Discriminant D=(q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3=(1/2)^2 + (-1)^3=1/4 -1= -3/4<0.

Therefore, three real roots.

Using trigonometric substitution:

u=2*sqrt(|p|/3) cosθ=2*sqrt(3/3) cosθ=2*1*cosθ=2cosθ.

So, substitute u=2cosθ.

Then,

(2cosθ)^3 -3*(2cosθ)+1=0.

Compute:

8cos³θ -6cosθ +1=0.

But 8cos³θ -6cosθ=2*(4cos³θ -3cosθ)=2cos3θ.

Therefore,

2cos3θ +1=0,

cos3θ= -1/2.

So,

3θ= 2π/3 +2πk or 4π/3 +2πk,

θ=2π/9 +2πk/3 or 4π/9 +2πk/3.

So, the three roots are:

u=2cos(2π/9),

u=2cos(4π/9),

u=2cos(8π/9).

But since 8π/9= π - π/9, cos(8π/9)= -cos(π/9).

So, three real roots are:

u=2cos(2π/9),

u=2cos(4π/9),

u=2cos(8π/9)= -2cos(π/9).

Therefore, the roots of the cubic are:

t= u/2= cos(2π/9),

t= cos(4π/9),

t= -cos(π/9).

So, the roots of 8t³ -6t +1=0 are t=cos(2π/9), cos(4π/9), -cos(π/9).

Therefore, the quartic equation 16t^4 -8t³ -12t² +8t -1=0 has roots t=1/2, t=cos(2π/9), t=cos(4π/9), t= -cos(π/9).

So, the real roots are t=1/2, t=cos(2π/9)≈0.766, t=cos(4π/9)≈0.1736, t= -cos(π/9)≈-0.9397.

But t ∈ [0,1], so t=1/2≈0.5, t≈0.1736, t≈0.766.

Thus, solutions t=1/2, t≈0.1736, t≈0.766.

Therefore, equation (4) has solutions t=1/2, t≈0.1736, t≈0.766.

So, when we plug these t into the equation of PQ(t), we get points on PQ(t) that pass through (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Therefore, (1/4, sqrt(3)/4) lies on PQ(t) for t=1/2, t≈0.1736, t≈0.766.

But since we are looking for a point C on AB which is not on any PQ(t) except for AB itself, so the only such point is (1/4, sqrt(3)/4), because for t=1/2, it's on AB, but for other t's, it's on PQ(t). But wait, for t≈0.1736 and t≈0.766, the point (1/4, sqrt(3)/4) is on PQ(t), so it's on other lines.

Therefore, (1/4, sqrt(3)/4) is on multiple PQ(t)'s, so it's not a point that's only on AB and no other PQ(t).

Wait, that contradicts.

Alternatively, wait, but the point C is supposed to be on AB, and not lie on any PQ(t) except its own.

But since (1/4, sqrt(3)/4) is on PQ(t) for multiple t's, it's not the desired point.

Wait, maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, the problem says that "there is a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that does not lie on any of the segments from A to P or from B to Q other than PQ2."

Therefore, point C must be on AB, and for any PQ(t) with t≠1/2, the segment PQ(t) does not pass through C.

So, the set of such points C is the intersection of AB with the complement of all PQ(t) for t≠1/2.

But how to compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps point C is the intersection of AB with the envelope of the family F.

Wait, but as we saw earlier, the envelope is tangent to AB at B.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is where the envelope meets AB.

But again, it's only at B.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is where the two envelopes from the two sides meet.

Wait, since each segment PQ(t) is for t in [0,1], but the family is symmetric?

Wait, no, t is from 0 to1, but each PQ(t) is determined uniquely by t.

Wait, perhaps, since the family is parameterized by t, and for each t, PQ(t) is unique, the envelope is formed by the limit of nearby PQ(t)s.

But as we saw, the envelope is tangent at B.

Alternatively, perhaps, I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, maybe the point C is the midpoint of AB, but as we saw, it's not on any PQ(t) for t≠1/2.

But earlier, my calculation showed that it is on PQ(t) for t≈0.1736 and t≈0.766, so C is not on the envelope.

Wait, maybe C is the point where the sum of the distances from C to A and C to B is minimal or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of least squares.

Alternatively, maybe the locus of points C on AB such that the distance from C to PQ(t) is maximized or something.

Alternatively, perhaps find the point C on AB such that the polar of C with respect to the unit circle is tangent to PQ(t).

Wait, too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps use the concept of the point where the directional derivative is zero, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that point C is such that its reflection over AB or something.

Alternatively, maybe it's the orthocenter or centroid, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of the problem: since all segments PQ(t) for t≠1/2 do not pass through C, then the only such point is the point where all PQ(t) are as far as possible from C.

Wait, but how.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is where the minimal distance from AB to PQ(t) is achieved.

But this is too vague.

Wait, another thought.

Since the problem states that C is on AB, not on any PQ(t) for t≠1/2, meaning that C is not covered by any PQ(t) except AB.

So, the set of points C is the intersection of AB with the complement of the union of all PQ(t) for t≠1/2.

Thus, C is the only point on AB that is not covered by any other PQ(t).

But to find such a point, perhaps it's where the union of PQ(t) for t≠1/2 misses AB.

But how.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is the point where the line AB is only intersected by PQ(t) at C and B.

But for that, we need to find a point C on AB such that any other PQ(t) doesn't pass through C.

Wait, meaning that C is on AB, and for all t≠1/2, PQ(t) does not pass through C.

Therefore, for each t≠1/2, the line PQ(t) does not pass through C.

Therefore, for each t≠1/2, the determinant of the system:

[x; y;1] on PQ(t),

and [Cx; Cy;1] should not be colinear.

But maybe that's too abstract.

Alternatively, since we have the equation of PQ(t) as y = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)x + sqrt(1 - t^2).

So, for a fixed point C=(c_x, c_y) on AB, which is AB: y= -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3).

So, to ensure that for all t≠1/2, the point C is not on PQ(t), we need that for all t≠1/2, the equation c_y = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)c_x + sqrt(1 - t^2) does not hold.

So, for each t≠1/2, the equation:

c_y = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)c_x + sqrt(1 - t^2).

We can rearrange:

c_y = sqrt(1 - t^2)(1 - c_x/t).

Let me write this as:

sqrt(1 - t^2) = c_y / (1 - c_x/t).

But then, square both sides:

1 - t^2 = c_y² / (1 - c_x/t)^2.

Multiply both sides by (1 - c_x/t)^2:

(1 - t^2)(1 - c_x/t)^2 = c_y².

But this is a quartic equation in t, unless c_x and c_y are chosen such that it's only satisfied for t=1/2.

But we need that for all t≠1/2, the equation is not satisfied.

Therefore, the equation must have only t=1/2 as a solution.

Therefore, setting it up as:

(1 - t^2)(1 - c_x/t)^2 - c_y²=0.

But since C is on AB, we have c_y= -sqrt(3)c_x + sqrt(3).

Therefore, c_y= -sqrt(3)c_x + sqrt(3).

So, substituting c_y into the above equation:

(1 - t^2)(1 - c_x/t)^2 - (-sqrt(3)c_x + sqrt(3))²=0.

Let me expand this:

(1 - t^2)(1 - 2c_x/t + c_x²/t²) - (3c_x² - 2*3 c_x + 3)=0.

Simplify term by term:

First term:

(1 - t^2)(1 - 2c_x/t + c_x²/t²)= (1 - t^2)(1 + c_x²/t² - 2c_x/t).

Multiply through:

= (1 - t^2)(1) + (1 - t^2)(c_x²/t²) - (1 - t^2)(2c_x/t).

=1 - t² + c_x²/t² - c_x² - 2c_x/t + 2c_x t.

Second term:

- (3c_x² -6c_x +3)= -3c_x² +6c_x -3.

So, combine all terms:

(1 - t² + c_x²/t² - c_x² - 2c_x/t + 2c_x t) + (-3c_x² +6c_x -3)=0.

Simplify:

1 - t² + c_x²/t² - c_x² - 2c_x/t + 2c_x t -3c_x² +6c_x -3=0.

Combine like terms:

Constants:1 -3=-2.

t² terms:-t².

c_x²/t²: +c_x²/t².

c_x² terms: -c_x² -3c_x²= -4c_x².

c_x/t terms: -2c_x/t.

c_x t terms:+2c_x t.

c_x terms:+6c_x.

So, overall:

-2 - t² + c_x²/t² -4c_x² -2c_x/t +2c_x t +6c_x=0.

This is a complicated equation in t, but for the equation to hold for all t≠1/2 except t=1/2, the coefficients for each power of t must be zero.

But this is extremely complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the coefficients can be set to zero for each power.

But this would require matching coefficients for t², 1/t², 1/t, t, constants, and c_x terms.

It's getting too messy.

Alternatively, perhaps make substitution to simplify.

Let me denote u= t -1/t.

Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps set t=1, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps since the equation must hold for all t≠1/2, each coefficient must be zero.

Therefore, equate coefficients for each power of t.

But the equation is:

-2 - t² + c_x²/t² -4c_x² -2c_x/t +2c_x t +6c_x=0.

Let me write it as:

(-1)t² + (c_x²/t²) + (2c_x t) + (-2c_x/t) + (-4c_x²) +6c_x -2=0.

Now, group terms by powers of t:

t²: -1.

t: +2c_x.

t^0: c_x² -4c_x² +6c_x -2= -3c_x² +6c_x -2.

t^{-1}: -2c_x.

t^{-2}: c_x².

Therefore, the equation can be written as:

- t² + 2c_x t + (-3c_x² +6c_x -2) + (-2c_x)/t + (c_x²)/t²=0.

So, to satisfy this equation for all t≠0, we have to have each coefficient of t^k equal to zero.

Therefore,

Coefficients of t²: -1=0 → Contradiction.

Similarly, coefficients of t^{-2}: c_x²=0 ⇒ c_x=0.

But c_x=0 would mean point C is at (0, sqrt(3)), which is point B, but point C must be different from B.

Therefore, this approach leads to a contradiction, which suggests that our assumption is wrong.

Therefore, the equation cannot hold for all t≠1/2, which is expected because point C is unique.

Therefore, perhaps if we set the coefficients for t², t^{-2}, t, and t^{-1} to zero, and leave the constant term to be non-zero, but that would leave residual terms.

Alternatively, perhaps this is too convoluted, and maybe I should switch back to the calculus approach.

We have the equation D = -4*(12t^6 -12t^5 -9t^4 +14t^3 +t^2 -1). We need D=0.

But earlier attempts to factor D were unsuccessful.

Alternatively, use substitution.

Let me set u = t^3.

Then, D= -4*(12u² -12t^5 -9u +14t^3 +t² -1).

Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that D=0 is a polynomial of degree 6, which is tough to solve.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is the intersection point of the two lines PQ(t) and PQ(s) for t and s such that the point C is on both lines, but C is not on any other PQ(t).

But since C is unique, maybe using some symmetry.

Alternatively, since the problem is about points on the unit circle, perhaps the point C is the midpoint of AB or something.

Wait, as previously, the midpoint is (1/4, sqrt(3)/4), but it's on PQ(t) for t=cos(2π/9), which is ≈0.766, so that is on another PQ(t). Therefore, not acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps construct the point C such that it lies on AB and is the pole of PQ(t) for some t.

But unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the orthocenter or centroid.

But perhaps let's think differently.

Given that point C is on AB, and for all t≠1/2, the line PQ(t) doesn't pass through C.

Therefore, the point C is such that the equation c_y = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)c_x + sqrt(1 - t^2) has no solution t≠1/2.

Thus, the equation must have no solution t≠1/2, meaning that the equation:

sqrt(1 - t^2) = c_y*(1 - c_x/t).

For real solutions t, this equation must have only t=1/2 as a solution.

Thus, the equation must be satisfied only for t=1/2, but that is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, square both sides:

1 - t^2 = c_y²*(1 - 2c_x/t + c_x²/t²).

But then, multiply both sides by t²:

t²(1 - t²)=c_y²*(t² - 2c_x t + c_x²).

Bring all terms to one side:

t² - t^4 -c_y² t² +2c_x c_y² t -c_x² c_y²=0.

This is a quartic equation in t:

(-1)t^4 + (1 -c_y²)t² + 2c_x c_y² t -c_x² c_y²=0.

We need this equation to have t=1/2 as a root, and no other real roots.

But since it's a quartic, it's difficult.

But if we set t=1/2 as a root, then plug t=1/2 into the equation:

(-1)(1/16) + (1 -c_y²)(1/4) + 2c_x c_y²*(1/2) -c_x² c_y²=0.

Simplify:

-1/16 + (1 -c_y²)/4 + c_x c_y² -c_x² c_y²=0.

Multiply through by 16 to eliminate denominators:

-1 +4(1 -c_y²) +16c_x c_y² -16c_x² c_y²=0.

Compute:

-1 +4 -4c_y² +16c_x c_y² -16c_x² c_y²=0.

Simplify:

3 -4c_y² +16c_x c_y² -16c_x² c_y²=0.

Factor c_y²:

3 +c_y²(-4 +16c_x -16c_x²)=0.

But since C is on AB, c_y= -sqrt(3)c_x + sqrt(3).

Therefore, c_y²=3c_x² - 2sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)c_x +3=3c_x² -6c_x +3.

Substitute into the equation:

3 + (3c_x² -6c_x +3)(-4 +16c_x -16c_x²)=0.

Let me compute this:

Let me denote A=3c_x² -6c_x +3,

B= -4 +16c_x -16c_x².

Then,

3 + A*B=0.

Compute A*B:

(3c_x² -6c_x +3)(-4 +16c_x -16c_x²).

Let me compute term by term:

First, 3c_x²*(-4)= -12c_x².

3c_x²*(16c_x)=48c_x³.

3c_x²*(-16c_x²)= -48c_x^4.

Second, -6c_x*(-4)=24c_x.

-6c_x*(16c_x)= -96c_x².

-6c_x*(-16c_x²)=96c_x³.

Third, 3*(-4)= -12.

3*(16c_x)=48c_x.

3*(-16c_x²)= -48c_x².

So, combining all terms:

-12c_x² +48c_x³ -48c_x^4 +24c_x -96c_x² +96c_x³ -12 +48c_x -48c_x².

Combine like terms:

c_x^4: -48c_x^4.

c_x³:48c_x³ +96c_x³=144c_x³.

c_x²:-12c_x² -96c_x² -48c_x²= -156c_x².

c_x:24c_x +48c_x=72c_x.

Constants:-12.

So, A*B= -48c_x^4 +144c_x³ -156c_x² +72c_x -12.

Thus, 3 + A*B= -48c_x^4 +144c_x³ -156c_x² +72c_x -9=0.

So, the equation is:

-48c_x^4 +144c_x³ -156c_x² +72c_x -9=0.

Divide both sides by -3:

16c_x^4 -48c_x³ +52c_x² -24c_x +3=0.

This is the quartic equation in c_x.

We can attempt to factor this quartic.

Let me try rational roots. Possible roots are factors of 3 over factors of 16: ±1, ±3, ±1/2, ±3/2, ±1/4, ±3/4, ±1/8, ±3/8, ±1/16, ±3/16.

Testing c_x=1:

16 -48 +52 -24 +3= (16 -48)= -32 +52=20 -24= -4 +3= -1≠0.

c_x=3:

16*81 -48*27 +52*9 -24*3 +3=1296 -1296 +468 -72 +3= (1296 -1296)=0 +468=468 -72=396 +3=399≠0.

c_x=1/2:

16*(1/16) -48*(1/8) +52*(1/4) -24*(1/2) +3=1 -6 +13 -12 +3= (1 -6)= -5 +13=8 -12= -4 +3= -1≠0.

c_x=3/2:

16*(81/16) -48*(27/8) +52*(9/4) -24*(3/2) +3=81 -162 +117 -36 +3= (81 -162)= -81 +117=36 -36=0 +3=3≠0.

c_x=1/4:

16*(1/256) -48*(1/64) +52*(1/16) -24*(1/4) +3= (16/256)=1/16 - (48/64)= -3/4 + (52/16)=13/4 -6 +3=1/16 -3/4 +13/4 -6 +3.

Compute step by step:

1/16 -3/4=1/16 -12/16= -11/16.

-11/16 +13/4= -11/16 +52/16=41/16.

41/16 -6=41/16 -96/16= -55/16.

-55/16 +3= -55/16 +48/16= -7/16≠0.

c_x=3/4:

16*(81/256)=81/16,

-48*(27/64)= -48*(27)/64= -1296/64= -81/4,

52*(9/16)=234/16=117/8,

-24*(3/4)= -18,

+3.

So,

81/16 -81/4 +117/8 -18 +3.

Convert to 16 denominator:

81/16 - 324/16 +234/16 -288/16 +48/16.

Sum numerators:

81 -324 +234 -288 +48= (81 -324)= -243 +234= -9 -288= -297 +48= -249.

So, -249/16≠0.

So, no rational roots. Therefore, perhaps factor into quadratics.

Assume (a c_x² +b c_x +d)(e c_x² +f c_x +g)=16c_x^4 -48c_x³ +52c_x² -24c_x +3.

Multiply out:

a e c_x^4 + (a f +b e)c_x³ + (a g +b f +d e)c_x² + (b g +d f)c_x +d g.

Set equal:

a e=16,

a f +b e= -48,

a g +b f +d e=52,

b g +d f= -24,

d g=3.

Looking for integer solutions.

Possible factors for d g=3: d=1,g=3 or d=3,g=1, d=-1,g=-3, d=-3,g=-1.

Try d=1, g=3.

Then,

a e=16,

a f +b e= -48,

a*3 +b f +1*e=52,

b*3 +1*f= -24.

Let me denote equations:

1. a e=16,

2. a f +b e= -48,

3. 3a +b f +e=52,

4. 3b +f= -24.

We need to solve for a,b,e,f.

Let me assume a=4, e=4 (since 4*4=16).

Then,

Equation2:4f +4b= -48 → f +b= -12.

Equation4:3b +f= -24.

From equation2: f= -12 -b.

Plug into equation4:

3b + (-12 -b)= -24 ⇒2b -12= -24 ⇒2b= -12 ⇒b= -6.

Then, f= -12 - (-6)= -6.

Now, equation3:3*4 + (-6)*(-6) +4=12 +36 +4=52. Which is satisfied.

So, we have a=4,e=4,b= -6,f= -6,d=1,g=3.

Thus, the quartic factors as:

(4c_x² -6c_x +1)(4c_x² -6c_x +3)=0.

So, set each quadratic to zero:

First quadratic:4c_x² -6c_x +1=0.

Discriminant:36 -16=20.

Roots: (6 ±sqrt(20))/8= (6 ±2sqrt(5))/8= (3 ±sqrt(5))/4.

Second quadratic:4c_x² -6c_x +3=0.

Discriminant:36 -48= -12<0, no real roots.

Therefore, real roots are c_x=(3 ±sqrt(5))/4.

So, the quartic equation in c_x is satisfied only at c_x=(3 ±sqrt(5))/4.

Therefore, the quartic equation:

16c_x^4 -48c_x³ +52c_x² -24c_x +3=0 has real solutions only at c_x=(3 ±sqrt(5))/4.

Therefore, going back, for each real solution c_x=(3 ±sqrt(5))/4, we can compute c_y= -sqrt(3)c_x + sqrt(3).

Therefore, the points C are:

C1=( (3 +sqrt(5))/4, -sqrt(3)(3 +sqrt(5))/4 + sqrt(3) ).

Simplify c_y:

= -sqrt(3)(3 +sqrt(5))/4 + sqrt(3)

= (-3sqrt(3) -sqrt(15))/4 + (4sqrt(3))/4

= ( (-3sqrt(3) +4sqrt(3)) -sqrt(15) ) /4

= (sqrt(3) -sqrt(15))/4.

Similarly, for C2=( (3 -sqrt(5))/4, -sqrt(3)(3 -sqrt(5))/4 + sqrt(3) ).

Compute c_y:

= -sqrt(3)(3 -sqrt(5))/4 + sqrt(3)

= (-3sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))/4 + (4sqrt(3))/4

= (sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))/4.

Therefore, the two possible points are:

C1=( (3 +sqrt(5))/4, (sqrt(3) -sqrt(15))/4 )

and

C2=( (3 -sqrt(5))/4, (sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))/4 ).

But since point C must lie on AB, which is from A=(1/2,0) to B=(0,sqrt(3)/2).

So, we need to check which of these points lie on AB.

The coordinates of AB can be parametrized as x=1/2 - t/2, y= sqrt(3)/2 - (sqrt(3)/2)t, t∈[0,1].

Thus, for point C1:

x=(3 +sqrt(5))/4 ≈(3 +2.236)/4≈5.236/4≈1.309, which is greater than 1/2≈0.5, which is outside AB.

Similarly, for C2:

x=(3 -sqrt(5))/4≈(3 -2.236)/4≈0.764/4≈0.191, which is between 0 and 0.5, so acceptable.

Similarly, y-coordinate for C2: (sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))/4≈(1.732 +3.872)/4≈5.604/4≈1.401, which is greater than sqrt(3)/2≈0.866. So, point C2 is outside AB.

Wait, but point C must lie on AB, which is between A=(0.5,0) and B=(0, sqrt(3)/2≈0.866). So, both C1 and C2 are outside AB.

Wait, but wait, in our parametrization, t is in [0,1], so x goes from 0.5 to 0, and y goes from 0 to sqrt(3)/2.

But our computed points C1 and C2 have x≈1.309 and x≈0.191, both in the range [0,0.5], but y≈1.401 and y≈0.433.

Wait, for C1: x≈1.309>0.5, which is outside AB.

For C2: x≈0.191, y≈0.433.

But point C=(0.191,0.433) lies on AB? Let's check.

From parametrization, AB: x=0.5 - t/2, y=0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t.

Set x=0.191=0.5 - t/2 ⇒ t=2*(0.5 -0.191)=2*(0.309)=0.618.

Then, y= (sqrt(3)/2)*0.618≈0.866*0.618≈0.535, but computed y≈0.433. So, not matching.

Wait, perhaps miscalculation.

Wait, let me check point C2:

c_x=(3 -sqrt(5))/4≈(3 -2.236)/4≈0.764/4≈0.191.

c_y=(sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))/4≈(1.732 +3.872)/4≈5.604/4≈1.401.

But AB's y-coordinate at x=0.191 is y= sqrt(3)/2*(1 - x/(1/2))= sqrt(3)/2*(1 - 2x)= sqrt(3)/2*(1 - 2*0.191)= sqrt(3)/2*(1 -0.382)= sqrt(3)/2*0.618≈0.866*0.618≈0.535.

Thus, point C2=(0.191,1.401) is not on AB.

Wait, but earlier, we found that when we set the quartic equation to zero, we got c_x=(3 ±sqrt(5))/4, and c_y= -sqrt(3)c_x + sqrt(3). So, unless my calculation is wrong.

Wait, let me verify:

For point C2:

c_x=(3 -sqrt(5))/4,

c_y= -sqrt(3)*(3 -sqrt(5))/4 + sqrt(3)= (-3sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))/4 + (4sqrt(3))/4= (sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))/4.

Wait, if I plug c_x into AB's equation:

From AB, y= -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3).

So, with c_x=(3 -sqrt(5))/4,

y= -sqrt(3)*(3 -sqrt(5))/4 + sqrt(3)= (-3sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))/4 + sqrt(3)= (-3sqrt(3) +sqrt(15) +4sqrt(3))/4= (sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))/4.

Thus, point C2 is indeed on AB.

But its coordinates are ( (3 -sqrt(5))/4, (sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))/4 ).

Similarly, point C1 is not on AB because x=(3 +sqrt(5))/4 >0.5.

Thus, only C2 is on AB.

Therefore, the unique point C on AB is C2=( (3 -sqrt(5))/4, (sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))/4 ).

But point C is supposed to be such that it is not on any segment PQ(t) for t≠1/2.

But earlier, we saw that point C2 is on PQ(t) for t≈0.1736 and t≈0.766, but since C2 is on AB, which is not covered by PQ(t), so it's only on PQ(t) for specific t's.

But is C2 on PQ(t) for other t's?

Wait, maybe no. Since it's on AB, and AB is only intersecting PQ(t) at C2 for specific t's.

But as per the quartic equation, only two real solutions, but only one lies on AB.

Therefore, point C is ( (3 -sqrt(5))/4, (sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))/4 ).

Thus, the coordinates are:

x=(3 -sqrt(5))/4,

y=(sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))/4.

Compute x² + y²:

x²= (9 -6sqrt(5) +5)/16= (14 -6sqrt(5))/16,

y²= ( (sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))² ) /16= (3 + 2sqrt(45) +15)/16= (18 + 6sqrt(5))/16.

Therefore,

x² + y²= (14 -6sqrt(5) +18 +6sqrt(5))/16= (32)/16=2.

Wait, that's interesting. So, x² + y²=2.

Therefore, the value of x² + y² is 2.

But wait, 2 is an integer, so m=2, n=1, so m +n=3.

But hold on, let me confirm the calculations.

Compute x=(3 -sqrt(5))/4,

so x²= (9 -6sqrt(5) +5)/16=14 -6sqrt(5))/16,

y=(sqrt(3) +sqrt(15))/4,

so y²= (3 + 2sqrt(45) +15)/16= (18 +6sqrt(5))/16.

Thus,

x² + y²= (14 -6sqrt(5) +18 +6sqrt(5))/16= (32)/16=2.

Yes, correct.

Therefore, x² + y²=2, so m=2, n=1, so m +n=3.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find a unique point \( \mathcal{C} \) on segment \( \overline{AB} \) such that \( \mathcal{C} \) is not on any segment \( \overline{PQ(t)} \) for \( t \neq \frac{1}{2} \). The segment \( \overline{PQ(t)} \) is parameterized by \( t \) and connects points \( P \) and \( Q(t) \) on the unit circle. 

1. **Parameterization of Points**:
   - Point \( P \) is parameterized as \( \left( \cos \theta, \sin \theta \right) \) where \( \theta \) is the angle from the x-axis.
   - Point \( Q(t) \) is parameterized as \( \left( 0, \sqrt{3} t \right) \).

2. **Equation of Line \( \overline{PQ(t)} \)**:
   - The slope of the line through \( P \) and \( Q(t) \) is \( -\frac{\sqrt{3} t}{\cos \theta + \sqrt{1 - t^2}} \).
   - The equation of the line is \( y = -\frac{\sqrt{3} t}{\cos \theta + \sqrt{1 - t^2}} x + \sqrt{3} t \).

3. **Intersection with \( \overline{AB} \)**:
   - The line \( \overline{PQ(t)} \) intersects \( \overline{AB} \) at point \( \mathcal{C} \). We need to find \( \mathcal{C} \) such that it is not on any other line \( \overline{PQ(t)} \) for \( t \neq \frac{1}{2} \).

4. **Finding the Unique Point \( \mathcal{C} \)**:
   - By analyzing the system of equations and solving for \( \theta \) and \( t \), we find that the point \( \mathcal{C} \) must satisfy the equation derived from the intersection of the lines and the unit circle constraint.
   - After solving the quartic equation and considering the constraints, we find that the point \( \mathcal{C} \) is \( \left( \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{15}}{4} \right) \).

5. **Calculating \( x^2 + y^2 \)**:
   - The coordinates of \( \mathcal{C} \) are \( \left( \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{15}}{4} \right) \).
   - Calculating \( x^2 + y^2 \) results in \( 2 \).

Thus, the value of \( x^2 + y^2 \) is 2, leading to \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 3 \).

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
