Question:
Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

Correct Answer:
Assume that $AC$ is the asymptote of the hyperbola, in which case $BD$ is minimized. The expression of $BD$ is $y=-\sqrt{\frac{5}{6}}x$. Thus, we could get $\frac{x^2}{20}-\frac{y^2}{24}=1\implies x^2=\frac{720}{11}$. The desired value is $4\cdot \frac{11}{6}x^2=480$. This case can't be achieved, so all $BD^2$ would be greater than $\boxed{480}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus \(ABCD\). The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi.

First, let me recall some properties of hyperbolas and rhombuses. A hyperbola has two branches, and for the standard hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\), the transverse axis is along the x-axis with length \(2a\), and the conjugate axis is along the y-axis with length \(2b\). In this case, \(a^2 = 20\) and \(b^2 = 24\), so \(a = 2\sqrt{5}\) and \(b = 2\sqrt{6}\).

A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal and diagonals that bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect the vertex angles, and they are perpendicular. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. That's a key property.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That means the diagonals are symmetric about the origin. Let me denote the diagonals as \(AC\) and \(BD\). Since the rhombus is symmetric about both diagonals, points \(A\) and \(C\) are opposite each other with respect to the origin, and same with \(B\) and \(D\).

So, if point \(A\) is \((x, y)\), then point \(C\) must be \((-x, -y)\). Similarly, if point \(B\) is \((p, q)\), then point \(D\) must be \((-p, -q)\). That's because the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Now, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, each of them must satisfy the hyperbola equation. So, substituting point \(A(x, y)\) into the hyperbola equation:

\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]

Similarly, point \(B(p, q)\) also satisfies:

\[
\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1
\]

Now, since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, the sides are equal. So, the distance from \(A\) to \(B\) should be equal to the distance from \(B\) to \(C\), and so on. But since diagonals intersect at the origin, another property of rhombus is that the diagonals are perpendicular. Therefore, the vectors \(A - O\) and \(B - O\) should be perpendicular, right?

Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, vectors \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular. Since \(AC\) is from \((x, y)\) to \((-x, -y)\), which is a vector of \((-2x, -2y)\). Similarly, \(BD\) is from \((p, q)\) to \((-p, -q)\), which is a vector of \((-2p, -2q)\). So, the diagonals are vectors \((-2x, -2y)\) and \((-2p, -2q)\). For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.

So:

\[
(-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0
\]
Simplify:

\[
4xp + 4yq = 0
\]
Divide both sides by 4:

\[
xp + yq = 0
\]

So, that's one equation relating \(x, y, p, q\). Also, since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from \(A\) to \(B\) should equal the distance from \(B\) to \(C\), and so on.

But perhaps it's easier to use the vectors approach. Since in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, and each side can be expressed in terms of the diagonals.

Wait, maybe we can use the slopes of the sides. But perhaps another way is to note that since all sides are equal, the distances between consecutive points are the same.

So, the distance between \(A(x, y)\) and \(B(p, q)\) should equal the distance between \(B(p, q)\) and \(C(-x, -y)\), right?

So, distance \(AB\) squared is:

\[
(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2
\]

Distance \(BC\) squared is:

\[
(p - (-x))^2 + (q - (-y))^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2
\]

Since \(AB = BC\), we have:

\[
(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2
\]

Expanding both sides:

Left side: \(x^2 - 2xp + p^2 + y^2 - 2yq + q^2\)

Right side: \(p^2 + 2px + x^2 + q^2 + 2qy + y^2\)

Subtracting left side from right side:

\[
(p^2 + 2px + x^2 + q^2 + 2qy + y^2) - (x^2 - 2xp + p^2 + y^2 - 2yq + q^2) = 0
\]

Simplify:

\[
2px + 2qy - (-2xp - 2yq) = 0
\]
Wait, let's compute term by term:

First term: \(p^2 - p^2 = 0\)

Second term: \(2px - (-2xp) = 2px + 2xp = 4px\)

Third term: \(x^2 - x^2 = 0\)

Fourth term: \(q^2 - q^2 = 0\)

Fifth term: \(2qy - (-2yq) = 2qy + 2qy = 4qy\)

Sixth term: \(y^2 - y^2 = 0\)

So, altogether:

\[
4px + 4qy = 0
\]
Divide both sides by 4:

\[
px + qy = 0
\]
Wait, that's the same equation as before! So, that's consistent with the diagonals being perpendicular.

So, the equation \(xp + yq = 0\) comes from both the perpendicularity of diagonals and the equality of sides. So, that's our key equation.

Now, so we have points \(A(x, y)\) and \(B(p, q)\) lying on the hyperbola, so they satisfy:

\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \quad (1)
\]
\[
\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1 \quad (2)
\]
Also, \(xp + yq = 0 \quad (3)\)

Additionally, since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distance from \(A\) to \(B\) is equal to the distance from \(B\) to \(C\), and so on. But we've already used that to get equation (3). So, perhaps we need another condition to relate \(x, y, p, q\).

Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize points on the hyperbola.

Since the hyperbola is \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), I can parametrize the points using hyperbola parametric equations.

For hyperbola, a parametrization is \(x = a \sec \theta\), \(y = b \tan \theta\), where \(a^2 = 20\), \(b^2 = 24\). So, \(x = 2\sqrt{5} \sec \theta\), \(y = 2\sqrt{6} \tan \theta\). Similarly, another point can be parametrized as \(x = 2\sqrt{5} \sec \phi\), \(y = 2\sqrt{6} \tan \phi\).

Alternatively, since points are symmetric, maybe I can use a different parametrization.

Wait, but in the hyperbola, unlike the ellipse, the parametrization with angle doesn't directly give the point, but parametrization with hyperbolic functions is also possible. But maybe it's more straightforward to use coordinates.

Alternatively, let's consider that points \(A\) and \(B\) can be represented as \((x, y)\) and \((p, q)\), with the conditions above.

So, we have three equations:

1. \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\)

2. \(\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1\)

3. \(xp + yq = 0\)

We need another equation to relate these variables. Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal, so distance from \(A\) to \(B\) is equal to distance from \(B\) to \(C\), which we already used, leading to the same equation. So, perhaps we need to express the condition that the sides are equal, or perhaps use the fact that the sides are equal in another way.

Wait, maybe the slopes of the sides can be related? Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, the vectors \(AB\) and \(AD\) should be equal in magnitude and perpendicular? No, actually, in a rhombus, adjacent sides are equal and the diagonals bisect the angles. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps instead of dealing with coordinates, I can think in terms of vectors. Let me denote vectors \( \vec{OA} = \vec{a} \), \( \vec{OB} = \vec{b} \). Then since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, \( \vec{AB} = \vec{BC} = \vec{CD} = \vec{DA} \). Wait, no, in a rhombus, all sides are equal vectors, but in this case, since it's a rhombus, the vectors representing the sides should have the same magnitude but different directions.

Wait, maybe it's getting too abstract. Let me try to think differently.

Since diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is \(-1\). So, if the slope of diagonal \(AC\) is \(m\), then the slope of diagonal \(BD\) is \(-1/m\).

But wait, in our case, the diagonals are \(AC\) and \(BD\), and they intersect at the origin. The slope of \(AC\) is \((y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x\). Similarly, the slope of \(BD\) is \((q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p\). Since they are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be \(-1\):

\[
\left( \frac{y}{x} \right) \left( \frac{q}{p} \right) = -1
\]
Simplify:

\[
\frac{yq}{xp} = -1
\]
Which implies:

\[
yq = -xp
\]
Wait, that's the same as equation (3): \(xp + yq = 0\). So, that's consistent. So, this gives no new information.

So, I still have three equations:

1. \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\)
2. \(\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1\)
3. \(xp + yq = 0\)

I need another equation. Maybe the fact that all sides are equal, so the distance from \(A\) to \(B\) is equal to the distance from \(B\) to \(C\), but we already used that leading to equation (3). Hmm.

Wait, maybe we can parametrize points \(A\) and \(B\) in terms of a parameter and then express the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the rhombus as being formed by two pairs of points on the hyperbola, with the diagonals as axes.

Wait, another thought: since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin, so the diagonals must be the major and minor axes of the hyperbola. Wait, but the hyperbola doesn't have minor axes; it has transverse and conjugate axes.

Wait, in hyperbola terminology, the transverse axis is the one that passes through the vertices, and the conjugate axis is perpendicular to it. So, perhaps if the diagonals of the rhombus lie along the transverse and conjugate axes, then the rhombus is actually a rectangle? Wait, but in a hyperbola, the only rectangle that can be inscribed is with sides parallel to the axes, but in that case, the diagonals would be the transverse and conjugate axes. But in our case, the diagonals are perpendicular, but since it's a rhombus, the sides are equal.

Wait, maybe not necessarily lying on the axes. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can consider the slopes of the sides of the rhombus. Since all sides are equal, the sides must have the same length, but different directions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the properties of the hyperbola. For any point on the hyperbola, the difference of distances to the foci is constant. But wait, in this case, we're dealing with a hyperbola, so maybe that can be used, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe using coordinates is the way to go.

Let me denote point \(A\) as \((x, y)\), then point \(C\) is \((-x, -y)\). Similarly, point \(B\) is \((p, q)\), point \(D\) is \((-p, -q)\). Now, the diagonals are \(AC\) and \(BD\), which are perpendicular, so as we saw earlier, \(xp + yq = 0\).

Now, since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, the distance from \(A\) to \(B\) should equal the distance from \(B\) to \(C\). So, let's compute that distance squared.

Distance squared from \(A\) to \(B\): \((x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2\)

Distance squared from \(B\) to \(C\): \((p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2\)

Set them equal:

\[
(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2
\]

Expanding both sides:

Left: \(x^2 - 2xp + p^2 + y^2 - 2yq + q^2\)

Right: \(p^2 + 2px + x^2 + q^2 + 2qy + y^2\)

Subtract left from right:

\[
(p^2 + 2px + x^2 + q^2 + 2qy + y^2) - (x^2 - 2xp + p^2 + y^2 - 2yq + q^2) = 0
\]

Simplify:

\[
2px + 2qy - (-2xp - 2yq) = 0
\]
Wait, that seems off. Wait, actually, the subtraction should be term by term.

Wait, let me expand both sides again:

Left: \(x^2 - 2xp + p^2 + y^2 - 2yq + q^2\)

Right: \(p^2 + 2px + x^2 + q^2 + 2qy + y^2\)

Subtracting left from right:

Right - Left = (p^2 + 2px + x^2 + q^2 + 2qy + y^2) - (x^2 - 2xp + p^2 + y^2 - 2yq + q^2)

Simplify term by term:

p^2 - p^2 = 0

2px - (-2xp) = 2px + 2xp = 4px

x^2 - x^2 = 0

q^2 - q^2 = 0

2qy - (-2yq) = 2qy + 2qy = 4qy

y^2 - y^2 = 0

So overall:

4px + 4qy = 0

Divide by 4:

px + qy = 0

Which is the same as equation (3). So, that just confirms our earlier result. So, we don't get any new information from setting \(AB = BC\). So, maybe I need another condition.

Perhaps consider the fact that all four points lie on the hyperbola, so points \(A\) and \(B\) must satisfy the hyperbola equation, and with the condition \(xp + yq = 0\), we can set up a system of equations.

Let me see.

From equation (3): \(xp + yq = 0\). So, we can write \(xp = -yq\). Let's square both sides:

\((xp)^2 = (yq)^2\)

So, \(x^2 p^2 = y^2 q^2\)

Now, from equation (1): \(x^2 / 20 - y^2 / 24 = 1\), so \(x^2 = 20(1 + y^2 / 24)\). Similarly, equation (2): \(p^2 / 20 - q^2 / 24 = 1\), so \(p^2 = 20(1 + q^2 / 24)\).

Substitute these into \(x^2 p^2 = y^2 q^2\):

\[
[20(1 + y^2 / 24)][20(1 + q^2 / 24)] = y^2 q^2
\]

Simplify:

\[
400(1 + y^2 / 24)(1 + q^2 / 24) = y^2 q^2
\]

Let me denote \(S = y^2\) and \(T = q^2\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
400(1 + S/24)(1 + T/24) = S T
\]

Let me expand the left side:

\[
400 \left[1 + S/24 + T/24 + (S T)/(24 \times 24)\right] = S T
\]

Simplify each term:

First term: 400 × 1 = 400

Second term: 400 × (S/24) = (400 / 24) S = (50 / 3) S

Third term: 400 × (T/24) = (50 / 3) T

Fourth term: 400 × (S T)/(24 × 24) = (400 / 576) S T = (25 / 36) S T

So, the equation becomes:

\[
400 + \frac{50}{3} S + \frac{50}{3} T + \frac{25}{36} S T = S T
\]

Bring all terms to one side:

\[
400 + \frac{50}{3} S + \frac{50}{3} T + \frac{25}{36} S T - S T = 0
\]

Simplify the last two terms:

\[
\frac{25}{36} S T - S T = -\frac{11}{36} S T
\]

So, equation is:

\[
400 + \frac{50}{3} S + \frac{50}{3} T - \frac{11}{36} S T = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by 36 to eliminate denominators:

\[
400 \times 36 + 50 \times 12 S + 50 \times 12 T - 11 S T = 0
\]

Calculate each term:

400 × 36 = 14400

50 × 12 = 600, so 600 S + 600 T

-11 S T

So, equation becomes:

\[
14400 + 600 S + 600 T - 11 S T = 0
\]

Let me rewrite this:

\[
-11 S T + 600 S + 600 T + 14400 = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[
11 S T - 600 S - 600 T - 14400 = 0
\]

Hmm, this looks complicated. Maybe factor terms.

Let me try to factor this equation:

11 S T - 600 S - 600 T - 14400 = 0

Let me group terms:

(11 S T - 600 S) - (600 T + 14400) = 0

Factor S from first group and 600 from second group:

S (11 T - 600) - 600 (T + 24) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe factor differently.

Alternatively, let's consider variables substitution. Let me set \(u = S = y^2\) and \(v = T = q^2\). Then the equation is:

11 u v - 600 u - 600 v - 14400 = 0

Let me rearrange:

11 u v - 600 u - 600 v = 14400

Add 600^2 / 11 to both sides to complete the rectangle.

Wait, maybe factor:

11 u v - 600 u - 600 v = 14400

Factor terms:

11 u v - 600 u - 600 v = 14400

Let me factor out 11 from the first term:

11 (u v) - 600 u - 600 v = 14400

Hmm, perhaps this is a quadratic in terms of u or v.

Alternatively, let's write it as:

11 u v - 600 u - 600 v = 14400

Let me factor:

(11 u - 600)(v - something) = something.

Wait, let me try:

11 u v - 600 u - 600 v = 14400

Let me add 600^2 / 11 to both sides to complete the rectangle.

So, 11 u v - 600 u - 600 v + (600^2)/11 = 14400 + (600^2)/11

Then, factor the left side:

(11 u - 600)(v - 600/11) = 14400 + (600^2)/11

Wait, let me compute:

Left side:

11 u v - 600 u - (600/11) v + (600^2)/121

But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Let me denote \(u = y^2\), \(v = q^2\). Then, from equation (1):

\(u = 20(1 + v / 24)\)

Because from equation (1):

\(x^2 = 20(1 + y^2 / 24)\), but \(x^2 = S = u\), and \(y^2 = v\). Wait, no, wait:

Wait, equation (1): \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), so \(x^2 = 20(1 + y^2 / 24)\). So, \(x^2 = 20 + (20 / 24) y^2 = 20 + (5/6) y^2\).

Similarly, equation (2): \(p^2 = 20(1 + q^2 / 24)\). So, \(p^2 = 20 + (5/6) q^2\).

But, from equation (3): \(x p + y q = 0\). So, \(x p = - y q\). So, \(x^2 p^2 = y^2 q^2\).

But \(x^2 = 20 + (5/6) y^2\), and \(p^2 = 20 + (5/6) q^2\).

Thus, \(x^2 p^2 = [20 + (5/6) y^2][20 + (5/6) q^2] = y^2 q^2\)

So, expanding the left side:

20*20 + 20*(5/6) q^2 + 20*(5/6) y^2 + (5/6)^2 y^2 q^2 = y^2 q^2

Compute each term:

20*20 = 400

20*(5/6) q^2 = (100/6) q^2 = (50/3) q^2

20*(5/6) y^2 = (50/3) y^2

(5/6)^2 y^2 q^2 = (25/36) y^2 q^2

So, equation becomes:

400 + (50/3) q^2 + (50/3) y^2 + (25/36) y^2 q^2 = y^2 q^2

Bring all terms to the left:

400 + (50/3) q^2 + (50/3) y^2 + (25/36) y^2 q^2 - y^2 q^2 = 0

Combine like terms:

400 + (50/3)(q^2 + y^2) + (25/36 - 1) y^2 q^2 = 0

Compute (25/36 - 1):

25/36 - 36/36 = (-11)/36

So:

400 + (50/3)(q^2 + y^2) - (11/36) y^2 q^2 = 0

Multiply through by 36 to eliminate denominators:

400*36 + 50/3 * 36 (q^2 + y^2) - 11 y^2 q^2 = 0

Calculate each term:

400*36 = 14,400

50/3 * 36 = 50*12 = 600

Thus:

14,400 + 600(q^2 + y^2) - 11 y^2 q^2 = 0

Which is the same as:

14,400 + 600(q^2 + y^2) - 11 y^2 q^2 = 0

Which is similar to the earlier equation. So, this seems to lead us in circles.

Perhaps, instead of trying to solve for \(u\) and \(v\), we can consider that in the hyperbola, the points \(A\) and \(B\) can be parameterized in terms of angles or some other parameter, and then express the condition \(xp + yq = 0\) in terms of that parameter.

Let me try parametrizing point \(A\) as \((2\sqrt{5} \sec \theta, 2\sqrt{6} \tan \theta)\). Then, point \(C\) is \((-2\sqrt{5} \sec \theta, -2\sqrt{6} \tan \theta)\). Similarly, point \(B\) can be parameterized as \((2\sqrt{5} \sec \phi, 2\sqrt{6} \tan \phi)\), so point \(D\) is \((-2\sqrt{5} \sec \phi, -2\sqrt{6} \tan \phi)\).

Now, the condition \(xp + yq = 0\) translates to:

\( (2\sqrt{5} \sec \theta)(2\sqrt{5} \sec \phi) + (2\sqrt{6} \tan \theta)(2\sqrt{6} \tan \phi) = 0 \)

Compute each term:

First term: \( (2\sqrt{5})(2\sqrt{5}) \sec \theta \sec \phi = 4*5 \sec \theta \sec \phi = 20 \sec \theta \sec \phi \)

Second term: \( (2\sqrt{6})(2\sqrt{6}) \tan \theta \tan \phi = 4*6 \tan \theta \tan \phi = 24 \tan \theta \tan \phi \)

So, the equation becomes:

\[
20 \sec \theta \sec \phi + 24 \tan \theta \tan \phi = 0
\]

Let me write this as:

\[
20 \sec \theta \sec \phi = -24 \tan \theta \tan \phi
\]

Divide both sides by \(\cos \theta \cos \phi\) (since \(\sec \theta = 1/\cos \theta\), \(\sec \phi = 1/\cos \phi\), and \(\tan \theta = \sin \theta / \cos \theta\), same for \(\phi\)):

\[
20 = -24 \frac{\sin \theta \sin \phi}{\cos \theta \cos \phi}
\]
Simplify:

\[
20 = -24 \tan \theta \tan \phi
\]
So,

\[
\tan \theta \tan \phi = - \frac{20}{24} = - \frac{5}{6}
\]

So, \(\tan \theta \tan \phi = -5/6\). Let me denote \(t = \tan \theta\) and \(s = \tan \phi\), so \(t s = -5/6\).

Now, we need to find \(BD^2\). Since \(B\) is \((2\sqrt{5} \sec \phi, 2\sqrt{6} \tan \phi)\) and \(D\) is \((-2\sqrt{5} \sec \phi, -2\sqrt{6} \tan \phi)\), so the distance squared between \(B\) and \(D\) is:

\[
(2\sqrt{5} \sec \phi - (-2\sqrt{5} \sec \phi))^2 + (2\sqrt{6} \tan \phi - (-2\sqrt{6} \tan \phi))^2
\]

Simplify:

\[
(4\sqrt{5} \sec \phi)^2 + (4\sqrt{6} \tan \phi)^2
\]
Which is:

\[
16*5 \sec^2 \phi + 16*6 \tan^2 \phi
\]
Simplify:

\[
80 \sec^2 \phi + 96 \tan^2 \phi
\]

We can express this in terms of \(s = \tan \phi\), since \(s = \tan \phi\), and \(\sec^2 \phi = 1 + \tan^2 \phi = 1 + s^2\).

So, substituting:

\[
80(1 + s^2) + 96 s^2 = 80 + 80 s^2 + 96 s^2 = 80 + 176 s^2
\]

So, \(BD^2 = 80 + 176 s^2\). Our goal is to find the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum of \(BD^2\), but the question says "the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\)" for all such rhombi. So, it's the infimum of \(BD^2\), which would be the minimum possible value of \(BD^2\). So, if we can find the minimum of \(BD^2\), then the greatest number less than all \(BD^2\) is just the infimum, which is the minimum.

Wait, but if \(BD^2\) can take on a minimum value, then the greatest real number less than all \(BD^2\) would be the infimum, which is that minimum. So, we need to find the minimum possible value of \(BD^2\).

So, \(BD^2 = 80 + 176 s^2\). So, to minimize \(BD^2\), we need to minimize \(s^2\), since 176 is positive. So, the minimum occurs when \(s^2\) is as small as possible.

But \(s = \tan \phi\), so \(s\) can be any real number except where \(\cos \phi = 0\). However, from the condition \(t s = -5/6\), if \(s\) approaches 0, then \(t\) approaches infinity or negative infinity, but \(t\) is \(\tan \theta\), so that's possible. But does it lead to a feasible point on the hyperbola?

Wait, but let's think about the constraints. Since \(s = \tan \phi\), and \(s\) can be any real number, but in our parametrization, \(s\) is related to \(t\) via \(t s = -5/6\). So, \(t = -5/(6 s)\).

But \(t = \tan \theta\), so \(\tan \theta\) can be expressed in terms of \(s\). However, since both \(s\) and \(t\) are real numbers, as long as \(s \neq 0\), \(t\) is defined.

But we need to ensure that point \(A\) is on the hyperbola, which it is by construction. So, the hyperbola is defined for all real \(t\), so as long as \(s\) is real and non-zero, we have a valid point \(A\).

So, \(BD^2 = 80 + 176 s^2\). So, as \(s^2\) can be made arbitrarily small (approaching zero), \(BD^2\) can approach 80. However, is there a lower bound on \(s^2\)? Let me see.

Wait, but \(s^2\) is squared, so it's always non-negative. The minimal value occurs when \(s = 0\), but if \(s = 0\), then \(t s = -5/6\) implies \(0 = -5/6\), which is impossible. So, \(s\) cannot be zero. Therefore, \(s^2\) must be greater than some minimal positive value.

So, let's express \(BD^2 = 80 + 176 s^2\), and we need to find the minimal possible \(BD^2\). To find the minimal \(BD^2\), we can consider the relationship \(t s = -5/6\), and express \(BD^2\) in terms of a single variable.

Let me express \(t = -5/(6 s)\). Since \(t = \tan \theta\) and \(s = \tan \phi\), and in our parametrization, \(A\) is \((2\sqrt{5} \sec \theta, 2\sqrt{6} \tan \theta)\), which requires that \(\theta\) is not \(\pi/2\) or \(-\pi/2\), so \(\sec \theta\) is defined.

But perhaps I can express \(BD^2\) in terms of \(s\) and find the minimum.

Given \(BD^2 = 80 + 176 s^2\), and \(t s = -5/6\), but \(t = \tan \theta\), which is related to point \(A\) on the hyperbola.

But since \(t\) is expressed in terms of \(s\), perhaps I can find a relationship.

Wait, perhaps I need to express \(BD^2\) in terms of \(s\) and then minimize it.

Alternatively, since \(BD^2 = 80 + 176 s^2\), and we need to find the minimal value, perhaps we can express \(s^2\) in terms of \(t^2\) using \(t s = -5/6\), so \(s^2 = 25/(36 t^2)\). Then, substitute into \(BD^2\):

\[
BD^2 = 80 + 176 \times \frac{25}{36 t^2}
\]
Simplify:

\[
BD^2 = 80 + \frac{4400}{36 t^2} = 80 + \frac{1100}{9 t^2}
\]

Now, \(t\) is \(\tan \theta\), which can be any real number except zero, since \(s = \tan \phi\) cannot be zero. So, \(t\) can be any real number except zero, so \(t^2\) is positive, and can approach zero or infinity.

Wait, but \(BD^2\) is expressed as \(80 + \frac{1100}{9 t^2}\). So, as \(t^2\) approaches infinity, \(BD^2\) approaches 80. As \(t^2\) approaches zero, \(BD^2\) approaches infinity.

Therefore, the minimal value of \(BD^2\) is 80, but it's approached as \(t^2\) approaches infinity, which would make \(s^2\) approach zero, but \(s^2\) cannot be zero because then \(t s = -5/6\) would require \(t\) to be undefined.

Therefore, the infimum of \(BD^2\) is 80, but it's not attainable since \(s^2\) can't be zero. So, \(BD^2\) can get arbitrarily close to 80 but never actually reach it.

Hence, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is 80.

Wait, but let me verify if my reasoning is correct. Since \(BD^2 = 80 + 176 s^2\), and \(s^2\) can be made arbitrarily small, \(BD^2\) can approach 80 from above. So, 80 is the infimum, which is the greatest lower bound. Therefore, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi is 80.

But wait, let me think again. If \(BD^2\) can get as close to 80 as we want, but never actually reaches 80, then 80 is the infimum. So, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi would be 80, because it's the supremum of all lower bounds.

Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{80}\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{80}
</think>

Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi \(ABCD\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin.

1. **Hyperbola Properties**: The hyperbola has \(a^2 = 20\) and \(b^2 = 24\). Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on this hyperbola and form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

2. **Parametrization**: Points \(A\) and \(B\) can be parameterized as \((2\sqrt{5} \sec \theta, 2\sqrt{6} \tan \theta)\) and \((2\sqrt{5} \sec \phi, 2\sqrt{6} \tan \phi)\) respectively. Their coordinates satisfy the hyperbola equation and the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular.

3. **Perpendicular Diagonals**: The condition \(xp + yq = 0\) translates to \(\tan \theta \tan \phi = -\frac{5}{6}\).

4. **Distance Calculation**: The distance squared \(BD^2\) is calculated as:
   \[
   BD^2 = 80 + 176 s^2
   \]
   where \(s = \tan \phi\).

5. **Minimizing \(BD^2\)**: To find the minimum value of \(BD^2\), we note that \(s^2\) can be made arbitrarily small but cannot be zero. The expression \(BD^2 = 80 + 176 s^2\) approaches 80 as \(s^2\) approaches zero.

6. **Conclusion**: The infimum of \(BD^2\) is 80, which is the greatest lower bound. Therefore, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is 80.

The final answer is \(\boxed{80}\).
