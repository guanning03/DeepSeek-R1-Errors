Question:
Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

Correct Answer:
We use the formula for the volume of an isosceles tetrahedron. $V = \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)/72}$.
Note that all faces have equal area due to equal side lengths. By the Law of Cosines, we find \[\cos{\angle ACB} = \frac{80 + 89 - 41}{2\sqrt{80\cdot 89}} = \frac{16}{\sqrt{445}}.\].
From this, we find \[\sin{\angle ACB} = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2{\angle ACB}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{256}{445}} = \sqrt{\frac{189}{445}}\] and can find the area of $\triangle ABC$ as \[A = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{89\cdot 80}\cdot \sin{\angle ACB} = 6\sqrt{21}.\]
Let $R$ be the distance we want to find. By taking the sum of (equal) volumes \[ [ABCI] + [ABDI] + [ACDI] + [BCDI] = V,\] we have \[V = \frac{4AR}{3}.\] Plugging in and simplifying, we get $R = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}$ for an answer of $20 + 21 + 63 = \boxed{104}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter to each face. The incenter is the point inside the tetrahedron that's equidistant from all four faces. The answer needs to be in a specific form, and then I have to find the sum m + n + p where the distance is m√n/p.

First, let me recall some properties of a tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and an incenter exists only if the tetrahedron is isohedral, meaning all faces are congruent, but I don't think that's necessarily the case here. Wait, actually, in a general tetrahedron, the incenter doesn't always exist unless all the face areas are equal and the tetrahedron is isohedral. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should check that.

Wait, actually, an incenter in a tetrahedron is the point where the four internal angle bisectors meet, and it's equidistant from all four faces. The existence of such a point isn't guaranteed unless the tetrahedron is isohedral or at least has some symmetry. In this problem, the edges are given in pairs: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, and BC=AD=√89. So, it seems like the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way, which might imply the existence of an incenter.

So, perhaps this tetrahedron is called a "disphemoid" or something like that? A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which seems to be the case here. So, ABCD is a disphenoid. In a disphenoid, there exists an incenter, so that must be the point I mentioned earlier.

Now, to find the distance from the incenter to each face. This distance is similar to the inradius in a three-dimensional context. In a triangle, the inradius is the radius of the incircle, tangent to all three sides, and it can be found by the formula r = A/s, where A is the area, and s is the semiperimeter.

But in a tetrahedron, the analogous concept is the inradius, which is the distance from the incenter to each face. The formula for the inradius is similar: r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area (the sum of the areas of all four faces). So, if I can find the volume V and the total surface area S, then I can compute r.

So, my plan is:

1. Compute the areas of all four faces.
2. Sum them to get the total surface area S.
3. Compute the volume V of the tetrahedron.
4. Use the formula r = 3V / S to find the inradius.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, let's note the edge lengths:

AB = CD = √41

AC = BD = √80

BC = AD = √89

So, each pair of opposite edges is equal. That's characteristic of a disphenoid.

Now, since all opposite edges are equal, the faces come in congruent pairs. Let's see:

Faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.

Wait, wait, actually, in a tetrahedron, each face is a triangle. So, let's see:

- Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC
- Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD
- Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD
- Face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD

Wait, actually, let me write down the edges for each face:

Face ABC: AB = √41, BC = √89, AC = √80

Face ABD: AB = √41, BD = √80, AD = √89

Face ACD: AC = √80, CD = √41, AD = √89

Face BCD: BC = √89, CD = √41, BD = √80

So, each face has edges of lengths √41, √80, √89. Thus, all four faces are congruent triangles. That simplifies things because if all faces are congruent, then the total surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.

So, let's compute the area of one face first. Let's take triangle ABC with sides √41, √89, √80.

To find the area of triangle ABC, we can use Heron's formula.

Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semiperimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.

Let me compute s for triangle ABC:

s = (√41 + √89 + √80)/2

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's see.

Wait, maybe instead of working with radicals, I can assign variable names to the sides to make it easier.

Let me denote:

a = √41, b = √89, c = √80.

Then, s = (a + b + c)/2

But perhaps squaring the sides will help? Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors or coordinates to compute the area. Since all faces are congruent, maybe it's easier to assign coordinates to the vertices and compute the volume.

Wait, perhaps I can first compute the area of one face.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the volume first using the formula for a disphenoid. I recall that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt[(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 - b^2 + c^2)(-a^2 + b^2 + c^2)] ) / (6*sqrt(2))

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall. In a disphenoid, since opposite edges are equal, the volume can be expressed in terms of the edges.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Yes, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a way to compute the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths. Let me try that.

The formula is:

V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 )

Where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   AB² AC² AD² |
| 1  AB² 0   BC² BD² |
| 1  AC² BC² 0   CD² |
| 1  AD² BD² CD² 0   |

So, let me set up this determinant.

First, label the points as A, B, C, D.

Given:

AB = √41 ⇒ AB² = 41

AC = √80 ⇒ AC² = 80

AD = √89 ⇒ AD² = 89

BC = √89 ⇒ BC² = 89

BD = √80 ⇒ BD² = 80

CD = √41 ⇒ CD² = 41

So, plugging into the Cayley-Menger determinant:

CM = determinant of the following matrix:

[ [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 41, 80, 89],
  [1, 41, 0, 89, 80],
  [1, 80, 89, 0, 41],
  [1, 89, 80, 41, 0] ]

So, this is a 5x5 determinant, which is a bit tedious, but manageable.

Let me denote the matrix as M:

M = [
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],
[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],
[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],
[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]
]

I need to compute det(M). Hmm, that's a lot of computation, but maybe there's a pattern.

Looking at the matrix, it's symmetric. The first row is [0,1,1,1,1], and each subsequent row is a permutation of the others.

In fact, the second row is [1,0,41,80,89], the third is [1,41,0,89,80], the fourth is [1,80,89,0,41], and the fifth is [1,89,80,41,0].

So, each row after the first is a cyclic permutation of the previous one. That might help.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute this determinant by expanding along the first row.

The determinant of M is:

0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)

But since the first element is 0, that term drops out.

So,

det(M) = -1 * det(M12) + 1 * det(M13) - 1 * det(M14) + 1 * det(M15)

Where M1j is the minor matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column j.

So, let's compute each minor:

First, M12 is the matrix:

[
[1, 1, 1, 1],
[41, 0, 80, 89],
[80, 89, 0, 41],
[89, 80, 41, 0]
]

Similarly, M13 is:

[
[1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 89, 80],
[1, 89, 0, 41],
[1, 80, 41, 0]
]

Wait, hold on, actually, when removing column j, the remaining columns are columns 1,3,4,5 for minor M12 (since column 2 is removed). Similarly, for M13, we remove column 3, so the remaining columns are 1,2,4,5.

Wait, perhaps I should better write down the minors properly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that due to the symmetry of the matrix, all minors M1j for j=2,3,4,5 are similar, just permuted.

Looking at M12, it's the determinant of:

Row 2: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89] without column 2: [1, 1, 1, 1], [41, 0, 80, 89], [80, 89, 0, 41], [89, 80, 41, 0]

Wait, no, actually, M12 is:

After removing row 1 and column 2, the remaining matrix is:

Row 2: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 3: [1, 0, 80, 89]

Row 4: [1, 89, 0, 41]

Row 5: [1, 80, 41, 0]

Wait, hold on, no:

Wait, the original matrix is:

Row 1: [0,1,1,1,1]

Row 2: [1,0,41,80,89]

Row 3: [1,41,0,89,80]

Row 4: [1,80,89,0,41]

Row 5: [1,89,80,41,0]

So, M12 is obtained by removing row 1 and column 2:

So, columns left: 1,3,4,5.

So, M12 is:

Row 2: [1,41,80,89]

Row 3: [1,0,89,80]

Row 4: [1,89,0,41]

Row 5: [1,80,41,0]

Similarly, M13 is obtained by removing column 3:

Columns left: 1,2,4,5.

So, M13 is:

Row 2: [1,0,80,89]

Row 3: [1,41,89,80]

Row 4: [1,80,0,41]

Row 5: [1,89,41,0]

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe instead of computing each minor, which seems time-consuming, perhaps I can use properties of the disphenoid.

Wait, in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 - b^2 + c^2)(-a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ) / 8

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe an alternative formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in a disphenoid, the volume is sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 - b^2 + c^2)(-a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ) / (6*sqrt(2))

Wait, let me check.

Wait, no, that formula is for a different kind of tetrahedron.

Alternatively, perhaps since all four faces are congruent triangles, I can compute the area of one face and then find the height of the tetrahedron relative to that face, and then compute the volume as (1/3)*base_area*height.

Since all four faces are congruent, I can pick any face as the base.

So, let's compute the area of triangle ABC first.

Using Heron's formula:

s = (a + b + c)/2 = (√41 + √89 + √80)/2

But dealing with radicals is messy, so perhaps I can compute s squared.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.

Wait, maybe assigning coordinates to the points.

Since all edges are given, perhaps I can place the points in 3D space such that calculations are easier.

Let me try that.

Let me place point A at (0,0,0). Then, let me place point B at (x, 0, 0), so that AB = √41, so x = √41.

So, coordinates:

A: (0, 0, 0)

B: (√41, 0, 0)

Now, point C is somewhere in the plane. Let me denote its coordinates as (p, q, 0). Then, distances AC and BC are given.

AC = √80: distance from A(0,0,0) to C(p, q, 0) is sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = √80 ⇒ p^2 + q^2 = 80

BC = √89: distance from B(√41, 0, 0) to C(p, q, 0) is sqrt( (p - √41)^2 + q^2 ) = √89 ⇒ (p - √41)^2 + q^2 = 89

So, we have two equations:

1. p² + q² = 80

2. (p - √41)² + q² = 89

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

(p - √41)² + q² - p² - q² = 89 - 80 ⇒ (p² - 2p√41 + 41) - p² = 9 ⇒ -2p√41 + 41 = 9 ⇒ -2p√41 = -32 ⇒ 2p√41 = 32 ⇒ p√41 = 16 ⇒ p = 16 / √41

Rationalizing the denominator: p = (16√41)/41

Then, substitute p back into equation 1:

p² + q² = 80 ⇒ (256 * 41)/ (41²) + q² = 80 ⇒ (256)/41 + q² = 80 ⇒ q² = 80 - 256/41 = (80 * 41)/41 - 256/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41

Thus, q = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)

Simplify sqrt(3024):

3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7

So sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12√21

Therefore, q = 12√21 / √41 = (12√(21*41)) / 41

So, point C is at (16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0)

Wait, hold on, 21*41 is 861, yes.

So, coordinates:

C: (16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0)

Now, let's find coordinates for point D. Since the tetrahedron is symmetric, and given the edge lengths, point D should be placed symmetrically with respect to points A, B, and C.

Given that AD = √89, BD = √80, CD = √41.

So, let me denote point D as (r, s, t). Since it's a tetrahedron, t ≠ 0.

We need to solve for r, s, t such that:

AD = √89: sqrt(r² + s² + t²) = √89 ⇒ r² + s² + t² = 89

BD = √80: sqrt( (r - √41)^2 + s² + t² ) = √80 ⇒ (r - √41)^2 + s² + t² = 80

CD = √41: sqrt( (r - 16√41/41)^2 + (s - 12√861/41)^2 + t² ) = √41 ⇒ (r - 16√41/41)^2 + (s - 12√861/41)^2 + t² = 41

So, we have three equations:

1. r² + s² + t² = 89

2. (r - √41)^2 + s² + t² = 80

3. (r - 16√41/41)^2 + (s - 12√861/41)^2 + t² = 41

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

Equation 1 - Equation 2:

r² + s² + t² - [ (r - √41)^2 + s² + t² ] = 89 - 80 ⇒

r² - (r² - 2r√41 + 41) = 9 ⇒

r² - r² + 2r√41 - 41 = 9 ⇒

2r√41 = 50 ⇒

r√41 = 25 ⇒

r = 25 / √41 ⇒ r = 25√41 / 41

So, r = 25√41 / 41

Now, plug r into equation 1 and 2:

From equation 1: r² + s² + t² = 89

Compute r²:

(25√41 / 41)^2 = (625 * 41) / (1681) = 625 / 41 ≈ 15.229... Wait, let me compute 25² = 625, so 625 * 41 / (41²) = 625 / 41

So, r² = 625 / 41

Thus, equation 1 becomes:

625 / 41 + s² + t² = 89 ⇒ s² + t² = 89 - 625 / 41

Compute 89 as 89 * 41 / 41 = 3649 / 41

So, s² + t² = (3649 - 625)/41 = 3024 / 41

Similarly, equation 2 is already used to find r.

Now, equation 3:

( r - 16√41/41 )² + ( s - 12√861/41 )² + t² = 41

We can plug in r = 25√41 / 41, so:

(25√41 / 41 - 16√41 / 41)² + (s - 12√861 / 41)^2 + t² = 41

Simplify the first term:

( (25√41 - 16√41) / 41 )² = (9√41 / 41)^2 = (81 * 41) / (1681) = 81 / 41

So, first term is 81 / 41.

Thus, equation 3 becomes:

81 / 41 + (s - 12√861 / 41)^2 + t² = 41

From equation 1, we know that s² + t² = 3024 / 41

So, let's write:

81 / 41 + (s - 12√861 / 41)^2 + t² = 41

But s² + t² = 3024 / 41, so replace t² with 3024 / 41 - s²:

81 / 41 + (s - 12√861 / 41)^2 + (3024 / 41 - s²) = 41

Simplify:

81 / 41 + (s² - 2 * s * 12√861 / 41 + (12√861 / 41)^2 ) + 3024 / 41 - s² = 41

Simplify term by term:

81/41 + s² - (24√861 / 41)s + (144 * 861) / (41²) + 3024 / 41 - s² = 41

Notice that s² and -s² cancel out:

81/41 - (24√861 / 41)s + (144 * 861)/1681 + 3024 / 41 = 41

Combine constants:

81/41 + 3024/41 + (144 * 861)/1681 - (24√861 / 41)s = 41

Compute 81 + 3024 = 3105, so 3105 / 41 = 75.731... Wait, better to keep as fractions.

3105 / 41 + (144 * 861)/1681 - (24√861 / 41)s = 41

Compute (144 * 861)/1681:

First, note that 1681 is 41², so 1681 = 41*41.

Compute 144 * 861:

144 * 861 = Let's compute 100*861=86100, 40*861=34440, 4*861=3444. So total: 86100 + 34440 = 120540 + 3444 = 123,984

So, 123,984 / 1681.

Simplify 123,984 ÷ 41: 123,984 ÷ 41.

Compute 41 * 3000 = 123,000. 123,984 - 123,000 = 984. 984 ÷ 41 = 24. So, 123,984 / 41 = 3000 + 24 = 3024.

Therefore, 123,984 / 1681 = 3024 / 41.

So, we have:

3105 / 41 + 3024 / 41 - (24√861 / 41)s = 41

Combine the first two terms:

(3105 + 3024) / 41 - (24√861 / 41)s = 41 ⇒

6129 / 41 - (24√861 / 41)s = 41

Compute 6129 / 41:

41 * 150 = 6150, which is 21 more than 6129, so 6129 /41 = 150 - 21/41 = 150 - 21/41.

So, 150 - 21/41 - (24√861 / 41)s = 41

Bring 150 - 21/41 to the other side:

- (24√861 / 41)s = 41 - 150 + 21/41 ⇒

- (24√861 / 41)s = (-109) + 21/41 ⇒

Convert -109 to over 41: -109 = -109 * 41 / 41 = -4469 / 41

So,

- (24√861 / 41)s = (-4469 / 41 + 21 / 41) ⇒

- (24√861 / 41)s = (-4448 / 41)

Multiply both sides by -41:

24√861 s = 4448

Thus,

s = 4448 / (24√861) = Simplify numerator and denominator.

Divide numerator and denominator by 8:

4448 ÷8 = 556

24 ÷8=3

So,

s = 556 / (3√861)

Rationalize denominator:

s = 556√861 / (3 * 861 ) = 556√861 / 2583

Simplify 556 and 2583:

Find GCD(556, 2583). 2583 ÷556=4 with remainder 359.

556 ÷359=1 with remainder 197

359 ÷197=1 with remainder 162

197 ÷162=1 with remainder 35

162 ÷35=4 with remainder 22

35 ÷22=1 with remainder 13

22 ÷13=1 with remainder 9

13 ÷9=1 with remainder 4

9 ÷4=2 with remainder 1

4 ÷1=4 with remainder 0

Thus, GCD is 1.

So, s = 556√861 / 2583

Hmm, that seems messy. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me check my steps.

Wait, in equation 3, after substitution, we had:

81 / 41 + (s - 12√861 / 41)^2 + t² = 41

But earlier, we had s² + t² = 3024 / 41

So, substituting:

81 / 41 + (s² - 2 * s * 12√861 / 41 + (12√861 / 41)^2 ) + t² = 41

But s² + t² = 3024 / 41, so:

81 / 41 + (3024 / 41 - (24√861 / 41)s + (144*861)/1681 ) = 41

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting.

Wait, let's write down:

(s - a)^2 + t² = b

But s² + t² = c

So, expanding (s - a)^2 + t² = b:

s² - 2 a s + a² + t² = b

But s² + t² = c, so:

c - 2 a s + a² = b

Therefore,

-2 a s = b - c - a²

Thus,

s = (c + a² - b) / (2 a)

So, in our case, a = 12√861 / 41, c = 3024 / 41, b = 41 - 81 / 41 = (1681 - 81)/41 = 1600 / 41

Wait, hold on, let's re-examine:

Wait, equation 3 was:

81 / 41 + (s - a)^2 + t² = 41, where a = 12√861 / 41

But s² + t² = 3024 /41

So, (s - a)^2 + t² = 41 - 81/41 = (1681 - 81)/41 = 1600/41

So, expanding:

(s² - 2 a s + a²) + t² = 1600 / 41

But s² + t² = 3024 /41

So,

3024 /41 - 2 a s + a² = 1600 /41

Thus,

-2 a s = 1600 /41 - 3024 /41 - a²

Compute 1600 - 3024 = -1424, so:

-2 a s = (-1424)/41 - a²

Thus,

s = [ (1424 /41 + a² ) ] / (2 a )

Compute a²: (12√861 / 41)^2 = 144 * 861 / (41²) = (144 * 861)/1681

Compute 144 * 861: let's compute 100*861=86100, 40*861=34440, 4*861=3444, so total 86100 + 34440 = 120540 + 3444 = 123,984

Thus, a² = 123,984 / 1681

So,

s = [ (1424 /41 + 123,984 / 1681 ) ] / (2 * 12√861 / 41 )

Convert 1424 /41 to over 1681:

1424 /41 = (1424 * 41) / (41 *41 ) = Let's compute 1424 * 41:

1424 * 40 = 56,960

1424 * 1 = 1,424

Total: 56,960 + 1,424 = 58,384

Thus, 1424 /41 = 58,384 / 1681

So,

s = [ (58,384 / 1681 + 123,984 /1681 ) ] / (24√861 /41 )

Compute numerator:

58,384 + 123,984 = 182,368

Thus,

s = (182,368 /1681 ) / (24√861 /41 ) = (182,368 /1681 ) * (41 /24√861 )

Simplify:

182,368 ÷41 = Let's compute 41 * 4448 = 41 *4000=164,000; 41*448=18,448. So, 164,000 +18,448=182,448. Hmm, 182,448 vs 182,368, which is 80 less.

Wait, 41*4448=182,448, so 41*(4448 - 2)=182,448 -82=182,366. Still not matching.

Wait, 182,368 -182,448= -80, so 41*4448 -80=182,368.

But 41 and 80 are coprime, so perhaps it's 4448 - (80/41). Hmm, messy.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, 182,368 divided by 41:

41*4440=41*(4000+400+40)=164,000 +16,400 +1,640=164,000+16,400=180,400+1,640=182,040

Subtract: 182,368 -182,040=328

328 ÷41=8

So, 4440 +8=4448

So, 41*4448=182,368

Therefore,

s = (4448 /1681 ) * (41 /24√861 ) = (4448 / (41² )) * (41 /24√861 ) = 4448 / (41*24√861 ) = 4448 / (984√861 )

Simplify 4448 /984:

Divide numerator and denominator by 8: 4448 ÷8=556, 984 ÷8=123

So, 556 /123√861

Simplify 556 /123: 556 ÷123=4 with remainder 556 -4*123=556-492=64

So, 556 /123=4 +64/123

But not helpful. Alternatively, factor:

556=4*139

123=3*41

So, 556 /123= (4*139)/(3*41). Hmm, 139 is prime, 41 is prime, so no further simplification.

Therefore,

s= (4*139)/(3*41√861 )= (556)/(123√861 )

Not sure if this is correct, but seems messy.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier step.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the volume via another method, since the coordinates are getting too complicated.

Wait, since all four faces are congruent triangles, and the edges are known, maybe I can compute the volume using the formula for a disphenoid.

Wait, I think the formula for the volume of a disphenoid is:

V = \frac{\sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 - b^2 + c^2)(-a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}}{72}

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, I think for a general tetrahedron, the volume is sqrt( |CM| ) / something, but perhaps for a disphenoid, there is a specific formula.

Wait, alternatively, maybe using the formula:

In a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated as:

V = \frac{4}{3} \times \text{Area of one face} \times \text{Distance from incenter to vertex}

But that's not helpful because we don't know the inradius yet.

Wait, but perhaps we can relate the inradius to the volume and the total surface area.

Indeed, r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area.

So, if I can compute V and S, then I can find r.

So, let's try to compute the volume V.

Wait, another formula for the volume of a tetrahedron is:

V = \frac{abc}{6} for a regular tetrahedron, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, but perhaps using Cayley-Menger determinant.

Wait, earlier, I started computing the determinant, and perhaps I can continue with the expansion.

Given that, the determinant is:

CM = - determinant of the minor M12:

Which is -1 * det(M12)

Which we found to be:

- determinant of:

[1, 41, 80, 89]

[41, 0, 89, 80]

[80, 89, 0, 41]

[89, 80, 41, 0]

Hmm, that's another 4x4 determinant.

Wait, perhaps I can compute that determinant.

Let me denote this minor as N.

N = determinant of:

Row 1: [1, 41, 80, 89]

Row 2: [41, 0, 89, 80]

Row 3: [80, 89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [89, 80, 41, 0]

Wait, perhaps I can perform row operations to simplify.

Alternatively, perhaps expand the determinant.

Alternatively, notice that the matrix has a certain structure.

Wait, actually, this matrix is a 4x4 with a symmetric pattern.

Wait, let me check if it's a circulant matrix or something similar.

But looking at the rows, each row is a cyclic permutation but with different starting elements.

Wait, maybe I can subtract rows from each other.

Let me denote the rows as R1, R2, R3, R4.

Compute R2 - R1:

[41 -1, 0 -41, 89 -80, 80 -89] = [40, -41, 9, -9]

Similarly, R3 - R1:

[80 -1, 89 -41, 0 -80, 41 -89] = [79, 48, -80, -48]

R4 - R1:

[89 -1, 80 -41, 41 -80, 0 -89] = [88, 39, -39, -89]

Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps factor out common terms.

Looking at R2:

[41, 0, 89, 80]

Maybe factor out 41? No, 89 and 80 are not multiples of 41.

Wait, perhaps compute the determinant by expanding along the first row.

So, N = 1 * det(minor11) - 41 * det(minor12) + 80 * det(minor13) -89 * det(minor14)

Compute each minor:

Minor11: determinant of

Row 2: [0, 89, 80]

Row 3: [89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [80, 41, 0]

So, minor11 is:

| 0    89   80 |

|89    0    41|

|80    41    0|

Compute this determinant:

= 0*(0*0 -41*41) -89*(89*0 -41*80) +80*(89*41 -0*80)

= 0 -89*(-3280) +80*(3649)

= 0 + 89*3280 +80*3649

Compute 89*3280:

Compute 90*3280 = 295,200; subtract 1*3280 = 3,280; so 295,200 -3,280 = 291,920

Compute 80*3649:

Compute 80*3000=240,000; 80*649=51,920; total 240,000 +51,920=291,920

So,

= 291,920 +291,920 = 583,840

So, minor11 determinant is 583,840

Next, minor12: determinant of

Row 2: [41, 89, 80]

Row 3: [89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [80, 41, 0]

Compute this determinant:

|41    89    80|

|89     0    41|

|80    41     0|

Compute:

41*(0*0 -41*41) -89*(89*0 -41*80) +80*(89*41 -0*80)

=41*(-1681) -89*(-3280) +80*(3649)

Compute each term:

41*(-1681) = -69,  let's compute 40*1681=67,240; 1*1681=1,681; so 67,240 +1,681=68,921; so -68,921

-89*(-3280)= +89*3280=291,920

80*3649=291,920

Thus,

= -68,921 +291,920 +291,920 = (-68,921) +583,840 = 514,919

So, minor12 determinant is 514,919

Next, minor13: determinant of

Row2: [41, 0, 80]

Row3: [80,89,41]

Row4: [89,80,0]

Compute:

|41    0    80|

|80    89    41|

|89    80     0|

Compute:

41*(89*0 -80*41) -0*(80*0 -89*41) +80*(80*80 -89*89)

=41*(-3280) -0 +80*(6400 -7921)

= -134,480 +80*(-1521)

= -134,480 -121,680 = -256,160

So, minor13 determinant is -256,160

Next, minor14: determinant of

Row2: [41, 0, 89]

Row3: [80,89,0]

Row4: [89,80,41]

Compute:

|41    0    89|

|80    89     0|

|89    80    41|

Compute:

41*(89*41 -0*80) -0*(80*41 -0*89) +89*(80*80 -89*89)

=41*(3649) -0 +89*(6400 -7921)

=41*3649 +89*(-1521)

Compute 41*3649:

40*3649=145,960; 1*3649=3,649; total 145,960 +3,649=149,609

89*(-1521)= -89*1521

Compute 90*1521=136,890; subtract 1*1521=1,521; so 136,890 -1,521=135,369; thus, -89*1521= -135,369

So,

=149,609 -135,369 =14,240

So, minor14 determinant is14,240

Thus, putting it all together:

N = 1 * 583,840 -41 *514,919 +80*(-256,160) -89 *14,240

Compute each term:

1 *583,840 =583,840

-41*514,919= -41*514,919. Let me compute 40*514,919=20,596,760; 1*514,919=514,919; so total 20,596,760 +514,919=21,111,679; so -21,111,679

80*(-256,160)= -20,492,800

-89*14,240= -1,267,  since 90*14,240=1,281,600; subtract 1*14,240=14,240; so 1,281,600 -14,240=1,267,360; so -1,267,360

Thus, adding all:

583,840 -21,111,679 -20,492,800 -1,267,360

Compute step by step:

583,840 -21,111,679 = -20,527,839

-20,527,839 -20,492,800 = -41,020,639

-41,020,639 -1,267,360 = -42,288,000 -639 +360= Wait, actually, 41,020,639 +1,267,360 =42,288,000 - 639 +360? Wait, wait, 41,020,639 +1,267,360 =42,288,000 - (639 -360)=42,288,000 -279=42,287,721

Wait, no, actually:

Wait, 41,020,639 +1,267,360: 41,020,639 +1,000,000=42,020,639; 42,020,639 +267,360=42,288,000 -1=42,287,999

Wait, 41,020,639 +1,267,360=42,288,000 -1=42,287,999

Thus,

N = 583,840 -21,111,679 -20,492,800 -1,267,360 = 583,840 - (21,111,679 +20,492,800 +1,267,360)=583,840 -42,871,839= -42,288,000 - (839 -840)= -42,287,161

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the arithmetic.

Wait, 583,840 -21,111,679= -20,527,839

-20,527,839 -20,492,800= -41,020,639

-41,020,639 -1,267,360= -42,288,000 - (639 -360)= -42,288,000 -279= -42,288,279

Wait, but 583,840 -21,111,679= -20,527,839

-20,527,839 -20,492,800= -41,020,639

-41,020,639 -1,267,360= -42,288,000 - (639 -360)= -42,288,000 -279= -42,288,279

But 41,020,639 +1,267,360=42,287,999, so N=583,840 -42,287,999= -41,704,159

Wait, now I'm confused.

Wait, let me compute 583,840 -21,111,679:

583,840 -21,111,679= -20,527,839

Then, subtract 20,492,800: -20,527,839 -20,492,800= -41,020,639

Then, subtract 1,267,360: -41,020,639 -1,267,360= -42,288,000 - (639 -360)= -42,288,000 -279= -42,288,279

So, N= -42,288,279

Thus, the Cayley-Menger determinant is:

det(CM) = -N = 42,288,279

Wait, hold on, in the initial step:

The volume formula is V = sqrt( |det(CM)| / 288 )

But in my earlier expansion, I have:

det(CM) = -N, where N was the determinant of the minor M12.

Wait, perhaps I got confused in the expansion.

Wait, no, the determinant expansion is:

det(CM) = -1 * det(M12) + 0 -80 * det(M13) +89 * det(M14)

Which is:

det(CM) = -N + 0 -80*(-256,160) +89*(14,240)

Wait, no, sorry, in the expansion:

det(CM) = (-1)^{1+1} *1 * det(M11) + (-1)^{1+2} *0 * det(M12) + (-1)^{1+3} *(-80) * det(M13) + (-1)^{1+4} *89 * det(M14)

So, det(CM) = 1 * det(M11) -0 + (-80)*det(M13) +89*det(M14)

Which is det(CM) = det(M11) -80*det(M13) +89*det(M14)

From above, det(M11)=583,840, det(M13)= -256,160, det(M14)=14,240

Thus,

det(CM) =583,840 -80*(-256,160) +89*(14,240)

Compute each term:

583,840

-80*(-256,160)= +20,492,800

89*14,240=1,267, 360

So,

det(CM)=583,840 +20,492,800 +1,267,360=583,840 +20,492,800=21,076,640 +1,267,360=22,344,000

So, det(CM)=22,344,000

Therefore, the volume is sqrt( |22,344,000| / 288 )

Compute 22,344,000 /288:

22,344,000 ÷ 288: Let's divide numerator and denominator by 16: 22,344,000 ÷16=1,396,500; 288 ÷16=18

So, 1,396,500 /18=77,583.333...

Hmm, 1,396,500 ÷18: 18*77,583=1,396,494, remainder 6, so 77,583 +6/18=77,583 +1/3≈77,583.333...

Thus, V= sqrt(77,583.333...)= sqrt(232,750 /3)= Hmm, wait, maybe it's exact.

Wait, 22,344,000 /288=22,344,000 ÷288: Let's compute 22,344,000 ÷288:

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 22,344,000 ÷16=1,396,500; 288 ÷16=18

So, 1,396,500 ÷18=77,583.333... So, 77,583.333...=77,583 +1/3

Thus,

V= sqrt(77,583 +1/3)= sqrt(232,750 /3). Wait, 77,583 *3=232,749, plus1=232,750. So, V= sqrt(232,750 /3 )

Simplify sqrt(232,750 /3 ). Let's factor numerator:

232,750=23275*10= (23275)*10

23275=25*931

931=7*133=7*7*19

So, 232,750=25*7*7*19*10=25*49*19*10

Thus, sqrt(232,750 /3)=sqrt(25*49*19*10 /3)=5*7*sqrt(190 /3)=35*sqrt(190/3 )

Simplify sqrt(190/3)=sqrt(570)/3, so V=35*sqrt(570)/3= (35/3)*sqrt(570)

But 570=2*3*5*19, so it's square-free.

Wait, sqrt(570) can't be simplified further.

So, V=35√570 /3

Wait, but 570=2*3*5*19, so that's square-free.

Thus, V= (35√570)/3

Wait, but let me verify that.

Wait, 232,750 /3=77,583.333...

sqrt(77,583.333)=278.5 approximately, but exact value is messy.

But above, factoring gives V=35*sqrt(570)/3, which is exact.

So, V=35√570 /3

Now, having found V, I can compute the total surface area S.

Since all four faces are congruent triangles, each with area T, so S=4T.

Compute T: area of one face, say, triangle ABC.

We can compute the area of triangle ABC with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80).

We can use Heron's formula.

Compute semi-perimeter s=(sqrt(41)+sqrt(89)+sqrt(80))/2

But that's messy. Alternatively, use the Cayley-Menger determinant for the area of a triangle.

Alternatively, compute using vectors.

Wait, given points A, B, C in 3D space, area can be computed as 1/2 |AB × AC|

We have coordinates for A, B, C.

Point A: (0,0,0)

Point B: (√41, 0, 0)

Point C: (16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0)

Compute vectors AB and AC:

AB = B - A = (√41, 0, 0)

AC = C - A = (16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0)

Compute cross product AB × AC:

|i   j   k|

√41   0   0

16√41/41   12√861/41   0

So, determinant:

i*(0*0 -0*12√861/41 ) -j*(√41*0 -0*16√41/41 ) +k*(√41*12√861/41 -0*16√41/41 )

Simplify:

i*0 -j*0 +k*( (√41 *12√861)/41 )

Compute the k component:

(√41 *12√861)/41 =12*sqrt(41*861)/41

Compute sqrt(41*861):

First, compute 41*861: 41*800=32,800; 41*61=2,501; total=32,800 +2,501=35,301

So, sqrt(35,301)

Wait, 35,301=41*861, which is what we had. So, sqrt(41*861)=sqrt(35,301)

Therefore, the cross product AB × AC has magnitude |k component| =12*sqrt(35,301)/41

Thus, the area T is 1/2 of that: 6*sqrt(35,301)/41

So, S=4T=24*sqrt(35,301)/41

Thus, S=24√35301 /41

Wait, but 35,301=41*861, as above, so sqrt(35,301)=sqrt(41*861)=sqrt(41)*sqrt(861)

But 861=3*7*41, so sqrt(861)=sqrt(3*7*41)

Thus, sqrt(35,301)=sqrt(41)*sqrt(3*7*41)=41*sqrt(21)

Wait, sqrt(41*861)=sqrt(41*(3*7*41))=sqrt(41^2 *21)=41*sqrt(21)

Therefore, sqrt(35,301)=41√21

Thus, T=6*41√21 /41=6√21

Therefore, each face has area T=6√21, so total surface area S=4*6√21=24√21

Wow, that's much simpler!

So, S=24√21

And volume V=35√570 /3

Thus, the inradius r= 3V / S= 3*(35√570 /3 ) / (24√21 )= (35√570 ) / (24√21 )

Simplify:

r=35√570 / (24√21 )=35√(570 /21 ) /24

Simplify 570 /21= 570 ÷21=27.142857≈27.142857, but exact value: 570 ÷21= (570 ÷3)/(21 ÷3)=190 /7

So, 570 /21=190/7, so √(190/7 )

Thus, r=35√(190/7 ) /24

Simplify √(190/7 )=√(190)/√7, but can we rationalize?

Alternatively, write as 35/(24) *√(190/7 )

But 190=2*5*19, 7 is prime. So, no further simplification.

But perhaps we can write it as 35√1330 / (24*7 )=35√1330 /168. But 1330=190*7=2*5*7*19, which is square-free.

Wait, but 35 and 168 share a common factor: 7.

So, 35=5*7, 168=24*7.

Thus, r= (5*7)√1330 / (24*7 )=5√1330 /24

Wait, √1330=√(10*133)=√10*√133, but 133=7*19, so √1330=√(7*10*19). So, square-free.

Alternatively, maybe the initial approach is better.

Wait, let me retrace:

r=35√(190/7 ) /24

But √(190/7 )=√(1330)/7, since 190/7= (190*7)/7^2=1330/49, so sqrt(1330)/7.

Wait, no, actually,

Wait, 190/7 is already simplified, so √(190/7 ) is as simplified as it gets.

Thus, r= (35 /24 )√(190/7 )

But let me rationalize it differently.

Wait, perhaps multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(7):

r=35√(190)/ (24√7 )=35√(190)/ (24√7 )=35√(190*7)/ (24*7 )=35√1330 /168

Simplify 35 and 168: GCD(35,168)=7

Thus, 35 ÷7=5; 168 ÷7=24

So, r=5√1330 /24

But 1330=10*133=10*7*19

Thus, √1330=√(10*7*19 ), which is square-free.

Therefore, r=5√1330 /24

But wait, the problem says the distance can be written as m√n /p, with m and p being coprime, and n square not divisible by square of a prime.

But 1330=10*133=10*7*19, which is square-free.

But 5 and24 are coprime.

So, m=5, n=1330, p=24

But wait, 1330 can be written as 10*133=10*7*19, which is square-free, so that's correct.

But wait, wait, 1330=10*133=10*7*19, so 1330 is square-free.

Wait, but 1330 is 10*133, which is 2*5*7*19, so square-free. So, n=1330.

But is that the minimal? Or can we write it as a smaller n?

Wait, n must be square-free, so 1330 is square-free. So, it's acceptable.

Wait, but let me see if I made a mistake in simplifying.

Wait, I have r=35√(190/7 ) /24=35/(24) *√(190)/√7=35√190/(24√7 )

Multiply numerator and denominator by √7: 35√190√7 / (24*7 )=35√1330 /168

Simplify 35/168=5/24

So, r=5√1330 /24, as above.

Thus, m=5, n=1330, p=24

Check if m and p are coprime: 5 and24 share no common factors, so yes.

Thus, m +n +p=5 +1330 +24=1359

Wait, but before I finalize, let me cross-verify.

Wait, inradius formula: r=3V/S. We have V=35√570 /3, S=24√21

Thus,

r= 3*(35√570 /3 ) / (24√21 )=35√570 / (24√21 )

Simplify: √570 /√21=√(570/21 )=√(27.142857)=√(190/7 )

Thus, r=35√(190/7 ) /24= same as above.

Yes, so 35√190 / (24√7 )=5√1330 /24

So, the answer is 5√1330 /24, so m=5, n=1330, p=24

Thus, m +n +p=5 +1330 +24=1359

But wait, the problem says "distance can be written in the form m√n /p", and 1330 is square-free, so that's correct.

But to make sure, let me compute if 1330 can be simplified further. 1330=10*133=10*7*19. 7 and19 are primes, so yes, it's square-free.

Thus, the answer is 1359.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1359}
</think>

Given a tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with edge lengths \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{89}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{861}\), we need to find the distance from a point \(I\) inside the tetrahedron to each of the four faces. This distance can be written in the form \(\frac{m\sqrt{n}}{p}\), where \(m\) and \(p\) are relatively prime, and \(n\) is not divisible by the square of any prime. We then find \(m + n + p\).

First, we recognize that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, meaning all four faces are congruent triangles. We use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume \(V\) of the tetrahedron. The determinant is computed as follows:

\[
\text{det}(CM) = -N = 22,344,000
\]

The volume \(V\) is then calculated using the formula:

\[
V = \sqrt{\frac{|\text{det}(CM)|}{288}} = \sqrt{\frac{22,344,000}{288}} = \frac{35\sqrt{570}}{3}
\]

Next, we find the total surface area \(S\) of the tetrahedron. Each face is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{89}\), and \(\sqrt{80}\). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is found to be \(6\sqrt{21}\). Since there are four congruent faces, the total surface area is:

\[
S = 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}
\]

The distance \(r\) from the incenter \(I\) to each face is given by the formula \(r = \frac{3V}{S}\):

\[
r = \frac{3 \times \frac{35\sqrt{570}}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{35\sqrt{570}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{5\sqrt{1330}}{24}
\]

Thus, the distance is written as \(\frac{5\sqrt{1330}}{24}\), where \(m = 5\), \(n = 1330\), and \(p = 24\). Therefore, \(m + n + p = 5 + 1330 + 24 = 1359\).

\[
\boxed{1359}
\]
