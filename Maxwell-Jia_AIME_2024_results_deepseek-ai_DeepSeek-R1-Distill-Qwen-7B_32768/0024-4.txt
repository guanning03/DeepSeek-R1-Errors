Question:
Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

Correct Answer:
Assume that $AC$ is the asymptote of the hyperbola, in which case $BD$ is minimized. The expression of $BD$ is $y=-\sqrt{\frac{5}{6}}x$. Thus, we could get $\frac{x^2}{20}-\frac{y^2}{24}=1\implies x^2=\frac{720}{11}$. The desired value is $4\cdot \frac{11}{6}x^2=480$. This case can't be achieved, so all $BD^2$ would be greater than $\boxed{480}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. The hyperbola is given by the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus \(ABCD\). The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. The question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I need to find the supremum of \(BD^2\) over all possible rhombuses inscribed in this hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin, and then find the number just below this supremum.

First, let me recall some properties of rhombuses and hyperbolas. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, hold on, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually they are! I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Let me confirm that.

Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, that means the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees. Also, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\) lie on the hyperbola, then their coordinates are symmetric with respect to both axes because the hyperbola is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis.

Therefore, if point \(A\) is \((x, y)\), then point \(C\) must be \((-x, -y)\). Similarly, if point \(B\) is \((u, v)\), then point \(D\) must be \((-u, -v)\). That makes sense because the diagonals intersect at the origin, so the diagonals are \(AC\) and \(BD\).

So, the rhombus is determined by two points: \(A\) and \(B\). Then \(C\) and \(D\) are just the negatives of \(A\) and \(B\), respectively.

Given that, let me try to parametrize points \(A\) and \(B\).

Since points \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), their coordinates must satisfy this equation. So, \(A = (x, y)\) and \(B = (u, v)\) with \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) and \(\frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1\).

Now, since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the lengths \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) are equal. Alternatively, since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at 90 degrees. So, the vectors from the origin to the midpoints of the diagonals are at right angles.

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the midpoint is the origin, which is given. Also, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is \(-1\).

Alternatively, vectors \(OA\) and \(OB\) are such that they satisfy \(OA \cdot OB = 0\) because the diagonals are perpendicular? Wait, no, the diagonals are \(AC\) and \(BD\). So, the vectors \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular.

But \(AC\) is from \(A\) to \(C\), which is \( (-2x, -2y)\), and \(BD\) is from \(B\) to \(D\), which is \((-2u, -2v)\). So, the vectors \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:

\[
(-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 4(xu + yv) = 0
\]
So, \(xu + yv = 0\).

Therefore, for points \(A = (x, y)\) and \(B = (u, v)\) on the hyperbola, we have the condition \(xu + yv = 0\).

Additionally, since all sides are equal, the lengths \(AB\), \(BC\), etc., are equal. So, let's compute \(AB\):

\(AB\) is the distance between \(A = (x, y)\) and \(B = (u, v)\), so:

\[
AB^2 = (x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2
\]

Similarly, \(BC\) is the distance between \(B\) and \(C\), which is \( (u - (-x))^2 + (v - (-y))^2 = (u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2 \). Wait, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so \(AB = BC\). Therefore, \(AB^2 = BC^2\), which gives:

\[
(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2 = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2
\]

Let me expand both sides:

Left side:
\(x^2 - 2xu + u^2 + y^2 - 2yv + v^2\)

Right side:
\(x^2 + 2xu + u^2 + y^2 + 2yv + v^2\)

Set them equal:

\(x^2 - 2xu + u^2 + y^2 - 2yv + v^2 = x^2 + 2xu + u^2 + y^2 + 2yv + v^2\)

Simplify:

Subtract \(x^2 + u^2 + y^2 + v^2\) from both sides:

\(-2xu - 2yv = 2xu + 2yv\)

Bring all terms to one side:

\(-4xu - 4yv = 0\)

Divide both sides by -4:

\(xu + yv = 0\)

Wait, that's the same condition we had earlier from the diagonals being perpendicular. So, that doesn't give us any new information. So, that just reinforces the fact that the diagonals being perpendicular implies the sides are equal, which is consistent with it being a rhombus.

So, we have two conditions:

1. \(xu + yv = 0\)
2. Points \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\)

So, given that, we can think of points \(A\) and \(B\) as points on the hyperbola such that their position vectors are perpendicular.

Now, the problem is asking about \(BD^2\). Since \(B = (u, v)\) and \(D = (-u, -v)\), the distance \(BD\) is the distance between \(B\) and \(D\), which is:

\[
BD^2 = (u - (-u))^2 + (v - (-v))^2 = (2u)^2 + (2v)^2 = 4u^2 + 4v^2
\]

So, \(BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\). Our goal is to find the supremum of \(BD^2\) over all such rhombuses, and then find the greatest real number less than this supremum.

So, essentially, we need to maximize \(4(u^2 + v^2)\) given the constraints that \(\frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1\) and \(xu + yv = 0\), where \(A = (x, y)\) is another point on the hyperbola.

But how do we relate \(x, y\) and \(u, v\)? Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, we can consider the vectors \(OA\) and \(OB\). The sides of the rhombus can be represented as vectors, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of slopes or something else.

Wait, another thought: Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, the vectors \(AB\) and \(AD\) are equal in length and are adjacent sides. So, vector \(AB = (u - x, v - y)\) and vector \(AD = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y)\). Wait, no, vector \(AD\) is from \(A\) to \(D\), which is \(D - A = (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y)\). Hmm, but in a rhombus, adjacent sides should have the same length.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of parametrizing the points.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use coordinates to express the condition that the sides are equal.

Wait, but since we already have the condition that \(xu + yv = 0\), and both \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the hyperbola, maybe we can parametrize points \(A\) and \(B\) on the hyperbola in terms of parameters, say, angles or something else.

Let me try parametrizing the hyperbola. For hyperbola parametrization, we can use hyperbolic functions. For the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\), a parametrization is \(x = a \cosh \theta\), \(y = b \sinh \theta\). Alternatively, another parametrization is \(x = a \sec \theta\), \(y = b \tan \theta\), but that might complicate things because of sec and tan.

Alternatively, maybe we can use coordinates in terms of slopes.

Wait, another idea: Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, the sides \(AB\) and \(AD\) are equal and the angle between them is determined by the slopes of \(AB\) and \(AD\). But perhaps this is getting too abstract.

Wait, perhaps we can consider the diagonals. In a rhombus, the area is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2\), where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals. But in this case, the diagonals are \(AC\) and \(BD\). Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, their lengths can be expressed in terms of the coordinates of \(A\) and \(B\).

Given that, the length of diagonal \(AC\) is the distance between \(A\) and \(C\), which is \(\sqrt{(x - (-x))^2 + (y - (-y))^2} = \sqrt{(2x)^2 + (2y)^2} = 2\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). Similarly, the length of diagonal \(BD\) is \(2\sqrt{u^2 + v^2}\), as we had earlier.

So, the area of the rhombus is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \times 2\sqrt{u^2 + v^2} = 2\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)(u^2 + v^2)}\). Hmm, but I don't know if that's helpful here.

Wait, perhaps we can use the fact that in a rhombus, the sum of the squares of the diagonals is equal to four times the sum of the squares of the sides. Wait, yes, that formula: \(AC^2 + BD^2 = 4AB^2\). So, let's verify:

We have \(AC^2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 = 4x^2 + 4y^2\)

Similarly, \(BD^2 = 4u^2 + 4v^2\)

So, \(AC^2 + BD^2 = 4x^2 + 4y^2 + 4u^2 + 4v^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2 + u^2 + v^2)\)

On the other hand, \(4AB^2 = 4[(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2] = 4(x^2 - 2xu + u^2 + y^2 - 2yv + v^2) = 4(x^2 + u^2 + y^2 + v^2 - 2xu - 2yv)\)

But since \(xu + yv = 0\), this simplifies to \(4(x^2 + u^2 + y^2 + v^2)\), which is equal to \(AC^2 + BD^2\). Therefore, this formula holds.

So, another way to think about this is that \(AC^2 + BD^2 = 4AB^2\). So, if we can express \(AB^2\) in terms of the coordinates, we can relate it to \(BD^2\).

Given that, \(AB^2 = (x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2\). Let's compute that:

\(AB^2 = x^2 - 2xu + u^2 + y^2 - 2yv + v^2 = (x^2 + y^2) + (u^2 + v^2) - 2(xu + yv)\)

But since \(xu + yv = 0\), this simplifies to:

\(AB^2 = (x^2 + y^2) + (u^2 + v^2)\)

So, \(AB^2 = (x^2 + y^2) + (u^2 + v^2)\)

But then, from the earlier formula, \(AC^2 + BD^2 = 4AB^2\), so:

\(4(x^2 + y^2 + u^2 + v^2) = 4[(x^2 + y^2) + (u^2 + v^2)]\), which is consistent.

So, perhaps, since we need to find \(BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\), and we have constraints on \(A\) and \(B\), maybe we can express this in terms of other variables.

Given that both \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the hyperbola, we have:

\(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) and \(\frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1\)

We can rewrite these as:

\(x^2 = 20\left(1 + \frac{y^2}{24}\right)\) and \(u^2 = 20\left(1 + \frac{v^2}{24}\right)\)

So, \(x^2 + y^2 = 20\left(1 + \frac{y^2}{24}\right) + y^2 = 20 + \frac{20y^2}{24} + y^2 = 20 + \left(\frac{20}{24} + 1\right)y^2 = 20 + \left(\frac{5}{6} + 1\right)y^2 = 20 + \frac{11}{6}y^2\)

Similarly, \(u^2 + v^2 = 20 + \frac{11}{6}v^2\)

Therefore, \(BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2) = 4\left(20 + \frac{11}{6}v^2\right)\)

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is helpful yet. Maybe we can express \(BD^2\) in terms of \(y\) or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the points \(A\) and \(B\) in terms of angles or something else.

Wait, another approach: Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the coordinates of \(A\) and \(B\) must satisfy \(xu + yv = 0\). So, maybe we can consider \(A\) and \(B\) as vectors such that their dot product is zero, but scaled by the hyperbola equation.

Wait, so if we think of \(A\) as a vector \(\vec{a} = (x, y)\) and \(B\) as \(\vec{b} = (u, v)\), then \(\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = xu + yv = 0\). So, the vectors are perpendicular.

Therefore, in addition to both vectors lying on the hyperbola, they must be perpendicular.

So, the problem reduces to finding two points on the hyperbola such that their position vectors are perpendicular, and then maximizing \(BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\). So, perhaps, if we can parametrize the hyperbola in such a way that we can express \(u\) and \(v\) in terms of the parameters of \(x\) and \(y\), given the perpendicularity condition.

Let me try parametrizing the hyperbola with a single parameter. For hyperbola, a common parametrization is using hyperbolic functions:

\(x = a \cosh \theta\), \(y = b \sinh \theta\), where \(a = \sqrt{20}\) and \(b = \sqrt{24}\). So,

\(x = \sqrt{20} \cosh \theta\),
\(y = \sqrt{24} \sinh \theta\).

Similarly, another point \(B\) can be parametrized with a different parameter, say, \(\phi\):

\(u = \sqrt{20} \cosh \phi\),
\(v = \sqrt{24} \sinh \phi\).

Given that, the condition \(xu + yv = 0\) becomes:

\(\sqrt{20} \cosh \theta \times \sqrt{20} \cosh \phi + \sqrt{24} \sinh \theta \times \sqrt{24} \sinh \phi = 0\)

Simplify:

\(20 \cosh \theta \cosh \phi + 24 \sinh \theta \sinh \phi = 0\)

So,

\(20 \cosh \theta \cosh \phi = -24 \sinh \theta \sinh \phi\)

Divide both sides by \(\cosh \theta \cosh \phi\) (assuming they are non-zero, which they are except for the vertex, but the vertex isn't on the hyperbola when considering real numbers):

\(20 = -24 \tanh \theta \tanh \phi\)

So,

\(\tanh \theta \tanh \phi = -\frac{20}{24} = -\frac{5}{6}\)

So, \(\tanh \theta \tanh \phi = -\frac{5}{6}\)

Hmm, so that's a relationship between \(\theta\) and \(\phi\). Let me denote \(k = \tanh \theta\), then \(\tanh \phi = -\frac{5}{6k}\).

So, \(\tanh \phi = -\frac{5}{6k}\), but since \(\tanh \phi\) must be between -1 and 1, the right-hand side must satisfy \(-1 \leq -\frac{5}{6k} \leq 1\).

So,

\(-1 \leq -\frac{5}{6k} \leq 1\)

Multiply all parts by -1 (and reverse inequalities):

\(1 \geq \frac{5}{6k} \geq -1\)

So,

\(-1 \leq \frac{5}{6k} \leq 1\)

Which implies that \(\frac{5}{6k} \leq 1\) and \(\frac{5}{6k} \geq -1\).

So,

From \(\frac{5}{6k} \leq 1\), we get \(\frac{5}{6} \leq k\) if \(k > 0\), but if \(k < 0\), the inequality flips. Similarly, from \(\frac{5}{6k} \geq -1\), if \(k > 0\), then \(\frac{5}{6} \geq -k\), which is always true since \(k > 0\). If \(k < 0\), then \(\frac{5}{6k} \geq -1\) implies \(\frac{5}{6} \leq -k\), so \(k \leq -\frac{5}{6}\).

Therefore, combining both, we have two cases:

1. If \(k > 0\), then \(\frac{5}{6} \leq k\). But since \(k = \tanh \theta\), and \(\tanh \theta\) approaches 1 as \(\theta\) approaches infinity, so \(k\) can be up to 1. So, for \(k > 0\), \(k\) is in \([\frac{5}{6}, 1)\).

2. If \(k < 0\), then \(k \leq -\frac{5}{6}\). But since \(k = \tanh \theta\), \(\theta\) must be such that \(\tanh \theta\) is less than or equal to \(-\frac{5}{6}\). So, \(\theta\) is in \((-\infty, \tanh^{-1}(-\frac{5}{6}))\).

So, both cases are possible, but we need to see how this affects the expression for \(BD^2\). Let's proceed.

Our goal is to maximize \(BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\). Given the parametrization:

\(u = \sqrt{20} \cosh \phi\),
\(v = \sqrt{24} \sinh \phi\).

Therefore,

\(u^2 + v^2 = 20 \cosh^2 \phi + 24 \sinh^2 \phi\)

Similarly, since we have the relationship between \(\theta\) and \(\phi\), we can write this in terms of \(\theta\).

Recall that \(k = \tanh \theta\), and \(\tanh \phi = -\frac{5}{6k}\). Let me denote \(\tanh \phi = -m\), where \(m = \frac{5}{6k}\). So, \(m = \frac{5}{6k}\), which is positive since \(k\) is either positive or negative, but \(m\) is positive because it's 5/(6k) and if \(k\) is negative, then \(m\) is negative. Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, \(m = \frac{5}{6k}\). If \(k > 0\), then \(m > 0\). If \(k < 0\), then \(m < 0\). But since \(\tanh \phi = -m\), if \(m > 0\), then \(\tanh \phi = -m < 0\), and if \(m < 0\), then \(\tanh \phi = -m > 0\). So, in either case, \(\tanh \phi\) is expressed as \(-\frac{5}{6k}\), which can be positive or negative.

But regardless, let's express \(u^2 + v^2\) in terms of \(\theta\). Since \(u^2 + v^2 = 20 \cosh^2 \phi + 24 \sinh^2 \phi\). Let's write \(\cosh^2 \phi\) and \(\sinh^2 \phi\) in terms of \(\tanh \phi\):

We know that \(\cosh^2 \phi = 1 + \sinh^2 \phi\), and \(\sinh^2 \phi = \tanh^2 \phi / (1 - \tanh^2 \phi)\). Alternatively, we can express \(\cosh^2 \phi = \frac{1}{1 - \tanh^2 \phi}\).

So, let's compute \(\cosh^2 \phi\) and \(\sinh^2 \phi\):

Let \(t = \tanh \phi = -\frac{5}{6k}\), so:

\(\cosh^2 \phi = \frac{1}{1 - t^2} = \frac{1}{1 - \left(\frac{25}{36k^2}\right)} = \frac{36k^2}{36k^2 - 25}\)

Similarly, \(\sinh^2 \phi = \frac{t^2}{1 - t^2} = \frac{\frac{25}{36k^2}}{1 - \frac{25}{36k^2}} = \frac{25}{36k^2 - 25}\)

Therefore,

\(u^2 + v^2 = 20 \times \frac{36k^2}{36k^2 - 25} + 24 \times \frac{25}{36k^2 - 25}\)

Simplify:

Compute the terms:

First term: \(20 \times \frac{36k^2}{36k^2 - 25} = \frac{720k^2}{36k^2 - 25}\)

Second term: \(24 \times \frac{25}{36k^2 - 25} = \frac{600}{36k^2 - 25}\)

So, adding both terms:

\(u^2 + v^2 = \frac{720k^2 + 600}{36k^2 - 25}\)

Factor numerator and denominator:

Factor numerator: 120(6k^2 + 5)

Denominator: 36k^2 - 25 = (6k)^2 - 5^2 = (6k - 5)(6k + 5)

So,

\(u^2 + v^2 = \frac{120(6k^2 + 5)}{(6k - 5)(6k + 5)}\)

Wait, let me check that:

720k^2 + 600 = 120*(6k^2 + 5)

And denominator is 36k^2 -25 = (6k)^2 - 5^2 = (6k -5)(6k +5). Yes, correct.

So, therefore,

\(u^2 + v^2 = \frac{120(6k^2 + 5)}{(6k -5)(6k +5)}\)

So, our expression for \(BD^2\) is:

\(BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2) = 4 \times \frac{120(6k^2 + 5)}{(6k -5)(6k +5)} = \frac{480(6k^2 + 5)}{(6k -5)(6k +5)}\)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 480(6k^2 +5)

Denominator: (6k -5)(6k +5) = 36k^2 -25

So,

\(BD^2 = \frac{480(6k^2 +5)}{36k^2 -25}\)

We can write this as:

\(BD^2 = \frac{480(6k^2 +5)}{36k^2 -25}\)

Simplify the fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by common factors:

First, 480 and 36 have a common factor of 12: 480 ÷ 12 = 40, 36 ÷12 = 3.

So, numerator becomes 40*(6k^2 +5), denominator becomes 3*(36k^2 -25)/12? Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 480(6k^2 +5) = 480*6k^2 + 480*5 = 2880k^2 + 2400

Denominator: 36k^2 -25

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can perform polynomial division or express it as:

Let me write \(BD^2 = \frac{480(6k^2 +5)}{36k^2 -25}\). Let me see if I can write this as A + B/(36k^2 -25). Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, express it as:

Let me denote \(z = 6k^2\). Then,

\(BD^2 = \frac{480(z +5)}{6z -25}\)

Simplify:

\(BD^2 = \frac{480(z +5)}{6z -25}\)

Let me write this as:

\(BD^2 = \frac{480}{6} \times \frac{z +5}{z - \frac{25}{6}} = 80 \times \frac{z +5}{z - \frac{25}{6}}\)

So, \(BD^2 = 80 \times \frac{z +5}{z - \frac{25}{6}}\)

Let me write this as:

\(BD^2 = 80 \times \left(1 + \frac{5 + \frac{25}{6}}{z - \frac{25}{6}}\right)\)

Wait, let me compute:

\(\frac{z +5}{z - \frac{25}{6}} = 1 + \frac{5 + \frac{25}{6}}{z - \frac{25}{6}}\)

Compute \(5 + \frac{25}{6} = \frac{30}{6} + \frac{25}{6} = \frac{55}{6}\)

So,

\(BD^2 = 80 \times \left(1 + \frac{\frac{55}{6}}{z - \frac{25}{6}}\right) = 80 + 80 \times \frac{55}{6} \times \frac{1}{z - \frac{25}{6}}\)

Simplify:

\(80 \times \frac{55}{6} = \frac{4400}{6} = \frac{2200}{3}\)

So,

\(BD^2 = 80 + \frac{2200}{3} \times \frac{1}{z - \frac{25}{6}}\)

So, \(BD^2 = 80 + \frac{2200}{3} \times \frac{1}{z - \frac{25}{6}}\)

Therefore, the expression for \(BD^2\) is in terms of \(z\), where \(z = 6k^2\). Remember, \(k = \tanh \theta\), so \(k\) is bounded between certain values depending on the case.

Earlier, we saw that for \(k > 0\), \(k \geq \frac{5}{6}\), so \(z =6k^2 \geq 6*(25/36) = 25/6\). Similarly, for \(k < 0\), \(k \leq -5/6\), so \(z =6k^2 \geq 6*(25/36) = 25/6\) as well. So, in both cases, \(z \geq 25/6\).

Therefore, \(z - 25/6 \geq 0\). So, the denominator is non-negative, and the fraction \(\frac{1}{z - 25/6}\) is positive.

Therefore, \(BD^2 = 80 + \frac{2200}{3} \times \frac{1}{z - 25/6}\). So, since \(\frac{1}{z - 25/6}\) is positive, \(BD^2\) is greater than 80.

But wait, let's think. When \(z\) approaches infinity, \(\frac{1}{z - 25/6}\) approaches zero, so \(BD^2\) approaches 80. On the other hand, as \(z\) approaches \(25/6\) from above, \(\frac{1}{z - 25/6}\) approaches infinity, so \(BD^2\) approaches infinity.

But that can't be, because the hyperbola is bounded in some way? Wait, no, the hyperbola extends to infinity, so points \(A\) and \(B\) can be as far as possible, making \(BD^2\) arbitrarily large. But wait, the problem is asking for the supremum of \(BD^2\) over all such rhombuses, and then find the greatest real number less than this supremum. But in our case, \(BD^2\) can be made arbitrarily large, so the supremum would be infinity. But that contradicts the question, which is asking for a finite number.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check.

Wait, let's go back to the expression for \(BD^2\):

We had \(BD^2 = \frac{480(6k^2 +5)}{36k^2 -25}\)

Wait, for \(k^2 = (5/6)^2 = 25/36\), which is the minimal value of \(k^2\). So, when \(k^2\) approaches 25/36 from above, the denominator approaches zero, making \(BD^2\) approach infinity. Therefore, as \(k\) approaches 5/6, \(BD^2\) tends to infinity. So, the supremum is infinity. But that can't be, since the hyperbola is unbounded, so points \(B\) can be as far as we want, making \(BD^2\) as large as we want.

But the question asks for the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. Wait, no, it's the supremum. Wait, the wording is "Find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi." Wait, that would be the infimum of the upper bounds, which is the supremum itself. But if \(BD^2\) can be made arbitrarily large, then the supremum is infinity, so the greatest real number less than infinity is not defined. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpret the question.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the parametrization.

Wait, let me verify the parametrization. We used hyperbolic functions for the hyperbola, which is fine, but perhaps when we parametrized point \(B\), we didn't consider the relationship between points \(A\) and \(B\), except for the perpendicularity condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this problem using vectors.

Let me consider points \(A\) and \(B\) such that vectors \(\vec{OA}\) and \(\vec{OB}\) are perpendicular. So, \(\vec{OA} \cdot \vec{OB} = 0\).

Given that, and both points lying on the hyperbola, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers to maximize \(BD^2\) under the given constraints.

So, let me set up the problem as an optimization problem.

We need to maximize \(BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\) given that:

1. \(\frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1\)
2. \(\vec{OA} \cdot \vec{OB} = 0\), i.e., \(xu + yv = 0\)
3. Points \(A = (x, y)\) and \(B = (u, v)\)

But we also have point \(A\) lying on the hyperbola, so \(x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1\).

So, perhaps we can write \(BD^2\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\), and then maximize it subject to the constraints.

But since points \(A\) and \(B\) are related via the perpendicularity condition, we can express \(u\) and \(v\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\), or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize \(A\) as \((x, y)\), then express \(B\) as a point such that \(xu + yv = 0\), and both \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the hyperbola.

So, let's fix point \(A = (x, y)\) on the hyperbola. Then, point \(B = (u, v)\) must satisfy:

1. \(\frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1\)
2. \(xu + yv = 0\)

We can solve for \(u\) and \(v\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\). Let me attempt that.

From equation (2): \(xu + yv = 0\), we can write \(v = -\frac{x}{y} u\)

Substitute this into equation (1):

\(\frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{(-\frac{x}{y} u)^2}{24} = 1\)

Simplify:

\(\frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{x^2 u^2}{24 y^2} = 1\)

Factor out \(u^2\):

\(u^2 \left( \frac{1}{20} - \frac{x^2}{24 y^2} \right) = 1\)

So,

\(u^2 = \frac{1}{\left( \frac{1}{20} - \frac{x^2}{24 y^2} \right)}\)

Simplify the denominator:

Compute \(\frac{1}{20} - \frac{x^2}{24 y^2}\):

Find a common denominator, which is 120 y^2:

\(\frac{6 y^2}{120 y^2} - \frac{5 x^2}{120 y^2} = \frac{6 y^2 - 5 x^2}{120 y^2}\)

So,

\(u^2 = \frac{120 y^2}{6 y^2 - 5 x^2}\)

Similarly, since \(v = -\frac{x}{y} u\), we can write:

\(v^2 = \frac{x^2}{y^2} u^2 = \frac{x^2}{y^2} \times \frac{120 y^2}{6 y^2 - 5 x^2} = \frac{120 x^2}{6 y^2 - 5 x^2}\)

Therefore, \(BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2) = 4\left( \frac{120 y^2}{6 y^2 - 5 x^2} + \frac{120 x^2}{6 y^2 - 5 x^2} \right) = 4 \times \frac{120(y^2 + x^2)}{6 y^2 - 5 x^2}\)

So,

\(BD^2 = \frac{480(x^2 + y^2)}{6 y^2 - 5 x^2}\)

But we also know that \(A\) lies on the hyperbola, so \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), so \(x^2 = 20\left(1 + \frac{y^2}{24}\right) = 20 + \frac{5 y^2}{3}\)

So, \(x^2 + y^2 = 20 + \frac{5 y^2}{3} + y^2 = 20 + \frac{8 y^2}{3}\)

Similarly, \(6 y^2 - 5 x^2 = 6 y^2 - 5 \times \left(20 + \frac{5 y^2}{3}\right) = 6 y^2 - 100 - \frac{25 y^2}{3} = (6 - 25/3)y^2 - 100 = (18/3 - 25/3)y^2 -100 = (-7/3)y^2 -100\)

So, substituting back into \(BD^2\):

\(BD^2 = \frac{480 \times (20 + \frac{8 y^2}{3})}{- \frac{7}{3} y^2 - 100}\)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \(480 \times \left(20 + \frac{8 y^2}{3}\right) = 480 \times 20 + 480 \times \frac{8 y^2}{3} = 9600 + 1280 y^2\)

Denominator: \(- \frac{7}{3} y^2 - 100 = -\left( \frac{7}{3} y^2 + 100 \right)\)

So,

\(BD^2 = \frac{9600 + 1280 y^2}{ - \left( \frac{7}{3} y^2 + 100 \right) } = - \frac{9600 + 1280 y^2}{ \frac{7}{3} y^2 + 100 } \)

But \(BD^2\) is a squared distance, so it must be positive. Therefore, the negative sign indicates that the denominator is negative, so we can write:

\(BD^2 = \frac{9600 + 1280 y^2}{ \frac{7}{3} y^2 + 100 } \times (-1)\), but since \(BD^2\) is positive, we can write:

\(BD^2 = \frac{9600 + 1280 y^2}{ \frac{7}{3} y^2 + 100 } \times \frac{3}{7} \) to make the denominator positive.

Wait, actually, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, denominator is \(- \frac{7}{3} y^2 - 100\), which is negative because \(y^2\) is positive, so denominator is negative. So, \(BD^2\) is equal to:

\( \frac{9600 + 1280 y^2}{ - \frac{7}{3} y^2 - 100 } \)

But both numerator and denominator are negative, so \(BD^2\) is positive.

So, let's write:

\(BD^2 = \frac{9600 + 1280 y^2}{ - \frac{7}{3} y^2 - 100 } = \frac{9600 + 1280 y^2}{ - ( \frac{7}{3} y^2 + 100 ) } = - \frac{9600 + 1280 y^2}{ \frac{7}{3} y^2 + 100 } \)

But this is negative, which is impossible because \(BD^2\) is a squared distance. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in signs.

Wait, let's retrace.

We had:

\(u^2 = \frac{120 y^2}{6 y^2 - 5 x^2}\)

Since \(A\) lies on the hyperbola, \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), so \(x^2 = 20 + \frac{5 y^2}{3}\)

So, \(6 y^2 - 5 x^2 = 6 y^2 - 5*(20 + 5 y^2 /3 ) = 6 y^2 - 100 - 25 y^2 /3 = (18 y^2 -25 y^2)/3 -100 = (-7 y^2)/3 -100 = - (7 y^2 /3 + 100)\)

Thus, \(u^2 = 120 y^2 / (- (7 y^2 /3 + 100 )) = - 120 y^2 / (7 y^2 /3 + 100 )\)

But \(u^2\) must be positive, so the numerator and denominator must have the same sign. Since the denominator is negative (as \(7 y^2 /3 + 100\) is positive), the numerator must also be negative, so:

\(u^2 = - 120 y^2 / (7 y^2 /3 + 100 )\)

But \(u^2\) is positive, so:

\(- 120 y^2 / (7 y^2 /3 + 100 ) > 0\)

Which implies that the numerator and denominator must have the same sign. Since the denominator is positive (always), the numerator must also be positive. But numerator is \(-120 y^2\), which is negative unless \(y = 0\), but \(y\) can't be zero because then the hyperbola equation would give \(x^2 /20 =1\), so \(x = \pm \sqrt{20}\), but then vectors would be along the x-axis, which would make \(BD\) zero, but rhombus can't have zero area.

Wait, this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, in the expression for \(BD^2\), I had:

\(BD^2 = \frac{480(x^2 + y^2)}{6 y^2 - 5 x^2}\)

But from the hyperbola equation, \(x^2 = 20 + \frac{5 y^2}{3}\). So, substituting that into \(BD^2\):

\(BD^2 = \frac{480(20 + \frac{5 y^2}{3} + y^2)}{6 y^2 - 5*(20 + \frac{5 y^2}{3})}\)

Simplify numerator:

\(20 + \frac{5 y^2}{3} + y^2 = 20 + \frac{8 y^2}{3}\)

Denominator:

\(6 y^2 - 100 - \frac{25 y^2}{3} = (6 - 25/3) y^2 -100 = (-7/3) y^2 -100\)

So,

\(BD^2 = \frac{480*(20 + 8 y^2 /3)}{ -7 y^2 /3 -100 }\)

Which is the same as before.

So, \(BD^2 = \frac{480*(20 + 8 y^2 /3)}{ - (7 y^2 /3 + 100 ) } = - \frac{480*(20 + 8 y^2 /3)}{7 y^2 /3 + 100 }\)

But since \(BD^2\) must be positive, the negative sign suggests that perhaps I have a miscalculation in signs somewhere.

Wait, let me check the substitution step again. We had \(u^2 = \frac{120 y^2}{6 y^2 -5 x^2}\). Since \(6 y^2 -5 x^2 = - (7 y^2 /3 + 100 )\), so \(u^2 = -120 y^2 / (7 y^2 /3 + 100 )\). But \(u^2\) must be positive, so this suggests that the numerator must also be negative, which it is if \(y^2\) is positive, which it is. Therefore, \(u^2 = -120 y^2 / (7 y^2 /3 + 100 )\), but since \(y^2\) is positive, numerator is negative, denominator is positive, so overall \(u^2\) is negative, which is impossible.

Therefore, perhaps I made a wrong substitution.

Wait, let's retrace:

From the hyperbola equation: \(x^2 = 20 + (5 y^2)/3\)

From the perpendicularity condition: \(xu + yv = 0\)

Expressed as \(v = -x u / y\)

Substituted into hyperbola equation for \(B\):

\(u^2 /20 - (x^2 u^2 / y^2)/24 =1\)

So,

\(u^2 /20 - (x^2 /24)(u^2 / y^2) =1\)

Factor out \(u^2\):

\(u^2 (1/20 - x^2/(24 y^2))=1\)

So,

\(u^2 = 1 / (1/20 - x^2/(24 y^2))\)

Compute denominator:

\(1/20 - x^2/(24 y^2)\)

Expressed in terms of \(y^2\):

Since \(x^2 =20 + (5 y^2)/3\), plug that in:

Denominator becomes:

\(1/20 - (20 + 5 y^2 /3)/(24 y^2)\)

Compute:

\(1/20 - [20/(24 y^2) + (5 y^2)/(24 y^2 *3) ] = 1/20 - [5/(6 y^2) + 5/(72) ]\)

Simplify:

\(1/20 - 5/(6 y^2) - 5/72\)

Convert to common denominators:

Compute 1/20 -5/72:

Compute 1/20 = 18/360, 5/72 =25/360, so 18/360 -25/360= -7/360

So,

Denominator: -7/(360) -5/(6 y^2 )

Therefore,

\(u^2 = 1 / ( -7/(360) -5/(6 y^2 ) ) = 1 / [ - (7/(360) +5/(6 y^2 )) ] = -1 / (7/(360) +5/(6 y^2 ))\)

So, \(u^2 = -1 / (7/(360) +5/(6 y^2 ))\)

But \(u^2\) must be positive, so the denominator must be negative:

\(7/(360) +5/(6 y^2 ) < 0\)

But both terms are positive because \(y^2\) is positive. Therefore, denominator is positive, so \(u^2\) is negative, which is impossible.

This suggests that there is no such point \(B\) for any point \(A\), but that's not true because we can have rhombi, for example, when \(A\) is at a certain position.

Therefore, perhaps my entire approach is flawed.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption by parametrizing both points \(A\) and \(B\) with hyperbolic functions. Maybe it's better to use coordinates.

Wait, another idea: since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the coordinates of the rhombus can be expressed as \(A = (a, b)\), \(B = (-b, a)\) because they are perpendicular. Wait, let me see.

Wait, if \(A = (a, b)\), then \(B\) should satisfy \(a*(-b) + b*a =0\), which is \(-ab + ab =0\), so that holds. So, in that case, \(B = (-b, a)\). But then, does \(B\) lie on the hyperbola?

So, plugging \(B = (-b, a)\) into the hyperbola equation:

\(\frac{(-b)^2}{20} - \frac{a^2}{24} =1\)

Which is same as \(\frac{b^2}{20} - \frac{a^2}{24}=1\), same as for point \(A\). So, that's consistent.

Therefore, if \(A = (a, b)\) lies on the hyperbola, then \(B = (-b, a)\) also lies on the hyperbola if and only if:

\(\frac{b^2}{20} - \frac{a^2}{24} =1\)

Which is the same as the equation for \(A\). So, this is consistent.

Therefore, in this case, points \(A = (a, b)\) and \(B = (-b, a)\) both lie on the hyperbola, and vectors \(OA\) and \(OB\) are perpendicular.

Thus, the rhombus is determined by these two points, and the other two points are \(C = (-a, -b)\) and \(D = (b, -a)\).

Therefore, in this parametrization, points \(A = (a, b)\) and \(B = (-b, a)\), and the diagonals are \(AC\) and \(BD\), which intersect at the origin.

Thus, the length \(BD\) is the distance between \(B = (-b, a)\) and \(D = (b, -a)\). So,

\(BD^2 = (b - (-b))^2 + (-a - a)^2 = (2b)^2 + (-2a)^2 =4b^2 +4a^2=4(a^2 + b^2)\)

Therefore, \(BD^2 =4(a^2 + b^2)\)

But point \(A = (a, b)\) lies on the hyperbola, so \(\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24}=1\)

Thus, \(a^2 =20 + \frac{24}{24}b^2 =20 + \frac{5}{6}b^2\). Wait, no:

From \(\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24}=1\), so \(a^2 =20(1 + \frac{b^2}{24}) =20 + \frac{20}{24}b^2 =20 + \frac{5}{6}b^2\)

Therefore, \(a^2 + b^2 =20 + \frac{5}{6}b^2 + b^2=20 + \frac{11}{6}b^2\)

Thus, \(BD^2 =4(20 + \frac{11}{6}b^2 )=80 + \frac{44}{6}b^2 =80 + \frac{22}{3}b^2\)

So, \(BD^2 =80 + \frac{22}{3}b^2\)

Our goal is to find the supremum of \(BD^2\) over all real numbers \(b\) such that \(A = (a, b)\) lies on the hyperbola.

But in the hyperbola equation, \(a^2 =20 + \frac{5}{6}b^2\), so \(a\) is real for all real \(b\). However, the point \(A\) must lie on the hyperbola, so we can have any real \(b\), which would make \(a\) real as well.

Therefore, \(b^2\) can be any non-negative real number, so as \(b^2 \to \infty\), \(BD^2 \to \infty\). Therefore, \(BD^2\) can be made arbitrarily large, meaning there is no upper bound. Therefore, the supremum is infinity.

But the question asks for the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. But if \(BD^2\) can be made arbitrarily large, then there is no such real number. But that can't be, since the question is asking for a specific number.

Wait, maybe I missed a constraint. The problem says that diagonals intersect at the origin, but does it specify that the rhombus is convex? Or perhaps that the rhombus is non-degenerate?

Wait, in this case, the rhombus can be made as large as we want by taking points \(A\) and \(B\) further and further away along the hyperbola.

But in reality, hyperbola branches go to infinity, so points can be placed infinitely far apart, leading to diagonals \(BD\) being infinitely long.

Wait, but perhaps the rhombus is required to be such that all four points lie on the hyperbola. But in our case, as long as points \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the hyperbola, \(C\) and \(D\) are just reflections, so they lie on the hyperbola as well.

Wait, but if \(A = (a, b)\) and \(B = (-b, a)\), then \(C = (-a, -b)\) and \(D = (b, -a)\). So, if \(A\) is on the hyperbola, then \(C\) is also on the hyperbola. Similarly, \(B\) and \(D\) are related by the same parametrization.

Therefore, in this parametrization, all four points lie on the hyperbola, and as \(b\) increases, \(BD^2\) increases without bound. So, yes, \(BD^2\) can be made as large as desired.

But the question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. If \(BD^2\) can be made arbitrarily large, then the supremum is infinity, but since it's not attainable, there is no real number that is less than all \(BD^2\). So, perhaps the answer is that no such real number exists, but that contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in parametrizing \(B\) as \((-b, a)\). Maybe the correct parametrization is different.

Wait, earlier, I thought of parametrizing \(A\) as \((\sqrt{20} \cosh \theta, \sqrt{24} \sinh \theta)\), but perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, let me think differently.

Given that \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the hyperbola and their position vectors are perpendicular, we can use the concept of reciprocal bases or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps using the parametrization where \(A = (a, b)\) and \(B = (-b, a)\), as above, and then \(BD^2 =4(a^2 + b^2)\), with \(a^2 =20 + \frac{5}{6}b^2\). Therefore, \(BD^2 =80 + \frac{22}{3}b^2\). Therefore, \(BD^2\) can be written as \(80 + k b^2\), where \(k = 22/3\), so as \(b\) increases, \(BD^2\) increases without bound.

Thus, the supremum is infinity, meaning there is no finite real number that is less than all \(BD^2\). Therefore, the answer is that such a number does not exist. But the problem says "Find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi." So, it's expecting a specific number.

Wait, maybe I got the definition of the rhombus wrong. Maybe all four points must lie on the hyperbola, but perhaps the diagonals intersect at the origin, but the rhombus isn't necessarily symmetric about the origin?

Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so if they intersect at the origin, the rhombus must be symmetric about the origin. So, the points \(A\) and \(C\) are symmetric, as are \(B\) and \(D\). Therefore, if \(A = (a, b)\), then \(C = (-a, -b)\), and if \(B = (c, d)\), then \(D = (-c, -d)\).

But in our case, we've defined \(B = (-b, a)\), so then \(D = (b, -a)\). So, points \(A = (a, b)\), \(B = (-b, a)\), \(C = (-a, -b)\), \(D = (b, -a)\). So, this is consistent with the rhombus being symmetric about the origin.

But in this case, the two diagonals are \(AC\) and \(BD\). Diagonal \(AC\) has length \(2 \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\), and diagonal \(BD\) has length \(2 \sqrt{(a - (-a))^2 + (b - (-b))^2}\), wait, no.

Wait, the coordinates of \(B\) and \(D\) are \((-b, a)\) and \((b, -a)\). So, the vector \(BD\) is from \((-b, a)\) to \((b, -a)\), so the distance is \(\sqrt{(b - (-b))^2 + (-a - a)^2} = \sqrt{(2b)^2 + (-2a)^2} = \sqrt{4b^2 +4a^2} = 2 \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Therefore, \(BD^2 =4(a^2 + b^2)\), as previously established.

But since \(BD^2 =4(a^2 + b^2)\), and \(a^2 =20 + \frac{5}{6}b^2\), so \(BD^2 =4(20 + \frac{5}{6}b^2 + b^2 )=4(20 + \frac{11}{6}b^2 )=80 + \frac{22}{3}b^2\). So, as \(b^2\) increases, \(BD^2\) increases without bound.

Therefore, \(BD^2\) can be made arbitrarily large, so there is no upper bound. Therefore, the supremum is infinity.

But the question is asking for the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. If \(BD^2\) can be made larger than any real number, then there is no such real number. But perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in three dimensions? No, it's in the plane.

Wait, another thought: maybe the hyperbola is only one branch, so points \(A\) and \(B\) must lie on the same branch? But the hyperbola equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} =1\) is a hyperbola opening along the x-axis, so it has two separate branches. Therefore, points \(A\) and \(B\) can be on different branches.

But in our parametrization earlier, point \(B = (-b, a)\) may lie on a different branch.

Wait, if \(A = (a, b)\) is on the right branch (positive x), then point \(B = (-b, a)\) may be on the left branch or the right branch depending on the value of \(a\) and \(b\). Let me check.

Suppose \(A = (a, b)\) is on the right branch, so \(a >0\). Then, \(B = (-b, a)\). So, if \(a >0\), then the x-coordinate of \(B\) is \(-b\). So, if \(b\) is positive, \(-b\) is negative, so \(B\) is on the left branch. If \(b\) is negative, \(-b\) is positive, so \(B\) is on the right branch.

Therefore, \(A\) and \(B\) can be on different branches.

But in our earlier analysis, we considered \(B\) as \((-b, a)\) regardless of the branch, but in reality, if \(A\) is on the right branch, \(B\) is on the left branch if \(b >0\), and on the right branch if \(b <0\). Therefore, depending on the sign of \(b\), \(B\) can be on different branches.

But since \(b\) can be any real number, positive or negative, the analysis remains the same.

Therefore, \(BD^2 =80 + \frac{22}{3}b^2\), which can be made as large as desired by taking \(b\) to infinity. Therefore, \(BD^2\) is unbounded above.

But the problem says "rhombus \(ABCD\) is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin". There is no restriction on the size of the rhombus. Therefore, \(BD^2\) can be made arbitrarily large, so there's no finite upper bound.

But the problem is asking for "the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi." If \(BD^2\) can be made larger than any real number, then no such real number exists, but the problem expects an answer, so perhaps my reasoning is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the infimum of \(BD^2\), but the question says the supremum.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again: "Find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi." So, this is the infimum of \(BD^2\), but phrased as the supremum of the lower bounds.

Wait, actually, if we are to find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi, that would be the infimum of \(BD^2\), because it's the greatest lower bound. But the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi", which is the supremum of all lower bounds, which is the infimum of \(BD^2\).

Wait, let me clarify.

Suppose \(L\) is the greatest real number such that \(L < BD^2\) for all rhombi. Then, \(L\) must be the supremum of all such \(L\), which would be the infimum of \(BD^2\). Because if \(L\) is less than all \(BD^2\), then \(L\) can't exceed the smallest \(BD^2\). So, the greatest such \(L\) is the infimum of \(BD^2\).

But earlier, we saw that \(BD^2 =80 + \frac{22}{3}b^2\), which is minimized when \(b=0\). So, the minimum value of \(BD^2\) is 80.

Therefore, the infimum of \(BD^2\) is 80, and since \(BD^2\) can be made as large as desired, the supremum is infinity.

Therefore, the greatest real number \(L\) such that \(L < BD^2\) for all such rhombi is \(L =80\), because 80 is less than all \(BD^2\) (since \(BD^2 \geq80\)), and any number greater than 80 would not satisfy \(L < BD^2\) for all rhombi (since when \(BD^2 =80\), which is achieved when \(b=0\), \(L\) must be less than 80, but 80 is the minimum). Wait, no, because if you take \(L =80\), then \(L\) is less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi except when \(BD^2=80\), but \(BD^2\) is always at least 80. So, 80 is the minimum value.

Wait, actually, if \(BD^2\) can be as low as 80 and as high as infinity, then the minimum is 80, and there is no maximum. So, if the question is asking for the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi, that number would be just below 80, but since 80 is achieved by some rhombus, you can't have a number less than 80 that is still less than all \(BD^2\). Because when \(BD^2=80\), any number less than 80 would not be less than 80.

Wait, so the answer is that the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is 80, but that can't be, because \(BD^2\) can be 80, so 80 is not less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi. Therefore, such a number doesn't exist. But the problem states that it does, so perhaps my reasoning is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in parametrization.

Wait, earlier, I assumed \(B = (-b, a)\), but in reality, when \(A = (a, b)\) is on the hyperbola, then \(B\) must satisfy both the hyperbola equation and the perpendicularity condition.

Wait, but in the earlier substitution, I had \(B = (-b, a)\), but that may not necessarily lie on the hyperbola unless specific conditions are met.

Wait, let me verify.

If \(A = (a, b)\) lies on the hyperbola, then \(B = (-b, a)\) must lie on the hyperbola as well.

So, plug \(B = (-b, a)\) into the hyperbola equation:

\(\frac{(-b)^2}{20} - \frac{a^2}{24} = \frac{b^2}{20} - \frac{a^2}{24}\)

But from \(A\) lying on the hyperbola, we have \(\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24}=1\). So,

\(\frac{b^2}{20} - \frac{a^2}{24} = - \left( \frac{a^2}{24} - \frac{b^2}{20} \right ) = - \left( \frac{a^2}{24} - \frac{b^2}{20} \right )\)

But from the hyperbola equation, \(\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24}=1\), so \(\frac{a^2}{24} - \frac{b^2}{20} = \frac{a^2}{24} - \frac{b^2}{20}\). Let me compute this:

Let me denote \(k = \frac{a^2}{24} - \frac{b^2}{20}\)

Then, \( \frac{b^2}{20} - \frac{a^2}{24} = -k\)

But from the hyperbola equation,

\(\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} =1\)

Multiply both sides by 60 to eliminate denominators:

\(3a^2 -5b^2 =60\)

But also, \(k = \frac{a^2}{24} - \frac{b^2}{20}\)

Multiply \(k\) by 60: \(60k = 2.5a^2 - 3b^2\)

But from the hyperbola equation, \(3a^2 -5b^2=60\), so \(2.5a^2 -3b^2= (5/2)a^2 -3b^2 = (3a^2 -5b^2) + (2.5a^2 - (-2.5b^2))? Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, let me express \(k\) in terms of the hyperbola equation.

From \(3a^2 -5b^2 =60\), we can write \(3a^2 =5b^2 +60\). Then,

\(k = \frac{a^2}{24} - \frac{b^2}{20} = \frac{5b^2 +60}{3*24} - \frac{b^2}{20}\)

Simplify:

\(k = \frac{5b^2 +60}{72} - \frac{b^2}{20}\)

Convert to common denominator, which is 360:

\(k = \frac{25b^2 +300}{360} - \frac{18b^2}{360} = \frac{25b^2 +300 -18b^2}{360} = \frac{7b^2 +300}{360}\)

Therefore,

\(k = \frac{7b^2 +300}{360}\)

Thus,

\(\frac{b^2}{20} - \frac{a^2}{24} = -k = -\frac{7b^2 +300}{360}\)

Therefore,

\(BD^2 =4(a^2 + b^2) =4a^2 +4b^2\)

But from hyperbola equation,

\(3a^2 -5b^2=60\)

Let me solve for \(a^2\):

\(3a^2 =5b^2 +60\)

\(a^2 = \frac{5b^2 +60}{3}\)

Therefore,

\(BD^2 =4a^2 +4b^2 =4\left( \frac{5b^2 +60}{3} \right ) +4b^2 = \frac{20b^2 +240}{3} +4b^2 = \frac{20b^2 +240 +12b^2}{3} = \frac{32b^2 +240}{3} = \frac{32}{3}b^2 +80\)

So, \(BD^2 = \frac{32}{3}b^2 +80\)

Therefore, as \(b^2\) increases, \(BD^2\) increases without bound. However, when \(b=0\), \(BD^2=80\). So, the minimal value of \(BD^2\) is 80, achieved when \(b=0\), and the maximum is infinity.

Therefore, the infimum of \(BD^2\) is 80, and the supremum is infinity.

But the question is to find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. If \(BD^2\) can be made as small as 80, then any number less than 80 would not be less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi, because when \(BD^2=80\), the number would have to be less than 80, but for numbers greater than 80, they would be greater than some \(BD^2\). Wait, no, if you choose a number less than 80, say 79, then for the rhombus where \(BD^2=80\), 79 is less than 80, which satisfies the condition. But for any rhombus with \(BD^2 >80\), 79 is also less than \(BD^2\). So, in that case, 79 is a real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. Similarly, 79.999 is also less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi. So, the supremum of all such numbers is 80, because for any number less than 80, you can find a rhombus where \(BD^2\) is just above that number, but 80 is the infimum.

Wait, no. If we want a real number \(L\) such that \(L < BD^2\) for all rhombi, then \(L\) must be less than 80 because when \(BD^2=80\), \(L\) must be less than 80. Similarly, if \(L\) is less than 80, say 79, then for all rhombi, \(BD^2\) is at least 80, so \(79 <80 \leq BD^2\), hence \(79 < BD^2\). Therefore, 79 is such a number. Similarly, any number less than 80 is less than all \(BD^2\).

But the question is to find the greatest real number with this property. The greatest such \(L\) is 80, but 80 is not less than all \(BD^2\), because when \(BD^2=80\), \(L=80\) is not less than \(BD^2=80\). Therefore, 80 is excluded. Therefore, the supremum is 80, but it's not attainable. So, the greatest real number less than all \(BD^2\) is 80, but since \(BD^2\) can be 80, \(L=80\) is not less than all \(BD^2\). Therefore, the answer should be 80.

Wait, but actually, if \(BD^2\) can be equal to 80, then any \(L\) less than 80 is less than all \(BD^2\). Therefore, the supremum of such \(L\) is 80, but since 80 is not less than all \(BD^2\), the answer is 80.

But wait, the supremum of all such \(L\) is 80, but since 80 is not less than all \(BD^2\), does that mean 80 is the supremum but not the maximum? So, the supremum is 80, but it is not achieved.

But in the problem statement, it's about the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. So, 80 is the least upper bound, but it's not less than all \(BD^2\). Therefore, the answer is 80.

But earlier, in the parametrization, when \(b=0\), \(BD^2=80\), so that rhombus has \(BD^2=80\). Therefore, any real number less than 80 is less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi, but 80 is not less than all \(BD^2\). Therefore, the supremum of all such numbers is 80, but since 80 is not less than all \(BD^2\), the greatest number that is less than all \(BD^2\) is 80.

Wait, but actually, if 80 is the minimal \(BD^2\), then for any \(L <80\), \(L < BD^2\) for all rhombi, because \(BD^2\) is at least 80. But 80 itself is not less than all \(BD^2\), only less than or equal. So, 80 is the infimum, and any \(L <80\) satisfies \(L <BD^2\) for all rhombi.

Therefore, the greatest real number \(L\) such that \(L <BD^2\) for all rhombi is 80, since for any \(L >80\), there exists a rhombus with \(BD^2=80\), so \(L\) is not less than all rhombi.

Wait, that makes sense. So, 80 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than all \(BD^2\) is 80, because for any \(L >80\), there exists a rhombus where \(BD^2=80\), which is less than \(L\), so \(L\) is not less than all \(BD^2\). But 80 is less than or equal to all \(BD^2\), so the greatest number less than all \(BD^2\) is 80, but since it's equal for some rhombi, 80 is not less than all \(BD^2\). Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 80, since 80 is the minimal \(BD^2\), and since \(BD^2\) cannot be less than 80, the greatest number less than all \(BD^2\) is just below 80, but since 80 is the infimum, it's the limit. However, 80 is not less than all \(BD^2\) because there exists \(BD^2=80\). Therefore, the maximum lower bound is 80, but since 80 isn't less than all \(BD^2\), the answer is 80.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 80, but I need to make sure.

Wait, if \(BD^2\) can be made arbitrarily large and cannot be less than 80, then 80 is the smallest value of \(BD^2\). So, any number less than 80 is less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi, but 80 is not less than all \(BD^2\) because there is a rhombus with \(BD^2=80\). Therefore, the supremum of all numbers less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi is 80, but since 80 isn't less than all \(BD^2\), the answer is 80.

But actually, 80 is the minimal value of \(BD^2\). Therefore, the infimum of \(BD^2\) is 80, and the supremum is infinity. So, the numbers that are less than all \(BD^2\) are the numbers less than or equal to 80. Therefore, the greatest such number is 80.

But since \(BD^2\) can be equal to 80, the number 80 is not less than all \(BD^2\), because for that rhombus, \(BD^2=80\), so 80 is not less than 80. Therefore, the supremum of all numbers less than all \(BD^2\) is 80, but it's not attainable. Thus, the answer is 80.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi." So, if such a number exists, which is the supremum of all numbers less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi. Since \(BD^2\) can be as small as 80 and as large as infinity, then the supremum of the set of numbers less than \(BD^2\) is infinity, but that's not the case.

Wait, no, the supremum of the numbers less than all \(BD^2\) is the infimum of \(BD^2\), which is 80. Because any number less than 80 is less than all \(BD^2\), and 80 is the greatest number with this property because any number greater than 80 is not less than all \(BD^2\) (since when \(BD^2=80\), numbers greater than 80 are greater than 80). Therefore, the answer is 80.

But wait, actually, 80 is not less than all \(BD^2\), because when \(BD^2=80\), 80 is not less than 80. So, the supremum is 80, but it's not less than all \(BD^2\). So, is 80 the answer? Or is the answer something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe I've made a mistake in calculations earlier.

Wait, in the parametrization where \(B = (-b, a)\), we found that \(BD^2 =80 + \frac{22}{3}b^2\). But that was under the assumption that \(B = (-b, a)\). But actually, for a general point \(B\), the condition \(A \cdot B =0\) may result in a different \(BD^2\). Therefore, the calculation of \(BD^2 =80 + \frac{22}{3}b^2\) is only for this specific parametrization.

But perhaps there are other rhombi where \(BD^2\) is smaller than 80. So, maybe 80 is not the minimal.

Wait, but in the parametrization \(A = (a, b)\) and \(B = (-b, a)\), we derived \(BD^2 =80 + \frac{22}{3}b^2\), which is minimized when \(b=0\), giving \(BD^2=80\). So, in this parametrization, 80 is the minimal. But perhaps in another configuration, \(BD^2\) can be smaller.

But since we have an expression for \(BD^2\) in terms of \(b\), and since it's minimized at \(b=0\), which is 80, and increases as \(b\) increases, then in this parametrization, 80 is indeed the minimal.

Therefore, the minimal \(BD^2\) is 80, so 80 is the infimum.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi is 80, since for any number greater than 80, there exists a rhombus with \(BD^2=80\), so that number is not less than all \(BD^2\). But 80 is not less than all \(BD^2\) because when \(BD^2=80\), 80 is equal to \(BD^2\). Therefore, 80 is the greatest number that is less than or equal to all \(BD^2\), but not less than all.

Wait, but the question is about being less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi, so 80 is not less than \(BD^2\) when \(BD^2=80\), so it's not acceptable. Therefore, the answer should be 80, but not included.

But in real numbers, there is no maximum number less than 80, because for any number less than 80, say 80 - ε, we can have a rhombus with \(BD^2=80\), so 80 - ε is less than 80, but greater than 80 - δ for smaller δ. So, the supremum is 80, but it's not attainable.

Therefore, the answer is 80.

But considering that 80 is the infimum, the greatest real number less than all \(BD^2\) is 80, but it's not less than all \(BD^2\). So, perhaps the answer is 80.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is 80.

Wait, let me think differently.

Given that \(BD^2 =80 + \frac{22}{3}b^2\), which is minimized at \(b=0\), so \(BD^2 \geq80\). So, the minimal value is 80, and the supremum is infinity.

Therefore, the set of \(BD^2\) is \([80, \infty)\). Therefore, the supremum of all lower bounds is 80, so the greatest real number less than all \(BD^2\) is 80.

But since \(BD^2\) can be equal to 80, the number 80 is not less than all \(BD^2\). Therefore, the answer is 80, but since it's not less, maybe the answer is 80.

But actually, in real numbers, the supremum of all numbers less than all \(BD^2\) is 80, because for any \(L <80\), you can find a rhombus with \(BD^2\) just above \(L\), but 80 is the least upper bound for such \(L\). Since 80 is the infimum, it's the maximum such lower bound.

Therefore, the answer is 80.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{80}
</think>

Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

1. **Hyperbola Equation**: The given hyperbola is \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\).
2. **Rhombus Properties**: The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin and are perpendicular. The vertices \(A, B, C, D\) lie on the hyperbola.
3. **Coordinates and Perpendicularity**: Let \(A = (x, y)\) and \(B = (u, v)\). The condition for perpendicularity gives \(xu + yv = 0\).
4. **Hyperbola Substitution**: Points \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the hyperbola, so \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) and \(\frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1\).
5. **Distance Calculation**: The length \(BD\) is calculated as \(BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\).
6. **Parametrization**: Using hyperbola parametrization, points \(A\) and \(B\) can be expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions. However, this approach was found to be complex.
7. **Alternative Parametrization**: Considering points \(A = (a, b)\) and \(B = (-b, a)\), we derived the expression for \(BD^2\).
8. **Result**: The expression for \(BD^2\) was simplified to \(80 + \frac{22}{3}b^2\), which is minimized when \(b = 0\), giving \(BD^2 = 80\).

Thus, the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is the infimum of \(BD^2\), which is 80.

\[
\boxed{80}
