Question:
A list of positive integers has the following properties:

\bullet The sum of the items in the list is 30.

\bullet The unique mode of the list is 9.

\bullet The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Correct Answer:
The third condition implies that the list's size must be an even number, as if it were an odd number, the median of the list would surely appear in the list itself. Therefore, we can casework on what even numbers work.

Say the size is 2. Clearly, this doesn't work as the only list would be {9, 9}, which doesn't satisfy condition 1.

If the size is 4, then we can have two 9s, and a remaining sum of 12. Since the other two values in the list must be distinct, and their sum must equal 30-18=12, we have that the two numbers are in the form a and 12-a. Note that we cannot have both values greater than 9, and we cannot have only one value greater than 9, because this would make the median 9, which violates condition 3. Since the median of the list is a positive integer, this means that the greater of a and 12-a must be an odd number. The only valid solution to this is a=5. Thus, our answer is 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 236.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in a list of positive integers. The list has some specific properties:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9, meaning 9 appears more times than any other number in the list, and no other number has the same frequency as 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the mode is the number that appears most frequently. Since the mode is 9 and it's unique, 9 must appear at least twice, and more times than any other number. So, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times.

Next, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from least to greatest. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one; if it's even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer, so if the list has an odd number of elements, the middle number must be an integer. If it's even, the average of the two middle numbers must also be an integer, which implies that both middle numbers are either both even or both odd.

Also, since the median doesn't appear in the list, that gives some constraints on the possible numbers in the list. Let me note that down.

Now, let me think about how long the list can be. The sum is 30, so the average value is 30 divided by the number of elements. Let me denote the number of elements as n. So, the average is 30/n. Since all elements are positive integers, n must be at least 1, but realistically, it can't be too small because the mode is 9, which needs to appear multiple times.

Let me consider possible values of n. If n is too large, the sum of 30 might not be achievable without repeating numbers too much, which could conflict with the mode being unique at 9.

Let me start by considering n=5. If n=5, the median is the 3rd number. So, the 3rd number is a positive integer not in the list. The sum is 30. Let me try to construct such a list.

But before that, let me note that since 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice. So, in a list of 5 elements, 9 can appear 3 times, which would make it the mode. Let's try that.

So, let's say the list is [a, b, 9, d, e], ordered. The median is 9, but the problem states that the median does not appear in the list. So, if n=5, the median is the 3rd element, which is 9, but 9 is in the list. That violates the condition. So, n cannot be 5.

Similarly, if n=6, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. Let's say the list is [a, b, c, d, e, f], ordered. The median is (c + d)/2, which is an integer. So, c and d must be both even or both odd. Also, the median is a positive integer not appearing in the list, so (c + d)/2 is not equal to any of a, b, c, d, e, f.

Also, 9 is the mode, so 9 appears more times than any other number. Let's think about how 9 can appear. If n=6, 9 can appear at least 3 times. Let's try that.

So, let's have three 9s. Then, the list would look something like [a, b, 9, 9, 9, f], but we have to ensure that the median is not 9 and that 9 is the unique mode.

Wait, if three 9s are in the list, then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. If the list is ordered, the 3rd element could be 9 or not. If the 3rd element is 9, then the median is at least 9, but it needs to be an integer not in the list. So, if the median is 9, but 9 is in the list, that's not allowed. Therefore, the 3rd element can't be 9. So, let's adjust that.

So, maybe the list is [a, b, c, 9, 9, f], where c is less than 9, and f is greater than 9. Then, the median is (c + 9)/2. This median must be an integer not in the list. So, (c + 9)/2 must be an integer, so c must be odd because 9 is odd, and odd + odd is even, so (c + 9)/2 is integer.

Also, this median must not be in the list. So, (c + 9)/2 is not equal to a, b, c, 9, or f.

Let me try to assign some numbers. Since 9 is the mode, it appears three times, so let me have 9 appear three times. So, the list has [a, b, c, 9, 9, f], with c < 9 and f > 9.

Sum of the list is a + b + c + 9 + 9 + f = 30, so a + b + c + f = 12.

Also, we have to choose a, b, c, f such that c is less than 9, f is greater than 9, and a, b are positive integers less than c, and f is a positive integer greater than 9.

Also, the median is (c + 9)/2, which is an integer not in the list.

Let me denote m = (c + 9)/2. So, m is an integer not in [a, b, c, 9, 9, f].

Also, since the list is ordered, a <= b <= c <= 9 <= 9 <= f.

So, m is the median, so it lies between c and 9, right? Because the 3rd element is c, and the 4th is 9, so the average is somewhere between c and 9.

Wait, if c < 9, then (c + 9)/2 is between c and 9. So, m is between c and 9.

But m must not be in the list. So, m is not equal to a, b, c, 9, or f.

But m is between c and 9, so if c is less than 9, m is between c and 9. So, c < m < 9.

But m is an integer, so c < m < 9. So, m is at least c + 1 and at most 8.

But m must not be in the list, so m can't be a, b, c, 9, or f.

But m is between c and 9, so m could be one of the numbers between c and 9, but it's not in the list. So, that means that all integers between c and 9 must not be in the list, except maybe some that are not necessarily in the list.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again.

The list is [a, b, c, 9, 9, f], ordered. So, a <= b <= c <= 9 <= 9 <= f.

The median is (c + 9)/2, which is an integer m. So, m is not in the list. So, m cannot be equal to a, b, c, 9, or f.

But m is between c and 9, so it's greater than c and less than 9.

Therefore, m must not be in [a, b, c, 9, f], but it's between c and 9, so m is not equal to any of those numbers.

But wait, the numbers between c and 9 must not be in the list. So, for example, if c=7, then m=8, which must not be in the list. So, 8 cannot be in [a, b, c, 9, f]. So, a, b, c=7, 9, f must not include 8.

Similarly, if c=5, m=7, so 7 must not be in the list.

So, in this case, let's attempt to construct such a list.

We have a + b + c + f = 12.

c must be less than 9, so c can be at most 8.

But also, m = (c + 9)/2 must be an integer, so c must be odd, as 9 is odd. So, c can be 1, 3, 5, 7.

Let's try c=7. Then, m=(7 + 9)/2=8. So, 8 must not be in the list.

So, our list is [a, b, 7, 9, 9, f], with a + b + 7 + f = 12, so a + b + f = 5.

Since a and b are positive integers less than or equal to 7, and f is greater than 9.

But a + b + f = 5, and a, b, f are positive integers with a <= b <=7 and f >=10.

Wait, but a, b >=1, so minimum a + b is 2, which would mean f=3. But f must be >=10. So, impossible.

Therefore, c=7 is not possible because a + b + f =5 is too small.

Next, try c=5. Then, m=(5 + 9)/2=7. So, 7 must not be in the list.

So, our list is [a, b, 5, 9, 9, f], with a + b + 5 + f = 12, so a + b + f =7.

Again, a and b are at least 1, so a + b >=2, which would make f=5. But f must be >=10. So, f=5 is invalid because f must be at least 10. So, c=5 is also impossible.

Next, c=3. Then, m=(3 +9)/2=6. So, 6 must not be in the list.

So, list is [a, b, 3, 9, 9, f], with a + b + 3 + f =12, so a + b + f=9.

a and b are positive integers, a <= b <=3, and f >=10.

But a + b >=2, so f=7, which is less than 10. Not allowed.

So, c=3 is impossible.

Next, c=1. Then, m=(1 +9)/2=5. So, 5 must not be in the list.

So, list is [a, b, 1, 9, 9, f], with a + b +1 + f =12, so a + b + f=11.

a and b are positive integers, a <= b <=1, so a=1 and b=1, which makes f=9. But f must be >=10, so f=9 is invalid. Therefore, c=1 is impossible.

So, all possible c values (1,3,5,7) for n=6 lead to contradictions. Therefore, n=6 is not possible.

Wait, maybe n=7? Let me check n=7.

If n=7, the median is the 4th element. So, the 4th element is a positive integer not in the list. Also, 9 is the mode, so it must appear more times than any other number.

In a list of 7 elements, for 9 to be the unique mode, it needs to appear at least three times. So, let me assume 9 appears three times.

So, the list is [a, b, c, d, e, f, g], ordered. The median is d, which is not in the list. So, d is an integer not equal to any of a, b, c, d, e, f, g.

Wait, actually, in the list, d is the median, so it's the 4th element, which is not in the list. Therefore, d is not equal to a, b, c, e, f, g.

Also, 9 is the mode, so it appears at least three times. Let me have three 9s.

So, the list is [a, b, c, d, 9, f, g], with a <= b <= c <= d <=9 <= f <= g.

Wait, but the median is d, which is not in the list. So, d is not equal to a, b, c, 9, f, or g. But d is between c and 9, so d must be greater than c and less than 9.

Also, 9 is the mode, so 9 appears three times. So, maybe the list is [a, b, c, d, 9, 9, 9]. But then, the median is d, which is not in the list. So, d is not equal to a, b, c, 9, but d is between c and 9. So, d must be greater than c and less than 9, and not equal to a, b, c, or 9.

So, let me try to construct such a list.

Sum of the list: a + b + c + d + 9 + 9 + 9 = 30. So, a + b + c + d + 27 =30. Therefore, a + b + c + d=3.

But a, b, c, d are positive integers, so minimum a + b + c + d=4 (1+1+1+1). But 4 is greater than 3, which is not possible. So, this is impossible.

Therefore, n=7 is impossible.

Wait, maybe 9 appears four times? Then, sum would be a + b + c + d +9 +9 +9 +9=30, so a + b + c + d=30 - 36= -6, which is impossible. So, n=7 is impossible.

Hmm, maybe n=8.

Wait, n=8. The median is the average of the 4th and 5th elements. Both must sum to an even number because the median is an integer. So, the 4th and 5th elements are both integers or both half-integers? Wait, no, since all elements are integers, the average of two integers is either integer or half-integer. But the median is given as a positive integer, so the average must be integer. Therefore, the 4th and 5th elements must be both even or both odd.

Also, the median is a positive integer not in the list.

So, let me think about this. The list is [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h], ordered. The median is (d + e)/2, which is an integer. So, d and e must be both even or both odd.

Also, the median is not in the list, so (d + e)/2 is not equal to any of a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h.

Also, 9 is the mode, so it appears more times than any other number. Let's say 9 appears at least three times.

So, let me try to construct such a list.

Let me assume that 9 appears three times. So, the list has three 9s. But the median is (d + e)/2, which is not in the list. So, since 9 is in the list, the median cannot be 9. Therefore, (d + e)/2 ≠9.

Alternatively, 9 could appear four times, which would still make it the mode, but let's see.

Let me try with three 9s.

So, the list is [a, b, c, d, 9, 9, 9, h], with a <= b <= c <= d <=9 <=9 <=9 <=h.

Wait, but the median is (d +9)/2, which must be an integer. So, d must be odd because 9 is odd, so d +9 is even. Therefore, d is odd.

Also, the median is (d +9)/2, which must be not in the list. So, (d +9)/2 is not equal to a, b, c, d, 9, or h.

Also, the sum is a + b + c + d +9 +9 +9 + h=30.

So, a + b + c + d + h=30 -27=3.

But a, b, c, d, h are positive integers, so the minimum sum is 5 (1+1+1+1+1). But 3 is less than 5, which is impossible. Therefore, n=8 with three 9s is impossible.

Wait, maybe 9 appears four times. So, the list is [a, b, c, d,9,9,9,9], but then the median is (d +9)/2. Since the list is ordered, d <=9. So, (d +9)/2 is at least (1 +9)/2=5 and at most (9 +9)/2=9. But the median must not be in the list. So, if d=7, then (7 +9)/2=8. So, 8 must not be in the list. So, 8 is not in [a, b, c, d,9,9,9,9]. Therefore, a, b, c, d must be less than 8, and h=9.

Sum is a + b + c + d +9 +9 +9 +9=30. So, a + b + c + d=30 - 36= -6. Impossible.

So, n=8 is impossible.

Wait, maybe n=9. Let me consider n=9.

Median is the 5th element. So, the 5th element is a positive integer not in the list. Also, 9 is the mode.

So, let's have 9 appear at least three times.

Let me assume three 9s.

So, the list is [a, b, c, d, e,9,9,9,9], with a <= b <= c <= d <= e <=9 <=9 <=9 <=9.

Median is e, which is not in the list. So, e is not equal to a, b, c, d,9.

But e is the 5th element, so it's between d and9. So, e must be greater than d and less than9. But e is not in the list, so e cannot be equal to a, b, c, d, or9.

So, let's think about how to construct this.

Sum of the list: a + b + c + d + e +9 +9 +9 +9=30.

So, a + b + c + d + e=30 -36= -6. That's impossible.

So, 9 appears three times is impossible.

Wait, maybe 9 appears four times.

So, list is [a, b, c, d, e,9,9,9,9,9], but n=10.

Wait, n=10. Median is the average of the 5th and 6th elements.

So, the median is (e +9)/2, which is an integer. Therefore, e and 9 must be both odd or both even.

Also, the median is not in the list, so (e +9)/2 is not equal to any of a, b, c, d, e,9,9,...,9.

So, let me try n=10.

Sum of the list: a + b + c + d + e +9 +9 +9 +9 +9=30. So, a + b + c + d + e=30 - 45= -15. Not possible.

Hmm, maybe n=10 is too long.

Wait, maybe n=4.

Wait, n=4. The median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements, which is an integer.

So, let's try n=4.

List is [a, b, c, d], ordered. Median is (b + c)/2, which is integer. So, b and c are both even or both odd. Also, the median is not in the list.

Also, 9 is the mode, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. In n=4, 9 must appear at least twice.

So, let me have two 9s. So, the list is [9,9, x, y], but ordered. Wait, no, if 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice, but the list is [a, b, c, d], so 9 can be in two positions.

But the median is (b + c)/2, which is integer, not in the list.

Also, the sum is a + b + c + d=30.

So, let me try.

Let me have two 9s. So, the list is [a,9,9,d], with a <=9 <=9 <=d.

Sum: a +9 +9 +d=30, so a + d=12.

Median is (9 +9)/2=9, but 9 is in the list. That's not allowed because the median must not be in the list. So, this is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe three 9s? So, the list is [9,9,9,d]. Then, the median is (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

So, n=4 is impossible.

Wait, n=5 we tried earlier, but maybe 9 appears more times?

Wait, in n=5, if 9 appears three times, the list would be [a,9,9,9,d], ordered. So, the median is the 3rd element, which is 9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

So, n=5 is impossible.

Wait, maybe n=10 is too high, but let's think differently.

Wait, perhaps n=11.

Wait, n=11. Median is the 6th element. The median is not in the list. 9 is the mode, so it must appear at least three times.

Wait, let me think about this. Maybe n=11 is too long, let me try n=7.

Wait, n=7. Wait, I tried n=7 earlier, but let me think again.

Wait, n=7: list is [a, b, c, d, e, f, g], ordered. Median is d, which is not in the list. So, d is an integer not in the list.

Also, 9 is the mode, so 9 appears at least three times.

So, let me have three 9s. So, the list is [a, b, c, d,9,9,9], ordered. Then, the median is d, which is not in the list.

Therefore, d is not equal to a, b, c,9, so d is less than9.

Sum is a + b + c + d +9 +9 +9=30, so a + b + c + d=30 -27=3.

But a, b, c, d are positive integers with a <= b <= c <=d <9.

Minimum sum a + b + c + d=1 +1 +1 +1=4, which is more than 3. So, impossible.

Thus, n=7 is impossible.

Wait, maybe n=12.

Wait, n=12. The median is the average of the 6th and7th elements, which is integer. So, both 6th and7th elements must be same parity.

Also, 9 is the mode, so it appears more than any other number.

Let me have 9 appear four times.

So, the list is [a, b, c, d, e,9,9,9,9, f, g, h], but ordered. Wait, no, n=12, so maybe [a, b, c, d, e, f,9,9,9,9, g, h]. But the median is (f +9)/2.

Wait, the list is [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l], ordered. The median is (f + g)/2, which is integer.

So, f + g must be even, so both f and g are even or both odd.

Also, 9 is the mode, so appears at least four times.

So, maybe four 9s.

So, let me have four 9s. So, the list is [a, b, c, d,9,9,9,9, h, i, j, k], ordered. Then, the median is (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Therefore, 9 cannot appear four times.

Wait, maybe five times.

So, the list is [a, b, c, d,9,9,9,9,9, f, g, h], ordered. The median is (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Hmm, seems like no matter how I arrange the 9s, the median ends up being 9 if 9 appears at least three times.

Wait, unless 9 appears only twice. But then the mode is not 9, because other numbers can appear twice as well. So, 9 can't be the unique mode if it only appears twice.

Therefore, n=12 is also impossible.

Wait, maybe my approach is wrong. Let me think differently.

Since 9 is the mode, it must appear more times than any other number.

Also, the median is not in the list, so if the median is a number, it must be a number that is not present in the list.

Let me consider that the median is a number different from 9, so it's either higher or lower, but not 9.

Wait, but in the previous cases, when n was 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, it's difficult to get the median not to be 9.

But perhaps I need a different configuration.

Wait, maybe the list has multiple numbers equal to 9, but the median is a different number.

Wait, let me think of n=10.

Wait, n=10, the median is (5th +6th)/2.

Suppose 9 appears five times.

So, the list is [a, b, c, d, e,9,9,9,9,9], ordered. Then, median is (e +9)/2.

Since median is not in the list, (e +9)/2 not in [a, b, c, d, e,9,...9].

Also, e must be <=9, so (e +9)/2 is >= (1 +9)/2=5 and <= (9 +9)/2=9. But the median must not be in the list, so (e +9)/2 must not be equal to any of a, b, c, d, e, 9.

But since e is the 5th element, e <=9.

Wait, let me assign e=5.

Then, median=(5 +9)/2=7. So, 7 must not be in the list.

So, 7 is not in [a, b, c, d,5,9,...9].

So, a, b, c, d <5, and 7 is not present.

Sum is a + b + c + d +5 +9*5=30.

So, a + b + c + d +5 +45=30. So, a + b + c + d=30 -50= -20. Impossible.

Wait, let me try e=7.

Then, median=(7 +9)/2=8. So, 8 must not be in the list.

So, list is [a, b, c, d,7,9,9,9,9,9], with a <= b <= c <= d <=7 and 7 <=9.

Sum is a + b + c + d +7 +45=30. So, a + b + c + d=30 -52= -22. Impossible.

Wait, perhaps e=6.

Median=(6 +9)/2=7.5, which is not integer. So, invalid.

e=8.

Median=(8 +9)/2=8.5, not integer.

e=9.

Median=(9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

So, n=10 is impossible.

Wait, maybe n=14.

Wait, this seems going too far. Maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the list is [1,1,1,9,9,9,9,16]. Let me check.

Sum is 1+1+1+9+9+9+9+16= 1*3 +9*4 +16=3 +36 +16=55. That's too much.

Wait, maybe [1,1,9,9,9,10,10]. Let's check.

Sum is 1+1+9+9+9+10+10= 1*2 +9*3 +10*2=2 +27 +20=49. Too big.

Wait, let me think smaller.

Wait, 9 is the mode, so it must appear more than any other number. Let's suppose 9 appears three times.

Then, the list has at least three 9s.

Let me try n=7.

List: [a, b, c, d, e, f, g], ordered.

Suppose three 9s: [a, b, c,9,9,9,g]. The median is the 4th element, which is9, but it's in the list. Not allowed.

Alternatively, [a, b,9,9,9, f, g]. Median is the 4th element, which is9, in the list. Not allowed.

Wait, maybe n=8.

List: [a, b, c, d,9,9,9,9], median is average of 4th and5th elements.

So, (d +9)/2, which must be integer.

Let me set d=7. Then, median=(7 +9)/2=8, which is not in the list.

So, the list is [a, b, c,7,9,9,9,9], with a <= b <= c <=7 <=9.

Sum is a + b + c +7 +9*4=30. So, a + b + c=30 -43= -13. Impossible.

Wait, let me try d=5.

Median=(5 +9)/2=7, which must not be in the list.

So, list is [a, b, c,5,9,9,9,9], with a <= b <= c <=5.

Sum: a + b + c +5 +36=30. So, a + b + c= -11. Impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe d=3.

Median=(3 +9)/2=6, not in the list.

List: [a, b, c,3,9,9,9,9], with a <= b <= c <=3.

Sum: a + b + c +3 +36=30. a + b + c= -9. Impossible.

Alternatively, d=1.

Median=(1 +9)/2=5, not in the list.

So, list is [1, b, c,1,9,9,9,9], but ordered, so it's [1,1, c, d,9,9,9,9]. Wait, no, the list is ordered, so a=1, b=1, c >=1, d >=c, etc.

Wait, list is [1,1, c, d,9,9,9,9], with a=1, b=1, c <=d <=9.

Sum:1 +1 +c +d +9*4=30. So, c + d=30 -36 -2= -8. Impossible.

So, n=8 also doesn't work.

Wait, maybe n=14.

Wait, getting too big.

Wait, perhaps the list is [1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]. That's 14 elements.

Sum is 4*1 +10*9=4 +90=94. Way too big.

Wait, maybe n=6, but earlier attempts showed it's impossible.

Wait, maybe I need to think that the list has multiple 9s, but the median is a number that is not in the list, but the list can have other numbers which are not 9.

Wait, but 9 is the mode, so it appears more than any other number.

Wait, let me consider n=7.

Wait, maybe [1,1,9,9,9,9,7]. Let me check.

Sum:1+1+9+9+9+9+7=45. That's too much.

Wait, maybe [1,1,1,9,9,9,10]. Sum:1+1+1+9+9+9+10=30.

Yes, that works.

So, let me check.

List: [1,1,1,9,9,9,10], ordered.

Sum:1+1+1+9+9+9+10=30. Good.

Mode is 9, since it appears three times, more than 1 which appears three times. Wait, no, 1 also appears three times. So, bimodal. But the problem states unique mode, so this is invalid.

Therefore, need to have 9 appear more than any other number.

So, let me have 9 appear four times, and 1 appear three times.

So, list: [1,1,1,9,9,9,9,10], but n=8.

Sum:1+1+1+9+9+9+9+10=48. Too much.

Wait, n=7: [1,1,1,9,9,9,10], sum=30.

But in this case, 1 and9 both appear three times, so bimodal. Not unique mode.

So, need to have 9 appear four times.

So, n=8: [1,1,1,9,9,9,9,10], sum=48. Too much.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps n=9.

List: [1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,10], sum=1*3 +9*5 +10=3 +45 +10=58. Too much.

Wait, maybe lower the other numbers.

Wait, n=7: [1,1,9,9,9,9,10], sum=1+1+9+9+9+9+10=48. Still too big.

n=6: [1,1,9,9,9,10], sum=1+1+9+9+9+10=39. Still too big.

n=5: [1,1,9,9,10], sum=1+1+9+9+10=30. Mode is 9 and1, both appear twice. So, bimodal. Not unique.

Wait, n=6: [1,1,1,9,9,10], sum=1+1+1+9+9+10=31. Close.

Wait, n=6: [1,1,1,9,9,9], sum=1+1+1+9+9+9=30. But in this case, 9 appears four times, 1 appears three times. So, unique mode is 9.

But the median is the average of 3rd and4th elements. The list is [1,1,1,9,9,9]. Median is (1 +9)/2=5, which is not in the list. Perfect.

So, let me check all conditions.

1. Sum is 30. Yes, 1+1+1+9+9+9=30.

2. The mode is 9, which appears four times. 1 appears three times. So, unique mode.

3. The median is 5, which is not in the list. Correct.

4. The median is a positive integer not in the list. Yes, 5 is not in [1,1,1,9,9,9].

So, this seems to satisfy all conditions.

Therefore, the list is [1,1,1,9,9,9]. The sum of squares is 1² +1² +1² +9² +9² +9²=1 +1 +1 +81 +81 +81=1 +1 +1=3, 81*3=243, so total is 3 +243=246.

Wait, is that the only possible list? Let me check if there's another possible list.

Wait, n=6: [1,1,1,9,9,9].

Another possibility: n=7: [1,1,1,1,9,9,10]. But in this case, 1 appears four times, 9 appears two times, 10 once. So, mode is1, not9. So, invalid.

Alternatively, n=7: [1,1,9,9,9,9,10]. Mode is9, which appears four times, 1 appears twice. So, unique mode. Let me check if the median is not in the list.

List: [1,1,9,9,9,9,10]. Median is the 4th element, which is9. But 9 is in the list. Not allowed.

Therefore, in n=7, the median is9, which is in the list, so invalid.

Similarly, n=8: [1,1,1,9,9,9,9,10]. Sum is 1+1+1+9+9+9+9+10=48. Too big.

Wait, n=6 is the only possible one.

Wait, another n=6: [1,1,1,9,9,9]. Median is5, not in list. Sum is30. Mode is9, unique. So, this is valid.

Alternatively, n=6: [2,2,2,9,9,9]. Sum is2+2+2+9+9+9=33. Too big.

n=6: [1,1,2,9,9,9]. Sum is1+1+2+9+9+9=31. Close.

Wait, n=6: [1,1,1,9,9,10]. Sum is1+1+1+9+9+10=31. Close.

Wait, n=6: [1,1,1,8,9,10]. Sum is1+1+1+8+9+10=30.

Check mode: 1 appears three times, 8,9,10 once each. So, mode is1, not9. Invalid.

So, the only possible list is [1,1,1,9,9,9]. Therefore, the sum of squares is246.

Wait, let me double-check.

Sum of squares:1² +1² +1² +9² +9² +9²=1 +1 +1 +81 +81 +81= 3 +243=246.

Yes, that's correct.

But wait, is there another list with n=6?

What about [2,2,2,2,9,9]. Sum is2+2+2+2+9+9=28. Close, but not30.

[2,2,2,3,9,9]. Sum is2+2+2+3+9+9=27.

[2,2,2,4,9,9]. Sum=2+2+2+4+9+9=28.

[2,2,2,5,9,9]. Sum=2+2+2+5+9+9=29.

[2,2,2,6,9,9]. Sum=2+2+2+6+9+9=30.

So, let's check this list: [2,2,2,6,9,9]. Ordered list: [2,2,2,6,9,9].

Sum=2+2+2+6+9+9=30.

Mode is2, which appears three times. 9 appears two times. So, unique mode is2, not9. So, invalid.

Similarly, [3,3,3,3,9,9]. Sum=3+3+3+3+9+9=30.

Mode is3, which appears four times. 9 appears two times. So, unique mode is3, not9. Invalid.

Similarly, [4,4,4,4,9,9]. Sum=4+4+4+4+9+9=34. Too big.

So, only the list [1,1,1,9,9,9] works.

Therefore, the sum of squares is246.

**Final Answer**
The sum of the squares of all the items in the list is \boxed{246}.
</think>

Given a list of positive integers with the following properties:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

We need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

### Key Steps:

1. **Understanding the Mode**: The number 9 must appear more frequently than any other number in the list.
2. **Understanding the Median**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If even, it is the average of the two middle numbers, which must be an integer and not present in the list.
3. **Constructing the List**: We need to ensure the list satisfies all given properties. After several attempts with different lengths and configurations, we find that a list with six elements works:
   - The list is \([1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9]\).
   - The sum of the elements is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 30\).
   - The mode is 9, which appears three times, more than any other number.
   - The median is the average of the third and fourth elements, which is \(\frac{1 + 9}{2} = 5\), not present in the list.

4. **Sum of Squares Calculation**:
   - The sum of the squares of the elements is \(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 81 + 81 + 81 = 246\).

### Final Answer
The sum of the squares of all the items in the list is \(\boxed{246}\).
