Question:
Let $\omega \neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when 
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \] is divided by 1000.

Correct Answer:
To find $\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})$, where $\omega \neq 1$ and $\omega^{13} = 1$, rewrite this as 
$(r - \omega)(s - \omega)(r - \omega^2)(s - \omega^2)...(r - \omega^{12})(s - \omega^{12})$ where $r$ and $s$ are the roots of the quadratic $x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0$. 
Grouping the $r$'s and $s$'s results in 
$\frac{r^{13} - 1}{r - 1} \cdot \frac{s^{13} - 1}{s - 1}$. 
The denominator $(r - 1)(s - 1) = 1$ by Vieta's formulas. 
The numerator $(rs)^{13} - (r^{13} + s^{13}) + 1 = 2^{13} - (-128) + 1 = 8321$ by Newton's sums. 
Thus, the final answer is $\boxed{321}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, 13th roots of unity... that means \(\omega^{13} = 1\), right? And since \(\omega \neq 1\), it's a primitive 13th root of unity. So, \(\omega\) satisfies the equation \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), but since \(\omega \neq 1\), it's a root of the cyclotomic polynomial \(\Phi_{13}(x)\), which is irreducible over the integers.

Now, the product is from \(k = 0\) to \(12\), so it's over all the 13th roots of unity. The expression inside the product is \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Let me write that down: \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of \(\omega^k\). Maybe I can factor it or relate it to something else.

Let me denote \(x = \omega^k\). Then the expression becomes \(2 - 2x + x^2\). Hmm, that's a quadratic equation: \(x^2 - 2x + 2\). Let me compute its discriminant: \((-2)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 2 = 4 - 8 = -4\). So, the roots are complex: \(x = [2 \pm \sqrt{-4}]/2 = 1 \pm i\). So, it factors as \((x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\). Therefore, \(x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\).

So, substituting back, each term in the product is \((\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i))\). Therefore, the entire product is \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i))\).

Which can be written as \(\left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \right) \times \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i)) \right)\). So, two separate products multiplied together.

Now, I have a product over all the 13th roots of unity of \((x - a)\), where \(x\) is each root. That's similar to evaluating the polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity at \(a\). Wait, but actually, the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k)\) is equal to \(x^{13} - 1\), because the roots are the 13th roots of unity. So, if I set \(x = 1 + i\) and \(x = 1 - i\), then each product would be \((1 + i)^{13} - 1\) and \((1 - i)^{13} - 1\).

Wait, actually, let me think. Since \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - a) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (a - \omega^k)\), because it's just multiplying by -1 each term, so the product becomes \((-1)^{13} \prod_{k=0}^{12} (a - \omega^k) = -\prod_{k=0}^{12} (a - \omega^k)\). But since 13 is odd, the sign is important.

But actually, in this case, since the product is \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (a - \omega^k)\), and we know that \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k) = x^{13} - 1\). Therefore, substituting \(x = a\), we get that \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (a - \omega^k) = a^{13} - 1\). So, that's a key insight.

Therefore, in this case, for each product, when \(a = 1 + i\) and \(a = 1 - i\), the product becomes \((1 + i)^{13} - 1\) and \((1 - i)^{13} - 1\). So, the entire original product is \(( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ) \times ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 )\).

So, now I need to compute \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\), subtract 1 from each, multiply them together, and then find the result modulo 1000.

First, let's compute \((1 + i)^{13}\). To do that, it's helpful to express \(1 + i\) in polar form. Since \(1 + i\) has a magnitude of \(\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}\) and an angle of \(\pi/4\), so \(1 + i = \sqrt{2} \cdot e^{i\pi/4}\).

Therefore, \((1 + i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} \cdot e^{i \times 13 \times \pi/4}\).

Similarly, \((1 - i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} \cdot e^{-i \times 13 \times \pi/4}\), since \(1 - i\) has an angle of \(-\pi/4\).

So, let's compute \((\sqrt{2})^{13}\). That's equal to \(2^{13/2} = 2^{6} \times 2^{1/2} = 64 \times \sqrt{2}\). So, \((\sqrt{2})^{13} = 64 \sqrt{2}\).

Now, let's compute the exponents:

First, \(13 \times \pi/4 = (12 + 1) \times \pi/4 = 3\pi + \pi/4\). Since \(e^{i\theta}\) is periodic with period \(2\pi\), we can subtract \(2\pi\) to find the equivalent angle.

Compute \(3\pi + \pi/4 - 2\pi = \pi + \pi/4 = 5\pi/4\). So, \(e^{i \times 13 \times \pi/4} = e^{i \times 5\pi/4}\).

Similarly, \(e^{-i \times 13 \times \pi/4} = e^{-i \times 5\pi/4}\).

So, now, \(e^{i \times 5\pi/4} = \cos(5\pi/4) + i \sin(5\pi/4) = -\sqrt{2}/2 - i \sqrt{2}/2\).

Similarly, \(e^{-i \times 5\pi/4} = \cos(5\pi/4) - i \sin(5\pi/4) = -\sqrt{2}/2 + i \sqrt{2}/2\).

Therefore, \((1 + i)^{13} = 64 \sqrt{2} \times (-\sqrt{2}/2 - i \sqrt{2}/2)\).

Compute that:

First, \(64 \sqrt{2} \times (-\sqrt{2}/2) = 64 \times (-2/2) = 64 \times (-1) = -64\).

Similarly, \(64 \sqrt{2} \times (-i \sqrt{2}/2) = 64 \times (-i \times 2/2) = 64 \times (-i) = -64i\).

So, \((1 + i)^{13} = -64 - 64i\).

Similarly, \((1 - i)^{13} = 64 \sqrt{2} \times (-\sqrt{2}/2 + i \sqrt{2}/2)\).

Compute that:

\(64 \sqrt{2} \times (-\sqrt{2}/2) = -64\).

\(64 \sqrt{2} \times (i \sqrt{2}/2) = 64i\).

So, \((1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i\).

Therefore, we have:

\((1 + i)^{13} - 1 = (-64 - 64i) - 1 = -65 - 64i\).

Similarly, \((1 - i)^{13} - 1 = (-64 + 64i) - 1 = -65 + 64i\).

Therefore, the original product is \((-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i)\).

That's the product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus, or equivalently, \((-65)^2 - (64i)^2\). But actually, let's compute it step by step.

Multiply \((-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i)\):

First, distribute:

\(-65 \times -65 = 4225\).

\(-65 \times 64i = -4160i\).

\(-64i \times -65 = 4160i\).

\(-64i \times 64i = (-64)^2 i^2 = 4096 \times (-1) = -4096\).

So, adding all together:

4225 - 4160i + 4160i - 4096.

The imaginary parts cancel: -4160i + 4160i = 0.

Then, 4225 - 4096 = 129.

So, the product is 129.

Therefore, the entire product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is 129.

Wait, hold on, 129 modulo 1000 is 129. So, the remainder when divided by 1000 is 129.

But let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, expressing \(1 + i\) in polar form: that's correct, magnitude \(\sqrt{2}\), angle \(\pi/4\).

Then, raising to 13th power: \((\sqrt{2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 64 \sqrt{2}\). Correct.

Angles: \(13 \times \pi/4 = 13\pi/4\). Subtract \(2\pi\) (which is 8pi/4) to get 5pi/4. Correct.

Calculating \(e^{i 5\pi/4}\): yes, that's \(-\sqrt{2}/2 - i\sqrt{2}/2\). Correct.

Multiplying 64√2 by that: 64√2 * (-√2/2) is 64*(-2)/2 = -64. Similarly for the imaginary part. So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Then subtract 1: -65 -64i. Similarly for the other term: -65 + 64i. Then multiplying them: (-65)^2 - (64i)^2? Wait, no, actually, it's (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321? Wait, wait, that contradicts my earlier result.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, no, actually, when I did the multiplication step by step, I saw that cross terms cancel and I get 4225 - 4096 = 129. But now, if I compute it as (-65)^2 - (64i)^2, which is 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - 4096*(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, so which is correct? Let me actually compute it again step by step.

Compute \((-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)\):

First, expand:

(-65)(-65) + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i)

Compute each term:

1. (-65)(-65) = 4225

2. (-65)(64i) = -4160i

3. (-64i)(-65) = +4160i

4. (-64i)(64i) = (-64)^2 (i^2) = 4096*(-1) = -4096

Now, add them together:

4225 - 4160i + 4160i - 4096

The -4160i and +4160i cancel out, so we have 4225 - 4096 = 129.

So, the product is indeed 129. So, my initial calculation was correct, and when I considered it as a difference of squares, I messed up the signs. Because in the difference of squares, it's (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2, but in this case, it's (a + c)(a - c) where c is a complex number, so it's a^2 - c^2, but c^2 is negative.

Wait, no, in this case, c is a complex number, so c^2 is not necessarily positive. So, actually, the correct way is to multiply it out, as I did, and find that the cross terms cancel and we get 129.

Therefore, the product is 129, so when divided by 1000, the remainder is 129.

But wait, hold on, the problem says to compute the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), and we found that it's equal to 129, which is less than 1000, so the remainder is 129.

But just to make sure, let me recap the steps:

1. Recognize that each term is (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

2. So, the entire product is the product over all 13th roots of unity of those terms.

3. Which is equal to the product over all roots of (x - (1 + i)) evaluated at x = ω^k, which is ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ).

4. Similarly, for (1 - i)^13 - 1.

5. Multiply those two results together.

6. Compute (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, so subtract 1: -65 -64i.

7. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i, subtract 1: -65 +64i.

8. Multiply (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = 129.

So, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me test with a smaller case to see if my reasoning is sound.

Suppose instead of 13th roots, I have 2nd roots of unity, ω ≠ 1. Let’s say ω = -1.

Compute the product over k=0 to 1 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Compute for k=0: 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1.

For k=1: 2 - 2*(-1) + (-1)^2 = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.

So, the product is 1*5 = 5.

Now, according to my method, compute (1 + i)^2 - 1 and (1 - i)^2 - 1.

(1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i.

So, (1 + i)^2 -1 = 2i -1.

Similarly, (1 - i)^2 = 1 - 2i + i^2 = 1 - 2i -1 = -2i.

So, (1 - i)^2 -1 = -2i -1.

Now, multiply ( -1 + 2i ) and ( -1 - 2i ). That's (-1)^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - (-4) = 5. Which matches the actual product. So, the method works here.

Similarly, in that case, 5 is less than 1000, so 5 is the remainder.

So, that gives me more confidence that my reasoning is correct for the original problem.

Therefore, the product is 129, so the remainder when divided by 1000 is 129.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{129}
</think>

Given \(\omega \neq 1\) is a 13th root of unity, we need to find the remainder when 
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \]
is divided by 1000.

First, we recognize that each term in the product can be written as a quadratic in \(\omega^k\):
\[ 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i)). \]

Thus, the entire product becomes:
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i)). \]

This can be written as:
\[ \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \right) \times \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i)) \right). \]

Using the fact that \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k) = x^{13} - 1\), we substitute \(x = 1 + i\) and \(x = 1 - i\):
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1, \]
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i)) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1. \]

Next, we compute \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\). Expressing \(1 + i\) in polar form, we have:
\[ 1 + i = \sqrt{2} \cdot e^{i\pi/4}, \]
\[ (1 + i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} \cdot e^{i \cdot 13 \cdot \pi/4}. \]

Simplifying, we find:
\[ (\sqrt{2})^{13} = 64\sqrt{2}, \]
\[ 13 \cdot \pi/4 = 3\pi + \pi/4 \equiv 5\pi/4 \pmod{2\pi}, \]
\[ e^{i \cdot 5\pi/4} = -\sqrt{2}/2 - i\sqrt{2}/2. \]

Thus,
\[ (1 + i)^{13} = 64\sqrt{2} \cdot (-\sqrt{2}/2 - i\sqrt{2}/2) = -64 - 64i. \]

Similarly,
\[ (1 - i)^{13} = 64\sqrt{2} \cdot (-\sqrt{2}/2 + i\sqrt{2}/2) = -64 + 64i. \]

Subtracting 1 from each:
\[ (1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i, \]
\[ (1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i. \]

Multiplying these results:
\[ (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - 4096 = 129. \]

Thus, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is:
\[ \boxed{129} \]
