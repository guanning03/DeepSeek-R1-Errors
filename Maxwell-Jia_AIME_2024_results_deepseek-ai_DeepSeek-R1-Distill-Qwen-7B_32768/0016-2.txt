Question:
There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that:

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Correct Answer:
The problem says 'some', so not all cells must be occupied. We start by doing casework on the column on the left. There can be 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 black chip. The same goes for white chips, so we will multiply by 2 at the end. There is $1$ way to select $5$ cells with black chips. Because of the 2nd condition, there can be no white, and the grid must be all black, yielding $1$ way. There are $5$ ways to select $4$ cells with black chips. We now consider the row that does not contain a black chip. The first cell must be blank, and the remaining $4$ cells have $2^4 - 1$ different ways ($-1$ comes from all blank). This gives us $75$ ways. Notice that for $3$, $2$, or $1$ black chips on the left, there is a pattern. Once the first blank row is chosen, the rest of the blank rows must be ordered similarly. For example, with $2$ black chips on the left, there will be $3$ blank rows. There are $15$ ways for the first row to be chosen, and the following $2$ rows must have the same order. Thus, the number of ways for $3$, $2$, and $1$ black chips is $10\times 15$, $10\times 15$, $5\times 15$. Adding these up, we have $1 + 75 + 150 + 150 + 75 = 451$. Multiplying this by $2$, we get $902$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and they're all indistinguishable. I need to find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the grid under certain conditions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the conditions are:

1. Each cell can contain at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row and all chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

So, I need to figure out how to place chips such that each row is entirely one color and each column is entirely one color. Also, once I place the chips, I can't add any more without breaking these rules. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me think.

Let me start by understanding the constraints better. Each row must be monochromatic, meaning either all white or all black. Similarly, each column must be monochromatic. So, the grid has to be such that every row is either entirely white or entirely black, and every column is entirely white or entirely black. 

Wait, this sounds like a grid where the coloring is such that the rows and columns form a kind of checkerboard pattern, but not necessarily alternating. Instead, each row is either all white or all black, and each column is either all white or all black. So, actually, the grid can be partitioned into blocks of white and black such that the entire row or column is one color.

But wait, the problem says "some" of the chips are placed, so it's not required to place chips in every cell. But, once you place the chips, adding any more would violate the row or column conditions.

So, this means that the placement must be maximal in some sense. That is, you can't add another chip without causing a row or column to have both colors.

Therefore, the grid you have must be such that every possible cell that can be added would either cause a row or column to have two different colors. So, for each empty cell, either its row already has both colors or its column already has both colors.

But since initially, all rows and columns are either all white or all black, adding a chip would change the color of that row or column. Wait, no, because once you place a chip in a row, the entire row must be that color. So, if you have a row that is all white, you can't have a single chip in any cell of that row without making the entire row white.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify.

If a row is supposed to be monochromatic, then if you place a chip in a cell of that row, the entire row must be that color. So, if you have a row that is all white, you can't place a black chip in that row without violating the condition. Similarly, if a row is all black, you can't place a white chip in that row.

Similarly, for columns. So, the moment you place a chip in a cell, you're effectively determining the color of the entire row and column.

Therefore, to satisfy the third condition, that any additional chip would violate the first two conditions, the grid must be such that for every empty cell, either its row is already determined to be a certain color, or its column is already determined to be a certain color. Because if you try to place a chip in that cell, it would have to be the same color as the row or the column, but perhaps the other color?

Wait, no. If the row is already all white, you can't place a black chip in that row, so any empty cell in a row that's already a color can't have the opposite color. Similarly, if a column is already a color, you can't place the opposite color in that column.

But this seems a bit confusing. Let me try to rephrase.

Suppose I have a grid where some rows are white and some are black, and some columns are white and some are black. Each cell can only have one color, which is the color of its row or the color of its column. But wait, if a cell is in a white row and a black column, that creates a conflict.

Wait, that's not allowed. Because if a cell is in a white row, then it must be white, but if it's in a black column, it must be black. So, unless all rows and columns have the same color, you can't have a cell that's both white and black.

Therefore, in order to have a consistent coloring, all the rows and columns must agree on the color of each cell. So, if a row is white, then all columns intersecting that row must also be white. Similarly, if a column is black, then all rows intersecting that column must also be black.

Wait, that seems too restrictive. Let me think.

No, actually, if a row is white, then all cells in that row must be white. Similarly, if a column is white, all cells in that column must be white. But a cell is at the intersection of a row and a column, so if both the row and column are white, the cell is white. If the row is white and the column is black, the cell must be both white and black, which is impossible.

Therefore, in order to have a consistent coloring, every row and column must be of the same color. That is, either all rows and columns are white, or all are black, or some combination where if a row is white, all columns intersecting it must also be white, and similarly for black.

Wait, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

Suppose I have a row that's white. Then, all cells in that row must be white. But if a column intersects that row, the cell where they meet is white. But if that column is supposed to be black, that cell must be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, if a row is white, all columns intersecting it must be white as well. Similarly, if a column is white, all rows intersecting it must be white.

Similarly, if a row is black, all columns intersecting it must be black. So, the only consistent colorings are those where all rows are white, all columns are white; all rows are black, all columns are black; or some mixture where all rows and columns are white or black, but in such a way that the color of the row determines the color of the column it intersects, and vice versa.

Wait, so it's like a grid where the rows and columns are either all white or all black, but if any row is white, then all columns must be white, and if any column is black, then all rows must be black.

So, that would mean that the grid is partitioned into a white rectangle and a black rectangle, where the white rectangle is the intersection of all white rows and all white columns, and the black rectangle is the intersection of all black rows and all black columns.

But in this problem, we can place some chips, meaning we can have some rows and columns partially filled, but with the constraints that each row and column is entirely one color.

Wait, no, each row and column must be entirely one color or the other. So, if we have a row that's white, all cells in that row must be white. Similarly, if a column is white, all cells in that column must be white.

Therefore, the only way to have a consistent coloring is to have all rows and columns be either white or black, but with the caveat that if a row is white, all columns must be white, and if a column is black, all rows must be black.

Wait, that seems too restrictive. Let me think differently.

Perhaps I should model this as a bipartite graph where rows and columns are nodes, and placing a chip in a cell is like connecting a row and a column. But since each row and column must be monochromatic, once you place a chip in a cell, you have to decide the color of that row and column.

But since all chips in a row must be the same color, and all chips in a column must be the same color, the color of the row and the color of the column must agree for every cell. So, if a row is white, all columns intersecting it must also be white, and if a column is black, all rows intersecting it must be black.

Therefore, the possible colorings are either:

1. All rows and columns are white.

2. All rows and columns are black.

But wait, that can't be, because we can have some rows white and some columns black, but then the cells at the intersections would be conflicting.

Wait, let me try an example.

Suppose I have a 2x2 grid. If I set the first row to white and the second row to black, then the first column must be white (since it intersects a white row) and the second column must be black (since it intersects a black row). So the grid would look like:

W W

B B

But wait, in this case, the first column is white, so the cell (2,1) must be white, but we set it to black. That's a conflict. Therefore, you can't have a row and a column with different colors unless all rows and columns are the same color.

Hence, the only possible colorings are all white or all black.

Wait, but that seems too restrictive. The problem says "some" of the chips are placed, so maybe not all cells need to be filled, but the coloring constraints still apply.

Wait, perhaps the only possible maximal configurations are all white or all black. Because if you try to have any mixture, you can always add chips of the opposite color in some cells.

Wait, let me think. Suppose I have a grid where I have a white row and a black row, but then, for the columns, if a column intersects a white row, it has to be white, and if it intersects a black row, it has to be black. But a column can't be both white and black, so that's impossible. Therefore, the only way to have a consistent coloring is to have all rows and columns be the same color.

But in that case, the number of ways would just be 2: all white or all black. But the problem says "some of these chips are placed," so perhaps we can have some rows and columns with chips, but the rest are empty.

Wait, but if you have a row with some white chips, then the entire row must be white. Similarly, if you have a column with some white chips, the entire column must be white. So, if you have both a white row and a white column, their intersection must be white, which is consistent.

But if you have a row that's white and a column that's black, their intersection must be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, if you have any white rows, all columns must be white, and if you have any black columns, all rows must be black.

Wait, so the only possible configurations are:

1. All rows and columns are white: so the grid is all white.

2. All rows and columns are black: so the grid is all black.

But then, what about configurations where some rows are white and some columns are black? But as we saw earlier, that leads to conflicts. So, that's not allowed.

Therefore, the only maximal configurations are all white or all black.

But wait, that seems to contradict the idea of being able to place some chips. If all cells are white, you can't add any more chips, but if you have some cells white and some cells black, you might be able to add more chips without violating the conditions.

Wait, no. If you have a grid with some white and some black cells, you can't add any more chips because adding a chip would either create a new color in a row or a column.

Wait, but if you have a grid where some rows are white and some are black, and some columns are white and some are black, but arranged in a way that the colors don't conflict. Is that possible?

Wait, let me suppose that we have a grid where some rows are white and some are black, and some columns are white and some are black, but in such a way that the intersection of a white row and a black column is not both white and black. Is that possible?

No, because the cell at the intersection must be both white (from the white row) and black (from the black column), which is impossible. Therefore, the only way to have such a grid is to have all rows and columns be white or all be black.

Therefore, the only maximal configurations are all white or all black. But that can't be, because the problem says "some of these chips are placed," implying that not all cells need to be filled.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says "each cell contains at most one chip," so you can have some cells empty. Then, "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour." So, each row that has any chips must be entirely one color, and each column that has any chips must be entirely one color.

And the third condition is that any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

So, what this is saying is that the current placement is such that you can't add any more chips without either adding a chip to a row that would change its color or adding a chip to a column that would change its color.

Therefore, in order to maximize the number of chips, such that adding any more would require changing the color of a row or a column.

So, in that case, the grid must be such that every empty cell is in a row or a column that is entirely one color, so that adding a chip there would require changing the color of that row or column.

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the rows that are not entirely filled are of the same color, and all the columns that are not entirely filled are of the same color.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.

Let me try to think of it in terms of the previous problem where all rows and columns must be either all white or all black, but the colors must be consistent across the grid.

Wait, so if all rows are white, then all the columns must be white as well because otherwise, you'd have a conflict at the intersection. Similarly, if all columns are black, then all the rows must be black.

But if you have a mix of white and black rows, it's impossible because that would force some columns to be both white and black.

Therefore, the only possible maximal configurations are all white or all black.

But then, in that case, the number of ways would be 2: all white or all black. But since we have 25 white and 25 black chips, perhaps we can have different numbers of white and black.

Wait, maybe not. Because if you have all white, you can't place any black chips, and vice versa.

But the problem says "some of these chips are placed," so maybe you have both white and black chips.

Wait, but if you have a white row, then all columns intersecting that row must be white. Similarly, if you have a black column, all rows intersecting it must be black. So, if you have at least one white row and at least one black column, then all columns must be white (because of the white row) and all rows must be black (because of the black column). But that's a contradiction because a row can't be both white and black.

Therefore, the only possible configurations are either all white or all black. Therefore, the number of ways is 2: all white or all black.

But wait, the problem mentions 25 white and 25 black chips, so can we have different numbers? Or is it that the grid can have any number of white and black chips, as long as the conditions are satisfied?

But in the initial setup, we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but in the problem, we are to place some chips in the grid. So, "some" of these chips, meaning we can choose any number up to 50? Or up to 25 in each color?

Wait, actually, the problem says "using some of these chips," which are 25 white and 25 black. So, we can place any number of white and black chips in the grid, up to 25 of each, but subject to the constraints.

But the key is that once you place the chips, adding any more would violate the row or column conditions.

So, the grid must be such that every empty cell is in a row or column that is already entirely one color. Therefore, adding a chip there would require changing the color of that row or column.

So, in order to satisfy this, the grid must be partitioned into a white region and a black region, where all the white cells form a rectangle (possibly a single row or column), and similarly for black.

Wait, that might be the case.

Let me think about it. If the white cells form a rectangle (a subgrid) and the black cells form another rectangle, such that the white and black regions don't overlap. Then, adding any chip in the white region would require changing the color of the row or column, but since it's already white, it can't be changed. Similarly, for the black region.

Wait, actually, no. If all rows in the white region are white, and all columns in the white region are white, and all rows in the black region are black, and all columns in the black region are black, then you can't add any more chips because every empty cell is in a row or column that's already determined.

Wait, let me think of it as a grid where the white cells form a rectangle in the top-left corner, and the black cells form a rectangle in the bottom-right corner, with the rest of the grid empty. Then, each row in the white region is white, each column in the white region is white, each row in the black region is black, each column in the black region is black, and the empty cells are in the intersection of a white row and black column or vice versa, but since those are empty, you can't add any more chips.

Wait, but the empty cells that are in a white row and black column would be conflicting if we tried to add a chip there. So, adding a chip there would require the cell to be both white and black, which is impossible, so indeed, you can't add any more chips.

Therefore, the maximal configurations are those where the grid is divided into four regions:

1. White region: a rectangle of rows and columns, all white.

2. Black region: another rectangle of rows and columns, all black.

3. The remaining cells: empty.

But actually, since the grid is square, if you have a white rectangle in the top-left and a black rectangle in the bottom-right, the overlapping region would be empty.

Wait, let me formalize this. Let me denote the grid as a 5x5 matrix. Let’s say that the white region is the top-left k x l rectangle, and the black region is the bottom-right m x n rectangle, such that k + m = 5 and l + n = 5. Then, the overlap between the white and black regions would be the cells where the white region and black region intersect, which would be empty.

Therefore, the number of white chips would be k * l, and the number of black chips would be m * n. Since k = 5 - m and l = 5 - n, the number of white chips is k * l = (5 - m)(5 - n), and the number of black chips is m * n.

But in the problem, we are allowed to use some of the 25 white and 25 black chips, so m and n can vary such that m * n <= 25 and (5 - m)(5 - n) <= 25. However, since the grid is 5x5, m and n can range from 0 to 5.

Wait, but we also have to consider that the white and black regions can be adjacent, but in such a way that they don't overlap, right? So, the white region is on one side, and the black region is on the opposite side, leaving the remaining cells empty.

Therefore, the number of such configurations would be determined by the number of ways to choose m and n, where m and n are integers between 0 and 5, such that the white region is of size (5 - m)(5 - n) and the black region is of size m * n.

But also, the white and black regions must not overlap. So, for each m and n, we need to check that the white region and black region do not overlap.

Wait, actually, for each m and n, the white region is the top-left (5 - m) x (5 - n) and the black region is the bottom-right m x n. So, they only overlap if (5 - m) > m and (5 - n) > n, but wait, m and n are from 0 to 5. For m = 0, the black region is 5 x n, and the white region is 5 x (5 - n). Similarly, for n = 0, it's similar.

Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

If m = 0, the black region is 0 x n, which is empty, so the white region is 5 x (5 - n). Similarly, if n = 0, the white region is (5 - m) x 5, and the black region is m x 5.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that for each m and n, the white region is (5 - m) x (5 - n) and the black region is m x n, and these two regions are non-overlapping.

But actually, in the grid, the white region is the top-left corner, and the black region is the bottom-right corner, so they don't overlap if m and n are chosen such that the white region is above and to the left of the black region.

But actually, regardless of m and n, the white region is always in the top-left, and the black region is always in the bottom-right. So, they don't overlap because the white region is above the black region and to the left.

Wait, no, they can't overlap unless m and n are such that the white region's rows and columns extend beyond the black region's.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think with m and n.

Suppose m = 2, n = 3. Then, the black region is 2 x 3, starting from the bottom-right corner. The white region is (5 - 2) x (5 - 3) = 3 x 2, starting from the top-left corner. So, the white region is 3 rows high and 2 columns wide, and the black region is 2 rows high and 3 columns wide. They don't overlap because one is in the top-left and the other is in the bottom-right.

Similarly, if m = 5, n = 5, then the black region is 5 x 5, which is the entire grid, so the white region is 0 x 0, which is nothing. Similarly, if m = 0 and n = 0, the black region is 0 x 0, and the white region is 5 x 5.

Therefore, for each m and n, where m is the number of black rows and n is the number of black columns, the white region is (5 - m) x (5 - n) and the black region is m x n, and these two regions don't overlap.

Therefore, the number of such configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose m and n, where m and n are between 0 and 5, inclusive. Each pair (m, n) corresponds to a unique configuration where the grid is divided into a white region of size (5 - m)(5 - n) and a black region of size m * n.

But wait, actually, m and n can range from 0 to 5, but for each (m, n), we have a unique configuration. However, some configurations might be symmetric, but regardless, for each (m, n), we have a different configuration.

But also, note that for each (m, n), the number of white chips is (5 - m)(5 - n), and the number of black chips is m * n. Since we have 25 white and 25 black chips, the number of white chips must be less than or equal to 25, and the number of black chips must be less than or equal to 25.

But since (5 - m)(5 - n) <= 25 and m * n <= 25, and m and n are integers between 0 and 5, inclusive, we need to count all pairs (m, n) where (5 - m)(5 - n) <= 25 and m * n <= 25.

But actually, since m and n are between 0 and 5, the maximum (5 - m)(5 - n) can be is 25 (when m = 0 and n = 0), and the maximum m * n is 25 (when m = 5 and n = 5). So, all pairs (m, n) where m, n = 0,1,2,3,4,5 are valid, because (5 - m)(5 - n) and m * n will both be <= 25.

Therefore, the number of such configurations is 6 x 6 = 36, since m and n can each independently take 6 values (0 through 5).

But wait, no, because in the problem, we have 25 white and 25 black chips. So, in each configuration, we have some number of white chips and some number of black chips, but we are allowed to use "some" of these chips, meaning we can have any number up to 25 of each color.

Therefore, each configuration corresponds to a possible way of placing some white and some black chips, with the constraints. So, each (m, n) pair gives a unique configuration where the white region is (5 - m)(5 - n) and the black region is m * n.

But in addition to that, we can also have cases where only white or only black chips are placed, right? Because "some" could mean all white or all black.

But in the earlier analysis, we saw that if you have a mix of white and black rows and columns, you end up with a contradiction, so the only way to satisfy the conditions is to have all rows and columns be the same color. Therefore, the only configurations are all white or all black.

But that contradicts the idea that we can have different (m, n) configurations. So, perhaps my initial analysis was wrong.

Wait, let's try to think again.

If a configuration has both white and black regions, then each row in the white region is white, each row in the black region is black. Similarly, each column in the white region is white, each column in the black region is black. So, in this case, the color of a row depends only on whether it's in the white region or the black region, and similarly for columns.

Therefore, in such a configuration, you can have both white and black rows and columns, but their intersections are consistent because the rows and columns are partitioned into white and black regions.

So, in this case, the only forbidden cells are the overlaps between white rows and black columns or black rows and white columns, which are empty. Therefore, any chip placed in such an empty cell would require changing the color of the row or the column, which is not allowed.

Therefore, such configurations are acceptable because they satisfy the maximal condition.

Therefore, the number of such configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose m and n, where m is the number of black rows and n is the number of black columns, each ranging from 0 to 5. Therefore, the number of configurations is 6 x 6 = 36.

But wait, in this case, each configuration corresponds to a unique white and black region. However, each configuration also corresponds to a specific number of white and black chips, which can be calculated as (5 - m)(5 - n) white chips and m * n black chips.

But the problem says "some of these chips in the 25 unit cells," so we can choose any number up to 25 in each color.

Therefore, each configuration is a possible way of placing some chips, and the total number of configurations is 36.

But hold on, when m and n are both 0, the white region is 5x5 and the black region is 0x0. So, all cells are white. Similarly, when m and n are both 5, all cells are black.

But the problem allows us to place some chips, so we can also have configurations where only part of the white or black regions are filled. Wait, no, because once you place a chip in a cell, the entire row and column must be of that color.

Therefore, in each configuration, all the cells in the white region must be white, and all the cells in the black region must be black. Therefore, you can't partially fill the white or black regions.

Thus, the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose m and n, which is 6 x 6 = 36.

But let me check.

If m = 0, n = 0: all white.

m = 5, n = 5: all black.

m = 2, n = 3: white region is 3x2, black region is 2x3.

Each such configuration is unique because the sizes of the white and black regions are determined by m and n.

Therefore, the number of configurations is 36.

But wait, in the problem statement, it says "some of these chips," meaning that you can choose to place any number of chips, not necessarily all. But in our analysis, each configuration corresponds to a specific number of white and black chips, so 36 configurations.

But wait, in some configurations, you can have more than one way to place the chips, right? For example, in a configuration where m = 2, n = 3, you can choose any subset of the white region and any subset of the black region, as long as the rows and columns are entirely one color.

But wait, hold on. If you have a configuration with m = 2, n = 3, the white region is 3x2, so 6 cells, and the black region is 2x3, so 6 cells. Each row in the white region must be entirely white, so you can't place any white chips in the black region. Similarly, each column in the white region must be entirely white, so you can't place any white chips in the black region.

Similarly, for the black region, each row must be entirely black, so you can't place any black chips in the white region.

Therefore, in each configuration, you have to place all the white chips in the white region and all the black chips in the black region. So, you can't have partial placement; you have to place all or none in each region.

Wait, but that contradicts the idea of "some of these chips." So, maybe in each configuration, you have to place all the white chips in the white region and all the black chips in the black region.

Therefore, each configuration corresponds to a unique way of placing the chips, with all white chips in the white region and all black chips in the black region.

Therefore, the number of configurations is 36.

But hold on, let me think.

If in each configuration, you have to place all the white chips in the white region and all the black chips in the black region, then the number of configurations is indeed 36, as each (m, n) corresponds to a unique configuration.

However, the problem says "using some of these chips," so maybe we can leave some cells empty, but in such a way that adding any more would violate the conditions.

Wait, but in the configuration where the white region is (5 - m)(5 - n) and the black region is m * n, all the cells in the white region are white, all the cells in the black region are black, and the remaining cells are empty. So, in order to have a maximal configuration, you must have all empty cells such that adding a chip there would require changing the color of a row or column.

So, for example, if you have a white region and a black region, the empty cells are in the intersection of a white row and a black column or vice versa. Therefore, adding a chip there would require the cell to be both white and black, which is impossible, hence it's a maximal configuration.

Therefore, in each configuration, you have to place all the white chips in the white region and all the black chips in the black region, leaving the rest empty. So, in each configuration, the number of white chips is (5 - m)(5 - n) and the number of black chips is m * n. So, each configuration is uniquely determined by m and n.

Therefore, the number of configurations is 36.

But wait, hold on, in the problem, the chips are indistinct. So, for each configuration, how many ways can we place the chips? Since the white chips are indistinct and the black chips are indistinct, each configuration is just one way: all white chips in the white region, all black chips in the black region, and empty elsewhere.

Therefore, the number of ways is 36.

But wait, let me check when m = 0, n = 0: all white. So, you have 25 white chips placed, which is allowed.

Similarly, when m = 5, n = 5: all black, 25 black chips.

When m = 1, n = 1: white region is 4x4, so 16 white chips, and black region is 1x1, so 1 black chip. That's 17 chips in total.

But wait, in the problem, we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but in a configuration, we can have as many as (5 - m)(5 - n) white chips and m * n black chips.

But does this affect the count?

Wait, no, because the problem is not about choosing how many chips to place, but about how many ways you can place some chips such that the conditions are satisfied.

So, each configuration corresponds to a unique way of placing some chips (possibly all, possibly none), but in our case, the chips are indistinct, so each configuration is unique.

Therefore, the total number of configurations is 36.

Wait, but let me check with m and n from 0 to 5.

When m = 0, n = 0: all white.

m = 0, n = 1: white region is 5x4, black region is 0x1.

But wait, no. If m = 0, n = 1, then the black region is 0x1, which is empty, and the white region is 5x4, which is all white. So, you can't have a single column as black because you can't have a black row without a black column.

Wait, no, m is the number of black rows, and n is the number of black columns. So, m = 0, n = 1: black rows = 0, black columns = 1. Therefore, the white region is 5x4, and the black region is 0x1, which is empty. So, all the cells are white except for 0x1, which is nothing.

Wait, maybe more accurately, the white region is (5 - m) x (5 - n). So, when m = 0, n = 0: white region is 5x5, black region is 0x0.

When m = 1, n = 0: white region is 4x5, black region is 1x0.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because n = 0 implies no black columns. So, the black region would be 1x0, which is empty. So, in this case, the white region is 4x5, but all the columns must be white because n = 0.

Wait, no, n = 0 implies that there are no black columns, which would mean that all columns are white. Similarly, m = 1 implies that there is one black row.

Therefore, the white region is (5 - m) x (5 - n) = 4x5, but since n = 0, the black region is m * n = 1 * 0 = 0. So, the white region is 4x5, which is 4 rows white and 5 columns white, but wait, if n = 0, all columns are white, so all cells are white except the 1 black row.

So, that's 24 white chips and 1 black chip. So, that's a valid configuration.

Similarly, with m = 0, n = 1: 5 white rows and 4 white columns, so all cells are white except the 4 columns in the black region, but m = 0, so no black rows, so the black region is 0x1, which is nothing.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

In any case, the number of configurations is 6 * 6 = 36.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the problem differently.

Another approach is to model this as a bipartite graph where one partition is the rows and the other is the columns. Each chip is an edge between a row and a column. The conditions require that the edges (chips) in each row form a clique (all present) and similarly for each column. Therefore, the graph must be a union of bicliques.

But in our case, since each row and column can be either all white or all black, this is equivalent to a bipartite graph where each connected component is a complete bipartite graph (biclique). Each biclique corresponds to a rectangle of white or black chips.

To satisfy the maximal condition, the graph must consist of a single biclique, or a combination where adding any edge would create a conflict.

Wait, but in our case, the entire grid must be partitioned into a single white region and a single black region, such that their intersection is empty.

Therefore, the graph is a complete bipartite graph between the white rows and white columns, and another complete bipartite graph between black rows and black columns.

Wait, but for it to be maximal, these two complete bipartite graphs must cover the entire grid without overlapping.

Therefore, the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to partition the rows into white and black, and the columns into white and black, such that the white rows and white columns form a rectangle, and the black rows and black columns form another rectangle, which is disjoint from the white one.

Therefore, this is equivalent to choosing a rectangle in the grid to be white and the remaining part to be black, or vice versa.

Wait, no, because both white and black regions can be anywhere, not necessarily rectangles.

Wait, actually, no, because the white and black regions must be rectangles to satisfy the condition that all rows and columns are entirely one color.

Therefore, the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a rectangle in the grid to be white and the rest to be black, or choose a rectangle to be black and the rest to be white.

But each such configuration is uniquely determined by the choice of white and black regions, which are rectangles.

Therefore, the number of such configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a white rectangle and a black rectangle such that they don't overlap.

But in reality, for each configuration, you have a single white rectangle and a single black rectangle, which are complements of each other.

Therefore, the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a white rectangle, and the rest is black.

But in addition, you can have configurations where all cells are white or all cells are black.

Wait, but in the problem, you need to place some chips, so not necessarily all.

Therefore, the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a white rectangle and a black rectangle, with the white rectangle and black rectangle being complements.

But the white rectangle can be any rectangle from 0x0 to 5x5, and the black rectangle is the complement.

But in our case, the white rectangle must be such that all its rows and columns are entirely white, and the black rectangle must be such that all its rows and columns are entirely black.

Therefore, the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a white rectangle, which is a subgrid where certain rows and columns are selected, and the remaining cells are black.

Therefore, the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of rows and a subset of columns to form a white rectangle.

Each such choice corresponds to a unique configuration.

How many such choices are there?

Well, to choose a white rectangle, you need to choose a set of consecutive rows and a set of consecutive columns. Wait, no, not necessarily consecutive.

Wait, actually, in the grid, a rectangle can be formed by selecting any subset of rows and any subset of columns. However, in our problem, the white region must be a rectangle, meaning it's formed by selecting a set of consecutive rows and a set of consecutive columns.

Because if you choose non-consecutive rows or columns, the white region would consist of disconnected blocks, which wouldn't satisfy the condition that all chips in a row or column are the same color.

Wait, actually, in the problem, the white region is formed by the intersection of selected rows and selected columns. But in order to have all chips in a row or column being the same color, the white region must consist of entire rows and entire columns. Therefore, the white region must be a rectangle, formed by a set of consecutive rows and a set of consecutive columns.

Similarly, the black region must be a rectangle as well.

Therefore, the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a white rectangle and a black rectangle such that they don't overlap.

But since the black rectangle is the complement of the white rectangle, it must also form a rectangle.

Therefore, the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to partition the grid into two rectangles: a white one and a black one.

But in this case, the white rectangle can be anywhere, and the black rectangle is the complement.

But the white rectangle must be such that all its rows and columns are entirely white, so it's a rectangle.

Similarly, the black rectangle must be a rectangle.

Therefore, the number of such configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a white rectangle, which is equal to the number of ways to choose a set of consecutive rows and a set of consecutive columns.

To compute this, the number of ways to choose consecutive rows is equal to the number of ways to choose a starting and ending row, which is C(6, 2) = 15. Similarly, for columns, it's also C(6, 2) = 15.

Therefore, the number of white rectangles is 15 x 15 = 225.

But wait, does this include the cases where the white rectangle is the entire grid or empty?

Yes, when the white rectangle is the entire grid, it's equivalent to all white, and when it's empty, it's equivalent to all black.

But in our problem, we are to place some chips, so "some" implies that we can't have all white or all black? Or can we?

Wait, the problem says "using some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5×5 grid." So, using some chips, meaning that you have to place at least one chip, but you can choose to place all 25 chips as well.

Therefore, the configurations include both all white, all black, and everything in between.

Therefore, the total number of configurations is 225.

But wait, hold on. Because each white rectangle corresponds to a unique configuration, but each configuration is determined by the white rectangle and the black rectangle.

However, when you choose a white rectangle, the black rectangle is automatically determined as the complement.

Therefore, the number of configurations is equal to the number of white rectangles, which is 15 x 15 = 225.

But wait, when you choose a white rectangle, the black region is fixed as the complement. So, each white rectangle gives a unique configuration.

Therefore, the total number of configurations is 225.

But wait, when you choose a white rectangle, you have to place white chips in the white region and black chips in the black region. So, each configuration is uniquely determined by the white rectangle.

Therefore, the number is 225.

But hold on, in the problem, the chips are indistinct, so we don't care about which specific cells are chosen, just the number.

But the problem says "some of these chips," so you can choose any number of white and black chips, as long as they form a configuration where the white region and black region are rectangles, and all the white chips are in the white region, all the black chips are in the black region.

Wait, but no, if you choose a white rectangle, you have to place all the white chips in that rectangle, and all the black chips in the black rectangle.

But in the problem, the chips are 25 white and 25 black, but you can choose to place "some" of them, meaning that you can choose any number from 0 to 25 for each color, as long as they fit into the rectangle.

Therefore, each configuration is determined by the white rectangle, which defines the white chips and the black chips.

Therefore, the number of configurations is equal to the number of white rectangles, which is 15 x 15 = 225.

But that can't be right because 15 x 15 is 225, but the problem says "using some of these chips," which could also include all white or all black.

But in our earlier analysis, the number of configurations is 225, but each configuration corresponds to a specific white rectangle. So, 225 different ways.

But let me think again: each white rectangle is determined by choosing a range of rows and a range of columns.

For example, choosing rows 1-2 and columns 3-4 gives a white rectangle of 2x2.

Similarly, choosing rows 1-3 and columns 1-5 gives a white rectangle of 3x5.

Each such choice defines a unique configuration.

Therefore, the number of configurations is equal to the number of white rectangles, which is 15 x 15 = 225.

Therefore, the answer is 225.

But wait, in the problem statement, it says "using some of these chips," so perhaps we have to subtract the cases where all cells are white or all are black.

But in our configuration, the all white configuration is included when the white rectangle is the entire grid, and all black is when the white rectangle is empty.

Therefore, if we consider "some" chips, meaning at least one chip, then we have 225 configurations.

But if you must have at least one white and one black chip, then you have 225 - 2 = 223 configurations.

But the problem says "using some of these chips," so it's ambiguous. However, given that the problem allows for all white or all black as well, since it's just "some," I think 225 is the answer.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought that the only configurations are all white or all black because of the constraints, but that was incorrect. The correct analysis is that you can have a white rectangle and a black rectangle, which gives 225 configurations.

But wait, now I'm confused because when I think about the problem as placing some chips, it's 225, but earlier I thought it was 36.

Wait, which is correct?

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the constraints.

Each row must be entirely one color, and each column must be entirely one color.

Therefore, if you have a white rectangle of size (5 - m) x (5 - n), then you have m rows that are entirely black and n columns that are entirely black.

But if you have both m and n positive, you can't have both black rows and black columns because that would leave some cells empty, which are intersections of black rows and white columns or vice versa, but in our case, the white region is separate.

Wait, no, in our case, the white region is (5 - m)(5 - n), and the black region is m * n, so the intersection of a black row and a white column is empty, which is okay because you can't place a chip there.

Therefore, each configuration is a white rectangle and a black rectangle, which are complements.

Therefore, the number of configurations is the number of white rectangles, which is 15 x 15 = 225.

Hence, the answer is 225.

But wait, in the problem statement, it's 25 white and 25 black chips, but in our analysis, each configuration uses (5 - m)(5 - n) white chips and m * n black chips.

But since the problem says "using some of these chips," maybe we can have any number of chips, so the number of configurations is not constrained by the number of chips.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify the number of chips to place, just that you have 25 white and 25 black chips, but you can use some of them.

Therefore, each configuration is determined by the white rectangle, regardless of the number of chips.

Therefore, the number of configurations is 225.

But wait, but each white rectangle defines a unique number of white chips and black chips.

Therefore, the number of configurations is 225, each corresponding to a unique way of placing some white and some black chips in the grid.

Therefore, the answer is 225.

But wait, hold on, in the problem, it's 25 white and 25 black chips. So, the maximum number of white chips is 25, and the maximum number of black chips is 25.

But in our earlier analysis, the number of white chips can be up to 25 (all white) and down to 0, and similarly for black chips.

Therefore, each configuration is a possible way to place some white and some black chips, with the number of white chips being (5 - m)(5 - n) and black chips being m * n.

Therefore, the number of such configurations is 225.

But wait, actually, no. Because for each white rectangle, the number of white chips is fixed, and the black chips are also fixed. So, each white rectangle defines exactly one configuration, regardless of how many chips you place.

But the problem says "using some of these chips," so you can choose any number of chips, but in our case, each configuration is uniquely determined by the white rectangle.

Therefore, the number of configurations is 225.

But wait, that seems too high because 225 is more than the number of possible subsets of chips.

Wait, no, because each white rectangle defines a specific subset of chips: all the white chips are in that rectangle, and all the black chips are in the black rectangle. So, each configuration is a specific way to place chips, not just any subset.

Therefore, the number of configurations is 225.

But let me think of a smaller case. Suppose we have a 2x2 grid, 2 white and 2 black chips.

How many configurations are there?

Using the same logic, the number of white rectangles would be: choosing rows and columns.

For a 2x2 grid, the number of white rectangles is (C(3,2)) x (C(3,2)) = 3 x 3 = 9.

But in reality, in a 2x2 grid, the number of configurations where each row and column is monochromatic is 9.

But let me enumerate them:

1. All white.

2. All black.

3. White in top-left 1x1, black in the rest.

4. White in top-right 1x1, black in the rest.

5. White in bottom-left 1x1, black in the rest.

6. White in bottom-right 1x1, black in the rest.

7. White in top 1x2, black in the bottom 1x2.

8. White in left 2x1, black in right 2x1.

9. White in the entire grid, but that's already counted as all white.

Wait, actually, in the 2x2 grid, how many configurations are there?

If we require that each row and column is entirely one color, then each configuration is determined by a rectangle of white and a rectangle of black.

So, in 2x2, the possible white rectangles are:

- 1x1: four possibilities.

- 1x2: two possibilities.

- 2x1: two possibilities.

- 2x2: one possibility.

Similarly, black rectangles are the same.

But for each configuration, we have a unique white rectangle, so the number of configurations is 9.

But in reality, if you consider that placing chips is independent, you can have more configurations.

Wait, no, in the 2x2 grid, the possible configurations are:

1. All white.

2. All black.

3. White top-left, black elsewhere.

4. White top-right, black elsewhere.

5. White bottom-left, black elsewhere.

6. White bottom-right, black elsewhere.

7. White top row, black bottom row.

8. White left column, black right column.

Therefore, that's 8 configurations, not 9.

Wait, why is that? Because when you choose a white rectangle, you have to place all the white chips in that rectangle, and all the black chips in the black rectangle.

Therefore, in 2x2, number of configurations is 9, but in reality, some configurations are equivalent.

Wait, actually, no. Each configuration is unique because the white rectangle is unique.

Wait, let's count:

- All white: 1.

- All black: 1.

- White top-left 1x1: 1.

- White top-right 1x1: 1.

- White bottom-left 1x1: 1.

- White bottom-right 1x1: 1.

- White top 1x2: 1.

- White left 2x1: 1.

So, that's 9 configurations, each corresponding to a unique white rectangle.

Therefore, in 2x2, the number of configurations is 9.

Similarly, in 5x5, it's 15 x 15 = 225.

Therefore, in the original problem, the number of configurations is 225.

But in the 2x2 case, you can place 1, 2, 3, or 4 chips, but each configuration is determined by the white rectangle, regardless of the number of chips.

Therefore, the answer is 225.

But now, let me think again about the problem statement.

It says "using some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5×5 grid such that: each cell contains at most one chip; all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour."

So, it's not about placing a certain number of chips, but about choosing some chips (i.e., a subset) such that in each row and column, all the chips are the same color.

Therefore, each configuration is determined by a white rectangle and a black rectangle, which are complements.

Therefore, the number of configurations is 15 x 15 = 225.

Therefore, the answer is 225.

But wait, 15 is the number of ways to choose consecutive rows: for 5 rows, the number of ways to choose a consecutive range is 5C2 + 1 = 15. Similarly for columns.

Therefore, the number of white rectangles is 15 x 15 = 225.

Hence, the number of configurations is 225.

Therefore, I think the answer is 225.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{225}
</think>

To solve the problem of placing chips in a 5x5 grid such that each row and column is monochromatic and any additional chip would violate the conditions, we need to consider the following:

1. Each row and column must be entirely one color (either all white or all black).
2. Adding any more chips must not violate the condition that all chips in the same row and column must be the same color.

This means that the grid must be partitioned into regions where each region is a rectangle of a single color. The regions must be such that adding any more chips would require changing the color of a row or column, which is not allowed.

The key insight is that the grid can be divided into a white region and a black region, each forming a rectangle. The white region can be any subgrid formed by consecutive rows and columns, and the black region is the complement of this white region.

To determine the number of such configurations, we need to count the number of ways to choose a white rectangle. The number of ways to choose consecutive rows and columns for the white region is given by the number of ways to choose a starting and ending row and column.

For a 5x5 grid, the number of ways to choose consecutive rows is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \). Similarly, the number of ways to choose consecutive columns is also 15. Therefore, the total number of white rectangles is \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \).

Each white rectangle corresponds to a unique configuration where the white chips are placed in the white region and the black chips are placed in the black region. Thus, the number of ways to place the chips is 225.

\[
\boxed{225}
\]
