Question:
Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

Correct Answer:
Let $w, x, y, z$ denote the number of residents who own 1, 2, 3, and 4 of these items, respectively. We know $w+x+y+z=900$, since there are 900 residents in total. This simplifies to $w+z=229$, since we know $x=437$ and $y=234$. Now, we set an equation for the total number of items. We know there are 195 rings, 367 clubs, 562 spades, and 900 candy hearts. Adding these up, there are 2024 items in total. Thus, $w+2x+3y+4z=2024$ since we are not adding the number of items each group of people contributes, and this must be equal to the total number of items. Plugging in $x$ and $y$, we get $w+4z=448$. Solving $w+z=229$ and $w+4z=448$, we get $z=73$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this problem here about the residents of Aimeville. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, and they also might own a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, or a garden spade. The numbers given are:

- 195 own a diamond ring,
- 367 own a set of golf clubs,
- 562 own a garden spade.

Additionally, we're told that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many residents own all four things—so that includes the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and the candy hearts. Since everyone owns candy hearts, that's the fourth thing.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me summarize the information:

Total residents, n = 900.

Diamond ring owners, let's denote that as D = 195.

Golf clubs owners, G = 367.

Garden spade owners, S = 562.

Candy hearts are owned by everyone, so that's 900.

Now, the residents own exactly two things: 437.

Exactly three things: 234.

We need to find those who own all four: let's denote that as x.

So, in set theory terms, we can model this with a Venn diagram with four sets: D, G, S, and the universal set, which is all 900 residents since everyone owns candy hearts. Wait, actually, since everyone owns candy hearts, maybe we can consider candy hearts as a given and just focus on the other three—D, G, S. Hmm, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so candy hearts are not an option in terms of ownership beyond being owned by everyone.

So, actually, perhaps the four things are: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). But since everyone owns C, it's not contributing to the intersections beyond everyone's ownership.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as four sets: D, G, S, and C, but since C is universal, any intersection with C is just the set itself. So, perhaps we can model this with three sets and then include the fact that everyone owns C.

But maybe a better approach is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets. Let me recall the formula.

For four sets, the inclusion-exclusion principle is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D ∩ C| - |G ∩ S| - |G ∩ C| - |S ∩ C| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ C| + |D ∩ S ∩ C| + |G ∩ S ∩ C| - |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|.

But since everyone owns C, |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| is just 900, since everyone owns at least C. So, we can write:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D ∩ C| - |G ∩ S| - |G ∩ C| - |S ∩ C| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ C| + |D ∩ S ∩ C| + |G ∩ S ∩ C| - |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|.

But |C| is 900 since everyone owns candy hearts. So, substituting that in:

900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D ∩ C| - |G ∩ S| - |G ∩ C| - |S ∩ C| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ C| + |D ∩ S ∩ C| + |G ∩ S ∩ C| - |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|.

Wait, but since |D ∩ C| is just |D|, because everyone who owns a diamond ring also owns candy hearts. Similarly, |G ∩ C| = |G|, and |S ∩ C| = |S|. Similarly, |D ∩ G ∩ C| = |D ∩ G|, because if you own both D and G, you must own C. Wait, actually, is that necessarily true? No, wait, if you own D and G, since everyone owns C, then |D ∩ G ∩ C| = |D ∩ G|, because C is a superset.

Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me think.

Since everyone owns C, any intersection involving C is just the set itself. So, for example, |D ∩ C| = |D|, because all D owners have C. Similarly, |G ∩ C| = |G|, |S ∩ C| = |S|.

Similarly, three-way intersections: |D ∩ G ∩ C| would be |D ∩ G|, since C is already included in everyone. Similarly, |D ∩ S ∩ C| = |D ∩ S|, and |G ∩ S ∩ C| = |G ∩ S|.

And the four-way intersection is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C| = |D ∩ G ∩ S|, since C is always included.

So, substituting all that into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D ∩ C| - |G ∩ S| - |G ∩ C| - |S ∩ C| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ C| + |D ∩ S ∩ C| + |G ∩ S ∩ C| - |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|

= 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D| - |G ∩ S| - |G| - |S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|

Wait, let me simplify term by term:

First, let's compute the left-hand side: 900.

Right-hand side:

195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D| - |G ∩ S| - |G| - |S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|

Let me rewrite this expression step by step:

Start with the sum of individual sets:

195 (D) + 367 (G) + 562 (S) + 900 (C) = 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124, plus 900 is 2024.

Then subtract the pairwise intersections:

- |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D| - |G ∩ S| - |G| - |S|

So, that's subtracting |D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S|, |D|, |G ∩ S|, |G|, |S|.

But |D|, |G|, |S| are the counts for each set, which we've already included in the initial sum. So, how does that play out? Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the terms:

Total = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D ∩ C| - |G ∩ S| - |G ∩ C| - |S ∩ C| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ C| + |D ∩ S ∩ C| + |G ∩ S ∩ C| - |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|

But since |D ∩ C| = |D|, |G ∩ C| = |G|, |S ∩ C| = |S|, |D ∩ G ∩ C| = |D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S ∩ C| = |D ∩ S|, |G ∩ S ∩ C| = |G ∩ S|, and |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C| = |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Substituting all that, we have:

Total = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D| - |G ∩ S| - |G| - |S| + |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|

Simplify term by term:

|D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D| - |G ∩ S| - |G| - |S| + |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|

Let me group similar terms:

- |D| and + |D| cancel.

- |G| and - |G| cancel.

- |S| and - |S| cancel.

So, we're left with:

|C| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|

Simplify further:

- |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ G| cancels.

- |D ∩ S| + |D ∩ S| cancels.

- |G ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| cancels.

So, we're left with |C| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But |C| is 900, so:

900 = 900 - |D ∩ G ∩ S|

Wait, that simplifies to:

900 = 900 - |D ∩ G ∩ S|

Subtract 900 from both sides:

0 = - |D ∩ G ∩ S|

Which implies |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. That would mean no one owns all three of D, G, S. But the problem is asking for those who own all four, which includes D, G, S, and C. Since everyone owns C, the number of people owning all four is equal to the number owning all three, which is |D ∩ G ∩ S|. But according to this, that's zero.

But that seems conflicting with the given numbers. Let me double-check my steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the inclusion-exclusion formula. Let me recall that the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|.

But in our case, the four sets are D, G, S, and C. However, since everyone owns C, |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| is just 900, as everyone owns at least C.

So, plugging in:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D ∩ C| - |G ∩ S| - |G ∩ C| - |S ∩ C| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ C| + |D ∩ S ∩ C| + |G ∩ S ∩ C| - |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|

Now, as I thought before, intersections with C can be simplified:

|D ∩ C| = |D|, |G ∩ C| = |G|, |S ∩ C| = |S|,

|D ∩ G ∩ C| = |D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S ∩ C| = |D ∩ S|, |G ∩ S ∩ C| = |G ∩ S|,

|D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C| = |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

So substituting all that, we have:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D| - |G ∩ S| - |G| - |S| + |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|

Simplify term by term:

- |D| and + |D| cancel.

- |G| and - |G| cancel.

- |S| and - |S| cancel.

Similarly, - |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ G| cancels.

- |D ∩ S| + |D ∩ S| cancels.

- |G ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| cancels.

So, everything cancels except for |C| and |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Thus, 900 = |C| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But |C| is 900, so:

900 = 900 - |D ∩ G ∩ S|

Which implies |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 0.

Hmm, that suggests that no one owns all three of D, G, and S, which would mean that the number of people owning all four is also zero. But the problem is asking for that number, so is it zero?

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the four-way intersection.

Wait, the four-way intersection is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. But since everyone owns C, that's just |D ∩ G ∩ S|. So, in inclusion-exclusion, we have:

Total = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D ∩ C| - |G ∩ S| - |G ∩ C| - |S ∩ C| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ C| + |D ∩ S ∩ C| + |G ∩ S ∩ C| - |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|

But as we saw, |D ∩ G ∩ C| = |D ∩ G|, etc., so the inclusion-exclusion simplifies to:

Total = |C| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|

Which gives 900 = 900 - |D ∩ G ∩ S|, so |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 0.

But that seems odd because the problem mentions exactly two and exactly three, and we have to find exactly four. If |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 0, then the number of people owning all four is zero. But let me check if that makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should model this with a Venn diagram. Since everyone owns candy hearts, the Venn diagram can be considered within the context of D, G, S, and the rest is just C.

But another approach is to use the formula for the number of people owning exactly k things. The problem gives us the number of people owning exactly two and exactly three, and asks for exactly four.

In general, for such problems, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but we can also model this with equations.

Let me denote:

Let a = number of people owning exactly D,

b = exactly G,

c = exactly S,

d = exactly D ∩ G,

e = exactly D ∩ S,

f = exactly G ∩ S,

g = exactly D ∩ G ∩ S,

h = exactly all four (D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C) = g, since everyone owns C.

But wait, actually, since everyone owns C, the exactly four would be g.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the exactly two and exactly three counts are given. So, we can write equations based on the counts.

So, total number of people is 900, so:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.

But since h = g, because everyone owns C, and exactly four is just exactly D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C.

But wait, actually, owning exactly two means they own exactly two of D, G, S, and C. But since C is owned by everyone, does that affect the count?

Wait, no. Because if you own exactly two things, that includes C. So, actually, owning exactly two things would be:

Either owning C and one other, or maybe not? Wait, wait, no, the four things are D, G, S, and C. So, if you own exactly two, that could be any two of these four. But since C is owned by everyone, it's possible that being counted in exactly two could involve C.

Wait, maybe not. Wait, in the problem statement, it says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, each resident owns at least C, but may own more. So, when they say "exactly two," they mean exactly two of the four things: D, G, S, C.

But since C is owned by everyone, perhaps owning exactly two things includes C.

Wait, but this is a bit ambiguous. Let's think.

If someone owns exactly two things, could they be C and another? Or is C considered as a separate thing, so that owning exactly two things would be two of D, G, S, and C. So, for example, if someone owns C and D, that's two things, but if someone owns C and G and S, that's three things.

But in that case, the exactly two would include people owning C and one other. Similarly, exactly three would include people owning C and two others, or all three D, G, S.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So, exactly two could be C and D, C and G, or C and S. Similarly, exactly three could be C and D and G, C and D and S, C and G and S, or D and G and S.

So, in that case, the counts given (437 for exactly two, 234 for exactly three) include the cases where C is one of the things.

But in our previous inclusion-exclusion approach, we might have miscounted because of that.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the problem in terms of sets without C, considering that C is common to everyone.

Let me think: since everyone owns C, the problem reduces to considering the ownership of D, G, S, and C, where C is always present. So, effectively, each resident is in at least the C set. So, when considering the number of people owning exactly two things, it's equivalent to owning C plus exactly one other thing, or owning two of D, G, S, and not owning C. But since everyone owns C, that can't be.

Wait, no, because exact counts include the number of things they own. So, if you own exactly two things, that could be C and D, C and G, or C and S. Similarly, exactly three things could be C and two others, or all three D, G, S.

Therefore, to compute the number of people owning exactly two things, we can think of it as:

Number of people owning exactly two things = (number owning C and exactly one of D, G, S) + (number owning exactly two of D, G, S and not C). But since everyone owns C, the second term is zero. So, exactly two things = number owning C and exactly one of D, G, S.

Similarly, exactly three things = number owning C and exactly two of D, G, S, plus the number owning exactly three of D, G, S.

But since everyone owns C, the number owning exactly three of D, G, S is the same as the number owning exactly three things if they don't own C. But since they all do, actually, no, wait:

Wait, if you own exactly three things, it could be C plus two others, or all three D, G, S. Since all three D, G, S would mean three things, but since they also own C, that would actually be four things. Wait, no, hold on.

If someone owns all three D, G, S, and they also own C, that's four things. So, actually, exactly three things would have to include exactly two from D, G, S and C. So, exactly three things would be people owning C and exactly two from D, G, S.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me formalize it.

Let me define:

Let x be the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S (excluding C). But since everyone owns C, owning exactly two things would have to include C and one other.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, the definition is that each resident owns exactly two things, which are from D, G, S, and C.

So, exactly two things can be:

- C and D

- C and G

- C and S

Similarly, exactly three things can be:

- C and D and G

- C and D and S

- C and G and S

- D and G and S

Wait, but if someone owns D and G and S, that's three things, but since they also own C, that would be four things. So, in that case, exactly three things would be C and two of D, G, S.

So, in that case, exactly three things is C and two others.

Similarly, exactly four things would be all four: D, G, S, C.

So, in that case, the number of people owning exactly two things is the sum of:

- Number owning C and exactly one of D, G, S.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three things is the sum of:

- Number owning C and exactly two of D, G, S.

- Number owning exactly three of D, G, S (but since they also own C, this would actually be four things, so perhaps not. Wait, no—if someone owns exactly three of D, G, S, then since they also own C, they own four things. Therefore, exactly three things must include exactly two of D, G, S along with C.

Therefore, the number of people owning exactly two things is equal to the number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S plus C.

Similarly, exactly three things is equal to the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S plus C.

And exactly four things is equal to the number of people owning exactly three of D, G, S plus C.

But since everyone owns C, the counts of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four will be based on how many of D, G, S they own.

Therefore, let me define:

Let a = number owning exactly D (i.e., exactly one of D, G, S)

b = exactly G

c = exactly S

d = exactly D and G (but not S)

e = exactly D and S (but not G)

f = exactly G and S (but not D)

g = exactly D, G, S (but not C, but since they own C, it's actually four things)

Wait, maybe better to model it in terms of the number of people owning exactly k of D, G, S, regardless of C, and then adjust for the fact that they all own C.

So, let's denote:

Let m0 = number owning exactly 0 of D, G, S (i.e., only C)

m1 = number owning exactly 1 of D, G, S

m2 = exactly 2

m3 = exactly 3

But since everyone owns C, m0 is the number owning only C, which is 0 because everyone owns at least C and possibly more.

Wait, but actually, m0 would be the number owning only C, which is 0 since everyone owns C and at least one other thing. Wait, no, actually, the problem states that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so they own C, but they could own none of D, G, S. So, m0 is possible.

Wait, but in the problem, the residents own "exactly two of these things," which are D, G, S, and C. So, if a resident owns only C and one other, that counts as exactly two. If they own only C and two others, that's exactly three, and so on.

So, m0 = number owning only C.

m1 = number owning exactly one of D, G, S and C.

m2 = number owning exactly two of D, G, S and C.

m3 = number owning exactly three of D, G, S and C.

m4 = number owning exactly four (D, G, S, and C).

So, total residents:

m0 + m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 900.

But we are given m2 = 437 (exactly two things) and m3 = 234 (exactly three things). We need to find m4.

But we also know the counts for D, G, S:

Number owning D = 195 = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 (since owning D includes all who own D and any combination of the others).

Similarly, number owning G = 367 = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4.

Number owning S = 562 = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4.

So, we have:

195 = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4

367 = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4

562 = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4

But wait, that can't be because 195, 367, 562 are different. So, that suggests a miscalculation.

Wait, actually, no. The number owning D includes all people who own D, regardless of whether they own other things. So, it's not m1 + m2 + m3 + m4.

Wait, actually, no: m1 is owning exactly one of D, G, S and C, but actually, m1 is the number owning exactly one of D, G, S, and also C. So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of:

Let me redefine:

Let m1 = number owning exactly C and exactly one of D, G, S.

m2 = number owning exactly C and exactly two of D, G, S.

m3 = number owning exactly C and exactly three of D, G, S.

m4 = number owning exactly C and exactly four of D, G, S (i.e., all four).

Wait, but since all have C, m3 is owning all four, which is m4. Hmm, no.

Wait, actually, exactly three things would be owning C and two of D, G, S.

Exactly four things would be owning all four: D, G, S, C.

Therefore, m3 is exactly three things: C and two others.

m4 is exactly four things: D, G, S, C.

So, m3 is exactly C and two others, so that's exactly three.

Similarly, m4 is exactly four.

So, if we define:

m0 = number owning only C.

m1 = number owning exactly one of D, G, S and C.

m2 = number owning exactly two of D, G, S and C.

m3 = number owning exactly three of D, G, S and C.

m4 = number owning exactly four.

But in that case, the counts for D, G, S are:

Number owning D = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4.

Similarly for G and S.

But we know:

Number owning D = 195.

Number owning G = 367.

Number owning S = 562.

Number owning exactly two things: m2 = 437.

Number owning exactly three things: m3 = 234.

We need to find m4.

So, let's write the equations.

First, total residents:

m0 + m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 900.

But we don't know m0 yet.

Number owning D:

195 = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4.

Similarly, number owning G:

367 = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4.

Number owning S:

562 = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4.

Wait, that can't be, unless 195 = 367 = 562, which they are not. So, that suggests that my definition is wrong.

Wait, perhaps because m1, m2, m3, m4 are being double-counted.

Wait, let me think.

Each of m1, m2, m3, m4 are counts of people who own a certain number of D, G, S along with C. So, m1 is owning exactly one of D, G, S and C.

But in reality, for each of D, G, S, the counts include all the people who own them, regardless of how many others they own.

But if m1 is the number owning exactly one of D, G, S and C, then:

Number owning D = m1 (owning D and exactly C) + m2 (owning D and exactly one other) + m3 (owning D and exactly two others) + m4 (owning D and exactly three others).

Wait, but hold on, actually, in this case, m1, m2, m3, m4 are overlapping counts.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the number of people owning exactly k of D, G, S, regardless of C, and then since everyone owns C, the total is k + 1.

But I think that might complicate.

Alternatively, let me think of this as a Venn diagram where each of D, G, S can be present or not, but everyone has C. So, each person is in one of the 8 regions: C only; C and D; C and G; C and S; C and D and G; C and D and S; C and G and S; C and D and G and S.

So, there are 8 regions, but since everyone has C, we can ignore C only.

So, the regions are:

1. C only: m0

2. C and D: a

3. C and G: b

4. C and S: c

5. C and D and G: d

6. C and D and S: e

7. C and G and S: f

8. C and D and G and S: g

So, total residents: m0 + a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.

Now, the number owning exactly two things: these are the regions with exactly two of D, G, S and C. So, that's regions a, b, c. So, exactly two things: a + b + c = 437.

Exactly three things: regions d, e, f. So, exactly three: d + e + f = 234.

Exactly four things: region g = x, which we need to find.

Now, the number owning D is equal to the sum of all regions that include D: a + b + d + e + g = 195.

Similarly, number owning G: b + c + d + f + g = 367.

Number owning S: c + a + e + f + g = 562.

So, we have:

1. a + b + c = 437

2. d + e + f = 234

3. m0 + a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900

4. a + b + d + e + g = 195

5. b + c + d + f + g = 367

6. c + a + e + f + g = 562

We need to find x = g.

Let me try to express all variables in terms of g.

From equation 4: a + b + d + e + g = 195.

From equation 5: b + c + d + f + g = 367.

From equation 6: c + a + e + f + g = 562.

From equation 1: a + b + c = 437.

From equation 2: d + e + f = 234.

Let me denote:

Equation 1: a + b + c = 437.

Equation 2: d + e + f = 234.

Equation 4: a + b + d + e = 195 - g.

Equation 5: b + c + d + f = 367 - g.

Equation 6: c + a + e + f = 562 - g.

Hmm, so we have equations 4,5,6, which relate a, b, c, d, e, f, g.

Let me try to subtract equation 4 from equation 5.

Equation 5 - Equation 4:

(b + c + d + f) - (a + b + d + e) = (367 - g) - (195 - g)

Simplify:

c + f - a - e = 367 - g - 195 + g

Which simplifies to:

c + f - a - e = 172.

But from equation 1, a + b + c = 437, so a = 437 - b - c.

Similarly, from equation 2, d + e + f = 234, so f = 234 - d - e.

Let me substitute a and f into the above equation:

c + (234 - d - e) - (437 - b - c) - e = 172.

Simplify:

c + 234 - d - e - 437 + b + c - e = 172.

Combine like terms:

2c + b - d - 2e + (234 - 437) = 172

2c + b - d - 2e - 203 = 172

So, 2c + b - d - 2e = 172 + 203 = 375.

So, equation A: 2c + b - d - 2e = 375.

Similarly, let's subtract equation 4 from equation 6.

Equation 6 - Equation 4:

(c + a + e + f) - (a + b + d + e) = (562 - g) - (195 - g)

Simplify:

c + f - b - d = 562 - g - 195 + g

Which is:

c + f - b - d = 367.

From equation 1, a + b + c = 437.

From equation 2, d + e + f = 234.

Express a = 437 - b - c.

Express f = 234 - d - e.

Substitute a and f into equation 6 - equation 4:

c + (234 - d - e) - b - d = 367

Simplify:

c + 234 - d - e - b - d = 367

Combine like terms:

c - b - 2d - e + 234 = 367

So,

c - b - 2d - e = 367 - 234 = 133.

Let me denote this as equation B: c - b - 2d - e = 133.

Now, we have two equations:

Equation A: 2c + b - d - 2e = 375

Equation B: c - b - 2d - e = 133

Let me try to add these two equations to eliminate b and e.

Equation A + Equation B:

(2c + b - d - 2e) + (c - b - 2d - e) = 375 + 133

Simplify:

3c - 3d - 3e = 508

Divide both sides by 3:

c - d - e = 508 / 3 ≈ 169.333...

Hmm, but 508 divided by 3 is 169 and 1/3, which is not an integer. But since we're dealing with counts of people, they must be integers. So, this suggests that we might have made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check the arithmetic.

Equation A: 2c + b - d - 2e = 375

Equation B: c - b - 2d - e = 133

Adding them together:

2c + b - d - 2e + c - b - 2d - e

= (2c + c) + (b - b) + (-d - 2d) + (-2e - e)

= 3c - 3d - 3e

Which equals 375 + 133 = 508.

So, 3c - 3d - 3e = 508.

Dividing both sides by 3: c - d - e = 508 / 3 ≈ 169.333...

Hmm, which is not an integer. That can't be, since c, d, e are counts of people.

So, that suggests an error in the setup.

Wait, let me double-check the earlier steps.

From equation 5 - equation 4:

Equation 5: b + c + d + f = 367 - g

Equation 4: a + b + d + e = 195 - g

Subtracting equation 4 from 5:

(b + c + d + f) - (a + b + d + e) = (367 - g) - (195 - g)

Simplify:

c + f - a - e = 172

Yes, that's correct.

Then, from equation 1, a = 437 - b - c

From equation 2, f = 234 - d - e

So, substituting into c + f - a - e:

c + (234 - d - e) - (437 - b - c) - e = c + 234 - d - e - 437 + b + c - e

= 2c + b - d - 2e - 203

Set equal to 172: 2c + b - d - 2e - 203 = 172

Thus, 2c + b - d - 2e = 375

Same as before.

Similarly, equation 6 - equation 4:

Equation 6: c + a + e + f = 562 - g

Equation 4: a + b + d + e = 195 - g

Subtracting equation 4 from 6:

c + a + e + f - a - b - d - e = 562 - g - 195 + g

Simplify:

c + f - b - d = 367

From equation 1, a = 437 - b - c

From equation 2, f = 234 - d - e

Substituting into c + f - b - d:

c + (234 - d - e) - b - d = c + 234 - d - e - b - d

= c - b - 2d - e + 234

Set equal to 367:

c - b - 2d - e + 234 = 367

So, c - b - 2d - e = 133

Same as before.

So, equations A and B are correct.

But then, when we add them, we get a fractional result, which is impossible.

This suggests that either my initial approach is wrong, or perhaps the problem has some inconsistency.

Wait, maybe I missed something in the definitions.

Wait, perhaps when I define m0 as owning only C, but in the problem, everyone owns C and at least one other thing. So, m0 = 0.

Because each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so they have C, but they may own one, two, three, or four of the things.

So, in that case, m0 = 0.

So, equation 3: total residents: m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 900.

But then, equation 4: a + b + d + e + g = 195

Wait, no, let me re-examine.

Wait, if m0 = 0, then:

Number owning D: m1 (C and D only) + m2 (C and D and one other) + m3 (C and D and two others) + m4 (all four) = 195

Similarly for G and S.

But in the previous definitions, a, b, c, etc., were counts of specific regions, so if m0 = 0, then equation 3 becomes:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.

But in the previous setup, equation 3 was:

m0 + a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.

So, if m0 = 0, it becomes:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.

But in that case, equation 1: a + b + c = 437

Equation 2: d + e + f = 234

So, total residents: 437 + 234 + g = 900

Which would give g = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, is g = 229?

But let me make sure.

If m0 = 0, then the total number of people is a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.

But a + b + c = 437 (exactly two things)

d + e + f = 234 (exactly three things)

So, 437 + 234 + g = 900

Thus, g = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.

So, the number of people owning all four things is 229.

But wait, that seems too straightforward, and earlier when I considered m0 as non-zero, I got contradictory results.

But if m0 is zero, then the calculation is straightforward.

Wait, but is m0 zero?

In the problem statement, it says: "each of the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts."

So, does that mean that everyone owns C, but they could own none of D, G, S? Or does it mean that they own at least C and possibly some of D, G, S?

The wording is a bit ambiguous. It says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but it doesn't specify whether they own any of D, G, S or not.

So, if we interpret it as each resident owns at least C and may own some combination of D, G, S, then m0 = 0.

Because m0 is owning only C, which would mean owning only the candy hearts, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but doesn't specify that they own at least one other thing.

So, some residents might own only C, and others own C plus others.

Therefore, m0 is possible.

So, going back, if m0 is not zero, then we have:

Total residents: m0 + m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 900

But without knowing m0, cannot directly compute g.

But we also have:

Number owning D: m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 195

Similarly, G: m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 367

S: m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 562

Which is inconsistent because 195 ≠ 367 ≠ 562.

Therefore, my initial approach must have an error.

Wait, perhaps the counts given (195, 367, 562) are the number of residents owning at least one of each, not exactly.

But the problem says: "195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade."

It doesn't specify "exactly" or "at least," so perhaps these are the total owners, including those who own multiple.

So, in that case, the counts are:

|D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562.

But since every resident owns C, which is common to all, the counts are:

|D| = number owning D, which includes those owning D and C.

Similarly, |G| includes those owning G and C, and |S| includes those owning S and C.

Given that, the counts |D|, |G|, |S| include the people owning exactly two, three, or four things.

But how can |D| be 195, which is less than the total residents? That suggests that 195 is the number of people owning D and C, but since some might own D, C, and others.

Wait, let me think.

Since everyone owns C, the number owning D is equal to the number owning D and C, which is equal to the number owning exactly D and C, plus those owning D, C, and one other, plus those owning D, C, and two others, plus those owning all four.

But since we have:

Number owning D: |D| = 195.

Similarly, |G| = 367, |S| = 562.

But |D| = (exactly D and C) + (exactly D, C, and one other) + (exactly D, C, and two others) + (exactly D, C, and all others).

But since C is common, these numbers are |D| = (exactly two) + (exactly three) + (exactly four) + (exactly one of D, G, S and C).

Wait, no. Because exactly two things would be C and exactly one of D, G, S, which is m1.

Similarly, exactly three things would be C and exactly two of D, G, S, which is m2.

Exactly four things is m3.

But in terms of counts:

|D| = m1 (C and D only) + m2 (C, D, and one other) + m3 (C, D, and two others) + m4 (all four)

Similarly for |G| and |S|.

But since |D|, |G|, |S| are given, and m1, m2, m3, m4 are the counts.

So, for D:

|D| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 195

Similarly,

|G| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 367

Wait, that can't be, unless 195 = 367, which they are not.

So, something is wrong with this approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm double-counting.

Wait, no. Because |D| includes all people who own D, regardless of how many other things they own. Since everyone owns C, |D| includes people who own D and C, regardless of whether they own G or S.

So, |D| = number owning D and C.

Which is equal to:

Number owning exactly D and C (m1)

Plus number owning D, C, and exactly one other (m2)

Plus number owning D, C, and exactly two others (m3)

Plus number owning all four (m4)

Wait, but that would mean:

|D| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 195

Similarly,

|G| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 367

|S| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 562

But since 195 ≠ 367 ≠ 562, this is impossible.

Thus, this suggests that the counts given are not the total number of people owning D, G, S, but maybe the number of people owning exactly D, exactly G, exactly S.

But the problem says "195 who own a diamond ring," which is not necessarily exactly D.

Wait, but in the problem statement, does it say "exactly" or "at least"? It says "195 who own a diamond ring," so that would include people who own D and other things as well.

Therefore, |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562.

But since everyone owns C, |D|, |G|, |S| are all at least as large as the counts of people owning exactly D, C (m1), etc.

But as |D|, |G|, |S| are different, it's impossible for |D| = |G| = |S|.

Thus, I think the problem is that I'm misunderstanding the counts.

Wait, another approach: Let me think of the total number of people as 900, each owning C and possibly some of D, G, S.

Let me denote:

Let x = number owning only C = m0

Let y = number owning C and exactly one of D, G, S = m1

Let z = number owning C and exactly two of D, G, S = m2

Let w = number owning C and exactly three of D, G, S = m3

Let v = number owning C and all four = m4

So, total residents:

x + y + z + w + v = 900

Number owning D:

y (C and D only) + z (C and two others) + w (C and three others) + v (C and four) = 195

Similarly,

Number owning G:

y + z + w + v = 367

Number owning S:

y + z + w + v = 562

Wait, that's the same equation for G and S, which is inconsistent because 367 ≠ 562.

Therefore, this suggests that the problem is misinterpreted.

Alternatively, perhaps the counts given are the number of people owning exactly D, exactly G, exactly S, respectively.

In that case:

Number owning exactly D: 195

Number owning exactly G: 367

Number owning exactly S: 562

But then, since everyone owns C, the number owning exactly D would be 195, which would mean they own D and C, but no G or S.

Similarly, exactly G would be 367 owning G and C, but no D or S.

Exactly S would be 562 owning S and C, but no D or G.

Then, the number owning exactly two things would be the number owning C and exactly one of D, G, S.

So, exactly two things: y = number owning C and exactly one of D, G, S.

But we are given that the number owning exactly two things is 437.

So, y = 437.

Similarly, the number owning exactly three things is 234, which would be the number owning C and exactly two of D, G, S.

So, w = 234.

And the number owning exactly four things is v = ?

We also know that the counts for exactly D, exactly G, exactly S are 195, 367, 562, respectively.

But if exactly D is those owning only D and C, which is y1.

Similarly, exactly G is those owning only G and C, which is y2.

Exactly S is those owning only S and C, which is y3.

But wait, if exactly D is 195, that would mean y1 = 195.

Similarly, exactly G is y2 = 367

Exactly S is y3 = 562

But then, the number owning exactly two things is y = y1 + y2 + y3 = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124

But in the problem, exactly two things is given as 437.

So, that's inconsistent.

Therefore, this also can't be.

Wait, so perhaps the counts given are the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S, in addition to C.

But that would mean:

Number owning D: 195

Number owning G: 367

Number owning S: 562

But since everyone owns C, these counts include C.

So, for example, |D| = number owning D and C.

Which is equal to the number owning exactly D and C plus those owning D, C, and one other plus those owning D, C, and two others plus those owning all four.

Similarly, |G| = number owning G and C.

Same structure.

So, if |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, and total residents = 900.

But since |D|, |G|, |S| are different, we can't have the same count for each.

But from the problem, we know that:

Number owning exactly two things: 437

Number owning exactly three things: 234

So, the counts of exactly two and exactly three are given.

We need to find exactly four.

So, let's define:

Let m1 = exactly one of D, G, S plus C: 437

m2 = exactly two of D, G, S plus C: 234

m3 = exactly three of D, G, S plus C: ?

m4 = exactly four: ?

Then, total residents:

m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 900

But we don't know m3 or m4.

But we also have:

Number owning D: |D| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 195

Similarly,

Number owning G: |G| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 367

Number owning S: |S| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 562

Wait, but as before, 195 = |D| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4

But m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 900

Which is not possible because 195 ≠ 900.

Therefore, perhaps |D|, |G|, |S| are not including the people who own all four.

Wait, but since everyone owns C, the number owning D is the same as those owning D and C, which includes all the people owning D and any combination of G, S.

So, |D| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4

Similarly for |G|, |S|.

But since |D|, |G|, |S| are 195, 367, 562, we have:

m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 195 (for D)

m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 367 (for G)

m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 562 (for S)

But since 195, 367, 562 are all different, this is a problem.

Therefore, I think the only conclusion is that the problem statement must have |D|, |G|, |S| as the number of people owning exactly D, exactly G, exactly S, respectively.

But then, since each of these includes only those owning exactly that thing and C, so:

Exactly D: y1 = 195

Exactly G: y2 = 367

Exactly S: y3 = 562

But then, the number owning exactly two things would be y1 + y2 + y3 = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124

But the problem states that exactly two things are 437.

Thus, inconsistency again.

Wait, maybe |D|, |G|, |S| are the number of people owning D, G, S respectively, including those owning all four.

So, |D| = number owning D, which is equal to the number owning exactly D and C (which is m1) plus those owning exactly D, C, and one other (m2) plus exactly D, C, and two others (m3) plus all four (m4). So, |D| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 195

Similarly, |G| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 367

|S| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 562

But then, 195 = 367 = 562, which is impossible.

Therefore, the only conclusion is that the problem is misworded, and |D|, |G|, |S| are the numbers of people owning exactly D, exactly G, exactly S, respectively.

So, assuming that |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, where each is exactly that.

Then, the number owning exactly two things is 437, which is the number owning exactly two of D, G, S plus C.

So, if exactly two things is 437, which is m1, since each is exactly two of D, G, S and C.

Similarly, exactly three things is 234, which is m2, owning exactly two of D, G, S and C, plus another.

Exactly four would be m3, owning exactly three of D, G, S and C.

So, in that case, the counts would be:

|D| = exactly D and C (m1) + exactly D, C, and one other (m2) + exactly D, C, and two others (m3) + all four (m4)

Similarly for |G| and |S|.

But given that |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562, and m1 = 437, m2 = 234.

Thus, for |D|:

195 = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 437 + 234 + m3 + m4

So,

195 = 671 + m3 + m4

Which implies,

m3 + m4 = 195 - 671 = -476

Which is impossible because counts can't be negative.

Thus, this also leads to a contradiction.

Therefore, it's impossible unless the counts are overlapping differently.

Wait, perhaps m1, m2, m3, m4 are all different from the |D|, |G|, |S|.

Thus, perhaps |D| is everything owning D, regardless of how many other things they own.

Similarly, |G| and |S|.

So, using inclusion-exclusion for three sets:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But since everyone owns C, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = 900.

But |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - |only C| = 900 - m0

But since |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

So,

900 - m0 = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

We know that:

|D ∩ G| = exactly D and G, which is m1 + m2 + m3

Similarly,

|D ∩ S| = m1 + m2 + m3

|G ∩ S| = m1 + m2 + m3

And |D ∩ G ∩ S| = m2 + m3 + m4

But if |D ∩ G| includes m1 (exactly D and G), m2 (exactly D, G, and one more), m3 (exactly D, G, and two more), and m4 (all four).

Wait, no, actually, |D ∩ G| is the number of people owning both D and G, regardless of other things. So, that's m1 (exactly D and G, C only) + m2 (exactly D, G, and one more) + m3 (exactly D, G, and two more) + m4 (all four).

Similarly, |D ∩ S| and |G ∩ S| are the same.

Therefore,

|D ∩ G| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 195 - |only D|? Wait, not necessarily.

Wait, actually, |D| = 195 includes those owning D and C, which is m1 + m2 + m3 + m4.

Similarly, |G| = 367 includes m1 + m2 + m3 + m4.

And |S| = 562 includes m1 + m2 + m3 + m4.

So, in the inclusion-exclusion formula:

900 - m0 = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But since |D ∩ G| = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 195

Similarly, |D ∩ S| = 195, |G ∩ S| = 195.

And |D ∩ G ∩ S| = m2 + m3 + m4

But in the inclusion-exclusion formula, we have:

900 - m0 = 195 + 367 + 562 - (195 + 195 + 195) + (m2 + m3 + m4)

So,

900 - m0 = 195 + 367 + 562 - 585 + (m2 + m3 + m4)

Calculating:

195 + 367 + 562 = 1124

1124 - 585 = 539

So,

900 - m0 = 539 + (m2 + m3 + m4)

But m2 + m3 + m4 = m4 + (m2 + m3)

But m2 + m3 is the number owning exactly three things.

Wait, no, m2 is exactly three things, m3 is exactly four.

Wait, m2 is owning exactly three things, which is exactly two of D, G, S and C. So, m2 = 234.

Thus, m2 + m3 + m4 = 234 + m3 + m4

Therefore,

900 - m0 = 539 + 234 + m3 + m4

So,

900 - m0 = 773 + m3 + m4

Thus,

m3 + m4 = 900 - m0 - 773 = 127 - m0

But m3 is exactly four things, which is m2 + m3 + m4.

Wait, no, m3 is exactly four, which is a subset of m2 + m3 + m4.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler.

Earlier, when I considered the regions and equations, I got m0 = 508/3, which is about 169.333.

But since we have m0 = 0 (if m0 is only C), which is not, but in the problem, since it's allowed to own only C, m0 is 0.

Wait, no, in the problem, it says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so they must own C, but may own some of D, G, S.

Therefore, m0 = 0.

Thus, the total residents are:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900

And:

a + b + c = 437

d + e + f = 234

Which gives:

437 + 234 + g = 900

Thus, g = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.

Therefore, the number of people owning all four is 229.

But earlier, when I considered m0, I got a fractional result, but if m0 = 0, then it works.

So, perhaps the answer is 229.

But let me verify.

So, if m0 = 0, then:

Number owning exactly two things: 437

Number owning exactly three things: 234

Number owning exactly four things: 229

Which adds to 437 + 234 + 229 = 899 + g = Wait, no.

Wait, total residents:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900

But a + b + c = 437

d + e + f = 234

Thus, g = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.

Yes, so g = 229.

Therefore, the number of people owning all four is 229.

Hence, the final answer is \boxed{229}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{229}

Given the problem, we need to determine the number of residents of Aimee’s home who own all four things: a diamond ring (D), a set of garden rings (G), a bag of sugar (S), and a diamond ring and a set of garden rings (C). 

1. **Total Residents**: 900
2. **Residents owning exactly two things**: 437
3. **Residents owning exactly three things**: 234
4. **Residents owning each item**:
   - Diamond ring (D): 195
   - Garden ring (G): 367
   - Silver spoon (S): 562
   - Both D and C: 195

We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem. 

First, we note that everyone owns the candy hearts (C), so we consider the ownership of D, G, S, and C. The key steps are as follows:

1. Define the regions for ownership of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items.
2. Use the given counts of residents owning each item and the counts of residents owning exactly two and exactly three items.
3. Calculate the number of residents owning exactly four items.

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle and the given counts, we find that the number of residents owning all four items is calculated as follows:

- The total number of residents is 900.
- The number of residents owning exactly two things is 437.
- The number of residents owning exactly three things is 234.

Thus, the number of residents owning exactly four things (all four items) is calculated by subtracting the counts of those owning exactly two and exactly three things from the total number of residents:

\[
\text{Number owning all four things} = 900 - (437 + 234)
\]

\[
\text{Number owning all four things} = 900 - 671 = 229
\]

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four things is \(\boxed{229}\).
