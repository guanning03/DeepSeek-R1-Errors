Question:
Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers such that $xyz = 2.$  Find the minimum value of
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4.\]

Correct Answer:
By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 &= x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 4z^4 \\
&\ge 4 \sqrt[4]{(x^4)(2y^2)(2y^2)(4z^4)} \\
&= 8xyz \\
&= 16.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $x^4 = 2y^2 = 4z^2.$  Using the condition $xyz = 2,$ we can solve to get $x = y = \sqrt{2}$ and $z = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{16}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the minimum value of the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\) given that \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are positive real numbers and their product \(xyz = 2\). Hmm, sounds like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember that for such problems, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be used, but since I'm a bit new to this, maybe I can try using the AM-GM inequality instead. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me recall that the AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. That is, for any non-negative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\), we have:

\[
\frac{a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 ... a_n}
\]

with equality if and only if all the \(a_i\) are equal. So, maybe I can apply this inequality to the terms in the given expression somehow.

Looking at the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\), I notice that it has three terms: \(x^4\), \(4y^2\), and \(4z^4\). Since I have a constraint involving \(xyz = 2\), I wonder how I can relate these terms to each other in a way that allows me to use AM-GM.

Perhaps I can split the terms into more parts so that I can apply AM-GM effectively. Let me see:

The term \(x^4\) is already a single term. The term \(4y^2\) can be thought of as two terms of \(2y^2\) each, and similarly, \(4z^4\) can be split into two terms of \(2z^4\) each. So, in total, I would have:

- \(x^4\)
- \(2y^2\), \(2y^2\)
- \(2z^4\), \(2z^4\)

So, that makes a total of five terms. Let me write them out:

1. \(x^4\)
2. \(2y^2\)
3. \(2y^2\)
4. \(2z^4\)
5. \(2z^4\)

Now, applying the AM-GM inequality to these five terms:

\[
\frac{x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^4 + 2z^4}{5} \geq \sqrt[5]{x^4 \cdot (2y^2)^2 \cdot (2z^4)^2}
\]

Wait, let me compute the right side carefully. The geometric mean would be the fifth root of the product of all these terms. So, let's compute that product:

- \(x^4\)
- \(2y^2\) multiplied by another \(2y^2\) gives \((2y^2)^2 = 4y^4\)
- Similarly, \(2z^4\) multiplied by another \(2z^4\) gives \((2z^4)^2 = 4z^8\)

So, multiplying all together:

\[
x^4 \cdot 4y^4 \cdot 4z^8 = 16x^4y^4z^8
\]

Taking the fifth root, we have:

\[
\sqrt[5]{16x^4y^4z^8} = (16)^{1/5} \cdot (x^4)^{1/5} \cdot (y^4)^{1/5} \cdot (z^8)^{1/5}
\]

Simplify each part:

- \(16^{1/5} = (2^4)^{1/5} = 2^{4/5}\)
- \(x^4)^{1/5} = x^{4/5}\)
- \(y^4)^{1/5} = y^{4/5}\)
- \(z^8)^{1/5} = z^{8/5}\)

So, putting it all together:

\[
2^{4/5} \cdot x^{4/5} \cdot y^{4/5} \cdot z^{8/5}
\]

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can relate this to the given constraint \(xyz = 2\). Let's see.

First, let me write the AM-GM inequality we have:

\[
\frac{x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^4 + 2z^4}{5} \geq 2^{4/5} \cdot x^{4/5} \cdot y^{4/5} \cdot z^{8/5}
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \geq 5 \cdot 2^{4/5} \cdot x^{4/5} \cdot y^{4/5} \cdot z^{8/5}
\]

Hmm, now I need to relate \(x^{4/5}y^{4/5}z^{8/5}\) to \(xyz\). Let's note that \(xyz = 2\), so perhaps we can express this in terms of \(xyz\).

Let me rewrite the exponent terms:

- \(x^{4/5} = (x^1)^{4/5}\)
- \(y^{4/5} = (y^1)^{4/5}\)
- \(z^{8/5} = (z^2)^{4/5}\)

Alternatively, we can factor the exponents:

\(x^{4/5}y^{4/5}z^{8/5} = (xyz)^{4/5} \cdot z^{4/5}\)

Since \(xyz = 2\), this becomes:

\[
(2)^{4/5} \cdot z^{4/5}
\]

So, substituting back into the inequality:

\[
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \geq 5 \cdot 2^{4/5} \cdot 2^{4/5} \cdot z^{4/5}
\]

Wait, that can't be right. Let me go back a step.

Wait, so from earlier:

\(x^{4/5} y^{4/5} z^{8/5} = (xyz)^{4/5} \cdot z^{4/5}\)

Which is:

\[
(2)^{4/5} \cdot z^{4/5}
\]

So, substituting back into the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \geq 5 \cdot 2^{4/5} \cdot (2)^{4/5} \cdot z^{4/5}
\]

Simplify \(2^{4/5} \cdot 2^{4/5}\):

That's \(2^{8/5}\), so:

\[
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \geq 5 \cdot 2^{8/5} \cdot z^{4/5}
\]

Hmm, but this still leaves a \(z^{4/5}\) term, which depends on \(z\). But we have a constraint that \(xyz = 2\), so maybe we can express \(z\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\), and then substitute.

From \(xyz = 2\), we can write \(z = \frac{2}{xy}\). Let me substitute that into the inequality.

So, \(z^{4/5} = \left(\frac{2}{xy}\right)^{4/5} = 2^{4/5} \cdot (xy)^{-4/5}\)

Substituting back in:

\[
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \geq 5 \cdot 2^{8/5} \cdot 2^{4/5} \cdot (xy)^{-4/5}
\]

Simplify \(2^{8/5} \cdot 2^{4/5}\):

That's \(2^{12/5}\), so:

\[
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \geq 5 \cdot 2^{12/5} \cdot (xy)^{-4/5}
\]

Hmm, so now I have an inequality in terms of \(x\) and \(y\). Maybe I can apply AM-GM again on \(x^4\) and \(4y^2\). Wait, but earlier I split \(4y^2\) into two \(2y^2\) terms. Maybe I can consider \(x^4\), \(2y^2\), \(2y^2\), \(2z^4\), \(2z^4\) as I did before, and then use the condition.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to set up the problem using substitution with the constraint.

Let me denote \(xyz = 2\), so \(z = \frac{2}{xy}\). Then, the expression to minimize becomes:

\[
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4\left(\frac{2}{xy}\right)^4
\]

Simplify the last term:

\[
4\left(\frac{16}{x^4 y^4}\right) = \frac{64}{x^4 y^4}
\]

So, the expression is:

\[
x^4 + 4y^2 + \frac{64}{x^4 y^4}
\]

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can now consider this as a function of two variables \(x\) and \(y\), and try to find its minimum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to reduce the number of variables. Let me set \(a = x^4\), \(b = y^2\), and \(c = z^4\). Then, the expression becomes \(a + 4b + 4c\), and the constraint \(xyz = 2\) can be written as \(x y z = 2\). But since \(x = a^{1/4}\), \(y = b^{1/2}\), \(z = c^{1/4}\), so:

\[
a^{1/4} \cdot b^{1/2} \cdot c^{1/4} = 2
\]

Let me write this constraint as:

\[
a^{1/4} c^{1/4} b^{1/2} = 2
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
(a c)^{1/4} b^{1/2} = 2
\]

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but perhaps I can also express the constraint in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and then use AM-GM.

Wait, let me think: If I have the expression \(a + 4b + 4c\), with a constraint on \(a^{1/4} b^{1/2} c^{1/4} = 2\), maybe I can use weighted AM-GM.

But I'm not sure about the weights. Alternatively, maybe I can assign variables such that each term in the expression has the same exponent.

Wait, another approach: Let me try to use the method of Lagrange multipliers, since it's a constrained optimization problem. So, let me set up the function to minimize:

\(f(x, y, z) = x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\)

Subject to the constraint \(g(x, y, z) = xyz - 2 = 0\).

The method of Lagrange multipliers tells us that at the minimum, the gradient of \(f\) is proportional to the gradient of \(g\). That is:

\[
\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g
\]

Calculating the gradients:

First, \(\nabla f = (4x^3, 8y, 16z^3)\)

Second, \(\nabla g = (yz, xz, xy)\)

So, setting up the equations:

1. \(4x^3 = \lambda yz\)
2. \(8y = \lambda xz\)
3. \(16z^3 = \lambda xy\)

And the constraint:

4. \(xyz = 2\)

So, now I have four equations with four variables (\(x\), \(y\), \(z\), \(\lambda\)). Let me try to solve these equations.

From equation 1: \(4x^3 = \lambda yz\) => \(\lambda = \frac{4x^3}{yz}\)

From equation 2: \(8y = \lambda xz\) => Substitute \(\lambda\) from equation 1:

\(8y = \frac{4x^3}{yz} \cdot xz\)

Simplify the right side:

\(\frac{4x^3}{yz} \cdot xz = \frac{4x^4 z}{yz} = \frac{4x^4}{y}\)

So, equation 2 becomes:

\(8y = \frac{4x^4}{y}\)

Multiply both sides by \(y\):

\(8y^2 = 4x^4\)

Divide both sides by 4:

\(2y^2 = x^4\) => \(x^4 = 2y^2\) => \(x^2 = \sqrt{2} y\) (since \(x\) and \(y\) are positive)

So, \(x^2 = \sqrt{2} y\) => \(y = \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2}}\)

Similarly, let's use equation 3:

\(16z^3 = \lambda xy\)

Again, substitute \(\lambda = \frac{4x^3}{yz}\):

\(16z^3 = \frac{4x^3}{yz} \cdot xy = \frac{4x^4}{z}\)

So, equation 3 becomes:

\(16z^3 = \frac{4x^4}{z}\)

Multiply both sides by \(z\):

\(16z^4 = 4x^4\)

Divide both sides by 4:

\(4z^4 = x^4\) => \(z^4 = \frac{x^4}{4}\) => \(z = \frac{x}{\sqrt[4]{4}} = \frac{x}{2^{1/4}} = x \cdot 2^{-1/4}\)

So, now we have expressions for \(y\) and \(z\) in terms of \(x\):

- \(y = \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2}}\)
- \(z = \frac{x}{2^{1/4}}\)

Now, let's plug these into the constraint \(xyz = 2\):

\[
x \cdot \left(\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{x}{2^{1/4}}\right) = 2
\]

Simplify the left side:

Multiply the terms:

\(x \cdot \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{x}{2^{1/4}} = \frac{x^4}{\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/4}}\)

Simplify the denominator:

\(\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}\), so:

\[
\frac{x^4}{2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/4}} = \frac{x^4}{2^{3/4}}
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{x^4}{2^{3/4}} = 2
\]

Multiply both sides by \(2^{3/4}\):

\[
x^4 = 2 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 2^{1 + 3/4} = 2^{7/4}
\]

Therefore, \(x = \left(2^{7/4}\right)^{1/4} = 2^{7/16}\). Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check.

Wait, no, if \(x^4 = 2^{7/4}\), then \(x = \left(2^{7/4}\right)^{1/4} = 2^{7/16}\). Hmm, that's not a clean exponent. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me retrace:

We had:

\(xyz = 2\)

Expressed \(y\) and \(z\) in terms of \(x\):

- \(y = x^2 / \sqrt{2}\)
- \(z = x / 2^{1/4}\)

Therefore,

\(x \cdot (x^2 / \sqrt{2}) \cdot (x / 2^{1/4}) = x \cdot x^2 \cdot x / (\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/4}) = x^4 / (2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/4}) = x^4 / 2^{3/4}\)

Set equal to 2:

\(x^4 / 2^{3/4} = 2\)

Multiply both sides by \(2^{3/4}\):

\(x^4 = 2 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 2^{1 + 3/4} = 2^{7/4}\)

So, \(x = (2^{7/4})^{1/4} = 2^{7/16}\)

Hmm, so \(x = 2^{7/16}\), which is approximately, but we can keep it as is.

Then, compute \(y = x^2 / \sqrt{2} = (2^{7/16})^2 / 2^{1/2} = 2^{7/8} / 2^{1/2} = 2^{7/8 - 4/8} = 2^{3/8}\)

Similarly, \(z = x / 2^{1/4} = 2^{7/16} / 2^{4/16} = 2^{3/16}\)

So, now we have:

- \(x = 2^{7/16}\)
- \(y = 2^{3/8}\)
- \(z = 2^{3/16}\)

Let me check if these values satisfy the original constraint \(xyz = 2\):

Compute \(x \cdot y \cdot z = 2^{7/16} \cdot 2^{3/8} \cdot 2^{3/16}\)

Convert all exponents to 16 denominator:

- \(7/16\)
- \(3/8 = 6/16\)
- \(3/16\)

Adding them: 7 + 6 + 3 = 16, so total exponent is 16/16 = 1

Thus, \(xyz = 2^1 = 2\), which is correct.

Okay, so these values are consistent with the constraint.

Now, let's compute the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\) with these values.

First, compute \(x^4\):

\(x = 2^{7/16}\), so \(x^4 = (2^{7/16})^4 = 2^{7/16 \cdot 4} = 2^{7/4}\)

Next, compute \(4y^2\):

\(y = 2^{3/8}\), so \(y^2 = (2^{3/8})^2 = 2^{6/8} = 2^{3/4}\), and multiplying by 4: \(4 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 2^2 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 2^{11/4}\)

Similarly, compute \(4z^4\):

\(z = 2^{3/16}\), so \(z^4 = (2^{3/16})^4 = 2^{12/16} = 2^{3/4}\), multiplying by 4: \(4 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 2^2 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 2^{11/4}\)

So, now adding them up:

\(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 = 2^{7/4} + 2^{11/4} + 2^{11/4}\)

Combine like terms:

First, note that \(2^{11/4} + 2^{11/4} = 2 \cdot 2^{11/4} = 2^{1 + 11/4} = 2^{15/4}\)

So, total expression becomes:

\(2^{7/4} + 2^{15/4}\)

Factor out \(2^{7/4}\):

\(2^{7/4} (1 + 2^{(15/4 - 7/4)}) = 2^{7/4} (1 + 2^{8/4}) = 2^{7/4} (1 + 2^2) = 2^{7/4} \cdot 5\)

So, \(5 \cdot 2^{7/4}\)

Simplify \(2^{7/4}\):

\(2^{7/4} = 2^{1 + 3/4} = 2 \cdot 2^{3/4}\)

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\(5 \cdot 2 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\)

Hmm, so the minimal value is \(10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\). Let me see if that's correct.

Wait, but earlier when I tried using AM-GM, I was getting a different expression. Maybe the AM-GM approach wasn't directly applicable, and Lagrange multipliers give a more precise answer here.

But let me verify if \(10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\) is indeed the minimum.

Wait, 2^{3/4} is equal to \(\sqrt[4]{8}\), since \(2^3 = 8\). So, \(10 \cdot \sqrt[4]{8}\). Alternatively, 2^{3/4} can be written as \(2^{0.75}\), which is approximately 1.6818, so 10 times that is approximately 16.818.

But let me check if this is indeed the minimum.

Alternatively, maybe I can test another approach using AM-GM on the original expression.

Let me try to write the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\) as a sum of terms and apply AM-GM.

I can write it as:

\(x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^4 + 2z^4\)

So, five terms in total. Let me apply AM-GM to these five terms:

\[
\frac{x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^4 + 2z^4}{5} \geq \sqrt[5]{x^4 \cdot (2y^2) \cdot (2y^2) \cdot (2z^4) \cdot (2z^4)}
\]

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake in the AM-GM application earlier because I considered the product incorrectly. Let me correct that.

The product inside the fifth root should be the product of all five terms, which are \(x^4\), \(2y^2\), \(2y^2\), \(2z^4\), \(2z^4\). So, the product is:

\[
x^4 \cdot (2y^2) \cdot (2y^2) \cdot (2z^4) \cdot (2z^4) = x^4 \cdot (2y^2)^2 \cdot (2z^4)^2 = x^4 \cdot 4y^4 \cdot 4z^8 = x^4 \cdot 16y^4z^8
\]

So, the geometric mean is:

\[
\sqrt[5]{16x^4y^4z^8}
\]

Which I had earlier as \(2^{4/5} \cdot x^{4/5}y^{4/5}z^{8/5}\). Then, using the constraint \(xyz = 2\), I tried to express this in terms of \(x\), \(y\), \(z\), but it got a bit convoluted.

However, with the Lagrange multipliers, I found a concrete value. So, perhaps I can compute it numerically to see if it makes sense.

Wait, let's compute \(10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\).

First, \(2^{1/4}\) is approximately 1.1892, so \(2^{3/4} = (2^{1/4})^3 \approx 1.1892^3 \approx 1.6818\), so 10 times that is approximately 16.818.

Alternatively, with the AM-GM approach, let's see if we can get a similar or lower value.

Wait, perhaps I can apply AM-GM differently. Let me try to split the expression into more terms so that the exponents can be balanced.

Let me consider the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\). Let's think about how to apply AM-GM with weights. Maybe I can use the method of weighted AM-GM.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use substitution. Let me consider the constraint \(xyz = 2\). Let me set \(a = x\), \(b = y\), \(c = z\), but maybe change variables to make \(xyz = 1\). Hmm, since the constraint is \(xyz = 2\), but if I let \(x' = x\), \(y' = y\), \(z' = z\sqrt{2}\), then \(x' y' z' = x \cdot y \cdot z\sqrt{2} = 2 \sqrt{2}\), which is not 1. Maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, set \(x = \sqrt[4]{a}\), \(y = \sqrt{b}\), \(z = \sqrt[4]{c}\), so that \(xyz = \sqrt[4]{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} \cdot \sqrt[4]{c} = (a c)^{1/4} b^{1/2}\). But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I can use substitution to reduce the number of variables. Since \(xyz = 2\), I can set \(x = 2^{1/4} t\), \(y = 2^{1/2} u\), \(z = t\), but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, since I have from Lagrange multipliers that the minimal value is \(10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\), perhaps that is the correct answer. Let me see if I can verify it with another method.

Wait, going back to the AM-GM approach, maybe I can split the terms differently.

Let me consider the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\). Let me write this as \(x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^4 + 2z^4\), which is five terms. Then, applying AM-GM:

\[
\frac{x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^4 + 2z^4}{5} \geq \sqrt[5]{x^4 \cdot (2y^2) \cdot (2y^2) \cdot (2z^4) \cdot (2z^4)} = \sqrt[5]{16x^4y^4z^8}
\]

Which is the same as before. So, the AM-GM gives:

\[
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \geq 5 \cdot \sqrt[5]{16x^4y^4z^8}
\]

But since \(xyz = 2\), let's express \(x^4y^4z^8\) in terms of \(xyz\):

\[
x^4y^4z^8 = (xyz)^4 \cdot z^4 = (2)^4 \cdot z^4 = 16 z^4
\]

Wait, but that seems different from earlier. Wait, no:

Wait, \(x^4y^4z^8 = (xyz)^4 \cdot z^4 = 2^4 \cdot z^4 = 16 z^4\). Hmm, so then:

\[
\sqrt[5]{16x^4y^4z^8} = \sqrt[5]{16 \cdot 16 z^4} = \sqrt[5]{256 z^4} = \sqrt[5]{256} \cdot \sqrt[5]{z^4} = 256^{1/5} \cdot z^{4/5}
\]

But \(256 = 2^8\), so:

\[
256^{1/5} = 2^{8/5}
\]

Thus:

\[
\sqrt[5]{16x^4y^4z^8} = 2^{8/5} \cdot z^{4/5}
\]

So, the AM-GM inequality gives:

\[
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \geq 5 \cdot 2^{8/5} \cdot z^{4/5}
\]

But this still leaves us with a term involving \(z\), which isn't directly helpful because we have a constraint on \(xyz\). Hmm, so unless we can express \(z\) in terms of the constraint, perhaps using the relation from Lagrange multipliers.

Wait, from earlier, we found \(z = \frac{x}{2^{1/4}}\), so \(z^{4/5} = \left(\frac{x}{2^{1/4}}\right)^{4/5} = \frac{x^{4/5}}{2^{1/5}}\).

So, substituting back:

\[
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \geq 5 \cdot 2^{8/5} \cdot \frac{x^{4/5}}{2^{1/5}} = 5 \cdot 2^{(8/5 - 1/5)} \cdot x^{4/5} = 5 \cdot 2^{7/5} \cdot x^{4/5}
\]

Hmm, now this is an expression in terms of \(x\). But without another relation, I can't solve for \(x\) directly. It seems like we need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps if I use the Lagrange multipliers result, which gives specific values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), I can plug those into the AM-GM inequality to see if equality is achieved.

So, from Lagrange multipliers, we have \(x = 2^{7/16}\), \(y = 2^{3/8}\), \(z = 2^{3/16}\).

Let me compute each term in the AM-GM expression:

First, \(x^4 = (2^{7/16})^4 = 2^{7/4}\)

Second, \(2y^2 = 2 \cdot (2^{3/8})^2 = 2 \cdot 2^{6/8} = 2 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 2^{1 + 3/4} = 2^{7/4}\)

Third, \(2z^4 = 2 \cdot (2^{3/16})^4 = 2 \cdot 2^{12/16} = 2 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 2^{1 + 3/4} = 2^{7/4}\)

So, all five terms in the AM-GM are equal to \(2^{7/4}\). Therefore, the AM-GM inequality becomes:

\[
\frac{5 \cdot 2^{7/4}}{5} \geq 2^{7/4}
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
2^{7/4} \geq 2^{7/4}
\]

Which is equality. Therefore, the AM-GM inequality achieves equality here, meaning that this is indeed the minimum value.

So, the minimal value is \(5 \cdot 2^{7/4}\), which is what I found using Lagrange multipliers.

Wait, let me see: AM-GM gives the lower bound as \(5 \cdot 2^{7/4}\), and the Lagrange multipliers give an expression that exactly achieves this bound. Therefore, \(5 \cdot 2^{7/4}\) is indeed the minimum.

Alternatively, let me compute \(5 \cdot 2^{7/4}\) as a numerical value to get a sense.

First, \(2^{7/4} = 2^{1.75} \approx 2^{1} \cdot 2^{0.75} = 2 \cdot 1.6818 \approx 3.3636\). So, \(5 \times 3.3636 \approx 16.818\).

If I compute the original expression with the values found:

\(x = 2^{7/16}\), so \(x^4 = 2^{7/4} \approx 3.3636\)

\(y = 2^{3/8}\), so \(4y^2 = 4 \cdot (2^{3/8})^2 = 4 \cdot 2^{6/8} = 4 \cdot 2^{3/4} \approx 4 \cdot 1.6818 \approx 6.727\)

Similarly, \(z = 2^{3/16}\), so \(4z^4 = 4 \cdot (2^{3/16})^4 = 4 \cdot 2^{12/16} = 4 \cdot 2^{3/4} \approx 4 \cdot 1.6818 \approx 6.727\)

Adding them up: 3.3636 + 6.727 + 6.727 ≈ 16.817, which matches the earlier approximation.

Therefore, both methods confirm that the minimal value is \(5 \cdot 2^{7/4}\).

But let me see if I can express \(5 \cdot 2^{7/4}\) in a different way for simplicity.

Since \(2^{7/4} = 2^{1 + 3/4} = 2 \cdot 2^{3/4}\), so:

\[
5 \cdot 2^{7/4} = 5 \cdot 2 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 10 \cdot 2^{3/4}
\]

Alternatively, \(2^{3/4}\) is the fourth root of \(8\), so \(10 \cdot \sqrt[4]{8}\).

Alternatively, writing \(2^{3/4}\) as \(e^{(3/4)\ln 2}\), but that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps expressing the exponent as a fraction:

\(2^{3/4}\) is equal to \(\sqrt[4]{8}\), so:

\[
10 \cdot \sqrt[4]{8}
\]

But I think \(5 \cdot 2^{7/4}\) is a concise way to write it.

Alternatively, using exponents:

\(2^{7/4} = (2^{1/4})^7\), but that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, note that \(2^{7/4} = \sqrt[4]{2^7} = \sqrt[4]{128}\), so:

\[
5 \cdot \sqrt[4]{128}
\]

But 128 is 2^7, so that's consistent.

Alternatively, since 128 is 16 * 8, so \(\sqrt[4]{128} = \sqrt[4]{16 \cdot 8} = \sqrt[4]{16} \cdot \sqrt[4]{8} = 2 \cdot 2^{3/4}\), which brings us back to \(2^{7/4}\).

So, perhaps the simplest expression is \(10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\), or \(5 \cdot 2^{7/4}\).

But let me check if there's a way to write it as a multiple of a single radical.

Since \(2^{3/4} = \sqrt[4]{8}\), so \(10 \cdot \sqrt[4]{8}\).

But \(\sqrt[4]{8}\) can also be written as \(8^{1/4} = (2^3)^{1/4} = 2^{3/4}\), so that's consistent.

Alternatively, rationalizing the exponent:

\(10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\) is the simplest form.

So, in conclusion, after setting up the problem, applying the AM-GM inequality, and then verifying with Lagrange multipliers, the minimal value of the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\) given \(xyz = 2\) is \(10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\).

But wait, let me double-check the arithmetic with the values I found. So, \(x = 2^{7/16}\), \(y = 2^{3/8}\), and \(z = 2^{3/16}\).

Compute \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\):

- \(x^4 = (2^{7/16})^4 = 2^{7/4}\)
- \(4y^2 = 4 \cdot (2^{3/8})^2 = 4 \cdot 2^{6/8} = 4 \cdot 2^{3/4}\)
- \(4z^4 = 4 \cdot (2^{3/16})^4 = 4 \cdot 2^{12/16} = 4 \cdot 2^{3/4}\)

Therefore, adding them together:

\(2^{7/4} + 4 \cdot 2^{3/4} + 4 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 2^{7/4} + 8 \cdot 2^{3/4}\)

Wait, hold on, that's not what I had earlier. Wait, no, I think I miscalculated.

Wait, in the Lagrange multipliers, I thought:

- \(x^4 = 2^{7/4}\)
- \(4y^2 = 2^{11/4}\)
- \(4z^4 = 2^{11/4}\)

But now, when I compute it again, I have \(4y^2 = 4 \cdot 2^{3/4}\), which is \(2^2 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 2^{11/4}\). Similarly, \(4z^4 = 2^{11/4}\). So, \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 = 2^{7/4} + 2^{11/4} + 2^{11/4}\), which is equal to \(2^{7/4} + 2 \cdot 2^{11/4}\).

But \(2^{11/4} = 2^{7/4 + 1} = 2^{7/4} \cdot 2^{1} = 2 \cdot 2^{7/4}\), so:

\(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 = 2^{7/4} + 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2^{7/4} = 2^{7/4} + 4 \cdot 2^{7/4} = 5 \cdot 2^{7/4}\)

Wait, that's different from my earlier miscalculation. So, actually, \(4y^2\) and \(4z^4\) each equal \(2^{11/4}\), which is \(2 \cdot 2^{7/4}\), so each is \(2^{11/4} = 2^{7/4 + 1} = 2 \cdot 2^{7/4}\). So, adding them together:

\(2^{7/4} + 2 \cdot 2^{7/4} + 2 \cdot 2^{7/4} = 2^{7/4} + 4 \cdot 2^{7/4} = 5 \cdot 2^{7/4}\)

So, that's consistent. So, the minimal value is indeed \(5 \cdot 2^{7/4}\), which is approximately 16.818.

Therefore, after careful consideration and verifying through both AM-GM and Lagrange multipliers, the minimal value is \(5 \cdot 2^{7/4}\).

**Final Answer**
The minimum value is \boxed{10 \sqrt[4]{2}}.

Wait, hold on, 10 multiplied by the fourth root of 2 is \(10 \cdot 2^{1/4}\), which is different from \(5 \cdot 2^{7/4}\). Wait, no, because \(2^{7/4} = 2^{1 + 3/4} = 2 \cdot 2^{3/4}\), so \(5 \cdot 2^{7/4} = 5 \cdot 2 \cdot 2^{3/4} = 10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\), which is different from \(10 \cdot 2^{1/4}\).

Wait, so in the final answer above, I wrote \boxed{10 \sqrt[4]{2}}, which is \(10 \cdot 2^{1/4}\), but the correct minimal value is \(10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\), since \(2^{7/4} = 2 \cdot 2^{3/4}\), so \(5 \cdot 2^{7/4} = 10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\).

Therefore, the correct minimal value is \(10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\), which can be written as \(10 \sqrt[4]{8}\), or \(10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\).

But in the final answer, I mistakenly wrote \boxed{10 \sqrt[4]{2}}, which is incorrect because it should be \(10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\). Let me correct that.

So, the correct minimal value is \(10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\), which can be written as \boxed{10 \sqrt[4]{8}}.

But wait, let me check if \(2^{3/4}\) is equal to \(\sqrt[4]{8}\). Yes, because \(8^{1/4} = (2^3)^{1/4} = 2^{3/4}\). So, both expressions are equivalent.

Therefore, the minimal value is \(\boxed{10 \sqrt[4]{8}}\) or \(\boxed{10 \cdot 2^{3/4}}\).

But perhaps, in the answer, it's more standard to write it as \(10 \cdot 2^{3/4}\), so I'll stick with that.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value is \boxed{10 \cdot 2^{3/4}}.

Given the problem of finding the minimum value of the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\) subject to the constraint \(xyz = 2\) where \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are positive real numbers, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers and the AM-GM inequality to solve it.

First, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We set up the function to minimize:

\[
f(x, y, z) = x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4
\]

Subject to the constraint:

\[
g(x, y, z) = xyz - 2 = 0
\]

We introduce the Lagrange multiplier \(\lambda\) and set up the system of equations:

1. \(4x^3 = \lambda yz\)
2. \(8y = \lambda xz\)
3. \(16z^3 = \lambda xy\)
4. \(xyz = 2\)

By solving these equations, we find the relationships between \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):

- \(y = \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2}}\)
- \(z = \frac{x}{2^{1/4}}\)

Substituting these into the constraint \(xyz = 2\), we solve for \(x\):

\[
x \cdot \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{x}{2^{1/4}} = 2
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
x = 2^{7/16}, \quad y = 2^{3/8}, \quad z = 2^{3/16}
\]

We then compute the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\):

- \(x^4 = 2^{7/4}\)
- \(4y^2 = 4 \cdot (2^{3/8})^2 = 2^{11/4}\)
- \(4z^4 = 4 \cdot (2^{3/16})^4 = 2^{11/4}\)

Adding these together:

\[
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 = 2^{7/4} + 2^{11/4} + 2^{11/4} = 2^{7/4} + 2 \cdot 2^{11/4} = 5 \cdot 2^{7/4}
\]

Thus, the minimum value is:

\[
5 \cdot 2^{7/4} = 10 \cdot 2^{3/4}
\]

Therefore, the minimum value is \(\boxed{10 \cdot 2^{3/4}}\).
