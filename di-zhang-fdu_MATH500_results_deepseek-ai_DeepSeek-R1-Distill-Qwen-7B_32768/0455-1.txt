In the diagram, $PT$ is parallel to $QR.$ What is the measure of $\angle PQR$ in degrees?

draw((0,0)--(10,0),black+linewidth(1));
draw((0,0)--(10,0),MidArrow);
draw((10,0)--(20,0),black+linewidth(1));
draw((0,0)--(-7,10)--(7,10)--(10,0),black+linewidth(1));
draw((-5,10)--(7,10),MidArrow);

label("$T$",(7,10),N);
label("$R$",(10,0),S);
label("$Q$",(0,0),S);
[/asy]

Correct Answer:
Since $PT$ and $RQ$ are parallel, then $2x^\circ=128^\circ,$ so $x=64,$ so $\angle TPQ=64^\circ.$

[asy]
draw((0,0)--(10,0),black+linewidth(1));
draw((0,0)--(10,0),MidArrow);
draw((10,0)--(20,0),black+linewidth(1));
draw((0,0)--(-7,10)--(7,10)--(10,0),black+linewidth(1));
draw((-5,10)--(7,10),MidArrow);
label("$x^{\circ}$",(-6,10),SE);
label("$2x^{\circ}$",(7,10),SW);
label("$128^{\circ}$",(10,0),NE);
label("$P$",(-7,10),N);
label("$T$",(7,10),N);
label("$R$",(10,0),S);
label("$Q$",(0,0),S);
[/asy]

Since $PT$ and $QR$ are parallel, then $\angle TPQ$ and $\angle PQR$ are supplementary. Thus, $\angle PQR + 64^\circ = 180^\circ,$ so $\angle PQR = \boxed{116} \text{ degrees}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here with a diagram. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a diagram with points labeled P, T, Q, R. From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are some lines: PT is drawn from (-7,10) to (7,10), which is parallel to QR, drawn from (0,0) to (10,0). Then there's a line from (10,0) to (20,0). So, QR is the base, PT is a line above QR, and there are some other lines connected.

The labels say that PT is parallel to QR, and we have to find the measure of angle PQR. Hmm, okay. Let me think about the diagram. So, point Q is at (0,0), R is at (10,0), T is at (7,10), and P is at (-7,10). There's a line from Q to P, and another from Q to T. The angles at T and P are labeled as x degrees and 2x degrees respectively. Also, there's an angle of 128 degrees at R.

Wait, so angle at R is 128 degrees. That might be angle QRT or something else? Let me confirm. In the diagram, the label 128 degrees is placed at (10,0), NE direction. So, NE from (10,0) would be towards the top-right. So, perhaps that's the angle at R between QR and the line going to some other point? Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws from (10,0) to (20,0), which is a straight line, but also from (0,0) to (-7,10) and (0,0) to (7,10). So, point R is connected to T and to another point, maybe.

Wait, maybe the angle at R is between QR and RT? Because R is connected to T, which is at (7,10). So, angle QRT is 128 degrees. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, PT is parallel to QR. So, PT is the top line from (-7,10) to (7,10), and QR is the base from (0,0) to (10,0). So, these are two horizontal lines? Wait, no, because QR is from (0,0) to (10,0), which is horizontal, but PT is from (-7,10) to (7,10), so that's also horizontal. So, PT is parallel to QR, which are both horizontal lines.

But then, the lines from Q to P and from T to R might form some triangles or something? Hmm, maybe triangle QPT or something else.

Wait, the Asymptote code draws from (0,0) to (-7,10) to (7,10) to (10,0), so that's a quadrilateral Q-P-T-R. So, it's like a trapezoid? Because PT is parallel to QR. So, Q-P-T-R is a trapezoid with bases PT and QR, which are parallel. So, that's helpful.

So, in the trapezoid Q-P-T-R, we have angles at P and T labeled as x and 2x degrees, respectively. So, angle at P is x degrees, angle at T is 2x degrees. Also, angle at R is 128 degrees. So, we need to find angle PQR, which is the angle at Q.

Wait, angle PQR is the angle at Q between points P, Q, and R. So, in the trapezoid, angle at Q is angle PQR, which is what we need to find.

Alright, so let's recall some properties of trapezoids. In a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. That is, the sum of the angles on the same side is 180 degrees. So, for example, angle at Q and angle at T should add up to 180 degrees, and angle at P and angle at R should add up to 180 degrees.

So, if I denote angle Q as angle PQR, which is what we need, and angle R is 128 degrees, then angle P and angle T should be related.

Wait, but let me clarify. In trapezoid Q-P-T-R, sides QR and PT are the two bases, so they are parallel. So, angles at Q and T are on the same side, as are angles at P and R.

So, angle Q and angle T are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Similarly, angle P and angle R add up to 180 degrees.

But in the problem, angles at P and T are given as x and 2x. So, angle P is x, angle T is 2x. So, angle P and angle R are supplementary. That means angle P + angle R = 180 degrees.

Given angle R is 128 degrees, so angle P = 180 - 128 = 52 degrees. Therefore, x = 52 degrees.

So, angle T is 2x = 104 degrees.

Then, since angle Q and angle T are supplementary, angle Q + angle T = 180 degrees. So, angle Q = 180 - angle T = 180 - 104 = 76 degrees.

Therefore, angle PQR is 76 degrees.

Wait, let me just go through this again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So, trapezoid Q-P-T-R with bases QR and PT. Angles at P and T are x and 2x, respectively. Angle at R is 128 degrees.

First, using the property that consecutive angles on the same side of a trapezoid are supplementary.

So, angle P (x) and angle R (128) add up to 180. So, x = 180 - 128 = 52. Correct.

Then, angle T is 2x = 104 degrees.

Then, angle Q and angle T are on the same side, so they add up to 180. Therefore, angle Q = 180 - 104 = 76 degrees.

Therefore, angle PQR is 76 degrees.

Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if I'm interpreting the trapezoid correctly.

Looking back at the Asymptote code, the points are Q(0,0), R(10,0), T(7,10), P(-7,10). So, connecting Q to P to T to R to Q.

So, sides are QP, PT, TR, RQ.

So, bases are QR and PT. So, QR is from (0,0) to (10,0), PT is from (-7,10) to (7,10). So, yes, they're parallel because they're both horizontal.

Therefore, angles at P and R are on different sides.

Wait, angle at P is between QP and PT, and angle at R is between TR and RQ.

So, in the trapezoid, angle at P is x, angle at T is 2x, angle at R is 128 degrees, and angle at Q is what we need.

Therefore, using the consecutive angles property:

Angle P + angle R = 180 => x + 128 = 180 => x = 52.

Angle T + angle Q = 180 => 2x + angle Q = 180 => 104 + angle Q = 180 => angle Q = 76.

So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe we can use triangle properties or something else, but since it's a trapezoid, the consecutive angles property is sufficient.

Alternatively, if I consider triangle QRT, but I don't think that's necessary because trapezoid approach seems straightforward.

So, yeah, angle PQR is 76 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The measure of $\angle PQR$ is $\boxed{76}$ degrees.

Given that \(PT\) is parallel to \(QR\), we need to find the measure of \(\angle PQR\).

1. Identify the trapezoid \(Q-P-T-R\) with \(PT\) and \(QR\) as the parallel sides (bases).
2. The angles at \(P\) and \(R\) are supplementary because they are consecutive angles on the same side of the trapezoid.
3. Given \(\angle R = 128^\circ\), we use the supplementary angle property:
   \[
   \angle P + \angle R = 180^\circ
   \]
   Substituting the known value:
   \[
   \angle P + 128^\circ = 180^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(\angle P\):
   \[
   \angle P = 180^\circ - 128^\circ = 52^\circ
   \]
4. Given \(\angle P = x\) and \(\angle T = 2x\), we find \(x\):
   \[
   x = 52^\circ
   \]
5. Calculate \(\angle T\):
   \[
   \angle T = 2x = 2 \times 52^\circ = 104^\circ
   \]
6. Use the supplementary angle property for angles at \(Q\) and \(T\):
   \[
   \angle Q + \angle T = 180^\circ
   \]
   Substituting the known value:
   \[
   \angle Q + 104^\circ = 180^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(\angle Q\):
   \[
   \angle Q = 180^\circ - 104^\circ = 76^\circ
   \]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle PQR\) is \(\boxed{76}\) degrees.
