Correct Answer:
Triangle $AFD$ must have a total angle measure of $180^\circ$. We know that the other two angles have measures of $2x$ and $2y$, so angle $AFD$ must have a measure of $180-2x-2y=180-(2x+2y)$ degrees. We now look at quadrilateral $ABCD$, whose interior angle measures must sum to $360^\circ$. Therefore, we have that $110^\circ +100^\circ +3y+3x=360^\circ$, so $3x+3y=150^\circ$. We want to find $2x+2y$, so we multiply both sides of the equation by $2/3$ to get that $2x+2y=100^\circ$. We can now substitute in $100^\circ$ for $2x+2y$ to find that the measure of angle $AFD$ is $180-(2x+2y)=180-100=\boxed{80}$ degrees.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the measure of angle AFD in this quadrilateral ABCD. Let me try to understand the problem first.

From the Asymptote code, it looks like we have quadrilateral ABCD with points A, B, C, D. The Asymptote drawing shows A at the origin, B at (2,4), C at (7,4), and D at (7,-2). So, A is connected to B, B to C, C to D, and D back to A. Then there are points E and F connected in some way. From the labels, E is near the top, and F is near the middle-left.

Looking at the Asymptote code again, it mentions that angles BAD and CDA are trisected. So, angle BAD is being trisected, and angle CDA is being trisected as well. The figure is drawn with Asymptote, which is a vector graphics language, so I can see the exact positions of points E and F.

The Asymptote code also labels some angles as x and y. There are three x's and three y's, each labeled at different positions. Additionally, it labels angle AFD as 110 degrees and angle at another point as 100 degrees. Wait, actually, looking back, the Asymptote code says:

label("$110^{\circ}$",(2.5,3.5)); label("$100^{\circ}$",(6.5-.2,3.5));

So, there are two specific angles labeled: 110 degrees and 100 degrees. Hmm, that might be helpful.

So, in the problem, it says that angles BAD and CDA are trisected. That means each of these angles is divided into three equal parts. So, if angle BAD is trisected, each smaller angle would be one-third of angle BAD. Similarly, angle CDA is trisected, so each smaller angle is one-third of angle CDA.

Looking at quadrilateral ABCD, since it's a four-sided figure, the sum of the interior angles should be (4-2)*180 = 360 degrees. So, the total sum of angles at A, B, C, D is 360 degrees.

Given that, we need to find the measure of angle AFD. Looking at the Asymptote code, point F is somewhere inside the quadrilateral, connected to A and D, forming triangle AFD. So, angle AFD is the angle at point F between points A and D.

To approach this, let me try to figure out the measures of angles at A and D first, since those are being trisected. But wait, I don't know the measures of angles BAD and CDA. Hmm, maybe I can find those using the information given.

Looking back, the Asymptote code labels some angles as x and y. Specifically, near point A, there are three angles labeled x, each probably one of the trisected angles. Similarly, near point D, there are three angles labeled y.

Wait, actually, the Asymptote code labels three angles as x and three as y. Let me parse that:

label("$x$", (1, 1.5), S); label("$x$", (2, 1), S+W); label("$x$", (2, -1), N+N+N+W);

And similarly for y:

label("$y$", (5.5+.3, .5-.3), S); label("$y$", (6.5+.3, 0)); label("$y$", (5+.5, -1.5+.3));

So, the x labels are near (1,1.5), (2,1), and (2,-1). The point (1,1.5) is near the segment AB, so that's near point A, which is connected to B. Similarly, (2,1) is a bit to the right, and (2,-1) is near the extension below A.

Similarly, the y labels are near (5.5+.3, .5-.3), which is near the segment BC, then near (6.5+.3, 0), which is near segment CD, and (5+.5, -1.5+.3), which is near segment DA.

So, in the figure, each trisection angle is labeled x or y. So, if angles BAD and CDA are trisected, each trisection angle is either x or y, depending on which angle we're looking at.

Wait, but angle BAD is at point A, and angle CDA is at point D. So, angle BAD is being trisected into three angles, each labeled x, and angle CDA is being trisected into three angles, each labeled y.

But the labels are a bit confusing because of their positions. Maybe I should try to figure out the measures of angles BAD and CDA.

Looking at the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with specific coordinates. Maybe I can calculate the angles BAD and CDA using the coordinates.

Point A is at (0,0), B is at (2,4), so vector AB is (2,4). Point D is at (7,-2), so vector AD is (7,-2). So, angle BAD is the angle between vectors AB and AD.

To calculate angle BAD, I can use the dot product formula.

The formula for the angle between two vectors u and v is:

cos(theta) = (u . v) / (|u| |v|)

So, vector AB is (2,4), vector AD is (7,-2).

Compute the dot product: (2)(7) + (4)(-2) = 14 - 8 = 6.

Compute |AB|: sqrt(2^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(4 + 16) = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5).

Compute |AD|: sqrt(7^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(49 + 4) = sqrt(53).

So, cos(theta) = 6 / (2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(53)) = 6 / (2*sqrt(265)) = 3 / sqrt(265).

Compute theta: arccos(3 / sqrt(265)).

Let me compute this in degrees.

First, sqrt(265) is approximately sqrt(256 + 9) = 16.2788.

So, 3 / 16.2788 ≈ 0.184.

Then, arccos(0.184) is approximately 79.3 degrees.

So, angle BAD is approximately 79.3 degrees. Since it's being trisected, each trisected angle is about 79.3 / 3 ≈ 26.43 degrees.

Similarly, angle CDA is at point D. Let's compute angle CDA.

Point C is at (7,4), D is at (7,-2). So, vector DC is (0,6), and vector DA is (-7,2).

Wait, to compute angle CDA, which is the angle at point D between points C, D, and A.

Vectors DC and DA. Vector DC is from D to C: (7-7,4 - (-2)) = (0,6). Vector DA is from D to A: (0 - 7, 0 - (-2)) = (-7, 2).

So, angle CDA is the angle between vectors DC (0,6) and DA (-7,2).

Again, using the dot product formula.

Dot product of DC and DA: (0)(-7) + (6)(2) = 0 + 12 = 12.

|DC| = sqrt(0^2 + 6^2) = 6.

|DA| = sqrt((-7)^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(49 + 4) = sqrt(53) ≈ 7.28.

So, cos(theta) = 12 / (6 * 7.28) ≈ 12 / 43.68 ≈ 0.275.

Thus, theta ≈ arccos(0.275) ≈ 74 degrees.

So, angle CDA is approximately 74 degrees. Since it's trisected, each trisected angle is about 74 / 3 ≈ 24.67 degrees.

Wait a second, so angle BAD is approximately 79.3 degrees, trisected into angles of about 26.43 degrees, and angle CDA is approximately 74 degrees, trisected into 24.67 degrees. Hmm, not exact, but close.

But maybe the exact measures are 80 and 75 degrees, which are nice numbers. Let me check.

If angle BAD is 80 degrees, then each trisected angle would be 80 / 3 ≈ 26.666 degrees.

Similarly, angle CDA is 75 degrees, each trisected angle is 25 degrees.

Hmm, that seems more manageable, and maybe that's what we need.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, specific angles are labeled as 110 degrees and 100 degrees. So, perhaps angle AFD is 110 degrees? But the problem is asking for angle AFD, so maybe 110 is correct, but I shouldn't jump to conclusions.

Alternatively, maybe the exact measures are such that angle AFD can be found using some geometric properties.

Let me think. Since angles BAD and CDA are trisected, and points E and F are connected, with E being near the trisection points on AB and AD, and F being somewhere inside the quadrilateral.

Given that, perhaps triangles AED and AFD are involved. Hmm.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, points E and F are connected, with E near the top left and F near the center left.

Looking at the figure, angle AFD is at point F between points A and D.

I need to find the measure of angle AFD.

Given that, maybe I can use the concept of Ceva's theorem or something similar, since we have trisection of angles.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines in some triangles.

Alternatively, since the figure is a quadrilateral with two angles being trisected, perhaps we can find some relationships between the sides or other angles.

Wait, another approach: in quadrilateral ABCD, we know two of the four angles: angle BAD and angle CDA. If I can find the other two angles at B and C, then perhaps I can figure out something about triangle AFD.

But without more information, maybe it's tricky.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, two specific angles are labeled: 110 degrees at (2.5,3.5) and 100 degrees at (6.5 - 0.2, 3.5). So, these are likely angles at points B and C, respectively.

Looking at the figure, point B is connected to A, C, and E. Point C is connected to B, D, and F.

So, angle at B is labeled 110 degrees, which is likely angle ABC.

Similarly, angle at C is labeled 100 degrees, which is likely angle BCD.

So, angle ABC is 110 degrees, angle BCD is 100 degrees.

Therefore, in quadrilateral ABCD, the four angles are:

- angle at A: BAD ≈ 80 degrees (but exact is needed)

- angle at B: ABC = 110 degrees

- angle at C: BCD = 100 degrees

- angle at D: CDA ≈ 75 degrees

Wait, but earlier, using coordinates, we found angle BAD ≈ 79.3 degrees, angle CDA ≈ 74 degrees. So, approximating to 80 and 75.

But maybe exact measures are 80 and 75, so that the trisection is exact.

So, if angle BAD is 80 degrees, each trisected angle is 80/3 ≈ 26.666 degrees.

Similarly, angle CDA is 75 degrees, each trisected angle is 75/3 = 25 degrees.

So, maybe that's the case.

Therefore, at point A, angle BAD is trisected into three angles of 26.666 degrees each.

Similarly, at point D, angle CDA is trisected into three angles of 25 degrees each.

So, in the figure, from point A, the angle is split into three angles of approximately 26.666 degrees each, so from AB to AE is 26.666, from AE to AF is another 26.666, and from AF to AD is the last 26.666.

Similarly, at point D, angle CDA is split into three angles of 25 degrees each. So, from DC to DF is 25 degrees, from DF to DE is another 25 degrees, and from DE to DA is the last 25 degrees.

Wait, but looking at the Asymptote code, the labels for the trisection angles are x and y, but the positions of E and F are in the figure.

Given that, maybe I can consider triangle AFD and use some trigonometric relationships.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the sum of angles in triangle AFD is 180 degrees.

But to find angle AFD, I need to know the other two angles at A and D in triangle AFD.

Wait, but in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are parts of the trisected angles of angle BAD and angle CDA.

So, if angle BAD is trisected, then in triangle AFD, the angle at A is 26.666 degrees (if angle BAD is 80 degrees). Similarly, if angle CDA is 75 degrees, then in triangle AFD, the angle at D is 25 degrees.

Wait, but is that correct? Because in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D may not necessarily be the entire trisected parts, because point F is somewhere inside the quadrilateral.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider some other triangles or use Ceva's theorem.

Wait, Ceva's theorem relates to concurrent lines in a triangle, but here we have a quadrilateral.

Alternatively, maybe I can extend some lines and form triangles within the quadrilateral.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the entire quadrilateral and the sum of its angles.

So, in quadrilateral ABCD, the sum of angles is 360 degrees.

Given angle ABC is 110 degrees, angle BCD is 100 degrees, angle BAD is approximately 80 degrees, angle CDA is approximately 75 degrees. Let me check:

80 + 110 + 100 + 75 = 365 degrees. Hmm, that's too much. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, in reality, the sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees, so perhaps my approximated angles are slightly off.

Wait, let me recast.

If angle BAD is 80 degrees, angle ABC is 110, angle BCD is 100, then angle ADC must be 360 - 80 - 110 - 100 = 70 degrees.

Wait, so angle ADC is 70 degrees. But earlier, I calculated angle CDA as 74 degrees, which is different. So, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps my coordinates were miscalculated.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, point A is (0,0), B is (2,4), C is (7,4), D is (7,-2). So, to compute angle BAD, which is at point A between BA and DA.

Vector BA is from A to B: (2,4). Vector DA is from A to D: (7,-2).

Wait, hold on, actually, angle BAD is the angle between BA and DA, but BA is from A to B, which is (2,4), and DA is from A to D, which is (7,-2).

Wait, so to compute angle BAD, it's the angle between vectors AB and AD.

Wait, vector AB is (2,4), vector AD is (7,-2). So, the angle between AB and AD is angle BAD.

So, using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (AB . AD) / (|AB| |AD|)

AB . AD = (2)(7) + (4)(-2) = 14 - 8 = 6

|AB| = sqrt(2^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(20) ≈ 4.472

|AD| = sqrt(7^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(49 + 4) = sqrt(53) ≈ 7.28

So, cos(theta) = 6 / (sqrt(20) * sqrt(53)) ≈ 6 / (4.472 * 7.28) ≈ 6 / 32.52 ≈ 0.184

So, theta ≈ arccos(0.184) ≈ 79.3 degrees, as I computed earlier.

Similarly, angle ADC is at point D, between vectors DC and DA.

Vector DC is from D to C: (0,6). Vector DA is from D to A: (-7,2).

So, angle ADC is the angle between DC (0,6) and DA (-7,2).

Dot product: (0)(-7) + (6)(2) = 0 + 12 = 12

|DC| = 6, |DA| = sqrt(49 + 4) = sqrt(53) ≈ 7.28

So, cos(theta) = 12 / (6 * 7.28) ≈ 12 / 43.68 ≈ 0.275

So, theta ≈ arccos(0.275) ≈ 74 degrees.

So, angle ADC is approximately 74 degrees.

Therefore, in the quadrilateral, angles are:

- angle A: BAD ≈ 79.3 degrees

- angle B: ABC = 110 degrees (given)

- angle C: BCD = 100 degrees (given)

- angle D: ADC ≈ 74 degrees

Sum is 79.3 + 110 + 100 + 74 ≈ 363.3 degrees. Hmm, that's more than 360. That can't be. Wait, something must be wrong.

Wait, no, in reality, in the figure, angle ADC is the angle at D, but is it the internal angle?

Wait, in quadrilateral ABCD, the internal angles at each vertex are:

- At A: angle DAB = BAD ≈ 79.3 degrees

- At B: angle ABC = 110 degrees

- At C: angle BCD = 100 degrees

- At D: angle CDA ≈ 74 degrees

So, sum is 79.3 + 110 + 100 + 74 ≈ 363.3, which is about 3.3 degrees over 360. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps my angle calculations are slightly off.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates given are not exact, leading to approximate angles.

Alternatively, maybe the Asymptote code is just a representation, and the exact coordinates are not to scale.

Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't rely too much on the coordinates to compute exact angles, but instead use the given labels.

So, in the figure, angles BAD and CDA are trisected, with each trisection marked by x and y. Additionally, angles ABC and BCD are given as 110 and 100 degrees, respectively.

Therefore, in quadrilateral ABCD, angles at A: BAD is trisected, at D: CDA is trisected.

Given that, perhaps we can use the fact that the sum of internal angles in quadrilateral ABCD is 360 degrees.

So, angle BAD + angle ABC + angle BCD + angle CDA = 360.

Given that angle ABC is 110, angle BCD is 100, so angle BAD + angle CDA = 360 - 110 - 100 = 150 degrees.

So, angle BAD + angle CDA = 150 degrees.

Since angle BAD and CDA are each trisected, and if we denote the measure of angle BAD as β, and angle CDA as γ, then  β + γ = 150 degrees.

But since both angles are being trisected, each trisection would be β / 3 and γ / 3.

But without more information, I need another equation.

Wait, perhaps the figure is such that lines AE and DF trisect angles BAD and CDA, respectively. Then, points E and F are connected, forming triangle AFD.

Given that, perhaps using the Law of Sines in triangles ABE and CDF.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that lines AE and DF are trisectors, so they divide angles BAD and CDA into three equal parts.

Wait, if angle BAD is trisected, then the angle between BA and AE is β / 3, and between AE and AF is another β / 3, and between AF and AD is the last β / 3.

Similarly, angle CDA is trisected into three angles of γ / 3 each.

So, in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are each β / 3 and γ / 3, respectively.

Therefore, angle at A in triangle AFD is β / 3, angle at D is γ / 3, and angle at F is angle AFD.

So, sum of angles in triangle AFD:

(β / 3) + (γ / 3) + angle AFD = 180 degrees

So, angle AFD = 180 - (β / 3 + γ / 3) = 180 - ( (β + γ ) / 3 )

But we know that β + γ = 150 degrees, so:

angle AFD = 180 - (150 / 3 ) = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees.

Wait, that seems straightforward.

So, angle AFD is 130 degrees.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, it labels angle AFD as 110 degrees. Hmm, that conflicts with my calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the angles at A and D in triangle AFD are exactly β / 3 and γ / 3.

Wait, perhaps the trisection lines are not necessarily splitting the angle into three equal parts in the triangle. Maybe the lines AE and DF are trisectors, but they might not correspond to the angles at A and D in triangle AFD.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the lines AE and DF as trisectors, so each trisection angle is equal.

Wait, in angle BAD, which is β, it's being trisected, so each angle is β / 3.

Similarly, in angle CDA, which is γ, each trisection is γ / 3.

But in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are not necessarily the full trisection angles, because AF and FD are not necessarily the trisectors.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the Law of Sines in triangle AFD.

Wait, but without knowing the lengths, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps using Ceva's theorem.

Wait, Ceva's theorem states that for concurrent lines from the vertices of a triangle, the product of certain ratios equals 1.

But in this case, we have a quadrilateral, so maybe Ceva isn't directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Sines in triangles ABE and CDF.

Wait, let's consider triangle ABE. Since angle BAD is trisected, angle BAE is β / 3, and angle ABE is given as 110 degrees at point B.

Wait, no, angle ABC is 110 degrees, which is at point B. So, angle ABE is part of angle ABC.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider triangle AFD and the given angles.

Wait, since angle AFD is formed by lines AF and DF, which are trisectors of angles BAD and CDA.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are each one-third of angle BAD and angle CDA, respectively.

Therefore, angle at A: β / 3, angle at D: γ / 3.

Thus, angle AFD = 180 - (β / 3 + γ / 3) = 180 - ( (β + γ ) / 3 ) = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees.

But the Asymptote code labels angle AFD as 110 degrees. So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, another thought: maybe the trisection is external to the triangle, so the angles are not directly contributing as I thought.

Alternatively, perhaps angle AFD is an external angle to triangle AFD, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, let me think again.

Given that, in quadrilateral ABCD, angles at A and D are trisected, and we have triangle AFD.

If angle BAD is trisected into three angles, each being β / 3, and angle CDA is trisected into three angles, each γ / 3.

If I consider triangle AFD, it's formed by connecting points A, F, D. So, lines AF and DF are inside the quadrilateral.

Therefore, angles at A and D in triangle AFD are the angles between BA and AF, and between DF and DA, respectively.

But since AF and DF are trisectors, perhaps those angles are each equal to β / 3 and γ / 3.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, angles at A and D are β / 3 and γ / 3, so angle AFD is 180 - (β / 3 + γ / 3) = 130 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, it labels angle AFD as 110 degrees. So, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the trisection is such that the angles at A and D in triangle AFD are not exactly β / 3 and γ / 3.

Wait, another approach: maybe using the fact that in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are related to the trisection.

Wait, if angle BAD is trisected, then the angle between BA and AE is β / 3, and the angle between AE and AF is another β / 3, and between AF and AD is another β / 3.

Similarly, in angle CDA, which is being trisected, the angle between DC and DF is γ / 3, between DF and DE is γ / 3, and between DE and DA is γ / 3.

Wait, so in triangle AFD, the angle at A is the angle between AF and AD, which is β / 3, and the angle at D is the angle between AF and DF, which is γ / 3.

Wait, no, that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the angles.

Wait, let me think of angle BAD being trisected by AE and AF, so from BA to AE is angle 1, AE to AF is angle 2, AF to AD is angle 3, each equal.

Similarly, angle CDA is trisected by DF and DE, so from DC to DF is angle 1, DF to DE is angle 2, DE to DA is angle 3, each equal.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, the angle at A is angle between AF and AD, which is angle 3 from angle BAD, so it's β / 3.

Similarly, the angle at D in triangle AFD is the angle between AF and DF, which is a combination of angle 3 from angle CDA and angle 2 from angle CDA?

Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, angle at D is between FD and AD.

From point D, the angle CDA is being trisected, so between DC and DF is γ / 3, between DF and DE is another γ / 3, and between DE and DA is another γ / 3.

Therefore, the angle between FD and DA is γ / 3.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, the angle at D is γ / 3.

Similarly, at point A, angle between AF and AD is β / 3.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, angles at A and D are β / 3 and γ / 3, so angle AFD is 180 - (β / 3 + γ / 3).

Since β + γ = 150 degrees, (β / 3 + γ / 3) = 50 degrees.

Therefore, angle AFD is 180 - 50 = 130 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, angle AFD is labeled as 110 degrees, which conflicts with this.

Wait, perhaps the angles at A and D in triangle AFD are not exactly β / 3 and γ / 3.

Wait, maybe the trisection lines are different.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, point E is connected to F, so perhaps point F is the intersection of AE and DF.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, angles at A and D are not the full trisection angles, but perhaps the angles between AF and AE, and between DF and DE.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the Law of Sines in triangles ABE and CDF.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that angle AFD is 110 degrees, given in the Asymptote code.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, two specific angles are labeled: 110 degrees at (2.5,3.5) and 100 degrees at (6.5 - 0.2, 3.5).

Looking at the coordinates, the 110 degrees is near the middle of the figure, perhaps at point E or F.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, label("$110^{\circ}$",(2.5,3.5)) is at the midpoint between (2,4) and (7,4), which is point (4.5,4). But in the code, it's labeled at (2.5,3.5), which is near point A. Hmm, perhaps it's the angle at point E.

Wait, point E is connected to A and F. So, in triangle AEF, there's an angle labeled 110 degrees.

Similarly, label("$100^{\circ}$",(6.5-.2, .5-.3)) is near point D.

Wait, maybe the angles at E and F are 110 and 100 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps angle AFD is 110 degrees, as per the label in the Asymptote code.

But according to my earlier calculation, angle AFD should be 130 degrees, but the Asymptote code labels it with 110 degrees.

So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the angles at A and D are not β / 3 and γ / 3, but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the trisection is such that they create 20 and 10 degrees or something like that.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the problem statement.

In quadrilateral ABCD, angles BAD and CDA are trisected as shown. So, both angles are being trisected, but perhaps in a way that the trisection lines are different.

Wait, if angle BAD is trisected into three angles, each of x degrees, and angle CDA is trisected into three angles, each of y degrees.

Since in the Asymptote code, angle AFD is labeled as 110 degrees, perhaps that is the answer.

But why do I get 130 degrees when I calculate it as 180 - (β + γ)/3.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the lines AE and DF are not the trisectors, but the angle trisectors from A and D.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, point E is connected to A, and point F is connected to D. So, AE and DF are drawn.

If angles BAD and CDA are trisected, then from point A, two lines trisecting angle BAD are drawn, creating angles of β / 3 each. Similarly, from point D, two lines trisecting angle CDA are drawn, creating angles of γ / 3 each.

Therefore, lines AE and AF trisect angle BAD, and lines DF and DE trisect angle CDA.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are each β / 3 and γ / 3, respectively.

Therefore, angle AFD = 180 - (β / 3 + γ / 3) = 180 - (150 / 3) = 180 - 50 = 130.

So, unless I'm missing something, angle AFD should be 130 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as 110 degrees. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the angles at A and D in triangle AFD are not exactly β / 3 and γ / 3 because of the way the trisection lines are drawn.

Wait, if angle BAD is trisected by AE and AF, then angle BAE = angle EAF = angle FAD = β / 3.

Similarly, angle CDA is trisected by DF and DE, so angle DCF = angle CFD = angle FDA = γ / 3.

Wait, now, in triangle AFD, the angle at A is angle FAD, which is β / 3, and the angle at D is angle FDA, which is γ / 3.

Therefore, angle AFD = 180 - (β / 3 + γ / 3) = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as 110 degrees. So, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the trisectors are not equally dividing angles BAD and CDA.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, the labels for the trisection angles are x and y. So, perhaps angle BAD is being trisected into 20, 20, 20 degrees (if β = 60), and angle CDA is being trisected into 20, 20, 20 degrees (if γ = 60). But then β + γ = 120, but earlier we had β + γ = 150, so that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe each trisection is into 25, 25, 25 degrees, if γ = 75, and β = 75, which adds to 150.

Wait, if angle BAD is 75 degrees, being trisected into 25 each, and angle CDA is 75 degrees, being trisected into 25 each.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, angles at A and D are 25 degrees each, so angle AFD is 180 - 25 - 25 = 130 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, angle AFD is labeled as 110 degrees. So, perhaps the trisection is done into different angles.

Wait, perhaps angle BAD is 90 degrees, being trisected into 30, 30, 30 degrees, and angle CDA is 60 degrees, being trisected into 20, 20, 20 degrees.

Therefore, β = 90, γ = 60.

Sum β + γ = 150, which matches.

Then, in triangle AFD, angles at A and D are 30 and 20 degrees, so angle AFD is 180 - 30 - 20 = 130 degrees.

But again, 130 vs 110.

Alternatively, perhaps angle BAD is 120 degrees, trisected into 40, 40, 40, and angle CDA is 30 degrees, trisected into 10, 10, 10. So, β + γ = 150.

Then, in triangle AFD, angles at A and D are 40 and 10, so angle AFD is 180 - 40 - 10 = 130 degrees.

Still, 130.

Alternatively, maybe the trisection is such that the angles at A and D in triangle AFD are not β / 3 and γ / 3, but something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the trisection is such that from point A, two lines trisect angle BAD, but those lines are not necessarily the ones connected to F.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, point E is connected to A and F, so perhaps line AE and AF are the trisectors.

Similarly, point F is connected to D, so line DF is a trisector.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, angle at A is between AF and AD, which is the last trisection angle, so β / 3.

Similarly, angle at D is between DF and DA, which is γ / 3.

So, angle AFD is 180 - (β / 3 + γ / 3) = 130 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as 110 degrees, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the trisection is external to the triangle.

Wait, perhaps the trisectors from A and D intersect at F, so that F is inside the quadrilateral.

Therefore, angle AFD is formed by those trisectors.

Wait, in that case, perhaps angle AFD is the sum of the two trisection angles.

Wait, but that would make angle AFD = β / 3 + γ / 3, which would be 50 degrees, but that's conflicting with earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps angle AFD is formed by the other angles.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle AFD, we have angle AFD, and the two other angles.

But without knowing the sides, perhaps we can't compute.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in quadrilateral ABCD, angles at B and C are 110 and 100 degrees.

So, angle ABC = 110, angle BCD = 100.

Therefore, angle ABC + angle BCD = 210 degrees.

In a quadrilateral, the sum of all internal angles is 360, so angles at A and D must sum to 150 degrees.

Therefore, angle BAD + angle CDA = 150 degrees.

So, if angle BAD is trisected into three angles, each of (BAD)/3, and angle CDA is trisected into three angles, each of (CDA)/3.

So, in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are (BAD)/3 and (CDA)/3.

Therefore, angle AFD = 180 - ( (BAD)/3 + (CDA)/3 ) = 180 - ( (BAD + CDA ) / 3 ) = 180 - (150 / 3 ) = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees.

Therefore, angle AFD must be 130 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as 110 degrees. So, perhaps the Asymptote code is incorrect, or I'm misinterpreting the trisection.

Wait, maybe the trisection is such that angle BAD is trisected into angles that are not equal.

Wait, the problem says angles BAD and CDA are trisected as shown. So, perhaps in the figure, the trisection lines are not equal, but the figure is just a representation.

Alternatively, perhaps the trisection is done in such a way that the angles are 30 and 20, but that might not lead to 110 degrees.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating.

Given that, in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are (BAD)/3 and (CDA)/3, so angle AFD is 180 - ( (BAD)/3 + (CDA)/3 ) = 180 - (150 / 3 ) = 130 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of angle AFD is 130 degrees.

But as per the Asymptote code, it's labeled as 110 degrees. So, perhaps the problem is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the trisection.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, label("$x$", (1, 1.5)), which is near point A, and label("$x$", (2, 1)), which is near point E.

Similarly, label("$x$", (2, -1), near point D.

So, perhaps the trisection is such that angles near A and D are x, and near E is another x.

But the labels for y are near (5.5, .5 - .3), which is near point C, and near (6.5 + .3, 0)), which is near point D.

Therefore, the trisection near A and D is x, and near C and D is y.

Hmm, so maybe point E is near the middle of AB, and point F is near the middle of CD.

Therefore, perhaps lines AE and DF are trisectors, but not equally dividing the angles.

Wait, maybe the angles at A and D are trisected into two angles of x and one of y, or something.

But without more information, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps using the given angles at B and C, which are 110 and 100 degrees.

So, in quadrilateral ABCD, angles at A and D are 150 degrees.

If angle BAD and angle CDA are being trisected, then perhaps in triangle AFD, angle AFD is the sum of some of these trisection angles.

Wait, perhaps the angle AFD is equal to angle ABC + angle BCD.

Wait, 110 + 100 = 210, which is more than 180, so that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe angle AFD is equal to angle ABC - angle BCD, but 110 - 100 = 10, which seems too small.

Alternatively, maybe angle AFD is equal to 180 - (angle ABC - angle BCD) = 180 - 10 = 170, which is also too big.

Alternatively, maybe angle AFD is equal to angle ABC + angle BCD - 180, but 110 + 100 - 180 = 30, which is too small.

Wait, another thought: since angles at B and C are given, perhaps angle AFD relates to those.

In the Asymptote code, point F is near the middle of the figure, so perhaps angle AFD is formed by lines AF and DF, which might form an angle that's related to angles at B and C.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are each one-third of angle BAD and angle CDA, which sum to 150, so each is 50, but that can't be, because 50 + 50 = 100, so angle AFD would be 80, but that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Given that angle AFD is formed by the trisection of angles at A and D, which sum to 150, each trisection is 50, so angle AFD is 180 - (50 + 50) = 80 degrees.

But that contradicts earlier.

Wait, hold on, if angle BAD is trisected into three equal angles, each being β / 3, and angle CDA is trisected into three equal angles, each being γ / 3.

Then, in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are β / 3 and γ / 3, so angle AFD is 180 - (β + γ ) / 3 = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees.

Therefore, regardless of the trisection, as long as the trisection is equal, angle AFD is 130 degrees.

Therefore, despite the Asymptote code labeling it as 110 degrees, I think the correct answer is 130 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, angle AFD is labeled as 110 degrees. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the coordinates again.

Point A is at (0,0), point D is at (7,-2), so the vector DA is (7,-2).

Point B is at (2,4), point C is at (7,4), so vector BC is (5,0).

So, angle ABC is at point B between points A(2,4), B(2,4), and C(7,4). So, that angle is 110 degrees, as per the Asymptote code.

Similarly, angle BCD is at point C between points B(7,4), C(7,4), and D(7,-2). So, that angle is 100 degrees.

Therefore, in quadrilateral ABCD, angles at B and C are 110 and 100 degrees.

Therefore, angles at A and D must be 150 degrees.

So, angle BAD + angle CDA = 150.

If the trisection is equal, each trisection angle is 50 degrees.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are 50 degrees each, so angle AFD is 80 degrees.

Wait, that contradicts all previous.

Wait, confusion arises because I'm not correctly identifying how the trisection affects triangle AFD.

Wait, let's think of it differently.

In triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are formed by the trisectors of angle BAD and angle CDA.

So, angle at A is the angle between AF and AD, which is the last trisection angle from angle BAD, so that's 50 degrees.

Similarly, angle at D is the angle between DF and DA, which is the last trisection angle from angle CDA, so that's 50 degrees.

Therefore, angle AFD is 180 - 50 - 50 = 80 degrees.

But then, angle AFD is 80 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as 110 degrees.

Wait, this is really confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the trisection is such that the angles at A and D in triangle AFD are not the last trisection angles, but the first ones.

Wait, if from point A, the trisectors divide angle BAD into three equal parts, each of 50 degrees, then the angle between BA and AE is 50 degrees, between AE and AF is 50 degrees, and between AF and AD is 50 degrees.

Similarly, from point D, the trisectors divide angle CDA into three equal parts, each of 50 degrees.

Therefore, the angle between DC and DF is 50 degrees, between DF and DE is 50 degrees, and between DE and DA is 50 degrees.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, angle at A is between AF and AD, which is 50 degrees, and angle at D is between DF and DA, which is 50 degrees.

Therefore, angle AFD is 80 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, angle AFD is labeled as 110 degrees, so perhaps this is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the trisection is not equal.

Wait, if angle BAD is trisected into angles of 30, 30, 30, and angle CDA is trisected into 20, 20, 20, then sum to 150.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, angles at A and D are 30 and 20, so angle AFD is 130 degrees.

Alternatively, if angle BAD is 90, trisected into 30, 30, 30, and angle CDA is 60, trisected into 20, 20, 20, so angle AFD is 130.

Therefore, regardless of how I trisect, it's 130.

Therefore, angle AFD is 130 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as 110, which is 20 degrees less.

Wait, perhaps in the Asymptote code, the trisection is such that the two trisectors from A and D meet at F, forming a triangle where angle AFD is 110 degrees.

But unless I can calculate based on the given figure.

But since I can't see the figure, only the Asymptote code, which is just a rough sketch, perhaps the answer is 130 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe using the given angles of 110 and 100, and the trisection.

Wait, perhaps angle AFD is equal to 180 - (angle ABC - angle BCD) = 180 - (110 - 100) = 170, which is not matching.

Alternatively, angle AFD is equal to angle ABC + angle BCD - 180 = 110 + 100 - 180 = 30, which is too small.

Alternatively, angle AFD is equal to (angle ABC + angle BCD)/2 = 110, which is 55, but 110 is given.

Alternatively, perhaps angle AFD is equal to angle ABC / 2 + angle BCD / 2 = 55 + 50 = 105, which is not 110.

Alternatively, angle AFD is equal to angle ABC + angle BCD / 2 = 110 + 50 = 160, which is too big.

Alternatively, angle AFD is equal to angle ABC - angle BCD / 2 = 110 - 50 = 60, which is too small.

Alternatively, angle AFD is equal to angle ABC + angle BCD - 180 = 30, which is too small.

Wait, maybe angle AFD is equal to 180 - angle ABC = 70, which is too small.

Wait, I'm really stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are x and y, which are the trisection angles from BAD and CDA.

Given that angle BAD is trisected into x, x, x, and angle CDA is trisected into y, y, y.

Then, 3x + 3y = 150 => x + y = 50.

So, in triangle AFD, angles at A and D are x and y, so angle AFD is 180 - (x + y) = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees.

Therefore, regardless of the specific values of x and y, as long as trisection is equal, angle AFD is 130 degrees.

Thus, I think the measure of angle AFD is 130 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The degree measure of angle $AFD$ is $\boxed{130}$.
</think>

In quadrilateral \(ABCD\), angles \(BAD\) and \(CDA\) are trisected. We need to find the degree measure of angle \(AFD\).

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Angles \(BAD\) and \(CDA\) are trisected, meaning they are divided into three equal parts.
   - The figure shows these trisected angles with labels \(x\) and \(y\).
   - Given angles at points \(B\) and \(C\) are 110 degrees and 100 degrees respectively.

2. **Sum of Internal Angles in Quadrilateral:**
   - The sum of internal angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.
   - Given angles at \(B\) and \(C\) are 110 degrees and 100 degrees, the sum of angles at \(A\) and \(D\) is \(360 - (110 + 100) = 150\) degrees.

3. **Trisection of Angles \(BAD\) and \(CDA\):**
   - Let \( \angle BAD = \beta \) and \( \angle CDA = \gamma \).
   - Since \( \beta + \gamma = 150 \) degrees, each trisection part is \( \beta/3 \) and \( \gamma/3 \).

4. **Triangle \(AFD\):**
   - In triangle \(AFD\), the angles at \(A\) and \(D\) are each one-third of \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \) respectively.
   - Therefore, the angles at \(A\) and \(D\) in triangle \(AFD\) are \( \beta/3 \) and \( \gamma/3 \).

5. **Calculating Angle \(AFD\):**
   - The sum of the angles at \(A\) and \(D\) in triangle \(AFD\) is \( \beta/3 + \gamma/3 = (\beta + \gamma)/3 = 150/3 = 50 \) degrees.
   - Hence, angle \(AFD = 180 - 50 = 130\) degrees.

Thus, the degree measure of angle \(AFD\) is \(\boxed{130}\).
