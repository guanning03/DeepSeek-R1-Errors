Question:
Given that \begin{align*}x_{1}&=211,\\ x_{2}&=375,\\ x_{3}&=420,\\ x_{4}&=523,\ \text{and}\\ x_{n}&=x_{n-1}-x_{n-2}+x_{n-3}-x_{n-4}\ \text{when}\ n\geq5, \end{align*}find the value of $x_{531}+x_{753}+x_{975}$.

Correct Answer:
Shifting the recurrence over by one and adding, we have: \[\begin{aligned} x_n &= x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \\ x_{n-1} &= x_{n-2} - x_{n-3} + x_{n-4} - x_{n-5} \\ \implies x_n + x_{n-1} &= x_{n-1} - x_{n-5} \end{aligned}\]so $x_n = -x_{n-5}$ for all $n.$ In particular, $x_n = -x_{n-5} = -(-x_{n-10}) = x_{n-10},$ so the sequence repeats with period $10.$ Thus, \[\begin{aligned} x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} &= x_1 + x_3 + x_5 \\ &= x_1 + x_3 + (x_4-x_3+x_2-x_1) \\ &= x_2 + x_4 \\ &= 375 + 523 = \boxed{898}. \end{aligned}\]

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem here where I'm given the first four terms of a sequence: x₁ = 211, x₂ = 375, x₃ = 420, and x₄ = 523. Then, for n ≥ 5, each term is defined recursively by the formula xₙ = xₙ₋₁ - xₙ₋₂ + xₙ₋₃ - xₙ₋₄. The question asks me to find the value of x₅₃₁ + x₇₅₃ + x₉₇₅.

Hmm, okay, so the first thing I notice is that this is a linear recurrence relation. It seems like each term is a combination of the previous four terms with coefficients 1, -1, 1, -1. That might be a pattern I can exploit.

Since it's a linear recurrence, maybe the sequence will eventually repeat or become periodic. If I can find the period, then I can figure out where 531, 753, and 975 fall within that period and sum the corresponding terms.

So, let's try computing the next few terms to see if a pattern emerges.

Given:
x₁ = 211
x₂ = 375
x₃ = 420
x₄ = 523

Now, let's compute x₅:
x₅ = x₄ - x₃ + x₂ - x₁
x₅ = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211
Let me compute each step:
523 - 420 = 103
103 + 375 = 478
478 - 211 = 267
So, x₅ = 267

Next, x₆:
x₆ = x₅ - x₄ + x₃ - x₂
x₆ = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375
Calculating step by step:
267 - 523 = -256
-256 + 420 = 164
164 - 375 = -211
So, x₆ = -211

Wait a second, that's interesting. x₆ is -211, which is the negative of x₁. Let me note that.

Moving on to x₇:
x₇ = x₆ - x₅ + x₄ - x₃
x₇ = (-211) - 267 + 523 - 420
Calculating step by step:
-211 - 267 = -478
-478 + 523 = 45
45 - 420 = -375
So, x₇ = -375

Hmm, x₇ is -375, which is the negative of x₂. Hmm, so maybe the pattern is that each term is the negative of the term four places before?

Let me test that with x₈.

x₈ = x₇ - x₆ + x₅ - x₄
x₈ = (-375) - (-211) + 267 - 523
Calculating:
-375 + 211 = -164
-164 + 267 = 103
103 - 523 = -420
So, x₈ = -420

Which is the negative of x₃. So, x₈ = -x₃. Hmm, so it seems like every four terms, the sign flips.

So, for x₅, x₆, x₇, x₈, the terms are 267, -211, -375, -420. Then, x₉ would be?

x₉ = x₈ - x₇ + x₆ - x₅
x₉ = (-420) - (-375) + (-211) - 267
Calculating:
-420 + 375 = -45
-45 - 211 = -256
-256 - 267 = -523
So, x₉ = -523

Which is the negative of x₄. So, x₉ = -x₄.

So, continuing this pattern, x₁₀ would be?

x₁₀ = x₉ - x₈ + x₇ - x₆
x₁₀ = (-523) - (-420) + (-375) - (-211)
Calculating:
-523 + 420 = -103
-103 - 375 = -478
-478 + 211 = -267
So, x₁₀ = -267

Which is the negative of x₅. So, the pattern is:

x₅ = 267
x₆ = -211
x₇ = -375
x₈ = -420
x₉ = -523
x₁₀ = -267

Wait, hold on. x₁₀ is -267, which is the negative of x₅. So x₁₀ = -x₅.

Hmm, so perhaps every four terms, the sign alternates. Let me see.

If I keep going:

x₁₁ = x₁₀ - x₉ + x₈ - x₇
x₁₁ = (-267) - (-523) + (-420) - (-375)
Calculating:
-267 + 523 = 256
256 - 420 = -164
-164 + 375 = 211
So, x₁₁ = 211

Which is the same as x₁. Interesting.

x₁₂ = x₁₁ - x₁₀ + x₉ - x₈
x₁₂ = 211 - (-267) + (-523) - (-420)
Calculating:
211 + 267 = 478
478 - 523 = -45
-45 + 420 = 375
So, x₁₂ = 375, which is x₂.

x₁₃ = x₁₂ - x₁₁ + x₁₀ - x₉
x₁₃ = 375 - 211 + (-267) - (-523)
Calculating:
375 - 211 = 164
164 - 267 = -103
-103 + 523 = 420
So, x₁₃ = 420, which is x₃.

x₁₄ = x₁₃ - x₁₂ + x₁₁ - x₁₀
x₁₄ = 420 - 375 + 211 - (-267)
Calculating:
420 - 375 = 45
45 + 211 = 256
256 + 267 = 523
So, x₁₄ = 523, which is x₄.

Wait, so x₁₅ would be x₁₄ - x₁₃ + x₁₂ - x₁₁
x₁₅ = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211
Which is exactly how we computed x₅. So, x₁₅ = 267, which is x₅.

So, putting it all together, it seems like starting from x₁, every 12 terms, the sequence repeats.

Wait, let me see:

x₁ = 211
x₂ = 375
x₃ = 420
x₄ = 523
x₅ = 267
x₆ = -211
x₇ = -375
x₈ = -420
x₉ = -523
x₁₀ = -267
x₁₁ = 211
x₁₂ = 375
x₁₃ = 420
x₁₄ = 523
x₁₅ = 267
x₁₆ = -211
... etc.

So, from x₁ to x₁₀, the terms go:

211, 375, 420, 523, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267

Then x₁₁ to x₁₂: 211, 375, which is the same as x₁, x₂.

So, the sequence is periodic with period 12. Let me check x₁₃, x₁₄, x₁₅:

x₁₃ = 420 = x₃
x₁₄ = 523 = x₄
x₁₅ = 267 = x₅

Yes, so the cycle is repeating every 12 terms.

So, the period is 12. That is, the sequence repeats every 12 terms.

So, to find xₙ, we can find n modulo 12, and then take the corresponding term.

So, for example, x₁ = 211, which is term 1 in the cycle.

x₁₁ = x₁, so 11 mod 12 = 11, but x₁₁ is equal to x₁, which is term 1, so that might indicate that the cycle is 12 terms, but the indexing is shifted.

Wait, actually, x₁ is term 1, x₁₁ is term 11, which is equal to x₁, so that suggests that the cycle is longer or perhaps the cycle includes the negative terms.

Wait, hold on, I think I see the confusion. The cycle is 12 terms, but when you index them, starting from 1, the cycle shifts.

Wait, let me think differently. Let me list out the terms with their indices and see if I can find a cycle.

n: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24...
xₙ:211,375,420,523,267,-211,-375,-420,-523,-267,211,375,420,523,267,-211,-375,-420,-523,-267,211,375,420,523...

So, if I list them out, starting from n=1:

1:211
2:375
3:420
4:523
5:267
6:-211
7:-375
8:-420
9:-523
10:-267
11:211
12:375
13:420
14:523
15:267
16:-211
17:-375
18:-420
19:-523
20:-267
21:211
22:375
23:420
24:523
... etc.

So, from n=1 to n=10: 211, 375, 420, 523, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267.

From n=11 to n=20: 211, 375, 420, 523, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267.

From n=21 to n=30: same as above.

So, it's a cycle of 12, but starting at n=1, the cycle is 12 terms, but when you look at the terms, from n=1 to n=12, it's 211, 375, 420, 523, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, 375.

Wait, so term 13 is 420, which is term 3, and term 25 is 420, so term 13 is equal to term 1, but shifted.

But in reality, term 13 is just term 1, so it's like the cycle repeats every 12 terms. So, the period is 12.

Therefore, to find xₙ, we can compute n modulo 12, and then use that to index into the cycle.

But here's the thing: n=1 corresponds to the first term, n=13 corresponds to the 13th term, which is equal to the first term, so 13 mod 12 is 1, so x₁₃ = x₁.

Similarly, n=24 is 24 mod 12 = 0, but since our terms start at n=1, perhaps it's better to think of it as n modulo 12, with 12 corresponding to the 12th term.

Wait, maybe I should adjust it so that the remainder is 1-12 instead of 0-11.

So, for any n, compute (n - 1) mod 12, which gives a remainder from 0 to 11, then map it to 1-12.

So, xₙ = cycle[(n - 1) mod 12 + 1], where cycle is [211, 375, 420, 523, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, 375].

Wait, let me check:

For n=1: (1-1) mod 12 = 0 mod 12 = 0, 0 +1=1, so cycle[1] = 211. Correct.

n=6: (6-1) mod 12=5, 5+1=6, cycle[6]=-211. Correct.

n=12: (12-1)=11 mod12=11, 11+1=12, cycle[12]=375. Correct.

Wait, but cycle is [211, 375, 420, 523, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, 375].

So, cycle[1]=211, cycle[2]=375, cycle[3]=420, cycle[4]=523, cycle[5]=267, cycle[6]=-211, cycle[7]=-375, cycle[8]=-420, cycle[9]=-523, cycle[10]=-267, cycle[11]=211, cycle[12]=375.

So, yes, if we index the cycle as 1-12, then for any n, xₙ = cycle[(n - 1) mod 12 + 1].

So, for example, n=13: (13-1) mod12=12 mod12=0, 0+1=1, cycle[1]=211. Correct, x₁₃=211.

Similarly, n=25: (25-1)=24 mod12=0, 0+1=1, cycle[1]=211. x₂₅=211.

Similarly, n=100: (100-1)=99 mod12=3, 3+1=4, cycle[4]=523. So x₁₀₀=523.

Okay, so this suggests that the sequence is periodic with period 12, and each term can be found by looking up the corresponding term in the cycle.

So, if we can find where 531, 753, and 975 fall in the cycle, we can find x₅₃₁, x₇₅₃, and x₉₇₅, then sum them.

So, first, let's compute 531 modulo 12.

Wait, actually, let's compute (n - 1) mod 12, then add 1 to get the index.

Alternatively, compute n mod 12, but since n starts at 1, if n mod12=0, then it corresponds to cycle[12].

Wait, let's clarify.

If n mod12=1, corresponds to cycle[1].

n mod12=2, cycle[2].

...

n mod12=0, corresponds to cycle[12].

So, for n=1: 1 mod12=1, cycle[1]=211.

n=12:12 mod12=0, cycle[12]=375.

n=13:13 mod12=1, cycle[1]=211.

So, yes, to get the cycle index, if n mod12=0, it's cycle[12], else cycle[n mod12].

So, let's compute each term:

First, x₅₃₁:

Compute 531 mod12.

Divide 531 by12:

12*44=528, 531-528=3.

So, 531 mod12=3.

Therefore, x₅₃₁ = cycle[3] = 420.

Wait, cycle[3] is 420. Let me check cycle[3] is 420, yes.

Wait, hold on, cycle[3] is 420? Wait, the cycle is [211,375,420,523,267,-211,-375,-420,-523,-267,211,375]. So, cycle[1]=211, cycle[2]=375, cycle[3]=420, cycle[4]=523, etc.

Yes, so cycle[3]=420, so x₅₃₁=420.

Next, x₇₅₃:

Compute 753 mod12.

12*62=744, 753-744=9.

So, 753 mod12=9.

Therefore, x₇₅₃ = cycle[9] = -523.

Yes, cycle[9]=-523.

Third term, x₉₇₅:

Compute 975 mod12.

12*81=972, 975-972=3.

So, 975 mod12=3.

Therefore, x₉₇₅ = cycle[3] = 420.

Wait, so x₅₃₁=420, x₇₅₃=-523, x₉₇₅=420.

So, adding them together: 420 + (-523) + 420.

Compute 420 + 420 = 840.

Then, 840 - 523 = 317.

So, the sum is 317.

Wait, is that correct?

Let me double-check the calculations.

First, 531 divided by12: 12*44=528, 531-528=3. So, 3. So, cycle[3]=420. Correct.

753 divided by12: 12*62=744, 753-744=9. So, 9. So, cycle[9]=-523. Correct.

975 divided by12: 12*81=972, 975-972=3. So, 3. So, cycle[3]=420. Correct.

Therefore, 420 + (-523) + 420.

420 + 420 = 840.

840 - 523 = 317.

Yes, 317 is the result.

Wait, but just to make sure, let's verify.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute xₙ for n=531, 753, 975 using the cycle.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the cycle? Let me check the cycle again.

From n=1 to n=12:

x₁=211, x₂=375, x₃=420, x₄=523, x₅=267, x₆=-211, x₇=-375, x₈=-420, x₉=-523, x₁₀=-267, x₁₁=211, x₁₂=375.

So, cycle is [211,375,420,523,267,-211,-375,-420,-523,-267,211,375].

So, cycle[1]=211, cycle[2]=375, cycle[3]=420, cycle[4]=523, cycle[5]=267, cycle[6]=-211, cycle[7]=-375, cycle[8]=-420, cycle[9]=-523, cycle[10]=-267, cycle[11]=211, cycle[12]=375.

Yes, that's correct.

So, 531 mod12=3, so x₅₃₁=cycle[3]=420.

753 mod12=9, so x₇₅₃=cycle[9]=-523.

975 mod12=3, so x₉₇₅=cycle[3]=420.

Thus, their sum is 420 - 523 + 420 = (420 + 420) - 523 = 840 - 523.

Compute 840 - 523: 840 - 500=340, 340 -23=317. So, 317.

Therefore, the value is 317.

But just to be thorough, let's verify this periodicity.

Earlier, I saw that x₁₁=211, x₁₂=375, x₁₃=420, x₁₄=523, etc., which are same as x₁ to x₄.

So, it's clear that the cycle is 12 terms.

Thus, for any n, xₙ can be found by n mod12, with the understanding that if n mod12=0, it's the 12th term, otherwise it's the remainder. So, the formula holds.

Therefore, my conclusion is 317.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{317}
</think>

Given the sequence defined by the initial terms \(x_1 = 211\), \(x_2 = 375\), \(x_3 = 420\), \(x_4 = 523\), and the recurrence relation for \(n \geq 5\):

\[ x_n = x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \]

we need to find the value of \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\).

First, we compute the next few terms to identify any periodicity:

\[
\begin{align*}
x_5 &= x_4 - x_3 + x_2 - x_1 = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211 = 267, \\
x_6 &= x_5 - x_4 + x_3 - x_2 = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375 = -211, \\
x_7 &= x_6 - x_5 + x_4 - x_3 = -211 - 267 + 523 - 420 = -375, \\
x_8 &= x_7 - x_6 + x_5 - x_4 = -375 + 211 + 267 - 523 = -420, \\
x_9 &= x_8 - x_7 + x_6 - x_5 = -420 + 375 - 211 + 267 = -523, \\
x_{10} &= x_9 - x_8 + x_7 - x_6 = -523 + 420 - 375 + 211 = -267, \\
x_{11} &= x_{10} - x_9 + x_8 - x_7 = -267 + 523 - 420 + 375 = 211, \\
x_{12} &= x_{11} - x_{10} + x_9 - x_8 = 211 + 267 - 523 + 420 = 375.
\end{align*}
\]

We observe that the sequence is periodic with a period of 12 terms. The sequence from \(x_1\) to \(x_{12}\) is:

\[ 211, 375, 420, 523, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, 375 \]

To find \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\), we compute the indices modulo 12:

\[
\begin{align*}
531 \mod 12 &= 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x_{531} = x_3 = 420, \\
753 \mod 12 &= 9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x_{753} = x_9 = -523, \\
975 \mod 12 &= 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x_{975} = x_3 = 420.
\end{align*}
\]

Summing these values:

\[
x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = 420 + (-523) + 420 = 317.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{317}
\]
