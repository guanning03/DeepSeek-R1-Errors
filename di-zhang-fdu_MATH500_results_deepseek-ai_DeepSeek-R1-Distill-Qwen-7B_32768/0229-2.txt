Question:
The solutions of the equation $z^4+4z^3i-6z^2-4zi-i=0$ are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane.  The area of this polygon can be expressed in the form $p^{a/b},$ where $a,$ $b,$ $p$ are positive integers, $p$ is prime, and $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime.  Find $a + b + p.$

Correct Answer:
By the Binomial Theorem,
\begin{align*}
(z + i)^4 &= z^4 + 4z^3 i + 6z^2 i^2 + 4zi^3 + 1 \\
&= z^4 + 4iz^3 - 6z^2 - 4iz + 1.
\end{align*}So, if $z^4 + 4z^3 i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0,$ then
\[(z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4iz^3 - 6z^2 - 4iz + 1 = 1 + i.\]Let $w = z + i,$ so $w^4 = 1 + i.$  (If we plot the solutions $w$ in the complex plane, we obtain the same area as from the solutions $z$ in the complex plane, because the substitution $w = z + i$ simply translates the polygon.)

If $w^4 = 1 + i,$ then
\[(wi)^4 = w^4 i^4 = w^4 = 1 + i.\]Thus, if $w$ is a solution, then so are $iw,$ $i^2 w = -w,$ and $i^3 w = -iw,$ which form a square in the complex plane.

From the equation $w^4 = 1 + i,$ $|w^4| = |1 + i|.$  Then $|w|^4 = \sqrt{2},$ so $|w| = 2^{1/8}.$  Therefore, the side length of the square is
\[|w - iw| = |w||1 - i| = 2^{1/8} \sqrt{2} = 2^{5/8},\]so the area of the square is $(2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{5/4}.$  The final answer is $5 + 4 + 2 = \boxed{11}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this equation: \( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \). The solutions to this equation are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of this polygon. The area can be expressed in the form \( p^{a/b} \) where \( p \) is prime, and \( a \) and \( b \) are relatively prime. Then, I have to find \( a + b + p \).

First, I need to figure out what the solutions to the equation are. Since it's a quartic equation, there should be four solutions, which will be four points in the complex plane forming a convex polygon. The question says it's a convex polygon, so I guess it's a quadrilateral or something similar.

Looking at the equation: \( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \). It looks a bit complex, but maybe I can factor it somehow. Factoring polynomials can sometimes be tricky, but perhaps there's a substitution or a pattern here.

Let me write down the equation again:

\( z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i = 0 \).

Hmm, maybe grouping terms can help. Let me see if I can group terms in such a way that I can factor them.

Looking at the first two terms: \( z^4 + 4i z^3 \). I can factor out \( z^3 \): \( z^3(z + 4i) \).

Then, the next two terms: \( -6 z^2 -4i z \). I can factor out \( -2z \): \( -2z(3z + 2i) \).

The last term is \( -i \).

So, putting it together:

\( z^3(z + 4i) - 2z(3z + 2i) - i = 0 \).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe another approach. Let me see if this equation resembles something known, like a binomial expansion or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps substituting \( w = z + i \) might simplify the equation. Let me try that substitution.

Let \( w = z + i \), so \( z = w - i \). Then, I can substitute \( z = w - i \) into the equation and see if it simplifies.

So, let me compute each term:

First, \( z^4 \):

\( (w - i)^4 \). I can expand this using the binomial theorem:

\( (w - i)^4 = w^4 - 4w^3i + 6w^2i^2 - 4w i^3 + i^4 \).

Simplify each term:

\( w^4 - 4i w^3 -6 w^2 +4i w +1 \).

Because \( i^2 = -1 \), \( i^3 = -i \), \( i^4 =1 \).

Next, \( 4i z^3 \):

First, \( z^3 = (w - i)^3 \). Let's compute that:

\( (w - i)^3 = w^3 - 3w^2 i + 3w i^2 - i^3 \).

Simplify:

\( w^3 - 3i w^2 -3 w + i \).

Multiply by \( 4i \):

\( 4i (w^3 - 3i w^2 -3 w + i ) = 4i w^3 -12i^2 w^2 -12i w +4i^2 \).

Simplify:

\( 4i w^3 +12 w^2 -12i w -4 \).

Because \( i^2 = -1 \).

Next term: \( -6 z^2 \).

Compute \( z^2 = (w - i)^2 = w^2 - 2i w + i^2 = w^2 -2i w -1 \).

Multiply by -6:

\( -6w^2 +12i w +6 \).

Next term: \( -4i z \).

Compute \( z = w - i \), so:

\( -4i(w - i) = -4i w +4i^2 = -4i w -4 \).

Last term: \( -i \).

Now, let's add up all these terms together:

Start with \( z^4 \):

\( w^4 -4i w^3 -6 w^2 +4i w +1 \).

Add \( 4i z^3 \):

\( +4i w^3 +12 w^2 -12i w -4 \).

Add \( -6 z^2 \):

\( -6w^2 +12i w +6 \).

Add \( -4i z \):

\( -4i w -4 \).

Add \( -i \).

So, let me write them all out:

1. \( w^4 \)
2. \( -4i w^3 +4i w^3 = 0 \) (they cancel)
3. \( -6w^2 +12w^2 -6w^2 = 0 \) (they also cancel)
4. \(4i w -12i w +12i w -4i w = 0 \) (cancels too)
5. Constants: \(1 -4 +6 -4 -i = (1 -4 +6 -4) -i = (-1) -i\).

So, after adding all the terms, I end up with:

\( w^4 - i = 0 \).

Wow, that's much simpler! So, \( w^4 = i \).

Therefore, the solutions for \( w \) are the fourth roots of \( i \).

So, \( w = \sqrt[4]{i} \).

But I need to find all fourth roots of \( i \). Let me recall that \( i \) can be expressed in polar form as \( e^{i\pi/2 + 2\pi i k} \) for integer \( k \).

So, the fourth roots would be \( e^{i(\pi/8 + \pi k/2)} \) for \( k = 0,1,2,3 \).

So, the four roots are:

1. \( e^{i\pi/8} \)
2. \( e^{i5\pi/8} \)
3. \( e^{i9\pi/8} \)
4. \( e^{i13\pi/8} \)

So, \( w = e^{i\pi/8 + i\pi k/2} \) for \( k=0,1,2,3 \).

But since \( w = z + i \), then \( z = w - i \).

So, each solution \( z \) is \( e^{i\theta} -i \), where \( \theta = \pi/8 + \pi k/2 \).

Wait, but let me write it more clearly.

Each \( w \) is \( e^{i(\pi/8 + \pi k/2)} \), so \( z = e^{i(\pi/8 + \pi k/2)} - i \).

So, let's write down all four solutions:

For \( k = 0 \):

\( z_1 = e^{i\pi/8} -i \).

For \( k = 1 \):

\( z_2 = e^{i5\pi/8} -i \).

For \( k = 2 \):

\( z_3 = e^{i9\pi/8} -i \).

For \( k = 3 \):

\( z_4 = e^{i13\pi/8} -i \).

So, these four points \( z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4 \) are the solutions to the equation.

Now, I need to figure out what shape these four points form in the complex plane. Since they are the roots of a quartic equation, they can form various convex quadrilaterals. But perhaps it's a square or something regular?

But let me think. Each \( z_j \) is \( e^{i\theta_j} - i \), where \( \theta_j \) are angles spaced at \( \pi/2 \) apart starting from \( \pi/8 \).

Wait, \( \pi/8, 5\pi/8, 9\pi/8, 13\pi/8 \). So, these angles are separated by \( \pi/2 \) radians each. So, the four points \( w_j = e^{i\theta_j} \) are the vertices of a square on the unit circle, rotated by \( \pi/8 \) from the standard axes.

So, in the \( w \)-plane (i.e., the complex plane shifted by \( -i \)), the solutions \( w_j \) form a square with side length \( \sqrt{2} \), but rotated by 22.5 degrees (which is \( \pi/8 \) radians).

But then, in the \( z \)-plane, we have \( z = w - i \). So, this is a translation of the \( w \)-plane by \( -i \), which is equivalent to shifting all points downward by 1 unit in the imaginary direction.

So, the polygon in the \( z \)-plane is the same as the polygon in the \( w \)-plane, just shifted down by \( i \). Translating a figure doesn't change its area, so the area in the \( z \)-plane is the same as the area in the \( w \)-plane.

Therefore, the area is the same as the area of the square in the \( w \)-plane, which is 2.

Wait, hold on. If the four points \( w_j \) form a square of side length \( \sqrt{2} \), then the area would be \( (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \). Alternatively, if the square is inscribed in the unit circle, the distance from the center to a vertex is 1, so the side length is \( \sqrt{2} \), as the diagonal is 2.

But wait, let's verify that. If the square is inscribed in the unit circle, each vertex is at distance 1 from the center. The side length \( s \) of such a square is \( s = \sqrt{2} \times \text{radius} \times \sin(\pi/4) \). Wait, no, maybe better to compute the distance between two adjacent points.

If the square is inscribed in the unit circle, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is \( 2\pi /4 = \pi/2 \). The chord length between two points on a circle of radius \( r \) with central angle \( \theta \) is \( 2r \sin(\theta/2) \). So, chord length here is \( 2 \times 1 \times \sin(\pi/4) = 2 \times \sqrt{2}/2 = \sqrt{2} \). So, the side length is \( \sqrt{2} \), hence the area is \( (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \).

So, the area in the \( w \)-plane is 2, hence in the \( z \)-plane it's also 2. But wait, hold on, is the polygon really a square?

Wait, the four points \( w_j \) are equally spaced on the unit circle, each at angles \( \pi/8, 5\pi/8, 9\pi/8, 13\pi/8 \). So, they form a square rotated by \( \pi/8 \). The area is 2 as we computed.

But then, we have \( z_j = w_j - i \). So, in the \( z \)-plane, we're shifting each point downward by 1 unit. So, in the complex plane, it's moving each vertex of the square down by 1.

But does that affect the shape? No, it's just a translation, so the shape remains a square, just moved down. So, the area is still 2. So, the area in the \( z \)-plane is 2, which can be written as \( 2^{1} \). So, \( p = 2 \), \( a = 1 \), \( b =1 \). So, \( a + b + p = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \).

Wait, but the question says the area can be expressed in the form \( p^{a/b} \). Since 2 is already an integer, and can be expressed as \( 2^{1} \), so \( a =1 \), \( b=1 \), \( p=2 \). So, the answer is 4.

But hold on, let me double-check my reasoning because sometimes shifting can affect things. But in reality, in complex plane, translation doesn't affect distances or areas, only positions. So, the area remains 2.

Alternatively, maybe the polygon is not a square but something else? Let me think. Is it possible that when we translate the square down by 1 unit, the polygon becomes something else?

Wait, no. The polygon is determined by the vertices, but since translation is a rigid motion, it doesn't change the shape or size. So, the area remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the original polygon in the \( w \)-plane is a square, but after shifting, the polygon is still a square, just moved. So, area is same.

Wait, another thought: is the polygon actually a square? Because the four points \( w_j \) are equally spaced on the unit circle, so they form a square. Then, shifting it down by 1 unit, the square is just moved, but remains a square, with the same side lengths and area.

So, I think the area is indeed 2. So, \( p = 2 \), \( a =1 \), \( b=1 \), so the answer is 4.

But wait a second. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me consider the positions of the points \( w_j \) in the complex plane.

Each \( w_j \) is \( e^{i\theta_j} \), where \( \theta_j = \pi/8 + \pi k /2 \) for \( k=0,1,2,3 \). So, the four points are at angles \( \pi/8, 5\pi/8, 9\pi/8, 13\pi/8 \), each separated by \( \pi/2 \).

So, plotting these points on the unit circle, they form a square rotated by \( \pi/8 \). So, yes, it is a square.

Then, when we shift it down by 1 unit, it's still a square, just translated. So, the area remains 2.

Therefore, the area is 2, which is \( 2^{1} \), so \( p = 2 \), \( a =1 \), \( b =1 \). So, \( a + b + p = 4 \).

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the area is 2. Let me double-check.

Wait, the four points \( w_j \) are vertices of a square with side length \( \sqrt{2} \) and area 2. So, that seems correct.

But let me consider another approach: finding the coordinates of each \( z_j \) and then computing the area.

So, each \( w_j = e^{i\theta_j} \), where \( \theta_j = \pi/8 + \pi k /2 \).

So, \( z_j = w_j - i = e^{i\theta_j} - i \).

Let me compute each \( z_j \) in terms of real and imaginary parts.

For \( w_1 = e^{i\pi/8} \):

\( z_1 = e^{i\pi/8} - i = \cos(\pi/8) + i \sin(\pi/8) - i = \cos(\pi/8) + i (\sin(\pi/8) - 1) \).

Similarly, for \( w_2 = e^{i5\pi/8} \):

\( z_2 = \cos(5\pi/8) + i (\sin(5\pi/8) - 1) \).

For \( w_3 = e^{i9\pi/8} \):

\( z_3 = \cos(9\pi/8) + i (\sin(9\pi/8) - 1) \).

For \( w_4 = e^{i13\pi/8} \):

\( z_4 = \cos(13\pi/8) + i (\sin(13\pi/8) - 1) \).

So, each \( z_j \) has coordinates:

\( ( \cos(\theta_j), \sin(\theta_j) - 1 ) \).

So, plotting these four points, each is on a circle of radius 1, shifted down by 1 unit in the imaginary direction.

Therefore, the four points are on a circle of radius 1, centered at \( (0, -1) \). Wait, no, actually, each \( z_j \) is \( e^{i\theta_j} - i \), so the center of the circle is at \( -i \), which is \( (0, -1) \) in the complex plane.

So, the four points lie on a circle of radius 1 centered at \( (0, -1) \). So, the four points are equally spaced on the circumference of this circle, each at angles \( \pi/8, 5\pi/8, 9\pi/8, 13\pi/8 \).

Wait, so it's a circle of radius 1, with four points equally spaced around it, forming a square.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a square with side length equal to the chord length between two adjacent points on the circle. So, chord length is \( 2 \times 1 \times \sin(\pi/4) = \sqrt{2} \).

Therefore, the side length is \( \sqrt{2} \), so the area is \( (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \).

But wait, if the four points lie on a circle of radius 1, the distance between two adjacent points is \( 2 \sin(\pi/4) = \sqrt{2} \), so the side length is \( \sqrt{2} \), and the area is \( 2 \).

Yes, so the area is 2. Hence, the area can be expressed as \( 2^{1} \), so \( p = 2 \), \( a =1 \), \( b=1 \). Therefore, \( a + b + p = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \).

But hold on, I just want to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in assuming the polygon is a square.

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is something else because the circle is shifted.

Wait, but shifting the circle down by 1 unit doesn't change the polygon's shape or area; it just translates it. So, the polygon is still a square with the same area as before.

Therefore, I think my conclusion is correct. The area is 2, so \( a + b + p = 4 \).

Wait, but let me consider another approach to compute the area. Maybe using coordinates.

So, let me compute the coordinates of each \( z_j \):

1. \( z_1 = \cos(\pi/8) + i (\sin(\pi/8) - 1) \)
2. \( z_2 = \cos(5\pi/8) + i (\sin(5\pi/8) - 1) \)
3. \( z_3 = \cos(9\pi/8) + i (\sin(9\pi/8) - 1) \)
4. \( z_4 = \cos(13\pi/8) + i (\sin(13\pi/8) - 1) \)

Let me compute these:

First, \( \cos(\pi/8) \) and \( \sin(\pi/8) \). These can be expressed using half-angle formulas.

We know that:

\( \cos(\pi/8) = \sqrt{(1 + \cos(\pi/4))/2} = \sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{2}/2)/2} = \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{2})/4} = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 \).

Similarly, \( \sin(\pi/8) = \sqrt{(1 - \cos(\pi/4))/2} = \sqrt{(1 - \sqrt{2}/2)/2} = \sqrt{(2 - \sqrt{2})/4} = \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 \).

Similarly, \( \cos(5\pi/8) = -\cos(3\pi/8) \) because \( 5\pi/8 = \pi - 3\pi/8 \). So, \( \cos(5\pi/8) = -\cos(3\pi/8) \).

Similarly, \( \sin(5\pi/8) = \sin(3\pi/8) \).

\( \cos(3\pi/8) \) is \( \sqrt{(2 - \sqrt{2})}/2 \), and \( \sin(3\pi/8) \) is \( \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{2})}/2 \).

Similarly, \( \cos(9\pi/8) = \cos(\pi + \pi/8) = -\cos(\pi/8) \), and \( \sin(9\pi/8) = -\sin(\pi/8) \).

Similarly, \( \cos(13\pi/8) = \cos(2\pi - 3\pi/8) = \cos(3\pi/8) \), and \( \sin(13\pi/8) = -\sin(3\pi/8) \).

So, let me write down all coordinates:

1. \( z_1 = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 + i (\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 - 1) \)
2. \( z_2 = -\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 + i (\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 - 1) \)
3. \( z_3 = -\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 + i (-\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 - 1) \)
4. \( z_4 = \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 + i (-\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 - 1) \)

So, these are the four points in the complex plane.

To compute the area, perhaps I can use the shoelace formula. But that might be complicated because these points are in terms of radicals. Alternatively, maybe using complex analysis.

Alternatively, notice that the four points form a square, so the area is the square of the distance between two adjacent points.

Wait, let me compute the distance between \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \):

\( z_1 = (\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2, \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 ) \)

\( z_2 = (-\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2, \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 ) \)

Compute the differences:

Δx = \( -\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 - \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 \)

Δy = \( \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 - (\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 ) = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 - \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 \)

So, distance squared is \( (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 \).

This seems messy, but maybe it simplifies.

Alternatively, since I know that in the \( w \)-plane, the area is 2, so shifting doesn't change the area, so the area remains 2. So, maybe this is the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area in the \( w \)-plane and then note that it's the same as in the \( z \)-plane.

But just to make sure, let me try to compute the area using coordinates.

Let me denote the coordinates as:

\( z_1 = (x_1, y_1) = ( \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2, \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 ) \)

\( z_2 = (x_2, y_2) = ( -\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2, \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 ) \)

\( z_3 = (x_3, y_3) = ( -\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2, -\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 ) \)

\( z_4 = (x_4, y_4) = ( \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2, -\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 ) \)

So, if I apply the shoelace formula:

Area = \( \frac{1}{2} | (x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_4 + x_4 y_1) - (y_1 x_2 + y_2 x_3 + y_3 x_4 + y_4 x_1) | \).

This seems quite involved, but let me proceed step by step.

First, let me compute \( x_1 y_2 \):

\( x_1 = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 \)

\( y_2 = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 \)

So, \( x_1 y_2 = (\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2)(\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 -1) \)

Similarly, \( x_2 y_3 \):

\( x_2 = -\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 \)

\( y_3 = -\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 \)

So, \( x_2 y_3 = (-\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2)( -\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 ) \)

Similarly, \( x_3 y_4 \):

\( x_3 = -\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 \)

\( y_4 = -\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 \)

So, \( x_3 y_4 = (-\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2)( -\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 ) \)

And \( x_4 y_1 \):

\( x_4 = \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 \)

\( y_1 = \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 \)

So, \( x_4 y_1 = (\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2)(\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 ) \)

Similarly, the other terms:

\( y_1 x_2 = (\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 -1)( -\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 ) \)

\( y_2 x_3 = (\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 -1)( -\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 ) \)

\( y_3 x_4 = ( -\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 )( \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}/2 ) \)

\( y_4 x_1 = ( -\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 -1 )( \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}/2 ) \)

This is getting very complicated, but let's see if terms cancel out.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to notice that the polygon is a square, so the shoelace formula should give the same area as the square.

But I was able to figure out earlier that the four points form a square with side length \( \sqrt{2} \), so area 2.

Alternatively, maybe we can use vectors or complex analysis to compute the area.

Wait, another approach: in the \( w \)-plane, the four points \( w_j \) are the fourth roots of \( i \). The roots are equally spaced on the unit circle, so they form a square. The area of this square is 2. Then, translating this square down by 1 unit doesn't change the area, so the area is still 2.

Therefore, confident that the area is 2, which is \( 2^1 \), so \( a=1 \), \( b=1 \), \( p=2 \), and \( a + b + p = 4 \).

Wait, but hold on one more thing. The problem says the solutions are the vertices of a convex polygon. If the polygon is a square, it's convex. If it's a different quadrilateral, maybe it's also convex, but in this case, the four points are equally spaced on a circle, so it's definitely a square.

Therefore, I think my conclusion is correct. The area is 2, so the answer is 4.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{4}
</think>

The given equation is \( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \). To find the solutions, we substitute \( w = z + i \) (i.e., \( z = w - i \)) and simplify the equation. After substitution, we find that the equation reduces to \( w^4 = i \).

The solutions for \( w \) are the fourth roots of \( i \), which are \( e^{i(\pi/8 + \pi k/2)} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \). These roots form a square on the unit circle in the complex plane, rotated by \( \pi/8 \).

Translating this square down by \( i \) (i.e., subtracting \( i \) from each solution) results in a square in the complex plane with vertices at \( z = w - i \). The area of this square remains unchanged by the translation.

The area of the square formed by the roots of \( w^4 = i \) is 2. Therefore, the area of the polygon formed by the solutions to the original equation is also 2. Expressing this area in the form \( p^{a/b} \), we have \( 2 = 2^{1} \), where \( p = 2 \), \( a = 1 \), and \( b = 1 \).

Thus, \( a + b + p = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \).

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
