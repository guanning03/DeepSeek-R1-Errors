Question:
A figure skater is facing north when she begins to spin to her right. She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?

Correct Answer:
Each full circle is 360 degrees.  Dividing 360 into 2250 gives a quotient of 6 with a remainder of 90.  So, she spins 90 degrees to her right past north, which leaves her facing $\boxed{\text{east}}$.

east

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here about a figure skater spinning and I need to figure out which direction she's facing after spinning 2250 degrees. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, figure skaters spin around a point, right? So, when she spins, she's rotating either clockwise or counterclockwise relative to her body. The problem says she starts facing north and spins to her right. Hmm, so spinning to her right while facing north would mean she's rotating clockwise, I think. Because if you're facing north and turn right, your direction of rotation is clockwise.

Now, she spins 2250 degrees. That's a lot of degrees! I remember that full rotations are 360 degrees, so I should probably figure out how many full rotations she does and then see how many degrees are left over. That leftover should tell me the final direction.

Let me write that down. To find how many full spins she does, I can divide 2250 by 360. So, 2250 divided by 360. Let me do that calculation. 360 goes into 2250 how many times?

Well, 360 times 6 is 2160. Because 360*5 is 1800, 360*6 is 2160. Then, 2250 minus 2160 is 90. So, she does 6 full rotations and then an additional 90 degrees. So, 6 full spins plus 90 degrees.

Since each full spin brings her back to her original direction, the 6 full rotations don't change her facing. So, what matters is the remaining 90 degrees. She started facing north, and she rotated 90 degrees clockwise. What direction is that?

Well, if you're facing north and turn 90 degrees clockwise, you end up facing east. Because north, then turning right (clockwise) 90 degrees is east. Similarly, if you turned left, it would be west, but in this case, it's a right turn.

Wait, let me make sure. So, facing north, a right turn (clockwise) 90 degrees is east, 180 degrees would be south, 270 degrees would be west, and 360 degrees back to north. So, 90 degrees is east. So, does that mean she ends up facing east after spinning 2250 degrees?

Hold on, let me check my math again because 2250 divided by 360 is equal to... let me compute it. 360*6 is 2160, as I said earlier. 2250 - 2160 is 90. So, 2250 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees in terms of direction because after every 360 degrees, the direction repeats.

But let me think another way. Maybe using modulo operation. 2250 modulo 360. So, 2250 divided by 360 is 6 with a remainder of 90, so 2250 ≡ 90 mod 360. Therefore, it's the same as a 90-degree rotation.

So, starting from north, spinning 90 degrees clockwise brings her to east. So, she's facing east.

Wait, but hold on, is a right turn 90 degrees clockwise? Let me visualize. If you're standing facing north, a right turn would make you face east, yes. Because right from north is east. So, that makes sense.

But let me think about another example. If she spun 180 degrees to the right from north, she'd be facing south. If she spun 270 degrees to the right, she'd end up facing west. And 360 would bring her back to north. So, 2250 is 6 full rotations plus 90, which is like 2250 = 6*360 + 90, so the 90 is the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of how many times she circles around. 2250 divided by 360 is approximately 6.25. So, she does 6 full circles and a quarter circle. A quarter circle is 90 degrees. So, a quarter circle clockwise from north is east.

I think that's consistent. So, the final direction should be east.

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the division. Let me compute 360 times 6.333... which is 2250, right? Because 360 divided by 3 is 120, so 2250 is 360*6.25. Wait, 360*6 is 2160, 360*0.25 is 90, so yes, 2250 is 6.25*360, which is 6 full rotations plus 90 degrees. So, yeah, 90 degrees clockwise from north is east.

Wait a second, but sometimes when people spin, they might think that 2250 degrees is a lot, but in terms of direction, it's equivalent to 90 degrees because direction cycles every 360 degrees. So, 2250 is more than 6 full spins, but the remainder is 90.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as multiple 360s. 2250 divided by 360 is 6 with 90 left. So, after 6 spins, she's back to north, and then she spins an additional 90 degrees. So, yeah, 90 degrees is the key.

Wait, another thought: figure skaters can spin really fast, but in terms of direction, each full rotation doesn't change the direction. So, regardless of how many spins she does, as long as it's a multiple of 360, she's facing the same direction. So, 2250 is 6*360 + 90, so she does 6 full spins, so no change, and then 90 degrees, which is a right turn.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider negative angles as counterclockwise, but in this case, since she's spinning to her right, which is clockwise, so positive angles. So, 2250 degrees is a positive rotation, clockwise.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me just think of it as angles on a circle. North is 0 degrees, then east is 90, south is 180, west is 270, and back to north at 360 degrees. So, if you add 2250 degrees to 0, modulo 360, you get 90 degrees. So, that's east.

But wait, let me double-check that math. 2250 divided by 360. So, 360*6 is 2160, subtract that from 2250, you get 90. So, 2250 is 90 degrees more than a multiple of 360. So, starting at north, 90 degrees clockwise is east.

Alternatively, if I think of 2250 degrees as 2250/360 = 6.25 full rotations, so 6 full rotations plus 0.25 of a rotation. 0.25 of a rotation is 90 degrees, same as before. So, yeah, 90 degrees.

Wait, another way: 2250 divided by 90 is 25. So, 25 steps of 90 degrees. So, starting at north, each 90 degrees is a quarter turn. So, 1st 90 is east, 2nd 90 is south, 3rd is west, 4th is north, and so on. So, 25 steps. 25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1. So, 25 steps of 90 degrees is equivalent to 1 step of 90 degrees, which is east. So, same result.

So, whether I do it by modulo, or by breaking it down into steps, I end up with 90 degrees, which is east.

Wait, let me verify once more. If she spins 2250 degrees, which is 6 full circles plus 90 degrees. Since each full circle is 360, 6*360=2160, 2250-2160=90. So, she's spun 90 degrees beyond her 6 full circles. So, starting from north, turning 90 degrees to the right, which is clockwise, brings her to east.

Alternatively, if she had turned 90 degrees counterclockwise, she would be facing west. But since she's turning right, which is clockwise, it's east.

Wait, could I have confused right with left? Let me think. If you're facing north and turn right, that's clockwise, so east. If you turn left, that's counterclockwise, which would be west. So, yes, right is clockwise, left is counterclockwise.

So, 2250 degrees is 6 full rotations plus 90 degrees clockwise. So, 6 full rotations don't matter, just the 90.

Hmm, another angle: maybe using the concept of reference angles or something else, but I think I've verified it enough ways.

Wait, let me think in terms of four quadrants. 0 degrees is north, 90 is east, 180 is south, 270 is west. So, 2250 degrees is 6*360 + 90, which is 2250. So, 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25, which is 6 full circles and a quarter. So, a quarter of a circle is 90 degrees, so same as before.

Wait, maybe another approach: 2250 divided by 45 is 50, so 50 steps of 45 degrees each. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe 2250 is 45*50. But in terms of direction, each 90 degrees is a quarter circle. So, 2250 divided by 90 is 25, so 25 quarter turns. So, starting at north, each quarter turn is 90 degrees. So, 25 quarter turns.

But 25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1. So, 25 quarter turns is 6 full circles and 1 quarter turn. So, the 1 quarter turn is 90 degrees. So, again, same as before.

Another way: think of 2250 as degrees in standard position. North is 0 degrees, east is 90, south is 180, west is 270. So, 2250 degrees is equivalent to 2250 modulo 360. 2250 divided by 360 is 6, remainder 90, so 2250 ≡ 90 mod 360. So, 90 degrees from north, clockwise, which is east.

Wait, is there a way she could be facing a different direction? For example, could she end up facing west? I don't think so because 2250 is an odd multiple of 90. Hmm, 90, 180, 270, 360. So, 2250 is 50*45, so 50 steps of 45, but I don't know if that helps.

Wait, 2250 divided by 45 is 50. So, 50 steps of 45 degrees each. So, each 45 degrees is a step, but since direction changes every 90 degrees, I don't know if that helps. Maybe not.

Wait, maybe using unit circle. Starting at (0,1) which is north, and rotating 2250 degrees. The unit circle is 360 degrees, so 2250 mod 360 is 90, so that's equivalent to 90 degrees, which is (0,1) rotated 90 degrees clockwise is (1,0), which is east.

Wait, yeah, so on the unit circle, 0 degrees is (1,0) which is east, but wait, no. Wait, actually, in standard position, 0 degrees is along the positive x-axis, which is east, but in the figure skater's perspective, she's facing north, which is often considered the positive y-axis. Hmm, so maybe this complicates things.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the coordinate system. If she starts facing north, which is the positive y-axis, then a right turn (clockwise) would point her towards east, which is the positive x-axis. So, in standard position, 0 degrees is east, but for her, starting at north, which is 90 degrees in standard position.

So, when she spins 2250 degrees clockwise, how does that translate?

Wait, so in standard position, starting at north (90 degrees), spinning 2250 degrees clockwise. So, her final angle in standard position is 90 - 2250 degrees. But wait, that would be negative. So, 90 - 2250 is -2160 degrees. Then, to find the equivalent positive angle, we add 360 until it's within 0 to 360.

So, -2160 + 360*7 is -2160 + 2520 = 360. Hmm, wait, 360 is the same as 0 degrees. So, in standard position, she ends up at 0 degrees, which is east.

Wait, hold on, that can't be. Because if she spins 2250 degrees, which is 6 full rotations plus 90, so starting from north, 6 full rotations bring her back to north, then 90 degrees clockwise is east. So, why does subtracting 2250 from 90 give me 0?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up here. In standard position, angles are measured from the positive x-axis (east). So, if she's starting at north, which is 90 degrees in standard position, and she's spinning 2250 degrees clockwise, her final position is 90 - 2250 degrees.

Calculating 90 - 2250 = -2160 degrees. To find the equivalent positive angle, we add 360 until it's between 0 and 360. So, let's calculate how many times 360 goes into -2160. 2160 divided by 360 is 6, so -2160 is -6*360. So, adding 6*360 to -2160 brings it to 0 degrees. So, 0 degrees in standard position is east.

Wait, so both methods give me east. So, yes, she ends up facing east.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as her total rotation: 2250 degrees clockwise from north. Each 90 degrees is a quarter turn. So, 2250 divided by 90 is 25. So, 25 quarter turns. Each quarter turn is 90 degrees.

Starting at north (0 degrees), each quarter turn clockwise:

1st quarter: east (90)
2nd: south (180)
3rd: west (270)
4th: north (360)

So, 25 quarter turns. 25 divided by 4 is 6 with remainder 1. So, 6 full cycles (24 quarter turns) bring her back to north, and then 1 more quarter turn brings her to east. So, same result.

Therefore, in all these different methods, I keep getting east as the final direction. So, I think that's the correct answer.

Just to make sure, let me think of another example. If she spins 90 degrees, she's east. 180, south. 270, west. 360, north. So, 2250 is 6*360 + 90. So, 2250 is like 6 full spins and a quarter spin, which is 90 degrees, so same as 90 degrees, which is east.

Alternatively, if she spun 2250 degrees counterclockwise, that would be a different story, but she's spinning to her right, which is clockwise, so it's 90 degrees clockwise.

Wait, to double-check, 2250 divided by 90 is 25, so 25 quarter turns. So, starting at north, each quarter turn is 90 degrees. So, 25 times 90 is 2250. So, 25 quarter turns: 25 divided by 4 is 6, remainder 1. So, 6 full rotations (24 quarter turns) bring her back to north, then 1 quarter turn brings her to east. So, same answer.

Alternatively, if I think of each 360 degrees as a full spin, 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25, so 6 full spins and 0.25 spins. 0.25 spins is 90 degrees, same as before.

Wait, another thought: 2250 divided by 45 is 50, so 50 steps of 45 degrees each. So, each 45 degrees is a eighth turn. So, 50 steps of 45 degrees is 2250. Starting from north, each 45 degrees is a direction change. So, 45 degrees from north is northeast, but since she's turning clockwise, each step is 45 degrees towards the right.

But, 2250 degrees is a lot, so 50 steps of 45 degrees each. But, in terms of direction, every 4 steps of 45 degrees is 180 degrees, so 4 steps is half a circle.

But, 2250 divided by 45 is 50. 50 divided by 4 is 12 with a remainder of 2. So, 12 full circles (48 steps) and 2 steps of 45 degrees. So, 12 full circles (540 degrees) plus 90 degrees (2 steps). So, 540 + 90 is 630 degrees? Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, maybe I confused something. 50 steps of 45 degrees is 2250 degrees. Each step is 45 degrees. So, 2250 divided by 45 is 50. So, 50 steps. Starting from north, each step is 45 degrees clockwise.

So, step 1: northeast (45)
Step 2: east (90)
Step 3: southeast (135)
Step 4: south (180)
Step 5: southwest (225)
Step 6: west (270)
Step 7: northwest (315)
Step 8: north (360)
... and so on.

So, every 8 steps brings her back to north. So, 50 divided by 8 is 6 with a remainder of 2. So, 6 full cycles (48 steps) bring her back to north, and then 2 more steps. So, 2 steps from north: first step is northeast, second step is east. So, 2 steps from north is east. So, final direction is east.

Wait, that's the same as before. So, regardless of how I approach it, I get east as the final direction.

Therefore, I think the answer is east.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{east}
</think>

The figure skater starts facing north and spins to her right, which is a clockwise rotation. To determine her final direction after spinning 2250 degrees, we need to find the equivalent angle within 0 to 360 degrees.

First, we calculate the number of full rotations and the remaining degrees:
\[ 2250 \div 360 = 6 \text{ remainder } 90 \]
This means 2250 degrees is equivalent to 6 full rotations (2160 degrees) plus 90 degrees.

Since each full rotation (360 degrees) brings her back to her original direction, we only need to consider the remaining 90 degrees. Spinning 90 degrees clockwise from north (0 degrees) brings her to east (90 degrees).

Thus, the figure skater is facing east after spinning 2250 degrees.

\[
\boxed{east}
