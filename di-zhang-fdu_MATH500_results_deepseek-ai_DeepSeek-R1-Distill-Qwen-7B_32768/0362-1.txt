Question:
What is the total surface area, in square inches, of a cube with a volume of $1$ cubic foot?

Correct Answer:
Recall that  $$1 \mbox{ foot} = 12 \mbox{ inches}$$

Hence $$1 \mbox{ foot}^2 = 12^2 \mbox{ inches}^2 = 144 \mbox{ inches}^2$$

Finally, remember the formula $V = l \times w \times h$, that is, Volume is the product of length, width, and height.

The length, height, and width for a cube are equal, so the cube we are given has sides of length $1 \mbox{ feet}$. Now, a cube has 6 faces, so the surface area of our cube is $$6 \times (1 \mbox{ foot} \times 1 \mbox{ foot}) = 6 \mbox{ feet}^2$$

Now, convert: $$ 6 \mbox{ feet}^2 \frac{144 \mbox{ inches}^2}{1 \mbox{ foot}^2} = 864 \mbox{ inches}^2$$

So, our final answer is $\boxed{864 \mbox{ inches}^2}$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to find the total surface area of a cube when its volume is 1 cubic foot. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the volume of a cube is calculated by side length cubed. So, if the volume is 1 cubic foot, then the side length must be the cube root of 1, right? 

Wait, let me write that down to make it clearer. Volume (V) of a cube is given by V = s³, where 's' is the length of a side. Here, V = 1 cubic foot, so s³ = 1. To find 's', I take the cube root of both sides, which gives s = ∛1. And since the cube root of 1 is 1, that means each side of the cube is 1 foot long. 

But hold on, the question asks for the surface area in square inches. So, I need to convert the side length from feet to inches first. I know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so each side of the cube is 12 inches. That makes sense. 

Now, the surface area (SA) of a cube is calculated by 6 times the area of one face. Each face of a cube is a square, so the area of one face is s². Therefore, the surface area would be 6s². 

Substituting the value of 's' in inches, which is 12 inches. So, SA = 6 * (12)². Let me compute that. 

First, 12 squared is 144, so 144 * 6. Hmm, 144 times 6. Let me do the multiplication step by step. 100 * 6 is 600, 40 * 6 is 240, and 4 * 6 is 24. Adding those together: 600 + 240 is 840, plus 24 is 864. So, the surface area is 864 square inches. 

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 12 inches is 1 foot, and we have a cube with 1 cubic foot volume. So, side length is 1 foot, which is 12 inches. Surface area is 6 faces, each face is 12x12 square inches. 12x12 is 144, multiplied by 6 is indeed 864. Yeah, that seems right.

Just to be thorough, let me verify the initial volume. If the side is 12 inches, then the volume in cubic inches would be 12³, which is 1728 cubic inches. But since 1 cubic foot is equal to 1728 cubic inches, that checks out. So, the side length in inches is correct. 

Therefore, the surface area is 6*(12²) = 6*144 = 864 square inches. 

I think that's solid. I converted the side length correctly from feet to inches, applied the surface area formula accurately, and even verified the volume to ensure my side length was right. So, I’m confident that 864 square inches is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The total surface area of the cube is \boxed{864} square inches.
</think>

The volume of a cube is given by \( V = s^3 \), where \( s \) is the side length. Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, we find the side length \( s \) as follows:

\[ s^3 = 1 \]
\[ s = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the side length in inches is:

\[ s = 12 \text{ inches} \]

The total surface area of a cube is calculated by \( 6s^2 \). Substituting \( s = 12 \) inches:

\[ \text{Surface Area} = 6 \times (12)^2 \]
\[ = 6 \times 144 \]
\[ = 864 \text{ square inches} \]

Thus, the total surface area of the cube is \(\boxed{864}\) square inches.
