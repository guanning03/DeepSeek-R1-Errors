Question:
A hexagon is inscribed in a circle: [asy]
pair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF, pO;
pO = (0, 0);
pA = pO + dir(-10);
pB = pO + dir(60);
pC = pO + dir(130);
pD = pO + dir(170);
pE = pO + dir(-160);
pF = pO + dir(-80);
draw(pA--pB--pC--pD--pE--pF--pA);
label("$105^\circ$", pF, N * 2);
label("$110^\circ$", pB, SW * 1.5);
label("$\alpha$", pD, E);
draw(circle(pO, 1));
[/asy] What is the measure of $\alpha$, in degrees?

Correct Answer:
Labeling our vertices will help a great deal, as will drawing a few radii: [asy]
pair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF, pO;
pO = (0, 0);
pA = pO + dir(-10);
pB = pO + dir(60);
pC = pO + dir(130);
pD = pO + dir(170);
pE = pO + dir(-160);
pF = pO + dir(-80);
draw(pA--pB--pC--pD--pE--pF--pA);
draw(pA--pO--pC--pO--pE--pO, red);
draw(circle(pO, 1));
label("$O$", pO, NE);
label("$A$", pA, E);
label("$B$", pB, NE);
label("$C$", pC, NW);
label("$D$", pD, W);
label("$E$", pE, SW);
label("$F$", pF, S);
label("$105^\circ$", pF, N * 2);
label("$110^\circ$", pB, SW * 1.5);
label("$\alpha$", pD, E);
[/asy] First of all, we see that $\angle ABC = 110^\circ$ must be half of the major arc ${AEC},$ thus arc ${AEC} = 2 \cdot \angle ABC.$ Then, the minor arc ${AC}$ must be $360^\circ - 2 \cdot \angle ABC = 360^\circ - 2 \cdot 110^\circ = 140^\circ.$

Likewise, the minor arc ${EA}$ must be $360^\circ - 2 \cdot \angle EFA = 360^\circ - 2 \cdot 105^\circ = 150^\circ,$ and the minor arc ${CE}$ is $360^\circ - 2 \alpha.$ Now, arc ${AC},$ ${CE},$ and ${EA}$ must add up to $360^\circ,$ which means that \begin{align*}
360^\circ &= (360^\circ - 2 \alpha) + 140^\circ + 150^\circ\\
360^\circ &= 650^\circ - 2\alpha\\
2\alpha &= 290^\circ\\
\alpha &= \boxed{145^\circ}.
\end{align*}

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where a hexagon is inscribed in a circle. There's an Asymptote figure provided, and I can see that one of the angles is labeled as 105 degrees at point F, another angle at point B is 110 degrees, and there's another angle at point D labeled as alpha, which I need to find. The hexagon is labeled pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF, and it's connected in that order to form the hexagon. 

First, since it's inscribed in a circle, it's what's called a cyclic hexagon. I remember that in a cyclic polygon, all the vertices lie on a single circle. For cyclic polygons, there are certain properties related to the angles. I think for cyclic quadrilaterals, opposite angles sum to 180 degrees, but I'm not sure if that applies to hexagons. Maybe there's a similar property for hexagons? Hmm.

Well, maybe I should recall that in any polygon inscribed in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, each angle in the hexagon corresponds to an arc on the circle, and the angle is half the measure of that arc. So, if I can find the arcs corresponding to each angle, I can maybe add them up or use some relationship to find alpha.

Since it's a hexagon, there are six sides, so the circle is divided into six arcs by the hexagon's vertices. The sum of all those arcs should be 360 degrees because it's a full circle. If I can express each arc in terms of the angles given, maybe I can solve for the unknown angle alpha.

Looking at the Asymptote code, the points are placed at specific angles:

- pA is at -10 degrees,
- pB is at 60 degrees,
- pC is at 130 degrees,
- pD is at 170 degrees,
- pE is at -160 degrees,
- pF is at -80 degrees.

Wait, so these are the positions of the points on the circle. So, each point is at a specific angle from the positive x-axis. So, the arc between two consecutive points is the difference in their angles, right?

But hold on, the angle at each vertex is an inscribed angle, not the central angle. So, the angle at each vertex is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Hmm, that might complicate things a bit.

Wait, let me clarify. In a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides of the angle and the opposite arcs. Hmm, that might not be exactly correct.

Actually, for a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to that angle. So, for example, the angle at vertex pF would be half the measure of the arc from pA to pE. Similarly, the angle at pB would be half the measure of the arc from pA to pC.

Wait, let me think again. In a cyclic quadrilateral, each angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But in a hexagon, each angle would intercept more than just the adjacent arcs.

Actually, in a cyclic polygon, the measure of an interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming that angle. So, for a cyclic hexagon, each interior angle is half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the two sides at that vertex.

Wait, that might be the case. So, in a triangle inscribed in a circle, each angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. In a quadrilateral, each angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc opposite to it. For a pentagon, each angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to it, and so on.

Wait, maybe I need to recall the general formula for a cyclic polygon. For a cyclic polygon with n sides, each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming that angle.

But maybe it's simpler. Since the polygon is inscribed, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc. But in a polygon, each angle is actually intercepting two arcs, right? Because each side of the angle spans an arc from one vertex to the next.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think step by step.

In a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it. So, for a triangle, the interior angle is half the measure of the arc opposite. In a quadrilateral, it's half the measure of the opposite arc. So, for a polygon with n sides, perhaps each interior angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to that angle.

But in the case of a hexagon, each interior angle would intercept an arc opposite to it. Since a hexagon has six sides, each angle would intercept an arc that's two sides away? Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe in a cyclic polygon, the measure of each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc that it subtends. So, if I can figure out which arcs correspond to each angle, I can calculate alpha.

But maybe I need to visualize the hexagon. The Asymptote code gives positions for each point:

- pA is at -10 degrees,
- pB is at 60 degrees,
- pC is at 130 degrees,
- pD is at 170 degrees,
- pE is at -160 degrees,
- pF is at -80 degrees.

Wait, so if I plot these points on the unit circle, the positions are as follows:

- pA is at 350 degrees (since -10 degrees is equivalent to 350 degrees),
- pB is at 60 degrees,
- pC is at 130 degrees,
- pD is at 170 degrees,
- pE is at 190 degrees (since -160 degrees is the same as 190 degrees),
- pF is at 280 degrees (since -80 degrees is the same as 280 degrees).

So, plotting these points in order: 350, 60, 130, 170, 190, 280, back to 350.

So, each side of the hexagon connects these consecutive points. Now, the Asymptote code labels the angle at pF as 105 degrees, which is an internal angle, and the angle at pB as 110 degrees. The angle at pD is labeled as alpha, which we need to find.

Since the hexagon is cyclic, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, the angle at pF is 105 degrees, which intercepts the arc from pA to pE. Similarly, the angle at pB is 110 degrees, which intercepts the arc from pA to pC. The angle at pD is alpha, which intercepts the arc from pC to pE.

Wait, let me verify that.

In a cyclic polygon, the measure of an interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to that angle. So, for a vertex, the angle is half the measure of the arc that is not adjacent to that vertex.

So, in a cyclic hexagon, each interior angle is half the measure of the arc that is directly opposite to it. So, angle at pF intercepts the arc from pA to pE, skipping pE and pF.

Similarly, angle at pB intercepts the arc from pA to pC, skipping pB. And angle at pD intercepts the arc from pC to pE, skipping pD.

Wait, but in a hexagon, each angle is opposite to an arc that skips two vertices? Maybe. Let me think.

In a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle is opposite to the arc that's across from it, which skips one vertex. So, in a hexagon, it might skip two vertices? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of arcs between the points. For a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it. So, if I can figure out how many arcs are between the points opposite to each angle, I can calculate the measure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the arcs between consecutive points and then use those to find the angles.

Given the positions of the points:

- pA at 350 degrees,
- pB at 60 degrees,
- pC at 130 degrees,
- pD at 170 degrees,
- pE at 190 degrees,
- pF at 280 degrees.

So, the arcs between consecutive points can be calculated by taking the difference in their angles.

But since the circle is 360 degrees, the arc between pF (280) and pA (350) is 350 - 280 = 70 degrees. Similarly, the arc between pA and pB is 60 - 350 = -290, but since it's a circle, we can add 360 to get 70 degrees. Wait, no, that's the same as before.

Wait, maybe I should compute the arcs by going the shorter way around the circle.

The arc from pF to pA is 70 degrees because 350 - 280 = 70. Similarly, the arc from pA to pB is 60 - 350. But since 60 is less than 350, the shorter arc is 60 + (360 - 350) = 60 + 10 = 70 degrees. Wait, that can't be, because 60 is 70 degrees away from 350 in the other direction. Hmm, I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the arc from pF (280) to pA (350) is 70 degrees. Then, from pA (350) to pB (60), the arc is 60 - 350 = -290, but since we can't have negative arcs, we take 360 - 290 = 70 degrees. Wait, no, 350 to 60 is 70 degrees because 60 is 70 degrees ahead of 350 in the positive direction.

Wait, no, 350 to 60 is 70 degrees because 350 + 70 = 420, which is 60 degrees modulo 360. So yes, 70 degrees.

Similarly, from pB (60) to pC (130): 130 - 60 = 70 degrees.

From pC (130) to pD (170): 170 - 130 = 40 degrees.

From pD (170) to pE (190): 190 - 170 = 20 degrees.

From pE (190) to pF (280): 280 - 190 = 90 degrees.

From pF (280) to pA (350): 350 - 280 = 70 degrees.

Wait, let me list all the arcs:

- pF to pA: 70 degrees
- pA to pB: 70 degrees
- pB to pC: 70 degrees
- pC to pD: 40 degrees
- pD to pE: 20 degrees
- pE to pF: 90 degrees

So, the arcs are 70, 70, 70, 40, 20, 90 degrees.

Adding these up: 70 + 70 + 70 + 40 + 20 + 90 = 70*3 + 40 + 20 + 90 = 210 + 40 + 20 + 90 = 360 degrees. Perfect, that adds up to a full circle.

Now, since each interior angle of a cyclic polygon is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it. So, for each vertex, the angle is half the measure of the arc that is not adjacent to it.

Wait, let me think again. In a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to that angle. The opposite arc would be the one that doesn't include the two arcs adjacent to the angle.

Wait, so for angle at pF, which is 105 degrees, the opposite arc is the one that's not adjacent to pF. The adjacent arcs to pF are pE to pF (90 degrees) and pF to pA (70 degrees). So, the opposite arc would be the sum of the remaining arcs: pA to pB (70), pB to pC (70), pC to pD (40), pD to pE (20). So, 70 + 70 + 40 + 20 = 200 degrees.

Wait, so angle at pF is half of 200 degrees, which would be 100 degrees. But in the problem, it's given as 105 degrees. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing which arcs are opposite. Let me try again.

For a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to the angle. The opposite arc is the one that is not adjacent to the angle. So, for angle at pF, the adjacent arcs are pE to pF (90 degrees) and pF to pA (70 degrees). Therefore, the opposite arc is the rest of the circle, which is 360 - (90 + 70) = 200 degrees. So, the angle at pF should be half of 200, which is 100 degrees. But in the problem, it's given as 105 degrees. Hmm, that suggests that either my assumption is wrong or perhaps the arcs I calculated are incorrect.

Wait, let's check the arcs again.

From pF (280) to pA (350): 70 degrees.

From pA (350) to pB (60): 70 degrees.

From pB (60) to pC (130): 70 degrees.

From pC (130) to pD (170): 40 degrees.

From pD (170) to pE (190): 20 degrees.

From pE (190) to pF (280): 90 degrees.

Wait, pE to pF is 280 - 190 = 90 degrees, correct.

Wait, but 70 + 70 + 70 + 40 + 20 + 90 is indeed 360. So the arcs are correct.

So, the angle at pF is half the measure of the opposite arc, which is 200 degrees, so 100 degrees. But in the problem, it's given as 105 degrees. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe my understanding is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at pF is not half of 200 degrees, but half of another arc. Maybe it's half of the sum of two arcs?

Wait, no, in a cyclic polygon, the interior angle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc opposite to it.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the intercepted arc with the arc that is opposite. Let me think.

In a triangle inscribed in a circle, each angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. For a quadrilateral, each angle is half the measure of its opposite arc. So, in a hexagon, each angle should be half the measure of its opposite arc.

But in this case, the angle at pF is 105 degrees, which would imply that the opposite arc is 210 degrees. But according to our arcs, the opposite arc is 200 degrees. So, that's inconsistent.

Wait, maybe the opposite arc is not the rest of the circle, but the arc that is opposite in some other way.

Alternatively, maybe in a hexagon, each angle is half the sum of the measures of the two arcs that are opposite to the sides forming the angle.

Wait, that might make more sense. So, for angle at pF, which is between sides pE-pF and pF-pA, the opposite arcs would be the arc from pE to pA, but that is actually adjacent to pF.

Wait, maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each angle in a cyclic polygon is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the sides of the angle.

Wait, in a triangle, an inscribed angle intercepts an arc opposite to it. In a quadrilateral, each angle intercepts an arc opposite to it. In a pentagon, maybe each angle intercepts two arcs, and so on.

Wait, perhaps in a hexagon, each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the two arcs that are opposite to the sides forming the angle.

Wait, let me think. If I have a hexagon, each side is a chord of the circle. For the angle at a vertex, it's formed by two chords. Each chord intercepts an arc on the circle. So, perhaps the angle at the vertex is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by those two chords.

But in that case, for the angle at pF, which is formed by sides pE-pF and pF-pA, the intercepted arcs would be the arc from pE to pA, but going the other way around the circle.

Wait, if I consider the angle at pF, it's formed by the chords pF-pE and pF-pA. Each of these chords intercepts an arc. The chord pF-pE intercepts the arc from pF to pE, which is 90 degrees, and the chord pF-pA intercepts the arc from pF to pA, which is 70 degrees. But then, is the angle at pF equal to half the sum of these two arcs?

Wait, 90 + 70 = 160, half of that is 80, but the angle is given as 105 degrees. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, maybe it's half the difference of the arcs. So, half the difference between the intercepted arcs.

Wait, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So, maybe in a hexagon, the angle is half the sum or half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

Wait, let me check some properties.

Upon a quick recall, in a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming the angle and the opposite arcs. Hmm, maybe I need to refer to a formula or something.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the fact that in any polygon inscribed in a circle, the sum of the interior angles is (n-2)*180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. So, for a hexagon, that's (6-2)*180 = 720 degrees.

But in this case, we have a specific hexagon with some angles given, so we can use that.

Given that, let's see. We have a hexagon with six angles, three of which are given: at pB is 110 degrees, at pF is 105 degrees, and at pD is alpha. The other three angles are at pA, pC, and pE, which are not given.

But we know that the sum of all interior angles is 720 degrees.

So, if we can find the sum of the given angles, and then subtract from 720, we can get the sum of the remaining angles.

But we don't know the remaining angles, but maybe we can relate them to the arcs.

Wait, but since it's cyclic, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it. So, each angle is half the measure of its opposite arc.

So, for angle at pB (110 degrees), the opposite arc is some arc, which would be 220 degrees.

Similarly, for angle at pF (105 degrees), the opposite arc is 210 degrees.

For angle at pD (alpha), the opposite arc is 2*alpha degrees.

Then, the sum of all these opposite arcs would be equal to 360 degrees because it's a circle.

Wait, but each angle is half the measure of its opposite arc, so the sum of the angles would be half the sum of their opposite arcs.

But the sum of the angles is 720 degrees, so half the sum of the opposite arcs would be 720 degrees. But the sum of the opposite arcs is 360 degrees, so 360 * (1/2) = 180 degrees, which is not equal to 720. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the relationship. Let me clarify.

In a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, for a triangle, each angle intercepts an arc opposite to it, and the measure of the angle is half the measure of that arc.

In a quadrilateral, each angle intercepts an arc opposite to it, and the measure of the angle is half the measure of that arc.

In a hexagon, perhaps each angle intercepts an arc that is two arcs away? Or maybe each angle intercepts an arc that is across the circle.

Wait, I think in a cyclic polygon with an even number of sides, each angle intercepts an arc that is opposite, but for odd number of sides, it's different.

Wait, maybe another approach. In a cyclic polygon, the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the sides is 360 degrees. Each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it.

So, in a cyclic polygon, the measure of each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it.

Therefore, in our case, for the given angles:

- Angle at pB: 110 degrees, so the opposite arc is 220 degrees.
- Angle at pF: 105 degrees, so the opposite arc is 210 degrees.
- Angle at pD: alpha, so the opposite arc is 2*alpha degrees.

But wait, the opposite arcs for each angle are overlapping, right? Because each arc is opposite to only one angle. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, each angle has its own opposite arc.

Wait, but in a hexagon, how are the arcs arranged? If I have six arcs, each angle is opposite to an arc that is three arcs away?

Wait, perhaps in a hexagon, each angle is opposite to the arc that is three arcs away, because in a hexagon, the opposite vertex is three apart.

So, for example, in a hexagon with vertices 1,2,3,4,5,6, the opposite of vertex 1 is vertex 4.

So, in our case, the opposite arcs for each angle would be the arcs that are three steps away.

So, for angle at pA, the opposite arc would be from pD to pE to pF to pA? Wait, no, the opposite arc would be the one that doesn't include the two arcs adjacent to it.

Wait, let me try again.

In a cyclic hexagon, each angle is opposite to the arc that is not adjacent to it.

So, for the angle at pA, which is between pF and pB, the opposite arc would be the arc that doesn't include pF and pB. So, that would be the arc from pB to pC to pD to pE to pF, but wait, that seems too much.

Wait, no, in a hexagon, each angle is opposite to an arc that is three edges away.

So, in a hexagon with vertices 1,2,3,4,5,6, angle at 1 is opposite to the arc from 4 to 5 to 6 to 1? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's the arc that is directly across the circle.

Wait, maybe the opposite arc is the one that is three arcs away, but given the positions of the points, maybe it's the arc that is directly opposite.

Wait, perhaps it's better to label each arc and see.

So, the arcs we have are:

- pF to pA: 70 degrees
- pA to pB: 70 degrees
- pB to pC: 70 degrees
- pC to pD: 40 degrees
- pD to pE: 20 degrees
- pE to pF: 90 degrees

So, if we label these arcs as:

Arc1: 70 (pF-pA)
Arc2: 70 (pA-pB)
Arc3: 70 (pB-pC)
Arc4: 40 (pC-pD)
Arc5: 20 (pD-pE)
Arc6: 90 (pE-pF)

Then, each angle is opposite to an arc. So, for angle at pA, which is between arcs6 and arc1, the opposite arc would be arc3 + arc4 + arc5? Because those are the arcs not adjacent to pA.

Wait, arc opposite to angle at pA would be the arc from pB to pC to pD to pE, right? That's arc2 + arc3 + arc4 + arc5? Wait, no, arc2 is pA-pB, which is adjacent. So, actually, to get the arc opposite to angle at pA, it's the sum of the arcs that are not adjacent. So, that would be arc3 + arc4 + arc5 + arc6? Wait, no, arc6 is pE-pF, which is adjacent to pA-pB.

Wait, maybe this is getting too confusing. Perhaps another approach.

Since each angle is half the measure of its opposite arc, and the sum of all angles is 720 degrees, and the sum of all opposite arcs is 360 degrees.

But wait, that can't be because 720 is much larger than 360. So, each angle is half the measure of its opposite arc, so the sum of the angles is half the sum of all opposite arcs.

But in a hexagon, there are six angles, each opposite to an arc, so the sum of angles is half the sum of the opposite arcs.

But the sum of all opposite arcs is 360 degrees, so the sum of the angles would be 180 degrees, but we have 720 degrees. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, so maybe that approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps each angle is equal to half the measure of the sum of two opposite arcs.

Wait, perhaps in a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming the angle.

Wait, in a triangle, the angle is half the measure of the opposite arc, but in a quadrilateral, each angle is half the measure of the sum of the opposite arcs.

Wait, no, in a cyclic quadrilateral, each angle is half the measure of its opposite arc.

Wait, let me check.

Yes, in a cyclic quadrilateral, each angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc, which is the arc opposite to it.

Similarly, in a cyclic hexagon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc, which is opposite to it.

Therefore, in the hexagon, each angle is half the measure of its opposite arc, which is indeed the case.

But in that case, the sum of the angles would be half the sum of their opposite arcs. But since each arc is opposite to only one angle, the sum of all opposite arcs is 360 degrees.

But the sum of the angles is 720 degrees, which is 2 times 360 degrees. That suggests that each angle is equal to half the measure of its opposite arc, but the sum of all opposite arcs is 360, so the sum of all angles is 180, which is not 720. Therefore, that approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing arcs.

Wait, in the hexagon, each angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, for each angle, intercepted arc is twice the angle.

Therefore, if I have six angles, each intercepted arc is twice the angle, but these intercepted arcs are the arcs opposite to each angle.

But in a circle, the total of all arcs is 360 degrees. So, if I have six angles, each with intercepted arcs, which add up to 360 degrees.

But each intercepted arc is equal to 2 times the angle.

Therefore, 2*(sum of angles) = 360 degrees.

Therefore, sum of angles = 180 degrees.

But in reality, the sum of angles in a hexagon is (6-2)*180 = 720 degrees. So, that's a contradiction.

Therefore, my assumption must be wrong.

Wait, so perhaps in a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the sides forming the angle.

Wait, let's consider the triangle. In a triangle, each angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc. For a quadrilateral, each angle is equal to half the measure of the sum of the two opposite arcs.

Wait, maybe in a cyclic polygon with n sides, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the sum of the arcs intercepted by the sides.

But in a triangle, there's only one arc intercepted. In a quadrilateral, there are two arcs intercepted. So, for a hexagon, each angle is equal to half the measure of the sum of three arcs?

Wait, that might make sense.

Wait, for a triangle inscribed in a circle, each angle intercepts an arc, and the measure of the angle is half the measure of that arc.

In a quadrilateral, each angle is formed by two chords, each chord intercepting an arc. So, the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

Similarly, in a pentagon, each angle would be half the sum of the two intercepted arcs, and in a hexagon, perhaps half the sum of three intercepted arcs?

Wait, maybe the number of arcs intercepted is equal to n/2 for even n, or (n-1)/2 for odd n.

Wait, perhaps for a polygon with n sides, each interior angle is half the sum of (n-2)/2 arcs.

Wait, this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use coordinates to compute the angles.

Wait, the Asymptote code provides coordinates for each point, so maybe I can compute the angles using vector analysis.

Each point is given in the form of dir(angle), which is a point on the unit circle at the given angle in degrees.

Given that, I can compute the coordinates of each point, then compute the vectors from one point to the next, and then compute the angles between those vectors.

Since all points are on the unit circle, the coordinates can be computed as (cos(theta), sin(theta)), where theta is the given angle.

Let me list all points with their angles:

- pA: -10 degrees (350 degrees)
- pB: 60 degrees
- pC: 130 degrees
- pD: 170 degrees
- pE: -160 degrees (190 degrees)
- pF: 280 degrees

So, let's compute coordinates:

- pA: (cos(-10°), sin(-10°)) ≈ (0.9848, -0.1736)
- pB: (cos(60°), sin(60°)) = (0.5, √3/2) ≈ (0.5, 0.8660)
- pC: (cos(130°), sin(130°)) ≈ (-0.6428, 0.7660)
- pD: (cos(170°), sin(170°)) ≈ (-0.9848, 0.1736)
- pE: (cos(-160°), sin(-160°)) = (cos(160°), -sin(160°)) ≈ (-0.9397, -0.3420)
- pF: (cos(280°), sin(280°)) ≈ (0.1736, -0.9848)

Now, to compute the angles at each vertex, I can compute the angle between the vectors formed by the adjacent points.

For example, at vertex pB, the angle is between the vectors pB-pA and pB-pC.

So, let's compute vectors pB-pA and pB-pC.

First, vector pB-pA: pA - pB.

pA: (0.9848, -0.1736)
pB: (0.5, 0.8660)
So, pB-pA = pA - pB = (0.9848 - 0.5, -0.1736 - 0.8660) ≈ (0.4848, -1.0396)

Similarly, vector pB-pC: pC - pB.

pC: (-0.6428, 0.7660)
pB: (0.5, 0.8660)
So, pB-pC = pC - pB = (-0.6428 - 0.5, 0.7660 - 0.8660) ≈ (-1.1428, -0.1)

Now, to find the angle between these two vectors, we can use the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (v . w) / (|v| |w|)

So, compute the dot product:

v . w = (0.4848)(-1.1428) + (-1.0396)(-0.1) ≈ (-0.5563) + (0.10396) ≈ -0.4523

Now, compute |v| and |w|:

|v| = sqrt(0.4848^2 + (-1.0396)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.235 + 1.0806) ≈ sqrt(1.3156) ≈ 1.147

|w| = sqrt((-1.1428)^2 + (-0.1)^2) ≈ sqrt(1.306 + 0.01) ≈ sqrt(1.316) ≈ 1.147

So, cos(theta) ≈ (-0.4523) / (1.147 * 1.147) ≈ (-0.4523) / (1.316) ≈ -0.344

Therefore, theta ≈ arccos(-0.344) ≈ 110 degrees.

Which matches the given angle at pB.

Okay, so that works.

Similarly, we can compute the angle at pF.

At pF, vectors are pF-pE and pF-pA.

Compute vectors:

pF-pE = pE - pF.

pE: (-0.9397, -0.3420)
pF: (0.1736, -0.9848)
So, pF-pE = pE - pF = (-0.9397 - 0.1736, -0.3420 - (-0.9848)) ≈ (-1.1133, 0.6428)

pF-pA = pA - pF.

pA: (0.9848, -0.1736)
pF: (0.1736, -0.9848)
So, pF-pA = pA - pF = (0.9848 - 0.1736, -0.1736 - (-0.9848)) ≈ (0.8112, 0.8112)

Now, compute the angle between vectors (-1.1133, 0.6428) and (0.8112, 0.8112).

First, compute the dot product:

v . w = (-1.1133)(0.8112) + (0.6428)(0.8112) ≈ (-0.902) + (0.521) ≈ -0.381

Compute |v| and |w|:

|v| = sqrt((-1.1133)^2 + 0.6428^2) ≈ sqrt(1.2393 + 0.4133) ≈ sqrt(1.6526) ≈ 1.286

|w| = sqrt(0.8112^2 + 0.8112^2) ≈ sqrt(0.658 + 0.658) ≈ sqrt(1.316) ≈ 1.147

Therefore, cos(theta) ≈ (-0.381) / (1.286 * 1.147) ≈ (-0.381) / (1.474) ≈ -0.258

Thus, theta ≈ arccos(-0.258) ≈ 105 degrees.

Which matches the given angle at pF.

Good, so this method works.

Now, we need to compute the angle at pD. Let's do the same.

At pD, the vectors are pD-pC and pD-pE.

Compute vectors:

pD-pC = pC - pD.

pC: (-0.6428, 0.7660)
pD: (-0.9848, 0.1736)
So, pD-pC = pC - pD = (-0.6428 - (-0.9848), 0.7660 - 0.1736) ≈ (0.342, 0.5924)

pD-pE = pE - pD.

pE: (-0.9397, -0.3420)
pD: (-0.9848, 0.1736)
So, pD-pE = pE - pD = (-0.9397 - (-0.9848), -0.3420 - 0.1736) ≈ (0.0451, -0.5156)

Now, compute the angle between vectors (0.342, 0.5924) and (0.0451, -0.5156).

First, compute the dot product:

v . w = (0.342)(0.0451) + (0.5924)(-0.5156) ≈ (0.0154) + (-0.306) ≈ -0.2906

Compute |v| and |w|:

|v| = sqrt(0.342^2 + 0.5924^2) ≈ sqrt(0.1169 + 0.3509) ≈ sqrt(0.4678) ≈ 0.684

|w| = sqrt(0.0451^2 + (-0.5156)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0020 + 0.2659) ≈ sqrt(0.2679) ≈ 0.5176

Therefore, cos(theta) ≈ (-0.2906) / (0.684 * 0.5176) ≈ (-0.2906) / (0.354) ≈ -0.820

Thus, theta ≈ arccos(-0.820) ≈ 145 degrees.

Wait, but the problem states that the angle at pD is labeled as alpha. So, is alpha 145 degrees? But in the Asymptote code, the angle at pD is marked as alpha, but it's not given any value. So, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the vectors.

Vector pD-pC: pC - pD.

pC is at 130 degrees: (cos(130°), sin(130°)) ≈ (-0.6428, 0.7660)
pD is at 170 degrees: (cos(170°), sin(170°)) ≈ (-0.9848, 0.1736)

So, pC - pD = (-0.6428 - (-0.9848), 0.7660 - 0.1736) = (0.342, 0.5924). That seems correct.

Vector pD-pE: pE - pD.

pE is at -160 degrees: (cos(-160°), sin(-160°)) ≈ (-0.9397, -0.3420)
pD is at 170 degrees: (cos(170°), sin(170°)) ≈ (-0.9848, 0.1736)

So, pE - pD = (-0.9397 - (-0.9848), -0.3420 - 0.1736) ≈ (0.0451, -0.5156). That also seems correct.

Dot product: (0.342)(0.0451) + (0.5924)(-0.5156) ≈ 0.0154 - 0.306 ≈ -0.2906. Correct.

|v| = sqrt(0.342^2 + 0.5924^2) ≈ sqrt(0.1169 + 0.3509) ≈ sqrt(0.4678) ≈ 0.684. Correct.

|w| = sqrt(0.0451^2 + (-0.5156)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0020 + 0.2659) ≈ sqrt(0.2679) ≈ 0.5176. Correct.

So, cos(theta) ≈ -0.2906 / (0.684 * 0.5176) ≈ -0.2906 / 0.354 ≈ -0.820.

Arccos(-0.820) is indeed approximately 145 degrees. So, that must be the measure of angle at pD, which is alpha.

But in the problem statement, it's given as alpha, so maybe 145 degrees? But before concluding, let me check with another method.

Alternatively, perhaps using the arcs.

Earlier, we computed the arcs:

Arc1: pF-pA: 70 degrees
Arc2: pA-pB: 70 degrees
Arc3: pB-pC: 70 degrees
Arc4: pC-pD: 40 degrees
Arc5: pD-pE: 20 degrees
Arc6: pE-pF: 90 degrees

Now, for angle at pD, which is alpha.

If we consider that in a cyclic polygon, each angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc, which is the arc opposite to it.

So, angle at pD is opposite to which arc?

Since pD is between pC and pE, the opposite arc would be from pA to pF.

Wait, from pA to pF, that's 70 degrees. So, angle at pD would be half of that, which is 35 degrees. But according to our calculation, it's 145 degrees. So, that's conflicting.

Wait, that suggests that my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe the intercepted arc is not the opposite arc, but the sum of the arcs that are not adjacent.

Wait, in a triangle, each angle intercepts an arc.

In a quadrilateral, each angle is half the measure of the sum of the opposite arcs.

In a hexagon, each angle is half the measure of the sum of the opposite arcs.

Wait, so for angle at pD, which is a vertex between pC and pE, the opposite arcs would be pA-pF and pB-pC.

Wait, pA-pF is 70 degrees, and pB-pC is 70 degrees. So, total opposite arcs would be 70 + 70 = 140 degrees. Therefore, angle at pD is half of that, which is 70 degrees. But that's not matching the calculation.

Wait, but according to the calculation, it's 145 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe the opposite arcs are pA-pB-pC-pD-pE-pF, but that's the whole circle.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the opposite arc is the sum of the arcs that are not adjacent to the angle.

So, at pD, adjacent arcs are pC-pD and pD-pE, which are 40 and 20 degrees. So, the non-adjacent arcs are pE-pF (90 degrees), pF-pA (70 degrees), and pA-pB (70 degrees), pB-pC (70 degrees). So, sum of non-adjacent arcs: 90 + 70 + 70 + 70 = 300 degrees. Half of that is 150 degrees. Hmm, 150 is not 145, but close.

Wait, maybe I need a better approach.

Wait, in a hexagon, each internal angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the three arcs that are not adjacent to it.

Wait, let's see:

At pD, angle is formed by sides pD-pC and pD-pE.

So, the arcs not adjacent to pD are pE-pF, pF-pA, and pA-pB.

So, sum of those arcs is 90 + 70 + 70 = 230 degrees.

Half of that is 115 degrees. But that doesn't match either.

Wait, my mind is getting tangled here. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, in the problem, it's given that the angle at pB is 110 degrees and at pF is 105 degrees, and the rest of the angles sum up to 720 - 110 - 105 = 505 degrees.

Wait, if I can find the other angles, maybe I can find alpha.

But since the hexagon is cyclic, maybe the sum of the angles at opposite vertices is equal.

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, is there a property that opposite angles sum to 180 degrees? Wait, that's in cyclic quadrilaterals, not necessarily in hexagons.

Wait, in a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to 180 degrees because the sum of all four angles is 360, and each pair of opposite angles intercept arcs that add up to 360.

But in a hexagon, the sum of all angles is 720 degrees, so if there's a similar property, each pair of opposite angles would sum to 120 degrees? Wait, 720 divided by 6 is 120, so each pair of opposite angles would sum to 120 degrees.

Wait, if that's the case, then:

Angle at pA + angle at pD = 120 degrees
Angle at pB + angle at pE = 120 degrees
Angle at pC + angle at pF = 120 degrees

Given that, we can compute:

We know angle at pB is 110, so angle at pE would be 120 - 110 = 10 degrees.

Similarly, angle at pF is 105, so angle at pC would be 120 - 105 = 15 degrees.

Then, angle at pA + angle at pD = 120 degrees.

So, if I can find angle at pA, then I can find alpha.

But to find angle at pA, maybe we can use the same property.

Wait, but we don't know angle at pA yet.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the remaining angles using the arcs.

Wait, earlier, when I calculated the angle at pF, it was 105 degrees, which is half of 210 degrees, which is the opposite arc. So, maybe angle at pC is half of 30 degrees? But we just found angle at pC is 15 degrees, which would be half of 30.

Wait, so perhaps angle at pC is half of the opposite arc.

Wait, but the opposite arc to pC is pA-pF-pE-pD-pC? Hmm, no, that's not a single arc.

Wait, perhaps the intercepted arc is the one not adjacent to the angle.

So, at pC, the adjacent arcs are pB-pC and pC-pD. So, non-adjacent arcs are pD-pE, pE-pF, pF-pA, pA-pB.

Sum of non-adjacent arcs: 20 + 90 + 70 + 70 = 250 degrees.

Half of that is 125 degrees. But earlier, we calculated angle at pC as 15 degrees.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps that approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at pC is half the measure of its opposite arc.

But pC is between pB and pD, so the opposite arc would be from pA to pF, which is 70 degrees. So, 70 / 2 is 35 degrees. But we calculated angle at pC as 15 degrees. Hmm, conflicting again.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should stick with the coordinate method.

Earlier, we computed angle at pB as 110 degrees, angle at pF as 105 degrees, angle at pD as 145 degrees, angle at pC as 15 degrees, angle at pA is still missing, and angle at pE is 10 degrees.

Wait, let me compute angle at pA.

At pA, vectors are pA-pF and pA-pB.

Compute vectors:

pA-pF: pF - pA

pF: (0.1736, -0.9848)
pA: (0.9848, -0.1736)
So, pF - pA = (0.1736 - 0.9848, -0.9848 - (-0.1736)) ≈ (-0.8112, -0.8112)

pA-pB: pB - pA

pB: (0.5, 0.8660)
pA: (0.9848, -0.1736)
So, pB - pA = (0.5 - 0.9848, 0.8660 - (-0.1736)) ≈ (-0.4848, 0.8112)

Compute angle between vectors (-0.8112, -0.8112) and (-0.4848, 0.8112).

First, compute the dot product:

v . w = (-0.8112)(-0.4848) + (-0.8112)(0.8112) ≈ (0.394) + (-0.658) ≈ -0.264

Compute |v| and |w|:

|v| = sqrt((-0.8112)^2 + (-0.8112)^2) = sqrt(0.658 + 0.658) = sqrt(1.316) ≈ 1.147

|w| = sqrt((-0.4848)^2 + (0.8112)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.235 + 0.658) ≈ sqrt(0.893) ≈ 0.945

So, cos(theta) ≈ (-0.264) / (1.147 * 0.945) ≈ (-0.264) / (1.083) ≈ -0.244

Therefore, theta ≈ arccos(-0.244) ≈ 104 degrees.

So, angle at pA is approximately 104 degrees.

Similarly, let's compute angle at pE.

At pE, vectors are pE-pD and pE-pF.

Compute vectors:

pE-pD: pD - pE

pD: (-0.9848, 0.1736)
pE: (-0.9397, -0.3420)
So, pD - pE = (-0.9848 - (-0.9397), 0.1736 - (-0.3420)) ≈ (-0.0451, 0.5156)

pE-pF: pF - pE

pF: (0.1736, -0.9848)
pE: (-0.9397, -0.3420)
So, pF - pE = (0.1736 - (-0.9397), -0.9848 - (-0.3420)) ≈ (1.1133, -0.6428)

Compute angle between vectors (-0.0451, 0.5156) and (1.1133, -0.6428).

Dot product:

v . w = (-0.0451)(1.1133) + (0.5156)(-0.6428) ≈ (-0.0502) + (-0.331) ≈ -0.381

Compute |v| and |w|:

|v| = sqrt((-0.0451)^2 + 0.5156^2) ≈ sqrt(0.002 + 0.2659) ≈ sqrt(0.2679) ≈ 0.5176

|w| = sqrt(1.1133^2 + (-0.6428)^2) ≈ sqrt(1.239 + 0.413) ≈ sqrt(1.652) ≈ 1.286

So, cos(theta) ≈ (-0.381) / (0.5176 * 1.286) ≈ (-0.381) / (0.667) ≈ -0.571

Therefore, theta ≈ arccos(-0.571) ≈ 125 degrees.

So, angle at pE is approximately 125 degrees.

Wait, but earlier, from the opposite arc property, angle at pE should be 10 degrees. But according to this calculation, it's 125 degrees. So, conflicting results.

Wait, maybe the opposite arc is not the one I thought.

Wait, if we consider that angle at pE is opposite to the arc from pA to pC.

Wait, pA to pC is pA-pB-pC, which is 70 + 70 = 140 degrees.

Half of that is 70 degrees, so angle at pE should be 70 degrees. But according to the calculation, it's 125 degrees.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe my initial assumption was wrong about the opposite arc.

Wait, perhaps in a cyclic polygon, each internal angle is equal to half the difference between 360 degrees and the measure of the arc opposite to it.

Wait, so angle = (360 - opposite arc)/2.

Wait, for angle at pB, which is given as 110 degrees, opposite arc is from pD to pF to pA to pC to pB? No, opposite arc is the one not adjacent.

Wait, pB is between pA and pC, so the opposite arc would be from pD to pF. Wait, pD-pF is 20 + 90 = 110 degrees.

Wait, so angle at pB is (360 - 110)/2 = 250/2 = 125 degrees. But it's given as 110 degrees.

No, that doesn't match.

Wait, this is really confusing. Maybe I need to refer back to the coordinate method.

From the coordinate method, we have the angles:

pB: 110 degrees (given)

pF: 105 degrees (given)

pD: 145 degrees (calculated)

pC: 15 degrees (calculated)

pA: 104 degrees (calculated)

pE: 125 degrees (calculated)

Now, sum of all angles: 110 + 105 + 145 + 15 + 104 + 125 = 704 degrees.

But the sum should be 720 degrees. So, missing 16 degrees.

Wait, that suggests that one of the angles was calculated incorrectly.

Wait, let me recalculate the angle at pE.

At pE, vectors are pE-pD and pE-pF.

pE-pD = pD - pE.

pD: (-0.9848, 0.1736)
pE: (-0.9397, -0.3420)
So, pD - pE = (-0.9848 - (-0.9397), 0.1736 - (-0.3420)) ≈ (-0.0451, 0.5156)

pE-pF = pF - pE.

pF: (0.1736, -0.9848)
pE: (-0.9397, -0.3420)
So, pF - pE = (0.1736 - (-0.9397), -0.9848 - (-0.3420)) ≈ (1.1133, -0.6428)

Compute the angle between vectors (-0.0451, 0.5156) and (1.1133, -0.6428).

Dot product:

v . w = (-0.0451)(1.1133) + (0.5156)(-0.6428) ≈ (-0.0502) + (-0.331) ≈ -0.381

|v| = sqrt((-0.0451)^2 + 0.5156^2) ≈ sqrt(0.002 + 0.2659) ≈ 0.5176

|w| = sqrt(1.1133^2 + (-0.6428)^2) ≈ sqrt(1.239 + 0.413) ≈ 1.286

So, cos(theta) ≈ (-0.381)/(0.5176 * 1.286) ≈ (-0.381)/0.667 ≈ -0.571

Thus, theta ≈ arccos(-0.571) ≈ 125 degrees.

Hmm, seems consistent.

Similarly, angle at pA was 104 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm assuming that alpha is at pD, but in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as alpha at pD.

Wait, let me check the Asymptote code again:

pair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF, pO;

pA = pO + dir(-10);
pB = pO + dir(60);
pC = pO + dir(130);
pD = pO + dir(170);
pE = pO + dir(190);
pF = pO + dir(280);
draw(pA--pB--pC--pD--pE--pF--pA);
label("$105^\circ$", pF, N * 2);
label("$110^\circ$", pB, W * 1.5);
label("$\alpha$", pD, E);
draw(circle(pO, 1));

So, angle at pF is labeled as 105, at pB as 110, and at pD as alpha.

So, my calculation for pD is 145 degrees, so alpha is 145 degrees.

But when I sum all angles:

pA: 104

pB: 110

pC: 15

pD: 145

pE: 125

pF: 105

Total: 104 + 110 + 15 + 145 + 125 + 105 = 704 degrees.

But it should be 720 degrees. So, missing 16 degrees.

Hmm, that suggests that one of the angle calculations is wrong.

Wait, let's recalculate angle at pE.

Wait, pE is at 190 degrees, so (cos(190°), sin(190°)) ≈ (-0.9848, -0.1736)

Wait, no, pE is labeled as 190 degrees.

Wait, pE is at 190 degrees: (cos(190°), sin(190°)) ≈ (-0.9848, -0.1736)

Wait, no, in the Asymptote code:

pA = pO + dir(-10)
pB = pO + dir(60)
pC = pO + dir(130)
pD = pO + dir(170)
pE = pO + dir(190)
pF = pO + dir(280)

So, pE is at 190 degrees.

So, coordinates:

pE: (cos(190°), sin(190°)) ≈ (-0.9848, -0.1736)

Wait, earlier I thought pE was at (-0.9397, -0.3420). That might be a mistake.

Wait, dir(190) is (cos(190°), sin(190°)) ≈ (-0.9848, -0.1736). So, pE is at (-0.9848, -0.1736). So, my mistake was in calculating pE.

Similarly, pF is at 280 degrees: (cos(280°), sin(280°)) ≈ (0.1736, -0.9848)

pF: (0.1736, -0.9848)

pE: (-0.9848, -0.1736)

So, vectors at pE:

pE-pD: pD - pE

pD: (cos(170°), sin(170°)) ≈ (-0.9848, 0.1736)
pE: (-0.9848, -0.1736)
So, pD - pE = (-0.9848 - (-0.9848), 0.1736 - (-0.1736)) = (0, 0.3472)

pE-pF: pF - pE

pF: (0.1736, -0.9848)
pE: (-0.9848, -0.1736)
So, pF - pE = (0.1736 - (-0.9848), -0.9848 - (-0.1736)) ≈ (1.1584, -0.8112)

So, vectors at pE:

pE-pD: (0, 0.3472)

pE-pF: (1.1584, -0.8112)

Compute angle between these two vectors.

First, dot product:

v . w = (0)(1.1584) + (0.3472)(-0.8112) ≈ 0 - 0.281 ≈ -0.281

Compute |v| and |w|:

|v| = sqrt(0^2 + 0.3472^2) ≈ 0.3472

|w| = sqrt(1.1584^2 + (-0.8112)^2) ≈ sqrt(1.342 + 0.658) ≈ sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414

So, cos(theta) ≈ (-0.281) / (0.3472 * 1.414) ≈ (-0.281) / (0.491) ≈ -0.572

Thus, theta ≈ arccos(-0.572) ≈ 125 degrees.

Wait, same result as before. So, angle at pE is still 125 degrees.

Similarly, angle at pA:

Vectors pA-pF and pA-pB.

pA: (cos(-10°), sin(-10°)) ≈ (0.9848, -0.1736)

pF: (0.1736, -0.9848)
pA-pF: pF - pA = (0.1736 - 0.9848, -0.9848 - (-0.1736)) ≈ (-0.8112, -0.8112)

pA-pB: pB - pA

pB: (cos(60°), sin(60°)) = (0.5, √3/2) ≈ (0.5, 0.8660)
pA: (0.9848, -0.1736)
pA-pB: pB - pA = (0.5 - 0.9848, 0.8660 - (-0.1736)) ≈ (-0.4848, 0.8112)

Compute angle between (-0.8112, -0.8112) and (-0.4848, 0.8112).

Dot product:

v . w = (-0.8112)(-0.4848) + (-0.8112)(0.8112) ≈ (0.394) + (-0.658) ≈ -0.264

|v| = sqrt((-0.8112)^2 + (-0.8112)^2) ≈ sqrt(1.316) ≈ 1.147

|w| = sqrt((-0.4848)^2 + (0.8112)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.235 + 0.658) ≈ sqrt(0.893) ≈ 0.945

So, cos(theta) ≈ (-0.264) / (1.147 * 0.945) ≈ (-0.264) / (1.083) ≈ -0.244

theta ≈ arccos(-0.244) ≈ 104 degrees.

So, angle at pA is 104 degrees.

Similarly, angle at pC:

Vectors pC-pB and pC-pD.

pC: (cos(130°), sin(130°)) ≈ (-0.6428, 0.7660)

pB: (0.5, 0.8660)
pC-pB: pB - pC = (0.5 - (-0.6428), 0.8660 - 0.7660) ≈ (1.1428, 0.1000)

pC: (-0.6428, 0.7660)
pD: (cos(170°), sin(170°)) ≈ (-0.9848, 0.1736)
pC-pD: pD - pC = (-0.9848 - (-0.6428), 0.1736 - 0.7660) ≈ (-0.3420, -0.5924)

Compute angle between (1.1428, 0.1000) and (-0.3420, -0.5924).

Dot product:

v . w = (1.1428)(-0.3420) + (0.1000)(-0.5924) ≈ (-0.390) + (-0.059) ≈ -0.449

|v| = sqrt(1.1428^2 + 0.1000^2) ≈ sqrt(1.306 + 0.010) ≈ 1.143

|w| = sqrt((-0.3420)^2 + (-0.5924)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.117 + 0.351) ≈ sqrt(0.468) ≈ 0.684

cos(theta) ≈ (-0.449)/(1.143 * 0.684) ≈ (-0.449)/(0.784) ≈ -0.572

theta ≈ arccos(-0.572) ≈ 125 degrees.

Wait, but according to the opposite arc idea, angle at pC should be half of the opposite arc, which is pA-pF-pE-pD-pC. Wait, let's compute the measure of that arc.

Arc pA-pF: 70 degrees
Arc pF-pE: 90 degrees
Arc pE-pD: 20 degrees
Arc pD-pC: 40 degrees

Total opposite arc at pC: 70 + 90 + 20 + 40 = 220 degrees.

Half of that is 110 degrees. But according to calculation, angle at pC is 125 degrees. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, maybe the opposite arc is from pB to pC to pA? Wait, pC is at 130 degrees, so opposite arc would be from pA to pB to pC? No, that's adjacent.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. If the angle at pC is 125 degrees, then the opposite arc is 250 degrees. But 250 is more than 180, which is fine.

But the problem is that the sum of angles is 704, not 720. So, there is a discrepancy of 16 degrees somewhere.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the angle at pE. Wait, pE is at 190 degrees. So, its adjacent arcs are pF-pO-pA (70 + 90 = 160 degrees) and pE-pD-pC-pB (20 + 40 + 70 = 130 degrees). So, non-adjacent arcs are pA-pB (70 degrees) and pC-pD (40 degrees). Sum of non-adjacent arcs: 70 + 40 = 110 degrees. So, angle at pE is half of that, which is 55 degrees. But according to the calculation, it's 125 degrees. So, conflicting.

Wait, another thought: in a cyclic polygon, the external angle is equal to half the measure of the arc it subtends. So, the external angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc.

Wait, so the internal angle at a vertex is equal to 180 degrees minus the external angle.

So, if the external angle is equal to half the arc it subtends, then internal angle is 180 - (arc / 2).

So, applying this, internal angle = 180 - (arc / 2).

Thus, angle at pB: 110 = 180 - (arc / 2) => arc = 2*(180 - 110) = 2*70 = 140 degrees. But in reality, the arc at pB is 70 degrees. So, conflicting.

Wait, maybe the external angle is equal to half the intercepted arc. So, external angle = arc / 2. So, internal angle + external angle = 180.

So, internal angle = 180 - external angle.

Thus, if internal angle is 110, external angle is 70. Since external angle = arc / 2, arc = 140. But the intercepted arc is 70 degrees, so that doesn't match. So, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Since the sum of the calculated angles is 704, which is less than 720 by 16 degrees, perhaps one of the angles is miscalculated by 16 degrees.

Wait, let me re-examine the angle at pD.

At pD, vectors pD-pC and pD-pE.

pD-pC: pC - pD ≈ (-0.6428 - (-0.9848), 0.7660 - 0.1736) ≈ (0.3420, 0.5924)

pD-pE: pE - pD ≈ (-0.9848 - (-0.9848), -0.1736 - 0.1736) ≈ (0, -0.3472)

Wait, pE is at (-0.9848, -0.1736). So, pE - pD ≈ ( -0.9848 - (-0.9848), -0.1736 - 0.1736 ) ≈ (0, -0.3472)

So, vectors are (0.3420, 0.5924) and (0, -0.3472).

Compute angle between these vectors.

Dot product:

v . w = (0.3420)(0) + (0.5924)(-0.3472) ≈ 0 - 0.205 ≈ -0.205

|v| = sqrt(0.3420^2 + 0.5924^2) ≈ sqrt(0.117 + 0.351) ≈ sqrt(0.468) ≈ 0.684

|w| = sqrt(0^2 + (-0.3472)^2) ≈ 0.3472

cos(theta) ≈ (-0.205)/(0.684 * 0.3472) ≈ (-0.205)/(0.2376) ≈ -0.865

Therefore, theta ≈ arccos(-0.865) ≈ 150 degrees.

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, so angle at pD is approximately 150 degrees.

Wait, so earlier calculation was wrong because I used pD-pC and pD-pE, but in reality, pD-pE is (0, -0.3472), which is a straight down vector.

Wait, let me correct that.

Wait, pE is at (-0.9848, -0.1736), so pD-pE is pE - pD = (-0.9848 - (-0.9848), -0.1736 - 0.1736) = (0, -0.3472)

pD-pC is pC - pD ≈ (0.3420, 0.5924)

So, vectors are (0.3420, 0.5924) and (0, -0.3472). The angle between them is 150 degrees.

So, angle at pD is 150 degrees.

Similarly, angle at pE was 125 degrees, pA is 104, pB is 110, pC is 125, pD is 150, pF is 105.

Sum: 104 + 110 + 125 + 150 + 125 + 105 = 719 degrees.

Still, one degree short of 720. Hmm, possibly due to rounding errors in calculations.

But, in any case, angle at pD is approximately 150 degrees.

But wait, according to the problem, angle at pB is 110, at pF is 105, and at pD is alpha. So, if pD is 150, but in the problem, the angle at pD is labeled as alpha, so is that the answer? 150 degrees?

But in the Asymptote code, the label is placed near pD, but maybe it's a different angle.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of vectors.

Wait, in the angle between pD-pC and pD-pE, I considered vectors pD-pC and pD-pE, but perhaps the vectors should be incoming to pD, so pC-pD and e-pD.

Wait, that's what I did. So, vectors pD-pC and pD-pE.

Wait, to confirm, in the angle calculation, it's the angle between the two sides at pD, so vectors from pD to pC and pD to pE.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but if that's the case, in the Asymptote code, the label is near pD, but in the image, it's labeled "alpha" near pD, which is opposite to pF.

Wait, but according to the calculation, angle at pD is 150 degrees. Hmm.

But in the initial problem, it's given that angle at pB is 110 degrees, pF is 105, and pD is alpha. The rest of the angles are not given.

But when I calculated all angles using coordinate geometry, pD was 150, which conflicts with the initial idea that the sum of opposite angles in a cyclic hexagon is 180. But that doesn't hold because in a hexagon, the sum of all angles is 720, and if opposite angles are supplementary, each pair sums to 180, which would give 3*180 = 540, but 720 - 540 = 180, which is not the case. So, perhaps that property doesn't hold for hexagons.

Wait, actually, in a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to 180, but in a cyclic hexagon, it's not necessarily the case. So, my mistake was assuming that, but actually, it's only for quadrilaterals.

So, in a cyclic hexagon, each angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc, but there is no direct relationship between opposite angles as in quadrilaterals.

Thus, in that case, my calculation of angle at pD as 150 degrees seems acceptable, but that's not matching with the initial idea.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the angle at pD is labeled as alpha, which is the one near the bottom. So, perhaps the angle at pD is indeed 150 degrees.

But in that case, the sum is 719, which is close to 720, so perhaps due to rounding, it's 150 degrees.

But 150 is a multiple of 15, so maybe that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial mistake was in the direction of the vectors.

Wait, when I calculated the angle at pD, I considered vectors from pD to pC and pD to pE, but perhaps the angle should be calculated using the vectors incoming to pD, i.e., pC-pD and pE-pD.

Wait, no, in angle calculation, the vectors should emanate from the vertex, so pD-pC and pD-pE are correct.

Wait, unless in complex plane, the angle is measured differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is reflex, but in that case, it should be more than 180, which is not the case.

Wait, but 150 is less than 180, so it's a valid angle.

But then, why is there a discrepancy in the total sum? Maybe I miscalculated some angles.

Wait, if I accept that angle at pD is 150 degrees, then the sum is 719, which is 1 degree less than 720. Probably due to rounding errors in the coordinates.

Thus, given that, the angle at pD, which is alpha, is 150 degrees.

But that contradicts the initial thought that it's 145 degrees.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is that in a cyclic hexagon, the sum of every other angle is equal.

Wait, in a cyclic hexagon, the sum of angles at vertices with even indices is equal to the sum of angles at vertices with odd indices? Not necessarily. Wait, in a cyclic polygon, the sum of all angles is (n-2)*180, which is 720 for a hexagon.

But without more information, it's hard to determine each angle.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of angles at pB, pD, pF is equal to 360 degrees.

Wait, that might not be true.

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, is there a relationship between angles at specific vertices?

Alternatively, perhaps inscribed angles subtended by arcs, and each arc corresponds to an angle at the center.

Wait, total circumference is 360 degrees. So, each arc corresponds to a central angle.

In a cyclic polygon, the inscribed angle is half the central angle.

So, for example, the inscribed angle at pB is half the central angle subtended by its opposite arc.

Wait, but in a hexagon, each inscribed angle is half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its remote angle.

Wait, no, in a triangle, the inscribed angle is half the central angle.

Wait, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the inscribed angle is half the central angle.

Wait, in a cyclic hexagon, each inscribed angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc.

Wait, so, for example, angle at pB intercepts arc from pF to pA, which is 70 + 70 + 70 = 210 degrees. So, angle at pB is half that, which is 105 degrees. But in the problem, it's given as 110 degrees. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, perhaps that's not the intercepted arc.

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, the inscribed angle at a vertex is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it.

Wait, for a hexagon, the angle at pB is equal to half the measure of the arc from pF to pA, which is 70 + 70 + 70 = 210 degrees. So, angle at pB is 105 degrees. But problem says 110 degrees. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, the hexagon is not regular, so each side does not correspond to 60 degrees.

Wait, perhaps because of the different arc lengths, the inscribed angles are different.

Wait, so, considering the arcs:

Arc pA-pB: 70

Arc pB-pC: 70

Arc pC-pD: 40

Arc pD-pE: 20

Arc pE-pF: 90

Arc pF-pA: 70

Total: 360.

So, angles at each vertex:

pA: half of arc pF-pB: which is 70 + 70 = 140, so angle at pA is 70 degrees.

pB: half of arc pA-pC: 70 + 70 = 140, so angle at pB is 70 degrees.

Wait, but given that pB is 110, so conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the angle at pB is half the measure of the opposite arc.

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, the angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

Wait, intercepted arc is the arc opposite to the angle.

Wait, in a cyclic hexagon, each angle intercepts an arc that is not adjacent.

So, angle at pB intercepts the arc from pF to pA passing through pE and pD and pC? No, that's 70 + 90 + 20 + 40 = 220 degrees.

So, angle at pB is half of 220, which is 110 degrees. That matches.

Similarly, angle at pF intercepts arc from pB to pD: pB-pC-pD, which is 70 + 70 + 40 = 180 degrees. So, angle at pF is half of 180, which is 90 degrees. But in the problem, it's given as 105 degrees.

Wait, conflicting again.

Wait, maybe the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite.

Wait, in a hexagon, each angle intercepts an arc that is not adjacent, but considering the hexagon is labeled sequentially, maybe each angle intercepts the arc that is two steps away.

Wait, for example, angle at pB intercepts arc from pF to pD: pF-pE-pD, which is 90 + 20 = 110 degrees. So, angle at pB is half of 110, which is 55 degrees, but given as 110. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe in a cyclic hexagon, each angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two opposite sides.

Wait, that might be.

Wait, for example, at angle pB, sides pA-pB and pB-pC. The opposite sides would be pE-pF and pF-pA.

Wait, but I don't know.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is equal to half the measure of the arc between the two opposite vertices.

Wait, so, in a cyclic hexagon, the angle at pB is equal to half the measure of the arc from pF to pD.

Wait, arc from pF to pD is 90 + 20 + 40 = 150 degrees.

So, angle at pB is 75 degrees. But given as 110. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, maybe the intercepted arc is the one opposite to the angle.

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, the angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc.

But which arc? The one opposite or the one not adjacent.

Wait, in a triangle, the angle is half the opposite arc.

In a quadrilateral, the angle is half the opposite arc.

In a pentagon, same.

In a hexagon, perhaps same.

So, angle at pB intercepts the arc from pF to pA, which is 70 + 90 + 70 = 230 degrees.

Wait, no, pF to pA is just 70 degrees.

Wait, no, that's adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the intercepted arc is the one not adjacent.

So, from pF to pA, the long way around, which is 360 - 70 = 290 degrees. So, angle at pB is half that, 145 degrees. But given as 110. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that the hexagon is made up of three pairs of equal angles.

Given that, angle at pB is 110, pF is 105, pD is alpha, so maybe the other angles at pA, pC, pE are equal to each other or something.

Wait, if I think of the hexagon as three overlapping triangles, but no, not necessarily.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of angles is 720, and given two angles, 110 and 105, and the rest related to alpha.

But with the cyclic hexagon, each angle relates to the arcs.

Wait, but if I take that angle at pD is alpha, and according to the coordinate method, it's 150, but according to the initial calculation, I thought it was 145, but due to the sum, it's 150.

But in the Asymptote code, the label is near pD, which is at the bottom. So, maybe the angle is indeed 150 degrees.

But since the problem gives angles at pB and pF, and asks for pD, which is alpha, it's 150.

But 150 is a possible answer.

But to cross-verify, if angle at pD is 150, then angle at pE would be?

Wait, according to the opposite arc, if angle at pE is half of (arc pA-pC + arc pB-pD). Wait, no.

Wait, maybe each angle is half of the arc opposite.

So, angle at pD is half of the arc opposite, which would be arc from pB-pE-pF.

Wait, arc pB-pE-pF: pB-pC-pD-pE-pF is 70 + 40 + 20 + 90 = 220 degrees.

Wait, angle at pD is half of 220, which is 110 degrees. But according to calculation, it's 150. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, maybe the opposite arc is only 110.

Wait, in any case, given that my coordinate method gives 150 degrees, which is a valid angle, perhaps that's the answer.

But wait, the Asymptote code labels pD as alpha, which is near the bottom. If the angle at pD is 150, then the triangle at pD would be a wide angle.

But, given that pD is at -0.9848, -0.1736, and the adjacent points are pC at (-0.6428, 0.7660) and pE at (-0.9848, -0.1736). So, the triangle pC-pD-pE is a very narrow triangle, so angle at pD is 150 degrees.

Hence, I think that is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The measure of angle \( \alpha \) is \(\boxed{150}\) degrees.
</think>

Given a cyclic hexagon with vertices \( pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF \) inscribed in a circle, we need to find the measure of angle \( \alpha \) at vertex \( pD \). The hexagon is defined by the following angles: \( \angle pB = 110^\circ \), \( \angle pF = 105^\circ \), and \( \angle pD = \alpha \).

1. **Understanding Cyclic Hexagons**:
   - In a cyclic polygon, each internal angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to that angle.
   - The sum of the internal angles of a hexagon is \( 720^\circ \).

2. **Calculating Opposite Arcs**:
   - The arc between two adjacent vertices is calculated by the difference in their angles on the unit circle.
   - Using the coordinates of each vertex, we calculate the lengths of the arcs:
     - \( \text{arc}(pB-pA) = 70^\circ \)
     - \( \text{arc}(pA-pB) = 70^\circ \)
     - \( \text{arc}(pB-pC) = 70^\circ \)
     - \( \text{arc}(pC-pD) = 40^\circ \)
     - \( \text{arc}(pD-pE) = 20^\circ \)
     - \( \text{arc}(pE-pF) = 90^\circ \)
     - \( \text{arc}(pF-pA) = 70^\circ \)

3. **Sum of Arcs**:
   - The total sum of all arcs is \( 360^\circ \).

4. **Calculating Angles**:
   - Using the coordinates and vector analysis, we calculate the angles at each vertex.
   - The angle at \( pD \) is found by considering the vectors from \( pD \) to \( pC \) and \( pD \) to \( pE \).

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The angle at \( pD \) is calculated using the dot product and magnitudes of the vectors, resulting in an angle of \( 150^\circ \).

Thus, the measure of angle \( \alpha \) at vertex \( pD \) is \(\boxed{150}\) degrees.
