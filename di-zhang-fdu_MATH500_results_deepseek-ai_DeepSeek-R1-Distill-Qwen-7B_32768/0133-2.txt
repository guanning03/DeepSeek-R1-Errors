Question:
For what values of $x$ is it true that $x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10$? Express your answer in interval notation.

Correct Answer:
Re-arranging, $x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0$. The left-hand quadratic factors as $x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0$. Thus, $x-7$ and $x+2$ have opposite signs, so $-2 \le x \le 7$ and $\boxed{x \in [-2,7]}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out for what values of x the inequality x² - 5x - 4 ≤ 10 holds true. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. I've solved inequalities before, but it's been a bit, so I need to recall the process.

First, I think I should bring all terms to one side to make it easier to handle. That means subtracting 10 from both sides. Let me write that out:

x² - 5x - 4 - 10 ≤ 0

Simplifying that, I get:

x² - 5x - 14 ≤ 0

Alright, so now the inequality is x² - 5x - 14 ≤ 0. I remember that to solve a quadratic inequality, it's helpful to first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation. So, let me set x² - 5x - 14 equal to zero and solve for x.

x² - 5x - 14 = 0

Hmm, how do I solve this? I can try factoring, but I'm not sure if this quadratic factors nicely. Let me think. I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Let me see: factors of -14 are (1, -14), (-1, 14), (2, -7), (-2, 7). Which pair adds up to -5?

Let me check each pair:

1 + (-14) = -13
-1 + 14 = 13
2 + (-7) = -5
-2 + 7 = 5

Ah, there we go! 2 and -7 multiply to -14 and add to -5. So, that means I can factor the quadratic as:

(x + 2)(x - 7) = 0

Let me check to make sure I factored correctly:

(x + 2)(x - 7) = x² -7x + 2x -14 = x² -5x -14. Yep, that's correct.

So, setting each factor equal to zero:

x + 2 = 0 => x = -2

x - 7 = 0 => x = 7

Okay, so the roots are x = -2 and x = 7. These are the critical points that divide the number line into intervals where the quadratic expression could change its sign. Since the quadratic is a parabola opening upwards (because the coefficient of x² is positive), it will be below or on the x-axis between the roots.

So, the expression x² - 5x - 14 is less than or equal to zero between x = -2 and x = 7. To be thorough, let me test each interval.

First, the intervals are:

1. x < -2
2. -2 < x < 7
3. x > 7

I'll pick test points in each interval and plug them into the quadratic expression to see if it's positive or negative.

1. For x < -2, let's choose x = -3:
   (-3)² -5*(-3) -14 = 9 +15 -14 = 10, which is positive. So, the expression is positive here.

2. For -2 < x < 7, let's choose x = 0:
   0² -5*0 -14 = -14, which is negative. So, the expression is negative in this interval.

3. For x > 7, let's choose x = 8:
   8² -5*8 -14 = 64 -40 -14 = 10, which is positive. So, the expression is positive here.

Therefore, since we have the inequality ≤ 0, we're looking for where the expression is negative or zero. That occurs in the interval between -2 and 7, including the endpoints because the inequality is non-strict (i.e., ≤ 0).

So, putting it all together, the solution in interval notation is:

[-2, 7]

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, the quadratic was correctly factored, the roots are correct, the test points seem to check out. Also, since the parabola opens upwards, it's positive outside the roots and negative between them. So, yes, between -2 and 7, the expression is negative or zero, which satisfies the inequality.

Hmm, another way to check could be to graph the quadratic. If I imagine the graph, it's a U-shaped parabola crossing the x-axis at -2 and 7, and the vertex is somewhere in between. Since it opens upwards, the minimum point is below the x-axis, so the graph is below the x-axis between the roots. That means the quadratic is ≤ 0 between x = -2 and x = 7.

Alright, I think that's solid. So, the answer is [-2, 7].

**Final Answer**
The values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality are expressed in interval notation as \boxed{[-2, 7]}.
</think>

To determine for what values of \( x \) the inequality \( x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10 \) holds true, we start by bringing all terms to one side:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \le 0
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0
\]

Next, we solve the corresponding quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \). Factoring the quadratic, we get:

\[
(x + 2)(x - 7) = 0
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives the roots:

\[
x + 2 = 0 \implies x = -2
\]
\[
x - 7 = 0 \implies x = 7
\]

These roots divide the number line into three intervals: \( x < -2 \), \( -2 < x < 7 \), and \( x > 7 \). We test each interval to determine where the quadratic expression is non-positive.

- For \( x < -2 \), choosing \( x = -3 \) results in a positive value.
- For \( -2 < x < 7 \), choosing \( x = 0 \) results in a negative value.
- For \( x > 7 \), choosing \( x = 8 \) results in a positive value.

Since the quadratic expression is non-positive between \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 7 \), the solution to the inequality is:

\[
[-2, 7]
\]

Thus, the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality are expressed in interval notation as \(\boxed{[-2, 7]}\).
