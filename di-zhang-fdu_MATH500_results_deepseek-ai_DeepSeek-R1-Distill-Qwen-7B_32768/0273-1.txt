Question:
A figure skater is facing north when she begins to spin to her right. She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?

Correct Answer:
Each full circle is 360 degrees.  Dividing 360 into 2250 gives a quotient of 6 with a remainder of 90.  So, she spins 90 degrees to her right past north, which leaves her facing $\boxed{\text{east}}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem where a figure skater is facing north and she spins to her right for 2250 degrees. I need to figure out which direction she's facing after that spin. Hmm, okay, figure skating spins are typically measured in degrees, right? So, if she spins 2250 degrees to her right, that's a full rotation plus some extra.

First, I know that a full rotation is 360 degrees. So, if she spins 360 degrees, she'll end up facing the same direction, which is north in this case. So, if she spins 360 degrees, that's a full circle, back to north. But she spun 2250 degrees, which is more than 360. So, maybe I should figure out how many full rotations she made and then the remaining degrees beyond that.

So, let me try dividing 2250 by 360 to see how many full rotations that is. Let me do that calculation: 2250 divided by 360. Hmm, 360 times 6 is 2160, right? Because 360 times 5 is 1800, plus another 360 is 2160, which is 6 times. So, 2160 degrees is 6 full rotations. Then, 2250 minus 2160 is 90 degrees. So, after 6 full rotations, she has 90 degrees left. That means her spin is equivalent to 90 degrees to the right after the full rotations.

So, she starts facing north, spins 2250 degrees, which is 6 full spins plus 90 degrees, so effectively, she's spun 90 degrees to her right from north. Now, I need to figure out which direction that is. So, if she's spinning to her right, which is clockwise, starting from north.

Let me recall the directions in order: North, East, South, West. So, if she's facing north and spins clockwise (to her right), the order is north to east to south to west and back to north. So, each quarter turn is 90 degrees.

So, starting at north, 90 degrees clockwise would be east. 180 degrees would be south, 270 degrees would be west, and 360 brings her back to north. Since she only spun 90 degrees beyond the full rotations, she would be facing east.

Wait, but let me confirm. So, 90 degrees right from north is east, 180 is south, 270 is west, correct? So, yeah, 90 degrees is east.

But hold on, is 2250 degrees a lot? Let me just think. 360 is a full circle, so 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25. So, 6 full spins and a quarter spin. So, 0.25 of 360 is 90 degrees. So, yes, that's 90 degrees. So, that's why it's equivalent to 90 degrees.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: 2250 degrees modulo 360. So, 2250 divided by 360 is 6 with a remainder. 6 times 360 is 2160, subtract that from 2250, you get 90. So, 2250 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees in terms of direction. So, yeah, it's a 90-degree turn.

So, starting at north, turning 90 degrees to the right (clockwise), she ends up facing east. So, the answer should be east.

But, just to make sure, maybe I can visualize it.

Imagine the figure skater spinning. Starting at north, spinning to her right, so her initial position is north. When she spins 90 degrees, she's facing east. 180 degrees, she's facing south. 270 degrees, she's facing west, and 360, she's back to north. So, 2250 is 6 full circles (which is 2160) plus 90, so she's facing east.

Alternatively, if I think of the unit circle, where 0 degrees is east, but wait, no, in figure skating, 0 degrees is north if you're facing north. But in standard math, 0 degrees is east? Wait, no, in standard math, 0 degrees is along the positive x-axis, which is east, but in figure skating, 0 degrees is north. So, perhaps I have to adjust my thinking.

Wait, so in standard math, 0 degrees is to the right (east), 90 degrees is up (north), 180 is to the left (west), 270 is down (south). But in figure skating, when they refer to degrees, 0 degrees is north, and positive angles go clockwise. So, yes, similar to standard mathematical angles but starting at north instead of east.

So, in that case, 90 degrees would be east, because it's a quarter turn clockwise from north. So, yeah, that's consistent.

Alternatively, if someone is more familiar with standard math angles, 90 degrees in math is north in figure skating. So, that's a bit confusing, but in this case, since the problem is talking about a figure skater, we can stick with their convention.

So, 2250 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees in terms of direction, so she's facing east.

Wait, just to double-check, 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25, so 6 full rotations and a quarter. So, 6 full rotations don't change the direction, just bring her back to north, and then a quarter is 90 degrees, so she's facing east.

Alternatively, 2250 divided by 90 is 25. So, 25 steps of 90 degrees each. Since each 90 degrees is a quarter turn. So, starting at north, turning right 25 times. But, since 4 turns bring her back, 25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1. So, 6 full spins (24 turns) and 1 more turn, which is 90 degrees, so again, she's facing east.

Wait, maybe that's a more complicated way, but same result.

Alternatively, think of it as directions:

North is 0 degrees,

East is 90 degrees,

South is 180 degrees,

West is 270 degrees.

So, starting at 0 degrees, adding 2250 degrees. Since 360 degrees is a full rotation, we can subtract multiples of 360 to find the equivalent angle.

So, 2250 divided by 360 is 6 with a remainder of 90, as earlier.

So, 2250 degrees is the same as 90 degrees in standard position, so from north, 90 degrees clockwise is east.

Therefore, she's facing east.

Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can visualize the spinning.

If she starts facing north and spins 2250 degrees, which is like spinning around six times (each time 360 degrees) and then a bit more. So, each full spin brings her back to north, so after six full spins, she's back at north. Then, she spins an additional 90 degrees to her right, which would point her to east.

So, yeah, that's consistent.

Alternatively, if I think of her spinning a quarter turn beyond six full turns, which is the same as a quarter turn from north. So, first quarter turn is east, so that's consistent.

Therefore, I think I'm confident that the answer is east.

**Final Answer**
The figure skater is facing \boxed{east} when she finishes her spin.
</think>

The figure skater starts facing north and spins 2250 degrees to her right. To determine her final direction, we need to find the equivalent angle within one full rotation (360 degrees).

First, we calculate the number of full rotations by dividing 2250 by 360:
\[ 2250 \div 360 = 6 \text{ remainder } 90 \]

This means she spins 6 full rotations (2160 degrees) and an additional 90 degrees. Since 6 full rotations do not change her direction, we only need to consider the remaining 90 degrees.

Starting from north, a 90-degree clockwise turn (to her right) brings her to east.

Thus, the figure skater is facing \boxed{east} when she finishes her spin.
