Question:
Let $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ be vectors such that the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is $29^\circ,$ and the angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $84^\circ.$  Find the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}.$

Correct Answer:
Since $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b},$ and $\mathbf{a-b}$ all lie in the same plane, from the diagram below, we see that the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $84^\circ - 29^\circ = \boxed{55^\circ}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this vector problem here, and I need to find the angle between vectors **a** and **a - b**. Let me read the problem again to make sure I have all the details right.

It says that the angle between **a** and **b** is 29 degrees, and the angle between **b** and **a - b** is 84 degrees. Hmm, so I need to figure out the angle between **a** and **a - b**. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I know that the angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product formula. The formula is:

**u** ⋅ **v** = |**u**||**v**|cosθ

Where θ is the angle between vectors **u** and **v**.

So, given that, maybe I can use this formula for each pair of vectors mentioned in the problem.

Let me denote the angle between **a** and **b** as θ₁ = 29°, and the angle between **b** and **a - b** as θ₂ = 84°.

I need to find the angle between **a** and **a - b**, let's call this θ₃.

So, I have three angles related to these vectors: θ₁, θ₂, and θ₃.

I think I can set up equations using the dot product formula for each pair and then solve for the unknowns.

Let's denote |**a**| = a, |**b**| = b, just for simplicity.

First, the angle between **a** and **b** is 29°, so:

**a** ⋅ **b** = |**a**||**b**|cos29°
**a** ⋅ **b** = ab cos29°  ...(1)

Second, the angle between **b** and **a - b** is 84°, so:

**b** ⋅ (**a - b**) = |**b**||**a - b**|cos84°
Let's compute **b** ⋅ (**a - b**):
= **b** ⋅ **a** - **b** ⋅ **b**
= **a** ⋅ **b** - |**b**|²
So,
**a** ⋅ **b** - |**b**|² = |**b**||**a - b**|cos84° ...(2)

And finally, the angle we need to find is between **a** and **a - b**, so:

**a** ⋅ (**a - b**) = |**a**||**a - b**|cosθ₃
Let's compute **a** ⋅ (**a - b**):
= **a** ⋅ **a** - **a** ⋅ **b**
= |**a**|² - **a** ⋅ **b**
So,
|**a**|² - **a** ⋅ **b** = |**a**||**a - b**|cosθ₃ ...(3)

So now, I have three equations: (1), (2), and (3). Let's see how I can use them.

From equation (1): **a** ⋅ **b** = ab cos29°

From equation (2): **a** ⋅ **b** - b² = b |**a - b**| cos84°

So, substituting **a** ⋅ **b** from equation (1) into equation (2):

ab cos29° - b² = b |**a - b**| cos84°

Let me factor out b on the left side:

b(a cos29° - b) = b |**a - b**| cos84°

Since b is a magnitude, it's positive, so we can divide both sides by b:

a cos29° - b = |**a - b**| cos84° ...(4)

Similarly, from equation (3):

|**a**|² - **a** ⋅ **b** = |**a**||**a - b**|cosθ₃

Again, substitute **a** ⋅ **b** from equation (1):

a² - ab cos29° = a |**a - b**| cosθ₃ ...(5)

Now, equation (4) gives us an expression for |**a - b**|. Let's solve equation (4) for |**a - b**|:

From (4):
a cos29° - b = |**a - b**| cos84°
Therefore,
|**a - b**| = (a cos29° - b) / cos84° ...(6)

Now, plug this expression for |**a - b**| into equation (5):

a² - ab cos29° = a * [(a cos29° - b) / cos84°] * cosθ₃

Simplify the right-hand side:

= [a (a cos29° - b) / cos84°] * cosθ₃

So, equation (5) becomes:

a² - ab cos29° = [a (a cos29° - b) / cos84°] * cosθ₃

Let me write this as:

a² - ab cos29° = (a² cos29° - ab) * (cosθ₃ / cos84°)

Hmm, interesting. Let me write it down:

a² - ab cos29° = (a² cos29° - ab) * (cosθ₃ / cos84°)

Let me rearrange this:

Let me denote cosθ₃ as c for simplicity.

So,

a² - ab cos29° = (a² cos29° - ab) * (c / cos84°)

Let me write this as:

a² - ab cos29° = (c / cos84°)(a² cos29° - ab)

Let me factor out a from both sides:

a(a - b cos29°) = (c / cos84°) a (a cos29° - b)

Wait, actually, let me factor a² - ab cos29°:

= a² - ab cos29°
= a(a - b cos29°)

Similarly, the right-hand side:

(a² cos29° - ab) * (c / cos84°)
= a(a cos29° - b) * (c / cos84°)

So, we have:

a(a - b cos29°) = (c / cos84°) a(a cos29° - b)

Since a is non-zero (it's a vector magnitude), we can divide both sides by a:

(a - b cos29°) = (c / cos84°)(a cos29° - b)

Now, notice that (a - b cos29°) and (a cos29° - b) are similar. Let me write:

Let me denote term1 = a - b cos29°
term2 = a cos29° - b

So, term1 = (c / cos84°) term2

Hmm, so term1 = (c / cos84°) term2

But term2 is a cos29° - b, which is similar to term1 but with a cos29°.

Wait, maybe I can express term2 in terms of term1.

Wait, let's compute term1:

term1 = a - b cos29°
term2 = a cos29° - b

So, term1 = a - b cos29°
term2 = a cos29° - b

Hmm, is there a relationship between term1 and term2? Let me see.

If I factor out cos29° from term2:

term2 = cos29° * a - b = a cos29° - b

But term1 is a - b cos29°, which is different.

Hmm, maybe I can write term1 as:

term1 = a - b cos29° = a - (b cos29°)

Similarly, term2 = a cos29° - b = (a cos29°) - b

So, term1 and term2 seem to have similar structures, just with a and b swapped in some sense.

But perhaps I should consider expressing term1 in terms of term2 or vice versa.

Alternatively, let me think about whether term1 and term2 are scalar multiples or something.

Wait, but term1 = (c / cos84°) term2

So, term1 = (c / cos84°) term2

So, term1 / term2 = c / cos84°

So, (a - b cos29°) / (a cos29° - b) = c / cos84°

Where c is cosθ₃.

So,

(a - b cos29°) / (a cos29° - b) = cosθ₃ / cos84°

So, if I can find the ratio (a - b cos29°)/(a cos29° - b), then I can find cosθ₃.

But I need to find the ratio in terms of known quantities.

Wait, but I don't know a or b. So, perhaps I can find a ratio of a to b.

Let me suppose that k = a / b.

Let me denote k = a / b, so a = k b.

This might help me express the ratio in terms of k.

So, substituting a = k b into the ratio:

(a - b cos29°)/(a cos29° - b) = (k b - b cos29°)/(k b cos29° - b)

Factor out b in numerator and denominator:

= b(k - cos29°) / [b(k cos29° - 1)]

Cancel out b:

= (k - cos29°)/(k cos29° - 1)

So, the ratio simplifies to (k - cos29°)/(k cos29° - 1)

Therefore,

(k - cos29°)/(k cos29° - 1) = cosθ₃ / cos84°

So, if I can find k, then I can compute cosθ₃.

So, how do I find k?

Looking back at equation (4):

a cos29° - b = |**a - b**| cos84°

We also have equation (6):

|**a - b**| = (a cos29° - b)/cos84°

But we also have another expression for |**a - b**| from the dot product formula.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps we can compute |**a - b**|² in two ways.

Let me compute |**a - b**|² using the dot product:

|**a - b**|² = (**a - b**) ⋅ (**a - b**) = |**a**|² + |**b**|² - 2 **a** ⋅ **b**

From equation (1), **a** ⋅ **b** = ab cos29°, so:

|**a - b**|² = a² + b² - 2ab cos29° ...(7)

Alternatively, from equation (2), we have:

**b** ⋅ (**a - b**) = |**b**||**a - b**|cos84°
Which we already used to get equation (4). Maybe we can use equation (7) along with equation (2).

Wait, equation (2) is:

**b** ⋅ (**a - b**) = |**b**||**a - b**|cos84°
Which we know is:
**a** ⋅ **b** - |**b**|² = |**b**||**a - b**|cos84°

From equation (1), **a** ⋅ **b** = ab cos29°, so:

ab cos29° - b² = b |**a - b**| cos84°

Divide both sides by b:

a cos29° - b = |**a - b**| cos84°

Which is equation (4). So, from this, |**a - b**| = (a cos29° - b)/cos84°, which is equation (6).

So, maybe we can plug this into equation (7):

|**a - b**|² = a² + b² - 2ab cos29°

But also, |**a - b**|² = [(a cos29° - b)/cos84°]^2

Therefore,

[(a cos29° - b)/cos84°]^2 = a² + b² - 2ab cos29°

Let me write this out:

(a cos29° - b)^2 / (cos84°)^2 = a² + b² - 2ab cos29°

Multiply both sides by (cos84°)^2:

(a cos29° - b)^2 = (a² + b² - 2ab cos29°) (cos84°)^2

Let me expand the left-hand side:

(a cos29° - b)^2 = a² cos²29° - 2ab cos29° + b²

So,

a² cos²29° - 2ab cos29° + b² = (a² + b² - 2ab cos29°) (cos84°)^2

Hmm, so now, I have an equation in terms of a and b. Let me denote k = a / b, as before, so a = k b.

Substituting a = k b into the equation:

Left-hand side:

(k b)^2 cos²29° - 2(k b) b cos29° + b²
= k² b² cos²29° - 2k b² cos29° + b²

Right-hand side:

[(k b)^2 + b² - 2(k b) b cos29°] (cos84°)^2
= [k² b² + b² - 2k b² cos29°] (cos84°)^2
= b² [k² + 1 - 2k cos29°] (cos84°)^2

So, now, let's factor out b² on both sides:

Left-hand side: b²(k² cos²29° - 2k cos29° + 1)

Right-hand side: b² [k² + 1 - 2k cos29°] (cos84°)^2

Since b² is non-zero, we can divide both sides by b²:

k² cos²29° - 2k cos29° + 1 = [k² + 1 - 2k cos29°] (cos84°)^2

Let me write this as:

k² cos²29° - 2k cos29° + 1 = (k² + 1 - 2k cos29°)(cos84°)^2

Now, let's bring everything to one side:

k² cos²29° - 2k cos29° + 1 - (k² + 1 - 2k cos29°)(cos84°)^2 = 0

Let me expand the right-hand term:

= [k² + 1 - 2k cos29°] (cos84°)^2

= k² (cos84°)^2 + (cos84°)^2 - 2k cos29° (cos84°)^2

So, substituting back:

k² cos²29° - 2k cos29° + 1 - [k² (cos84°)^2 + (cos84°)^2 - 2k cos29° (cos84°)^2] = 0

Let me distribute the negative sign:

k² cos²29° - 2k cos29° + 1 - k² (cos84°)^2 - (cos84°)^2 + 2k cos29° (cos84°)^2 = 0

Now, let's group like terms:

Terms with k²:
k² cos²29° - k² (cos84°)^2

Terms with k:
-2k cos29° + 2k cos29° (cos84°)^2

Constant terms:
1 - (cos84°)^2

So, factor these:

k² [cos²29° - (cos84°)^2] + k [-2 cos29° + 2 cos29° (cos84°)^2] + [1 - (cos84°)^2] = 0

Let me factor out common terms:

For k²: [cos²29° - cos²84°]

For k: 2k cos29° [ -1 + (cos84°)^2 ]

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute the k² term:

cos²29° - cos²84°

I recall that cos²θ - cos²φ can be written as (cosθ - cosφ)(cosθ + cosφ), but not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, we can use the identity:

cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2

So,

cos²29° - cos²84° = [ (1 + cos58°)/2 ] - [ (1 + cos168°)/2 ]

= [1 + cos58° - 1 - cos168°] / 2

= [cos58° - cos168°] / 2

Hmm, maybe not super helpful yet.

Second, the k term:

-2 cos29° + 2 cos29° (cos84°)^2 = 2 cos29° [ -1 + (cos84°)^2 ]

Third, the constant term:

1 - (cos84°)^2

So, putting all together:

[cos²29° - cos²84°] k² + 2 cos29° [ -1 + (cos84°)^2 ] k + [1 - (cos84°)^2] = 0

Let me compute the numerical values:

First, compute cos29°, cos84°, and so on.

cos29° ≈ 0.8746

cos84° ≈ 0.1045

So,

cos²29° ≈ (0.8746)^2 ≈ 0.7648

cos²84° ≈ (0.1045)^2 ≈ 0.0109

So,

cos²29° - cos²84° ≈ 0.7648 - 0.0109 ≈ 0.7539

Similarly,

-1 + (cos84°)^2 ≈ -1 + 0.0109 ≈ -0.9891

1 - (cos84°)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0109 ≈ 0.9891

So, substituting these approximate values into the equation:

0.7539 k² + 2 * 0.8746 * (-0.9891) k + 0.9891 = 0

Compute each coefficient:

First term: 0.7539 k²

Second term: 2 * 0.8746 * (-0.9891) ≈ 2 * (-0.865) ≈ -1.73

Third term: 0.9891

So, the equation becomes approximately:

0.7539 k² - 1.73 k + 0.9891 = 0

Let me write this as:

0.7539 k² - 1.73 k + 0.9891 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in k. Let me solve for k using the quadratic formula.

k = [1.73 ± sqrt( (1.73)^2 - 4 * 0.7539 * 0.9891 ) ] / (2 * 0.7539 )

First, compute discriminant D:

D = (1.73)^2 - 4 * 0.7539 * 0.9891

Compute (1.73)^2 ≈ 2.9929

Compute 4 * 0.7539 * 0.9891 ≈ 4 * 0.7455 ≈ 2.982

So,

D ≈ 2.9929 - 2.982 ≈ 0.0109

So, sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(0.0109) ≈ 0.1044

Therefore,

k ≈ [1.73 ± 0.1044] / (2 * 0.7539 )

Compute both possibilities:

First solution:

k ≈ (1.73 + 0.1044) / 1.5078 ≈ 1.8344 / 1.5078 ≈ 1.217

Second solution:

k ≈ (1.73 - 0.1044) / 1.5078 ≈ 1.6256 / 1.5078 ≈ 1.079

So, k ≈ 1.217 or k ≈ 1.079

Hmm, so k = a / b ≈ 1.217 or 1.079

So, a is approximately 1.217 times b or 1.079 times b.

Hmm, so which one is correct? Well, both are positive, so both are possible. Let me see if I can find which one satisfies the original equations.

Alternatively, maybe both are correct, but given the angles, perhaps one is the solution.

Wait, but I think I might have made an approximation earlier on. Let me check if the approximated values can lead to a more accurate k.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the exact expressions without approximating.

Let me try to compute the exact coefficients.

Given:

cos29°, cos84°, exact expressions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write equations symbolically.

Wait, let me go back to the equation:

k² [cos²29° - cos²84°] + 2k cos29° [ -1 + cos²84° ] + [1 - cos²84°] = 0

So, with exact terms.

Let me denote:

A = cos²29° - cos²84°

B = 2 cos29° [ -1 + cos²84° ]

C = 1 - cos²84°

So, equation is A k² + B k + C = 0

We can compute A, B, C exactly.

But perhaps I can express A, B, C in terms of sine and cosine identities.

Note that:

cos²θ - cos²φ = (cosθ - cosφ)(cosθ + cosφ)

So,

A = cos²29° - cos²84° = (cos29° - cos84°)(cos29° + cos84°)

Similarly,

C = 1 - cos²84° = sin²84°

And,

B = 2 cos29° [ -1 + cos²84° ] = 2 cos29° (cos²84° - 1 ) = -2 cos29° sin²84°

So, now, equation becomes:

(cos29° - cos84°)(cos29° + cos84°) k² - 2 cos29° sin²84° k + sin²84° = 0

Hmm, that might be more manageable.

Let me compute each term:

First term: (cos29° - cos84°)(cos29° + cos84°) k²

Second term: -2 cos29° sin²84° k

Third term: sin²84°

Let me compute each coefficient numerically:

cos29° ≈ 0.8746

cos84° ≈ 0.1045

sin84° ≈ 0.9945

So,

First term coefficient:

(cos29° - cos84°)(cos29° + cos84°) ≈ (0.8746 - 0.1045)(0.8746 + 0.1045) ≈ (0.7701)(0.9791) ≈ 0.7539

Second term coefficient:

-2 cos29° sin²84° ≈ -2 * 0.8746 * (0.9945)^2 ≈ -2 * 0.8746 * 0.9890 ≈ -2 * 0.865 ≈ -1.73

Third term:

sin²84° ≈ (0.9945)^2 ≈ 0.9890

So, same as before.

So, the equation is approximately:

0.7539 k² - 1.73 k + 0.9890 = 0

Which leads to the solutions k ≈ 1.217 and k ≈ 1.079

Hmm.

So, given that, perhaps I can take both solutions and see which one makes sense in the context of the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use exact expressions.

Alternatively, maybe I can work with the ratio (a - b cos29°)/(a cos29° - b) which is equal to cosθ₃ / cos84°

So, if I have k = a / b, then:

(k - cos29°)/(k cos29° - 1) = cosθ₃ / cos84°

So, let me compute this ratio for both k ≈ 1.217 and k ≈ 1.079, and see which one gives a reasonable angle.

First, let me compute for k ≈ 1.217:

(k - cos29°)/(k cos29° - 1) ≈ (1.217 - 0.8746)/(1.217 * 0.8746 - 1) ≈ (0.3424)/(1.065 - 1) ≈ 0.3424 / 0.065 ≈ 5.268

So, cosθ₃ / cos84° ≈ 5.268

But cos84° ≈ 0.1045, so cosθ₃ ≈ 5.268 * 0.1045 ≈ 0.55

Which would mean θ₃ ≈ arccos(0.55) ≈ 56.6°

But wait, cosθ cannot be greater than 1, but 5.268 is greater than 1, meaning that cosθ₃ would be greater than 1, which is impossible. Wait, but 5.268 * 0.1045 ≈ 0.55, which is okay.

Wait, no, 5.268 * 0.1045 ≈ 0.55, which is fine, since cosθ₃ ≈ 0.55, which is possible.

Wait, but cosθ₃ cannot be greater than 1, but since 5.268 * 0.1045 ≈ 0.55, which is less than 1, so it's okay.

Similarly, for k ≈ 1.079:

(k - cos29°)/(k cos29° - 1) ≈ (1.079 - 0.8746)/(1.079 * 0.8746 - 1) ≈ (0.2044)/(0.944 - 1) ≈ 0.2044/(-0.056) ≈ -3.65

So, cosθ₃ / cos84° ≈ -3.65

Again, cos84° ≈ 0.1045, so cosθ₃ ≈ -3.65 * 0.1045 ≈ -0.381

Which would mean θ₃ ≈ arccos(-0.381) ≈ 112.5°

So, both solutions give us possible angles: approximately 56.6° and 112.5°, depending on the value of k.

But we need to figure out which one is the correct solution.

Given the problem, the angle between **a** and **a - b** is to be found. Since the angle between two vectors is always between 0° and 180°, both solutions are within this range.

But we need to consider the given angles: 29° and 84°, and see which solution makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the sine formula.

Wait, let me think about the triangle formed by vectors **a**, **b**, and **a - b**.

But actually, in vector terms, **a**, **b**, and **a - b** form a triangle where **a** and **b** are sides, and **a - b** is the third side.

But in reality, it's a triangle with sides |**a**|, |**b**|, and |**a - b**|, but the angles in the triangle relate to the angles between the vectors.

Wait, but in this case, the angles given are between **a** and **b**, and between **b** and **a - b**.

So, perhaps I should consider the triangle with vertices at the origin, tip of **a**, tip of **b**, and tip of **a - b**.

But maybe it's getting too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the angle θ₃ for both cases and see which one makes sense.

Wait, another approach is to note that the angle between **a** and **a - b** must be such that it's supplementary or something with the given angles.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the sine formula in triangle terms.

Wait, let me consider the triangle formed by the vectors **a**, **b**, and **a - b**.

Wait, actually, **a - b** is the vector from tip of **b** to tip of **a**, so in the triangle formed by the tips of **a**, **b**, and the origin.

But maybe using the law of sines or cosines in that triangle.

Wait, let me think.

In the triangle with sides |**a**|, |**b**|, and |**a - b**|, the angles opposite to these sides would be:

- Opposite |**a**|: the angle between **b** and **a - b**, which is 84°, as given.

- Opposite |**b**|: the angle between **a** and **a - b**, which is θ₃, what we need to find.

- Opposite |**a - b**|: the angle between **a** and **b**, which is 29°, as given.

So, in this triangle, we have sides |**a**|, |**b**|, |**a - b**| with opposite angles 84°, θ₃, and 29° respectively.

Therefore, by the law of sines:

|**a**| / sin84° = |**b**| / sinθ₃ = |**a - b**| / sin29°

So, writing ratios:

|**a**| / sin84° = |**b**| / sinθ₃

Which gives:

|**a**| / |**b**| = sin84° / sinθ₃

But from earlier, we have k = |**a**| / |**b**| ≈ 1.217 or 1.079

So,

1.217 ≈ sin84° / sinθ₃

Similarly, 1.079 ≈ sin84° / sinθ₃

So, sinθ₃ ≈ sin84° / k

So,

If k ≈ 1.217,

sinθ₃ ≈ sin84° / 1.217 ≈ 0.9945 / 1.217 ≈ 0.817

So, θ₃ ≈ arcsin(0.817) ≈ 54.8°, which is about 55°, which is close to 56.6°, which I found earlier.

Similarly, for k ≈ 1.079,

sinθ₃ ≈ sin84° / 1.079 ≈ 0.9945 / 1.079 ≈ 0.922

So, θ₃ ≈ arcsin(0.922) ≈ 67.2°, which is a bit off from the previous 112.5°, but wait, 112.5° is in the second quadrant, and sin(112.5°) = sin(180° - 67.5°) = sin67.5° ≈ 0.924, which is close to 0.922.

So, θ₃ ≈ 112.5°, which is consistent.

So, both solutions seem to give reasonable angles.

But which one is correct?

Well, in the triangle, the angle opposite the larger side is larger.

Given that in the triangle, the sides are |**a**|, |**b**|, |**a - b**|.

Given that angle between **a** and **b** is 29°, which is acute, so |**a - b**| would be less than |**a**| + |**b**|, but depending on the vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the two possible triangles.

Wait, in the law of sines, we can have two possible solutions for θ₃: one acute and one obtuse, unless the triangle is uniquely determined.

In our case, the triangle is determined by the vectors, so perhaps only one solution is correct.

Alternatively, maybe we can figure out which one is correct by checking the consistency.

Wait, if θ₃ is 56.6°, then the angle opposite |**a**| is 84°, angle opposite |**b**| is 56.6°, and the third angle is 29°, which adds up to 84 + 56.6 + 29 ≈ 170°, which is not 180°, so that can't be. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, wait, in the triangle, the angles must add up to 180°, so if angle opposite |**a**| is 84°, angle opposite |**b**| is θ₃, and angle opposite |**a - b**| is 29°, so 84 + θ₃ + 29 = 180.

Therefore, 84 + 29 + θ₃ = 180

So, 113 + θ₃ = 180

Therefore, θ₃ = 67°, approximately.

So, the angle θ₃ is 67°, which is consistent with the sine calculation.

Wait, so let me recast.

In the triangle, with sides |**a**|, |**b**|, |**a - b**|, the angles opposite these sides are 84°, θ₃, and 29°, respectively.

Therefore, the sum of angles is 84 + θ₃ + 29 = 180.

Thus,

θ₃ = 180 - 84 - 29 = 67°

So, θ₃ = 67°, exactly.

Wait, so maybe I was overcomplicating with k. So, in reality, in the triangle, the angles add up to 180°, so θ₃ must be 67°, which is exactly 180 - 84 - 29 = 67°.

Therefore, θ₃ = 67°, so the angle between **a** and **a - b** is 67 degrees.

Wait, so perhaps I don't need to go through the quadratic equation. Because in the triangle, the angles must add up to 180°, so given two angles, the third is fixed.

So, the angle between **a** and **a - b** is 180° - 84° - 29° = 67°, so θ₃ = 67°, which is 67 degrees.

But let me verify this with the earlier approach.

Earlier, using the law of sines, I had θ₃ ≈ 67.2°, which is close to 67°, so that is consistent.

So, the angle is 67°, which is the answer.

But let me just ensure that in the quadratic equation, I found k ≈ 1.217 and 1.079, but in reality, since the triangle is fixed by the angles, perhaps we don't need to use the quadratic equation.

Alternatively, perhaps this approach is more straightforward.

So, in conclusion, the angle between **a** and **a - b** is 67°, so 67 degrees.

Wait, but I thought the angle between two vectors is always acute or obtuse, but in this case, it's 67°, which is acute, but given that the angle between **b** and **a - b** is 84°, which is obtuse, so perhaps the triangle can accommodate an acute and an obtuse angle.

Wait, but in the triangle, two angles can't both be greater than 90°, because the sum would exceed 180°. So, in this case, one angle is 84°, which is obtuse, and the other is 29°, which is acute, so the third angle must be 67°, which is also acute.

So, that makes sense.

Therefore, despite the earlier confusion with k, using the triangle approach gives us a clear answer of 67°, which is 67 degrees.

So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $\boxed{67^\circ}$.
</think>

Given the problem, we need to find the angle between vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\). The angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(29^\circ\), and the angle between \(\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is \(84^\circ\).

We start by noting that the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) can be found by considering the triangle formed by the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\). In this triangle, the sides are the magnitudes of the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\), and the angles opposite these sides are the angles between the vectors.

Using the law of sines, we know that the sum of the angles in a triangle must be \(180^\circ\). Given the angles between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(29^\circ\) and the angle between \(\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is \(84^\circ\), we can find the third angle, which is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\).

Thus, the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is calculated as follows:
\[
180^\circ - 84^\circ - 29^\circ = 67^\circ
\]

Therefore, the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{67^\circ}\).
