Question:
Let $ABCD$ be a regular tetrahedron with side length 2. The plane parallel to edges $AB$ and $CD$ and lying halfway between them cuts $ABCD$ into two pieces. Find the surface area of one of these pieces.

Correct Answer:
The plane intersects each face of the tetrahedron in a midline of the face; by symmetry it follows that the intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron is a square of side length 1. The surface area of each piece is half the total surface area of the tetrahedron plus the area of the square, that is, $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 4\cdot \frac{2^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}+1=\boxed{1+2\sqrt{3}}$.

Gold:
1+2\sqrt{3}

Wrong Prediction:
1+\sqrt{3}

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem about a regular tetrahedron, ABCD, with side length 2. The question is about cutting it with a plane that's parallel to edges AB and CD and lies halfway between them. I need to find the surface area of one of the resulting pieces.

First, let me recall what a regular tetrahedron is. It's a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal in length, so in this case, each edge is 2 units long.

I need to visualize how the plane is cutting the tetrahedron. The plane is parallel to edges AB and CD and is halfway between them. So, AB and CD are skew lines in the tetrahedron because they don't intersect and aren't parallel. A plane that's parallel to both of these lines will intersect the tetrahedron in some way.

Since it's halfway between AB and CD, the plane must intersect the other edges of the tetrahedron, specifically edges AC, AD, BC, and BD. When the plane cuts through these edges, it will create a cross-section. I think this cross-section is going to be a quadrilateral since it intersects four edges.

To better understand the shape, maybe I should assign coordinates to the vertices of the tetrahedron. Coordinates might help me figure out where exactly the plane intersects the edges.

Let me choose a coordinate system where point A is at (0, 0, 0), point B is at (2, 0, 0). Since it's a regular tetrahedron, points C and D need to be placed such that all edges are of length 2.

In a regular tetrahedron, the distance from any vertex to the centroid is the same. The centroid can be found by averaging the coordinates of all four vertices. But maybe it's easier to place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system where calculations are simpler.

I recall that one way to place a regular tetrahedron is to have one vertex at the origin, another along the x-axis, the third in the xy-plane, and the fourth somewhere in 3D space. So, let's define the coordinates:

Let’s set A at (0, 0, 0). Point B can be at (2, 0, 0). Now, point C should be in the xy-plane such that AC = AB = 2 and BC = 2.

Wait, that might not be straightforward. Let me think about the positions. In a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal, so the distance from A to B, A to C, A to D, B to C, B to D, and C to D are all 2.

To place point C, since it's in the xy-plane, let's calculate its coordinates. The distance from A (0,0,0) to C (x,y,0) should be 2, so sqrt(x² + y²) = 2. Similarly, the distance from B (2,0,0) to C (x,y,0) should also be 2, so sqrt((x-2)² + y²) = 2.

So, setting up the equations:

1. x² + y² = 4
2. (x - 2)² + y² = 4

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

(x - 2)² + y² - x² - y² = 4 - 4  
Expanding (x - 2)²: x² - 4x + 4 + y² - x² - y² = 0  
Simplifies to: -4x + 4 = 0  
So, -4x = -4 => x = 1

Substituting x = 1 into equation 1:

1² + y² = 4 => y² = 3 => y = sqrt(3) or y = -sqrt(3). Let's take y = sqrt(3) for simplicity.

So, point C is at (1, sqrt(3), 0). Now, we need to find the coordinates of point D, which is the fourth vertex above the xy-plane.

In a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal, so the distance from D to A, B, and C must be 2. Let’s denote D as (p, q, r). Since it's a regular tetrahedron, the distance from D to each of A, B, and C is 2.

But also, the centroid of the base triangle ABC is at the average of A, B, and C:

Centroid G = ((0 + 2 + 1)/3, (0 + 0 + sqrt(3))/3, 0) = (1, sqrt(3)/3, 0)

In a regular tetrahedron, the height from the base to the apex D can be found using the formula for the height of a regular tetrahedron. The height h is sqrt(2/3) times the edge length.

Wait, let me recall the height formula. For a regular tetrahedron with edge length a, the height is sqrt(6)/3 * a. So, with a=2, the height is sqrt(6)/3 * 2 = 2sqrt(6)/3.

So, point D is directly above the centroid G at a height of 2sqrt(6)/3. Therefore, the coordinates of D should be (1, sqrt(3)/3, 2sqrt(6)/3).

Let me verify the distance from D to A:

Distance from (1, sqrt(3)/3, 2sqrt(6)/3) to (0,0,0):

sqrt((1)^2 + (sqrt(3)/3)^2 + (2sqrt(6)/3)^2)  
= sqrt(1 + (3/9) + (24/9))  
= sqrt(1 + 1/3 + 8/3)  
= sqrt(1 + 9/3)  
= sqrt(1 + 3)  
= sqrt(4)  
= 2. Perfect.

Similarly, distance from D to B is 2 as well, and to C as well. So, coordinates seem correct.

So, to recap, the coordinates are:

A: (0, 0, 0)

B: (2, 0, 0)

C: (1, sqrt(3), 0)

D: (1, sqrt(3)/3, 2sqrt(6)/3)

Now, the plane is parallel to edges AB and CD and lies halfway between them.

First, let me figure out what this plane looks like.

Since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, and halfway between them, it should intersect the tetrahedron in a quadrilateral. The edges it intersects are the ones that connect edges AB and CD.

In a regular tetrahedron, each edge is connected to the others. So, edges AC, AD, BC, and BD connect the vertices of AB to those of CD.

Therefore, the plane will intersect edges AC, AD, BC, and BD, each at some point.

Given that it's halfway between AB and CD, the plane should be equidistant from AB and CD.

So, if I can find the midpoints of edges AC, AD, BC, and BD, those points should lie on the plane.

Wait, is that necessarily true? If the plane is halfway between AB and CD, then the distance from the plane to AB is equal to the distance from the plane to CD.

But since AB and CD are skew lines, the plane being halfway between them would pass through the midpoints of the segments connecting AB and CD.

So, perhaps the plane contains the midpoints of AC, AD, BC, and BD.

Let me check.

Take edge AC: from A(0,0,0) to C(1, sqrt(3), 0). The midpoint is ((0+1)/2, (0 + sqrt(3))/2, (0+0)/2) = (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0).

Similarly, edge AD: from A(0,0,0) to D(1, sqrt(3)/3, 2sqrt(6)/3). Midpoint is ((0+1)/2, (0 + sqrt(3)/3)/2, (0 + 2sqrt(6)/3)/2) = (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3).

Edge BC: from B(2,0,0) to C(1, sqrt(3), 0). Midpoint is ((2+1)/2, (0 + sqrt(3))/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0).

Edge BD: from B(2,0,0) to D(1, sqrt(3)/3, 2sqrt(6)/3). Midpoint is ((2 + 1)/2, (0 + sqrt(3)/3)/2, (0 + 2sqrt(6)/3)/2) = (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3).

So, the midpoints are (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0), (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3), (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0), and (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3).

These four points should lie on the cutting plane.

Now, let me find the equation of the plane passing through these four midpoints.

Since the plane is parallel to edges AB and CD, it must have the same direction vectors as AB and CD.

Vector AB is from A to B: (2, 0, 0).

Vector CD is from C to D: (1 - 1, sqrt(3)/3 - sqrt(3), 2sqrt(6)/3 - 0) = (0, -2sqrt(3)/3, 2sqrt(6)/3).

So, the plane is parallel to vectors AB and CD.

Given that the plane contains four midpoints, I can find its equation.

Alternatively, since I have four points on the plane, I can find the equation by using three points and then verifying with the fourth.

Let me take points:

P1: (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

P2: (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

P3: (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

P4: (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

First, let's find vectors on the plane.

Compute vectors P1P2 and P1P3.

Vector P1P2: (0.5 - 0.5, sqrt(3)/6 - sqrt(3)/2, sqrt(6)/3 - 0) = (0, (-sqrt(3)/3), sqrt(6)/3)

Vector P1P3: (1.5 - 0.5, sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2, 0 - 0) = (1, 0, 0)

Wait, that's a helpful vector. So, vector P1P3 is (1, 0, 0), which is the same as vector AB, which makes sense since the plane is parallel to AB.

Now, to find the normal vector of the plane, I can take the cross product of vectors P1P2 and P1P3.

Let me compute that.

Vector P1P2: (0, -sqrt(3)/3, sqrt(6)/3)

Vector P1P3: (1, 0, 0)

Cross product:

|i     j         k     |
|0  -sqrt(3)/3 sqrt(6)/3|
|1     0         0     |

= i * [(-sqrt(3)/3)(0) - (sqrt(6)/3)(0)] - j * [0*0 - (sqrt(6)/3)(1)] + k * [0*0 - (-sqrt(3)/3)(1)]

Simplify:

i * [0 - 0] - j * [0 - sqrt(6)/3] + k * [0 + sqrt(3)/3]

= 0i + (sqrt(6)/3)j + (sqrt(3)/3)k

So, the normal vector n is (0, sqrt(6)/3, sqrt(3)/3)

We can write the plane equation as:

0(x - x0) + (sqrt(6)/3)(y - y0) + (sqrt(3)/3)(z - z0) = 0

Using point P1 (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0) to substitute:

0*(x - 0.5) + (sqrt(6)/3)(y - sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/3)(z - 0) = 0

Simplify:

(sqrt(6)/3)(y - sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/3)z = 0

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:

sqrt(6)(y - sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3) z = 0

Expand:

sqrt(6) y - sqrt(6)*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3) z = 0

Simplify sqrt(6)*sqrt(3) = sqrt(18) = 3sqrt(2), so:

sqrt(6) y - (3sqrt(2))/2 + sqrt(3) z = 0

Rearranged:

sqrt(6) y + sqrt(3) z = (3sqrt(2))/2

That's the equation of the plane.

Alternatively, I could write it as:

sqrt(6) y + sqrt(3) z = (3sqrt(2))/2

Let me verify if point P3 (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0) lies on this plane.

Compute sqrt(6)*(sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)*0 = sqrt(18)/2 = (3sqrt(2))/2, which equals the right-hand side. So, correct.

Similarly, check point P2: (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

Compute sqrt(6)*(sqrt(3)/6) + sqrt(3)*(sqrt(6)/3)

= sqrt(18)/6 + sqrt(18)/3

= (3sqrt(2))/6 + (3sqrt(2))/3

= (sqrt(2)/2) + sqrt(2)

= (sqrt(2)/2 + 2sqrt(2)/2) = 3sqrt(2)/2, correct.

Same with P4: (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

Compute sqrt(6)*(sqrt(3)/6) + sqrt(3)*(sqrt(6)/3)

Same as above, 3sqrt(2)/2.

So, all four points lie on the plane.

So, now, I need to find the surface area of one of the two pieces created by this plane.

The original tetrahedron has four triangular faces, each with area (sqrt(3)/4)*(edge length)^2. Since edge length is 2, each face has area (sqrt(3)/4)*4 = sqrt(3). So, total surface area of the tetrahedron is 4*sqrt(3).

But after cutting, each piece will have some original faces and some new faces from the cut.

I need to figure out the shape of each piece. Since the plane is cutting through four edges, each piece will have a quadrilateral face where the plane cuts through, and the rest of their faces will be triangular.

But wait, actually, the original tetrahedron has four triangular faces. When I cut it with a plane, the intersection is a quadrilateral. So, each piece will have some combination of original triangular faces and the new quadrilateral face.

But how exactly does the cut divide the tetrahedron?

I think each piece will have three original triangular faces and the new quadrilateral face. But I'm not sure. Wait, actually, each original face of the tetrahedron is a triangle. The cutting plane intersects the tetrahedron in four points, so each piece will have a new face, which is a quadrilateral, and the other faces will be parts of the original tetrahedron's faces.

But in reality, each original triangular face is being cut by the plane in some way. Let me think.

Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle. The cutting plane intersects each edge of the tetrahedron once, except for the edges along AB and CD, which are not intersected since the plane is parallel to them.

Wait, actually, the plane is parallel to AB and CD, so it doesn't intersect those edges. It only intersects the other four edges: AC, AD, BC, and BD.

Therefore, each face that contains AB or CD will not be intersected by the plane, but the other faces will be intersected.

Wait, hold on. Each face is a triangle.

Faces:

1. ABC: contains AB and AC and BC

2. ABD: contains AB and AD and BD

3. ACD: contains AC and AD and CD

4. BCD: contains BC and BD and CD

So, the plane is parallel to AB and CD, so it doesn't intersect the faces that contain AB or CD.

Thus, the plane doesn't intersect faces ABC, ABD, ACD, and BCD? Wait, no.

Wait, the plane is parallel to AB and CD. So, it doesn't intersect AB or CD, but intersects the other edges.

So, the plane intersects edges AC, AD, BC, and BD, each at their midpoints, as we found earlier.

Therefore, the plane intersects four edges, so each of the four faces that contain these edges will be intersected.

Wait, each face is a triangle.

Face ABC: contains edges AB, BC, AC.

Since the plane is parallel to AB, it doesn't intersect AB, and it does intersect AC and BC at their midpoints.

So, in face ABC, the plane cuts AC and BC at their midpoints, so the intersection is a line segment connecting midpoints of AC and BC.

Similarly, in face ABD: contains edges AB, BD, AD.

Plane is parallel to AB, so doesn't intersect AB, but intersects AD and BD at their midpoints, so intersection is a line segment connecting midpoints of AD and BD.

Face ACD: contains edges AC, CD, AD.

Plane is parallel to CD, so doesn't intersect CD, but intersects AC and AD at their midpoints.

So, intersection is a line segment connecting midpoints of AC and AD.

Similarly, face BCD: contains edges BC, CD, BD.

Plane is parallel to CD, so doesn't intersect CD, but intersects BC and BD at their midpoints. So, intersection is a line segment connecting midpoints of BC and BD.

Therefore, the plane cuts each of the four faces, creating four new edges: connecting midpoints of AC and BC, midpoints of AD and BD, midpoints of AC and AD, and midpoints of BC and BD.

Therefore, each face is cut into a smaller triangle and a quadrilateral? Wait, no.

Wait, in face ABC, the plane cuts AC and BC at midpoints, so it creates a smaller triangle (connecting midpoints) and a quadrilateral? Wait, no, in face ABC, the plane cuts two edges at midpoints, so the intersection is a line segment connecting those midpoints, so it divides face ABC into two smaller triangles: one at the top (midpoint triangle) and one trapezoidal shape at the bottom.

Similarly, in face ABD, the plane cuts two edges at midpoints, so it divides ABD into two parts: a smaller triangle at the top and a trapezoid.

In faces ACD and BCD, the plane cuts two edges at midpoints, so each face is divided into a smaller triangle and a trapezoid.

Wait, so each of the four original faces is divided into two parts: a smaller triangle and a trapezoid. But the cutting plane is also creating a new face, which is a quadrilateral, where all four midpoints are connected.

Wait, actually, the intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron is a quadrilateral, which is the new face. So, each of the two pieces will have this quadrilateral as one of their faces, in addition to parts of the original faces.

Therefore, each piece will have:

- The quadrilateral face.

- Parts of three original triangular faces.

But wait, in the original tetrahedron, each face is a triangle, and the cutting plane cuts each face into two parts. So, each piece will have a portion of three original faces plus the new quadrilateral face, but actually, each original face is only intersected once, so each piece will have half of each intersected face.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about how many original faces each piece has.

Since the plane cuts through four edges, each of the four faces is intersected once, but each intersection is a line segment on the face. So, each piece will have parts of three original faces and the new quadrilateral.

Wait, no. Each piece will have a portion of four original faces? But the original tetrahedron only has four faces.

Wait, perhaps each piece has three original faces and the new quadrilateral.

Wait, let me think differently.

Imagine the plane cutting the tetrahedron into two parts. Each part is a polyhedron. One part will be a smaller polyhedron with four faces: the quadrilateral and three original triangular faces. The other part will be another polyhedron with four faces: the quadrilateral and the other three original triangular faces.

Wait, but each original face is being cut, so each original face is split into two parts. So, each piece will have some of these parts.

But actually, each original triangular face is divided by the plane into two smaller polygons. Each piece will have some combination of these.

Wait, perhaps each piece will have three of the original triangular faces and the new quadrilateral face.

But in reality, each face is split by the plane, so each piece will have half of each face. But since the plane is cutting four edges, each face is split into two parts.

Wait, maybe the two pieces are both polyhedrons with five faces each: three original triangular faces, the new quadrilateral, and another face.

Wait, no. Maybe one of them is a smaller tetrahedron and the other is a larger polyhedron.

Wait, but if the cutting plane is parallel to two edges, and cuts the other four edges at midpoints, is the resulting shape a smaller tetrahedron?

Wait, no, because in a regular tetrahedron, if you cut through midpoints of edges not connected to a vertex, you might get a smaller polyhedron.

Wait, actually, cutting through midpoints of four edges that form a quadrilateral, which is the intersection.

Wait, perhaps each piece is a kind of frustum-like shape, but in three dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe each piece is a pyramid with a quadrilateral base.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the number of faces each piece has.

Each original face is split into two parts, so each piece will have parts of four original faces, but since the cutting plane is a single face, each piece will have one quadrilateral face and the rest will be triangular.

Wait, perhaps each piece has four faces: the quadrilateral and three triangles.

Wait, that seems plausible.

So, each piece is a kind of pyramid with a quadrilateral base and three triangular sides.

But how can that be?

Wait, actually, each piece will have the quadrilateral as one face, and then for the other faces, each of the original triangular faces that were intersected by the cutting plane will contribute a triangular face.

But since the plane intersects four edges, each original face is intersected once, so each original face is split into two. Therefore, each piece will have parts of four original faces, but in reality, the two pieces will share the cutting plane as their common face.

Wait, so each piece will have:

- The quadrilateral face (the cutting plane).

- Three original triangular faces, each intersected by the plane.

Wait, but the original tetrahedron only has four triangular faces. If each piece is taking parts of all four faces, but the original faces are split between the two pieces.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each piece is a kind of pyramid with a quadrilateral base. So, each piece would have five faces: four triangular faces and one quadrilateral.

But in a tetrahedron, each face is a triangle, so after cutting, each piece should have four faces: three original triangles and the quadrilateral.

Wait, but that would mean each piece has four faces, so the surface area would be the sum of the areas of these four faces.

But the original surface area is four triangles each of area sqrt(3). So, each piece would have three original triangles and a quadrilateral, but I need to calculate the areas.

Alternatively, perhaps both pieces have the same surface area, so I can compute the surface area of one piece and double it, but in this case, the question is about one of the pieces, so I need to compute it.

Wait, let me think step by step.

First, the original surface area is 4*sqrt(3). After cutting, the two pieces will have a combined surface area equal to the original surface area plus twice the area of the cutting plane (since each piece now has the cutting plane as a face). So, the total surface area would be 4*sqrt(3) + 2*(area of cutting plane).

But the question is asking for the surface area of one of the pieces, not the total.

So, to find that, I need to compute the areas of all the faces of one piece.

Each piece will have:

1. The quadrilateral face from the cutting plane.

2. Portions of the original four faces of the tetrahedron.

But since the plane intersects four edges, each original face is split into two parts. So, each piece will have parts of four original faces.

But wait, the original tetrahedron has four triangular faces. The cutting plane intersects four edges, each of which is shared by two faces. So, each face is intersected once, meaning each face is split into two parts.

Therefore, each piece will have half of each original face, but since each face is split, each piece will have parts of four original triangular faces. But since each face is split, the total surface area of the two pieces will be the original surface area plus twice the area of the cutting plane.

Wait, but the question is about the surface area of one piece. So, that piece will have:

- The quadrilateral face from the cutting plane.

- Portions of three original triangular faces.

Wait, no. Each piece will have the quadrilateral face and three original triangular faces, each split into two. So, actually, each piece will have four faces: three original faces (each split into a triangle and a quadrilateral) and the cutting plane.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think differently.

Each original face is split into two parts by the cutting plane. So, each piece will have, for each original face, either the portion of the face on one side of the cutting plane. Since the plane is halfway, each piece will have half of each original face.

But since each original face is a triangle, the portion on one side of the cutting plane will be a smaller triangle.

Wait, but in reality, the cutting plane doesn't go through the centroid but is halfway between two edges.

Wait, no, in this case, the plane is cutting through four edges at their midpoints, so each original face is being split into two smaller triangles.

Wait, for example, face ABC is being split into two smaller triangles: one is the triangle with vertices at midpoints of AB, AC, and BC, but we don't have a midpoint of AB because the plane is parallel to AB.

Wait, in face ABC, the plane intersects AC and BC at their midpoints, so it creates a smaller triangle within ABC, with vertices at midpoints of AC, BC, and the midpoint of AB? Wait, no, because the plane is parallel to AB, so doesn't intersect AB.

Wait, perhaps in face ABC, the plane intersects AC and BC at midpoints, so it creates a line segment connecting midpoints of AC and BC, which is parallel to AB.

Therefore, in face ABC, the area above the cutting line is a smaller triangle similar to ABC but scaled down.

Similarly, the area below is a trapezoid.

But in reality, since the plane is at the midpoint, the smaller triangle in face ABC would be similar with a scaling factor of 1/2, so its area would be (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the original face area.

But wait, ABC has area sqrt(3). So, the smaller triangle would have area sqrt(3)/4, and the trapezoid would have area sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)/4 = 3sqrt(3)/4.

But in our case, the cutting plane is not going through the centroid, but is halfway between AB and CD. So, is the scaling factor 1/2?

Wait, maybe not. Because the plane is parallel to AB and CD, which are skew lines, so the distance between the plane and each of AB and CD is equal.

But in terms of the cross-section, the scaling factor depends on the distance from the plane to the edges.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the area of the cutting plane.

Earlier, I found the equation of the cutting plane as sqrt(6) y + sqrt(3) z = (3sqrt(2))/2.

Perhaps I can find the coordinates of the quadrilateral and compute its area.

The four midpoints are:

P1: (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

P2: (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

P3: (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

P4: (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

These four points form a quadrilateral.

I can compute the area of this quadrilateral.

First, let's note that the quadrilateral is a trapezoid because the sides P1P2 and P3P4 are both vertical? Wait, not exactly, but let me check.

Looking at the coordinates:

P1: (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

P2: (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

P3: (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

P4: (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

Notice that P1 and P3 have the same y and z coordinates, but different x. Wait, no, P1 and P3 have same y and z, but different x.

Wait, actually, P1 and P3 lie on the line x = 0.5 and x = 1.5 respectively, but same y and z?

Wait, no, P1 is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0), P3 is (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0). So, P1 and P3 have the same y and z, but different x. Similarly, P2 and P4 have same y and z, but different x.

Wait, no, P2 is (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3), P4 is (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3). So, P1 and P3 are at (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0) and (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0). Similarly, P2 and P4 are at (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3) and (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3).

Therefore, quadrilateral P1P2P3P4 has two sides:

P1P2 and P3P4, which connect (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0) to (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3) and (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0) to (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3), respectively.

And the other two sides are P2P3 and P1P4.

Wait, no, actually, the quadrilateral is P1-P2-P3-P4-P1.

Wait, let's plot the points in order:

P1: (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

P2: (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

P3: (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

P4: (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

So, connecting P1-P2-P3-P4-P1.

Looking at this, P1-P2 is a vertical line? Wait, no, because in 3D, moving from P1 to P2, the x remains the same, y decreases, and z increases.

Similarly, moving from P2 to P3, x increases, y increases, z decreases.

Similarly, from P3 to P4, x increases, y decreases, z increases.

From P4 to P1, x decreases, y increases, z decreases.

This seems like a skew quadrilateral, not a planar one? Wait, but all four points lie on the cutting plane, so it must be planar.

Wait, but in 3D, a quadrilateral lying on a plane can be a trapezoid, parallelogram, etc., depending on the connections.

Wait, maybe it's a parallelogram? Let me check.

If the sides P1P2 and P3P4 are equal and parallel, and sides P2P3 and P4P1 are equal and parallel, then it's a parallelogram.

Compute vectors P1P2 and P3P4.

Vector P1P2: (0.5 - 0.5, sqrt(3)/6 - sqrt(3)/2, sqrt(6)/3 - 0) = (0, (-sqrt(3)/3), sqrt(6)/3)

Vector P3P4: (1.5 - 1.5, sqrt(3)/6 - sqrt(3)/2, sqrt(6)/3 - 0) = (0, (-sqrt(3)/3), sqrt(6)/3)

So, vectors P1P2 and P3P4 are equal. Therefore, sides P1P2 and P3P4 are equal and parallel.

Now, check vectors P2P3 and P4P1.

Vector P2P3: (1.5 - 0.5, sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/6, 0 - sqrt(6)/3) = (1, (sqrt(3)/3), (-sqrt(6)/3))

Vector P4P1: (0.5 - 1.5, sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/6, 0 - sqrt(6)/3) = (-1, (sqrt(3)/3), (-sqrt(6)/3))

So, vectors P2P3 and P4P1 are negatives of each other, meaning they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Therefore, sides P2P3 and P4P1 are equal and parallel.

Therefore, the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

Therefore, the area of the cutting plane is equal to the magnitude of the cross product of two adjacent sides.

Compute the area of the parallelogram.

Take vectors P1P2 and P1P4.

Wait, but since it's a parallelogram, the area can be found by the magnitude of the cross product of two adjacent vectors.

Let me take vectors P1P2 and P1P4.

Wait, vector P1P2 is (0, -sqrt(3)/3, sqrt(6)/3)

Vector P1P4: (1.5 - 0.5, sqrt(3)/6 - sqrt(3)/2, sqrt(6)/3 - 0) = (1, (-sqrt(3)/3), sqrt(6)/3)

So, cross product of P1P2 and P1P4.

Compute:

|i     j         k     |

|0  -sqrt(3)/3 sqrt(6)/3|

|1 -sqrt(3)/3 sqrt(6)/3|

= i * [ (-sqrt(3)/3)(sqrt(6)/3) - (sqrt(6)/3)(-sqrt(3)/3) ] - j * [0*(sqrt(6)/3) - (sqrt(6)/3)*1] + k * [0*(-sqrt(3)/3) - (-sqrt(3)/3)*1]

Simplify each component:

i: [ (-sqrt(3)*sqrt(6))/9 + (sqrt(3)*sqrt(6))/9 ] = 0

j: - [ 0 - sqrt(6)/3 ] = - [ -sqrt(6)/3 ] = sqrt(6)/3

k: [ 0 + sqrt(3)/3 ] = sqrt(3)/3

So, the cross product is (0, sqrt(6)/3, sqrt(3)/3)

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt( (sqrt(6)/3)^2 + (sqrt(3)/3)^2 ) = sqrt( (6/9) + (3/9) ) = sqrt(9/9) = sqrt(1) = 1.

Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is 1.

So, the area of the cutting plane is 1.

Therefore, each piece has a quadrilateral face with area 1.

Now, I need to compute the total surface area of one piece.

Each piece has:

1. The quadrilateral face (area = 1)

2. Portions of the original four triangular faces.

Each original triangular face is split into two parts by the cutting plane.

Each original face has area sqrt(3). After cutting, each piece will have a portion of each face.

But how much area does each piece have from each original face?

Since the cutting plane is cutting each original face at midpoints, each original face is split into a smaller triangle and a quadrilateral.

But since the cutting plane is equidistant from AB and CD, perhaps the area on each face is divided equally.

Wait, in the case of face ABC, which is split by the cutting plane at midpoints P1 and P3, the area above the cutting line is a smaller triangle, and the area below is a trapezoid.

But since the cutting plane is at the midpoint, the area above is a quarter of the original face? Wait, no, because when you cut a triangle at the midpoint of two sides, the smaller triangle is similar with scale factor 1/2, so area is 1/4 of the original.

But in this case, the cutting plane is not cutting a triangle from ABC, but cutting across AC and BC at their midpoints.

Therefore, the area above the cutting plane in face ABC is actually a triangle with vertices at midpoints of AC, BC, and AB? Wait, no, because the plane is parallel to AB, so it doesn't intersect AB.

Wait, in face ABC, the plane intersects AC and BC at their midpoints, so the intersection is a line segment connecting midpoints of AC and BC. Therefore, in face ABC, the area above the cutting plane is a smaller triangle with vertices at midpoint of AC, midpoint of BC, and the midpoint of AB? Wait, but the plane doesn't intersect AB.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

In face ABC, the plane cuts AC and BC at their midpoints, so the area above the cutting plane is a triangle with vertices at midpoints of AC, BC, and a point on AB. But since the plane doesn't intersect AB, it's not part of the face.

Wait, maybe it's a trapezoid.

Wait, no, in face ABC, the plane cuts AC and BC at midpoints, so the area above the cutting plane is a triangle with vertices at midpoints of AC, BC, and the point where the plane meets AB. But since the plane doesn't intersect AB, that point doesn't exist.

Therefore, in face ABC, the area above the cutting plane is a triangle with vertices at midpoints of AC and BC, and the centroid of ABC.

Wait, but since the cutting plane is parallel to AB, the intersection is a line segment, so the area above is a triangle similar to ABC but scaled.

Wait, perhaps it's a smaller triangle with 1/2 the height.

Wait, in face ABC, the original height from A to BC is h = sqrt(3), because ABC is an equilateral triangle with side 2, so height is sqrt(3).

The cutting plane is halfway between AB and CD, but in face ABC, the height from the cutting plane to AB would be half of the total height, so sqrt(3)/2.

Therefore, the area above the cutting plane would be a triangle with height sqrt(3)/2, so area is (1/2)*base*(sqrt(3)/2). The base in this case is the segment connecting midpoints of AC and BC, which is parallel to AB and has length 1 (since AB is 2 and it's cut at midpoints).

Wait, in face ABC, the line connecting midpoints of AC and BC is the midline of the triangle, which is parallel to AB and half its length, so length 1.

Therefore, the area above the cutting plane is a triangle with base 1 and height sqrt(3)/2, so area is (1/2)*1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4.

Similarly, the area below the cutting plane in face ABC is the trapezoid, which has area sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)/4 = 3sqrt(3)/4.

But in reality, since the plane is cutting through the tetrahedron, both pieces will have parts of all four original faces.

Since each piece will have half of each original face, but actually, each original face is split into two, so each piece will have a part of four original faces.

But this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps instead of computing each face, I can compute the surface area contributed by the new face and the original faces.

Each piece has:

- One quadrilateral face: area 1.

- Three original triangular faces, each split into two parts by the cutting plane.

But since each face is split, each piece will have half of each face.

But wait, if each original face is split into two equal areas, then each piece will have half of each face.

But the original surface area is 4*sqrt(3). So, each piece would have:

- Half of each original face: 4*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2sqrt(3)

Plus the new face: 1

So, total surface area: 2sqrt(3) + 1

But this contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, let me think again.

Each original face is split into two parts by the cutting plane. Each piece will have one part of each original face. So, each piece will have four parts, each from a different original face.

But each original face is split into two, so each piece will have half of each original face.

Wait, but that would mean each piece has 4*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2sqrt(3) from the original faces, plus the area of the new face, which is 1.

Therefore, total surface area would be 2sqrt(3) + 1.

But wait, the original surface area was 4sqrt(3), and the total surface area after cutting is 4sqrt(3) + 2*1 = 4sqrt(3) + 2, since each piece has the new face.

But each piece has half of the new face, so total new face area is 2*1 = 2.

Therefore, each piece has 2sqrt(3) (from original faces) + 1 (from new face) = 2sqrt(3) + 1.

Wait, but let's verify.

If each original face is split into two, each piece has half of each original face, so each piece's original face contribution is 4*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2sqrt(3).

Each piece also has the new face, which is a quadrilateral with area 1.

Therefore, total surface area is 2sqrt(3) + 1.

But let me verify this.

Alternatively, I can compute the areas of each face of one piece.

So, for one piece, say, the piece containing vertex A.

This piece will have:

1. The original face ABC, but only the portion above the cutting plane, which is a triangle with area sqrt(3)/4.

2. The original face ABD, split by the cutting plane into a triangle above with area sqrt(3)/4.

3. The original face ACD, but this face is not intersected by the cutting plane because the plane is parallel to CD, so this face remains intact? Wait, no, face ACD is intersected by the cutting plane at midpoints of AC and AD.

Wait, yes, face ACD is intersected by the cutting plane at midpoints of AC and AD, so it's split into two parts.

So, the piece containing A will have:

- The original face ABC above the cutting plane: area sqrt(3)/4.

- The original face ABD above the cutting plane: area sqrt(3)/4.

- The original face ACD above the cutting plane: which is a triangle with area sqrt(3)/4.

- The cutting plane: the quadrilateral with area 1.

Wait, but that's four faces, each with area sqrt(3)/4 and 1.

But that sums to 3*(sqrt(3)/4) + 1.

But wait, the fourth face is the original face BCD, which is intersected by the cutting plane at midpoints of BC and BD.

So, the piece containing A also includes the portion of face BCD above the cutting plane, which is a triangle with area sqrt(3)/4.

Therefore, the total surface area is sqrt(3)/4 (ABC) + sqrt(3)/4 (ABD) + sqrt(3)/4 (ACD) + sqrt(3)/4 (BCD) + 1 (cutting plane) = 4*(sqrt(3)/4) + 1 = sqrt(3) + 1.

Wait, that makes more sense.

So, each piece has four original triangular faces, each split into a portion with area sqrt(3)/4 and the cutting plane with area 1.

Therefore, each piece has 4*(sqrt(3)/4) + 1 = sqrt(3) + 1.

So, the surface area of one piece is sqrt(3) + 1.

But let me confirm this.

Each of the four original triangular faces is split by the cutting plane into two parts: a smaller triangle of area sqrt(3)/4 and a trapezoidal part.

Each piece will have one of the smaller triangles from each original face.

Therefore, each piece has four smaller triangles, each with area sqrt(3)/4, so total area from original faces is 4*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3). Plus the cutting plane, which has area 1.

Therefore, total surface area is sqrt(3) + 1.

Therefore, the surface area of one of the pieces is sqrt(3) + 1.

But let me just make sure I didn't miss any faces.

Each piece has:

- The quadrilateral face (cutting plane): area 1.

- Four smaller triangular faces, each with area sqrt(3)/4.

So, 1 + 4*(sqrt(3)/4) = 1 + sqrt(3).

Yes, that seems right.

So, the surface area is sqrt(3) + 1.

Thus, the final answer is 1 + sqrt(3), which can be written as sqrt(3) + 1.

**Final Answer**
The surface area of one of the pieces is \boxed{1 + \sqrt{3}}.
</think>

Given a regular tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with side length 2, we need to find the surface area of one of the pieces after it is cut by a plane parallel to edges \(AB\) and \(CD\) and lying halfway between them.

1. **Coordinates of Vertices**:
   - \(A = (0, 0, 0)\)
   - \(B = (2, 0, 0)\)
   - \(C = (1, \sqrt{3}, 0)\)
   - \(D = (1, \sqrt{3}/3, 2\sqrt{6}/3)\)

2. **Midpoints of Edges**:
   - Midpoints of edges \(AC\), \(AD\), \(BC\), and \(BD\) are calculated as:
     - \(P1: (0.5, \sqrt{3}/2, 0)\)
     - \(P2: (0.5, \sqrt{3}/6, \sqrt{6}/3)\)
     - \(P3: (1.5, \sqrt{3}/2, 0)\)
     - \(P4: (1.5, \sqrt{3}/6, \sqrt{6}/3)\)

3. **Equation of the Cutting Plane**:
   - The plane passes through these midpoints and has the equation:
     - \(\sqrt{6} y + \sqrt{3} z = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\)

4. **Area of the Cutting Plane**:
   - The quadrilateral formed by the midpoints is a parallelogram with area 1.

5. **Surface Area Calculation**:
   - Each original face of the tetrahedron is split into two parts by the cutting plane. Each piece will have four smaller triangular faces, each with area \(\sqrt{3}/4\), and the cutting plane contributes an area of 1.
   - Total surface area of one piece is:
     - \(4 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + 1 = \sqrt{3} + 1\)

Thus, the surface area of one of the pieces is \(\boxed{1 + \sqrt{3}}\).
