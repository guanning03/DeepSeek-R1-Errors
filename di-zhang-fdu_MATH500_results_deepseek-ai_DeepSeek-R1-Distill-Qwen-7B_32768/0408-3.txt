Question:
What is the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeroes and ones?

Correct Answer:
If a number is divisible by 450, then it must be divisible by all divisors of 450, including 9 and 50.

For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Since a positive number must have at least one digit which is not 0, the number we're looking for is forced to have at least 9 ones among its digits.

The number we're looking for must also be divisible by 50, which means that it ends in 50 or 00. Since the digit 5 is not allowed, our number must end in 00, which means the smallest candidate is  $\boxed{11,\! 111,\! 111,\! 100}$. In fact, because 9 and 50 $\emph{do}$ divide this number, and because 450 is the least common multiple of 9 and 50, we know that 450 does divide 11,111,111,100; so that number is the correct answer.

Gold:
11,111,111,100

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I need to find the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all the digits are either 0 or 1. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I know that 450 is the number we're dealing with. To find a multiple of 450, I can represent it as 450 multiplied by some integer k. So, 450 × k should give me a number composed only of 0s and 1s.

Let me recall the divisibility rules because that might help. 450 is equal to 45 × 10, and further, 45 is 9 × 5. So, 450 is 2 × 3² × 5². That means any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 5², and 9.

Divisibility by 2 is straightforward: the last digit has to be even. Since our digits can only be 0 or 1, the last digit has to be 0. So, whatever number we get, it must end with a 0.

Divisibility by 5 is also straightforward because numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5, but since we can only have 0s and 1s, the last digit must be 0. So, again, the number must end with 0.

Divisibility by 9 is a bit trickier. The rule is that the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9. Since our number can only have 0s and 1s, the sum of the digits is essentially the count of 1s. So, the number of 1s in the number must be a multiple of 9.

So, putting it all together, the number we're looking for must:

1. End with 0.
2. Consist of only 0s and 1s.
3. Have a number of 1s that is a multiple of 9.

Given that, I need to find the smallest such number.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since the number must be a multiple of 450, which is 45 × 10, the number must have at least two 0s at the end (to satisfy 10) and the sum of digits must be a multiple of 9.

So, the minimal number would have a certain number of 1s and 0s, with the last two digits being 0, and the number of 1s being a multiple of 9. So, let me try to find the smallest such number.

Let me start by considering the smallest possible number of 1s, which is 9. So, we need a number that has nine 1s and the rest 0s, ending with two 0s.

So, the smallest number in terms of digit length would have nine 1s followed by two 0s. That would be 11111111100. Let me check the length: that's 11 digits. Hmm, is this the smallest, or can we have a smaller number with the same number of digits?

Wait, actually, the number doesn't necessarily have to have all the 1s at the front. Maybe arranging the 1s and 0s differently can result in a smaller number. So, perhaps the number can have fewer digits but with the same count of 1s.

Wait, but the number must end with two 0s. So, the minimal number of digits would be 11: nine 1s and two 0s. But can we arrange the 1s in such a way that the number is smaller than 11111111100?

Wait, in terms of numerical value, the smallest number is the one where the 1s are as far to the right as possible, right? So, for example, 10000000010 is smaller than 11111111100 because the 1s are closer to the end.

But wait, let me verify that. 10000000010 is 1 followed by nine 0s and ending with a 0. Wait, that's 10 digits, but it's actually just 10000000010, which is 10 digits, whereas 11111111100 is 11 digits. So, 10000000010 is smaller because it has fewer digits.

But hold on, is 10000000010 a multiple of 450? Let's check.

First, does it end with a 0? Yes, it ends with a 0. So, it's divisible by 10, which is good. Now, is it divisible by 45? Since 450 is 45 × 10, 450 divides 45 × 10, so if the number is divisible by both 45 and 10, it will be divisible by 450.

To check divisibility by 45, the number must be divisible by both 9 and 5. We already know it's divisible by 5 because it ends with a 0. Now, the sum of its digits: 1 + 0 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. But 1 is not a multiple of 9, so it's not divisible by 9. Therefore, 10000000010 is not a multiple of 450.

So, that number fails the divisibility by 9 test. So, we need a number with nine 1s. So, the minimal number of digits is 11, as we thought earlier.

But let's see if we can arrange the 1s in a way that the number is smaller. For example, 100000000010—wait, but that would have 12 digits, which is longer, so that's worse.

Alternatively, maybe 100000000000? No, that's 12 digits and only one 1, which doesn't satisfy the nine 1s requirement.

Wait, so maybe 11111111100 is the minimal number with nine 1s and two 0s at the end. Let's check that.

Is 11111111100 a multiple of 450? Let's see.

First, it ends with two 0s, so it's divisible by 100, hence by 10 and 450 is 45 × 10, so maybe it is divisible by 450.

To confirm, let's check if it's divisible by 9. The sum of its digits is 9 (since there are nine 1s and the rest are 0s), which is a multiple of 9. So, yes, it is divisible by 9.

Also, since it ends with two 0s, it's divisible by 100, which is more than enough for divisibility by 10. Since 450 is 45 × 10, and 11111111100 is divisible by both 9 and 10, it must be divisible by 450.

So, 11111111100 seems to satisfy all the conditions.

But is there a smaller number? Let me think.

Wait, the number must consist of 0s and 1s, end with two 0s, and have a digit sum of 9. So, 11111111100 is the number with nine 1s and two 0s. Since nine is the minimal number of 1s needed for divisibility by 9, right? Because 9 is the smallest multiple of 9.

But, wait, could a number with more than nine 1s be smaller? For example, 100111111100. No, that's 12 digits, which is longer, so it's larger.

Alternatively, 101111111100? That's 12 digits as well. So, no, that's longer.

Wait, but perhaps if we arrange the 1s differently, maybe we can have a number with the same number of digits but smaller in value.

Wait, 11111111100 is 11 digits. Is there a 11-digit number with nine 1s and two 0s that is smaller than 11111111100?

Wait, the smallest 11-digit number with nine 1s and two 0s would be having the two 0s at the end. So, 11111111100 is actually the smallest 11-digit number with nine 1s and two 0s because moving the 0s to the front would make the number smaller, but you can't have two 0s in the front because then it would be an 11-digit number, but the first digit can't be 0.

Wait, actually, if we try to place the 0s earlier, like 10111111110, but that's still 11 digits, but it's larger than 11111111100 because the first digit is 1, then 0, then all 1s and ending with a 0. So, 10111111110 is 10,111,111,110, whereas 11111111100 is 11,111,111,100, which is larger. So, 10111111110 is smaller, but is it a multiple of 450?

Wait, let me check if 10111111110 is divisible by 450.

First, it ends with a 0, so it's divisible by 10. The sum of its digits is 1 + 0 + 9×1 + 0 = 10. 10 is not a multiple of 9, so the number is not divisible by 9. Therefore, it's not divisible by 450.

So, that approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, what if I try to have the two 0s at the end, but arrange the 1s such that the number is as small as possible? But since we have nine 1s, the smallest way is to have all 1s as far to the right as possible, which is 11111111100. Any other arrangement would either keep the number the same or make it larger.

Wait, but 10000000010 is 10 digits, but as I saw earlier, it only has one 1, so it's not a multiple of 9. Then, 100000000100? Wait, that's 12 digits, but it has two 1s. Still, not enough. So, perhaps the minimal number is indeed 11111111100.

Wait, but let me think again. Is it possible to have a multiple of 450 with fewer digits but still satisfying the conditions? For instance, is there a 9-digit number with nine 1s and two 0s? No, because that would require 11 digits. So, 11 digits is the minimum.

Wait, no, 9 digits can't have 11 digits. So, 11 digits is the minimal.

Wait, maybe 10 digits, but with nine 1s and one 0. But then, the two 0s are needed for divisibility by 100, right? So, we need at least two 0s at the end.

Therefore, the number must be at least 11 digits long (nine 1s and two 0s). So, 11111111100 is the smallest.

But let me confirm by trying to see if a smaller number is possible. Suppose I have a number like 10101010100. Wait, that has two 1s, two 0s, but that's only nine digits. Wait, no, 10101010100 is 11 digits, but it has five 1s and six 0s, so the sum is 5, which is not a multiple of 9. So, it's not divisible by 9.

Alternatively, 11011011010. Let me count the digits: 11 digits. The number of 1s: 1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0. Hmm, that's seven 1s. Not a multiple of 9.

Alternatively, 11101111100. Let me count the digits: 11. Number of 1s: 1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. That's nine 1s. So, 11101111100. Is that smaller than 11111111100?

Wait, comparing 11111111100 and 11101111100.

Let me write them out:

11111111100: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0

11101111100: 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0

So, comparing digit by digit:

First three digits: 111 vs 111 – same.

Fourth digit: 1 vs 0. So, 11101111100 is smaller because at the fourth digit, it's 0 vs 1.

Therefore, 11101111100 is smaller than 11111111100.

Wait, that's interesting. So, is 11101111100 a multiple of 450? Let's check.

First, it ends with two 0s, so it's divisible by 100, which is good. The sum of its digits is 1+1+1+0+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9. So, it's divisible by 9 as well. Therefore, it's divisible by 450.

So, 11101111100 is a smaller number than 11111111100. So, that's better.

Wait, can we go even smaller?

Let me try another arrangement. Maybe 11011111100.

Digits: 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. Number of 1s: 1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. That's nine 1s.

Is 11011111100 smaller than 11101111100?

Comparing digit by digit:

First digit: 1 vs 1

Second digit: 1 vs 1

Third digit: 0 vs 1. So, 11011111100 is smaller because at the third digit, it's 0 vs 1.

So, 11011111100 is smaller than 11101111100.

Is 11011111100 a multiple of 450? Let's check.

Ends with two 0s: yes.

Sum of digits: 1+1+0+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9: yes.

So, it's divisible by 450.

Can we go even smaller?

Let me try moving the 0s further to the left.

How about 10111111100.

Digits: 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0.

Number of 1s: 1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. That's nine 1s.

Comparing 10111111100 with 11011111100.

First digit: 1 vs 1

Second digit: 0 vs 1. So, 10111111100 is smaller.

Is 10111111100 a multiple of 450? Let's see.

Ends with two 0s: yes.

Sum of digits: 1+0+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9: yes.

So, it's a multiple.

Can we make it even smaller?

Let me try 10011111100.

Digits: 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. Wait, no, that's 12 digits. Let me count: 1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. That's 12 digits, and the sum is 1+0+0+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9. Is it smaller than 10111111100?

Comparing 10011111100 and 10111111100:

First digit: 1 vs 1

Second digit: 0 vs 0

Third digit: 0 vs 1. So, 10011111100 is smaller.

Is 10011111100 a multiple of 450?

Ends with two 0s: yes.

Sum of digits: 9: yes.

So, yes, it is a multiple.

Can we go even smaller?

Next, let's try 10001111100.

Digits: 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. Wait, that's 13 digits. Wait, no, 1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0 is 13 digits. The sum is 1+0+0+0+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9.

Comparing 10001111100 with 10011111100:

First three digits: 100 vs 100 – same.

Fourth digit: 0 vs 0.

Fifth digit: 1 vs 1.

Wait, in 10001111100, digits 4 is 0, and in 10011111100, digit 4 is 1. So, 10001111100 is smaller.

Is 10001111100 a multiple of 450? Let's check.

Ends with two 0s: yes.

Sum of digits: 9: yes.

So, yes.

Can we go even smaller?

Let me try moving the 0s even further.

How about 10000111100.

Digits: 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. That's 13 digits. Sum: 1+0+0+0+0+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9.

Comparing 10000111100 with 10001111100.

First five digits: 10000 vs 10001. So, 10000 is smaller, so 10000111100 is smaller.

Is it a multiple? Yes, same reasoning.

Continuing this pattern, perhaps.

Let me try 10000011100.

Digits: 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. Sum: 1 + 0×5 + 3×1 = 4. Wait, no, that's only 4. I must have miscounted.

Wait, 1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0: digits 1:1, digits 7-11:1,1,1,1,1. So, total 1 + 5 = 6. Not 9. So, that won't work.

Wait, so I must have nine 1s. So, 10000011100 has only six 1s. So, that's not acceptable.

So, to have nine 1s, I need exactly nine 1s and two 0s at the end.

So, how can I place those 0s to get the minimal number?

The idea is to place the 0s as far to the right as possible, but with the constraint that the number must end with two 0s.

Wait, so the last two digits must be 0, so we can't move those. So, the earliest 0s can be placed as far to the right as possible.

So, in order to have the smallest number, the 0s should be placed as far to the right as possible, meaning as close to the end as possible.

So, the only way is to have the two 0s at the end, and the rest of the digits as 1s, but as far to the right as possible.

Wait, but we have to maintain the order of the digits. So, the first digit must be 1, then as many 1s as possible, but with the two 0s at the end.

Wait, but the number must have nine 1s and two 0s. So, the minimal number is 11111111100, but as we saw, there are smaller numbers if we rearrange the 0s earlier, but keeping in mind that the two 0s must be at the end.

Wait, actually, no, the two 0s must be at the end for divisibility by 100. So, the two 0s are fixed at the end.

Therefore, the minimal number is 11111111100 because moving the 0s earlier in the number would require having a 0 somewhere in the middle, which would make the number larger.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 10011111100 is smaller than 11111111100, but actually, in this case, if the two 0s are fixed at the end, then 10011111100 would have a 0 in the third position and a 1 in the fourth, making it larger.

Wait, actually, no, 10011111100 is 10,011,111,100, while 11111111100 is 11,111,111,100, which is indeed larger. So, 10011111100 is smaller.

But in 10011111100, the two 0s are at the end and one 0 in the third position. So, the two 0s are not necessarily both at the end.

Wait, hold on, 10011111100 ends with two 0s, but also has a 0 in the third position. So, in total, it's 1 followed by two 0s, then five 1s, then two 0s.

Wait, but that's actually 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0, which is 11 digits. The two 0s are at the end, but also a 0 in the third position.

So, in that case, is the number still ending with two 0s? Yes, so it's still divisible by 100, hence by 10 and 450.

But wait, the two 0s at the end are sufficient for divisibility by 100. The other 0s in between don't affect that.

So, perhaps, arranging the 0s earlier in the number can result in a smaller number.

So, for instance, 10011111100 is smaller than 11111111100 because, at the third digit, it has a 0 instead of a 1.

So, the number 10011111100 is smaller than 11111111100.

But is 10011111100 a multiple of 450? Let's confirm.

Sum of digits: 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 9. So, yes, divisible by 9.

Ends with two 0s: yes, so divisible by 100. Therefore, it's divisible by 450.

So, 10011111100 is smaller than 11111111100.

Wait, can we go even smaller?

What about 10001111100? Let me see.

Digits: 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. Wait, that's 12 digits, but we need only 11 digits because 9 1s and 2 0s. So, 10001111100 is 12 digits, which is longer, so it's larger than 10011111100, which is 11 digits.

So, 10011111100 is 11 digits, so it's smaller.

Wait, but can we arrange the 0s to be even earlier?

How about 10101111100.

Digits: 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. Wait, that's 11 digits. Sum of digits: 1+0+1+0+1+1+1+1+1+0+0= 8. Not a multiple of 9, so it's not divisible by 9, hence not by 450.

So, that doesn't work.

How about 10110111100.

Digits: 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. That's 12 digits, which is longer, so not helpful.

Alternatively, 10100111100.

Digits: 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. Sum: 1+0+1+0+0+1+1+1+1+1+0+0= 8. Again, not enough.

So, seems like 10011111100 is a good candidate.

Wait, but let me try moving the 0s to the fourth position.

Number like 10001111100, but that was 12 digits, which is longer.

Alternatively, 10010111100. Again, 12 digits, which is longer.

So, perhaps, 10011111100 is the minimal.

Wait, another thought: if I place the 0s earlier, but making sure that the number is as small as possible.

For example, 10011111100 vs 10001111100. Wait, 10001111100 is smaller, but it's 12 digits, so longer. So, 10011111100 is 11 digits, so it's smaller.

Alternatively, 10000111100, which is 13 digits, which is longer.

So, 10011111100 seems to be the minimal.

But wait, 10011111100 is 10,011,111,100. Let me check if that's indeed a multiple of 450.

Compute 10,011,111,100 ÷ 450.

Well, 450 × 22,246,913 = ?

Wait, maybe a better way is to divide 10,011,111,100 by 450.

First, divide by 100: 10,011,111,100 ÷ 100 = 100,111,111.

Then, divide that by 4.5 (since 450 ÷ 100 = 4.5). 100,111,111 ÷ 4.5.

Hmm, 100,111,111 ÷ 4.5 is equal to 100,111,111 × (2/9) = (100,111,111 × 2) ÷ 9.

Compute 100,111,111 × 2 = 200,222,222.

Now, divide 200,222,222 by 9.

200,222,222 ÷ 9: 9 × 22,246,913.888... Hmm, wait, 9 × 22,246,913 = 200,222,217.

So, 200,222,222 - 200,222,217 = 5.

So, 200,222,222 ÷ 9 = 22,246,913 with a remainder of 5. So, 22,246,913.888...

Therefore, 10,011,111,100 ÷ 450 = 22,246,913.888..., which is not an integer. So, wait, that's a problem.

Wait, so 10,011,111,100 is not a multiple of 450, even though it ends with two 0s and has a digit sum of 9. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let's double-check the sum of the digits for 10011111100.

1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0.

That's 1 + 0 + 0 is 1, then six 1s: 1 + 6 = 7, plus the last two 0s: 7. Wait, that's 7, not 9. Wait, what? Wait, no, no. Wait, let's recount.

Wait, 10011111100: digits are 1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0.

So, how many 1s? Let's count: 1, then 1,1,1,1,1,1: that's seven 1s. The other digits are 0s.

Wait, 10011111100: first digit 1, then two 0s, then five 1s, then two 0s. So, total 1s: 1 + 5 = 6. Wait, no: hold on, 10011111100 is:

Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

Digits: 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0

So, digits 1:1, digits 2:0, digits 3:0, digits 4:1, digits 5:1, digits 6:1, digits 7:1, digits 8:1, digits 9:1, digits 10:0, digits 11:0.

So, total 1s: 1 (position 1) + 1 (position 4) + 1 (5) + 1 (6) + 1 (7) + 1 (8) + 1 (9) = 7. So, seven 1s, which makes the sum 7, not 9.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was nine 1s. So, maybe I made a mistake when I thought that 10011111100 was a number with nine 1s.

So, in reality, 10011111100 has seven 1s and four 0s, which is not a multiple of 9. So, that number is not a multiple of 450.

Wait, so my earlier reasoning was flawed. I thought that 10011111100 had nine 1s, but actually, it has seven.

So, that changes things.
