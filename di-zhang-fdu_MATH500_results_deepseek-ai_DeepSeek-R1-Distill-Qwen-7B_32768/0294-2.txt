Question:
The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).

Correct Answer:
By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this math problem here: I need to figure out how many different values I can get from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by just inserting parentheses. I can't rearrange the terms; I can only change the order of operations by adding parentheses. The original expression without any parentheses is \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\), which equals 121 because multiplication comes before addition. But by inserting parentheses, I can get different results. For example, they showed that by doing \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot (5 + 1)\), the result is 144. So the question is, how many such different values can I get in total?

First, I should understand the structure of the expression. It's four multiplications: 2, 3, 4, 5, and then adding 1 at the end. So the expression is essentially \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\). Without parentheses, it's just multiplication first, then addition, giving 121. But with parentheses, I can group the multiplications in different ways, which can change the order in which operations are performed.

So, the key here is that parentheses allow me to change the grouping of operations. Since multiplication is associative, the way I group the numbers can change the result. So I need to figure out all the possible ways to parenthesize this expression and compute each result, making sure not to count duplicates if they occur.

Wait, but before jumping into that, maybe I should think about how many different ways there are to parenthesize an expression with multiple multiplications. For four numbers multiplied together, how many different parenthesizations are possible? I remember that for expressions with n numbers, the number of different parenthesizations is given by the (n-1)th Catalan number. So for four numbers, that would be the third Catalan number.

The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that have many applications in combinatorial mathematics. The nth Catalan number is given by \(C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}\). So for n=3, \(C_3 = \frac{1}{4} \binom{6}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5\). So there are 5 different ways to parenthesize four numbers multiplied together.

But in our case, it's not just the multiplications; we also have an addition at the end. So the expression is \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\). So the addition is at the end. The parentheses can only be inserted around the multiplications, not affecting the addition. So perhaps the number of different results is less than 5 because some parenthesizations might lead to the same result.

Wait, but actually, each different parenthesization will group the multiplications differently, so each different grouping can lead to a different result, right? Because multiplication is not commutative in the sense that the way you group them affects the result. For example, \( (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \) is different from \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)\), even though multiplication is associative. Wait, actually, no, multiplication is associative, so \( (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \). Hmm, but wait, that would mean that if the expression is just multiplications, all different parenthesizations give the same result because of associativity. So perhaps I was wrong earlier.

Wait, hold on. Let me test that. \( (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \) is 6 * 4 = 24, and \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)\) is 2 * 12 = 24. So same result. So for just multiplications, different parenthesizations give the same result due to associativity. So in this case, if I have only multiplications, the number of different results is 1. But when we add an addition, which has lower precedence, the position where we do the addition can affect the result.

Wait, but in the given expression, the addition is at the end: \( (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \). So maybe the addition can be grouped differently with the multiplications. So perhaps, if I insert parentheses such that the addition is grouped with some of the multiplications, that would change the result.

For example, in the example given: \( (2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot (5 + 1) \). So here, they grouped the 5 and 1 together with the addition, so (5 + 1) = 6, then multiplied by the product of 2, 3, and 4 in some grouping. Wait, but actually, in that expression, they grouped 3 and 4 first, then 2 with that result, and then grouped 5 and 1.

So, in effect, they changed the order of operations to do the addition at a different point. So that gives a different result.

Therefore, the addition can be inserted into different places, changing the order in which operations are performed, which can lead to different results.

Therefore, the problem reduces to figuring out how many different ways we can parenthesize the expression such that the addition is either at the end or grouped with some of the multiplications, leading to different results.

So, perhaps I should model this expression as a binary expression tree, where each operation is a node, and the leaves are the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and the addition is another node. So the structure is: the addition is the root, with two children: one being the product of 2, 3, 4, 5, and the other being 1. But that's just the original expression. By inserting parentheses, we can change the structure of this tree.

Wait, but in the example given, the addition is grouped with 5 and 1, so the structure becomes: the addition has two children, one is 5 and the other is the product of 2, 3, 4, and then 5 is added to 1? Wait, no, in the example, it's \( (2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot (5 + 1) \). So the addition is between 5 and 1, and the product is between 2, 3, 4, and the sum of 5 and 1.

Wait, actually, in that expression, the 5 is being added to 1, so 5 + 1 = 6, and then multiplied by 2, 3, 4. So in effect, the expression is (2 * 3 * 4 * (5 + 1)).

But that's the same as (2 * 3 * 4 * 6), which is 144, right? So that's one way of parenthesizing.

Alternatively, if I group the addition with the 1 and another number, say, group 4 and 5 together, but wait, no, the addition is only between 5 and 1. So perhaps the addition can be grouped with 5 or 1 or both? Wait, in the given example, it's 5 + 1, so the addition is between 5 and 1.

Alternatively, if I group 2 and 3 first, then group that with 4, then group that with 5, and then add 1, which is the original expression: 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.

Alternatively, if I group 3 and 4 first, then multiply by 2, multiply by (5 + 1), as in the example: 2 * (3 * 4) = 24, then 24 * (5 + 1) = 24 * 6 = 144.

Alternatively, what if I group 2 and 3, then group that with 5, then add 1 and multiply by 4? Wait, let me try.

Wait, let me think of all possible ways to parenthesize the expression.

First, the original expression: (2 * 3 * 4 * 5) + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.

Another way: group 3, 4, 5 together first, then multiply by 2 and add 1.

So, 2 * (3 * (4 * 5)) + 1. Let's compute that: 4 * 5 = 20, 3 * 20 = 60, 2 * 60 = 120, 120 + 1 = 121. So same result.

Alternatively, group 2, 3, 4 together, then multiply by (5 + 1). So, (2 * 3 * 4) * (5 + 1). Let's compute that: 2 * 3 = 6, 6 * 4 = 24, 5 + 1 = 6, 24 * 6 = 144.

Alternatively, group 2, (3 * (4 + 5)).

Wait, but the addition is only between 5 and 1, so I can't just add 4 and 5. So, perhaps that's not allowed.

Wait, if I group 4 and 5 together, but since the addition is only between 5 and 1, I can't group 4 and 5 unless it's in a product.

Wait, maybe I can group 3 and 4 together, then group that with (5 + 1), then multiply by 2. So, 2 * ((3 * 4) + (5 + 1)).

Wait, but that would be 2 * (12 + 6) = 2 * 18 = 36. Is that allowed? Wait, can I group 3 * 4 and 5 + 1 together? But in the original expression, it's 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1, so the multiplications are separate. So if I group 3 * 4, that's fine, then 5 + 1, but then how are they connected? It's 2 * ( (3 * 4) + (5 + 1) ). Wait, but that would require inserting parentheses to add 3*4 and 5+1, but in the original expression, they are separate.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I need to think of the entire expression as a binary tree, where the root is the addition, with two children: one is the product (2 * 3 * 4 * 5), and the other is 1. But if I want to change the order, I can restructure the tree by moving some operations under the addition.

For example, I can have the addition as the root, with one child being 1, and the other child being a product which includes some of the multiplications and the other number. But that's a bit vague.

Wait, another approach: The expression is a series of multiplications and an addition. The addition can be at the end, but by inserting parentheses, we can change whether the addition is done before some of the multiplications or not.

In the example, they did (2 * (3 * 4)) * (5 + 1). So they grouped 5 and 1 together, so that 5 + 1 is done first, then multiplied by the product of 2, 3, 4.

So, in effect, they moved the addition from the end to between 5 and 1, and then connected the rest of the multiplications to that.

So, if I can do similar things, moving the addition to different parts of the expression.

So, perhaps, the different parenthesizations correspond to different ways of splitting the multiplications into two parts, which are then multiplied together and added to 1, or 1 is added to a part and then multiplied.

Wait, in the given example, it's (product of 2, 3, 4) multiplied by (5 + 1). So, in effect, they split the multiplications into two parts: 2 * 3 * 4 and 5, and then added 1 to 5 and multiplied by the first part. So, that gives (2 * 3 * 4) * (5 + 1).

Alternatively, could I split the multiplications into another group, say, 2 and 3, and then 4 and 5, then add 1 somewhere else? Wait, but how would that work.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as inserting the addition operator somewhere in the multiplication chain, effectively splitting the multiplications into two separate products, which are then multiplied together and added to 1 in different ways.

So, let's think of the expression as 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1. If I insert parentheses to split it into two separate products, then add them together. But in the given example, they didn't add the two products, but rather multiplied one of them by the sum of 5 and 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the expression as two separate operations: a product and an addition.

Wait, another idea: maybe the different parenthesizations correspond to different ways of inserting parentheses in the multiplication part, and then inserting the addition in different places.

But the addition is fixed at the end, but can be grouped with some numbers. For example, in the given example, 5 + 1 is a group, but 2, 3, 4 are multiplied together. So the overall expression is (2 * 3 * 4) * (5 + 1).

Alternatively, could I group 4 and 5 with the addition? So, (2 * 3) * (4 + 5 + 1). Wait, but in that case, the operations would be 2 * 3 first, then 4 + 5 + 1, then multiply them. Let's compute that: 2 * 3 = 6, 4 + 5 + 1 = 10, 6 * 10 = 60. So that's a different result.

Wait, is that allowed? So, is it possible to group 4 and 5 with the addition? But in the original expression, 4 and 5 are being multiplied, right? So, unless we can change that, I don't think so. So, the addition is only allowed to be inserted with 1 and another number or another group.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the expression as a combination of two separate operations: a product of some subset of {2, 3, 4, 5} and a sum of another subset, including 1. So, the total expression is (product) + (sum). Wait, but that's not exactly right because the original expression is 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1.

So, it's the product of all four numbers plus 1. So, if I can group some of the multiplications into a product, and the remaining numbers are added together with 1.

Wait, no, because the addition is only at the end, so it's either part of the product or not. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the expression as a binary tree where the root is the addition operator, and its two children are subtrees. One subtree is just 1, and the other subtree is a product of the multiplications. But by inserting parentheses, I can change the structure so that some operations are done before others.

Alternatively, I can think of the expression as an expression tree where the addition is the last operation, so the entire expression is left multiplications, then addition.

But parentheses can change the order of operations, so perhaps I can have some additions done earlier.

Wait, for example, in the given example, they grouped 5 and 1 together, so the addition is done before multiplying with 2, 3, 4. So, the structure is: multiply (2 * (3 * 4)) then multiply by (5 + 1). So, the addition is done after 5, but before multiplying by the rest.

Alternatively, I could group 4 and 5 together, then add 1, then multiply by the rest. Wait, but 4 and 5 are multiplied, so unless I can add them, it's not possible. So, maybe I can't group 4 and 5 unless it's in a product.

Wait, so perhaps the only way to involve the addition is to group it with 1 and another number, but that number has to be either 5 or part of the multiplications.

Wait, in the given example, they grouped 5 and 1 together. So 5 + 1 is 6, and then multiplied by the rest, which are 2, 3, 4. So, that's 6 * (2 * 3 * 4) = 6 * 24 = 144.

Alternatively, could I group 4 and 1 together? Let's see: (2 * 3) * (4 + 1) * 5.

Wait, but in that case, the addition is between 4 and 1, then multiplied by 2, 3, 5. Let me compute that: 4 + 1 = 5, 2 * 3 = 6, 6 * 5 = 30, 30 * 5 = 150. Wait, hang on, is that correct? Let me parse the expression correctly.

Wait, the original expression is 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1. If I group 4 + 1, then the expression becomes 2 * 3 * (4 + 1) * 5. So, 4 + 1 is 5, then 2 * 3 is 6, 6 * 5 is 30, 30 * 5 is 150. So, that's a different result.

Wait, so that's 150. So that's another value.

Alternatively, if I group 3 + 1: 2 * (3 + 1) * 4 * 5. Let me compute that: 3 + 1 = 4, 2 * 4 = 8, 8 * 4 = 32, 32 * 5 = 160. So, 160.

Alternatively, grouping 2 + 1: (2 + 1) * 3 * 4 * 5. Let's compute: 2 + 1 = 3, 3 * 3 = 9, 9 * 4 = 36, 36 * 5 = 180. So, 180.

So, so far, I have:

1. Original: 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.

2. Group 5 + 1: (2 * 3 * 4) * (5 + 1) = 24 * 6 = 144.

3. Group 4 + 1: 2 * 3 * (4 + 1) * 5 = 6 * 5 * 5 = 150.

4. Group 3 + 1: 2 * (3 + 1) * 4 * 5 = 8 * 4 * 5 = 160.

5. Group 2 + 1: (2 + 1) * 3 * 4 * 5 = 3 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 180.

So, that's five different values: 121, 144, 150, 160, 180.

Wait, but is that all? Or are there more possibilities?

Wait, perhaps I can group more numbers together with the addition.

For example, grouping 2 + (3 * 4 * 5 + 1). Wait, but that would require changing the order of operations more significantly.

Wait, let me think: in the original expression, it's 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1. If I group 2 + something, I need to see how.

Alternatively, grouping (2 * 3) + 1, then multiplying the rest.

Wait, so (2 * 3) + 1 = 7, then multiplying by 4 * 5: 7 * 20 = 140. So, that's another result: 140.

Alternatively, grouping (2 * (3 * 4)) + 1, then multiplying by 5: (2 * 12) + 1 = 25, 25 * 5 = 125.

Wait, that's another one: 125.

Alternatively, grouping ((2 * 3) * 4) + 1, then multiplying by 5: (6 * 4) + 1 = 25, 25 * 5 = 125. Same as above.

Alternatively, grouping 2 * (3 * (4 + 1)) * 5. Let's compute that: 4 + 1 = 5, 3 * 5 = 15, 2 * 15 = 30, 30 * 5 = 150. So that's the same as grouping 4 + 1 earlier.

Alternatively, grouping (2 * 3) + (4 * 5 + 1). Wait, but that would be 6 + (20 + 1) = 6 + 21 = 27. But how would that be parenthesized? Wait, that would require more than just inserting parentheses in the original expression because it's adding two separate products.

Wait, hold on. The original expression is 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1, so all the multiplications are connected. To group (2 * 3) + (4 * 5 + 1), you need to have 2 * 3 as one part, 4 * 5 as another, and 1, then adding them together. But in the original expression, it's all multiplied together, so you can't just split it like that unless you insert parentheses. But wait, the original expression is 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1, so if you group (2 * 3) and (4 * 5 + 1), you'd have to write it as (2 * 3) + ((4 * 5) + 1). But that's different from the original expression because in the original, you have 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1.

Wait, no, actually, if you group (2 * 3) + (4 * 5 + 1), you have to have the addition distributed, but the original expression is just a linear chain of multiplications and one addition at the end.

Therefore, perhaps such groupings aren't allowed because you can't just split the multiplications arbitrarily without changing the structure.

Wait, but in the given example, they grouped 3 * 4 together, then multiplied by (5 + 1), which is a different grouping.

So, perhaps the key is that you can group any subset of the multiplications and then have the addition either applied to the end or to some grouped part.

So, in the expression, you can have multiple groupings, but each grouping must be a contiguous subset of the multiplications.

Wait, but in the given example, they grouped 3 * 4, then multiplied by (5 + 1). So, that is, 2 is multiplied by (3 * 4), and then multiplied by (5 + 1). So, in effect, the 5 + 1 is a separate group.

So, perhaps, in order to find all possible groupings, I need to consider all possible ways of grouping the multiplications into different subproducts and then grouping the addition with some of them.

So, in total, the expression can be thought of as a product of several factors, each of which is either a single number or a sum involving 1 and another number.

Wait, so the expression is 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1, but by inserting parentheses, we can turn it into different groupings where some multiplications are performed, and then added together.

Wait, but the addition is only at the end, so perhaps the only way to involve the addition is to group it with 1 and another number, then multiply the rest.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to think of the expression as a binary tree. The root is the addition, with one child being 1, and the other child being a product of the multiplications. The product can be structured in different ways, depending on where we place the parentheses.

So, the different parenthesizations correspond to different binary trees for the product part, each with a different structure.

Since the original product is 2 * 3 * 4 * 5, which can be parenthesized in 5 ways (Catalan number C3=5), but since multiplication is associative, the results are the same regardless of the parentheses. So, that suggests that no matter how we parenthesize the multiplications, the result will be 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. So, if you group them differently, the product is still 120.

But in the given example, they grouped some multiplications and then grouped the addition with another part, so the product is 120 and the addition is done later. Wait, but in their example, they did (2 * (3 * 4)) * (5 + 1). So, it's actually 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1, but grouped as (2 * (3 * 4)) * (5 + 1), which is 24 * 6 = 144.

So, in this case, they grouped the multiplications into two factors, 2 * (3 * 4) = 24, and (5 + 1) = 6, then multiplied them together, giving 144.

So, in effect, they split the original expression into two separate products: one involving 2, 3, 4, and the other involving 5 and 1, then multiplied together.

So, in this case, that results in (2 * 3 * 4) * (5 + 1) = 24 * 6 = 144.

So, perhaps, the different parenthesizations correspond to different ways to split the multiplications into separate products, each of which can be added or multiplied.

Wait, but in the original expression, the addition is only at the end. So, perhaps the different parenthesizations are equivalent to different ways of distributing the addition either before or after certain multiplications.

Wait, perhaps another way is to model the expression as a binary tree where the addition can be inserted either as a left or right child of the multiplication tree.

But this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe I should list all possible ways to parenthesize the expression and compute the results to see how many unique values we can get.

Wait, the expression has four numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5 and an addition. Without parentheses, it's 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1 = 121.

With parentheses, we can change the grouping to affect the order of operations. So, the different ways to parenthesize will lead to different results. Let's attempt to list all possible parenthesizations.

1. ((2 * 3) * 4) * 5 + 1: Leftmost grouping first. Compute 2*3=6, then 6*4=24, then 24*5=120, then +1=121.

2. (2 * (3 * 4)) * 5 + 1: Group 3*4 first, then 2*12=24, then 24*5=120, +1=121.

3. 2 * ((3 * 4) * 5) + 1: Group 3*4=12, then 12*5=60, then 2*60=120, +1=121.

4. 2 * (3 * (4 * 5)) + 1: Group 4*5=20, then 3*20=60, then 2*60=120, +1=121.

5. (2 * 3) * (4 * 5) + 1: Group 2*3=6, 4*5=20, then 6*20=120, +1=121.

Wait, so these are all the ways to group the multiplications, but they all result in 120, so adding 1 gives 121. So, that's why the original expression is 121.

But in the given example, they grouped part of the multiplications and then grouped the addition with another part, resulting in a different value.

So, perhaps, another way is to group some multiplications and then group the addition with another number or group.

So, let's think of the expression as a chain: 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1.

We can group the multiplications in different ways, but also insert the addition at different points.

Wait, but the addition is only at the end. So, unless we can group the addition with some of the multiplications, we can't change the result.

Wait, in the given example, they grouped 5 + 1, which is at the end, and then multiplied the result by the rest.

So, that's a different way.

So, to formalize this, the expression can be thought of as a product of multiple factors, each factor being a number or a sum involving 1 and another number. So, the expression can be split into a product where each factor is either a single number or a sum of 1 with another number.

In the given example, they split it into (2 * 3 * 4) and (5 + 1), then multiplied them together.

Similarly, we can split it into different groupings:

1. (2 * 3 * 4 * 5) + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.

2. (2 * 3 * 4) * (5 + 1) = 24 * 6 = 144.

3. (2 * 3) * (4 * 5) + 1. Wait, no, that's 6 * 20 + 1 = 121.

Wait, no, that's actually just regrouping the multiplications and then adding 1. So, it doesn't change the value.

Wait, but in this case, it's 6 * 20 = 120, then +1 = 121.

Wait, but if we group (2 * 3) * (4 * 5) + 1, it's the same as (6) * (20) + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.

So, it's the same as the original expression.

Wait, so perhaps, if we group the multiplications and then add 1 at the end, it doesn't change the result.

But in the given example, they grouped 5 + 1, then multiplied by the rest. So, that's a different structure.

So, perhaps the key is to group the addition with some other numbers, thus changing the order.

So, to generalize, we can have two cases:

1. The addition is done last: (multiplication expression) + 1.

2. The addition is done earlier, grouping 1 with another number, and then multiplying the rest.

So, in the first case, we have the original expression, which gives 121.

In the second case, we can choose to group 1 with another number, say, 5, and then multiply the rest, as in the given example.

So, how many different ways can we group 1 with other numbers?

Well, in the expression, 1 is at the end, so we can group it with 5, or with 4, or with 3, or with 2, as in the example.

Wait, but 1 is only one number, so if we group 1 with another number, say, 5, we get 5 + 1, then multiply by the rest.

But if we group 1 with 4, we have to group 4 + 1, and then multiply the rest.

But how does that work? Let me think.

Wait, in the original expression, it's 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1.

If I group 4 + 1, it's like doing (4 + 1) first, then multiplying by 2, 3, 5.

Wait, but the original expression is 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1, so to group 4 + 1, I need to have 2 * 3 * (4 + 1) * 5.

So, 4 + 1 is 5, then 2 * 3 is 6, 6 * 5 is 30, 30 * 5 is 150.

Similarly, if I group 3 + 1, it's (3 + 1) * 2 * 4 * 5.

Compute that: 3 + 1 = 4, 2 * 4 = 8, 8 * 4 = 32, 32 * 5 = 160.

If I group 2 + 1, it's (2 + 1) * 3 * 4 * 5.

Compute that: 2 + 1 = 3, 3 * 3 = 9, 9 * 4 = 36, 36 * 5 = 180.

If I group 5 + 1, it's 2 * 3 * 4 * (5 + 1) = 2 * 3 * 4 * 6 = 144.

So, that's four different groupings where we group 1 with another number, resulting in different values: 150, 160, 180, 144.

In addition, we have the original value: 121.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about grouping (2 * 3) + 1, but that would require inserting parentheses as (2 * 3) + 1, then multiplying by 4 * 5. Wait, but the original expression is 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1, so unless we can change the structure, that's not possible.

Wait, but in the given example, they grouped (2 * 3 * 4) * (5 + 1). So, that's grouping 5 + 1 and then multiplying the rest.

So, in effect, they are grouping 5 + 1 as a separate factor, and multiplying it by the rest.

So, in that case, the value is 2 * 3 * 4 * 6 = 144.

So, that's another way to group: group 5 + 1, which is 6, then multiply by the rest.

Similarly, we can group other numbers with 1, like grouping 4 + 1, 3 + 1, 2 + 1, as above, leading to 150, 160, 180.

So, in this way, we get four different values.

But wait, in the original expression, we can also group the addition with 2, 3, or 4.

But 2, 3, 4 are all multiplied together, so grouping 2 + 1, 3 + 1, or 4 + 1 would require changing the structure of the expression.

Wait, but can we group 2 + 1?

For example, (2 + 1) * 3 * 4 * 5.

Compute that: 2 + 1 = 3, 3 * 3 = 9, 9 * 4 = 36, 36 * 5 = 180.

So, that's the same as grouping 2 + 1 earlier.

Similarly, grouping 3 + 1 led to 160.

Grouping 4 + 1 led to 150.

Grouping 5 + 1 led to 144.

So, all of these give different results.

So, in this way, we have five different results: 121, 144, 150, 160, 180.

Wait, but earlier, I thought of grouping (2 * 3) + 1, but that leads to a different structure.

Wait, but in the original expression, it's 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1, so unless I can split the multiplications, I can't just insert a parenthesis after 2 * 3 and group (2 * 3) + 1.

Wait, unless I can do that, but is that allowed?

Wait, is that a different parenthesization? Let me see.

If I do ((2 * 3) + 1) * 4 * 5, that would be different. Let's compute that.

So, 2 * 3 = 6, 6 + 1 = 7, 7 * 4 = 28, 28 * 5 = 140.

So, that's 140.

Similarly, if I do (2 * (3 + 1)) * 4 * 5, that would be 2 * 4 = 8, 8 * 4 = 32, 32 * 5 = 160. Wait, but that's the same as grouping 3 + 1 earlier.

Wait, so 160 is already considered.

Alternatively, grouping (3 * (4 + 1)) * 2 * 5: 4 + 1 = 5, 3 * 5 = 15, 15 * 2 = 30, 30 * 5 = 150. So, that's the same as grouping 4 + 1 earlier.

Similarly, grouping (4 * (5 + 1)) * 2 * 3: 5 + 1 = 6, 4 * 6 = 24, 24 * 2 = 48, 48 * 3 = 144. So, that's the same as grouping 5 + 1.

Wait, but if I group (2 * (3 + 1)) * 4 * 5: 3 + 1 = 4, 2 * 4 = 8, 8 * 4 = 32, 32 * 5 = 160. So, that's equivalent to grouping 3 + 1.

Wait, so is there a different way to group it?

Wait, (2 * 3) + (4 * 5 + 1). But, again, that would require changing the structure, which isn't allowed because the original expression is a linear chain.

Wait, so perhaps, in this case, the only way to group the addition is to group it with 1 and another single number, then multiply the rest. So, that gives us four different groupings: grouping 2 + 1, 3 + 1, 4 + 1, 5 + 1, each leading to a different value.

Wait, but when I grouped (2 * 3) + 1, that's equivalent to grouping 2 + 1, but with a different order, but it leads to a different value, 140.

Wait, so that's another result: 140.

Wait, but that's a different grouping.

So, in this case, grouping (2 * 3) + 1 is allowed because it's a different parenthesization.

So, that's (2 * 3) + 1, then multiplied by 4 * 5.

Wait, but in that case, the structure is ((2 * 3) + 1) * (4 * 5). Compute that: 6 + 1 = 7, 4 * 5 = 20, 7 * 20 = 140.

So, that's another value: 140.

Similarly, if I group (3 * 4) + 1, then multiply by 2 * 5: 12 + 1 = 13, 2 * 5 = 10, 13 * 10 = 130.

Wait, that's a new value: 130.

Wait, is that allowed? Because in the original expression, it's 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1. So, if I group (3 * 4) + 1, is that permissible?

Yes, because you can insert parentheses around 3, 4, and 1, but in the original expression, 3, 4, 5 are multiplied, and 1 is at the end. So, to group (3 * 4) + 1, you have to have 2 * ((3 * 4) + 1) * 5. Wait, but that would require inserting parentheses in a different way.

Wait, actually, 2 * ((3 * 4) + 1) * 5 is a different parenthesization.

Compute that: 3 * 4 = 12, 12 + 1 = 13, 2 * 13 = 26, 26 * 5 = 130.

So, that's a different way, giving 130.

Similarly, grouping (4 * 5) + 1, then multiply by 2 * 3: 20 + 1 = 21, 2 * 3 = 6, 21 * 6 = 126.

Wait, that's another value: 126.

Compute that: 4 * 5 = 20, 20 + 1 = 21, 2 * 3 = 6, 21 * 6 = 126.

Alternatively, grouping 2 * (3 * 4) + 1, then multiply by 5: 3 * 4 = 12, 2 * 12 = 24, 24 + 1 = 25, 25 * 5 = 125.

Wait, that's another value: 125.

Wait, so hold on. Let's list all the possible ways we can group the additions with other numbers:

1. Group 2 + 1: ((2 + 1) * 3 * 4 * 5) = 3 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 180.

2. Group 3 + 1: (2 * (3 + 1) * 4 * 5) = 2 * 4 * 4 * 5 = 160.

3. Group 4 + 1: (2 * 3 * (4 + 1) * 5) = 2 * 3 * 5 * 5 = 150.

4. Group 5 + 1: (2 * 3 * 4 * (5 + 1)) = 2 * 3 * 4 * 6 = 144.

5. Group (2 * 3) + 1: ((2 * 3) + 1) * 4 * 5 = (6 + 1) * 4 * 5 = 7 * 20 = 140.

6. Group (3 * 4) + 1: 2 * ((3 * 4) + 1) * 5 = 2 * 13 * 5 = 130.

7. Group (4 * 5) + 1: 2 * 3 * ((4 * 5) + 1) = 2 * 3 * 21 = 126.

8. Group (2 * 3 * 4) + 1: ((2 * 3 * 4) + 1) * 5 = 24 + 1 = 25, 25 * 5 = 125.

Wait, so that's eight different groupings, each leading to a different value.

Wait, let me list them:

1. 180

2. 160

3. 150

4. 144

5. 140

6. 130

7. 126

8. 125

9. 121

So, that's nine different values. Wait, but let me check each calculation to make sure.

1. Group 2 + 1: ((2 + 1) * 3 * 4 * 5) = 3 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 180.

2. Group 3 + 1: (2 * (3 + 1) * 4 * 5) = 2 * 4 * 4 * 5 = 160.

3. Group 4 + 1: (2 * 3 * (4 + 1) * 5) = 2 * 3 * 5 * 5 = 150.

4. Group 5 + 1: (2 * 3 * 4 * (5 + 1)) = 2 * 3 * 4 * 6 = 144.

5. Group (2 * 3) + 1: ((2 * 3) + 1) * 4 * 5 = (6 + 1) * 4 * 5 = 7 * 20 = 140.

6. Group (3 * 4) + 1: 2 * ((3 * 4) + 1) * 5 = 2 * 13 * 5 = 130.

7. Group (4 * 5) + 1: 2 * 3 * ((4 * 5) + 1) = 2 * 3 * 21 = 126.

8. Group (2 * 3 * 4) + 1: ((2 * 3 * 4) + 1) * 5 = (24 + 1) * 5 = 25 * 5 = 125.

9. Original: 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.

So, each of these operations gives a different result, and none of them repeat. So, 180, 160, 150, 144, 140, 130, 126, 125, 121. That's nine different values.

Wait, but hold on, are there any other ways to group the addition with different numbers?

For example, can I group 2 + (3 + 1)? That would be ((2) + (3 + 1)) * 4 * 5 = (2 + 4) * 4 * 5 = 6 * 4 * 5 = 120, which is the same as the original expression. So, that doesn't give a new value.

Similarly, grouping 3 + (4 + 1): 2 * ((3) + (4 + 1)) * 5 = 2 * (3 + 5) * 5 = 2 * 8 * 5 = 80, which is different. Wait, hold on, is that allowed?

Wait, in the original expression, it's 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1. If I group 3 + (4 + 1), it would be equivalent to 2 * (3 + (4 + 1)) * 5.

Compute that: 3 + (4 + 1) = 8, 2 * 8 = 16, 16 * 5 = 80, then 80 + 1 = 81? Wait, no, hold on, in this grouping, where is the addition?

Wait, no, in this case, I grouped 3 + (4 + 1), which is 3 + 5 = 8, then multiplied by 2 and 5: 2 * 8 * 5 = 80. But in the original expression, it's 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1, so unless we have an addition at the end, inserting another addition inside would change the structure.

Wait, so perhaps, in this case, grouping 3 + (4 + 1) is equivalent to grouping (3 + 4 + 1), which is 8, then multiplying by 2 and 5.

So, 2 * (3 + 4 + 1) * 5 = 2 * 8 * 5 = 80.

But in the original expression, it's 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 + 1, so unless we can restructure the multiplications, we can't just insert parentheses like that.

Wait, actually, to group 3 + (4 + 1), you have to have 2 * (3 + (4 + 1)) * 5, which is a different expression structure.

But is that allowed? Because the original expression is a linear chain of multiplications and an addition at the end.

If you group 3 + (4 + 1), you're effectively changing the structure to have a sum in the middle, which wasn't originally there.

Wait, so is that a valid parenthesization? Or does the problem statement say that we can only insert parentheses, not change the structure otherwise?

Wait, the problem says: "The expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses can (note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses)."

So, only inserting parentheses, not moving terms around.

Therefore, we can't change the order of the multiplications or insert a sum in the middle.

Therefore, the above grouping of 3 + (4 + 1) is not allowed because it would require moving the addition into the middle, which isn't permitted.

So, that means that the addition can only be inserted at the end, grouping 1 with another number, or grouping 1 with a sum that's already in the expression.

Wait, but in the original expression, 1 is only at the end, so we can group it with another number, but we can't group it with a sum in the middle.

Therefore, the only way to involve 1 is to group it with another single number, either 2, 3, 4, or 5, or group it with a sum of two numbers.

Wait, but in the original expression, 1 is only at the end, so the only way to group it with a sum is if we can group it with another number, but in this case, we can group 1 with another number or a sum of numbers.

Wait, but in the given example, they grouped 5 + 1, which is grouping 1 with another number.

Alternatively, if we group 2 + 1, that's grouping 1 with another number.

But we can also group 3 + 1 or 4 + 1, as in the earlier cases.

But if we try to group 1 with a sum of two numbers, like (2 + 3) + 1, that would require restructuring the expression, which is not allowed.

Therefore, the possible groupings are:

1. Group 1 with another single number: 2 + 1, 3 + 1, 4 + 1, 5 + 1.

2. Group 1 with a sum that's already in the expression by grouping two multiplications and then grouping their result with 1.

Wait, in the given example, they grouped 5 + 1, then multiplied the rest. So, that's one way.

But in the earlier cases, when we grouped (2 * 3) + 1, it's equivalent to grouping 2 * 3 first, then adding 1, then multiplying by the rest.

Wait, but in that case, 1 is being grouped with the result of 2 * 3, not another number.

Wait, is that allowed?

Because in the original expression, 1 is only at the end. So, if you group (2 * 3) + 1, you're effectively creating a new sub-expression where 1 is being added after the multiplication, but in the original expression, 1 is just at the end.

So, perhaps, that's allowed because you can group the parentheses in such a way that you first compute 2 * 3, then add 1, then multiply by 4 * 5.

But is that permissible under the problem constraints?

The problem states that we can only insert parentheses. So, for example, you can have ((2 * 3) + 1) * (4 * 5). So, that is permissible.

Therefore, in this case, grouping (2 * 3) + 1 is allowed, leading to a different value.

Similarly, grouping (3 * 4) + 1 is allowed, as in ((3 * 4) + 1) * (2 * 5).

Similarly, grouping (4 * 5) + 1 is allowed: ((4 * 5) + 1) * (2 * 3).

Similarly, grouping (2 * 3 * 4) + 1: ((2 * 3 * 4) + 1) * 5.

Wait, so these groupings are allowed, and each gives a different result.

Therefore, in addition to the four groupings where we group 1 with a single number (2, 3, 4, 5), we have four more groupings where we group 1 with the result of two multiplications, then multiply the rest.

So, that gives 4 + 4 = 8 groupings, leading to 8 different results, plus the original 121, making 9 different values.

Wait, but earlier when I considered grouping (2 * 3 * 4) + 1, that's ((2 * 3 * 4) + 1) * 5 = (24 + 1) * 5 = 25 * 5 = 125.

Similarly, grouping (2 * 3 * 4 * 5) + 1 is the original expression, which is 120 + 1 = 121.

Wait, so if I group (2 * 3 * 4 * 5) + 1, it's the same as the original expression.

Wait, but that's just the original expression, so that doesn't add a new value.

So, we have to make sure that grouping the addition with a combination of multiplications doesn't result in the same value as the original.

But in the case of ((2 * 3 * 4) + 1) * 5, it's 25 * 5 = 125, which is different from the original 121.

Similarly, ((2 * 3) + 1) * 4 * 5 = 7 * 20 = 140, which is different from the original.

So, each of these groupings either groups 1 with a single number or groups 1 with a combination of multiplications, leading to different results.

So, in total, it's 4 groupings with single numbers, 4 groupings with multiple multiplications, and the original, totaling 9 different results.

Wait, let me list all the results again:

1. Original: 121.

2. Group 2 + 1: 180.

3. Group 3 + 1: 160.

4. Group 4 + 1: 150.

5. Group 5 + 1: 144.

6. Group (2 * 3) + 1: 140.

7. Group (3 * 4) + 1: 130.

8. Group (4 * 5) + 1: 126.

9. Group (2 * 3 * 4) + 1: 125.

So, that's nine different results. Is that all?

Wait, but let me think if there are other ways to group the addition with different combinations.

For example, can I group (2 + 1) * (3 + 1) * (4 + 1) * 5? No, because that would require inserting multiple parentheses, but the problem only allows inserting parentheses, not multiple groupings at the same time.

Wait, but actually, in the problem statement, it says "by inserting parentheses", so I think we can only insert one set of parentheses, but in the given example, they inserted two sets: one around 5 + 1 and another around 4 * 5.

Wait, but in reality, inserting multiple parentheses is allowed as long as it's done step by step.

Wait, but in the given example, they inserted two sets of parentheses: one around 5 + 1 and another around 4 * 5. But actually, it's just two separate groupings: one for 5 + 1 and one for 4 * 5. But in reality, you can have nested parentheses, but you can't have multiple separate groupings unless you structure the expression accordingly.

Wait, but in the original expression, it's a linear chain, so inserting parentheses can only group certain parts together, not create separate groupings.

Therefore, I think the nine different results I found are the only possible ones.

Wait, let me confirm by considering all possible ways to insert a single set of parentheses.

But in the problem, it's allowed to insert multiple sets of parentheses, as long as it's done step by step, so you can have nested parentheses.

So, for example, you can first group 5 + 1, then group 4 * (5 + 1), and then group 2 * (4 * (5 + 1)) * 3.

Wait, but that would be a different grouping, but in reality, 4 * (5 + 1) is already done, then multiplied by 2 and 3.

Wait, but that's similar to grouping (2 * 3 * 4) * (5 + 1), which is 144.

Alternatively, you can group 2 + 1, then group (3 * 4 * 5), then multiply: (2 + 1) * (3 * 4 * 5) = 3 * 60 = 180.

Wait, which is the same as grouping 2 + 1 first.

Alternatively, you can group (3 + 1) * (2 * 4 * 5): (3 + 1) * 40 = 4 * 40 = 160.

Similarly, group (4 + 1) * (2 * 3 * 5): 5 * 30 = 150.

Group (5 + 1) * (2 * 3 * 4): 6 * 24 = 144.

So, in each case, grouping a single number with 1 gives a different value.

Similarly, grouping a two-number multiplication with 1, then multiplying the rest, gives different results.

Therefore, I think in total, the number of different values is 9: 121, 125, 126, 130, 140, 144, 140, 150, 160, 180.

Wait, but hold on, let me count them again:

1. 121 (original)

2. 180 (group 2 + 1)

3. 160 (group 3 + 1)

4. 150 (group 4 + 1)

5. 144 (group 5 + 1)

6. 140 (group (2 * 3) + 1)

7. 130 (group (3 * 4) + 1)

8. 126 (group (4 * 5) + 1)

9. 125 (group (2 * 3 * 4) + 1)

So, 9 different results.

Wait, but in the grouping where we have ((2 * 3 * 4) + 1) * 5, we get 125, which is different from the original.

Similarly, grouping (2 * 3 * 4 * 5) + 1 is the original.

So, 121 is included, and 125 is a different value.

So, in total, 9 different values.

Therefore, I think the answer is 9 different values.

Wait, but let me make sure I haven't missed any possible grouping.

For example, grouping (2 + 1) * (3 + 1) * (4 + 1) * 5 would be ((2 + 1) * (3 + 1) * (4 + 1)) * 5, which is (3 * 4 * 5) * 5 = 60 * 5 = 300. But that's grouping multiple additions, which isn't allowed because the original expression only has one addition at the end.

Wait, no, because in the original expression, the addition is only at the end, so we can't group multiple additions unless we change the structure.

Therefore, that grouping isn't permissible.

Similarly, grouping 2 + (3 + 1) * (4 + 1) * 5 would require changing the structure, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, only groupings where either a single number is grouped with 1 or a product is grouped with 1 are permissible.

Therefore, 9 different values: 121, 125, 126, 130, 140, 144, 140, 150, 160, 180.

Wait, but hold on, 140 appears twice: once from grouping (2 * 3) + 1 and once from grouping (3 * 4) + 1? No, wait, no.

Wait, (2 * 3) + 1 is 7, multiplied by 4 * 5 is 20, 7 * 20 = 140.

Grouping (3 * 4) + 1 is 13, multiplied by 2 * 5 is 10, 13 * 10 = 130.

Wait, no, 130 is only once. So, 140 appears only once, from grouping (2 * 3) + 1.

Wait, so the unique values are 121, 125, 126, 130, 140, 144, 150, 160, 180. So, that's 9 different values.

Wait, let me make sure none of these are duplicates.

121, 125, 126, 130, 140, 144, 150, 160, 180. Each is unique.

Therefore, the total number of different values is 9.

So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The number of different values that can be obtained is \boxed{9}.
</think>

The expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) can be altered by inserting parentheses to change the order of operations. We need to determine how many different values can be obtained.

First, we consider the original expression without any parentheses:
\[2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.\]

Next, we explore different ways to insert parentheses to change the order of operations. We can group the addition with different parts of the multiplication chain, leading to different results.

1. Grouping 2 + 1:
   \[(2 + 1) \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 180.\]

2. Grouping 3 + 1:
   \[2 \cdot (3 + 1) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 160.\]

3. Grouping 4 + 1:
   \[2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 + 1) \cdot 5 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 150.\]

4. Grouping 5 + 1:
   \[2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 = 144.\]

5. Grouping (2 \cdot 3) + 1:
   \[(2 \cdot 3) + 1 = 7, \text{ then } 7 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 140.\]

6. Grouping (3 \cdot 4) + 1:
   \[(3 \cdot 4) + 1 = 13, \text{ then } 2 \cdot 13 \cdot 5 = 130.\]

7. Grouping (4 \cdot 5) + 1:
   \[(4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 21, \text{ then } 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 21 = 126.\]

8. Grouping (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) + 1:
   \[(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) + 1 = 25, \text{ then } 25 \cdot 5 = 125.\]

Listing all the results, we have:
- Original: 121
- Grouping 2 + 1: 180
- Grouping 3 + 1: 160
- Grouping 4 + 1: 150
- Grouping 5 + 1: 144
- Grouping (2 \cdot 3) + 1: 140
- Grouping (3 \cdot 4) + 1: 130
- Grouping (4 \cdot 5) + 1: 126
- Grouping (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) + 1: 125

These results are all unique, giving us a total of 9 different values.

Thus, the number of different values that can be obtained is \(\boxed{9}\).
