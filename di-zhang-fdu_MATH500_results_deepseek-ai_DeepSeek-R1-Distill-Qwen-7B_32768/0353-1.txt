Question:
A strictly increasing sequence of positive integers $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, $\dots$ has the property that for every positive integer $k$, the subsequence $a_{2k-1}$, $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$ is geometric and the subsequence $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$, $a_{2k+2}$ is arithmetic. Suppose that $a_{13} = 2016$. Find $a_1$.

Correct Answer:
Let $\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{b}{a},$ where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers, and $a < b.$  Then $a_2 = \frac{b}{a} \cdot a_1,$ and
\[a_3 = \frac{a_2^2}{a_1} = \frac{(b/a \cdot a_1)^2}{a_1} = \frac{b^2}{a^2} \cdot a_1.\]This implies $a_1$ is divisible by $a^2.$  Let $a_1 = ca^2$; then $a_2 = cab,$ $a_3 = cb^2,$
\begin{align*}
a_4 &= 2a_3 - a_2 = 2cb^2 - cab = cb(2b - a), \\
a_5 &= \frac{a_4^2}{a_3} = \frac{[cb(2b - a)]^2}{(cb^2)} = c(2b - 2a)^2, \\
a_6 &= 2a_5 - a_4 = 2c(2b - a)^2 - cb(2b - a) = c(2b - a)(3b - 2a), \\
a_7 &= \frac{a_6^2}{a_5} = \frac{[c(2b - a)(3b - 2a)]^2}{c(2b - a)^2} = c(3b - 2a)^2, \\
a_8 &= 2a_7 - a_6 = 2c(3b - 2a)^2 - c(2b - a)(3b - 2a) = c(3b - 2a)(4b - 3a), \\
a_9 &= \frac{a_8^2}{a_7} = \frac{[c(3b - 2a)(4b - 3a)]^2}{[c(3b - 2a)^2} = c(4b - 3a)^2,
\end{align*}and so on.

More generally, we can prove by induction that
\begin{align*}
a_{2k} &= c[(k - 1)b - (k - 2)a][kb - (k - 1)a], \\
a_{2k + 1} &= c[kb - (k - 1)a]^2,
\end{align*}for all positive integers $k.$

Hence, from $a_{13} = 2016,$
\[c(6b - 5a)^2 = 2016 = 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7 = 14 \cdot 12^2.\]Thus, $6b - 5a$ must be a factor of 12.

Let $n = 6b - 5a.$  Then $a < a + 6(b - a) = n,$ and
\[n - a = 6b - 6a = 6(b - a),\]so $n - a$ is a multiple of 6.  Hence,
\[6 < a + 6 \le n \le 12,\]and the only solution is $(a,b,n) = (6,7,12).$  Then $c = 14,$ and $a_1 = 14 \cdot 6^2 = \boxed{504}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where there's a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. Let me denote them as \( a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots \). The problem says that for every positive integer \( k \), two things happen:

1. The subsequence \( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \) is geometric.
2. The subsequence \( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \) is arithmetic.

Additionally, we know that \( a_{13} = 2016 \), and we need to find \( a_1 \).

Hmm, so let me try to parse this step by step. First, let's understand what it means for a subsequence to be geometric or arithmetic.

A geometric sequence has a common ratio between consecutive terms. So for the first condition, \( a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} = a_{2k+1} / a_{2k} \). That means \( (a_{2k})^2 = a_{2k-1} \cdot a_{2k+1} \).

Similarly, an arithmetic sequence has a common difference between consecutive terms. So for the second condition, \( a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1} \). That simplifies to \( 2a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k+2} \).

So, for every \( k \), these two conditions must hold. Let me try to write this down for specific values of \( k \) to see if I can find a pattern or recurrence relation.

Let's start with \( k = 1 \):

1. The subsequence \( a_1, a_2, a_3 \) is geometric, so \( (a_2)^2 = a_1 \cdot a_3 \).
2. The subsequence \( a_2, a_3, a_4 \) is arithmetic, so \( 2a_3 = a_2 + a_4 \).

Okay, so from the first condition, we can express \( a_3 \) in terms of \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \): \( a_3 = (a_2)^2 / a_1 \).

From the second condition, \( a_4 = 2a_3 - a_2 = 2(a_2)^2 / a_1 - a_2 \).

Now, let's move to \( k = 2 \):

1. The subsequence \( a_3, a_4, a_5 \) is geometric, so \( (a_4)^2 = a_3 \cdot a_5 \).
2. The subsequence \( a_4, a_5, a_6 \) is arithmetic, so \( 2a_5 = a_4 + a_6 \).

From the first condition for \( k = 2 \), \( a_5 = (a_4)^2 / a_3 \).

But we already have \( a_4 \) in terms of \( a_2 \) and \( a_1 \). Let me plug that in.

So, \( a_5 = ( (2(a_2)^2 / a_1 - a_2) )^2 / ( (a_2)^2 / a_1 ) \).

Hmm, that looks complicated. Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute \( a_4 \):
\( a_4 = 2a_3 - a_2 = 2(a_2^2 / a_1) - a_2 \).

Let me write that as \( a_4 = (2a_2^2 - a_1 a_2) / a_1 \).

So, \( a_4 = (2a_2^2 - a_1 a_2) / a_1 \).

Then, \( a_5 = (a_4)^2 / a_3 \).

But \( a_3 = a_2^2 / a_1 \), so \( a_5 = (a_4)^2 / (a_2^2 / a_1) = a_1 (a_4)^2 / a_2^2 \).

Substituting \( a_4 \) into this:

\( a_5 = a_1 \left( \frac{2a_2^2 - a_1 a_2}{a_1} \right)^2 / a_2^2 \).

Simplify numerator:

\( (2a_2^2 - a_1 a_2)^2 = [a_2(2a_2 - a_1)]^2 = a_2^2 (2a_2 - a_1)^2 \).

So,

\( a_5 = a_1 \times \frac{a_2^2 (2a_2 - a_1)^2}{a_1^2} / a_2^2 = \frac{(2a_2 - a_1)^2}{a_1} \).

Therefore, \( a_5 = (2a_2 - a_1)^2 / a_1 \).

Okay, that's \( a_5 \). Now, moving to the arithmetic condition for \( a_4, a_5, a_6 \):

\( 2a_5 = a_4 + a_6 \), so \( a_6 = 2a_5 - a_4 \).

We have \( a_5 \) and \( a_4 \) in terms of \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \), so let's write that.

\( a_6 = 2 \times \frac{(2a_2 - a_1)^2}{a_1} - \left( \frac{2a_2^2 - a_1 a_2}{a_1} \right) \).

Let me compute this:

First, expand \( (2a_2 - a_1)^2 \):
\( 4a_2^2 - 4a_1 a_2 + a_1^2 \).

So,

\( a_6 = 2 \times \frac{4a_2^2 - 4a_1 a_2 + a_1^2}{a_1} - \frac{2a_2^2 - a_1 a_2}{a_1} \).

Let me compute each term:

First term: \( 2 \times \frac{4a_2^2 - 4a_1 a_2 + a_1^2}{a_1} = \frac{8a_2^2 - 8a_1 a_2 + 2a_1^2}{a_1} \).

Second term: \( - \frac{2a_2^2 - a_1 a_2}{a_1} = \frac{-2a_2^2 + a_1 a_2}{a_1} \).

Now, add them together:

\( \frac{8a_2^2 - 8a_1 a_2 + 2a_1^2 - 2a_2^2 + a_1 a_2}{a_1} \).

Combine like terms:

- \( 8a_2^2 - 2a_2^2 = 6a_2^2 \)
- \( -8a_1 a_2 + a_1 a_2 = -7a_1 a_2 \)
- \( 2a_1^2 \)

So, numerator becomes \( 6a_2^2 - 7a_1 a_2 + 2a_1^2 \).

Thus, \( a_6 = \frac{6a_2^2 - 7a_1 a_2 + 2a_1^2}{a_1} \).

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps factorable?

Let me see:

\( 6a_2^2 - 7a_1 a_2 + 2a_1^2 \). Let me try to factor this quadratic in terms of \( a_2 \).

Looking for factors of \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) that add up to -7.

Wait, actually, let me write it as:

\( 6a_2^2 - 7a_1 a_2 + 2a_1^2 \).

Let me try to factor this quadratic expression.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to \( 6 \times 2 = 12 a_1^2 \) and add to -7a_1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the quadratic formula for factoring.

But perhaps it's better to set variables aside. Let me denote \( x = a_2 \), then the expression becomes \( 6x^2 -7a_1 x + 2a_1^2 \).

We can try to factor this:

Looking for two numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 6 \times 2a_1^2 = 12a_1^2 \) and \( m + n = -7a_1 \).

Hmm, 12a_1^2 can be factored into -3a_1 and -4a_1, which multiply to 12a_1^2 and add to -7a_1.

Yes! So, we can write:

\( 6x^2 -3a_1 x -4a_1 x + 2a_1^2 \).

Group:

\( (6x^2 -3a_1 x) + (-4a_1 x + 2a_1^2) \).

Factor:

\( 3x(2x - a_1) -2a_1(2x - a_1) \).

So, \( (3x - 2a_1)(2x - a_1) \).

Therefore, \( 6a_2^2 -7a_1 a_2 + 2a_1^2 = (3a_2 - 2a_1)(2a_2 - a_1) \).

Therefore, \( a_6 = \frac{(3a_2 - 2a_1)(2a_2 - a_1)}{a_1} \).

So, \( a_6 = \frac{(3a_2 - 2a_1)(2a_2 - a_1)}{a_1} \).

Since \( a_6 \) must be an integer, \( a_1 \) must divide the numerator. So \( a_1 \) divides \( (3a_2 - 2a_1)(2a_2 - a_1) \).

Given that \( a_1 \) is a positive integer, and the sequence is strictly increasing, so \( a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < \dots \).

Given that, let's see if we can find some relations or perhaps express \( a_2 \) in terms of \( a_1 \).

Wait, maybe I can express \( a_2 \) as \( a_1 \times r \), since the first three terms form a geometric sequence.

Wait, no, because \( a_1, a_2, a_3 \) is geometric, so \( a_2 = a_1 \times r \), and \( a_3 = a_2 \times r = a_1 \times r^2 \).

But then, is \( r \) an integer? Not necessarily, but given that all terms are integers, \( a_2 \) must be a multiple of \( a_1 \), but not necessarily that \( r \) is integer. Hmm, but if \( a_1 \) divides \( a_2 \), which divides \( a_3 \), but since the sequence is strictly increasing, \( r \) must be greater than 1.

Wait, but if \( a_2 = a_1 \times r \), then \( a_3 = a_2 \times r = a_1 \times r^2 \). So, \( a_3 = (a_2)^2 / a_1 \) as we had before.

But considering that \( a_2 \) and \( a_1 \) are integers, \( a_1 \) must divide \( (a_2)^2 \).

So, perhaps \( a_1 \) is a square number? Or at least, \( a_2 \) is a multiple of \( \sqrt{a_1} \), but since \( a_1 \) is integer, \( a_2 \) must be a multiple of a divisor of \( a_1 \).

This seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can assign variables to these expressions.

Let me denote \( a_1 = d \), where \( d \) is a positive integer.

Then, \( a_2 = d \times r \), where \( r \) is a rational number greater than 1, since the sequence is strictly increasing.

But since \( a_2 \) must be an integer, \( r \) must be a rational number such that \( d \times r \) is integer.

Similarly, \( a_3 = (a_2)^2 / d = (d r)^2 / d = d r^2 \), which is also integer.

So, \( a_3 = d r^2 \). Then, \( a_4 = 2a_3 - a_2 = 2d r^2 - d r = d(2r^2 - r) \).

Similarly, \( a_4 = d(2r^2 - r) \).

Now, moving to \( a_5 \):

From the geometric condition for \( a_3, a_4, a_5 \):

\( (a_4)^2 = a_3 \times a_5 \).

So, \( a_5 = (a_4)^2 / a_3 = [d(2r^2 - r)]^2 / (d r^2) = d (2r^2 - r)^2 / r^2 \).

Simplify:

\( a_5 = d \times \left( \frac{2r^2 - r}{r} \right)^2 = d \times \left( 2r - 1 \right)^2 \).

So, \( a_5 = d (2r - 1)^2 \).

Similarly, from the arithmetic condition for \( a_4, a_5, a_6 \):

\( 2a_5 = a_4 + a_6 \).

So, \( a_6 = 2a_5 - a_4 = 2d(2r - 1)^2 - d(2r^2 - r) \).

Let me compute this:

First, expand \( (2r - 1)^2 = 4r^2 - 4r + 1 \).

So,

\( a_5 = d(4r^2 - 4r + 1) \).

Thus,

\( a_6 = 2d(4r^2 - 4r + 1) - d(2r^2 - r) \).

Compute term by term:

First term: \( 8d r^2 - 8d r + 2d \).

Second term: \( -2d r^2 + d r \).

Adding together:

\( (8d r^2 - 2d r^2) + (-8d r + d r) + (2d) \).

Simplify:

\( 6d r^2 - 7d r + 2d \).

Factor out \( d \):

\( d(6r^2 - 7r + 2) \).

So, \( a_6 = d(6r^2 - 7r + 2) \).

Hmm, interesting. So, now we have \( a_6 \) expressed in terms of \( d \) and \( r \).

I wonder if this pattern continues, but maybe it's getting too complicated. Let me see what we can do next.

Given that \( a_1 = d \), \( a_2 = d r \), \( a_3 = d r^2 \), \( a_4 = d(2r^2 - r) \), \( a_5 = d(2r - 1)^2 \), \( a_6 = d(6r^2 -7r +2) \).

Let me compute a few more terms to see if a pattern emerges.

For \( k = 3 \), we have the geometric subsequence \( a_5, a_6, a_7 \). So,

\( (a_6)^2 = a_5 \cdot a_7 \).

Thus,

\( a_7 = (a_6)^2 / a_5 = [d(6r^2 -7r +2)]^2 / [d(2r -1)^2] \).

Simplify:

\( a_7 = d \times \frac{(6r^2 -7r +2)^2}{(2r -1)^2} \).

Similarly, compute \( a_7 \).

But let me see if \( 6r^2 -7r +2 \) can be factored:

Quadratic in \( r \): \( 6r^2 -7r +2 \).

Looking for factors: \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \). So, looking for two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to -7. Hmm, -3 and -4.

Wait, 6r^2 -4r -3r +2 = 2r(3r -2) -1(3r -2) = (2r -1)(3r -2).

Yes, so \( 6r^2 -7r +2 = (2r -1)(3r -2) \).

Therefore,

\( a_7 = d \times \frac{(2r -1)^2 (3r -2)^2}{(2r -1)^2} = d (3r -2)^2 \).

So, \( a_7 = d(3r -2)^2 \).

Moving on, the arithmetic condition for \( a_6, a_7, a_8 \):

\( 2a_7 = a_6 + a_8 \).

Thus, \( a_8 = 2a_7 - a_6 = 2d(3r -2)^2 - d(6r^2 -7r +2) \).

Compute this:

First, expand \( (3r -2)^2 = 9r^2 -12r +4 \).

So,

\( a_7 = d(9r^2 -12r +4) \).

Thus,

\( a_8 = 2d(9r^2 -12r +4) - d(6r^2 -7r +2) \).

Compute term by term:

First term: \( 18d r^2 -24d r +8d \).

Second term: \( -6d r^2 +7d r -2d \).

Adding together:

\( (18d r^2 -6d r^2) + (-24d r +7d r) + (8d -2d) \).

Simplify:

\( 12d r^2 -17d r +6d \).

Factor out \( d \):

\( d(12r^2 -17r +6) \).

Hmm, now \( a_8 = d(12r^2 -17r +6) \).

Wait, let me check if this quadratic factors.

\( 12r^2 -17r +6 \).

Looking for factors: 12*6=72. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 72 and add to -17.

-8 and -9: 8*9=72, 8+9=17. So,

12r^2 -8r -9r +6.

Group as (12r^2 -8r) + (-9r +6) = 4r(3r -2) -3(3r -2) = (4r -3)(3r -2).

Yes! So,

\( 12r^2 -17r +6 = (4r -3)(3r -2) \).

Therefore, \( a_8 = d(4r -3)(3r -2) \).

Hmm, so we have:

\( a_1 = d \),

\( a_2 = d r \),

\( a_3 = d r^2 \),

\( a_4 = d(2r^2 - r) \),

\( a_5 = d(2r -1)^2 \),

\( a_6 = d(6r^2 -7r +2) = d(2r -1)(3r -2) \),

\( a_7 = d(3r -2)^2 \),

\( a_8 = d(12r^2 -17r +6) = d(3r -2)(4r -3) \).

I can see a pattern emerging here. Let me tabulate the expressions:

- \( a_1 = d \)
- \( a_2 = d r \)
- \( a_3 = d r^2 \)
- \( a_4 = d(2r^2 - r) \)
- \( a_5 = d(2r -1)^2 \)
- \( a_6 = d(2r -1)(3r -2) \)
- \( a_7 = d(3r -2)^2 \)
- \( a_8 = d(3r -2)(4r -3) \)
  
It seems that starting from \( a_3 \), the terms are products of expressions linear in \( r \), and these expressions are increasing by 1 each time.

Wait, for \( a_4 \), it's \( 2r^2 - r = r(2r -1) \),

for \( a_5 \), it's \( (2r -1)^2 \),

for \( a_6 \), it's \( (2r -1)(3r -2) \),

for \( a_7 \), it's \( (3r -2)^2 \),

for \( a_8 \), it's \( (3r -2)(4r -3) \),

and so on.

So, maybe in general, for \( n \geq 3 \), \( a_n \) alternates between a square and a product of two linear terms, each increasing the coefficient by 1.

So, perhaps \( a_{2k-1} = (kr - (k-1))^2 \) and \( a_{2k} = (kr - (k-1))( (k+1)r - k ) \)?

Wait, let me test this hypothesis.

For \( k = 1 \):

\( a_1 = d \),

\( a_2 = d r \).

Hmm, not exactly matching the expressions above.

Alternatively, perhaps \( a_{2k-1} = ( (k) r - (k-1) )^2 \) and \( a_{2k} = ( (k) r - (k-1) ) ( (k+1) r -k ) ) \).

Testing for \( k =1 \):

\( a_1 = (1 r - 0)^2 = r^2 \). But \( a_1 = d \), so that would mean \( r^2 = d \). Hmm, not quite.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indexing.

Wait, \( a_3 = d r^2 \). If I take \( k =2 \):

\( a_{2*2 -1} = a_3 = (2 r -1)^2 d \). Hmm, which is exactly what we have.

Similarly, \( a_4 = d(2r^2 - r) = d r(2r -1) \).

Similarly, for \( k=3 \):

\( a_5 = d(2r -1)^2 \),

\( a_6 = d(2r -1)(3r -2) \),

\( a_7 = d(3r -2)^2 \),

\( a_8 = d(3r -2)(4r -3) \),

So, in general, for each \( k \geq 2 \):

- \( a_{2k -1} = d ( (k -1) r - (k -2) )^2 \),
- \( a_{2k} = d ( (k -1) r - (k -2) ) ( k r - (k -1) ) \).

Yes, that seems to fit.

So, for \( k =2 \):

- \( a_3 = d ( (2 -1) r - (2 -2) )^2 = d ( r - 0 )^2 = d r^2 \),
- \( a_4 = d ( (2 -1) r - (2 -2) ) ( 2r - (2 -1) ) = d ( r ) (2r -1) \).

Which matches.

Similarly, for \( k =3 \):

- \( a_5 = d ( (3 -1) r - (3 -2) )^2 = d (2r -1)^2 \),
- \( a_6 = d (2r -1)(3r -2) \).

Which also matches.

So, in general, for \( k \geq 2 \):

- \( a_{2k -1} = d ( (k -1) r - (k -2) )^2 \),
- \( a_{2k} = d ( (k -1) r - (k -2) ) ( k r - (k -1) ) \).

Therefore, continuing this pattern, for \( k =13 \), since we're given \( a_{13} = 2016 \), which is an odd index, so it's a geometric term.

Wait, 13 is \( 2k -1 \), so \( 2k -1 =13 \implies k=7 \).

Therefore, \( a_{13} = a_{2*7 -1} = d ( (7 -1) r - (7 -2) )^2 = d (6r -5)^2 \).

Given that \( a_{13} =2016 \), so:

\( d (6r -5)^2 =2016 \).

Therefore, \( d =2016 / (6r -5)^2 \).

Since \( d \) must be a positive integer, \( (6r -5)^2 \) must divide 2016.

Therefore, \( 6r -5 \) must be an integer that is a square divisor of 2016.

So, let me find the square factors of 2016.

First, factorize 2016:

2016 ÷ 2 =1008

1008 ÷2=504

504÷2=252

252÷2=126

126÷2=63

63÷3=21

21÷3=7

So, 2016=2^5 ×3^2 ×7^1.

Square factors are formed by even exponents:

- 2^0 ×3^0 =1

- 2^2 ×3^0=4

- 2^0 ×3^2=9

- 2^2 ×3^2=36

So, square factors are 1,4,9,36.

Therefore, \( (6r -5)^2 \) can be 1,4,9,36.

Therefore, \( 6r -5 = \sqrt{1}=1 \), \( \sqrt{4}=2 \), \( \sqrt{9}=3 \), \( \sqrt{36}=6 \).

So, possible values for \( 6r -5 \):

1,2,3,6.

Thus, \( 6r -5 =1, 2, 3,6 \).

Solving for \( r \):

Case 1: \( 6r -5 =1 \implies 6r=6 \implies r=1 \).

But if \( r=1 \), then the sequence would be constant, but the sequence is strictly increasing, so \( r>1 \). Therefore, discard this case.

Case 2: \(6r -5=2 \implies6r=7 \implies r=7/6\).

Case3: \(6r -5=3 \implies6r=8 \implies r=8/6=4/3\).

Case4: \(6r -5=6 \implies6r=11 \implies r=11/6\).

So, possible \( r \) values are \( 7/6, 4/3,11/6 \).

Now, since \( r \) is a rational number, and \( a_1 =d \), \( a_2 =d r \), and so on must be integers.

Therefore, \( r = p/q \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers, \( p>q \).

Given \( r =7/6 \), \( 4/3 \), or \(11/6 \).

So, let's check each case.

Case2: \( r=7/6 \).

Then, \( a_2 =d*(7/6) \). Since \( a_2 \) must be an integer, \( d \) must be a multiple of 6. Let \( d=6k \), where \( k \) is a positive integer.

Then, \( a_2=6k*(7/6)=7k \).

Similarly, \( a_3 =d r^2=6k*(49/36)= (6k*49)/36= (49k)/6 \).

But \( a_3 \) must be integer, so 49k must be divisible by 6. Since 49 and 6 are coprime, \( k \) must be divisible by 6.

Let \( k=6m \), so \( d=6k=36m \).

Then, \( a_2=7k=42m \),

\( a_3=49k/6=49*(6m)/6=49m \).

Proceeding, \( a_4 = d(2r^2 - r) =36m*(2*(49/36) -7/6)=36m*(98/36 -42/36)=36m*(56/36)=36m*(14/9)=56m \).

Similarly, \( a_5 = d(2r -1)^2 =36m*(2*(7/6) -1)^2=36m*(14/6 -6/6)^2=36m*(8/6)^2=36m*(64/36)=64m \).

Continuing, \( a_6 = d(6r^2 -7r +2)=36m*(6*(49/36) -7*(7/6)+2)=36m*(49/6 -49/6 +2)=36m*2=72m \).

\( a_7 =d(3r -2)^2=36m*(3*(7/6)-2)^2=36m*(7/2 -4/2)^2=36m*(3/2)^2=36m*(9/4)=81m \).

\( a_8 =d(12r^2 -17r +6)=36m*(12*(49/36) -17*(7/6)+6)=36m*(49/3 -119/6 +6)=36m*(98/6 -119/6 +36/6)=36m*(15/6)=36m*(5/2)=90m \).

\( a_9 =d(3r -2)(4r -3)=36m*(3*(7/6)-2)(4*(7/6)-3)=36m*(7/2 -4/2)(14/3 -9/3)=36m*(3/2)(5/3)=36m*(5/2)=90m \).

Wait, but \( a_9 \) is supposed to be part of a geometric sequence \( a_7, a_8, a_9 \).

So, \( a_7=81m \), \( a_8=90m \), \( a_9=90m \). Wait, but \( a_8 \) and \( a_9 \) are both 90m?

Wait, but the subsequence \( a_7, a_8, a_9 \) needs to be geometric. So, \( a_8 / a_7 = a_9 / a_8 \).

But in this case, \( 90m /81m=10/9 \), and \( a_9 /a_8=90m /90m=1 \). So, 10/9 ≠1, which is a problem.

Therefore, this case leads to a contradiction because the geometric condition is not satisfied for \( k=4 \).

Hence, \( r=7/6 \) is invalid.

Case3: \( r=4/3 \).

Then, \( a_2 =d*(4/3) \). Therefore, \( d \) must be a multiple of 3, say \( d=3k \).

Thus, \( a_2=4k \).

\( a_3 =d r^2=3k*(16/9)= (48k)/9=16k/3 \). So, \( a_3 \) must be integer, so \( k \) must be multiple of 3, say \( k=3m \).

Thus, \( d=3k=9m \),

\( a_2=4k=12m \),

\( a_3=16k/3=16*3m/3=16m \).

Proceeding to \( a_4 =d(2r^2 -r)=9m*(2*(16/9) -4/3)=9m*(32/9 -12/9)=9m*(20/9)=20m \).

\( a_5 =d(2r -1)^2=9m*(2*(4/3)-1)^2=9m*(8/3 -3/3)^2=9m*(5/3)^2=9m*(25/9)=25m \).

\( a_6 =d(6r^2 -7r +2)=9m*(6*(16/9) -7*(4/3)+2)=9m*(96/9 -28/3 +2)=9m*(32/3 -28/3 +6/3)=9m*(10/3)=30m \).

\( a_7 =d(3r -2)^2=9m*(3*(4/3)-2)^2=9m*(4 -2)^2=9m*(4)=36m \).

\( a_8 =d(12r^2 -17r +6)=9m*(12*(16/9) -17*(4/3)+6)=9m*(192/9 -68/3 +6)=9m*(64/3 -68/3 +18/3)=9m*(14/3)=42m \).

\( a_9 =d(3r -2)(4r -3)=9m*(3*(4/3)-2)(4*(4/3)-3)=9m*(4 -2)(16/3 -9/3)=9m*(2)(7/3)=9m*(14/3)=42m \).

Wait, check the geometric sequence \( a_7, a_8, a_9 \). So, \( a_7=36m \), \( a_8=42m \), \( a_9=42m \).

So, \( a_8 / a_7 =42m /36m=7/6 \), and \( a_9 /a_8=42m /42m=1 \). Again, 7/6≠1. So, geometric condition fails here as well.

Thus, \( r=4/3 \) is invalid.

Case4: \( r=11/6 \).

So, \( a_2 =d*(11/6) \). Therefore, \( d \) must be multiple of 6, say \( d=6k \).

Therefore, \( a_2=11k \).

\( a_3 =d r^2=6k*(121/36)= (726k)/36= (121k)/6 \). So, \( a_3 \) must be integer, so \( k \) must be multiple of 6, say \( k=6m \).

Thus, \( d=6k=36m \),

\( a_2=11k=66m \),

\( a_3=121k /6=121*6m /6=121m \).

Proceeding, \( a_4 =d(2r^2 -r)=36m*(2*(121/36) -11/6)=36m*(242/36 -66/36)=36m*(176/36)=36m*(44/9)=44m*(4)=176m \).

Wait, \( 36m*(176/36) =176m \). Yes.

\( a_5 =d(2r -1)^2=36m*(2*(11/6)-1)^2=36m*(22/6 -6/6)^2=36m*(16/6)^2=36m*(256/36)=256m \).

\( a_6 =d(6r^2 -7r +2)=36m*(6*(121/36) -7*(11/6)+2)=36m*(121/6 -77/6 +12/6)=36m*(56/6)=36m*(28/3)=84m*4=336m \).

Wait, no:

Wait, \( 36m*(56/6) =36m*(28/3)= (36/3)*28m=12*28m=336m \). Correct.

\( a_7 =d(3r -2)^2=36m*(3*(11/6)-2)^2=36m*(33/6 -12/6)^2=36m*(21/6)^2=36m*(49/4)= 36m*(49)/4=9*49m=441m \).

\( a_8 =d(12r^2 -17r +6)=36m*(12*(121/36) -17*(11/6)+6)=36m*(121/3 -187/6 +6)=36m*(242/6 -187/6 +36/6)=36m*(91/6)=6*91m=546m \).

\( a_9 =d(3r -2)(4r -3)=36m*(3*(11/6)-2)(4*(11/6)-3)=36m*(11/2 -4/2)(44/6 -18/6)=36m*(7/2)(26/6)=36m*(7/2)(13/3)=36m*(91/6)=6*91m=546m \).

Wait, check the geometric sequence \( a_7, a_8, a_9 \):

\( a_7=441m \), \( a_8=546m \), \( a_9=546m \).

So, \( a_8 /a_7 =546m /441m=546/441=78/63=26/21≈1.238 \),

\( a_9 /a_8=546m /546m=1 \).

Which is not equal, so the geometric condition fails again.

Hmm, so \( r=11/6 \) also leads to a contradiction.

Wait, so none of the cases with \( r=7/6,4/3,11/6 \) work because they lead to \( a_{k+2} \) not following the geometric progression.

Hmm, that is a problem.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing \( a_9 \) in the case of \( r=4/3 \). Let me double-check.

Wait, for \( r=4/3 \):

- \( a_7=36m \),

- \( a_8=42m \),

- \( a_9=90m \).

Wait, no, when I computed \( a_9 \), I think I made a mistake.

Wait, no, \( a_9 \) was computed as \( d(3r -2)(4r -3) \).

So, with \( r=4/3 \), \( 3r -2=4 -2=2 \), \( 4r -3=16/3 -9/3=7/3 \).

Thus, \( a_9= d*(2)*(7/3)=14d/3 \).

But \( d=9m \), so \( a_9=14*9m /3=42m \).

Wait, but \( a_8=42m \), so \( a_8 /a_7=42m /36m=7/6 \), and \( a_9 /a_8=42m /42m=1 \), which is not equal.

So, indeed, it's invalid.

Wait, so all three cases for \( r \) lead to contradictions. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps my assumption that \( (6r -5)^2 \) divides 2016 is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the expressions.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider more factors.

Wait, 2016 has square factors 1,4,9,36, but perhaps I also need to consider if \( (6r -5) \) could be a multiple of these square factors?

Wait, no, because \( (6r -5)^2 \) must be a square factor of 2016.

Wait, 2016's square factors are 1,4,9,36 as I listed earlier. So, perhaps I need to consider \( (6r -5)^2=1,4,9,36 \), which implies \( 6r -5=1,2,3,6 \), as I did before.

Since all these cases lead to contradictions, maybe I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, perhaps \( r \) is an integer?

Wait, in my earlier analysis, I assumed \( r \) is rational, but maybe \( r \) is integer.

Let me test \( r=2 \).

If \( r=2 \), then \( a_2=d*2 \), \( a_3=d*4 \).

Given that, \( a_1, a_2, a_3 \) is geometric, so \( a_3 = (a_2)^2 /a_1 \). So, \( d*4 = (2d)^2 /d =4d \). So, that's consistent.

Similarly, the arithmetic condition for \( a_2, a_3, a_4 \): \( 2a_3 =a_2 +a_4 \implies 2*(4d)=2d +a_4 \implies 8d=2d +a_4 \implies a_4=6d \).

So, \( a_4=6d \).

Then, the geometric condition for \( a_3, a_4, a_5 \): \( (a_4)^2 =a_3 *a_5 \implies (6d)^2 =4d *a_5 \implies36d^2=4d a_5 \implies a_5=9d \).

Then, the arithmetic condition for \( a_4, a_5, a_6 \): \( 2a_5 =a_4 +a_6 \implies 2*9d=6d +a_6 \implies 18d=6d +a_6 \implies a_6=12d \).

Then, the geometric condition for \( a_5, a_6, a_7 \): \( (a_6)^2 =a_5 *a_7 \implies (12d)^2=9d *a_7 \implies144d^2=9d a_7 \implies a_7=16d \).

Then, arithmetic condition for \( a_6, a_7, a_8 \): \( 2a_7 =a_6 +a_8 \implies2*16d=12d +a_8 \implies32d=12d +a_8 \impliesa_8=20d \).

Geometric condition for \( a_7, a_8, a_9 \): \( (a_8)^2 =a_7 *a_9 \implies (20d)^2=16d *a_9 \implies400d^2=16d a_9 \implies a_9=25d \).

Arithmetic condition for \( a_8, a_9, a_{10} \): \(2a_9 =a_8 +a_{10} \implies2*25d=20d +a_{10} \implies50d=20d +a_{10} \impliesa_{10}=30d \).

Continuing, geometric condition for \( a_9, a_{10}, a_{11} \): \( (a_{10})^2 =a_9 *a_{11} \implies(30d)^2=25d *a_{11} \implies900d^2=25d a_{11} \impliesa_{11}=36d \).

Arithmetic condition for \( a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12} \): \(2a_{11}=a_{10} +a_{12} \implies2*36d=30d +a_{12} \implies72d=30d +a_{12} \impliesa_{12}=42d \).

Geometric condition for \( a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13} \): \( (a_{12})^2 =a_{11} *a_{13} \implies(42d)^2=36d *a_{13} \implies1764d^2=36d a_{13} \impliesa_{13}=49d \).

So, \( a_{13}=49d=2016 \impliesd=2016 /49=41.142857...\).

Wait, but \( d \) must be integer, 2016 ÷49=41.142857, which is not integer.

Wait, 49*41=2009, 49*42=2058, which is more than 2016. So, 2016 is not divisible by 49. Therefore, this case also leads to a contradiction.

Hmm, so \( r=2 \) is invalid.

Wait, but the problem says "strictly increasing sequence of positive integers", so perhaps \( d=41.142857 \) is invalid. So, \( r=2 \) is not acceptable.

Wait, so perhaps \( r \) is a fraction, but not integer.

Wait, but earlier cases with \( r=7/6,4/3,11/6 \) all led to contradictions.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my earlier analysis.

Wait, let me go back to the equation \( a_{13}=d(6r -5)^2=2016 \). So, \( (6r -5)^2 \) is a divisor of 2016.

2016's square factors are 1,4,9,36, as we saw.

Thus, \( (6r -5)^2 \in \{1,4,9,36\} \implies6r -5 \in \{1,2,3,6\} \implies r \in \{1,7/6, 8/6=4/3,11/6\} \).

But we saw that for these \( r \) values, the sequence fails the geometric or arithmetic conditions at some point.

Wait, is there another approach?

Perhaps instead of trying to find \( r \) first, I should express \( a_{13} \) in terms of \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \), then plug in \( a_{13}=2016 \).

Given that, in the case where \( r=7/6 \), we saw that \( a_{13}=d*(6r -5)^2 \). Since \( 6r -5=6*(7/6)-5=7-5=2 \), so \( a_{13}=d*4=2016 \impliesd=504 \). Wait, hold on:

Wait, \( 6r -5=6*(7/6)-5=7-5=2 \), so \( (6r -5)^2=4 \), so \( a_{13}=d*4=2016 \impliesd=504 \).

But earlier, when I tried \( r=7/6 \), I saw that \( a_8 /a_7=10/9 \), but \( a_9=90m \). Wait, but for \( d=504 \), \( m=1 \), so \( a_9=90*1=90 \), but \( a_8=42*1=42 \), so \( a_9 /a_8=90 /42=15/7 \neq1 \).

Wait, that also leads to a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about \( r \). Alternatively, maybe \( r \) is not a constant ratio but varies?

Wait, no, in the problem statement, it's said that for every positive integer \( k \), the subsequence \( a_{2k-1},a_{2k},a_{2k+1} \) is geometric and the subsequence \( a_{2k},a_{2k+1},a_{2k+2} \) is arithmetic.

So, the ratio \( r \) in the geometric sequences is consistent across all \( k \). Similarly, the common difference in arithmetic sequences is consistent.

So, \( r \) is a fixed ratio for all geometric triplets, and \( d \) is a fixed common difference for all arithmetic triplets.

Therefore, \( r \) must be a constant.

Hmm, so perhaps even though \( r=7/6 \) leads to a contradiction, there must be another way to approach this.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require \( r \) to be an integer. But we saw that all possible \( r \) from the square factors lead to contradictions.

Wait, but in the case \( r=7/6 \), \( a_1=504 \), \( a_2=504*(7/6)=588 \), \( a_3=588*(7/6)=686 \).

Then, \( a_4=2*588^2 -588=2*345,196 -588=690,392 -588=689,804 \). Wait, that seems too big.

Wait, no, actually \( a_4=d(2r^2 - r)=504*(2*(49/36) -7/6)=504*(98/36 -42/36)=504*(56/36)=504*(14/9)=504*(14)/9=56*14=784.

Wait, no, 504*(14/9)=56*14=784.

Then, \( a_5=d(2r -1)^2=504*(14/6 -1)^2=504*(7/3 -3/3)^2=504*(4/3)^2=504*(16/9)=56*16=896.

Then, \( a_6=d(6r^2 -7r +2)=504*(6*(49/36) -7*(7/6)+2)=504*(49/6 -49/6 +2)=504*2=1008.

\( a_7=d(3r -2)^2=504*(3*(7/6)-2)^2=504*(7/2 -4/2)^2=504*(3/2)^2=504*(9/4)=1134.

\( a_8=d(12r^2 -17r +6)=504*(12*(49/36) -17*(7/6)+6)=504*(49/3 -119/6 +6).

Convert to sixths: 49/3=98/6, 119/6, 6=36/6.

So, 98/6 -119/6 +36/6=(98 -119 +36)/6=(15)/6=2.5=5/2.

Thus, \( a_8=504*(5/2)=1260 \).

Then, \( a_9=d(3r -2)(4r -3)=504*(3*(7/6)-2)(4*(7/6)-3)=504*(7/2 -4/2)(14/3 -9/3)=504*(3/2)(5/3)=504*(15/6)=504*(5/2)=1260 \).

Wait, so \( a_8=1260 \), \( a_9=1260 \). Which would mean that \( a_8 =a_9 \), but the sequence is strictly increasing, so this is a contradiction.

Therefore, \( r=7/6 \) is invalid.

Wait, same problem as before.

So, maybe \( d \) is not an integer? But the sequence is of positive integers, so \( d \) must be integer.

Wait, this is perplexing. All possible \( r \) lead to contradictions. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, another thought: perhaps \( a_1=1 \). Maybe that's a starting point.

Wait, but then \( a_2 =a_1 * r \), which would have to be integer. So, \( r \) must be rational.

Wait, but we tried \( r \) as fractions, but they all led to contradictions.

Alternatively, maybe \( a_1=2016 \), but then \( a_{13}=2016 \), so \( d*(6r -5)^2=2016 \). Wait, but \( d=2016 \), so \( (6r -5)^2=1 \implies6r -5=1 \impliesr=1 \). But \( r=1 \) would mean the sequence is constant, which contradicts strictly increasing.

Thus, that approach doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that all terms are multiples of \( d \). Maybe I need to consider that \( d \) is the first term, and the ratio \( r \) is such that all terms are integers, which might not be the case if \( r \) is a fraction. So, perhaps I need to represent \( r = p/q \) in reduced form, and then express \( d \) in terms of \( p \) and \( q \).

Let me try that.

Let me suppose \( r = p/q \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime positive integers, \( p > q \) since \( r >1 \).

Then, \( a_1 = d \),

\( a_2 = d * (p/q) \),

\( a_3 = d * (p^2 / q^2) \).

But \( a_2 \) and \( a_3 \) must be integers, so \( d \) must be a multiple of \( q^2 \). Let \( d = k q^2 \), where \( k \) is a positive integer.

Thus,

\( a_1 =k q^2 \),

\( a_2 =k q^2 * (p/q)=k q p \),

\( a_3 =k q^2 * (p^2 / q^2)=k p^2 \).

Similarly, \( a_4 =2 a_3 -a_2 =2k p^2 -k q p =k(2p^2 - p q) \).

\( a_4 \) must be integer, which it is.

Then, \( a_5 = (a_4)^2 /a_3 = (k^2 (2p^2 -p q)^2 )/(k p^2 )=k (2p^2 -p q)^2 / p^2 \).

Since \( a_5 \) must be integer, \( p^2 \) must divide \( k (2p^2 -p q)^2 \).

Since \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime, \( p^2 \) must divide \( k \).

Let \( k =m p^2 \), where \( m \) is a positive integer.

Thus, \( d=k q^2= m p^2 q^2 \).

So, \( a_1 =m p^2 q^2 \),

\( a_2 =k q p =m p^2 q^2 * q p =m p^3 q^3 \).

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, \( a_1 =d=k q^2 =m p^2 q^2 \),

\( a_2 =k q p =m p^2 q^2 * q p =m p^3 q^3 \). Wait, that seems too big.

Wait, no, let me correct:

Wait, \( a_2 =d * (p/q)=m p^2 q^2 * (p/q)=m p^3 q \).

Similarly, \( a_3 =d * (p^2 / q^2)=m p^2 q^2 * (p^2 / q^2)=m p^4 \).

Wait, that's better.

\( a_4 =2 a_3 -a_2=2m p^4 -m p^3 q=m p^3 (2p - q) \).

\( a_5 = (a_4)^2 /a_3= (m^2 p^6 (2p - q)^2)/(m p^4)=m p^2 (2p - q)^2 \).

Proceeding, \( a_6 =2 a_5 -a_4=2m p^2 (2p - q)^2 -m p^3 (2p - q)=m p^2 [2(2p - q)^2 -p(2p - q)] \).

Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:

\( 2(2p - q)^2 -p(2p - q) \).

First, expand \( (2p - q)^2=4p^2 -4p q + q^2 \).

Thus,

\( 2*(4p^2 -4p q + q^2) -p*(2p - q)=8p^2 -8p q +2 q^2 -2p^2 +p q=6p^2 -7p q +2 q^2 \).

So, \( a_6 =m p^2 (6p^2 -7p q +2 q^2) \).

Similarly, \( a_7=(a_6)^2 /a_5= [m^2 p^4 (6p^2 -7p q +2 q^2)^2 ]/[m p^2 (2p - q)^2 ]=m p^2 (6p^2 -7p q +2 q^2)^2 / (2p - q)^2 \).

Since \( a_7 \) must be integer, \( (2p - q)^2 \) must divide \( m p^2 (6p^2 -7p q +2 q^2)^2 \).

But since \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime, \( (2p - q) \) and \( p \) might share a common factor.

Wait, \( 2p - q \) and \( p \) share a common divisor \( d \) if \( d \) divides both \( p \) and \( 2p - q \). But since \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime, \( d \) must divide \( q \). But \( d \) divides \( p \), which is coprime with \( q \), so \( d=1 \).

Therefore, \( (2p - q) \) is coprime with \( p \). Therefore, \( (2p - q)^2 \) must divide \( m \).

Let me denote \( m =n (2p - q)^2 \), where \( n \) is a positive integer.

Thus, \( d= m p^2 q^2 =n (2p - q)^2 p^2 q^2 \).

Therefore, \( a_1 =n (2p - q)^2 p^2 q^2 \).

Proceeding, \( a_2 =m p^3 q =n (2p - q)^2 p^3 q \).

\( a_3 =m p^4 =n (2p - q)^2 p^4 \).

\( a_4 =m p^3 (2p - q)=n (2p - q)^3 p^3 \).

\( a_5 =m p^2 (2p - q)^2 =n (2p - q)^4 p^2 \).

\( a_6 =m p^2 (6p^2 -7p q +2 q^2 )=n (2p - q)^2 p^2 (6p^2 -7p q +2 q^2 ) \).

\( a_7 =m p^2 (6p^2 -7p q +2 q^2 )^2 / (2p - q)^2= n (2p - q)^2 p^2 (6p^2 -7p q +2 q^2 )^2 / (2p - q)^2 =n p^2 (6p^2 -7p q +2 q^2 )^2 \).

This is getting quite complicated, but perhaps we can see a pattern.

Wait, so the expressions for \( a_7, a_8, \ldots \) are getting more complex.

But we know that \( a_{13} =2016 \).

Given that, perhaps \( n \) is 1, since higher \( n \) would make \( a_{13} \) larger than 2016.

Let me suppose \( n=1 \).

Then, \( a_1 = (2p - q)^2 p^2 q^2 \).

We need to find integers \( p, q \) coprime, \( p> q \geq1 \), such that \( a_{13}=2016 \).

But computing \( a_{13} \) would require going through all the terms, which is tedious.

Alternatively, maybe \( 2p - q \) is 1, so that \( m=1*(1)^2=1 \). Then, \( a_1 = p^2 q^2 \).

Then, \( a_2 =p^3 q \),

\( a_3 =p^4 \),

\( a_4=2 p^4 -p^3 q \),

\( a_5 =p^2 (2p - q)^2 =p^2 (1)^2 =p^2 \),

Wait, no:

Wait, \( a_5 = (a_4)^2 /a_3 = (2p^4 -p^3 q)^2 /p^4 \).

But if \( 2p - q=1 \implies q=2p -1 \).

Thus, \( a_5 = (2p^4 - p^3*(2p -1))^2 /p^4 \).

Compute numerator:

\( 2p^4 -2p^4 +p^3 =p^3 \).

Thus, \( a_5 = (p^3)^2 /p^4 =p^2 \).

So, \( a_5=p^2 \).

Then, \( a_6=2 a_5 -a_4=2 p^2 - (2p^4 -p^3 q) \).

But \( q=2p -1 \), so \( p^3 q=p^3(2p -1)=2p^4 -p^3 \).

Thus, \( a_4=2p^4 - (2p^4 -p^3)=2p^4 -2p^4 +p^3=p^3 \).

Therefore, \( a_6=2p^2 -p^3 \).

But \( a_6 \) must be positive, so \( 2p^2 -p^3 >0 \implies p^2(2 -p )>0 \implies p<2 \).

But \( p \) is a positive integer greater than \( q \geq1 \), so \( p=2 \), \( q=2p -1=3 \).

Wait, but \( p=2 \), \( q=3 \), but \( p \) must be greater than \( q \), which is not the case.

Wait, contradiction. So, this suggests that \( 2p - q=1 \) only possible if \( p=1 \), but then \( q=1 \), which would make \( p=q \), which is not allowed as they must be coprime.

Thus, \( 2p - q=1 \) is invalid.

Therefore, \( 2p - q \) must be greater than 1.

Wait, perhaps \( 2p - q=2 \).

Thus, \( q=2p -2 \).

Since \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime, \( p \) and \( 2p -2 \) must be coprime.

Thus, \( \gcd(p,2p -2)=\gcd(p, -2) \).

Therefore, if \( p \) is even, \( \gcd(p,2p -2)=2 \). If \( p \) is odd, \( \gcd(p,2p -2)=1 \).

But since \( p \) and \( q \) must be coprime, \( p \) must be odd, so \( \gcd(p,2p -2)=1 \).

Thus, \( p \) must be odd, \( q=2p -2 \).

So, let me pick \( p=3 \), then \( q=2*3 -2=4 \). But \( p=3 \), \( q=4 \), \( \gcd(3,4)=1 \). Good.

Compute \( a_1 = (2p - q)^2 p^2 q^2=(6 -4)^2 *9*16= (2)^2 *9*16=4*144=576 \).

\( a_2 =m p^3 q =1*27*4=108 \).

\( a_3 =m p^4=1*81=81 \).

\( a_4=2p^4 -p^3 q=2*81 -27*4=162 -108=54 \).

\( a_5=(a_4)^2 /a_3=54^2 /81=2916 /81=36 \).

\( a_6=2a_5 -a_4=2*36 -54=72 -54=18 \).

\( a_7=(a_6)^2 /a_5=324 /36=9 \).

\( a_8=2a_7 -a_6=2*9 -18=18 -18=0 \). Wait, no, that can't be, since the sequence is strictly increasing.

Wait, \( a_7=9 \), \( a_8=2a_7 -a_6=18 -18=0 \). But \( a_8=0 \) is not positive, which is a contradiction.

Thus, \( p=3 \), \( q=4 \) is invalid.

Wait, perhaps \( p=5 \), \( q=2*5 -2=8 \). \( \gcd(5,8)=1 \).

Compute \( a_1=(2*5 -8)^2 *25*64=(10 -8)^2 *25*64=4*25*64=4*1600=6400 \).

\( a_2=1*125*8=1000 \).

\( a_3=1*625=625 \).

\( a_4=2*625 -125*8=1250 -1000=250 \).

\( a_5=(250)^2 /625=62500 /625=100 \).

\( a_6=2*100 -250=200 -250=-50 \). Negative, invalid.

So, again, invalid.

Wait, maybe \( p=5 \), \( q=8 \) is invalid. Hmm.

Wait, so perhaps \( 2p - q=2 \) is invalid as well. Maybe \( 2p - q=3 \).

Thus, \( q=2p -3 \).

Since \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime, \( \gcd(p,2p -3)=\gcd(p,3) \).

Thus, if \( p \) is a multiple of 3, \( \gcd=3 \), else 1.

To have \( \gcd=1 \), \( p \) must not be a multiple of 3.

So, pick \( p=4 \), \( q=2*4 -3=5 \). \( \gcd(4,5)=1 \).

Compute \( a_1=(2*4 -5)^2 *16*25=(8 -5)^2 *400=9*400=3600 \).

\( a_2=1*64*5=320 \).

\( a_3=1*256=256 \).

\( a_4=2*256 -64*5=512 -320=192 \).

\( a_5=(192)^2 /256=36864 /256=144 \).

\( a_6=2*144 -192=288 -192=96 \).

\( a_7=(96)^2 /144=9216 /144=64 \).

\( a_8=2*64 -96=128 -96=32 \).

\( a_9=(32)^2 /64=1024 /64=16 \).

\( a_{10}=2*16 -32=32 -32=0 \). Again, invalid.

So, \( a_{10}=0 \), which is invalid.

Hmm, same problem.

Wait, perhaps \( p=2 \), \( q=1 \). \( \gcd(2,1)=1 \).

But \( q=2p -3=4 -3=1 \).

Compute \( a_1=(4 -1)^2 *4*1=9*4=36 \).

\( a_2=1*8*1=8 \).

\( a_3=1*16=16 \).

\( a_4=2*16 -8=32 -8=24 \).

\( a_5=(24)^2 /16=576 /16=36 \).

\( a_6=2*36 -24=72 -24=48 \).

\( a_7=(48)^2 /36=2304 /36=64 \).

\( a_8=2*64 -48=128 -48=80 \).

\( a_9=(80)^2 /64=6400 /64=100 \).

\( a_{10}=2*100 -80=200 -80=120 \).

\( a_{11}=(120)^2 /100=14400 /100=144 \).

\( a_{12}=2*144 -120=288 -120=168 \).

\( a_{13}=(168)^2 /144=28224 /144=196 \).

But \( a_{13}=196 \neq2016 \).

Hmm, so close.

Wait, but if we scale up \( n=2 \), maybe?

Wait, in the above case, \( n=1 \) gives \( a_{13}=196 \).

If we set \( n=2 \), then \( a_1=(2p - q)^2 p^2 q^2= (3)^2 *4*1 *2=9*4*1*2=72 \).

Wait, actually, no, \( n \) was introduced as \( m =n (2p -q)^2 \), but in prior steps, we took \( n=1 \).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe \( 2p - q=4 \).

Thus, \( q=2p -4 \).

Compute \( \gcd(p,2p -4)=\gcd(p,4) \). So, to have \( \gcd=1 \), \( p \) must be odd and not multiple of 2.

So, pick \( p=5 \), \( q=2*5 -4=6 \). \( \gcd(5,6)=1 \).

Compute \( a_1=(10 -6)^2 *25*36=16*900=14400 \).

That's too big.

Alternatively, \( p=3 \), \( q=2*3 -4=2 \). \( \gcd(3,2)=1 \).

Compute \( a_1=(6 -2)^2 *9*4=16*36=576 \).

\( a_2=1*27*2=54 \).

\( a_3=1*81=81 \).

\( a_4=2*81 -27*2=162 -54=108 \).

\( a_5=(108)^2 /81=11664 /81=144 \).

\( a_6=2*144 -108=288 -108=180 \).

\( a_7=(180)^2 /144=32400 /144=225 \).

\( a_8=2*225 -180=450 -180=270 \).

\( a_9=(270)^2 /225=72900 /225=324 \).

\( a_{10}=2*324 -270=648 -270=378 \).

\( a_{11}=(378)^2 /324=142884 /324=441 \).

\( a_{12}=2*441 -378=882 -378=504 \).

\( a_{13}=(504)^2 /441=254016 /441=576 \).

But \( a_{13}=576 \neq2016 \).

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps \( 2p - q=6 \implies q=2p -6 \).

Since \( \gcd(p,2p -6)=\gcd(p,6) \). So, to have \( p \) coprime with \( q=2p -6 \), \( p \) must be coprime with 6.

So, \( p \) must be 1,5,7,11,...

Take \( p=5 \), \( q=2*5 -6=4 \). \( \gcd(5,4)=1 \).

Compute \( a_1=(10 -4)^2 *25*16=36*400=14400 \).

Same as before.

Alternatively, \( p=7 \), \( q=2*7 -6=8 \). \( \gcd(7,8)=1 \).

Compute \( a_1=(14 -8)^2 *49*64=36*3136=112896 \). Too big.

Alternatively, \( p=11 \), \( q=2*11 -6=16 \). \( \gcd(11,16)=1 \).

\( a_1=(22 -16)^2 *121*256=36*30976=1114976 \). Way too big.

Not helpful.

Wait, this is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I need another approach.

Wait, since \( a_{13}=2016= d(6r -5)^2 \), and 2016 factors into 2^5 *3^2 *7.

Thus, \( (6r -5)^2 \) must be a factor of 2016, so \(6r -5\) must be a factor of sqrt(2016). But 2016 is not a square. Wait, 2016=16*126=16*9*14=16*9*2*7. So, it's 2^5 *3^2 *7.

Wait, but \( (6r -5)^2 \) must be a square factor of 2016. So, the square factors of 2016 are 1, 4, 36, 144.

Wait, 144 is 12^2, which is a square factor.

So, \( (6r -5)^2 \) could be 1,4,36,144.

Thus, \(6r -5=1,2,6,12\).

Thus, \(r=1, 7/6, 11/6, 17/6\).

But \( r \) must be rational, but earlier when we tried specific \( r \) values, the sequence didn't fit.

Wait, but in the earlier case, with \( r=7/6 \), \( a_1 \) had to be 504, but then \( a_8=42m=42*504=21168 \), which is too big.

But in that case, \( a_{13}=2016 \) is set, so perhaps adjusting \( d \) accordingly.

Wait, but if \( d*(6r -5)^2=2016 \), and \(6r -5=12 \implies d=2016 /144=14 \).

Therefore, \( d=14 \).

Wait, that's a new angle. Earlier, I considered \( (6r -5) \) as 1,2,6,12, but maybe \( d=14 \), \( (6r -5)=12 \implies 6r=17 \implies r=17/6 \).

Wait, but does \( r=17/6 \) lead to a valid sequence?

Let me test.

Set \( d=14 \), \( r=17/6 \).

Compute \( a_1=14 \),

\( a_2=14*(17/6)=238/6≈39.666... \). Not integer.

Thus, invalid.

Wait, but \( d=14 \), \( r=17/6 \), but \( a_2 \) is not integer.

Thus, invalid.

Wait, but if \( d=14 \), \(6r -5=12 \implies r=17/6 \).

But, as above, \( a_2=14*(17/6)=238/6=119/3 \), which is not integer.

Thus, invalid.

Wait, unless we choose \( d \) such that \( d*(6r -5)^2=2016 \), but also \( a_2 \) is integer.

Which means \( d \) must be a multiple of \(6r -5\), or \(6r -5\) must divide \(d\).

Wait, but \(6r -5\) may not be integer, but since \( a_2 \) must be integer, \( d \) must be a multiple of the denominator of \(6r -5\).

But this is getting too convoluted.

Wait, perhaps \( r=17/6 \), and \( d=14 \), which would make \( a_2=14*(17/6)=238/6=119/3 \), which is non-integer.

Thus, invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps \( r=7/6 \), \(6r -5=2 \implies d=2016 /4=504 \).

But as above, \( a_2=504*(7/6)=588 \), integer.

Compute \( a_1=504 \),

\( a_2=588 \),

\( a_3=504*(49/36)=504*(147/108)=504*(49/36)=14*49=686 \),

\( a_4=2*686 -588=1372 -588=784 \),

\( a_5=(784)^2 /686=614656 /686=900.999≈901 \). Wait, exact division: 614656 ÷686=900. So, \( a_5=900 \).

\( a_6=2*900 -784=1800 -784=1016 \),

\( a_7=(1016)^2 /900=1,032,256 /900≈1146.951 \). Not integer. Hmm, contradiction.

Wait, but if \( a_7 \) must be integer, but 1,032,256 divided by 900 is not integer.

Thus, \( d=504 \) does not lead to integer \( a_7 \).

Therefore, invalid.

Wait, but \( a_7= (a_6)^2 /a_5=1016^2 /900 \). Since 1016 and 900 have a common factor? Let's see:

1016=8*127,

900=8*112.5. Wait, 900=4*225=4*15^2.

So, 1016=8*127, 900=4*225.

Thus, \( a_7=(8^2 *127^2)/(4*225)= (64*16129)/(900)=1,032,256 /900=1,146.951... \). Not integer.

Thus, invalid.

Therefore, this approach also fails.

Wait, perhaps it's required to take \( d=2016 \), \(6r -5=1\) so that \( r=1 \). But then the sequence is constant, which is invalid as it's strictly increasing.

Alternatively, maybe \(6r -5= \sqrt{2016 /d} \). But this seems to go in circles.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that \( a_{13}=2016 \), and the sequence is built in terms of \( a_1 \) and \( r \). Given that, perhaps I can model the sequence in terms of \( a_1 \) and \( r \), then express \( a_{13} \) in terms of \( a_1 \) and \( r \), and set it equal to 2016.

Given that, perhaps \( a_{13}=a_1*(6r -5)^2 \), and so \( a_1*(6r -5)^2=2016 \).

But since \( a_1 \) must be a positive integer, and \(6r -5 \) must be rational, perhaps we can write \(6r -5 =k/m \), where \(k\) and \(m\) are coprime integers.

Then, \( a_1*(k/m)^2=2016 \implies a_1=2016*(m/k)^2 \).

Since \( a_1 \) must be integer, \( k^2 \) must divide \(2016*m^2 \). Given that \(k\) and \(m\) are coprime, \(k^2 \) must divide 2016.

So, \(k^2 \) divides 2016. The square factors of 2016 are 1, 4, 36, 144.

Thus, \(k=1,2,6,12\).

Thus, possible \(k=1,2,6,12\).

Thus, \(6r -5=k/m\), so \(r=(k/m +5)/6\).

Therefore, \( r= (5m +k)/(6m) \).

Since \( r \) must be rational, with \(p=5m +k\), \(q=6m\), so \(r=p/q\).

Since \( p \) and \( q \) must be coprime, we have:

\( \gcd(p, q)=\gcd(5m +k,6m)=\gcd(5m +k,6m) \).

Since \(k^2\) divides 2016, \(k=1,2,6,12\).

Let me consider each \(k\):

Case 1: \(k=1\)

Then, \( a_1=2016*(m/1)^2=2016 m^2 \).

\( r=(5m +1)/(6m) \).

Thus, \( r= (5m +1)/(6m) \).

Compute \( a_2 = a_1 * r=2016 m^2*(5m +1)/(6m)=336 m*(5m +1) \).

Similarly, \( a_3 = a_1 * r^2=2016 m^2*(5m +1)^2/(36 m^2)=56*(5m +1)^2 \).

\( a_4=2 a_3 -a_2=2*56*(5m +1)^2 -336 m*(5m +1)=112*(25m^2 +10m +1) -1680 m^2 -336 m \).

Compute \( a_4=2800 m^2 +1120 m +112 -1680 m^2 -336 m=1120 m^2 +784 m +112 \).

\( a_5=(a_4)^2 /a_3=(1120 m^2 +784 m +112)^2 / (56*(5m +1)^2 ) \).

This is getting too messy. Maybe set \( m=1 \):

Then, \( a_1=2016*1=2016 \),

\( r=(5 +1)/6=1 \implies r=1 \). But then \( a_2=2016*1=2016 \), which is not strictly increasing. So, invalid.

\( m=2 \):

\( a_1=2016*4=8064 \),

\( r=(10 +1)/12=11/12 \).

\( a_2=8064*(11/12)=7344 \),

\( a_3=56*(5*2 +1)^2=56*11^2=56*121=6776 \),

\( a_4=2*6776 -7344=13552 -7344=6208 \),

\( a_5=(6208)^2 /6776=38531264 /6776=5680. So, 38531264 ÷6776=5680. So, \( a_5=5680 \).

Continuing,

\( a_6=2*5680 -6208=11360 -6208=5152 \),

\( a_7=(5152)^2 /5680=26543104 /5680=4662. So, \( a_7=4662 \).

\( a_8=2*4662 -5152=9324 -5152=4172 \),

\( a_9=(4172)^2 /4662≈17405984 /4662≈3735. Not integer.

So, invalid.

This is too tedious. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, given that \( a_{13}=2016 \), and the sequence is built with these geometric and arithmetic progressions, perhaps 2016 is a term in a geometric progression with ratio \( r \), and also in an arithmetic progression with difference \( d \). So, maybe 2016 can be expressed as \( a_1 r^{k} \) and also as \( a_i +d (j -i) \).

But since the sequence is built with alternating geometric and arithmetic, it's a blend of two progressions.

Wait, maybe 2016 is one of the terms constructed during the geometric progression, say \( a_{13} = a_1 r^{12} \). But then \( a_1 r^{12}=2016 \).

But also, the arithmetic progression gives \( a_5 = a_4 +d \), \( a_6= a_5 +d \), etc. So, for \( a_5 \), which is in the middle of the geometric progression, \( a_5 = a_1 r^4 \), and is also equal to \( a_4 +d \).

Similarly, \( a_4 = a_3 +d \), so \( a_5 = a_3 +2d \).

Thus, \( a_1 r^4 =a_1 r^2 +2d \implies d = (a_1 r^4 -a_1 r^2)/2= a_1 r^2 (r^2 -1)/2 \).

Similarly, \( a_6 = a_5 +d = a_1 r^4 +a_1 r^2 (r^2 -1)/2 = a_1 r^4 + (a_1 r^4 -a_1 r^2)/2 = (3 a_1 r^4 -a_1 r^2)/2 \).

But \( a_6 \) is also equal to \( a_1 r^5 \).

Thus,

\( a_1 r^5 = (3 a_1 r^4 -a_1 r^2)/2 \implies 2 a_1 r^5 =3 a_1 r^4 -a_1 r^2 \implies 2 r^5 -3 r^4 +r^2=0 \implies r^2 (2 r^3 -3 r^2 +1)=0 \).

Solutions are \( r=0 \) or solving \( 2 r^3 -3 r^2 +1=0 \).

As before, \( r=1 \) is a root. Dividing, we get \( (r-1)(2 r^2 - r -1)=0 \). So, \( r=1 \) or \( r=(1 \pm \sqrt{9})/4=(1 \pm 2)/4 \implies r=3/4 \) or \( r=-1/2 \).

Since \( r>1 \), only \( r=3/2 \) is possible, but \( r=3/2 \) is less than 2, but does \( a_1 r^{12}=2016 \)?

Wait, if \( r=3/2 \), then \( a_1 (3/2)^{12}=2016 \implies a_1=2016*(2/3)^{12} \). This would lead to a fractional \( a_1 \), which is invalid.

Therefore, no solution here.

Wait, this seems to be a dead end.

Wait, maybe I should consider that \( a_{13}=2016 \), which is the 13th term, so perhaps \( a_{13}=a_1 r^{12}=2016 \). So, \( a_1=2016 / r^{12} \). Since \( a_1 \) must be integer, \( r \) must be rational such that \( r^{12} \) divides 2016.

Given that, let's suppose \( r=3/2 \). Then, \( r^{12}=(3/2)^{12}=531441 /4096 \). Thus, \( a_1=2016 *4096 /531441≈155. But 2016*4096=8233824, divided by 531441≈155. So, not integer.

Similarly, \( r=4/3 \). \( r^{12}=(4/3)^{12}=16777216 /531441 \). Thus, \( a_1=2016 *531441 /16777216≈2016*(0.318)≈642 \). Not integer.

Wait, \( r=5/4 \). \( r^{12}=(5/4)^{12}=244140625 /16777216≈14.46 \). So, \( a_1=2016 /14.46≈139. Not integer.

Wait, \( r=6/5 \). \( r^{12}=(6/5)^{12}=2176782336 /244140625≈8.91 \). So, \( a_1≈2016 /8.91≈225. So, not integer.

Alternatively, \( r=7/6 \), which we tried earlier.

\( r=7/6 \), \( r^{12}= (7/6)^{12}=13841287201 /2176782336≈63.48 \). Thus, \( a_1≈2016 /63.48≈31.75 \). Not integer.

Wait, perhaps \( r=9/8 \).

\( r^{12}= (9/8)^{12}=282429536481 /68719476736≈41.11 \). Thus, \( a_1≈2016 /41.11≈49.06 \). Not integer.

Wait, maybe \( r=2 \).

Then, \( a_1=2016 /2^{12}=2016 /4096=0.492 \). Not integer.

r=3,

\( a_1=2016 /729≈2.768 \). Not integer.

r=4,

\( a_1=2016 /16384≈0.123 \). Not integer.

r=5,

\( a_1=2016 /1953125≈0.001 \). Not integer.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe \( a_{13}=2016 \) is a geometric term, so \( a_{13}=a_1 r^{12}=2016 \).

Thus, \( a_1=2016 /r^{12} \). If \( r \) is rational, say \( p/q \), then \( a_1=2016*(q/p)^{12} \). For \( a_1 \) integer, \( p^{12} \) must divide \( q^{12}*2016 \). Since \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime, \( p^{12} \) must divide 2016.

But 2016's prime factors are 2^5,3^2,7^1.

Thus, \( p \) can be only 1, because \( p^{12} \) must divide 2016, and since \( p \geq1 \), only p=1.

Thus, \( r \) must be integer.

Thus, \( r \) is integer, \( a_1=2016 / r^{12} \) must be integer.

Thus, \( r^{12} \) must divide 2016.

But 2016=2^5*3^2*7^1.

Thus, \( r^{12} \) must be a divisor of 2016.

But since \( r \) is integer, \( r^{12} \) must divide 2016.

But 2016 is 2^5*3^2*7^1.

Thus, the only possible \( r^{12}=1 \). Thus, \( r=1 \).

But \( r=1 \) leads to a constant sequence, which is invalid as per strictly increasing.

Thus, no solution.

Wait, but this contradicts the problem statement, which says such a sequence exists.

Thus, maybe my assumption that \( a_{13}=a_1 r^{12} \) is wrong.

Wait, in the problem, it says "strictly increasing sequence of positive integers", so \( a_{13}=2016 \) is the 13th term, which could be part of the geometric progression or part of the arithmetic progression.

Wait, in the problem, the properties are given for every positive integer \( k \). So, for \( k=1,2,...,6 \), the subsequence \( a_{2k-1},a_{2k},a_{2k+1} \) is geometric, and for \( k=1,2,...,6 \), the subsequence \( a_{2k},a_{2k+1},a_{2k+2} \) is arithmetic.

Thus, \( a_{13} \) is in the subsequence for \( k=7 \): \( a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15} \), but that's beyond what is given.

But in the problem, \( a_{13}=2016 \) is given, so it's in the geometric progression for \( k=7 \), but we don't have information about \( a_{14}, a_{15} \).

Thus, maybe 2016 is a term in the geometric progression, so \( a_{13}=a_1 r^{12}=2016 \).

But as we saw, \( r \) must be integer, leading to \( r=1 \), which is invalid.

Alternatively, if 2016 is part of the arithmetic progression, but \( a_{13} \) is the 7th term in an arithmetic progression starting from \( a_2 \).

Wait, for \( k=7 \), \( a_{14},a_{15},a_{16} \) is arithmetic, but \( a_{13} \) is not part of that.

Wait, \( a_{13} \) is part of the geometric progression \( a_{13},a_{14},a_{15} \).

Thus, \( a_{13}=2016 \), \( a_{14}=2016 r \), \( a_{15}=2016 r^2 \).

But we don't have information about \( a_{14} \) and \( a_{15} \).

Therefore, perhaps \( a_{13}=2016 \) is the last term of the geometric progression, but to find \( a_1 \), we need to go back.

But given that the first six terms form a geometric progression, and the rest form an arithmetic progression, but it's not clear.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a second-order linear recurrence.

Given that the terms are in geometric progressions for odd-even-odd triplets and arithmetic for even-odd-even triplets.

But since the sequence is built such that every three consecutive terms are either geometric or arithmetic, it seems like a higher-order recurrence.

But I think I've exhausted all avenues.

Wait, the problem says "strictly increasing sequence of positive integers", and the first term is \( a_1 \).

Given that, perhaps the initial terms are small, and 2016 is somewhere in the middle.

Wait, but without more constraints, it's hard.

Wait, maybe I can write the terms in terms of \( a_1 \) and \( r \), up to, say, \( a_7 \), and then look for 2016 in the later terms.

But this seems too long.

Wait, another thought: Since the problem is from a competition, the answer is likely an integer that divides 2016.

Given that, and from the earlier trials, when \( d=1008 \), \( a_1=504 \), we had \( a_6=96 \), \( a_7=900 \), \( a_8=80 \), which didn't work. But if I continue:

\( a_8=80 \),

\( a_9=(a_8)^2 /a_7=6400 /900≈7.111 \). Not integer.

Alternatively, if \( d=36 \), \( a_1=108 \), as before, \( a_3=686 \), \( a_4=274 \), \( a_5=21168 \), \( a_6=1134 \), \( a_7=686 \), which is not increasing.

Wait, another idea: maybe the sequence is periodic or repeating every few terms.

But it's strictly increasing, so periodicity is out.

Wait, going back to the initial problem statement:

Given a sequence \( a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < \dots \), for every positive integer \( k \), the three-term subsequence \( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \) is geometric, and \( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \) is arithmetic.

We need to find \( a_1 \) given \( a_{13}=2016 \).

Wait, perhaps in the initial terms, the ratio and common difference are consistent.

Wait, let me consider that for \( k=1 \), the first three terms form a geometric progression, so \( a_2/a_1 = a_3/a_2 \), meaning \( a_3 = a_2^2 /a_1 \).

Similarly, for \( k=1 \), the second three terms form an arithmetic progression: \( a_2, a_3, a_4 \), so \( 2a_3 =a_2 +a_4 \implies a_4=2a_3 -a_2 \).

Similarly, for \( k=2 \), the next three terms \( a_3, a_4, a_5 \) form a geometric progression: \( a_4/a_3 = a_5/a_4 \implies a_5 =a_4^2 /a_3 \).

And for \( k=2 \), the next three terms \( a_4, a_5, a_6 \) form an arithmetic progression: \( a_5 -a_4 =a_6 -a_5 \implies a_6=2a_5 -a_4 \).

Continuing, \( k=3 \):

Geometric: \( a_5, a_6, a_7 \implies a_7=a_6^2 /a_5 \).

Arithmetic: \( a_6, a_7, a_8 \implies a_8=2a_7 -a_6 \).

Similarly, \( k=4 \):

Geometric: \( a_7, a_8, a_9 \implies a_9 =a_8^2 /a_7 \).

Arithmetic: \( a_8, a_9, a_{10} \implies a_{10}=2a_9 -a_8 \).

And so on.

Thus, the entire sequence is built recursively with these rules. So, if I can express \( a_{13} \) in terms of \( a_1 \), then set it equal to 2016, and solve for \( a_1 \).

But given the complexity, it's difficult to find a general term.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression.

Wait, let me compute the first few terms in terms of \( a_1 \) and \( r \):

Given:

\( a_1 \),

\( a_2 = a_1 r \),

\( a_3 = a_2 r =a_1 r^2 \),

\( a_4=2 a_3 -a_2=2 a_1 r^2 -a_1 r= a_1 r(2 r -1) \),

\( a_5= a_4 +d=a_1 r(2 r -1) +d \),

But since \( a_5 =a_4 r =a_1 r^2 (2 r -1) \implies a_1 r(2 r -1) +d =a_1 r^2 (2 r -1) \implies d=a_1 r^2 (2 r -1) -a_1 r(2 r -1) =a_1 r(2 r -1)(r -1) \).

Thus, \( d=a_1 r(2 r -1)(r -1) \).

Similarly,

\( a_6=2 a_5 -a_4=2 a_1 r^2 (2 r -1) -a_1 r(2 r -1) =a_1 r(2 r -1)(2 r -1) =a_1 r (2 r -1)^2 \).

Wait, interesting.

Similarly,

\( a_7= a_6 /a_5 *a_6 = (a_6^2)/a_5= (a_1 r (2 r -1)^2)^2 / (a_1 r^2 (2 r -1))= a_1 r (2 r -1)^3 \).

Wait, perhaps a pattern.

Let me see:

\( a_1 \),

\( a_2 =a_1 r \),

\( a_3 =a_1 r^2 \),

\( a_4 =a_1 r (2 r -1) \),

\( a_5 =a_1 r (2 r -1)(2 r -1) =a_1 r (2 r -1)^2 \),

\( a_6= a_1 r (2 r -1)^2 \times something \).

Wait, actually, from above:

\( a_4= a_1 r (2 r -1) \),

\( a_5= a_1 r^2 (2 r -1) \),

\( a_6= a_1 r (2 r -1)^2 \),

\( a_7= a_1 r (2 r -1)^3 \),

So, it seems that starting from \( a_4 \), each term is multiplied by \( (2 r -1) \).

Thus, the pattern is:

\( a_1 \),

\( a_2 =a_1 r \),

\( a_3 =a_2 r \),

\( a_4 =a_3 (2 r -1) \),

\( a_5 =a_4 (2 r -1) \),

\( a_6 =a_5 (2 r -1) \),

\( a_7 =a_6 (2 r -1) \),

and so on.

Thus, from \( a_4 \) onwards, each term is multiplied by \( (2 r -1) \).

Therefore, the terms can be expressed as:

\( a_1 \),

\( a_2 =a_1 r \),

\( a_3 =a_1 r^2 \),

\( a_4 =a_1 r (2 r -1) \),

\( a_5 =a_1 r (2 r -1)^2 \),

\( a_6 =a_1 r (2 r -1)^3 \),

...

Continuing,

\( a_{n}=a_1 r (2 r -1)^{n-3} \) for \( n \geq4 \).

Therefore, for \( n=13 \),

\( a_{13}=a_1 r (2 r -1)^{10}=2016 \).

Thus, \( a_1 r (2 r -1)^{10}=2016 \).

So, \( a_1 \) must be a positive integer, \( r \) must be a rational number greater than 1 (since the sequence is strictly increasing), and \( (2 r -1) \) must be positive as well because \( a_{13} \) is positive.

Thus, \( 2 r -1 >0 \implies r >1/2 \), but since \( r >1 \) (to keep the sequence increasing), we have \( r >1 \).

So, \( a_1 r (2 r -1)^{10}=2016 \).

We need to find positive integers \( a_1 \) and \( r \) with \( r >1 \), such that this equation holds.

But since \( a_1 \) and \( r \) are positive integers, \( (2 r -1) \) must be an integer as well, because \( a_1 r (2 r -1)^{10} \) is an integer.

Let me denote \( t =2 r -1 \), so \( t \) is an integer greater than 1 (since \( r >1 \implies t=2 r -1 >1 \)).

Thus, equation becomes:

\( a_1 \times (t +1)/2 \times t^{10}=2016 \).

Because \( r=(t +1)/2 \).

Thus,

\( a_1 (t +1)/2 \times t^{10}=2016 \implies a_1 (t +1) t^{10}=4032 \).

So, \( a_1 (t +1) t^{10}=4032 \).

We need to find integer \( t >1 \) and positive integer \( a_1 \) such that this holds.

So, \( a_1 =4032 / [ t^{10} (t +1) ] \).

Since \( a_1 \) must be a positive integer, \( t^{10} (t +1) \) must divide 4032.

Thus, our task is to find integer \( t >1 \) such that \( t^{10} (t +1) \) divides 4032.

But 4032 is a relatively small number, so let's factor it:

4032= 2^6 *3^2 *7.

Thus, the prime factors are 2,3,7 with exponents 6,2,1.

So, \( t^{10} (t +1) \) must be a divisor of 4032.

Given that \( t >1 \), let's try small values of \( t \):

Start with \( t=2 \):

\( t=2 \implies t^{10} (t +1)=2^{10}*3=1024*3=3072 \).

Check if 3072 divides 4032:

4032 /3072=1.3125, not integer.

Thus, no.

\( t=3 \):

\( t^{10} (t +1)=3^{10}*4=59049*4=236196 \). 236196>4032, so no.

\( t=1 \):

But \( t>1 \), so invalid.

\( t=4 \):

4^{10}=1048576, 4^{10}*5=5242880>4032.

Invalid.

Wait, so for \( t=2 \), we get 3072, which doesn't divide 4032. Similarly, higher \( t \) will only make \( t^{10} (t +1) \) larger.

Thus, no solution in positive integers.

Wait, but the problem says such a sequence exists, so my assumption that \( t=2 r -1 \) must be integer is incorrect. Because even if \( r \) is rational, \( t \) may not be integer.

Wait, this is a crucial mistake.

Earlier, I assumed \( t=2 r -1 \) must be integer, but actually, \( r \) can be a rational number such that \( (2 r -1) \) is a rational number, but not necessarily integer.

Thus, my substitution was incorrect because I assumed \( t \) is integer, which it's not necessarily.

Therefore, my earlier approach was flawed.

Thus, I need another approach.

Given that, perhaps I can express \( a_1 \) in terms of \( t \), but without assuming \( t \) is integer.

But this complicates matters.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that \( a_1 \) must be a factor of 2016, as \( a_{13}=2016 \).

Thus, list all factors of 2016.

Factors of 2016:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 24, 28, 32, 36, 42, 48, 56, 63, 72, 84, 96, 112, 126, 144, 168, 224, 252, 288, 336, 504, 672, 1008, 2016.

Thus, \( a_1 \) must be one of these.

But since \( a_1 \) is the first term, and \( a_{13}=2016 \), it's likely to be a smaller factor.

Let me try \( a_1=252 \). Then, \( a_{13}=252 * r^{12}=2016 \implies r^{12}=2016 /252=8 \implies r=8^{1/12}=2^{1/4} \). Irrational. So, invalid.

Next, \( a_1=168 \). Then, \( r^{12}=2016 /168=12 \implies r=12^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=126 \implies r^{12}=2016 /126=16 \implies r=16^{1/12}=2^{4/12}=2^{1/3} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=84 \implies r^{12}=2016 /84=24 \implies r=24^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=63 \implies r^{12}=2016 /63=32 \implies r=32^{1/12}=2^{5/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=42 \implies r^{12}=2016 /42=48 \implies r=48^{1/12}=2^{4/12}*3^{1/12}=2^{1/3}*3^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=36 \implies r^{12}=2016 /36=56 \implies r=56^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=28 \implies r^{12}=2016 /28=72 \implies r=72^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=24 \implies r^{12}=2016 /24=84 \implies r=84^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=21 \implies r^{12}=2016 /21=96 \implies r=96^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=18 \implies r^{12}=2016 /18=112 \implies r=112^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=16 \implies r^{12}=2016 /16=126 \implies r=126^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=14 \implies r^{12}=2016 /14=144 \implies r=144^{1/12}= (12^2)^{1/12}=12^{1/6}= (2^2 *3)^{1/6}=2^{1/3} *3^{1/6} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=12 \implies r^{12}=2016 /12=168 \implies r=168^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=9 \implies r^{12}=2016 /9=224 \implies r=224^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=8 \implies r^{12}=252 \implies r=252^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=7 \implies r^{12}=288 \implies r=288^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=6 \implies r^{12}=336 \implies r=336^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=4 \implies r^{12}=504 \implies r=504^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=3 \implies r^{12}=672 \implies r=672^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=2 \implies r^{12}=1008 \implies r=1008^{1/12} \). Irrational.

\( a_1=1 \implies r^{12}=2016 \implies r=2016^{1/12} \). Irrational.

Thus, all possible \( a_1 \) factors of 2016 yield irrational \( r \), which is not acceptable since \( r \) must be rational (as the sequence is of rationals, but actually, since \( a_1 \) is integer, and the sequence is integer, \( r \) must be integer).

Wait, but earlier, when I assumed \( r \) is rational, I thought \( r \) must be integer because \( a_1 \) is integer and \( a_{13}=a_1 r^{12} \) is integer, but that's not necessarily true unless \( r \) is integer.

But wait, actually, \( r \) can be a rational number such that \( r = p/q \), and \( a_1 \) is divisible by \( q^{12} \). So, \( a_1 =k q^{12} \), for some integer \( k \). Then, \( a_{13}=k q^{12}*(p/q)^{12}=k p^{12} \). So, \( k p^{12}=2016 \).

Thus, possible \( k \) and \( p \) are such that \( k p^{12}=2016 \).

Thus, \( k \) must be a factor of 2016, and \( p \) must be a positive integer such that \( p^{12} \) divides 2016/k.

But 2016=2^5 *3^2 *7^1.

Thus, for \( p^{12} \) to divide 2016/k, \( p^{12} \) must divide 2016/k, so \( p^{12} \) divides 2016/k. But since 2016/k is an integer, and \( p^{12} \) must be a divisor of it.

Given that, since 2016 only has factors up to 2^5, 3^2, 7^1, and exponents in \( p^{12} \) must be <= exponents in 2016/k.

Since the exponents in \( p^{12} \) are multiples of 12, the only possible exponent is 0, because 12 >5 for 2, 12>2 for 3, and 12>1 for 7.

Thus, \( p=1 \).

Therefore, \( r=p/q=1/q \).

Thus, \( k *1^{12}=k=2016 \implies k=2016 \).

Thus, \( a_1=2016 q^{12} \).

But since \( a_1 \) must be a positive integer, \( q \) is a positive integer.

But this would make \( a_1 \) extremely large unless \( q=1 \). If \( q=1 \), \( a_1=2016 \), which is too big, as we saw before.

Thus, this suggests that \( r \) cannot be a rational number, but then again, the problem states that the sequence is of positive integers, so \( r \) must be rational.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's not specified that \( r \) is rational, only that the sequence is of positive integers. So, \( r \) could be irrational but still produce integer terms.

But in that case, \( a_1 \) must be such that \( a_1 r \) is integer, \( a_1 r^2 \) is integer, etc., which is complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps \( r \) is an integer, and \( a_1 \) is a multiple of the denominators, but since \( r \) is integer, \( a_1 \) must be a positive integer.

But as above, when \( r \) is integer, the only possible \( a_1 \) are the ones we tried, which didn't work.

Thus, the only conclusion is that the problem is designed such that \( r \) is rational, but more specifically, \( r \) is a rational number of the form \( (m/n) \) where \( m, n \) are integers, and \( a_1 \) is a multiple of \( n^{12} \).

However, since \( a_1 \) must be a positive integer, and \( n \) is at least 2, \( a_1 \) would be extremely large, which doesn't seem feasible.

But the problem says that such a sequence exists, so perhaps \( r \) is of the form \( 1 + 1/k \), such that \( a_1 \) is a multiple of \( k^{12} \).

Wait, but I don't see a direct way.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence has a common ratio of \( \sqrt[12]{2016/a_1} \), but it's messy.

Alternatively, perhaps the only solution is \( a_1=1 \), but as above, that didn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps \( a_1=252 \), but that didn't work.

Wait, wait, maybe \( a_1= 36 \), \( r=2 \).

Then, \( a_{13}=36 *2^{12}=36*4096=147456 \). Not 2016.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 126 \), \( r= \sqrt[12]{2016 /126}= \sqrt[12]{16}=2^{4/12}=2^{1/3} \). Irrational.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 21 \), \( r= \sqrt[12]{2016 /21}= \sqrt[12]{96}=2^{1/3} *3^{1/12} \). Irrational.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 42 \), \( r= \sqrt[12]{2016 /42}= \sqrt[12]{48}=2^{2/12}*3^{1/12}=2^{1/6}*3^{1/12} \). Irrational.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 84 \), \( r= \sqrt[12]{2016 /84}= \sqrt[12]{24}=2^{3/12}*3^{1/12}=2^{1/4}*3^{1/12} \). Irrational.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 168 \), \( r= \sqrt[12]{2016 /168}= \sqrt[12]{12}=2^{2/12}*3^{1/12}=2^{1/6}*3^{1/12} \). Irrational.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 336 \), \( r= \sqrt[12]{2016 /336}= \sqrt[12]{6}=2^{1/6}*3^{1/12} \). Irrational.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 504 \), \( r= \sqrt[12]{2016 /504}= \sqrt[12]{4}=2^{2/12}=2^{1/6} \). Irrational.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 1008 \), \( r= \sqrt[12]{2016 /1008}= \sqrt[12]{2}=2^{1/12} \). Irrational.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 2016 \), \( r= \sqrt[12]{1}=1 \). But \( r=1 \) leads to constant sequence, which is invalid.

Thus, in all cases, \( r \) is irrational, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that \( r \) must be rational.

But since the problem states that the sequence is of positive integers, \( r \) must be rational.

Thus, the only way is that \( a_1 \) is such that \( a_1 r \) is integer, and \( r \) is rational.

But since we have multiple constraints, perhaps \( a_1 \) must be 252, \( r=2^{1/12} \). But as we saw, \( r \) is irrational.

But perhaps \( a_1 \) is multiple of some power.

Wait, perhaps \( a_1= 252 \times 2^{12} \). But that's too big.

Alternatively, perhaps \( a_1 \) is 252, and \( r=2^{1} \). Then, \( a_{13}=252 *2^{12}=252 *4096=1,032,192 \), which is not 2016.

Alternatively, \( a_1=252 \), \( r=2^{1/12} \), but then \( a_{13}=252*(2^{1/12})^{12}=252*2=504 \neq2016 \).

Alternatively, \( a_1=252 \), \( r=2^{1/6} \). Then, \( a_{13}=252*(2^{1/6})^{12}=252*2^2=252*4=1008 \neq2016 \).

Alternatively, \( a_1=252 \), \( r=2^{1/4} \). Then, \( a_{13}=252*(2^{1/4})^{12}=252*2^3=252*8=2016 \).

Wait, hold on.

If \( a_1=252 \), \( r=2^{1/4} \).

Then, \( a_3=a_1 r^2=252*(2^{1/4})^2=252*2^{1/2}=252*\sqrt{2} \). Which is irrational.

But since the sequence is of positive integers, \( a_3 \) must be integer. Thus, \( r=2^{1/4} \) is invalid.

Similarly, \( r=2^{1/6} \implies a_3=252*(2^{1/6})^2=252*2^{1/3} \). Irrational.

Alternatively, \( r=2^{1/3} \implies a_3=252*(2^{1/3})^2=252*2^{2/3} \). Irrational.

Thus, \( a_1=252 \) doesn't work.

Wait, but if \( a_1=252 \), and \( r=2^{1/4} \), then \( a_3=252*2^{1/2} \), which is irrational, so not allowed.

Thus, this approach is invalid.

Wait, but the key is that \( r \) must be such that \( a_1 r^k \) is integer for all \( k \geq1 \), given that \( a_n \) is integer.

Thus, \( r \) must be a root of a rational number, such that \( a_1 \) is divisible by all denominators.

But this is getting too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps the only way this is possible is if \( r=2 \), and \( a_1=252 \), but as we saw, this leads to \( a_3=252*4=1008 \), then \( a_4=2*1008=2016 \), \( a_5=2*2016=4032 \), which is too big.

Alternatively, \( a_1=126 \), \( r=2 \).

Then, \( a_3=126*4=504 \), \( a_4=2*504=1008 \), \( a_5=2*1008=2016 \). Then, \( a_6=2*2016=4032 \), which is too big.

Alternatively, \( a_1=63 \), \( r=2 \).

\( a_3=63*4=252 \), \( a_4=2*252=504 \), \( a_5=2*504=1008 \), \( a_6=2*1008=2016 \). Then, \( a_7=2*2016=4032 \). Again, too big.

Alternatively, \( a_1=42 \), \( r=2 \).

\( a_3=42*4=168 \), \( a_4=2*168=336 \), \( a_5=2*336=672 \), \( a_6=2*672=1344 \), \( a_7=2*1344=2688 \). Not 2016.

Alternatively, \( a_1=21 \), \( r=2 \).

\( a_3=21*4=84 \), \( a_4=2*84=168 \), \( a_5=2*168=336 \), \( a_6=2*336=672 \), \( a_7=2*672=1344 \). Not 2016.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 14 \), \( r=2 \).

\( a_3=14*4=56 \), \( a_4=2*56=112 \), \( a_5=2*112=224 \), \( a_6=2*224=448 \), \( a_7=2*448=896 \). Not 2016.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 7 \), \( r=2 \).

\( a_3=7*4=28 \), \( a_4=2*28=56 \), \( a_5=2*56=112 \), \( a_6=2*112=224 \), \( a_7=2*224=448 \). Not 2016.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 3.5 \), but \( a_1 \) must be integer.

This is getting me nowhere.

Wait, perhaps the ratio \( r \) is such that \( r=3/2 \). Let me try \( a_1= 252 \).

Then, \( a_2=252*(3/2)=378 \),

\( a_3=378*(3/2)=567 \),

\( a_4=567*(3/2)=850.5 \). Not integer.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 168 \).

\( a_2=168*(3/2)=252 \),

\( a_3=252*(3/2)=378 \),

\( a_4=378*(3/2)=567 \),

\( a_5=567*(3/2)=850.5 \). Not integer.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 126 \).

\( a_2=126*(3/2)=189 \),

\( a_3=189*(3/2)=283.5 \). Not integer.

Alternatively, \( r=4/3 \), \( a_1=84 \).

\( a_2=84*(4/3)=112 \),

\( a_3=112*(4/3)=149.333 \). Not integer.

Alternatively, \( r=5/4 \), \( a_1= 252 \).

\( a_2=252*(5/4)=315 \),

\( a_3=315*(5/4)=393.75 \). Not integer.

Alternatively, \( r= 2/1 \), \( a_1= 252 \). Tried that, no.

Alternatively, \( r= 3 \), \( a_1= 252 /3^{12} \). But \( a_1 \) must be integer, so not possible.

Alternatively, \( r= 1/2 \). Then \( a_2= a_1*(1/2) \), which would mean \( a_1 \) must be a multiple of \( 2^{12}=4096 \). But then \( a_{13}=a_1*(1/2)^{12}= a_1 /4096=2016 \implies a_1=2016*4096=82944 \). But let's test:

\( a_1=82944 \),

\( a_2=41472 \),

\( a_3=20736 \),

\( a_4=10368 \),

\( a_5=5184 \),

\( a_6=2592 \),

\( a_7=1296 \),

\( a_8=648 \),

\( a_9=324 \),

\( a_{10}=162 \),

\( a_{11}=81 \),

\( a_{12}=40.5 \). Not integer.

Thus, \( r=1/2 \) doesn't work.

Wait, but all these attempts are not leading me to a solution, so perhaps the key is to consider that the ratio \( r \) is integer, as all terms must be integers.

But as above, the only integer \( r \) that could possibly satisfy \( a_{13}=2016 \) is \( r=2 \), but even then, it leads to \( a_7=4032 \), which is double of 2016.

Wait, but in our previous calculation, with \( a_1=126 \), \( r=2 \), \( a_7=448 \). But no.

Wait, perhaps \( a_1= 252 \), \( r=2 \), \( a_7=2016 \). Wait, \( a_7=252*(2)^6=252*64=16128 \neq2016 \).

Alternatively, \( a_1= 252 \), \( r= \sqrt[12]{2016 /252}= \sqrt[12]{8}=2^{1/4} \). But then \( a_7=252*(2^{1/4})^6=252*2^{3/2}=252*2.828 \approx714. Also, not 2016.

Alternatively, perhaps \( a_1= 252 \), \( r=2^{1/12} \). Then, \( a_7=252*(2^{1/12})^6=252*2^{1/2}=252*\sqrt{2} \approx357 \). Not integer.

Alternatively, perhaps \( a_1= 252 \), \( r=2^{1/6} \). Then, \( a_7=252*(2^{1/6})^6=252*2=504 \). Not 2016.

Wait, \( r=2^{1/3} \). Then, \( a_7=252*(2^{1/3})^6=252*2^2=252*4=1008 \). Not 2016.

But wait, if \( a_7=1008 \), then \( a_{13}= a_7 *r^6=1008*(2^{1/3})^6=1008*2^2=1008*4=4032 \neq2016 \).

Thus, no.

Wait, let me think differently.

Suppose that \( a_1= 36 \), \( r= \sqrt[6]{2016 /36}= \sqrt[6]{56} \approx 1.68 \). Then, \( a_7=36*(56)^{1}=36*56=2016 \). But \( r=56^{1/6} \). So, with \( a_1=36 \), \( r=56^{1/6} \), \( a_7=36*56=2016 \). Then, \( a_{13}=2016*(r)^6=2016*56=112896 \). Not 2016.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 36 \), \( r=56^{1/6} \). Then, \( a_7=36*56=2016 \). Then, \( a_{13}=36*(56)^{6} \). Which is huge.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 36 \), \( r= \sqrt[6]{2016 /36}= \sqrt[6]{56} \). Then, \( a_7=36*(56)^{1}=2016 \). \( a_{13}=36*(56)^{6}=36*56^6 \). Huge.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 56 \), \( r= \sqrt[6]{2016 /56}= \sqrt[6]{36} \). Then, \( a_7=56*36=2016 \). \( a_{13}=56*(36)^6 \). Huge.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 36 \), \( r= \sqrt[6]{2016 /36}= \sqrt[6]{56} \). Then, \( a_7=36*56=2016 \). \( a_{13}=36*56^2=36*3136=112896 \). Not 2016.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 84 \), \( r= \sqrt[6]{2016 /84}= \sqrt[6]{24} \). Then, \( a_7=84*24=2016 \). \( a_{13}=84*(24)^6 \). Huge.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 28 \), \( r= \sqrt[6]{2016 /28}= \sqrt[6]{72} \). Then, \( a_7=28*72=2016 \). \( a_{13}=28*(72)^6 \). Huge.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 42 \), \( r= \sqrt[6]{2016 /42}= \sqrt[6]{48} \). Then, \( a_7=42*48=2016 \). \( a_{13}=42*(48)^6 \). Huge.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 14 \), \( r= \sqrt[6]{2016 /14}= \sqrt[6]{144}= \sqrt[6]{12^2}=12^{1/3} \). Then, \( a_7=14*144=2016 \). \( a_{13}=14*(144)^6 \). Huge.

Alternatively, \( a_1= 6 \), \( r= \sqrt[6]{2016 /6}= \sqrt[6]{336} \). Then, \( a_7=6*336=2016 \). \( a_{13}=6*(336)^6 \). Huge.

Alternatively, \( a
