Question:
Find the roots of $(x - 3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.$

Correct Answer:
Let $a = x - 3$ and $b = x - 7.$  Then we can write the given equation as
\[a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3.\]Expanding, we get $a^3 + b^3 = a^3 + 3a^2 b + 3ab^2 + b^3,$ so $3a^2 b + 3ab^2 = 0,$ which factors as
\[3ab(a + b) = 0.\]Thus, $a = 0,$ $b = 0,$ or $a + b = 0.$  Then $x - 3 = 0,$ $x - 7 = 0,$ or $2x - 10 = 0.$  This gives us the roots $\boxed{3, 5, 7}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this equation to solve: \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I notice that the left side has two cubic terms, and the right side is another cubic term. Maybe if I can simplify both sides, or perhaps factor them somehow, it might become easier to handle. Let me see.

Looking closer, the arguments of the cubes on the left side are \(x - 3\) and \(x - 7\), and on the right side, it's \(2x - 10\). Wait a second, \(2x - 10\) can be factored as \(2(x - 5)\). Similarly, \(x - 3\) and \(x - 7\) are linear terms. Maybe there's a relationship between these terms that I can exploit.

Let me check: if I add \(x - 3\) and \(x - 7\), I get \(2x - 10\), which is exactly the same as the expression inside the cube on the right side. So, \( (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10 \). That's interesting because the sum of the cubes on the left ends up being equal to the cube on the right. 

Hmm, I recall that there's a formula for the sum of cubes: \(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\). But in this case, the sum of the cubes is equal to another cube, so maybe I can use that identity to rewrite the equation?

Let's try that. Let me denote \(a = x - 3\) and \(b = x - 7\). Then, the equation becomes \(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3\). So, substituting in, that's:

\[a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3\]

I can expand the right side using the binomial theorem or just by multiplying it out. Let me do that:

\[(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\]

So, substituting back into the equation:

\[a^3 + b^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\]

If I subtract \(a^3 + b^3\) from both sides, I get:

\[0 = 3a^2b + 3ab^2\]

Which simplifies to:

\[3a^2b + 3ab^2 = 0\]

I can factor out a common term of \(3ab\):

\[3ab(a + b) = 0\]

So, for this product to be zero, either \(3ab = 0\) or \(a + b = 0\). But since 3 is not zero, it simplifies to \(ab(a + b) = 0\).

Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either \(a = 0\), \(b = 0\), or \(a + b = 0\).

Now, recalling that \(a = x - 3\) and \(b = x - 7\), let's write down these conditions:

1. \(a = 0\) implies \(x - 3 = 0\) so \(x = 3\).
2. \(b = 0\) implies \(x - 7 = 0\) so \(x = 7\).
3. \(a + b = 0\) implies \( (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 0 \).

Let's solve the third condition:

\[(x - 3) + (x - 7) = 0\]
Simplify:
\(2x - 10 = 0\)
So, \(2x = 10\), which gives \(x = 5\).

Therefore, the solutions are \(x = 3\), \(x = 5\), and \(x = 7\).

But wait a minute, let me verify these solutions because sometimes when dealing with higher-degree equations, especially cubics, we might introduce extraneous solutions or maybe lose some solutions.

So, let's plug each value back into the original equation to check.

First, testing \(x = 3\):

Left side: \((3 - 3)^3 + (3 - 7)^3 = 0^3 + (-4)^3 = 0 + (-64) = -64\).

Right side: \((2*3 - 10)^3 = (6 - 10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64\).

So, both sides are equal. Good.

Next, testing \(x = 7\):

Left side: \((7 - 3)^3 + (7 - 7)^3 = 4^3 + 0^3 = 64 + 0 = 64\).

Right side: \((2*7 - 10)^3 = (14 - 10)^3 = 4^3 = 64\).

Again, both sides are equal. Good.

Finally, testing \(x = 5\):

Left side: \((5 - 3)^3 + (5 - 7)^3 = 2^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 + (-8) = 0\).

Right side: \((2*5 - 10)^3 = (10 - 10)^3 = 0^3 = 0\).

Both sides are equal as well. So, all three solutions work.

Wait, but hold on. The original equation is a cubic equation, so we should expect up to three real roots, which we've found. So, that seems complete.

But just to make sure, let me expand the original equation and see if it's indeed a cubic equation with these roots.

Starting with the original equation:

\[(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\]

Let me expand each term.

First, expand \((x - 3)^3\):

\[(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\]

Similarly, expand \((x - 7)^3\):

\[(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343\]

So, adding these together:

Left side: \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343)\)

Combine like terms:

\(x^3 + x^3 = 2x^3\)

\(-9x^2 -21x^2 = -30x^2\)

\(27x + 147x = 174x\)

\(-27 -343 = -370\)

So, the left side simplifies to:

\(2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370\)

Now, let's expand the right side: \((2x - 10)^3\)

Using the binomial expansion:

\[(2x - 10)^3 = (2x)^3 - 3*(2x)^2*(10) + 3*(2x)*(10)^2 - (10)^3\]

Compute each term:

\( (2x)^3 = 8x^3 \)

\( -3*(2x)^2*10 = -3*4x^2*10 = -120x^2 \)

\( 3*(2x)*(10)^2 = 3*2x*100 = 600x \)

\( -10^3 = -1000 \)

So, combining these terms:

\(8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000\)

Now, set the left side equal to the right side:

\(2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000\)

Let me bring all terms to one side (subtract the right side from both sides):

\(2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 - 8x^3 + 120x^2 - 600x + 1000 = 0\)

Combine like terms:

\(2x^3 - 8x^3 = -6x^3\)

\(-30x^2 + 120x^2 = 90x^2\)

\(174x - 600x = -426x\)

\(-370 + 1000 = 630\)

So, the equation becomes:

\(-6x^3 + 90x^2 - 426x + 630 = 0\)

I can factor out a common factor of -6:

\(-6(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105) = 0\)

Divide both sides by -6 (which doesn't affect the roots):

\(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0\)

Now, I know that x = 3, 5, 7 are the roots. Let me perform polynomial division or factorization to confirm.

Let me try synthetic division with x = 3:

Coefficients: 1 | -15 | 71 | -105

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1 by 3: 3. Add to -15: -12.

Multiply -12 by 3: -36. Add to 71: 35.

Multiply 35 by 3: 105. Add to -105: 0.

So, the polynomial factors as (x - 3)(x^2 - 12x + 35).

Now, factor the quadratic: x^2 - 12x + 35.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add to -12. Those numbers are -5 and -7.

So, factors as (x - 5)(x - 7).

Therefore, the polynomial factors completely as:

\((x - 3)(x - 5)(x - 7) = 0\)

Which confirms that the roots are indeed x = 3, 5, and 7.

So, this step-by-step process confirms that the solutions I found earlier are correct.

Just to recap, the key insight was recognizing that the sum of the two cube terms on the left equals the cube on the right, leading to an equation that could be factored using the sum of cubes formula. This allowed me to reduce the equation to a product of terms, each of which could be solved individually. Then, verifying each solution by substitution ensured that they were correct, and expanding the original equation led to the same cubic polynomial, which factored into the same roots.

I think that covers all the steps needed to solve the problem. It was a good exercise in applying algebraic identities and verifying solutions through multiple methods.

**Final Answer**
The roots are \(\boxed{3}\), \(\boxed{5}\), and \(\boxed{7}\).
</think>

Given the equation \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\), we start by recognizing that the sum of the cubes on the left side equals the cube on the right side. 

Let \(a = x - 3\) and \(b = x - 7\). The equation becomes:
\[a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3\]

Expanding the right side using the binomial theorem:
\[(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\]

Subtracting \(a^3 + b^3\) from both sides, we get:
\[0 = 3a^2b + 3ab^2\]

Factoring out \(3ab\):
\[3ab(a + b) = 0\]

This gives us three conditions:
1. \(a = 0\) implies \(x - 3 = 0\) so \(x = 3\).
2. \(b = 0\) implies \(x - 7 = 0\) so \(x = 7\).
3. \(a + b = 0\) implies \((x - 3) + (x - 7) = 0\), leading to \(2x - 10 = 0\) and \(x = 5\).

Verifying these solutions by substituting back into the original equation confirms that all three are correct. Additionally, expanding the original equation and simplifying leads to the cubic polynomial:
\[x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0\]

Factoring this polynomial confirms the roots \(x = 3\), \(x = 5\), and \(x = 7\).

Thus, the roots are \(\boxed{3}\), \(\boxed{5}\), and \(\boxed{7}\).
