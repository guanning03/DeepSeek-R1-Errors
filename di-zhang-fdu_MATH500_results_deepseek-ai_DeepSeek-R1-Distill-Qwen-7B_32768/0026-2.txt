Question:
The expression $$1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$$is equivalent to 13. If we add parentheses in various locations, we can change this value. For example, $1+2+3-(4+5)+6=1+2+3-9+6=6-9+6=3$. If we only add parentheses (and not rearrange the order of the terms), what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain? (For the purposes of this problem, we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication. For example, $ (1+2+3)(-4)+5+6 $ is not a valid placement of parentheses.)

Enter your answer as a single value.

Correct Answer:
Because every term before the subtraction sign is added, and addition is associative (parentheses don't matter) placing parentheses on them will not change their value. However, subtraction is not associative. Since we are trying to minimize this expression's value, we want to subtract as much as possible. The expression is thus minimized when parentheses are placed in the following location: $1+2+3-(4+5+6)$. This simplifies to $1+2+3-15 = 6-15=\boxed{-9}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum possible value I can get by adding parentheses to the expression \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\). The catch is, I can't rearrange the order of the terms or change the operations from addition to subtraction or vice versa. I can only add parentheses to change the grouping of the numbers, which can affect the result.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The original expression without any parentheses is \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\), and it's equal to 13. The example given was adding parentheses like \(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6\), which equals 3. So, by changing the grouping, we can get different results. The question is asking for the minimum possible value we can get by strategically placing parentheses.

Since we can't change the order of the terms or the operations, we can only group different parts of the expression together to see how the result changes. My task is to figure out where to place parentheses to make the expression as small as possible.

Let me write down the original expression again:

\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\)

So, the expression has six terms: 1, 2, 3, -4, 5, and 6. All the operations are addition or subtraction. If I add parentheses, I can group some of these terms together, but the operations between them will still be addition or subtraction. Importantly, parentheses can be added around any sub-expression, but we can't rearrange the terms or change the operations.

So, for example, if I group \(1 + 2\) together, that's fine, but I can't make it \(12 + 3\) or anything like that. Similarly, if I group \(4 + 5\), that's okay, but it has to stay as \(4 + 5\), not \(45 + something\).

I think a good approach is to consider how parentheses can affect the result. Since addition is associative, grouping additions together doesn't change the result. So, for example, \(1 + (2 + 3)\) is the same as \(1 + 2 + 3\), which is 6. But subtraction is not associative, so grouping can change the result.

In the example given, \(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6\) results in \(1 + 2 + 3 - 9 + 6\). So, by grouping \(4 + 5\), which is 9, the expression becomes \(1 + 2 + 3 - 9 + 6\). This leads to a smaller result than the original.

So, to minimize the total value, I should try to maximize the subtraction of larger numbers. That is, I should group terms in such a way that larger numbers are being subtracted rather than added, or that their values are reduced before subtracting.

Another way to think about this is to consider that each subtraction operation can potentially reduce the overall sum. So, if I can group certain positive terms together to be subtracted, that might lower the total.

Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a series of additions and subtractions: +1, +2, +3, -4, +5, +6. So, the positive terms are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and the negative term is -4. So, the negative term is only subtracting 4, which is not very large. However, if I can group the negative term with other numbers, especially larger ones, that might have a more significant impact.

Wait, actually, in the original expression, 4 is being subtracted, so if I can group 4 with a larger positive number, subtracting that group would be equivalent to subtracting a larger number, thereby decreasing the total.

For example, in the given example, grouping 4 + 5 as a single term, which becomes 9, so subtracting 9 instead of subtracting 4 and adding 5 separately. So, that's how they get a lower total.

So, perhaps I need to group larger numbers with the negative sign to maximize the subtraction.

But let me think: the expression is \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\). So, all the operations are fixed. So, the negative sign is only on the 4. So, the only way to change the grouping is to include 4 in a group and then subtract that group.

Alternatively, I can group other terms together, but the negative sign is only on 4, so unless I can make 4 part of a larger negative group, it might not help.

Wait, let's think about that. If I group 4 with 5, as in the example, then it's subtracting 9 instead of subtracting 4 and adding 5. So, that's a net change of -9 instead of (-4 + 5) which is +1. So, the total would change by -10, since -9 - (+1) = -10. So, that's why the total goes from 13 to 3.

Alternatively, if I group 3 and 4 together, as in \(1 + 2 + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6\), that would be \(1 + 2 + (-1) + 5 + 6\), which is 13. So, that's the same as before. So, grouping 3 and 4 together doesn't help.

Alternatively, grouping 2 and 3: \(1 + (2 + 3) - 4 + 5 + 6\), which is the same as the original expression, so that's 13.

Wait, so grouping positive terms together doesn't change the result because addition is associative. So, that's not helpful.

But when you group a negative term with a positive term, that can change the result.

Wait, in the example, they grouped 4 and 5 together as \(4 + 5\), which is then subtracted. So, that gives a larger subtraction, thus decreasing the total.

So, perhaps the strategy is to group as many positive terms as possible with the negative term(s) to maximize the subtraction.

In this expression, the only negative term is 4. So, the only way to subtract more than 4 is to group 4 with other positive terms.

But if I group 4 with 5, I get 4 + 5 = 9, so subtracting 9 instead of subtracting 4 and adding 5.

Similarly, if I group 4 with 5 and 6, that would be 4 + 5 + 6 = 15, so subtracting 15 instead of subtracting 4, adding 5, and adding 6. So, let's compute that.

So, grouping 4, 5, and 6 together: \(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6)\). So, that would be \(1 + 2 + 3 - 15\). Compute that: 1 + 2 is 3, 3 + 3 is 6, 6 - 15 is -9. So, the total is -9. That's lower than the previous example's 3.

Wait, so that's better. But is that allowed? Because the group is (4 + 5 + 6), which is subtracted. So, that gives us - (4 + 5 + 6) which is -15, so the total expression is 1 + 2 + 3 - 15, which is indeed -9. So, that's a lower value.

Is this the minimum? Or can I get lower?

Let me see. What if I group more terms?

Wait, but in the original expression, we have 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. If I group 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 as a single group, that would be (1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6. Let me compute that: 1 + 2 is 3, 3 + 3 is 6, 6 - 4 is 2, then 2 + 5 is 7, 7 + 6 is 13. So, that brings us back to 13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 as a group, that would be (1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5) + 6. Let's compute: 1 + 2 is 3, 3 + 3 is 6, 6 - 4 is 2, 2 + 5 is 7, 7 + 6 is 13. Still 13.

Alternatively, grouping 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 as a group: (2 + 3 - 4 + 5) + 1 + 6. Compute: 2 + 3 is 5, 5 - 4 is 1, 1 + 5 is 6, 6 + 1 is 7, 7 + 6 is 13. Still 13.

Wait, so maybe grouping in the middle doesn't help. Let me try grouping 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 as a single group, but that's the entire expression, which is 13.

Alternatively, perhaps grouping 1 + 2 as a group, and then 3 - 4 as another group, and then 5 + 6 as another group, but that would be (1 + 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 + 6). Let's compute that: 3 + (-1) + 11, which is 13 again.

Hmm, same result.

Alternatively, grouping 1 + (2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6. That would be 1 + (1) + 5 + 6, which is 13.

Wait, so maybe the only way to get a lower value is to group the negative term with some positive terms.

Earlier, when I grouped 4 + 5 + 6, that gave me a value of -9, which is lower than the original 13.

Is that the lowest, or can I do better?

Wait, perhaps grouping more terms. Let's see, if I group 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 as follows: (1 + 2 + 3) - (4 + 5 + 6). So, that's 6 - 15, which is -9.

Alternatively, can I group 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 as (1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5) + 6, which is 7 + 6, which is 13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6: as in the original example, that's 6 - 9 + 6, which is 3.

Alternatively, grouping 1 + 2 + (3 - 4 + 5) + 6. Let's compute that: 1 + 2 + (4) + 6, which is 13.

Wait, so 3 - 4 + 5 is 4, so 1 + 2 is 3, plus 4 is 7, plus 6 is 13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 + (2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6: 1 + 1 + 5 + 6 is 13.

Hmm, so it seems that grouping 4 with 5 and 6 gives a lower result, but is there a way to group more terms with 4 to get an even lower result?

Wait, but 4 is only being subtracted, so if I group 4 with as many positive terms as possible, that will make the subtraction larger, thus reducing the total.

But let's see: If I group all the terms after 1, 2, 3, -4, 5, 6 as negative, but that's not possible because the operations are fixed.

Wait, no, actually, the operations are fixed. So, if I have 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6, if I want to group 4, 5, 6 together, but since the operations are fixed, I can only place parentheses around some of them.

Wait, so the expression is 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. So, the operations are: +1, +2, +3, -4, +5, +6. So, the subtraction is only on 4, and the rest are additions.

Therefore, if I want to group 4 with 5 and 6, I have to consider that 4 is being subtracted, so grouping 4,5,6 as (4 + 5 + 6) would make that part subtracted as a group.

So, the expression becomes 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6). Let's compute that:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 - (4 + 5 + 6) = 6 - 15 = -9

So, the total is -9.

Is that the lowest possible? Or can I get lower?

Wait, let's see. What if I group 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 as follows: ((1 + 2) + 3) - (4 + 5 + 6). So, that would be (3 + 3) - 15, which is 6 - 15 = -9. Same result.

Alternatively, can I group more terms with 4? For instance, grouping 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. But wait, that would be (2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6) + 1. Let me compute that: 2 + 3 is 5, 5 - 4 is 1, 1 + 5 is 6, 6 + 6 is 12, 12 + 1 is 13. So, that brings us back to 13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 + (2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6). Let's compute inside the parentheses first: 2 + 3 is 5, 5 - 4 is 1, 1 + 5 is 6, 6 + 6 is 12. Then, 1 + 12 is 13.

So, that doesn't help.

Alternatively, grouping 1 + 2 + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6. Let's compute: 1 + 2 is 3, 3 - 4 is -1, -1 + 5 is 4, 4 + 6 is 10. So, 10. That's better than 13, but not as good as -9.

Alternatively, grouping 1 + (2 + 3 - 4 + 5) + 6. Compute inside the parentheses: 2 + 3 is 5, 5 - 4 is 1, 1 + 5 is 6. Then, 1 + 6 is 7, 7 + 6 is 13.

Alternatively, grouping (1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5) + 6. Compute inside the parentheses: 1 + 2 is 3, 3 + 3 is 6, 6 - 4 is 2, 2 + 5 is 7. Then, 7 + 6 is 13.

So, all these groupings either result in 13, 10, or -9. So, -9 is the lowest so far.

Is there a way to group more terms with 4? Let's see.

Wait, if I group 1 + 2 + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6, that's 1 + 2 + (-1) + 5 + 6, which is 1 + 2 is 3, 3 -1 is 2, 2 +5 is 7, 7 +6 is 13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 + (2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6). Let's compute inside the parentheses: 2 + 3 is 5, 5 - 4 is 1, 1 +5 is 6, 6 +6 is 12. Then, 1 + 12 is 13.

So, that's the same as the original expression.

Alternatively, grouping (1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + (5 + 6). Let's compute: 1 + 2 is 3, 3 + 3 is 6, 6 -4 is 2; 5 +6 is 11. Then, 2 +11 is 13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 + (2 + 3 - 4 + 5) + 6. As before, that gives 13.

Alternatively, grouping (1 + 2 + 3) - (4 + 5 + 6). That's 6 -15, which is -9.

Alternatively, grouping (1 + 2) + (3 - 4 + 5 + 6). Let's compute: 1 + 2 is 3, 3 -4 is -1, -1 +5 is 4, 4 +6 is 10. Then, 3 +10 is 13.

Alternatively, grouping (1 + 2 + 3 -4) + (5 +6). 1+2 is 3, 3+3 is 6, 6-4 is 2; 5+6 is 11. 2 +11 is 13.

So, seems like the only way to get a lower value is to group 4 with 5 and 6 as a negative group, giving us -9. So, is -9 the minimum?

Wait, can we group 4 with more terms? Like, group 1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5 +6 as follows: 1 + (2 + 3 -4 +5 +6). But that is 1 + (2 + 3 -4 +5 +6). Let's compute inside the parentheses: 2 +3 is 5, 5 -4 is 1, 1 +5 is 6, 6 +6 is 12. Then, 1 +12 is 13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 + (3 -4 +5 +6). Compute inside the parentheses: 3 -4 is -1, -1 +5 is 4, 4 +6 is 10. Then, 1 +2 is 3, 3 +10 is 13.

Alternatively, grouping (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6. Compute inside: 1+2=3, 3+3=6, 6-4=2, 2+5=7. Then, 7+6=13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 + (2 +3 -4) +5 +6. Compute inside: 2+3=5, 5-4=1. Then, 1+1=2, 2+5=7, 7+6=13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 + (3 -4 +5) +6. Compute inside: 3-4=-1, -1 +5=4. Then, 1+2=3, 3+4=7, 7+6=13.

So, in all these cases, the total is either 13 or -9.

Wait, so -9 is achievable, but is that the minimum?

Alternatively, what if I group 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5) +6. That was the example. It gives 6 -9 +6=3.

Alternatively, is there a way to group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as ((1 +2) +3) -4 +5 +6. Compute: 1+2=3, 3+3=6, 6-4=2, 2+5=7, 7+6=13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 + (2 +3 -4 +5) +6. Compute: 2+3=5, 5-4=1, 1+5=6, 6+1=7, 7+6=13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 + (3 -4 +5) +6. Same as above.

Alternatively, grouping 1 + (2 +3 -4) +5 +6. Same as before.

Alternatively, grouping (1 +2 +3 -4) +5 +6. 1+2+3=6, 6-4=2, 2+5=7, 7+6=13.

So, all groupings that don't group 4 with other terms result in 13, and the only way to get a lower result is to group 4 with 5 and 6, giving us -9.

Wait, but wait, could I group 4 with 5 and 6 in a different way?

For example, instead of grouping (4 +5 +6), could I group (4 +5) as a negative term? Wait, that's what was done in the example.

Alternatively, is there a way to group more terms with 4?

Wait, 4 is in between 3 and 5. So, if I can group 3,4,5 together, but since 4 is only in the subtraction, grouping 3 +4 +5 would be subtracting 3 +4 +5, which is 12. So, subtracting 12 instead of subtracting 4, adding 5, and adding 6.

Wait, let's see.

Wait, the original expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

If I group 3 -4 +5 as a group, that is (3 -4 +5) which is 4, and then add 1 +2 and 6. So, that gives 1 +2 +4 +6, which is 13.

Alternatively, if I group 3 +4 +5 as a group, that is (3 +4 +5) which is 12, and then subtract that. So, the expression becomes 1 +2 -12 +6. Compute that: 1+2=3, 3-12=-9, -9 +6=-3. So, that gives us -3.

Wait, that's different. So, if I group 3 +4 +5 as a group, making it subtracted, so the expression becomes 1 +2 - (3 +4 +5) +6.

Compute that: 1 +2 is 3, 3 - (12) is -9, -9 +6 is -3.

Wait, but that's different from grouping 4 +5 +6.

Wait, so in this case, grouping 3 +4 +5 gives a higher negative impact, but only subtracting 12 instead of adding 3, subtracting 4, adding 5, and adding 6, which was 3 -4 +5 +6=10. So, previously, it was 10, now it's -9.

Wait, so in the original grouping, 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 is 13, but when you group 3 +4 +5 as a single group, subtracted, you get 1 +2 -12 +6= -3. That's actually a better result than -9.

Wait, that's a lower value than -9, so that's -3, which is better.

But is that allowed? Because in the original expression, the operations are fixed: +1, +2, +3, -4, +5, +6.

So, can we group 3 +4 +5 as a single group, which would require changing the operations between them?

Wait, no, because the operations are fixed. So, if I have 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6, the operations are fixed as addition between 1,2,3; subtraction before 4; addition after 4,5,6.

So, if I group 3 +4 +5, I have to consider that the operations between 3 and 4, and 4 and 5 are fixed. So, 3 is added to 4, which is subtracted, which is added to 5.

Wait, but that might not make sense because 3 is added, 4 is subtracted, and 5 is added.

So, is that possible? Or, do you have to group 3,4,5 with their operations intact?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think.

In the original expression, the operations between the numbers are fixed: between 1 and 2 is addition, 2 and 3 is addition, 3 and 4 is addition, 4 and 5 is subtraction, 5 and 6 is addition.

Wait, no, actually, in the original expression, it's 1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5 +6.

So, the operations are: after 1 is +2, after 2 is +3, after 3 is -4, after 4 is +5, after 5 is +6.

Therefore, the operations are fixed between the numbers. So, if I group 3 +4 +5, I would have to change the operation between 3 and 4 from addition to subtraction? Or, is it allowed?

Wait, no, because the operations are fixed. So, you can't change the operation between 3 and 4 from addition to subtraction. So, grouping 3 +4 +5 is not possible because the operations between 3 and 4 is addition, and between 4 and 5 is addition as well.

Wait, no, because in the original expression, 3 is added to 4, and 4 is subtracted. So, the expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

So, the problem is that the operations are fixed. So, 3 is added to 4, but 4 is subtracted.

Therefore, grouping 3 +4 +5 would require changing the operations, which is not allowed.

So, in that case, we can't group 3 +4 +5 as a single group because that would require changing the operations between 3 and 4, and 4 and 5.

Therefore, that grouping is not permissible.

Therefore, perhaps the only permissible groupings are those that don't require changing the existing operations.

So, for example, if I group 4 +5 +6, I have to group them as a single group, but the operations between 4,5,6 are fixed: 4 is subtracted, 5 is added, 6 is added.

Wait, no, in the grouping, the operations are fixed, so 4 is subtracted, 5 is added, 6 is added.

Wait, so when grouping 4 +5 +6, it's actually 4 +5 +6, but in the original expression, 4 is subtracted, 5 is added, and 6 is added.

Wait, so in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. So, the operations are: +1, +2, +3, -4, +5, +6. So, to group 4 +5 +6 as a single group, we need to have 4 +5 +6 as a positive group, but in the original expression, 4 is subtracted.

Therefore, grouping 4 +5 +6 would actually result in subtracting (4 +5 +6), which is subtracting 15.

So, the expression becomes 1 +2 +3 -15, which is 6 -15 = -9.

Alternatively, can I group 4 with 5 and 6, but as a negative group? Wait, but the operations are fixed.

Wait, so in the original expression, after 3 is a subtraction before 4, then +5, then +6.

So, if I group 4 +5 +6 as a group, that would be subtracted as a group.

So, the expression becomes 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6). Which is 6 -15, which is -9.

Alternatively, can I group 4 with 5 as a group? So, 4 +5, but in the original expression, 4 is subtracted, 5 is added. So, grouping 4 +5 as a group would be subtracting (4 +5) = -9.

So, the expression becomes 1 +2 +3 -9 +6.

Compute that: 1 +2 is 3, 3 +3 is 6, 6 -9 is -3, -3 +6 is 3.

So, that's the example given.

Alternatively, grouping 4 +5 is subtracted as a group, which is (4 +5)=9, so subtract 9, which gives the same as above.

So, grouping 4 +5 is subtracted as a group, leading to 3.

Alternatively, grouping 4 +5 +6 is subtracted as a group, leading to -9.

So, since we can group 4 +5 +6 as a single group, which is subtracted as a group, leading to -9, which is lower than 3.

Is that the lowest?

Wait, but can we group 3 +4 +5 as a group? Let's see.

But as I thought earlier, in the original expression, the operations between 3 and 4 is addition, 4 and 5 is addition, but in the expression, 4 is subtracted.

So, grouping 3 +4 +5 as a group is not permissible because in the original expression, 4 is subtracted.

Therefore, that grouping is invalid.

Similarly, grouping 2 +3 +4 as a group would require changing the operations, which is not allowed.

So, the only permissible groupings are those that group consecutive numbers with their fixed operations.

Therefore, in this case, the only way to get a lower value is to group 4 +5 +6 as a single group, subtracted, leading to 1 +2 +3 -15, which is -9.

Wait, but is there a way to group 1 +2 +3 -4 as a group?

Yes, but that group is added as a group. So, (1 +2 +3 -4) +5 +6. Compute that: 1 +2 is 3, 3 +3 is 6, 6 -4 is 2. Then, 2 +5 is 7, 7 +6 is 13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a group: (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6. Compute: 1 +2 is 3, 3 +3 is 6, 6 -4 is 2, 2 +5 is 7. Then, 7 +6 is 13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a group: (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6) which is 13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 as a group, which is 2, then adding 5 and 6: 2 +5 +6=13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a group, which is 7, then adding 6: 7 +6=13.

So, all groupings that don't group 4 with others just result in 13.

But if I group 4 +5 +6 as a group, subtracted, that gives me -9, which is lower.

So, that seems to be the lowest possible.

Wait, but let me see if I can get even lower.

Wait, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a group: 1 +2 +3 -4 +5=7, then 7 +6=13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a group: 13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6) as a group: 1 +2 +3 -15=-9.

Is there a way to group more terms with 4?

Wait, 4 is in the middle of the expression. So, if I group 3 +4 +5, but as we saw, that's not allowed because in the original expression, 4 is subtracted.

So, perhaps we can't group 3 +4 +5 because of the fixed operations.

Alternatively, can I group 2 +3 +4 +5 as a group? Let's see. But in the original expression, 2 +3 is addition, 3 is added, 4 is subtracted, 5 is added. So, grouping 2 +3 +4 +5 would require changing the operations, which is not allowed.

Therefore, that's not permissible.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group: 1 +2 +3 +4=10, then subtract 5 +6=11, so 10 -11= -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So, if I group 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, which is 10, and then subtract 5 +6=11. So, 10 -11= -1.

Wait, but is that allowed? Because in the original expression, 1 +2 +3 +4 is followed by -5 +6.

So, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 would make it a positive group, and then subtracting 5 +6.

So, the expression becomes (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6). Compute that: 1 +2=3, 3 +3=6, 6 +4=10. Then, 5 +6=11. So, 10 -11= -1.

Wait, that's different.

Wait, so if I group 1 +2 +3 +4 together, subtracting (5 +6), that gives me -1.

Is that allowed?

Wait, in the original expression, the operations are fixed. So, 1 +2 +3 +4 is addition, then -5, then +6.

So, is grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a single group permissible? Because in the original expression, that part is just addition; so grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a single group would mean that the operations after that group would remain as is.

So, in effect, you're grouping the first four terms as a single positive group, then subtracting 5 +6.

So, that's allowed because you're not changing any operations. You're just grouping consecutive terms.

Therefore, that would be permissible.

So, in that case, the expression becomes (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6). So, 10 -11= -1.

Wait, that's lower than -9.

So, that's a better result.

But is that right?

Wait, let me verify.

Compute (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6):

1 +2=3, 3 +3=6, 6 +4=10. Then, 5 +6=11. So, 10 -11= -1.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, that's a lower value than -9. So, -1 is lower than -9.

So, that's better.

So, is that allowed?

Yes, because you're grouping consecutive terms with their existing operations.

So, the expression is 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 -6, but grouped as (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6).

So, that's permissible.

Therefore, the total is -1.

Wait, so that's even lower. So, is -1 the minimum?

Wait, let's see.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6.

So, (1 +2 +3 +4 +5) -6. That is 15 -6=9. So, that's higher.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 as a group, adding 6. So, (1 +2 +3 +4 -5) +6. Compute: 1 +2=3, 3 +3=6, 6 +4=10, 10 -5=5. Then, 5 +6=11. So, that's 11.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6 as a group: 1 +2=3, 3 +3=6, 6 +4=10, 10 -5=5, 5 +6=11. So, that's 11.

So, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 together with -5 and +6 gives 11.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 as a single group: 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6=21.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6: which is (10) - (11)= -1.

So, that's the lowest so far.

Is there a way to group more terms with 4?

Wait, perhaps grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6: which is (15) -6=9.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5, adding 6: which is 10 -5 +6=11.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 as a single group: 21.

So, the only grouping that gave me -1 is grouping the first four terms as a group, subtracting the last two terms as a group.

So, is -1 the minimum? Or can I go lower?

Wait, let's try grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 as follows: group 1 +2 +3 +4 as a positive group, group 5 +6 as a negative group.

Which is exactly what we did, giving us -1.

Alternatively, is there a way to group more terms with negative impact?

Wait, if I group 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6: 15 -6=9.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6: 10 -11= -1.

So, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 as a group, adding 6: 5 +6=11.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6: 11.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6: -1.

So, seems like -1 is the lowest.

Wait, but let me see.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 as follows: group 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 as a positive group, subtracting 6. So, 15 -6=9.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 as a group: 21.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 +4 as a positive group, subtracting 5 +6: 10 -11= -1.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6 as a group: 11.

So, -1 is the lowest.

Wait, is there a way to group 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6? 15 -6=9, which is higher than -1.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6: 10 -11= -1.

Alternatively, group 1 as a group, 2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6: 1 - (2 +3 +4 +5) +6. Let's compute: 1 -14 +6= -7.

Wait, that's lower than -1.

Wait, is that allowed? Because in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6. So, grouping 2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6. But in the original expression, the operations are 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6.

So, if I group 2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, then I have 1 + [2 +3 +4 +5] -6.

Compute: 2 +3=5, 5 +4=9, 9 +5=14. So, 1 +14=15, 15 -6=9.

Wait, but that's not -7.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, if I group 2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6, so the expression becomes 1 + [2 +3 +4 +5] -6. So, that is 1 +14 -6=9, as above.

Wait, so that's not -7.

Alternatively, grouping 2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, but subtracting that group as a whole.

But in the original expression, 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6, if I group 2 +3 +4 +5 as a single group, the expression becomes 1 + [2 +3 +4 +5] +6. So, 1 +14 +6=21.

Alternatively, is there a way to subtract that group?

Wait, no, because the operations are fixed: after 1, it's +2, then +3, +4, +5, +6.

So, you can't subtract a group unless you have a subtraction operator before the group.

Wait, but in the original expression, after 1, it's +2, +3, +4, +5, +6, so all additions.

Therefore, to subtract a group, you need a subtraction operator before the group.

But in the original expression, the only subtraction operator is before 4.

Therefore, perhaps I cannot subtract any group unless I have a subtraction operator before.

Therefore, the only permissible subtractions are at the original subtraction operator before 4, and any grouping that includes 4 can be subtracted as a group.

So, in that case, grouping 4 +5 +6 as a group, subtracted, gives -9.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracted 5 +6, gives -1.

Alternatively, grouping 2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracted 6, but that's not allowed because you don't have a subtraction operator before that group.

Therefore, such a grouping isn't permissible.

Therefore, the only permissible subtractions are at the original operator before 4, or groupings that include 4 as a single group.

Therefore, the only way to get a lower value is to group 4 +5 +6 as a group, subtracted, leading to -9, or grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6, leading to -1.

Therefore, between these two, -1 is lower than -9.

Wait, so -1 is lower.

Alternatively, is there a way to group 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6, which is 15 -6=9.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6=11, which is 10 -11=-1.

So, that's better.

Is there a way to group 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6, but that gives 9, which is higher.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6: 10 -11= -1.

Alternatively, is there a way to group 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 with more negative terms?

Wait, no, because the only subtraction is before 4.

Therefore, any grouping that includes 4 must either include it as a single term or as part of a group that is subtracted.

Therefore, the minimum possible is -1.

Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, is there a way to group 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6: 15 -6=9.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 as a group: 21.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6: 10 -11= -1.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6: 11.

So, the only way to get a lower value is to group 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6: 10 -11= -1.

So, is that the minimum?

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6: that gives us -1.

Alternatively, is there a way to subtract 5 and add 6 as a group?

Wait, but in the original expression, 5 is subtracted, 6 is added.

So, if I group 5 +6 as a group, then the expression becomes 1 +2 +3 +4 - (5 +6). So, 10 -11= -1.

Alternatively, if I group 5 as a single term, and 6 as a single term, it's the same as 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6=11.

Alternatively, grouping 5 as a single term, subtracting 6: 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 -6= -1.

Wait, so if I group 6 as a single term, subtracting it, then the expression becomes 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 -6.

Compute that: 1 +2=3, 3 +3=6, 6 +4=10, 10 -5=5, 5 -6= -1.

So, that's the same as grouping 5 +6 as a group.

So, that is equivalent.

Therefore, the only way to get -1 is to group 5 and 6 as a group, subtracting them, either as (5 +6) or as separate terms.

Wait, but grouping 5 +6 as a group is subtracted, leading to -11, but in the expression, 5 is subtracted, 6 is added.

So, grouping 5 +6 as a group is equivalent to subtracting (5 +6)=11, so 10 -11= -1.

Alternatively, subtracting 5 and adding 6 is the same as grouping 5 as a single term, subtracting 5, and adding 6.

Which is 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6=11.

So, that is different.

So, grouping 5 +6 as a group is subtracted, leading to -1.

Alternatively, grouping 5 and 6 separately, subtracting 5 and adding 6, leads to 11.

Therefore, grouping 5 +6 as a group, subtracted, is better for minimizing.

So, that's the same as grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6.

Therefore, both groupings lead to -1.

Alternatively, is there a way to group 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6: 15 -6=9.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6: 10 -11=-1.

So, in that case, -1 is lower.

Therefore, the minimum possible value is -1.

Wait, but let me just make sure.

Wait, is there a way to group 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, and then group 5 +6 as a group, and subtract the second group from the first group.

So, (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6)=10 -11=-1.

Alternatively, is that allowed? Because in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6.

So, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, which is addition, then subtracting 5 +6 as a group.

So, is that permissible?

Yes, because the operations are fixed: in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6. So, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group is allowed because it's consecutive additions.

Then, subtracting 5 +6 as a group is allowed because the subtraction is a single operator before 5.

So, that grouping is permissible.

Therefore, the total is -1.

So, that's lower than the previous grouping.

Therefore, I think -1 is the minimum possible.

Wait, but hold on, let me think again.

Wait, when I group 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, the expression becomes (1 +2 +3 +4) -5 +6.

But in this grouped version, the operations are: after grouping, you have (1 +2 +3 +4) -5 +6.

Which is 10 -5 +6=11.

Wait, that's different from before.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting (5 +6), is equivalent to (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6).

Which is 10 -11= -1.

But in the expression, if I group 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, it's (1 +2 +3 +4) -5 +6.

Wait, that is different.

Wait, because in the original expression, after the group, it's -5 +6.

So, in the grouped version, if I group 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6, then the expression is (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6).

Which is 10 -11= -1.

But in the expression, if I group 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, then the rest is -5 +6. So, is that equivalent to subtracting (5 +6)?

Wait, because in the original expression, after the group, it's -5 +6. So, if I group 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, then I have [1 +2 +3 +4] -5 +6.

But in order to subtract (5 +6), that would require grouping 5 +6 as a group as well.

Wait, but in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6.

So, to group 5 +6, you have to group them together as a single group, which is subtracted as a group.

Wait, but in the original expression, 5 is subtracted, 6 is added.

So, if I group 5 +6 as a group, then it's subtracting (5 +6)=11.

So, the expression becomes 1 +2 +3 +4 - (5 +6)=10 -11= -1.

Alternatively, if I group 5 as a single term, subtracting 5, and 6 as a single term, adding 6, then it's 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6=11.

Therefore, grouping 5 +6 as a group, subtracted, is equivalent to subtracting 11, leading to -1.

Alternatively, grouping 5 as a single term, subtracting 5, and 6 as a single term, adding 6, is different.

So, in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6.

So, to group 5 +6 as a group, it's 1 +2 +3 +4 - (5 +6)= -1.

Alternatively, grouping 5 as a single term, subtracting 5, and 6 as a single term, adding 6, is 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6=11.

So, that's different.

Wait, so in order to get -1, you need to group 5 +6 as a group, subtracting them.

But in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6, so grouping 5 +6 as a group is subtracted.

So, the grouping is permissible because the operations are fixed: the subtraction is before 5, and 6 is added.

So, grouping 5 +6 as a group is allowed because the operations between 5 and 6 are fixed as addition.

Wait, no, in the original expression, 5 is subtracted, 6 is added. So, grouping 5 +6 as a group is not a fixed operation, because the 5 is subtracted, 6 is added.

Therefore, is grouping 5 +6 as a group permissible?

Wait, in the original expression, the operations are: after 4, it's -5, then +6.

So, grouping 5 +6 as a group would require changing the operations, which is not allowed.

Therefore, is that permissible?

Wait, because in the original expression, 5 is subtracted, 6 is added. So, if I group 5 +6 as a group, it's not a fixed operation, since 5 is subtracted and 6 is added.

Therefore, that grouping is not permissible.

Wait, so perhaps grouping 5 +6 as a group is not allowed because it would require changing the operations.

Therefore, I can't group 5 +6 as a group because the original operations are fixed.

Therefore, the only permissible groupings are those that follow the original operations, i.e., 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6.

Therefore, if I group 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, the expression is [1 +2 +3 +4] -5 +6.

Which is 10 -5 +6=11.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6: but since 5 +6 can't be grouped as a group because the operations are fixed, that's not allowed.

Therefore, the only permissible grouping is [1 +2 +3 +4] -5 +6=11.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5, adding 6: which is 10 -5 +6=11.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6: 15 -6=9.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6: but that's not allowed as 5 +6 is not a fixed group.

Therefore, the only permissible grouping that affects the total is grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, which gives us 10 -5 +6=11.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6: 15 -6=9.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 as a group: 21.

Alternatively, grouping 2 +3 +4 +5 as a group: 14, then subtracting 6: 14 -6=8.

Wait, but in the original expression, the operations are 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6, so grouping 2 +3 +4 +5 as a group is allowed, as in the original expression, the operations between those are additions.

Therefore, grouping 2 +3 +4 +5 as a group: 14, then subtracting 6: 14 -6=8.

Wait, so that's another permissible grouping.

So, if I group 2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, which is 14, then subtract 6, which is 14 -6=8.

So, that's a permissible grouping.

Similarly, grouping 3 +4 +5 as a group: 12, then subtract 6: 12 -6=6.

Alternatively, grouping 4 +5 as a group:9, then subtract 6:9 -6=3.

Alternatively, grouping 5 as a group:5, subtract 6:5 -6=-1.

Wait, so if I group 5 as a group, subtracting 6:5 -6=-1.

But in the original expression, 5 is subtracted, 6 is added. So, grouping 5 as a group, subtracting 6: is that allowed?

In the original expression, the operations are fixed. So, if I group 5 as a group, subtracting 6, that would require changing the operation between 5 and 6 from addition to subtraction.

Which is not allowed.

Therefore, grouping 5 as a group, subtracting 6 is not permissible.

Therefore, that grouping is invalid.

Similarly, grouping 4 as a group:4, subtract 5:4 -5=-1, but then you still have +6.

Wait, but that would require grouping 4 as a group, subtracting 5, then adding 6.

So, the expression becomes 1 +2 +3 + (4 -5) +6.

Which is 1 +2 +3 -1 +6=11.

Which is the same as previous groupings.

So, that grouping is permissible.

Wait, let me check.

The original expression is 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6.

If I group 4 as a group, subtracting 5, then adding 6.

But wait, the operations are fixed: after 4, it's -5, then +6.

So, grouping 4 -5 as a group is permissible.

So, the expression becomes 1 +2 +3 + (4 -5) +6.

Which is 1 +2 +3 -1 +6=11.

Alternatively, grouping 4 as a group, subtracting 5 and adding 6.

But that's the same as grouping 4 -5 as a group, then adding 6.

So, 1 +2 +3 + (4 -5) +6=11.

Alternatively, grouping 4 -5 as a group, subtracting that group, and adding 6.

Wait, but in the original expression, 4 -5 is a group, which is subtracted, then adding 6.

So, the expression becomes 1 +2 +3 - (4 -5) +6.

Wait, that is different.

Wait, in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6.

So, if I group 4 -5 as a group, then you have 1 +2 +3 + (4 -5) +6.

Which is 1 +2 +3 -1 +6=11.

Alternatively, grouping 4 -5 as a group, subtracted from the rest.

Wait, but the expression is 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6.

So, grouping 4 -5 as a group, subtracted from the rest: 1 +2 +3 - (4 -5) +6.

Wait, that would be 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6=11.

Wait, so it's same as before.

Alternatively, grouping 4 -5 as a group, subtracting that group: 1 +2 +3 - (4 -5) +6=11.

Alternatively, grouping 4 -5 as a group, subtracted: 1 +2 +3 - (4 -5) +6=11.

Alternatively, grouping 4 -5 as a group, subtracted, and then adding 6: same as 11.

Alternatively, grouping 4 as a group, subtracting 5, and adding 6: same as 11.

So, in that case, grouping 4 -5 as a group, subtracting that group, and then adding 6, leads to 11.

Alternatively, grouping 5 as a group, subtracting 6:5 -6=-1.

But in the original expression, that's not allowed because 5 is subtracted and 6 is added.

Therefore, grouping 5 as a group, subtracting 6 is not permissible.

Therefore, the only permissible way to group 5 is with other terms, but that leads to higher totals.

Therefore, going back, the only permissible groups that lead to lower totals are:

- Grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5 +6: but since 5 +6 can't be grouped as a group because the operations are fixed, that's not allowed.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, if 5 +6 can't be grouped as a group, then grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5, adding 6 is 10 -5 +6=11.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5, adding 6: 11.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting (5 +6): but since 5 +6 can't be grouped as a group, that's not allowed.

Therefore, the only permissible groups that affect the total are:

- Grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group, subtracting 5, adding 6: total 11.

- Grouping 2 +3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6: 14 -6=8.

- Grouping 3 +4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6: 12 -6=6.

- Grouping 4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6:9 -6=3.

- Grouping 5 as a group, subtracting 6:5 -6=-1, but since 5 is subtracted, 6 is added, this is not permissible.

Wait, but grouping 4 +5 as a group, subtracting 6: is that allowed?

In the original expression, 4 is added, 5 is subtracted, 6 is added.

So, if I group 4 +5 as a group, which is added, then subtracting 6.

So, the expression becomes 1 +2 +3 + (4 +5) -6.

Compute that: 1 +2=3, 3 +3=6, 6 +9=15, 15 -6=9.

So, that's allowed.

Therefore, that gives 9.

Similarly, grouping 2 +3 +4 +5 as a group:14 -6=8.

Grouping 3 +4 +5 as a group:12 -6=6.

Grouping 2 +3 +4 +5 as a group:14 -6=8.

Grouping 1 +2 +3 +4 as a group:10 -5 +6=11.

So, in that case, the lowest value we've found is -1, but that was from grouping 5 as a group, subtracting 6, but that's not allowed.

Wait, but perhaps grouping 5 and 6 as separate terms, subtracting and adding: that is, 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6=11.

Alternatively, grouping 5 and 6 as a group, subtracted: but in the original expression, 5 is subtracted, 6 is added, so grouping 5 +6 as a group is subtracting 11, which would be different.

Wait, but in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6.

So, if I group 5 +6 as a group, it's 1 +2 +3 +4 - (5 +6).

Which is 10 -11=-1.

But in the original expression, 5 is subtracted, 6 is added.

Therefore, grouping 5 +6 as a group is subtracting 11, which is different.

But in the original expression, 5 is subtracted, 6 is added, which is 11.

Wait, no, 5 is subtracted, 6 is added, so 5 +6 is 11, but 5 is subtracted, 6 is added, so the total is 11.

Wait, no, 5 is subtracted, 6 is added, so 5 +6=11, but 5 is subtracted, so 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6=11.

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, 1 +2 +3 +4=10, -5=5, +6=11.

Wait, so in that case, grouping 5 +6 as a group is subtracted, leading to 10 -11=-1.

But in the original expression, 5 is subtracted, 6 is added.

Therefore, grouping 5 +6 as a group is a different operation.

Wait, so to clarify:

- Original expression: 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6=11.

- Grouping 5 +6 as a group: (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6)=10 -11=-1.

- Grouping 5 as a group: 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6=11.

- Grouping 6 as a group: same as above.

Therefore, grouping 5 +6 as a group is permissible because the operations are fixed: in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 +4 -5 +6.

So, grouping 5 +6 as a group is subtracted as a group.

Therefore, the expression becomes (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6)=10 -11=-1.

So, that is a permissible grouping.

Therefore, the total is -1.

Therefore, the minimum possible value is -1.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-1}.

**Final Answer**
The minimum possible value is \boxed{-1}.
</think>

To find the minimum possible value of the expression \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\) by adding parentheses, we need to consider permissible groupings of the terms. The key is to group terms in such a way that we can minimize the overall value.

1. The original expression is \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\).
2. We can group terms by placing parentheses, but we must follow the original operations (addition and subtraction) between the terms.

First, we consider grouping the terms before 4 as a single group:
- Grouping \(1 + 2 + 3\) as a single group: \((1 + 2 + 3) - 4 + 5 + 6 = 6 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 11\).

Next, we consider grouping the terms after 4 as a single group:
- Grouping \(5 + 6\) as a single group: \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + (5 + 6) = 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 11 = 13\).

Another approach is to group more terms together:
- Grouping \(4 + 5 + 6\) as a single group: \(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) = 6 - 15 = -9\).

We also consider grouping terms in the middle:
- Grouping \(2 + 3 + 4 + 5\) as a single group: \(1 + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5) - 6 = 1 + 14 - 6 = 9\).

Finally, we find that grouping \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4\) as a single group and subtracting \(5 + 6\) as a group:
- Grouping \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4\) as a single group: \((1 + 2 + 3 + 4) - (5 + 6) = 10 - 11 = -1\).

Thus, the minimum possible value is achieved by grouping \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4\) as a single group and subtracting \(5 + 6\) as a group, resulting in the minimum value of \(-1\).

\[
\boxed{-1}
\]
