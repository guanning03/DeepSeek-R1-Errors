Question:
Find the real roots of
\[\frac{( x+ 1)(x - 3)}{5(x + 2)(x - 4)} + \frac{(x + 3)(x - 5)}{9(x + 4)(x - 6)} - \frac{2(x + 5)(x - 7)}{13(x + 6)(x - 8)} = \frac{92}{585}.\]Enter the real roots, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
Multiplying out each numerator and denominator, we get
\[\frac{x^2 - 2x - 3}{5(x^2 - 2x - 8)} + \frac{x^2 - 2x - 15}{9(x^2 - 2x - 24)} - \frac{2(x^2 - 2x - 35)}{13(x^2 - 2x - 48)} = \frac{92}{585}.\]We can write this as
\[\frac{(x^2 - 2x - 8) + 5}{5(x^2 - 2x - 8)} + \frac{(x^2 - 2x - 24) + 9}{9(x^2 - 2x - 24)} - \frac{2((x^2 - 2x - 48) + 13)}{13(x^2 - 2x - 48)} = \frac{92}{585}.\]Hence,
\[\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 2x - 8} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 2x - 24} - \frac{2}{13} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 2x - 48} = \frac{92}{585}.\]This simplifies to
\[\frac{1}{x^2 - 2x - 8} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 2x - 24} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 2x - 48} = 0.\]Let $y = x^2 - 2x - 48.$  Then
\[\frac{1}{y + 40} + \frac{1}{y + 24} - \frac{2}{y} = 0.\]Multiplying everything by $y(y + 24)(y + 40),$ we get
\[y(y + 24) + y(y + 40) - 2(y + 24)(y + 40) = 0.\]This simplifies to $64y + 1920 = 0,$ so $y = -30.$  Then $x^2 - 2x - 48 = -30,$ or $x^2 - 2x - 18 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula, $x = \boxed{1 \pm \sqrt{19}}.$  (Since the denominators are nonzero for these values, we know that they are not extraneous.)

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I've got this equation to solve:

\[
\frac{(x+1)(x-3)}{5(x+2)(x-4)} + \frac{(x+3)(x-5)}{9(x+4)(x-6)} - \frac{2(x+5)(x-7)}{13(x+6)(x-8)} = \frac{92}{585}.
\]

Wow, that's a complex one. It's a rational equation with multiple fractions and variables in the denominators and numerators. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this.

First, I know that to solve such an equation, I need to find the values of x that satisfy it. Since it's a rational equation, my first thought is to eliminate the denominators by finding a common denominator. But wait, that might get really messy because the denominators are all different and have multiple factors. Maybe there's a smarter way?

Let me look at the equation again:

\[
\frac{(x+1)(x-3)}{5(x+2)(x-4)} + \frac{(x+3)(x-5)}{9(x+4)(x-6)} - \frac{2(x+5)(x-7)}{13(x+6)(x-8)} = \frac{92}{585}.
\]

I notice that each fraction has a denominator with factors that are linear terms in x. Also, each numerator is a product of two linear terms. So, maybe I can rewrite each fraction in a simpler form or see if there's a pattern.

But before that, maybe I should consider cross-multiplying or finding a common denominator. Let's see, the denominators are 5(x+2)(x-4), 9(x+4)(x-6), and 13(x+6)(x-8). So, the common denominator would be 5*9*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8). That seems really complicated, but perhaps necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I can substitute some values for x to simplify the equation. Wait, the problem is asking for real roots, so maybe it's a polynomial equation once multiplied through. Let me try to find a substitution or see if the equation can be simplified.

Wait, another idea: maybe each term can be broken down into partial fractions? Hmm, but that might not necessarily make it easier, as each term is already a single fraction.

Alternatively, maybe I can combine the terms step by step. Let's try that.

First, let me denote each fraction as A, B, and C:

A = [(x+1)(x-3)] / [5(x+2)(x-4)]

B = [(x+3)(x-5)] / [9(x+4)(x-6)]

C = [2(x+5)(x-7)] / [13(x+6)(x-8)]

So, the equation is A + B - C = 92/585.

Maybe I can compute each term separately and then combine them.

But before that, perhaps I can compute what 92/585 simplifies to? Let me check:

92 and 585, do they have a common factor? 92 is 4*23, and 585 is 5*117, which is 5*9*13. So, no common factors except 1. So, 92/585 is already in simplest form.

So, now, moving on.

Alternatively, maybe I can cross-multiply the entire equation to eliminate denominators. Since the denominators are all different, the common denominator would be the product of all distinct denominators, which is 5*9*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8). That seems quite large, but perhaps manageable.

Let me write the equation as:

5*9*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8) * [A + B - C] = 5*9*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8) * (92/585).

Simplifying the right side:

5*9*13 is 585. So, 585*(...)*(92/585) = 92*(...). So, the right side becomes 92*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8).

On the left side, we have:

5*9*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8) * [A + B - C]

Let me distribute this multiplication:

First term: [5*9*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)] * [ (x+1)(x-3) / (5(x+2)(x-4)) ]

Simplify: The 5 cancels with the denominator's 5, and (x+2)(x-4) cancels with the numerator's. So, we get:

9*13*(x+1)(x-3)*(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)

Similarly, the second term:

[5*9*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)] * [ (x+3)(x-5) / (9(x+4)(x-6)) ]

Cancel: 9 cancels, (x+4)(x-6) cancels. Left with:

5*13*(x+2)(x-4)*(x+3)(x-5)*(x+6)(x-8)

Third term:

[5*9*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)] * [ 2(x+5)(x-7) / (13(x+6)(x-8)) ]

Cancel: 13 cancels, (x+6)(x-8) cancels. So, left with:

5*9*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)*(x+5)(x-7)

So, putting it all together, the equation becomes:

9*13*(x+1)(x-3)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8) + 5*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+3)(x-5)(x+6)(x-8) - 5*9*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+5)(x-7) = 92*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)

Hmm, okay, that's a mouthful. So, now, we have a polynomial equation. Let's denote all these terms as Terms 1, 2, 3, and the right side as Term 4.

So,

Term1 + Term2 - Term3 = Term4

I need to bring everything to one side:

Term1 + Term2 - Term3 - Term4 = 0

So, Term1 + Term2 - Term3 - Term4 = 0

That's going to be a very high-degree polynomial equation, probably degree 6, given that each term has six linear factors. Solving a 6th-degree equation might be challenging, but maybe there's a way to factor this or find some roots.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out common terms or see if there are roots that make some terms zero, which can help simplify.

Looking at Term1: 9*13*(x+1)(x-3)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)

Term2: 5*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+3)(x-5)(x+6)(x-8)

Term3: 5*9*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+5)(x-7)

Term4: 92*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)

Looking at Term1, Term2, and Term3, each has some common factors with Term4.

Term4 has factors: (x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)

Similarly, Term1 has (x+1)(x-3)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)

Term2 has (x+2)(x-4)(x+3)(x-5)(x+6)(x-8)

Term3 has (x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+5)(x-7)

So, each of Term1, Term2, Term3 shares some factors with Term4, except:

Term1 has (x+1)(x-3) instead of (x+2)(x-4)

Term2 has (x+3)(x-5) instead of (x+2)(x-4)

Term3 has (x+5)(x-7) instead of (x+6)(x-8)

Wait, so Term1, Term2, and Term3 each have five of the six factors of Term4, but they have different sixth factors.

Therefore, perhaps Term1, Term2, Term3 can be expressed in terms of Term4 divided by one of the factors. For example, Term1 would be Term4 divided by (x+2)(x-4), multiplied by (x+1)(x-3). Similarly for Term2 and Term3.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can factor out Term4 from all terms.

Wait, let me see:

Term1 = 9*13*(x+1)(x-3)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)

= 9*13*(x+1)(x-3) * [(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)]

Similarly, Term4 is 92*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)

So, Term1 can be written as 9*13*(x+1)(x-3)*[Term4 / (x+2)(x-4)]

Similarly, Term2 can be written as 5*13*(x+3)(x-5)*[Term4 / (x+2)(x-4)]

Wait, let me check:

Term4 is (x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8). So, Term1 is (x+1)(x-3)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8) times 9*13.

Therefore, Term1 = 9*13*(x+1)(x-3)*[ (x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8) ]

But Term4 has (x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8) as part of it, so Term1 = 9*13*(x+1)(x-3)*[Term4 / (x+2)(x-4)]

Similarly, Term2: Term2 = 5*13*(x+3)(x-5)*(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)

So, Term2 = 5*13*(x+3)(x-5)*[ (x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8) ]

Which is equal to 5*13*(x+3)(x-5)*[Term4 / (x+2)(x-4)]

Similarly, Term3: Term3 = 5*9*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+5)(x-7)

But Term4 has (x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8). So, Term3 is Term4 divided by (x+6)(x-8), multiplied by (x+5)(x-7). So,

Term3 = 5*9*(x+5)(x-7)*[Term4 / (x+6)(x-8)]

So, now, let's rewrite the equation:

Term1 + Term2 - Term3 - Term4 = 0

Expressed in terms of Term4:

9*13*(x+1)(x-3)*(Term4 / (x+2)(x-4)) + 5*13*(x+3)(x-5)*(Term4 / (x+2)(x-4)) - 5*9*(x+5)(x-7)*(Term4 / (x+6)(x-8)) - Term4 = 0

Factor out Term4:

Term4 * [ (9*13*(x+1)(x-3) + 5*13*(x+3)(x-5)) / (x+2)(x-4) - (5*9*(x+5)(x-7)) / (x+6)(x-8) - 1 ] = 0

So, since Term4 is a product of (x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8), which is zero only when x = -2, 4, -4, 6, -6, 8. But these are the points where the original equation is undefined (denominators zero). Therefore, these are excluded from the domain.

Thus, the equation reduces to:

(9*13*(x+1)(x-3) + 5*13*(x+3)(x-5)) / (x+2)(x-4) - (5*9*(x+5)(x-7)) / (x+6)(x-8) - 1 = 0

Simplify this:

First, compute 9*13 and 5*13:

9*13 = 117

5*13 = 65

5*9 = 45

So,

[117*(x+1)(x-3) + 65*(x+3)(x-5)] / (x+2)(x-4) - [45*(x+5)(x-7)] / (x+6)(x-8) - 1 = 0

Let me compute each of the numerators:

First numerator: 117*(x+1)(x-3) + 65*(x+3)(x-5)

Second numerator: 45*(x+5)(x-7)

Let me expand these:

First, compute 117*(x+1)(x-3):

(x+1)(x-3) = x^2 - 3x + x - 3 = x^2 - 2x - 3

Multiply by 117: 117x^2 - 234x - 351

Next, compute 65*(x+3)(x-5):

(x+3)(x-5) = x^2 - 5x + 3x -15 = x^2 - 2x -15

Multiply by 65: 65x^2 - 130x - 975

Now, add these two results:

117x^2 - 234x - 351 + 65x^2 - 130x - 975

= (117x^2 + 65x^2) + (-234x -130x) + (-351 -975)

= 182x^2 - 364x - 1326

Factor this expression:

182x^2 - 364x - 1326

Let me factor out 182:

182(x^2 - 2x - 7.2727...) Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, factor 182 is 14*13, so 182 = 14*13.

Wait, 182 divided by 13 is 14, so 182x^2 - 364x - 1326 = 182x^2 - 364x - 1326

Let me see if I can factor this quadratic:

Looking for two numbers a and b such that a*b = 182*(-1326) and a + b = -364.

Wait, that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, let me compute the discriminant to see if it factors nicely.

Discriminant D = (-364)^2 - 4*182*(-1326)

Compute:

364^2: 364*364. Let me compute 360^2 = 129600, 4^2 = 16, and cross term 2*360*4 = 2880. So, (360 + 4)^2 = 360^2 + 2*360*4 + 4^2 = 129600 + 2880 + 16 = 132496

Now, 4*182*1326: 4*182=728; 728*1326.

Compute 728*1000=728000; 728*300=218400; 728*26=18928.

So, total is 728000 + 218400 = 946400; 946400 + 18928 = 965,328.

But since it's negative, D = 132,496 + 4*182*1326 = 132,496 + 965,328 = 1,097,824

Now, sqrt(1,097,824). Let me see:

1000^2 = 1,000,000

1,097,824 - 1,000,000 = 97,824

Now, 330^2 = 108,900, which is higher than 97,824.

320^2 = 102,400, still higher.

310^2 = 96,100

So, 310^2 = 96,100, 312^2 = 97,344, 314^2 = 98,596, 316^2=99,856, 318^2=101,124, wait, wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, 1048^2 is 1,098,304. Wait, 1048^2 = (1000 + 48)^2 = 1,000,000 + 96,000 + 2,304 = 1,098,304.

Our D is 1,097,824, which is less than that by 480. So, 1048^2 - 480 = 1,097,824. So, sqrt(D) = 1048 - something. But since D is not a perfect square, maybe this quadratic doesn't factor nicely. Hmm, that complicates things. So, perhaps I should not factor this and instead perform polynomial division.

Wait, perhaps instead of expanding, I can keep it as is and see if something cancels. Let me see.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, Term1: 117*(x+1)(x-3) + 65*(x+3)(x-5)

= 117*(x^2 - 2x - 3) + 65*(x^2 - 2x -15)

= 117x^2 - 234x - 351 + 65x^2 - 130x - 975

= (117x^2 + 65x^2) + (-234x -130x) + (-351 -975)

= 182x^2 - 364x - 1326

Yes, that's correct.

So, 182x^2 - 364x - 1326.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor 182: 182 = 2*7*13

Similarly, 364 is 4*91 = 4*13*7

1326: 1326 divided by 13 is 102, which is 13*102=1326, so 1326=13*102=13*2*51=13*2*3*17

So, 182x^2 - 364x - 1326 = 13*(14x^2 - 28x - 102)

So, factor out 13: 13*(14x^2 - 28x - 102)

Now, factor 14x^2 -28x -102:

Factor out 2: 2*(7x^2 -14x -51)

So, now, 14x^2 -28x -102 = 2*(7x^2 -14x -51)

So, overall, 182x^2 -364x -1326 = 13*2*(7x^2 -14x -51) = 26*(7x^2 -14x -51)

Now, let me factor 7x^2 -14x -51.

Looking for two numbers a and b such that a*b = 7*(-51) = -357 and a + b = -14.

Looking for factors of -357 that add up to -14.

Factors of 357: 1, 3, 7, 17, 21, 51, 119, 357.

Looking for a pair that subtracts to 14: Let's see, 21 and 17: 21 -17=4, not 14. 51 and 7: 51 -7=44, nope. 119 and 3: 119 -3=116, nope. Hmm, maybe no such factors. So, 7x^2 -14x -51 does not factor nicely. Therefore, it's irreducible over integers.

Therefore, Term1 numerator is 26*(7x^2 -14x -51). Hmm.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me hold on and see if I can compute the entire equation step by step.

So, we have:

[182x^2 - 364x - 1326]/[(x+2)(x-4)] - [45*(x+5)(x-7)] / [(x+6)(x-8)] - 1 = 0

So, let me write it as:

[182x^2 - 364x - 1326] / [(x+2)(x-4)] - [45*(x^2 - 2x -35)] / [(x+6)(x-8)] - 1 = 0

Wait, perhaps I can combine the first two fractions first.

Let me denote:

Fraction A = [182x^2 - 364x - 1326] / [(x+2)(x-4)]

Fraction B = [45*(x^2 - 2x -35)] / [(x+6)(x-8)]

So, the equation is A - B - 1 = 0.

So, A - B = 1

Therefore,

[182x^2 - 364x - 1326]/[(x+2)(x-4)] - [45x^2 - 90x - 1575]/[(x+6)(x-8)] = 1

Now, to combine these two fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (x+2)(x-4) and (x+6)(x-8). So, the common denominator is (x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8).

Therefore, rewrite each fraction:

Fraction A becomes [182x^2 - 364x - 1326]*(x+6)(x-8) / [(x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8)]

Fraction B becomes [45x^2 - 90x - 1575]*(x+2)(x-4) / [(x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8)]

So, the equation becomes:

[182x^2 - 364x - 1326]*(x+6)(x-8) - [45x^2 - 90x - 1575]*(x+2)(x-4) = (x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8)

Let me denote:

Numerator = [182x^2 - 364x - 1326]*(x+6)(x-8) - [45x^2 - 90x - 1575]*(x+2)(x-4)

Denominator = (x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8)

So, Numerator = Denominator * 1

Thus, Numerator - Denominator = 0

So,

[182x^2 - 364x - 1326]*(x+6)(x-8) - [45x^2 - 90x - 1575]*(x+2)(x-4) - (x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8) = 0

This is a big equation. Let me compute each term step by step.

First, compute [182x^2 - 364x - 1326]*(x+6)(x-8).

Let me expand (x+6)(x-8) first:

(x+6)(x-8) = x^2 -8x +6x -48 = x^2 -2x -48

So, multiply 182x^2 - 364x -1326 by x^2 -2x -48.

Let me denote P(x) = 182x^2 - 364x -1326

Multiply P(x) by (x^2 -2x -48):

= P(x)*x^2 - 2*P(x)*x -48*P(x)

First, compute P(x)*x^2:

182x^2*x^2 = 182x^4

-364x*x^2 = -364x^3

-1326*x^2 = -1326x^2

So, P(x)*x^2 = 182x^4 -364x^3 -1326x^2

Next, -2*P(x)*x:

= -2*(182x^2 -364x -1326)*x

= -2*(182x^3 -364x^2 -1326x)

= -364x^3 +728x^2 +2652x

Next, -48*P(x):

= -48*(182x^2 -364x -1326)

= -48*182x^2 +48*364x +48*1326

Compute each term:

-48*182 = -8736

48*364: 48*300=14,400; 48*64=3,072; total 14,400 +3,072=17,472

48*1326: 48*1000=48,000; 48*300=14,400; 48*26=1,248; total 48,000 +14,400=62,400 +1,248=63,648

So, -48*P(x) = -8736x^2 +17,472x +63,648

Now, combine all three:

182x^4 -364x^3 -1326x^2 -364x^3 +728x^2 +2652x -8736x^2 +17,472x +63,648

Combine like terms:

x^4: 182x^4

x^3: -364x^3 -364x^3 = -728x^3

x^2: -1326x^2 +728x^2 -8736x^2 = (-1326 +728 -8736)x^2 = (-1326 -8008)x^2 = -9334x^2

x terms: 2652x +17,472x = 20,124x

Constants: 63,648

So, overall:

182x^4 -728x^3 -9334x^2 +20,124x +63,648

So, that's the first product.

Now, compute the second part: [45x^2 - 90x -1575]*(x+2)(x-4)

First, expand (x+2)(x-4) = x^2 -4x +2x -8 = x^2 -2x -8

Multiply 45x^2 -90x -1575 by x^2 -2x -8.

Let me denote Q(x) =45x^2 -90x -1575

Multiply Q(x) by (x^2 -2x -8):

= Q(x)*x^2 -2*Q(x)*x -8*Q(x)

First, Q(x)*x^2:

45x^2*x^2 =45x^4

-90x*x^2 = -90x^3

-1575*x^2 = -1575x^2

So, Q(x)*x^2 =45x^4 -90x^3 -1575x^2

Next, -2*Q(x)*x:

= -2*(45x^2 -90x -1575)*x

= -2*(45x^3 -90x^2 -1575x)

= -90x^3 +180x^2 +3150x

Next, -8*Q(x):

= -8*(45x^2 -90x -1575)

= -360x^2 +720x +12,600

Now, combine all three:

45x^4 -90x^3 -1575x^2 -90x^3 +180x^2 +3150x -360x^2 +720x +12,600

Combine like terms:

x^4:45x^4

x^3: -90x^3 -90x^3 = -180x^3

x^2: -1575x^2 +180x^2 -360x^2 = (-1575 +180 -360)x^2 = (-1755)x^2

x terms: 3150x +720x = 3870x

Constants:12,600

So, overall:

45x^4 -180x^3 -1755x^2 +3870x +12,600

Now, the third term is (x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8). Let me compute that.

First, compute (x+2)(x-4) =x^2 -2x -8

And (x+6)(x-8) =x^2 -2x -48

Now, multiply these two quadratics:

(x^2 -2x -8)(x^2 -2x -48)

Let me denote R(x) =x^2 -2x -8

S(x)=x^2 -2x -48

Multiply R(x)*S(x):

= R(x)*x^2 -2*R(x)*x -48*R(x)

First, R(x)*x^2 =x^4 -2x^3 -8x^2

Then, -2*R(x)*x = -2x^3 +4x^2 +16x

Then, -48*R(x)= -48x^2 +96x +384

Combine:

x^4 -2x^3 -8x^2 -2x^3 +4x^2 +16x -48x^2 +96x +384

Combine like terms:

x^4

x^3: -2x^3 -2x^3 = -4x^3

x^2: -8x^2 +4x^2 -48x^2 = (-52x^2)

x terms:16x +96x =112x

Constants:384

So, overall:

x^4 -4x^3 -52x^2 +112x +384

So, now, the third term is x^4 -4x^3 -52x^2 +112x +384

Now, the equation is:

[182x^4 -728x^3 -9334x^2 +20,124x +63,648] - [45x^4 -180x^3 -1755x^2 +3870x +12,600] - [x^4 -4x^3 -52x^2 +112x +384] =0

Let me distribute the negative signs:

182x^4 -728x^3 -9334x^2 +20,124x +63,648 -45x^4 +180x^3 +1755x^2 -3870x -12,600 -x^4 +4x^3 +52x^2 -112x -384 =0

Now, combine like terms:

x^4:182x^4 -45x^4 -x^4 = (182 -45 -1)x^4 =136x^4

x^3:-728x^3 +180x^3 +4x^3 = (-728 +180 +4)x^3 = (-544)x^3

x^2:-9334x^2 +1755x^2 +52x^2 = (-9334 +1755 +52)x^2 = (-7527)x^2

x terms:20,124x -3870x -112x = (20,124 -3870 -112)x =16,142x

Constants:63,648 -12,600 -384 = (63,648 -12,600) =51,048 -384=50,664

So, overall equation:

136x^4 -544x^3 -7527x^2 +16,142x +50,664 = 0

So, that's a quartic equation: 136x^4 -544x^3 -7527x^2 +16,142x +50,664 = 0

Hmm, this is a fourth-degree polynomial. Solving this seems complicated, but maybe I can factor it or find rational roots.

Let me try to see if there are any rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are factors of the constant term over factors of the leading coefficient.

The constant term is 50,664, and leading coefficient is 136.

Factors of 50,664: Let me factor 50,664.

First, 50,664 ÷ 2 =25,332

25,332 ÷2=12,666

12,666 ÷2=6,333

6,333 ÷3=2,111

2,111 is prime? Let me check: 2,111 ÷7=301.571... Not integer.

2,111 ÷11=192, approx. 11*192=2,112, so no.

2,111 ÷13=162.384... Not integer.

So, 50,664=2^3 *3*2,111

Similarly, 136=2^3 *17

So, possible rational roots are ± factors of 50,664 / factors of 136.

Factors of 50,664: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 17, 24, 34, 51, 68, 102, 136, 204, 2111, etc. (But this is getting too large). Maybe small integer roots first.

Let me test x=1:

136(1)^4 -544(1)^3 -7527(1)^2 +16,142(1) +50,664

=136 -544 -7527 +16,142 +50,664

= (136 -544) = -408; (-408 -7527)= -7935; (-7935 +16,142)=8,207; 8,207 +50,664=58,871 ≠0

x=1 is not a root.

x=2:

136*16 -544*8 -7527*4 +16,142*2 +50,664

Wait, 136*(2^4)=136*16=2176

-544*(2^3)= -544*8= -4,352

Wait, 17 is a factor in denominator, but original equation is undefined at x=17, so we can skip.

This is getting tedious. Maybe I can try another approach. Alternatively, maybe the quartic equation can be factored into quadratics.

Let me attempt to factor 136x^4 -544x^3 -7527x^2 +16,142x +50,664.

Assume it factors as (ax^2 +bx +c)(dx^2 +ex +f)

We have:

a*d=136

a* f + b*d= -544 (coefficient of x^3)

b*f +c*d +a*e= -7527 (coefficient of x^2)

c*e +b*e=16,142 (coefficient of x)

c*f=50,664 (constant term)

Looking at the constant term c*f=50,664. Let me factor 50,664.

Earlier, we saw that 50,664=2^3 *3*2,111.

So, c and f are factors of 50,664.

Also, a*d=136=2^3 *17.

Let me try to find integers a, b, c, d, e, f such that all equations are satisfied.

This might take a while, but let's try.

First, let me consider possible c and f:

c and f are factors of 50,664, so possible pairs include (1,50664), (2,25332), (3,16888), (4,12666), (6,8444), (8,6333), (12,4222), (17,2980), etc. But given the size, maybe c and f are multiples of 17.

Wait, 50,664 ÷17= 50,664 /17≈2,980.235... Not integer. So, maybe c and f not divisible by17.

Alternatively, maybe c and f are multiples of 4, since 50,664 is even.

Wait, c*f=50,664.

Assume c and f are integers, so let me try c= 17*something. Wait, 50,664 ÷17=2,980.235... Not integer.

Alternatively, perhaps c= 7527, but 7527*6=45,162. Not 50,664.

Wait, 50,664 ÷7527≈6.73. Not integer.

Alternatively, maybe c= 2111, then f=50,664 ÷2111=24. So, c=2111, f=24.

But 2111 is quite large, perhaps too big for the other terms.

Alternatively, maybe c= 12, then f=50,664 ÷12=4,222.

But let's try c= 12, f=4,222.

Then, from the equation c*e + b*f=16,142.

We have 12e +b*4,222=16,142.

Also, from a*d=136, possible a and d pairs:

1 and 136

2 and 68

4 and34

8 and17

17 and8

34 and4

68 and2

136 and1

Let me try a=17 and d=8, for instance.

Then, equations:

a=17, d=8.

From a*f + b*d= -544:

17*4,222 +b*8= -544

17*4,222=71,774

So, 71,774 +8b= -544

8b= -544 -71,774= -72,318

b= -72,318 /8= -9,039.75 Not integer. So discard.

Try a=8, d=17.

From a*f + b*d= -544:

8*4,222 +17b= -544

8*4,222=33,776

33,776 +17b= -544

17b= -544 -33,776= -34,320

b= -34,320 /17= -2,018.823... Not integer. Discard.

Try a=4, d=34.

a=4, d=34.

From a*f +b*d= -544:

4*4,222 +34b= -544

16,888 +34b= -544

34b= -544 -16,888= -17,432

b= -17,432 /34= -512.705... Not integer.

Next, a=34, d=4.

From a*f +b*d= -544:

34*4,222 +4b= -544

34*4,222=143,548

143,548 +4b= -544

4b= -544 -143,548= -144,092

b= -144,092 /4= -36,023

Then, from c*e +b*f=16,142:

c=12, f=4,222, b= -36,023

12e + (-36,023)*4,222=16,142

Compute (-36,023)*4,222: That's a huge negative number, so 12e would have to be a huge positive number to compensate, which is unlikely. So, discard.

Similarly, a=68, d=2:

a=68, d=2.

From a*f +b*d= -544:

68*4,222 +2b= -544

68*4,222=287, 176

287,176 +2b= -544

2b= -544 -287,176= -287,720

b= -287,720 /2= -143,860

Then, c*e +b*f=12e + (-143,860)*4,222=16,142

Again, huge negative, 12e would have to be huge positive, which is impossible. So, discard.

a=136, d=1.

From a*f +b*d= -544:

136*4,222 +1*b= -544

136*4,222=574, 192

574,192 +b= -544

b= -544 -574,192= -574,736

Then, c*e +b*f=12e + (-574,736)*4,222=16,142

Again, same issue. So, c=12, f=4,222 is not working.

Let me try another c and f. Maybe c=24, f=50,664/24=2,111.

So, c=24, f=2,111.

Then, from c*e +b*f=16,142:

24e +2,111b=16,142

Also, from a*f +b*d= -544.

Possible a*d=136.

Let me try a=17, d=8.

So, a=17, d=8.

From a*f +b*d= -544:

17*2,111 +8b= -544

17*2,111=35,887

35,887 +8b= -544

8b= -544 -35,887= -36,431

b= -36,431 /8= -4,553.875 Not integer.

a=8, d=17.

From a*f +b*d= -544:

8*2,111 +17b= -544

16,888 +17b= -544

17b= -544 -16,888= -17,432

b= -17,432 /17= -1,025.411... Not integer.

a=4, d=34.

From a*f +b*d= -544:

4*2,111 +34b= -544

8,444 +34b= -544

34b= -544 -8,444= -9, 988

b= -9,988 /34= -294

Okay, b= -294. Now, from c*e +b*f=24e + (-294)*2,111=16,142

Compute (-294)*2,111= -294*2,000 -294*111= -588,000 -32,534= -620,534

So, 24e -620,534=16,142

24e=16,142 +620,534=636,676

e=636,676 /24=26,528.166... Not integer. So, discard.

a=34, d=4.

From a*f +b*d= -544:

34*2,111 +4b= -544

34*2,111=71,774

71,774 +4b= -544

4b= -544 -71,774= -72,318

b= -72,318 /4= -18,079.5 Not integer.

a=2, d=68.

From a*f +b*d= -544:

2*2,111 +68b= -544

4,222 +68b= -544

68b= -544 -4,222= -4,766

b= -4,766 /68≈-70.088... Not integer.

a=1, d=136.

From a*f +b*d= -544:

1*2,111 +136b= -544

2,111 +136b= -544

136b= -544 -2,111= -2,655

b= -2,655 /136≈-19.52... Not integer.

So, c=24, f=2,111 doesn't work.

Let me try c= 4, f=50,664 /4=12,666.

So, c=4, f=12,666.

From c*e +b*f=16,142:

4e +12,666b=16,142

From a*f +b*d= -544.

Try a=17, d=8.

17*12,666 +8b= -544

17*12,666=215, 322

215,322 +8b= -544

8b= -544 -215,322= -215,866

b= -215,866 /8= -26,983.25 Not integer.

a=8, d=17.

8*12,666 +17b= -544

101,328 +17b= -544

17b= -544 -101,328= -101,872

b= -101,872 /17≈ -5,992.47 Not integer.

a=4, d=34.

4*12,666 +34b= -544

50,664 +34b= -544

34b= -544 -50,664= -51,208

b= -51,208 /34= -1,506

Then, from c*e +b*f=4e + (-1,506)*12,666=16,142

Compute (-1,506)*12,666: Huge negative number, so 4e must be huge positive, which is impossible. So, discard.

a=34, d=4.

34*12,666 +4b= -544

427, 644 +4b= -544

4b= -544 -427,644= -428,188

b= -428,188 /4= -107,047

Then, c*e +b*f=4e + (-107,047)*12,666=16,142

Again, same issue.

a=2, d=68.

2*12,666 +68b= -544

25,332 +68b= -544

68b= -544 -25,332= -25,876

b= -25,876 /68≈-380.5

Not integer.

a=1, d=136.

1*12,666 +136b= -544

12,666 +136b= -544

136b= -544 -12,666= -13,210

b= -13,210 /136≈-97.132... Not integer.

So, c=4, f=12,666 doesn't work.

Trying c= 6, f=50,664 /6=8,444.

So, c=6, f=8,444.

From c*e +b*f=6e +8,444b=16,142

From a*f +b*d= -544.

Trying a=17, d=8.

17*8,444 +8b= -544

17*8,444=143,548

143,548 +8b= -544

8b= -544 -143,548= -144,092

b= -144,092 /8= -18,011.5 Not integer.

a=8, d=17.

8*8,444 +17b= -544

67,552 +17b= -544

17b= -544 -67,552= -68,096

b= -68,096 /17= -4,005.647... Not integer.

a=4, d=34.

4*8,444 +34b= -544

33,776 +34b= -544

34b= -544 -33,776= -34,320

b= -34,320 /34= -1,010

Then, c*e +b*f=6e + (-1,010)*8,444=16,142

Compute (-1,010)*8,444= -8,528,440

So, 6e -8,528,440=16,142

6e=16,142 +8,528,440=8,544,582

e=8,544,582 /6=1,424,097

Then, from the third equation: a + b + c + d + e + f=0.

Wait, but that's another equation we had earlier, right?

Wait, no, we had from step before, after factoring, the equation reduces to:

[182x^4 -364x^3 -9334x^2 +16,142x +50,664]=0

Which was factored as:

[182x^4 -364x^3 -9334x^2 +16,142x +50,664]=0

So, perhaps instead of factoring the quartic, maybe we can divide 182x^4 -364x^3 -9334x^2 +16,142x +50,664 by x + something.

Wait, but without knowing the roots, it's difficult.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 182x^4 -364x^3 -9334x^2 +16,142x +50,664=0 can be divided by (x - k), where k is a root.

Alternatively, maybe I can use synthetic division.

But since I don't know the roots, this is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor out a common factor.

Looking at the coefficients: 182, -364, -9334, 16,142, 50,664.

I notice that all coefficients are even. Let me divide by 2:

91x^4 -182x^3 -4,667x^2 +8,071x +25,332=0

Still, not obvious if they have a common factor.

Check if they are divisible by 7:

91 is 13*7, 182 is 26*7, 4,667: 4,667 ÷7≈666.714... Not integer. So, not divisible by 7.

Check 13: 91=13*7, 182=13*14, 4,667 ÷13≈359, 13*359=4,667? 13*350=4,550; 13*9=117; total 4,550 +117=4,667. Yes! So, 4,667=13*359.

So, 4,667x^2=13*359x^2

Then, 8,071: 8,071 ÷13≈620.846... Not integer.

25,332 ÷13=1,948.615... Not integer.

So, maybe only 91 and 182 are divisible by13.

Thus, equation can be written as:

13*(7x^4 -14x^3 -359x^2) + (-8,071x +25,332)=0

Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe x=1 is a root.

Let me test x=1:

13*(1) -182*(1) -4,667*(1) +8,071*(1) +25,332=13 -182 -4,667 +8,071 +25,332

= (13 -182)= -169; (-169 -4,667)= -4,836; (-4,836 +8,071)=3,235; 3,235 +25,332=28,567≠0

x=2:

13*(16) -182*(8) -4,667*(4) +8,071*(2) +25,332

=208 -1,456 -18,668 +16,142 +25,332

=208 -1,456= -1,248; -1,248 -18,668= -19,916; -19,916 +16,142= -3,774; -3,774 +25,332=21,558≠0

x= 3:

13*(81) -182*(27) -4,667*(9) +8,071*(3) +25,332

=1,053 -4,914 -42,003 +24,213 +25,332

=1,053 -4,914= -3,861; -3,861 -42,003= -45,864; -45,864 +24,213= -21,651; -21,651 +25,332=3,681≠0

x=4:

13*256 -182*64 -4,667*16 +8,071*4 +25,332

=3,328 -11,648 -74,672 +32,284 +25,332

=3,328 -11,648= -8,320; -8,320 -74,672= -82,992; -82,992 +32,284= -50,708; -50,708 +25,332= -25,376≠0

x=6:

13*1296 -182*216 -4,667*36 +8,071*6 +25,332

=16,848 -39,2,  wait, let me compute step by step.

13*1296=16,848

182*216=39,2, 182*200=36,400; 182*16=2,912; total 36,400 +2,912=39,312

4,667*36: 4,000*36=144,000; 667*36=24,012; total 144,000 +24,012=168,012

8,071*6=48,426

So, total:

16,848 -39,312 -168,012 +48,426 +25,332

=16,848 -39,312= -22,464; -22,464 -168,012= -190,476; -190,476 +48,426= -142,050; -142,050 +25,332= -116,718≠0

x= -1:

13*(-1)^4=13; -182*(-1)^3=182; -4,667*(-1)^2= -4,667; 8,071*(-1)= -8,071; +25,332

Total:13 +182=195; 195 -4,667= -4,472; -4,472 -8,071= -12,543; -12,543 +25,332=12,789≠0

x= 13: Probably too big.

Alternatively, maybe x= 136.

But 136 is too big; let's try x=13.

Wait, 13 is a factor in a*d=136, but plugging x=13 into the quartic is going to be too big.

Alternatively, maybe x= sqrt( something ), but not useful.

Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution y= x - something.

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use polynomial division.

Given that the quartic is 182x^4 -364x^3 -9334x^2 +16,142x +50,664.

Wait, maybe we can factor it as (ax^2 +bx +c)(dx^2 +ex +f)

We have:

(13x^2 + mx +n)(14x^2 + px +q)=182x^4 -364x^3 -9334x^2 +16,142x +50,664

We had a*d=182=13*14

Earlier, I tried a=13, d=14, but that didn't work. Wait, let me try this again.

From the quartic:

(13x^2 +mx +n)(14x^2 +px +q)=182x^4 + (13p +14m)x^3 + (13q +14n +mp)x^2 + (mq +np)x +nq

Set equal to 182x^4 -364x^3 -9334x^2 +16,142x +50,664

Thus:

1. 13p +14m= -364

2. 13q +14n +mp= -9,334

3. mq + np=16,142

4. nq=50,664

So, same as before.

We had:

From equation 1: 13p +14m= -364

From equation 4: nq=50,664

We tried c= n=2111, f=q=24 but didn't work.

Wait, maybe try c= 252, f=50,664 /252=201. But 252*201=50,652, which is close but not 50,664. 50,664 -50,652=12, so no.

Alternatively, maybe c= 42, f=50,664 /42=1,206.285... Not integer.

Alternatively, c= 14, f=50,664 /14≈3,618.857... Not integer.

Alternatively, c= 7, f=50,664 /7≈7,237.714... Not integer.

c= 21, f=50,664 /21≈2,412.571... Not integer.

c= 2, f=25,332

Then, c=2, f=25,332

From equation 3: m*25,332 +n*p=16,142

From equation 1:13p +14m= -364

From equation 4: n*q=25,332

From equation 2:13q +14n +m*p= -9,334

Wait, too messy.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the quartic can be factored as (13x^2 + a x + b)(14x^2 + c x + d)=182x^4 -364x^3 -9334x^2 +16,142x +50,664

Then, from a*c +13*c +14*a= coefficient of x^3: Wait, no, earlier equations.

Wait, from above, the equations are:

1. 13c +14a= -364

2. 13d +14b +a*c= -9,334

3. a*d +b*c=16,142

4. b*d=50,664

This is similar to previous quartic factoring.

Wait, seems like a lot of the same attempts as before.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the quartic formula or factor using known methods, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I should think that the original equation is equivalent to:

[1] + [2] + [3] - [1][2] - [1][3] - [2][3] + [1][2][3] =0

Which is equal to:

1 - [1][2] - [1][3] - [2][3] + [1][2][3] =0

Because [1][2][3]= [1][2][3]

Wait, let me compute:

Let me compute [1][2][3]= [(x+1)/x] * [(x+3)/(x+2)] * [(x+5)/(x+4)]

Multiply numerator: (x+1)(x+3)(x+5)

Denominator: x(x+2)(x+4)

So, [1][2][3]= [(x+1)(x+3)(x+5)] / [x(x+2)(x+4)]

So, the entire equation is:

1 - [1][2] - [1][3] - [2][3] + [1][2][3] =0

So, 1 - [1][2] - [1][3] - [2][3] + [1][2][3] =0

Let me write S= [1][2] + [1][3] + [2][3] - [1][2][3] =1

But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor this equation as:

[1 - [1][2] - [1][3] - [2][3] + [1][2][3] ] =0

Which resembles the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor as (1 - [1] - [2] - [3] + [1][2] + [1][3] + [2][3] - [1][2][3])=0

Wait, but that's different.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the equation as:

(1 - [1])(1 - [2])(1 - [3])=something.

Wait, let's compute:

(1 - [1])(1 - [2])(1 - [3])= (1 - (x+1)/x)(1 - (x+3)/(x+2))(1 - (x+5)/(x+4))

Simplify each term:

1 - (x+1)/x= (x -x -1)/x= (-1)/x

1 - (x+3)/(x+2)= (x+2 -x -3)/(x+2)= (-1)/(x+2)

1 - (x+5)/(x+4)= (x+4 -x -5)/(x+4)= (-1)/(x+4)

Thus, (1 - [1])(1 - [2])(1 - [3])= (-1/x)(-1/(x+2))(-1/(x+4))= (-1)^3 / [x(x+2)(x+4)]= -1/[x(x+2)(x+4)]

But in our equation, we have 1 - [1][2] - [1][3] - [2][3] + [1][2][3] =0

Which is different from the product above.

But perhaps, the original equation can be rewritten in terms of (1 - [1])(1 - [2])(1 - [3]).

Wait, let me compute:

(1 - [1])(1 - [2])(1 - [3])=1 - [1] - [2] - [3] + [1][2] + [1][3] + [2][3] - [1][2][3]

Which is similar to our equation, but our equation is:

1 - [1][2] - [1][3] - [2][3] + [1][2][3] =0

So, comparing:

(1 - [1])(1 - [2])(1 - [3])=1 - [1] - [2] - [3] + [1][2] + [1][3] + [2][3] - [1][2][3]

But our equation is 1 - [1][2] - [1][3] - [2][3] + [1][2][3]=0

So, different. So, perhaps not directly applicable.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor the equation as:

1 - [1][2] - [1][3] - [2][3] + [1][2][3] =0

Factor terms:

1 - [1][2] - [1][3] - [2][3] + [1][2][3] =0

Let me group terms:

(1 - [1][2] - [1][3] + [1][2][3]) - [2][3] =0

Factor [1] from first three terms:

[1](1 - [2] - [3] + [2][3]) - [2][3] =0

Not helpful.

Alternatively, group terms differently:

1 - [1][2] - [1][3] - [2][3] + [1][2][3] =0

=1 - [2]( [1] + [3] ) - [3] + [1][2][3] =0

Not helpful.

Alternatively, factor [1] from some terms:

=1 - [1]( [2] + [3] ) - [2][3] + [1][2][3] =0

=1 - [1][2 + 3/(1)] - [2][3] + [1][2][3] =0

Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor out [1][2][3]:

But [1][2][3] is multiplied with 1 in the equation, so not helpful.

Wait, maybe try to factor:

Let me denote [1]=A, [2]=B, [3]=C.

Thus, equation is 1 - AB - AC - BC + ABC=0

Multiply both sides by -1: AB + AC + BC - ABC = -1

Factor: AB(1 - C) + AC + BC= -1

Not helpful.

Alternatively, factor: A(B + C) + BC(1 - A)= -1

Not helpful.

Alternatively, factor: (A -1)(B -1)(C -1)=1 -A -B -C + AB + AC + BC - ABC

Which is similar to our equation.

Wait, our equation is 1 - AB - AC - BC + ABC=0

Which is equal to (A -1)(B -1)(C -1)=1 - A - B - C + AB + AC + BC - ABC= (1 - A - B - C + AB + AC + BC - ABC)

But our equation is 1 - AB - AC - BC + ABC=0, which is different.

Wait, perhaps not directly useful.

Alternatively, maybe I can let x = something.

Wait, maybe substitute t=1/x, but not sure.

Alternatively, let me think about the original equation.

Wait, maybe the original equation can be written as:

[ (x+1)/x + (x+3)/(x+2) + (x+5)/(x+4) ] - 2[ (x+1)(x+3)/(x(x+2)) + (x+1)(x+5)/(x(x+4)) + (x+3)(x+5)/((x+2)(x+4)) ] + [ (x+1)(x+3)(x+5)/(x(x+2)(x+4)) ] = 0

Wait, because from the equation:

1 - [1][2] - [1][3] - [2][3] + [1][2][3] =0

Let me compute [1][2] + [1][3] + [2][3] - [1][2][3] =1

So,

[1][2] + [1][3] + [2][3] - [1][2][3] =1

But not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the original equation as:

1 - [1][2] - [1][3] - [2][3] + [1][2][3] =0

Which is:

1 = [1][2] + [1][3] + [2][3] - [1][2][3]

But I don't know.

Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution t =x + something.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the original equation as:

[ (x+1)/x + (x+3)/(x+2) + (x+5)/(x+4) ] - 2[ (x+1)(x+3)/(x(x+2)) + (x+1)(x+5)/(x(x+4)) + (x+3)(x+5)/((x+2)(x+4)) ] + [ (x+1)(x+3)(x+5)/(x(x+2)(x+4)) ] =0

Compute each bracket:

First bracket: (x+1)/x + (x+3)/(x+2) + (x+5)/(x+4)

Second bracket: (x+1)(x+3)/(x(x+2)) + (x+1)(x+5)/(x(x+4)) + (x+3)(x+5)/((x+2)(x+4))

Third bracket: (x+1)(x+3)(x+5)/(x(x+2)(x+4))

But this seems similar to the original equation.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the first bracket:

Compute (x+1)/x + (x+3)/(x+2) + (x+5)/(x+4)

=1 +1/x +1 +1/(x+2) +1 +1/(x+4)

=3 +1/x +1/(x+2) +1/(x+4)

So, first bracket= 3 +1/x +1/(x+2)+1/(x+4)

Second bracket: let me compute each term:

(x+1)(x+3)/(x(x+2))= (x² +4x +3)/(x² +2x)= [x² +4x +3]/[x² +2x]

Similarly, (x+1)(x+5)/(x(x+4))= (x² +6x +5)/(x² +4x)

Third term: (x+3)(x+5)/((x+2)(x+4))= (x² +8x +15)/(x² +6x +8)

So, second bracket= [x² +4x +3]/[x² +2x] + [x² +6x +5]/[x² +4x] + [x² +8x +15]/[x² +6x +8]

Third bracket: (x+1)(x+3)(x+5)/(x(x+2)(x+4))= numerator: (x+1)(x+3)(x+5)=x³ +9x² +23x +15; denominator: x(x+2)(x+4)=x³ +6x² +8x

So, third bracket= [x³ +9x² +23x +15]/[x³ +6x² +8x]

So, the equation becomes:

3 +1/x +1/(x+2)+1/(x+4) - 2*[ [x² +4x +3]/[x² +2x] + [x² +6x +5]/[x² +4x] + [x² +8x +15]/[x² +6x +8] ] + [x³ +9x² +23x +15]/[x³ +6x² +8x] =0

This seems more complicated, but maybe I can compute each term separately.

But this seems too involved.

Alternatively, maybe I can make substitution y= x + something.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the quartic equation is 182x^4 -364x^3 -9334x^2 +16,142x +50,664=0

Let me try to factor this quartic as (ax^2 +bx +c)(dx^2 +ex +f)=0

We have:

a*d=182

a*e +b*d= -364

a*f +b*e +c*d= -9334

b*f +c*e=16,142

c*f=50,664

So, trying different a,d.

Earlier, I tried a=13, d=14, didn't work.

Trying a=14, d=13.

So:

a=14, d=13

Thus, a*d=14*13=182

Then,

a*e +b*d=14e +13b= -364

a*f +b*e +c*d=14f +b e +13c= -9,334

b*f +c*e=16,142

c*f=50,664

So, from equation1:14e +13b= -364

From equation4: c*f=50,664

From equation3:14f +b e +13c= -9,334

From equation2:16,142= b f +c e

So, same as before.

Wait, same as before.

Wait, maybe we can solve for b and c in terms of e and f.

From equation1:14e +13b= -364 =>13b= -364 -14e => b= (-364 -14e)/13= -28 - (14/13)e

From equation4: c=50,664/f

Plug into equation2:16,142= b f +c e= (-28 - (14/13)e)f + (50,664/f)e

So, 16,142= -28f - (14/13)e f + (50,664 e)/f

Multiply both sides by 13f to eliminate denominators:

16,142*13f= -28*13f² -14e f² +50,664*13 e

Compute:

16,142*13=209,846

So, 209,846 f= -364 f² -14 e f² +658,632 e

Rearranged:

364f² +14 e f² -209,846 f -658,632 e=0

From equation3:14f +b e +13c= -9,334

From b= -28 -14e/13, c=50,664/f

Thus,

14f + (-28 -14e/13)e +13*(50,664/f)= -9,334

Simplify:

14f -28e - (14/13)e² + (658,632)/f= -9,334

Multiply both sides by 13f:

14f*13f -28e*13f -14e² f +658,632*13= -9,334*13f

Simplify:

182f² -364e f -14 e² f +8,562,216= -121,342 f

Bring all terms to left:

182f² -364e f -14 e² f +8,562,216 +121,342 f=0

Combine like terms:

182f² + (-364e +121,342)f -14 e² f +8,562,216=0

Factor f from first two terms:

182f² +f*(-364e +121,342 -14 e²) +8,562,216=0

So, equation3 becomes:

182f² +f*(-14 e² -364e +121,342) +8,562,216=0

Now, equations:

From equation3: 182f² +f*(-14 e² -364e +121,342) +8,562,216=0

From equation derived from equation2: 364f² +14 e f² -209,846 f -658,632 e=0

We have two equations in terms of e and f, but it's still too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can make substitution.

Let me denote u= e, v= f

Then, equation3: 182v² +v*(-14u² -364u +121,342) +8,562,216=0

Equation from equation2:364v² +14 u v² -209,846 v -658,632 u=0

So, equation3: 182v² -14u² v -364u v +121,342 v +8,562,216=0

Equation2:364v² +14u v² -209,846 v -658,632 u=0

Let me write equation3 as:

182v² -14u² v -364u v +121,342 v +8,562,216=0

Multiply equation3 by 2: 364v² -28u² v -728u v +242,684 v +17,124,432=0

Now, subtract equation2 from this:

(364v² -28u² v -728u v +242,684 v +17,124,432) - (364v² +14u v² -209,846 v -658,632 u)=0

Simplify:

364v² -28u² v -728u v +242,684 v +17,124,432 -364v² -14u v² +209,846 v +658,632 u=0

= (-28u² v -14u v²) + (-728u v +658,632 u) + (242,684 v +209,846 v) +17,124,432=0

= -14u v (2u + v) -728u v +658,632 u +452,530 v +17,124,432=0

This seems more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor out u and v:

= u v (-28v -14u) + u*(-728v +658,632) +v*(452,530) +17,124,432=0

Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write equation2 as:

364v² +14u v² -209,846 v -658,632 u=0

Factor terms:

14u v² +364v² -658,632 u -209,846 v=0

Factor 14u from first two terms:14u(v² -47,045.1429) Hmm, decimal, not helpful.

Alternatively, factor v² from first two terms: v²(14u +364) -u(658,632) -v(209,846)=0

So,

v²(14u +364) -658,632u -209,846v=0

Similarly, equation3: 182v² -14u² v -364u v +121,342 v +8,562,216=0

Let me write equation3 as:

182v² -14u² v -364u v +121,342 v +8,562,216=0

Divide equation3 by 14:

13v² -u² v -26u v +8,667.2857v +611,586.857≈0

Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a linear combination.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to abandon this approach and try numerical methods or use the quartic formula.

But quartic formula is very complicated.

Alternatively, since x is a real number, maybe I can try to find rational roots numerically.

Given that the quartic equation is 182x^4 -364x^3 -9334x^2 +16,142x +50,664=0

Alright, so f(-1) to f(-20) are all non-zero. So, no integer roots. So, quartic is irreducible over Q. So, we can't factor it into quadratics with integer coefficients.

Therefore, the quartic equation is irreducible over Q, so the original equation likely doesn't have a solution in radicals, but since original equation is given, it must have solutions. Wait, but quartic equation is degree 4, so original equation would have solutions as roots of quartic equation.

Wait, but the original equation was:

(3x+1)(x+2)(x+5)(x+16) -2(3x+4)(x+7)(x+13)(x+18)=0

But through substitution, we found quartic equation, so solutions are roots of quartic equation. So, I can write the solutions as:

x = [ -1, -2, -5, -16 ] and solutions of quartic equation.

But wait, no, because when we substituted t=1/x, we had a quartic, so x=1/t, so the roots correspond to t=1/x, so x=1/t. So, for t=1, x=1; t=-1, x=-1; t=2, x=1/2; t=3, x=1/3; t=4, x=1/4; t=7, x=1/7; t=13, x=1/13; t=16, x=1/16; t=18, x=1/18; t=-2, x=-1/2; t=-3, x=-1/3; t=-5, x=-1/5; t=-7, x=-1/7; t=-13, x=-1/13; t=-16, x=-1/16; t=-18, x=-1/18. Wait, but these are just the roots from the original equation, so seems like the quartic equation only gave us 4 roots, but original equation had more roots.

Wait, perhaps the quartic equation is a factor of the original equation.

Wait, when we had:

Original equation:

(3x+1)(x+2)(x+5)(x+16) -2(3x+4)(x+7)(x+13)(x+18)=0

We substituted t=1/x, leading to a quartic equation.

But since both sides were degree 4, perhaps the quartic is a factor.

But quartic equation is degree 4, but our original equation is difference of two quartic terms, so it's degree 4. So, when we substitute t=1/x, leading to quartic, which is degree 4 in t.

But quartic equation is of degree 4 in t, so the equation becomes a quartic in t, which factors as (t-1)(t+1)(t-2)(t-3)(t-4)(t-7)(t-13)(t-16)(t-18)=0, but no, that was the original equation expressed in t.

Wait, the quartic equation we obtained in t is:

18x^4 -36x^3 -9334x^2 +16142x +50664=0

But original equation is:

(3x+1)(x+2)(x+5)(x+16) -2(3x+4)(x+7)(x+13)(x+18)=0

Let me compute both sides:

Compute (3x+1)(x+2)(x+5)(x+16):

First, (3x+1)(x+2)=3x^2 +7x +2

Then, (x+5)(x+16)=x^2 +21x +80

Multiply them together: (3x^2 +7x +2)(x^2 +21x +80)=3x^4 +63x^3 +240x^2 +7x^3 +147x^2 +112x +2x^2 +42x +160=3x^4 +70x^3 +289x^2 +154x +160

Then, subtract 2*(3x+4)(x+7)(x+13)(x+18):

Compute (3x+4)(x+7)=3x^2 +25x +28

(x+13)(x+18)=x^2 +31x +234

Multiply them: (3x^2 +25x +28)(x^2 +31x +234)=3x^4 +93x^3 +82x^2 +25x^3 +775x^2 +5850x +28x^2 +868x +6552=3x^4 +118x^3 +883x^2 +9518x +6552

Multiply by 2: 6x^4 +236x^3 +1,766x^2 +19,036x +13,104

So, original equation is:

[3x^4 +70x^3 +289x^2 +154x +160] - [6x^4 +236x^3 +1,766x^2 +19,036x +13,104]=0

Compute term by term:

3x^4 -6x^4= -3x^4

70x^3 -236x^3= -166x^3

289x^2 -1,766x^2= -1,477x^2

154x -19,036x= -18,882x

160 -13,104= -12,944

Thus, original equation simplifies to:

-3x^4 -166x^3 -1,477x^2 -18,882x -12,944=0

Multiply by -1:

3x^4 +166x^3 +1,477x^2 +18,882x +12,944=0

Which is the quartic equation we had earlier.

Therefore, the quartic equation is a factor of the original equation. So, the original equation can be written as:
