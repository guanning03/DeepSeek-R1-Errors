Question:
Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 5 such that
\[p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1}\]for $n = 2,$ 3, 4, $\dots,$ 7.  Find $p(8).$

Correct Answer:
Let $q(x) = (x^2 - 1) p(x) - x.$  Then $q(x)$ has degree 7, and $q(n) = 0$ for $n = 2$, 3, 4, $\dots,$ 7, so
\[q(x) = (ax + b)(x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7)\]for some constants $a$ and $b.$

We know that $q(1) = (1^2 - 1)p(1) - 1 = -1.$  Setting $x = 1$ in the equation above, we get
\[q(1) = 720(a + b),\]so $a + b = -\frac{1}{720}.$

We also know that $q(-1) = ((-1)^2 - 1)p(-1) + 1 = 1.$  Setting $x = -1$ in the equation above, we get
\[q(-1) = 20160(-a + b),\]so $-a + b = \frac{1}{20160}.$  Solving for $a$ and $b,$ we find $a = -\frac{29}{40320}$ and $b = -\frac{3}{4480}.$  Hence,
\begin{align*}
q(x) &= \left( -\frac{29}{40320} x - \frac{3}{4480} \right) (x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7) \\
&= -\frac{(29x + 27)(x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7)}{40320}.
\end{align*}In particular,
\[q(8) = -\frac{(29 \cdot 8 + 27)(6)(5) \dotsm (1)}{40320} = -\frac{37}{8},\]so
\[p(8) = \frac{q(8) + 8}{8^2 - 1} = \boxed{\frac{3}{56}}.\]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where there's a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree 5, and it satisfies the equation \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, \dots, 7 \). I need to find \( p(8) \).

Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that if a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree \( k \) passes through \( k+1 \) points, then it's uniquely determined. Here, \( p(x) \) is degree 5, so it's determined by 6 points. But in the problem, we're given 6 points: \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 7 \). So that should be enough to define \( p(x) \).

But calculating a 5th-degree polynomial through these points directly seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

I recall something about constructing polynomials that satisfy certain conditions. Maybe I can use the concept of Lagrange interpolation? But with 6 points, that could get messy. Alternatively, maybe I can think about the difference between \( p(x) \) and another function that matches at these points.

Wait, let me think. The right-hand side, \( \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \), can be rewritten as \( \frac{n}{(n - 1)(n + 1)} \). That looks like a rational function, but \( p(x) \) is a polynomial. So perhaps I can express this in terms of another polynomial.

Let me define a new polynomial \( q(x) \) such that \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \). Let's see, for \( x = 2, 3, 4, \dots, 7 \), we have \( (n^2 - 1)p(n) - n = 0 \). So, \( q(n) = 0 \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, \dots, 7 \). That means \( q(x) \) has roots at \( x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \).

Since \( q(x) \) has 6 roots, and it's a polynomial, we can express \( q(x) \) as \( k(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) \), where \( k \) is some constant. So, \( q(x) = k(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) \).

But what is the degree of \( q(x) \)? \( p(x) \) is degree 5, so \( x^2 - 1 \) is degree 2, so multiplying them gives a degree 7 polynomial. Then, subtracting \( x \), which is degree 1, doesn't change the degree, so \( q(x) \) is degree 7.

But the expression I have for \( q(x) \) is a product of 6 linear terms, which is degree 6. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's see:

\( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \). So, \( (x^2 - 1)p(x) \) is a degree \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) polynomial, and \( x \) is degree 1, so \( q(x) \) is indeed degree 7. However, the expression I wrote for \( q(x) \) is degree 6, which is conflicting.

Wait, so perhaps I need to reconsider. Maybe \( q(x) = k(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)(x + a) \), introducing an extra linear factor, making it degree 7. But where would this extra factor come from?

Alternatively, perhaps I missed something in defining \( q(x) \). Let me check:

I set \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \). For \( x = 2, 3, \dots, 7 \), \( q(x) = 0 \). So, \( x = 2, 3, \dots, 7 \) are roots, but is there another root? Wait, the equation \( (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x = 0 \) might have another root. Let me see.

Let me plug in \( x = 1 \). Then, \( (1 - 1)p(1) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1 \neq 0 \). Similarly, \( x = -1 \) gives \( (1 - 1)p(-1) - (-1) = 0 + 1 = 1 \neq 0 \). So, perhaps \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not roots. So maybe my initial thought was correct that \( q(x) \) only has roots at \( x = 2, 3, \dots, 7 \), but it's degree 7, so there must be an extra root.

Wait, perhaps \( q(x) \) isn't just those roots. Maybe I need to check if \( q(x) \) has another root. Let's analyze \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \). Suppose \( x \) is such that \( (x^2 - 1)p(x) = x \). So, unless \( x^2 - 1 = 0 \), which would be \( x = 1 \) or \( x = -1 \), but that doesn't necessarily make the equation hold. So, perhaps \( q(x) \) doesn't have roots elsewhere.

Wait, but then \( q(x) \) is a degree 7 polynomial with 6 roots, which would mean it's equal to \( (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)(ax + b) \), where \( ax + b \) is a linear term. Hmm, but I don't know \( a \) and \( b \).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a wrong definition of \( q(x) \). Maybe I need to define it differently.

Wait, another thought. Since \( p(x) \) is a degree 5 polynomial, and \( \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) can be expressed as a partial fraction: \( \frac{1}{2(n - 1)} + \frac{1}{2(n + 1)} \). Maybe I can express \( p(x) \) in terms of partial fractions.

But \( p(x) \) is a polynomial, so it's a single rational function, not a sum of fractions. Maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, going back. So, \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \). We know that \( q(n) = 0 \) for \( n = 2, 3, \dots, 7 \). So, \( q(x) \) is a degree 7 polynomial with roots at \( x = 2, 3, \dots, 7 \). So, \( q(x) = c(x - 2)(x - 3)\dots(x - 7) \), where \( c \) is a constant.

But wait, earlier I thought that \( q(x) \) is degree 7, so that product is degree 6, so to get degree 7, we need an extra factor. But I thought \( q(x) \) didn't have another root. Maybe I need to consider the leading coefficient.

Wait, perhaps \( q(x) \) is equal to \( c(x - 2)(x - 3)\dots(x - 7)(x + a) \), but I don't know \( a \). Alternatively, maybe I can compute the leading coefficient of \( q(x) \) and set it equal to the leading coefficient of \( c(x - 2)\dots(x - 7) \).

Let me compute the leading term of \( q(x) \). \( (x^2 - 1)p(x) \) is degree 7, with leading term \( x^2 \cdot \) leading term of \( p(x) \). Since \( p(x) \) is degree 5, let's say \( p(x) = a_5x^5 + \dots \). Then, \( x^2 \cdot a_5x^5 = a_5x^7 \). Then, \( (x^2 - 1)p(x) \) has leading term \( a_5x^7 \). Then, subtracting \( x \), the leading term remains \( a_5x^7 \).

On the other hand, \( c(x - 2)(x - 3)\dots(x - 7) \) is a degree 6 polynomial, so its leading term is \( c x^6 \). But \( q(x) \) is degree 7, so unless \( c = 0 \), which would make \( q(x) \) identically zero, which can't be because \( p(x) \) isn't necessarily zero. So, maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, hold on. If \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \) is a degree 7 polynomial with 6 roots, but we need it to have 7 roots to factor as \( c(x - 2)(x - 3)\dots(x - 7) \). So, maybe I have to consider that \( q(x) \) has another root?

But earlier, I checked \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \), but plugging in those values didn't give zero. So perhaps \( q(x) \) doesn't have those roots, which would mean it's degree 7 with 6 roots, so it's not fully factored.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps consider the polynomial \( p(x) - \frac{x}{x^2 - 1} \). But \( p(x) \) is a polynomial, and \( \frac{x}{x^2 - 1} \) is a rational function, so their difference is another rational function. But unless we can find some relation.

Wait, maybe I can consider the function \( f(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \). As before, \( f(n) = 0 \) for \( n = 2, 3, \dots, 7 \). So, \( f(x) \) has roots at those points. So, \( f(x) = k(x - 2)(x - 3)\dots(x - 7) \), but \( f(x) \) is degree 7, so \( k \) is a constant.

But wait, \( f(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \). The leading term of \( f(x) \) is the same as \( (x^2 - 1)p(x) \), since subtracting \( x \) won't affect the leading term. So, leading term of \( f(x) \) is \( a_5x^{7} \) where \( a_5 \) is the leading coefficient of \( p(x) \).

On the other hand, \( k(x - 2)(x - 3)\dots(x - 7) \) is a degree 7 polynomial, with leading coefficient \( k \). Therefore, equating leading coefficients, we have \( a_5 = k \).

But wait, how do we find \( k \)? Maybe by considering another value of \( x \) where we can compute \( f(x) \). For example, plug in \( x = 1 \) or \( x = -1 \), which are not in the original points.

But let's try \( x = 1 \). Then, \( f(1) = (1 - 1)p(1) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1 \). On the other hand, \( f(1) = k(1 - 2)(1 - 3)\dots(1 - 7) \). Let's compute that.

Compute \( (1 - 2)(1 - 3)(1 - 4)(1 - 5)(1 - 6)(1 - 7) \). That is \( (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6) \). Let's compute step by step:

- \( (-1)(-2) = 2 \)
- \( 2 \times (-3) = -6 \)
- \( -6 \times (-4) = 24 \)
- \( 24 \times (-5) = -120 \)
- \( -120 \times (-6) = 720 \)

So, \( f(1) = k \times 720 \). But we also know \( f(1) = -1 \). Therefore, \( 720k = -1 \), so \( k = -1/720 \).

Great, so \( f(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x = -\frac{1}{720}(x - 2)(x - 3)\dots(x - 7) \).

Now, to find \( p(8) \), let's substitute \( x = 8 \) into the equation.

So, \( f(8) = (8^2 - 1)p(8) - 8 = (64 - 1)p(8) - 8 = 63p(8) - 8 \).

On the other hand, \( f(8) = -\frac{1}{720}(8 - 2)(8 - 3)\dots(8 - 7) \).

Compute \( (8 - 2)(8 - 3)(8 - 4)(8 - 5)(8 - 6)(8 - 7) \):

- \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \)
- \( 30 \times 4 = 120 \)
- \( 120 \times 3 = 360 \)
- \( 360 \times 2 = 720 \)
- \( 720 \times 1 = 720 \)

So, \( f(8) = -\frac{1}{720} \times 720 = -1 \).

Therefore, \( 63p(8) - 8 = -1 \).

Solving for \( p(8) \):

\( 63p(8) = -1 + 8 = 7 \)

So, \( p(8) = 7 / 63 = 1/9 \).

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just verify the calculations:

- \( f(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x = -1/720 \times (x - 2)(x - 3)...(x - 7) \)
- At \( x = 8 \), the RHS is \( -1/720 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = -1/720 \times 720 = -1 \)
- So, \( 63p(8) - 8 = -1 \) leads to \( 63p(8) = 7 \) hence \( p(8) = 1/9 \)

Seems correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{9}}
</think>

Given a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree 5 such that
\[ p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \]
for \( n = 2, 3, 4, \dots, 7 \), we need to find \( p(8) \).

First, we define a new polynomial \( q(x) \) such that
\[ q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x. \]
For \( n = 2, 3, \dots, 7 \), we have \( q(n) = 0 \), meaning \( q(x) \) has roots at \( x = 2, 3, \dots, 7 \). Therefore, \( q(x) \) can be written as
\[ q(x) = k(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7), \]
where \( k \) is a constant.

Since \( q(x) \) is a degree 7 polynomial, we need to determine the constant \( k \). We evaluate \( q(x) \) at \( x = 1 \):
\[ q(1) = (1^2 - 1)p(1) - 1 = -1. \]
On the other hand,
\[ q(1) = k(1 - 2)(1 - 3)(1 - 4)(1 - 5)(1 - 6)(1 - 7) = k(-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6) = 720k. \]
Thus, we have
\[ 720k = -1 \implies k = -\frac{1}{720}. \]

Therefore, we can write
\[ q(x) = -\frac{1}{720}(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7). \]

To find \( p(8) \), we substitute \( x = 8 \) into the equation:
\[ q(8) = (8^2 - 1)p(8) - 8 = 63p(8) - 8. \]
We also compute \( q(8) \):
\[ q(8) = -\frac{1}{720}(8 - 2)(8 - 3)(8 - 4)(8 - 5)(8 - 6)(8 - 7) = -\frac{1}{720} \times 720 = -1. \]

Thus,
\[ 63p(8) - 8 = -1 \implies 63p(8) = 7 \implies p(8) = \frac{7}{63} = \frac{1}{9}. \]

The final answer is
\[ \boxed{\dfrac{1}{9}}. \]
