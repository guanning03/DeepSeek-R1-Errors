Question:
If $\omega^{1997} = 1$ and $\omega \neq 1,$ then evaluate
\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}}.\]

Correct Answer:
Note that
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997 - k}} &= \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{\omega^k}{\omega^k + \omega^{1997}} \\
&= \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{\omega^k}{\omega^k + 1} \\
&= \frac{1 + \omega^k}{1 + \omega^k} = 1.
\end{align*}Thus, we can pair the terms
\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega}, \ \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}, \ \dots, \ \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1995}}, \ \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1996}}\]into $1996/2 = 998$ pairs, so that the sum of the numbers in each pair is 1.  Also, $\frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}} = \frac{1}{2},$ so the sum works out to $998 + \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1997}{2}}.$

Gold:
\frac{1997}{2}

Wrong Prediction:
998

Wrong Answer:
Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, we have ω^1997 = 1, and ω ≠ 1. We need to evaluate the sum:

S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) + … + 1/(1 + ω^{1997}).

Hmm, okay. First, ω is a 1997th root of unity, right? Since ω^1997 = 1 and ω ≠ 1, it's a primitive root. So, this sum involves all the non-trivial 1997th roots of unity. That might be useful.

I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties when it comes to sums. Maybe I can use some of those properties here. Let's think about what's being asked.

We have a sum of reciprocals of 1 + ω^k, for k from 1 to 1997. Hmm. Maybe I can find a way to combine these fractions or relate them to something else. Alternatively, perhaps there's a clever manipulation or identity that can help simplify this sum.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when dealing with roots of unity, it's useful to pair terms together or to consider the sum over all roots. Since ω is a root of x^1997 - 1 = 0, except for x = 1, which is already excluded.

Let me note that the minimal polynomial for ω is the 1997th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_1997(x) = x^1996 + x^1995 + … + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that directly helps, but maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that for each ω^k, since it's a root of unity, 1/(1 + ω^k) can be expressed in terms of something else. Let me think.

Wait, I remember that 1/(1 + ω^k) can be rewritten. Maybe by multiplying numerator and denominator by something. Let me try:

1/(1 + ω^k) = (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

Is that right? Let's check:

(1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}) = [1 - ω^k]/[(1 - ω^k)(1 + ω^k)] ) = 1/(1 + ω^k). Yes, that works. So, that's a useful identity. So, maybe we can express each term as (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

So, S = Σ_{k=1}^{1997} (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

Hmm, not sure if that helps, but maybe. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about summing over all the roots of x^1997 - 1 = 0, excluding 1.

Wait, another idea: perhaps consider the sum S + 1/(1 + 1). Since ω^0 = 1, which is excluded, but if I include it, maybe the total sum from k=0 to 1996 would have some symmetry.

Wait, let me see. Let's define S_total = Σ_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(1 + ω^k). Then, S = S_total - 1/(1 + 1) = S_total - 1/2. So, if I can find S_total, then I can find S.

Is S_total easier to compute? Maybe, because it's the sum over all 1997th roots of unity, including 1. Hmm.

Let me denote ζ = ω, so ζ^1997 = 1. Then S_total = Σ_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k).

I think I remember that such sums can be evaluated using properties of roots of unity or generating functions. Let me try to recall.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that 1/(1 + ζ^k) can be expressed as (1 - ζ^k)/(1 - ζ^{2k}), as I did before. So, S_total = Σ_{k=0}^{1996} (1 - ζ^k)/(1 - ζ^{2k}).

Hmm, but ζ^{2k} is another root of unity, but perhaps not primitive. Wait, 2k modulo 1997. Since 1997 is prime, right? Let me check: 1997 divided by, say, 3 is 665.666..., so it's not divisible by 3. 1997 divided by 7 is around 285.285..., not integer. I think 1997 is a prime number. Yes, 1997 is indeed a prime.

Therefore, for k from 1 to 1996, ζ^{2k} is another primitive 1997th root of unity unless k is such that 2k ≡ 0 mod 1997, which would require k ≡ 0 mod 1997, but k is less than 1997, so 2k is never 0 mod 1997. Hence, ζ^{2k} is also primitive for each k ≠ 0.

Wait, but when k=0, ζ^{0}=1, so 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2, which is the term we're subtracting later.

So, going back, S_total = Σ_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k) = 1/2 + Σ_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k).

Let me define T = Σ_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k). So, S = T - 1/2.

So, if I can compute T, then I can find S.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the sum T can be related to the roots of the cyclotomic polynomial.

Wait, another idea: perhaps consider the function f(x) = Σ_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(x - ζ^k). Then, f(-1) would be Σ_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(-1 - ζ^k) = - Σ_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k) = -S_total.

But I don't know if that helps. Maybe not directly.

Alternatively, perhaps consider writing 1/(1 + ζ^k) as (1 - ζ^k)/(1 - ζ^{2k}), as before.

So, T = Σ_{k=1}^{1996} (1 - ζ^k)/(1 - ζ^{2k}).

Hmm, but 1 - ζ^k and 1 - ζ^{2k} are both related to cyclotomic polynomials.

Wait, perhaps it's useful to note that 1 - ζ^{2k} factors as (1 - ζ^k)(1 + ζ^k). So, 1/(1 + ζ^k) = (1 - ζ^k)/(1 - ζ^{2k}), which we already have.

But maybe we can think of the sum T as Σ_{k=1}^{1996} (1 - ζ^k)/(1 - ζ^{2k}).

Alternatively, perhaps we can separate the numerator:

(1 - ζ^k)/(1 - ζ^{2k}) = 1/(1 + ζ^k).

Wait, that's just going back to where we started.

Hmm, maybe we can think of T as Σ_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k). Maybe if I consider the sum over k=1 to 1996 of 1/(1 + ζ^k), and notice that the terms come in pairs.

Since ζ^k and ζ^{1997 - k} are complex conjugates because ζ is on the unit circle.

So, 1/(1 + ζ^k) + 1/(1 + ζ^{1997 - k}) = [1/(1 + ζ^k)] + [1/(1 + ζ^{-k})] since ζ^{1997} = 1, so ζ^{1997 - k} = ζ^{-k}.

So, let's compute this sum:

1/(1 + ζ^k) + 1/(1 + ζ^{-k}) = [1/(1 + ζ^k)] + [ζ^k/(ζ^k + 1)] = [1 + ζ^k]/(1 + ζ^k) = 1.

Whoa, that's interesting. So, each pair sums to 1.

Therefore, since 1997 is odd, the exponents k and 1997 - k are distinct for k from 1 to 998, because 1997 is 2*998 + 1. So, we have 998 pairs, each summing to 1, and the middle term when k = (1997 + 1)/2 = 999, which is ζ^{999}.

Wait, so for k=999, ζ^{999} is equal to ζ^{(1997 + 1)/2} = ζ^{999}, which is a primitive root as well.

So, let's compute that middle term:

1/(1 + ζ^{999}).

But wait, ζ^{999} is equal to ζ^{(1997 - 998)} = ζ^{-998}, right? Since ζ^{1997} = 1.

Wait, but ζ^{999} is the same as ζ^{(1997 + 1)/2}, which is the same as ζ^{999}.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that ζ^{999} is a primitive 1997th root of unity, as 1997 is prime, so all exponents except 0 are primitive.

So, going back, in the sum T = Σ_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k), we have 998 pairs each summing to 1, and the middle term, which is 1/(1 + ζ^{999}).

Wait, but hold on: if k goes from 1 to 1996, which is 1996 terms, which is even? Wait, 1996 is even, so 1996 = 2*998. So, actually, there are 998 pairs, each of which is ζ^k and ζ^{1997 - k}, right?

So, for k=1 and k=1996, which is ζ^{1996} = ζ^{-1}, so 1/(1 + ζ) + 1/(1 + ζ^{-1}) = 1 as we saw.

Similarly, for k=2 and k=1995, it's 1/(1 + ζ^2) + 1/(1 + ζ^{-2}) = 1, and so on, up to k=998 and k=999. Wait, hold on: k=998 and k=999? Wait, because 1997 is odd, so 1997 - 998 = 999. So, yes, that's right.

So, we have 998 pairs, each summing to 1, so the total sum is 998 * 1 = 998. But wait, that would be for T. But T is Σ_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k). So, T = 998.

But wait, hold on: 1996 terms, each pair of two terms summing to 1, so 998 pairs, each sum 1, so 998 total.

Therefore, T = 998. Then, S = T - 1/2 = 998 - 1/2 = 997.5, which is 1995/2.

Wait, but 998 is 1996/2, so 1996/2 - 1/2 = (1996 - 1)/2 = 1995/2.

So, is that the answer? 1995/2.

Wait, but let me verify my reasoning. So, we had T = Σ_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k) = 998, because each pair sums to 1, and there are 998 pairs.

But hold on, 1996 terms, each pair is two terms, so 998 pairs, each summing to 1, so total 998.

Therefore, S = T - 1/2 = 998 - 1/2 = 997.5.

But 997.5 is equal to 1995/2. So, yes, the sum is 1995/2.

Wait, but let me think about another approach to confirm.

Alternatively, consider that S_total = Σ_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k). We can write this as 1/(1 + 1) + Σ_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k) = 1/2 + T.

So, S_total = 1/2 + T.

But is there another way to compute S_total?

Yes, perhaps. Let's consider using the formula for the sum of reciprocals of linear functions of roots of unity.

I recall that for ζ being a primitive nth root of unity, Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(x - ζ^k) = n/(x^n - 1). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me think. If we have f(x) = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(x - ζ^k), then f(x) = n/(x^n - 1). Because the denominator is the polynomial whose roots are ζ^k, so Σ 1/(x - ζ^k) = derivative of log(x^n - 1) or something? Wait, maybe not exactly.

Wait, let's recall that Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(x - ζ^k) = (x^{n} - 1)'/(x^{n} - 1) = n x^{n - 1}/(x^n - 1). Hmm, no, that's the derivative.

Wait, perhaps f(x) = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(x - ζ^k) = (1/(x - ζ^0)) + (1/(x - ζ^1)) + ... + (1/(x - ζ^{n-1})). I think this can be expressed as (x^{n} - 1)'/(x^{n} - 1) which is n x^{n - 1}/(x^n - 1). So, f(x) = n x^{n - 1}/(x^n - 1).

Wait, let me test this with n=2: f(x) = 1/(x - 1) + 1/(x + 1) = [ (x + 1) + (x - 1) ] / (x^2 - 1) = (2x)/(x^2 - 1). Which is equal to 2x^{2 - 1}/(x^2 - 1). So, yes, that works.

Therefore, for general n, f(x) = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(x - ζ^k) = n x^{n - 1}/(x^n - 1).

So, in our case, n = 1997, and x = -1, because we have 1/(1 + ζ^k) = 1/(-1 - ζ^k). So, S_total = Σ_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k) = Σ_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(-1 - ζ^k) = - Σ_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k) = -f(-1), where f(x) = Σ_{k=0}^{n - 1} 1/(x - ζ^k) = n x^{n - 1}/(x^n - 1).

Therefore, f(-1) = 1997*(-1)^{1996}/((-1)^{1997} - 1) = 1997*(1)/(-1 - 1) = 1997/(-2) = -1997/2.

Hence, S_total = -f(-1) = -(-1997/2) = 1997/2.

Wait, so S_total = 1997/2. But earlier, we had S_total = 1/2 + T, so 1997/2 = 1/2 + T, which implies that T = 1997/2 - 1/2 = 1996/2 = 998.

Which matches our previous result. So, T = 998, so S = 998 - 1/2 = 1995/2.

Therefore, the value of the sum is 1995/2.

But let me just double-check everything to make sure.

We started by noting that ζ is a primitive 1997th root of unity, so the sum S_total = Σ_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k).

We used the formula for f(x) = Σ_{k=0}^{n - 1} 1/(x - ζ^k) = n x^{n - 1}/(x^n - 1).

Then, evaluated at x = -1, so f(-1) = 1997*(-1)^{1996}/((-1)^{1997} - 1) = 1997*1/(-1 -1) = -1997/2.

Therefore, S_total = -f(-1) = 1997/2.

Which is equal to Σ_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k) = 1997/2.

Then, since S = Σ_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k) = S_total - 1/(1 + 1) = 1997/2 - 1/2 = 1996/2 = 998.

Wait, hold on! Wait, that can't be. Wait, S = T = 998, but earlier we thought S = T - 1/2.

Wait, no, actually, S_total = Σ_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k) = 1997/2.

But S = Σ_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k) = S_total - 1/(1 + 1) = 1997/2 - 1/2 = (1997 - 1)/2 = 1996/2 = 998.

Wait, so S = 998.

But earlier, when we considered pairing terms, we thought that S = 998 - 1/2. Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I made a confusion in notation.

Wait, let's clarify:

Let me denote S_total = Σ_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k) = 1997/2.

Then, S = Σ_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k) = S_total - 1/(1 + 1) = 1997/2 - 1/2 = 1996/2 = 998.

So, that's correct. So, in that case, S = 998.

But earlier, when I considered pairing terms, I thought that each pair sums to 1, with 998 pairs, so total 998, which matches.

Therefore, S = 998.

Wait, but in the beginning, I thought S = T - 1/2, but now, actually, it's S = T, where T is Σ_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k), which is equal to 998.

So, perhaps my initial confusion was because I misapplied the definitions.

Hence, the correct answer is 998.

Wait, so why did I get 1995/2 earlier?

Because I thought S = T - 1/2, but in reality, S is equal to T, because S is Σ_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k), which is T.

Wait, so let's clarify:

Originally, S = Σ_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k) = T = 998.

But earlier, I thought S = T - 1/2, which was incorrect because S_total included k=0, which is 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2, so S = S_total - 1/2 = 1997/2 - 1/2 = 1996/2 = 998.

Therefore, yes, S = 998.

Wait, so my initial conclusion was wrong because I misapplied the formula for S_total.

So, actually, S = 998.

But wait, 1997 is prime, so that's correct. Wait, 1997 is prime, so all the roots except 1 are primitive.

Wait, another way to test with a smaller prime, say, 3.

Let me test with n = 3.

So, ω^3 = 1, ω ≠ 1. So, ω = e^{2πi/3}.

Compute S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω^2).

Compute S_total = 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω^2) = 1/2 + S.

Compute f(x) = Σ_{k=0}^{2} 1/(x - ω^k) = 3 x^{2}/(x^3 - 1). So, f(-1) = 3*(-1)^2/((-1)^3 - 1) = 3*1/(-1 -1) = 3/(-2) = -3/2. Hence, S_total = -f(-1) = 3/2.

Therefore, S_total = 3/2 = 1/2 + S => S = 3/2 - 1/2 = 1.

But compute S manually: 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω^2).

Since ω = e^{2πi/3} = (-1 + i√3)/2, so 1 + ω = 1 + (-1 + i√3)/2 = (2 -1 + i√3)/2 = (1 + i√3)/2. So, 1/(1 + ω) = 2/(1 + i√3) = 2*(1 - i√3)/(1 + 3) = (1 - i√3)/2.

Similarly, 1/(1 + ω^2) is the conjugate, since ω^2 is the conjugate of ω. So, 1/(1 + ω^2) = (1 + i√3)/2.

Adding them together: (1 - i√3)/2 + (1 + i√3)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So, yes, S = 1, which is equal to (n - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. So, the formula holds.

Therefore, in our case, n = 1997, so S = (1997 - 1)/2 = 1996/2 = 998. So, the answer is 998.

Earlier, I thought I got 1995/2, but that was incorrect because of miscalculating the relation between S_total and S.

So, in conclusion, the sum is 998.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1995}{2}}

Wait, hold on. Wait, in the small case, n=3, S=1, which is (3-1)/2=1, correct. So, in our case, n=1997, so (1997 -1)/2=1996/2=998.

But in the initial problem, we have S = Σ_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + ζ^k). So, according to the small case, that should be (n -1)/2 = 998.

But wait, wait, in the small case, n=3, S=1= (3-1)/2=1. So, in our case, n=1997, so (1997 -1)/2=998.

But in the initial problem, the answer came out as 1995/2, which is 997.5, which is not integer, which is odd because 1996 terms, each 1/(1 + ζ^k), which is likely to sum to an integer or a half-integer.

But 1995/2 is 997.5, which is not integer, but 998 is integer.

Wait, hold on, I think I have a confusion here.

Wait, in the small case, n=3, S=1, which is (n-1)/2=1.

But according to the formula, S = n x^{n-1}/(x^n -1) evaluated at x=-1, so for n=3, S_total = 3*(-1)^{2}/((-1)^3 -1)=3*1/(-1 -1)= -3/2, so S = S_total -1/(1 +1)= -3/2 -1/2= -2, which is not correct.

Wait, that contradicts the manual computation. Wait, so there must be something wrong with my approach.

Wait, no, in the small case, n=3, S_total =1/(1 +1)+1/(1 + ω)+1/(1 + ω^2)=1/2 + S= 1/2 + 1= 3/2.

But according to the formula, f(-1)=3*(-1)^{2}/((-1)^3 -1)=3*1/(-1 -1)= -3/2, so S_total = -f(-1)=3/2, which matches.

So, S= S_total -1/(1 +1)=3/2 -1/2=1, which is correct.

Wait, so in general, S = S_total -1/2= (n x^{n-1}/(x^n -1)) evaluated at x=-1, then take - that value.

Wait, no, in the small case, f(-1)= -3/2, so S_total= -f(-1)=3/2, and S= S_total -1/2=1.

Similarly, for n=1997, f(-1)= -1997/2, so S_total=1997/2, then S= S_total -1/2=1997/2 -1/2=1996/2=998.

So, in that case, S=998, which is integer.

But in the initial problem, the answer came as 1995/2, which is 997.5, which is 997.5, which is not integer.

Wait, but in the small case, 1/(1 + ω^0) +1/(1 + ω^1)+1/(1 + ω^2)=1/2 +1/(1 + ω)+1/(1 + ω^2)= 3/2.

But in the problem, we are excluding 1/(1 +1)=1/2, so S=1/(1 + ω)+...=1.

But in the problem statement, the user wrote: If ω^{1997}=1 and ω ≠1, then evaluate

1/(1 + ω) +1/(1 + ω^2)+…+1/(1 + ω^{1997}).

Wait, that's 1997 terms, but in the small case, n=3, we have 3 terms: k=0,1,2, so for n=3, it's 1/(1 +1) +1/(1 + ω)+1/(1 + ω^2)=3/2, but in the problem, starting at k=1, so 2 terms:1/(1 + ω)+1/(1 + ω^2)=1.

But in the initial problem, the user wrote: evaluate

1/(1 + ω)+1/(1 + ω^2)+…+1/(1 + ω^{1997}).

So, that's 1997 terms, from k=1 to k=1997.

But 1997 is equal to the exponent, so wait, ω^{1997}=1, so the last term is 1/(1 + ω^{1997})=1/(1 +1)=1/2.

Therefore, in the initial problem, it's S = Σ_{k=1}^{1997}1/(1 + ω^k).

But in our small case, n=3, it's 1/(1 + ω^1)+1/(1 + ω^2)+1/(1 + ω^3)=1/(1 + ω)+1/(1 + ω^2)+1/(1 +1)=1/(1 + ω)+1/(1 + ω^2)+1/2.

Wait, so in that case, S_total =1/(1 +1)+1/(1 + ω)+1/(1 + ω^2)=1/2 + S.

Which is consistent with the previous.

So, in the initial problem, we have S = Σ_{k=1}^{1997}1/(1 + ω^k)= Σ_{k=1}^{1997}1/(1 + ω^k)= S_total -1/(1 +1)=1997/2 -1/2=1996/2=998.

But in the small case, n=3, S=1, which is equal to (n-1)/2=1.

So, in the problem, n=1997, so S=(n -1)/2=998.

But the initial thought was 1995/2, which is incorrect.

So, the correct answer is 998.

Wait, but in the first approach, I thought that S = T -1/2, where T was Σ_{k=1}^{1996}1/(1 + ζ^k)=998, so S=998 -1/2=997.5, but that was wrong because S is actually Σ_{k=1}^{1997}1/(1 + ζ^k)=998.

So, the confusion was in the number of terms. The problem says Σ_{k=1}^{1997}1/(1 + ω^k). So, starting from k=1 to k=1997, which includes k=1997, which is ω^{1997}=1, so 1/(1 +1)=1/2.

So, in the small case, n=3, the sum has k=1,2,3, so S=1/(1 + ω)+1/(1 + ω^2)+1/2=1.

Which is (n -1)/2=1.

Similarly, for n=1997, S=Σ_{k=1}^{1997}1/(1 + ω^k)= (n -1)/2=1996/2=998.

So, the correct answer is 998.

But wait, in the initial problem statement, the user wrote:

"If ω^{1997}=1 and ω ≠1, then evaluate

\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}}.\]"

So, it's from k=1 to k=1997, so that's 1997 terms. So, n=1997, so S=(n -1)/2=998.

Therefore, the correct answer is 998, which is 1996/2.

But in the earlier step, I thought S=1995/2, which is wrong because I miscounted the number of terms.

So, to conclude, the correct answer is 998, which is 1996/2.

But in the initial process, I thought S = T -1/2, where T=998, so 998 -1/2=997.5, which is 1995/2.

But in reality, S is the sum from k=1 to 1997, which includes the term 1/(1 + ω^{1997})=1/2, so S = Σ_{k=1}^{1996}1/(1 + ω^k) +1/(1 +1)= T +1/2.

Therefore, since T=998, then S=998 +1/2=998.5=1997/2.

Wait, hold on, that's conflicting.

Wait, no, in the small case, n=3, S_total=3/2, which includes k=0. So, S= S_total -1/2=1.

Similarly, in our case, S= Σ_{k=1}^{1997}1/(1 + ω^k)= Σ_{k=0}^{1997}1/(1 + ω^k) -1/(1 +1)= S_total -1/2=1997/2 -1/2=1996/2=998.

So, in the small case, S_total=3/2, S=1. Which is correct.

Thus, in our problem, S=1997/2 -1/2=1996/2=998.

Therefore, the correct answer is 998.

But in the initial problem statement, the user wrote: Σ_{k=1}^{1997}1/(1 + ω^k), which is 1997 terms, including k=1997, which is 1/(1 +1)=1/2.

Therefore, S= Σ_{k=1}^{1997}1/(1 + ω^k)=998.

Hence, the final answer is 998, which is 1996/2.

But wait, 1996/2 is 998, yes.

Wait, but when n=1997, the sum from k=1 to k=n of 1/(1 + ω^k)= (n -1)/2=998.

So, the correct answer is 998.

But in the initial problem, the user had written S= Σ_{k=1}^{1997}1/(1 + ω^k)=998.

So, why did I previously get 1995/2? Because I confused the number of terms.

Wait, in the initial problem, the user wrote: "If ω^{1997}=1 and ω ≠1, then evaluate

\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}}.\]"

So, that's 1997 terms, from k=1 to k=1997.

But in the small case, n=3, the sum is from k=1 to k=3, which is 3 terms, so the formula is (n -1)/2.

Wait, no, in n=3, sum from k=1 to k=3 is 3 terms, but the formula is (n -1)/2=1.

Similarly, in n=1997, sum from k=1 to k=1997 is 1997 terms, so (n -1)/2=998.

Therefore, the answer is 998, which is 1996/2.

Hence, changing my initial incorrect conclusion.

So, final answer is 998.

But wait, in the small case, n=3, sum from k=1 to 3 is 1/(1 + ω) +1/(1 + ω^2) +1/(1 +1)=1/(1 + ω) +1/(1 + ω^2) +1/2=1.

Which is indeed (n -1)/2=1.

Similarly, in our problem, sum from k=1 to 1997 is 1997 terms, which is (1997 -1)/2=998.

Therefore, the correct answer is 998.

So, in conclusion, after all this thinking, the answer is 998.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1995}{2}}

Wait, wait, no, that's inconsistent. In both the small case and the general case, the answer is (n -1)/2. For n=3, it's 1. For n=1997, it's 998.

But in the initial problem, the user wrote:

"If ω^{1997}=1 and ω ≠1, then evaluate

\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}}.\]"

So, that's 1997 terms, from k=1 to k=1997. So, the answer is (1997 -1)/2=998.

But wait, in the small case, n=3, sum from k=1 to 3 is 3 terms, which is 1/(1 + ω) +1/(1 + ω^2)+1/(1 +1)=1.

Similarly, in our problem, sum from k=1 to 1997 is 1997 terms, which is 998.

Therefore, the answer is 998, not 1995/2.

But in the initial problem, the user wrote: S = Σ_{k=1}^{1997}1/(1 + ω^k)= (n -1)/2=1996/2=998.

So, the correct answer is 998.

But in the initial thought process, I mistakenly thought S=1995/2, but that was wrong because I didn't account for the term 1/(1 + ω^{1997})=1/2.

So, in summary, the correct answer is 998.

But wait, in the earlier part, I thought S_total=1997/2, which includes the term 1/(1 +1)=1/2, so S= S_total -1/2=998.

So, in conclusion, the correct answer is 998, which is 1996/2.

Thus, boxed, it's \boxed{\dfrac{1996}{2}}, but 1996/2 is 998, which is an integer. So, \boxed{998}.

But in the initial problem, the user might have written 1995/2, but according to the correct calculation, it's 998.

Wait, but the user's problem is from k=1 to 1997, which is 1997 terms, so 1997 -1=1996, divided by 2 is 998.

Therefore, the correct answer is 998.

Wait, but 1997 -1=1996, 1996/2=998.

Therefore, \boxed{998}.

But in the beginning, I thought 1995/2, but that was incorrect.

Thus, after careful consideration, the correct answer is \boxed{998}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{998}
</think>

Given \(\omega^{1997} = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\), we need to evaluate the sum:

\[
S = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}}.
\]

First, we note that \(\omega\) is a primitive 1997th root of unity. The sum \(S\) includes terms from \(k = 1\) to \(k = 1997\). 

We use the property that the sum of reciprocals of linear functions of roots of unity can be evaluated using the formula for the sum of such terms. Specifically, we use the fact that:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{x - \omega^k} = \frac{n x^{n-1}}{x^n - 1}
\]

where \(\omega\) is a primitive \(n\)th root of unity. For our problem, \(n = 1997\), so we consider the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k}
\]

Evaluating this at \(x = -1\), we get:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} = \frac{1997 \cdot (-1)^{1996}}{(-1)^{1997} - 1} = \frac{1997 \cdot 1}{-1 - 1} = \frac{1997}{-2} = -\frac{1997}{2}
\]

Thus, the sum from \(k = 0\) to \(1996\) is \(-\frac{1997}{2}\). Since we need the sum from \(k = 1\) to \(1997\), we subtract the term when \(k = 0\):

\[
S = \sum_{k=1}^{1997} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} = \sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} - \frac{1}{1 + 1} = -\frac{1997}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{1998}{2} = 998
\]

Thus, the value of the sum is:

\[
\boxed{998}
\]
