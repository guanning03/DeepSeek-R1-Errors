Question:
The function $f$ satisfies the functional equation
\[f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1\]for all real numbers $x$ and $y.$  If $f(1) = 1,$ then find all integers $n$ such that $f(n) = n.$  Enter all such integers, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
Setting $x = y = 0,$ we get
\[2f(0) = f(0) - 1,\]so $f(0) = -1.$

Setting $y = 1,$ we get
\[f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1,\]so
\[f(x + 1) - f(x) = x + 2.\]Thus,
\begin{align*}
f(2) - f(1) &= 1 + 2, \\
f(3) - f(2) &= 2 + 2, \\
f(4) - f(3) &= 3 + 2, \\
&\dots, \\
f(n) - f(n - 1) &= (n - 1) + 2.
\end{align*}Adding all the equations, we get
\[f(n) - f(1) = 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + (n - 1) + 2(n - 1) = \frac{(n - 1)n}{2} + 2n - 2 = \frac{n^2 + 3n - 4}{2},\]so
\[f(n) = \frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2}\]for all positive integers $n.$

Setting $x = -n$ and $y = n,$ where $n$ is a positive integer, we get
\[f(-n) + f(n) = f(0) + n^2 - 1.\]Then
\[f(-n) = n^2 - f(n) + f(0) - 1 = n^2 - \frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2} - 2 = \frac{n^2 - 3n - 2}{2}.\]Thus, the formula
\[f(n) = \frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2}\]holds for all integers $n.$

We want to solve $f(n) = n,$ or
\[\frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2} = n.\]Then $n^2 + 3n - 2 = 2n,$ or $n^2 + n - 2 = 0.$  This factors as $(n - 1)(n + 2) = 0,$ so the solutions are $n = \boxed{1,-2}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this functional equation problem here. The function \( f \) satisfies the equation:
\[
f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1
\]
for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \). Also, it's given that \( f(1) = 1 \). I need to find all integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \).

Hmm, functional equations can sometimes be tricky, but usually substituting specific values for \( x \) and \( y \) can help simplify things. Let me try plugging in some numbers and see if I can figure out a pattern or even the general form of \( f(x) \).

First, let me try plugging in \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \). That often helps in these problems.

Substituting \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \):
\[
f(0) + f(0) = f(0 + 0) - (0)(0) - 1
\]
Simplify that:
\[
2f(0) = f(0) - 0 - 1
\]
Which simplifies further to:
\[
2f(0) = f(0) - 1
\]
Subtract \( f(0) \) from both sides:
\[
f(0) = -1
\]
Okay, so \( f(0) = -1 \). That's a good start.

Next, maybe I can try setting \( y = 1 \) since I know \( f(1) = 1 \). Let me see what happens when \( y = 1 \).

Let \( y = 1 \) in the original equation:
\[
f(x) + f(1) = f(x + 1) - x(1) - 1
\]
Simplify that:
\[
f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1
\]
So, I can rearrange it to express \( f(x + 1) \) in terms of \( f(x) \):
\[
f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1 + x + 1
\]
Simplify:
\[
f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2
\]
Hmm, this looks like a recursive relation. It relates \( f \) at \( x + 1 \) to \( f \) at \( x \). Maybe I can use this to find a general formula for \( f(x) \).

Let me try to compute \( f(2) \). Since \( f(1) = 1 \), setting \( x = 1 \) in the equation above:
\[
f(1 + 1) = f(1) + 1 + 2
\]
Which is:
\[
f(2) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
\]
So, \( f(2) = 4 \).

Similarly, let me compute \( f(3) \):
\[
f(2 + 1) = f(2) + 2 + 2 = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8
\]
So, \( f(3) = 8 \).

Wait, I see a pattern here. \( f(1) = 1 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), \( f(3) = 8 \). Hmm, that seems like \( f(n) = n^2 \) or something else? Wait, 1, 4, 8... Let me check \( f(4) \).

\( f(3 + 1) = f(3) + 3 + 2 = 8 + 3 + 2 = 13 \). So, \( f(4) = 13 \). Hmm, that doesn't fit \( n^2 \) exactly. Let me see the differences:

- \( f(1) = 1 \)
- \( f(2) = 4 \) (difference +3)
- \( f(3) = 8 \) (difference +4)
- \( f(4) = 13 \) (difference +5)

Wait, the differences are increasing by 1 each time. So perhaps \( f(n) \) is a quadratic function? Let me test that idea.

Let me assume \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \). Then, maybe I can plug this into the functional equation to solve for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

So, substituting \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) into:
\[
f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1
\]
Left-hand side (LHS):
\[
ax^2 + bx + c + ay^2 + by + c = a(x^2 + y^2) + b(x + y) + 2c
\]
Right-hand side (RHS):
\[
f(x + y) - xy - 1 = a(x + y)^2 + b(x + y) + c - xy - 1
\]
Simplify RHS:
\[
a(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) + b(x + y) + c - xy - 1 = a(x^2 + y^2) + 2a xy + b x + b y + c - xy - 1
\]
So, comparing LHS and RHS:
LHS: \( a(x^2 + y^2) + b(x + y) + 2c \)
RHS: \( a(x^2 + y^2) + (2a - 1)xy + b(x + y) + c - 1 \)

Set coefficients equal for corresponding terms.

First, the coefficients of \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \) are both \( a \) on both sides, so they match.

Next, the cross term \( xy \): On LHS, there is no \( xy \) term, so coefficient is 0. On RHS, coefficient is \( 2a - 1 \). Therefore:
\[
2a - 1 = 0 \implies 2a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Okay, so \( a = \frac{1}{2} \).

Now, the linear terms: Coefficient of \( x \) and \( y \) are both \( b \) on both sides, so that's consistent.

Constant terms: On LHS, it's \( 2c \). On RHS, it's \( c - 1 \). Therefore:
\[
2c = c - 1 \implies 2c - c = -1 \implies c = -1
\]
So, \( c = -1 \).

So, we have \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + bx - 1 \).

Now, we also know that \( f(1) = 1 \). Let's use that to find \( b \).

Substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( f(x) \):
\[
f(1) = \frac{1}{2}(1)^2 + b(1) - 1 = \frac{1}{2} + b - 1 = b - \frac{1}{2}
\]
And this is equal to 1, so:
\[
b - \frac{1}{2} = 1 \implies b = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}
\]
Therefore, \( b = \frac{3}{2} \).

So, the function is:
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1
\]
Let me check if this satisfies the original functional equation. Let me compute both sides for some arbitrary \( x \) and \( y \).

First, compute LHS: \( f(x) + f(y) \)
\[
\left( \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 \right) + \left( \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}y - 1 \right) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}y - 1
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}(x + y) - 2
\]
Now, compute RHS: \( f(x + y) - xy - 1 \)
First, compute \( f(x + y) \):
\[
\frac{1}{2}(x + y)^2 + \frac{3}{2}(x + y) - 1
\]
Expand \( (x + y)^2 \):
\[
\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}(x + y) - 1 = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + xy + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y - 1
\]
Now, subtract \( xy \) and 1:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{2}x^2 + xy + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y - 1 \right) - xy - 1 = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y - 2
\]
So, RHS simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}(x + y) - 2
\]
Which is exactly equal to LHS. So, yes, the function satisfies the equation. Good.

Now, we have the general form of \( f(x) \). So, \( f(n) = n \) when:
\[
\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{3}{2}n - 1 = n
\]
Let me solve this equation for \( n \).

First, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:
\[
n^2 + 3n - 2 = 2n
\]
Subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n^2 + n - 2 = 0
\]
So, quadratic equation \( n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \).

Let me factor this quadratic:
Looking for two numbers that multiply to -2 and add to 1. Hmm, 2 and -1: 2 * (-1) = -2, and 2 + (-1) = 1.

So, factors:
\[
(n + 2)(n - 1) = 0
\]
Set each factor equal to zero:
1. \( n + 2 = 0 \implies n = -2 \)
2. \( n - 1 = 0 \implies n = 1 \)

So, the solutions are \( n = -2 \) and \( n = 1 \).

But wait, the question is asking for all integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \). So, are both of these integers? Yes, -2 and 1 are integers.

Let me just verify these solutions with the function \( f(x) \).

First, \( n = 1 \):
\[
f(1) = \frac{1}{2}(1)^2 + \frac{3}{2}(1) - 1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{2} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]
Which is correct, as given.

Next, \( n = -2 \):
Compute \( f(-2) \):
\[
f(-2) = \frac{1}{2}(-2)^2 + \frac{3}{2}(-2) - 1 = \frac{1}{2}(4) + \frac{3}{2}(-2) - 1 = 2 - 3 - 1 = -2
\]
Which is also correct.

So, both \( n = -2 \) and \( n = 1 \) satisfy \( f(n) = n \).

Therefore, the integers \( n \) are -2 and 1.

**Final Answer**
The integers are \boxed{-2} and \boxed{1}.

Wait, hold on, the instructions said to enter all such integers separated by commas. But in the final answer, I should put them inside a single box. Let me check the format.

Looking back at the problem statement: "Enter all such integers, separated by commas." So, in the box, I should write them separated by commas.

So, the final answer is \boxed{-2}, \boxed{1}. But actually, to follow the instructions precisely, I should write them together in one box.

Wait, but looking at the initial problem statement, the user said "put your final answer within \boxed{}". So, probably, it's a single box with both numbers.

So, probably, \boxed{-2, 1}.

Yes, that's the correct formatting.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-2, 1}
</think>

The function \( f \) satisfies the functional equation:
\[
f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1
\]
for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \). Given \( f(1) = 1 \), we need to find all integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \).

First, we substitute \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \) into the functional equation:
\[
2f(0) = f(0) - 1 \implies f(0) = -1
\]

Next, we set \( y = 1 \) in the functional equation:
\[
f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1 \implies f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2
\]

We compute \( f(2) \) and \( f(3) \) using this recursive relation:
\[
f(2) = f(1) + 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
f(3) = f(2) + 2 + 2 = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8
\]

Assuming \( f(x) \) is a quadratic function, we let \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \). Substituting this into the functional equation, we find:
\[
2c = c - 1 \implies c = -1
\]
\[
2a - 1 = 0 \implies a = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Using \( f(1) = 1 \), we find \( b = \frac{3}{2} \). Thus, the function is:
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1
\]

We solve for \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \):
\[
\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{3}{2}n - 1 = n \implies n^2 + n - 2 = 0
\]
Factoring the quadratic equation:
\[
(n + 2)(n - 1) = 0 \implies n = -2 \text{ or } n = 1
\]

Thus, the integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \) are \boxed{-2} and \boxed{1}. Combining these into a single box, we get:

\[
\boxed{-2, 1}
\]
