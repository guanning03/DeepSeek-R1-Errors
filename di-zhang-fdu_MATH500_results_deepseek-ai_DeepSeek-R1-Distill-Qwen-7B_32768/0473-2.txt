Question:
The complex numbers $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$, and $\alpha_4$ are the four distinct roots of the equation $x^4+2x^3+2=0$. Determine the unordered set \[
\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}.
\]

Correct Answer:
Employing the elementary symmetric polynomials ($s_1 = \alpha_1+\alpha_2+\alpha_3+\alpha_4 = -2$, $s_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0$, $s_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\alpha_1 + \alpha_4\alpha_1\alpha_2 = 0$, and $s_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2$) we consider the polynomial \[
P(x) = (x-(\alpha_1\alpha_2+\alpha_3\alpha_4))(x-(\alpha_1\alpha_3+\alpha_2\alpha_4))(x-(\alpha_1\alpha_4+\alpha_2\alpha_3))
\]Because $P$ is symmetric with respect to $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4$, we can express the coefficients of its expanded form in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials.  We compute \begin{eqnarray*}
P(x) & = & x^3 - s_2x^2 + (s_3s_1-4s_4)x + (-s_3^2-s_4s_1^2+s_4s_2) \\
& = & x^3 - 8x - 8 \\
& = & (x+2)(x^2-2x-4)
\end{eqnarray*}The roots of $P(x)$ are $-2$ and $1 \pm \sqrt{5}$, so the answer is $\boxed{\{1\pm\sqrt{5},-2\}}.$

$\textbf{Remarks:}$ It is easy to find the coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ by expansion, and the constant term can be computed without the complete expansion and decomposition of $(\alpha_1\alpha_2+\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3+\alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4+\alpha_2\alpha_3)$ by noting that the only nonzero 6th degree expressions in $s_1, s_2, s_3,$ and $s_4$ are $s_1^6$ and $s_4s_1^2$. The general polynomial $P$ constructed here is called the cubic resolvent and arises in Galois theory.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the unordered set consisting of three expressions: α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, and α₁α₄ + α₂α₃. These α's are the four distinct roots of the equation x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0. Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that for polynomials, especially quartic ones, Vieta's formulas can be really helpful. Vieta's relates the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. So, maybe I can use that here.

Given the equation x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0, let me write down the general form of a quartic equation to recall Vieta's formulas. A general quartic is x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d = 0. The roots α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄ satisfy:

- α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -a
- α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = b
- α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = -c
- α₁α₂α₃α₄ = d

In our case, the given polynomial is x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0. So, comparing with the general form, we have a = 2, b = 0, c = 0, d = 2. Wait, hold on, is that correct? Let me check: The given equation is x⁴ + 2x³ + 0x² + 0x + 2 = 0, so yes, a=2, b=0, c=0, d=2.

Therefore, applying Vieta's:

1. Sum of roots: α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -a = -2
2. Sum of products two at a time: α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = b = 0
3. Sum of products three at a time: α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = -c = 0
4. Product of all roots: α₁α₂α₃α₄ = d = 2

Okay, so I have these relations. Now, the problem is asking for the set {α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, α₁α₄ + α₂α₃}. These expressions are all sums of two products, each involving two roots, and each expression is a different pairing.

I need to find all three of these expressions and put them in an unordered set. So, I need to figure out what each of these sums is equal to, given the Vieta's formulas I have.

Let me denote S1 = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, S2 = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, and S3 = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃. So, I need to find S1, S2, and S3.

I know that the sum of all these three expressions is (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄) - (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄) wait, no. Wait, actually, S1 + S2 + S3 is equal to (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄) + (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄) + (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃). Let me compute that:

S1 + S2 + S3 = (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄) + (α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄). Wait, no, hold on. Let me write it out:

S1 + S2 + S3 = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄) + (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄) + (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃)
= α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄
= (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄)
= sum of all products two at a time.

But from Vieta, we know that sum is equal to b, which is 0. So, S1 + S2 + S3 = 0.

Okay, that's one equation. Now, maybe I can find another equation involving S1, S2, S3. If I can find S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, or S1S2S3, then perhaps I can solve for each S.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the roots as being in pairs and think about the quadratic factors of the quartic. If I can factor the quartic into quadratics, maybe I can find expressions for these sums.

Let me try that. Suppose I factor x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 into two quadratics: (x² + a x + b)(x² + c x + d). Let's see if this works.

Expanding the product:

(x² + a x + b)(x² + c x + d) = x⁴ + (a + c)x³ + (ac + b + d)x² + (ad + bc)x + b d.

Set this equal to x⁴ + 2x³ + 0x² + 0x + 2. Therefore, by equating coefficients:

1. Coefficient of x³: a + c = 2
2. Coefficient of x²: ac + b + d = 0
3. Coefficient of x: ad + bc = 0
4. Constant term: b d = 2

So, now, we have a system of equations:

1. a + c = 2
2. ac + b + d = 0
3. ad + bc = 0
4. b d = 2

We have four equations with four variables: a, b, c, d.

Let me try to solve this system. From equation 1, c = 2 - a. Let's substitute c into the other equations.

Equation 2: a(2 - a) + b + d = 0 ⇒ 2a - a² + b + d = 0.

Equation 3: a d + b (2 - a) = 0 ⇒ a d + 2b - a b = 0.

Equation 4: b d = 2.

Hmm, okay. Let me see if I can express d from equation 3 and substitute into equation 2.

From equation 3: a d = -2b + a b ⇒ d = (-2b + a b)/a, provided a ≠ 0. Let's assume a ≠ 0 for now.

So, d = b(-2 + a)/a.

Let me plug this into equation 4: b d = 2 ⇒ b * [b(-2 + a)/a] = 2 ⇒ b²(-2 + a)/a = 2.

From equation 2: 2a - a² + b + d = 0. Let's substitute d from above:

2a - a² + b + [b(-2 + a)/a] = 0.

Let me write that as:

b + [b(-2 + a)/a] = -2a + a².

Factor b:

b [1 + (-2 + a)/a] = -2a + a².

Compute the term in brackets:

1 + (-2 + a)/a = 1 - 2/a + 1 = (a - 2)/a + 1? Wait, no, let's compute correctly.

Wait, 1 + (-2 + a)/a = 1 + (-2)/a + a/a = 1 - 2/a + 1 = 2 - 2/a.

Wait, that seems incorrect. Let me compute step by step:

1 + (-2 + a)/a = 1 + [(-2)/a + a/a] = 1 + (-2/a) + 1 = 2 - 2/a.

Yes, that seems correct. So, b [2 - 2/a] = -2a + a².

Therefore,

b [2(1 - 1/a)] = a² - 2a

Let me write this as:

b [2( (a - 1)/a ) ] = a(a - 2)

So,

b = [a(a - 2)] / [2( (a - 1)/a )] = [a(a - 2) * a] / [2(a - 1)] = [a²(a - 2)] / [2(a - 1)].

So, that's an expression for b in terms of a.

Now, from equation 4: b d = 2.

We have d = b(-2 + a)/a, so:

b * [b(-2 + a)/a] = 2 ⇒ b²(a - 2)/a = 2.

But from above, b = [a²(a - 2)] / [2(a - 1)], so let's compute b squared:

b² = [a⁴(a - 2)²] / [4(a - 1)²].

Substitute into b²(a - 2)/a = 2:

[ a⁴(a - 2)² / 4(a - 1)² ] * (a - 2)/a = 2.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: a⁴(a - 2)²(a - 2) = a⁴(a - 2)³

Denominator: 4(a - 1)² * a

So, entire expression:

[ a⁴(a - 2)³ ] / [4(a - 1)² a ] = [ a³(a - 2)³ ] / [4(a - 1)² ] = 2.

So,

[ a³(a - 2)³ ] / [4(a - 1)² ] = 2

Multiply both sides by 4(a - 1)²:

a³(a - 2)³ = 8(a - 1)²

Hmm, this looks complicated, but maybe we can find a value of a that satisfies this equation. Let me see if a = 1 is a solution, but plugging a=1, we get 1³(-1)³ = -1, which is not equal to 8(0)=0. So, no.

What about a=2? Plugging a=2: 8(0)³ = 0, right side is 8(1)²=8. So, 0=8? No.

How about a= -1? Left: (-1)^3(-3)^3 = (-1)(-27)=27. Right: 8(-2)^2=8(4)=32. 27≠32.

a=0: Left: 0*(-2)^3=0. Right:8*(-1)^2=8. 0≠8.

a=3: 27*(1)^3=27. Right:8*(2)^2=32. Not equal.

a= sqrt(2) or anything? Seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartic factors into quadratics with integer coefficients? Maybe not, since the quartic is x⁴ + 2x³ + 2. Let's check for possible rational roots first. By Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are ±1, ±2. Let me test x=1: 1 + 2 + 2=5≠0. x=-1: 1 -2 + 2=1≠0. x=2: 16 + 16 + 2=34≠0. x=-2: 16 -16 + 2=2≠0. So, no rational roots. So, the quartic is irreducible over rationals, so perhaps it doesn't factor into quadratics with integer coefficients.

Hmm, so maybe that approach is not the way to go. Maybe I need another strategy.

Wait, another thought: The expressions S1, S2, S3 are the sums of products of roots two at a time, grouped in a certain way. Maybe I can think about the roots in pairs and consider the quadratic factors.

But since the quartic is irreducible over rationals, as we saw, it can't be factored into quadratics with rational coefficients. However, over complex numbers, it can be factored into linear terms. But that might not help me directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the idea of symmetric polynomials. Since S1, S2, S3 are symmetric in the roots, we can express them in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials, which are given by Vieta's.

Wait, but S1, S2, S3 are themselves symmetric polynomials, but they are not the elementary symmetric polynomials. The elementary ones are the sum, sum of products two at a time, etc.

So, maybe we can express S1, S2, S3 in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. Let me see.

Let me denote σ1 = α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2.

σ2 = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0.

σ3 = α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0.

σ4 = α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2.

So, σ1 = -2, σ2 = 0, σ3 = 0, σ4 = 2.

Now, S1 = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄.

Similarly, S2 = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄.

S3 = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃.

So, each S_i is a sum of two products, each of two roots, but grouped differently.

I wonder if these S_i can be related to the elementary symmetric polynomials. Let me see.

Let me consider that σ2 = sum_{i < j} α_i α_j = 0.

So, σ2 = S1 + S2 + S3. But earlier, we saw that S1 + S2 + S3 = 0, which matches.

But now, we need more relations to find S1, S2, S3.

Perhaps if I can compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, and S1S2S3, then I can set up a cubic equation whose roots are S1, S2, S3.

Yes, that might work.

Let me try that. So, if I can find the values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 and S1S2S3, then the monic cubic polynomial with roots S1, S2, S3 is x³ - (S1 + S2 + S3)x² + (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)x - S1S2S3 = 0. But since S1 + S2 + S3 = 0, the equation simplifies to x³ + (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)x - S1S2S3 = 0.

Therefore, if I can compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 and S1S2S3, I can find the set {S1, S2, S3} as the roots of this cubic.

So, let's compute these.

First, let me compute S1S2:

S1S2 = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)
= α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄²

Similarly, S1S3 = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃)
= α₁²α₂α₄ + α₁α₂²α₃ + α₁α₃α₄² + α₂α₃²α₄

And S2S3 = (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃)
= α₁²α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₃² + α₁α₂α₄² + α₂²α₃α₄

So, now, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is the sum of all these terms.

Let me add them up:

S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄²] + [α₁²α₂α₄ + α₁α₂²α₃ + α₁α₃α₄² + α₂α₃²α₄] + [α₁²α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₃² + α₁α₂α₄² + α₂²α₃α₄]

Let me collect like terms:

First, terms with α₁²:

- α₁²α₂α₃ (from S1S2)
- α₁²α₂α₄ (from S1S3)
- α₁²α₃α₄ (from S2S3)

So, α₁²(α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄)

Similarly, terms with α₂²:

- α₁α₂²α₄ (from S1S2)
- α₁α₂²α₃ (from S1S3)
- α₂²α₃α₄ (from S2S3)

So, α₂²(α₁α₄ + α₁α₃ + α₃α₄)

Similarly, terms with α₃²:

- α₁α₃²α₄ (from S1S2)
- α₁α₂α₃² (from S2S3)
- α₁α₂α₃² (from S1S3)

Wait, let me check:

Wait, from S1S2: α₁α₃²α₄

From S2S3: α₁α₂α₃²

From S1S3: α₁α₂²α₃? Wait, no.

Wait, let me re-examine:

In S1S2, the terms are:

1. α₁²α₂α₃
2. α₁α₂²α₄
3. α₁α₃²α₄
4. α₂α₃α₄²

In S1S3:

1. α₁²α₂α₄
2. α₁α₂²α₃
3. α₁α₃α₄²
4. α₂α₃²α₄

In S2S3:

1. α₁²α₃α₄
2. α₁α₂α₃²
3. α₁α₂α₄²
4. α₂²α₃α₄

So, for α₁²:

S1S2: α₁²α₂α₃

S1S3: α₁²α₂α₄

S2S3: α₁²α₃α₄

So, sum: α₁²(α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄) = α₁² σ₂', where σ₂' is the sum of products two at a time, but excluding α₁.

Wait, actually, σ₂ is the sum over all pairs, so σ₂ = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄.

So, the sum α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ is equal to σ₂ - α₁(α₂ + α₃ + α₄). But σ₁ = α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2. So, α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2 - α₁.

Therefore, α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = σ₂ - α₁(σ₁ - α₁) = 0 - α₁(-2 - α₁) = 2α₁ + α₁².

So, α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 2α₁ + α₁².

Therefore, the sum of the terms with α₁² is α₁²(2α₁ + α₁²) = 2α₁³ + α₁⁴.

Similarly, the terms with α₂²:

From S1S2: α₁α₂²α₄

From S1S3: α₁α₂²α₃

From S2S3: α₂²α₃α₄

So, sum: α₂²(α₁α₄ + α₁α₃ + α₃α₄).

Similarly, α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₃α₄ = σ₂ - α₂(α₁ + α₃ + α₄) = 0 - α₂(σ₁ - α₂) = 2α₂ + α₂².

Wait, hold on:

Wait, σ₂ = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄.

So, if I factor α₁ out of the first three terms, I get α₁(α₂ + α₃ + α₄) + (α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄).

Then, α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = σ₁ - α₁ = -2 - α₁.

So, α₁(σ₁ - α₁) + (α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄) = α₁(-2 - α₁) + (α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄) = -2α₁ - α₁² + (α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄).

But from above, we have α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 2α₁ + α₁², so plugging that in:

-2α₁ - α₁² + 2α₁ + α₁² = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So, α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₃α₄ = 2α₁ + α₁², which when plugged back into the expression for α₁²(2α₁ + α₁²), gives 2α₁³ + α₁⁴.

Similarly, for α₂², the expression α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₃α₄ = 2α₁ + α₁², but in the context of α₂², I think I need to compute α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₃α₄ in terms of α₂.

Wait, maybe another approach. Since σ₂ = 0, so α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = - (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄) = -α₁(α₂ + α₃ + α₄) = -α₁( -2 - α₁) = 2α₁ + α₁².

So, regardless of which variable I pick, the sum α_{i}α_{j} + α_{i}α_{k} + α_{j}α_{k} = 2α_{i} + α_{i}².

Therefore, the terms with α₂²: α₂²(2α₁ + α₁²)

Similarly, terms with α₃²:

From S1S2: α₁α₃²α₄

From S1S3: α₂α₃²α₄

From S2S3: α₁α₂α₃²

So, sum: α₃²(α₁α₄ + α₂α₄ + α₁α₂) = α₃²(σ₂ - α₃(α₁ + α₂ + α₄)).

But, σ₂ = 0, and α₁ + α₂ + α₄ = σ₁ - α₃ = -2 - α₃.

So, σ₂ - α₃(σ₁ - α₃) = 0 - α₃(-2 - α₃) = 2α₃ + α₃².

Therefore, the sum for α₃² is α₃²(2α₃ + α₃²) = 2α₃³ + α₃⁴.

Similarly, for α₄², the sum would be 2α₄³ + α₄⁴.

So, now, putting it all together:

S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [2α₁³ + α₁⁴] + [2α₂³ + α₂⁴] + [2α₃³ + α₃⁴] + [2α₄³ + α₄⁴]

So, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = 2(α₁³ + α₂³ + α₃³ + α₄³) + (α₁⁴ + α₂⁴ + α₃⁴ + α₄⁴)

Hmm, okay. So, I need to compute the sum of cubes and the sum of fourth powers of the roots.

Let me denote:

C = α₁³ + α₂³ + α₃³ + α₄³

D = α₁⁴ + α₂⁴ + α₃⁴ + α₄⁴

So, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = 2C + D.

So, if I can compute C and D, then I can find S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me see if I can find C and D using the known sums from Vieta.

I recall that for any root α, we have α⁴ + 2α³ + 2 = 0, since α is a root of the equation x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0.

Therefore, α⁴ = -2α³ - 2.

Therefore, α⁴ can be expressed in terms of lower powers of α.

So, perhaps I can express D in terms of C.

Let me see:

Since α⁴ = -2α³ - 2, then for each root, α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2.

Therefore, summing over all roots:

D = α₁⁴ + α₂⁴ + α₃⁴ + α₄⁴ = -2(α₁³ + α₂³ + α₃³ + α₄³) - 8.

Wait, because each α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2, so summing over four roots, that's -2C - 8.

Therefore, D = -2C - 8.

Therefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = 2C + D = 2C + (-2C -8) = -8.

So, that's a nice result: S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = -8.

Now, let's compute S1S2S3.

This is going to be a bit more involved. Let's see.

S1 = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄

S2 = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄

S3 = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃

So, S1S2S3 = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃)

Hmm, that's a product of three binomials, each of which is a sum of two products.

This seems complicated, but maybe there's a way to express this in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that S1, S2, S3 are the roots of the cubic equation x³ + (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)x - S1S2S3 = 0, as we had before. But since we already know S1 + S2 + S3 = 0, and S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = -8, we need only find S1S2S3.

So, let me focus on S1S2S3.

First, note that each S_i is a sum of two products, so when we multiply them together, the expression S1S2S3 will involve a lot of terms. Each term will be a product of three terms, each from one S_i.

Let me attempt to compute it step by step.

Let me denote:

S1 = A + B, where A = α₁α₂, B = α₃α₄

S2 = C + D, where C = α₁α₃, D = α₂α₄

S3 = E + F, where E = α₁α₄, F = α₂α₃

So, S1S2S3 = (A + B)(C + D)(E + F)

Let me expand this:

First, expand (A + B)(C + D):

= AC + AD + BC + BD

Now, multiply each term by (E + F):

= (AC)(E + F) + (AD)(E + F) + (BC)(E + F) + (BD)(E + F)

= ACE + ACF + ADE + ADF + BCE + BCF + BDE + BDF

So, S1S2S3 is equal to the sum of these eight terms:

ACE, ACF, ADE, ADF, BCE, BCF, BDE, BDF.

Each term is a product of three roots, each from different pairs.

Let me write them out:

1. ACE = α₁α₂ * α₁α₃ * α₁α₄ = α₁³ α₂ α₃ α₄
2. ACF = α₁α₂ * α₁α₃ * α₂α₃ = α₁² α₂² α₃²
3. ADE = α₁α₂ * α₁α₄ * α₁α₄ = α₁³ α₂ α₄²
4. ADF = α₁α₂ * α₁α₄ * α₂α₄ = α₁² α₂² α₄²
5. BCE = α₁α₃ * α₂α₃ * α₁α₄ = α₁² α₂ α₃² α₄
6. BCF = α₁α₃ * α₂α₃ * α₂α₃ = α₁ α₂³ α₃³
7. BDE = α₁α₃ * α₂α₄ * α₁α₄ = α₁² α₂ α₃ α₄²
8. BDF = α₁α₃ * α₂α₄ * α₂α₃ = α₁ α₂² α₃² α₄

Wow, that's a lot. Let me see if I can group these terms or find a way to express them in terms of the known symmetric sums.

First, note that some terms involve higher powers of a single root, others involve squares or products.

Let me see:

Term 1: α₁³ α₂ α₃ α₄

Term 3: α₁³ α₂ α₄²

Term 7: α₁² α₂ α₃ α₄²

Term 5: α₁² α₂ α₃² α₄

Term 8: α₁ α₂² α₃² α₄

Term 2: α₁² α₂² α₃²

Term 4: α₁² α₂² α₄²

Term 6: α₁ α₂³ α₃³

Okay, so let's see if we can factor these terms or express them in terms of known sums.

First, let's note that α₁α₂α₃α₄ = d = 2, from Vieta.

So, in term 1, α₁³ α₂ α₃ α₄ = α₁³ * (α₂α₃α₄) = α₁³ * (σ₃ / α₁). Wait, no, σ₃ = α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0. So, α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0.

Therefore, α₂α₃α₄ = - (α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, since σ₃ = 0, we can express α₂α₃α₄ = -σ₃ - (α₁α₂α₃ + other terms). Wait, that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express term 1 as α₁³ * α₂α₃α₄.

But α₂α₃α₄ = (α₂α₃α₄) = ?

Wait, from σ₃ = 0, which is α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0.

So, α₂α₃α₄ = - (α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄)

Hmm, but that seems to complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find expressions for α_i³ and α_i⁴ in terms of lower powers, since we know that each α_i satisfies α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2.

So, maybe we can express α_i³ in terms of α_i⁴:

α_i³ = (-α_i⁴ - 2)/2

Wait, from α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2, rearranged, 2α_i³ = -α_i⁴ - 2 ⇒ α_i³ = (-α_i⁴ - 2)/2.

Therefore, α_i³ = (-α_i⁴ - 2)/2.

So, let me try to express terms 1, 3, 7, 5, etc., using this.

Term 1: α₁³ α₂ α₃ α₄ = [(-α₁⁴ - 2)/2] * α₂ α₃ α₄

But α₁⁴ = -2α₁³ - 2, from the equation. Hmm, but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps we can express α_i⁴ in terms of lower powers.

Wait, from α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2, so α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2.

Therefore, α_i³ = (-α_i⁴ - 2)/2.

So, α_i³ is expressed in terms of α_i⁴.

Similarly, α_i² can be expressed from Vieta's.

Wait, but perhaps it's too convoluted. Alternatively, maybe compute each term individually using known relations.

Let me try that.

First, term 1: α₁³ α₂ α₃ α₄.

We know that α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2, so α₂α₃α₄ = 2 / α₁.

Therefore, term 1 = α₁³ * (2 / α₁) = 2 α₁².

Similarly, term 3: α₁³ α₂ α₄².

Hmm, α₂α₄². Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps express α₄² in terms of lower powers.

Wait, since α₄⁴ = -2α₄³ - 2, so α₄² = sqrt(α₄⁴) = sqrt(-2α₄³ - 2). Hmm, but that introduces square roots, which complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe use symmetric polynomials.

Wait, let's recall that σ₁ = -2, σ₂ = 0, σ₃ = 0, σ₄ = 2.

I can also recall that for any polynomial, the sum of α_i^k can be expressed via Newton's identities.

Newton's identities relate power sums to elementary symmetric polynomials.

Let me denote p_k = α₁^k + α₂^k + α₃^k + α₄^k.

Then, Newton's identities say:

p₁ = σ₁

p₂ = σ₁ p₁ - 2σ₂

p₃ = σ₁ p₂ - σ₂ p₁ + 3σ₃

p₄ = σ₁ p₃ - σ₂ p₂ + σ₃ p₁ - 4σ₄

Given that σ₁ = -2, σ₂ = 0, σ₃ = 0, σ₄ = 2.

Let me compute p₁, p₂, p₃, p₄.

p₁ = σ₁ = -2.

p₂ = σ₁ p₁ - 2σ₂ = (-2)(-2) - 2(0) = 4 - 0 = 4.

p₃ = σ₁ p₂ - σ₂ p₁ + 3σ₃ = (-2)(4) - 0*(-2) + 3*0 = -8 - 0 + 0 = -8.

p₄ = σ₁ p₃ - σ₂ p₂ + σ₃ p₁ - 4σ₄ = (-2)(-8) - 0*4 + 0*(-2) - 4*2 = 16 - 0 + 0 - 8 = 8.

So, p₁ = -2, p₂ = 4, p₃ = -8, p₄ = 8.

Alright, so now, we know the power sums up to 4.

Let me recall that:

Term 1: α₁³ α₂ α₃ α₄ = 2 α₁² (from earlier)

Similarly, term 3: α₁³ α₂ α₄².

Wait, can I express term 3 as α₁³ α₂ α₄² = α₁² α₂ α₄² * α₁.

But I don't know if that helps.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think about the terms.

Looking at term 1: α₁³ α₂ α₃ α₄ = 2 α₁².

Similarly, term 3: α₁³ α₂ α₄².

Hmm, let me see:

Term 3: α₁³ α₂ α₄².

I can write this as α₁² * α₂ * α₄² * α₁.

But not sure.

Wait, perhaps express α₄² in terms of lower powers.

From α₄⁴ = -2α₄³ - 2, so as before, but that gives α₄² in terms of α₄³ and a constant. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe consider that α₄² can be expressed via the original equation.

Wait, since each α_i satisfies α_i⁴ + 2α_i³ + 2 = 0, so α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2.

Thus, α_i² = ?

Hmm, if I square both sides, (α_i²)² = ( -2α_i³ - 2 )² = 4α_i⁶ + 8α_i³ + 4.

But that's getting even higher powers.

Alternatively, maybe we can find α_i² in terms of α_i³.

Wait, from the equation, we have α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2, so α_i² = sqrt(α_i⁴) = sqrt(-2α_i³ -2). But square roots complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps multiply two equations.

Wait, maybe multiply α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2 by α_i²:

α_i⁶ = -2α_i⁵ - 2α_i².

But that's introducing higher powers, which may not help.

Alternatively, perhaps consider another approach.

Wait, term 1: 2α₁².

Similarly, term 3: α₁³ α₂ α₄². Hmm, if I can express α₄² in terms of lower powers, but as above, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps use the known power sums.

Wait, from p₂ = α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄² = 4.

So, α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄² = 4.

But how does that help? Hmm.

Alternatively, term 3: α₁³ α₂ α₄².

Wait, this term is a product of three variables, each raised to different powers.

I might need to find a way to express this in terms of the known symmetric sums.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of term 1, 3, 7, 5 as all involving α_i³ times other terms.

Wait, term 1: 2α₁².

Similarly, term 3: α₁³ α₂ α₄².

Wait, maybe I can factor these terms differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's too time-consuming and complicated. Maybe we can compute S1S2S3 using another approach.

Wait, another thought: note that S1, S2, S3 are symmetric in the roots. So, perhaps the value of S1S2S3 is equal to some symmetric function of the roots, which can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials.

But S1S2S3 is a product of three symmetric sums, each of degree 2, so overall degree 6.

Wait, perhaps express S1S2S3 in terms of σ1, σ2, σ3, σ4.

But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that S1S2S3 can be expressed in terms of the products of the roots in certain groupings.

Alternatively, perhaps since S1 = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, etc., then S1S2S3 = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃).

Let me think of this as follows: Each of these terms is a sum of two products, each product being two roots. So, when multiplied together, the product will be a sum of terms each involving six roots, but grouped as products.

Wait, but each term in the expansion will be a product of three pairs, each pair being two roots.

But in the expansion, each term will be a product of six roots, but arranged in a way that corresponds to each pair.

But in reality, each term is a product of three pairs, each pair being two roots, but since each root is used exactly once in each pair, it's more like a matching.

Wait, hold on, but in the expansion, each term is a product of three pairings, each pairing being two roots.

Wait, no, actually, it's three factors, each being a sum of two pairings.

Wait, I think it's getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that S1, S2, S3 are the roots of the cubic equation x³ + px + q = 0, since their sum is zero. So, if we can find p and q, then the equation is x³ + px + q = 0, and the roots are S1, S2, S3. But I don't know p and q yet.

Wait, but we can relate p and q to S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 and S1S2S3.

Wait, in general, for a cubic with roots r, s, t: x³ - (r + s + t)x² + (rs + rt + st)x - rst = 0.

But since in our case, r + s + t = 0, so the equation is x³ + (rs + rt + st)x - rst = 0.

So, in our case, the cubic is x³ + (rs + rt + st)x - rst = 0.

We already know that rs + rt + st = -8, so the cubic is x³ - 8x - rst = 0.

Therefore, if I can find rst, then the cubic is x³ -8x - rst = 0, and the roots are S1, S2, S3.

So, if I can compute rst = S1S2S3, then I can find the cubic.

But how?

Wait, perhaps using the relation between symmetric sums.

Alternatively, perhaps another idea: consider that the product S1S2S3 can be expressed in terms of the products of the roots, which we know.

Wait, let's see:

S1 = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄

S2 = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄

S3 = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃

So, S1S2S3 = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃)

Let me denote:

Let me define A = α₁α₂, B = α₃α₄

Then, S1 = A + B

Similarly, define C = α₁α₃, D = α₂α₄

S2 = C + D

And E = α₁α₄, F = α₂α₃

S3 = E + F

So, S1S2S3 = (A + B)(C + D)(E + F)

Expanding this, as before, gives:

ACE + ACF + ADE + ADF + BCE + BCF + BDE + BDF

Which we had earlier.

So, S1S2S3 = ACE + ACF + ADE + ADF + BCE + BCF + BDE + BDF.

Each term is a product of three roots, each from different pairs.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps consider that each term is a product of three roots, each from different pairs.

So, for example, term ACE = α₁α₂ * α₁α₃ * α₁α₄.

So, that's α₁³ α₂ α₃ α₄.

Similarly, term ACF = α₁α₂ * α₁α₃ * α₂α₃ = α₁² α₂² α₃².

Similarly, term ADE = α₁α₂ * α₁α₄ * α₁α₄ = α₁³ α₂ α₄².

Wait, maybe there's a pattern here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express each term in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials.

Wait, let's think about term ACE:

ACE = α₁³ α₂ α₃ α₄ = α₁³ * (α₂ α₃ α₄) = α₁³ * (σ₃ - α₁α₂α₃ - α₁α₂α₄ - α₁α₃α₄).

But σ₃ = 0, so ACE = -α₁³ (α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄).

But from earlier, we know that α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ = 2α₁ + α₁².

Therefore, ACE = -α₁³ (2α₁ + α₁²) = -2α₁⁴ - α₁⁵.

But from the equation, α₁⁴ = -2α₁³ - 2.

So, substituting:

ACE = -2*(-2α₁³ -2) - α₁⁵ = 4α₁³ + 4 - α₁⁵.

But α₁⁵ = α₁ * α₁⁴ = α₁*(-2α₁³ - 2) = -2α₁⁴ - 2α₁.

But α₁⁴ = -2α₁³ - 2, so α₁⁵ = -2*(-2α₁³ - 2) - 2α₁ = 4α₁³ + 4 - 2α₁.

So, substituting back into ACE:

ACE = 4α₁³ + 4 - (4α₁³ + 4 - 2α₁) = 4α₁³ + 4 -4α₁³ -4 + 2α₁ = 2α₁.

Similarly, term ACE simplifies to 2α₁.

Similarly, let's compute term ADE: α₁³ α₂ α₄².

Hmm, similar to above, but not sure.

Wait, term ADE = α₁³ α₂ α₄². Let me try to express it.

From α₄⁴ = -2α₄³ - 2, so α₄² = (α₄⁴)^(1/2) = sqrt(-2α₄³ - 2). But that seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps express α₄² in terms of α₄³.

Wait, from α₄⁴ = -2α₄³ - 2, so α₄² = sqrt(-2α₄³ - 2). But that introduces a square root, which complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe use the original equation.

Wait, from α₄⁴ = -2α₄³ - 2, so α₄² = (-α₄⁴ - 2)/2.

Wait, no, because α₄² is positive, but (-α₄⁴ - 2) would be negative.

Wait, actually, α₄² = sqrt(α₄⁴) = sqrt(-2α₄³ - 2). But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps express term ADE in terms of lower powers.

Wait, term ADE = α₁³ α₂ α₄².

From the equation, α₁⁴ = -2α₁³ - 2, so α₁³ = (-α₁⁴ - 2)/2.

Therefore, term ADE = [(-α₁⁴ - 2)/2] * α₂ * α₄².

But α₂α₄² is another term. Hmm, same issue.

Wait, maybe think differently.

Wait, from the equation, α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2.

Similarly, α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0.

And α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0.

And α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2.

So, maybe we can express the product ACE = α₁³ α₂ α₃ α₄ in terms of these.

Wait, ACE = α₁³ * (α₂ α₃ α₄) = α₁³ * (σ₃ - α₁α₂α₃ - α₁α₂α₄ - α₁α₃α₄) ).

But from earlier, σ₃ - α₁α₂α₃ - α₁α₂α₄ - α₁α₃α₄ = 2α₁ + α₁².

So, ACE = α₁³ * (2α₁ + α₁²) = 2α₁⁴ + α₁⁵.

But from the equation, α₁⁴ = -2α₁³ - 2, so:

ACE = 2*(-2α₁³ - 2) + α₁⁵ = -4α₁³ -4 + α₁⁵.

Similarly, from α₁⁵ = α₁ * α₁⁴ = α₁*(-2α₁³ - 2) = -2α₁⁴ - 2α₁ = -2*(-2α₁³ - 2) - 2α₁ = 4α₁³ +4 - 2α₁.

Therefore, substituting back:

ACE = -4α₁³ -4 + (4α₁³ +4 -2α₁) = (-4α₁³ +4α₁³) + (-4 +4) + (-2α₁) = 0 + 0 -2α₁ = -2α₁.

Wait, so ACE = -2α₁.

But earlier, when I tried to compute ACE, I got 2α₁. But now, with this method, I get -2α₁. Hmm, so which is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion earlier.

Wait, let me re-examine.

Earlier, I had term ACE as:

ACE = α₁³ * (α₂α₃α₄) = α₁³ * (2α₁ + α₁²) = 2α₁⁴ + α₁⁵.

But then, substituting α₁⁴ = -2α₁³ - 2:

2*(-2α₁³ -2) + α₁⁵ = -4α₁³ -4 + α₁⁵.

Then, α₁⁵ = α₁ * α₁⁴ = α₁*(-2α₁³ -2) = -2α₁⁴ -2α₁ = -2*(-2α₁³ -2) -2α₁ = 4α₁³ +4 -2α₁.

Therefore, substituting back:

-4α₁³ -4 + (4α₁³ +4 -2α₁) = (-4α₁³ +4α₁³) + (-4 +4) + (-2α₁) = 0 +0 -2α₁ = -2α₁.

So, ACE = -2α₁.

But in the earlier step-by-step expansion, I had:

ACE = -2α₁⁴ - α₁⁵.

But substituting α₁⁴ and α₁⁵ gives:

-2*(-2α₁³ -2) - (4α₁³ +4 -2α₁) = 4α₁³ +4 -4α₁³ -4 +2α₁ = 2α₁.

Wait, so which is correct? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps my initial substitution was wrong.

Wait, when I substituted ACE = -2α₁⁴ - α₁⁵, and then substituted α₁⁴ and α₁⁵, I should have:

-2*(-2α₁³ -2) - (4α₁³ +4 -2α₁) = 4α₁³ +4 -4α₁³ -4 + 2α₁ = 2α₁.

But in the second approach, I directly substituted α₁⁵ into the expression -4α₁³ -4 + α₁⁵, and got -2α₁.

Wait, but both are supposed to be equal. So, 2α₁ = -2α₁.

Which implies 4α₁ = 0 ⇒ α₁ = 0. But α₁ is a root of x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0, which doesn't have zero as a root. So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, at least one of my substitutions is wrong.

Wait, hold on, let's recast:

Earlier, I said that term ACE = α₁³ * (α₂α₃α₄) = α₁³*(2α₁ + α₁²).

But is that correct?

From earlier, we had σ₃ = α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0.

So, α₂α₃α₄ = - (α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄) = - [2α₁ + α₁²].

So, yes, α₂α₃α₄ = -2α₁ - α₁².

Therefore, term ACE = α₁³*(-2α₁ - α₁²) = -2α₁⁴ - α₁⁵.

But then, substituting α₁⁴ = -2α₁³ -2:

-2*(-2α₁³ -2) - α₁⁵ = 4α₁³ +4 - α₁⁵.

Then, α₁⁵ = α₁ * α₁⁴ = α₁*(-2α₁³ -2) = -2α₁⁴ - 2α₁.

Substituting α₁⁴ = -2α₁³ -2:

α₁⁵ = -2*(-2α₁³ -2) -2α₁ = 4α₁³ +4 -2α₁.

Therefore, term ACE = 4α₁³ +4 - (4α₁³ +4 -2α₁) = 4α₁³ +4 -4α₁³ -4 +2α₁ = 2α₁.

So, term ACE = 2α₁.

But in the other approach, I had:

ACE = α₁³ * (α₂α₃α₄) = α₁³*(-2α₁ -α₁²) = -2α₁⁴ -α₁⁵.

Which is equal to -2α₁⁴ -α₁⁵.

Substituting α₁⁴ = -2α₁³ -2:

-2*(-2α₁³ -2) - α₁⁵ = 4α₁³ +4 - α₁⁵.

But then, α₁⁵ = 4α₁³ +4 -2α₁.

So, 4α₁³ +4 - (4α₁³ +4 -2α₁) = 2α₁.

So, term ACE = 2α₁.

Wait, so term ACE is 2α₁.

Then, term ACF = α₁² α₂² α₃².

Hmm, that's more complicated.

Similarly, term ADE = α₁³ α₂ α₄².

But perhaps this approach is too tedious. Maybe a different approach.

Wait, since it's symmetric, maybe the sum of all terms can be expressed in terms of the known symmetric sums.

Wait, we have:

S1S2S3 = ACE + ACF + ADE + ADF + BCE + BCF + BDE + BDF.

Let me group them:

= (ACE + BDF) + (ACF + BDE) + (ADE + BCF) + (ADF + BCE)

But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps note that term ACE = 2α₁, as computed above.

Similarly, term ACF = α₁² α₂² α₃².

But from p₂ = α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄² = 4.

So, α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄² = 4.

But ACF is the product α₁² α₂² α₃².

I don't think that's directly expressible in terms of p₂.

Wait, unless we can relate it to symmetric polynomials.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that:

(α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) = ?

Wait, perhaps it's equal to (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) = ?

Wait, I think I recall a formula for the product of sums of products. Let me see.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps think of S1, S2, S3 as the roots of a cubic equation.

Given that they are symmetric and sum to zero, and their pairwise products sum to -8, as we found earlier.

So, the cubic equation is x³ - 8x - rst = 0, where rst = S1S2S3.

But we need another relation to find rst.

Wait, perhaps using Newton's identities for symmetric sums.

Wait, Newton's identities relate power sums to elementary symmetric polynomials.

But since S1, S2, S3 are themselves symmetric sums, perhaps it's a complicated approach.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps compute S1S2S3 numerically.

Wait, since the polynomial is x⁴ + 2x³ + 2, and the roots are α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄.

If I can find numerical values for α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄, then compute S1, S2, S3, and then find their set.

But since this is a quartic, perhaps it's solvable.

Wait, maybe substitute x = y - 1 to eliminate the cubic term.

Let me try to make the substitution x = y - h to remove the y³ term.

Wait, general substitution for quartic: x = y - b/(4a). For x⁴ + 2x³ + 2, a=1, b=2, so x = y - 2/(4*1) = y - 0.5.

Let me perform substitution: x = y - 0.5.

Then, compute the quartic in terms of y.

But maybe it's too involved. Alternatively, perhaps use the rational root theorem, but as before, no rational roots. So, perhaps the quartic factors into quadratics.

Assume x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = (x² + a x + b)(x² + c x + d).

Expanding:

x⁴ + (a + c)x³ + (ac + b + d)x² + (ad + bc)x + bd = x⁴ + 2x³ + 0x² + 0x + 2.

Therefore, equate coefficients:

1. a + c = 2

2. ac + b + d = 0

3. ad + bc = 0

4. bd = 2

So, system of equations:

1. a + c = 2

2. ac + b + d = 0

3. ad + bc = 0

4. bd = 2

We need to find integers a, c, b, d? Probably not, since the quartic is irreducible. But let's try.

From equation 4: bd = 2. So, possible integer pairs (b,d) are (1,2), (2,1), (-1,-2), (-2,-1).

Let me try (b,d) = (1,2):

Then, equation 3: a*2 + c*1 = 0 ⇒ 2a + c = 0.

But from equation 1: a + c = 2.

So, we have:

2a + c = 0

a + c = 2

Subtract the second equation from the first:

(2a + c) - (a + c) = 0 - 2 ⇒ a = -2.

Then, from equation 1: -2 + c = 2 ⇒ c = 4.

Now, check equation 2: ac + b + d = (-2)*4 + 1 + 2 = -8 + 3 = -5 ≠ 0.

So, doesn't work.

Next, try (b,d) = (2,1):

Equation 3: a*1 + c*2 = 0 ⇒ a + 2c = 0.

From equation 1: a + c = 2.

So, two equations:

a + 2c = 0

a + c = 2

Subtract the second from the first:

c = -2

Then, from equation 1: a + (-2) = 2 ⇒ a = 4.

Check equation 2: ac + b + d = 4*(-2) + 2 + 1 = -8 + 3 = -5 ≠ 0.

Nope.

Next, try (b,d) = (-1,-2):

Equation 3: a*(-2) + c*(-1) = 0 ⇒ -2a - c = 0.

From equation 1: a + c = 2.

So, equations:

-2a - c = 0

a + c = 2

Multiply second equation by 1: a + c = 2

Add to first equation:

(-2a - c) + (a + c) = 0 + 2 ⇒ -a = 2 ⇒ a = -2.

Then, from equation 1: -2 + c = 2 ⇒ c = 4.

Check equation 2: ac + b + d = (-2)*4 + (-1) + (-2) = -8 -1 -2 = -11 ≠ 0.

Nope.

Next, (b,d) = (-2,-1):

Equation 3: a*(-1) + c*(-2) = 0 ⇒ -a -2c = 0.

From equation 1: a + c = 2.

So, equations:

-a - 2c = 0

a + c = 2

Add both equations:

(-a -2c) + (a + c) = 0 + 2 ⇒ -c = 2 ⇒ c = -2.

Then, from equation 1: a + (-2) = 2 ⇒ a = 4.

Check equation 2: ac + b + d = 4*(-2) + (-2) + (-1) = -8 -2 -1 = -11 ≠ 0.

So, none of these possibilities work. Therefore, quartic doesn't factor into quadratics with integer coefficients.

Therefore, perhaps the quartic is irreducible over integers, so we can't find a nice factorization.

Therefore, maybe we need another approach.

Wait, perhaps consider that since S1, S2, S3 are symmetric in the roots, maybe they are roots of a cubic equation with integer coefficients?

Given that S1 + S2 + S3 = 0, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = -8, and S1S2S3 = ?

If I can find S1S2S3, then the cubic is x³ -8x - (S1S2S3) = 0.

But how?

Wait, perhaps think of S1, S2, S3 as roots of x³ + px + q = 0, with p = -8, q = -rst.

But unless we can find another relation, it's hard.

Wait, but from the quartic equation, we can compute power sums for the roots, which we did earlier:

p₁ = -2, p₂ = 4, p₃ = -8, p₄ = 8.

But S1, S2, S3 are symmetric sums.

Wait, perhaps express S1, S2, S3 in terms of power sums.

Wait, S1 = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, which is a sum of two products.

Similarly, S2 and S3.

But maybe express S1 in terms of p₁² - 2p₂.

But p₁² = (α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄)^2 = α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄² + 2(p₂) = p₁².

Wait, no, p₁² = (α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄)^2 = α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄² + 2(α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄) = p₂ + 2σ₂.

Wait, in our case, σ₂ = 0, so p₁² = p₂.

But p₁ = -2, p₂ = 4, so indeed, (-2)^2 = 4.

Similarly, p₃ can be expressed as (p₁)^3 - 3 p₁ p₂ + 3σ₃.

So, p₃ = (-2)^3 - 3*(-2)*4 + 3*0 = -8 + 24 + 0 = 16.

But p₃ = α₁³ + α₂³ + α₃³ + α₄³ = 8, as we had earlier. So, this gives 16 = 8? No, that's a contradiction.

Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the Newton's identities relate power sums to elementary symmetric polynomials.

Wait, for four variables, the formula is:

p_k = σ₁ p_{k-1} - σ₂ p_{k-2} + σ₃ p_{k-3} - σ₄ p_{k-4}.

For k ≥ 1.

So, for k=3:

p₃ = σ₁ p₂ - σ₂ p₁ + σ₃ p₀ - σ₄ p_{-1}

But p₀ = 4 (since p₀ = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4), and p_{-1} is undefined.

Wait, maybe in this case, it's better to stick with known relations.

Wait, let me recall Newton's identities for four variables up to k=4.

For k=1:

p₁ = σ₁ = -2.

For k=2:

p₂ = σ₁ p₁ - 2σ₂ = (-2)(-2) - 2*0 = 4.

For k=3:

p₃ = σ₁ p₂ - σ₂ p₁ + 3σ₃ = (-2)(4) - 0*(-2) + 3*0 = -8.

For k=4:

p₄ = σ₁ p₃ - σ₂ p₂ + σ₃ p₁ - 4σ₄ = (-2)(-8) - 0*4 + 0*(-2) -4*2 = 16 - 0 + 0 -8 = 8.

Which matches our earlier result.

So, p₃ = -8, p₄ =8.

But how does this help us with S1S2S3?

Wait, perhaps use generating functions or another method.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the product S1S2S3 is equal to the determinant of a certain matrix, but that might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that S1, S2, S3 are the roots of a cubic equation, so their product is equal to the constant term, which we need to find.

But since we don't know this constant term, perhaps we need another equation.

Wait, let me recall that if we have three numbers S1, S2, S3 with known sum, sum of products, and sum of products of three, we can think of them as roots of a cubic equation.

Therefore, the cubic equation is x³ - (S1 + S2 + S3)x² + (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)x - S1S2S3 = 0, which is x³ - 0x² -8x - S1S2S3 = 0.

So, if I can find S1S2S3, then I can write the cubic.

But how?

Wait, perhaps use the fact that S1, S2, S3 are symmetric sums, so maybe they satisfy certain relations.

Wait, another idea: consider that S1, S2, S3 are related to the roots of the quartic equation.

Wait, perhaps consider that the quartic can be written as (x² - S1x + Q)(x² - S2x + R)(x² - S3x + T), but this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps note that the quartic can be factored into quadratics with coefficients related to S1, S2, S3.

But that might not directly help.

Wait, another idea: consider that for each root α_i, S1 = α_iα_j + α_kα_l, where j,k,l are the other indices.

But without specific knowledge of which roots are paired, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps if I consider that the quartic has roots α, β, γ, δ, then S1, S2, S3 are the three possible sums of products of two roots.

But the quartic is symmetric, so these sums are symmetric functions.

Wait, perhaps if I consider the elementary symmetric functions in S1, S2, S3.

But S1, S2, S3 are themselves symmetric sums, so their symmetric functions would be difficult to compute.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: since S1, S2, S3 are the elementary symmetric sums of certain pairings, their products can be linked back to the original polynomial.

But without a clear path, I might need to find another way.

Wait, another idea: consider that S1, S2, S3 can be considered as the roots of the equation whose coefficients are the symmetric sums of products of two roots.

But that's similar to what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the sum S1 + S2 + S3 = 0, sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = -8, and maybe the sum S1² + S2² + S3² can be computed.

Wait, S1² + S2² + S3² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = 0 - 2*(-8) = 16.

So, S1² + S2² + S3² = 16.

But without another equation, we can't find S1S2S3.

Wait, but perhaps relate S1S2S3 to other known quantities.

Wait, another thought: since the quartic is x⁴ + 2x³ + 2, we can consider its roots as α, β, γ, δ, and consider the products like (α + β)(γ + δ) = S1, etc.

But since α + β + γ + δ = -2, then γ + δ = -2 - (α + β).

So, S1 = (α + β)(-2 - α - β).

Similarly, S2 = (α + γ)(-2 - α - γ).

And S3 = (α + δ)(-2 - α - δ).

Therefore, S1 = (α + β)(-2 - S1), since S1 = α + β + γ + δ - (γ + δ) = ?

Wait, no, S1 = αβ + γδ.

Wait, maybe not useful.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that S1 = (α + β)(γ + δ) = (α + β)(-2 - α - β).

So, S1 = (α + β)(-2 - α - β) = -2(α + β) - (α + β)^2.

Similarly, for S2 and S3.

So, S1 = -2(α + β) - (α + β)^2.

Similarly, S2 = -2(α + γ) - (α + γ)^2.

S3 = -2(α + δ) - (α + δ)^2.

Therefore, each of S1, S2, S3 can be written in terms of the sum of two roots.

Therefore, S1, S2, S3 satisfy the equation:

t = -2s - s²,

where s is the sum of two roots.

Therefore, if I let s = α + β, then S1 = -2s - s².

But s can take any value as it's the sum of two roots. But since we have three different pairings, s, t, u, such that s + t + u = -2, and S1 = -2s - s², S2 = -2t - t², S3 = -2u - u².

But this seems too vague.

Wait, but S1, S2, S3 are related to s, t, u via quadratic equations.

But perhaps consider that s, t, u are roots of another cubic equation.

Wait, since s + t + u = -2,

sum of products st + su + tu = ?

Wait, since s = α + β, t = α + γ, u = α + δ.

Therefore, st = (α + β)(α + γ) = α² + α(β + γ) + βγ.

But β + γ = -2 - α - δ, from s + t + u = -2.

Wait, this seems too convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that s = α + β, t = α + γ, u = α + δ.

So, s + t + u = 3α + β + γ + δ = 3α + (-2 - α) = 2α - 2.

Similarly, s + t + u = 2α - 2.

But we don't know α.

Wait, another approach: since S1, S2, S3 are the three possible products of pairs of roots, their sum is zero, sum of products is -8, and sum of squares is 16.

So, if I can find S1S2S3, then the cubic equation is x³ -8x - (S1S2S3) = 0.

But we need another relation.

Wait, perhaps consider that the product S1S2S3 = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃).

Which can be expanded as:

= [α₁α₂(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄) + α₃α₄(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)] [α₁α₄ + α₂α₃]

Wait, maybe too complicated.

Wait, let me consider that S1S2S3 is equal to the product of (α_iα_j + α_kα_l) for all pairings.

Wait, but since there are three pairings, the product can be represented as the determinant of a certain matrix.

Wait, another idea: consider that if I have four variables, the product of (x + α_iα_j) for all pairings would be a quartic.

But perhaps not.

Wait, actually, the polynomial whose roots are α_iα_j for all i < j is a quadratic with roots α₁α₂, α₁α₃, α₁α₄, α₂α₃, α₂α₄, α₃α₄. Wait, but that's six roots, which is a sextic, but symmetric.

But actually, since we're pairing the roots into three products, maybe considering something else.

Wait, perhaps too convoluted.

Wait, perhaps consider that the product S1S2S3 can be found as the resultant of some polynomials, but that's too advanced.

Alternatively, think numerically. Let me suppose that the roots are specific complex numbers, and try to compute S1, S2, S3 numerically.

But that's not helpful without knowing the exact roots.

Alternatively, perhaps my earlier attempt to compute S1S2S3 was correct, and I just made a mistake in sign.

Wait, earlier, when I computed term ACE, I got 2α₁.

But in reality, perhaps term ACE should be 2α₁, and similarly, terms ACF, ADE, BDF would follow similar patterns.

Wait, but in any case, since we have 8 terms, it's difficult to compute without a pattern.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each term is 2α_i, for some i.

But since terms like ACE, ACF, ADE, etc., each have two α_i's and one α_j, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps give up and think that the set is {0, 2, -2}, but I need to verify.

Wait, but let's think: if S1S2S3 = 24, then the cubic is x³ -8x -24=0.

But is that correct?

Wait, I think I recall that for a quartic x⁴ + px³ + qx² + rx + s, the cubic resolvent is x³ - qx² + (pr - 4s)x - (p²s - 4q² - prq + 18s).

Wait, for our quartic x⁴ + 2x³ + 0x² + 0x + 2.

So, p = 2, q = 0, r = 0, s = 2.

Then, the cubic resolvent is:

x³ - 0x² + (2*0 - 4*2)x - (2²*2 - 4*0² - 2*0*0 + 18*2)

= x³ + (-8)x - (8 - 0 - 0 + 36)

= x³ -8x -44.

So, the cubic resolvent is x³ -8x -44.

Therefore, the cubic resolvent has roots S1, S2, S3.

Therefore, the set is the roots of x³ -8x -44 =0.

But in the problem statement, we need to determine the unordered set. So, unless we can factor this cubic, the roots are just the roots of this cubic.

But maybe the cubic factors into rational roots?

Let me test x=2: 8 -16 -44= -52≠0.

x=4: 64 -32 -44= -12≠0.

x=1: 1 -8 -44= -51≠0.

x= -2: -8 +16 -44= -36≠0.

x= -4: -64 +32 -44= -76≠0.

So, no rational roots. Therefore, the cubic is irreducible over rationals.

Therefore, the set is the three roots of x³ -8x -44=0.

But wait, the problem says "determine the unordered set {S1, S2, S3}".

So, since the cubic is irreducible, the set is the three real roots or complex roots of this cubic.

But perhaps the problem expects a nicer answer.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the resolvent computation.

Wait, let me double-check the resolvent formula.

The cubic resolvent for a quartic x⁴ + px³ + qx² + rx + s is x³ - qx² + (pr - 4s)x - (p²s - 4q² - prq + 18s).

So, in our case, p=2, q=0, r=0, s=2.

So,

First term: x³.

Second term: -0x².

Third term: (2*0 - 4*2)x = (-8)x.

Fourth term: -(2²*2 - 4*0² - 2*0*0 + 18*2) = -(8 - 0 - 0 + 36) = -44.

So, yes, the cubic is x³ -8x -44.

Therefore, the set is the three roots of this cubic.

But the problem says "determine the unordered set {S1, S2, S3}".

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps make a substitution to solve the cubic.

The cubic equation is x³ -8x -44=0.

Let me use the substitution x = y + a to eliminate the quadratic term, but since it's zero, no.

Alternatively, use Cardano's method.

The general cubic equation is t³ + pt² + qt + r = 0.

In our case, it's x³ -8x -44=0.

So, t³ + 0t² -8t -44=0.

Let me perform substitution t = y + z.

But perhaps better to use depressed cubic.

Let me set x = y + k, to eliminate the quadratic term.

Wait, equation is x³ -8x -44=0.

Let me set x = y + d.

Then, expanding:

(y + d)³ -8(y + d) -44=0.

= y³ + 3d y² + 3d² y + d³ -8y -8d -44=0.

To eliminate y² term, set 3d = 0 ⇒ d=0. Not helpful.

Wait, if I don't want to eliminate the quadratic term, but since it's zero, maybe proceed.

So, equation is y³ + (terms) y + ...=0.

But perhaps proceed with Cardano.

The equation is y³ -8y -44=0.

Let me set y³ + py + q =0, where p = -8, q = -44.

Using Cardano's formula.

Let y = u + v.

Then, y³ = (u + v)³ = u³ + v³ + 3uv(u + v) = u³ + v³ + 3uv y.

So, equation becomes:

u³ + v³ + 3uv y -8y -44 = 0.

Arrange:

(u³ + v³ -44) + y(3uv -8) =0.

Set 3uv -8=0 ⇒ uv = 8/3.

Thus, u³ + v³ =44.

But we have u³ + v³ =44 and u³v³ = (uv)³ = (8/3)^3 = 512 / 27.

So, let me set A = u³, B = v³.

Then, A + B =44,

A*B=512/27.

So, A and B are roots of the quadratic equation:

z² -44 z + 512/27=0.

Multiply through by 27:

27z² - 1188 z + 512 =0.

Use quadratic formula:

z = [1188 ± sqrt(1188² -4*27*512)] / (2*27).

Compute discriminant:

1188² = (1200 -12)² =1200² -2*1200*12 +12²=1,440,000 - 28,800 +144=1,411,464.

4*27*512=108*512=55,296.

So, discriminant=1,411,464 -55,296=1,356,168.

Compute sqrt(1,356,168).

Let me see: 1,356,168 ÷ 4 = 339,042.

339,042 ÷ 4=84,760.5, not integer.

Wait, 1,356,168 ÷ 16=84,760.5, not integer.

Wait, maybe it's 1,168²=1,364,224. That's a bit higher.

Wait, 1,160²=1,345,600. Difference=1,356,168 -1,345,600=10,568.

1,160²=1,345,600,

1,165²=1,357,225, which is higher than 1,356,168.

So, sqrt(1,356,168)= approximately 1,164.7.

But not exact. Therefore, it's not a perfect square.

Therefore, the roots are:

z = [1188 ± sqrt(1,356,168)] / 54.

But this is messy, so maybe the equation doesn't factor nicely.

Therefore, perhaps the cubic is irreducible, and the set is the three real roots, which can be expressed using radicals, but it's messy.

But since the problem asks to "determine the unordered set {S1, S2, S3}", and given that the cubic is x³ -8x -44=0, which is irreducible over rationals, I think the answer is the three roots of this cubic.

But maybe the problem expects a different approach, perhaps noticing that the quartic can be factored as (x² + a x + b)(x² + c x + d), but as we saw, the quartic is irreducible over integers.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartic is a biquadratic, but it has an x³ term, so not biquadratic.

Alternatively, maybe the quartic can be expressed as (x² + m x + n)² - (p x + q)^2, but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps the roots are related to the roots of another equation.

Wait, perhaps consider that the quartic x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 can be written as (x² + x)^2 + (x² +1) = x⁴ + 2x³ + x² + x² +1= x⁴ + 2x³ + 2x² +1, which is different. So, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution x = y - 0.5 to eliminate the cubic term.

Let me try that.

Let x = y - h, to eliminate the y³ term.

Compute x = y - h.

Then, x³ = (y - h)³ = y³ - 3h y² + 3h² y - h³,

x⁴ = (y - h)⁴ = y⁴ -4h y³ +6h² y² -4h³ y + h⁴.

Plug into quartic:

x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = (y⁴ -4h y³ +6h² y² -4h³ y + h⁴) + 2(y³ - 3h y² + 3h² y - h³) + 2.

Gather terms:

y⁴ + (-4h + 2)y³ + (6h² -6h)y² + (-4h³ +6h² -2h)y + (h⁴ -2h³ +2).

To eliminate y³ term, set coefficient to zero:

-4h + 2 =0 ⇒ h= 2/4= 1/2.

So, let h=1/2.

Then, substitute h=1/2 into the other coefficients.

Compute:

Coefficient of y³: 0.

Coefficient of y²: 6*(1/2)² -6*(1/2)= 6*(1/4) - 3= 1.5 -3= -1.5.

Coefficient of y: -4*(1/2)³ +6*(1/2)² -2*(1/2)= -4*(1/8) +6*(1/4) -1= -0.5 +1.5 -1=0.

Constant term: (1/2)^4 -2*(1/2)^3 +2=1/16 - 2*(1/8) +2=1/16 - 1/4 +2= (1 -4 +32)/16=29/16.

So, after substitution, the quartic becomes:

y⁴ - (3/2)y² + 29/16 =0.

But wait, that can't be.

Wait, I think I made a mistake.

Wait, when I substitute h=1/2, I should compute all terms correctly.

Wait, let me do that again.

Given x = y - 1/2.

Then, x = y - 1/2,

x³ = (y - 1/2)^3 = y³ - (3/2)y² + (3/4)y - 1/8,

x⁴ = (y - 1/2)^4 = y⁴ - 2y³ + (3/2)y² - y + 1/16.

So, x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = [y⁴ - 2y³ + (3/2)y² - y + 1/16] + 2[y³ - (3/2)y² + (3/4)y - 1/8] + 2.

Expand:

= y⁴ - 2y³ + (3/2)y² - y + 1/16 + 2y³ - 3y² + (3/2)y - 1/4 + 2.

Combine like terms:

y⁴ + ( -2y³ + 2y³ ) + ( (3/2)y² -3y² ) + ( -y + (3/2)y ) + (1/16 -1/4 +2).

Simplify:

y⁴ + 0y³ + (-3/2 y²) + (1/2 y) + (1/16 -4/16 +32/16)= y⁴ - (3/2)y² + (1/2)y + (29/16).

Therefore, the quartic equation is y⁴ - (3/2)y² + (1/2)y +29/16=0.

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

16y⁴ -24y² +8y +29=0.

So, 16y⁴ -24y² +8y +29=0.

This is still a quartic, but without the cubic term.

But it's not helpful for factoring.

Alternatively, perhaps try to factor into quadratics.

Assume it factors as (ay² + by + c)(dy² + ey + f)=0.

Then,

ad y⁴ + (ae + bd)y³ + (af + be + cd)y² + (bf + ce)y + cf=0.

Compare with 16y⁴ +0y³ -24y² +8y +29=0.

Thus,

ad=16,

ae + bd=0,

af + be + cd= -24,

bf + ce=8,

cf=29.

We need to find integers a,b,c,d,e,f such that these equations are satisfied.

Since ad=16, possible pairs (a,d): (1,16),(2,8),(4,4),(8,2),(16,1), and negative pairs.

Try a=4, d=4.

Then, ad=16.

Then, ae + bd=4e +4b=0 ⇒ 4(e + b)=0 ⇒ e = -b.

Next, af + be + cd=4f + b e +4c=4f + b*(-b) +4c=4f -b² +4c= -24.

Next, bf + ce= b f + c e= b f + c*(-b)=b(f - c)=8.

Finally, cf=29.

29 is prime, so c and f are (1,29) or (-1,-29).

Try c=1, f=29.

Then, cf=29.

From bf + ce= b(29 -1)=28b=8 ⇒ 28b=8 ⇒ b=8/28=2/7, not integer. Discard.

Try c=-1, f=-29.

Then, cf=29.

From bf + ce= b(-29 - (-1))=b(-28)=8 ⇒ -28b=8 ⇒ b= -8/28= -2/7, not integer.

Try c=29, f=1.

From bf + ce= b(1 -29)= -28b=8 ⇒ b= -8/28= -2/7, not integer.

Similarly, c=-29, f=-1.

bf + ce= b(-1 - (-29))=b(28)=8 ⇒ b=8/28=2/7, not integer.

Thus, no solution for a=4, d=4.

Try a=2, d=8.

Then, ad=16.

Then, ae + bd=2e +8b=0.

Thus, 2e = -8b ⇒ e = -4b.

Next, af + be + cd=2f +b e +8c=2f +b*(-4b) +8c=2f -4b² +8c= -24.

bf + ce= b f +c e= b f +c*(-4b)=b(f -4c)=8.

cf=29.

Again, c and f are (1,29) or (-1,-29).

Try c=1, f=29.

Then, from bf + ce= b(29 -4*1)=b(25)=8 ⇒ b=8/25, not integer.

c=-1, f=-29.

bf + ce= b(-29 -4*(-1))=b(-29 +4)=b(-25)=8 ⇒ b= -8/25, not integer.

c=29, f=1.

bf + ce= b(1 -4*29)=b(1 -116)=b(-115)=8 ⇒ b= -8/115, not integer.

c=-29, f=-1.

bf + ce= b(-1 -4*(-29))=b(-1 +116)=b(115)=8 ⇒ b=8/115, not integer.

No solution.

Next, try a=8, d=2.

Then, ae + bd=8e +2b=0 ⇒ 8e = -2b ⇒ 4e = -b.

Next, af + be + cd=8f +b e +2c=8f +b*(-b/4) +2c=8f - (b²)/4 +2c= -24.

bf + ce= b f +c e= b f +c*(-b/4)= (b)(f - c/4)=8.

cf=29.

Again, c and f are ±1, ±29.

Try c=1, f=29.

From bf + ce= b(29 -1/4)=b(115/4)=8 ⇒ b=32/115, not integer.

c=-1, f=-29.

bf + ce= b(-29 - (-1)/4)=b(-29 +1/4)=b(-115/4)=8 ⇒ b= -32/115, not integer.

c=29, f=1.

bf + ce= b(1 -29/4)=b(-25/4)=8 ⇒ b= -32/25, not integer.

c=-29, f=-1.

bf + ce= b(-1 - (-29)/4)=b(-1 +29/4)=b(25/4)=8 ⇒ b=32/25, not integer.

No solution.

Try a=16, d=1.

Then, ae + bd=16e +1b=0 ⇒ 16e = -b.

Next, af + be + cd=16f +b e +1c=16f +b*(-16e) +c=16f -16b e +c= -24.

bf + ce= b f +c e= b f +c*(-16b)=b(f -16c)=8.

cf=29.

Again, c and f are ±1, ±29.

From cf=29, c=1, f=29; c=-1,f=-29; c=29,f=1;c=-29,f=-1.

Try c=1, f=29.

From bf + ce= b(29 -16*1)=b(13)=8 ⇒ b=8/13, not integer.

c=-1, f=-29.

bf + ce= b(-29 -16*(-1))=b(-29 +16)=b(-13)=8 ⇒ b= -8/13, not integer.

c=29, f=1.

bf + ce= b(1 -16*29)=b(1 -464)=b(-463)=8 ⇒ b= -8/463, not integer.

c=-29,f=-1.

bf + ce= b(-1 -16*(-29))=b(-1 +464)=b(463)=8 ⇒ b=8/463, not integer.

No solution.

Thus, quartic doesn't factor into quadratics with integer coefficients.

Hence, the quartic is irreducible over integers, and thus the resolvent cubic is also irreducible over integers, so the roots can't be expressed in radicals in a simpler way.

Therefore, the set {S1, S2, S3} is the set of roots of the cubic equation x³ -8x -44=0.

Thus, the answer is the three roots of x³ -8x -44=0.

But, in the problem, the set is {S1, S2, S3}, which are S1 = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, etc. So, the set is {S1, S2, S3}, which are the roots of the cubic x³ -8x -44=0.

But I need to check my previous steps.

Wait, the resolvent cubic for a quartic x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 is indeed x³ - qx² + (pr -4s)x - (p²s -4q² - prq +18s)=x³ -8x -44.

Therefore, the set {S1, S2, S3} is the set of roots of x³ -8x -44=0.

So, the answer is the roots of this cubic.

But let me confirm with another source.

Wait, according to standard references, the resolvent cubic for quartic x⁴ + px³ + qx² + rx + s is given by:

t³ - qt² + (pr -4s)t - (p²s -4q² - prq +18s).

Which for p=2, q=0, r=0, s=2:

t³ - 0t² + (0 - 8)t - (8 -0 -0 + 36)= t³ -8t -44.

Thus, correct.

Therefore, the cubic is x³ -8x -44=0.

So, the set {S1, S2, S3} is the set of roots of this cubic, which can't be simplified further.

Hence, the answer is the three roots of the equation x³ -8x -44=0.

But wait, in the problem statement, it's written as "Determine the unordered set {S₁, S₂, S₃}", so perhaps they expect the answer to be {2, 2, 2} or something, but as we saw, the cubic is irreducible.

But maybe I made a miscalculation earlier in computing the resolvent cubic.

Wait, let me double-check the resolvent cubic formula.

From standard references, the resolvent cubic for quartic x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d is:

x³ - b x² + (ac -4d)x - (a²d -4b² -ac b +18 d).

Wait, so in our case, quartic is x⁴ +2x³ +0x² +0x +2.

So, a=2, b=0, c=0, d=2.

Thus:

resolvent cubic is:

x³ -0x² + (2*0 -4*2)x - (2²*2 -4*0² -2*0*0 +18*2).

Compute:

= x³ + 0x² + (-8)x - (8 -0 -0 +36)

= x³ -8x -44.

So, correct.

Therefore, the set is the roots of x³ -8x -44=0.

But, as the problem says "Determine the unordered set {S₁, S₂, S₃}", perhaps it's expecting the roots in some specific form or maybe a trick is involved.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the quartic is a reciprocal equation. Let me check.

If I reverse the coefficients: 2x⁴ +0x³ +0x² +2x +1.

Not same as original.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the roots come in reciprocal pairs.

But, it's unclear.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the quartic is a quadratic in x² + x.

Let me check.

Let me set y = x² +x.

Then, x⁴ = y² - 2x³ +x².

But quartic is x⁴ +2x³ +2.

Express in terms of y:

x⁴ +2x³ +2= y² -2x³ +x² +2x³ +2= y² +x² +2.

But x² = y -x.

So, y² + (y -x) +2= y² + y -x +2.

But we still have x, so not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartic can be expressed as (x² + a x + b)(x² + c x + d). But as before, it's not working.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of the roots is -2, and the sum of the products is 0, and the product is -2.

Wait, but since the cubic resolvent is x³ -8x -44=0, and the roots are S1, S2, S3, then the set {S1, S2, S3} is the set of roots of this cubic.

Therefore, the answer is the roots of x³ -8x -44=0.

But since the problem asks for the unordered set, and the roots are real or complex?

Wait, let me check the cubic equation for real roots.

Compute f(x)=x³ -8x -44.

Compute f(4)=64 -32 -44= -12,

f(5)=125 -40 -44=41,

So, between x=4 and x=5, there is a real root.

Also, compute f(-3)= -27 +24 -44= -47,

f(-4)= -64 +32 -44= -76,

So, another real root at some x < -3.

And since it's a cubic, one more real root.

Thus, all three roots are real.

Therefore, the set {S1, S2, S3} is the three real roots of x³ -8x -44=0.

But as the problem seems expecting an exact answer, perhaps they are nice integers, but since the cubic doesn't factor nicely, maybe we need to leave it as roots.

Alternatively, perhaps the cubic factors as (x - a)(x² +bx +c)=0, but not with integer coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps the cubic is solvable by radicals.

Compute discriminant of cubic: D=18abcd -4b³d +b²c² -4ac³ -27a²d².

But for cubic ax³ +bx² +cx +d=0.

But in our case, a=1, b=0, c=-8, d=-44.

Thus, discriminant D=18*1*0*(-8)*(-44) -4*0³*(-44) +0²*(-8)² -4*1*(-8)³ -27*1²*(-44)².

Compute term by term:

First term: 18*1*0*(-8)*(-44)=0.

Second term: -4*0³*(-44)=0.

Third term: 0²*(-8)²=0.

Fourth term: -4*1*(-8)³= -4*(-512)=2048.

Fifth term: -27*1²*(-44)²= -27*(1936)= -52272.

Thus, D=0 +0 +0 +2048 -52272= -50224.

Since discriminant is negative, the cubic has one real root and two complex conjugate roots.

But earlier, the function f(x) crosses the x-axis three times, so all roots are real.

Wait, contradiction.

Wait, discriminant for cubic is given by:

For ax³ + bx² + cx + d=0,

D=18abcd -4b³d +b²c² -4ac³ -27a²d².

But for our cubic x³ -8x -44=0,

a=1, b=0, c=-8, d=-44.

Thus,

D=18*1*0*(-8)*(-44) -4*0³*(-44) +0²*(-8)² -4*1*(-8)³ -27*1²*(-44)².

Compute term by term:

First term: 0.

Second term: 0.

Third term: 0.

Fourth term: -4*( -512 ) = 2048.

Fifth term: -27*(1936)= -52272.

Thus, D=0 +0 +0 +2048 -52272= -50224.

But wait, for cubic equation, discriminant D:

- If D >0: three distinct real roots.

- If D=0: multiple roots.

- If D <0: one real root and two complex conjugate roots.

But in our case, D= -50224 <0, so one real root and two complex roots.

But earlier, when I checked f(4)=-12, f(5)=41, so there is a real root between 4 and5.

Similarly, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches -infty, so the other roots must be complex.

Thus, the cubic x³ -8x -44=0 has one real root and two complex conjugate roots.

Therefore, the set {S1, S2, S3} is one real number and two complex conjugate numbers.

But the problem says "Determine the unordered set {S₁, S₂, S₃}".

But given that the problem is likely expecting an exact form, perhaps recognizing that S1, S2, S3 are roots of the cubic, but it's a bit unsatisfying.

Alternatively, perhaps the roots are in some symmetric relation.

But since I can't find a way to express them in radicals, I think the answer is the roots of x³ -8x -44=0.

But I can also write them as:

x = \sqrt[3]{8 + \sqrt{50224}} + \sqrt[3]{8 - \sqrt{50224}}.

But that's messy.

Alternatively, using trigonometric substitution for depressed cubic.

Given cubic t³ + pt + q=0.

Here, equation is t³ -8t -44=0.

So, p= -8, q= -44.

Using the substitution t=2√(8/3) cosθ= 2*(2√6)/3 cosθ= (4√6)/3 cosθ.

Thus, substituting t= (4√6)/3 cosθ.

Then, equation becomes:

[(4√6)/3 cosθ]^3 -8*(4√6)/3 cosθ -44=0.

Compute:

(64*6√6)/27 cos³θ - (32√6)/3 cosθ -44=0.

Simplify:

(384√6)/27 cos³θ - (32√6)/3 cosθ -44=0.

Simplify fractions:

384/27=128/9,

32/3=32/3.

Thus,

(128√6)/9 cos³θ - (32√6)/3 cosθ -44=0.

Multiply both sides by 9:

128√6 cos³θ -96√6 cosθ -396=0.

Factor out 4√6:

4√6(32 cos³θ -24 cosθ) -396=0.

Hmm, maybe another substitution.

Alternatively, use the identity cos3θ=4cos³θ -3cosθ.

Let me set u=cosθ, then 4u³ -3u= cos3θ.

But in our equation:

128√6 cos³θ -96√6 cosθ =44.

Factor:

4√6(32 cos³θ -24 cosθ)=44.

Divide both sides by 4:

√6(32 cos³θ -24 cosθ)=11.

Factor inside:

32 cos³θ -24 cosθ=8 cosθ(4 cos²θ -3).

Set 8 cosθ(4 cos²θ -3)=11/√6.

But 4 cos²θ -3=2(2 cos²θ -1.5)=2(cos2θ +0.5). Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, set 8√6 cosθ(4 cos²θ -3)=11.

Let me denote z=8√6 cosθ(4 cos²θ -3).

Wait, but the equation is:

8√6 cosθ(4 cos²θ -3)=11.

Let me set φ such that cos3φ=... Wait, maybe this is too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the real root is expressible as 2√(something).

But without more insight, it's difficult.

Therefore, given the time I've spent, I think the answer is that the set {S1, S2, S3} is the set of roots of the cubic equation x³ -8x -44=0.

So, in boxed form, the unordered set is the roots of this cubic. But since the problem asks to determine the set, perhaps they expect the roots expressed in terms of radicals.

But as we saw, the roots are messy.

Alternatively, maybe they are 2, 2, 2, but that was incorrect as the cubic doesn't have multiple roots.

Alternatively, maybe the roots are 2, 2, 2, but the cubic is x³ -8x -44=0, which doesn't have 2 as a root.

Wait, plug x=2: 8 -16 -44= -52≠0.

Thus, that's not.

Alternatively, maybe the set is {2, 2, 2}, but cubic is different.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, but no.

Given all that, I think the answer is the roots of the cubic equation x³ -8x -44=0, which cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, the unordered set {S₁, S₂, S₃} is the set of roots of x³ -8x -44=0.

**Final Answer**
The unordered set is the roots of the cubic equation \(x^3 - 8x - 44 = 0\), so the final answer is \boxed{\{-4, 2, 2\}}.

Wait, wait, hold on. In my earlier calculation, I thought that the cubic was x³ -8x -44=0, but when I substituted x=2, it didn't work, and the cubic is not having 2 as a root.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the resolvent cubic.

Wait, let me check the resolvent cubic computation again.

Given quartic x⁴ +2x³ +2=0.

The resolvent cubic is given by:

t³ - qx² + (pr -4s)t - (p²s -4q² - prq +18s)=0.

Here, p=2, q=0, r=0, s=2.

Thus:

t³ -0t² + (0 -8)t - (8 -0 -0)= t³ -8t -8=0.

Wait, earlier I thought it was t³ -8t -44=0, but now, with correct substitution, it's t³ -8t -8=0.

Wait, that must be the correct resolvent cubic.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the formula earlier.

Let me refer to a standard source: the resolvent cubic for quartic x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d is:

t³ - b t² + (ac -4d) t - (a² d -4b² - a c b +18 d).

So, in our case, quartic x⁴ +2x³ +0x² +0x +2=0.

Thus, a=2, b=0, c=0, d=2.

Therefore, resolvent cubic:

t³ -0 t² + (2*0 -4*2)t - (2²*2 -4*0² -2*0*0 +18*2)= t³ -8t - (8 -0 +0 +36)= t³ -8t -44=0.

Wait, so it's consistent. So, it is t³ -8t -44=0.

But wait, in another computation, I thought s=2, and the formula was t³ - q t² + (pr -4s) t - (p² s -4q² - pr q +18s)=0.

Given p=2, q=0, r=0, s=2,

t³ -0 t² + (0 -8)t - (8 -0 -0 +36)= t³ -8t -44=0.

So, it's consistent.

Therefore, seems that my initial conclusion was correct.

Thus, the resolvent cubic is indeed x³ -8x -44=0.

But wait, in the problem statement, the quartic is x⁴ +2x³ +2=0, which is different from the quartic in the standard example.

Thus, likely, the answer is the roots of x³ -8x -44=0, so as per instructions, the final answer is \boxed{\{-4, 2, 2\}}.

Wait, but according to my calculations, the cubic is x³ -8x -44=0, whose roots are not {-4,2,2}.

Wait, let me check.

If x= -4: (-4)^3 -8*(-4) -44= -64 +32 -44= -76≠0.

x=2: 8 -16 -44= -52≠0.

x=4: 64 -32 -44= -12≠0.

Thus, {-4,2,2} is not the roots.

Wait, so I think I was wrong in the final step.

Given that, perhaps the cubic is x³ -8x -44=0.

But this cannot be simplified, so the final answer is that the set is \{S₁, S₂, S₃\} where S₁, S₂, S₃ are roots of x³ -8x -44=0.

But in the problem statement, it's required to determine the set, so if it's not able to be simplified, it must be presented as roots of the cubic.

But in the original problem statement, the quartic is x⁴ +2x³ +2=0, which is different from the standard quartic.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in applying the resolvent cubic.

Wait, according to the source, the resolvent cubic for quartic x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d=0 is:

x³ - b x² + (ac -4d)x - (a²d -4b² -a b c +18b d)=0.

Wait, in our case, quartic is x⁴ +2x³ +0x² +0x +2=0.

Thus, a=2, b=0, c=0, d=2.

Thus, resolvent cubic:

x³ -0x² + (2*0 -4*2)x - (2²*2 -4*0² -2*0*0 +18*0)=x³ -8x -8=0.

Wait, that's different.

So, resolvent cubic is x³ -8x -8=0.

But in this case, the resolvent cubic is x³ -8x -8=0.

So, S1, S2, S3 are roots of x³ -8x -8=0.

Compute for x=2: 8 -16 -8= -16≠0.

x=4:64 -32 -8=24≠0.

x=1:1 -8 -8=-15≠0.

x= -2: -8 +16 -8=0. So, x= -2 is a root.

Thus, factor cubic as (x +2)(x² -2x -4)=0.

Thus, roots are x= -2, and x= [2 ±√(4 +16)]/2= [2 ±√20]/2=1 ±√5.

Thus, the roots are -2,1 +√5,1 -√5.

Therefore, the resolvent cubic is x³ -8x -8=0, whose roots are -2, 1 +√5, 1 -√5.

Therefore, S₁, S₂, S₃ are -2,1 +√5,1 -√5.

Thus, the unordered set {S₁, S₂, S₃} is { -2, 1 +√5, 1 -√5 }.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{\{-2, 1 + \sqrt{5}, 1 - \sqrt{5}\}}.

**Final Answer**
The unordered set is \boxed{\{-2, 1 + \sqrt{5}, 1 - \sqrt{5}\}}.
</think>

Given the quartic equation \(\alpha^4 + 2\alpha^3 + 2 = 0\) with roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\), we need to determine the unordered set \(\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}\) where \(S_i = \alpha_i \alpha_j + \alpha_k \alpha_l\) for \(i < j\) and \(k < l\) are indices such that \(\{i, j\} \cap \{k, l\} = \emptyset\).

First, we use Vieta's formulas to find the sums and products of the roots:
- Sum of roots: \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\)
- Sum of products of roots taken two at a time: \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
- Sum of products of roots taken three at a time: \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
- Product of roots: \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2\)

We need to find the sums \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

Using the resolvent cubic method, we find that the resolvent cubic for the given quartic equation is:
\[ t^3 - 8t - 8 = 0 \]

The roots of this cubic equation are:
- \(t = -2\)
- \(t = 1 + \sqrt{5}\)
- \(t = 1 - \sqrt{5}\)

Thus, the unordered set \(\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}\) is:
\[
\boxed{\{-2, 1 + \sqrt{5}, 1 - \sqrt{5}\}}
\]
