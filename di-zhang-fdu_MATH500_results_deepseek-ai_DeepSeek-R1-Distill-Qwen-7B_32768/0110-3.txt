draw((-.3,-3)--(.1,1)--(-1,0)--(3,0)--cycle);
label("$A$",(.1,1),N);
label("$B$",(-1,0),W);
label("$C$",(0,0),NE);
label("$D$",(3,0),E);
label("$E$",(-.3,-3),S);
[/asy]

Correct Answer:
Since $AB \parallel DE,$ we know that $\angle A = \angle E$ and $\angle B = \angle D.$ That works out nicely, since that means $\triangle ABC \sim EDC.$ If $BD = 4BC,$ that means $CD = BD - BC = 3BC.$ Therefore, the ratio of sides in $ABC$ to $EDC$ is $1:3,$ meaning the ratio of their areas is $1:9.$

Since the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $6\text{ cm}^2,$ that means the area of $\triangle CDE$ is $\boxed{54}\text{ cm}^2.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first because the Asymptote code isn't showing the image, but I can imagine it based on the description. There's a triangle ABC with an area of 6 square centimeters. The lines AB and DE are parallel. Also, BD is four times BC. The question is asking for the area of triangle CDE. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out where all these points are. Let me try to sketch a rough diagram in my mind. There's triangle ABC, and points D and E are such that DE is parallel to AB. BD is four times BC, so point D is somewhere extending from B. E is another point, probably extending from A or C? Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Coordinates might help me calculate lengths and areas more precisely. Let's place point B at the origin (0,0) to simplify things. Since AB is parallel to DE, and BD is four times BC, maybe I can assign coordinates in such a way that calculations will be straightforward.

Let's assign coordinates:

- Let’s put point B at (0,0). Since BD is four times BC, if I can figure out the coordinates of C and D, that might help. But I don't know where C is yet. Maybe I should assign point C somewhere else.

Wait, let's think about the triangle ABC. Since the area is given, maybe I can assign coordinates to A, B, and C such that the area formula will hold. Let's assume point C is at (c, 0) on the x-axis for simplicity, so BC is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (c, 0). Then point A can be somewhere above the x-axis, say at (d, e), so that the area of triangle ABC is 6 cm².

The area of triangle ABC can be calculated using the formula:

Area = (base * height)/2

Here, the base is BC, which is length c, and the height is the y-coordinate of point A, which is e. So,

6 = (c * e)/2 => c * e = 12

So, c times e equals 12. Hmm, I'll need to remember that.

Now, we need to figure out where point D is. It says BD = 4 BC. Since BC is from (0,0) to (c,0), BD is four times that length. So, BD would be 4c. Since BD is a straight line from B, which is at (0,0), and if BC is along the x-axis, then D must be on the x-axis extended beyond C. So, if BC is length c, then BD is 4c, so D is located at (4c, 0). Got it.

So, point D is at (4c, 0). Now, line DE is parallel to AB. So, DE || AB. That means the slope of DE is equal to the slope of AB.

Let me find the slope of AB. Point A is at (d, e), and point B is at (0,0). So, the slope of AB is (e - 0)/(d - 0) = e/d.

Therefore, the slope of DE must also be e/d. Now, point D is at (4c, 0), and point E is somewhere. Let's assume E is at (x, y). The slope of DE is (y - 0)/(x - 4c) = y/(x - 4c). This must equal e/d.

So, we have y/(x - 4c) = e/d => y = (e/d)(x - 4c). So, point E lies somewhere on this line.

But we need another condition to find E. Maybe point E is related to point A or C? Let's see.

Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws points A, B, C, D, E in a specific order. The code is:

draw((-.3,-3)--(.1,1)--(-1,0)--(3,0)--cycle);

Wait, maybe I need to infer the connections. It connects (-.3,-3) to (.1,1), then to (-1,0), then to (3,0), then back to cycle. Maybe the points are connected as A-E-B-C-D? Not sure, but in the Asymptote code, A is at (.1,1), B is at (-1,0), C is at (0,0), D is at (3,0), and E is at (-.3,-3). So, in the drawing, A is connected to E, E to B, B to C, C to D, and D back to A? Hmm, that might make sense. So, lines AE, EB, BC, CD, DA.

But the problem says AB is parallel to DE. So, let me see, AB is from A(.1,1) to B(-1,0), and DE is from D(3,0) to E(-.3,-3). Let me check if these are parallel.

Slope of AB: (0 - 1)/(-1 - 0.1) = (-1)/(-1.1) ≈ 0.909.

Slope of DE: (-3 - 0)/(-.3 - 3) = (-3)/(-3.3) ≈ 0.909. So yes, they are parallel. That makes sense.

So, in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are roughly:

A: (0.1, 1)

B: (-1, 0)

C: (0, 0)

D: (3, 0)

E: (-0.3, -3)

So, maybe I can use these specific coordinates to calculate areas, but since the problem is general, maybe coordinates are a good approach.

But perhaps it's better to keep things symbolic. Let me try to find coordinates based on the given information.

Given:

- ABC is a triangle with area 6.

- AB || DE.

- BD = 4 BC.

We need to find area of triangle CDE.

So, let me set up coordinates:

Let’s place point B at (0,0). Let’s let point C be at (k, 0). So, BC is the segment from (0,0) to (k,0), so BD is four times BC, so BD is 4k. Therefore, point D is at (4k, 0).

Point A is somewhere not on the x-axis, let's say (a, b). Then, the area of triangle ABC is 6, which can be calculated using the determinant formula:

Area = (1/2)| (Bx(Cy - Ay) + Cx(Ay - By) + Ax(By - Cy) ) |

Plugging in the coordinates:

B is (0,0), C is (k,0), A is (a,b).

So,

Area = (1/2)| 0*(0 - b) + k*(b - 0) + a*(0 - 0) | = (1/2)|0 + kb + 0| = (1/2)|kb| = (1/2)kb.

Since area is positive, (1/2)kb = 6 => kb = 12.

So, kb = 12. That's one equation.

Now, since AB || DE, the slope of AB must equal the slope of DE.

Slope of AB: (b - 0)/(a - 0) = b/a.

Slope of DE: Let’s denote point E as (p, q). Since D is at (4k,0), slope of DE is (q - 0)/(p - 4k) = q/(p - 4k).

Therefore, b/a = q/(p - 4k).

So, q = (b/a)(p - 4k). Equation 1.

Now, we need another equation to find E. Maybe E lies on a line from A or something? Wait, looking back at the Asymptote code, point E is connected to A and B.

In the Asymptote code, point E is connected to A and B, so line AE and EB. So, point E is connected to both A and B. Therefore, point E must lie somewhere such that lines AE and EB are connected.

But in our coordinate system, point E is connected to A(a,b) and B(0,0). So, line AE is from (a,b) to (p,q), and line BE is from (0,0) to (p,q).

Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, it's A connected to E, E connected to B, B connected to C, C connected to D, D connected to A. So, E is connected to A and B.

Therefore, in our coordinate system, E is a point such that lines AE and EB exist.

Therefore, point E must lie somewhere on the plane, such that lines AE and EB are connected. But given our conditions, perhaps E lies on line AB extended? Hmm, not necessarily.

Wait, if AB is parallel to DE, and E is connected to B, maybe triangle ABE is similar to something? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E lies on the extension of AB beyond B? Or beyond A?

Wait, in the Asymptote code, E is at (-0.3, -3). So, in the drawing, E is below the x-axis, connected to A above and B on the left.

So, in our coordinate system, E is at some point (p, q) below the x-axis.

Given that DE is parallel to AB, so the slope of DE is equal to the slope of AB.

From above, we have q = (b/a)(p - 4k). Since E is below the x-axis, q is negative. So, (b/a)(p - 4k) is negative.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact positions, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps we can parametrize point E such that line DE is parallel to AB. So, DE is a translated version of AB.

But since D is at (4k, 0), and AB goes from (0,0) to (a,b), then DE from (4k,0) to (4k + a, b). Wait, is that possible?

Wait, if we translate AB by vector (4k, 0), then point D would be at (4k,0), and point E would be at (4k + a, b). But in that case, E would be at (4k + a, b). But in the Asymptote code, E is below the x-axis, but in our coordinate system, b is positive because A is above the x-axis. So, if E is at (4k + a, b), it would be above the x-axis, but in the drawing, E is below.

Hmm, so maybe E is in the opposite direction? So, instead of translating AB by (4k,0), we translate it by (-4k,0). Let me think.

If we have AB from (0,0) to (a,b), and DE is from (4k,0) to (4k - a, -b). So, point E is at (4k - a, -b). Let's check the slope:

Slope of DE: (-b - 0)/(4k - a - 4k) = (-b)/(-a) = b/a, which is equal to the slope of AB. So, yes, that works.

So, point E is at (4k - a, -b). That makes sense because in the Asymptote code, E is connected to A and B, so it's in the opposite direction from D.

Therefore, E is at (4k - a, -b). So, that gives us the coordinates of E.

Now, we can find the coordinates of all points:

- A: (a, b)

- B: (0, 0)

- C: (k, 0)

- D: (4k, 0)

- E: (4k - a, -b)

Now, we need to find the area of triangle CDE.

First, let's write down the coordinates of C, D, and E.

- C: (k, 0)

- D: (4k, 0)

- E: (4k - a, -b)

So, triangle CDE has vertices at (k, 0), (4k, 0), and (4k - a, -b).

To find its area, we can use the shoelace formula.

First, let's list the coordinates:

C: (k, 0)

D: (4k, 0)

E: (4k - a, -b)

So, let's arrange them in order for the shoelace formula:

C: (k, 0)

D: (4k, 0)

E: (4k - a, -b)

Back to C: (k, 0)

Shoelace formula is:

Area = (1/2)|sum(x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|

Calculating each term:

First term: x_C * y_D - x_D * y_C = k * 0 - 4k * 0 = 0 - 0 = 0

Second term: x_D * y_E - x_E * y_D = 4k * (-b) - (4k - a) * 0 = -4k b - 0 = -4k b

Third term: x_E * y_C - x_C * y_E = (4k - a) * 0 - k * (-b) = 0 + k b = k b

So, sum of these terms: 0 + (-4k b) + (k b) = (-4k b + k b) = -3k b

Take absolute value and multiply by 1/2:

Area = (1/2)| -3k b | = (1/2)(3k b) = (3/2)k b

But from earlier, we have that k b = 12.

So, Area = (3/2)(12) = 18

Wait, that can't be right because triangle ABC has area 6, and triangle CDE is 18? That seems too big.

Wait, maybe I messed up the shoelace formula. Let me double-check.

Shoelace formula: Area = (1/2)|sum from i=1 to n of (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|

So, for points C(k,0), D(4k,0), E(4k - a, -b), back to C(k,0).

First term: x_C y_D - x_D y_C = k*0 - 4k*0 = 0

Second term: x_D y_E - x_E y_D = 4k*(-b) - (4k - a)*0 = -4k b - 0 = -4k b

Third term: x_E y_C - x_C y_E = (4k - a)*0 - k*(-b) = 0 + k b = k b

Total sum: 0 -4k b + k b = -3k b

Absolute value: 3k b

Multiply by 1/2: (3/2)k b

Since k b = 12, area is (3/2)*12 = 18

Hmm, so according to this, the area is 18. But that seems too large because triangle ABC is only 6. Let me think if this is possible.

Wait, maybe the coordinate system is scaled. Let me think about the vector approach.

Alternatively, since DE is parallel to AB, triangles CDE and CAB are similar? Wait, is that the case?

Wait, if DE is parallel to AB, then angle at C is common, so triangles CDE and CAB are similar by AA similarity.

But wait, is that true? Let me see.

In triangle CAB, we have points C, A, B.

In triangle CDE, we have points C, D, E.

If DE is parallel to AB, then angle at C is the same for both triangles. Additionally, the corresponding angles at D and A, as well as E and B, are equal because of the parallel lines.

Therefore, triangles CAB and CDE are similar.

So, similarity ratio.

What is the ratio of similarity?

Since BD = 4 BC, and BC is a side of triangle ABC, which is similar to triangle CDE.

Wait, BD is 4 BC. So, BC is from B to C, which is length k, and BD is from B to D, which is 4k. So, the ratio of BD to BC is 4:1.

But how does this relate to the similarity ratio?

Wait, if DE is parallel to AB, then the ratio of similarity is the ratio of CD to CB.

Wait, CD is from C to D, which is length 3k, because CB is k, and BD is 4k, so CD is CB + BD = k + 4k = 5k? Wait, no, actually, in the coordinate system, point D is at (4k, 0), so CD is from C(k,0) to D(4k,0), which is 3k. So, CD is 3k, CB is k.

Therefore, the ratio of CD to CB is 3:1.

Since triangles CAB and CDE are similar with a ratio of 3:1, the area ratio would be (3)^2 = 9:1.

Therefore, area of CDE is 9 times area of CAB.

But wait, area of CAB is the same as area of ABC, which is 6. So, area of CDE would be 9*6=54? But that contradicts our previous shoelace result of 18.

Hmm, something is wrong here.

Wait, maybe the similarity ratio is not 3:1. Let me think again.

If DE is parallel to AB, then the ratio of similarity is the ratio of CD to CB.

Wait, point C is the common vertex, and DE is a line cutting CA and CB extended.

Wait, no, point D is on the extension of CB beyond B, right? Because BC is from B to C, and BD is four times BC, so D is beyond B.

Wait, if D is beyond B, then CD is CB + BD = k + 4k = 5k.

Wait, hold on, no. Wait, in our coordinate system, point C is at (k,0), point B is at (0,0), and point D is at (4k, 0). So, CD is from (k,0) to (4k,0), which is 3k, not 5k. So, CD is 3k, CB is k, so the ratio is 3:1.

But in triangle CDE and triangle CAB, the sides CD and CB correspond. So, the ratio is CD/CB = 3/1.

Therefore, the ratio of similarity is 3, so the area ratio is 9. So, area of CDE is 9 times area of CAB. But CAB is triangle ABC, which is 6. So, 9*6=54. But we got 18 earlier.

There's a discrepancy here. So, which one is correct?

Wait, maybe the triangles aren't similar in the way I thought. Let me confirm.

Triangles CAB and CDE: are they similar?

In triangle CAB, we have points C, A, B.

In triangle CDE, we have points C, D, E.

If DE is parallel to AB, then angles at C are the same, angle at D is equal to angle at A, and angle at E is equal to angle at B. So, by AA similarity, they should be similar.

But according to the coordinates, the area came out to be 18, but similarity suggests 54. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the coordinate approach is right, but similarity is being misapplied.

Wait, in the coordinate system, triangle CDE has coordinates (k,0), (4k,0), (4k - a, -b). The shoelace formula gave area 18.

But triangle CAB has coordinates (k,0), (a,b), (0,0). Let's compute its area.

Using shoelace for CAB:

Points: C(k,0), A(a,b), B(0,0), back to C(k,0).

Compute:

First term: x_C y_A - x_A y_C = k*b - a*0 = k b

Second term: x_A y_B - x_B y_A = a*0 - 0*b = 0 - 0 = 0

Third term: x_B y_C - x_C y_B = 0*0 - k*0 = 0 - 0 = 0

Total sum: k b + 0 + 0 = k b

Area = (1/2)|k b| = (1/2)k b

But earlier, we had k b = 12, so area of CAB is (1/2)(12) = 6, which matches given area of ABC is 6.

So, area of CAB is 6, which is same as area of ABC.

But triangle CDE is similar to CAB with ratio 3, so area should be 54.

But shoelace gave 18.

Wait, maybe the similarity is not correct. Wait, in triangle CAB, point D is not on AC, but on CB extended. So, perhaps the triangles are not similar in the way I thought.

Wait, in triangle CAB, sides are CA, AB, BC.

In triangle CDE, sides are CD, DE, EC.

But DE is parallel to AB, but CD is not necessarily proportional to CA.

Wait, actually, in triangle CAB, point D is along CB extended beyond B, and E is somewhere else.

Wait, maybe the similarity isn't direct. Maybe I need to use another method.

Alternatively, let's compute vectors.

Vector AB is (a, b), vector DE is (4k - a - 4k, -b - 0) = (-a, -b). So, vector DE = (-a, -b) = -1*(a, b) = -AB.

So, vector DE is the negative of vector AB. So, DE is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to AB.

Therefore, triangles ABC and CDE are related by a translation and scaling?

Wait, but in any case, the area scaling.

Wait, since DE is equal in length to AB but in opposite direction, and since the height from C to AB is the same as the height from C to DE, because DE is parallel to AB.

Wait, but in our coordinate system, DE is below the x-axis, so the height would be negative, but the area is absolute.

Wait, maybe the area of CDE is the same as area of ABC? But that can't be because coordinates gave 18.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the area using base and height.

In triangle ABC, base BC is k, height is b (from point A). So, area is (1/2)*k*b = 6 => k*b = 12.

In triangle CDE, base CD is 3k (from C to D), height is the perpendicular distance from E to CD.

Wait, CD is along the x-axis from (k,0) to (4k,0). So, the base CD is on the x-axis. The height would be the y-coordinate of E, which is -b. But since area is absolute, it's | -b | = b.

Therefore, area of CDE is (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*(3k)*(b) = (3/2)*k*b. Since k*b=12, area is (3/2)*12 = 18.

So, this confirms the shoelace result.

But earlier, I thought triangles CAB and CDE are similar with ratio 3:1, which would give area ratio 9:1, so area of CDE should be 54. But that doesn't align with either shoelace or base-height.

Wait, perhaps my assumption about similarity was incorrect.

Wait, so if DE is parallel to AB, but DE is not part of triangle CAB, but part of triangle CDE. So, perhaps the triangles are not similar, but some other relation.

Wait, maybe the ratio is not 3:1 but something else.

Wait, looking back, in triangle ABC, base BC is k, and in triangle CDE, base CD is 3k.

But if DE is parallel to AB, then the ratio of DE to AB is equal to the ratio of CD to CB.

Wait, CD is 3k, CB is k, so ratio is 3:1. So, DE is 3 times AB.

But in reality, DE is equal in length to AB but in the opposite direction, so DE is equal to AB.

Wait, in our coordinate system, DE is vector (-a, -b), while AB is (a, b). So, DE is -1 times AB, so same length, opposite direction.

Therefore, DE = AB in length.

So, if DE is equal in length to AB, but CD is 3 times BC, then the area ratio is (CD / CB) * (DE / AB) = 3 * 1 = 3.

But wait, area scales with the product of ratios if both base and height are scaled. But in this case, DE is parallel to AB, but the heights may not scale the same way.

Wait, actually, in triangle CDE, the base CD is 3 times BC, and the height from E is same as the height from A to BC?

Wait, no, because E is below the x-axis, so the height would actually be negative, but area is absolute.

Wait, in triangle ABC, the height from A is b.

In triangle CDE, the height from E is | -b | = b.

So, the height is same.

But base is 3 times longer.

Therefore, area of CDE should be 3 times area of ABC.

Area of ABC is 6, so area of CDE is 18.

That's consistent with both the shoelace formula and the base-height approach.

So, why did I think similarity gave 54?

Because I thought CD / CB = 3, so similarity ratio is 3, hence area is 9 times. But that's incorrect because triangle CDE is not similar to triangle CAB.

Wait, triangle CAB has base CB and height from A, triangle CDE has base CD and height from E.

But since DE is parallel to AB, the triangles CDE and CAB are not similar, because the angles at C are the same, but the other angles aren't necessarily equal.

Wait, actually, they are similar because of the parallel lines. Let me think again.

Since DE is parallel to AB, the corresponding angles are equal.

In triangle CDE and triangle CAB:

- Angle at C is common.

- Angle at D corresponds to angle at A, and angle at E corresponds to angle at B.

Since DE || AB, angles at D and A are equal, and angles at E and B are equal.

Therefore, by AA similarity, triangles CDE and CAB are similar.

Therefore, the ratio of similarity is CD / CB = 3k / k = 3.

Therefore, area ratio is 3^2 = 9.

Therefore, area of CDE should be 9 * area of CAB.

But area of CAB is 6, so area of CDE is 54.

But earlier, using base and height, and shoelace, I got 18.

So, now I have a contradiction. Which one is correct?

Wait, maybe the problem is that triangle CAB and CDE are not similar in the way I thought.

Wait, triangle CAB is triangle C, A, B.

Triangle CDE is triangle C, D, E.

But point E is not the image of point A after scaling. It's a different point.

Wait, let me think about the coordinates.

Point C: (k,0)

Point A: (a,b)

Point B: (0,0)

Point D: (4k,0)

Point E: (4k - a, -b)

So, triangle CDE has coordinates (k,0), (4k,0), (4k - a, -b)

Triangle CAB has coordinates (k,0), (a,b), (0,0)

So, if we consider triangle CAB, it's from (k,0) to (a,b) to (0,0). Triangle CDE is from (k,0) to (4k,0) to (4k - a, -b).

Is there a scaling factor from CAB to CDE?

Let me see.

If we scale CAB by factor 3, centered at point C.

Scaling point A (a,b) by factor 3 from point C (k,0):

New coordinates: (k + 3(a - k), 0 + 3(b - 0)) = (3a - 2k, 3b)

But point D is at (4k,0), which is not (3a - 2k, 3b) unless 3a - 2k = 4k and 3b = 0, which would mean a = 2k and b=0, but b=0 would make ABC degenerate. So, scaling doesn't work here.

Alternatively, maybe translation?

If we translate triangle CAB such that point C maps to itself, then we need to map A to D and B to E.

So, vector from C to A is (a - k, b - 0) = (a - k, b)

If we apply the same vector to point D, which is (4k, 0), we get (4k + a - k, 0 + b) = (3k + a, b). But point E is at (4k - a, -b). So, unless 3k + a = 4k - a and b = -b, which would mean a = k/2 and b=0, but again, b=0 would degenerate triangle.

So, translation doesn't work either.

Hmm, so maybe the triangles are not similar after all.

Wait, but the AA similarity condition was satisfied because of the parallel lines. So, angles at C, D, and E should correspond to angles at C, A, and B.

Wait, angle at C is common. Angle at D in CDE corresponds to angle at A in CAB because DE || AB, so the corresponding angles are equal.

Similarly, angle at E in CDE corresponds to angle at B in CAB.

So, triangles CDE and CAB are similar with similarity ratio equal to CD / CB = 3k / k = 3.

Therefore, area should be 9 times, so 54.

But then why does shoelace formula give 18?

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the shoelace formula.

Wait, let me recalculate the shoelace formula carefully.

Points of triangle CDE:

C: (k,0)

D: (4k,0)

E: (4k - a, -b)

Back to C: (k,0)

Compute terms:

First term: x_C * y_D - x_D * y_C = k*0 - 4k*0 = 0 - 0 = 0

Second term: x_D * y_E - x_E * y_D = 4k*(-b) - (4k - a)*0 = -4k b - 0 = -4k b

Third term: x_E * y_C - x_C * y_E = (4k - a)*0 - k*(-b) = 0 + k b = k b

Sum: 0 + (-4k b) + (k b) = (-4k b + k b) = -3k b

Absolute value: | -3k b | = 3k b

Area = (1/2)*3k b = (3/2)k b

Given that k b = 12, area is (3/2)*12 = 18

So, that's correct.

But similarity suggests 54.

Wait, maybe the problem is that triangle CDE is not similar to CAB, but triangle CDE is similar to another triangle.

Wait, perhaps triangle CDE is similar to triangle CBA instead?

Wait, triangle CBA is triangle C, B, A.

Points: C(k,0), B(0,0), A(a,b)

Triangle CDE is triangle C(k,0), D(4k,0), E(4k - a, -b)

Are these similar?

Let me check angles.

Angle at C is same for both.

Angle at D in CDE corresponds to angle at B in CBA.

Angle at E in CDE corresponds to angle at A in CBA.

Therefore, triangles CDE and CBA are similar as well.

So, triangle CDE ~ triangle CBA with ratio CD / CB = 3:1.

Therefore, area ratio is 9:1, so area of CDE is 9*area of CBA.

But area of CBA is same as area of ABC, which is 6, so area of CDE should be 54.

But that contradicts shoelace formula.

Wait, hold on, in triangle CBA, points are C(k,0), B(0,0), A(a,b). So, area is (1/2)| (k*0 - 0*0) + (0*b - a*0) + (a*0 - k*b) | = (1/2)|0 + 0 - k b| = (1/2)| -k b | = (1/2)k b = 6, so k b = 12.

In triangle CDE, points are C(k,0), D(4k,0), E(4k - a, -b). So, area is 18 as calculated.

But according to similarity, area should be 54.

Wait, unless triangle CDE is being counted in a different orientation.

Wait, hold on, triangle CDE's area is 18, but triangle CBA is 6, so ratio is 3, not 9.

Hmm, so similarity ratio is 3, but why?

Wait, perhaps the ratio is not 3:1, but 3: something else.

Wait, in triangle CDE and triangle CBA, the ratio of sides CD / CB = 3k / k = 3.

But in triangle CDE, DE corresponds to BA.

Wait, BA is from B(0,0) to A(a,b), which has length sqrt(a² + b²).

DE is from D(4k,0) to E(4k - a, -b), which has length sqrt( (-a)² + (-b)^2 ) = sqrt(a² + b² ), same as BA.

So, DE = BA.

So, if in triangle CDE, side DE is equal to BA, but in triangle CBA, side BA is same as DE.

So, the ratio is 1:1.

Wait, so sides are not scaled, so similarity ratio is 1, so area should be same.

But that contradicts.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me use vectors.

Vector CB is from C to B: ( -k, 0 )

Vector CD is from C to D: ( 3k, 0 )

So, vector CD = 3*(vector CB)

Similarly, vector DE is from D to E: ( -a, -b )

Vector BA is from B to A: ( a, b )

So, vector DE = -1*(vector BA)

So, vector DE is -1 times vector BA.

So, the transformation from triangle CBA to CDE is a scaling by 3 in the CB direction and a reflection and scaling in BA direction. Not a uniform scaling, so similarity doesn't hold.

Therefore, triangle CDE is not similar to triangle CBA.

Therefore, my earlier assumption about similarity was incorrect.

Thus, the area should be 18, as per shoelace and base-height.

But then why did I think similarity suggested 54?

Because I thought DE is parallel to AB, so triangles are similar, but that's not the case since the scaling factors in different directions are not consistent.

Therefore, the correct area is 18.

Wait, but let me think again.

If DE is parallel to AB, then the ratio of areas should be the ratio of heights.

Wait, if DE is parallel to AB, then the distance between DE and AB is the height difference, but since DE is below AB, the total area would be scaled by some factor based on the distance.

But in our case, triangle CDE is not a simple scaled version of ABC, because the base is scaled by 3, but the height is same, so area is tripled? Wait, no, the base is 3 times, but the height is same as ABC, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, in ABC, base BC is k, height is b.

In CDE, base CD is 3k, height is | -b | = b.

So, area is (1/2)*3k*b = (3/2)*k*b = (3/2)*12 = 18.

So, that's consistent.

So, maybe my initial thought about similarity was wrong because the triangles are not similar, only the lines are parallel.

Therefore, the correct area is 18.

So, the answer is 18.

**Final Answer**
The area of triangle CDE is \boxed{18} square centimeters.
</think>

Given that the area of triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is 6 square centimeters, and \( \overline{AB} \parallel \overline{DE} \). We know that \( BD = 4BC \). We need to find the area of \( \triangle CDE \).

1. **Assigning Coordinates:**
   - Place point \( B \) at \( (0, 0) \).
   - Let point \( C \) be at \( (k, 0) \) on the x-axis.
   - Let point \( A \) be at \( (a, b) \).
   - Since \( BD = 4BC \), point \( D \) is at \( (4k, 0) \).

2. **Area of \( \triangle ABC \):**
   - The area of \( \triangle ABC \) is given by:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |kb| = 6 \implies kb = 12
     \]

3. **Coordinates of Point \( E \):**
   - Since \( \overline{AB} \parallel \overline{DE} \), the slope of \( AB \) must equal the slope of \( DE \).
   - The coordinates of point \( E \) are \( (4k - a, -b) \).

4. **Area of \( \triangle CDE \) Using Shoelace Formula:**
   - Points of \( \triangle CDE \) are \( C(k, 0) \), \( D(4k, 0) \), and \( E(4k - a, -b) \).
   - Using the shoelace formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| k \cdot 0 + 4k \cdot (-b) + (4k - a) \cdot 0 - (4k \cdot 0 + (4k - a) \cdot 0 + k \cdot (-b)) \right|
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 4kb + 0 - 0 - 0 + kb \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -3kb \right| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3kb = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 12 = 18
     \]

Thus, the area of \( \triangle CDE \) is \(\boxed{18}\) square centimeters.
