Question:
A steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from the corners of a cube that has the shortest possible side lengths. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the cube?

Correct Answer:
A sphere with a 3-inch radius has a 6-inch diameter and can be inscribed in a cube with at least side length 6.  Thus the smallest possible cube has side length 6 and volume $6^3=\boxed{216}$ cubic inches.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this problem here: there's a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius that's made by removing metal from the corners of a cube with the shortest possible side lengths. I need to find the volume of the cube in cubic inches. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, let me visualize the problem. We have a cube, and from each corner of this cube, some metal is removed. The result of that is a sphere that fits perfectly inside the cube. The sphere has a radius of 3 inches, which means its diameter is 6 inches. Since the sphere is perfectly inscribed in the cube, the diameter of the sphere should be equal to the side length of the cube.

Wait, hold on. Is that right? So if the sphere is inscribed in the cube, the sphere touches the cube exactly at the centers of each face of the cube. That makes sense because an inscribed sphere (or insphere) in a cube touches the cube at the centers of each face. So the diameter of the sphere should be equal to the edge length of the cube.

But hold on, is the sphere being made by removing metal from the cube? So the sphere is created by cutting off the corners of the cube. That seems a bit counterintuitive because typically, when you inscribe a sphere within a cube, the sphere is perfectly snug inside without needing to remove anything. But here, the sphere is formed by truncating the cube's corners.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the sphere is the result after the corners have been cut off, which effectively turns the cube into a shape known as a truncated cube or a cubeoctahedron. But wait, is that correct? Or is it a sphere?

Wait, no. If you remove metal from the corners of a cube, you're truncating those corners, which changes the shape of the cube. Each corner is replaced by a small face, typically a triangle if you truncate just enough to make it a smooth surface. However, in this problem, the sphere is the result of removing metal, so the sphere is inscribed within the cube.

Wait, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube, meaning it's the largest possible sphere that can fit inside the cube without any truncation. But if that's the case, then the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. So the edge length would be 6 inches, and the volume would be 6³, which is 216 cubic inches.

But then, why is the problem mentioning that we remove metal from the cube's corners? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the process. If we remove metal from the corners, we are turning the cube into something else, not necessarily a sphere. So perhaps the sphere is the remaining part after all the corners are removed?

Wait, that seems more likely. So the sphere is the part of the cube that remains after the corners have been cut off. So the sphere is entirely contained within the cube, but it's not touching the original cube's faces or edges because we've removed the corners.

But how does that work? If you remove the corners, you create new faces on the cube, but the original sphere is inside the cube. So maybe the sphere is the part that's left after truncation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this. If we have a cube, and we truncate each corner, we're cutting off each corner with a plane. The truncation removes a small octahedral portion from each corner. The sphere is what remains after all these truncations.

But in order for the sphere to fit perfectly within the cube after the truncations, the truncation must be such that the sphere touches the cube's faces at certain points.

Wait, I might need to think about the relationship between the sphere and the cube after truncation. In this case, the sphere is inscribed in the original cube, but after truncation, the sphere is tangent to the cube's original edges or faces?

Wait, maybe another approach. If the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube's corners, then the sphere is the intersection of the cube and the regions that remain after the corners are removed. So, perhaps, the sphere is the largest possible sphere that can fit inside the cube without intersecting the truncated parts.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should try to find the relationship between the sphere and the cube. If the sphere is inside the cube, touching it at some points, then the radius of the sphere relates to the cube's edge length.

Wait, maybe the sphere is inscribed in the cube, meaning that the sphere touches the centers of each face of the cube. If that's the case, then the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube.

So, if the radius is 3 inches, the diameter is 6 inches, so the edge length of the cube is 6 inches. Therefore, the volume is 6³, which is 216 cubic inches.

But then, why does the problem mention removing metal from the cube's corners? If it's just a sphere inscribed in the cube, then we don't need to remove the corners. Maybe the sphere is the part that's left after removing the corners, but it's still inscribed.

Wait, maybe it's not an inscribed sphere. Maybe the sphere is tangent to the edges of the cube. If that's the case, then the diameter of the sphere would relate differently to the cube's edge length.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere is inscribed such that it touches the original cube's edges, not the centers of the faces. So, in that case, the diameter of the sphere would be equal to the edge length of the cube divided by sqrt(3). Wait, no, maybe not.

Wait, let me think in terms of the cube's geometry. If we have a cube with edge length 'a', and we inscribe a sphere inside it, the sphere touches the centers of each face. So, the radius of the sphere would be a/2, and the diameter a. So, if the sphere has a radius of 3, then a = 6.

But in this problem, we're removing metal from the cube's corners, which changes the shape. So, perhaps the sphere is not inscribed in the original cube, but in some modified cube.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the cube after truncation. When you truncate a cube, you end up with a truncated cube, which has both triangular and square faces. But in this case, the sphere is formed by removing metal, so perhaps the sphere is the remaining part after the corners are cut off.

Alternatively, maybe the sphere is the dual polyhedron of the cube after truncation, but that might be overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the sphere is the largest sphere that can fit inside the cube without intersecting the truncated parts, so the sphere is tangent to the cube's original edges.

Wait, let's try to figure this out.

When you truncate a cube's corners, you're essentially cutting off each corner at some distance from the original vertex. The truncation depth determines how much of the cube's corners are removed. The sphere that's left is the region inside the cube that's farther away from all the original vertices.

So, the sphere must be entirely inside the cube, and it's the set of points inside the cube that are at least a certain distance away from all the original vertices.

So, the sphere must fit within the cube such that every point on the sphere is at least some distance from the cube's vertices. Therefore, the sphere is the intersection of the cube and all regions outside the spheres centered at each vertex with radius equal to the truncation distance.

Wait, that's a bit abstract. Maybe another way: the maximum sphere that can fit inside the cube without intersecting the truncated corners would have its surface touching the centers of the cube's original edges.

Wait, let me think. If you have a cube with edge length 'a', and you truncate each corner such that the sphere inscribed in the truncated cube touches the centers of the original cube's edges.

In that case, the radius of the sphere would be equal to half the edge length of the original cube divided by sqrt(2), because the center of an edge is at a distance of (a/2)/sqrt(2) from the corner.

Wait, maybe.

Wait, let's imagine a cube with edge length 'a'. The center of each edge is at a distance of a/2 from each adjacent vertex. If we consider the distance from the corner to the center of an edge, it's a/2 along one axis.

But in 3D, the distance from a corner to the center of an edge is sqrt( (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 + 0^2 ) = (a/2)sqrt(2).

Wait, no, the center of the edge is only in two dimensions from the corner. Wait, in a cube, each edge is connected to two vertices. The center of the edge is at (a/2, a/2, 0) if we take the origin at a corner.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let's parameterize.

Suppose we have a cube with edge length 'a'. Each corner is at a point (0,0,0), (a,0,0), (0,a,0), etc. The center of an edge is at, say, (a/2, 0, 0). The distance from the corner (0,0,0) to this center is a/2.

But if we're truncating the cube's corners, we're cutting off a corner with a plane. The distance from the original corner to the truncation plane is equal to the radius of the sphere.

Wait, so if we have a sphere inside the cube, the radius of the sphere is equal to the distance from the cube's corner to the truncation plane.

So, if the sphere has a radius of 3 inches, that means each corner is cut off at a distance of 3 inches from the original corner along the space diagonal.

Wait, is that correct? Or is it along the edge?

Wait, no, if you're truncating the corner, the truncation plane is at a certain distance from the original corner along the face diagonals or the space diagonal.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how much you're cutting off.

When you truncate a cube's corner, you're replacing the corner with a new triangular face. The truncation depth 't' is the distance from the original corner to the truncation plane.

In order for the resulting shape to have a sphere inscribed within it, the radius of that sphere must relate to the truncation depth.

Wait, maybe I should look for the relationship between the radius of the inscribed sphere in a truncated cube and the truncation depth.

But I don't remember the exact formula, but maybe I can derive it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler to realize that for the sphere to be entirely inside the cube, the truncation depth must be such that the sphere touches the centers of the cube's original faces.

Wait, but the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube's corners, so the sphere is entirely within the cube, but not necessarily touching the centers of the cube's faces.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the cube that remains after truncating the corners, and that remaining cube is the sphere.

Wait, no, a sphere isn't a cube. So perhaps, the sphere is the part that remains after the corners are removed, but it's not a cube anymore.

Wait, maybe the sphere is the convex hull of the remaining parts of the cube after the corners are removed.

But that's getting too abstract. Maybe I need to model it differently.

Wait, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in such a way that it touches the centers of the cube's original faces. If that's the case, then the radius of the sphere is equal to half the edge length of the cube.

So, if the sphere has a radius of 3 inches, then the edge length of the cube is 6 inches. Therefore, the volume is 6³ = 216 cubic inches.

But why does the problem mention removing metal from the corners? If the sphere is inscribed touching the centers of the faces, then truncating the corners isn't necessary because the sphere is already inscribed without truncation.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again.

"A steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from the corners of a cube that has the shortest possible side lengths. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the cube?"

So, the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube's corners, meaning that the sphere is what's left after the corners are removed. Therefore, the sphere is the remaining part, which is inside the cube but not touching the original cube's faces or edges.

So, in that case, the sphere is entirely within the cube, but it doesn't touch the cube's original faces or edges.

Wait, but how does the sphere relate to the cube? If the sphere is entirely inside the cube and is the result of truncating the cube's corners, then the sphere must fit within the cube such that it doesn't intersect the truncated parts.

But how do we relate the sphere's radius to the cube's edge length?

Wait, maybe the sphere is the largest sphere that can fit inside the cube after truncating its corners. So, the sphere must fit perfectly, touching certain points on the cube.

Wait, perhaps the sphere touches the centers of the cube's original edges.

So, if the sphere is touching the centers of the edges, then the radius of the sphere would be equal to half the edge length of the cube divided by sqrt(2). Because the center of an edge is at a distance of (a/2)/sqrt(2) from the corner.

Wait, let me clarify. If we have a cube with edge length 'a', the distance from a corner to the center of an edge is (a/2)/sqrt(2). So, if the sphere touches the centers of the edges, then the radius of the sphere is (a/2)/sqrt(2).

Given that the radius is 3 inches, we can set up the equation:

3 = (a/2)/sqrt(2)

Solving for 'a':

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2): 3*sqrt(2) = a/2

Multiply both sides by 2: a = 6*sqrt(2)

Therefore, the edge length of the cube is 6*sqrt(2), and the volume is (6*sqrt(2))³.

Calculating that:

First, cube 6: 6³ = 216

Then, cube sqrt(2): (sqrt(2))³ = 2*sqrt(2)

Multiply them together: 216 * 2 * sqrt(2) = 432*sqrt(2)

But wait, that seems complicated, and the problem mentions the shortest possible side lengths. So, perhaps this is not the correct approach.

Alternatively, maybe the sphere touches the centers of the cube's original faces. So, the radius of the sphere is equal to half the edge length of the cube.

So, if the sphere's radius is 3 inches, then the edge length of the cube is 6 inches, making the volume 216 cubic inches.

But in this case, the sphere is inscribed in the cube, touching the centers of each face. But the problem says the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube's corners, so perhaps the sphere is the part left after truncating the cube's corners, but still inscribed.

Wait, if we remove metal from the cube's corners, the remaining shape is a truncated cube, which is a convex polyhedron with both triangular and square faces. The sphere inscribed within this polyhedron would touch the centers of its faces.

But in that case, I think the sphere's radius is related to the edge length of the truncated cube. Hmm, this is getting more complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the sphere is entirely inside the cube, and it's made by removing metal from the cube's corners. So, the cube is the original shape, and the sphere is the remaining part. Therefore, the sphere must fit within the cube such that it doesn't extend beyond any of the original cube's faces.

So, the sphere's diameter cannot exceed the cube's edge length in any direction. Therefore, the sphere's diameter is equal to the cube's edge length.

Thus, if the sphere has a radius of 3 inches, the diameter is 6 inches, so the cube's edge length is 6 inches, and the volume is 6³ = 216 cubic inches.

But then, why does the problem mention removing metal from the cube's corners? If the sphere is just inscribed in the cube, there's no need to remove any corners.

Wait, perhaps the sphere is not inscribed in the original cube but in the truncated cube. So, the cube's corners are removed, creating a new polyhedron, and the sphere is inscribed within this new polyhedron.

Therefore, the sphere is inscribed in the truncated cube, which has a different relationship between its edge length and the sphere's radius.

In that case, we need to relate the radius of the inscribed sphere in a truncated cube to the edge length of the cube before truncation.

Wait, I found a formula online before that relates the inradius of a truncated cube to its original edge length, but I can't recall it exactly. Let me try to derive it.

A truncated cube is an Archimedean solid formed by truncating a cube such that each corner is replaced by a regular triangular face. The original cube has edge length 'a', and the truncation is such that each corner is cut off at a depth 't' from each vertex.

The inradius (radius of the inscribed sphere) of a truncated cube is given by r = t*(sqrt(2) + 2)/2.

Wait, is that right?

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think about the inradius in terms of the edge length of the truncated cube.

Wait, the truncated cube has two types of edges: the original edges of the cube, which are now shortened, and the new edges formed by the truncation.

Wait, actually, when you truncate a cube, each original edge is split into a shorter edge, and each original vertex becomes a new triangular face.

So, in the truncated cube, all edges are of equal length. Let's denote the edge length of the truncated cube as 'b'.

The inradius of the truncated cube is the distance from the center of the cube to the center of each face.

In the case of a truncated cube, there are two types of faces: the original square faces, which have been truncated into smaller squares, and the new triangular faces created by truncation.

Wait, actually, no. When you truncate a cube, all the original square faces become smaller squares, and each original vertex becomes a regular triangle.

So, the truncated cube has 8 triangular faces and 6 octagonal faces? Wait, no, actually, truncating a cube replaces each vertex with a triangular face, so it should have 6 octagonal faces and 8 triangular faces.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me recall: truncating a cube results in a polyhedron known as a truncated cube, which has 8 triangular faces and 6 octagonal faces. So, the inradius would be the distance from the center to the center of each face.

Wait, but the inradius is the same for all faces, meaning that the distance from the center to the center of each triangular face and each octagonal face is equal.

But in reality, the inradius of a truncated cube is the radius of the sphere that is tangent to all its faces, which are of two types: triangles and octagons.

Wait, so the inradius 'r' is the distance from the center to each face.

To find the inradius, we can relate it to the original cube's edge length.

But since we're dealing with the sphere made after truncating the cube's corners, the sphere is inscribed within the truncated cube. So, if the sphere has a radius of 3 inches, then that is equal to the inradius of the truncated cube.

Therefore, we can find the edge length of the truncated cube, and from there, find the original cube's edge length.

Wait, but I need a relationship between the inradius of a truncated cube and its original edge length.

Let me denote the original cube's edge length as 'a' and the truncation depth as 't'.

When you truncate a cube with edge length 'a' by cutting off each corner at a depth 't', the resulting truncated cube has edge length 'b' given by b = a - 2t*sqrt(2). Because each original edge is reduced by twice the truncation depth times sqrt(2), which accounts for the diagonal cut.

But also, the inradius 'r' of the truncated cube is related to the edge length 'b' by the formula:

r = (b * sqrt(2))/2

Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

Wait, no, that might not be the case. The inradius of a truncated cube can be calculated as follows.

In a truncated cube, all edges are equal, and the inradius is the distance from the center to the middle of each face.

For a truncated cube with edge length 'b', the inradius 'r' is given by:

r = (b * sqrt(2 + sqrt(2)))/2

Wait, I think that's the formula for the inradius in terms of the edge length.

Wait, let me verify.

Wait, no, actually, I think it's:

For a truncated cube, the inradius is r = (b * (1 + sqrt(2)))/2

Wait, perhaps I should look this up, but since I can't, I'll try to derive it.

Consider a truncated cube. Each face is either an octagon or a triangle.

The inradius is the distance from the center to the face.

For a triangular face, the distance from the center to the face can be found using the formula for a regular tetrahedron, but since it's part of a cube, it's different.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use coordinates.

Let me place the truncated cube in a coordinate system with its center at the origin.

The vertices of the truncated cube can be given as combinations of (±(1 + t), ±(1 - t), ±(1 - t)) where 't' is the truncation parameter.

Wait, maybe that's not the right parametrization.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the relationship between the original cube and the truncated cube.

Wait, let me denote the original cube's edge length as 'a'. When we truncate each corner, we cut off a small octahedron from each corner. The truncation depth 't' is such that the distance from the original vertex to the truncation plane is 't'.

In the process, each original edge is shortened by 2t, and each original face becomes a smaller square.

Wait, no, in 3D, truncating a cube's corner affects three edges meeting at that corner.

Each original edge is truncated at both ends, so the original edge length 'a' becomes a new edge of length 'a - 2t'.

But in the case of a cube, all edges are equivalent, so this applies uniformly.

But how does this relate to the inradius?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the inradius of the truncated cube in terms of the original cube.

Wait, when you truncate a cube, the inradius of the resulting truncated cube is equal to the original inradius minus the truncation depth times some factor.

Wait, the original cube doesn't have an inscribed sphere unless it's already a sphere, which it's not. So, perhaps that approach isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to relate the inradius to the original cube, I should focus on the fact that the sphere is made by truncating the cube's corners, so the sphere must fit within the remaining structure.

Wait, but if the sphere is inside the truncated cube, its radius is the inradius of the truncated cube, which depends on the edge length of the truncated cube.

So, if the sphere has a radius of 3 inches, that is the inradius of the truncated cube, so we can solve for the edge length 'b' of the truncated cube.

Once we have 'b', we can find the original cube's edge length 'a' because truncation removes parts from each corner.

But the relationship between 'a' and 'b' is such that b = a - 2t*sqrt(3), but I'm not sure.

Wait, actually, the edge length of the truncated cube 'b' is related to the original cube's edge length 'a' and the truncation depth 't' as follows:

Each original edge of length 'a' is truncated by 't' from both ends, so the remaining length is a - 2t. However, in a cube, the edges are connected at the vertices, so when you truncate each vertex, you also create new edges.

Wait, perhaps the edge length 'b' of the truncated cube is related to the original edge length 'a' by the formula:

b = a - 2t*sqrt(3)

Wait, no, that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the relationship between the original cube and the truncated cube in terms of their inradius.

Wait, the original cube's inradius is a/2, but it doesn't have an inscribed sphere unless it's a sphere. So, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, for the truncated cube, the inradius is given by r = (b * sqrt(2))/2, where 'b' is the edge length.

Wait, let me test that.

If the truncated cube has edge length 'b', then its inradius is (b * sqrt(2))/2.

Wait, but if the sphere has a radius of 3 inches, then:

3 = (b * sqrt(2))/2

Solving for 'b':

b = (3 * 2)/sqrt(2) = 6/sqrt(2) = 3*sqrt(2)

So, the edge length of the truncated cube is 3*sqrt(2).

But then, how does the original cube's edge length relate to the truncated cube's edge length?

Wait, when you truncate a cube, the original edge length 'a' is related to the truncated edge length 'b' by the formula:

a = b + 2t*sqrt(3)

Wait, no, perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the original cube's edge length being the edge length of the truncated cube plus twice the truncation depth times sqrt(3). But I'm not sure.

Wait, actually, in truncating each corner, each original edge is split into three parts: the middle part becomes a new edge of the truncated cube, and the two truncated parts are removed.

Wait, no, in 3D, truncating a corner affects three edges meeting at that corner. Each original edge is truncated at both ends, so the original edge length 'a' is reduced by twice the truncation depth 't'.

But in the case of a cube, the original edges are being truncated at both ends, so the remaining length of each original edge is a - 2t.

But in the truncated cube, there are two types of edges: the original edges (now shorter) and the new edges formed by truncation.

Wait, actually, in a truncated cube, all edges are the same length. So, the original edges are truncated, and the new edges created by truncation are also of the same length.

Therefore, the edge length 'b' of the truncated cube is equal to the remaining length of the original edges, which is a - 2t.

But also, the new edges formed by truncation are equal in length to 'b'.

Wait, but in reality, the edges formed by truncation are longer because they connect the new triangular faces to the original faces.

Wait, no, in the case of a truncated cube, all edges are of equal length.

So, if the original cube has edge length 'a', and the truncation depth is 't', then the edge length of the truncated cube is b = a - 2t*sqrt(3).

Wait, why sqrt(3)? Because the truncation occurs along the space diagonal.

Wait, maybe I should think about the truncation in terms of the face diagonals.

Wait, no, actually, the truncation depth 't' is the distance from the original vertex to the truncation plane.

In a cube, truncating a corner at a distance 't' along each of the three edges meeting at that corner will create a new triangular face.

The edge length 'b' of the truncated cube is related to 't' as follows:

Each original edge is truncated by a distance 't' at both ends, so the remaining length is a - 2t.

But also, the edges of the new triangular faces are equal to the distance between two truncation planes on adjacent edges.

Wait, in the plane of the triangular face, the edges are the distances between the truncation points on adjacent original edges.

Since each truncation removes a length 't' from each original edge, the distance between two truncation points on adjacent edges is sqrt(t² + t²) = t*sqrt(2).

Wait, that's the length of the edge of the triangular face.

So, in the truncated cube, there are two types of edges: the original edges, now of length a - 2t, and the new edges, which are the edges of the triangular faces, of length t*sqrt(2).

But in a truncated cube, all edges are of equal length, so we must have:

a - 2t = t*sqrt(2)

Therefore, we can solve for 't' in terms of 'a':

a = 2t + t*sqrt(2) = t*(2 + sqrt(2))

So, t = a / (2 + sqrt(2))

Then, the edge length of the truncated cube is:

b = a - 2t = a - 2*(a / (2 + sqrt(2))) = a*(1 - 2 / (2 + sqrt(2)))

Simplify that:

First, compute 2 / (2 + sqrt(2)):

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - sqrt(2)):

2*(2 - sqrt(2)) / [(2 + sqrt(2))(2 - sqrt(2))] = (4 - 2*sqrt(2))/(4 - 2) = (4 - 2*sqrt(2))/2 = 2 - sqrt(2)

Therefore, 2 / (2 + sqrt(2)) = 2 - sqrt(2)

So, plugging back into b:

b = a*(1 - (2 - sqrt(2))) = a*(1 - 2 + sqrt(2)) = a*(-1 + sqrt(2)) = a*(sqrt(2) - 1)

Therefore, the edge length of the truncated cube is b = a*(sqrt(2) - 1)

But we also know that the inradius of the truncated cube is 3 inches. So, we can find 'b' in terms of the inradius.

Earlier, I thought that r = (b * sqrt(2))/2, but let's verify.

Wait, actually, the inradius of a truncated cube can be found using the formula:

r = (b * sqrt(2))/2

But let me check that.

Wait, in a truncated cube, the inradius is the distance from the center to the center of a face.

For a triangular face, the distance from the center to the face is r = (b * sqrt(6))/6

Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, let me consider the coordinates of the truncated cube.

If the original cube has edge length 'a', and the truncated cube has edge length 'b', then the inradius can be calculated based on the geometry.

Wait, perhaps the inradius is equal to the distance from the center to the center of a face.

For a triangular face, the center is located at a distance of (b * sqrt(6))/6 from the center of the cube.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to calculate it.

Wait, the inradius is the radius of the sphere that is tangent to all the faces of the truncated cube.

Given that all faces are either triangles or squares, the inradius must be equal for all.

Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to use the formula for inradius of a truncated cube.

Upon checking (mentally), the inradius 'r' of a truncated cube with edge length 'b' is:

r = (b * sqrt(2))/2

So, if r = 3 inches, then:

3 = (b * sqrt(2))/2

So, solving for 'b':

b = (3 * 2)/sqrt(2) = 6/sqrt(2) = 3*sqrt(2)

Therefore, the edge length of the truncated cube is 3*sqrt(2) inches.

But earlier, we found that b = a*(sqrt(2) - 1), where 'a' is the original cube's edge length.

So, plugging in b = 3*sqrt(2):

3*sqrt(2) = a*(sqrt(2) - 1)

Therefore, solving for 'a':

a = (3*sqrt(2)) / (sqrt(2) - 1)

To rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(2) + 1):

a = [3*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) + 1)] / [(sqrt(2) - 1)(sqrt(2) + 1)] = [3*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) + 1)] / (2 - 1) = [3*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) + 1)] / 1

Simplify numerator:

3*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) + 3*sqrt(2)*1 = 3*2 + 3*sqrt(2) = 6 + 3*sqrt(2)

Therefore, the original cube's edge length is a = 6 + 3*sqrt(2) inches.

Thus, the volume of the original cube is a³ = (6 + 3*sqrt(2))³

Wait, that seems complicated, but let's compute it step by step.

First, let me write a = 6 + 3*sqrt(2) = 3*(2 + sqrt(2))

Therefore, a³ = [3*(2 + sqrt(2))]³ = 27*(2 + sqrt(2))³

Now, let's compute (2 + sqrt(2))³.

First, compute (2 + sqrt(2))²:

(2 + sqrt(2))² = 4 + 4*sqrt(2) + 2 = 6 + 4*sqrt(2)

Then, multiply by (2 + sqrt(2)) again:

(6 + 4*sqrt(2))*(2 + sqrt(2)) = 6*2 + 6*sqrt(2) + 4*sqrt(2)*2 + 4*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)

Simplify each term:

6*2 = 12

6*sqrt(2) = 6*sqrt(2)

4*sqrt(2)*2 = 8*sqrt(2)

4*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 4*(2) = 8

Now, add them all together:

12 + 6*sqrt(2) + 8*sqrt(2) + 8 = (12 + 8) + (6*sqrt(2) + 8*sqrt(2)) = 20 + 14*sqrt(2)

Therefore, (2 + sqrt(2))³ = 20 + 14*sqrt(2)

Thus, a³ = 27*(20 + 14*sqrt(2)) = 27*20 + 27*14*sqrt(2) = 540 + 378*sqrt(2)

So, the volume of the original cube is 540 + 378*sqrt(2) cubic inches.

Wait, that seems quite large. Let me check my steps again.

Earlier, we found that b = 3*sqrt(2) inches, which is the edge length of the truncated cube. Then, we related b to the original cube's edge length 'a' via b = a*(sqrt(2) - 1). So, a = b / (sqrt(2) - 1) = 3*sqrt(2)/(sqrt(2) - 1). Then, rationalizing, we got a = 6 + 3*sqrt(2). That seems correct.

Therefore, a = 6 + 3*sqrt(2), so a³ is indeed (6 + 3*sqrt(2))³.

Wait, but let me compute that numerically to see if it makes sense.

First, compute 6 + 3*sqrt(2):

sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142

So, 3*sqrt(2) ≈ 4.2426

Therefore, 6 + 4.2426 ≈ 10.2426 inches

So, the original cube's edge length is approximately 10.2426 inches.

Then, the volume is (10.2426)³ ≈ 10.2426 * 10.2426 * 10.2426

First, compute 10.2426 * 10.2426:

≈ 104.912

Then, multiply by 10.2426:

≈ 104.912 * 10.2426 ≈ 1074.4 cubic inches

But, according to our symbolic computation, the volume is 540 + 378*sqrt(2). Let's compute that numerically:

378*sqrt(2) ≈ 378*1.4142 ≈ 535.4

Then, 540 + 535.4 ≈ 1075.4 cubic inches

So, both methods give approximately 1075 cubic inches, which is consistent.

Therefore, the exact volume is 540 + 378*sqrt(2) cubic inches.

But wait, the problem says the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners of a cube with the shortest possible side lengths. So, if the sphere's radius is 3 inches, then the cube's edge length is 6 inches, so volume is 216 cubic inches. But according to our calculation, it's 540 + 378*sqrt(2), which is much larger.

This discrepancy suggests that perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the sphere is inscribed within the truncated cube, but the cube that remains after truncation is the sphere. But that can't be because a sphere is not a cube.

Alternatively, maybe the steel sphere is the remaining part after truncation, but that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, going back to the problem: "A steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from the corners of a cube that has the shortest possible side lengths. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the cube?"

So, the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube's corners, meaning the cube has had its corners cut off, resulting in a shape that includes the sphere. So, the sphere is inside the cube, which has been truncated.

Therefore, the sphere is inscribed in the truncated cube, so its radius is the inradius of the truncated cube.

So, we have the sphere's radius is 3 inches, which is the inradius of the truncated cube. Therefore, from that, we can find the edge length of the truncated cube, and then relate that to the original cube's edge length.

Earlier, we found that b = 3*sqrt(2) inches, where 'b' is the edge length of the truncated cube. Then, we found that the original cube's edge length 'a' is 6 + 3*sqrt(2) inches.

Hence, the volume of the original cube is (6 + 3*sqrt(2))³, which is approximately 1075 cubic inches.

But wait, that seems like a lot. The sphere's volume is (4/3)*pi*r³ ≈ 113.097 cubic inches. So, the cube's volume is much larger, which makes sense because it's the original cube before truncation.

But in the problem, it says the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube's corners, implying that the sphere is the remaining part. But if the sphere is the remaining part, then the sphere's volume is equal to the cube's volume minus the removed parts.

But in that case, the sphere's volume would be less than the cube's volume. However, our calculation shows that the original cube's volume is much larger than the sphere's volume, which aligns with the idea that the sphere is made by removing parts from the cube.

But I'm getting confused whether the sphere is the inscribed sphere of the truncated cube or the remaining part. If the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube, then the sphere is the part that's left after truncation, which would mean that the sphere's volume is equal to the cube's volume minus the removed parts.

But since the sphere is inscribed within the truncated cube, which is the cube after truncation, then the sphere's volume is the volume of the truncated cube.

Wait, now I'm even more confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube, so the sphere is the part that's left. Therefore, the sphere is the volume of the cube minus the metal removed. So, in this case, the sphere's volume is equal to the cube's volume minus the removed volume.

But we don't know how much volume was removed. So, that approach might not help.

Alternatively, if the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube's corners, which are truncated, then the sphere is inscribed within the resulting truncated cube.

Therefore, the sphere is the inscribed sphere of the truncated cube. So, the sphere's radius is equal to the inradius of the truncated cube.

Hence, the inradius of the truncated cube is 3 inches, so from that, we can find the edge length of the truncated cube, and then find the original cube's edge length.

Which is what we did earlier, resulting in the original cube's edge length being 6 + 3*sqrt(2) inches, and the volume being 540 + 378*sqrt(2) cubic inches.

But let me just confirm this with another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere is the result of truncating the cube, meaning the sphere's diameter is equal to the edge length of the cube. So, if the sphere has a radius of 3, diameter is 6, so edge length is 6, volume 216. But that seems too simplistic, and the problem mentions removing metal from the corners, implying more than just truncating the edges.

Wait, maybe it's a matter of the sphere being the dual polyhedron or something else.

Wait, perhaps the sphere is the dual of the cube, but no, the dual of the cube is the octahedron.

Alternatively, maybe the sphere is the result of the cube being cut by planes tangent to the sphere at the midpoints of each edge.

Wait, that might make sense. If the sphere is tangent to the midpoints of each edge of the cube, then the radius would be equal to half the edge length times sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, let me think.

If the sphere is tangent to the midpoints of each edge of the cube, then the distance from the center of the cube to the midpoint of an edge is equal to the sphere's radius.

In a cube with edge length 'a', the distance from the center to the midpoint of an edge is a/2.

Wait, because the midpoint of an edge is at a distance of a/2 from the center along one axis.

Wait, but the distance from the center to the midpoint of an edge is a/2, so if the sphere is tangent to those midpoints, the radius of the sphere is a/2.

Therefore, if the sphere's radius is 3 inches, then a/2 = 3, so a = 6 inches, and the volume is 216 cubic inches.

But then, what does removing metal from the cube's corners have to do with this? If the sphere is already inscribed in the cube, there's no need to remove metal. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the sphere is the dual of the cube, but scaled somehow. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube after the cube has been truncated such that the sphere touches both the original faces and the new truncated faces.

Wait, but how would that work? The sphere would have to be tangent to both the original cube's faces and the new faces created by truncation.

In that case, the sphere would be the inscribed sphere of the truncated cube.

So, going back, if the sphere is inscribed in the truncated cube, then its radius is equal to the inradius of the truncated cube.

From our earlier calculations, that gives us the original cube's edge length as 6 + 3*sqrt(2), resulting in a volume of 540 + 378*sqrt(2). But that seems quite a large volume, and the problem says the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube's corners, so perhaps that is correct.

But another way to think about it is that after truncating the cube, the resulting shape has an inscribed sphere of radius 3 inches.

So, in that case, the inradius of the truncated cube is 3 inches, which gives us the edge length of the truncated cube, which relates back to the original cube's edge length.

Therefore, after working through the relationships, I think the original cube's edge length is 6 + 3*sqrt(2), and thus, the volume is (6 + 3*sqrt(2))³, which is 540 + 378*sqrt(2) cubic inches.

But to make sure, let me compute 540 + 378*sqrt(2):

sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142

378*1.4142 ≈ 378*1.4142 ≈ 535.4

So, total volume ≈ 540 + 535.4 ≈ 1075.4 cubic inches.

Alternatively, the exact value is 540 + 378*sqrt(2), which is the exact form.

Therefore, I think that is the answer.

**Final Answer**
The volume of the cube is \boxed{540 + 378\sqrt{2}} cubic inches.
</think>

To solve the problem of finding the volume of the cube from which a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from the corners, we need to consider the relationship between the sphere and the cube.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The steel sphere is made by removing metal from the corners of a cube, resulting in a truncated cube.
   - The sphere is inscribed within the truncated cube, meaning it is tangent to all the faces of the truncated cube.

2. **Inradius of the Truncated Cube**:
   - The radius of the inscribed sphere (inradius) of the truncated cube is given as 3 inches.
   - The inradius \( r \) of a truncated cube with edge length \( b \) is given by the formula:
     \[
     r = \frac{b \sqrt{2}}{2}
     \]
   - Solving for \( b \):
     \[
     3 = \frac{b \sqrt{2}}{2} \implies b = \frac{6}{\sqrt{2}} = 3\sqrt{2}
     \]

3. **Relating the Truncated Cube's Edge Length to the Original Cube**:
   - The edge length \( b \) of the truncated cube is related to the original cube's edge length \( a \) by the formula:
     \[
     b = a (\sqrt{2} - 1)
     \]
   - Solving for \( a \):
     \[
     3\sqrt{2} = a (\sqrt{2} - 1) \implies a = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} - 1}
     \]
   - Rationalizing the denominator:
     \[
     a = \frac{3\sqrt{2} (\sqrt{2} + 1)}{(\sqrt{2} - 1)(\sqrt{2} + 1)} = 3\sqrt{2} (\sqrt{2} + 1) = 6 + 3\sqrt{2}
     \]

4. **Volume of the Original Cube**:
   - The edge length of the original cube is \( 6 + 3\sqrt{2} \) inches.
   - The volume \( V \) of the original cube is:
     \[
     V = (6 + 3\sqrt{2})^3
     \]
   - Expanding the cube:
     \[
     (6 + 3\sqrt{2})^3 = 6^3 + 3 \cdot 6^2 \cdot 3\sqrt{2} + 3 \cdot 6 \cdot (3\sqrt{2})^2 + (3\sqrt{2})^3
     \]
     \[
     = 216 + 324\sqrt{2} + 324 + 162\sqrt{2}
     \]
     \[
     = 540 + 378\sqrt{2}
     \]

Thus, the volume of the cube is \(\boxed{540 + 378\sqrt{2}}\) cubic inches.
