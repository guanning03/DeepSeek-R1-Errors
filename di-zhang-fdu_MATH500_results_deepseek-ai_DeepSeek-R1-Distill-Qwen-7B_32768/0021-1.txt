Question:
Find all the integer roots of
\[x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0.\]Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
By the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots are all the divisors of 14 (including negative divisors), which are $-14,$ $-7,$ $-2,$ $-1,$ $1,$ $2,$ $7,$ and $14.$  Checking, we find that the only integer roots are $\boxed{-2,1}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this equation: \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\), and I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, integer roots... I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Maybe I should start by recalling that. 

The Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) is a factor of the constant term and \(q\) is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -14, and the leading coefficient is 1. So that simplifies things because the possible rational roots are just the factors of -14. 

So, the factors of -14 are \(\pm1, \pm2, \pm7, \pm14\). These are all the potential integer roots since the leading coefficient is 1, so \(q\) would be 1, making all possible roots integers. 

Alright, so my plan is to test each of these possible roots by substituting them into the equation and seeing if the equation equals zero.

Let me list the possible roots again: 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14.

Starting with \(x = 1\):
\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14\)
= \(1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14\)
= \(15 - 15\)
= 0. 

Oh, that worked! So, 1 is a root. Cool. That means \((x - 1)\) is a factor of the polynomial. 

Now, I need to factor this polynomial. Since I know that \(x - 1\) is a factor, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \(x - 1\) and find the quotient polynomial. That might help me find the other roots.

Let me try synthetic division with root 1.

Set up the coefficients: 1 (for \(x^4\)), 5 (for \(x^3\)), 9 (for \(x^2\)), -1 (for \(x\)), and -14 (constant term).

Bring down the first coefficient: 1.

Multiply 1 by 1: 1. Add to the next coefficient: 5 + 1 = 6.

Multiply 6 by 1: 6. Add to the next coefficient: 9 + 6 = 15.

Multiply 15 by 1: 15. Add to the next coefficient: -1 + 15 = 14.

Multiply 14 by 1: 14. Add to the constant term: -14 + 14 = 0. Perfect, no remainder.

So, the quotient polynomial is \(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\).

Now, I need to factor this cubic polynomial: \(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\).

Again, maybe I can apply the Rational Root Theorem here. The constant term is 14, leading coefficient is 1, so possible roots are \(\pm1, \pm2, \pm7, \pm14\).

Let me test these:

First, \(x = -1\):
\((-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 15(-1) + 14\)
= \(-1 + 6 - 15 + 14\)
= \( ( -1 + 6 ) + ( -15 + 14 ) \)
= \(5 - 1 = 4\). Not zero.

Next, \(x = -2\):
\((-2)^3 + 6(-2)^2 + 15(-2) + 14\)
= \(-8 + 24 - 30 + 14\)
= \( ( -8 + 24 ) + ( -30 + 14 ) \)
= \(16 - 16 = 0\).

Great! So, -2 is a root. That means \((x + 2)\) is a factor.

Let's perform synthetic division again on \(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\) with root -2.

Coefficients: 1, 6, 15, 14.

Bring down the first coefficient: 1.

Multiply 1 by -2: -2. Add to next coefficient: 6 + (-2) = 4.

Multiply 4 by -2: -8. Add to next coefficient: 15 + (-8) = 7.

Multiply 7 by -2: -14. Add to constant term: 14 + (-14) = 0.

So, the quotient polynomial is \(x^2 + 4x + 7\).

Now, we have \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = (x - 1)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7)\).

Now, we need to factor \(x^2 + 4x + 7\). Let's see if it can be factored into integers.

The discriminant is \(16 - 28 = -12\). Since it's negative, this quadratic doesn't factor over the real numbers, let alone integers. So, it doesn't have any real roots, let alone integer roots.

Therefore, the only integer roots of the original equation are 1 and -2.

But wait, just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible integer roots. Maybe I should check the other possible roots I listed earlier: 2, -7, 7, 14, -14.

Starting with \(x = 2\):

\(2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14\)
= 16 + 40 + 36 - 2 - 14
= (16 + 40) + (36 - 2) - 14
= 56 + 34 - 14
= 90 - 14
= 76 ≠ 0.

Okay, not a root.

\(x = -7\):

\((-7)^4 + 5(-7)^3 + 9(-7)^2 - (-7) - 14\)
= 2401 + 5(-343) + 9(49) + 7 - 14
= 2401 - 1715 + 441 + 7 - 14
Calculating step by step:
2401 - 1715 = 686
686 + 441 = 1127
1127 + 7 = 1134
1134 - 14 = 1120 ≠ 0.

Not a root.

\(x = 7\):

\(7^4 + 5(7)^3 + 9(7)^2 - 7 - 14\)
= 2401 + 5(343) + 9(49) - 7 - 14
= 2401 + 1715 + 441 - 7 - 14
Again step by step:
2401 + 1715 = 4116
4116 + 441 = 4557
4557 - 7 = 4550
4550 - 14 = 4536 ≠ 0.

Not a root.

\(x = 14\):

This is going to be a huge number, but let's see:

\(14^4 + 5(14)^3 + 9(14)^2 - 14 - 14\)
= 14^4 is 14*14*14*14. 14^2 is 196, so 14^4 is 196^2, which is 38416.

5*(14)^3 = 5*(2744) = 13720.

9*(14)^2 = 9*196 = 1764.

So, adding up: 38416 + 13720 = 52136; 52136 + 1764 = 53900; 53900 -14 -14 = 53900 -28 = 53872 ≠ 0.

Not a root.

\(x = -14\):

This will also be a huge number, but let's calculate it:

\((-14)^4 + 5(-14)^3 + 9(-14)^2 - (-14) -14\)
= 14^4 + 5*(-14)^3 + 9*(14)^2 +14 -14
= 38416 + 5*(-2744) + 1764 + 0
= 38416 -13720 + 1764
Calculating:
38416 -13720 = 24696
24696 + 1764 = 26460 ≠ 0.

So, not a root.

So, none of the other possible roots work. Therefore, the only integer roots are 1 and -2.

But just to be thorough, let me double-check the synthetic divisions to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

First, when I divided by (x - 1):

Coefficients: 1,5,9,-1, -14

Bring down 1.

1*1=1, 5+1=6

6*1=6, 9+6=15

15*1=15, -1 +15=14

14*1=14, -14+14=0.

Looks correct.

Then, dividing \(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\) by (x + 2):

Coefficients:1,6,15,14

Bring down 1.

1*(-2)= -2, 6 + (-2)=4

4*(-2)= -8, 15 + (-8)=7

7*(-2)= -14, 14 + (-14)=0.

Also correct.

So, the quadratic is indeed \(x^2 +4x +7\), which doesn't factor further.

Therefore, the integer roots are 1 and -2.

**Final Answer**
The integer roots are \boxed{1} and \boxed{-2}.
</think>

To find all the integer roots of the equation \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\), we use the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term -14, which are \(\pm1, \pm2, \pm7, \pm14\).

Testing these possible roots:

- For \(x = 1\):
  \[
  1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0
  \]
  So, \(x = 1\) is a root.

Using synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \(x - 1\):

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}
1 & 1 & 5 & 9 & -1 & -14 \\
  &   & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 \\
\hline
  & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

The quotient polynomial is \(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\).

Testing possible roots for the cubic polynomial:

- For \(x = -2\):
  \[
  (-2)^3 + 6(-2)^2 + 15(-2) + 14 = -8 + 24 - 30 + 14 = 0
  \]
  So, \(x = -2\) is a root.

Using synthetic division to divide the cubic polynomial by \(x + 2\):

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
-2 & 1 & 6 & 15 & 14 \\
   &   & -2 & -8 & -14 \\
\hline
   & 1 & 4 & 7 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

The quotient polynomial is \(x^2 + 4x + 7\), which does not factor further over the integers as its discriminant is negative.

Thus, the only integer roots are \(\boxed{1}\) and \(\boxed{-2}\).
