Question:
Let $ABCD$ be a regular tetrahedron with side length 2. The plane parallel to edges $AB$ and $CD$ and lying halfway between them cuts $ABCD$ into two pieces. Find the surface area of one of these pieces.

Correct Answer:
The plane intersects each face of the tetrahedron in a midline of the face; by symmetry it follows that the intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron is a square of side length 1. The surface area of each piece is half the total surface area of the tetrahedron plus the area of the square, that is, $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 4\cdot \frac{2^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}+1=\boxed{1+2\sqrt{3}}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem about a regular tetrahedron, which I know is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD, and each edge has a length of 2 units. The question is about a plane that's parallel to two of its edges, AB and CD, and it's lying halfway between them. This plane cuts the tetrahedron into two pieces, and I need to find the surface area of one of these pieces.

Hmm, let's start by visualizing the tetrahedron. Since it's regular, all edges are equal, so every face is an equilateral triangle with side length 2. I remember that in a regular tetrahedron, any two edges that don't intersect are called skew lines, but in this case, AB and CD are skew lines. The plane that's parallel to both AB and CD and halfway between them should intersect some of the other edges of the tetrahedron.

I think it would help to figure out which edges the plane intersects. If the plane is parallel to AB and CD, it can't intersect AB or CD themselves because it's parallel. So, it must intersect the other edges, which are AC, AD, BC, and BD. I'm not entirely sure, but maybe it intersects each of these edges at some point, creating a smaller shape inside the tetrahedron.

Since the plane is halfway between AB and CD, I wonder if the intersection points divide the edges AC, AD, BC, and BD into equal parts. If the plane is halfway, then each of these edges is cut at their midpoints. So, the intersection points would be the midpoints of AC, AD, BC, and BD.

Wait, if that's the case, then the intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron would form a smaller quadrilateral inside the tetrahedron, connecting these midpoints. That quadrilateral would be a parallelogram because it's formed by lines connecting midpoints of edges, and in a regular tetrahedron, that should maintain parallelism.

But actually, since the plane is parallel to both AB and CD, which are skew lines, the intersection should be a parallelogram. But in a regular tetrahedron, because of the symmetry, it might actually be a square or a rectangle? Hmm, I think it's a parallelogram, but not necessarily a square, because the edges are not all at right angles.

Wait, but in a regular tetrahedron, all edges are the same length, so maybe the sides of the parallelogram are all equal, making it a rhombus. Hmm, is that right? Let's think about the distances. If the plane is halfway between AB and CD, then each side of the parallelogram should be half the length of the edges? Or maybe not, since the edges are in three dimensions.

Wait, maybe I should think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the tetrahedron's vertices could help me better visualize and calculate the necessary lengths.

Let me place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system. I recall that one way to position a regular tetrahedron is to have one vertex at (0,0,0), another at (1,0,0), a third at (1/2, sqrt(3)/2, 0), and the fourth at (1/2, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3). But wait, that's for a tetrahedron with edge length 1. Since we need edge length 2, I should adjust the coordinates accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe I can scale it up. If I take the standard coordinates for a regular tetrahedron with edge length 2, I can assign the vertices as follows:

Let’s denote vertex A at (0,0,0), B at (2,0,0). Then, the other two vertices C and D should be placed such that all edges are length 2. Since it's a regular tetrahedron, the coordinates of C and D can be found by symmetry.

The coordinates for C and D can be determined by considering that in a regular tetrahedron, the distance from the base (triangle ABC) to the apex D is such that all edges are equal. The base triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle with side length 2.

So, the centroid of triangle ABC is at (1, 1/sqrt(3), 0). The height of the tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula for the height of a regular tetrahedron, which is sqrt(2/3) times the edge length. So, height h = sqrt(2/3)*2 = 2*sqrt(6)/3.

Therefore, the coordinates of D would be (1, 1/sqrt(3), 2*sqrt(6)/3).

Wait, let me check that. The centroid of the base triangle ABC is at (1, 1/sqrt(3), 0). The apex D is directly above this point at a height h. So, yes, D is at (1, 1/sqrt(3), h), where h is sqrt(6)/3*2, which is 2*sqrt(6)/3.

So, to recap:

A: (0, 0, 0)

B: (2, 0, 0)

C: (1, sqrt(3), 0)

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. If ABC is an equilateral triangle with side length 2, then the coordinates should be adjusted accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the coordinates. Let me think again. In a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal, so the distance between any two vertices is 2.

Let me place vertex A at (0,0,0). Then, vertex B can be at (2,0,0). To find the coordinates of C, since ABC is an equilateral triangle, point C should be in the xy-plane. The coordinates of C would be (1, sqrt(3), 0). Because the distance from A to C should be 2, so sqrt((1)^2 + (sqrt(3))^2) = sqrt(1 + 3) = 2. Similarly, the distance from B to C is sqrt((2 - 1)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3))^2) = sqrt(1 + 3) = 2. So, yes, that works.

Now, for point D, which is the apex of the tetrahedron. The centroid of the base triangle ABC is at the average of the coordinates of A, B, and C. So, centroid G = ((0 + 2 + 1)/3, (0 + 0 + sqrt(3))/3, (0 + 0 + 0)/3) = (1, sqrt(3)/3, 0). Then, the apex D is directly above G at a height h.

To find h, we can use the fact that the distance from D to any of the base vertices is 2. Let’s calculate the distance from D to A. If D is at (1, sqrt(3)/3, h), then the distance DA is sqrt((1 - 0)^2 + (sqrt(3)/3 - 0)^2 + (h - 0)^2) = sqrt(1 + (1/3) + h^2) = sqrt(4/3 + h^2). We know this distance must be 2, so:

sqrt(4/3 + h^2) = 2

Squaring both sides:

4/3 + h^2 = 4

h^2 = 4 - 4/3 = 8/3

h = sqrt(8/3) = 2*sqrt(6)/3

So, point D is at (1, sqrt(3)/3, 2*sqrt(6)/3).

So, now I have coordinates for all four vertices:

A: (0, 0, 0)

B: (2, 0, 0)

C: (1, sqrt(3), 0)

D: (1, sqrt(3)/3, 2*sqrt(6)/3)

Alright, now I need to find the plane that is parallel to edges AB and CD and lies halfway between them.

First, let's find the parametric equations or direction vectors of edges AB and CD.

Edge AB goes from A(0,0,0) to B(2,0,0). So, its direction vector is (2,0,0) - (0,0,0) = (2,0,0), or simplified, (1,0,0).

Edge CD goes from C(1, sqrt(3), 0) to D(1, sqrt(3)/3, 2*sqrt(6)/3). So, the direction vector is D - C = (1 - 1, sqrt(3)/3 - sqrt(3), 2*sqrt(6)/3 - 0) = (0, -2*sqrt(3)/3, 2*sqrt(6)/3). Hmm, that's a bit complicated.

But the plane is supposed to be parallel to both AB and CD. So, the normal vector of the plane should be perpendicular to both direction vectors of AB and CD.

Wait, but if the plane is parallel to both AB and CD, then the normal vector of the plane is perpendicular to both direction vectors. So, we can find the normal vector by taking the cross product of the direction vectors of AB and CD.

So, direction vector of AB is (1,0,0), and direction vector of CD is (0, -2*sqrt(3)/3, 2*sqrt(6)/3). Let's compute their cross product.

Cross product AB × CD = |i   j   k|
                         |1    0    0|
                         |0  -2√3/3  2√6/3|

Calculating determinant:

i*(0*2√6/3 - 0*(-2√3)/3) - j*(1*2√6/3 - 0*0) + k*(1*(-2√3)/3 - 0*0)

Simplify:

i*(0 - 0) - j*(2√6/3 - 0) + k*(-2√3/3 - 0)

So, cross product is (0, -2√6/3, -2√3/3). This is the normal vector of the plane.

But we can simplify this vector by multiplying by -3 to make it cleaner: (0, 2√6, 2√3). So, the normal vector is proportional to (0, √6, √3). So, the plane equation can be written as √6(y) + √3(z) = d. We need to find d such that the plane is halfway between AB and CD.

Wait, how do we determine the value of d? Since the plane is halfway between AB and CD, which are skew lines, we need to find the distance from the plane to AB and to CD, which should be equal.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find two points on the plane and then define the plane.

But maybe another approach: Since the plane is halfway between AB and CD, and it's parallel to both, it should intersect the other edges at their midpoints. So, as I thought earlier, it intersects AC, AD, BC, and BD at their midpoints.

Wait, let's check that. If the plane is halfway between AB and CD, it's equidistant from both. In a regular tetrahedron, the midpoints of the edges opposite to AB and CD should lie on this plane.

So, the midpoints of AC, AD, BC, and BD. Let me compute these midpoints.

Midpoint of AC: between A(0,0,0) and C(1, sqrt(3), 0). So, midpoint M1 is ((0 + 1)/2, (0 + sqrt(3))/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0).

Midpoint of AD: between A(0,0,0) and D(1, sqrt(3)/3, 2*sqrt(6)/3). Midpoint M2 is ((0 + 1)/2, (0 + sqrt(3)/3)/2, (0 + 2*sqrt(6)/3)/2) = (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3).

Midpoint of BC: between B(2,0,0) and C(1, sqrt(3), 0). Midpoint M3 is ((2 + 1)/2, (0 + sqrt(3))/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0).

Midpoint of BD: between B(2,0,0) and D(1, sqrt(3)/3, 2*sqrt(6)/3). Midpoint M4 is ((2 + 1)/2, (0 + sqrt(3)/3)/2, (0 + 2*sqrt(6)/3)/2) = (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3).

So, if the plane passes through M1, M2, M3, and M4, then it's cutting the tetrahedron into two parts. Since all these midpoints lie on the plane, the plane is halfway between AB and CD.

So, now, the intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron is a quadrilateral connecting these four midpoints. So, the quadrilateral is M1-M2-M4-M3-M1? Wait, no, because M1 is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0), M2 is (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3), M4 is (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3), and M3 is (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0).

Wait, so M1 is on AC, M2 is on AD, M4 is on BD, and M3 is on BC. So, the quadrilateral is M1 connected to M2, M2 connected to M4, M4 connected to M3, and M3 connected back to M1. So, that's the shape.

Now, to find the surface area of one of the pieces. The original tetrahedron has four triangular faces, each with area (sqrt(3)/4)*(2)^2 = sqrt(3). So, each face has area sqrt(3), and the total surface area is 4*sqrt(3). But when we cut the tetrahedron with the plane, we create two new faces on each piece, which are the quadrilateral we just found. So, each piece will have three original triangular faces and one new quadrilateral face. Therefore, the surface area of each piece is the sum of the areas of these three original triangles and the area of the quadrilateral.

But wait, that doesn't sound right. Because each piece is a smaller polyhedron, and the original tetrahedron is being split into two smaller polyhedrons, each of which has some original faces and the new quadrilateral face. So, the surface area of each piece would consist of the areas of the original faces that are now part of the piece, plus the area of the new quadrilateral.

However, I need to make sure whether the plane intersects only four edges, creating a quadrilateral, or if it intersects more edges. But from the midpoints, it seems that it only intersects four edges, creating a quadrilateral. So, each piece will have three original triangular faces and one quadrilateral face.

Wait, but that would mean each piece has four faces: three original ones and one new one. So, the surface area would be 3*sqrt(3) (since each original face has area sqrt(3)) plus the area of the quadrilateral.

But wait, hold on. Because the original tetrahedron has four triangular faces. When we cut it with a plane, each piece will have a portion of the original faces and the new quadrilateral. But actually, only two of the original faces are entirely on one side of the plane, and the other two are split by the plane.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle. If the cutting plane intersects four edges, each face will be intersected by the plane at most once. So, each triangular face will either be entirely on one side of the plane or intersect the plane once, splitting it into a smaller triangle and a quadrilateral.

Wait, but in reality, the plane is intersecting four edges, so each of the four faces adjacent to those edges will be split by the plane.

Wait, hold on. The tetrahedron has four triangular faces. Each face is opposite one vertex. So, cutting the tetrahedron with a plane that is parallel to two edges (AB and CD) and halfway between them would intersect the other four edges (AC, AD, BC, BD) as we've found. So, each of the four faces (ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD) will be split by the plane.

Wait, so each face is a triangle, and the plane intersects each face along a line, splitting the face into two smaller polygons. Therefore, each piece will have some original triangular faces and some new quadrilateral faces.

But this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think about the structure of the resulting pieces.

When you cut a tetrahedron with a plane, the two resulting pieces are smaller polyhedrons, each with a quadrilateral face where the plane cuts through, and some of the original triangular faces.

But in this case, the plane is equidistant from AB and CD, and cuts the tetrahedron into two pieces. Each piece will contain either the vertex A or D, and the other piece will contain the other vertices.

Wait, actually, no. Because the plane is parallel to AB and CD, which are skew lines, it doesn't contain any of the original vertices. So, each piece will have a mix of original vertices and the midpoints.

But perhaps it's better to calculate the areas now.

So, each of the pieces will have three original triangular faces, each with area sqrt(3), and one new quadrilateral face. So, the total surface area would be 3*sqrt(3) + area of quadrilateral.

But wait, actually, that can't be right because the original tetrahedron only has four faces. So, when we cut it, each piece will have some of the original faces and the new quadrilateral. So, one piece will have three original faces and one quadrilateral, and the other piece will have the remaining original face and the same quadrilateral. Wait, but that would mean that the surface area is 3*sqrt(3) + area of quadrilateral for one piece, and sqrt(3) + area of quadrilateral for the other. But that would mean the two pieces have different surface areas, which doesn't make sense because the cut is symmetric.

Wait, no, actually, no. Because the plane is equidistant between AB and CD, so both pieces should be congruent. So, their surface areas should be equal. Therefore, perhaps each piece has two original triangular faces and two quadrilateral faces? Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.

Wait, perhaps each piece is a kind of prism with two triangular faces and two quadrilateral faces? Or maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, no, the original tetrahedron is being cut by a plane, which is not a face, so each resulting piece is a polyhedron with some triangular faces and a new quadrilateral face. But since the cutting plane is equidistant from AB and CD, it's creating two congruent polyhedrons.

Therefore, each piece will have half of the original tetrahedron's volume, and their surface areas should also be equal. So, each piece must have the same surface area.

But how is the surface area divided? The original surface area is 4*sqrt(3). When we cut the tetrahedron, the plane adds a new face (the quadrilateral) to each piece. However, the original faces are split into smaller parts. So, each piece will have some original triangular faces and the new quadrilateral.

Wait, but each triangular face of the original tetrahedron is split by the cutting plane into a smaller triangle and a quadrilateral. So, each original face is split, but each piece will have some of these.

Wait, perhaps each original triangular face is split into two parts, each part belonging to one of the two pieces. Therefore, each piece will have half of each original face's area plus the area of the quadrilateral.

But that would mean each piece has half the surface area of the original tetrahedron plus the area of the quadrilateral. But the original surface area is 4*sqrt(3). So, each piece would have 2*sqrt(3) + area of quadrilateral.

But that seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe each piece only has some of the original faces and the quadrilateral.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of coordinates and compute the area of the quadrilateral.

So, first, let me get the coordinates of the four midpoints:

M1: (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

M2: (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

M3: (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

M4: (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

So, the quadrilateral has vertices M1, M2, M4, M3.

To compute its area, I can use vectors or divide it into triangles.

Alternatively, since it's a parallelogram (because it's formed by midpoints in a tetrahedron), the area can be computed as the magnitude of the cross product of two adjacent sides.

So, let me find vectors M1M2 and M1M3.

Wait, but actually, is it a parallelogram? Let me check.

In the plane, the quadrilateral is determined by the midpoints. Since the plane is halfway between AB and CD, and the edges it intersects are all midpoints, the quadrilateral should be a parallelogram because the midline in a tetrahedron is a parallelogram. So, yeah, it's a parallelogram.

So, in a parallelogram, the area is the magnitude of the cross product of two adjacent sides.

So, let's calculate vectors M1M2 and M1M3.

Wait, but actually, let me correct that: since it's a parallelogram, I can take vectors from M1 to M2 and from M1 to M4, compute their cross product, and take half its magnitude? Wait, no, for a parallelogram, the area is the magnitude of the cross product of two adjacent vectors from the same point.

So, let's take point M1 as the origin for vectors.

Vector M1M2: M2 - M1 = (0.5 - 0.5, sqrt(3)/6 - sqrt(3)/2, sqrt(6)/3 - 0) = (0, -sqrt(3)/3, sqrt(6)/3)

Vector M1M3: M3 - M1 = (1.5 - 0.5, sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2, 0 - 0) = (1, 0, 0)

So, vectors are (0, -sqrt(3)/3, sqrt(6)/3) and (1, 0, 0).

The cross product of these two vectors is:

|i     j         k     |

|0  -sqrt(3)/3 sqrt(6)/3|

|1     0         0     |

Calculating determinant:

i*( (-sqrt(3)/3)*0 - sqrt(6)/3*0 ) - j*(0*0 - sqrt(6)/3*1 ) + k*(0*0 - (-sqrt(3)/3)*1 )

Simplify:

i*(0 - 0) - j*(0 - sqrt(6)/3) + k*(0 + sqrt(3)/3 )

So, cross product is (0, sqrt(6)/3, sqrt(3)/3)

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt( (0)^2 + (sqrt(6)/3)^2 + (sqrt(3)/3)^2 ) = sqrt( (6/9) + (3/9) ) = sqrt(9/9) = sqrt(1) = 1

Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is 1.

So, the quadrilateral face has area 1.

Now, going back to the surface area of one of the pieces. Each piece will have three original triangular faces each of area sqrt(3) and the new quadrilateral face of area 1.

But wait, hold on. Each original triangular face is split by the cutting plane. So, each original face is divided into two parts: a smaller triangle and a quadrilateral. But in reality, the original face is a triangle, so splitting it with a plane (a line) would divide it into a smaller triangle and a quadrilateral.

But in our case, each original face is adjacent to one edge that's intersected by the plane. So, for example, face ABC is adjacent to edge AC, which is intersected at M1 and M2. Wait, actually, no. Face ABC is triangle with vertices A, B, C. The plane intersects edges AC at M1 and BC at M3. So, in face ABC, the plane cuts along the line M1M3.

Similarly, face ABD is triangle with vertices A, B, D. The plane intersects edges AD at M2 and BD at M4. So, in face ABD, the plane cuts along the line M2M4.

Similarly, face ACD is triangle with vertices A, C, D. The plane intersects edges AC at M1 and AD at M2. So, in face ACD, the plane cuts along the line M1M2.

Face BCD is triangle with vertices B, C, D. The plane intersects edges BC at M3 and BD at M4. So, in face BCD, the plane cuts along the line M3M4.

Therefore, each original triangular face is split into two smaller polygons by the cutting plane. Each of these smaller polygons is a triangle or a quadrilateral? Wait, in each face, the plane cuts along a line, so each face is split into two smaller polygons.

But in face ABC, the plane cuts along M1M3, which connects the midpoints of AC and BC. So, in triangle ABC, the line M1M3 is a midline, so it's parallel to AB and half its length. Therefore, it divides ABC into a smaller triangle M1M3C and a trapezoid AM1M3B.

Similarly, in face ABD, the plane cuts along M2M4, which is a midline parallel to AB, dividing ABD into a smaller triangle M2M4D and a trapezoid AM2M4B.

In face ACD, the plane cuts along M1M2, which is a line connecting midpoints of AC and AD, so it's not a midline but a line from (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0) to (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3). Similarly, in face BCD, the plane cuts along M3M4, connecting midpoints of BC and BD.

Therefore, each original face is split into a smaller triangle and a trapezoid. So, each piece of the original tetrahedron will have, for each original face, either the smaller triangle or the trapezoid.

But wait, in reality, each piece will have some of these smaller triangles and trapezoids as their faces. Since the cutting plane is creating a new quadrilateral face on each piece, each piece will have the quadrilateral and some of the original faces.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the area contributed by the original faces to each piece.

Each original face is split into two parts: a smaller triangle and a trapezoid. Since the plane is cutting each face exactly halfway, the area of the smaller triangle is half of the original face's area, and the trapezoid has the other half.

But in reality, since the plane is cutting each face into two regions, each region has half the area of the original face.

Wait, is that true? Because if the plane cuts a triangle along a line that connects midpoints, then each of the two resulting regions has half the area.

Wait, no. If you connect midpoints in a triangle, the resulting smaller triangle has 1/4 the area of the original triangle, and the trapezoid has 3/4. But in our case, the cutting plane isn't necessarily connecting midpoints of edges of the face; instead, it's cutting along a line that connects midpoints of edges in the tetrahedron.

Wait, let's take face ABC. The plane intersects AC at M1 and BC at M3. So, in face ABC, the line M1M3 is a midline, so it's parallel to AB and half its length. Therefore, triangle M1M3C is similar to triangle ABC with a scaling factor of 1/2, so its area is (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the original area.

But wait, the original area of face ABC is sqrt(3), so the smaller triangle would have area sqrt(3)/4, and the trapezoid would have area 3*sqrt(3)/4.

But wait, in reality, when you cut a triangle with a line connecting midpoints, the resulting smaller triangle is 1/4 the area, and the trapezoid is 3/4. So, yes, each face is split into a smaller triangle and a trapezoid, each with areas 1/4 and 3/4 of the original face.

But in our case, the plane isn't connecting midpoints of edges of the face, but rather midpoints of edges in the tetrahedron. So, for face ABC, the cutting line is M1M3, which connects midpoints of AC and BC. So, in face ABC, which is a triangle, this is equivalent to connecting midpoints of two sides, making a midline.

Therefore, indeed, the area is split into 1/4 and 3/4.

Similarly, for face ABD, the cutting line is M2M4, which connects midpoints of AD and BD, so again, a midline, resulting in a smaller triangle with 1/4 area and a trapezoid with 3/4 area.

But for the other two faces, ACD and BCD, the cutting lines M1M2 and M3M4 are not midlines but connect midpoints of edges in three-dimensional space.

Wait, for face ACD, the cutting line is M1M2, which connects midpoint of AC (M1) to midpoint of AD (M2). So, in face ACD, which is a triangle, the cutting line is connecting midpoints of two edges, so it's a midline, similar to the previous cases. Therefore, it splits face ACD into a smaller triangle with 1/4 area and a trapezoid with 3/4 area.

Similarly, for face BCD, the cutting line is M3M4, connecting midpoint of BC (M3) to midpoint of BD (M4). So, again, a midline, splitting face BCD into a smaller triangle with 1/4 area and a trapezoid with 3/4 area.

Therefore, each original face is split into a smaller triangle with area sqrt(3)/4 and a trapezoid with area 3*sqrt(3)/4.

So, each piece of the original tetrahedron will have, as its surface, the quadrilateral face (area 1) and some combination of these smaller triangles and trapezoids.

But wait, each piece will have exactly half of each original face. Since each original face is split into two parts, one part goes to each piece.

But since the original tetrahedron has four faces, each split into two, each piece will have four new faces: the quadrilateral and three smaller triangles? Wait, no, because each piece can't have four original faces. It's being split by the plane.

Wait, perhaps each piece will have three original faces and the new quadrilateral. But each original face is only partially included in each piece.

Wait, let's think about it: Each original face is split into two parts by the cutting plane. So, each piece will have half of each original face. But since the original tetrahedron has four faces, each piece will have four half-faces, but that doesn't make sense because each piece is a polyhedron with a finite number of faces.

Wait, maybe each piece will have three original faces and the quadrilateral. Let's see.

Looking at the structure, each piece will have the original vertices that are on one side of the cutting plane. So, one piece will have vertices A, M1, M2, M3, and the other piece will have vertices D, M1, M2, M4, M3.

Wait, no, because each piece is connected through the quadrilateral.

Wait, perhaps each piece is a kind of pyramid with a quadrilateral base.

Wait, actually, after cutting, each piece is a four-faced polyhedron: the quadrilateral and three triangles.

Wait, maybe each piece is a kind of pyramid with a quadrilateral base and three triangular sides.

But since the original tetrahedron is convex, the cut will create two convex polyhedrons, each with a quadrilateral face.

Wait, perhaps each piece has four faces: the quadrilateral and three triangles.

But the original tetrahedron has four faces; each face is split into two. So, each piece would have four faces: the quadrilateral and three smaller triangles, each from the split original faces.

Wait, but if each piece has four faces, and the original tetrahedron has four original faces, each split into two parts, then the total number of faces would be eight, but in reality, each piece has four faces, so two pieces would have eight faces, which matches.

So, each piece has four faces: three smaller triangles and one quadrilateral. Therefore, each piece's surface area is 3*(sqrt(3)/4) + area of quadrilateral.

Wait, but earlier, I found the area of the quadrilateral to be 1. So, the surface area would be 3*(sqrt(3)/4) + 1.

But wait, let's check: each original face is split into two parts, each part being 1/4 or 3/4 of the original face. So, each piece will have three smaller triangles each of area 1/4 of the original face, so each small triangle has area sqrt(3)/4, and the quadrilateral has area 1.

So, the total surface area for one piece is 3*(sqrt(3)/4) + 1.

But the original surface area was 4*sqrt(3). Each piece now has 3*(sqrt(3)/4) + 1, so two pieces would have 2*(3*sqrt(3)/4 + 1) = 3*sqrt(3)/2 + 2. But the original surface area was 4*sqrt(3), which is approximately 6.928, and 3*sqrt(3)/2 + 2 is approximately 2.598 + 2 = 4.598, which is less than the original. This suggests something is wrong because the total surface area should remain the same because we are just cutting the tetrahedron, not adding or removing material.

Wait, actually, no. The original surface area is 4*sqrt(3). After cutting, each piece will have some original faces and the new quadrilateral. The total surface area of both pieces combined will be the original surface area plus twice the area of the quadrilateral, because the quadrilateral is newly exposed on both pieces.

So, total surface area after cutting is 4*sqrt(3) + 2*1 = 4*sqrt(3) + 2.

Therefore, each piece has half of that, which is 2*sqrt(3) + 1.

But wait, that seems conflicting with the earlier thought.

Wait, actually, when you cut an object, you create two new surfaces, each equal to the area of the cutting plane. So, the total surface area becomes the original surface area plus twice the area of the cutting plane.

So, in this case, the original surface area is 4*sqrt(3). After cutting, each piece will have half of the original surface area plus the area of the cutting plane.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, when you cut, you're adding two new faces (the quadrilateral on each piece). The original surface area is split between the two pieces.

Wait, let me think. Each original face is split into two parts, so each piece will have half of each original face. But the cutting plane adds a new face to each piece.

So, the total surface area is the sum of the areas of the original faces split between the two pieces, plus the area of the cutting plane twice (once for each piece).

So, the surface area of each piece is (original surface area)/2 + area of cutting plane.

Therefore, original surface area is 4*sqrt(3), so each piece has 2*sqrt(3) + 1.

Wait, but in our case, the area of the cutting plane is a quadrilateral with area 1. So, each piece has 2*sqrt(3) + 1.

But wait, let me verify: if we have two pieces, each with surface area 2*sqrt(3) + 1, then total surface area is 2*(2*sqrt(3) + 1) = 4*sqrt(3) + 2, which is equal to the original surface area plus twice the area of the cutting plane. That makes sense, because when you cut, you add two new faces each of area 1, so total added area is 2*1=2.

Therefore, each piece's surface area is 2*sqrt(3) + 1.

But wait, that seems inconsistent with the earlier idea that each original face is split into two. Because each original face is split into two parts, each of area sqrt(3)/2. So, each piece would have half of each face, which is sqrt(3)/2, and then some.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. Each original face is split into two smaller polygons: a triangle and a trapezoid.

Each triangle has area 1/4 of the original face, so sqrt(3)/4, and each trapezoid has area 3/4 of the original face, so 3*sqrt(3)/4.

But each piece of the tetrahedron will have some of these triangles and trapezoids. However, since the cutting plane is a single plane, each piece can't have all the triangles or all the trapezoids.

Wait, perhaps each piece will have three trapezoids and the quadrilateral, and the other piece will have three triangles and the quadrilateral.

But let's calculate the total surface area for each piece.

Total original surface area: 4*sqrt(3).

After cutting, each piece has half of each original face, but also the quadrilateral. So, each piece has:

- Half of each original face: 4*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*sqrt(3)

Plus the area of the quadrilateral: 1

So, total surface area per piece: 2*sqrt(3) + 1

Which is the same as before.

Therefore, the surface area of one of the pieces is 2*sqrt(3) + 1.

But let me confirm this with another approach.

Alternatively, I can compute the surface area of one of the pieces by summing the areas of its faces.

Each piece is a polyhedron with four faces: the quadrilateral M1M2M4M3 and three triangular faces.

So, each piece has:

1. Quadrilateral face: area 1.

2. Three triangular faces: each is half of the original triangular faces.

Wait, but each triangular face is split into two, so each piece has half of each original triangular face.

But each original triangular face is split into two, each with area 1/2 of the original face.

Wait, no, because each face is a triangle, and the cutting plane cuts each face into a smaller triangle and a trapezoid, as we discussed.

But the smaller triangle has 1/4 the area, and the trapezoid has 3/4.

So, each piece will have, for each original face, either the smaller triangle or the trapezoid.

But since each original face is split, each piece will have four half-faces: half from each original face.

Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, let's use coordinates to compute the areas of the triangular faces of one piece.

Let's take one piece, which includes vertices A, M1, M2, M3.

Wait, no, actually, when you cut the tetrahedron with the plane, which is halfway between AB and CD, the two resulting pieces each have four faces: the quadrilateral and three triangular faces.

But each triangular face is a face of the original tetrahedron or a new face created by the cut.

Wait, perhaps we can compute the areas of the triangular faces of one piece.

So, let's take one of the pieces, say, the one containing vertex A.

This piece has the following vertices:

- A: (0, 0, 0)

- M1: (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

- M2: (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

- M3: (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

Wait, actually, is that correct? Because when you cut the tetrahedron with the plane, the piece containing A would have A, M1, M2, M3.

But wait, let's check: the plane equation is sqrt(6)(x) + sqrt(3)(y) = d.

Wait, no, earlier, we found the normal vector of the plane, but perhaps we can find the equation of the plane.

Wait, the plane passes through M1, M2, M3. So, let's compute its equation.

We can use the three points M1, M2, M3 to find the equation.

Given points:

M1: (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

M2: (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

M3: (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

Let me compute two vectors on the plane:

Vector M1M2: (0, -sqrt(3)/3, sqrt(6)/3)

Vector M1M3: (1, 0, 0)

We already computed the normal vector as (0, sqrt(6)/3, sqrt(3)/3)

So, the plane equation can be written as:

0*(x - 0.5) + (sqrt(6)/3)*(y - sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/3)*(z - 0) = 0

Simplify:

(sqrt(6)/3)*(y - sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/3)*z = 0

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:

sqrt(6)*(y - sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)*z = 0

Expand:

sqrt(6)*y - sqrt(6)*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)*z = 0

Simplify sqrt(6)*sqrt(3) = sqrt(18) = 3*sqrt(2). So:

sqrt(6)*y - (3*sqrt(2))/2 + sqrt(3)*z = 0

Rearranged:

sqrt(6)*y + sqrt(3)*z = (3*sqrt(2))/2

So, the equation of the plane is sqrt(6)y + sqrt(3)z = (3*sqrt(2))/2.

Now, to find the surface area of the piece containing vertex A, which is bounded by the quadrilateral M1M2M4M3 and the triangular faces AM1M2, AM2M3, AM3M4? Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, actually, when you cut the tetrahedron, each piece is a kind of prism with the quadrilateral face and three triangular faces.

But to find the surface area, we need to compute the areas of each of these four faces.

So, one piece:

1. Quadrilateral face: M1M2M4M3, area 1.

2. Triangular face: AM1M2.

3. Triangular face: AM2M3.

4. Triangular face: AM3M4.

Wait, is that correct? Or perhaps it's AM1M3?

Wait, in reality, the piece containing A is bounded by:

- The original edges from A to M1, M2, M3.

But actually, M4 is on BD, so perhaps the triangular faces are AM1M2, AM2M3, and AM3M4.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate each triangular face's area.

So, let's compute the area of each triangular face:

1. Face AM1M2: triangle with vertices A(0,0,0), M1(0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0), M2(0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3).

We can compute the vectors:

Vector AM1 = M1 - A = (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

Vector AM2 = M2 - A = (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

Compute the cross product:

| i         j         k     |

|0.5   sqrt(3)/2   0|

|0.5   sqrt(3)/6   sqrt(6)/3|

Calculating determinant:

i*(sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(6)/3 - 0 * sqrt(3)/6) - j*(0.5 * sqrt(6)/3 - 0 * 0.5) + k*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/6 - sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5)

Simplify:

i*(sqrt(18)/6 - 0) - j*(sqrt(6)/6 - 0) + k*(sqrt(3)/12 - sqrt(3)/2)

Simplify each component:

i*( (3*sqrt(2))/6 ) - j*( sqrt(6)/6 ) + k*( sqrt(3)/12 - 6*sqrt(3)/12 )

Which is:

i*( sqrt(2)/2 ) - j*( sqrt(6)/6 ) + k*( -5*sqrt(3)/12 )

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt( (sqrt(2)/2)^2 + (sqrt(6)/6)^2 + ( -5*sqrt(3)/12 )^2 )

Compute each term:

(sqrt(2)/2)^2 = (2)/4 = 0.5

(sqrt(6)/6)^2 = 6/36 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667

(-5*sqrt(3)/12)^2 = (25*3)/144 = 75/144 ≈ 0.5208

Add them up: 0.5 + 0.1667 + 0.5208 ≈ 1.1875

So, sqrt(1.1875) ≈ 1.0897

So, the area of triangle AM1M2 is approximately 1.0897. But let's compute it exactly.

Compute the magnitude squared:

( sqrt(2)/2 )^2 + ( sqrt(6)/6 )^2 + ( -5*sqrt(3)/12 )^2

= (2/4) + (6/36) + (75/144)

= (1/2) + (1/6) + (25/48)

Convert to 48 denominator:

= 24/48 + 8/48 + 25/48

= (24 + 8 + 25)/48 = 57/48 = 19/16

Therefore, the magnitude is sqrt(19/16) = sqrt(19)/4 ≈ 2.1213/4 ≈ 0.5303.

Wait, hold on, that can't be. Wait, sqrt(19)/4 is approximately 1.3228/4 ≈ 0.3307. Wait, but earlier, when computing the cross product, the magnitude squared was 19/16, so the magnitude is sqrt(19)/4 ≈ 1.3228.

Wait, but the area is half the magnitude of the cross product. So, area is (sqrt(19)/4)/2 = sqrt(19)/8 ≈ 1.3228/8 ≈ 0.1653.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the original face area is sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, and this triangle is a part of it, so 0.1653 seems too small. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, the vectors I used for the cross product were from point A to M1 and M2, so the cross product is for the parallelogram, so the area is half of that. So, the cross product's magnitude is sqrt(19)/4, so the area is half that, which is sqrt(19)/8.

But sqrt(19) is about 4.3589, so sqrt(19)/8 ≈ 0.5448.

Wait, okay, so area of triangle AM1M2 is approximately 0.5448.

Similarly, I can compute areas for the other two triangular faces on this piece.

2. Face AM2M3: triangle with vertices A(0,0,0), M2(0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3), M3(1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0).

Compute vectors:

Vector AM2 = M2 - A = (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

Vector AM3 = M3 - A = (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

Compute cross product:

|i           j           k     |

|0.5   sqrt(3)/6   sqrt(6)/3|

|1.5   sqrt(3)/2     0     |

Determinant:

i*(sqrt(3)/6 * 0 - sqrt(6)/3 * sqrt(3)/2) - j*(0.5*0 - sqrt(6)/3*1.5) + k*(0.5*sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/6*1.5)

Simplify each component:

i*(0 - (sqrt(18)/6)) - j*(0 - (1.5*sqrt(6)/3)) + k*(sqrt(3)/4 - (1.5*sqrt(3)/6))

Simplify:

i*(- (3*sqrt(2))/6 ) - j*(- (sqrt(6)/2 )) + k*(sqrt(3)/4 - sqrt(3)/4 )

Which is:

i*(- sqrt(2)/2 ) - j*(- sqrt(6)/2 ) + k*(0 )

So, the cross product vector is (-sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(6)/2, 0 )

The magnitude is sqrt( ( -sqrt(2)/2 )^2 + ( sqrt(6)/2 )^2 + 0^2 )

= sqrt( (2/4) + (6/4) ) = sqrt(8/4) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142

Therefore, the area of triangle AM2M3 is half of that, which is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071.

3. Face AM3M4: triangle with vertices A(0,0,0), M3(1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0), M4(1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3).

Compute vectors:

Vector AM3 = M3 - A = (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

Vector AM4 = M4 - A = (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

Compute cross product:

|i           j           k     |

|1.5   sqrt(3)/2     0     |

|1.5   sqrt(3)/6   sqrt(6)/3|

Determinant:

i*(sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(6)/3 - 0 * sqrt(3)/6 ) - j*(1.5 * sqrt(6)/3 - 0 * 1.5 ) + k*(1.5 * sqrt(3)/6 - sqrt(3)/2 * 1.5 )

Simplify:

i*( (sqrt(18))/6 - 0 ) - j*( (sqrt(6))/2 - 0 ) + k*( (sqrt(3))/4 - (3*sqrt(3))/2 )

Which is:

i*( (3*sqrt(2))/6 ) - j*( sqrt(6)/2 ) + k*( sqrt(3)/4 - 6*sqrt(3)/4 )

Simplify each component:

i*( sqrt(2)/2 ) - j*( sqrt(6)/2 ) + k*( -5*sqrt(3)/4 )

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt( (sqrt(2)/2)^2 + (sqrt(6)/2)^2 + ( -5*sqrt(3)/4 )^2 )

Compute each term:

(sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 2/4 = 0.5

(sqrt(6)/2)^2 = 6/4 = 1.5

(-5*sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 75/16 ≈ 4.6875

Sum: 0.5 + 1.5 + 4.6875 = 6.6875

So, magnitude is sqrt(6.6875) ≈ 2.586

Therefore, the area of triangle AM3M4 is half of that, which is approximately 1.293.

But let's compute it exactly.

Compute the magnitude squared:

( sqrt(2)/2 )^2 + ( sqrt(6)/2 )^2 + ( -5*sqrt(3)/4 )^2

= 0.5 + 1.5 + 75/16

Convert to 16 denominator:

= 8/16 + 24/16 + 75/16 = (8 + 24 + 75)/16 = 107/16

Therefore, magnitude is sqrt(107/16) = sqrt(107)/4 ≈ 10.344/4 ≈ 2.586

Half of that is sqrt(107)/8 ≈ 1.293.

So, area of triangle AM3M4 is sqrt(107)/8.

Wait, but that's approximately 1.293.

Wait, but that seems inconsistent because the quadrilateral area is 1, and the three triangles have areas approximately 0.5448, 0.7071, and 1.293, which sum up to 0.5448 + 0.7071 + 1.293 ≈ 2.5449, plus the quadrilateral area 1, total surface area ≈ 3.5449.

But earlier, I thought the surface area was 2*sqrt(3) + 1 ≈ 2*1.732 + 1 ≈ 4.464, which is different.

So, clearly, there is a mistake here because the total surface area of both pieces should be equal to the original surface area plus twice the area of the cutting plane.

Wait, the original surface area is 4*sqrt(3) ≈ 6.928.

Each piece's surface area is approximately 3.5449, so two pieces would have approximately 7.0898, which is more than the original. The difference is about 7.0898 - 6.928 ≈ 0.1618, which is about twice the area of the cutting plane (1). Wait, 0.1618 is roughly 1*0.1618, which is not twice. Hmm.

Wait, no, the total surface area after cutting should be original surface area plus 2*(cutting plane area). So, 6.928 + 2*1 = 8.928. But according to my calculation, the total surface area of both pieces is approximately 7.0898, which is less than 8.928. Therefore, my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the issue is that each triangular face on the piece is not just half of the original face, but actually a different triangle.

Wait, perhaps each triangular face on the piece is a new triangle formed by the cutting plane and edges.

Wait, perhaps I should use another method to compute the surface area.

Alternatively, perhaps each piece is a kind of frustum, but in 3D, which is called a frustum of a tetrahedron.

Wait, but frustums of tetrahedrons are not standard. Alternatively, perhaps each piece is a kind of pyramid with a quadrilateral base.

Wait, if each piece has a quadrilateral face and three triangular faces, then each is a kind of four-faced solid: a tetrahedron with a quadrilateral face. Wait, but a tetrahedron must have four triangular faces. Therefore, it's not a tetrahedron but a different polyhedron.

Wait, perhaps each piece is a pyramid with a triangular base. Hmm, no.

Wait, maybe it's better to use coordinates to compute the surface area.

So, let's take the piece containing vertex A: A(0,0,0), M1(0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0), M2(0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3), M3(1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0), and M4(1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3). Wait, no, actually, that's all the midpoints.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify which points are on each piece.

Wait, the cut is through M1, M2, M4. So, the piece containing A is bounded by A, M1, M2, M4, and the quadrilateral M1M2M4M3.

Wait, that seems to form a five-faced polyhedron: A, M1, M2, M4, and the quadrilateral. Wait, no, the quadrilateral is M1M2M4M3, so the piece containing A is bounded by A, M1, M2, M4, and M3.

Wait, no, because M3 is not on the same piece. Wait, no, M3 is midpoint of BC, which is on the opposite side.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to list all the faces of each piece.

Each piece will have:

- The quadrilateral face: M1M2M4M3.

- The original triangular faces that are split by the cutting plane.

But each original face is split into a triangle and a trapezoid. So, each piece will have:

- For the face ABC: the triangle AM1M2.

- For the face ABD: the triangle AM2M4.

- For the face ACD: the triangle AM1M3.

- For the face BCD: the triangle AM3M4.

Wait, but that's four triangular faces, plus the quadrilateral face, making five faces. But a tetrahedron can't have five faces.

Wait, no, each piece is a polyhedron with the quadrilateral face and three triangular faces. So, in total, four faces.

So, each piece has four faces:

1. Quadrilateral M1M2M4M3.

2. Triangle AM1M2.

3. Triangle AM2M4.

4. Triangle AM1M3.

5. Triangle AM3M4.

Wait, that's five faces. So, I think I'm missing something. Wait, no, the piece containing A is actually bounded by the quadrilateral and the three triangles: AM1M2, AM2M4, and AM4M3? Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the connections. Each piece is bounded by the cutting plane and the original vertices.

So, the piece containing A is bounded by:

- The quadrilateral face M1M2M4M3.

- The three original edges from A: AM1, AM2, AM4.

Wait, but M3 is not connected to A, so perhaps the triangular faces are AM1M2, AM2M4, and AM4M3? Wait, but M3 is not connected to A.

Wait, perhaps the triangular faces are:

- AM1M2

- AM2M4

- AM4M3

- AM3M1

But that would make a four-faced figure, but M3 is not connected to A.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the coordinates to compute the areas of each face.

Wait, perhaps the piece containing A has the following faces:

1. Quadrilateral M1M2M4M3.

2. Triangle AM1M2.

3. Triangle AM2M4.

4. Triangle AM4M3.

5. Triangle AM3M1.

But that's five faces, which is more than a tetrahedron.

Wait, perhaps I have overlapping faces.

Alternatively, perhaps each piece is a pyramid with a quadrilateral base, but pyramids have a polygonal base and triangular sides.

Wait, maybe it's better to give up and just accept that each piece has four faces: the quadrilateral and three triangles, each with known areas.

But in that case, the total surface area would be 1 (quadrilateral) plus the areas of three triangles.

But in my earlier computation, the areas of the triangles were approximately 0.5448, 0.7071, and 1.293, which summed to about 2.5449, plus 1, totaling approximately 3.5449, which is about 3.545.

But according to the earlier formula, each piece should have surface area 2*sqrt(3) + 1 ≈ 2*1.732 + 1 ≈ 4.464. Which is different.

Alternatively, perhaps my mistake was in calculating the cross products. Let me check the calculation again.

First, face AM1M2:

Vectors AM1 = (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

Vectors AM2 = (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

Cross product:

|i           j           k     |

|0.5   sqrt(3)/2     0|

|0.5   sqrt(3)/6   sqrt(6)/3|

So,

i*(sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(6)/3 - 0 * sqrt(3)/6) - j*(0.5*sqrt(6)/3 - 0*0.5) + k*(0.5*sqrt(3)/6 - sqrt(3)/2 *0.5)

Simplify:

i*( (sqrt(18))/6 - 0 ) - j*( sqrt(6)/6 - 0 ) + k*( sqrt(3)/12 - sqrt(3)/4 )

= i*( (3*sqrt(2))/6 ) - j*( sqrt(6)/6 ) + k*( -sqrt(3)/12 )

= i*( sqrt(2)/2 ) - j*( sqrt(6)/6 ) + k*( -sqrt(3)/12 )

Therefore, the cross product vector is (sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(6)/6, -sqrt(3)/12 )

Compute magnitude squared:

( sqrt(2)/2 )^2 + ( -sqrt(6)/6 )^2 + ( -sqrt(3)/12 )^2

= (2/4) + (6/36) + (3/144)

= 0.5 + 0.1667 + 0.0208

≈ 0.6875

Therefore, magnitude is sqrt(0.6875) ≈ 0.8291

Therefore, area is half that: 0.4146

Wait, so my earlier calculation was wrong. The cross product's magnitude squared was 0.6875, so magnitude is sqrt(0.6875) ≈ 0.8291, so area is half of that, which is ≈ 0.4146.

Wait, that makes more sense because sqrt(0.6875) is sqrt(11/16) = sqrt(11)/4 ≈ 0.8291.

Therefore, area of triangle AM1M2 is sqrt(11)/8 ≈ 0.4146.

Similarly, let's recalculate all areas correctly.

Face AM1M2:

Vectors AM1 = (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

Vectors AM2 = (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

Cross product is (sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(6)/6, -sqrt(3)/12 )

Magnitude squared: (sqrt(2)/2)^2 + (sqrt(6)/6)^2 + (sqrt(3)/12)^2

= (2/4) + (6/36) + (3/144)

= 0.5 + 0.1667 + 0.0208 ≈ 0.6875

So, magnitude is sqrt(0.6875) = sqrt(11/16) = sqrt(11)/4 ≈ 0.8291

Area = 0.8291 / 2 ≈ 0.4146

So, area of AM1M2 is sqrt(11)/8 ≈ 0.4146.

Face AM2M3:

Compute vectors:

AM2 = (0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3)

AM3 = (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0)

Cross product:

|i           j           k     |

|0.5   sqrt(3)/6   sqrt(6)/3|

|1.5   sqrt(3)/2     0     |

Determinant:

i*(sqrt(3)/6 * 0 - sqrt(6)/3 * sqrt(3)/2 ) - j*(0.5*0 - sqrt(6)/3*1.5 ) + k*(0.5*sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/6*1.5 )

Simplify:

i*(0 - sqrt(18)/6 ) - j*(0 - sqrt(6)/2 ) + k*( sqrt(3)/4 - sqrt(3)/4 )

= i*(- (3*sqrt(2))/6 ) - j*(- sqrt(6)/2 ) + k*(0 )

= ( - sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(6)/2, 0 )

Magnitude squared:

( -sqrt(2)/2 )^2 + ( sqrt(6)/2 )^2 + 0

= 0.5 + 1.5 = 2.0

Magnitude is sqrt(2.0) ≈ 1.4142

Area is half that: sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071.

Face AM3M4:

Vectors:

AM3 = (1.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0 )

AM4 = (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3 )

Cross product:

|i           j           k     |

|1.5   sqrt(3)/2     0     |

|1.5   sqrt(3)/6   sqrt(6)/3|

Determinant:

i*(sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(6)/3 - 0 * sqrt(3)/6 ) - j*(1.5*sqrt(6)/3 - 0*1.5 ) + k*(1.5*sqrt(3)/6 - sqrt(3)/2 *1.5 )

Simplify:

i*( (sqrt(18))/6 - 0 ) - j*( sqrt(6)/2 - 0 ) + k*( sqrt(3)/4 - (3*sqrt(3))/2 )

= i*( (3*sqrt(2))/6 ) - j*( sqrt(6)/2 ) + k*( -5*sqrt(3)/4 )

= ( sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(6)/2, -5*sqrt(3)/4 )

Magnitude squared:

( sqrt(2)/2 )^2 + ( sqrt(6)/2 )^2 + ( -5*sqrt(3)/4 )^2

= 0.5 + 1.5 + (75/16 ) ≈ 2.0 + 4.6875 ≈ 6.6875

Magnitude is sqrt(6.6875 ) ≈ 2.586

Area is half that: 1.293.

Face AM4M1:

Vectors:

AM4 = (1.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3 )

AM1 = (0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0 )

Cross product:

|i           j           k     |

|1.5   sqrt(3)/6   sqrt(6)/3|

|0.5   sqrt(3)/2     0     |

Determinant:

i*(sqrt(3)/6 * 0 - sqrt(6)/3 * sqrt(3)/2 ) - j*(1.5*0 - sqrt(6)/3*0.5 ) + k*(1.5*sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/6*0.5 )

Simplify:

i*(0 - sqrt(18)/6 ) - j*(0 - sqrt(6)/6 ) + k*( (3*sqrt(3))/4 - sqrt(3)/12 )

= i*(- (3*sqrt(2))/6 ) - j*(- sqrt(6)/6 ) + k*( (9*sqrt(3))/12 - sqrt(3)/12 )

= ( - sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(6)/6, (8*sqrt(3))/12 )

= ( - sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(6)/6, 2*sqrt(3)/3 )

Magnitude squared:

( -sqrt(2)/2 )^2 + ( sqrt(6)/6 )^2 + ( 2*sqrt(3)/3 )^2

= 0.5 + 0.1667 + (4*3)/9

= 0.5 + 0.1667 + 1.3333 ≈ 2.0

Magnitude is sqrt(2.0 ) ≈ 1.4142

Area is half that: sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071.

So, now, the areas are:

1. Quadrilateral M1M2M4M3: 1

2. Triangle AM1M2: sqrt(11)/8 ≈ 0.4146

3. Triangle AM2M3: sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071

4. Triangle AM3M4: sqrt( (sqrt(2)/2)^2 + (sqrt(6)/2)^2 + ( -5*sqrt(3)/4 )^2 ) / 2 ≈ 1.293

5. Triangle AM4M1: sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071

Wait, so the total surface area is:

1 (quadrilateral) + 0.4146 + 0.7071 + 1.293 + 0.7071 ≈ 1 + 0.4146 + 0.7071 + 1.293 + 0.7071 ≈ 4.1218.

But this is just an approximate calculation, and the exact value is:

1 + (sqrt(11)/8) + (sqrt(2)/2) + (sqrt( (sqrt(2)/2)^2 + (sqrt(6)/2)^2 + ( -5*sqrt(3)/4 )^2 ))/2 + (sqrt(2)/2).

Wait, but this seems too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the face AM3M4 is a triangle with area sqrt(19)/8, as I computed earlier.

Wait, but no, that was incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 1 + sqrt(11)/8 + sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt( something ) + sqrt(2)/2.

Wait, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming.

Alternatively, since the problem is symmetric, perhaps the surface area of one piece is 1 + sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 = 1 + sqrt(3). But 1 + sqrt(3) is approximately 2.732, which is less than the original surface area, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, given that the cutting plane is halfway between AB and CD, and the original tetrahedron is regular, perhaps the surface area of the piece is 1 + sqrt(3).

But I don't have confidence in this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the height of the cutting plane from the base.

Given that the cutting plane is halfway between AB and CD, which are skew lines.

The distance between AB and CD is sqrt(3)/2.

So, the cutting plane is at a distance of sqrt(3)/4 from both AB and CD.

Therefore, the piece containing AB would have a height of sqrt(3)/4 from AB.

But I'm not sure how to compute the surface area from that.

Alternatively, perhaps the piece is a square pyramid or something.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should check similar problems.

Wait, in a regular tetrahedron, if you cut it with a plane halfway between two opposite edges, the resulting figure has a quadrilateral face whose area is 1, and three triangular faces each of area sqrt(3)/2. So, total surface area is 1 + 3*(sqrt(3)/2) = 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2.

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, but checking the units, 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2 is roughly 1 + 2.598 ≈ 3.598, which is similar to my initial approximate calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the surface area is 1 + sqrt(3).

Wait, 1 + sqrt(3) ≈ 2.732, which is too low.

Alternatively, maybe 1 + sqrt(6). But sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449, so 1 + 2.449 ≈ 3.449, which is about the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact surface area is 1 + sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 + 1 = 2 + sqrt(3). But sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so 2 + 1.732 ≈ 3.732.

Alternatively, perhaps 1 + sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 + 1 = 2 + sqrt(3). But that seems arbitrary.

Wait, but I think the exact surface area can be found by considering the area of the quadrilateral and the areas of the three triangular faces.

But since I was able to compute the cross products and the areas of the triangles, even though it's complicated, perhaps I can add them up.

So, areas:

1. Quadrilateral: 1

2. Triangle AM1M2: sqrt(11)/8

3. Triangle AM2M3: sqrt(2)/2

4. Triangle AM3M4: sqrt( (sqrt(2)/2)^2 + (sqrt(6)/2)^2 + ( -5*sqrt(3)/4 )^2 ) / 2 = sqrt( (0.5 + 1.5 + 2.5875 ) ) / 2 = sqrt(4.0875)/2 ≈ 2.0218/2 ≈ 1.0109.

Wait, but my previous calculation gives area ≈ 1.293, which is different.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the exact value.

Compute the cross product for triangle AM3M4:

Cross product vector is (sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(6)/2, -5*sqrt(3)/4 )

Magnitude squared is (sqrt(2)/2)^2 + (sqrt(6)/2)^2 + ( -5*sqrt(3)/4 )^2

= (2/4) + (6/4) + (75/16 )

= 0.5 + 1.5 + 4.6875

= 6.6875

So, magnitude is sqrt(6.6875) = sqrt(107/16) = sqrt(107)/4

Therefore, area is half that: sqrt(107)/8 ≈ 10.344/8 ≈ 1.293.

Therefore, the exact area is sqrt(107)/8.

Therefore, the surface area of the piece is:

1 (quadrilateral) + sqrt(11)/8 + sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(107)/8 + sqrt(2)/2

Simplify:

1 + (sqrt(11) + sqrt(107))/8 + sqrt(2)

But that's a complicated expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires a simpler answer, such as 1 + sqrt(3).

But without an exact method, it's difficult to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the surface area is 1 + 3*(sqrt(2)/2) = 1 + (3*sqrt(2))/2.

But that's approximately 1 + 2.121 ≈ 3.121, which is still low.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is sqrt(3) + 1, which is approximately 2.732.

But in my initial calculation, the total is approximately 4.1218, which is more.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the areas.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the areas of the triangles.

Each original face is split into a triangle and a trapezoid. Each triangle has area 1/4 of the original face. So, each triangle has area 1/4 * sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/4.

But the three triangles on the piece would have total area 3*(sqrt(3)/4 ) = 3*sqrt(3)/4.

Adding the quadrilateral area 1, total surface area is 1 + 3*sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 1 + 1.299 ≈ 2.299, which is still low.

Wait, no, the triangles on the piece are not 1/4 of the original face, but more.

Wait, when you cut a face into a triangle and a trapezoid, the area of the triangle is half of the area of the original face.

Wait, because the cutting line is a midline, so the area is split equally.

Wait, but in my earlier computation, the triangle area was sqrt(11)/8 ≈ 0.4146, which is less than half of sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Therefore, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the area is divided in a ratio.

Wait, in a trapezoid, the area is the average of the two parallel sides multiplied by the height.

The height of the trapezoid is half the height of the original face.

The original face has height sqrt(3)/2, so the trapezoid has height sqrt(3)/4.

The two parallel sides are the midline (length 1/2) and the original edge (length 1).

Therefore, area of the trapezoid is (1/2 + 1)/2 * sqrt(3)/4 = (3/2)/2 * sqrt(3)/4 = (3/4)*sqrt(3)/4 = 3*sqrt(3)/16 ≈ 0.3248.

Area of the triangle is the remaining part, which is sqrt(3)/2 - 3*sqrt(3)/16 = (8*sqrt(3)/16 - 3*sqrt(3)/16 ) = 5*sqrt(3)/16 ≈ 0.5413.

Wait, so each original face is split into a triangle with area 5*sqrt(3)/16 and a trapezoid with area 3*sqrt(3)/16.

Therefore, each piece will have:

- One quadrilateral face with area 1.

- Three triangular faces, each with area 5*sqrt(3)/16.

Therefore, total surface area is 1 + 3*(5*sqrt(3)/16 ) = 1 + 15*sqrt(3)/16 ≈ 1 + 1.623 ≈ 2.623.

But that conflicts with the earlier result.

Wait, 15*sqrt(3)/16 ≈ 15*1.732/16 ≈ 25.98/16 ≈ 1.623.

So, 1 + 1.623 ≈ 2.623.

But according to the original surface area, 4*sqrt(3) ≈ 6.928, so half of that is ~3.464, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the surface area is 1 + 3*(5*sqrt(3)/16 ) + 1, but that seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe each piece has:

- One quadrilateral face with area 1.

- Three triangular faces each with area 5*sqrt(3)/16.

And the original base is not part of the surface anymore.

But the original base is divided into smaller triangles, so it's not contributing.

Alternatively, perhaps the surface area is only the areas of the four faces: the quadrilateral and the three triangles.

So, 1 + 3*(5*sqrt(3)/16 ) = 1 + 15*sqrt(3)/16 ≈ 1 + 1.623 ≈ 2.623.

But since the original tetrahedron's surface area is 4*sqrt(3) ≈ 6.928, cutting it with a plane that is halfway between AB and CD would mean that each piece's surface area is roughly half of that plus some.

Wait, maybe it's 1 (quadrilateral) plus 3*(sqrt(3)/2 ) (triangles). But that would be 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 1 + 2.598 ≈ 3.598.

Alternatively, since each triangle on the piece is 5*sqrt(3)/16, which is about 0.5413, so 3 of them are about 1.623, plus 1 is 2.623.

But this is conflicting.

Wait, given that I have conflicting results, perhaps the correct answer is 1 + sqrt(3).

But sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 1 + 1.732 ≈ 2.732.

But according to the cross product method, the surface area is about 4.12, which is too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the surface area is 1 + 3*(sqrt(2)/2 ) ≈ 1 + 2.121 ≈ 3.121.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 1 + sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 = 1 + sqrt(3) ≈ 2.732.

But in any case, I think this is taking too long, and perhaps the answer is 1 + sqrt(3).

Wait, but looking back, the initial face area is sqrt(3). The cutting plane cuts the tetrahedron into two pieces, each with half the volume. The surface area of each piece is the original face area plus the area of the cutting plane.

Wait, no, because the cutting plane is internal.

Wait, another thought. The original tetrahedron has four triangular faces, each with area sqrt(3). When we make a cut halfway between AB and CD, the two new faces each have area 1, and the rest of the surface area remains.

Wait, but that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the surface area of each piece is 1 (the cutting plane) plus three times the area of a triangle.

But with the cutting plane area 1, and three triangular faces each with area something.

But perhaps each triangular face has area 1/2.

Wait, but earlier cross product gave me 1.293 for one triangle.

Alternatively, in the cross product, the area was sqrt(107)/8 ≈ 1.293, but 1.293 is roughly sqrt(1.67), which is not a clean number.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact surface area is 1 + sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 +1, which is 2 + sqrt(3).

But 2 + sqrt(3) ≈ 3.732, which is in line with the approximate calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 1 + sqrt(3).

But wait, based on the cross product, the exact surface area is 1 + sqrt(11)/8 + sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(107)/8 + sqrt(2)/2.

But that's messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the cross products.

Wait, in triangle AM1M2, the cross product was sqrt(2)/2, so area sqrt(11)/8? Wait, no, the cross product's magnitude was sqrt(11)/4, so area was sqrt(11)/8.

But is that correct?

Wait, the cross product vector was (sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(6)/6, -sqrt(3)/12 )

Magnitude squared was (sqrt(2)/2)^2 + (-sqrt(6)/6)^2 + (-sqrt(3)/12)^2

= 0.5 + 1/3 + 1/48

= 0.5 + 0.3333 + 0.0208 ≈ 0.8541

So, magnitude is sqrt(0.8541 ) ≈ 0.924, so area is half that, ≈ 0.462.

Wait, that's different from sqrt(11)/8 ≈ 0.4146.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, (sqrt(2)/2 )^2 = (2)/4 = 0.5

(-sqrt(6)/6 )^2 = (6)/36 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667

(-sqrt(3)/12 )^2 = (3)/144 = 1/48 ≈ 0.0208

So, total magnitude squared: 0.5 + 0.1667 + 0.0208 ≈ 0.6875

So, magnitude is sqrt(0.6875 ) ≈ 0.8291

So, area is half that: ≈ 0.4146, which is sqrt(11)/8 ≈ 0.4146.

So, that was correct.

Therefore, the total surface area is approximately 1 + 0.4146 + 0.7071 + 1.293 + 0.7071 ≈ 4.1218.

But in exact terms, it's 1 + sqrt(11)/8 + sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(107)/8 + sqrt(2)/2.

But that's too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is set up so that the surface area is 1 + sqrt(3).

But in that case, 1 + sqrt(3) ≈ 2.732, which is less than the original surface area, which is 4*sqrt(3) ≈ 6.928.

So, that can't be, because cutting the tetrahedron would add more surface area.

Wait, the original surface area is 4*sqrt(3). When cutting it, you create two new surfaces (the cutting planes) and preserve some of the original surface.

Each piece will have the original surface area minus the part that was cut plus the new cutting surface.

Therefore, each piece's surface area is original surface area minus the area of the cut plus the area of the cutting plane.

But the original surface area is 4*sqrt(3). Each piece is half the volume, so the area of the cut is half of the original face area.

But wait, the cutting plane is not a face, it's a plane cutting through the tetrahedron, creating a new face on each piece.

Therefore, each piece's surface area is equal to half the original surface area plus the area of the cutting plane.

But half the original surface area is 2*sqrt(3).

But that can't be, because each piece's surface area is greater than half the original.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, the original surface area is 4*sqrt(3). The cutting plane adds two new faces (each with area 1), but each piece would have one of these new faces.

Wait, no, the cutting plane is a single plane, so each piece has a new face with area 1.

Therefore, each piece's surface area is half the original surface area plus 1.

So, half of 4*sqrt(3) is 2*sqrt(3), plus 1, which is 2*sqrt(3) + 1 ≈ 3.464 + 1 ≈ 4.464.

But according to my earlier calculation, it's approximately 4.1218, which is less than 4.464.

Therefore, perhaps my approach was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the area of the cutting plane is 1, and each piece's surface area is half of the original surface area plus 1.

But that may not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the surface area is 1 + 3*(sqrt(3)/2 ) = 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 1 + 2.598 ≈ 3.598.

But I don't know.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should conclude that the surface area is 1 + sqrt(3).

But wait, 1 + sqrt(3) is approximately 2.732, which is less than the original surface area, which is impossible because the cutting adds new faces.

Wait, maybe the surface area is 1 + 3*(sqrt(3)/2 ) ≈ 1 + 2.598 ≈ 3.598.

But I don't know the exact answer.

Wait, perhaps I can find the answer in the following way:

Since the cutting plane is halfway between AB and CD, the intersection points are midpoints of the edges. Therefore, the cutting plane is the midplane of the tetrahedron.

In a regular tetrahedron, the midplane parallel to two opposite edges would create a parallelogram.

But in this case, the midplane is not parallel, but rather cutting through the midpoints.

Wait, perhaps the midplane is actually the same as the midline connecting midpoints of the edges.

Therefore, the resulting figure has a quadrilateral as a face and three triangular faces.

But to get the surface area, perhaps the answer is 1 + sqrt(3).

But I think, given the time I've spent, I'll go with the exact value.

Wait, let me check:

If the cross products for the triangles give areas sqrt(11)/8, sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(107)/8, sqrt(2)/2, then the total surface area is:

1 (quadrilateral) + sqrt(11)/8 + sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(107)/8 + sqrt(2)/2

= 1 + (sqrt(11) + sqrt(107))/8 + sqrt(2)

But that's the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 1 + sqrt(3). But since I can't verify, perhaps that's the best I can do.

Wait, another idea. The original tetrahedron has four faces, each area sqrt(3). The cutting plane cuts it into two pieces. Each piece will have:

- One face from the cutting plane: area 1.

- Some number of original faces.

But each original face is split into two parts.

Therefore, each piece will have:

- The cutting plane face: 1.

- Three original faces, each split into a triangle and a trapezoid.

Therefore, each piece has three triangular faces and the cutting plane face.

Therefore, the surface area is 1 + 3*(something).

But to find the area of the triangular parts.

But each original face is split into a triangle and a trapezoid, each with area half of the original.

Therefore, each triangular part has area sqrt(3)/2.

Therefore, each piece has three triangular parts with area sqrt(3)/2, so total triangular area is 3*(sqrt(3)/2 ) = (3*sqrt(3))/2.

Adding the cutting plane area 1, total surface area is 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 1 + 2.598 ≈ 3.598.

But 3.598 is approximately 11/3, which is about 3.666, but not exact.

But according to this logic, the surface area is 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2.

But since the problem is about a plane halfway between AB and CD, maybe the cutting plane is actually such that each original face is split into a triangle with area half of the original.

Therefore, the surface area of each piece is 1 + 3*(sqrt(3)/2 ) = 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2.

But that's an exact answer.

But the problem says "surface area of one of the pieces". So, the surface area is 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2.

But 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2 is approximately 3.598, which is more than half of 4*sqrt(3 )≈6.928, which is 3.464, so it's a bit more, which makes sense because the cutting adds a new face.

Therefore, the surface area of one piece is 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2.

But wait, that would be 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2, but in the problem statement, the tetrahedron has edge length 2, so sqrt(3) is the height.

Alternatively, the surface area is 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2.

But let me verify the calculation.

Each original face area is sqrt(3). When cut halfway, each face is split into a triangle and a trapezoid, each with area half of the original, so sqrt(3)/2.

Therefore, each piece has three triangular faces, each with area sqrt(3)/2, plus the cutting plane face with area 1.

Therefore, total surface area is 1 + 3*(sqrt(3)/2 ) = 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2.

So, 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2.

Therefore, the answer is 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2.

But in boxed form, that's 1 + (3√3)/2.

But let me check my earlier calculation where I computed the cross products.

Wait, if each triangular face has area sqrt(3)/2, then three of them would have total area (3*sqrt(3))/2, plus the cutting plane area 1, so total surface area is 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2.

But according to my cross product method, the surface area was approximately 4.1218, which is more than 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 3.598.

Therefore, perhaps the cross product method was incorrect because I considered individual triangles, but in reality, each original face is split into two equal areas.

Therefore, each piece has:

- 1 quadrilateral face: area 1.

- 3 triangular faces: each with area sqrt(3)/2.

Therefore, total surface area is 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2.

Therefore, the answer is 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2.

But wait, when I think of a regular tetrahedron, cutting it halfway between two opposite edges with a plane, the resulting cross-section is a quadrilateral, and each piece has three triangular faces and one quadrilateral face.

Thus, the surface area is 1 + 3*(sqrt(3)/2 ) + 1, but no, the cutting plane is only one face per piece.

Wait, no, each piece only has one cutting plane face, which is 1, and three original faces split into triangles, each of area sqrt(3)/2.

Therefore, the surface area is 1 + 3*(sqrt(3)/2 ).

Thus, the surface area is 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2.

So, converting to LaTeX, it's 1 + \dfrac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}, which can be written as \boxed{1 + \dfrac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}}.

But let me verify once more.

If the cutting plane is halfway between AB and CD, then the two pieces each have:

- The cutting plane as one face: area 1.

- For each of the three original faces, a triangular portion with area half of the original face area.

Since each original face has area sqrt(3), the triangular portion has area sqrt(3)/2.

Therefore, three triangular faces with area sqrt(3)/2 each: total 3*(sqrt(3)/2 ) = (3*sqrt(3))/2.

Therefore, total surface area is 1 + (3*sqrt(3))/2.

Yes, that seems correct.

**Final Answer**
The surface area of one of the pieces is \boxed{1 + \dfrac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}}.
</think>

To solve the problem of finding the surface area of one of the pieces formed by cutting a regular tetrahedron with an edge length of 2, we start by understanding the structure of the tetrahedron and the nature of the cut.

1. **Understanding the Tetrahedron**:
   - A regular tetrahedron has four equilateral triangular faces.
   - Each face has an area of \(\sqrt{3}\).

2. **Nature of the Cut**:
   - The cut is made halfway between the skew lines \(AB\) and \(CD\).
   - This cut creates a plane that intersects the midpoints of the edges \(AC\), \(AD\), \(BC\), and \(BD\).

3. **Surface Area Calculation**:
   - The resulting pieces each have a new quadrilateral face where the cut was made.
   - Each piece also retains three original triangular faces, each split into a smaller triangle and a trapezoid.
   - The area of each original face is split equally, so each triangular portion has an area of \(\sqrt{3}/2\).

4. **Surface Area of One Piece**:
   - The quadrilateral face created by the cut has an area of 1.
   - Each of the three original faces contributes a triangular portion with an area of \(\sqrt{3}/2\).
   - Therefore, the total surface area of one piece is the sum of the area of the quadrilateral face and the areas of the three triangular portions.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The total surface area is \(1 + 3 \times (\sqrt{3}/2) = 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Thus, the surface area of one of the pieces is \(\boxed{1 + \dfrac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}}\).
