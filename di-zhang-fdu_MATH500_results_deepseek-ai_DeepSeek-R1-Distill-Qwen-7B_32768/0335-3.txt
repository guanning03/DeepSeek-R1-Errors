Question:
Find the real roots of
\[\frac{( x+ 1)(x - 3)}{5(x + 2)(x - 4)} + \frac{(x + 3)(x - 5)}{9(x + 4)(x - 6)} - \frac{2(x + 5)(x - 7)}{13(x + 6)(x - 8)} = \frac{92}{585}.\]Enter the real roots, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
Multiplying out each numerator and denominator, we get
\[\frac{x^2 - 2x - 3}{5(x^2 - 2x - 8)} + \frac{x^2 - 2x - 15}{9(x^2 - 2x - 24)} - \frac{2(x^2 - 2x - 35)}{13(x^2 - 2x - 48)} = \frac{92}{585}.\]We can write this as
\[\frac{(x^2 - 2x - 8) + 5}{5(x^2 - 2x - 8)} + \frac{(x^2 - 2x - 24) + 9}{9(x^2 - 2x - 24)} - \frac{2((x^2 - 2x - 48) + 13)}{13(x^2 - 2x - 48)} = \frac{92}{585}.\]Hence,
\[\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 2x - 8} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 2x - 24} - \frac{2}{13} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 2x - 48} = \frac{92}{585}.\]This simplifies to
\[\frac{1}{x^2 - 2x - 8} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 2x - 24} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 2x - 48} = 0.\]Let $y = x^2 - 2x - 48.$  Then
\[\frac{1}{y + 40} + \frac{1}{y + 24} - \frac{2}{y} = 0.\]Multiplying everything by $y(y + 24)(y + 40),$ we get
\[y(y + 24) + y(y + 40) - 2(y + 24)(y + 40) = 0.\]This simplifies to $64y + 1920 = 0,$ so $y = -30.$  Then $x^2 - 2x - 48 = -30,$ or $x^2 - 2x - 18 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula, $x = \boxed{1 \pm \sqrt{19}}.$  (Since the denominators are nonzero for these values, we know that they are not extraneous.)

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this equation to solve:

\[
\frac{(x + 1)(x - 3)}{5(x + 2)(x - 4)} + \frac{(x + 3)(x - 5)}{9(x + 4)(x - 6)} - \frac{2(x + 5)(x - 7)}{13(x + 6)(x - 8)} = \frac{92}{585}.
\]

Wow, that's a complicated equation with three fractions and a constant term on the right. Hmm, let me see. I need to find the real roots of this equation, so I need to solve for x.

First, I should probably simplify each of these fractions to make the equation more manageable. To do that, I might want to expand the numerators and denominators, but that seems like it could get messy. Alternatively, maybe I can find a common denominator for all three fractions and combine them into a single rational expression. Then, I can set that equal to 92/585 and solve the resulting equation.

Let me try that approach.

So, the equation is:

A + B - C = D,

where

A = [(x + 1)(x - 3)] / [5(x + 2)(x - 4)],
B = [(x + 3)(x - 5)] / [9(x + 4)(x - 6)],
C = [2(x + 5)(x - 7)] / [13(x + 6)(x - 8)],
and D = 92/585.

To combine A, B, and C, I need a common denominator. Let's see: the denominators are 5(x + 2)(x - 4), 9(x + 4)(x - 6), and 13(x + 6)(x - 8). So, the least common denominator (LCD) would be the product of all these distinct factors: 5, 9, 13, (x + 2), (x - 4), (x + 4), (x - 6), (x + 6), (x - 8).

So, the LCD is 5 * 9 * 13 * (x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8). That's a huge denominator, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps before jumping into combining them, I can see if the equation can be simplified in any other way. Maybe substituting y = x or something else? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying both sides to eliminate denominators? But with three terms, that might be complicated. Let's think.

Wait, maybe I can compute each fraction separately for a moment, add them up, and then set the sum equal to 92/585, then solve for x.

But that seems like it may not be straightforward either.

Alternatively, perhaps we can rewrite the fractions as partial fractions or something, but that might not help directly.

Wait, actually, looking at the denominators, each denominator has two linear factors. So, A has (x + 2)(x - 4), B has (x + 4)(x - 6), and C has (x + 6)(x - 8). Each subsequent denominator shifts by 2 in the roots. That seems like a pattern. Hmm, maybe that can be leveraged.

So, A is over (x + 2)(x - 4), B over (x + 4)(x - 6), and C over (x + 6)(x - 8). So, each denominator is two units apart in the roots. So, maybe we can write each fraction in terms of a shifted variable, like substituting z = x + 2, or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let y = x + something, but maybe that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I can cross-multiply each term with the LCD to eliminate denominators.

Wait, maybe that's the way to go. Let's try that.

So, the equation is:

A + B - C = D,

where A, B, C, D are as above.

The LCD is 5*9*13*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8). Let's compute that coefficient:

5*9=45, 45*13=585. So, the coefficient is 585. So, LCD is 585*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8).

So, if I multiply both sides by the LCD, I get:

585*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8)*(A + B - C) = 585*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8)*D.

But since D is 92/585, multiplying by LCD would cancel the 585, so the right-hand side becomes 92*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8).

So, on the left-hand side, we have:

585*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8)*(A + B - C).

But A, B, C each have denominators that are parts of the LCD. So, when we multiply each term by LCD, the denominators will cancel out.

So, for term A: A = [(x + 1)(x - 3)] / [5(x + 2)(x - 4)]

Multiplying A by LCD: 585*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8)/[5(x + 2)(x - 4)] = 585/5*(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8) = 117*(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8).

Similarly, term B: [(x + 3)(x - 5)] / [9(x + 4)(x - 6)]

Multiply by LCD: 585*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8)/[9(x + 4)(x - 6)] = 585/9*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 6)(x - 8) = 65*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 6)(x - 8).

Term C: [2(x + 5)(x - 7)] / [13(x + 6)(x - 8)]

Multiply by LCD: 585*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8)/[13(x + 6)(x - 8)] = 585/13*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6) = 45*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6).

But since the equation is A + B - C = D, when we multiply both sides by LCD, we get:

117*(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8) + 65*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 6)(x - 8) - 45*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6) = 92*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8).

So, now we have a polynomial equation. Let's denote this as:

Left side: L = 117*(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8) + 65*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 6)(x - 8) - 45*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)

Right side: R = 92*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8)

So, moving R to the left side:

L - R = 0.

So, let me write that:

117*(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8) + 65*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 6)(x - 8) - 45*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6) - 92*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8) = 0.

This looks really complicated, but maybe we can factor out some common terms or see if some terms can be combined.

Looking at the first three terms, they don't have the (x + 6)(x - 8) factor, except the last term. Wait, no, actually:

Wait, no, each term is a product of four linear factors except the last term, which is a product of six factors. So, the first three terms have four factors each, and the last term is six factors. So, perhaps this is a bit tricky.

Let me see. Let me denote:

Term1 = 117*(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8)

Term2 = 65*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 6)(x - 8)

Term3 = -45*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)

Term4 = -92*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8)

So, L - R = Term1 + Term2 + Term3 + Term4 = 0.

Hmm. Maybe we can factor some terms. Let's see.

First, note that Term1 and Term2 both have (x + 6)(x - 8). Similarly, Term3 and Term4 both have (x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6). Hmm, perhaps that can be useful.

Wait, perhaps Term1 and Term2 can be combined by factoring out (x + 6)(x - 8). Similarly, Term3 and Term4 can be combined by factoring out (x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6). Let me try that.

So, Term1 + Term2:

= 117*(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8) + 65*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 6)(x - 8)

= (x + 6)(x - 8)[117*(x + 4)(x - 6) + 65*(x + 2)(x - 4)]

Similarly, Term3 + Term4:

= -45*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6) -92*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8)

= - (x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)[45 + 92*(x + 6)(x - 8)]

So, putting it all together:

(x + 6)(x - 8)[117*(x + 4)(x - 6) + 65*(x + 2)(x - 4)] - (x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)[45 + 92*(x + 6)(x - 8)] = 0

Hmm, that's a bit better. Now, let me compute each bracketed term.

First, compute the coefficient for Term1 + Term2:

117*(x + 4)(x - 6) + 65*(x + 2)(x - 4)

Let me expand each product.

First, expand (x + 4)(x - 6):

= x^2 - 6x + 4x - 24 = x^2 - 2x -24

Then, 117*(x^2 - 2x -24) = 117x^2 - 234x - 2808

Next, expand (x + 2)(x - 4):

= x^2 - 4x + 2x - 8 = x^2 - 2x -8

Then, 65*(x^2 - 2x -8) = 65x^2 -130x -520

So, adding them together:

117x^2 - 234x -2808 + 65x^2 -130x -520

= (117x^2 + 65x^2) + (-234x -130x) + (-2808 -520)

= 182x^2 - 364x - 3328

So, Term1 + Term2 = (x + 6)(x - 8)*(182x^2 - 364x - 3328)

Similarly, let's compute the coefficient for Term3 + Term4:

- [45 + 92*(x + 6)(x - 8)]

First, compute 92*(x +6)(x -8):

= 92*(x^2 -8x +6x -48) = 92*(x^2 -2x -48) = 92x^2 -184x -4416

Then, 45 + 92x^2 -184x -4416 = 92x^2 -184x -4371

So, Term3 + Term4 = - (x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)*(92x^2 -184x -4371)

Putting it back into the equation:

(x + 6)(x - 8)*(182x^2 - 364x - 3328) - (x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)*(92x^2 -184x -4371) = 0

Hmm, now this equation is:

Term A - Term B = 0,

where

Term A = (x + 6)(x - 8)*(182x^2 - 364x - 3328)

and

Term B = (x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)*(92x^2 -184x -4371)

So, moving Term B to the other side:

Term A = Term B

So,

(x + 6)(x - 8)*(182x^2 - 364x - 3328) = (x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)*(92x^2 -184x -4371)

This is a big equation, but maybe we can factor some terms on both sides.

Looking at Term A: (x + 6)(x - 8)*(182x^2 - 364x - 3328)

Let me factor 182x^2 - 364x - 3328.

First, notice that 182 is 14*13, and 364 is 14*26, 3328 divided by 182: 3328 /182.

Wait, 182*18 = 3276, so 3328 - 3276 = 52, so 3328 = 182*18 + 52. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, let me factor out 14 from the quadratic:

182x^2 - 364x - 3328 = 14*(13x^2 -26x -238). Wait, 182 /14=13, 364 /14=26, 3328 /14=238.

So, 182x^2 - 364x - 3328 =14*(13x^2 -26x -238)

Then, let's try to factor 13x^2 -26x -238.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to 13*(-238) = -3104 and add to -26.

Hmm, factors of 3104: 3104 ÷16=194, 194 ÷2=97. So, 3104=16*194=16*2*97=32*97

Looking for two numbers that multiply to -3104 and add to -26.

Hmm, 97 is a prime number, so probably not easy. Maybe this quadratic doesn't factor nicely.

Similarly, let's check if 13x^2 -26x -238 can be factored.

Discriminant D= (26)^2 +4*13*238=676 + 4*13*238.

Compute 4*13=52, 52*238= let's compute 50*238=11900, 2*238=476, so total 11900 +476=12376. So, D=676 +12376=13052

sqrt(13052). Let's see, 114^2=12996, 115^2=13225. So between 114 and 115. Not a perfect square, so quadratic doesn't factor nicely. Hmm, so perhaps 182x^2 -364x -3328 is as factored as we can get.

Similarly, let's look at Term B: (x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)*(92x^2 -184x -4371)

First, note that (x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6) can be written as [(x + 2)(x - 6)][(x -4)(x +4)].

Compute (x +2)(x -6)=x^2 -4x -12

Compute (x -4)(x +4)=x^2 -16

So, Term B can be written as (x^2 -4x -12)(x^2 -16)*(92x^2 -184x -4371)

Similarly, let me factor 92x^2 -184x -4371.

Factor out 92: 92x^2 -184x -4371 = 92(x^2 -2x) -4371. Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, factor the quadratic:

Looking for two numbers a and b such that a*b=92*(-4371)= -92*4371.

That's a big number, but perhaps we can compute it.

92*4371: Let's compute 90*4371= 393,390, and 2*4371=8,742; so total 393,390 +8,742=402,132. So, a*b= -402,132.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to -402,132 and add to -184.

Hmm, this might be tough. Alternatively, compute the discriminant.

Discriminant D= (-184)^2 +4*92*4371.

Compute 184^2=33,856

4*92=368, 368*4371. Hmm, 368*4000=1,472,000, 368*371= let's compute 368*300=110,400, 368*71=26,128. So, 110,400 +26,128=136,528. So total 1,472,000 +136,528=1,608,528.

Thus, D=33,856 +1,608,528=1,642,384

sqrt(1,642,384). Let's see, 1280^2=1,638,400, 1285^2=1,651,225. So between 1280 and 1285. 1,642,384 -1,638,400=3,984. So, sqrt is approximately 1280 + 3,984/(2*1280)=approx 1280 + 1.55=1281.55. Not a whole number, so the quadratic doesn't factor nicely.

So, Term B is (x^2 -4x -12)(x^2 -16)*(92x^2 -184x -4371), which doesn't seem to factor further.

So, this is getting really complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Perhaps instead of expanding everything, maybe substitute a value for x that simplifies the equation? Maybe x = something that makes some denominators zero, but since we're looking for real roots, maybe it's better to consider the original equation.

Wait, the denominators are (x + 2)(x - 4), (x + 4)(x - 6), and (x + 6)(x - 8). So, the function is undefined at x = -6, -4, -2, 4, 6, 8.

So, the real roots must lie elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe try to see if the equation can be transformed into a quadratic or something.

Wait, maybe the equation is symmetrical in some way? Let's see.

Looking at the numerators:

First term numerator: (x +1)(x -3)

Second term: (x +3)(x -5)

Third term: 2(x +5)(x -7)

Hmm, each numerator is shifted by 2 in x. Similarly, denominators are also shifted by 2. So, perhaps if we let y = x + something.

Wait, let me try substituting z = x -1.

Then, x = z +1.

Let me see if that helps.

So, substituting:

First term numerator: (z +1 +1)(z +1 -3)= (z +2)(z -2)

Denominator: 5(z +1 +2)(z +1 -4)=5(z +3)(z -3)

Second term numerator: (z +1 +3)(z +1 -5)=(z +4)(z -4)

Denominator: 9(z +1 +4)(z +1 -6)=9(z +5)(z -5)

Third term numerator: 2(z +1 +5)(z +1 -7)=2(z +6)(z -6)

Denominator: 13(z +1 +6)(z +1 -8)=13(z +7)(z -7)

So, substituting z = x -1, the equation becomes:

[(z +2)(z -2)]/[5(z +3)(z -3)] + [(z +4)(z -4)]/[9(z +5)(z -5)] - [2(z +6)(z -6)]/[13(z +7)(z -7)] = 92/585.

Hmm, that seems like a similar pattern but shifted. Maybe that helps, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps noticing that (z + k)(z - k) = z^2 -k^2. So, maybe this can help.

So, Term1 becomes (z^2 -4)/[5(z^2 -9)]

Term2 becomes (z^2 -16)/[9(z^2 -25)]

Term3 becomes 2(z^2 -36)/[13(z^2 -49)]

So, equation:

(z^2 -4)/(5(z^2 -9)) + (z^2 -16)/(9(z^2 -25)) - 2(z^2 -36)/(13(z^2 -49)) = 92/585.

Hmm, that looks a bit better, but still complicated. Maybe we can let w = z^2.

So, let w = z^2. Then, equation becomes:

(w -4)/(5(w -9)) + (w -16)/(9(w -25)) - 2(w -36)/(13(w -49)) = 92/585.

So, we have an equation in terms of w:

A(w) + B(w) + C(w) = D.

Where:

A(w) = (w -4)/(5(w -9)),

B(w) = (w -16)/(9(w -25)),

C(w) = -2(w -36)/(13(w -49)),

D = 92/585.

So, perhaps this substitution will make it easier to handle.

Let me write the equation as:

[(w -4)/5(w -9)] + [(w -16)/9(w -25)] - [2(w -36)/13(w -49)] = 92/585.

So, to solve for w, let's combine these fractions.

First, find the common denominator.

Denominators are 5(w -9), 9(w -25), 13(w -49). So, the LCD is 5*9*13*(w -9)(w -25)(w -49). That's a big denominator, but let's proceed.

So, multiply each term by LCD:

Term1: [(w -4)/5(w -9)] * LCD = (w -4)*9*13*(w -25)(w -49)

Term2: [(w -16)/9(w -25)] * LCD = (w -16)*5*13*(w -9)(w -49)

Term3: [ -2(w -36)/13(w -49) ] * LCD = -2(w -36)*5*9*(w -9)(w -25)

Right-hand side: 92/585 * LCD = 92/585 * 5*9*13*(w -9)(w -25)(w -49)

Simplify the right-hand side:

585 = 5*9*13, so 92/585 * 5*9*13*(w -9)(w -25)(w -49) = 92*(w -9)(w -25)(w -49)

So, now, the equation becomes:

(w -4)*9*13*(w -25)(w -49) + (w -16)*5*13*(w -9)(w -49) -2(w -36)*5*9*(w -9)(w -25) = 92*(w -9)(w -25)(w -49)

Simplify coefficients:

First term: 9*13=117, so 117*(w -4)(w -25)(w -49)

Second term:5*13=65, so 65*(w -16)(w -9)(w -49)

Third term:2*5*9=90, with a negative sign: -90*(w -36)(w -9)(w -25)

Right-hand side:92*(w -9)(w -25)(w -49)

So, bringing everything to left-hand side:

117*(w -4)(w -25)(w -49) + 65*(w -16)(w -9)(w -49) -90*(w -36)(w -9)(w -25) -92*(w -9)(w -25)(w -49)=0

Hmm, this is still complicated. Maybe we can factor out some terms.

Looking at the first term: 117*(w -4)(w -25)(w -49)

Third term: -90*(w -36)(w -9)(w -25)

So, both have (w -25). Similarly, second term:65*(w -16)(w -9)(w -49). Fourth term: -92*(w -9)(w -25)(w -49). Both have (w -49) and (w -9).

Wait, let's see:

First term: (w -4)(w -25)(w -49)

Third term: (w -36)(w -9)(w -25)

So, both have (w -25). Similarly, second term: (w -16)(w -9)(w -49), fourth term: (w -9)(w -25)(w -49). So, second and fourth terms have (w -49)(w -9). So, perhaps we can factor (w -25) from first and third terms, and (w -9)(w -49) from second and fourth terms.

Wait, let's try:

Take first and third terms:

117*(w -4)(w -25)(w -49) -90*(w -36)(w -9)(w -25) = (w -25)[117*(w -4)(w -49) -90*(w -36)(w -9)]

Similarly, take second and fourth terms:

65*(w -16)(w -9)(w -49) -92*(w -9)(w -25)(w -49) = (w -9)(w -49)[65*(w -16) -92*(w -25)]

So, now, the equation is:

(w -25)[117*(w -4)(w -49) -90*(w -36)(w -9)] + (w -9)(w -49)[65*(w -16) -92*(w -25)] =0

So, this is:

Factor1*(Expression1) + Factor2*(Expression2)=0

Where Factor1=(w -25), Factor2=(w -9)(w -49)

Expression1=117*(w -4)(w -49) -90*(w -36)(w -9)

Expression2=65*(w -16) -92*(w -25)

So, let's compute Expression1 and Expression2.

Compute Expression1:

117*(w -4)(w -49) -90*(w -36)(w -9)

First, expand (w -4)(w -49):

= w^2 -49w -4w +196 = w^2 -53w +196

Multiply by 117:

117w^2 -53*117w +196*117

Compute 53*117: 53*100=5300, 53*17=901, so total 5300+901=6201

196*117: 196*100=19600, 196*17=3332, total 19600+3332=22932

So, 117w^2 -6201w +22932

Next, expand (w -36)(w -9):

= w^2 -9w -36w +324 = w^2 -45w +324

Multiply by 90:

90w^2 -45*90w +324*90

Compute 45*90=4050, 324*90=29160

So, 90w^2 -4050w +29160

So, Expression1= [117w^2 -6201w +22932] - [90w^2 -4050w +29160]

= 117w^2 -6201w +22932 -90w^2 +4050w -29160

= (117w^2 -90w^2) + (-6201w +4050w) + (22932 -29160)

= 27w^2 -2151w -6228

So, Expression1=27w^2 -2151w -6228

Similarly, compute Expression2:

65*(w -16) -92*(w -25)

=65w -1040 -92w +2300

= (65w -92w) + (-1040 +2300)

= -27w +1260

So, Expression2= -27w +1260

So, now, our equation becomes:

(w -25)*(27w^2 -2151w -6228) + (w -9)(w -49)*(-27w +1260)=0

Factor out 27 from Expression1 and Expression2:

Expression1=27w^2 -2151w -6228=27(w^2 - (2151/27)w -6228/27)=27(w^2 -79.666...w -230.666...). Hmm, messy.

Alternatively, perhaps factor 3:

27w^2 -2151w -6228= 3*(9w^2 -717w -2076)

Similarly, Expression2= -27w +1260= -3*(9w -420)

So, factoring 3:

Equation becomes:

(w -25)*3*(9w^2 -717w -2076) + (w -9)(w -49)*(-3)*(9w -420)=0

Factor out 3:

3[ (w -25)*(9w^2 -717w -2076) - (w -9)(w -49)*(9w -420) ] =0

So, divide both sides by 3:

(w -25)*(9w^2 -717w -2076) - (w -9)(w -49)*(9w -420)=0

Let me write this as:

Term A - Term B =0,

where

Term A= (w -25)*(9w^2 -717w -2076)

Term B= (w -9)(w -49)*(9w -420)

Let me compute Term A and Term B.

Compute Term A:

(w -25)*(9w^2 -717w -2076)

Multiply term by term:

= w*(9w^2 -717w -2076) -25*(9w^2 -717w -2076)

=9w^3 -717w^2 -2076w -225w^2 +17925w +51900

Combine like terms:

9w^3 + (-717w^2 -225w^2) + (-2076w +17925w) +51900

=9w^3 -942w^2 +15849w +51900

Now, compute Term B:

(w -9)(w -49)*(9w -420)

First, note that (9w -420) =9(w -420/9)=9(w -46.666...). Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, factor 3 out:

9w -420=3*(3w -140). Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, keep as is:

First, compute (w -9)(w -49)=w^2 -49w -9w +441=w^2 -58w +441

Then, multiply by (9w -420):

= w^2*(9w -420) -58w*(9w -420) +441*(9w -420)

Compute each term:

=9w^3 -420w^2 -522w^2 +24360w +3969w -183600

Combine like terms:

9w^3 + (-420w^2 -522w^2) + (24360w +3969w) -183600

=9w^3 -942w^2 +28329w -183600

So, Term B=9w^3 -942w^2 +28329w -183600

So, now, our equation is:

Term A - Term B=0

Which is:

[9w^3 -942w^2 +15849w +51900] - [9w^3 -942w^2 +28329w -183600]=0

Subtract Term B from Term A:

9w^3 -942w^2 +15849w +51900 -9w^3 +942w^2 -28329w +183600=0

Simplify:

(9w^3 -9w^3) + (-942w^2 +942w^2) + (15849w -28329w) + (51900 +183600)=0

Which simplifies to:

0w^3 +0w^2 -12480w +235500=0

So, equation reduces to:

-12480w +235500=0

So, solve for w:

-12480w +235500=0

=> 12480w =235500

=> w=235500 /12480

Simplify the fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10:23550 /1248

Divide numerator and denominator by 3:7850 /416

Divide numerator and denominator by 2:3925 /208

Check if 3925 and 208 have a common factor. 208=16*13. 3925 divided by 13: 3925 ÷13= 301.923... Not integer. 3925 ÷16= 245.3125. Not integer. So, 3925/208 is reduced.

So, w=3925/208.

Simplify, as a decimal: 3925 ÷208≈18.88

But let me compute it accurately:

208*18=3744

3925 -3744=181

So, w=18 +181/208≈18.874

So, w≈18.874

But since w = z^2 and z =x -1, so w must be positive, which it is.

So, w=3925/208.

Thus, z^2=3925/208.

So, z=±sqrt(3925/208). Compute sqrt(3925/208):

First, note that 3925=25*157, because 25*157=3925

208=16*13

So, sqrt(3925/208)=sqrt(25*157 /16*13)= (5/4)*sqrt(157/13)

Simplify sqrt(157/13)=sqrt(12.0769). Hmm, not a nice number. So, z=±(5/4)*sqrt(157/13)

But z =x -1, so x= z +1.

Thus, x=1 ±(5/4)*sqrt(157/13)

But let me rationalize sqrt(157/13):

sqrt(157/13)=sqrt(157)/sqrt(13)=sqrt(157)/sqrt(13). Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(13):

sqrt(157*13)/13= sqrt(2041)/13

So, sqrt(157/13)=sqrt(2041)/13

Thus, z=±(5/4)*(sqrt(2041)/13)=±(5 sqrt(2041))/(4*13)=±(5 sqrt(2041))/52

So, x=1 ±(5 sqrt(2041))/52

Wait, is this correct? Because w=3925/208, so z= sqrt(3925/208)=sqrt(3925)/sqrt(208)=sqrt(25*157)/sqrt(16*13)=5 sqrt(157)/4 sqrt(13)=5 sqrt(157/13)/4=5 sqrt(12.0769)/4≈5*3.476/4≈17.38/4≈4.345

Wait, earlier I had w≈18.874, which is approximately (4.345)^2≈18.87, so that checks out.

But the exact value is w=3925/208, so z=±sqrt(3925/208)=±sqrt(3925)/sqrt(208). But 3925=25*157, 208=16*13, so sqrt(3925)=5 sqrt(157), sqrt(208)=4 sqrt(13). So, sqrt(3925)/sqrt(208)=5 sqrt(157)/(4 sqrt(13))=5 sqrt(157/13)/4. Hence, as above.

So, x= z +1=1 ±5 sqrt(157/13)/4

But sqrt(157/13) is irrational, so perhaps we can write it as:

x=1 ±(5/4)sqrt(157/13)

But perhaps we can write sqrt(157/13)=sqrt(2041)/13, as above, so x=1 ±(5 sqrt(2041))/52

Alternatively, rationalize:

sqrt(157/13)=sqrt(157*13)/13= sqrt(2041)/13

So, 5/4 * sqrt(2041)/13=5 sqrt(2041)/(4*13)=5 sqrt(2041)/52

So, x=1 ±5 sqrt(2041)/52

But let me check if 2041 is a square or can be factored. 2041 ÷13= 157, since 13*157=2041. So, sqrt(2041)=sqrt(13*157). 157 is prime. So, yes, sqrt(2041)=sqrt(13*157). So, it cannot be simplified further.

So, the real roots are x=1 +5 sqrt(2041)/52 and x=1 -5 sqrt(2041)/52.

But let me compute 5/52≈0.09615, so 0.09615*sqrt(2041). sqrt(2041)=approx45.188, so 0.09615*45.188≈4.345.

So, x≈1 +4.345≈5.345 and x≈1 -4.345≈-3.345.

So, approximately, the real roots are x≈5.345 and x≈-3.345.

But let me check if these are actual roots, or if they introduced extraneous solutions during the algebra.

Wait, because when we multiplied both sides by the LCD, we might have introduced extraneous solutions, so we need to check if these x values satisfy the original equation.

But before that, let me note that in the original equation, denominators are (x +2)(x -4), (x +4)(x -6), and (x +6)(x -8). So, x cannot be -2,4, -4,6, -6,8.

Our solutions are x≈5.345 and x≈-3.345, which are not among the excluded values, so that's good.

But let me verify with the approximate values.

First, let me compute left-hand side (LHS) at x≈5.345.

Compute each term:

First term: (x +1)(x -3)/[(x +2)(x -4)]

x≈5.345

Compute numerator: (5.345 +1)(5.345 -3)=6.345*2.345≈14.88

Denominator: (5.345 +2)(5.345 -4)=7.345*1.345≈9.84

So, first term≈14.88/9.84≈1.512

Second term: (x +3)(x -5)/[(x +4)(x -6)]

Numerator: (5.345 +3)(5.345 -5)=8.345*0.345≈2.87

Denominator: (5.345 +4)(5.345 -6)=9.345*(-0.655)≈-6.12

So, second term≈2.87/(-6.12)≈-0.47

Third term:2(x +5)(x -7)/[(x +6)(x -8)]

Numerator:2*(5.345 +5)(5.345 -7)=2*10.345*(-1.655)≈2*(-17.13)≈-34.26

Denominator: (5.345 +6)(5.345 -8)=11.345*(-2.655)≈-30.19

Third term≈-34.26/(-30.19)≈1.134

So, total LHS≈1.512 -0.47 +1.134≈1.512 +0.664≈2.176

But the right-hand side (RHS) is 92/585≈0.157

Wait, 2.176 is not equal to≈0.157. So, something's wrong here. So, my approximate solution is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait, in the original equation, when I substituted z =x -1, so x= z +1, and then w=z^2, so w=3925/208≈18.874. So, z≈±4.345.

But z =x -1, so x=1 ±4.345, which is 5.345 or -3.345.

But when I plug x≈5.345 into LHS, it's nowhere near RHS≈0.157.

Similarly, plug x≈-3.345:

Compute LHS:

First term: (x +1)(x -3)/[(x +2)(x -4)]

x≈-3.345

Numerator: (-3.345 +1)(-3.345 -3)=(-2.345)(-6.345)≈14.88

Denominator: (-3.345 +2)(-3.345 -4)=(-1.345)(-7.345)≈9.84

First term≈14.88/9.84≈1.512

Second term: (x +3)(x -5)/[(x +4)(x -6)]

Numerator: (-3.345 +3)(-3.345 -5)=(-0.345)(-8.345)≈2.87

Denominator: (-3.345 +4)(-3.345 -6)=(0.655)(-9.345)≈-6.12

Second term≈2.87/(-6.12)≈-0.47

Third term:2(x +5)(x -7)/[(x +6)(x -8)]

Numerator:2*(-3.345 +5)*(-3.345 -7)=2*(1.655)*(-10.345)≈2*(-17.13)≈-34.26

Denominator: (-3.345 +6)*(-3.345 -8)=(2.655)*(-11.345)≈-30.19

Third term≈-34.26/(-30.19)≈1.134

So, LHS≈1.512 -0.47 +1.134≈2.176, same as before. So, same problem.

So, my solutions are incorrect. That suggests that somewhere, my algebra is wrong.

Wait, but we had an equation that reduced to -12480w +235500=0, which gave w=235500/12480≈18.874, which led to z≈±4.345, x≈5.345 or -3.345.

But plugging back into the original equation, we don't get equality. So, perhaps I made an error in simplifying the equation.

Let me check the step where I subtracted Term B from Term A. Maybe I made a mistake in expanding.

So, Term A:9w^3 -942w^2 +15849w +51900

Term B:9w^3 -942w^2 +28329w -183600

So, A - B:

(9w^3 -942w^2 +15849w +51900) - (9w^3 -942w^2 +28329w -183600)

=9w^3 -942w^2 +15849w +51900 -9w^3 +942w^2 -28329w +183600

So, 9w^3 -9w^3=0

-942w^2 +942w^2=0

15849w -28329w= -12480w

51900 +183600=235500

Thus, A - B= -12480w +235500=0, which is correct.

Therefore, w=235500 /12480=2355/124.8= approx18.874.

So, correct.

So, why does plugging back in not satisfy the equation?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in substituting back. Let me try plugging x=1 +5 sqrt(2041)/52 into the original equation more accurately.

First, compute x=1 +5 sqrt(2041)/52≈1 +5*45.188/52≈1 +225.94/52≈1 +4.345≈5.345.

Wait, but maybe I should compute more accurately.

Compute x=1 +5 sqrt(2041)/52.

sqrt(2041)=approx45.188

5*45.188=225.94

225.94/52≈4.345

So, x≈5.345

Compute each term:

First term: (x +1)(x -3)/[(x +2)(x -4)]

x=5.345

x +1=6.345

x -3=2.345

x +2=7.345

x -4=1.345

So, numerator=6.345*2.345≈14.88

Denominator=7.345*1.345≈9.84

So, first term≈14.88/9.84≈1.512

Second term: (x +3)(x -5)/[(x +4)(x -6)]

x +3=8.345

x -5=0.345

x +4=9.345

x -6=-0.655

Numerator=8.345*0.345≈2.87

Denominator=9.345*(-0.655)≈-6.12

Second term≈2.87/(-6.12)≈-0.47

Third term:2(x +5)(x -7)/[(x +6)(x -8)]

x +5=10.345

x -7=-1.655

x +6=11.345

x -8=-2.655

Numerator=2*(10.345*(-1.655))≈2*(-17.13)≈-34.26

Denominator=11.345*(-2.655)≈-30.19

Third term≈-34.26/(-30.19)≈1.134

So, total LHS≈1.512 -0.47 +1.134≈2.176

Which is not equal to RHS≈0.157.

Hmm, so the solution is extraneous.

Similarly, plug in x≈-3.345:

First term: (x +1)(x -3)/[(x +2)(x -4)]

x≈-3.345

x +1≈-2.345

x -3≈-6.345

x +2≈-1.345

x -4≈-7.345

Numerator≈(-2.345)*(-6.345)≈14.88

Denominator≈(-1.345)*(-7.345)≈9.84

First term≈14.88/9.84≈1.512

Second term: (x +3)(x -5)/[(x +4)(x -6)]

x≈-3.345

x +3≈-0.345

x -5≈-8.345

x +4≈0.655

x -6≈-9.345

Numerator≈(-0.345)*(-8.345)≈2.87

Denominator≈0.655*(-9.345)≈-6.12

Second term≈2.87/(-6.12)≈-0.47

Third term:2(x +5)(x -7)/[(x +6)(x -8)]

x≈-3.345

x +5≈1.655

x -7≈-10.345

x +6≈2.655

x -8≈-11.345

Numerator≈2*(1.655)*(-10.345)≈2*(-17.13)≈-34.26

Denominator≈2.655*(-11.345)≈-30.19

Third term≈-34.26/(-30.19)≈1.134

Total LHS≈1.512 -0.47 +1.134≈2.176, same as before.

But RHS≈0.157. So, something is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign when subtracting Term B.

Wait, Term A - Term B=0, which is correct.

Wait, but when I went back, I didn't consider that when I substituted, I had the equation:

(w -9)*(27w^2 -2151w -6228) - (w -9)(w -49)(-27w +1260)=0

Wait, so perhaps there is a common factor (w -9). So, perhaps I can factor (w -9) from the equation.

So, equation becomes:

(w -9)[27w^2 -2151w -6228 - (w -49)(-27w +1260)]=0

So, either w=9 or the other factor is zero.

So, w=9 is a solution.

So, w=9.

So, z^2=9, so z=±3.

Therefore, x= z +1=1 ±3, so x=4 or x=-2.

But x=4 and x=-2 are excluded values because denominators become zero in the original equation. So, x=4 and x=-2 are extraneous. So, the only solution from this factor is x=4 or x=-2, but both are excluded.

So, the other factor is:

27w^2 -2151w -6228 - (w -49)(-27w +1260)=0

Wait, but earlier I tried expanding and it led to a contradiction.

Wait, but actually, when we factor (w -9), the equation is:

(w -9)*[27w^2 -2151w -6228 - (w -49)(-27w +1260)]=0

So, if we compute the bracket:

27w^2 -2151w -6228 - (w -49)(-27w +1260)=0

Let me compute (w -49)(-27w +1260):

= -27w^2 +1260w +1323w -62280

= -27w^2 +2583w -62280

So, the bracket becomes:

27w^2 -2151w -6228 - (-27w^2 +2583w -62280)

=27w^2 -2151w -6228 +27w^2 -2583w +62280

=54w^2 -4734w +56052

So, equation is:

(w -9)*(54w^2 -4734w +56052)=0

Set equal to zero:

Either w=9, which we saw, or 54w^2 -4734w +56052=0.

Simplify 54w^2 -4734w +56052=0.

Divide by 54:

w^2 - (4734/54)w + (56052/54)=0

Simplify:

4734 ÷54=87.666...=87 and 2/3=263/3

56052 ÷54=1038.

Thus, equation is:

w^2 - (263/3)w +1038=0

Multiply through by 3:

3w^2 -263w +3114=0

Use quadratic formula:

w=(263 ±sqrt(263^2 -4*3*3114))/6

Compute discriminant:

263^2=69169

4*3*3114=12*3114=37368

So, discriminant=69169 -37368=31801

sqrt(31801). Let me see, 178^2=31684, 179^2=32041, so sqrt(31801)=178.5 approximately. But 178.5^2=31862.25, which is higher. So, not a perfect square. So, the roots are:

w=(263 ±sqrt(31801))/6

So, w≈(263 ±178.5)/6

Compute both:

w≈(263 +178.5)/6≈441.5/6≈73.583

w≈(263 -178.5)/6≈84.5/6≈14.083

So, w≈73.583, 14.083, and 9.

So, w=9, and w≈73.583,14.083.

So, since w=z^2, so z=±sqrt(w).

So, z=±sqrt(73.583)≈±8.578

z=±sqrt(14.083)≈±3.753

So, z=±8.578, ±3.753

Hence, x=z +1.

So, x≈1 ±8.578≈9.578 or -7.578

x≈1 ±3.753≈4.753 or -2.753

But x=4, x=-2, x=8 are excluded, but these solutions are near but not equal to excluded points.

So, approximately, x≈9.578, -7.578,4.753, -2.753

But wait, the original equation is undefined at x= -6,-4,-2,4,6,8. So, x≈-7.578 is near -6, so not excluded. x≈-2.753 is near -2, which is excluded, but not exactly. x≈4.753 is near 4, which is excluded, but not exactly. x≈9.578 is okay.

But wait, when we plug x≈9.578 into the original equation, will it satisfy?

Wait, let me test x=9.578.

Compute each term:

First term: (x +1)(x -3)/[(x +2)(x -4)]

x≈9.578

x +1≈10.578

x -3≈6.578

x +2≈11.578

x -4≈5.578

Numerator≈10.578*6.578≈70.0

Denominator≈11.578*5.578≈64.5

First term≈70/64.5≈1.084

Second term: (x +3)(x -5)/[(x +4)(x -6)]

x≈9.578

x +3≈12.578

x -5≈4.578

x +4≈13.578

x -6≈3.578

Numerator≈12.578*4.578≈57.4

Denominator≈13.578*3.578≈48.4

Second term≈57.4/48.4≈1.185

Third term:2(x +5)(x -7)/[(x +6)(x -8)]

x≈9.578

x +5≈14.578

x -7≈2.578

x +6≈15.578

x -8≈1.578

Numerator≈2*14.578*2.578≈2*37.59≈75.18

Denominator≈15.578*1.578≈24.47

Third term≈75.18/24.47≈3.07

So, total LHS≈1.084 +1.185 +3.07≈5.339

RHS=92/585≈0.157

Not close.

Similarly, x≈-7.578:

First term: (x +1)(x -3)/[(x +2)(x -4)]

x≈-7.578

x +1≈-6.578

x -3≈-10.578

x +2≈-5.578

x -4≈-11.578

Numerator≈(-6.578)*(-10.578)≈70.0

Denominator≈(-5.578)*(-11.578)≈64.5

First term≈70/64.5≈1.084

Second term: (x +3)(x -5)/[(x +4)(x -6)]

x≈-7.578

x +3≈-4.578

x -5≈-12.578

x +4≈-3.578

x -6≈-13.578

Numerator≈(-4.578)*(-12.578)≈57.4

Denominator≈(-3.578)*(-13.578)≈48.4

Second term≈57.4/48.4≈1.185

Third term:2(x +5)(x -7)/[(x +6)(x -8)]

x≈-7.578

x +5≈-2.578

x -7≈-12.578

x +6≈-1.578

x -8≈-15.578

Numerator≈2*(-2.578)*(-12.578)≈2*32.4≈64.8

Denominator≈(-1.578)*(-15.578)≈24.47

Third term≈64.8/24.47≈2.646

So, total LHS≈1.084 +1.185 +2.646≈4.915, still not 0.157.

Similarly, x≈4.753:

First term: (4.753 +1)(4.753 -3)/[(4.753 +2)(4.753 -4)]

=5.753*1.753 / [6.753*0.753]

≈10.08 /5.08≈1.984

Second term: (4.753 +3)(4.753 -5)/[(4.753 +4)(4.753 -6)]

=7.753*(-0.247)/[8.753*(-1.247)]

≈(-1.91)/[ -10.89]≈0.176

Third term:2*(4.753 +5)(4.753 -7)/[(4.753 +6)(4.753 -8)]

=2*(9.753)*(-2.247)/[10.753*(-3.247)]

≈2*(-21.9)/[ -34.99]≈(-43.8)/(-34.99)≈1.25

So, total≈1.984 +0.176 +1.25≈3.41, not 0.157

x≈-2.753:

First term: (-2.753 +1)(-2.753 -3)/[(-2.753 +2)(-2.753 -4)]

=(-1.753)*(-5.753)/[(-0.753)*(-6.753)]

≈10.08 /5.08≈1.984

Second term: (-2.753 +3)(-2.753 -5)/[(-2.753 +4)(-2.753 -6)]

=0.247*(-7.753)/[1.247*(-8.753)]

≈(-1.91)/[ -10.89]≈0.176

Third term:2*(-2.753 +5)*(-2.753 -7)/[(-2.753 +6)*(-2.753 -8)]

=2*(2.247)*(-9.753)/[3.247*(-10.753)]

≈2*(-21.9)/[ -34.99]≈(-43.8)/(-34.99)≈1.25

Total≈1.984 +0.176 +1.25≈3.41, same as before.

So, none of these approximate solutions satisfy the original equation. Therefore, perhaps the solutions are complex? But no, the original equation is a rational equation with real coefficients, so complex solutions would come in pairs, but since we are asked for real roots, maybe there are no real roots? But that contradicts the approximate solutions.

Wait, but maybe during the algebra, I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, let me double-check the expansion of Term A - Term B.

Term A:9w^3 -942w^2 +15849w +51900

Term B:9w^3 -942w^2 +28329w -183600

So, A - B= 0w^3 +0w^2 + (15849 -28329)w + (51900 +183600)= (-12480)w +235500=0.

Yes, correct.

So, w=235500 /12480=2355 /124.8≈18.874.

Thus, real solution is w≈18.874, hence z≈sqrt(18.874)=approx4.345, x≈5.345 or -3.345.

But when I plug x≈5.345 and x≈-3.345 into the original equation, it does not satisfy.

Wait, could the error be in the approximated calculations?

Wait, let me try x=1 +5 sqrt(2041)/52 numerically, using more precise calculation.

Compute sqrt(2041)=approx45.1881.

5*45.1881=225.9405.

225.9405/52≈4.345.

So, x=1 +4.345≈5.345.

Compute each term more precisely.

First term: (5.345 +1)(5.345 -3)/[(5.345 +2)(5.345 -4)]

=(6.345)(2.345)/[(7.345)(1.345)]

Compute numerator:6.345*2.345≈6.345*2 +6.345*0.345≈12.69 +2.18≈14.87

Denominator:7.345*1.345≈7*1.345 +0.345*1.345≈9.415 +0.463≈9.878

First term≈14.87/9.878≈1.503

Second term: (5.345 +3)(5.345 -5)/[(5.345 +4)(5.345 -6)]

=(8.345)(0.345)/[(9.345)(-0.655)]

Numerator≈8.345*0.345≈2.874

Denominator≈9.345*(-0.655)≈-6.123

Second term≈2.874/(-6.123)≈-0.470

Third term:2*(5.345 +5)(5.345 -7)/[(5.345 +6)(5.345 -8)]

=(10.345)(-1.655)/[(11.345)(-2.655)]

Numerator≈10.345*(-1.655)≈-17.13

Denominator≈11.345*(-2.655)≈-30.19

Third term≈-17.13 / -30.19≈0.567

Thus, total LHS≈1.503 -0.470 +0.567≈1.503 +0.097≈1.600

Hmm, which is approximately 1.6, not 0.157.

Wait, but 1.6 is about 10 times larger than RHS.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the expansion.

Wait, let me re-express the original equation:

[(x +1)(x -3)] / [(x +2)(x -4)] + [(x +3)(x -5)] / [(x +4)(x -6)] + 2[(x +5)(x -7)] / [(x +6)(x -8)] = 92/585

Wait, 92/585≈0.157.

But when I plug x≈5.345, I get LHS≈1.6, which is way off. So, maybe my approach was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial cross-multiplication step.

Wait, cross-multiplying the entire equation:

[(x +1)(x -3)/((x +2)(x -4)) ] + [(x +3)(x -5)/((x +4)(x -6)) ] + [2(x +5)(x -7)/((x +6)(x -8)) ] = 92/585

Multiply both sides by LCD= (x +2)(x -4)(x +4)(x -6)(x +6)(x -8)

So:

Term A + Term B + Term C= (92/585)*LCD

Where Term A=(x +1)(x -3)(x +4)(x -6)(x +6)(x -8)

Term B=(x +3)(x -5)(x +2)(x -4)(x +6)(x -8)

Term C=2(x +5)(x -7)(x +2)(x -4)(x +4)(x -6)

So, the equation is Term A + Term B + Term C= (92/585)*(x +2)(x -4)(x +4)(x -6)(x +6)(x -8)

But perhaps in my previous calculation, I neglected to multiply Term C by 2 when simplifying? Wait, no, in my previous steps, I correctly included the factor of 2 in Term C.

Wait, actually, when I moved all terms to one side, it was:

Term A + Term B + Term C - (92/585)*LCD=0

But in reality, when I moved (92/585)*LCD to the left, it's Term A + Term B + Term C - (92/585)*LCD=0

But when I computed, I set Term A + Term B + Term C =0, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, actually, in the initial steps, I set:

Term A + Term B + Term C - (92/585)*LCD=0

Which is correct.

But when I multiplied both sides by LCD, I should have:

Term A + Term B + Term C - (92/585)*LCD=0

Which is equivalent to:

Term A + Term B + Term C = (92/585)*LCD

Then, to eliminate denominators, I multiplied both sides by LCD, but when I did that, I set:

Term A + Term B + Term C - (92/585)*LCD=0

But that is incorrect.

Wait, no, actually, no. Let me re-express.

Wait, actually, the equation is:

[Term A + Term B + Term C]/LCD =92/585

Which implies:

Term A + Term B + Term C = (92/585)*LCD

Then, when I multiplied both sides by LCD, I get:

Term A + Term B + Term C - (92/585)*LCD=0

Which is correct.

But when I computed Term A + Term B + Term C, it was equal to -12480w +235500, which led to w=235500 /12480=23550/1248= approx18.874.

Thus, w≈18.874, which leads to x≈5.345 or -3.345.

But when plugging x≈5.345 back into the original equation, it does not satisfy. So, perhaps my initial steps are incorrect.

Wait, let me compute the original equation with x=5.345 more precisely.

First term:

(x +1)(x -3)/((x +2)(x -4))=(6.345)(2.345)/((7.345)(1.345))

Compute numerator:6.345*2.345

Compute 6*2.345=14.07, 0.345*2.345≈0.807, total≈14.07 +0.807≈14.877

Denominator:7.345*1.345

7*1.345=9.415, 0.345*1.345≈0.463, total≈9.415 +0.463≈9.878

So, first term≈14.877/9.878≈1.503

Second term:

(x +3)(x -5)/((x +4)(x -6))=(8.345)(-0.655)/((9.345)(-2.655))

Numerator:8.345*(-0.655)≈-5.464

Denominator:9.345*(-2.655)≈-24.834

Second term≈-5.464 / -24.834≈0.220

Third term:

2*(x +5)(x -7)/((x +6)(x -8))=2*(10.345)(-1.655)/((11.345)(-3.255))

Compute numerator:2*(10.345)(-1.655)≈2*(-17.13)≈-34.26

Denominator:11.345*(-3.255)≈-36.81

Third term≈-34.26 / -36.81≈0.931

So, total LHS≈1.503 +0.220 +0.931≈2.654

Which is still not equal to RHS≈0.157.

Wait, but when I computed Term A + Term B + Term C, I had:

Term A + Term B + Term C = -12480w +235500

But this is equal to (92/585)*LCD

But LCD= (x +2)(x -4)(x +4)(x -6)(x +6)(x -8)

But w= z^2=x^2 -4x +3

So, LCD can be written in terms of w.

But perhaps instead of substituting, let me compute LCD at x=5.345.

Compute each factor:

x +2=7.345

x -4=1.345

x +4=9.345

x -6=-0.655

x +6=11.345

x -8=-2.655

So, LCD=7.345*1.345*9.345*(-0.655)*11.345*(-2.655)

But since there's an even number of negative factors, LCD is positive.

Compute step by step:

7.345*1.345≈9.878

9.878*9.345≈92.219

92.219*(-0.655)≈-60.413

-60.413*11.345≈-686.25

-686.25*(-2.655)≈1827.9

So, LCD≈1827.9

Thus, (92/585)*LCD≈(0.157)*1827.9≈286.8

But Term A + Term B + Term C= -12480w +235500

At w=18.874,

-12480*18.874 +235500≈-235,501 +235500≈-1

But (92/585)*LCD≈286.8

So, -1≈286.8? That's not correct.

Wait, so my earlier computation is inconsistent.

Wait, in reality, Term A + Term B + Term C = (92/585)*LCD

But according to my substitution, Term A + Term B + Term C = -12480w +235500

But if I compute (92/585)*LCD, it's not equal to that.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, the equation was:

(Term A + Term B + Term C) = (92/585)*LCD

But when I set Term A + Term B + Term C = -12480w +235500, that's not equal to (92/585)*LCD.

Wait, LCD is a function of x, which is related to w.

So, perhaps I cannot equate Term A + Term B + Term C as a function of w, because LCD is a function of x, which is a function of w.

But in reality, the equation is Term A + Term B + Term C - (92/585)*LCD=0

But Term A + Term B + Term C= -12480w +235500

So, the equation is:

-12480w +235500 - (92/585)*LCD=0

But LCD is a function of x, which is z +1, and z^2=w.

So, unless LCD can be expressed in terms of w, which is complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can relate LCD to w.

But this seems too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.

Maybe instead of substituting w=z^2, let me consider that the equation is:

[ (x+1)(x-3) / (x+2)(x-4) ] + [ (x+3)(x-5) / (x+4)(x-6) ] + [2(x+5)(x-7) / (x+6)(x-8) ] = 92/585

Let me denote each fraction as follows:

Let me compute each fraction separately:

First fraction: (x+1)(x-3)/((x+2)(x-4)) = [x^2 -2x -3]/[x^2 -2x -8]

Second fraction: (x+3)(x-5)/[(x+4)(x-6)] = [x^2 -2x -15]/[x^2 -2x -24]

Third fraction: 2(x+5)(x-7)/[(x+6)(x-8)] = 2[x^2 -2x -35]/[x^2 -2x -48]

Let me denote y = x^2 -2x

Then each fraction becomes:

First: (y -3)/(y -8)

Second: (y -15)/(y -24)

Third: 2(y -35)/(y -48)

So, the equation becomes:

(y -3)/(y -8) + (y -15)/(y -24) + 2(y -35)/(y -48) = 92/585

This seems simpler.

Let me write:

A = (y -3)/(y -8)

B = (y -15)/(y -24)

C = 2(y -35)/(y -48)

So, A + B + C =92/585

Now, let me compute A + B + C:

A + B + C = (y -3)/(y -8) + (y -15)/(y -24) + 2(y -35)/(y -48)

Let me compute each term:

First term: (y -3)/(y -8) = 1 + 5/(y -8)

Second term: (y -15)/(y -24)=1 +9/(y -24)

Third term:2(y -35)/(y -48)=2 + 2*(1/(y -48))

Thus, A + B + C=1 +5/(y -8) +1 +9/(y -24)+2 +2/(y -48)=4 +5/(y -8)+9/(y -24)+2/(y -48)

So, the equation becomes:

4 +5/(y -8)+9/(y -24)+2/(y -48)=92/585

Simplify:

5/(y -8) +9/(y -24) +2/(y -48)=92/585 -4= (92 -2340)/585= (-2248)/585≈-3.846

So, equation:

5/(y -8) +9/(y -24) +2/(y -48)= -2248/585≈-3.846

Now, perhaps find a common denominator.

Compute denominators: (y -8), (y -24), (y -48). They are in arithmetic progression with difference 16.

Let me let u = y -24. Then, y -8= u +16, y -24=u, y -48=u -16.

Thus, equation becomes:

5/(u +16) +9/u +2/(u -16)= -2248/585

So, equation:

5/(u +16) +9/u +2/(u -16)= -2248/585

Let me compute the left-hand side.

Find common denominator: u(u +16)(u -16)

So,

5u(u -16) +9(u +16)(u -16) +2u(u +16) all over u(u +16)(u -16)

Compute numerator:

5u(u -16)=5u^2 -80u

9(u +16)(u -16)=9(u^2 -256)=9u^2 -2304

2u(u +16)=2u^2 +32u

Sum all:

5u^2 -80u +9u^2 -2304 +2u^2 +32u= (5u^2 +9u^2 +2u^2) + (-80u +32u) + (-2304)

=16u^2 -48u -2304

So, equation:

(16u^2 -48u -2304)/[u(u +16)(u -16)]= -2248/585

Cross-multiply:

(16u^2 -48u -2304)*585= -2248*u(u +16)(u -16)

Compute both sides.

Left side:

585*(16u^2 -48u -2304)=585*16u^2 -585*48u -585*2304

Compute:

585*16=9360

585*48=27840

585*2304=585*(2000 +304)=585*2000 +585*304=1,170,000 +177,720=1,347,720

So, left side=9360u^2 -27840u -1,347,720

Right side:

-2248*u(u +16)(u -16)

First, compute (u +16)(u -16)=u^2 -256

Then, multiply by u: u^3 -256u

Multiply by -2248: -2248u^3 +576,768u

So, right side= -2248u^3 +576,768u

Thus, equation:

9360u^2 -27840u -1,347,720 = -2248u^3 +576,768u

Bring all terms to left:

2248u^3 +9360u^2 -27840u -576,768u -1,347,720=0

Combine like terms:

2248u^3 +9360u^2 +(-27840 -576,768)u -1,347,720=0

Compute coefficients:

2248u^3 +9360u^2 -604,608u -1,347,720=0

Now, factor out common factor:

All coefficients are divisible by 4?

2248 ÷4=562, 9360 ÷4=2340, 604,608 ÷4=151,152, 1,347,720 ÷4=336,930

So, equation becomes:

562u^3 +2340u^2 -151,152u -336,930=0

Check if divisible by 2:

562 ÷2=281, 2340 ÷2=1170, 151,152 ÷2=75,576, 336,930 ÷2=168,465

Equation:

281u^3 +1170u^2 -75,576u -168,465=0

Check if rational roots.

Possible rational roots are factors of 168,465 divided by factors of 281.

Factors of 168,465: 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 75, 105, etc.

But 281 is a prime number (I think), so possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±5, etc., over 1 or 281.

Test u=3:

281*27 +1170*9 -75,576*3 -168,465

=7587 +10,530 -226,728 -168,465

Wait, this is getting too big, perhaps u= -5:

= -35,125 +29,250 +377,880 -168,465

Alternatively, maybe u= 15:

Wait, tried u=15, didn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps u= -15:

281*(-3375) +1170*225 -75,576*(-15) -168,465

= -948,375 +263,250 +1,133,640 -168,465

Alternatively, maybe u= 105:

Too big.

Alternatively, maybe u= something else.

Alternatively, perhaps factor:

The equation is 281u^3 +1170u^2 -75,576u -168,465=0

This seems very difficult to factor.

Alternatively, use rational root theorem, but since it's time-consuming, perhaps use substitution.

Alternatively, use numerical methods.

Alternatively, maybe graphing or using approximation.

Alternatively, since this is getting too complicated, perhaps consider that the equation only has two real solutions, and previously when I tried plugging x≈5.345, which is w≈18.874, which gives z≈4.345, then x=1 +z≈5.345, but when I plug in, it doesn't satisfy. So, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is designed in such a way that x=5 and x=-3 are roots, but they are excluded.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the initial substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the only solution is x=5 and x=-3, but they are excluded. Thus, the equation has no real roots.

But in the original equation, the denominators exclude x=-6,-4,-2,4,6,8.

But if the equation reduces to something with two real roots, but our approximate solutions don't satisfy, perhaps the equation has no real roots.

But that seems unlikely, as the problem asks for real roots.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation has two real roots.

Alternatively, maybe my approach is wrong. Let me try another method.

Let me consider the substitution x = y -1, so that the equation becomes:

Let me set x = y -1, so y =x +1.

Then, x +1=y, x -3=y -4, x +2=y +1, x -4=y -6, x +4=y +3, x -6=y -7, x +5=y +4, x -7=y -6.

So, equation becomes:

(y)/(y +1) + (y -4)/(y -6) + 2(y +4)/(y -6) = 92/585

Wait, wait:

Wait, first term: (x +1)/(x +2) = y/(y +1)

Second term: (x +3)/(x -4)= (y -2)/(y -6)

Third term: 2(x +5)/(x -6)=2(y +4)/(y -6)

Wait, so equation is:

y/(y +1) + (y -2)/(y -6) + 2(y +4)/(y -6)=92/585

Wait, so second term and third term have same denominator.

So, let me combine them:

(y -2 + 2(y +4))/(y -6) + y/(y +1)=92/585

Compute numerator:

y -2 +2y +8=3y +6

So, equation:

(3y +6)/(y -6) + y/(y +1)=92/585

Simplify:

Factor numerator: 3(y +2)/(y -6) + y/(y +1)=92/585

Let me compute this:

Let me denote A = 3(y +2)/(y -6), B = y/(y +1), so A + B=92/585

Compute A - B:

3(y +2)/(y -6) - y/(y +1)= [3(y +2)(y +1) - y(y -6)] / (y -6)(y +1)

Compute numerator:

3(y^2 +3y +2) - (y^2 -6y)=3y^2 +9y +6 -y^2 +6y=2y^2 +15y +6

So, A - B=(2y^2 +15y +6)/[(y -6)(y +1)]

But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, let me cross multiply.

Let me write equation:

[3(y +2)/(y -6)] + [y/(y +1)] =92/585

Multiply both sides by (y -6)(y +1):

3(y +2)(y +1) + y(y -6)= (92/585)(y -6)(y +1)

Compute left side:

3(y^2 +3y +2) + y^2 -6y=3y^2 +9y +6 +y^2 -6y=4y^2 +3y +6

Right side:

(92/585)(y^2 -5y -6)

Multiply both sides by 585 to eliminate denominator:

585*(4y^2 +3y +6)=92*(y^2 -5y -6)

Compute:

Left: 2340y^2 +1755y +3510

Right:92y^2 -460y -552

Bring all terms to left:

2340y^2 +1755y +3510 -92y^2 +460y +552=0

Compute:

2340y^2 -92y^2=2248y^2

1755y +460y=2215y

3510 +552=4062

So, equation:

2248y^2 +2215y +4062=0

Quadratic equation:2248y^2 +2215y +4062=0

Compute discriminant:

D=2215^2 -4*2248*4062

Compute 2215^2:

2215*2215: let me compute:

2000^2=4,000,000

2*2000*215=860,000

215^2=46,225

Thus, (2000 +215)^2=4,000,000 +860,000 +46,225=4,906,225

Now, 4*2248*4062:

First, compute 4*2248=8992

Then, 8992*4062: compute 8992*4000=35,968,000, 8992*62=557,504

So, total=35,968,000 +557,504=36,525,504

Thus, discriminant D=4,906,225 -36,525,504= -31,619,279

Negative discriminant, so no real solutions for y. Therefore, original equation has no real solutions.

But that contradicts the problem statement which asks for real roots.

Therefore, perhaps made an error in substitution.

Wait, the initial equation is:

[(x +1)(x -3)] / [(x +2)(x -4)] + [(x +3)(x -5)] / [(x +4)(x -6)] + 2[(x +5)(x -7)] / [(x +6)(x -8)] = 92/585

When I set x = y -1, got to y equation with negative discriminant.

But perhaps my substitution was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is designed such that it has complex roots, but problem statement says real roots.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me verify the substitution.

Wait, x = y -1:

First term: (x +1)/(x +2) = (y)/(y +1)

Second term: (x +3)/(x -4)= (y -2)/(y -6)

Third term: 2*(x +5)/(x -6)=2*(y +4)/(y -6)

So, equation is y/(y +1) + (y -2)/(y -6) + 2(y +4)/(y -6)=92/585

Combine second and third terms:

(y -2 + 2y +8)/(y -6)= (3y +6)/(y -6)=3(y +2)/(y -6)

So, equation is:

y/(y +1) + 3(y +2)/(y -6)=92/585

So, equation becomes:

y/(y +1) + 3(y +2)/(y -6)=92/585

Let me compute this:

Multiply both sides by (y +1)(y -6):

y(y -6) +3(y +2)(y +1)= (92/585)(y +1)(y -6)

Compute left side:

y^2 -6y +3(y^2 +3y +2)=y^2 -6y +3y^2 +9y +6=4y^2 +3y +6

Right side:

(92/585)(y^2 -5y -6)

Multiply both sides by 585:

585*(4y^2 +3y +6)=92*(y^2 -5y -6)

Compute:

Left:2340y^2 +1755y +3510

Right:92y^2 -460y -552

Bring all terms to left:

2340y^2 -92y^2 +1755y +460y +3510 +552=0

Compute:

2248y^2 +2215y +4062=0

Which is same as before.

Thus, same equation, discriminant negative.

Therefore, no real solutions.

But the problem says "find all real roots", so perhaps the problem is designed incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in initial cross-multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation has real roots, but my substitution missed something.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider that since the equation reduces to 2244z^2 -9224 - (92/585)z=0, which is quadratic in z, but discriminant negative, so no real solutions.

Therefore, equation has no real roots.

But the problem says "find all real roots", so must have real roots.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in cross-multiplication.

Alternatively, the original equation may have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation was meant to have a solution when denominators are factored differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if x= -3/2 is a root.

Wait, let me compute the left side at x= -3/2:

First term: (-1.5 +1)/(-1.5 +2)=(-0.5)/(0.5)= -1

Second term: (-1.5 +3)/(-1.5 -4)=1.5/-5.5≈-0.2727

Third term:2*(-1.5 +5)/(-1.5 -6)=2*(3.5)/(-7.5)=7/-7.5≈-0.9333

Sum≈-1 -0.2727 -0.9333≈-2.206, which is not equal to 0.157.

Alternatively, x=5/2:

First term: (5.5 +1)/(5.5 +2)=6.5/7.5≈0.8667

Second term: (5.5 +3)/(5.5 -4)=8.5/1.5≈5.6667

Third term:2*(5.5 +5)/(5.5 -6)=2*(10.5)/(-0.5)=21/-0.5=-42

Sum≈0.8667 +5.6667 -42≈-35.4666≠0.157

Alternatively, x=1 - sqrt(3480)/52≈1 - 29.14≈-28.14, which is excluded.

Wait, maybe the equation is designed with complex roots, but the problem says real roots.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in cross-multiplication.

Wait, in the initial step, when I moved all terms to one side, I had:

Term A + Term B + Term C = 92/585

Then, I multiplied both sides by LCD to get rid of denominators, leading to:

-12480w +235500 +1484900 +183100 = (92/585) * LCD

But computing (92/585)*LCD, I may have miscalculated.

Wait, LCD= (x +2)(x -4)(x +4)(x -6)(x +6)(x -8)

But with LCD multiplied into denominators:

Original equation:

[(x +1)(x -3)] / [(x +2)(x -4)] + [(x +3)(x -5)] / [(x +4)(x -6)] + 2[(x +5)(x -7)] / [(x +6)(x -8)] = 92/585

So, when multiplying by LCD, each term:

First term: [(x +1)(x -3)] / [(x +2)(x -4)] * LCD= (x +1)(x -3)*(x +4)(x -6)(x +8)

Wait, no, LCD is (x +2)(x -4)(x +4)(x -6)(x +6)(x -8). So, first term's denominator is (x +2)(x -4), so LCD/(x +2)(x -4)= (x +4)(x -6)(x +6)(x -8)

Similarly, second term: denominator (x +4)(x -6), so LCD/(x +4)(x -6)= (x +2)(x -4)(x +6)(x -8)

Third term: denominator (x +6)(x -8), so LCD/(x +6)(x -8)= (x +2)(x -4)(x +4)(x -6)

Therefore, when multiplying both sides by LCD, the equation becomes:

(x +1)(x -3)*(x +4)(x -6)(x +8) + (x +3)(x -5)*(x +2)(x -4)(x +6)(x -8) + 2*(x +5)(x -7)*(x +2)(x -4)(x +6)(x -8)= (92/585)*LCD

Compute each term:

First term: (x +1)(x -3)(x +4)(x -6)(x +8)

Second term: (x +3)(x -5)(x +2)(x -4)(x +6)(x -8)

Third term: 2*(x +5)(x -7)(x +2)(x -4)(x +6)(x -8)

But with this, computing this is extremely complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the equation is designed with x = -2 and x=4 excluded, but roots at other places.

But without further information, I think the equation has no real roots.

But the problem says "find all real roots", implying that there are real roots.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in cross-multiplication earlier.

Wait, let me check the cross-multiplication step.

Original equation:

[(x +1)(x -3)] / [(x +2)(x -4)] + [(x +3)(x -5)] / [(x +4)(x -6)] + 2[(x +5)(x -7)] / [(x +6)(x -8)] = 92/585

Multiplying both sides by LCD:

(x +1)(x -3)*(x +4)(x -6)(x +8) + (x +3)(x -5)*(x +2)(x -4)(x +6)(x -8) + 2*(x +5)(x -7)*(x +2)(x -4)(x +6)(x -8) = (92/585)*LCD

But in my previous approach, I incorrectly thought that the LCD is common across all terms, but in reality, each term has a different denominator, so when multiplying each term by LCD, you only remove the denominators for that term.

Thus, the correct cross-multiplication would be:

Multiply first term by LCD: [(x +1)(x -3)]*(x +4)(x -6)(x +8)

Multiply second term by LCD: [(x +3)(x -5)]*(x +2)(x -4)(x +6)(x -8)

Multiply third term by LCD: 2[(x +5)(x -7)]*(x +2)(x -4)(x +6)(x -8)

Multiply RHS: (92/585)*LCD

But since LCD is same for all, we can factor it out:

LCD*[First term + Second term + Third term] = (92/585)*LCD

Thus, divide both sides by LCD:

First term + Second term + Third term = 92/585

Which is the original equation.

Thus, cross-multiplication didn't help in eliminating denominators.

Therefore, the equation is not easily solvable by elementary methods.

Therefore, since the discriminant is negative, equation has no real roots.

But the problem says "find all real roots", so must have real roots.

Therefore, perhaps made a mistake in cross-multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps in the problem statement, the equation is meant to have real roots, but my computation is wrong.

Alternatively, let me consider that the equation is constructed such that x=5 and x=-3 are roots, but excluded. Alternatively, perhaps x=5 and x=-3 are roots.

But when x=5, denominator (x -4)=1, (x -6)=-1, (x -8)=-3.

But original equation is undefined at x=5 because third term denominator: (x -8)= -3, so okay, but wait no, denominators at x=5:

First term: (5 +2)(5 -4)=7*1=7≠0

Second term: (5 +4)(5 -6)=9*(-1)=-9≠0

Third term: (5 +6)(5 -8)=11*(-3)=-33≠0

So, x=5 is allowed.

Compute equation at x=5:

First term: (6)(2)/7*1=12/7≈1.714

Second term: (8)(0)/(-9)=0

Third term: 2*(10)(-3)/(-33)= -60/-33≈1.818

Sum≈1.714 +0 +1.818≈3.532≠92/585≈0.157

Not equal.

Similarly, at x=-3, which is excluded, but near x=-3.

So, the equation doesn't have x=5 or x=-3 as roots.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is faulty.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is supposed to have roots at x=5 and x=-3, but due to cross-multiplication errors, got extraneous roots.

Alternatively, maybe the equation is designed with symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps substitute x=5.345 and see with more precision.

Compute x≈5.345.

Compute each term:

First term: (5.345 +1)/(5.345 +2)=6.345/7.345≈0.866

Second term: (5.345 +3)/(5.345 +4)=8.345/9.345≈0.893

Third term:2*(5.345 +5)/(5.345 +6)=2*(10.345)/11.345≈2*0.915≈1.83

Sum≈0.866 +0.893 +1.83≈3.589≠0.157

Similarly, x≈-3.341:

First term: (-3.341 +1)/(-3.341 +2)=(-2.341)/(-1.341)≈1.74

Second term: (-3.341 +3)/(-3.341 +4)=(-0.341)/(0.659)≈-0.518

Third term:2*(-3.341 +5)/(-3.341 +6)=2*(1.659)/(2.659)≈2*0.624≈1.248

Sum≈1.74 -0.518 +1.248≈2.47≠0.157

Therefore, the approximate solutions don't satisfy the original equation, indicating that the equation may have no real roots.

But the problem says "find all real roots", which suggests that there are real roots, but my calculations show otherwise.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is designed so that the numerator and denominator can be canceled in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a factor that I missed.

Wait, let me try to compute the equation numerically at x=5.345.

But approximate computation didn't satisfy.

Alternatively, maybe the equation is designed with specific roots.

Alternatively, perhaps substitute x= -2 + sqrt(3480)/52≈-2 +29.14≈27.14, but not a root.

Alternatively, maybe equation is meant to have roots at x=1 ± sqrt(3480)/52, but they are excluded.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed incorrectly.

Given the time I've spent, I think the equation has no real roots.

But the problem statement says "find all real roots", implying that there are real roots. So, perhaps the equation has real roots, but my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation has a real root at x= -3.4 and x=5.3, but approximate calculations don't satisfy.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is supposed to have a double root or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation has roots at x=5 and x= -3, but they are excluded.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to check the problem statement.

Wait, original problem:

Find all real roots of the equation:

[(x+1)(x−3)] / [(x+2)(x−4)] + [(x+3)(x−5)] / [(x+4)(x−6)] + 2[(x+5)(x−7)] / [(x+6)(x−8)] = 92/585

Given that denominators are excluded at x=-6,-4,-2,4,6,8.

My steps: cross-multiplied, attempted substitution, found quadratic in z with negative discriminant, implying no real roots.

But problem says to find all real roots, so either the answer is no real roots, or I made a mistake.

But since problem says to find real roots, likely the answer is x=5/2 and x=-3/2, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps equation is:

[(x+1)(x−3)] / [(x+2)(x−4)] + [(x+3)(x−5)] / [(x+4)(x−6)] + 2[(x+5)(x−7)] / [(x+6)(x−8)] = 92/585

Alternatively, maybe 92/585 is reducible.

Compute GCD of 92 and 585:

Factors of 92: 2×2×23

Factors of 585:5×117=5×13×9

No common factors, so 92/585 is in lowest terms.

Alternatively, maybe the equation is written incorrectly, and the right side is 92/585, which reduces to 92/585= (92 ÷ GCD)/(585 ÷ GCD)=92/585.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is supposed to have roots at x=5 and x=-3, but as above.

Alternatively, given that the discriminant is negative, the equation has no real roots.

Therefore, the answer is that there are no real roots.

But the problem says "find all real roots", implying that there are.

Alternatively, maybe the equation was copied incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is:

[(x+1)(x−3)] / [(x+2)(x−4)] + [(x+3)(x−5)] / [(x+4)(x−6)] + 2[(x+5)(x−7)] / [(x+6)(x−8)] = 92/585

Which is correct.

Thus, given that, equation has no real roots.

Thus, answer is no real roots.

But the problem says "find all real roots", so maybe answer is x= -2 and x=4, but they are excluded.

Alternatively, maybe x= -3 and x=5, but they don't satisfy.

Wait, but if equation is designed with roots at x= -2 and x=4, but they are excluded, so no solution.

Alternatively, the equation is faulty, and no real roots.

Therefore, after my lengthy consideration, I think the equation has no real roots.

But since the problem asks to find all real roots, perhaps the answer is x=5 and x= -3, but since they are excluded, so no real roots.

But in that case, the equation has no real roots.

Thus, the answer is: There are no real roots.

But since the problem says "find all real roots", and in the context, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, I just noticed that 92/585 is approximately 0.157, and when x=5, sum≈3.532; when x=-3.341, sum≈2.47.

But maybe the equation has complex roots, but real roots are at x= -3.341 and x=5.345, but they don't satisfy.

But given that, I think the equation has no real roots.

Hence, the final answer is that there are no real roots.

But since the problem says "find all real roots", perhaps it's better to write that.

But in the problem statement, it's given as Find all real roots..., so perhaps the answer is x=5 and x= -3, even though they are excluded.

But no, they are excluded.

Alternatively, if forced to give real roots, maybe x≈-3.341 and x≈5.345, but since they don't satisfy, I think the answer is no real roots.

Therefore, the equation has no real roots.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\text{No real roots}}
</think>

To find all real roots of the equation:

\[
\frac{(x+1)(x-3)}{(x+2)(x-4)} + \frac{(x+3)(x-5)}{(x+4)(x-6)} + \frac{2(x+5)(x-7)}{(x+6)(x-8)} = \frac{92}{585}
\]

we start by noting the excluded values of \( x \): \(-6, -4, -2, 4, 6, 8\). These values are excluded because they make the denominators zero.

We then rewrite the equation by combining the terms over a common denominator, which is \((x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8)\). After multiplying both sides by this common denominator and simplifying, we find that the resulting equation is a quadratic in terms of \( z = x + 1 \).

However, the quadratic equation derived from this process has a negative discriminant, indicating that there are no real roots. Despite this, we checked approximate solutions and found that they do not satisfy the original equation. 

Thus, the equation has no real roots.

\[
\boxed{\text{No real roots}}
\]
