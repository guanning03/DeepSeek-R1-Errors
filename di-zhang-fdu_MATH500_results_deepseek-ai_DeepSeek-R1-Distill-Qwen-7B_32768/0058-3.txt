Question:
Twelve friends met for dinner at Oscar's Overstuffed Oyster House, and each ordered one meal. The portions were so large, there was enough food for 18 people. If they share, how many meals should they have ordered to have just enough food for the 12 of them?

Correct Answer:
If 12 people order $\frac{18}{12}=1\frac{1}{2}$ times too much food, they should have ordered $\frac{12}{\frac{3}{2}}=\frac{2}{3}\times 12=\boxed{8}$ meals.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: Twelve friends went to Oscar's Overstuffed Oyster House for dinner, and each of them ordered one meal. The portions were really large, enough for 18 people. Now, if they decide to share, how many meals should they have ordered to have just enough food for the 12 of them?

Hmm, let me think about this. It's about sharing food portions, right? So, each meal is enough for 18 people, but they only have 12 friends. So, maybe they don't need to order 12 meals? Because each meal serves more people. So, if each meal is enough for 18, how much do 12 people need?

Wait, is this a division problem? Maybe. If each meal serves 18, then for 12 people, how many meals do they need? Let me put it into an equation. Let's say the number of meals they need is M. So, each meal serves 18, and they have M meals, so total servings would be 18*M. They need enough servings for 12 people, so total servings should be at least 12.

So, 18*M >= 12. So, solving for M, we get M >= 12/18. Simplifying that, 12 divided by 18 is 2/3. So, M >= 2/3. But you can't order a fraction of a meal, right? So, do they need to round up? Because you can't have two-thirds of a meal. So, maybe they need to order 1 meal? But wait, if they order 1 meal, that's 18 servings, which is more than enough for 12. But is 1 meal enough? Or is 1 meal too much?

Wait, the question says "how many meals should they have ordered to have just enough food for the 12 of them?" So, if each meal is enough for 18, then 1 meal is enough for 12 because 18 is greater than 12. So, ordering 1 meal would give them more than enough food.

But maybe the question is asking how many meals to order in total so that when they share, each person gets one serving, right? Because maybe each meal is 18 portions, but each person only needs one portion. So, 12 people, each needing one portion, so total portions needed is 12. Each meal gives 18 portions, so number of meals needed is 12/18, which is 2/3. But since you can't have two-thirds of a meal, you need to round up to the next whole meal, which is 1.

Alternatively, maybe it's about how much each person is getting if they share. So, if they have M meals, each person would get M divided by 12. But they want each person to have just enough, so maybe each person should get one serving. So, M divided by 12 equals 1, which means M equals 12. But wait, that can't be because each meal is enough for 18. So, if M is 12, that's way more than needed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to think differently. If each meal is enough for 18 people, how much does each meal actually serve? Let's say each meal is one serving for 18 people, so the portion size is 1/18 per person. Therefore, each person only needs 1 portion, which is 1/18 of a meal. So, for 12 people, each needing 1/18 of a meal, total meal needed is 12*(1/18) = 12/18 = 2/3. So, 2/3 of a meal.

But you can't order 2/3 of a meal, so they need to order 1 meal. Therefore, they should have ordered 1 meal to have just enough food for the 12 of them.

Wait, that makes sense because each meal is 18 portions, so if you have 12 people, each getting one portion, it's 12 portions, which is 12/18 = 2/3 of a meal. So, since you can't order 2/3 of a meal, you round up to 1.

Alternatively, if each meal is 18 portions, and they have 12 people, each person is getting 1 portion, so 12 portions, which is 12/18 = 2/3 of a meal. So, same as before.

But maybe the question is about how many meals to order so that when they share, the total number of meals is just enough for 12 people, meaning that the number of meals needed is 12, but each meal serves 18, so how many meals is that? Wait, no. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, another way: If each meal is enough for 18 people, then the number of meals needed for 12 people is 12 divided by 18, which is 2/3. Since you can't have 2/3 of a meal, you'd need to round up. So, 1 meal. So, 1 meal is sufficient because it's more than enough for 12 people.

Alternatively, if you think about the portion sizes, each meal is 18 portions. So, each person needs 1 portion. So, for 12 people, they need 12 portions. Since each meal is 18 portions, 12 portions is 12/18 = 2/3 of a meal. So, they need 2/3 of a meal. But again, you can't order 2/3 of a meal, so you need to order 1 meal.

So, in both cases, it's 1 meal. So, the answer is 1.

But wait, let me think again. If each meal is 18 portions, and you have 12 people, each needing 1 portion, so total portions needed is 12. Each meal gives 18. So, 12 divided by 18 is 2/3. So, 2/3 meals. Since you can't order 2/3 of a meal, you have to order 1 meal. So, 1 meal is enough.

But another perspective: If they each ordered a meal, that's 12 meals, each of which is 18 portions, so total portions would be 12*18 = 216. But that's way more than needed. So, obviously, they don't want to order 12 meals. Maybe they can share more.

But the question is, how many meals should they have ordered to have just enough food for the 12 of them. So, if each meal is enough for 18, how many meals do they need for 12 people.

Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Maybe each person is getting a meal, but that's 12 meals, which is 12*18 = 216 portions. But they only need 12 portions, so that's way too much.

Wait, maybe the question is about if they share the food, so they can each have a portion without ordering enough meals. So, if each meal is 18 portions, and they have M meals, then total portions are 18*M. They need at least 12 portions. So, 18*M >= 12. Therefore, M >= 12/18 = 2/3. So, they need to order at least 1 meal. Since they can't order 2/3, they need to order 1 meal.

So, the answer is 1 meal. Therefore, they should have ordered 1 meal.

But wait, let me check. If they order 1 meal, which is 18 portions, and there are 12 people, each person can have 1 portion, and there would be 6 portions left over. So, that's acceptable because they just need enough for the 12 of them. So, 1 meal is enough.

Alternatively, if they ordered 0 meals, they wouldn't have any food, which is bad. So, 1 is the minimum number of meals needed.

So, yeah, I think 1 is the answer.

**Final Answer**
They should have ordered \boxed{1} meal.
</think>

The problem involves twelve friends who each ordered one meal at Oscar's Overstuffed Oyster House, with each meal being enough for 18 people. The question is how many meals they should have ordered to have just enough food for the 12 of them if they share.

To determine this, we need to calculate the number of meals required to provide 12 portions, given that each meal provides 18 portions. This can be formulated as:

\[
\text{Number of meals needed} = \frac{12}{18} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Since they cannot order a fraction of a meal, they need to round up to the next whole number, which is 1. Therefore, they should have ordered 1 meal.

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
