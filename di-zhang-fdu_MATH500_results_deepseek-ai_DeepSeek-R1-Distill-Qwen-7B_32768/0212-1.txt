Question:
Find all solutions to
\[\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
Since $\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} x$ for all $x,$ we can write
\[\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} x \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]Let $\theta = \tan^{-1} x,$ so $x = \tan \theta.$  Also, $\sin 2 \theta = \frac{1}{3},$ so
\[2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \frac{1}{3}.\]Construct a right triangle with legs 1 and $x.$  Then the angle opposite the side length $x$ be $\theta.$

[asy]
unitsize(1 cm);

pair A, B, C;

A = (2,1.8);
B = (0,0);
C = (2,0);

draw(A--B--C--cycle);
draw(rightanglemark(A,C,B,8));

label("$\theta$", B + (0.7,0.3));
label("$1$", (B + C)/2, S);
label("$x$", (A + C)/2, E);
label("$\sqrt{x^2 + 1}$", (A + B)/2, NW);
[/asy]

Also, the hypotenuse will be $\sqrt{x^2 + 1},$ so $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}$ and $\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}.$  Hence,
\[2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = \frac{1}{3},\]or
\[\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}.\]This gives us $x^2 + 1 = 6x,$ or $x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula, the roots are $x = \boxed{3 \pm 2 \sqrt{2}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this equation to solve: \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). Hmm, trigonometric functions with inverse trigonometric functions. That seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it somehow.

First off, I remember that \(\cot^{-1}(y)\) is the same as \(\tan^{-1}(1/y)\). So, let me rewrite the equation using that identity. That would make the equation:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Wait, simplifying \(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}}\) is just \(x\), right? So, the equation becomes:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

So, that's \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\). Hmm, okay, so maybe I can let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then, \(\tan(\theta) = x\), and the equation becomes:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

I know that \(\sin(2\theta)\) can be written using the double-angle identity: \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin\theta \cos\theta\). So, substituting that in:

\[
2 \sin\theta \cos\theta = \frac{1}{3}
\]

But I also know that \(\tan\theta = x\), which is \(\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} = x\). So, I can express \(\sin\theta\) and \(\cos\theta\) in terms of \(x\). Let me draw a right triangle where \(\theta\) is one of the angles. The opposite side would be \(x\), and the adjacent side would be 1, so the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\).

Therefore, \(\sin\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\). Substituting these back into the equation:

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Simplifying that, the denominators multiply to \(x^2 + 1\), so:

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

So, simplifying further:

\[
\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions:

\[
6x = x^2 + 1
\]

Bringing all terms to one side:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]

Now, this is a quadratic equation in \(x\). I can solve it using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is \(x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0\), so \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), \(c = 1\). Plugging into the formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2}
\]

Simplifying \(\sqrt{32}\) is \(4\sqrt{2}\), so:

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]

So, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Wait, let me check if these are valid. Since \(x\) is inside an inverse tangent and inverse cotangent, which are defined for all real numbers except where their arguments are problematic. Specifically, \(\frac{1}{x}\) needs to be defined, so \(x\) cannot be zero. But since \(3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\) are both positive (since \(2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828\), so \(3 - 2.828 \approx 0.172\), which is positive), so both solutions are valid.

Let me verify by plugging back into the original equation.

First, let's take \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). Then, \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is some angle, and \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\) is another angle. Since \(\cot^{-1}(1/x) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), as I had earlier, so the sum is \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\). So, the sine of that is \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x))\). Using the double-angle formula, that's \(2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x))\), which is \(2 * \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} * \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1}\). For \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\), let's compute this:

Compute \(x^2 = (3 + 2\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 + 12\sqrt{2} + 8 = 17 + 12\sqrt{2}\). So, \(x^2 + 1 = 18 + 12\sqrt{2}\). Then, \(2x = 2*(3 + 2\sqrt{2}) = 6 + 4\sqrt{2}\). So, the fraction becomes \(\frac{6 + 4\sqrt{2}}{18 + 12\sqrt{2}}\). Let me rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by \(18 - 12\sqrt{2}\):

Numerator: \((6 + 4\sqrt{2})(18 - 12\sqrt{2})\)
Denominator: \((18 + 12\sqrt{2})(18 - 12\sqrt{2}) = 18^2 - (12\sqrt{2})^2 = 324 - 288 = 36\)

Compute numerator:

First, \(6*18 = 108\)
\(6*(-12\sqrt{2}) = -72\sqrt{2}\)
\(4\sqrt{2}*18 = 72\sqrt{2}\)
\(4\sqrt{2}*(-12\sqrt{2}) = -48*2 = -96\)

So, adding all these up:

108 - 72\sqrt{2} + 72\sqrt{2} - 96 = (108 - 96) + (-72\sqrt{2} + 72\sqrt{2}) = 12 + 0 = 12

So, numerator is 12, denominator is 36, so the fraction is \(12/36 = 1/3\). Perfect, so that works.

Now, check \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Let's do the same steps.

First, compute \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Then \(x^2 = (3 - 2\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 - 12\sqrt{2} + 8 = 17 - 12\sqrt{2}\). Then, \(x^2 + 1 = 18 - 12\sqrt{2}\). \(2x = 6 - 4\sqrt{2}\). So, the fraction is \(\frac{6 - 4\sqrt{2}}{18 - 12\sqrt{2}}\).

Again, rationalize denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by \(18 + 12\sqrt{2}\):

Numerator: \((6 - 4\sqrt{2})(18 + 12\sqrt{2})\)
Denominator: \(324 - (12\sqrt{2})^2 = 324 - 288 = 36\)

Compute numerator:

\(6*18 = 108\)
\(6*12\sqrt{2} = 72\sqrt{2}\)
\(-4\sqrt{2}*18 = -72\sqrt{2}\)
\(-4\sqrt{2}*12\sqrt{2} = -96\)

Adding up:

108 + 72\sqrt{2} - 72\sqrt{2} - 96 = (108 - 96) + (72\sqrt{2} - 72\sqrt{2}) = 12 + 0 = 12

So, numerator is 12, denominator is 36, so again, we have \(12/36 = 1/3\). Perfect, that also works.

Therefore, both solutions satisfy the equation.

So, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

**Final Answer**
The solutions are \(\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}\) and \(\boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}\).
</think>

We start with the equation:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Using the identity \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \tan^{-1}(1/y)\), we rewrite the equation as:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then, \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and the equation becomes:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Using the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin\theta \cos\theta\), we substitute \(\sin\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\):

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
6x = x^2 + 1
\]

Rearranging into a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) with \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]

Both solutions \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) are valid as they are positive and do not cause any issues with the inverse trigonometric functions.

Thus, the solutions are:

\[
\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}, \boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}
\]
