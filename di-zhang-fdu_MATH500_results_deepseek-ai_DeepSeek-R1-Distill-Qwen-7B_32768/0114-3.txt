Question:
Find the roots of $(x - 3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.$

Correct Answer:
Let $a = x - 3$ and $b = x - 7.$  Then we can write the given equation as
\[a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3.\]Expanding, we get $a^3 + b^3 = a^3 + 3a^2 b + 3ab^2 + b^3,$ so $3a^2 b + 3ab^2 = 0,$ which factors as
\[3ab(a + b) = 0.\]Thus, $a = 0,$ $b = 0,$ or $a + b = 0.$  Then $x - 3 = 0,$ $x - 7 = 0,$ or $2x - 10 = 0.$  This gives us the roots $\boxed{3, 5, 7}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this equation to solve: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3. Hmm, okay. I need to find the roots of this equation. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I notice that on the left side, there are two cubic terms, and on the right side, it's another cubic term. Maybe I can simplify this equation somehow. I also notice that the right side is (2x - 10)^3. Hmm, 2x - 10 can be factored as 2(x - 5). So, (2x - 10)^3 is the same as 8(x - 5)^3. Maybe that can help.

Let me write down the equation again:

(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.

So, substituting what I just thought, it becomes:

(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3.

Alright, so now I have (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3. I wonder if this resembles any identity or formula I know. I recall that for cubes, there's an identity: a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Maybe I can apply that here.

Let me set a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 7). Then, a + b would be (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10. Wait a second, that's exactly the same as 2(x - 5), which is the term on the right side after factoring. Interesting.

So, substituting back into the identity: a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Therefore, the left side becomes (2x - 10)(something). The right side is 8(x - 5)^3. Let me write that out:

(2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = 8(x - 5)^3.

But 2x - 10 is 2(x - 5), so substituting that in:

2(x - 5)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = 8(x - 5)^3.

Hmm, okay, so both sides have a factor of (x - 5). Maybe I can divide both sides by (x - 5), but I have to be careful because if x = 5, we might be dividing by zero. Let me check x = 5.

If x = 5, plugging back into the original equation:

(5 - 3)^3 + (5 - 7)^3 = (10 - 10)^3.

So, 2^3 + (-2)^3 = 0^3.

Calculating that, 8 + (-8) = 0. So, 0 = 0. Therefore, x = 5 is a solution. So, I can include x = 5 as a root. Good.

Now, going back to the equation after dividing both sides by (x - 5):

2(x - 5)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = 8(x - 5)^3.

Divide both sides by (x - 5):

2(a^2 - ab + b^2) = 8(x - 5)^2.

Simplify:

Divide both sides by 2:

a^2 - ab + b^2 = 4(x - 5)^2.

Now, let's compute a^2 - ab + b^2.

Given that a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 7), let's compute each term:

a^2 = (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.

ab = (x - 3)(x - 7) = x^2 - 10x + 21.

b^2 = (x - 7)^2 = x^2 - 14x + 49.

So, plug these into a^2 - ab + b^2:

(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 10x + 21) + (x^2 - 14x + 49).

Let me compute term by term:

First term: x^2 - 6x + 9.

Second term: -x^2 + 10x - 21.

Third term: x^2 - 14x + 49.

Now, combine like terms:

x^2 - x^2 + x^2 = x^2.

-6x + 10x -14x = (-6 + 10 -14)x = (-10)x.

9 -21 +49 = (9 -21) +49 = (-12) +49 = 37.

So, a^2 - ab + b^2 simplifies to x^2 -10x +37.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

x^2 -10x +37 = 4(x -5)^2.

Compute the right side:

4(x -5)^2 = 4(x^2 -10x +25) = 4x^2 -40x +100.

So, now the equation is:

x^2 -10x +37 = 4x^2 -40x +100.

Bring all terms to one side:

0 = 4x^2 -40x +100 - x^2 +10x -37.

Simplify:

4x^2 - x^2 = 3x^2.

-40x +10x = -30x.

100 -37 = 63.

So, equation becomes:

3x^2 -30x +63 = 0.

Simplify by dividing all terms by 3:

x^2 -10x +21 = 0.

So, now we have a quadratic equation: x^2 -10x +21 = 0.

Let me try to factor this. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 21 and add up to -10.

Factors of 21: 1 and 21, 3 and 7.

3 and 7 add up to 10. Since the middle term is -10x, both numbers should be negative to add to -10 and multiply to +21.

So, (x -3)(x -7)=0.

Therefore, the solutions are x = 3 and x =7.

Wait, but hold on a second. Earlier, when I divided both sides by (x -5), I assumed x â‰ 5. But I already found x=5 is a solution. So, the solutions are x=5, x=3, and x=7.

Let me check these solutions in the original equation to make sure.

First, x=5:

(5 -3)^3 + (5 -7)^3 = (2*5 -10)^3.

2^3 + (-2)^3 = 0^3.

8 -8 =0. 0=0. Correct.

Next, x=3:

(3 -3)^3 + (3 -7)^3 = (6 -10)^3.

0 + (-4)^3 = (-4)^3.

0 + (-64) = -64. -64 = -64. Correct.

x=7:

(7 -3)^3 + (7 -7)^3 = (14 -10)^3.

4^3 + 0 =4^3.

64 +0 =64. 64=64. Correct.

So, all three roots are valid. Therefore, the roots of the equation are x=3, x=5, and x=7.

Wait, hold on, but in the quadratic equation, x^2 -10x +21=0, we have roots at 3 and7, and we already had x=5 as a root. So, altogether, three roots: 3,5,7.

But wait, just to make sure, is this a cubic equation? The original equation is cubic, so it can have up to three real roots. So, we have three roots: 3,5,7. So, that seems to fit.

But just to make sure, let me substitute x=3 into the original equation:

(x -3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x -10)^3.

(0)^3 + (-4)^3 = (6 -10)^3.

0 + (-64) = (-4)^3.

-64 = -64. Correct.

x=5: as above, correct.

x=7: as above, correct.

So, everything checks out.

Alternatively, another approach could be to let y = x -5, because the right side is 2(x -5). Maybe substituting y = x -5 could simplify things.

Let me try that.

Let y = x -5, so x = y +5.

Substitute into the original equation:

(x -3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x -10)^3.

Replace x with y +5:

(y +5 -3)^3 + (y +5 -7)^3 = (2(y +5) -10)^3.

Simplify each term:

(y +2)^3 + (y -2)^3 = (2y +10 -10)^3.

Simplify further:

(y +2)^3 + (y -2)^3 = (2y)^3.

So, (y +2)^3 + (y -2)^3 = 8y^3.

Let me expand (y +2)^3 and (y -2)^3.

We know that (a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3.

So, (y +2)^3 = y^3 + 3y^2*2 + 3y*4 +8 = y^3 +6y^2 +12y +8.

Similarly, (y -2)^3 = y^3 -6y^2 +12y -8.

Add them together:

(y^3 +6y^2 +12y +8) + (y^3 -6y^2 +12y -8) = 2y^3 +24y.

So, left side is 2y^3 +24y.

Right side is 8y^3.

Bring all terms to one side:

2y^3 +24y -8y^3 =0.

Simplify:

-6y^3 +24y=0.

Factor:

-6y(y^2 -4)=0.

So, -6y(y -2)(y +2)=0.

Thus, the solutions are y=0, y=2, y=-2.

Recall that y =x -5, so:

If y=0, x=5.

If y=2, x=7.

If y=-2, x=3.

So, same results: x=3,5,7.

Therefore, regardless of the method, substitution or expanding, I get the same roots.

Therefore, the roots are x=3, x=5, and x=7.

I think that's thorough. I considered the equation, noticed the right side could be expressed as 2(x -5), then tried factoring and expanding, and also used substitution to simplify, both leading to the same solutions. Checked each solution in the original equation, they all satisfy. So, I'm confident that these are the correct roots.

**Final Answer**
The roots are \boxed{3}, \boxed{5}, and \boxed{7}.
</think>

Given the equation \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\), we start by noting that the right side can be factored as \(8(x - 5)^3\). This allows us to rewrite the equation as:

\[
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3
\]

We recognize that the left side resembles the identity \(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\). Setting \(a = x - 3\) and \(b = x - 7\), we have \(a + b = 2x - 10\), which is the same as \(2(x - 5)\). Substituting this into the identity, we get:

\[
(2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = 8(x - 5)^3
\]

Since \(2x - 10 = 2(x - 5)\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
2(x - 5)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = 8(x - 5)^3
\]

Dividing both sides by \(2(x - 5)\) (assuming \(x \neq 5\)):

\[
a^2 - ab + b^2 = 4(x - 5)^2
\]

Next, we compute \(a^2 - ab + b^2\) where \(a = x - 3\) and \(b = x - 7\):

\[
a^2 = (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
\[
ab = (x - 3)(x - 7) = x^2 - 10x + 21
\]
\[
b^2 = (x - 7)^2 = x^2 - 14x + 49
\]

Thus,

\[
a^2 - ab + b^2 = (x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 10x + 21) + (x^2 - 14x + 49) = x^2 - 10x + 37
\]

Substituting back, we get:

\[
x^2 - 10x + 37 = 4(x - 5)^2
\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
4(x - 5)^2 = 4(x^2 - 10x + 25) = 4x^2 - 40x + 100
\]

Equating both sides:

\[
x^2 - 10x + 37 = 4x^2 - 40x + 100
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
0 = 3x^2 - 30x + 63
\]

Simplifying:

\[
x^2 - 10x + 21 = 0
\]

Factoring the quadratic equation:

\[
(x - 3)(x - 7) = 0
\]

Thus, the solutions are \(x = 3\) and \(x = 7\). Additionally, we found \(x = 5\) by recognizing it as a solution when dividing by \(x - 5\).

Verifying all solutions in the original equation confirms they are correct. Therefore, the roots are:

\[
\boxed{3}, \boxed{5}, \boxed{7}
\]
