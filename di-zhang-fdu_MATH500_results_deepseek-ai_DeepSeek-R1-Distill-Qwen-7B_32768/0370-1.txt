Question:
Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 5 such that
\[p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1}\]for $n = 2,$ 3, 4, $\dots,$ 7.  Find $p(8).$

Correct Answer:
Let $q(x) = (x^2 - 1) p(x) - x.$  Then $q(x)$ has degree 7, and $q(n) = 0$ for $n = 2$, 3, 4, $\dots,$ 7, so
\[q(x) = (ax + b)(x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7)\]for some constants $a$ and $b.$

We know that $q(1) = (1^2 - 1)p(1) - 1 = -1.$  Setting $x = 1$ in the equation above, we get
\[q(1) = 720(a + b),\]so $a + b = -\frac{1}{720}.$

We also know that $q(-1) = ((-1)^2 - 1)p(-1) + 1 = 1.$  Setting $x = -1$ in the equation above, we get
\[q(-1) = 20160(-a + b),\]so $-a + b = \frac{1}{20160}.$  Solving for $a$ and $b,$ we find $a = -\frac{29}{40320}$ and $b = -\frac{3}{4480}.$  Hence,
\begin{align*}
q(x) &= \left( -\frac{29}{40320} x - \frac{3}{4480} \right) (x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7) \\
&= -\frac{(29x + 27)(x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7)}{40320}.
\end{align*}In particular,
\[q(8) = -\frac{(29 \cdot 8 + 27)(6)(5) \dotsm (1)}{40320} = -\frac{37}{8},\]so
\[p(8) = \frac{q(8) + 8}{8^2 - 1} = \boxed{\frac{3}{56}}.\]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this problem here where there's a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree 5, and it satisfies the equation \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, \dots, 7 \). I need to find \( p(8) \). Hmm, okay, let's try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that polynomials are determined uniquely by their degree and their values at specific points. Since \( p(x) \) is a degree 5 polynomial and it's given at 6 points (from \( n=2 \) to \( n=7 \)), that should uniquely determine the polynomial. So, in theory, there should be a way to construct this polynomial or find another expression for it that allows me to calculate \( p(8) \).

Wait, but \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for these integer values. That expression \( \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) simplifies a bit. Let me rewrite that. \( n^2 - 1 \) factors into \( (n - 1)(n + 1) \), so \( \frac{n}{(n - 1)(n + 1)} \). Hmm, okay, so it's a rational function. But \( p(x) \) is a polynomial, so it must pass through these points exactly.

Since \( p(x) \) is a degree 5 polynomial, and we're given 6 points, maybe I can construct another polynomial that relates to \( p(x) \). Let me think about how to set this up.

Let me denote \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \). So, if I plug in \( x = n \) where \( n \) is from 2 to 7, then \( q(n) = (n^2 - 1)p(n) - n = (n^2 - 1)\left( \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \right) - n = n - n = 0 \). So, \( q(x) \) has roots at \( x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). That means \( q(x) \) is a polynomial that has these 6 roots, so it must be divisible by \( (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) \).

But wait, let's look at the degrees. \( p(x) \) is a degree 5 polynomial, so \( (x^2 - 1)p(x) \) is degree 7, and subtracting \( x \) (degree 1) doesn't change that. So \( q(x) \) is a degree 7 polynomial. On the other hand, \( (x - 2)(x - 3)...(x - 7) \) is a degree 6 polynomial. Therefore, \( q(x) \) must be equal to \( c(x - 2)(x - 3)...(x - 7) \) where \( c \) is some constant.

So, we have \( q(x) = c(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) \). But \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \), so:

\( (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x = c(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) \)

Therefore, we can solve for \( p(x) \):

\( p(x) = \frac{c(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) + x}{x^2 - 1} \)

Now, the task is to find the constant \( c \). To find \( c \), maybe we can plug in a value for \( x \) that isn't one of the roots (i.e., not 2 through 7). Let's see. Since \( p(x) \) is a polynomial, the numerator must be divisible by \( x^2 - 1 \), so when \( x = 1 \) or \( x = -1 \), the numerator must be zero because the denominator is zero there. Let's test \( x = 1 \).

Plugging \( x = 1 \) into the numerator:

\( c(1 - 2)(1 - 3)(1 - 4)(1 - 5)(1 - 6)(1 - 7) + 1 \)

Compute each term:

\( (1 - 2) = -1 \)

\( (1 - 3) = -2 \)

\( (1 - 4) = -3 \)

\( (1 - 5) = -4 \)

\( (1 - 6) = -5 \)

\( (1 - 7) = -6 \)

Multiply all together:

\( (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6) \)

Let me compute step by step:

First, multiply two at a time:

\( (-1)(-2) = 2 \)

\( 2 \times (-3) = -6 \)

\( (-6) \times (-4) = 24 \)

\( 24 \times (-5) = -120 \)

\( (-120) \times (-6) = 720 \)

So, the product is 720.

Therefore, the numerator at \( x = 1 \) is \( c \times 720 + 1 \). Since the denominator is zero at \( x = 1 \), the entire expression \( p(1) \) must be finite, so the numerator must also be zero here.

So, set \( c \times 720 + 1 = 0 \)

Solving for \( c \):

\( c = -1/720 \)

Alright, so \( c = -1/720 \). Now, we can write \( p(x) \) as:

\( p(x) = \frac{ -\frac{1}{720}(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) + x }{x^2 - 1} \)

Now, we need to compute \( p(8) \). Let's substitute \( x = 8 \) into this expression.

First, compute the numerator:

\( -\frac{1}{720}(8 - 2)(8 - 3)(8 - 4)(8 - 5)(8 - 6)(8 - 7) + 8 \)

Compute each term:

\( (8 - 2) = 6 \)

\( (8 - 3) = 5 \)

\( (8 - 4) = 4 \)

\( (8 - 5) = 3 \)

\( (8 - 6) = 2 \)

\( (8 - 7) = 1 \)

Multiply them all together:

\( 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720 \)

So, the numerator becomes:

\( -\frac{1}{720} \times 720 + 8 = -1 + 8 = 7 \)

Now, compute the denominator \( x^2 - 1 \) at \( x = 8 \):

\( 8^2 - 1 = 64 - 1 = 63 \)

Therefore, \( p(8) = \frac{7}{63} = \frac{1}{9} \).

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, \( c \) was found by plugging \( x = 1 \) into the numerator, which gave \( c \times 720 + 1 = 0 \), so \( c = -1/720 \). That seems correct.

Then, computing the numerator at \( x = 8 \):

The product \( (8 - 2)(8 - 3)...(8 - 7) \) is indeed 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720.

So, the first term is \( -1/720 * 720 = -1 \), and adding 8 gives 7. The denominator is 63, so 7/63 simplifies to 1/9.

Hmm, that seems right. So, \( p(8) = \frac{1}{9} \).

Wait, just to be thorough, maybe I should check another point. Let's say \( x = 0 \). Then, \( p(0) \) should be equal to \( 0/(0^2 - 1) = 0 \). Let's see if my expression for \( p(x) \) gives 0 when \( x = 0 \).

Compute numerator at 0:

\( -\frac{1}{720}(0 - 2)(0 - 3)(0 - 4)(0 - 5)(0 - 6)(0 - 7) + 0 \)

Simplify each term:

\( (-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6)(-7) \)

Compute step by step:

First, multiply two at a time:

\( (-2)(-3) = 6 \)

\( 6 \times (-4) = -24 \)

\( (-24) \times (-5) = 120 \)

\( 120 \times (-6) = -720 \)

\( (-720) \times (-7) = 5040 \)

So, the product is 5040.

Multiply by \( -1/720 \):

\( -1/720 \times 5040 = -5040 / 720 = -7 \)

Add 0: numerator is -7.

Denominator at x=0: \( 0^2 - 1 = -1 \)

So, \( p(0) = (-7)/(-1) = 7 \). Wait, but according to the original definition, \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) only for \( n = 2, 3, ..., 7 \). So, \( p(0) \) isn't defined by that equation, but according to our polynomial, it's 7. That's okay, because \( p(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 5, it's defined everywhere, but \( p(0) \) isn't necessarily equal to \( 0/(0^2 -1) \) because 0 isn't in the domain where the equation is given.

But just to check, does this value make sense? Since we have a polynomial that passes through those points, and we've constructed it correctly, so maybe 7 is correct. Hmm, I don't have a specific reason to doubt that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when computing the product at \( x = 0 \). Let's recalculate:

\( (0 - 2) = -2 \)

\( (0 - 3) = -3 \)

\( (0 - 4) = -4 \)

\( (0 - 5) = -5 \)

\( (0 - 6) = -6 \)

\( (0 - 7) = -7 \)

So, multiplying all together: (-2)(-3) = 6; 6*(-4) = -24; (-24)*(-5)=120; 120*(-6)=-720; (-720)*(-7)=5040.

So, correct, 5040.

Then, \( -1/720 * 5040 = -7 \), yeah, so numerator is -7, denominator is -1, so \( p(0) = 7 \). That seems okay. So, no problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can test another point, like \( x = 1 \). Wait, but \( x = 1 \) isn't in the original points, but as I mentioned, \( p(1) \) is just defined by the polynomial, but the original equation doesn't specify it.

Alternatively, let's compute \( p(8) \) again just to double-check.

So, numerator at 8:

\( -1/720 * (6*5*4*3*2*1) + 8 = -1/720 * 720 + 8 = -1 + 8 = 7 \)

Denominator at 8: 64 -1 = 63

So, \( 7/63 = 1/9 \). Yup, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem, perhaps using the method of finite differences or something else, but I think the method I used is solid. I constructed \( q(x) \) such that it's a degree 7 polynomial with roots at 2 through 7, then expressed \( q(x) \) as \( c \) times that polynomial, found \( c \) by plugging in \( x = 1 \), since that's a point where the numerator must be zero.

This gives me the constant \( c \), then I can write \( p(x) \) and evaluate it at 8. So, I think 1/9 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{9}}
</think>

Given a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree 5 such that \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, \ldots, 7 \), we need to find \( p(8) \).

First, we define a new polynomial \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \). This polynomial \( q(x) \) has roots at \( x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), so it can be written as:
\[ q(x) = c(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) \]
where \( c \) is a constant. Therefore, we have:
\[ (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x = c(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) \]

To find the constant \( c \), we substitute \( x = 1 \) into the equation, which makes the left-hand side zero because the denominator \( x^2 - 1 \) is zero. This gives:
\[ c(1 - 2)(1 - 3)(1 - 4)(1 - 5)(1 - 6)(1 - 7) + 1 = 0 \]
Calculating the product of the terms:
\[ (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6) = 720 \]
Thus, we have:
\[ c \times 720 + 1 = 0 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = -\frac{1}{720} \]

Now, we can write \( p(x) \) as:
\[ p(x) = \frac{-\frac{1}{720}(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) + x}{x^2 - 1} \]

To find \( p(8) \), we substitute \( x = 8 \) into this expression:
\[ p(8) = \frac{-\frac{1}{720}(8 - 2)(8 - 3)(8 - 4)(8 - 5)(8 - 6)(8 - 7) + 8}{8^2 - 1} \]
Calculating the numerator:
\[ (8 - 2)(8 - 3)(8 - 4)(8 - 5)(8 - 6)(8 - 7) = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720 \]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[ -\frac{1}{720} \times 720 + 8 = -1 + 8 = 7 \]
The denominator is:
\[ 8^2 - 1 = 64 - 1 = 63 \]
Therefore, \( p(8) \) is:
\[ p(8) = \frac{7}{63} = \frac{1}{9} \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{9}}
\]
