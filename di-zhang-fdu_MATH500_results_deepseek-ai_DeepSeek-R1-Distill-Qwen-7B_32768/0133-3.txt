Question:
For what values of $x$ is it true that $x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10$? Express your answer in interval notation.

Correct Answer:
Re-arranging, $x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0$. The left-hand quadratic factors as $x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0$. Thus, $x-7$ and $x+2$ have opposite signs, so $-2 \le x \le 7$ and $\boxed{x \in [-2,7]}$.

Gold:
x\in[-2,7]

Wrong Prediction:
[-2,7]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: \(x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10\). Hmm, I need to find all the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality. Alright, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with quadratic inequalities, it's helpful to bring all terms to one side so that we can have a standard quadratic expression on one side and zero on the other. That way, we can find the critical points and test intervals. So, let's subtract 10 from both sides to move the 10 to the left.

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \le 0
\]
Simplifying that, we combine the constants:
\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0
\]
Alright, so now the inequality is \(x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0\). The next step is to factor this quadratic if possible, or if not, find its roots using the quadratic formula. Let me see if this quadratic factors nicely.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to \(-14\) and add up to \(-5\). Hmm, let's list the factors of 14: 1 and 14, 2 and 7. Since the product is negative, one of them needs to be positive and the other negative. Let's try 2 and -7: 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. Perfect, that works.

So, we can factor \(x^2 - 5x - 14\) as:
\[
(x + 2)(x - 7) \le 0
\]
Wait, let me check that. Multiply \((x + 2)(x - 7)\): \(x \times x = x^2\), \(x \times (-7) = -7x\), \(2 \times x = 2x\), and \(2 \times (-7) = -14\). Combining the middle terms: \(-7x + 2x = -5x\). Yeah, that gives \(x^2 -5x -14\). Perfect, so factoring is correct.

Now, we have the inequality:
\[
(x + 2)(x - 7) \le 0
\]
To solve this, I remember that the product of two terms is less than or equal to zero when one is non-positive and the other is non-negative, i.e., when one factor is zero or they have opposite signs.

First, let's find the roots of the quadratic, which are the critical points. Setting each factor equal to zero:
1. \(x + 2 = 0\) leads to \(x = -2\)
2. \(x - 7 = 0\) leads to \(x = 7\)

These roots divide the number line into three intervals:
1. \( (-\infty, -2) \)
2. \( (-2, 7) \)
3. \( (7, \infty) \)

Now, we can test each interval to see where the product \((x + 2)(x - 7)\) is less than or equal to zero.

Let's pick test points from each interval:

1. For \( (-\infty, -2) \), let's choose \(x = -3\):
   \[
   (-3 + 2)(-3 - 7) = (-1)(-10) = 10
   \]
   10 is positive, which doesn't satisfy the inequality \( \le 0 \).

2. For \( (-2, 7) \), let's choose \(x = 0\):
   \[
   (0 + 2)(0 - 7) = (2)(-7) = -14
   \]
   -14 is negative, which satisfies the inequality.

3. For \( (7, \infty) \), let's choose \(x = 8\):
   \[
   (8 + 2)(8 - 7) = (10)(1) = 10
   \]
   10 is positive, which doesn't satisfy the inequality.

Now, we also need to check the critical points \(x = -2\) and \(x = 7\) because the inequality is non-strict (\(\le 0\)).

At \(x = -2\):
\[
(-2 + 2)(-2 - 7) = (0)(-9) = 0
\]
Which satisfies the inequality.

At \(x = 7\):
\[
(7 + 2)(7 - 7) = (9)(0) = 0
\]
Which also satisfies the inequality.

So, the solution includes the intervals where the product is negative and the critical points themselves. That is, the interval \( [-2, 7] \).

Wait, let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The quadratic was \(x^2 -5x -14\), factored into \((x + 2)(x -7)\). The critical points at -2 and 7, testing the intervals, we found that the middle interval (-2, 7) gives a negative product, and the endpoints themselves yield zero, which is included in the solution. So, the solution is all real numbers from -2 to 7, including -2 and 7.

Just to ensure thoroughness, maybe I can graph the quadratic to visualize this. The quadratic \(y = x^2 -5x -14\) is a parabola opening upwards because the coefficient of \(x^2\) is positive. The roots are at -2 and 7, so the parabola crosses the x-axis at these points. Since it opens upwards, the graph will be below or on the x-axis between the roots, meaning \(y \le 0\) between -2 and 7. That matches our earlier conclusion.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that since the parabola opens upwards, the expression \(x^2 -5x -14\) is negative between its two roots. So, the inequality \(x^2 -5x -14 \le 0\) is true for \(x\) between -2 and 7, inclusive.

Hmm, just to make sure, let me plug in a number just outside the interval, say \(x = -3\), which we did earlier, and it gave a positive result, which is correct because it's outside the solution. Similarly, \(x = 8\) also gave positive, so that's consistent.

Thus, I think I'm confident that the solution is \( [-2, 7] \).

**Final Answer**
The values of \(x\) that satisfy the inequality are \boxed{[-2, 7]}.
</think>

To solve the inequality \(x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10\), we first move all terms to one side:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \le 0
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0
\]

Next, we factor the quadratic expression:

\[
(x + 2)(x - 7) \le 0
\]

The roots of the quadratic are found by setting each factor to zero:

1. \(x + 2 = 0\) leads to \(x = -2\)
2. \(x - 7 = 0\) leads to \(x = 7\)

These roots divide the number line into three intervals: \((-∞, -2)\), \((-2, 7)\), and \((7, ∞)\). We test each interval to determine where the product is non-positive.

1. For \(x = -3\) in \((-∞, -2)\), the product is positive.
2. For \(x = 0\) in \((-2, 7)\), the product is negative.
3. For \(x = 8\) in \((7, ∞)\), the product is positive.

We also check the critical points \(x = -2\) and \(x = 7\):

- At \(x = -2\), the product is zero.
- At \(x = 7\), the product is zero.

Thus, the solution includes the interval where the product is negative and the critical points themselves. Therefore, the solution is:

\[
\boxed{[-2, 7]}
\]
