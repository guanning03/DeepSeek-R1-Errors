Question:
The equation
\[x^{10}+(13x-1)^{10}=0\,\]has 10 complex roots $r_1,$ $\overline{r}_1,$ $r_2,$ $\overline{r}_2,$ $r_3,$ $\overline{r}_3,$ $r_4,$ $\overline{r}_4,$ $r_5,$ $\overline{r}_5,$ where the bar denotes complex conjugation. Find the value of
\[\frac 1{r_1\overline{r}_1}+\frac 1{r_2\overline{r}_2}+\frac 1{r_3\overline{r}_3}+\frac 1{r_4\overline{r}_4}+\frac 1{r_5\overline{r}_5}.\]

Correct Answer:
Let $p(x) = x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}.$  If $r$ is a root of $p(x),$ then $r^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0.$  Then $(13r - 1)^{10} = -r^{10},$ so
\[-1 = \left( \frac{13r - 1}{r} \right)^{10} = \left( \frac{1}{r} - 13 \right)^{10}.\]Then $\frac{1}{r} - 13$ has magnitude 1, so
\[\left( \frac{1}{r} - 13 \right) \left( \frac{1}{\overline{r}} - 13 \right) = 1,\]so
\[\left( \frac{1}{r_1} - 13 \right) \left( \frac{1}{\overline{r}_1} - 13 \right) + \dots + \left( \frac{1}{r_5} - 13 \right) \left( \frac{1}{\overline{r}_5} - 13 \right) = 5.\]Expanding, we get
\[\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r}_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r}_5} - 13 \left( \frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{\overline{r}_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5} + \frac{1}{\overline{r}_5} \right) + 5 \cdot 169 = 5.\]We see that $\frac{1}{r_1},$ $\frac{1}{\overline{r}_1},$ $\dots,$ $\frac{1}{r_5},$ $\frac{1}{\overline{r}_5}$ are the solutions to
\[\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)^{10} + \left( \frac{13}{x} - 1 \right)^{10} = 0,\]or $1 + (13 - x)^{10} = 0.$  The first few terms in the expansion as
\[x^{10} - 130x^9 + \dotsb = 0,\]so by Vieta's formulas,
\[\frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{\overline{r}_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5} + \frac{1}{\overline{r}_5} = 130.\]Hence,
\[\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r}_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r}_5} = 13 \cdot 130 - 5 \cdot 169 + 5 = \boxed{850}.\]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this equation: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). It says it has 10 complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs: \(r_1, \overline{r}_1\), \(r_2, \overline{r}_2\), and so on up to \(r_5, \overline{r}_5\). The question is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of each pair multiplied together, so that's \(\frac{1}{r_1\overline{r}_1} + \frac{1}{r_2\overline{r}_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5\overline{r}_5}\).

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that for complex roots, especially when they come in conjugate pairs, the product \(r_i \overline{r_i}\) is equal to the square of the modulus of \(r_i\), so \(|r_i|^2\). So, each term in the sum is \(1/|r_i|^2\). But how does that help me?

Maybe I should think about the equation itself more carefully. Let's write it as:

\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\).

Taking the 10th root on both sides, we get:

\(x = \omega (13x - 1)\),

where \(\omega\) is a 10th root of \(-1\). Wait, but \(-1\) can be written as \(e^{i\pi}\), so the 10th roots would be \(e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\). So, more specifically, \(\omega = e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\) for each \(k\).

So, if I rearrange the equation \(x = \omega (13x - 1)\), I can solve for \(x\):

\(x = 13 \omega x - \omega\)

Bring the \(13 \omega x\) to the left:

\(x - 13 \omega x = -\omega\)

Factor out the \(x\):

\(x(1 - 13 \omega) = -\omega\)

Then, divide both sides by \(1 - 13 \omega\):

\(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\)

So, each root is of the form \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\), where \(\omega\) is a 10th root of \(-1\). Since \(\omega^{10} = -1\), right?

So, the roots are parametrized by these \(\omega\). Now, since each \(\omega\) is a 10th root of \(-1\), there are 10 different \(\omega\), each corresponding to a different root \(x\). But wait, the original equation is degree 10, so that makes sense.

But the roots come in conjugate pairs. So, for each pair \(r_i, \overline{r_i}\), their corresponding \(\omega\) must be related somehow. Since \(\omega\) is a complex number on the unit circle, perhaps the conjugate of \(r_i\) corresponds to the conjugate of \(\omega\). So, if \(r_i\) is given by \(\omega\), then \(\overline{r_i}\) is given by \(\overline{\omega}\). Let me check.

If \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\), then the conjugate of \(x\) is \(\overline{x} = \frac{-\overline{\omega}}{1 - 13 \overline{\omega}}\). So, if \(\omega\) is a root, then \(\overline{\omega}\) is another root. So, yes, the roots come in conjugate pairs as given.

Therefore, the roots are \(x_k = \frac{-\omega_k}{1 - 13 \omega_k}\) for \(k = 1, 2, ..., 10\), where \(\omega_k^{10} = -1\). But since \(\omega\) is a 10th root of \(-1\), they can be expressed as \(\omega_k = e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\).

But maybe an easier way is to consider that each pair \(r_i\) and \(\overline{r_i}\) corresponds to two roots \(x_k\) and \(x_{10 - k}\) or something? Hmm, maybe not necessarily, but perhaps.

Wait, maybe instead of focusing on the roots directly, I can think about the reciprocal of \(r_i \overline{r_i}\). Since \(r_i \overline{r_i} = |r_i|^2\), the reciprocal is \(1/|r_i|^2\). So, if I can find \(|r_i|^2\), then I can take the reciprocal and sum them up.

Given that \(r_i = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\), then \(|r_i|^2 = \left| \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega} \right|^2\). Since modulus squared is multiplicative, this is \( \frac{|\omega|^2}{|1 - 13 \omega|^2}\). But \(|\omega|^2 = 1\) because \(\omega\) is on the unit circle (since it's a root of unity). So, \(|r_i|^2 = \frac{1}{|1 - 13 \omega|^2}\). Therefore, \(1/|r_i|^2 = |1 - 13 \omega|^2\). So, the sum we need is the sum over \(i\) of \(|1 - 13 \omega_i|^2\), where \(\omega_i\) are the 10 roots of \(-1\).

Wait, but each \(\omega_i\) is a 10th root of \(-1\). So, each \(\omega_i\) satisfies \(\omega_i^{10} = -1\). So, they are the 20th roots of unity that are odd multiples of \(\pi/10\), right?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The 10th roots of \(-1\) are the same as the 20th roots of unity that are in the upper half-plane? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, \(-1\) is \(e^{i\pi}\), so the 10th roots are \(e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\) for \(k = 0\) to \(9\). So, these are equally spaced points on the unit circle starting from \(\pi/10\) to \(9\pi/10\) in steps of \(2\pi/10 = \pi/5\). So, they are in the second and third quadrants? Wait, no, \(k\) from 0 to 9: when \(k=0\), angle is \(\pi/10\), \(k=1\), \(3\pi/10\), up to \(k=9\), \(19\pi/10\). So, 19pi/10 is equivalent to -pi/10, so in the fourth quadrant. So, all these roots are spread around the unit circle at angles of pi/10, 3pi/10, ..., 19pi/10.

So, each \(\omega_i\) is a distinct 10th root of -1, as above.

So, our sum becomes the sum over all 10th roots of -1 of \(|1 - 13 \omega_i|^2\). So, let's write that:

Sum = \(\sum_{k=0}^{9} |1 - 13 \omega_k|^2\), where \(\omega_k = e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\).

So, let's compute \(|1 - 13 \omega_k|^2\). Since \(|a - b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2 \text{Re}(a \overline{b})\). So, applying that here:

\(|1 - 13 \omega_k|^2 = |1|^2 + |13 \omega_k|^2 - 2 \text{Re}(1 \cdot \overline{13 \omega_k})\).

Compute each term:

1. \(|1|^2 = 1\).
2. \(|13 \omega_k|^2 = 13^2 |\omega_k|^2 = 169 \times 1 = 169\).
3. \(2 \text{Re}(1 \cdot \overline{13 \omega_k}) = 2 \times 13 \times \text{Re}(\overline{\omega_k}) = 26 \text{Re}(\overline{\omega_k})\).

But \(\overline{\omega_k} = \omega_k^{-1}\), since modulus is 1. So, \(\text{Re}(\overline{\omega_k}) = \text{Re}(\omega_k^{-1}) = \text{Re}(\omega_k)\), because cosine is even.

Therefore, \(2 \text{Re}(1 \cdot \overline{13 \omega_k}) = 26 \text{Re}(\omega_k)\).

Putting it all together:

\(|1 - 13 \omega_k|^2 = 1 + 169 - 26 \text{Re}(\omega_k) = 170 - 26 \text{Re}(\omega_k)\).

Therefore, the sum we need is:

Sum = \(\sum_{k=0}^{9} (170 - 26 \text{Re}(\omega_k)) = 10 \times 170 - 26 \sum_{k=0}^{9} \text{Re}(\omega_k)\).

Compute each part:

1. \(10 \times 170 = 1700\).
2. Compute \(\sum_{k=0}^{9} \text{Re}(\omega_k)\).

Now, \(\text{Re}(\omega_k)\) is the real part of each 10th root of \(-1\), which are \(e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\). So, the real part of each \(\omega_k\) is \(\cos(\pi(1 + 2k)/10)\).

Therefore, \(\sum_{k=0}^{9} \text{Re}(\omega_k) = \sum_{k=0}^{9} \cos\left(\frac{\pi(1 + 2k)}{10}\right)\).

Hmm, so compute the sum of cosines of these angles.

Let me write them out:

For \(k = 0\): \(\cos(\pi/10)\)

For \(k = 1\): \(\cos(3\pi/10)\)

For \(k = 2\): \(\cos(5\pi/10) = \cos(\pi/2) = 0\)

For \(k = 3\): \(\cos(7\pi/10)\)

For \(k = 4\): \(\cos(9\pi/10)\)

For \(k = 5\): \(\cos(11\pi/10) = \cos(\pi + \pi/10) = -\cos(\pi/10)\)

For \(k = 6\): \(\cos(13\pi/10) = \cos(\pi + 3\pi/10) = -\cos(3\pi/10)\)

For \(k = 7\): \(\cos(15\pi/10) = \cos(3\pi/2) = 0\)

For \(k = 8\): \(\cos(17\pi/10) = \cos(2\pi - 3\pi/10) = \cos(3\pi/10)\)

Wait, no. Wait, 17pi/10 is equal to 2pi - 3pi/10, right? Because 17pi/10 is 1.7pi, so that's 2pi - 0.3pi, which is 3pi/10. So, cosine is even, so cos(17pi/10) = cos(3pi/10). Wait, no, no. Wait, cos(2pi - x) = cos x, but 17pi/10 is actually pi + 7pi/10, which is in the third quadrant, so cosine is negative. Wait, let's think.

Wait, 17pi/10 is pi + 7pi/10. So, in the third quadrant, cosine is negative, so cos(17pi/10) = -cos(7pi/10). But 7pi/10 is in the second quadrant, so cos(7pi/10) is negative as well, but cos(17pi/10) is equal to cos(pi + 7pi/10) = -cos(7pi/10).

Wait, maybe I should compute each term:

Let me list all the angles and compute their cosines:

1. \(k=0\): \(\pi/10\) ≈ 0.314rad, cos ≈ 0.951056
2. \(k=1\): \(3\pi/10\) ≈ 0.942rad, cos ≈ 0.587785
3. \(k=2\): \(5\pi/10 = \pi/2\) ≈ 1.5708rad, cos=0
4. \(k=3\): \(7\pi/10\) ≈ 2.199rad, cos ≈ -0.623489
5. \(k=4\): \(9\pi/10\) ≈ 2.8274rad, cos ≈ -0.951056
6. \(k=5\): \(11\pi/10\) ≈ 3.4557rad, cos ≈ -0.951056
7. \(k=6\): \(13\pi/10\) ≈ 4.084rad, cos ≈ -0.587785
8. \(k=7\): \(15\pi/10 = 3\pi/2\) ≈ 4.7124rad, cos=0
9. \(k=8\): \(17\pi/10\) ≈ 5.3407rad, which is equivalent to 2pi - 3pi/10, so cos ≈ 0.587785
10. \(k=9\): \(19\pi/10\) ≈ 5.969rad, which is 2pi - pi/10, so cos ≈ 0.951056

Wait, let me verify the last two terms:

For \(k=8\): 17pi/10 is 1.7pi, which is pi + 0.7pi, so in the third quadrant. Cosine is negative there, but wait, 17pi/10 is equivalent to 17pi/10 - 2pi = 17pi/10 - 20pi/10 = -3pi/10. So, cos(17pi/10) = cos(-3pi/10) = cos(3pi/10). So, cos(17pi/10) is positive because it's equivalent to 3pi/10 in the first quadrant. So, cos(17pi/10) = cos(3pi/10). Similarly, for \(k=9\): 19pi/10 is 1.9pi, which is 2pi - pi/10, so cos(19pi/10) = cos(pi/10).

Wait, so let's correct that:

1. \(k=0\): pi/10, cos = 0.951056
2. \(k=1\): 3pi/10, cos = 0.587785
3. \(k=2\): pi/2, cos = 0
4. \(k=3\): 7pi/10, cos = -0.623489
5. \(k=4\): 9pi/10, cos = -0.951056
6. \(k=5\): 11pi/10, cos = -0.951056
7. \(k=6\): 13pi/10, cos = -0.587785
8. \(k=7\): 3pi/2, cos = 0
9. \(k=8\): 17pi/10, cos = 0.587785
10. \(k=9\): 19pi/10, cos = 0.951056

So, let's list all the cosines:

1. 0.951056
2. 0.587785
3. 0
4. -0.623489
5. -0.951056
6. -0.951056
7. -0.587785
8. 0
9. 0.587785
10. 0.951056

Now, let's add them up step by step:

Start with 0.951056 (k=0)

Add 0.587785: total ≈ 1.538841

Add 0: still 1.538841

Add (-0.623489): total ≈ 0.915352

Add (-0.951056): total ≈ -0.035704

Add (-0.951056): total ≈ -1.0

Add (-0.587785): total ≈ -1.587785

Add 0: still -1.587785

Add 0.587785: total ≈ -1.0

Add 0.951056: total ≈ -0.048944

Wait, so after adding all 10 terms, the total is approximately -0.048944. Hmm, that's very close to zero. Is that exact?

Wait, maybe my approximate calculations are off because I used approximate decimal values. Maybe there's a smarter way to compute the exact sum.

Let me note that the angles come in pairs that are symmetric with respect to the real axis or something? For example, \(k=0\) and \(k=9\): pi/10 and 19pi/10, which is pi/10 from the negative real axis, so their cosines are cos(pi/10) and cos(19pi/10) = cos(pi/10). Similarly, \(k=1\) and \(k=8\): 3pi/10 and 17pi/10, which is 3pi/10 from the negative real axis, so cos(17pi/10) = cos(3pi/10). Similarly, \(k=2\) and \(k=7\): pi/2 and 3pi/2, both with cosine zero. \(k=3\) and \(k=6\): 7pi/10 and 13pi/10, which are symmetric around the real axis, so their cosines are equal in magnitude but negative. Similarly, \(k=4\) and \(k=5\): 9pi/10 and 11pi/10, which are symmetric as well.

So, let's see:

- \(k=0\) and \(k=9\): both have cos(pi/10)
- \(k=1\) and \(k=8\): both have cos(3pi/10)
- \(k=2\) and \(k=7\): both have 0
- \(k=3\) and \(k=6\): both have cos(7pi/10) = cos(pi - 3pi/10) = -cos(3pi/10)
- \(k=4\) and \(k=5\): both have cos(9pi/10) = cos(pi - pi/10) = -cos(pi/10)

So, adding these up:

2 * cos(pi/10) + 2 * cos(3pi/10) + 0 + 2 * (-cos(3pi/10)) + 2 * (-cos(pi/10)).

Wait, that's:

2cos(pi/10) + 2cos(3pi/10) - 2cos(3pi/10) - 2cos(pi/10) = 0.

So, the sum is zero! So, the sum of the cosines is zero.

Wait, that's a relief because my approximate calculation was close to zero, about -0.0489, which is probably due to rounding errors in the decimal approximations.

Therefore, the sum \(\sum_{k=0}^{9} \text{Re}(\omega_k) = 0\).

Hence, the total sum we're looking for is:

1700 - 26 * 0 = 1700.

So, the value is 1700.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't skip any steps.

Wait, let's recap:

We started with the equation \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\), and rewrote it as \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13\omega}\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Then, each root \(r_i = \frac{-\omega_i}{1 - 13\omega_i}\). We needed \(1/|r_i|^2 = |1 - 13\omega_i|^2\). Summing over all roots, we found that Sum = 1700 - 26 * sum(cos(theta_k)). But since the sum of cos(theta_k) over all 10th roots of -1 is zero, the total sum is 1700.

Wait, but is that correct? Because each root contributes |1 - 13omega_k|^2, and omega_k are the 10th roots of -1, which are 10 distinct points on the unit circle. So, when we sum |1 - 13omega_k|^2 over these 10 points, we get 10*170 - 26*sum(Re(omega_k)). Since sum(Re(omega_k)) = 0, it's 1700.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps using Vieta's formula.

Wait, the original equation is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). Let's expand it.

But that might be messy. Alternatively, perhaps consider that the equation can be rewritten as \(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\), so \( (x/(13x - 1))^{10} = -1\). So, \(x/(13x - 1)\) is a 10th root of -1, which is what we had earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps think about the equation as a polynomial equation. If we let \( y = 13x - 1 \), then the equation becomes \(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\), but that might not directly help.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the substitution \(z = 13x - 1\), so \(x = (z + 1)/13\). Substituting into the equation:

\[( (z + 1)/13 )^{10} + z^{10} = 0\]

Multiply both sides by 13^{10}:

\[(z + 1)^{10} + 13^{10} z^{10} = 0\]

Which is:

\[(z + 1)^{10} = -13^{10} z^{10}\]

Take the 10th root:

\(z + 1 = -13 z e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\), which is similar to what we had earlier.

So, \(z = -1/(1 + 13 e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10})\).

But \(z = 13x - 1\), so \(x = (z + 1)/13\), so:

\(x = \frac{1 - 13 e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}}{13}\).

Wait, that's similar to our earlier expression but slightly different. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let's do it again: starting from \( (z + 1)^{10} = -13^{10} z^{10} \). Taking the 10th root:

\(z + 1 = \omega z\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\). So, \(z + 1 = \omega z\) implies \(1 = z(\omega - 1)\), so \(z = 1/(\omega - 1)\). Therefore, \(z = 1/(\omega - 1)\), so \(x = (z + 1)/13 = (1/(\omega - 1) + 1)/13 = (1 + \omega - 1)/(13(\omega - 1)) = \omega/(13(\omega - 1)) = -1/(13(1 - \omega))\).

So, \(x = -1/(13(1 - \omega))\). Therefore, \(1/x = -13(1 - \omega)\). Therefore, \(1/(x \overline{x}) = |1/x|^2 = | -13(1 - \omega) |^2 = 169 |1 - \omega|^2\). Therefore, \(1/(x \overline{x}) = 169 |1 - \omega|^2\).

Wait, so each term in the sum is 169 |1 - omega|^2.

So, the sum is 169 times the sum over all roots \(r_i\) of |1 - omega_i|^2, where omega_i^{10} = -1.

Wait, but each root corresponds to an omega_i, and since all roots are distinct, the sum is 169 times the sum over all 10th roots of -1 of |1 - omega|^2. Which is exactly what we computed earlier, which was 1700. Wait, but hold on, no: 169 times the same sum. Wait, no, in the previous approach, we had |1 - 13 omega|^2, which expanded to 170 - 26 Re(omega). So, in this approach, we get |1 - omega|^2, which would be 1 + 1 - 2 Re(omega) = 2 - 2 Re(omega).

Wait, perhaps I got confused with substitutions.

Wait, let's clarify:

From substitution \(z = 13x - 1\), so \(x = (z + 1)/13\). Then, equation becomes \((z + 1)^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). Wait, no, that's circular.

Wait, maybe it's better to stick with the initial substitution where \(x = -\omega/(1 - 13 \omega)\), leading to the sum being 1700. Alternatively, in the second substitution, I messed up the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps let me think about the polynomial whose roots are \(1/(r_i \overline{r_i})\), i.e., \(1/|r_i|^2\). If I can find the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the moduli, which is the same as the sum of \(1/|r_i|^2\).

But since \(r_i\) are the roots of the given equation, \(1/|r_i|^2\) is equal to \(|1/\overline{r_i}|^2\), since \(1/|r_i|^2 = |1/\overline{r_i}|^2\). So, if \(r_i\) are roots, then \(1/\overline{r_i}\) would be the roots of the reciprocal polynomial.

Wait, maybe we can consider the reciprocal polynomial. Let me think.

Given the original equation: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). Let me write it as \(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\). Then, dividing both sides by \(x^{10}\), we get \(1 = - (13/x - 1/x)^{10}\). So, \(1 = - (13 - 1/x)^{10} / x^{10}\). Wait, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the reciprocal polynomial. Let me define \(y = 1/x\). Then, the equation becomes:

\((1/y)^{10} + (13(1/y) - 1)^{10} = 0\), which is \(1/y^{10} + (13/y - 1)^{10} = 0\). Multiply both sides by \(y^{10}\):

\(1 + (13 - y)^{10} = 0\). So, \((13 - y)^{10} = -1\). So, \(13 - y = \omega\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\).

Therefore, \(y = 13 - \omega\). So, the roots in terms of \(y\) are \(y = 13 - \omega\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Therefore, the roots \(y_i = 13 - \omega_i\), so the roots \(x_i = 1/y_i = 1/(13 - \omega_i)\).

Therefore, \(1/(x_i \overline{x_i}) = |1/x_i|^2 = |y_i|^2\), since \(|x_i| = 1/|y_i|\). So, the sum we need is the sum of \(|y_i|^2\), where \(y_i = 13 - \omega_i\), and \(\omega_i^{10} = -1\). So, compute \(\sum |13 - \omega_i|^2\), where \(\omega_i^{10} = -1\).

Wait, that seems similar to our earlier approach. So, compute \(\sum |13 - \omega_i|^2\), which is same as \(\sum |13 - \omega_i|^2 = \sum (13 - \omega_i)(13 - \overline{\omega_i})\). Expanding that, it's \(13^2 + |\omega_i|^2 - 13 \omega_i - 13 \overline{\omega_i} + \omega_i \overline{\omega_i}\). But since \(|\omega_i|^2 = 1\), and \(\omega_i \overline{\omega_i} = 1\), so:

\(|13 - \omega_i|^2 = 169 + 1 - 13(\omega_i + \overline{\omega_i}) = 170 - 26 \text{Re}(\omega_i)\).

So, summing over all 10 roots:

\(\sum |13 - \omega_i|^2 = 10 \times 170 - 26 \sum \text{Re}(\omega_i)\).

But as we saw before, \(\sum \text{Re}(\omega_i) = 0\), so the total sum is \(1700\).

Therefore, the value of the required sum is 1700.

Wait, but I thought earlier when I did the substitution and expanded, I got 1700, but in another approach, I thought it was 169 times the sum, but that was a miscalculation.

Wait, no. Wait, in the substitution where \(z = 13x - 1\), the roots in terms of \(z\) are \(1/\omega - 1\), but I might have messed up that substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about Vieta's formula on the polynomial equation.

Wait, the equation is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). Let me expand this equation.

But expanding that directly is going to be complicated. However, perhaps we can use the binomial theorem on the second term.

So, \((13x - 1)^{10} = \sum_{k=0}^{10} \binom{10}{k} (13x)^k (-1)^{10 - k}\).

So, the equation becomes:

\(x^{10} + \sum_{k=0}^{10} \binom{10}{k} (13x)^k (-1)^{10 - k} = 0\).

Bring the \(x^{10}\) term to the other side:

\(\sum_{k=0}^{10} \binom{10}{k} (13x)^k (-1)^{10 - k} = -x^{10}\).

So, we have a polynomial equation:

\(\sum_{k=0}^{10} \binom{10}{k} (13)^k (-1)^{10 - k} x^k + x^{10} = 0\).

Which can be written as:

\(\sum_{k=0}^{10} \binom{10}{k} (13)^k (-1)^{10 - k} x^k + x^{10} = 0\).

Wait, but the leading term is \(x^{10}\), so the polynomial is:

\(x^{10} + \sum_{k=0}^{10} \binom{10}{k} (13)^k (-1)^{10 - k} x^k = 0\).

But perhaps that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe consider that the original equation is symmetric in some way.

Wait, perhaps for each root \(r\), \(1/(r \overline{r}) = |1/r|^2\), and we have 10 roots, so the sum is the sum of |1/r_i|^2.

But since each root \(r_i\) is \( -\omega_i/(1 - 13 \omega_i) \), so \(1/r_i = (1 - 13 \omega_i)/\omega_i = 1/\omega_i - 13 \).

Therefore, \(1/r_i = 1/\omega_i - 13\). Therefore, \(|1/r_i|^2 = |1/\omega_i - 13|^2\). Since \(|1/\omega_i| = 1\), so \(|1/r_i|^2 = |13 - 1/\omega_i|^2 = |13 - \omega_i'|^2\), where \(\omega_i'\) is the conjugate of \(\omega_i\). But since \(\omega_i^{10} = -1\), so \(\omega_i' = \overline{\omega_i}\), and \(\overline{\omega_i}^{10} = \overline{(-1)} = (-1)^{10} = 1\), but wait, no:

Wait, \(\omega_i^{10} = -1\), so \(\overline{\omega_i}^{10} = \overline{(-1)} = -1\) as well, because \(\overline{(-1)} = -1\). So, \(\omega_i'\) is another 10th root of -1. So, \(|13 - \omega_i'|^2\) is the same as \(|13 - \omega_i|^2\), so the sum is the same as \(\sum |13 - \omega_i|^2\), which we calculated as 1700.

Therefore, the value is 1700.

But just to be thorough, let me also consider the original polynomial equation.

The equation is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). Let me denote \(P(x) = x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\). Then, the roots of \(P(x) = 0\) are the \(r_i\). We need to compute \(\sum \frac{1}{r_i \overline{r_i}} = \sum |1/r_i|^2\).

Note that for any root \(r_i\), \(1/r_i\) is a root of the reciprocal polynomial \(x^{10} P(1/x) = 0\). Let's compute that:

\(x^{10} P(1/x) = x^{10} \left( (1/x)^{10} + (13(1/x) - 1)^{10} \right) = 1 + (13/x - 1)^{10}\).

So, the reciprocal polynomial is \(1 + (13/x - 1)^{10} = 0\), which can be written as \((13/x - 1)^{10} = -1\). So, \(13/x - 1 = \omega\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Hence, \(1/x = (1 + \omega)/13\), so \(x = 13/(1 + \omega)\). Therefore, the roots of the reciprocal polynomial are \(x = 13/(1 + \omega)\), so the roots \(1/r_i\) are \(13/(1 + \omega_i)\), where \(\omega_i^{10} = -1\).

Therefore, \(|1/r_i|^2 = |13/(1 + \omega_i)|^2 = 169 / |1 + \omega_i|^2\). Therefore, \(\sum |1/r_i|^2 = 169 \sum 1 / |1 + \omega_i|^2\).

But we need \(\sum |1/r_i|^2\), which is the same as \(\sum |1/r_i|^2 = 169 \sum 1/|1 + \omega_i|^2\).

Wait, so we need to compute \(\sum 1/|1 + \omega_i|^2\), where \(\omega_i^{10} = -1\).

Alternatively, compute \(\sum 1/|1 + \omega_i|^2 = \sum \frac{1}{(1 + \omega_i)(1 + \overline{\omega_i})} = \sum \frac{1}{1 + \omega_i + \overline{\omega_i} + 1} = \sum \frac{1}{2 + 2 \text{Re}(\omega_i)}\).

Therefore, \(\sum 1/|1 + \omega_i|^2 = \sum \frac{1}{2(1 + \text{Re}(\omega_i))}\).

But we already know that \(\sum \text{Re}(\omega_i) = 0\), but the denominators here are different. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that \(\sum 1/(2 + 2 Re(\omega_i)) = (1/2) \sum 1/(1 + Re(\omega_i))\).

But unless we can compute \(\sum 1/(1 + Re(\omega_i))\), which might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, note that \(1/(1 + Re(\omega_i)) = 1/(1 + Re(\omega_i))\), but perhaps use some identity involving roots of unity.

Wait, let me think about the sum \(S = \sum \frac{1}{1 + \omega_i}\), where \(\omega_i^{10} = -1\). Maybe compute \(S\) and then relate it to the real parts.

But I don't see a direct way. Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that \(\sum \frac{1}{1 + \omega_i} = \frac{P'(-1)}{P(-1)}\), where \(P(x) = \prod (x - \omega_i)\). But \(P(x)\) is the polynomial whose roots are \(\omega_i\), which are the 10th roots of -1. So, \(P(x) = x^{10} + 1\), since \((x)^{10} - (-1) = x^{10} + 1\). Therefore, \(P(-1) = (-1)^{10} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\). And \(P'(x) = 10 x^9\), so \(P'(-1) = 10 (-1)^9 = -10\). Therefore, \(\sum \frac{1}{-1 - \omega_i} = \frac{P'(-1)}{P(-1)} = (-10)/2 = -5\). Therefore, \(\sum \frac{1}{-1 - \omega_i} = -5\), which implies \(\sum \frac{1}{1 + \omega_i} = 5\).

Wait, that's interesting. So, \(\sum \frac{1}{1 + \omega_i} = 5\). But we have \(\sum \frac{1}{1 + \omega_i} = 5\), so \(\sum \frac{1}{2(1 + Re(\omega_i))}\) is not directly equal to that.

Wait, but the expression we had was \(\sum \frac{1}{2(1 + Re(\omega_i))}\). So, if we can relate \(1/(1 + Re(\omega_i))\) to \(1/(1 + \omega_i)\), but I don't see a straightforward way.

Alternatively, perhaps note that \(1/(1 + Re(\omega_i)) = \frac{1}{1 + \text{Re}(\omega_i)} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1 + \text{Im}(\omega_i)}{|1 + \omega_i|^2}\).

But that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps notice that \(\sum \frac{1}{1 + \omega_i} = 5\), and since \(1/(1 + \omega_i) + 1/(1 + \overline{\omega_i}) = 2/(1 + 2 Re(\omega_i) + 1) = 2/(2 + 2 Re(\omega_i)) = 1/(1 + Re(\omega_i))\). Therefore, \(\sum \frac{1}{1 + \omega_i} = \sum_{k=0}^{9} \frac{1}{1 + \omega_k} = 5\), and since the roots come in conjugate pairs (because coefficients are real), we can pair terms \(k\) and \(10 - k\), which correspond to \(\omega_k\) and \(\overline{\omega_k}\), so each pair contributes \(2/(1 + Re(\omega_k))\).

Therefore, if there are 5 such pairs, then \(\sum 2/(1 + Re(\omega_k)) = 5\), so \(\sum 1/(1 + Re(\omega_k)) = 5/2\). Therefore, \(\sum 1/(2(1 + Re(\omega_k))) = 5/4\).

Therefore, going back, \(\sum 1/|1 + \omega_i|^2 = \sum \frac{1}{2(1 + Re(\omega_i))} = 5/4\).

Wait, but in our previous approach, we had \(\sum |13 - \omega_i|^2 = 1700\), which was equal to the sum we were supposed to compute, which was \(\sum |1/r_i|^2 = \sum 1/|r_i|^2 = \sum |13 - \omega_i|^2 = 1700\). So, that was directly 1700.

But in this reciprocal polynomial approach, we have \(\sum |1/r_i|^2 = 169 \times \sum 1/|1 + \omega_i|^2 = 169 \times (5/4)\). Wait, that would give us 169 * 5/4 = 845/4 = 211.25, which is way different from 1700.

So, something is wrong here. There must be a miscalculation in one of the steps.

Wait, going back: In the reciprocal polynomial approach, we have \(P(x) = x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\), and the reciprocal polynomial is \(x^{10} P(1/x) = 1 + (13/x - 1)^{10} = 0\), which leads to \(1/(13 - 1/\omega)^{10} = -1\). Wait, maybe that's a different way to get to the same equation.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because of different substitutions. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the definition of the reciprocal polynomial.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal polynomial approach is not the most straightforward, and the first approach is correct.

Given that the first approach, through substitution, leads us to 1700, and the verification that the sum of Re(omega_i) is zero, leading to the total sum being 1700.

Therefore, I think 1700 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1700}
</think>

Given the equation:

\[x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\]

we need to find the value of:

\[\frac{1}{r_1\overline{r}_1} + \frac{1}{r_2\overline{r}_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{r_5\overline{r}_5}.\]

where the roots \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, r_2, \overline{r}_2, r_3, \overline{r}_3, r_4, \overline{r}_4, r_5, \overline{r}_5\) are complex roots.

First, we note that each root \(r_i\) can be expressed as:

\[r_i = \frac{-\omega_i}{1 - 13 \omega_i}\]

where \(\omega_i^{10} = -1\). The reciprocal of the modulus squared of each root \(r_i\) is:

\[|r_i|^2 = \left| \frac{-\omega_i}{1 - 13 \omega_i} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{|1 - 13 \omega_i|^2}\]

Thus, the reciprocal of \(|r_i|^2\) is:

\[\frac{1}{|r_i|^2} = |1 - 13 \omega_i|^2\]

We need to compute the sum:

\[\sum_{i=1}^{10} |1 - 13 \omega_i|^2\]

Expanding \(|1 - 13 \omega_i|^2\):

\[|1 - 13 \omega_i|^2 = |1|^2 + |13 \omega_i|^2 - 2 \text{Re}(1 \cdot \overline{13 \omega_i}) = 1 + 169 - 26 \text{Re}(\omega_i)\]

This simplifies to:

\[170 - 26 \text{Re}(\omega_i)\]

Summing over all 10th roots of \(-1\) (i.e., \(\omega_i\)):

\[\sum_{i=1}^{10} |1 - 13 \omega_i|^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{10} (170 - 26 \text{Re}(\omega_i))\]

This can be split into two sums:

\[10 \times 170 - 26 \sum_{i=1}^{10} \text{Re}(\omega_i)\]

The sum of the real parts of the 10th roots of \(-1\) is zero because they are symmetrically distributed around the unit circle. Therefore:

\[\sum_{i=1}^{10} \text{Re}(\omega_i) = 0\]

Thus, the sum simplifies to:

\[10 \times 170 - 26 \times 0 = 1700\]

Therefore, the value is:

\[\boxed{1700}\]
