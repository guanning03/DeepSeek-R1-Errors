Question:
On a particular map, $3$ inches on the map equates to $10$ miles in real life. If you know that the real life distance between two buildings on the map is $53.25$ miles, what would the distance between the buildings be (in inches) on the map, expressed as a fraction?

Correct Answer:
If we let the distance between the buildings on the map be $d$, then $\frac{d}{53.25} = \frac{3}{10}$. Cross-multiplying and solving for $d$, we obtain $10d = 159.75 \Rightarrow d=15.975$ inches. Expressed as a fraction, $d = 15\frac{975}{1000} = \boxed{15\frac{39}{40}},$ or $\boxed{\frac{639}{40}}$ inches.

Gold:
\frac{639}{40}

Wrong Prediction:
\frac{213}{40}

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this map scale problem to solve. Let me read it again: On a particular map, 3 inches on the map equates to 10 miles in real life. If the real life distance between two buildings is 53.25 miles, what would the distance between the buildings be on the map, expressed as a fraction?

Hmm, so I need to figure out how many inches on the map correspond to 53.25 miles in real life. The scale is given as 3 inches equals 10 miles. I think this is a proportion problem where I can set up a ratio of map distance to real life distance.

Let me write down what I know:

- Map distance: 3 inches corresponds to 10 miles real life.

So, if I let x be the map distance that corresponds to 53.25 miles, I can set up a proportion:

3 inches / 10 miles = x inches / 53.25 miles

Yes, that makes sense. So, cross-multiplying, I can solve for x. Let me write that out:

3 * 53.25 = 10 * x

Calculating the left side first: 3 multiplied by 53.25. Hmm, 53.25 divided by 3 is 17.75, so 3 times 53.25 is 160.5. Wait, let me double-check that.

Alternatively, I can think of 53.25 as 53 + 0.25. 3 * 53 is 159, and 3 * 0.25 is 0.75. So, 159 + 0.75 is 159.75. So, 3 * 53.25 is 159.75. Okay, that's better. I must have miscounted earlier.

So, 3 * 53.25 = 159.75

So, 159.75 = 10x

To solve for x, I divide both sides by 10:

x = 159.75 / 10

Which is 15.975 inches.

Hmm, 15.975 inches. But the question says to express it as a fraction. So, I need to convert 15.975 into a fraction.

First, let me write 15.975 as a fraction. The decimal part is 0.975. I know that 0.975 is the same as 975/1000.

So, 15.975 = 15 + 975/1000

But 15 is 15/1, so to add it to 975/1000, I need a common denominator. Let me convert 15 to 15000/1000.

So, 15000/1000 + 975/1000 = (15000 + 975)/1000 = 15975/1000

So, x = 15975/1000 inches.

Now, I can simplify this fraction. Let's see if 15975 and 1000 have any common factors.

First, let's see if both numbers are divisible by 25. 1000 divided by 25 is 40. 15975 divided by 25: 25 goes into 15975 how many times?

25 * 600 = 15,000. 15975 - 15,000 = 975. 25 * 39 = 975. So, 600 + 39 = 639.

So, 15975 / 25 = 639. And 1000 / 25 = 40. So, the fraction becomes 639/40.

Is 639 and 40 divisible by any common factors? Let's check.

40 is 2^3 * 5. 639: Let's see if it's divisible by 2: 639 is odd, so no. Divisible by 5? Last digit is 9, so no. Divisible by 3? Let's add the digits: 6 + 3 + 9 = 18, which is divisible by 3. So, 639 divided by 3 is 213.

Wait, but 40 isn't divisible by 3, so maybe we can divide numerator and denominator by 3? Let me see.

Wait, 639 / 3 = 213, and 40 stays as 40. So, the fraction becomes 213/40.

Is 213 divisible by any factors of 40? 213 is 3 * 71, I think. Let me check: 3*70 is 210, so 3*71 is 213. 40 is 2^3 * 5. No common factors, so 213/40 is the simplified fraction.

Alternatively, I can also write this as a mixed number: 213 divided by 40 is 5 with a remainder of 13, so 5 and 13/40. But as the question says, expressed as a fraction, so 213/40 is fine.

Wait, let me go back through my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, I set up the proportion: 3 inches / 10 miles = x inches / 53.25 miles.

Cross-multiplied: 3 * 53.25 = 10x.

Calculated 3 * 53.25: 3 * 50 is 150, 3 * 3.25 is 9.75, so 150 + 9.75 is 159.75. So, 10x = 159.75, so x = 15.975.

Converted 15.975 to a fraction: 15 and 975/1000. Simplified 975/1000 by dividing numerator and denominator by 25, getting 39/40. Then added 15 as 600/40, so total is 639/40? Wait, hold on, I think I messed up that part.

Wait, 15 is 15/1, which is equal to 15000/1000, right? Because 15 * 1000 is 15000. Then 975/1000 is the decimal part. So, adding them gives 15975/1000.

Then, I divided numerator and denominator by 25, since both are divisible by 25: 15975 / 25 = 639, 1000 /25 = 40, so 639/40.

Then, 639 divided by 3 is 213, so divided numerator and denominator by 3: 213/40. Since 213 and 40 have no common factors, that's the simplest form.

Wait, but 639/40 is equal to 15.975, right? Let me verify: 40 goes into 639 how many times? 40*15 is 600, so 15. Then 639 - 600 is 39, so 15 and 39/40, which is 15.975. Yep, that's correct.

So, x = 213/40 inches.

Wait, but 213/40 is more than 5, since 40*5 is 200. 213-200 is 13, so 5 13/40 inches. That makes sense because 5 inches on the map would be 5*(10/3) miles, which is about 16.666 miles, and since 53.25 is more than that, we need a larger number, so 15.975 inches.

Wait, hold on, that seems inconsistent. 5 inches would be 5*(10/3) miles, which is 50/3 ≈16.666 miles, but 53.25 is about 3.2 times that. Hmm, 15.975 inches is almost 16 inches, which is 16*(10/3)= 160/3 ≈53.333 miles. Wait, so 15.975 inches is slightly less than 16 inches, which is 53.333 miles, but the real-life distance is 53.25 miles, which is just a little less. So, 15.975 inches is correct.

But why is 5 inches on the map equal to 16.666 miles? Because 3 inches is 10 miles, so 1 inch is 10/3 miles. So, 5 inches would be 50/3 miles, which is approximately 16.666 miles.

Wait, but 15.975 inches is how many miles? Let me check: 15.975 inches * (10 miles / 3 inches) = (15.975 * 10)/3 = 159.75 / 3 = 53.25 miles. Yes, that matches.

So, that seems consistent. So, 15.975 inches on the map equals 53.25 miles in real life.

But the question asked for the distance on the map expressed as a fraction. So, 15.975 inches is equal to 15975/1000, which simplifies to 213/40 inches.

Alternatively, 213 divided by 40 is 5.325, but since we need it as a fraction, 213/40 is the answer.

Wait, but 53.25 miles is the real distance. Let me think of another way to approach the problem.

Another way is to find out how many inches correspond to one mile, then multiply that by 53.25.

So, if 3 inches = 10 miles, then 1 mile = 3/10 inches.

Therefore, 53.25 miles = 53.25 * (3/10) inches.

Calculating that: 53.25 * 3 = 159.75; 159.75 /10 =15.975 inches, which is the same as before. So, that's consistent.

Expressed as a fraction, 15.975 is 15 and 975/1000, which is 15 and 39/40, or 639/40.

So, either way, the answer is 213/40 or 5 13/40 inches.

Wait, hold on, earlier I thought 639/40 simplifies to 213/40, but 639 divided by 3 is 213, and 40 divided by 3 is not an integer. So, 213/40 is the simplified fraction. So, that is correct.

So, conclusion: The distance on the map is 213/40 inches, which is equal to 5 13/40 inches.

But the question just says to express it as a fraction, so 213/40 is the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the fraction reduction:

639 divided by 3 is 213, 1000 divided by 3 is approximately 333.333, but since we're dealing with exact fractions, 639/1000 divided by 3 is 213/333.333, which is not helpful. Instead, since we divided numerator and denominator by 25 first to get 639/40, which cannot be reduced further because 639 is 3*7*31 and 40 is 2^3*5, no common factors.

So, yeah, 213/40 is the simplest form.

Therefore, the answer is 213/40 inches.

**Final Answer**
The distance between the buildings on the map is \boxed{\dfrac{213}{40}} inches.
</think>

Given that 3 inches on the map correspond to 10 miles in real life, we need to find the distance on the map for a real life distance of 53.25 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{3 \text{ inches}}{10 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ inches}}{53.25 \text{ miles}}
\]

Cross-multiplying, we get:
\[
3 \times 53.25 = 10x
\]

Calculating the left side:
\[
3 \times 53.25 = 159.75
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
159.75 = 10x
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{159.75}{10} = 15.975
\]

Converting 15.975 to a fraction:
\[
15.975 = 15 + 0.975 = 15 + \frac{975}{1000}
\]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[
\frac{975}{1000} = \frac{39}{40}
\]

So, we have:
\[
15.975 = 15 + \frac{39}{40} = \frac{600}{40} + \frac{39}{40} = \frac{639}{40}
\]

Thus, the distance between the buildings on the map is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{213}{40}}
\]
