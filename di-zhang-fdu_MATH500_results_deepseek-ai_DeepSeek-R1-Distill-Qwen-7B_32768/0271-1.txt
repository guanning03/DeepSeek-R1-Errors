Correct Answer:
From $\triangle PQR$, we have $\angle R = 180^\circ - \angle Q - \angle P = 105^\circ$.  Since $\overline{ST}\parallel \overline{QR}$, we have $\angle STR = 180^\circ - \angle R = \boxed{75^\circ}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first because I find diagrams really helpful in geometry. The problem states that lines ST and QR are parallel, angle P is 40 degrees, and angle Q is 35 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle STR. 

First, I should probably sketch a rough diagram based on the Asymptote code provided. Let me see: points Q and R are on the bottom, with Q at (0,0) and R at (1,0). Point P is at (1.1,0.5), so it's above and to the right of R. Then, points S and T are somewhere in between. S is 0.6 times P, so that would be closer to Q, and T is R plus 0.6 times (P - R), so T is somewhere above R. 

Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws lines from T to S, S to P, P to R, R to Q, and Q to S. So, the figure is a bit complex, but since ST is parallel to QR, that might help us use some properties of parallel lines, maybe corresponding angles or alternate interior angles.

Given that angle P is 40 degrees and angle Q is 35 degrees. Hmm, angle P is at point P, so that must be the angle between lines SP and something else. Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawn as S connected to P, so angle P is probably the angle at point P between SP and PR. Similarly, angle Q is at point Q between PQ and QS.

Wait, let me clarify: the labels say P is at (1.1,0.5), so connected to S, which is 0.6P, so S is at 0.6*(1.1,0.5) = (0.66, 0.3). Then T is R + 0.6*(P - R). Since R is (1,0), and P - R is (0.1,0.5), so 0.6*(0.1,0.5) is (0.06,0.3), so T is (1 + 0.06, 0 + 0.3) = (1.06, 0.3). So, T is at (1.06, 0.3), S is at (0.66, 0.3). So, both T and S are on the same horizontal line y=0.3, which is parallel to QR which is on y=0. So, that makes sense why ST is parallel to QR.

So, the figure is a bit like this: P is above R, connected to S and T; S is connected to Q, and T is connected to R. So, the lines SP and TP are connected to S and T, which are both on the line ST, which is parallel to QR.

Now, given that angle P is 40 degrees. That would be the angle at point P between SP and TP, right? Because in the Asymptote code, P is connected to S and R, but wait, hold on, in the code, it's drawn as T--S--P--R--Q--S. So, the connections are T connected to S, S connected to P, P connected to R, R connected to Q, Q connected to S. So, that makes a polygon-like shape, but not a typical polygon.

Wait, so at point P, the lines connected are S and R? Or is it S and something else? Let me see: P is connected to S and R? Wait, in the code, it's S--P--R, so P is connected to both S and R. So, angle P is at point P between S and R. So, angle at P is 40 degrees, which is between SP and PR.

Similarly, angle Q is 35 degrees, which is at point Q between PQ and QS. So, that's between QP and QS.

We need to find angle STR. So, angle STR is at point T, between S, T, and R. So, that angle is at point T, formed by lines TS and TR.

Since ST is parallel to QR, perhaps we can use some properties of parallel lines, like corresponding angles or alternate interior angles.

Alternatively, maybe triangle PQR or some other triangle could be used to find some angles that are equal because of the parallel lines.

Wait, let's think step by step.

First, in triangle PQR, we know angle Q is 35 degrees, but we don't know angle P or angle R. Wait, but angle P is given as 40 degrees, but is that part of triangle PQR? Or is angle P at point P in another triangle?

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify: In the Asymptote code, P is connected to S and R, S is connected to Q, and T is connected to R. So, actually, points P, S, Q, R, T form some connected lines.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of transversals and parallel lines.

Since ST is parallel to QR, and if we can find a transversal that intersects both, then we can use angle relationships.

Perhaps line PS is a transversal that intersects ST at S and QR at some point. Wait, but QR is from Q to R, and ST is from S to T, which is connected to R. Hmm, maybe that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps line PT is a transversal that intersects ST at T and QR at R. So, since ST || QR, the corresponding angles at T and R would be equal.

But wait, at point T, we have angle STR, which is the angle between ST and RT. At point R, we have angle QRP, but I don't know if that's directly given.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider triangle PQR and triangle PST, since ST is parallel to QR. Maybe they are similar triangles?

Wait, but triangle PST is not necessarily connected to triangle PQR unless they share some angles or sides proportionally. Hmm, maybe that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps we can look at the transversal PR intersecting the parallel lines ST and QR. Then, angle at P (which is 40 degrees) and angle at R would be related.

Wait, if we consider PR as a transversal, then angle at P (40 degrees) and angle at R would be corresponding angles if PR is cutting the two parallel lines. But angle at R is not directly given, so maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, angle Q is 35 degrees. At point Q, between PQ and QS. Maybe triangle PQS has some angles we can figure out.

Let me try to label the points in my mind:

- Q is at the bottom left.

- R is at the bottom right.

- P is above R.

- S is above Q and to the right, connected to P.

- T is above R, connected to S and R.

So, the figure includes triangles PQS and STR. Maybe similar triangles?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that ST is parallel to QR to establish some proportionality.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, S is 0.6P and T is R + 0.6*(P - R). So, that suggests that S divides PQ in a 0.6 ratio, and T divides PR in a 0.6 ratio as well. So, lines PS and PT are connected to S and T, which are 60% along PQ and PR respectively.

Wait, if that's the case, then perhaps triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem). Since ST is parallel to QR, and S and T divide PQ and PR proportionally (0.6), then yes, triangle PST ~ triangle PQR.

If that's the case, then corresponding angles would be equal. So, angle at P remains the same, 40 degrees. Then, angle at S in triangle PST would correspond to angle at Q in triangle PQR, which is 35 degrees.

But wait, angle at S in triangle PST is angle PSM, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe not. Let's think about it.

If triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR, then angle at S in triangle PST corresponds to angle at Q in triangle PQR, so angle PST corresponds to angle PQR, which is 35 degrees.

Wait, angle at S would be angle PST, which is 35 degrees. Then, in triangle PST, we have angle at P is 40 degrees, angle at S is 35 degrees, so angle at T would be 180 - 40 - 35 = 105 degrees.

So, angle at T is 105 degrees. Hmm, but angle STR is at point T, which is part of triangle STR. Wait, maybe not directly.

Wait, let me think again. If triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR, then the angles correspond.

But actually, point T is on PR, so maybe triangle PQR is being cut by ST, which is parallel to QR. So, by the Basic Proportionality Theorem, PS/SQ = PT/TR.

Given S is 0.6P, so PS is 0.6PQ, SQ is 0.4PQ. Similarly, T is 0.6PR, so PT is 0.6PR, TR is 0.4PR. So, the ratio is 3:2.

Therefore, triangle PST ~ triangle PQR with a ratio of 3:5 (since 0.6 is 3/5). So, the angles in triangle PST would correspond to those in triangle PQR.

Thus, angle at P is 40 degrees in both, angle at S corresponds to angle at Q, which is 35 degrees, so angle PST is 35 degrees. Then, angle at T in triangle PST is 180 - 40 - 35 = 105 degrees. So, angle PTS is 105 degrees.

But angle STR is at point T, which is part of triangle STR, but not necessarily the same as angle PTS in triangle PST.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the bigger picture.

Since ST is parallel to QR, and PR is a transversal, the corresponding angles at P and R would be equal. Wait, angle at P is 40 degrees, so angle at R should also be 40 degrees? But in triangle PQR, angle at Q is 35 degrees, so angles at P and R would have to add up to 145 degrees. If angle at R is 40, then angle at P would be 105, but in the problem, angle at P is given as 40. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Because PR is not necessarily a transversal. Wait, in the diagram, ST is parallel to QR. So, if we consider PR as a transversal, then angle at T and angle at R would be corresponding angles. So, angle STR (which is angle at T between ST and RT) would correspond to angle QRP (angle at R between QR and PR). But angle QRP is not given, but angle Q is 35 degrees.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since ST || QR, the alternate interior angles would be equal. So, angle between ST and PR at T would be equal to the angle between QR and PR at R.

But I don't know angle at R. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider triangle STR. If we can find two angles, we can find the third. But we only know angle at T if we can find another angle.

Wait, perhaps we can use the fact that ST || QR, so the angles formed by a transversal would be equal. If we take line PS as a transversal, then angle at S between PS and ST would correspond to angle at Q between PQ and QR.

But angle at S is angle PSM, which is part of triangle PST. Earlier, we thought angle PST is 35 degrees, which would correspond to angle PQR (angle at Q) which is 35 degrees. So that seems consistent.

Wait, so if angle PST is 35 degrees, and angle P is 40 degrees, then angle PTS is 105 degrees as we found earlier. Then, in triangle PST, angle at T is 105 degrees. But angle STR is at point T, which is in triangle STR.

Wait, maybe triangle STR is similar to something else or maybe we can find some relations.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the entire figure. Since ST is parallel to QR, the distance between them is constant. So, the triangles formed might be similar.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the concept of corresponding angles and transversals.

Wait, another idea: Since ST is parallel to QR, the angles formed by the transversal PR at points T and R are equal. So, angle STR (which is the angle between ST and RT) is equal to angle QRP (the angle between QR and PR). So, angle STR = angle QRP.

But we don't know angle QRP. However, in triangle PQR, we know angle at Q is 35 degrees, angle at P is 40 degrees, so angle at R would be 180 - 35 - 40 = 105 degrees. Therefore, angle QRP is 105 degrees. So, angle STR is 105 degrees.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct because angle STR is at point T, not at point R.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify: If ST is parallel to QR, then angle STR is equal to angle QRP because they are corresponding angles. So, if angle QRP is 105 degrees, then angle STR would also be 105 degrees.

But wait, let's make sure that's the case.

In triangle PQR, angle at R is angle QRP, which is 105 degrees. Since ST is parallel to QR, and RT is a transversal, angle STR (which is on the same side as angle QRP) should be equal to angle QRP because of the corresponding angles theorem.

So, angle STR = angle QRP = 105 degrees.

But wait, let me think again. Is angle STR on the same side as angle QRP?

In the diagram, angle STR is at point T, between S and R. If we extend PR beyond R, then angle QRP is the angle at R between Q and P. Similarly, angle STR is the angle at T between S and R. Since ST is parallel to QR, and RT is a transversal, the corresponding angles should be equal.

Therefore, angle STR = angle QRP = 105 degrees.

But in the problem, angle P is given as 40 degrees, which is at point P between S and R, so angle SPR is 40 degrees.

Wait, but in triangle PQR, angle at P is 40 degrees, angle at Q is 35 degrees, so angle at R is 105 degrees as I calculated before.

Therefore, angle QRP is 105 degrees, which is equal to angle STR because of the parallel lines.

Therefore, angle STR is 105 degrees.

But wait, that seems quite large. Let me check if that makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the corresponding angles.

Alternatively, perhaps angle STR is equal to angle P, which is 40 degrees. But no, that seems too small.

Wait, maybe I should consider triangle STR and triangle PQR.

Wait, in triangle STR, if angle STR is 105 degrees, then we can see if that's consistent with other angles.

Alternatively, let's use the fact that lines ST and QR are parallel, so the angles formed by a transversal should be equal.

So, line PS is a transversal cutting ST and QR. Therefore, angle at S between PS and ST (which is angle PST) is equal to angle at Q between PQ and QR (which is angle PQR, 35 degrees). So, angle PST = 35 degrees.

Similarly, line PT is a transversal cutting ST and QR. Therefore, angle at T between PT and ST (which is angle PTS) is equal to angle at R between PR and QR (which is angle QRP). So, angle PTS = angle QRP.

But angle QRP is 105 degrees, so angle PTS is 105 degrees.

Therefore, in triangle PST, we have angles at P, S, and T as 40 degrees, 35 degrees, and 105 degrees respectively.

But angle at T in triangle PST is 105 degrees, which is angle PTS.

But angle STR is another angle at point T, which is in triangle STR. So, points S, T, R form triangle STR.

Wait, perhaps we can find angle STR by considering triangle STR.

In triangle STR, we know angle at T is angle STR, which we want to find. If we can find the other two angles, S and R, then we can find angle STR.

But to find angles at S and R in triangle STR, we might need more information.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the straight lines. For example, at point T, the angles around T should sum up to 180 degrees.

Wait, at point T, we have angle STR (which we need to find), angle PTS (which we found as 105 degrees), and another angle between RT and something else.

Wait, no, in the diagram, point T is connected to S and R, so triangle STR is formed. So, the angles in triangle STR are at S, T, and R.

But we only know angle at T if we can relate it somehow.

Wait, perhaps the key is that in triangle PST, angle at T is 105 degrees, which is angle PTS. But in triangle STR, angle at T is angle STR. Are these angles related?

Wait, maybe not directly, unless lines PS and PR form some relationship.

Wait, another idea: Since we have triangle PST ~ triangle PQR, as we considered earlier, then the ratio of sides can be used to find some proportions.

But maybe instead, let's use the fact that in triangle PQR, angle at R is 105 degrees. Then, in triangle STR, angle at R is the same as angle at R in triangle PQR, which is 105 degrees.

Wait, that might not be correct because triangle STR is a different triangle.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Since ST is parallel to QR, and RT is a transversal, the corresponding angles at T and R are equal. So, angle STR (at T) is equal to angle QRP (at R), which is 105 degrees.

Wait, that seems to make sense.

So, by the corresponding angles theorem, angle STR = angle QRP.

Since angle QRP is 105 degrees, angle STR is also 105 degrees.

But let me just verify this because sometimes corresponding angles can be tricky.

In the diagram, ST is parallel to QR, and RT is a transversal. So, angle between RT and ST at T is equal to the angle between RT and QR at R. Therefore, angle STR = angle QRP.

Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, angle STR is 105 degrees.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that in triangle PST, angle at T is 105 degrees, which would be angle PTS. Is that the same as angle STR?

No, because angle PTS is the angle at T between PT and ST, whereas angle STR is the angle at T between ST and RT.

Wait, but RT is the same as PR beyond R, right? So, the angle between RT and ST at T is the same as the angle between PR and ST at T, which is the same as the angle between PR and QR at R because of the parallel lines.

So, angle STR is equal to angle QRP, which is 105 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of angle STR is 105 degrees.

But wait, hold on. In triangle PQR, angle at R is 105 degrees. So, angle QRP is 105 degrees. Therefore, angle STR is 105 degrees.

But in the triangle PST, angle at T is 105 degrees, which is angle PTS. But angle STR is different; it's the angle at T between S and R.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify if these angles are the same or not.

Looking at the figure, at point T, there are three lines: TS, TR, and TP? Wait, no, in the diagram, point T is connected to S and R, so lines are TS and TR.

Wait, but earlier, we considered point T connected to S and R, so triangle STR is formed. So, angle STR is angle at T between S and R.

But in triangle PST, angle at T is between P, S, and T, so that's a different angle.

Wait, but in reality, point T is on PR, so PR is a straight line from P to R, passing through T. So, at point T, we have lines TS and TR.

Since PR is a straight line, the angle between PT and TR is 180 degrees. But angle between PT and ST is angle PTS, which is 105 degrees.

But angle STR is the angle between ST and RT, which is the same as angle between ST and PR at T.

But since ST is parallel to QR, and PR is a transversal, the corresponding angle at R between QR and PR is equal to the angle at T between ST and RT.

Therefore, angle STR = angle QRP = 105 degrees.

So, even though in triangle PST, angle at T is 105 degrees, in triangle STR, angle at T is also 105 degrees because of the parallel lines.

Therefore, angle STR is 105 degrees.

Wait, but to double-check, let's consider triangle PQR.

In triangle PQR, angle at P is 40 degrees, angle at Q is 35 degrees, so angle at R is 105 degrees. Since ST is parallel to QR, and RT is a transversal, angle STR is equal to angle QRP, which is 105 degrees.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Therefore, after all that, I think angle STR is 105 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The measure of angle STR is \boxed{105} degrees.
</think>

Given the diagram where \(\overline{ST} \parallel \overline{QR}\), \(\angle P = 40^\circ\), and \(\angle Q = 35^\circ\), we need to find the measure of \(\angle STR\).

1. **Identify the parallel lines and transversals**: Since \(\overline{ST} \parallel \overline{QR}\) and \(PR\) is a transversal, the corresponding angles at \(T\) and \(R\) are equal.
2. **Determine the angle at \(R\)**: In triangle \(PQR\), we know \(\angle P = 40^\circ\) and \(\angle Q = 35^\circ\). The sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\), so \(\angle R = 180^\circ - 40^\circ - 35^\circ = 105^\circ\).
3. **Use corresponding angles**: Since \(\overline{ST} \parallel \overline{QR}\), the corresponding angle at \(T\) (which is \(\angle STR\)) is equal to the angle at \(R\) (which is \(\angle QRP\)).

Thus, the measure of \(\angle STR\) is \(\boxed{105}\) degrees.
