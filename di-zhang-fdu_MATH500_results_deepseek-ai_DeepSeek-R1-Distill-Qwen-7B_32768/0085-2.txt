Question:
Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot "mix and match".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.

Correct Answer:
There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so Tom got this Mr. Potato Head for his birthday, and he wants to figure out how many different personalities he can come up with. Let me read the question again and understand all the details.

The Mr. Potato Head comes with:
- 3 hairstyles
- 2 sets of eyebrows
- 1 pair of googly eyes
- 2 sets of ears
- 2 sets of lips
- A pair of regular shoes
- A bonus pair of clown shoes

A complete personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes, and optionally hair. Also, it's mentioned that he can be bald, so hair is optional. Additionally, it says you can't "mix and match," meaning you can't take parts from different sets; for example, you can't take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right from another.

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out how many different combinations of these features Tom can create. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's list out all the features and their options:
1. **Hairstyles**: 3 options
2. **Eyebrows**: 2 sets available, but since they can't mix and match, I think this means each set is a complete eyebrow, so you can choose one set or none. Wait, but hold on: the problem says you can't mix and match, so it might mean that each feature is a pair, and you can only choose one complete pair? Or does it mean you can't take parts from different pairs?

Wait, the note says: "You cannot 'mix and match'. For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair." So that means that for each feature that comes in pairs, you can only choose one complete pair, you can't split them. So for eyebrows, it's 2 options: either the left or the right, or none? Wait, hold on.

Wait, actually, the question says he gets a Mr. Potato Head with 2 sets of eyebrows. So each set is a complete left and right eyebrow? Or is each set a left or a right eyebrow? Hmm, actually, the problem is a bit unclear. Let me re-examine.

The problem statement says: "2 sets of eyebrows." So does that mean two separate options for eyebrows? Or that he gets two separate eyebrow sets, each of which is a complete left and right eyebrow? Hmm.

Wait, no, the problem says he can't mix and match. So for example, you can't take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from another.

Therefore, for each feature that comes in multiple sets, you can only choose one complete set, not a part of it. So for instance, if he had two sets of eyebrows, each set is a left and a right eyebrow, so you can only choose one set, not individual left or right.

Wait, but in the problem statement, he got 2 sets of eyebrows, 2 sets of ears, 2 sets of lips, and 2 pairs of shoes (a regular pair and a clown pair). So each of these is a set, and you can only choose one complete set for each.

But wait, for the shoes, it's a regular pair and a clown pair. So that's two options for shoes. Similarly, for ears, two sets, so two options, same with lips.

Wait, so actually, the term "set" might mean that each is a complete pair, so you can only choose one. So for example, instead of having two options for ears, one being left and the other being right, he actually has two complete ear sets, each providing left and right ears, so you can only choose one of the two, meaning two options for ears.

Similarly, 2 sets of eyebrows, so each set is a left and a right eyebrow, so you can choose either one set or the other, but not individual parts.

Wait, no, actually, the original problem says: "Note that you cannot "mix and match". For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair."

So that means that if you have two sets of eyebrows, each set is a left and right pair, so you can only choose one complete set, not individual left or right. So you have three options for hair, two options for eyebrows, two options for ears, two options for lips, two options for shoes.

Wait, but hold on. The problem statement says he got 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes.

So, googly eyes are singular, so that's just one option.

Wait, maybe I need to parse this better.

Each feature: 

- Hairstyles: 3 options (including bald, I assume)
- Eyebrows: 2 sets, each set is a complete left and right? So you can only choose one set, so 2 options (either set 1 or set 2)
- Ears: 2 sets, same as eyebrows, so 2 options
- Lips: 2 sets, same as before, so 2 options
- Shoes: 2 options (regular or clown)
- Eyes: 1 pair of googly eyes, so only one option

So, in that case, the number of different personalities would be the product of the number of options for each feature.

But wait, including baldness for hair. So if it's optional, how is that accounted for?

Original problem says: "Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald."

So, "optional hair" means that instead of having 3 hairstyles, one of them is bald, so 3 hairstyles include the bald option.

Wait, so 3 hairstyles: 2 regular and 1 bald? Or is it that you can choose any of the 3, including bald?

No, wait, the way it's phrased: "3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes."

So, each of these is a separate category with their own number of options.

So, for hairstyles, it's 3 options, including bald. So that's 3.

Eyebrows: 2 options (since it's 2 sets, and you can only choose one set, or none? Wait, no, the note says you cannot mix and match, but it doesn't say you can't choose none.

Wait, hold on. Let's reread the note: "Note that you cannot 'mix and match'. For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair."

So, that means that for each feature in sets, you can only choose one complete set, not individual parts. So for example, for eyebrows, since you have 2 sets, each set is a complete pair, so you can choose either set 1, set 2, or none? Or does it mean you have to choose one set, but you can't mix and match the parts?

Wait, the note says you can't take the left from one and right from another, so it's about not mixing parts. So for each set, you can only choose a complete set, not individual parts.

Therefore, for each feature that has multiple sets, you can choose one of the sets. So for example, for eyebrows, you can choose either set 1 or set 2, but you can't choose both or none. Wait, actually, no, because the term "optional" is mentioned for hair.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify:

The problem says: "a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair," so all these are required except for hair, which is optional.

So, if hair is optional, that means that we have to consider the number of options for the other features multiplied by the number of options for hair, which includes bald.

Therefore, the number of options per feature:

- Eyebrows: 2 sets, so you can choose either set 1 or set 2. So 2 options.
- Ears: 2 sets, so 2 options.
- Lips: 2 sets, so 2 options.
- Shoes: 2 options (regular or clown)
- Eyes: 1 pair, so only 1 option.
- Hair: 3 options: 2 regular hairstyles and 1 bald.

Therefore, to calculate the total number of different personalities, we can multiply the number of options for each feature.

So, total = Hairstyles * Eyebrows * Ears * Lips * Shoes * Eyes

Plugging in the numbers:

Total = 3 (hair) * 2 (eyebrows) * 2 (ears) * 2 (lips) * 2 (shoes) * 1 (eyes)

Calculating that:

3 * 2 = 6

6 * 2 = 12

12 * 2 = 24

24 * 2 = 48

48 * 1 = 48

So, 48 different personalities.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I considered everything correctly.

So, 3 hairstyles, each being a different look, including bald.

2 sets of eyebrows, so he can choose either set 1 or set 2. So 2 options.

2 sets of ears, same as above.

2 sets of lips, same.

Shoes: 2 options.

Eyes: 1 pair, so only 1 option.

Therefore, each choice is independent, so it's multiplicative.

So, 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 48.

Yes, that seems correct.

But just to double-check, let's think about each choice:

1. **Hair**: 3 options (assuming 2 hairstyles plus bald)
2. **Eyebrows**: 2 options (set 1 or set 2)
3. **Ears**: 2 options (set 1 or set 2)
4. **Lips**: 2 options (set 1 or set 2)
5. **Shoes**: 2 options (regular or clown)
6. **Eyes**: 1 option (googly eyes)

So, 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 48.

Hmm, that seems correct.

But wait, hold on a second. The initial description says:

It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes.

So, the term "bonus pair" for shoes. So, that's 1 regular and 1 clown, so 2 options for shoes.

So, that is correct.

So, 3 for hair, 2 for eyebrows, 2 for ears, 2 for lips, 2 for shoes, and 1 for eyes.

Multiplying them together: 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 48.

Hence, 48 different personalities.

Wait, but hold on. What about the possibility of not using any hair? But since the hair is optional, meaning that it can be bald, which is an option. So, 3 includes bald, so that is already considered.

Therefore, the calculation is correct.

But just to make sure, let me think of a simpler case: suppose he had 1 hairstyle (including bald), 1 set of eyebrows, 1 set of ears, 1 set of lips, 1 pair of shoes, and 1 pair of googly eyes. Then, the number of personalities would be 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.

But in our case, it's more.

Wait, another way to think: if we have 3 choices for hair, and for each hair choice, we have 2 choices for eyebrows, 2 for ears, 2 for lips, and 2 for shoes. So, it's 3 * (2^4) = 3 * 16 = 48.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, if it was 3 choices for hair, and 2 choices for each of the other four features, then it's 3 * 2^4 = 48.

So, that seems consistent.

Therefore, I think 48 is the correct number of different personalities Tom can come up with.

**Final Answer**
The number of different wacky personalities Tom can come up with is \boxed{48}.
</think>

Tom got a Mr. Potato Head with the following features:
- 3 hairstyles (including bald)
- 2 sets of eyebrows
- 1 pair of googly eyes
- 2 sets of ears
- 2 sets of lips
- 2 pairs of shoes (regular and clown)

Each feature can be chosen independently, except for the hair, which is optional. The number of options for each feature is:
- Hair: 3 options (including bald)
- Eyebrows: 2 options
- Ears: 2 options
- Lips: 2 options
- Shoes: 2 options
- Eyes: 1 option

The total number of different personalities is calculated by multiplying the number of options for each feature:

\[
3 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 3 \times 2^4 = 3 \times 16 = 48
\]

Thus, the number of different wacky personalities Tom can come up with is \boxed{48}.
