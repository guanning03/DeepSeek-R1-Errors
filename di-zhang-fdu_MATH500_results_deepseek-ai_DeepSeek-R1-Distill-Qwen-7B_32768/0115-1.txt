Observe that $BD=\sqrt{BE^2-DE^2}=\sqrt{5^2-3^2}=4$ units.  By the similarity of triangles $BCJ$ and $BDE$, we have  \[
\frac{CJ}{BC}=\frac{DE}{BD},
\] which after substituting becomes \[
\frac{CJ}{4-3}=\frac{3}{4}.
\] We solve to find $CJ=\frac{3}{4}$, which implies that $GJ=3-\frac{3}{4}=\frac{9}{4}$.  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $GJE$, we find $EJ=\sqrt{3^2+\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)^2}=\frac{15}{4}$.  Define $K$ to be the foot of the perpendicular from $G$ to side $EJ$.  By the similarity of triangles $GKJ$ and $EGJ$, we have  \[
\frac{GK}{GJ}=\frac{EG}{EJ} \implies
\frac{GK}{\frac{9}{4}}=\frac{3}{\frac{15}{4}},
\] which we solve to find $GK=\frac{9}{5}$.  Since $GKBH$ is a rectangle, $BH=GK=\frac{9}{5}=\boxed{1\frac{4}{5}}$ units.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. It involves two shapes: quadrilateral CDEG is a square with CD equal to 3 units, and quadrilateral BEFH is a rectangle with BE equal to 5 units. I need to find the length of BH and express it as a mixed number. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this based on the Asymptote figure provided.

First, let me note down the given information:

1. CDEG is a square with CD = 3. So, all sides of the square are 3 units long. That means CE, DE, and EG are also 3 units each.
2. BEFH is a rectangle with BE = 5. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so BF should also be 5 units. The other sides, EF and BH, will be equal as well, but I don't know their lengths yet.

Looking at the Asymptote code, it defines points A, B, C, D, Ep (which is point E), G, F, and H. It also mentions drawing lines between these points in a specific order. From the labels, I can try to figure out the positions of these points.

Starting from the origin (0,0) as point A. Then, point B is at (3,0), so AB is 3 units. Point C is at (6,0), so BC is also 3 units. Point D is at (9,0), making CD another 3 units. So, the points A, B, C, D are colinear along the x-axis, each 3 units apart.

Now, point Ep is at (9,3), which is point E. So, E is 3 units above D. Since CDEG is a square, point G must be directly above C. Wait, actually, if CDEG is a square with CD = 3, then CE should also be 3 units, right? So, E is 3 units above D, which is at (9,0), so E is at (9,3). Similarly, G should be 3 units above C, which is at (6,0), so G is at (6,3). So, quadrilateral CDEG has points C(6,0), D(9,0), E(9,3), G(6,3), and back to C. Yep, that makes a square.

Now, quadrilateral BEFH is a rectangle. Point B is at (3,0), and E is at (9,3). So, BE is one side of the rectangle. Since BE is 5 units, which is given, and BEFH is a rectangle, the opposite side FH should also be 5 units. The other sides, BF and EH, should be equal in length. So, I need to find the length of BH.

Looking at the Asymptote code, they define F0 as the bisector point of B and 2*Ep - B, which is probably the midpoint or something. Hmm, not sure about that. Then H0 is the bisector point of Ep and 2*B - Ep, which might be another midpoint or a different bisector. Then H is the extension of B to H0 and A to G. Similarly, F is the extension of Ep to F0 and A to G.

This is a bit confusing without seeing the figure, but maybe I can reconstruct the coordinates.

Let me list the coordinates:

- A: (0,0)
- B: (3,0)
- C: (6,0)
- D: (9,0)
- E: (9,3)
- G: (6,3)

Now, quadrilateral BEFH is a rectangle. So, points B(3,0), E(9,3), F, and H must form a rectangle. Since BE is one diagonal of the rectangle, the other diagonal would be FH. In a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other, so their midpoints should coincide.

Let me find the midpoint of BE. The midpoint M of BE can be calculated as:

M_x = (3 + 9)/2 = 12/2 = 6

M_y = (0 + 3)/2 = 3/2 = 1.5

So, midpoint M is at (6, 1.5). Since this is also the midpoint of FH, the coordinates of F and H should be symmetric with respect to this midpoint.

But I don't know the coordinates of F and H yet. However, since BEFH is a rectangle, sides BF and EH should be equal and perpendicular to sides BE and FH.

Wait, maybe it's better to find the coordinates of F and H. Let me see.

Given that BE is from (3,0) to (9,3), so the vector BE is (6,3). The length of BE is 5 units, as given. Wait, actually, hold on. The length of BE can be calculated as sqrt[(9 - 3)^2 + (3 - 0)^2] = sqrt[36 + 9] = sqrt[45] = 3*sqrt(5). Hmm, but the problem states that BE = 5. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. The problem says quadrilateral BEFH is a rectangle with BE = 5. So, maybe BE is not the diagonal but a side?

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it draws H--B--Ep--F--A--D--Ep--G--C. So, the rectangle is drawn as B connected to E, E connected to F, F connected to H, and H connected back to B. So, BE is one side, EF is another, FH is the opposite side, and HB is the fourth side. So, BE is a side of the rectangle, not a diagonal.

Therefore, BE is a side of length 5. So, in the rectangle BEFH, BE is one side of length 5, and BF is the adjacent side, which we don't know yet.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, point Ep is (9,3), which is E, and point B is (3,0). So, the distance from B to E is sqrt[(9-3)^2 + (3-0)^2] = sqrt[36 + 9] = sqrt[45] = 3*sqrt(5), which is approximately 6.708, not 5. Hmm, but the problem states BE = 5. So, perhaps the figure is not drawn to scale, or maybe my interpretation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps quadrilateral BEFH is a rectangle, but BE is a side, not the diagonal. But the coordinates of B and E are fixed as (3,0) and (9,3). So, the distance between B and E is sqrt(45), not 5. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I got the labels wrong. Looking back at the Asymptote code: label("$E$",Ep,E); label("$F$",F,N); label("$G$",G,NW); label("$H$",H,NW); So, H is connected to A and G. A is at (0,0), G is at (6,3). So, AG is a line from (0,0) to (6,3). Similarly, H is connected to B and E and F.

Wait, perhaps the figure is constructed in such a way that BE is not a straight line? No, that can't be. Maybe I need to consider the Asymptote code more carefully.

Looking at the code:

draw(H--B--Ep--F--A--D--Ep--G--C);

So, H is connected to B, then B to Ep (which is E), then E to F, then F to A, then A to D, then D to Ep (E), then E to G, then G to C.

So, the figure drawn is a polygon: H-B-E-F-A-D-E-G-C.

Wait, so it's a polygon that goes through H, B, E, F, A, D, E, G, C. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated.

Also, in the code:

pair F0=bisectorpoint(B,2*Ep-B), H0=bisectorpoint(Ep,2*B-Ep);
pair H=extension(B,H0,A,G);
pair F=extension(Ep,F0,A,G);

Hmm, so F0 is the bisector point of B and 2*Ep - B. Let me compute that.

First, 2*Ep - B: Ep is (9,3), so 2*Ep is (18,6). Then 2*Ep - B is (18 - 3, 6 - 0) = (15,6). So, bisectorpoint(B, 2*Ep - B) would be the midpoint between B(3,0) and (15,6). The midpoint is ((3 + 15)/2, (0 + 6)/2) = (18/2, 6/2) = (9,3). Wait, that's point Ep itself. So, F0 is Ep.

Similarly, H0 is the bisectorpoint of Ep and 2*B - Ep. Let's compute 2*B - Ep: 2*B is (6,0), so 2*B - Ep is (6 - 9, 0 - 3) = (-3, -3). Then, bisectorpoint(Ep, 2*B - Ep) is the midpoint between Ep(9,3) and (-3,-3). Midpoint is ((9 + (-3))/2, (3 + (-3))/2) = (6/2, 0/2) = (3,0). That's point B.

So, H0 is point B. So, H is the extension of B to H0, which is just point B itself? No, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the bisectorpoint function. Maybe it's not the midpoint but another kind of bisector?

Wait, in Asymptote, bisectorpoint is a function that finds the bisector point of two points with respect to a given angle. Hmm, perhaps it's not just the midpoint. I might need to double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to construct lines BH and AF such that they intersect at some point?

Wait, in the code, H is defined as the extension of B to H0 and A to G. So, H is where the line BH0 meets the line AG. Similarly, F is where the line EpF0 meets AG.

So, maybe I need to find equations of the lines and compute their intersection points.

Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, let me note all the known points with their coordinates:

- A: (0,0)
- B: (3,0)
- C: (6,0)
- D: (9,0)
- E: (9,3)
- G: (6,3)

Now, I need to find points F and H such that BEFH is a rectangle.

Since BE is a side of the rectangle, from B(3,0) to E(9,3). The length of BE is sqrt[(9-3)^2 + (3-0)^2] = sqrt(36 + 9) = sqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5), which is approximately 6.708, but the problem states BE = 5. Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe the figure is not to scale, or perhaps I need to adjust.

Wait, maybe the problem says BE = 5, but in reality, based on coordinates, BE is 3*sqrt(5). Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, hold on. In the Asymptote code, the distance between B(3,0) and E(9,3) is indeed sqrt(45), which is not 5. So, perhaps the figure is scaled or the problem statement is different. Maybe the coordinates are not to scale, and I should treat it as a coordinate system where BE is 5 units.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I can assign coordinates such that BE is 5 units, and then find BH accordingly.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe I can model this with coordinate geometry.

Let me set coordinate system with point A at (0,0), so:

- A: (0,0)
- B: (3,0)
- C: (6,0)
- D: (9,0)
- E: (9,3)
- G: (6,3)

So, with these coordinates, BE is from (3,0) to (9,3), which is length 3√5 as above.

But the problem says BE = 5. So, perhaps the figure is scaled? Maybe each unit in the coordinate system corresponds to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can adjust the coordinates so that BE is 5. Let's see.

Let me assume that the distance from B(3,0) to E(x,y) is 5. But in the figure, E is at (9,3). So, perhaps I can adjust the coordinate system.

Wait, maybe I should not rely on coordinates but instead try to use geometry.

Since CDEG is a square with CD = 3, so all sides are 3. Then, BEFH is a rectangle with BE = 5. So, in rectangle BEFH, BE is one side, BF is another side. So, BF is perpendicular to BE, and length of BF is equal to the other side of the rectangle.

But how does this relate to the square CDEG? Points B, E, F, H are connected, but how are they positioned relative to the square?

Wait, looking back at the Asymptote code, after drawing the square CDEG, it draws BE connected to F, which is connected to A, which is connected to D, E, G, C. So, the figure is a combination of the square and the rectangle.

Wait, maybe I can think of lines AG and BH intersecting at some point. In the code, H is the extension of B to H0 and A to G. Similarly, F is the extension of Ep to F0 and A to G.

So, lines AG and BH intersect at point H. Similarly, lines EpF0 and AG intersect at point F.

So, maybe I can find the equations of lines AG and BH, find their intersection point H, and then compute the distance from B to H.

That sounds like a plan.

First, let's find the equation of line AG. Point A is (0,0), and point G is (6,3). So, the slope of AG is (3 - 0)/(6 - 0) = 3/6 = 1/2. So, the equation is y = (1/2)x.

Next, I need the equation of line BH. But I don't know point H yet. However, point H is the intersection of line BH and line AG. Since H is defined as the extension of B to H0, which is the bisectorpoint of B and 2*Ep - B. Hmm, maybe I need to figure out the direction of BH.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, H0 is defined as bisectorpoint(Ep, 2*B - Ep). Let's compute that.

Ep is (9,3), so 2*B - Ep is 2*(3,0) - (9,3) = (6,0) - (9,3) = (-3,-3). So, bisectorpoint(Ep, (-3,-3)) is the midpoint between (9,3) and (-3,-3). The midpoint is ((9 + (-3))/2, (3 + (-3))/2) = (6/2, 0/2) = (3,0). So, H0 is (3,0), which is point B.

So, H is the extension of B through H0, which is just the point B itself. That can't be right, because then BH would be zero, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misapplying the bisectorpoint function.

Wait, perhaps bisectorpoint is not the midpoint but something else. Maybe it's the direction vector?

Wait, in Asymptote, the bisectorpoint function might be used to find a point that bisects the angle between two points with respect to a given point. Hmm, that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the code is using a different approach to define the lines BH and AF.

Wait, perhaps I should instead focus on the fact that BE is a side of the rectangle, and BF is another side, so direction vectors can help.

Since BE is from B(3,0) to E(9,3). The vector BE is (6,3). So, the direction vector is (6,3) or simplified to (2,1). Since BE is a side of the rectangle, BF must be perpendicular to BE because it's a rectangle.

Wait, no. In a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, BE and BF should be perpendicular. So, the vector BF should be perpendicular to vector BE.

Vector BE is (6,3). A perpendicular vector would have a slope that is the negative reciprocal. The slope of BE is 3/6 = 1/2, so the slope of BF should be -2.

So, from point B(3,0), moving along a line with slope -2 will give us the line BF.

Let me write the equation of BF. It passes through (3,0) with slope -2. So, the equation is y - 0 = -2(x - 3), which simplifies to y = -2x + 6.

Now, since BEFH is a rectangle, the length of BF can be determined if we know the length of BE. But wait, BE is given as 5, but in actual coordinates, BE is 3√5. Hmm, so perhaps we need to scale things.

Wait, perhaps the figure is not drawn to scale, and we have to work purely algebraically.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the points.

Let me denote the coordinates:

- A: (0,0)
- B: (3,0)
- C: (6,0)
- D: (9,0)
- E: (9,3)
- G: (6,3)

We need to find points F and H such that BEFH is a rectangle.

Since BE is from (3,0) to (9,3), and the rectangle has sides BE and BF, then BF should be perpendicular to BE and of length such that the figure becomes a rectangle.

Wait, but without knowing the length of BF, it's hard to proceed. Wait, actually, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees. So, if BE is one side, then FH must be equal and parallel to BE, and BF and EH must be equal and parallel.

But given that, perhaps I can find the coordinates of F and H.

Given that, let me assume that F is somewhere on the line from E(9,3) in the direction perpendicular to BE.

Wait, since BE has a slope of 1/2, the perpendicular direction would have a slope of -2.

So, from point E(9,3), moving along the direction perpendicular to BE, we can reach point F.

But we don't know how far, as the length of BF is equal to the length of EH.

Wait, maybe it's better to use vectors.

Vector BE is (6,3). So, its perpendicular vector would be (-3,6) or (3,-6). Since BF is perpendicular to BE, the vector BF should be a scalar multiple of ( -3,6 ) or (3,-6).

But since BE is a side, and BF is another side, their lengths are not necessarily the same. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular but can have different lengths.

Wait, but in our case, BE is given as 5 units, so the length of BE is 5, but vector BE is (6,3), which has a magnitude sqrt(6^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5). So, perhaps the figure is scaled.

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that BE is 5 units, so the coordinates are scaled such that the distance from B(3,0) to E(9,3) is 5. So, we can compute the scaling factor.

The actual distance is 3*sqrt(5), so scaling factor k would satisfy 3*sqrt(5)*k = 5 => k = 5/(3*sqrt(5)) = sqrt(5)/3.

So, if we scale the coordinates by k = sqrt(5)/3, then the distance BE becomes 5.

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can assign coordinates in such a way that BE is 5 units.

Wait, maybe I should take a different approach.

Let me consider the rectangle BEFH. Let's denote the coordinates:

- B: (3,0)
- E: (9,3)
- F: (x,y)
- H: (p,q)

Since it's a rectangle, the vectors BE and BF should satisfy the condition that they are perpendicular.

Vector BE is (6,3). Vector BF is (x - 3, y - 0) = (x - 3, y).

For BE and BF to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.

So,

BE • BF = 6*(x - 3) + 3*y = 0

So,

6x - 18 + 3y = 0

Simplify:

6x + 3y = 18

Divide by 3:

2x + y = 6. (Equation 1)

Also, since BEFH is a rectangle, the length of BF should be equal to the length of EH.

Vector EH is (p - 9, q - 3).

Vector BF is (x - 3, y).

So, |BF| = |EH|

Compute |BF|:

sqrt[(x - 3)^2 + y^2]

Compute |EH|:

sqrt[(p - 9)^2 + (q - 3)^2]

So,

sqrt[(x - 3)^2 + y^2] = sqrt[(p - 9)^2 + (q - 3)^2]

But without more information, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, since BEFH is a rectangle, the coordinates of F and H can be determined based on the properties of rectangles.

In a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal and the diagonals bisect each other.

But perhaps another approach is to note that lines BF and EH are equal and parallel, and lines BE and FH are equal and parallel.

Wait, but I think it's getting too abstract. Maybe I can find point H as the intersection of AG and BH.

In the Asymptote code, point H is the extension of B to H0 (which is point B itself, but that doesn't make sense) and A to G.

Wait, perhaps H is the intersection of AG and BH, where BH is constructed as the line from B with some slope.

Earlier, I tried to compute the slope of BF as -2 because it's perpendicular to BE. But in reality, since BE is a side of the rectangle, BF should be equal in length to the height of the rectangle.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the coordinates of F and H using the properties of the rectangle.

Let me denote:

- Vector BE = (6,3)
- Vector BF = (a,b)

Since BE and BF are perpendicular, 6a + 3b = 0 => 2a + b = 0 => b = -2a.

Also, in a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal, so vector BF = vector EH, and vector BE = vector FH.

But point H is the intersection of line AG and line BH.

Since line AG is from A(0,0) to G(6,3), which has the equation y = (1/2)x.

So, parametric equations for AG: x = 6t, y = 3t, where t is a parameter.

Similarly, line BH is from B(3,0) to some point H(p, q). Since H lies on AG, we can write p = 6t, q = 3t for some t.

But also, BH must be such that BEFH is a rectangle.

Wait, maybe I can express vector BH in terms of t.

Vector BH is (p - 3, q - 0) = (6t - 3, 3t).

Vector BE is (6,3). In a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular, so vector BH must be perpendicular to vector BE.

So, their dot product should be zero:

(6t - 3)*6 + (3t)*3 = 0

Compute:

6*(6t - 3) + 3*(3t) = 0
36t - 18 + 9t = 0
45t - 18 = 0
45t = 18
t = 18/45 = 2/5

So, t = 2/5. Therefore, point H is at (6*(2/5), 3*(2/5)) = (12/5, 6/5).

Thus, point H is at (12/5, 6/5). Now, we need to find BH.

Point B is at (3,0). So, the distance between B(3,0) and H(12/5, 6/5).

Compute the distance:

BH = sqrt[(12/5 - 3)^2 + (6/5 - 0)^2]
= sqrt[(12/5 - 15/5)^2 + (6/5)^2]
= sqrt[(-3/5)^2 + (6/5)^2]
= sqrt[(9/25) + (36/25)]
= sqrt[45/25]
= sqrt[9/5]
= 3/sqrt(5)
= (3*sqrt(5))/5

But the problem asks for BH as a mixed number. However, 3*sqrt(5)/5 is an irrational number, approximately 1.3416. But the problem wants it as a mixed number, which suggests a fractional number, not a decimal or irrational. Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe I got the direction of BH wrong. Earlier, I assumed that BF is perpendicular to BE, but in reality, in the rectangle, it's the sides that are perpendicular, but perhaps the scaling is different.

Wait, let me go back. If BE is supposed to be 5 units, but in our coordinate system, it's 3*sqrt(5). So, perhaps I need to scale the coordinates accordingly.

Let me define a scaling factor k such that 3*sqrt(5)*k = 5 => k = 5/(3*sqrt(5)) = sqrt(5)/3.

So, scaling down the coordinates by k = sqrt(5)/3, the coordinates become:

- A: (0,0)
- B: (3*(sqrt(5)/3), 0) = (sqrt(5), 0)
- C: (6*(sqrt(5)/3), 0) = (2*sqrt(5), 0)
- D: (9*(sqrt(5)/3), 0) = (3*sqrt(5), 0)
- E: (9*(sqrt(5)/3), 3*(sqrt(5)/3)) = (3*sqrt(5), sqrt(5))
- G: (6*(sqrt(5)/3), 3*(sqrt(5)/3)) = (2*sqrt(5), sqrt(5))

So, in the scaled coordinate system, point H is at (12/5, 6/5). Let me scale this down by k = sqrt(5)/3:

Wait, no, actually, point H is at (12/5, 6/5) in the original coordinate system. To scale it, we multiply each coordinate by k = sqrt(5)/3.

Wait, no, actually, if the entire figure is scaled by k, then all coordinates are multiplied by k. But in our case, we defined k such that BE becomes 5. So, BE in original coordinates is 3*sqrt(5), so to make it 5, we scale by k = 5/(3*sqrt(5)).

But point H is (12/5, 6/5). So, scaling it by k:

Hx_scaled = (12/5) * (sqrt(5)/3) = (12/5)*(sqrt(5)/3) = (4/5)*sqrt(5)
Hy_scaled = (6/5) * (sqrt(5)/3) = (2/5)*sqrt(5)

Therefore, point H in the scaled system is at ((4/5)*sqrt(5), (2/5)*sqrt(5)).

Then, point B in scaled coordinates is (sqrt(5), 0).

So, the distance BH is sqrt[( (4/5)sqrt(5) - sqrt(5) )^2 + ( (2/5)sqrt(5) - 0 )^2 ]

Compute:

First, simplify the x-component:

(4/5 sqrt(5) - sqrt(5)) = (4/5 sqrt(5) - 5/5 sqrt(5)) = (-1/5 sqrt(5))

So, x-component squared: (-1/5 sqrt(5))^2 = (1/25)*5 = 1/5

y-component:

(2/5 sqrt(5))^2 = (4/25)*5 = 4/5

So, total distance squared: 1/5 + 4/5 = 5/5 = 1

Therefore, BH = sqrt(1) = 1

Wait, that's interesting. So, BH is 1 unit in the scaled coordinate system. But in the original coordinate system, that would correspond to 1 * k, but wait no, BH is 1 in the scaled system, which is already scaled such that BE is 5.

Wait, no, actually, in the scaled system, BH is 1. But in reality, we need to express BH in units where BE is 5. So, if BH is 1 in the scaled system where BE is 5, then BH is 1 unit, but that seems too simplistic.

Wait, maybe I confused something.

Wait, scaling the entire figure such that BE becomes 5: in this case, BH was computed as 3*sqrt(5)/5 in the original coordinate system, which is approximately 1.3416. But if we scale the coordinates such that BE is 5, then the scaling factor is k = 5 / (3*sqrt(5)) = sqrt(5)/3, so distances scale by sqrt(5)/3. Therefore, BH, which was 3*sqrt(5)/5, scales as (3*sqrt(5)/5) * (sqrt(5)/3) = (3*sqrt(5)/5)*(sqrt(5)/3) = (5/5) = 1.

Therefore, in the scaled coordinate system, BH is 1 unit. But the problem doesn't specify units, so perhaps the answer is 1. But the problem says "how many units is BH?" So, maybe it's 1 unit. But 1 is already a whole number, so in mixed number, it's 1.

But that seems too straightforward, given that the problem is presented with a diagram and asks for a mixed number. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption in scaling. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the coordinates without scaling.

Earlier, in the unscaled coordinate system, I found that point H is at (12/5, 6/5). So, the distance from B(3,0) to H(12/5, 6/5) is sqrt[(12/5 - 15/5)^2 + (6/5 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(-3/5)^2 + (6/5)^2] = sqrt[9/25 + 36/25] = sqrt[45/25] = 3*sqrt(5)/5.

So, BH is 3*sqrt(5)/5 units. But the problem is given in a context where BE is 5 units, but in reality, in my coordinate system, BE is 3*sqrt(5). So, unless the figure is scaled, 3*sqrt(5)/5 is just a number, not necessarily a whole number.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different scaling where BE is 5, so all other lengths are scaled accordingly. So, in that case, since BH is 3*sqrt(5)/5, which is approximately 1.3416, but as a mixed number, it's 1 2/5 or something? Wait, 3*sqrt(5)/5 is approximately 1.3416, which is 1 + 0.3416, which is roughly 1 and 1/3, but not exactly.

Wait, maybe I can express 3*sqrt(5)/5 as a mixed number. But since sqrt(5) is irrational, it can't be expressed as a mixed number with integer parts. So, perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should not have scaled the figure but instead worked with the given coordinates.

Wait, in the original coordinate system, BH is 3*sqrt(5)/5. However, the problem says BE is 5, but in the original coordinate system, BE is 3*sqrt(5). So, maybe I need to adjust the coordinate system so that BE is 5.

Wait, to do that, let's consider that BE is from (3,0) to (9,3), which has a length of 3*sqrt(5). So, if we scale the coordinate system such that 3*sqrt(5) units correspond to 5 units in the problem's scale.

Therefore, the scaling factor is k = 5 / (3*sqrt(5)) = sqrt(5)/3, as before.

Therefore, distances in the problem's scale are k times the distances in the original coordinate system.

So, BH in the original coordinate system is 3*sqrt(5)/5. Therefore, in the problem's scale, it's (3*sqrt(5)/5) * (sqrt(5)/3) = (3*sqrt(5)/5)*(sqrt(5)/3) = (5/5) = 1 unit.

So, BH is 1 unit in the problem's scale. Therefore, the answer is 1.

But that seems too straightforward, and the problem asks for a mixed number, which is usually a number like 1 1/2, etc., not just an integer. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the figure is not drawn to scale, and I need to compute BH using other geometric properties, such as similar triangles or coordinate geometry without scaling.

Wait, let me try again without scaling.

In the original coordinate system:

- A(0,0), B(3,0), C(6,0), D(9,0), E(9,3), G(6,3)

We found point H is at (12/5, 6/5). So, BH is sqrt[(12/5 - 15/5)^2 + (6/5 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(-3/5)^2 + (6/5)^2] = sqrt[9/25 + 36/25] = sqrt[45/25] = 3*sqrt(5)/5.

But in the problem statement, BE is given as 5. So, in reality, if BE is 5, the coordinate system is scaled such that 3*sqrt(5) corresponds to 5.

Therefore, in the problem's scale, BH is (3*sqrt(5)/5) / (3*sqrt(5)) * 5 = 1. So, again, BH is 1 unit.

Therefore, the answer is 1.

But since the problem asks for a mixed number, it's likely that they expect an integer. So, 1 is a whole number, but in mixed number terms, it's just 1.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, in the unscaled coordinate system, BH is 3*sqrt(5)/5, which is approximately 1.3416. So, as a mixed number, it's 1 and approximately 0.3416, but since it's irrational, we can't express it exactly as a mixed number with integer parts.

Therefore, perhaps the figure is scaled such that 3*sqrt(5)/5 is 5, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem says quadrilateral BEFH is a rectangle with BE = 5. So, perhaps in this figure, BE is 5, and we have to find BH. So, maybe in this specific figure, we can use the properties of the rectangle and the given square to find BH.

Given that CDEG is a square with CD = 3, so all sides are 3. BE is a side of the rectangle, length 5. So, the rectangle BEFH has sides of length 5 and something. So, if I can find the other side, maybe I can find BH.

Wait, but BH is a diagonal? Or is it a side?

Wait, in the figure, BH is connected from B to H, which is a point connected to G via AG. So, H is the intersection of AG and BH.

So, perhaps BH is the diagonal from B to H.

But in the rectangle BEFH, the sides are BE and BF. So, BH is not a side but a diagonal.

Wait, if BEFH is a rectangle, then the diagonals are equal. So, BH should be equal to the other diagonal, which is from E to F.

But we don't know point F yet.

Wait, perhaps I can find the coordinates of F in the original coordinate system.

Earlier, we found that point H is at (12/5, 6/5). So, since H is the intersection of AG and BH, and AG is from A(0,0) to G(6,3), which is y = (1/2)x.

And BH is the line from B(3,0) to H(12/5, 6/5). So, the equation of BH is from (3,0) to (12/5, 6/5).

Compute the slope:

(6/5 - 0)/(12/5 - 3) = (6/5)/(12/5 - 15/5) = (6/5)/(-3/5) = -2.

So, the line BH has a slope of -2, passes through (3,0). So, equation is y = -2x + 6.

Wait, we know point H is on AG: y = (1/2)x, and on BH: y = -2x + 6.

So, solving these two equations:

(1/2)x = -2x + 6

Multiply both sides by 2:

x = -4x + 12

Bring 4x to left:

5x = 12 => x = 12/5

Then, y = (1/2)(12/5) = 6/5

So, point H is indeed at (12/5, 6/5). So, that's correct.

Therefore, BH is the distance from (3,0) to (12/5, 6/5). As computed earlier, that's 3*sqrt(5)/5. But since in the problem, BE is given as 5, which in reality is 3*sqrt(5), so the scaling factor is 5/(3*sqrt(5)) = sqrt(5)/3.

Therefore, BH in problem's scale is (3*sqrt(5)/5) * (sqrt(5)/3) = 1.

So, BH is 1 unit.

But again, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I should instead consider the figure without scaling.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use vectors or coordinate geometry in the original system.

Wait, here's another approach. Since quadrilateral CDEG is a square, so CG is 3 units, and G is at (6,3). So, AG is from (0,0) to (6,3). So, parametric equations: x = 6t, y = 3t.

Similarly, BH is from (3,0) to (12/5, 6/5). So, parametric equations: x = 3 + (12/5 - 3)s = 3 - (3/5)s, y = 0 + (6/5)s, where s ranges from 0 to 1.

To find the intersection point H, set x and y equal:

6t = 3 - (3/5)s

3t = (6/5)s

From the second equation: 3t = (6/5)s => s = (3t)*(5/6) = (5/2)t

Plug into first equation:

6t = 3 - (3/5)*(5/2)t => 6t = 3 - (3/2)t

Bring (3/2)t to left:

6t + (3/2)t = 3

Convert to common denominator:

(12/2)t + (3/2)t = 3 => (15/2)t = 3 => t = (3)*(2/15) = 6/15 = 2/5

So, t = 2/5, which gives point H at (12/5, 6/5), same as before.

Therefore, BH is the distance from B(3,0) to H(12/5, 6/5), which is sqrt[(3 - 12/5)^2 + (0 - 6/5)^2] = sqrt[(3/5)^2 + (6/5)^2] = sqrt[9/25 + 36/25] = sqrt[45/25] = 3*sqrt(5)/5.

But in the problem, BE is given as 5, while in actual coordinates, BE is 3*sqrt(5). Therefore, the scaling factor is k = 5 / (3*sqrt(5)) = sqrt(5)/3.

Thus, all distances are scaled by k. So, BH is (3*sqrt(5)/5) * k = (3*sqrt(5)/5)*(sqrt(5)/3) = (5/5) = 1.

Therefore, BH is 1 unit in the scaled system, which is the answer.

But wait, the problem didn't specify units; it just asked how many units is BH. So, 1 unit is the answer.

But the problem says "how many units is BH?" and it's presented with a diagram. Maybe it's expecting a different approach, but I can't see another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different configuration, but I can't see it without the figure.

Wait, let me think about it differently. Maybe using similar triangles.

In the figure, AG is a diagonal from A to G, and BH intersects AG at H.

So, triangles ABH and AGH might be similar.

Wait, let's compute the ratios.

In the original coordinate system:

- Point A: (0,0)
- Point G: (6,3)
- Point H: (12/5, 6/5)
- Point B: (3,0)

So, vector AG is (6,3), vector BH is (12/5 - 3, 6/5 - 0) = (-3/5, 6/5)

So, BH is (-3/5, 6/5). Vector AG is (6,3). So, BH is (-1/10)*AG.

Wait, (-3/5, 6/5) = (-1/10)*(6, -12). Wait, no, 6*(-1/10) = -3/5, and 3*(-1/10) = -3/10, which is not 6/5. So, not a scalar multiple.

Wait, perhaps another way. The line AG has parametric equations x = 6t, y = 3t. The line BH has parametric equations x = 3 - (3/5)s, y = 0 + (6/5)s.

We found t = 2/5, s = (5/2)t = (5/2)*(2/5) = 1.

So, at t=2/5, point H is on AG, which is (12/5, 6/5). So, the ratio of AH to HG is t : (1 - t) = 2/5 : 3/5 = 2:3.

So, point H divides AG in the ratio AH:HG = 2:3.

So, using the section formula, coordinates of H are [(3*6 + 2*0)/5, (3*3 + 2*0)/5] = (18/5, 9/5). Wait, but that contradicts our earlier result.

Wait, no, section formula is different. If H divides AG in ratio m:n from A to G, then coordinates are ( (n*Ax + m*Gx)/(m + n), (n*Ay + m*Gy)/(m + n) ).

Given t = 2/5, so m:n = 2:3.

So, Hx = (3*0 + 2*6)/(2 + 3) = 12/5, Hy = (3*0 + 2*3)/5 = 6/5, which matches our earlier result.

Therefore, H is closer to A, 2/5 of the way from A to G.

But how does this help in computing BH?

Wait, since we know that H is on AG, and also on BH, perhaps we can compute the length BH using similar triangles or ratios.

But since we have the coordinates, maybe it's better to stick with the distance formula.

But in the problem's scale, BE is 5, so all lengths are scaled accordingly.

Given that, the distance BH as we computed in the problem's scale is 1.

So, the answer is 1.

But again, since the problem is presented with a diagram, maybe I'm missing a property or a more straightforward way.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 1, but just to confirm, let's compute the distance from B to H in the original coordinate system and then scale it.

In original coordinates, BH is 3*sqrt(5)/5. So, in the problem's scale, since BE is 5 in the figure, which is 3*sqrt(5) in original coordinates, the scaling factor is k = 5 / (3*sqrt(5)) = sqrt(5)/3.

Therefore, BH in the problem's scale is (3*sqrt(5)/5) * (sqrt(5)/3) = (5/5) = 1.

Thus, BH is 1 unit.

I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The length of \( BH \) is \(\boxed{1}\) unit.
</think>

Given quadrilateral \( CDEG \) is a square with \( CD = 3 \), and quadrilateral \( BEFH \) is a rectangle with \( BE = 5 \). We need to find the length of \( BH \).

1. **Coordinates of Points**:
   - \( A = (0, 0) \)
   - \( B = (3, 0) \)
   - \( C = (6, 0) \)
   - \( D = (9, 0) \)
   - \( E = (9, 3) \)
   - \( G = (6, 3) \)

2. **Finding Point H**:
   - Line \( AG \) has the equation \( y = \frac{1}{2}x \).
   - Line \( BH \) is found by determining its slope and intersection with \( AG \).
   - The slope of \( BH \) is perpendicular to \( BE \), which has a slope of \( \frac{1}{2} \). Thus, the slope of \( BH \) is \( -2 \).
   - The equation of line \( BH \) passing through \( B(3, 0) \) is \( y = -2x + 6 \).

3. **Intersection Point H**:
   - Solving the equations \( y = \frac{1}{2}x \) and \( y = -2x + 6 \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2}x = -2x + 6
     \]
     \[
     x = 12/5, \quad y = 6/5
     \]
   - Thus, \( H \) is at \( (12/5, 6/5) \).

4. **Distance BH**:
   - Calculate the distance between \( B(3, 0) \) and \( H(12/5, 6/5) \):
     \[
     BH = \sqrt{\left(3 - \frac{12}{5}\right)^2 + \left(0 - \frac{6}{5}\right)^2}
     \]
     \[
     = \sqrt{\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{6}{5}\right)^2}
     \]
     \[
     = \sqrt{\frac{9}{25} + \frac{36}{25}}
     \]
     \[
     = \sqrt{\frac{45}{25}} = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5}
     \]

5. **Scaling Factor**:
   - Given \( BE = 5 \) in the problem's scale, the scaling factor \( k \) is:
     \[
     k = \frac{5}{3\sqrt{5}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}
     \]
   - Scaling \( BH \) by \( k \):
     \[
     BH = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5}\right) \times \left(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}\right) = 1
     \]

Thus, the length of \( BH \) is \(\boxed{1}\) unit.
