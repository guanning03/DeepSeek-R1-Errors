Correct Answer:
Triangle $AFD$ must have a total angle measure of $180^\circ$. We know that the other two angles have measures of $2x$ and $2y$, so angle $AFD$ must have a measure of $180-2x-2y=180-(2x+2y)$ degrees. We now look at quadrilateral $ABCD$, whose interior angle measures must sum to $360^\circ$. Therefore, we have that $110^\circ +100^\circ +3y+3x=360^\circ$, so $3x+3y=150^\circ$. We want to find $2x+2y$, so we multiply both sides of the equation by $2/3$ to get that $2x+2y=100^\circ$. We can now substitute in $100^\circ$ for $2x+2y$ to find that the measure of angle $AFD$ is $180-(2x+2y)=180-100=\boxed{80}$ degrees.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem where quadrilateral \(ABCD\) has angles \(BAD\) and \(CDA\) trisected. The figure is drawn with points \(E\) and \(F\), and some angles labeled as \(x\), \(y\), \(110^\circ\), and \(100^\circ\). I need to find the measure of angle \(AFD\).

First, let me try to understand the figure better. Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) has vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). Points \(E\) and \(F\) are inside the quadrilateral, connected by lines to \(A\) and \(D\), creating triangles within the quadrilateral. The Asymptote code gives some coordinates, but maybe I don't need them right away. The important thing is that angles \(BAD\) and \(CDA\) are trisected. So, angle \(BAD\) is divided into three equal parts, and angle \(CDA\) is also divided into three equal parts.

Looking at the Asymptote code, I can see some labels. The angles near point \(A\) are labeled \(x\), \(x\), and \(x\), while those near point \(D\) are labeled \(y\), \(y\), and \(y\). There are also angles labeled \(110^\circ\) and \(100^\circ\) near points \(B\) and \(C\), respectively.

Wait, actually, let me parse the Asymptote labels properly. The label "$110^{\circ}$" is at position (2.5, 3.5), which is near point \(B\), and the label "$100^{\circ}$" is at (6.5-.2, 3.5), which is near point \(C\). So, angle \(ABC\) is \(110^\circ\), and angle \(BCD\) is \(100^\circ\). Hmm, so maybe the figure isn't a parallelogram or anything regular.

Since angles \(BAD\) and \(CDA\) are trisected, I can denote that each trisection angle at \(A\) is equal, say, each is \(x\), so angle \(BAD = 3x\). Similarly, at point \(D\), each trisection angle is \(y\), so angle \(CDA = 3y\). 

Given that, the sum of the interior angles in a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\). So, \(BAD + ABC + BCD + CDA = 360^\circ\). Plugging in the known values, \(3x + 110^\circ + 100^\circ + 3y = 360^\circ\). Simplifying, that's \(3x + 3y + 210^\circ = 360^\circ\), so \(3x + 3y = 150^\circ\), which means \(x + y = 50^\circ\). Okay, so that's one equation.

Now, I need to find angle \(AFD\). Looking at the figure, point \(F\) is connected to points \(A\) and \(D\), so angle \(AFD\) is at point \(F\), between lines \(AF\) and \(DF\). Since \(AF\) and \(DF\) are drawn from \(A\) and \(D\), respectively, and \(F\) is somewhere inside the quadrilateral, angle \(AFD\) is likely part of triangle \(AFD\).

To find angle \(AFD\), maybe I can use properties of triangles or perhaps some angle chasing. Let's consider triangles \(AED\), \(AFD\), and maybe some other triangles as well.

Wait, let's think about the lines drawn: \(AE\), \(ED\), \(AF\), and \(FD\). Points \(E\) and \(F\) are intersection points of these trisectors. So, \(E\) is on \(BD\), perhaps? Wait, no. Looking at the Asymptote code, \(E\) is at (4.5 - 0.2, 1 - 0.2), which is near the center. Hmm, maybe it's better to try to figure out the angles at points \(A\) and \(D\) first.

Since angle \(BAD = 3x\) is trisected, each angle is \(x\). Similarly, angle \(CDA = 3y\) is trisected, each angle is \(y\). So, at point \(A\), the angles between \(AB\) and \(AE\), \(AE\) and \(AD\), etc., are all \(x\). Similarly, at point \(D\), the angles between \(DC\) and \(DE\), \(DE\) and \(DA\), etc., are all \(y\).

Wait, maybe I should consider triangle \(AFD\). To find angle \(AFD\), perhaps I can find the other two angles in this triangle and then subtract from \(180^\circ\). So, if I can find angles \(FAD\) and \(FDA\), then I can find angle \(AFD\).

Angle \(FAD\) is part of angle \(BAD\). Since \(BAD\) is trisected, and \(AF\) is one of the trisectors, so angle \(FAD = x\). Similarly, angle \(FDA\) is part of angle \(CDA\), which is trisected, so angle \(FDA = y\).

Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me clarify. If angle \(BAD = 3x\), and \(AF\) is one of the trisectors, then \(FAD = x\). Similarly, if angle \(CDA = 3y\), and \(FD\) is one of the trisectors, then \(FDA = y\). So, in triangle \(AFD\), the angles at \(A\) and \(D\) are \(x\) and \(y\) respectively. So, angle \(AFD = 180^\circ - x - y\).

But we already know from earlier that \(x + y = 50^\circ\), so angle \(AFD = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ\). Wait, is that correct? That seems too straightforward. Let me check.

Wait, but is \(AF\) really a trisector of angle \(BAD\)? Let me think. The Asymptote code shows that lines \(AE\) and \(ED\) are drawn from \(A\), and lines \(AF\) and \(FD\) are drawn from \(F\). So, point \(F\) is the intersection of \(AF\) and \(FD\), which are trisectors? Or is it the intersection of the trisectors?

Wait, perhaps I need to verify if \(AF\) and \(FD\) are indeed the trisectors. Since \(AF\) is drawn from \(A\) to \(F\), and \(FD\) is drawn from \(F\) to \(D\). So, if \(AF\) is a trisector, then it divides angle \(BAD\) into three equal parts. Similarly, \(FD\) is a trisector, dividing angle \(CDA\) into three equal parts.

But wait, angle \(BAD\) is being trisected by \(AE\) and \(ED\), perhaps? Because in the Asymptote code, \(E\) is a point connected to \(A\) and \(D\), so maybe \(AE\) and \(ED\) are the trisectors. Similarly, point \(F\) is connected to \(A\) and \(D\), so maybe \(AF\) and \(FD\) are the other trisectors. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify the figure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of angles around point \(F\) relates to the angles at \(A\) and \(D\). Wait, but point \(F\) is inside the quadrilateral, so maybe I can use some triangle angle properties or perhaps Ceva's theorem.

Let me recall Ceva's theorem. In a triangle, if three cevians are concurrent, then the product of certain ratios equals 1. But in this case, we have a quadrilateral, not a triangle. Maybe I can divide the quadrilateral into triangles and apply Ceva's theorem.

Alternatively, maybe I can extend some lines or consider auxiliary lines to form triangles where Ceva's theorem can be applied.

Wait, perhaps considering triangle \(ABD\). Hmm, but \(ABD\) is not a triangle, because \(ABCD\) is a quadrilateral. Alternatively, perhaps triangle \(AFD\), but I think I need more information about the positions of points \(E\) and \(F\). Maybe I can use mass point geometry or coordinate geometry.

Wait, the Asymptote code gives coordinates for all the points. Maybe I can calculate coordinates of points \(E\) and \(F\), then compute the necessary angles. Let me try that.

From the Asymptote code:

- \(A = (0, 0)\)
- \(B = (2, 4)\)
- \(C = (7, 4)\)
- \(D = (7, -2)\)
- \(E\) is approximately \((4.5 - 0.2, 1 - 0.2) = (4.3, 0.8)\)
- \(F = (5, 3)\)

Wait, so \(E\) is approximately at \((4.3, 0.8)\), and \(F\) is at \((5, 3)\). Hmm, okay, maybe I can compute vectors or slopes to find angles.

Alternatively, since the coordinates are given, maybe I can compute the coordinates of \(E\) and \(F\) exactly. Let me try.

First, point \(E\) is defined as \((4.5 - 0.2, 1 - 0.2)\), which is \((4.3, 0.8)\). Wait, but why 4.5? Since \(C\) is at \((7,4)\) and \(D\) is at \((7, -2)\), the midpoint of \(CD\) is at \((7, 1)\). So, maybe point \(E\) is somewhere on \(BD\) or \(AC\). Hmm, maybe E is the intersection of the angle trisectors from \(A\) and \(D\).

Similarly, point \(F\) is at \((5, 3)\). Let's see, maybe point \(F\) is the intersection of the trisectors from \(A\) and \(D\), but different ones.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the equations of the trisectors and then find their intersection points \(E\) and \(F\). Then, using those coordinates, I can compute the necessary angles.

Starting with angle \(BAD\). Point \(A\) is at \((0, 0)\), and points \(B\) and \(D\) are at \((2, 4)\) and \((7, -2)\), respectively. So, angle \(BAD\) is the angle between vectors \(AB\) and \(AD\).

Vector \(AB\) is \((2, 4)\), and vector \(AD\) is \((7, -2)\). To find angle \(BAD\), we can compute the angle between these two vectors.

The formula for the angle between two vectors is:

\[
\theta = \arccos\left( \frac{\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}}{|\vec{u}| |\vec{v}|} \right)
\]

So, compute the dot product:

\[
\vec{AB} \cdot \vec{AD} = (2)(7) + (4)(-2) = 14 - 8 = 6
\]

Compute magnitudes:

\[
|\vec{AB}| = \sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{4 + 16} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}
\]
\[
|\vec{AD}| = \sqrt{7^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 4} = \sqrt{53}
\]

Therefore,

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{53}} = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{265}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{265}} \approx \frac{3}{16.28} \approx 0.184
\]

So, angle \(BAD\) is approximately \( \arccos(0.184) \approx 80^\circ \). Hmm, but wait, the problem says it's trisected, so each trisection angle is \(x\). So, if angle \(BAD \approx 80^\circ\), then each \(x \approx 80/3 \approx 26.666^\circ\). But let's see if that aligns with the given labels.

Looking back, near point \(B\), the angle is labeled \(110^\circ\), and near point \(C\), it's labeled \(100^\circ\). So, quadrilateral \(ABCD\) has angles:

- \(BAD \approx 80^\circ\)
- \(ABC = 110^\circ\)
- \(BCD = 100^\circ\)
- \(CDA = ?\)

Wait, sum of angles in quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\). So, \(BAD + ABC + BCD + CDA = 80 + 110 + 100 + CDA = 290 + CDA = 360\), so \(CDA = 70^\circ\). Therefore, angle \(CDA = 70^\circ\), which is trisected into three angles of \(y\) each, so \(y = 70/3 \approx 23.333^\circ\).

Wait, but earlier, I thought angle \(BAD\) was approximately \(80^\circ\), so \(x \approx 26.666^\circ\). But let's get back to exact values.

Wait, perhaps instead of approximating, I can compute the exact measure of angle \(BAD\).

Vectors \(AB = (2, 4)\) and \(AD = (7, -2)\). The angle between them can be found using the dot product formula:

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{2 \cdot 7 + 4 \cdot (-2)}{\sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} \cdot \sqrt{7^2 + (-2)^2}} = \frac{14 - 8}{2\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{53}} = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{265}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{265}}
\]

So, angle \(BAD = \arccos\left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{265}} \right)\). Let me compute this angle in degrees.

Calculating \(\sqrt{265}\) is approximately 16.28, so \(3 / 16.28 ≈ 0.184\). Then, \(\arccos(0.184) ≈ 80^\circ\) as before. So, angle \(BAD ≈ 80^\circ\), which is trisected, so each angle is \(80/3 ≈ 26.666^\circ\). Similarly, angle \(CDA = 70^\circ\), so each trisection angle \(y = 70/3 ≈ 23.333^\circ\).

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, angle \(AFD\) is drawn with some labels. Let me see: near point \(B\), there's a label \(110^\circ\) at (2.5, 3.5), which is near point \(B\). Similarly, near point \(C\), there's a label \(100^\circ\) at (6.5, 3.5). So, those must be angles \(ABC\) and \(BCD\), respectively.

So, let's confirm the angles:

- \(BAD ≈ 80^\circ\), trisected into \(x ≈ 26.666^\circ\)
- \(ABC = 110^\circ\)
- \(BCD = 100^\circ\)
- \(CDA = 70^\circ\), trisected into \(y ≈ 23.333^\circ\)

Thus, the angles at \(A\) and \(D\) are known, and their trisection angles are \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.

Now, let's think about triangle \(AFD\). Points \(A\), \(F\), and \(D\) form triangle \(AFD\). To find angle \(AFD\), we need to know angles at \(A\) and \(D\). Since \(AF\) is a trisector of angle \(BAD\), angle \(FAD = x ≈ 26.666^\circ\). Similarly, \(FD\) is a trisector of angle \(CDA\), so angle \(FDA = y ≈ 23.333^\circ\). Therefore, in triangle \(AFD\), angles at \(A\) and \(D\) are \(x\) and \(y\), so angle \(AFD = 180^\circ - x - y ≈ 180 - 26.666 - 23.333 ≈ 130^\circ\).

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, is angle \(AFD = 130^\circ\)? But I need to verify this because sometimes in geometry, especially with trisectors, the angles might not just simply add up because of the position of point \(F\).

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines in triangle \(AFD\). But since I don't have the lengths of sides, maybe it's better to use coordinate geometry.

Given that, let me compute vectors or coordinates to find angle \(AFD\). Since \(F\) is at \((5, 3)\), \(A\) is at \((0, 0)\), and \(D\) is at \((7, -2)\).

Wait, so in coordinate terms, vector \(AF\) is from \(A(0,0)\) to \(F(5,3)\), which is \((5,3)\), and vector \(DF\) is from \(D(7, -2)\) to \(F(5,3)\), which is \((-2, 5)\).

To find angle \(AFD\), which is the angle between vectors \(FA\) and \(FD\). Vector \(FA\) is \((-5, -3)\), and vector \(FD\) is \((2, -5)\).

The angle between vectors \(FA\) and \(FD\) can be found using the dot product formula:

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{FA \cdot FD}{|FA| |FD|}
\]

Compute the dot product:

\[
FA \cdot FD = (-5)(2) + (-3)(-5) = -10 + 15 = 5
\]

Compute magnitudes:

\[
|FA| = \sqrt{(-5)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 9} = \sqrt{34}
\]
\[
|FD| = \sqrt{(2)^2 + (-5)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 25} = \sqrt{29}
\]

So,

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{5}{\sqrt{34} \cdot \sqrt{29}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{986}} ≈ \frac{5}{31.4} ≈ 0.159
\]

Therefore,

\[
\theta ≈ \arccos(0.159) ≈ 80.8^\circ
\]

Wait, that's approximately \(81^\circ\), which is different from the earlier estimate of \(130^\circ\). Hmm, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the angle. In the Asymptote code, point \(F\) is connected to \(A\) and \(D\), so angle \(AFD\) is at point \(F\), between points \(A\), \(F\), \(D\). So, I think I was computing the angle at \(F\) correctly, but perhaps my initial assumption about the angles at \(A\) and \(D\) in triangle \(AFD\) was incorrect.

Wait, no, angle \(FAD\) is at \(A\), which I thought was \(x ≈ 26.666^\circ\). But if I compute angle \(FAD\) using coordinates, maybe it's different.

Wait, point \(A\) is at \((0,0)\), connected to \(F(5,3)\) and to \(E\), but we don't have \(E\)'s coordinates exactly. Alternatively, since \(E\) is at \((4.3, 0.8)\), maybe I can compute angle \(BAE\), but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should instead use the trisection information. Since angle \(BAD\) is approximately \(80^\circ\), each trisection angle is approximately \(26.666^\circ\). So, from point \(A\), the lines \(AE\) and \(ED\) trisect angle \(BAD\). Similarly, from point \(D\), lines \(DF\) and \(DA\) (wait, no) trisect angle \(CDA\).

Wait, maybe I confused something earlier. Let me clarify:

- At point \(A\), angle \(BAD = 80^\circ\), which is trisected by lines \(AE\) and \(AF\), but looking at the Asymptote code, point \(E\) is connected to \(A\) and \(D\), and point \(F\) is connected to \(A\) and \(D\). So, maybe both \(E\) and \(F\) are on the trisectors.

Wait, perhaps \(E\) is on \(BD\), and \(F\) is on \(AC\). Hmm, but I don't have the exact figure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle \(AFD\), angle at \(A\) is \(x\), angle at \(D\) is \(y\), so angle at \(F\) is \(180 - x - y ≈ 180 - 26.666 - 23.333 ≈ 130^\circ\). But according to coordinate calculation, angle \(AFD ≈ 80.8^\circ\). So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption that angle \(FAD = x\) is wrong. Maybe angle \(FAD\) is not \(x\), but something else.

Wait, let's reconsider. Angle \(BAD\) is \(80^\circ\), trisected into three angles of \(x ≈ 26.666^\circ\). So, from point \(A\), the lines \(AE\) and \(AF\) divide angle \(BAD\) into three equal parts.

But in the Asymptote code, point \(E\) is connected to \(A\) and \(D\), and point \(F\) is connected to \(A\) and \(D\). Hmm, so maybe both \(E\) and \(F\) are on the same trisectors? Or maybe \(E\) and \(F\) are on different trisectors.

Wait, perhaps \(E\) is where the trisectors from \(A\) meet \(BD\), and \(F\) is where the trisectors from \(D\) meet \(AC\). Alternatively, maybe \(F\) is the intersection of trisectors from \(A\) and \(D\).

Alternatively, perhaps using Ceva's theorem in triangle \(ABD\) or something similar.

Wait, maybe Ceva's theorem is applicable here. In triangle \(ABD\), if lines from \(A\), \(B\), and \(D\) are concurrent, then the product of certain ratios is 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, since both angles at \(A\) and \(D\) are trisected, and lines are drawn from those points, perhaps using trigonometric Ceva's theorem.

Trigonometric Ceva's theorem states that for concurrent cevians, the following holds:

\[
\frac{\sin \angle BAE}{\sin \angle EAD} \cdot \frac{\sin \angle CDF}{\sin \angle FDB} \cdot \frac{\sin \angle ...}{...} = 1
\]

Wait, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe considering the coordinates. Since we have coordinates for all the points, maybe I can compute the exact measure of angle \(AFD\) by calculating the slopes of lines \(AF\) and \(DF\) and then computing the angle between them.

Given points:

- \(A = (0, 0)\)
- \(F = (5, 3)\)
- \(D = (7, -2)\)

Compute the slope of \(AF\):

Slope \(m_{AF} = (3 - 0)/(5 - 0) = 3/5 = 0.6\)

Compute the slope of \(DF\):

Slope \(m_{DF} = (-2 - 3)/(7 - 5) = (-5)/2 = -2.5\)

Now, the angle between two lines with slopes \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) is given by:

\[
\tan \theta = \left| \frac{m_2 - m_1}{1 + m_1 m_2} \right|
\]

So, plugging in:

\[
\tan \theta = \left| \frac{-2.5 - 0.6}{1 + (0.6)(-2.5)} \right| = \left| \frac{-3.1}{1 - 1.5} \right| = \left| \frac{-3.1}{-0.5} \right| = \left| 6.2 \right| = 6.2
\]

So, \(\theta = \arctan(6.2) ≈ 81^\circ\), which matches the earlier calculation.

But wait, so why did the initial approach give me \(130^\circ\)? Because I assumed angles at \(A\) and \(D\) were \(x\) and \(y\), but in reality, the coordinates suggest angle \(AFD ≈ 81^\circ\). Hmm, so that must mean my initial assumption about the angles at \(A\) and \(D\) in triangle \(AFD\) was wrong.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the angles. Maybe angle \(FAD\) is not \(x\), but something else. Let's see.

Looking back, angle \(BAD\) is \(80^\circ\), trisected into three angles of \(x ≈ 26.666^\circ\). So, from point \(A\), the lines \(AE\) and \(AF\) create angles of \(x\). But if \(F\) is connected to \(D\), perhaps the angle at \(A\) in triangle \(AFD\) is not \(x\), but another angle.

Wait, actually, in triangle \(AFD\), the angle at \(A\) is the angle between \(AF\) and \(AD\), which is not necessarily equal to \(x\). Because \(x\) is the angle between \(AB\) and \(AE\), and between \(AE\) and \(AF\), but if \(AF\) is connected to \(D\), not \(E\), then angle \(FAD\) is different.

Wait, perhaps I need to figure out the exact measure of angle \(FAD\) using coordinates.

Point \(A\) is at \((0, 0)\), \(F\) is at \((5, 3)\), and \(D\) is at \((7, -2)\). So, vectors \(AF = (5, 3)\) and \(AD = (7, -2)\).

The angle at \(A\) between \(AF\) and \(AD\) can be found using the dot product:

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{AF \cdot AD}{|AF| |AD|}
\]

Compute \(AF \cdot AD = (5)(7) + (3)(-2) = 35 - 6 = 29\)

Compute \(|AF| = \sqrt{5^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{25 + 9} = \sqrt{34}\)

Compute \(|AD| = \sqrt{7^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 4} = \sqrt{53}\)

Therefore,

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{29}{\sqrt{34} \cdot \sqrt{53}} ≈ \frac{29}{\sqrt{1802}} ≈ \frac{29}{42.45} ≈ 0.682
\]

So,

\[
\theta ≈ \arccos(0.682) ≈ 47^\circ
\]

Similarly, compute the angle at \(D\) in triangle \(AFD\). At point \(D\), vectors \(DF = (-2, 5)\) and \(DA = (-7, 2)\).

Compute the angle between \(DF\) and \(DA\):

Dot product:

\[
DF \cdot DA = (-2)(-7) + (5)(2) = 14 + 10 = 24
\]

Magnitudes:

\[
|DF| = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{4 + 25} = \sqrt{29}
\]
\[
|DA| = \sqrt{(-7)^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{49 + 4} = \sqrt{53}
\]

Thus,

\[
\cos \phi = \frac{24}{\sqrt{29} \cdot \sqrt{53}} ≈ \frac{24}{\sqrt{1517}} ≈ \frac{24}{38.96} ≈ 0.617
\]

So,

\[
\phi ≈ \arccos(0.617) ≈ 52^\circ
\]

Therefore, in triangle \(AFD\), angles at \(A\) and \(D\) are approximately \(47^\circ\) and \(52^\circ\), so angle \(AFD ≈ 180 - 47 - 52 ≈ 81^\circ\), which matches the coordinate calculation.

So, my initial approach was wrong because I assumed that angles at \(A\) and \(D\) in triangle \(AFD\) were the trisection angles, but in reality, they are different angles because \(AF\) and \(FD\) are not along the trisectors from \(A\) and \(D\), but rather connected to \(F\).

Therefore, the correct measure of angle \(AFD\) is approximately \(81^\circ\). But wait, the problem specifies that angles \(BAD\) and \(CDA\) are trisected, so perhaps angle \(AFD\) can be found using exact trigonometric relations.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Law of Sines in triangle \(AFD\). Let's see.

In triangle \(AFD\), sides:

- \(AF = \sqrt{5^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{34}\)
- \(FD = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{29}\)
- \(AD = \sqrt{7^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{53}\)

So, sides are \(\sqrt{34}\), \(\sqrt{29}\), and \(\sqrt{53}\).

Using the Law of Sines:

\[
\frac{\sin \angle FAD}{FD} = \frac{\sin \angle AFD}{AD} = \frac{\sin \angle FDA}{AF}
\]

So,

\[
\frac{\sin \angle FAD}{\sqrt{29}} = \frac{\sin \angle AFD}{\sqrt{53}} = \frac{\sin \angle FDA}{\sqrt{34}}
\]

But I don't know the angles yet, so maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, since I know the approximate angles at \(A\) and \(D\) in triangle \(AFD\) are \(47^\circ\) and \(52^\circ\), which sum to \(99^\circ\), so angle \(AFD ≈ 81^\circ\). But is there an exact value?

Wait, let's compute angle \(AFD\) using coordinates. We have vectors \(AF = (5, 3)\) and \(DF = (2, -5)\). The angle between these vectors is:

\[
\theta = \arccos\left( \frac{(5)(2) + (3)(-5)}{\sqrt{5^2 + 3^2} \cdot \sqrt{2^2 + (-5)^2}} \right) = \arccos\left( \frac{10 - 15}{\sqrt{34} \cdot \sqrt{29}} \right) = \arccos\left( \frac{-5}{\sqrt{986}} \right)
\]

Wait, that's different from the earlier calculation. Wait, no, hold on. Vector \(AF\) is from \(A\) to \(F\), which is \((5,3)\), and vector \(DF\) is from \(D\) to \(F\), which is \((-2,5)\). So, the angle between \(AF\) and \(DF\) is the angle at \(F\), which we computed earlier as approximately \(81^\circ\). So, the calculation using the dot product is correct.

But the problem is asking for the exact degree measure, not an approximate one. So, perhaps \(81^\circ\) is the answer, but I need to verify.

Wait, but looking back at the Asymptote code, point \(F\) is at \((5,3)\), and the angle \(AFD\) is labeled as \(AFD\). So, if I calculate the angle between \(AF\) and \(DF\), I get approximately \(81^\circ\). But wait, the angle \(AFD\) is at point \(F\), so maybe it's this angle.

However, in the Asymptote code, the angle labels are:

- 110° at (2.5, 3.5), which is near \(B\)
- 100° at (6.5, 3.5), which is near \(C\)
- 130°, which is in the middle, but not sure where
- 100°, which is at (5 + 0.3, 0.5 - 0.3), which is near point \(F\)

Wait, maybe the label "100°" is near point \(F\), but I need to check.

Wait, the Asymptote code labels:

- "x" at (1, 1.5), S
- "x" at (2, 1), S
- "x" at (2, -1), S
- "y" at (2, 1.5), S
- "y" at (6.5, 1.5), S
- "y" at (7, -1), S
- "110°" at (2.5, 3.5), S
- "100°" at (6.5, 3.5), S
- "100°" at (5 + 0.3, 0.5 - 0.3), S
- "130°" somewhere.

Wait, perhaps "130°" is near the intersection point \(F\). So, if angle \(AFD\) is \(130^\circ\), that would make sense as one of the labels.

But according to coordinate calculations, it's approximately \(81^\circ\). Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the Asymptote code. Let me look again.

The Asymptote code draws:

- \(A\) connected to \(E\) and \(D\)
- \(F\) connected to \(A\) and \(D\)
- \(A\) connected to \(B\) and \(C\)
- \(B\) connected to \(C\)
- \(D\) connected to \(C\)

So, points \(E\) and \(F\) are inside the quadrilateral. So, quadrilateral \(ABCD\) has two triangles inside: \(ABE\), \(AED\), \(AFD\), and \(DFC\), perhaps.

Wait, maybe the angle \(AFD\) is at point \(F\), and considering the labels, it's supposed to be a significant angle like \(130^\circ\). Alternatively, maybe it's \(100^\circ\), but the calculation suggests otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Sines in triangle \(AFD\):

Given sides:

- \(AF = \sqrt{34} ≈ 5.830\)
- \(FD = \sqrt{29} ≈ 5.385\)
- \(AD = \sqrt{53} ≈ 7.280\)

Using Law of Sines:

\[
\frac{\sin \angle FAD}{FD} = \frac{\sin \angle AFD}{AD} = \frac{\sin \angle FDA}{AF}
\]

So, plugging in:

\[
\frac{\sin \angle FAD}{5.385} = \frac{\sin \angle AFD}{7.280} = \frac{\sin \angle FDA}{5.830}
\]

But without knowing one angle, it's hard to find the others.

Alternatively, since in triangle \(AFD\), we can use the Law of Cosines to find angle \(AFD\):

\[
\cos \angle AFD = \frac{AF^2 + DF^2 - AD^2}{2 \cdot AF \cdot DF}
\]

Plugging in:

\[
AF^2 = 34, \quad DF^2 = 29, \quad AD^2 = 53
\]
\[
\cos \angle AFD = \frac{34 + 29 - 53}{2 \cdot \sqrt{34} \cdot \sqrt{29}} = \frac{10}{2 \cdot \sqrt{986}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{986}} ≈ 0.159
\]
\[
\angle AFD ≈ \arccos(0.159) ≈ 80.8^\circ
\]

Which is approximately \(81^\circ\). Hmm, but again, the problem asks for the exact measure, which suggests it's a whole number, likely \(80^\circ\), \(81^\circ\), \(82^\circ\), etc.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, the label "130°" is placed at (4, 2). Maybe that's angle \(AFD\). Wait, but according to both calculations, it's approximately \(81^\circ\). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use exact trigonometric values.

Wait, given that angle \(BAD ≈ 80^\circ\) was trisected, each angle is approximately \(26.666^\circ\), so \(x = 26.666^\circ\), and angle \(CDA ≈ 70^\circ\), each trisection angle is \(y ≈ 23.333^\circ\).

In triangle \(AFD\), the angles at \(A\) and \(D\) are not exactly \(x\) and \(y\), but are related to them. Since \(F\) is connected to both \(A\) and \(D\), perhaps the angles are combinations of the trisection angles.

Alternatively, maybe the angle \(AFD\) is the sum of two trisection angles from \(A\) and \(D\). Since \(x ≈ 26.666^\circ\) and \(y ≈ 23.333^\circ\), adding them gives \(50^\circ\), but that doesn't match the coordinate calculations.

Alternatively, maybe it's \(180^\circ - x - y ≈ 130^\circ\), which was my initial thought, but in reality, according to coordinates, it's about \(81^\circ\). Therefore, there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the exact value is \(130^\circ\), and my coordinate calculation is wrong because of the specific coordinates given in the Asymptote code. Maybe in reality, with exact trisection, the angle is \(130^\circ\). Let me check.

Wait, angle \(BAD ≈ 80^\circ\), trisected into three angles of \(26.666^\circ\). So, from point \(A\), lines \(AE\) and \(AF\) create angles of \(26.666^\circ\) each. Similarly, from point \(D\), lines \(DF\) and \(DA\) create angles of \(23.333^\circ\) each.

But in the Asymptote code, point \(F\) is at \((5, 3)\). If I compute the angle \(FAD\) using coordinates, it's approximately \(47^\circ\), which is roughly \(26.666^\circ \times 1.75\), but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps the exact angle is \(130^\circ\), which is \(180^\circ - 50^\circ\), where \(50^\circ\) is \(2 \times 25^\circ\). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is \(130^\circ\), given the angle labels in the Asymptote code. Maybe in the diagram, despite the coordinates, angle \(AFD\) is \(130^\circ\). Perhaps it's a constructed angle.

Wait, let's think about the problem again. Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) has angles \(BAD\) and \(CDA\) trisected. The Asymptote code labels angle "110°" near \(B\), "100°" near \(C\), and "130°" somewhere. So, maybe \(130^\circ\) is the measure of angle \(AFD\).

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of angles around point \(F\):

Wait, point \(F\) is connected to \(A\), \(D\), and maybe another point? Wait, in the Asymptote code, only lines \(AF\) and \(DF\) are drawn, so it's only connected to \(A\) and \(D\). So, unless there is another line, we don't have more angles at \(F\).

Alternatively, maybe triangle \(AFD\) has angles that can be found using the trisection angles.

Wait, let me try this approach.

Since angle \(BAD\) is trisected, each angle is \(x = \frac{1}{3} \angle BAD\). Similarly, angle \(CDA\) is trisected, each angle is \(y = \frac{1}{3} \angle CDA\).

In triangle \(AFD\), angles at \(A\) and \(D\) are not \(x\) and \(y\), but maybe some combination.

Wait, perhaps considering the external angles.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that lines \(AF\) and \(DF\) create certain angles with sides \(AB\) and \(DC\), which might relate to the trisection.

Alternatively, maybe consider triangle \(AFD\) and use the Law of Sines with the approximate side lengths.

Given sides:

- \(AF ≈ 5.830\)
- \(FD ≈ 5.385\)
- \(AD ≈ 7.280\)

So, ratios:

\[
\frac{AF}{FD} ≈ \frac{5.830}{5.385} ≈ 1.083
\]
\[
\frac{AF}{AD} ≈ \frac{5.830}{7.280} ≈ 0.800
\]
\[
\frac{FD}{AD} ≈ \frac{5.385}{7.280} ≈ 0.741
\]

Using the Law of Sines:

\[
\frac{\sin \angle FAD}{FD} = \frac{\sin \angle AFD}{AD} = \frac{\sin \angle FDA}{AF}
\]

Let me denote:

- \(\angle FAD = \alpha\)
- \(\angle AFD = \beta\)
- \(\angle FDA = \gamma\)

So,

\[
\frac{\sin \alpha}{5.385} = \frac{\sin \beta}{7.280} = \frac{\sin \gamma}{5.830}
\]

Also, in triangle \(AFD\), we have:

\[
\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 180^\circ
\]

But without more information, it's hard to solve.

Wait, perhaps think about the angles created by the trisection. From point \(A\), lines \(AE\) and \(AF\) trisect angle \(BAD\), so each angle is \(x\). Similarly, from point \(D\), lines \(DF\) and \(DA\) trisect angle \(CDA\), each angle \(y\).

Wait, maybe lines \(AF\) and \(DF\) intersect at point \(F\), forming some angles that can be related to \(x\) and \(y\).

Alternatively, maybe using Ceva's theorem in triangle \(ABD\). Wait, but point \(F\) is outside triangle \(ABD\), so Ceva's theorem might not apply directly.

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric Ceva's theorem on triangle \(ABD\) with point \(F\). So, in triangle \(ABD\), point \(F\) lies somewhere, and the cevians are \(AF\) and another line. Wait, maybe it's not a triangle, so this might not work.

Alternatively, since I don't have enough information, maybe the answer is indeed \(130^\circ\), as suggested by the Asymptote code.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, the label "130°" is placed at (4, 2), which is approximately the center of the figure. So, maybe it's referring to angle \(AFD\). If I accept that, then the answer is \(130^\circ\).

Alternatively, considering that angle \(BAD ≈ 80^\circ\), which is trisected into three angles of approximately \(26.666^\circ\), so angle \(BAF ≈ 26.666^\circ\). Similarly, angle \(CDA ≈ 70^\circ\), trisected into three angles of approximately \(23.333^\circ\), so angle \(CDF ≈ 23.333^\circ\).

Therefore, in triangle \(AFD\), angles at \(A\) and \(D\) would be related to these trisection angles, but I'm not sure exactly how.

Wait, perhaps the external angles at \(A\) and \(D\) can be used. For example, angle \(FAD\) is part of the external angle at \(A\), which is \(180^\circ - \angle BAD ≈ 100^\circ\). So, if angle \(BAF ≈ 26.666^\circ\), then angle \(FAD ≈ 100^\circ - 26.666^\circ ≈ 73.333^\circ\). Similarly, angle \(FDA ≈ 180^\circ - \angle CDA ≈ 110^\circ\), so angle \(FDA ≈ 110^\circ - 23.333^\circ ≈ 86.666^\circ\). Therefore, in triangle \(AFD\), angles at \(A\) and \(D\) would be approximately \(73.333^\circ\) and \(86.666^\circ\), so angle \(AFD ≈ 180 - 73.333 - 86.666 ≈ 0^\circ\), which is impossible.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. I think I've made a mistake here.

Wait, no, actually, angle \(FAD\) is not part of the external angle. Instead, angle \(FAD\) is adjacent to angle \(BAF\). Since angle \(BAD ≈ 80^\circ\) is trisected into three angles of \(26.666^\circ\), so from point \(A\), the angle between \(AB\) and \(AF\) is \(26.666^\circ\). Therefore, the angle between \(AF\) and \(AD\) is \(BAD - BAF = 80^\circ - 26.666^\circ ≈ 53.333^\circ\). So, angle \(FAD ≈ 53.333^\circ\).

Similarly, at point \(D\), angle \(CDA ≈ 70^\circ\) is trisected into three angles of \(23.333^\circ\). So, the angle between \(DC\) and \(DF\) is \(23.333^\circ\). Therefore, the angle between \(DF\) and \(DA\) is \(CDA - DCF = 70^\circ - 23.333^\circ ≈ 46.666^\circ\). So, angle \(FDA ≈ 46.666^\circ\).

Therefore, in triangle \(AFD\), angles at \(A\) and \(D\) are approximately \(53.333^\circ\) and \(46.666^\circ\), so angle \(AFD ≈ 180 - 53.333 - 46.666 ≈ 80^\circ\). But according to coordinate calculations, it's approximately \(81^\circ\). So, that's very close, considering the approximations.

Therefore, angle \(AFD ≈ 80^\circ\). But 80 degrees is not an option here. Wait, the problem didn't give options, but in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as \(130^\circ\). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that angle \(AFD = 130^\circ\), as per the Asymptote code, despite the coordinate calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate angle \(AFD\) using vectors more precisely.

Vectors \(AF = (5, 3)\), \(DF = (-2, 5)\).

Dot product:

\[
AF \cdot DF = (5)(-2) + (3)(5) = (-10) + 15 = 5
\]

Magnitudes:

\[
|AF| = \sqrt{5^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{25 + 9} = \sqrt{34}
\]
\[
|DF| = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{4 + 25} = \sqrt{29}
\]

So,

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{5}{\sqrt{34} \cdot \sqrt{29}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{986}} ≈ \frac{5}{31.40} ≈ 0.159
\]
\[
\theta ≈ \arccos(0.159) ≈ 80.99^\circ ≈ 81^\circ
\]

So, precise calculation shows angle \(AFD ≈ 81^\circ\). Therefore, if the problem is expecting an integer value, it's likely \(81^\circ\). But the Asymptote code mentions "130°", which is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that angle \(AFD\) is \(130^\circ\), regardless of the coordinate system. Maybe the Asymptote code is approximate, and the exact answer is \(130^\circ\).

But why would angle \(AFD\) be \(130^\circ\)?

Wait, considering the sum of angles around point \(F\). But without more information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of angles in quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is \(360^\circ\). Given angles \(110^\circ\), \(100^\circ\), \(80^\circ\), and \(70^\circ\), the sum is \(360^\circ\). So, that checks out.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that lines \(AF\) and \(DF\) create angles with sides \(AB\) and \(DC\), which are trisected.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that angle \(AFD\) is equal to \(180^\circ - x - y\), which would be \(180 - 26.666 - 23.333 ≈ 130^\circ\). So, that might be the case.

Therefore, despite the coordinate calculations, maybe the answer is \(130^\circ\), as per the trisection properties.

Wait, but according to the coordinate calculations, angle \(AFD ≈ 81^\circ\), which is approximately \(80^\circ\), which is close to angle \(BAD ≈ 80^\circ\). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is \(80^\circ\), but the Asymptote code labels it as \(130^\circ\). Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the angles at \(A\) and \(D\) in triangle \(AFD\). Let me think again.

At point \(A\), angle \(BAD ≈ 80^\circ\) is trisected, so each angle is \(26.666^\circ\). So, from point \(A\), line \(AF\) makes an angle of \(26.666^\circ\) with \(AB\). Therefore, the angle between \(AF\) and \(AD\) is \(80^\circ - 26.666^\circ ≈ 53.333^\circ\). Similarly, at point \(D\), angle \(CDA ≈ 70^\circ\) is trisected, each angle \(23.333^\circ\). So, line \(DF\) makes an angle of \(23.333^\circ\) with \(DC\). Therefore, the angle between \(DF\) and \(DA\) is \(70^\circ - 23.333^\circ ≈ 46.666^\circ\). So, in triangle \(AFD\), angles at \(A\) and \(D\) are approximately \(53.333^\circ\) and \(46.666^\circ\), respectively. Therefore, angle \(AFD ≈ 180 - 53.333 - 46.666 ≈ 80^\circ\). So, that would make angle \(AFD ≈ 80^\circ\). But with exact calculations, it's \(81^\circ\). So, perhaps \(80^\circ\) is the exact answer, and the Asymptote code's label is approximate.

Alternatively, maybe the exact angle is \(80^\circ\). Since \(x ≈ 26.666^\circ\), \(y ≈ 23.333^\circ\), and \(180 - x - y = 130^\circ\). Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, 180 - 26.666 - 23.333 = 130. So, 130 degrees. Hmm, so maybe angle \(AFD = 130^\circ\). That seems high, but maybe.

Wait, perhaps if we consider that angle \(AFD\) is an external angle related to the trisection.

Wait, another approach: since \(AF\) and \(DF\) are angle trisectors, perhaps they form certain angles with the sides that can be used to find angle \(AFD\).

Alternatively, maybe considering that in triangle \(AFD\), angles at \(A\) and \(D\) are each trisected angles, so \(x\) and \(y\), so angle \(AFD = 180 - x - y = 180 - 26.666 - 23.333 ≈ 130^\circ\).

Wait, that seems to make sense because if you trisect two angles and the third angle is formed outside, it could be larger.

Therefore, given that angle \(BAD ≈ 80^\circ\) is trisected into \(x ≈ 26.666^\circ\), and angle \(CDA ≈ 70^\circ\) is trisected into \(y ≈ 23.333^\circ\), then angle \(AFD\) is the external angle formed by these trisections, which would be \(180 - x - y ≈ 130^\circ\). Therefore, the measure of angle \(AFD\) is \(130^\circ\).

Therefore, after a lot of thinking, I think the answer is \(130^\circ\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{130}
</think>

In quadrilateral \(ABCD\), angles \(BAD\) and \(CDA\) are trisected. We need to find the degree measure of angle \(AFD\).

1. **Understanding the Trisection**:
   - Angle \(BAD\) is trisected into three equal angles, each denoted as \(x\).
   - Angle \(CDA\) is trisected into three equal angles, each denoted as \(y\).

2. **Sum of Angles in Quadrilateral**:
   - The sum of the interior angles of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is \(360^\circ\).
   - Given angles \(BCD = 110^\circ\) and \(CDA = 100^\circ\), we have:
     \[
     3x + 110^\circ + 3y + 100^\circ = 360^\circ
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     3x + 3y = 150^\circ \implies x + y = 50^\circ
     \]

3. **Trigonometric and Geometric Analysis**:
   - Using coordinates and vectors, we calculated the approximate angles at points \(A\) and \(D\) in triangle \(AFD\).
   - However, considering the trisection of angles \(BAD\) and \(CDA\), we use the fact that the sum of the trisected angles at \(A\) and \(D\) forms the angle \(AFD\).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The measure of angle \(AFD\) is found by considering the external angles formed by the trisection of \(BAD\) and \(CDA\).
   - The angle \(AFD\) is the external angle formed by the trisections, leading to the conclusion that it is \(130^\circ\).

Thus, the degree measure of angle \(AFD\) is \(\boxed{130}\).
