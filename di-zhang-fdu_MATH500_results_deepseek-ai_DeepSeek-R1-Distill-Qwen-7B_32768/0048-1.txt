Correct Answer:
Triangle $AFD$ must have a total angle measure of $180^\circ$. We know that the other two angles have measures of $2x$ and $2y$, so angle $AFD$ must have a measure of $180-2x-2y=180-(2x+2y)$ degrees. We now look at quadrilateral $ABCD$, whose interior angle measures must sum to $360^\circ$. Therefore, we have that $110^\circ +100^\circ +3y+3x=360^\circ$, so $3x+3y=150^\circ$. We want to find $2x+2y$, so we multiply both sides of the equation by $2/3$ to get that $2x+2y=100^\circ$. We can now substitute in $100^\circ$ for $2x+2y$ to find that the measure of angle $AFD$ is $180-(2x+2y)=180-100=\boxed{80}$ degrees.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. It involves a quadrilateral ABCD, and at points A and D, the angles are being trisected. The figure is drawn with Asymptote code, which I can sort of visualize. They've labeled points E and F as well, and there are some angle marks labeled as x and y, along with two specific angles given: 110 degrees at the top and 100 degrees at the bottom. The question is asking for the measure of angle AFD. Hmm, okay.

First, let me try to reconstruct the figure in my mind based on the Asymptote code. Point A is at (0,0), which is the origin. Point B is at (2,4), so that's somewhere up there. Point C is at (7,4), which is further to the right but same y-coordinate as B. Point D is at (7,-2), so that's way down below. So, ABCD is a quadrilateral with vertices at these coordinates.

Connecting these points, A to B, B to C, C to D, and D to A. So, the figure is a trapezoid? Wait, actually, looking at the coordinates, from A(0,0) to B(2,4) to C(7,4) to D(7,-2) and back to A. Hmm, so sides AB, BC, CD, DA. It's not a trapezoid because only BC and AD might be parallel? Wait, BC is from (2,4) to (7,4), so that's a horizontal line at y=4. AD is from (0,0) to (7,-2). Let me calculate the slope of AD. The change in y is -2 over 7, so slope is -2/7. So, BC is horizontal, AD is sloping downward, so they're not parallel. So, it's just a general quadrilateral.

Points E and F are inside the figure. E is at (4.5 - 0.2, 1 - 0.2), so approximately (4.3, 0.8). F is at (5,3). So, E is near the middle of the figure, a bit to the right and down, and F is near the top-right part. The Asymptote code draws lines from A to E to D and from A to F to D. So, A is connected to E and F, and both E and F are connected to D.

They've labeled some angles as x. Specifically, at point A, between BA and AE, and between AE and AD, both are labeled x. Similarly, at point D, between CD and DF, and between DF and DA, both are labeled y. Additionally, there are two specific angles given: 110 degrees at (2.5, 3.5), which is near the top middle, and 100 degrees at (6.5 - 0.2, 3.5), which is near the bottom middle. The question is asking for angle AFD, which is the angle at point F between AF and FD.

Alright, let me try to parse this. So, at point A, angle BAD is being trisected. So, angle BAD is split into three equal angles, each of measure x. Similarly, at point D, angle CDA is being trisected, so it's split into three equal angles, each of measure y. Given that, angle BAD is 3x, and angle CDA is 3y.

Given that, and the figure, I can perhaps find 3x and 3y first, and then work towards angle AFD.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, they've labeled angle AFD as 110 degrees and 100 degrees at two different places. Hmm, no, looking again, I see that in the Asymptote code, they've labeled 110 degrees at (2.5, 3.5), which is near the top, perhaps angle ABC or something, and 100 degrees at (6.5 - 0.2, 3.5), which is near the bottom, perhaps angle ADC? Wait, that might not make sense.

Wait, let me think. In the Asymptote code, labels are placed at specific coordinates. So, 110 degrees is at (2.5, 3.5), which is near the center of the figure, but slightly above the center. 100 degrees is at (6.5 - 0.2, 3.5), which is near the center, but slightly to the right. Hmm, maybe those are angles at points B and C? Or perhaps at points E and F? Wait, but angle marks usually correspond to specific angles.

Wait, the Asymptote code says:

label("$x$", (1, 1.5), S); label("$x$", (2, 1), S+W); label("$x$", (2, -1), N+N+N+W);

label("$y$", (5.5+.3, .5-.3), S); label("$y$", (6.5+.3, 0)); label("$y$", (5+.5, -1.5+.3));

So, at (1,1.5), which is near the left side, labeled x, pointing south. Then at (2,1), which is near point B, labeled x, pointing southwest. At (2,-1), which is near the bottom, labeled x, pointing north-north-west? Hmm, not sure. Then for y, at (5.5+.3, .5-.3), which is near the right side, labeled y, pointing south. At (6.5+.3, 0), which is near the center-right, labeled y, pointing straight south. At (5 + 0.5, -1.5 + 0.3), which is near the bottom, labeled y, pointing north.

So, in total, there are three x marks and three y marks. So, perhaps angle BAD is trisected into three x angles, and angle CDA is trisected into three y angles. So, angle BAD is 3x, angle CDA is 3y.

Given that, I can perhaps find x and y.

But in the figure, they've labeled specific angles: 110 degrees and 100 degrees. Hmm, perhaps those are angles at points E and F, or perhaps at points B and C.

Wait, the Asymptote code draws A--E--D and A--F--D, so E is connected to D, and F is connected to D. So, the figure has two triangles inside: triangle AED and triangle AFD.

Moreover, in the figure, the angles at E and F are marked with x and y.

Wait, maybe the angles at E and F are trisection points? Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the angles at point A and D are being trisected, so the angles between BA and AE is x, between AE and AD is x. Similarly, at point D, between CD and DF is y, and between DF and DA is y.

So, given that, we can say that angle BAD is 3x, and angle ADC is 3y.

Given that, perhaps we can find x and y by using the other given angles in the figure.

But in the Asymptote code, they've labeled two specific angles: 110 degrees at (2.5,3.5), which is near the top, and 100 degrees at (6.5 - 0.2, 3.5), near the bottom. So, perhaps angle ABC is 110 degrees and angle BCD is 100 degrees? Let me check.

Point B is at (2,4), connected to C at (7,4). So, angle at B is between AB and BC. Similarly, angle at C is between BC and CD.

But wait, if BC is horizontal from (2,4) to (7,4), then angle at B is the angle between AB and BC. AB is from A(0,0) to B(2,4), which is a line going up and to the right. BC is going to the right horizontally. So, angle at B is the angle between AB and BC, which is given as 110 degrees.

Similarly, angle at C is between BC and CD. CD is from C(7,4) to D(7,-2), which is straight down. So, angle at C is between BC and CD, which is given as 100 degrees.

So, angle ABC is 110 degrees, angle BCD is 100 degrees.

Therefore, in quadrilateral ABCD, we have two angles given: angle at B is 110 degrees, angle at C is 100 degrees. The other two angles are at A and D. So, angle BAD is 3x, angle ADC is 3y. So, in a quadrilateral, the sum of all interior angles is 360 degrees.

Therefore, angle BAD + angle ABC + angle BCD + angle ADC = 360.

So, 3x + 110 + 100 + 3y = 360.

Simplify: 3x + 3y + 210 = 360.

Therefore, 3x + 3y = 150.

Divide both sides by 3: x + y = 50.

So, x + y = 50 degrees.

That's one equation.

Now, perhaps we can find another equation involving x and y by looking at triangle AFD.

Wait, but let me see. Since E and F are points where the trisection lines meet, maybe we can find some relationships in the triangles.

Looking at point A, which is connected to E and F. So, from A, we have lines AE and AF, which trisect angle BAD into three angles of x each. Similarly, from D, we have lines DF and DE, which trisect angle ADC into three angles of y each.

So, in triangle AED, angle at A is x, angle at D is y, and angle at E is something.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at A is x, angle at D is y, and angle at F is what we need to find.

Wait, but maybe that's not correct because point F is connected to E as well? Wait, no, according to the Asymptote code, A is connected to E and to F, and F is connected to D. So, A-E-D and A-F-D.

So, E is on BD? Wait, no, E is connected to D. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, E is connected to D, so E is somewhere inside the quadrilateral.

Wait, perhaps triangles AED and AFD share point A and D, but E and F are different points.

Alternatively, maybe triangles AED and AFD are connected through point A and D.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of using trigonometric Ceva's theorem because we have cevians trisecting the angles.

Wait, Ceva's theorem relates to concurrent cevians in a triangle, but here we're dealing with a quadrilateral. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the quadrilateral as two triangles by drawing a diagonal, say AC or BD.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn as A-B-C-D-A, so the quadrilateral is defined without crossing lines.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider triangles ABE and AED, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to focus on triangle AFD.

In triangle AFD, we have angle at A is x, angle at D is y, and the angle at F is angle AFD, which is what we need to find.

So, in triangle AFD, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So, x + y + angle AFD = 180.

Therefore, angle AFD = 180 - x - y.

But we already have x + y = 50. So, angle AFD = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees? Wait, is that right?

Wait, but hold on. Is triangle AFD a triangle? Let me confirm.

Point A is connected to F, and F is connected to D. So, yes, AFD is a triangle.

But is angle at A in triangle AFD equal to x? Hmm, let me think.

At point A, angle BAD is being trisected into three angles, each of measure x. So, from BA to AE is x, from AE to AD is x. So, if we have a point F somewhere inside the quadrilateral, connected to A and D, then angle at A in triangle AFD is the angle between AF and AD.

Wait, but AF is not necessarily aligned with AE. So, maybe angle at A in triangle AFD is not x or 2x or something.

Hmm, so perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, so angle BAD is 3x, which is the angle between BA and DA. So, from BA to DA, it's 3x. But AF is another line from A, somewhere between BA and DA.

Similarly, at point D, angle ADC is 3y, the angle between CD and DA. DF is another line from D, somewhere between CD and DA.

So, in triangle AFD, angle at A is between AF and AD, which is some portion of angle BAD. Similarly, angle at D is between DF and DA, which is some portion of angle ADC.

Wait, but I think I need to model this with more precision.

Perhaps, using the trisection, angle BAD is 3x, so each trisection angle is x. So, from BA, the first trisection is x, so line AE makes an angle x from BA. Similarly, line AF is another trisection, making another x from AE, so angle between BA and AE is x, between AE and AF is x, and between AF and AD is x.

Wait, no, wait. If it's trisected into three equal angles, then angle BAD is 3x, so each trisection is x. So, starting from BA, the first trisection is x, so from BA to AE is x, then from AE to AF is another x, and from AF to AD is another x. Wait, but AF is connected to F, which is connected to D.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

If angle BAD is trisected, then from BA, there are two lines that split angle BAD into three equal parts. So, starting from BA, first line is at x, then at 2x from BA, which would be the direction of AF? Or is it?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of cevians. So, from point A, the two trisectors divide angle BAD into three equal angles of x each. Similarly, from point D, the two trisectors divide angle ADC into three equal angles of y each.

Therefore, from A, we have two lines: one making angle x with BA, and another making angle x from the first line, so the second trisector is at 2x from BA.

Similarly, from D, we have two lines: one making angle y with DC, and another making angle y from the first line, so the second trisector is at 2y from DC.

Therefore, in the figure, point E is where the first trisector from A meets BD, and point F is where the second trisector from A meets DC? Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing A-E-D and A-F-D.

So, E is connected to D, and F is connected to D. So, lines from A to E and A to F, both connected to D.

Therefore, E is on BD? Wait, no, because E is at (4.5 - 0.2, 1 - 0.2), which is around (4.3, 0.8). If BD is from B(2,4) to D(7,-2), then point E is somewhere along BD? Let me check if (4.3, 0.8) is on BD.

The line BD can be parametrized as starting at (2,4) and going to (7,-2). The parametric equations would be x = 2 + 5t, y = 4 - 6t, where t goes from 0 to 1.

So, if I set x=4.3, then t=(4.3 - 2)/5 = 2.3/5 = 0.46. Then y should be 4 - 6*(0.46) = 4 - 2.76 = 1.24. But E is at (4.3, 0.8), which is different. So, E is not on BD.

Similarly, F is at (5,3). Let's see if that's on BD. x=5, so t=(5 - 2)/5 = 0.6. Then y should be 4 - 6*0.6 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4. But F is at (5,3), which is above that. So, F is not on BD either.

Therefore, E and F are points inside the quadrilateral connected from A and D. So, lines AE and AF are cevians from A, and lines DE and DF are cevians from D.

So, in this case, perhaps we can apply Ceva's theorem in triangle ABD or something else.

Wait, Ceva's theorem is applicable in a triangle when three cevians are concurrent. But here, in quadrilateral ABCD, we have two triangles: ABD and BCD. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe we can model this with two triangles: triangle ABD and triangle CBD.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to consider triangle ABD with cevians AE and AF. Hmm, but Ceva's theorem requires three cevians for concurrency. Maybe not directly applicable.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangles AED and AFD.

Wait, let's consider triangle AED. In triangle AED, we have angle at A is x, angle at D is y, and angle at E is 180 - x - y.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, we have angle at A is x', angle at D is y', and angle at F is 180 - x' - y'.

But wait, unless we can relate x' and y' to x and y.

Wait, perhaps the key is to note that the angles at E and F are given as x and y? Wait, no, the Asymptote code labels the angles as x and y, but I'm not sure exactly which angles.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, they have:

label("$x$", (1, 1.5), S); label("$x$", (2, 1), S+W); label("$x$", (2, -1), N+N+N+W);

So, three x labels at (1,1.5), (2,1), and (2,-1). Similarly, y labels at (5.5+.3, .5-.3), (6.5+.3, 0), and (5+.5, -1.5+.3).

So, perhaps the angles at E and F are trisected as well, but in the figure, the angles at E and F are labeled with x and y.

Wait, maybe angles at E and F are also trisected? Hmm, not necessarily. Maybe the angles at A and D are trisected.

Wait, perhaps the lines AE and AF trisect angle BAD, so angles between BA and AE is x, between AE and AF is x, and between AF and AD is x. Similarly, lines DF and DE trisect angle ADC into three angles of y each.

Therefore, from A, the angles between BA and AE, AE and AF, AF and AD are all x.

From D, the angles between CD and DF, DF and DE, DE and DA are all y.

Therefore, angles at A and D are trisected, each into three equal parts.

So, angle BAD is 3x, angle ADC is 3y.

We already have that 3x + 3y + 110 + 100 = 360, so x + y = 50.

Therefore, angle AFD in triangle AFD is 180 - (angle at A in AFD + angle at D in AFD).

But we need to figure out what angle at A in AFD is and angle at D in AFD is.

Wait, angle at A in triangle AFD is the angle between AF and AD. Since AF is one of the trisectors, the angle between AF and AD is 2x, because from BA to AF is 2x, and from AF to AD is another x. So, wait, no.

Wait, if angle BAD is 3x, and AF is the second trisector, then angle between BA and AF is 2x, and between AF and AD is x.

Wait, but in triangle AFD, the angle at A is between AF and AD, which is x. Similarly, at D, the angle is between DF and DA, which is y.

Wait, so in triangle AFD, angle at A is x, angle at D is y, so angle at F is 180 - x - y, which is 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. So, is that the answer? 130 degrees?

But wait, before jumping to conclusion, let me verify.

Wait, if angle BAD is 3x, and AF is the second trisector, then angle between BA and AF is 2x, and angle between AF and AD is x. So, in triangle AFD, the angle at A is between AF and AD, which is x, angle at D is between DF and DA, which is y.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, the sum of angles is x + y + angle AFD = 180.

So, angle AFD = 180 - x - y. Since x + y = 50, angle AFD = 130 degrees.

So, is the measure of angle AFD 130 degrees?

Wait, but let me cross-verify this because sometimes these diagrams can be tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the angles at E and F. The Asymptote code labels the angles at E and F as x and y, but perhaps those are different.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, angle labels are at (1,1.5), (2,1), (2,-1), which are near the left side, middle, and bottom. Similarly, y labels are near the right side.

Wait, perhaps those are angles at points E and F.

Wait, in triangle AED, angle at E is labeled x, and in triangle AFD, angle at F is labeled y? Or maybe not.

Wait, the labels are placed at specific coordinates, so perhaps the angles at E and F are each labeled with x and y.

But point E is connected to A and D, so in triangle AED, the angles at E are labeled x. Similarly, point F is connected to A and D, so in triangle AFD, the angles at F are labeled y.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, labels are given as:

label("$x$", (1, 1.5), S); label("$x$", (2, 1), S+W); label("$x$", (2, -1), N+N+N+W);

label("$y$", (5.5+.3, .5-.3), S); label("$y$", (6.5+.3, 0)); label("$y$", (5+.5, -1.5+.3));

So, for x, three labels: one near (1,1.5), which is left side, one near (2,1), which is near point B, and one near (2,-1), which is near point C.

For y, three labels: one near (5.5+.3, .5-.3), which is near the right side, one at (6.5+.3, 0), which is near point C, and one at (5+.5, -1.5+.3), which is near the bottom.

So, perhaps these are angles at points E and F, but it's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the angles at E and F are x and y. So, angle at E is x, angle at F is y.

But in triangle AED, angle at E is x, angle at A is x, so triangle AED has two angles x, so it's an isosceles triangle? Wait, no, unless sides are equal.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, in triangle AFD, angle at F is y, angle at D is y, so triangle AFD is also isosceles? Hmm.

Wait, this is getting confusing because without seeing the exact figure, it's hard to pinpoint.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me consider the sum of angles in quadrilateral ABCD.

Quadrilateral angles sum to 360 degrees. We have angle at B is 110 degrees, angle at C is 100 degrees, angles at A and D are 3x and 3y respectively.

So, 3x + 3y + 110 + 100 = 360 => 3x + 3y = 150 => x + y = 50.

So, angle AFD is 180 - x - y = 130 degrees.

But wait, before I accept that, let me think again.

In triangle AFD, are the angles at A and D equal to x and y?

Well, if AF is the second trisector from A, then angle between BA and AF is 2x, and angle between AF and AD is x. So, in triangle AFD, the angle at A is x, as it's between AF and AD.

Similarly, if DF is the second trisector from D, then angle between CD and DF is 2y, and angle between DF and DA is y. So, in triangle AFD, the angle at D is y, as it's between DF and DA.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are x and y, so angle AFD is 180 - x - y = 130 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of angle AFD is 130 degrees.

Wait, but let me check if that makes sense. If angle AFD is 130 degrees, which is quite large. Given that, in the Asymptote code, they've drawn lines from A to E and A to F, and from D to E and D to F, forming triangles inside.

Given that angle at B is 110 degrees and angle at C is 100 degrees, which are both larger than angle AFD. So, angle AFD is 130, which is in between.

Alternatively, maybe I made an incorrect assumption.

Wait, perhaps the angle at A in triangle AFD is not x, but 2x, because AF is the second trisector.

Wait, angle BAD is 3x, so from BA to AD is 3x. If AF is the second trisector, then the angle from BA to AF is 2x, and from AF to AD is x.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, the angle at A is x, the angle at D is y, and angle AFD is 180 - x - y = 130 degrees.

But wait, in triangle AFD, is the angle at D equal to y?

Wait, angle ADC is 3y, which is the angle at D between CD and DA.

If DF is the second trisector from D, then the angle between CD and DF is 2y, and between DF and DA is y.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, the angle at D is between DF and DA, which is y.

So, yes, in triangle AFD, angles at A and D are x and y, respectively, so angle AFD is 130 degrees.

But wait, let me think about this again.

In triangle AFD, the angle at A is between AF and AD. Since AF is the second trisector, the angle between BA and AF is 2x, and between AF and AD is x. Therefore, the angle at A is x.

Similarly, at D, the angle between DF and DA is y, so the angle at D is y.

Therefore, triangle AFD has angles x, y, and 180 - x - y, which is 130.

Therefore, angle AFD is 130 degrees.

Wait, but I also have other angles given in the figure, 110 and 100 degrees, at points B and C.

Is there a way to verify if angle AFD is 130 degrees?

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangles AED and AFD.

Wait, let me consider triangle AED.

In triangle AED, angle at A is x, angle at D is y, and angle at E is 180 - x - y.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at A is x, angle at D is y, angle at F is 130 degrees.

But maybe we can relate sides.

But without knowing side lengths, it's hard to compute exact lengths.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles in quadrilateral is 360, and we already used that to get x + y = 50.

Therefore, based on that, angle AFD is 130 degrees.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, they've also labeled 110 and 100 degrees at points (2.5, 3.5) and (6.5 - 0.2, 3.5). So, perhaps those are angles at E and F.

So, angle at E is 110 degrees, and angle at F is 100 degrees.

Wait, if that's the case, then in triangle AED, angle at E is 110 degrees, angle at A is x, angle at D is y. So, x + y + 110 = 180 => x + y = 70.

But earlier, we had x + y = 50. So, that contradicts.

Alternatively, maybe angle at E is 110 degrees, which is different from the trisection angles.

Wait, this is getting more confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the Asymptote code is labeling the angles at points E and F as 110 and 100, but those are not the trisection angles.

But then, if angle at E is 110 degrees, which is different from x, then we cannot directly use that.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles at E and F are also being trisected, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps it's better to go back.

Given that angle ABC is 110 degrees, angle BCD is 100 degrees, angles at A and D are 3x and 3y, summing to 150.

Therefore, x + y = 50.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, angle AFD = 180 - x - y = 130 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of angle AFD is 130 degrees.

I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{130}
</think>

In quadrilateral \(ABCD\), angles \(BAD\) and \(CDA\) are trisected. The given angles are \(110^\circ\) at point \(B\) and \(100^\circ\) at point \(C\). We need to find the measure of angle \(AFD\).

1. **Identify the trisected angles**:
   - Angle \(BAD\) is trisected into three equal parts, each of measure \(x\). Therefore, \(BAD = 3x\).
   - Angle \(CDA\) is trisected into three equal parts, each of measure \(y\). Therefore, \(CDA = 3y\).

2. **Sum of angles in quadrilateral \(ABCD\)**:
   - The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).
   - Given angles at \(B\) and \(C\) are \(110^\circ\) and \(100^\circ\) respectively.
   - Therefore, \(3x + 3y + 110^\circ + 100^\circ = 360^\circ\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(3x + 3y = 150^\circ\), which leads to \(x + y = 50^\circ\).

3. **Determine the measure of angle \(AFD\)**:
   - In triangle \(AFD\), the angles at \(A\) and \(D\) are \(x\) and \(y\) respectively.
   - The sum of the angles in triangle \(AFD\) is \(180^\circ\).
   - Therefore, angle \(AFD = 180^\circ - x - y\).
   - Substituting \(x + y = 50^\circ\), we get angle \(AFD = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ\).

Thus, the degree measure of angle \(AFD\) is \(\boxed{130}\).
