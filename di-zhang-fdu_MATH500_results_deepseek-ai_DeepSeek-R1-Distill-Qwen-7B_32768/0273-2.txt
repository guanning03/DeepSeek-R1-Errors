Question:
A figure skater is facing north when she begins to spin to her right. She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?

Correct Answer:
Each full circle is 360 degrees.  Dividing 360 into 2250 gives a quotient of 6 with a remainder of 90.  So, she spins 90 degrees to her right past north, which leaves her facing $\boxed{\text{east}}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here about a figure skater spinning and ending up in a certain direction. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the skater starts facing north and spins to her right 2250 degrees. I need to find out which direction she's facing after that spin. Alright, let's break it down.

First off, figure skaters spin around their own center, right? So, when they spin, they rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise. In this case, she's spinning to her right, which means it's a clockwise rotation. Got that.

Now, directions. She starts facing north. If she spins clockwise, her direction will change in a specific way. Let me recall the order of directions when moving clockwise: north, east, south, west, and then back to north. It's like a circle, so every 90 degrees is a quarter turn. So, each 90 degrees is a right angle turn.

But the problem says she spins 2250 degrees. That's a lot! 2250 is a big number, so I probably need to figure out how many full rotations she does and then see the remaining angle to figure out the final direction.

Wait, a full rotation is 360 degrees, right? So, if she spins 2250 degrees, how many full spins is that? Let me divide 2250 by 360. Hmm, 2250 divided by 360. Let me calculate that.

2250 divided by 360. Let's see, 360 times 6 is 2160, because 360 times 5 is 1800, and 360 more is 2160. So, 2160 is 6 full rotations. Then, 2250 minus 2160 is 90 degrees. So, she does 6 full rotations and then an additional 90 degrees. So, the extra 90 degrees is what determines her final direction.

Since she started facing north and spins clockwise, each quarter turn is 90 degrees. So, starting from north, a 90-degree clockwise spin would take her to east. Let me confirm: north to east is 90 degrees clockwise. Then, another 90 degrees would take her to south, and another 90 to west, and another 90 back to north. So, 90 degrees is a quarter turn.

Wait, so if she spins an extra 90 degrees beyond the 6 full rotations, she would end up facing east. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as total degrees modulo 360, since after full rotations, the direction repeats every 360 degrees. So, 2250 divided by 360 is 6 with a remainder. So, 6 times 360 is 2160, right? 2250 minus 2160 is indeed 90 degrees. So, the effective rotation is 90 degrees clockwise.

Starting from north, 90 degrees clockwise is east. So, she ends up facing east. Hmm, seems straightforward.

But wait, just to be thorough, let's visualize it. Imagine the skater starting facing north. If she spins 90 degrees clockwise, she faces east. If she spins 180 degrees, she faces south. 270 degrees, she faces west. And 360 brings her back to north. So, 90 degrees is a quarter turn, which is exactly the case here.

Therefore, after spinning 2250 degrees, which is equivalent to 6 full rotations plus 90 degrees, she ends up facing east.

But hold on, did I consider the direction correctly? She spins to her right, which is clockwise, so yes, it's a positive rotation in the clockwise direction. So, 90 degrees clockwise from north is east.

Is there any chance that I could have miscounted the number of full rotations? Let me check that again. 2250 divided by 360. So, 360 times 6 is 2160, as I said. 2250 minus 2160 is 90. So, that's correct. So, 6 full rotations plus 90 degrees.

Wait another thought: is 2250 degrees a lot? So, 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25, meaning 6 full rotations and a quarter of a rotation. Since a quarter of a rotation is 90 degrees, so yeah, that's consistent.

So, 6 full rotations don't change her direction because they bring her back to the starting point, right? So, 6 times 360 is 2160, which is a multiple of 360, so no net rotation from that. Then, the remaining 90 degrees is the effective rotation.

So, 90 degrees clockwise from north is east, so she faces east.

Wait, another angle: sometimes people think of 0 degrees as north, 90 as east, 180 as south, 270 as west, and then 360 back to north. So, if we take 2250 modulo 360, as I did, 2250 divided by 360 is 6, remainder 90. So, 90 degrees, which is east.

Alternatively, if I don't use modulo, but think of the rotations in terms of multiples of 90 degrees. Each 90 degrees is a quarter turn. So, 2250 divided by 90 is 25. So, 25 quarter turns.

Each quarter turn is 90 degrees, so 25 of those. Now, 25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1. So, 6 full rotations (24 quarter turns) and 1 extra quarter turn. So, 1 quarter turn is 90 degrees. So, again, 90 degrees clockwise from north is east.

Same answer.

Alternatively, if I think of the direction changes. Starting at north, each 90 degrees clockwise is as follows:

- 0 degrees: north
- 90 degrees: east
- 180 degrees: south
- 270 degrees: west
- 360 degrees: north

So, since 2250 divided by 360 is 6 with a remainder of 90, which is one step from north, which is east.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of reference angles. 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25, so that's 6 full circles and a quarter circle. So, the reference angle is 90 degrees.

So, since she's moving clockwise, it's 90 degrees from north, which is east.

Wait, but let me make sure I don't confuse clockwise with counterclockwise. Because sometimes, in math, angles are measured counterclockwise, but in this case, since she's spinning to her right, which is clockwise, so it's a positive angle in the clockwise direction.

So, positive angles in math are usually counterclockwise, but here, it's a positive rotation in the clockwise direction. So, maybe that's why we have to be careful.

But in any case, 2250 degrees is the total rotation, so whether it's positive or negative, but in this case, it's a positive rotation in the clockwise direction.

So, regardless of the sign convention, 2250 degrees is 6 full rotations plus 90 degrees, so 90 degrees in the clockwise direction from north is east.

So, putting it all together, starting at north, spinning 2250 degrees clockwise, which is 6 full circles and a quarter turn, so she ends up facing east.

Wait, just to make sure, let me visualize it on my fingers. Imagine I'm facing north. If I turn to my right, that's clockwise. So, turning 90 degrees to my right is east. Turning another 90 is south, another 90 is west, another 90 is back to north. So, 90 is east, 180 is south, 270 is west, 360 is north, and so on.

So, each 90 is a quarter turn, either north, east, south, west, or north again.

So, 2250 divided by 90 is 25. So, 25 quarter turns. Each four quarter turns is a full circle.

25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1. So, 6 full circles (24 quarter turns) and 1 quarter turn. So, 1 quarter turn from north is east.

Therefore, after 2250 degrees, she's facing east.

Wait, if I think of it as turning around on my own body. If I start facing north and turn to my right, I face east. Then, if I turn again to my right, I face south, and so on.

So, 2250 degrees is a lot, but the key is that after every 360, she's back to the starting point, so 2250 is just 6 full circles plus 90, so she's turned 90 degrees from north, which is east.

I think that's solid. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the answer should be east.

**Final Answer**
The figure skater is facing \boxed{E} when she finishes her spin.
</think>

The figure skater starts facing north and spins 2250 degrees to her right (clockwise). To determine her final direction, we need to consider the effective rotation after full circles.

1. **Convert total degrees to effective rotation:**
   - 2250 degrees divided by 360 degrees (a full rotation) gives a quotient of 6 and a remainder of 90 degrees.
   - This means 2250 degrees is equivalent to 6 full rotations (2160 degrees) plus an additional 90 degrees.

2. **Determine the direction after the effective rotation:**
   - The remainder of 90 degrees is the effective rotation beyond the full circles.
   - Starting from north, a 90-degree clockwise rotation brings the skater to east.

Thus, the figure skater is facing \boxed{E} when she finishes her spin.
