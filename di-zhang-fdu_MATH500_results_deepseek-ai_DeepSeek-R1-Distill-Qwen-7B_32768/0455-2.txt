Correct Answer:
Since $PT$ and $RQ$ are parallel, then $2x^\circ=128^\circ,$ so $x=64,$ so $\angle TPQ=64^\circ.$

[/asy]

Since $PT$ and $QR$ are parallel, then $\angle TPQ$ and $\angle PQR$ are supplementary. Thus, $\angle PQR + 64^\circ = 180^\circ,$ so $\angle PQR = \boxed{116} \text{ degrees}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says that PT is parallel to QR, and I need to find the measure of angle PQR. Hmm, let me see. I think I should start by understanding the diagram and labeling all the given information.

First, the Asymptote code draws some lines. I can imagine it's a bit complex, but let me break it down. There are two lines drawn from (0,0) to (-7,10) and (0,0) to (7,10), which probably form the sides of a triangle or something. Then, it connects (10,0) to (20,0), which is another line. The labels are given: "x°" at (-6,10), "2x°" at (7,10), and "128°" at (10,0). The points are labeled P, T, R, and Q.

Wait, so PT is parallel to QR. That probably means that PT and QR are two lines that never meet, right? So, maybe PT is like the top part of the figure, and QR is the base? Let me try to visualize it.

Looking at the coordinates, P is at (-7,10), T is at (7,10), so PT is a horizontal line at y=10, stretching from x=-7 to x=7. Then, QR is from (0,0) to (10,0), which is another horizontal line at y=0, stretching from x=0 to x=10. So, yes, PT is parallel to QR because both are horizontal lines, so they have the same slope, which is zero.

Okay, cool. So, PT || QR. That must mean that the figure is some sort of trapezoid, right? Because a trapezoid has two sides that are parallel. But looking at the Asymptote code, it draws lines from (0,0) to (-7,10) and (0,0) to (7,10), so maybe it's a trapezoid with vertices at P, Q, R, and T? So, P(-7,10), Q(0,0), R(10,0), T(7,10). So, PQ is from (-7,10) to (0,0), QR is from (0,0) to (10,0), RT is from (10,0) to (7,10), and TP is from (7,10) to (-7,10). Hmm, that makes sense.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawn as (0,0)--(10,0), then (10,0)--(20,0), which is probably just an extension, but the main figure is from (0,0) to (-7,10) and (7,10). So, maybe the figure is more like a triangle on top of a trapezoid? I think I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me try to just focus on the angles. The diagram has two angles labeled: one at (-6,10) which is x°, and another at (7,10) which is 2x°. So, those must be angles at points P and T? Wait, but P is at (-7,10), so maybe the angle at P is x°, and the angle at T is 2x°. Hmm, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing lines from Q(0,0) to P(-7,10) and Q(0,0) to T(7,10). So, Q is connected to both P and T, forming two lines from Q to the top.

So, maybe the figure is a triangle QPT? But wait, no, because PT is a separate line. Wait, actually, looking again, the figure is drawn as (0,0)--(-7,10)--(7,10)--(10,0), so it's a quadrilateral with vertices at Q(0,0), P(-7,10), T(7,10), and R(10,0). So, it's a four-sided figure.

Since PT is parallel to QR, which are the top and bottom sides, this is a trapezoid. So, we have a trapezoid QPTR, with bases PT and QR. The legs are PQ and TR.

Now, in trapezoids, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. That is, angle P + angle R = 180°, and angle Q + angle T = 180°, if the sides are the legs. Wait, but in this case, the angles given are at P and T, which are both on the top and bottom? Wait, no, P is on the top base, and T is also on the top base. Q is on the bottom base, and R is on the bottom base.

Wait, maybe I need to think about this differently. Since PT is parallel to QR, the angles formed by the transversal lines PQ and TR should be related. So, maybe we can use the properties of parallel lines cut by transversals.

Looking at the diagram, angles at P and Q are on the same side, so they are consecutive interior angles, which should add up to 180°. Similarly, angles at T and R are consecutive interior angles and should also add up to 180°. But wait, in the Asymptote code, the angle at (10,0) is labeled as 128°, which is angle Q in the figure. Hmm, so angle Q is 128°, which is at the bottom right corner.

Wait, so maybe angle Q is 128°, and since PT is parallel to QR, angle Q and angle P should be supplementary? Because they are on the same side, the same side angles in a trapezoid are supplementary if the sides are parallel.

Wait, angle Q is 128°, so angle P should be 180° - 128° = 52°. But angle P is given as x°, so x = 52°, which would make angle T, which is 2x°, equal to 104°.

But wait, in the problem, it's asking for angle PQR, which is angle at Q. Wait, hold on, angle PQR is the angle at Q, which is given as 128°. But that's confusing because in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as 128° at (10,0), which is point R, not Q. Wait, let me check the labels again.

The Asymptote code labels "128°" at (10,0), which is point R, and labels "x°" at (-6,10), which is near point P, and "2x°" at (7,10), which is near point T.

So, angle at P is x°, angle at T is 2x°, and angle at R is 128°. So, angle PQR is the angle at Q, which is not directly given. Hmm, maybe I misread.

Wait, the problem says, "What is the measure of angle PQR in degrees?" So, angle at Q, which is at point Q(0,0). So, in the diagram, that's the angle between segments QP and QR.

So, in the figure, Q is connected to P and R. So, angle PQR is the angle at Q between QP and QR. So, that's the angle we need to find.

Given that, we have some angles labeled: at point P, angle is x°, at point T, angle is 2x°, and at point R, angle is 128°. Hmm, so maybe we need to use triangle properties or something.

Since PT is parallel to QR, and we have transversals PQ and TR, maybe the angles at P and R are related.

Wait, so in the trapezoid QPTR, with bases PT and QR.

In a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. So, angle P + angle R = 180°, angle Q + angle T = 180°.

But angle R is given as 128°, so angle P would be 180° - 128° = 52°, which is x°, so x = 52°, and angle T is 2x°, so 104°. So, that's angle at T.

But then, what about angle Q? Since angle Q and angle T are consecutive angles on the same side, they should also add up to 180°, so angle Q is 180° - angle T = 180° - 104° = 76°. So, angle Q is 76°, which is angle PQR.

Wait, so is that the answer? 76°? Let me double-check.

So, in trapezoid QPTR, angle P = x = 52°, angle R = 128°, angle T = 2x = 104°, so angle Q must be 76°, since consecutive angles on the same side are supplementary.

But hold on, angle Q is at point Q, which is connected to points P and R. So, in the trapezoid, angle Q is between sides QP and QR.

Alternatively, maybe I should look at triangle PQR or something else.

Wait, let me think again. The Asymptote code draws (0,0)--(-7,10)--(7,10)--(10,0), so that's points Q(0,0), P(-7,10), T(7,10), R(10,0). So, connecting these, we have the trapezoid QPTR with bases PT and QR.

So, in trapezoid QPTR, the sides are QP, PT, TR, and RQ.

Since PT || QR, and the legs are QP and TR.

So, in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. So, angle P + angle Q = 180°, and angle T + angle R = 180°.

Wait, but angle P is at point P, which is connected to Q and T. So, angle P is between QP and PT, and angle Q is between QP and QR.

So, angle P and angle Q are adjacent angles at point P and Q, but they are not on the same side.

Wait, maybe I got the wrong property. Let me recall: in a trapezoid, each pair of angles on the same leg are supplementary.

So, for leg QP, the angles at P and Q are on the same leg, so angle P + angle Q = 180°. Similarly, for leg TR, the angles at T and R are on the same leg, so angle T + angle R = 180°.

So, if that's the case, then angle P + angle Q = 180°, and angle T + angle R = 180°.

Given that, angle P is x°, angle T is 2x°, angle R is 128°, so:

From angle T + angle R = 180°, we have 2x + 128 = 180.

So, 2x = 180 - 128 = 52°, so x = 26°.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion where angle P was 52°, which would mean x = 52°. But according to this, x is 26°, so angle P is 26°, angle T is 52°, angle R is 128°, so angle Q is 180 - angle P = 180 - 26 = 154°.

But that seems conflicting because the Asymptote code labels angle at (10,0) as 128°, which is angle R, and angle at (0,0) as something else.

Wait, hold on, maybe I confused the angles.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, the labels are:

- "x^{\circ}" at (-6,10), which is near point P.

- "2x^{\circ}" at (7,10), which is near point T.

- "128^{\circ}" at (10,0), which is point R.

So, in the figure, angle at P is x°, angle at T is 2x°, angle at R is 128°, and angle at Q is something else.

So, in the trapezoid, the angles at P and Q are on the same side (leg QP), so they should add up to 180°, right? So, angle P + angle Q = 180°.

Similarly, angles at T and R are on the same side (leg TR), so angle T + angle R = 180°, as before.

Given angle R is 128°, so angle T would be 180 - 128 = 52°, which is 2x°, so 2x = 52°, so x = 26°, which is angle P.

Therefore, angle Q is 180 - angle P = 180 - 26 = 154°.

But wait, that seems a bit high, but maybe that's correct.

But let me double-check because sometimes in geometry, depending on the diagram, the angles can be inside or outside.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing the lines as (0,0)--(-7,10)--(7,10)--(10,0), so the trapezoid is not symmetric. So, point R is at (10,0), so it's further along the x-axis.

So, maybe the angle at Q is actually an internal angle of the trapezoid, but if you look at the diagram, point Q is connected to P and R, so angle PQR is the angle at Q between QP and QR.

So, if angle Q is 154°, that's a reflex angle? Wait, no, 154° is just obtuse.

Wait, but in the diagram, if I imagine the trapezoid with the given angles, maybe 154° is correct.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing lines from Q(0,0) to P(-7,10) and Q(0,0) to T(7,10), so maybe angle at Q is actually composed of two angles: one between QP and QR, and another between QR and QT. Hmm, but no, wait, in the trapezoid, the angle at Q is just one angle between QP and QR.

But in reality, in the figure, angle PQR is the internal angle at Q, which is 180° minus angle Q's external part.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider triangle PQR. Wait, but in the figure, it's a trapezoid, not a triangle. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: since PT is parallel to QR, and we have lines QP and TR as transversals.

So, angle at P (x°) and angle at R (128°) are on the same side, so they should be supplementary if they are same-side interior angles.

Wait, so x + 128 = 180°, so x = 52°. Then, angle at T is 2x = 104°, which is supplementary with angle R, 128°, because 104 + 128 = 232°, which is not 180°. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, maybe I messed up. So, in the trapezoid, same-side interior angles add up to 180°, so angle P and angle R are same-side interior angles across the transversal PR? Wait, no, PR is not a transversal.

Wait, maybe the transversals are QP and TR.

So, for transversal QP crossing the parallel lines PT and QR, the angles at P and Q are same-side interior angles. So, angle P and angle Q should add up to 180°. Similarly, transversal TR crossing the parallel lines PT and QR, angles at T and R should add up to 180°.

So, that would mean:

Angle P + angle Q = 180°

Angle T + angle R = 180°

Given that, angle P is x°, angle R is 128°, so angle T is 180 - 128 = 52°, which is 2x°, so x = 26°, then angle Q is 180 - x = 180 - 26 = 154°.

So, according to this, angle PQR is 154°, which is the angle at Q.

But wait, when I think of a trapezoid with angle R as 128°, which is quite a large angle, so angle T would be 52°, which is smaller. Then, angle P is 26°, which is even smaller, and angle Q is 154°, which is larger. Hmm, that seems inconsistent because usually, in a trapezoid, the angles adjacent to each base are supplementary.

Wait, but if the trapezoid is not symmetric, then the angles can differ.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider triangle PQR, but in reality, it's a trapezoid. So, maybe we can split the trapezoid into triangles.

Wait, if I draw a diagonal from Q to T, then the trapezoid is split into two triangles: QPT and QTR.

In triangle QPT, we have angle at P is x°, angle at T is 2x°, and angle at Q is something else.

Wait, but angle at Q in triangle QPT is not the same as angle PQR in the trapezoid.

Wait, maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that PT is parallel to QR and the angles formed by the transversal QP.

So, angle at P (x°) and angle at Q would be same-side interior angles, so x + angle Q = 180°, so angle Q = 180 - x°.

But we also have angle at T (2x°) and angle at R (128°), which are same-side interior angles on the other side, so 2x + 128 = 180°, so 2x = 52°, so x = 26°, so angle Q = 180 - 26 = 154°, which is consistent with what we had before.

So, angle PQR is 154°, which is the angle at Q.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing the angle at (10,0) as 128°, which is angle R. So, the figure must have angle R as 128°, which is inside the trapezoid.

So, if I think of the trapezoid QPTR, with bases QR and PT, and legs QP and TR.

So, angle at R is 128°, which is between base QR and leg TR.

Similarly, angle at P is x°, which is between base PT and leg QP.

Since PT || QR, the consecutive angles on each leg should be supplementary.

So, angle at P and angle at Q (on leg QP) should add up to 180°, same with angle at T and angle at R (on leg TR) adding up to 180°.

So, in that case, angle Q is 180 - x°, and angle T is 180 - 128 = 52°, which is 2x°, so 2x = 52, x = 26, so angle Q is 154°, which is 180 - 26 = 154°.

So, that seems consistent.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, the angle at (10,0) is labeled as 128°, which is angle R, and the angle at (-6,10) is labeled as x°, which is near point P, and (7,10) is labeled as 2x° near point T.

So, according to the labels, the angles at P and T are x° and 2x°, which are on the top base PT.

Wait, so perhaps angle P is x°, angle T is 2x°, and since PT is parallel to QR, the angles at Q and R are on the other base.

So, in that case, angle Q and angle R are supplementary to angle P and angle T respectively.

So, angle Q = 180 - angle P = 180 - x

angle R = 180 - angle T = 180 - 2x

But in the problem, angle R is given as 128°, so 180 - 2x = 128

So, 180 - 128 = 2x

52 = 2x

x = 26

Therefore, angle Q is 180 - x = 180 - 26 = 154°

So, angle PQR is 154°.

Wait, that's the same conclusion as before.

But the Asymptote code labels the angle at (10,0) as 128°, which is angle R, and angles at P and T as x° and 2x°, so that's consistent.

Therefore, angle PQR is 154°, so the measure is 154 degrees.

But wait, hold on, in the Asymptote code, the angle at (10,0) is labeled as 128°, which is angle R, which is on the base QR.

So, in the trapezoid, angle R is 128°, which is adjacent to the leg TR.

So, if I think about the angles at the base QR, angle R is 128°, so the angle at Q on the base QR would be supplementary to angle T.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the triangle.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle QPR.

Wait, hold on, maybe I should use the fact that the sum of the interior angles in a quadrilateral is 360°.

So, in trapezoid QPTR, the sum of all angles is 360°.

So, angle P + angle Q + angle R + angle T = 360°

Given that, we have:

angle P = x°, angle R = 128°, angle T = 2x°, so angle Q = ?

So, x + angle Q + 128 + 2x = 360

So, 3x + angle Q + 128 = 360

So, angle Q = 360 - 3x - 128 = 232 - 3x

But also, from the property that same-side interior angles are supplementary:

angle P + angle Q = 180°, so x + angle Q = 180 => angle Q = 180 - x

Similarly, angle T + angle R = 180°, so 2x + 128 = 180 => 2x = 52 => x = 26

Therefore, angle Q = 180 - x = 154°, as before.

So, substituting back into the quadrilateral angle sum:

x + angle Q + 128 + 2x = 360

26 + 154 + 128 + 52 = 360

Wait, 26 + 154 is 180, 128 + 52 is 180, so 180 + 180 = 360. Correct.

So, that's consistent.

Therefore, angle PQR is 154°, so the measure is 154 degrees.

But wait, is 154° a reasonable measure? In the Asymptote code, the angle at (10,0) is 128°, which is quite large, so angle at Q is 154°, which is even larger, but that's okay because they are on different sides.

Wait, but in the diagram, angle at Q is between QP and QR, which is a larger angle, while angle at R is 128°, which is also a large angle.

So, in the trapezoid, the two base angles on the lower base QR are 154° and 128°, which add up to 282°, but wait, that's not possible because in a trapezoid, each pair of same-side interior angles should add up to 180°.

Wait, hold on, angle at Q and angle at R are not same-side interior angles.

Wait, same-side interior angles are angle P and angle R, and angle T and angle Q.

Wait, angle P and angle R are on the same side, so they should add up to 180°, which they do: 26 + 128 = 154, which is not 180. Wait, that doesn't add up.

Wait, angle P is 26°, angle R is 128°, which adds up to 154°, which is not 180°. That's a problem.

Wait, this inconsistency is making me doubt my previous conclusion.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the same-side interior angles.

Wait, in a trapezoid, same-side interior angles are the angles on the same side of a leg, so for leg PR, the angles at P and R are same-side interior angles, so they should add up to 180°, but 26 + 128 = 154 ≠ 180.

Similarly, for leg QT, angles at Q and T should add up to 180°, which is 154 + 52 = 206 ≠ 180.

Wait, that's a problem. So, my previous conclusion is wrong.

Wait, so maybe the same-side interior angles are not angle P and R, but angle P and angle Q?

Wait, no, angle P and angle Q are adjacent at point Q, not same-side interior.

Wait, maybe I have a different pair of same-side interior angles.

Wait, perhaps in the trapezoid, the same-side interior angles are angle P and angle Q, and angle T and angle R.

But, angle P is 26°, angle Q is 154°, so 26 + 154 = 180°, which is correct.

Similarly, angle T is 52°, angle R is 128°, so 52 + 128 = 180°, which is correct.

So, same-side interior angles add up to 180°, so that works.

So, in that case, angle P (26°) and angle Q (154°) are same-side interior angles on one leg, adding up to 180°, and angle T (52°) and angle R (128°) are same-side interior angles on the other leg, adding up to 180°.

Therefore, my initial conclusion was correct.

So, angle PQR is 154°, which is angle at Q.

So, despite the sum of angles at P and R not being 180°, but the same-side interior angles are angle P and Q, and angle T and R.

Therefore, the measure of angle PQR is 154 degrees.

Wait, but let me just make sure.

So, if angle P is 26°, then angle Q is 154°, which is supplementary to angle P.

Similarly, angle T is 52°, so angle R is 128°, which is supplementary to angle T.

So, in the trapezoid, consecutive angles on each leg are supplementary, which is a property of trapezoids.

Thus, everything checks out.

Therefore, angle PQR is 154°, so the measure is 154 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The measure of $\angle PQR$ is $\boxed{154}$ degrees.
</think>

Given that \(PT\) is parallel to \(QR\), we need to find the measure of \(\angle PQR\).

1. **Identify the given angles**:
   - Angle at \(P\) is \(x^\circ\).
   - Angle at \(T\) is \(2x^\circ\).
   - Angle at \(R\) is \(128^\circ\).

2. **Use the property of same-side interior angles**:
   - Since \(PT \parallel QR\), the same-side interior angles on the same leg should add up to \(180^\circ\).
   - For leg \(TR\), angles at \(T\) and \(R\) are supplementary:
     \[
     2x + 128 = 180
     \]
     Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     2x = 52 \implies x = 26
     \]

3. **Find the measure of angle at \(P\)**:
   - Angle at \(P\) is \(x = 26^\circ\).

4. **Use the property of same-side interior angles on the other leg**:
   - For leg \(QP\), angles at \(P\) and \(Q\) are supplementary:
     \[
     x + \angle PQR = 180
     \]
     Substituting \(x = 26\):
     \[
     26 + \angle PQR = 180 \implies \angle PQR = 154
     \]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle PQR\) is \(\boxed{154}\) degrees.
