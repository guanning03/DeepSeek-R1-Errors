Question:
Bob and Alice each have a bag that contains one ball of each of the colors,  blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob then randomly selects one ball from his bag and  puts it into Alice's bag. What is the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same?

Correct Answer:
After Alice puts the ball into Bob's bag, his bag will contain six balls: two of one color and one of each of the other colors. After Bob selects a ball and places it into Alice's bag, the two bags will have the same contents if and only if Bob picked one of the two balls in his bag that are the same color. Because there are six balls in the bag when Bob makes his selection, the probability of selecting one of the same colored pair is $2/6=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Gold:
\frac{1}{3}

Wrong Prediction:
\frac{1}{6}

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this probability problem here involving Bob and Alice each having a bag with balls of five different colors: blue, green, orange, red, and violet. The process is that Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Then Bob randomly selects one ball from his bag and puts it into Alice's bag. The question is asking for the probability that after this process, the contents of the two bags are the same.

Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. First, both Alice and Bob initially have one ball of each color. So, each of their bags has 5 balls: blue, green, orange, red, and violet.

Now, Alice is going to pick one ball at random from her bag and move it to Bob's bag. Since all balls are unique in color, each ball has an equal probability of being picked. So, the probability of Alice picking any specific color is 1/5.

After Alice transfers a ball to Bob's bag, Bob's bag now has 6 balls instead of 5, right? Similarly, Alice's bag now has only 4 balls. Then, Bob is going to pick one ball at random from his bag (which now has 6 balls) and transfer it back to Alice's bag.

After both transfers, we need to find the probability that both Alice's and Bob's bags have the same set of balls as they did initially. Wait, actually, no. Wait, are they just checking if the contents are the same, regardless of the order or anything? Or do they have to be exactly the same, including the counts? But since all balls are unique, it's just about having the exact same set.

But, wait, initially, both had 5 balls. After the transfers, Alice has 4 balls, and Bob has 6 balls. So, for their contents to be the same, Alice would have to have 5 balls in her bag, but she only has 4. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Wait, actually, maybe not. Wait, hold on. Let me think.

Wait, no. After Alice moves a ball to Bob's bag, Alice has 4 balls, Bob has 6. Then Bob moves a ball back to Alice's bag, so Alice goes back to 5 balls, and Bob goes back to 5 balls. So, after both transfers, both have 5 balls again. So, the question is whether the contents of the two bags are the same as they were initially.

Wait, but they started with the same contents. So, the question is, after this exchange, do the two bags have the same set of balls as they did before? That is, is the net result that no net transfer has happened? Or, in other words, is the ball that Alice moved back to Bob's bag the same as the one Bob moved back to Alice's bag?

Wait, actually, maybe not. Wait, let me think. Let's suppose that Alice first moves a ball, say blue, to Bob's bag. Then Bob has 6 balls: his original 5 plus the blue one from Alice. Then Bob randomly selects one to send back to Alice. The probability that he selects blue again is 1/6, but the probability that he selects a different color is 5/6. So, if he selects blue, then the net result is that Alice still has her original set, and Bob also has his original set. But if he selects another color, then Alice's bag now has a different set, and Bob's bag has a different set.

Wait, so the only way that both bags end up with the same contents as they started is if the same color that Alice moved to Bob's bag is the same one that Bob moves back to Alice's bag.

So, in other words, for the two bags to end up with the same contents as initially, the ball that Alice moved must be the same one that Bob moved back.

Therefore, the probability we're looking for is the probability that the ball Alice moved to Bob's bag is the same one that Bob moves back to Alice's bag.

So, the key is to compute the probability that the two transferred balls are the same.

Let me formalize this a bit. Let's denote the colors as B (blue), G (green), O (orange), R (red), V (violet). Alice has one of each color. She picks one uniformly at random, say color X. She puts X into Bob's bag. Now, Bob has his original 5 colors plus X, so 6 colors. Then Bob picks one uniformly at random to put back into Alice's bag. The probability that Bob picks X is 1/6, since there is only one X among the 6 balls.

So, the probability that the two transferred balls are the same is 1/6, because regardless of which color Alice picked, the chance that Bob picks the same color is 1/6.

But wait, is that all? Because the question is about the probability that the contents of both bags are the same. So, if the same color is transferred in both directions, then yes, the bags would be the same as they started. If different colors are transferred, then the bags would have different contents.

Therefore, the probability that the two bags end up with the same contents is equal to the probability that Alice and Bob transferred the same color.

Since Alice's transfer is completely random, and Bob's transfer is also completely random, the probability is the probability that Bob picks the same color that Alice picked.

So, the probability is 1/6, as above.

Wait, but let me think again. Is that all? Or is there something else?

Wait, actually, maybe another way to think about it is that, regardless of which color Alice picks, the probability that Bob picks the same color is 1/6. So, the probability is 1/6.

But perhaps this is oversimplified? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a permutation. Let's think of all possible transfers.

First, Alice can send any of the 5 colors to Bob. Then, Bob, seeing that color, can send back any of the 6 colors (his original 5 plus the one from Alice). So, the total number of possible transfer sequences is 5 (choices for Alice) multiplied by 6 (choices for Bob), giving 30 possible outcomes.

Now, how many of these outcomes result in the original configuration? That is, Alice sends a color X to Bob, and Bob sends color X back to Alice. So, for each color X, there is one such outcome: Alice sends X, Bob sends X. So, since there are 5 colors, there are 5 such favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the probability is 5 / 30 = 1/6. So, same as before.

Therefore, the probability is 1/6.

But wait, just to make sure, let's think of it in terms of expected value or maybe conditional probability.

Alternatively, let's compute the probability step by step.

First, Alice picks a color uniformly at random. The probability distribution for her pick is uniform over the 5 colors, each with probability 1/5.

Then, Bob has 6 balls: his original 5 plus the one Alice sent. He picks one uniformly at random, so each of the 6 balls has a probability of 1/6.

We want the probability that the ball Bob picks is the same as the one Alice sent.

So, the probability is the sum over all colors of the probability that Alice sent that color times the probability that Bob sent that color.

Mathematically, this is:

P = Î£ [P(Alice sends color X) * P(Bob sends color X)] for X in {B, G, O, R, V}

Since each color X has P(Alice sends X) = 1/5, and given that, P(Bob sends X) = 1/6 (since he picks uniformly among 6 balls, one of which is X).

Therefore, P = 5 * [ (1/5) * (1/6) ) ] = 5 * (1/30) = 1/6.

So, same result.

Alternatively, thinking about it in terms of expected number of fixed points or something else.

Wait, maybe another approach: Let's consider the entire process.

After Alice sends a ball to Bob, Bob's bag has 6 balls: 5 original plus 1 from Alice. Then Bob sends one back.

For the two bags to end up with the same contents, the net effect is that the ball Alice sent is the same one Bob sent back.

Therefore, the problem reduces to the probability that a randomly chosen ball by Alice is the same as a randomly chosen ball by Bob from his augmented set.

Thus, the probability is 1/6.

Alternatively, perhaps considering it as a probability of matching.

But just to make sure, let's think of all possible pairs.

When Alice sends a ball, there are 5 possibilities. For each, Bob has 6 choices. So, 5*6=30 possible combinations.

Out of these, how many result in the same ball being sent back?

For each color, there is one case where Alice sends that color and Bob sends that color. So, 5 cases.

Therefore, 5/30=1/6.

So, yes, 1/6.

Alternatively, another way: Suppose we fix the color that Alice sends. Let's say she sends blue. Then Bob has a 1/6 chance of sending blue back. Similarly, if Alice sends green, Bob has 1/6 chance of sending green back, etc. Since all colors are equally likely, the overall probability is 1/6.

Therefore, I think 1/6 is the correct answer.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about a specific example.

Suppose Alice sends blue to Bob. Now, Bob has 6 balls: B, G, O, R, V, and the blue from Alice. Then, Bob has a 1/6 chance to send blue back, which would mean that Alice's bag goes back to having G, O, R, V, and Bob's bag goes back to having G, O, R, V, B. So, same as original.

If Bob sends any other color, say green, back to Alice, then Alice's bag becomes B, O, R, V, and Bob's bag becomes G, O, R, V, and the one from Alice, which is B. So, Alice has B, O, R, V, and Bob has B, O, R, V, G. So, clearly different.

Therefore, only when Bob sends back the same color that Alice sent does the exchange result in the original configuration.

Since Bob has a 1/6 chance of sending back the same color, regardless of which color Alice sent, the probability is 1/6.

Therefore, the answer is 1/6.

**Final Answer**
The probability that the contents of the two bags are the same after the process is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.
</think>

Alice and Bob each have a bag containing one ball of each color: blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob then randomly selects one ball from his bag and puts it into Alice's bag. We need to find the probability that the contents of the two bags are the same after this process.

1. Initially, both Alice and Bob have 5 balls each.
2. Alice transfers one ball to Bob's bag, resulting in Alice having 4 balls and Bob having 6 balls.
3. Bob then transfers one ball back to Alice's bag, resulting in both having 5 balls each again.
4. For the contents of the two bags to be the same, the ball Alice transferred must be the same one Bob transfers back.

The probability that Bob transfers the same ball back to Alice is calculated as follows:
- Alice transfers a ball, say color \(X\), to Bob's bag.
- Bob has 6 balls in his bag, one of which is \(X\). The probability Bob transfers \(X\) back is \(\frac{1}{6}\).

Since this probability is the same regardless of which color Alice initially transferred, the overall probability is \(\frac{1}{6}\).

Thus, the probability that the contents of the two bags are the same is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}\).
