Question:
What is the shortest distance that can be travelled if you start at any point, $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$, and visit the other three points once?

[asy]
pair A,B,C, D;
A = (-3,3); B = (3,0); C = (0, -4); D = (0,0);
draw(D--B--C--cycle); draw(D--A--B--cycle);draw(D--A--C--cycle);
label("$A$", A, NW);label("$B$", B, E); label("$C$", C, S);label("$D$", D, NE);
label("3", D--B, S); label("6", A--B, NE); label("6", A--C, SW); label("4", D--C, NW+N);
label("5", A--D, SE+NE); label("5", C--B, E);
[/asy]

Correct Answer:
To visit all four points, we notice that we must travel along at least three different segments. The sum of the shortest three segments is $3+4+5=12$, but we quickly notice that it is impossible to start at one point and visit the other three points by traveling on a path with length $12$ ($DB$, $BC$, and $CD$ do not let us visit point $A$, and it is not possible to travel on $AD$, $CD$, and $BD$ in a continuous path). We now look for a path with length $13$ and notice that traveling from point $A$ to $D$ to $B$ to $C$ works. Alternatively, $B$ to $D$ to $C$ to $A$ also works. Both paths have length $\boxed{13}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any of the points A, B, C, or D, and then visiting the other three points once. It kind of sounds like a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where I have to visit each city exactly once and return to the starting point, but since the problem doesn't specify returning, maybe it's just a path that visits each once without necessarily returning? Hmm, the question says "visit the other three points once," so maybe it's just a path that starts at one point and goes through the other three without coming back. 

First, I should probably figure out the distances between each pair of points because the Asymptote code gives me the coordinates. Let me note down the coordinates:

- Point A is at (-3, 3)
- Point B is at (3, 0)
- Point C is at (0, -4)
- Point D is at (0, 0)

So, D is the origin, which might make some calculations easier.

The Asymptote code also labels the distances between some points:

- D to B is 3 units
- A to B is 6 units
- A to C is 6 units
- D to C is 4 units
- A to D is 5 units
- C to B is 5 units

Wait, so some distances are given directly, but maybe I can calculate others using the coordinates to verify or to fill in missing distances.

Let me calculate the distances between all pairs using the distance formula, just to have a complete picture.

The distance formula is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2].

First, let me compute AB, which is already given as 6 units.

Calculating AB:

A(-3,3) to B(3,0):

sqrt[(3 - (-3))^2 + (0 - 3)^2] = sqrt[(6)^2 + (-3)^2] = sqrt[36 + 9] = sqrt[45] = 3*sqrt(5) ≈ 6.708 units.

Wait, but the Asymptote code says AB is 6 units. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Maybe the coordinates are scaled or something? Or perhaps the Asymptote drawing is just approximate.

Wait, let me double-check. If A is at (-3,3) and B is at (3,0), then the distance should be sqrt[(6)^2 + (-3)^2] = sqrt[36 + 9] = sqrt[45] ≈ 6.708, not 6. So, maybe the labels in the Asymptote code are approximate? Or perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, (3 - (-3)) is 6, (0 - 3) is -3, so sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2) is sqrt(45). That's about 6.708, as I thought. So the label of 6 might be approximate or maybe it's a different scaling.

Similarly, let's check AC:

A(-3,3) to C(0,-4):

sqrt[(0 - (-3))^2 + (-4 - 3)^2] = sqrt[(3)^2 + (-7)^2] = sqrt[9 + 49] = sqrt[58] ≈ 7.616 units.

But the Asymptote code says AC is 6 units. Hmm, that's another discrepancy. Similarly, AD:

A(-3,3) to D(0,0):

sqrt[(0 - (-3))^2 + (0 - 3)^2] = sqrt[9 + 9] = sqrt[18] ≈ 4.242 units.

But the Asymptote code labels AD as 5 units. Hmm.

Similarly, DC is from D(0,0) to C(0,-4):

sqrt[(0 - 0)^2 + (-4 - 0)^2] = sqrt[0 + 16] = 4 units. That's correct as per the Asymptote label.

DB is from D(0,0) to B(3,0):

sqrt[(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = sqrt[9 + 0] = 3 units. Correct per the Asymptote label.

CB is from C(0,-4) to B(3,0):

sqrt[(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - (-4))^2] = sqrt[9 + 16] = sqrt[25] = 5 units. Correct per Asymptote label.

So, the distances in the Asymptote code are:

- AB: 6 (but actual distance is ~6.708)
- AC: 6 (actual ~7.616)
- AD: 5 (actual ~4.242)
- DB: 3
- DC: 4
- CB: 5

So, the Asymptote code is not matching the actual distances between the points as per their coordinates. Therefore, perhaps I should just use the coordinates to compute the actual distances, rather than relying on the Asymptote labels, because the labels might be misleading or approximate.

So, let's note down the actual distances:

From the coordinates:

AB: sqrt[(6)^2 + (−3)^2] = sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708

AC: sqrt[(3)^2 + (−7)^2] = sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616

AD: sqrt[(3)^2 + (−3)^2] = sqrt(18) ≈ 4.242

BC: 5

BD: 3

CD: 4

Also, I can calculate the other distances:

BA: same as AB: sqrt(45)

CA: same as AC: sqrt(58)

DB: same as BD: 3

CB: same as BC: 5

CD: same as DC: 4

DA: same as AD: sqrt(18)

So, there are some distances missing, but maybe I can compute them if needed.

But perhaps I can use the coordinates to compute all the necessary distances, so that I can have exact values instead of approximate ones. So, let me note all the distances:

AB: sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708

AC: sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616

AD: sqrt(18) ≈ 4.242

BC: 5

BD: 3

CD: 4

So, now, I need to find the shortest possible path that starts at one of the points A, B, C, D and visits the other three points exactly once.

This is a TSP on four points, but since it's small, perhaps I can enumerate all possible paths and compute their total distances, then pick the smallest one.

But before that, maybe I can think if there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of the traveling salesman path, which is similar to the TSP, but without returning to the origin. So, the minimum path length that visits all four points starting from any of them.

Given that, perhaps the way is to compute all possible permutations of the other three points starting from each of the four points, compute the total distance for each permutation, and then find the minimum.

But since there are 4 starting points, and for each, 3! = 6 permutations of the other three points, so total 4 x 6 = 24 possible paths.

This is manageable, but maybe time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the minimal spanning tree or something, but for exact solution, maybe enumeration is better.

Alternatively, perhaps using the nearest neighbor heuristic, but that might not give the exact minimum.

Wait, but since this is a small graph, with four nodes, I can calculate all possible paths.

But let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me note the distances:

From A:

- To B: sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708

- To C: sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616

- To D: sqrt(18) ≈ 4.242

From B:

- To A: sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708

- To C: 5

- To D: 3

From C:

- To A: sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616

- To B: 5

- To D: 4

From D:

- To A: sqrt(18) ≈ 4.242

- To B: 3

- To C: 4

So, now, for each starting point, I need to consider all possible orders of visiting the other three points.

Let me consider starting from each point one by one.

Starting from A:

Possible paths:

1. A -> B -> C -> D

2. A -> B -> D -> C

3. A -> C -> B -> D

4. A -> C -> D -> B

5. A -> D -> B -> C

6. A -> D -> C -> B

Similarly, starting from B:

1. B -> A -> C -> D

2. B -> A -> D -> C

3. B -> C -> A -> D

4. B -> C -> D -> A

5. B -> D -> A -> C

6. B -> D -> C -> A

Starting from C:

1. C -> A -> B -> D

2. C -> A -> D -> B

3. C -> B -> A -> D

4. C -> B -> D -> A

5. C -> D -> A -> B

6. C -> D -> B -> A

Starting from D:

1. D -> A -> B -> C

2. D -> A -> C -> B

3. D -> B -> A -> C

4. D -> B -> C -> A

5. D -> C -> A -> B

6. D -> C -> B -> A

So, each starting point has 6 possible paths. To compute the total distance for each, we can calculate the sum of the distances for each segment.

But since this is a lot, maybe I can look for the minimal path by considering the closest neighbors first.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the minimal path is likely to involve going from the closest points first.

Alternatively, since from each point, the closest point is D (distance ~4.242 from A, distance 3 from B, distance 4 from C, distance sqrt(18) from D). Wait, so D is the closest to A, B, and C, except for itself.

Wait, for D, the closest is B (distance 3), then C (4), then A (sqrt(18) ≈ 4.242). For A, the closest is D (sqrt(18)), then B (sqrt(45)), then C (sqrt(58)). For B, closest is D (3), then C (5), then A (sqrt(45)). For C, closest is D (4), then B (5), then A (sqrt(58)).

So, perhaps starting from D, going to B first, then from B to C, then from C to A? Let me check that path.

Alternatively, starting from D, path D -> B -> C -> A.

Compute the distances:

D to B: 3

B to C: 5

C to A: sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616

Total distance: 3 + 5 + 7.616 ≈ 15.616

Alternatively, D -> C -> B -> A:

D to C: 4

C to B: 5

B to A: sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708

Total: 4 + 5 + 6.708 ≈ 15.708

Alternatively, D -> B -> A -> C:

D to B: 3

B to A: sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708

A to C: sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616

Total: 3 + 6.708 + 7.616 ≈ 17.324

Alternatively, D -> A -> B -> C:

D to A: sqrt(18) ≈ 4.242

A to B: sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708

B to C: 5

Total: 4.242 + 6.708 + 5 ≈ 15.95

Alternatively, D -> A -> C -> B:

D to A: sqrt(18) ≈ 4.242

A to C: sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616

C to B: 5

Total: 4.242 + 7.616 + 5 ≈ 16.858

Alternatively, D -> C -> A -> B:

D to C: 4

C to A: sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616

A to B: sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708

Total: 4 + 7.616 + 6.708 ≈ 18.324

So, among all these, the minimal path starting from D is D -> B -> C -> A with total distance ≈15.616.

Alternatively, let's check starting from A.

From A, the closest is D (sqrt(18) ≈4.242), then B (sqrt(45)≈6.708), then C (sqrt(58)≈7.616).

So, let's try the path A->D->B->C.

Compute distances:

A to D: sqrt(18)≈4.242

D to B: 3

B to C:5

Total: 4.242 + 3 + 5 ≈12.242

Alternatively, A->D->C->B.

A to D: sqrt(18)≈4.242

D to C:4

C to B:5

Total: 4.242 +4 +5 ≈13.242

Alternatively, A->B->D->C.

A to B: sqrt(45)≈6.708

B to D:3

D to C:4

Total: 6.708 +3 +4≈13.708

Alternatively, A->B->C->D.

A to B: sqrt(45)≈6.708

B to C:5

C to D:4

Total: 6.708 +5 +4≈15.708

Alternatively, A->C->D->B.

A to C: sqrt(58)≈7.616

C to D:4

D to B:3

Total:7.616 +4 +3≈14.616

Alternatively, A->C->B->D.

A to C: sqrt(58)≈7.616

C to B:5

B to D:3

Total:7.616 +5 +3≈15.616

So, among these, the minimal path starting from A is A->D->B->C with total distance ≈12.242.

Wait, that's pretty short.

Let me check if that's correct.

Wait, from A to D is sqrt(18)=approximately 4.242.

From D to B is 3.

From B to C is 5.

So, 4.242 +3 +5≈12.242.

Is that the minimal?

Alternatively, is there a shorter path?

Wait, let me see.

Alternatively, starting from A, maybe going A->D->C->B.

That's 4.242 +4 +5=13.242, which is longer.

Alternatively, A->B->D->C: 6.708 +3 +4≈13.708, which is longer.

So, indeed, A->D->B->C is the shortest starting from A, with total distance≈12.242.

Now, starting from B.

From B, the closest is D (3), then C (5), then A (sqrt(45)≈6.708).

So, trying the path B->D->C->A.

Compute:

B to D:3

D to C:4

C to A:sqrt(58)≈7.616

Total:3 +4 +7.616≈14.616

Alternatively, B->D->A->C.

B to D:3

D to A:sqrt(18)≈4.242

A to C:sqrt(58)≈7.616

Total:3 +4.242 +7.616≈14.858

Alternatively, B->C->D->A.

B to C:5

C to D:4

D to A:sqrt(18)≈4.242

Total:5 +4 +4.242≈13.242

Alternatively, B->C->A->D.

B to C:5

C to A:sqrt(58)≈7.616

A to D:sqrt(18)≈4.242

Total≈5 +7.616 +4.242≈16.858

Alternatively, B->A->D->C.

B to A:sqrt(45)≈6.708

A to D:sqrt(18)≈4.242

D to C:4

Total≈6.708 +4.242 +4≈14.95

Alternatively, B->A->C->D.

B to A:sqrt(45)≈6.708

A to C:sqrt(58)≈7.616

C to D:4

Total≈6.708 +7.616 +4≈18.324

So, the minimal path starting from B is B->C->D->A with total≈13.242.

Wait, is that correct?

From B to C:5

From C to D:4

From D to A:sqrt(18)≈4.242

Wait, 5+4+4.242=13.242.

Alternatively, is there a shorter path?

If I go from B->D->A->C, that's 3 +4.242 +7.616≈14.858, which is longer.

So, yes, B->C->D->A is the shortest starting from B, with total≈13.242.

Now, starting from C.

From C, the closest is D (4), then B (5), then A (sqrt(58)≈7.616).

So, let's try the path C->D->B->A.

Compute:

C to D:4

D to B:3

B to A:sqrt(45)≈6.708

Total:4 +3 +6.708≈13.708

Alternatively, C->D->A->B.

C to D:4

D to A:sqrt(18)≈4.242

A to B:sqrt(45)≈6.708

Total≈4 +4.242 +6.708≈14.95

Alternatively, C->B->D->A.

C to B:5

B to D:3

D to A:sqrt(18)≈4.242

Total≈5 +3 +4.242≈12.242

Alternatively, C->B->A->D.

C to B:5

B to A:sqrt(45)≈6.708

A to D:sqrt(18)≈4.242

Total≈5 +6.708 +4.242≈15.95

Alternatively, C->A->D->B.

C to A:sqrt(58)≈7.616

A to D:sqrt(18)≈4.242

D to B:3

Total≈7.616 +4.242 +3≈14.858

Alternatively, C->A->B->D.

C to A:sqrt(58)≈7.616

A to B:sqrt(45)≈6.708

B to D:3

Total≈7.616 +6.708 +3≈17.324

So, the minimal path starting from C is C->B->D->A with total≈12.242.

That's the same as the minimal path starting from A, I think.

Wait, 12.242 comes from C->B->D->A? Let me check:

C to B:5

B to D:3

D to A:sqrt(18)≈4.242

So, 5+3+4.242≈12.242.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, starting from D.

From D, the closest is B (3), then C (4), then A (sqrt(18)≈4.242).

So, let's try the path D->B->C->A.

Compute:

D to B:3

B to C:5

C to A:sqrt(58)≈7.616

Total≈3 +5 +7.616≈15.616

Alternatively, D->B->A->C.

D to B:3

B to A:sqrt(45)≈6.708

A to C:sqrt(58)≈7.616

Total≈3 +6.708 +7.616≈17.324

Alternatively, D->C->B->A.

D to C:4

C to B:5

B to A:sqrt(45)≈6.708

Total≈4 +5 +6.708≈15.708

Alternatively, D->C->A->B.

D to C:4

C to A:sqrt(58)≈7.616

A to B:sqrt(45)≈6.708

Total≈4 +7.616 +6.708≈18.324

Alternatively, D->A->B->C.

D to A:sqrt(18)≈4.242

A to B:sqrt(45)≈6.708

B to C:5

Total≈4.242 +6.708 +5≈15.95

Alternatively, D->A->C->B.

D to A:sqrt(18)≈4.242

A to C:sqrt(58)≈7.616

C to B:5

Total≈4.242 +7.616 +5≈16.858

So, the minimal path starting from D is D->B->C->A with total≈15.616.

Wait, but hold on, is there a shorter path?

Wait, starting from D, the first step is to the closest point, which is B (distance 3). Then from B, the next closest is C (distance 5). Then from C, the next is A (distance sqrt(58)≈7.616). So, that gives total≈15.616.

Alternatively, is there a better path?

Wait, what if I go D->A->B->C? Let's compute that distance.

D to A:sqrt(18)≈4.242

A to B:sqrt(45)≈6.708

B to C:5

Total≈4.242 +6.708 +5≈15.95

Which is longer than 15.616.

Alternatively, D->B->A->C.

D to B:3

B to A:sqrt(45)≈6.708

A to C:sqrt(58)≈7.616

Total≈3 +6.708 +7.616≈17.324

So, no, that's longer.

Alternatively, D->C->B->A.

D to C:4

C to B:5

B to A:sqrt(45)≈6.708

Total≈4 +5 +6.708≈15.708

Which is longer than 15.616.

Alternatively, D->B->C->A is still the shortest, with≈15.616.

Wait, but when starting from A, we had a total distance of≈12.242, which is less than 15.616.

So, so far, the minimal distances starting from each point:

- A:≈12.242 (A->D->B->C)

- B:≈13.242 (B->C->D->A)

- C:≈12.242 (C->B->D->A)

- D:≈15.616 (D->B->C->A)

So, the minimal overall is≈12.242, achieved both starting from A and starting from C.

Wait, is there a path starting from A that is shorter than≈12.242?

Wait, when starting from A, the minimal path is A->D->B->C, which is≈12.242.

Is there a path starting from another point that is shorter?

Wait, for example, starting from B, the minimal is≈13.242, which is longer.

Starting from C,≈12.242.

Starting from D,≈15.616.

So, the minimal is≈12.242.

But let's check if that's correct.

Wait, A->D->B->C: A to D is sqrt(18), which is approx 4.242, then D to B is 3, then B to C is5.

So, total≈4.242 +3 +5≈12.242.

Alternatively, is there a path starting from C that is shorter?

Wait, C->B->D->A: C to B is5, B to D is3, D to A is sqrt(18)≈4.242. So, total≈5 +3 +4.242≈12.242.

Same as starting from A.

Is that the minimal? Or is there a path with a total distance less than≈12.242?

Wait, let's think of another path.

Suppose starting from A, going to D, then to C, then to B: A->D->C->B.

Distance: sqrt(18) +4 +5≈4.242 +4 +5≈13.242.

Which is longer than 12.242.

Alternatively, starting from A, going to D, then to B, then to C: A->D->B->C: which is≈12.242.

Alternatively, starting from A, going to B, then to D, then to C: A->B->D->C:≈6.708 +3 +4≈13.708.

Alternatively, starting from A, going to C, then to D, then to B: A->C->D->B:≈7.616 +4 +3≈14.616.

Alternatively, starting from A, going to C, then to B, then to D: A->C->B->D:≈7.616 +5 +3≈15.616.

So, indeed, A->D->B->C is the shortest.

Similarly, C->B->D->A is another shortest path.

So, both of those total≈12.242.

But wait, 12.242 is approximately sqrt(18) +3 +5, which is sqrt(18)≈4.242 +3 +5≈12.242.

But is there a path that is shorter?

Wait, perhaps starting from A, going to D, then to B, then to C: as above.

Alternatively, is there a way to have a path that goes through all four points with a shorter distance?

Wait, let's see. The minimal spanning tree might help here, but since we need a path, not just a tree.

Wait, but in any case, given the distances, the shortest path is≈12.242.

But wait, is 12.242 the exact distance?

Wait, because sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2), which is exactly 4.24264...

So, exact value is 3*sqrt(2) +3 +5.

So, 3*sqrt(2) +8≈4.2426 +8≈12.2426.

So, exact value is 8 +3*sqrt(2).

Is there a way to get a shorter total distance?

Wait, let me see.

Is there a way to rearrange the order of the points to make the total distance shorter?

Wait, perhaps starting from A, going to D, then to C, then to B? Wait, that's 13.242.

Alternatively, starting from A, going to D, then to B, then to C: 12.242.

Alternatively, is there a way to go from A to B to C to D? Let me compute that:

A to B: sqrt(45)≈6.708

B to C:5

C to D:4

Total≈6.708 +5 +4≈15.708.

Alternatively, A to C, C to D, D to B:≈7.616 +4 +3≈14.616.

Alternatively, A to D, D to C, C to B:≈4.242 +4 +5≈13.242.

Alternatively, A to D, D to B, B to C:≈4.242 +3 +5≈12.242.

So, that's the minimal.

Is there a way to traverse all four points with a total distance less than 8 +3*sqrt(2)?

Wait, let me think about another path.

Wait, what if I go A->D->C->B, but that's 13.242.

Alternatively, A->B->C->D:≈15.708.

No, that's longer.

Alternatively, starting from B, going to C, then to D, then to A:≈13.242.

Alternatively, starting from C, going to B, then to D, then to A:≈12.242.

So, the minimal is≈12.242, which is≈8 +3*sqrt(2).

Alternatively, let me think if there's a way to have a shorter path.

Wait, from A to D is sqrt(18), then D to B is3, then B to C is5. So, total is sqrt(18)+3+5.

Alternatively, is there a way to rearrange the path so that I can get a shorter total.

Wait, for example, from A to D is sqrt(18), which is≈4.242, then D to A is sqrt(18), but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, from A to D, then from D to B, then from B to C: which is the same path.

Alternatively, from A to D, then D to C, then C to B: which is longer.

So, maybe 12.242 is indeed the minimal.

Wait, but let's think about another path: starting from A, going to D, then to B, then to C, as we have.

Alternatively, is there a way to make a path that goes through A, D, B, C, with total distance sqrt(18)+3+5≈12.242.

Alternatively, is there a way to have a path that connects A, D, B, C in a different order with a shorter total.

Wait, for example, A->D->B->C: which is the same as above.

Alternatively, is there a path that goes through A, D, C, B: but that's longer.

Alternatively, is there a way to have a path that goes through A, B, D, C, but that's longer.

Alternatively, starting from A, going to B, then to D, then to C:≈6.708 +3 +4≈13.708.

So, no, that's longer.

So, indeed, the minimal path is≈12.242.

But let me think if that's the minimal.

Wait, is sqrt(18) +3 +5 the minimal? Or is there a combination that gives a shorter total distance?

Wait, sqrt(18) is about4.242, 3 is 3, 5 is5.

Alternatively, if I can find a way to have a path that has two shorter edges.

Wait, but starting from A, I have to go to D first because D is the closest.

Alternatively, starting from A, going to D, then from D, the closest is B (distance3), then from B, the closest is C (distance5). So, that's the path.

Alternatively, is there a way to go from D to C first? So, from A->D, then D->C (4), then from C->B (5), then back? Wait, no, because we need to visit each point once.

Wait, no, we can't revisit points. So, starting from A->D->C->B is allowed, but the total is≈13.242, which is longer.

So, no, better to go A->D->B->C.

So, the minimal total distance is≈12.242.

So, in exact terms, that's 3*sqrt(2) +8.

Because sqrt(18)=3*sqrt(2), so 3*sqrt(2) +8.

So, 8 +3*sqrt(2). That's an exact value.

But let me confirm if that's indeed the minimal.

Alternatively, is there a better path?

Wait, perhaps if we use a different order.

Wait, for instance, starting from A, going to D, then to B, then to C: which is≈12.242.

Alternatively, starting from A, going to D, then to C, then to B:≈13.242.

Alternatively, starting from A, going to B, then to D, then to C:≈13.708.

Alternatively, starting from A, going to C, then to B, then to D:≈15.616.

So, the minimal is indeed≈12.242.

Therefore, the minimal total distance is 8 +3*sqrt(2).

But let me check if 8 +3*sqrt(2) is correct.

Because the path is A->D (sqrt(18)=3*sqrt(2)), D->B (3), B->C (5). So, total is 3*sqrt(2) +3 +5=8 +3*sqrt(2).

Yes, correct.

Alternatively, in another path, starting from C, going to B (5), then to D (3), then to A (sqrt(18)=3*sqrt(2)).

Total is same:5 +3 +3*sqrt(2)=8 +3*sqrt(2).

So, same total.

Therefore, the minimal total distance is 8 +3*sqrt(2). Which is approximately12.242.

But let me make sure that no other path can have a shorter total distance.

Wait, for example, is there a path where instead of going from D to B, we go from D to C, but then we still have to go to B and C.

Wait, but D to C is4, which is longer than D to B, which is3. So, going D->B first is better.

Similarly, from B, we have to go to C, which is5, or from B, we have other options.

But in the path A->D->B->C, we have already taken the minimal distances.

So, I think that's the minimal.

Wait, but let me think differently.

Suppose starting from A, going to D, then to C, then to B.

Wait, that's A->D:3*sqrt(2)≈4.242, D->C:4, C->B:5.

Total≈13.242, which is longer.

Alternatively, starting from A, going to D, then to B, then to C:≈12.242.

Alternatively, starting from D, going to B, then to C, then to A:≈15.616.

So, no, the minimal is≈12.242.

Alternatively, is there a way to have a path that goes through all four points with a total distance less than≈12.242?

Wait, for example, is there a path that goes A->B->D->C, but that's≈6.708 +3 +4≈13.708.

Alternatively, A->C->B->D:≈7.616 +5 +3≈15.616.

Alternatively, A->B->C->D:≈6.708 +5 +4≈15.708.

Alternatively, A->C->D->B:≈7.616 +4 +3≈14.616.

Alternatively, A->D->C->B:≈4.242 +4 +5≈13.242.

Alternatively, A->D->B->C:≈4.242 +3 +5≈12.242.

So, yeah, that's the minimal.

Therefore, the minimal total distance is 8 +3*sqrt(2), which is≈12.242.

But let me just think again.

Is there a way to arrange the path such that the total distance is less than 8 +3*sqrt(2)?

Wait, perhaps, if we can find a path that traverses some sides multiple times, but the problem says we have to visit the other three points once, so we can't revisit any point.

Wait, but the problem is, the distances between points are fixed, so no, we can't take shortcuts or anything.

Therefore, the minimal total distance is indeed 8 +3*sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me think if 8 +3*sqrt(2) is the minimal.

Alternatively, is there a way to have a path that goes A->D->B->C, which is sqrt(18) +3 +5, which is≈4.242 +3 +5≈12.242.

Alternatively, is there a way to make the path shorter by rearranging?

Wait, if I go A->D, D->C, C->B:≈4.242 +4 +5≈13.242.

So, that's longer.

Alternatively, A->D, D->B, B->C:≈4.242 +3 +5≈12.242.

So, same.

Alternatively, A->B, B->D, D->C:≈6.708 +3 +4≈13.708.

So, no.

Alternatively, is there a way to connect A to C, then C to D, then D to B:≈7.616 +4 +3≈14.616.

Nope.

So, I think that 8 +3*sqrt(2) is indeed the minimal total distance.

Therefore, the answer is 8 +3*sqrt(2), which is approximately12.242.

But in exact terms, it's 8 +3*sqrt(2).

But let me check if that's correct.

Wait, 3*sqrt(2) is the distance from A to D, then 3 is D to B, then 5 is B to C.

So, total is 3*sqrt(2) +3 +5=8 +3*sqrt(2).

Yes.

Alternatively, is 8 +3*sqrt(2) the minimal? Or is there another combination.

Wait, perhaps another path.

Wait, starting from D, going to B, then to C, then to A:≈3 +5 +sqrt(18)=≈3 +5 +4.242≈12.242.

Same as above.

So, same total distance.

Therefore, 8 +3*sqrt(2) is the minimal.

Therefore, the answer is 8 +3*sqrt(2), which can be written as 3*sqrt(2) +8.

But let me compute it precisely.

Wait, sqrt(2)≈1.41421356, so 3*sqrt(2)≈4.24264.

Then, 4.24264 +8≈12.24264.

So,≈12.24264.

But the question is asking for the shortest distance, so it's better to write it in exact form, which is8 +3*sqrt(2).

Alternatively, it can be written as sqrt(18) +8, but that's same as3*sqrt(2) +8.

So, either way.

But let me see if the problem expects a numerical value or an exact expression.

Looking back at the problem:

"What is the shortest distance that can be travelled if you start at any point, A, B, C, or D, and visit the other three points once?"

It says "shortest distance", so probably expects an exact value.

So, 8 +3*sqrt(2).

But let me see if that's correct.

Alternatively, is there a path that goes through different points with a shorter total?

Wait, is there a path that goes from A to C, then to B, then to D? Wait, that's≈7.616 +5 +3≈15.616, which is longer.

Alternatively, starting from A, going to D, then to C, then to B:≈4.242 +4 +5≈13.242.

Alternatively, starting from A, going to B, then to D, then to C:≈6.708 +3 +4≈13.708.

So, no, the minimal is≈12.242.

Wait, so yeah, 8 +3*sqrt(2) is correct.

Therefore, I think the minimal total distance is8 +3*sqrt(2), which is approximately12.242.

So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The shortest distance is \boxed{8 + 3\sqrt{2}}.
</think>

To find the shortest distance that can be travelled starting from any point \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visiting the other three points once, we need to consider the distances between each pair of points. The coordinates of the points are given, and we can calculate the distances using the distance formula.

The coordinates are:
- \(A(-3, 3)\)
- \(B(3, 0)\)
- \(C(0, -4)\)
- \(D(0, 0)\)

The distances between each pair of points are:
- \(AB = \sqrt{(3 - (-3))^2 + (0 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{45}\)
- \(AC = \sqrt{(0 - (-3))^2 + (-4 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{58}\)
- \(AD = \sqrt{(0 - (-3))^2 + (0 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{18}\)
- \(BC = 5\)
- \(BD = 3\)
- \(CD = 4\)

We need to find the shortest path that visits all four points starting from any one point. This is a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) where we need to visit each point exactly once and return to the starting point, but in this case, we do not need to return to the starting point.

After evaluating all possible paths starting from each point, we find that the shortest path is achieved by starting from \(A\), going to \(D\), then to \(B\), and finally to \(C\). The total distance for this path is calculated as follows:

- \(A \to D\): \(\sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}\)
- \(D \to B\): 3
- \(B \to C\): 5

Thus, the total distance is:
\[ 3\sqrt{2} + 3 + 5 = 8 + 3\sqrt{2} \]

Therefore, the shortest distance that can be travelled is \(\boxed{8 + 3\sqrt{2}}\).
