Question:
Let $S$ be the set of points $(a,b)$ with $0 \le a,$ $b \le 1$ such that the equation
\[x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1 = 0\]has at least one real root.  Determine the area of the graph of $S.$

Correct Answer:
Note that $x = 0$ cannot be a solution of the equation.  Dividing both sides by $x^2,$ we get
\[x^2 + ax - b + \frac{a}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} = 0.\]Let $y = x + \frac{1}{x}.$  Then $x^2 - yx + 1 = 0.$  The discriminant of this quadratic is
\[y^2 - 4,\]so there is a real root in $x$ as long as $|y| \ge 2.$

Also, $y^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2},$ so
\[y^2 + ay - (b + 2) = 0.\]By the quadratic formula, the roots are
\[y = \frac{-a \pm \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2}.\]First, we notice that the discriminant $a^2 + 4(b + 2)$ is always positive.  Furthermore, there is a value $y$ such that $|y| \ge 2$ as long as
\[\frac{a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2} \ge 2.\]Then $a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 4,$ or $\sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 4 - a.$  Both sides are nonnegative, so we can square both sides, to get
\[a^2 + 4(b + 2) \ge a^2 - 8a + 16.\]This simplifies to $2a + b \ge 2.$

Thus, $S$ is the triangle whose vertices are $(1,0),$ $(1,1),$ and $\left( \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right),$ which has area $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of the set S, which consists of points (a, b) with both a and b between 0 and 1. The condition is that the equation \(x^4 + a x^3 - b x^2 + a x + 1 = 0\) has at least one real root. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.

First, I know that if a polynomial has real roots, then there must be some real number x that satisfies the equation. So, I need to figure out for which values of a and b this equation has at least one real solution.

Let me write the equation again:

\(x^4 + a x^3 - b x^2 + a x + 1 = 0\)

Hmm, this looks like a quartic equation, which can be tricky. Maybe I can factor it or find some symmetry. Let's see if the polynomial is symmetric or palindromic. A palindromic polynomial satisfies \(x^n P(1/x) = P(x)\), right?

Let me check. If I take \(x^4 P(1/x)\), that would be:

\(x^4 \left( (1/x)^4 + a (1/x)^3 - b (1/x)^2 + a (1/x) + 1 \right)\)
= \(1 + a x - b x^2 + a x^3 + x^4\)
Which is the same as P(x), just written in reverse. So yes, it is a palindromic polynomial. That's useful because palindromic polynomials have some nice properties.

For a palindromic polynomial of even degree 4, I remember that if \(x\) is a root, then \(1/x\) is also a root. So, this polynomial can be factored as \((x^2 + m x + 1)(x^2 + n x + 1)\), maybe? Let me try that.

Expanding \((x^2 + m x + 1)(x^2 + n x + 1)\):

= \(x^4 + (m + n) x^3 + (mn + 2) x^2 + (m + n) x + 1\)

Comparing this to the original polynomial:

Original: \(x^4 + a x^3 - b x^2 + a x + 1\)

So, equating coefficients:

1. \(m + n = a\) (from \(x^3\) term)
2. \(mn + 2 = -b\) (from \(x^2\) term)
3. \(m + n = a\) (from x term)
4. The constant term is 1, which matches.

So, we have two equations:

1. \(m + n = a\)
2. \(mn = -b - 2\)

Hmm, so we have a system here. Maybe I can solve for m and n in terms of a and b. But I'm not sure if that will help directly. Maybe I can think about the roots.

Since it's a palindromic polynomial, all roots come in reciprocal pairs. So, if r is a root, then 1/r is also a root. So, to have at least one real root, it's necessary that the polynomial has an even number of real roots, or maybe one real root with multiplicity. Wait, but for a quartic, it can have 0, 2, or 4 real roots (since complex roots come in pairs). So, having at least one real root would mean having two or four real roots.

But wait, actually, no. A quartic can have 0, 2, or 4 real roots. So, if it has an even number of real roots, including zero. Hmm, so if we have at least one real root, then we must have either two or four real roots. But if it's tangent to the x-axis, it can have a double root, which is technically one real root with multiplicity two.

But the problem states "at least one real root," so that includes multiplicity. So, the question is, for which (a, b) does this polynomial have real roots, meaning either two or four real roots.

But maybe another approach is to substitute y = x + 1/x, as sometimes is done for palindromic polynomials. Let me try that.

Let me let \(y = x + \frac{1}{x}\). Then, \(x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = y^2 - 2\), and \(x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = y^3 - 3 y\). Maybe I can use that substitution.

But our polynomial is \(x^4 + a x^3 - b x^2 + a x + 1 = 0\). Let me divide both sides by x^2 to make it symmetric:

\(x^2 + a x - b + \frac{a}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} = 0\)

So, \(x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} + a \left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right) - b = 0\)

Which can be written as:

\((x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}) + a (x + \frac{1}{x}) - b = 0\)

Now, using the substitution \(y = x + \frac{1}{x}\), then \(x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = y^2 - 2\). So, substituting that in, we get:

\(y^2 - 2 + a y - b = 0\)

Which simplifies to:

\(y^2 + a y - (b + 2) = 0\)

So now, this is a quadratic in y:

\(y^2 + a y - (b + 2) = 0\)

For real roots x, we need y to be real, because y is defined as \(x + 1/x\), which is real if x is real (except when x=0, but since x=0 isn't a root of the original equation, we're okay). So, the quadratic in y must have real solutions for y. So, discriminant must be non-negative.

The discriminant D of \(y^2 + a y - (b + 2) = 0\) is:

\(D = a^2 + 4(b + 2)\)

Since D must be non-negative for real solutions:

\(a^2 + 4(b + 2) \ge 0\)

But \(a\) and \(b\) are both between 0 and 1, so \(a^2\) is non-negative, and \(4(b + 2)\) is positive. So, the discriminant is always positive. Therefore, the quadratic in y will always have two real roots. Hmm, but that doesn't necessarily guarantee that x is real.

Wait, so even though y is real, does that imply that x is real?

Not necessarily, because y = x + 1/x, and even though y is real, x might still be complex. For example, if y is real, x could be real or complex. So, we need to ensure that at least one of the roots y leads to a real x.

So, perhaps, I need to find conditions on a and b such that the equation \(y^2 + a y - (b + 2) = 0\) has at least one y such that the equation \(x + 1/x = y\) has a real solution x.

So, let's consider the equation \(x + 1/x = y\). For real x ≠ 0, we can analyze this.

Let me solve for x:

Multiply both sides by x: \(x^2 + 1 = y x\)

So, \(x^2 - y x + 1 = 0\)

The discriminant for this quadratic in x is \(y^2 - 4\). For x to be real, discriminant must be non-negative:

\(y^2 - 4 \ge 0 \implies y^2 \ge 4 \implies |y| \ge 2\)

So, y must be ≤ -2 or y ≥ 2.

But in our case, the original equation is \(x^4 + a x^3 - b x^2 + a x + 1 = 0\). Since x ≠ 0, we can consider positive x because if x is a root, then 1/x is also a root. So, let's consider x > 0.

Then, y = x + 1/x ≥ 2, by AM ≥ GM. So, for x > 0, y ≥ 2.

Therefore, for real positive x, y must be at least 2. So, in order for the original equation to have a real root, the quadratic in y must have a solution y ≥ 2.

Therefore, the quadratic \(y^2 + a y - (b + 2) = 0\) must have at least one root y ≥ 2.

So, now, the problem reduces to: for given a and b, does the quadratic \(y^2 + a y - (b + 2) = 0\) have a root y ≥ 2?

We can find the roots of this quadratic:

\(y = \frac{ -a \pm \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} }{2}\)

Since we're looking for y ≥ 2, we can consider the larger root:

\(y = \frac{ -a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} }{2}\)

We need this root to be ≥ 2:

\(\frac{ -a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} }{2} \ge 2\)

Multiply both sides by 2:

\(-a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 4\)

Add a to both sides:

\(\sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 4 + a\)

Now, square both sides (since both sides are positive, squaring preserves inequality):

\(a^2 + 4(b + 2) \ge (4 + a)^2\)

Expand the right side:

\(a^2 + 4b + 8 \ge 16 + 8a + a^2\)

Subtract \(a^2\) from both sides:

\(4b + 8 \ge 16 + 8a\)

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\(4b \ge 8 + 8a\)

Divide both sides by 4:

\(b \ge 2 + 2a\)

Wait, hold on. \(b \ge 2 + 2a\). But b is between 0 and 1, and a is between 0 and 1 as well. So, 2 + 2a would be at least 2 (when a=0) and up to 4 (when a=1). But since b ≤ 1, this inequality \(b \ge 2 + 2a\) cannot be satisfied because 2 + 2a > 1 for all a > 0.5.

Wait, this seems contradictory. Maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me go back step by step.

1. The original equation is a quartic, palindromic, so it can be written in terms of y = x + 1/x.

2. The quadratic in y is \(y^2 + a y - (b + 2) = 0\).

3. For real positive x, y ≥ 2.

4. So, we need the quadratic in y to have a root ≥ 2.

5. The larger root is \(\frac{ -a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} }{2}\). We need this to be ≥ 2.

6. So, set up the inequality:

\(\frac{ -a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} }{2} \ge 2\)

Multiply both sides by 2:

\(-a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 4\)

Add a to both sides:

\(\sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 4 + a\)

Square both sides:

\(a^2 + 4(b + 2) \ge 16 + 8a + a^2\)

Simplify:

4(b + 2) ≥ 16 + 8a

Divide both sides by 4:

b + 2 ≥ 4 + 2a

Subtract 2:

b ≥ 2 + 2a

Wait, so same result as before. Hmm, but this can't be, because b is at most 1, and 2 + 2a is at least 2 (when a=0) and up to 4 (when a=1). So, this inequality can never be satisfied because b is limited to [0,1].

So, does this mean that there are no real roots? But that contradicts the fact that the quartic must have at least one real root for some (a, b). Maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about specific cases. For example, suppose a = 0, then the equation becomes \(x^4 - b x^2 + 1 = 0\). Let me see if that has real roots.

Let me set \(y = x^2\), so the equation becomes \(y^2 - b y + 1 = 0\). The discriminant is \(b^2 - 4\). For real roots, discriminant must be non-negative, so \(b^2 - 4 \ge 0\), which implies \(b \ge 2\) or \(b \le -2\). But since b is between 0 and 1, this equation has no real roots when a=0. So, that's interesting.

Wait, so when a=0, the equation has no real roots. So, (0, b) is not in S for any b in [0,1]. So, that's one boundary.

Similarly, maybe when a is varied, we can have real roots.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider when the quadratic in y has a root y ≥ 2, but maybe also considering the smaller root.

Wait, the quadratic in y is \(y^2 + a y - (b + 2) = 0\). The roots are:

\(y = \frac{ -a \pm \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} }{2}\)

So, the smaller root is \(\frac{ -a - \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} }{2}\), which is negative, and the larger root is positive.

But since we are considering x positive, y must be ≥ 2, so only the larger root is relevant here.

But as we saw, that leads to \(b \ge 2 + 2a\), which is impossible because b ≤1.

Wait, this suggests that for all a, b in [0,1], the equation has no real roots? But that can't be true because for example, if we take a=1, b=0, let's see:

Equation becomes \(x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x + 1 = 0\). Let me try x = -1: \(1 -1 -1 -1 +1 = -1 ≠0\). x= -2: 16 -8 -4 -2 +1=3≠0. How about x=1: 1 +1 -1 +1 +1=3≠0. Maybe this polynomial doesn't have real roots?

Wait, but quartic polynomials must have an even number of real roots or zero. So, maybe for a=1, b=0, there are no real roots? Let me check the behavior of the polynomial.

As x approaches infinity, x^4 dominates, so it goes to positive infinity. As x approaches negative infinity, x^4 also dominates, so it goes to positive infinity. So, it's possible that it has a minimum somewhere in between.

Let me compute the derivative to find critical points.

Let f(x) = x^4 + a x^3 - b x^2 + a x + 1

f'(x) = 4x^3 + 3a x^2 - 2b x + a

For a=1, b=0, f'(x) = 4x^3 + 3x^2 +1

Set f'(x)=0: 4x^3 + 3x^2 +1=0

Hmm, solving this cubic might be complicated, but let me test x=-1: -4 +3 +1=0. So, x=-1 is a root.

So, factor f'(x) as (x +1)(4x^2 - x +1). Then, 4x^2 -x +1 discriminant is 1 -16= -15 <0, so no real roots. Therefore, the only critical point is at x=-1.

So, for a=1, b=0, f(x) has a critical point at x=-1. Let me compute f(-1):

f(-1) = 1 -1 -1 -1 +1= -1

So, the function has a minimum at x=-1 with f(-1)=-1. Then, as x approaches positive infinity, f(x) approaches infinity, and as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches infinity as well. So, the function has a minimum value of -1, but since it goes to infinity on both ends, it must cross the x-axis twice somewhere. Wait, but when x is positive, let's see f(0)=1, f(1)=1 +1 -0 +1 +1=4>0, so no crossing on the positive side. On the negative side, f(-1)=-1, f(-2)=16 -8 -4 -2 +1=3>0. So, it goes from positive at x=-2, to negative at x=-1, so by intermediate value theorem, there's a root between x=-2 and x=-1. Similarly, since it's coming from negative at x=-1 and going back to positive as x approaches negative infinity, but actually, as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity, so there must be another root between x=-1 and x approaching negative infinity? Wait, but we only have one critical point at x=-1.

Wait, let me graph it mentally. At x=-2, f(-2)=16 -8 -4 -2 +1=3. At x=-1, f(-1)=-1. Then, as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity. So, between x=-infinity and x=-2, f(x) goes from positive infinity to 3. So, it's decreasing, right? Because f'(-2) = 4*(-2)^3 +3*(-2)^2 +1= -32 + 12 +1= -19 <0. So, it's decreasing from x=-infty to x=-1. So, between x=-infty and x=-1, it's decreasing from +infty to f(-1)=-1. So, it crosses the x-axis once in (-infty, -1). Then, from x=-1 to x=+infty, the function is increasing, since derivative is positive. At x=-1, f(-1)=-1, and at x=+infty, f(x)=+infty, so it crosses once in (-1, +infty). So, actually, two real roots. So, for a=1, b=0, the equation has two real roots.

Wait, so earlier I thought that the equation had no real roots, but actually, it does have two real roots. So, my earlier conclusion was wrong.

So, perhaps my approach is missing something.

Alternatively, maybe my initial substitution and the quadratic in y is correct, but perhaps I have to consider another perspective.

Wait, maybe instead of focusing on y ≥ 2, I should look for x real such that the polynomial is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the polynomial as \(x^4 + a x^3 - b x^2 + a x + 1 = 0\), and try to factor it.

Wait, let me try to factor the polynomial. Maybe as (x^2 + p x +1)(x^2 + q x +1). Let's see:

Multiply out: \(x^4 + (p + q) x^3 + (pq + 2) x^2 + (p + q) x +1\)

Compare to original:

\(x^4 + a x^3 - b x^2 + a x +1\)

So, equating coefficients:

1. \(p + q = a\)
2. \(pq + 2 = -b\)

So, we have:

\(pq = -b -2\)

But since p and q are real numbers (since we are trying to factor into quadratics with real coefficients), then the discriminant of the quadratic equation for p and q must be non-negative.

Wait, actually, p and q are roots of the equation \(t^2 - a t + (-b -2) = 0\). So, discriminant D is:

\(D = a^2 - 4*(-b -2) = a^2 + 4b +8\)

Which is always positive because a^2 and 4b are non-negative, and 8 is positive. So, p and q are always real. Therefore, the polynomial can always be factored into two quadratics with real coefficients.

But does that mean that the polynomial always has real roots? Not necessarily. Because even though it factors into quadratics, each quadratic might not have real roots.

So, the next step is: when does each quadratic have real roots.

Each quadratic is \(x^2 + p x +1\) and \(x^2 + q x +1\). The discriminant of each is \(p^2 -4\) and \(q^2 -4\). So, if either discriminant is non-negative, then the quadratic has real roots.

So, for the polynomial to have real roots, at least one of the quadratics must have real roots. Therefore, we require that either \(p^2 \ge 4\) or \(q^2 \ge 4\).

But p and q satisfy:

1. \(p + q = a\)
2. \(p q = -b -2\)

So, let me write \(q = a - p\). Then, \(p (a - p) = -b -2\), so:

\(a p - p^2 = -b -2\)

Rearranged:

\(p^2 - a p - (b + 2) = 0\)

Which is the same quadratic as before. So, again, we end up with the same condition.

Wait, so if either \(p^2 \ge 4\) or \(q^2 \ge 4\), then the quadratic has real roots, hence the original quartic has real roots.

Therefore, we need either \(p^2 \ge 4\) or \(q^2 \ge 4\).

But p and q are roots of \(t^2 - a t + (-b -2) =0\). So, p and q are:

\(p = \frac{a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2}\)

\(q = \frac{a - \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2}\)

So, \(p^2 \ge 4\) or \(q^2 \ge 4\).

Let me compute p^2:

\(p^2 = \left( \frac{a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{a^2 + 2 a \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} + a^2 + 4(b + 2)}{4}\)

Simplify:

= \(\frac{2 a^2 + 4(b + 2) + 2 a \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{4}\)

= \(\frac{a^2 + 2(b + 2) + a \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2}\)

Similarly, q^2 would be:

= \(\left( \frac{a - \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{a^2 - 2 a \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} + a^2 + 4(b + 2)}{4}\)

= \(\frac{2 a^2 + 4(b + 2) - 2 a \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{4}\)

= \(\frac{a^2 + 2(b + 2) - a \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2}\)

So, we have p^2 and q^2 as above. So, for p^2 ≥4 or q^2 ≥4.

But these expressions seem complicated. Maybe I can set up inequalities.

Wait, let's consider p^2 ≥4.

So,

\(\frac{a^2 + 2(b + 2) + a \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2} \ge 4\)

Multiply both sides by 2:

\(a^2 + 2(b + 2) + a \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 8\)

Similarly, for q^2 ≥4:

\(\frac{a^2 + 2(b + 2) - a \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2} \ge 4\)

Multiply by 2:

\(a^2 + 2(b + 2) - a \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 8\)

So, either of these inequalities must hold.

So, let's tackle p^2 ≥4 first:

\(a^2 + 2(b + 2) + a \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 8\)

Simplify 2(b + 2) = 2b +4, so:

\(a^2 + 2b + 4 + a \sqrt{a^2 + 4b + 8} \ge 8\)

Subtract 8:

\(a^2 + 2b + 4 + a \sqrt{a^2 + 4b + 8} -8 \ge 0\)

Simplify:

\(a^2 + 2b -4 + a \sqrt{a^2 + 4b + 8} \ge 0\)

Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe let me denote \(k = a^2 + 4b +8\), then sqrt(k) is there. But I don't see an easy way.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that both a and b are between 0 and 1, so let's see if it's possible for p^2 ≥4.

Compute p:

p = [a + sqrt(a^2 + 4b +8)] / 2

Given a and b in [0,1], sqrt(a^2 +4b +8) is at least sqrt(0 +0 +8)=2√2≈2.828, and at most sqrt(1 +4 +8)=sqrt(13)≈3.606.

So, p is in [ (0 + 2.828)/2 ≈1.414, (1 + 3.606)/2≈2.303 ]

So, p is between approximately 1.414 and 2.303, so p^2 is between approximately 2 and 5.3.

So, p^2 can go up to about 5.3, which is greater than 4, so p^2 ≥4 is possible.

Similarly, for q^2: since q = [a - sqrt(a^2 +4b +8)] /2.

Given that sqrt(a^2 +4b +8) ≥ sqrt(8) ≈2.828, and a is at most 1, so q is at most (1 - 2.828)/2 ≈-0.914, so q is negative, so q^2 is at least (0.914)^2 ≈0.835, which is less than 4.

So, q^2 can't be ≥4, so only p^2 can be ≥4.

Therefore, the condition reduces to p^2 ≥4, which is:

\(\left( \frac{a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2} \right)^2 \ge 4\)

Which simplifies to:

\(a + \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)} \ge 4\)

Wait, wait, let me re-examine:

Wait, p^2 = [a + sqrt(a^2 +4b +8)]^2 /4 ≥4

Multiply both sides by 4:

[a + sqrt(a^2 +4b +8)]^2 ≥16

Take square roots (since both sides are positive):

a + sqrt(a^2 +4b +8) ≥4

So,

sqrt(a^2 +4b +8) ≥4 -a

Since sqrt(a^2 +4b +8) is non-negative, and 4 - a is positive because a ≤1, so 4 -a ≥3.

Therefore, sqrt(a^2 +4b +8) ≥4 -a

Square both sides:

a^2 +4b +8 ≥ (4 -a)^2 =16 -8a +a^2

Subtract a^2:

4b +8 ≥16 -8a

Subtract 16:

4b -8 ≥ -8a

Divide both sides by 4:

b -2 ≥ -2a

Add 2:

b ≥ -2a +2

But since b ≥0 and a ∈[0,1], -2a +2 ranges from 0 to 2.

But b ≤1, so combining b ≥ max(0, -2a +2). But since -2a +2 is ≥0 when a ≤1, which it always is. So, b ≥ -2a +2.

But, wait, -2a +2 is ≥1 when a ≤0.5, because:

If a=0, -2a +2=2, which is above b's upper bound, so b must be ≥2 which is impossible.

Wait, this seems conflicting.

Wait, let me double-check.

From sqrt(a^2 +4b +8) ≥4 -a, which is always true because sqrt(a^2 +4b +8) ≥ sqrt(8)=2.828, and 4 -a ≥3, so 2.828 ≥3 is false.

Wait, hold on. sqrt(a^2 +4b +8) is always ≥ sqrt(8) ≈2.828, and 4 -a is at least 3, since a ≤1. So, 2.828 ≥3 is false. So, the inequality sqrt(a^2 +4b +8) ≥4 -a is always false, because LHS ≈2.828 <3=RHS.

Therefore, p^2 ≥4 is impossible because it would require sqrt(a^2 +4b +8) ≥4 -a, which is false because LHS < RHS.

Therefore, p^2 <4 always, which implies that the quadratic \(x^2 + p x +1\) does not have real roots.

Similarly, as we saw, q^2 <4, so \(x^2 + q x +1\) also does not have real roots.

Wait, so does that mean that the quartic equation never has real roots? But earlier, when a=1, b=0, we saw that the equation does have real roots.

Wait, that's a contradiction. So, my approach must be wrong.

Wait, let me think again. If both quadratics \(x^2 +p x +1\) and \(x^2 + q x +1\) have discriminants \(p^2 -4\) and \(q^2 -4\), respectively. So, if either p^2 ≥4 or q^2 ≥4, the quadratic has real roots, so the quartic has real roots.

But from above, p^2 and q^2 are both less than 4, so both quadratics have complex roots. So, the quartic is a product of two quadratics with complex roots, meaning all roots are complex? But earlier, for a=1, b=0, the quartic had real roots.

Wait, something is wrong here.

Wait, no. Let me check for a=1, b=0:

Quadratic in y: \(y^2 +1 y - (0 +2)= y^2 + y -2=0\). The roots are y=1 and y=-2. So, y=1 and y=-2.

Then, for y=1, x +1/x=1, which leads to x^2 -x +1=0, which has discriminant 1 -4= -3, so complex roots.

For y=-2, x +1/x=-2, which leads to x^2 +2x +1=0, which factors as (x+1)^2=0, so x=-1 is a double root.

So, the quartic equation has a real root x=-1 (double root). So, even though both quadratics have complex roots, the quartic can have real roots because one of the quadratics has a double root at x=-1.

So, in this case, the quartic equation has real roots even though the quadratics have complex roots. Therefore, my initial assumption that the quartic has real roots only if the quadratics have real roots is incorrect.

Therefore, perhaps the quartic has real roots if and only if the quadratic in y has a root y ≥2.

So, going back, the quadratic in y is \(y^2 + a y - (b +2)=0\), and we need y ≥2.

So, the quadratic has roots y1 and y2, with y1 ≤ y2.

We need y2 ≥2.

So, the larger root y2 = [ -a + sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ] /2 ≥2.

So, same as before:

[ -a + sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ] /2 ≥2

Multiply by 2:

 -a + sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≥4

Add a:

sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≥4 +a

Square both sides:

a^2 +4b +8 ≥16 +8a +a^2

Simplify:

4b +8 ≥16 +8a

Subtract 8:

4b ≥8 +8a

Divide by 4:

b ≥2 +2a

But since b ≤1 and 2 +2a ≥2, this inequality can't be satisfied.

Wait, that suggests that the quadratic in y never has a root y ≥2, which would imply that the quartic equation has no real roots. But that's contradicted by the case when a=1, b=0, which does have a real root.

Wait, so maybe my mistake is in the substitution. Let me verify.

When I set y =x +1/x, I assumed that x ≠0. But when x=-1, y= -2, which is consistent with the earlier case.

But in the case when a=1, b=0, the quadratic in y had y=1 (which would lead to complex roots) and y=-2 (which leads to real roots). So, in this case, even though y=1 is less than 2, we still have a real root because y=-2 is allowed.

But y=-2 is less than 2, but still, it leads to a real root. So, perhaps the condition isn't just that y ≥2, but also considering y ≤-2? Because y= x +1/x, for real x, y can be ≥2 or ≤-2.

Wait, that's an important point. I thought y ≥2, but actually, y can also be ≤-2.

So, in the case when a=1, b=0, y=-2 is a root, which gives x=-1 as a real root.

Therefore, maybe the quartic has real roots if either y ≥2 or y ≤-2.

Therefore, the quadratic in y has to have a root y ≥2 or y ≤-2.

So, that is, either y1 ≥2 or y2 ≤-2.

So, then, let's consider both cases.

First, y2 ≥2, which we saw leads to b ≥2 +2a, which is impossible.

Second, y1 ≤ -2.

The smaller root y1 is [ -a - sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ] /2.

We need y1 ≤ -2.

So, [ -a - sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ] /2 ≤ -2

Multiply both sides by 2:

 -a - sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≤ -4

Multiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality):

a + sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≥4

So,

sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≥4 -a

Again, since sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) is always at least sqrt(8)≈2.828, and 4 -a is at least 3 (since a ≤1). So, sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≥4 -a is equivalent to 2.828 ≥3, which is false.

So, this inequality is also impossible.

Wait, so both cases, y ≥2 and y ≤-2, lead to impossible inequalities.

But in the case when a=1, b=0, the quadratic in y had a root y=-2, which gives real roots.

But according to the above, y1 ≤-2 is not possible because it leads to sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≥4 -a, which is false.

But that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine when y= -2 is a root.

Given the quadratic \(y^2 +a y - (b +2)=0\), when y=-2 is a root, substituting y=-2:

(-2)^2 +a*(-2) - (b +2)=0

4 -2a -b -2=0

Simplify:

2 -2a -b=0

So,

2a + b=2

So, when 2a + b=2, then y=-2 is a root.

Therefore, when 2a + b=2, the quartic equation has a real root x=-1 (because y=-2 corresponds to x=-1). So, in this case, even though the quadratic in y doesn't have a root y ≥2, it has a root y=-2, which gives a real root.

Therefore, the quartic equation has real roots if either y ≥2 or y=-2.

But wait, if y=-2 is a root, then we can have real roots, so perhaps the quartic equation has real roots if either y ≥2 or y=-2.

But y=-2 is a specific case, not a range. So, perhaps the quartic equation has real roots if either:

1. The quadratic in y has a root y ≥2, or

2. The quadratic in y has a root y=-2.

Therefore, the quartic has real roots if either:

- The larger root y2 ≥2, which requires b ≥2 +2a, which is impossible, or

- The smaller root y1=-2, which requires 2a + b=2.

So, in the case when 2a + b=2, the quartic has a real root.

But when 2a + b <2, is it possible that the quadratic in y has another real root y ≤-2?

Wait, let's check.

If y=-2 is not a root, can the quadratic in y have another root y ≤-2?

Well, the quadratic is \(y^2 +a y - (b +2)=0\). So, if the quadratic has two real roots y1 and y2, and we know that their product is y1 y2= - (b +2). Since b is between 0 and1, -(b +2) is between -3 and -2. So, the product of the roots is negative, which means one root is positive and one is negative.

Therefore, since the product is negative, one root is positive, and the other is negative. So, only one root is positive, and the other is negative.

Therefore, the quartic equation can have real roots only when the positive root y is ≥2, or when the negative root y is ≤-2.

But wait, the quartic can have either two real roots or four real roots.

Wait, but if the quartic is a product of two quadratics, each quadratic having one real root and one complex root, then the quartic has two real roots.

Wait, no. If the quadratic has a double real root, like in the case when y=-2, which led to a double root at x=-1, then the quartic equation has a double real root.

But in general, if the quadratic in y has two real roots, one positive and one negative, then the quartic equation would have four real roots? No, because each quadratic contributes two roots, but since the quadratics have one real and one complex root, the quartic would have two real roots.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

If the quadratic \(x^2 +p x +1\) has discriminant p^2 -4. If p^2 -4 <0, then it has complex roots. Similarly, for \(x^2 + q x +1\), if q^2 -4 <0, then complex roots. Therefore, the quartic equation, being the product of two quadratics with complex roots, has four complex roots.

But in the case when y=-2 is a root, then the quadratic \(x^2 + q x +1\) has a root y=-2, which requires q = a + sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)), but wait, this seems conflicting.

Wait, no. Let me take a step back.

If the quadratic in y has a root y=-2, which is real, then the quartic equation has real roots because x +1/x = y=-2, leading to x=-1 as a real root.

But in this case, the other quadratic factor, \(x^2 + p x +1\), will have complex roots, so quartic has two real roots (from the quadratic with real roots) and two complex roots.

Wait, no, actually, if both quadratics have one real and one complex root, then the quartic equation has two real roots and two complex roots. So, in the case when 2a + b=2, we have a double real root at x=-1.

Wait, let me check when a=1, b=0, which satisfies 2a + b=2*1 +0=2. The quartic equation is \(x^4 +x^3 -x^2 +x +1=0\). Factoring, we saw that x=-1 is a root, and the quartic can be factored as (x +1)^2(x^2 -x +1)=0. So, x=-1 is a double root, and x^2 -x +1=0 has complex roots.

So, in this case, quartic has two real roots (x=-1, double root) and two complex roots.

So, going back, to have real roots, the quartic must have either:

1. A real root from the positive y root (y ≥2), which requires the quadratic in y has y ≥2, which is impossible, or

2. A real root from the negative y root (y ≤-2), which can happen if y=-2 is a root, which requires 2a + b=2.

Alternatively, if the quadratic in y has two real roots, one positive and one negative, and the positive one is ≥2, but as we saw, that's impossible because it would require b ≥2 +2a, which is beyond b's upper limit.

So, the only way for the quartic to have real roots is if the quadratic in y has y=-2 as a root, i.e., 2a + b=2.

Therefore, the set S consists of all points (a, b) in [0,1]x[0,1] such that 2a + b=2.

But wait, 2a + b=2 is a line.

But given that a and b are in [0,1], let's see where 2a + b=2 intersects the square.

If a=0, then b=2, which is beyond b=1.

If b=0, then 2a=2 => a=1.

So, the line 2a + b=2 intersects the square at (a, b)=(1,0).

Is there another intersection?

Wait, when a=1, b=0.

If we go beyond a=1, but a is limited to 1.

Similarly, when b=1, 2a +1=2 =>a=0.5.

So, the line goes from (1,0) to (0.5,1).

Therefore, the set S is the line segment connecting (1,0) to (0.5,1).

Thus, the area of S is zero, because it's a line segment.

But the problem says "the equation [...] has at least one real root. Determine the area of the graph of S."

Wait, but that can't be, because the area would be zero. But maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, earlier, we saw that when a=1, b=0, the quartic has a real root. Similarly, when a=0.5, b=1, 2a +b=2*0.5 +1=2, so 2a +b=2.

So, when 2a + b=2, the quartic has real roots.

But are there other points where the quartic has real roots?

Wait, let me take another example: a=0.5, b=0.5.

Then, 2a + b=1 +0.5=1.5 <2, so 2a + b <2.

So, in this case, does the quartic have real roots?

Let me compute the quartic equation: \(x^4 +0.5x^3 -0.5x^2 +0.5x +1=0\)

Does this have real roots?

Let me test x=1: 1 +0.5 -0.5 +0.5 +1=2.5>0

x=-1:1 -0.5 -0.5 -0.5 +1=0.5>0

x=2:16 +4 -2 +1 +1=20>0

x=-2:16 -4 -2 -1 +1=10>0

Wait, seems like no easy roots.

Compute f(0)=1>0

f(1)=2.5>0

f(-1)=0.5>0

Wait, maybe the quartic is always positive?

Compute derivative: 4x^3 +1.5x^2 -x +0.5

Set to zero: 4x^3 +1.5x^2 -x +0.5=0

This seems complicated, but maybe it's always positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartic is always positive, hence no real roots.

Therefore, for a=0.5, b=0.5, the quartic has no real roots, so (0.5,0.5) is not in S.

Therefore, only the line 2a +b=2 within [0,1]x[0,1] gives real roots.

Therefore, S is the line segment from (1,0) to (0.5,1). So, it's a line segment, which has zero area.

But the problem says to determine the area of the graph of S.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the quartic can have real roots even when 2a +b ≠2.

Wait, let me think again.

Earlier, we saw that when y=-2 is a root, quartic has real roots. Also, we can have cases where the quartic has real roots when the quadratic in y has a positive root y ≥2, but that's impossible.

But wait, perhaps the quartic can have real roots when the quadratic in y has two real roots, one positive and one negative, but in such a way that one of the quadratics \(x^2 +p x +1\) or \(x^2 +q x +1\) has a real root.

So, for example, if \(x^2 +p x +1=0\) has real roots, which requires p^2 -4 ≥0, so p ≥2 or p ≤-2. But p = [a + sqrt(a^2 +4(b + 2))]/2. Since a and b are non-negative, p is positive. So, p ≥2.

So, p ≥2.

Similarly, for \(x^2 +q x +1=0\), q = [a - sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2))]/2. Since sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≥ sqrt(8)≈2.828, and a ≤1, so q = [a - sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2))]/2 ≤ [1 - sqrt(8)] /2 ≈ negative number.

But for \(x^2 + q x +1=0\), to have real roots, q^2 -4 ≥0. So, q ≤-2 or q ≥2. Since q is negative, we need q ≤-2.

So, q ≤-2.

So, let's write down these conditions:

Either \(p ≥2\) or \(q ≤-2\).

So, let's compute these:

1. p ≥2:

[ a + sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ] /2 ≥2

Multiply by 2:

a + sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≥4

As before, this leads to sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≥4 -a

But since sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≥ sqrt(8)≈2.828 and 4 -a ≥3, this is impossible.

2. q ≤ -2:

[ a - sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ] /2 ≤ -2

Multiply by 2:

a - sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≤ -4

Rearranged:

sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≥a +4

But sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≥a +4

Since sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≥ sqrt(8)≈2.828, and a +4 ≥4, which is greater than sqrt(8). So, can sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ≥a +4?

Square both sides:

a^2 +4(b +2) ≥(a +4)^2

Expand RHS: a^2 +8a +16

Subtract a^2:

4b +8 ≥8a +16

Simplify:

4b ≥8a +8

Divide by 4:

b ≥2a +2

But since b ≤1, and 2a +2 ≥2 (since a ≥0), this is impossible.

Therefore, both conditions p ≥2 and q ≤-2 lead to impossible inequalities, meaning that the quartic equation cannot have real roots through these means.

Wait, but earlier, when a=1, b=0, the quartic equation had real roots, so something is wrong here.

Wait, when a=1, b=0:

Compute p = [1 + sqrt(1 +4(0 +2))]/2 = [1 + sqrt(9)] /2 = (1 +3)/2=2.

So, p=2.

So, in this case, p=2, which is the boundary case.

So, when p=2, the quadratic \(x^2 +2x +1=0\) has a double root at x=-1, which is real.

So, in this case, the quartic equation has a real root.

Similarly, for q, when a=1, b=0:

q = [1 - sqrt(1 +8)] /2 = [1 -3]/2 = -1.

So, q=-1, which is not ≤-2. So, quadratic \(x^2 -x +1=0\) has complex roots.

So, in this case, quartic equation has a real root only because p=2, which is the boundary.

Therefore, the condition is p=2, which occurs when:

[ a + sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ] /2 =2

Multiply by 2:

a + sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) =4

Subtract a:

sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) =4 -a

Square both sides:

a^2 +4b +8 =16 -8a +a^2

Simplify:

4b +8 =16 -8a

So,

4b =8 -8a

Divide by 4:

b =2 -2a

So, b =2 -2a

Since a and b are in [0,1], let's check the range:

When a=0, b=2, which is outside the square.

When a=1, b=0, which is on the square.

Therefore, the line b=2 -2a intersects the square at (a,b)=(1,0) and (a,b)=(0.5,1).

Therefore, the set S is the line segment from (1,0) to (0.5,1).

Therefore, S is a line segment with length sqrt[(1 -0.5)^2 + (0 -1)^2] = sqrt[0.25 +1]=sqrt(1.25)= (sqrt5)/2≈1.118.

But the problem says "Determine the area of the graph of S."

But S is a line segment, which has area zero. So, the area is zero.

But in the problem statement, it might have been a trick question because the area is zero, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, going back, when I set p=2, I get b=2 -2a.

Similarly, when I set q=-2, which would be another condition for real roots.

Wait, let me compute q=-2:

[ a - sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) ] /2 = -2

Multiply by 2:

a - sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) = -4

Rearranged:

sqrt(a^2 +4(b +2)) =a +4

Square both sides:

a^2 +4b +8 =a^2 +8a +16

Simplify:

4b +8=8a +16

4b=8a +8

Divide by 4:

b=2a +2

But since b ≤1, 2a +2 ≤1 =>2a ≤-1, which is impossible because a ≥0.

Therefore, only the condition p=2 gives the real roots.

Hence, S is the line segment from (1,0) to (0.5,1), which has zero area.

But let me check for another a, b on this line.

Take a=0.75, b=2 -2*(0.75)=0.5.

So, a=0.75, b=0.5.

Then, the quartic equation is \(x^4 +0.75x^3 -0.5x^2 +0.75x +1=0\)

Does this have real roots?

Testing x=-1:1 -0.75 -0.5 -0.75 +1=1 -0.75=0.25; 0.25 -0.5= -0.25; -0.25 -0.75= -1; -1 +1=0.

So, x=-1 is a root.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (x +1)(x^3 -0.25x^2 -1.25x -1)=0.

So, x=-1 is a real root.

Therefore, (a,b)=(0.75,0.5) is in S.

Therefore, it seems that the set S is indeed the line segment from (1,0) to (0.5,1), which has area zero.

But the problem says "the area of the graph of S." Hmm, maybe it's referring to the area in the a-b plane, which is zero.

But in the problem statement, it's stated as "the equation [...] has at least one real root. Determine the area of the graph of S." So, probably, the answer is zero.

But in the initial problem, S is a set of points (a,b) with a,b in [0,1]. If S is a line segment, its area is zero.

But wait, the problem says "the graph of S." Maybe in the a-b plane, the set S is the line segment, and its area is zero.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{0}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
</think>

To determine the area of the set \( S \) consisting of points \((a, b)\) such that the polynomial equation \(x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + ax + 1 = 0\) has at least one real root, we start by analyzing the polynomial.

Given the polynomial is palindromic, we use the substitution \( y = x + \frac{1}{x} \). This transforms the polynomial into a quadratic equation in \( y \):

\[ y^2 + ay - (b + 2) = 0 \]

For the polynomial to have at least one real root, the quadratic equation in \( y \) must have a solution \( y \geq 2 \) or \( y \leq -2 \). 

1. **Quadratic in \( y \) Analysis**:
   - The discriminant of the quadratic equation is non-negative, ensuring real roots for \( y \).
   - We need to check if the roots \( y \) of the quadratic equation satisfy \( y \geq 2 \) or \( y \leq -2 \).

2. **Roots of the Quadratic Equation**:
   - The roots are given by \( y = \frac{-a \pm \sqrt{a^2 + 4(b + 2)}}{2} \).
   - For \( y \geq 2 \), we find it is impossible because the required inequality leads to a contradiction.
   - For \( y \leq -2 \), we analyze the smaller root \( y_1 \).

3. **Condition for \( y \leq -2 \)**:
   - The smaller root \( y_1 \) must be less than or equal to -2.
   - This leads to the condition \( 2a + b = 2 \).

4. **Geometric Interpretation**:
   - The line \( 2a + b = 2 \) intersects the square \([0,1] \times [0,1]\) at points \((1, 0)\) and \((0.5, 1)\).
   - This line segment is the set \( S \).

5. **Area Calculation**:
   - The set \( S \) is a line segment, which has zero area in the plane.

Thus, the area of the graph of \( S \) is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
