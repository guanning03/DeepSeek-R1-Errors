Question:
Two numbers, $x$ and $y$ are selected at random from the interval $(0,3)$.  What is the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ exists?

Correct Answer:
If a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ exists, the triangle inequality must be satisfied, which states that $x+y>1$, $1+x>y$, and $1+y>x$.  We can draw a plane with $x$ and $y$ axes and shade in the area where all of these inequalities are satisfied.

[asy]
draw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3));
draw((0,0)--(0,3));
label("$x$",(3,0),S);
label("$y$",(0,3),W);
fill((1,0)--(3,2)--(3,3)--(2,3)--(0,1)--cycle,gray(.7));
draw((1,-.1)--(1,.1));
draw((2,-.1)--(2,.1));
draw((.1,1)--(-.1,1));
draw((.1,2)--(-.1,2));

draw((1,0)--(0,1));
draw((1,0)--(3,2));
draw((0,1)--(2,3));

[/asy]

The total area of the square is $3^2=9$.  The area of the unshaded region is $2^2+1/2=9/2$.  Thus, the shaded area is $9/2$ and the probability that such a triangle exists is $(9/2)/9=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where two numbers, x and y, are selected at random from the interval (0,3). I need to find the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, x, and y can exist. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that for three lengths to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. That is, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, for sides 1, x, and y, the following conditions must all be true:

1. 1 + x > y
2. 1 + y > x
3. x + y > 1

So, all three of these inequalities have to hold for a triangle to exist with sides 1, x, and y.

Now, since x and y are chosen from the interval (0,3), I can represent this problem geometrically. The set of all possible (x, y) pairs can be visualized as a square in the coordinate plane with sides of length 3. So, the square would have corners at (0,0), (3,0), (0,3), and (3,3).

The total area of this square is 3*3 = 9, which represents all possible outcomes when choosing x and y. So, the probability we're looking for is the area of the region where the triangle inequalities are satisfied divided by 9.

Alright, so I need to find the area where:

1. 1 + x > y
2. 1 + y > x
3. x + y > 1

Let me analyze each inequality one by one.

Starting with the first inequality, 1 + x > y. This can be rewritten as y < x + 1. So, on the coordinate plane, this is the region below the line y = x + 1.

Similarly, the second inequality, 1 + y > x, can be rewritten as x < y + 1. This is the region below the line x = y + 1.

The third inequality is x + y > 1. This can be rewritten as y > 1 - x. So, this is the region above the line y = 1 - x.

So, the area we are interested in is the intersection of all three regions defined by these inequalities within the square [0,3] x [0,3].

Let me sketch this mentally. The square goes from (0,0) to (3,3). The line y = x + 1 starts at (0,1) and goes up to (2,3). Similarly, the line x = y + 1 is the same as y = x - 1, but it starts at (1,0) and goes up to (3,2). The line y = 1 - x starts at (0,1) and goes down to (1,0). So, I need to find the overlapping region where y < x + 1, x < y + 1, and y > 1 - x.

Hmm, this seems like a polygon bounded by these lines. Let me try to find the vertices of this polygon.

First, let's find the intersection points of these lines.

1. Intersection of y = x + 1 and y = 1 - x:
Set x + 1 = 1 - x => 2x = 0 => x = 0, then y = 1. So, point (0,1).

2. Intersection of y = x + 1 and x = y + 1 (which is y = x - 1):
Set x + 1 = x - 1. Wait, this simplifies to 1 = -1, which is impossible. So, these two lines are parallel? No, wait, actually, they are not parallel because one is y = x + 1 and the other is y = x - 1. Wait, no, actually, if you set y = x + 1 and y = x - 1, they are parallel lines because they have the same slope. So, they never intersect. That means in the square, these two lines will intersect the boundaries.

3. Intersection of y = 1 - x and x = y + 1:
Set y = 1 - x and x = y + 1.

Substitute y from the first equation into the second: x = (1 - x) + 1 => x = 2 - x => 2x = 2 => x = 1, then y = 0. So, point (1,0).

4. Now, let's check where the lines y = x + 1 and y = 1 - x intersect the square.

For y = x + 1:
When x = 0, y = 1.
When y = 3, x = 2.

So, the line goes from (0,1) to (2,3).

For y = 1 - x:
When x = 0, y = 1.
When x = 1, y = 0.
When y = 0, x = 1.

Wait, but within the square [0,3] x [0,3], this line goes from (0,1) to (1,0).

Similarly, the line x = y + 1 is equivalent to y = x - 1.

When x = 1, y = 0.
When x = 3, y = 2.

So, this line goes from (1,0) to (3,2).

So, now, the region where all three inequalities are satisfied is bounded by:

- Above by y = x + 1 from (0,1) to (2,3)
- Below by y = 1 - x from (0,1) to (1,0)
- And below by y = x - 1 from (1,0) to (3,2)

Wait, so the region is a polygon with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (3,2), and (2,3)? Hmm, let me confirm.

Wait, let me think again. The overlapping region is bounded by three lines:

1. y = x + 1
2. y = 1 - x
3. y = x - 1

But within the square, these lines form a polygon. Let me try to find all intersection points within the square.

We have already found the intersections at (0,1) and (1,0). Now, let's see if y = x - 1 intersects y = x + 1 or y = 1 - x elsewhere.

But y = x - 1 and y = x + 1 are parallel, as mentioned before, so they don't intersect. Similarly, y = x - 1 and y = 1 - x intersect at (1,0), which we already have.

So, the region is a polygon with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (3,2), and (2,3). Wait, is that correct? Let me visualize.

From (0,1), following y = x + 1 up to (2,3). Then, from (2,3), how does the region continue? It should be bounded by y < x + 1 and y > 1 - x.

But wait, at (2,3), if I move along y = 3, but y is limited to 3. Also, x can go up to 3, but at x=3, y must be less than 4, but since y <= 3, so it's okay.

Wait, perhaps I got confused. Maybe the region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (3,2), and (2,3). Let me check.

Wait, if I plot the lines:

- Below y = x + 1: So, above this is the forbidden area.
- Above y = 1 - x: So, below this is the forbidden area.
- Below y = x - 1: Wait, no, the inequality is x < y + 1, which is y > x - 1.

Wait, maybe I need to correct my earlier analysis.

Wait, the second inequality is 1 + y > x, which is x < y + 1, which is y > x - 1.

So, the region is above y = x - 1.

So, combining all three inequalities:

1. y < x + 1
2. y > x - 1
3. y > 1 - x

So, the region is the intersection of these three areas.

So, in the square [0,3] x [0,3], the region is bounded below by y = max(1 - x, x - 1) and above by y = x + 1.

Hmm, maybe it's better to split the region into two parts: one where y is bounded below by 1 - x and above by x + 1, and the other where y is bounded below by x - 1 and above by x + 1.

But perhaps it's better to find the vertices of the polygon where all three inequalities meet.

So, let's find all intersection points of these three lines within the square.

We have already found:

- Intersection of y = x + 1 and y = 1 - x at (0,1)
- Intersection of y = x + 1 and y = x - 1: Not possible, they are parallel
- Intersection of y = x - 1 and y = 1 - x at (1,0)
- Intersection of y = x + 1 with y = 3: At x = 2, y = 3
- Intersection of y = x - 1 with x = 3: y = 2
- Intersection of y = 1 - x with x = 0: y = 1
- Intersection of y = 1 - x with y = 0: x = 1

So, putting this together, the region is a polygon with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (3,2), (2,3), and back to (0,1). Wait, but that seems like a five-sided figure, but actually, when connecting these points, perhaps it's a quadrilateral.

Wait, let me think. From (0,1), moving along y = x + 1 to (2,3). Then, from (2,3), moving along y = 3 (since x can go up to 3, but y is already 3) but wait, no, the region is bounded by y < x + 1, which at x = 3, y < 4, but since y can't exceed 3, it's still okay.

But the region is also bounded by y > 1 - x and y > x - 1. At x = 3, y > x - 1 = 2. So, at x = 3, y must be greater than 2 and less than 3 + 1 = 4, which is y < 4, but y can only go up to 3, so effectively, at x = 3, y is between 2 and 3.

Wait, so the region is a polygon with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (3,2), (2,3), and back to (0,1). Hmm, that seems a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's a hexagon? No, let me think step by step.

First, at x = 0, y must be > 1 (from y > 1 - x) and < 1 (from y < x + 1). Wait, that can't be. At x = 0, y must satisfy both y > 1 and y < 1, which is impossible. So, actually, at x = 0, there is no region. So, perhaps the region starts at x = 0, but y must be >1 and <1, which is only a single point, which doesn't contribute to area.

Therefore, maybe the region starts at x = 1, but wait, let me see.

Wait, let me think about the boundaries.

We have three lines:

1. y = x + 1
2. y = x - 1
3. y = 1 - x

These lines divide the square into regions. The area where all three inequalities are satisfied is the intersection of y < x + 1, y > x - 1, and y > 1 - x.

So, to find the vertices of this region, we need to find the intersection points of these lines.

We have already found:

- Intersection of y = x + 1 and y = 1 - x at (0,1)
- Intersection of y = x + 1 and y = x - 1: Not possible
- Intersection of y = x - 1 and y = 1 - x at (1,0)
- Intersection of y = x + 1 with y = 3 at (2,3)
- Intersection of y = x - 1 with x = 3 at y = 2, so (3,2)
- Intersection of y = 1 - x with x = 0 at y =1, so (0,1)
- Intersection of y = 1 - x with y =0 at x=1, so (1,0)

So, the region is bounded by these points:

- From (0,1) to (2,3) along y = x + 1
- From (2,3) to (3,2) along y = 3 (since beyond x=2, y = x + 1 is above 3, which is the maximum y)
- From (3,2) to (1,0) along y = x - 1
- From (1,0) back to (0,1) along y = 1 - x

Wait, so the region is actually a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,1), (2,3), (3,2), and (1,0). Is that correct?

Wait, let me see. From (0,1), moving along y = x + 1 to (2,3). Then, from (2,3), moving along y = 3 to (3,3), but y can't exceed 3, but y is also bounded below by y > x -1.

At x = 3, y must be > 2. So, from (2,3), moving along y = 3 until x = 3, but that line is not part of the region because the lower bound is y > x - 1, which at x=3 is y > 2. So, the region from (2,3) to (3,2) is along y = x - 1, because at x =3, y must be greater than 2, so y = x -1 is the lower boundary.

Similarly, from (3,2), moving along y = x -1 to (1,0). Then, from (1,0), moving along y = 1 - x back to (0,1).

So, yes, the region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,1), (2,3), (3,2), and (1,0).

Now, to find the area of this quadrilateral, we can divide it into two triangles or use the shoelace formula.

Let me list the coordinates of the vertices in order:

1. (0,1)
2. (2,3)
3. (3,2)
4. (1,0)
5. Back to (0,1)

Wait, actually, it's a quadrilateral, so four vertices: (0,1), (2,3), (3,2), (1,0). So, four points.

Let me apply the shoelace formula.

The shoelace formula is:

Area = 1/2 |sum_{i=1 to n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|

Where the vertices are ordered, and the last vertex connects back to the first.

So, let me list the coordinates in order:

1. (0,1)
2. (2,3)
3. (3,2)
4. (1,0)
5. Back to (0,1)

So, compute the sum:

First, multiply x_i * y_{i+1} for each i:

(0 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (3 * 0) + (1 * 1) = 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 5

Then, multiply y_i * x_{i+1} for each i:

(1 * 2) + (3 * 3) + (2 * 1) + (0 * 0) = 2 + 9 + 2 + 0 = 13

Then, subtract the two sums: |5 - 13| = | -8 | = 8

Then, area is 1/2 * 8 = 4

Wait, so the area is 4? But the total area of the square is 9, so the probability is 4/9.

But wait, hold on. Let me double-check the shoelace formula because sometimes the order of the points matters.

Let me list the coordinates again in order:

1. (0,1)
2. (2,3)
3. (3,2)
4. (1,0)
5. (0,1)

Compute sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

(0*3) + (2*2) + (3*0) + (1*1) = 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 5

Sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

(1*2) + (3*3) + (2*1) + (0*0) = 2 + 9 + 2 + 0 = 13

Difference: 5 - 13 = -8, absolute value 8, half is 4.

Hmm, so area is 4. So, probability is 4/9.

But wait, let me think. Is the shoelace formula correct here?

Alternatively, maybe I can divide the quadrilateral into two triangles.

Let me split the quadrilateral into two triangles: one from (0,1) to (2,3) to (3,2) and back to (0,1); and another triangle from (0,1) to (3,2) to (1,0) and back?

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, split the quadrilateral into two parts: from (0,1) to (2,3) to (3,2) to (1,0) to (0,1). Alternatively, maybe it's a trapezoid or something else.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the area step by step.

First, from (0,1) to (2,3): this is a line with slope 1.

From (2,3) to (3,2): this is a line with slope (2-3)/(3-2) = -1.

From (3,2) to (1,0): slope is (0 - 2)/(1 - 3) = (-2)/(-2) = 1.

From (1,0) to (0,1): slope is (1 - 0)/(0 -1 )= -1.

So, actually, the figure is a kite-shaped quadrilateral, symmetric with respect to the line y = x.

Wait, is it a kite? Because two pairs of adjacent sides are equal.

From (0,1) to (2,3): distance is sqrt((2)^2 + (2)^2) = sqrt(8) = 2√2.

From (2,3) to (3,2): sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2).

From (3,2) to (1,0): sqrt(4 + 4) = sqrt(8) = 2√2.

From (1,0) to (0,1): sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2).

So, opposite sides are equal, so it's a parallelogram. Hmm, but when I calculated the area via shoelace formula, I got 4, but let me confirm.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the vector cross product method.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the shoelace formula because the order of the points might have been wrong.

Wait, let me check the shoelace formula again.

Given the coordinates in order:

(0,1), (2,3), (3,2), (1,0), (0,1)

Compute the sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

(0*3) + (2*2) + (3*0) + (1*1) = 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 5

Compute the sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

(1*2) + (3*3) + (2*1) + (0*0) = 2 + 9 + 2 + 0 = 13

Then, |5 - 13| = 8, so area = 8 / 2 = 4. Hmm, seems consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area by subtracting the areas outside the quadrilateral from the square.

So, the total area is 9. The area where the triangle cannot be formed is the area outside the quadrilateral.

So, perhaps the area where at least one of the inequalities is violated is the union of the regions where:

1. y <= x + 1
2. y <= x - 1
3. y <= 1 - x

But actually, it's the regions where any of the inequalities are not satisfied. So, the complement regions.

Wait, maybe it's simpler to stick with the shoelace formula result.

But just to make sure, let me compute the area step by step.

First, let's consider the region y < x + 1, y > x - 1, and y > 1 - x.

So, in the square [0,3] x [0,3], the area satisfying all three inequalities is the intersection of three regions:

1. Below y = x + 1
2. Above y = x - 1
3. Above y = 1 - x

So, the area can be found by integrating over x from 0 to 3, the range of y that satisfies all three inequalities.

But that might be a bit complex, but let me try.

For a given x, y must satisfy:

max(x - 1, 1 - x) < y < x + 1

But since x and y are in [0,3], we need to consider this for different ranges of x.

Let me find the ranges of x where these max and min functions behave differently.

Find the points where x - 1 = 1 - x. So, x - 1 = 1 - x => 2x = 2 => x = 1.

So, for x < 1, which is x in [0,1):

max(x - 1, 1 - x) = 1 - x, since 1 - x > x -1 when x < 1.

For x >=1, max(x -1, 1 -x) = x -1.

Similarly, the upper bound y < x +1.

So, the area can be split into two integrals:

1. From x = 0 to x =1:

y ranges from 1 - x to x +1.

2. From x =1 to x =3:

y ranges from x -1 to x +1.

But also, we must ensure that y does not exceed 3.

So, in the first integral, from x=0 to x=1:

y ranges from 1 -x to x +1. Since x +1 <= 2 when x <=1, which is less than 3, so no issue.

In the second integral, from x=1 tox=3:

y ranges from x -1 to x +1. However, when x +1 exceeds 3, which happens when x > 2, so for x >2, y <3.

So, we can split the second integral into two parts:

1. From x=1 tox=2:

y ranges from x -1 to x +1.

2. From x=2 tox=3:

y ranges from x -1 to 3.

So, total area is:

Integral from 0 to1 of (x +1 - (1 -x)) dx

Plus integral from1 to2 of (x +1 - (x -1)) dx

Plus integral from2 to3 of (3 - (x -1)) dx

Compute each integral.

First integral (0 to1):

(x +1 - (1 -x)) = x +1 -1 +x = 2x

Integral of 2x dx from0 to1 is [x^2] from0 to1 =1 -0=1

Second integral (1 to2):

(x +1 - (x -1)) =x +1 -x +1=2

Integral of 2 dx from1 to2 is 2*(2 -1)=2*1=2

Third integral (2 to3):

(3 - (x -1)) =3 -x +1=4 -x

Integral of (4 -x) dx from2 to3 is [4x - (x^2)/2] from2 to3

Compute at3: 4*3 - (9)/2=12 -4.5=7.5

Compute at2: 4*2 - (4)/2=8 -2=6

So, the integral is 7.5 -6=1.5

Therefore, total area is 1 +2 +1.5=4.5

Wait, but earlier, using shoelace formula, I got 4. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, but 4.5 is the area?

But wait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake in splitting the integrals.

Wait, let me think again.

From x=0 tox=1:

y ranges from1 -x to x +1. So, the vertical strip width is (x +1) - (1 -x)=2x.

Integral: ∫0^1 2x dx = [x^2]0^1=1

From x=1 tox=2:

y ranges fromx -1 tox +1. So, vertical strip width is (x +1) - (x -1)=2.

Integral: ∫1^2 2 dx=2*(2 -1)=2

From x=2 tox=3:

y ranges fromx -1 to3. So, vertical strip width is3 - (x -1)=4 -x.

Integral: ∫2^3 (4 -x)dx= [4x - (x^2)/2] from2 to3

At3: 12 -4.5=7.5

At2: 8 -2=6

So, 7.5 -6=1.5

So, total area=1 +2 +1.5=4.5

But wait, earlier shoelace formula gave me 4. So, which is correct?

Wait, maybe my shoelace formula was wrong because I didn't account for something.

Wait, let me recast the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps using geometric shapes to compute the area.

The quadrilateral has vertices at (0,1), (2,3), (3,2), and (1,0). So, perhaps it's a trapezoid? Wait, no, because the sides are not necessarily parallel.

Wait, let's plot it.

From (0,1) to (2,3): that's a line with slope 1.

From (2,3) to (3,2): slope -1.

From (3,2) to (1,0): slope 1.

From (1,0) to (0,1): slope -1.

So, it's a four-sided figure with two pairs of sides with slope 1 and -1.

So, actually, it's a parallelogram.

Because opposite sides have the same slope.

Slope from (0,1) to (2,3) is (3-1)/(2-0)=2/2=1.

Slope from (3,2) to (1,0) is (0-2)/(1-3)=(-2)/(-2)=1.

Similarly, slope from (2,3) to (3,2) is (2-3)/(3-2)=(-1)/1=-1.

Slope from (1,0) to (0,1) is (1-0)/(0-1)=1/(-1)=-1.

So, yes, it's a parallelogram with sides of slope 1 and -1.

So, the area can be calculated as the base times height.

But in a parallelogram, area = base * height.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area of a parallelogram given two adjacent sides.

Wait, vectors.

From (0,1) to (2,3): vector is (2,2)

From (0,1) to (1,0): vector is (1,-1)

The area is the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

So, vector a = (2,2), vector b = (1,-1)

Cross product in 2D is |a_x b_y - a_y b_x| = |2*(-1) - 2*1| = |-2 -2| = |-4| = 4

So, area is 4.

Which is consistent with the shoelace formula result.

Wait, but earlier, when I calculated using integrals, I got 4.5. So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps my integral approach was incorrect.

Wait, let me re-examine the integral approach.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the limits or the functions.

Wait, the area is defined by y > max(x -1, 1 -x) and y < x +1.

So, for x in [0,1), y ranges from1 -x to x +1.

For x in [1,3], y ranges fromx -1 tox +1, but y cannot exceed3.

So, from1 to2, y ranges fromx -1 tox +1, which is fine because x +1 <=3 whenx <=2.

But from2 to3, y ranges fromx -1 to3.

Wait, but the shoelace formula and the cross product both give 4, while the integral gave 4.5. So, something is wrong.

Wait, let me recast the problem.

Perhaps, the region is not a parallelogram, but a different quadrilateral, and the shoelace formula was applied incorrectly because of an incorrect ordering of the points.

Wait, let me list the points in the correct order for shoelace formula.

The quadrilateral is:

(0,1), (2,3), (3,2), (1,0), back to (0,1). So, in order, going around the shape.

Wait, but perhaps in the shoelace formula, the order of the points is important, either clockwise or counterclockwise.

Wait, let me try to list them in clockwise order:

Start at (0,1), move to (1,0), then to (3,2), then to (2,3), back to (0,1).

Wait, let's see:

1. (0,1)
2. (1,0)
3. (3,2)
4. (2,3)
5. (0,1)

Compute shoelace formula now.

Sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

(0*0) + (1*2) + (3*3) + (2*1) = 0 + 2 +9 +2=13

Sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

(1*1) + (0*3) + (2*2) + (3*0)=1 +0 +4 +0=5

Difference: |13 -5|=8

Area: 8 /2=4

Same result. So, shoelace formula is correct.

But then, why does the integral approach give 4.5?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the integral limits.

Wait, in the integral approach, I considered three parts:

1. x=0 to1: y from1 -x tox +1, which is correct.

2. x=1 to2: y fromx -1 tox +1, correct.

3. x=2 to3: y fromx -1 to3, correct.

But maybe in x=2 to3, the upper bound is min(x +1,3). Since x +1 atx=2 is3, and forx=2 tox=3, x +1 exceeds3, so y upper bound is3. So, y ranges fromx -1 to3.

But let's compute the area again:

First integral:

x=0 tox=1: integral of (x +1 - (1 -x)) dx= integral of2x dx= [x^2]0^1=1

Second integral:

x=1 tox=2: integral of (x +1 - (x -1))dx=integral of2dx=2*(2-1)=2

Third integral:

x=2 tox=3: integral of (3 - (x -1))dx=integral of(4 -x)dx= [4x - (x^2)/2] from2 to3

Atx=3: 12 -4.5=7.5

Atx=2:8 -2=6

Difference:7.5 -6=1.5

Total area:1+2+1.5=4.5

Wait, but shoelace formula says 4.

Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps because the area defined by the inequalities is actually only 4, and the integral approach might have included some regions outside the square or something.

Wait, no, because the square is [0,3]x[0,3], and we're integrating within that.

Wait, maybe the integral is correct, but the shoelace formula is wrong because the quadrilateral is not as I thought.

Wait, let me see. The vertices are (0,1), (2,3), (3,2), (1,0). So, if I connect (0,1) to (2,3) to (3,2) to (1,0), and back to (0,1), does that form a quadrilateral without overlapping?

Alternatively, maybe it's a self-intersecting quadrilateral, but no, because the points are ordered such that the edges don't cross.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the area using vectors.

Compute vectors from (0,1):

Vector to (2,3): (2,2)

Vector to (1,0): (1,-1)

Compute the area of the parallelogram formed by these vectors, which is |(2)(-1) - (2)(1)|= |-2 -2|=4

So, area is4.

But the integral approach gave me4.5. So, now I'm confused.

Wait, another way: perhaps the region is not a quadrilateral but a different shape.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the inequalities.

Wait, think about when x=0, y must be>1 and <1, which is impossible, so the region starts at some x>0.

Wait, let's solve for when y=1 -x and y=x -1 intersect.

Set 1 -x =x -1 =>1 -x =x -1 => 2 =2x =>x=1.

So, at x=1, both lines meet at y=0.

Wait, so in fact, when x=1, y=0 is the intersection of y=1 -x and y=x -1.

But when x=0, y=1 -x=1, and y=x -1=-1, which is outside the square.

So, the region is bounded by y=1 -x from (0,1) to (1,0), then by y=x -1 from (1,0) to (3,2), but wait, no.

Wait, no, wait, when x=1, y=x -1=0, which is a point.

Wait, perhaps the region is bounded by:

- From (0,1) to (2,3): y=x +1

- From (2,3) to (3,2): y=3 -x + something.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the area as the union of two regions:

1. The area above y=1 -x and below y=x +1, for x from0 to1.

2. The area above y=x -1 and below y=x +1, for x from1 to2.

3. The area above y=x -1 and below y=3, forx from2 to3.

But when I integrate, I get 1 +2 +1.5=4.5.

But shoelace formula with the given vertices gives4.

Wait, perhaps the integral is counting some area outside the actual region.

Wait, let me think: in the integral approach, for x from1 to2, y ranges fromx -1 tox +1. But in reality, y also must be above1 -x.

Wait, but for x from1 to2, 1 -x is negative, so y must be greater thanx -1, which is positive, so the lower bound isx -1.

Similarly, for x from0 to1, 1 -x is positive, but also greater thanx -1, since x -1 is negative.

So, perhaps the integral approach is correct, but the shoelace formula is wrong because I listed the points incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps in the shoelace formula, the points are not ordered correctly.

Let me try a different ordering.

Let me list the points in the order: (0,1), (1,0), (3,2), (2,3), back to (0,1).

Compute shoelace formula:

Sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

(0*0) + (1*2) + (3*3) + (2*1) =0 +2 +9 +2=13

Sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

(1*1) + (0*3) + (2*2) + (3*0)=1 +0 +4 +0=5

Area=|13 -5| /2=8/2=4

Same as before.

Hmm, so why is the integral approach giving me4.5?

Wait, perhaps the shoelace formula is correct, and the integral approach is wrong.

Wait, let's calculate the area using another method.

Perhaps, the region is a polygon with vertices at (0,1), (2,3), (3,2), and (1,0).

So, let's compute the area by dividing it into two triangles.

First triangle: (0,1), (2,3), (1,0)

Second triangle: (0,1), (1,0), (3,2)

Compute area of both triangles and add them.

First triangle: (0,1), (2,3), (1,0)

Using shoelace formula for this triangle:

Coordinates:

(0,1), (2,3), (1,0), back to (0,1)

Sum x_i y_{i+1}:

0*3 +2*0 +1*1=0 +0 +1=1

Sum y_i x_{i+1}:

1*2 +3*1 +0*0=2 +3 +0=5

Area=|1 -5| /2=4/2=2

Second triangle: (0,1), (1,0), (3,2)

Using shoelace formula:

Coordinates:

(0,1), (1,0), (3,2), back to (0,1)

Sum x_i y_{i+1}:

0*0 +1*2 +3*1=0 +2 +3=5

Sum y_i x_{i+1}:

1*1 +0*3 +2*0=1 +0 +0=1

Area=|5 -1| /2=4/2=2

Total area=2 +2=4

So, that's consistent with shoelace formula.

But the integral approach gave me4.5.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the integral limits.

Wait, let me re-examine the integral setup.

I divided the integral into three parts:

1. x=0 tox=1: y from1 -x tox +1

2. x=1 tox=2: y fromx -1 tox +1

3. x=2 tox=3: y fromx -1 to3

But perhaps the region isn't correctly covered.

Wait, maybe for x from2 to3, y ranges fromx -1 to3, but also needs to satisfy y <x +1.

But for x from2 to3, x +1 ranges from3 to4, but since y <=3, it's automatically less than x +1 for x >=2.

So, y ranges fromx -1 to3.

So, the integral from2 to3 is correct.

Wait, so why is the integral giving4.5 instead of4?

Wait, maybe my mistake is in splitting the integral into three parts when it can be done in two.

Wait, perhaps the area is actually a polygon with four sides, but the integral is adding regions outside the polygon.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I need to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the area using geometric shapes.

Let me think of the region as the intersection of y <x +1, y >x -1, and y >1 -x.

So, the region is bounded above by y=x +1, below by y=x -1 and y=1 -x.

So, the area can be calculated as the integral from x=0 tox=3 of (upper bound - lower bound) dx, but considering where the lower bound switches from y=1 -x toy=x -1.

So, the region is divided into two parts:

1. Fromx=0 tox=1: lower bound is1 -x, upper bound isx +1.

2. Fromx=1 tox=3: lower bound isx -1, upper bound isx +1.

But wait, whenx=1, y=1 -x=0 and y=x -1=0, so they meet there.

So, the integral is:

A = ∫₀¹ [(x +1) - (1 -x)] dx + ∫₁³ [(x +1) - (x -1)] dx

Compute first integral:

(x +1) - (1 -x) =2x

∫₀¹ 2x dx = [x²]₀¹ =1

Second integral:

(x +1) - (x -1)=2

∫₁³ 2 dx=2*(3 -1)=4

Total area=1 +4=5

Wait, but this contradicts both the shoelace formula and the triangle method.

Wait, what's going on here.

Wait, if I do this integral, I get5, but with shoelace and triangle decomposition, I get4.

So, clearly, there's a mistake.

Wait, let me think.

When x=0, y must be>1 and <1, which is impossible. So, the region starts atx=0, but since y must be>1, maybe the region actually starts atx=0, y=1, but also y must be>1 -x.

But 1 -x atx=0 is1, so y must be>1 and <1, which is impossible.

So, the first possible x where the region exists is when1 -x <x +1 and also y >x -1.

Wait, perhaps x has to be greater than something.

Wait, let's find where y=1 -x and y=x -1 intersect.

Set1 -x =x -1 =>2x=2 =>x=1.

So, atx=1, both lines meet.

So, forx <1,1 -x >x -1.

Forx >1,1 -x <x -1.

So, forx <1, the lower bound is1 -x, forx>1, lower bound isx -1.

So, forx from0 to1, y from1 -x tox +1.

Forx from1 to3, y fromx -1 tox +1.

But also, forx from1 to2, upper bound isx +1, but since y <=3, forx from2 to3, the upper bound is3.

Wait, so perhaps the area is split into two parts:

1. x from0 to1: integral of (x +1 - (1 -x)) dx=∫₀¹2x dx=1

2. x from1 to3: integral of (x +1 - (x -1)) dx=∫₁³2 dx=4

Total area=5.

But then, why do the shoelace formula and triangle decomposition give4.

Wait, perhaps the shoelace formula is incorrect because the region is not a simple polygon.

Wait, but when I went through the triangle decomposition, the area was4.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is adding regions outside the actual constraints.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is that whenx >2, y must be less than3, but also y must be less thanx +1, which is greater than3.

So, forx >2, y must be less than3, but also greater thanx -1.

So, forx from2 to3, y ranges fromx -1 to3.

So, the integral is:

∫₀¹2x dx + ∫₁²2 dx + ∫₂³(3 - (x -1)) dx

Which is:

1 +2 + ∫₂³(4 -x) dx=1 +2 + [4x - (x²)/2] from2 to3

Compute:

At3:12 -4.5=7.5

At2:8 -2=6

Difference:7.5 -6=1.5

Total area=1 +2 +1.5=4.5

But now, why is the triangle decomposition giving4.

Wait, perhaps the integral is overcounting.

Wait, the integral is considering the region fromx=0 tox=3, but in reality, the region is not a convex polygon but has some restrictions.

Wait, maybe the region is a union of two regions:

1. A quadrilateral from (0,1) to (2,3) to (3,2) to (1,0)

2. A triangle from (1,0) to (3,2) to (3,3) to (1,0). Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of this as a polygon with vertices at (0,1), (2,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (0,1). So, a quadrilateral.

Wait, so shoelace formula gives4, triangle decomposition gives4, but integral gives4.5.

Wait, now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to use another method.

Let me consider that the region is the intersection of three inequalities:

1. y <x +1

2. y >x -1

3. y >1 -x

So, the region is a polygon bounded by the lines:

- y =x +1

- y =x -1

- y =1 -x

And within the square [0,3]x[0,3]

So, the intersection points are:

(0,1), (2,3), (3,2), (1,0)

So, the polygon is a quadrilateral with these four points.

Therefore, the area is4, as computed by shoelace formula and triangle decomposition.

Therefore, the probability is4/9.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a four-sided figure with vertices at (0,1), (2,3), (3,2), (1,0), and compute the area as4.

Therefore, the probability is4/9.

Hence, the answer is4/9.

**Final Answer**
The probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, \(x\), and \(y\) exists is \boxed{\dfrac{4}{9}}.
</think>

To determine the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, \(x\), and \(y\) exists, we need to check the triangle inequality conditions:

1. \(1 + x > y\)
2. \(1 + y > x\)
3. \(x + y > 1\)

Since \(x\) and \(y\) are selected from the interval \((0, 3)\), we represent this problem geometrically in the coordinate plane with \(x\) and \(y\) as coordinates. The total area of the square is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).

The regions where the triangle inequalities are satisfied are:
1. \(y < x + 1\)
2. \(y > x - 1\)
3. \(y > 1 - x\)

These inequalities define a quadrilateral with vertices at \((0, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 2)\), and \((1, 0)\). Using the shoelace formula to find the area of this quadrilateral:

1. List the coordinates in order: \((0, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 2)\), \((1, 0)\), and back to \((0, 1)\).
2. Compute the sum of \(x_i y_{i+1}\):
   \[
   0 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. Compute the sum of \(y_i x_{i+1}\):
   \[
   1 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 0 = 2 + 9 + 2 + 0 = 13
   \]
4. The area is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} |5 - 13| = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4
   \]

Thus, the area of the region where the triangle inequalities are satisfied is 4. The probability is the area of this region divided by the total area of the square:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{4}{9}
\]

The final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{4}{9}}.
