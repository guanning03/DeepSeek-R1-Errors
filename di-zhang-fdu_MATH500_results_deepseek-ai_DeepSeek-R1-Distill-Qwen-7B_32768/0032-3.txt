Question:
Find the sum of all complex solutions of the equation
\[\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\]

Correct Answer:
We can add 4 to both sides to get
\[\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + 1 + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + 1 + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + 1 + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} + 1 = 2010x.\]This simplifies to
\[\frac{x^2}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x.\]We see that $x = 0$ is a solution (which does not affect our sum).  Otherwise, we can divide both sides by $x$:
\[\frac{x}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{x}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{x}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{x}{x^2 - 4} = 2010.\]Clearing the denominators, we get
\begin{align*}
&x(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + x(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + x(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + x(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) \\
&\quad = 2010(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4).
\end{align*}This expands to
\[4x^7 + \dotsb = 2010x^8 + \dotsb,\]where only terms that have degree 7 or greater are shown.  Then
\[2010x^8 - 4x^7 + \dotsb = 0,\]so by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $\frac{4}{2010} = \boxed{\frac{2}{1005}}.$

Gold:

Wrong Answer:
Okay, I have this equation to solve:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

I need to find the sum of all complex solutions. Hmm, complex solutions... So that includes real solutions as well, right? But since the equation is a bit complicated, I might have to manipulate it to find a polynomial equation whose roots are the solutions to this problem.

First, let me think about how to handle the left side. It has four terms, each with a different denominator: \(x^2 - 1\), \(x^2 - 2\), \(x^2 - 3\), and \(x^2 - 4\). Each denominator is of the form \(x^2 - k\), which can be factored as \((x - \sqrt{k})(x + \sqrt{k})\). But since we're dealing with complex solutions, maybe factoring isn't the best approach.

Wait, maybe I can rewrite each term as a function of \(x^2\). Let me denote \(y = x^2\), so each denominator becomes \(y - k\), where \(k\) is 1, 2, 3, 4. So the left-hand side (LHS) becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{y - 1} + \frac{2}{y - 2} + \frac{3}{y - 3} + \frac{4}{y - 4}.
\]

So now, the equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{y - 1} + \frac{2}{y - 2} + \frac{3}{y - 3} + \frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Hmm, so if I can write this in terms of \(y\), maybe I can relate it to \(x\) and then form a polynomial equation.

But before that, let me think about the right-hand side (RHS): \(2010x - 4\). That's a linear function in \(x\). Since the LHS is a function of \(y = x^2\), which is quadratic, perhaps I can manipulate them to form an equation in \(x\).

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire equation as a function of \(x\) and try to bring everything to one side, then find a common denominator. However, that might be messy since there are four different denominators, each linear in \(x^2\). Let me see.

Another approach: perhaps consider that each term on the LHS is of the form \(\frac{k}{x^2 - k}\). So, if I let \(x^2 = t\), then each term becomes \(\frac{k}{t - k}\). So, the LHS is:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{t - k}
\]

where \(t = x^2\). So, the equation becomes:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{t - k} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can combine the terms on the LHS first.

Let me try to combine the fractions on the LHS. To do that, I need a common denominator, which would be \((t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4)\). So, let's write each term with this common denominator:

First term: \(\frac{1}{t - 1}\) becomes \(\frac{(t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4)}{(t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4)}\).

Similarly, the second term: \(\frac{2}{t - 2}\) becomes \(\frac{2(t - 1)(t - 3)(t - 4)}{(t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4)}\).

Third term: \(\frac{3}{t - 3}\) becomes \(\frac{3(t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 4)}{(t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4)}\).

Fourth term: \(\frac{4}{t - 4}\) becomes \(\frac{4(t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3)}{(t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4)}\).

So, adding all these together:

Numerator = \( (t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4) + 2(t - 1)(t - 3)(t - 4) + 3(t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 4) + 4(t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3) \).

Denominator = \((t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4)\).

So, the LHS is equal to:

\[
\frac{\text{Numerator}}{\text{Denominator}} = 2010x - 4.
\]

So, cross-multiplying, we get:

\[
\text{Numerator} = (2010x - 4) \times \text{Denominator}.
\]

That's going to give a polynomial equation. Since \(t = x^2\), which is degree 2, and the denominator is a quartic (degree 4), the numerator will also be a quartic. Multiplying by \(2010x - 4\) will result in a quintic (degree 5) equation. Then, we can write the equation as a quintic in \(x\), which is a fifth-degree polynomial. However, quintic equations don't generally have solutions in radicals, but since we're asked for the sum of all complex solutions, we can use Vieta's formula.

Vieta's formula tells us that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is equal to the negative coefficient of the term with degree one less than the polynomial divided by the leading coefficient.

But before that, I need to make sure that the equation is written in standard polynomial form. So, let's first compute the numerator.

Let me denote the numerator as N:

\[
N = (t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4) + 2(t - 1)(t - 3)(t - 4) + 3(t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 4) + 4(t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3).
\]

Let me compute each of these four terms separately.

First term: \(A = (t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4)\).

Let me compute \(A\):

First, compute \((t - 2)(t - 3)\):

\[
(t - 2)(t - 3) = t^2 - 5t + 6.
\]

Then, multiply by \((t - 4)\):

\[
(t^2 - 5t + 6)(t - 4) = t^3 - 4t^2 - 5t^2 + 20t + 6t - 24 = t^3 - 9t^2 + 26t - 24.
\]

So, \(A = t^3 - 9t^2 + 26t - 24\).

Second term: \(B = 2(t - 1)(t - 3)(t - 4)\).

First compute \((t - 1)(t - 3)\):

\[
(t - 1)(t - 3) = t^2 - 4t + 3.
\]

Multiply by \((t - 4)\):

\[
(t^2 - 4t + 3)(t - 4) = t^3 - 4t^2 - 4t^2 + 16t + 3t - 12 = t^3 - 8t^2 + 19t - 12.
\]

Multiply by 2:

\[
B = 2t^3 - 16t^2 + 38t - 24.
\]

Third term: \(C = 3(t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 4)\).

Compute \((t - 1)(t - 2)\):

\[
(t - 1)(t - 2) = t^2 - 3t + 2.
\]

Multiply by \((t - 4)\):

\[
(t^2 - 3t + 2)(t - 4) = t^3 - 4t^2 - 3t^2 + 12t + 2t - 8 = t^3 - 7t^2 + 14t - 8.
\]

Multiply by 3:

\[
C = 3t^3 - 21t^2 + 42t - 24.
\]

Fourth term: \(D = 4(t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3)\).

Compute \((t - 1)(t - 2)\):

\[
(t - 1)(t - 2) = t^2 - 3t + 2.
\]

Multiply by \((t - 3)\):

\[
(t^2 - 3t + 2)(t - 3) = t^3 - 3t^2 - 3t^2 + 9t + 2t - 6 = t^3 - 6t^2 + 11t - 6.
\]

Multiply by 4:

\[
D = 4t^3 - 24t^2 + 44t - 24.
\]

Now, sum up all four terms \(A + B + C + D\):

Let's add the coefficients term by term.

First, the \(t^3\) terms:

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

Total \(t^3\) coefficient: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

Next, \(t^2\) terms:

- A: -9
- B: -16
- C: -21
- D: -24

Total \(t^2\) coefficient: (-9) + (-16) + (-21) + (-24) = -70.

Next, \(t\) terms:

- A: 26
- B: 38
- C: 42
- D: 44

Total \(t\) coefficient: 26 + 38 + 42 + 44 = 150.

Constant terms:

- A: -24
- B: -24
- C: -24
- D: -24

Total constant term: (-24) * 4 = -96.

So, numerator N is:

\[
N = 10t^3 - 70t^2 + 150t - 96.
\]

Therefore, the equation is:

\[
10t^3 - 70t^2 + 150t - 96 = (2010x - 4)(t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4).
\]

But remember that \(t = x^2\). So, let me substitute \(t\) with \(x^2\):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\[
10(x^2)^3 - 70(x^2)^2 + 150x^2 - 96 = 10x^6 - 70x^4 + 150x^2 - 96.
\]

Right-hand side (RHS):

\[
(2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4).
\]

Hmm, this is going to be a polynomial of degree 9 on the RHS because each \((x^2 - k)\) is degree 2, and there are four of them, so 8, multiplied by \(2010x - 4\), which is degree 1, so total degree 9.

So, moving everything to one side, the equation becomes:

\[
10x^6 - 70x^4 + 150x^2 - 96 - (2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) = 0.
\]

This will result in a ninth-degree polynomial equation. However, Vieta's formula tells us that the sum of all roots (including complex ones) is equal to the negative coefficient of the \(x^8\) term divided by the coefficient of the \(x^9\) term.

But computing this ninth-degree polynomial seems extremely tedious. Maybe there's a smarter approach.

Wait a minute, let's think about the original equation:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Let me denote \(y = x^2\), so each denominator is \(y - k\), \(k = 1,2,3,4\). So, if I can write the equation as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{y - k} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Hmm, perhaps I can consider that for each term, \(\frac{k}{y - k}\), which can be rewritten as \(-\frac{k}{k - y}\). So:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 -\frac{k}{k - y} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Which is:

\[
-\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{k - y} = 2010x - 4.
\]

So,

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{k - y} = -2010x + 4.
\]

Hmm, maybe using the formula for the sum of such fractions.

Wait, I recall that:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{k}{k - y} = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{y}{k - y}\right) = n + y \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k - y}.
\]

Yes, because \(\frac{k}{k - y} = 1 + \frac{y}{k - y}\). So, applying this to our case where \(n = 4\):

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{k - y} = 4 + y \sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{1}{k - y}.
\]

So, substituting back into our equation:

\[
4 + y \sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{1}{k - y} = -2010x + 4.
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[
y \sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{1}{k - y} = -2010x.
\]

So, now, we have:

\[
y \sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{1}{k - y} = -2010x.
\]

But \(y = x^2\), so:

\[
x^2 \sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{1}{k - x^2} = -2010x.
\]

Let me write this as:

\[
x^2 \left( \frac{1}{1 - x^2} + \frac{1}{2 - x^2} + \frac{1}{3 - x^2} + \frac{1}{4 - x^2} \right) = -2010x.
\]

Hmm, maybe I can combine these fractions. Let me denote \(z = x^2\), so equation becomes:

\[
z \left( \frac{1}{1 - z} + \frac{1}{2 - z} + \frac{1}{3 - z} + \frac{1}{4 - z} \right) = -2010x.
\]

But \(z = x^2\), so \(x = \pm \sqrt{z}\). Hmm, not sure if helpful.

Wait, perhaps instead of writing it in terms of \(z\), let's think about combining the fractions on the left-hand side.

The sum inside the parentheses is:

\[
S = \frac{1}{1 - z} + \frac{1}{2 - z} + \frac{1}{3 - z} + \frac{1}{4 - z}.
\]

To combine these, I can write each term as \(-\frac{1}{z - 1}\), etc. So,

\[
S = -\left( \frac{1}{z - 1} + \frac{1}{z - 2} + \frac{1}{z - 3} + \frac{1}{z - 4} \right).
\]

So, the equation becomes:

\[
z \times (-S') = -2010x,
\]
where \(S' = \frac{1}{z - 1} + \frac{1}{z - 2} + \frac{1}{z - 3} + \frac{1}{z - 4}\).

Simplify:

\[
-z \times S' = -2010x \implies z \times S' = 2010x.
\]

So,

\[
z \left( \frac{1}{z - 1} + \frac{1}{z - 2} + \frac{1}{z - 3} + \frac{1}{z - 4} \right) = 2010x.
\]

Hmm, not sure if this is helpful.

Wait, maybe I can compute \(S'\):

Let me compute \(S'\):

\[
S' = \frac{1}{z - 1} + \frac{1}{z - 2} + \frac{1}{z - 3} + \frac{1}{z - 4}.
\]

Combine these fractions:

The common denominator is \((z - 1)(z - 2)(z - 3)(z - 4)\). So,

\[
S' = \frac{(z - 2)(z - 3)(z - 4) + (z - 1)(z - 3)(z - 4) + (z - 1)(z - 2)(z - 4) + (z - 1)(z - 2)(z - 3)}{(z - 1)(z - 2)(z - 3)(z - 4)}.
\]

Wait, that's similar to the numerator I had earlier. Indeed, in the previous calculation, the numerator was:

\[
10t^3 - 70t^2 + 150t - 96,
\]

where \(t = z\). So,

\[
S' = \frac{10z^3 - 70z^2 + 150z - 96}{(z - 1)(z - 2)(z - 3)(z - 4)}.
\]

So, our equation becomes:

\[
z \times \frac{10z^3 - 70z^2 + 150z - 96}{(z - 1)(z - 2)(z - 3)(z - 4)} = 2010x.
\]

But \(z = x^2\), so substituting back:

\[
x^2 \times \frac{10x^6 - 70x^4 + 150x^2 - 96}{(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)} = 2010x.
\]

Wait, that seems similar to the equation we had earlier. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't simplifying things. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, the original equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

I can consider moving all terms to the left-hand side:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.
\]

But then, each term is a rational function except for the linear term and the constant. Maybe I can combine the rational functions into a single fraction.

But that would require finding a common denominator, which is \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\). So, let's express each term with that denominator.

So, rewriting the equation:

\[
\frac{1 \cdot (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)}{(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)} - 2010x + 4 = 0.
\]

Earlier, I found that the numerator is \(10x^6 - 70x^4 + 150x^2 - 96\). So, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{10x^6 - 70x^4 + 150x^2 - 96}{(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)} - 2010x + 4 = 0.
\]

Let me denote the denominator as \(D = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\).

So, the equation is:

\[
\frac{N}{D} - 2010x + 4 = 0,
\]
where \(N = 10x^6 - 70x^4 + 150x^2 - 96\).

To combine these into a single equation, multiply both sides by \(D\):

\[
N - (2010x - 4)D = 0.
\]

So, the equation is:

\[
10x^6 - 70x^4 + 150x^2 - 96 - (2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) = 0.
\]

This is a ninth-degree polynomial equation, which is going to have nine roots (some possibly complex). We need the sum of all roots.

But to find the sum of roots of a polynomial, we can use Vieta's formula, which states that the sum is equal to \(-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\), where \(a_n\) is the leading coefficient and \(a_{n-1}\) is the coefficient of \(x^{n-1}\).

But computing this ninth-degree polynomial is going to be extremely time-consuming. Maybe I can figure out the coefficients without expanding the entire polynomial.

Wait, the key is that the coefficient of \(x^8\) in the entire expression \(N - (2010x - 4)D\) will determine the sum of the roots.

So, let me figure out the coefficient of \(x^8\) in the expansion of \(- (2010x - 4)D\). Because the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(N\) is zero (since \(N\) is a sixth-degree polynomial), so the coefficient of \(x^8\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from \(- (2010x - 4)D\).

So, let me compute the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(- (2010x - 4)D\).

First, expand \((2010x - 4)D\):

\(D = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\).

So, \(D\) is a quartic in \(x^2\). Let me denote \(D = (x^2 - a)(x^2 - b)(x^2 - c)(x^2 - d)\), where \(a, b, c, d = 1, 2, 3, 4\).

But actually, \(D\) is a polynomial in \(x\) of degree 8, since each \((x^2 - k)\) is degree 2, multiplied together four times, so \(2*4 = 8\).

So, \(D\) is an 8th-degree polynomial, and \((2010x - 4)D\) is a 9th-degree polynomial.

But I need the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(- (2010x - 4)D\), which is equivalent to \(-2010x \times D - 4 \times D\).

So, the coefficient of \(x^8\) comes from two sources:

1. The term \(-2010x \times D\): here, the coefficient of \(x^8\) will be \(-2010\) times the coefficient of \(x^7\) in \(D\).

2. The term \(-4 \times D\): here, the coefficient of \(x^8\) will be \(-4\) times the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(D\).

Therefore, to find the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(- (2010x - 4)D\), I need to know the coefficients of \(x^7\) and \(x^8\) in \(D\).

So, let's compute the coefficients of \(x^8\) and \(x^7\) in \(D = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\).

But \(D\) is a product of four quadratics, so when multiplied out, the highest degree is \(8\), and the coefficients can be determined by expanding.

However, expanding \(D\) is going to be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can note that \(D\) can be written as:

\[
D = [(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 4)][(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)] = (x^4 - 5x^2 + 4)(x^4 - 5x^2 + 6).
\]

Let me compute this product:

Let \(A = x^4 - 5x^2 + 4\), and \(B = x^4 - 5x^2 + 6\).

So, \(D = A \times B\).

Compute \(A \times B\):

\[
(x^4 - 5x^2 + 4)(x^4 - 5x^2 + 6) = (x^4 - 5x^2)^2 + (4 + 6)(x^4 - 5x^2) + 4 \times 6.
\]

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, it's \(A \times B = (x^4 - 5x^2 + 4)(x^4 - 5x^2 + 6)\). Let me perform the multiplication term by term.

First, multiply \(x^4\) with each term in \(B\):

- \(x^4 \times x^4 = x^8\)
- \(x^4 \times (-5x^2) = -5x^6\)
- \(x^4 \times 6 = 6x^4\)

Next, multiply \(-5x^2\) with each term in \(B\):

- \(-5x^2 \times x^4 = -5x^6\)
- \(-5x^2 \times (-5x^2) = 25x^4\)
- \(-5x^2 \times 6 = -30x^2\)

Next, multiply \(4\) with each term in \(B\):

- \(4 \times x^4 = 4x^4\)
- \(4 \times (-5x^2) = -20x^2\)
- \(4 \times 6 = 24\)

Now, combine all these terms:

- \(x^8\)
- \(-5x^6 -5x^6 = -10x^6\)
- \(6x^4 + 25x^4 + 4x^4 = 35x^4\)
- \(-30x^2 -20x^2 = -50x^2\)
- \(24\)

So, \(D = x^8 -10x^6 +35x^4 -50x^2 +24\).

Therefore, the coefficients of \(x^8\) and \(x^7\) in \(D\) are:

- Coefficient of \(x^8\): 1
- Coefficient of \(x^7\): 0 (since there is no \(x^7\) term)

So, going back to \(- (2010x - 4)D\):

The coefficient of \(x^8\) is:

- From \(-2010x \times D\): \(-2010\) times coefficient of \(x^7\) in \(D\) (which is 0) = 0.
- From \(-4 \times D\): \(-4\) times coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(D\) (which is 1) = -4.

Therefore, the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(- (2010x - 4)D\) is \(-4\).

But wait, the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(N\) is zero, so the coefficient of \(x^8\) in the entire equation \(N - (2010x - 4)D\) is \(-4\).

Therefore, in the polynomial equation:

\[
10x^6 - 70x^4 + 150x^2 - 96 - (2010x - 4)D = 0,
\]

the coefficient of \(x^8\) is \(-4\), and the coefficient of \(x^9\) is... Wait, hold on.

Wait, the polynomial is a 9th-degree polynomial because of the multiplication by \(x\) in \(-2010x D\). So, the highest degree is \(x^9\). So, in the entire equation, the coefficient of \(x^9\) is the coefficient from \(-2010x \times D\). Since \(D\) is degree 8, multiplying by \(x\) gives degree 9. So, the coefficient of \(x^9\) in \(-2010x D\) is \(-2010\) times the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(D\), which is 1, so \(-2010 * 1 = -2010\). Then, the coefficient of \(x^9\) in \(N\) is zero, so overall, the coefficient of \(x^9\) in the entire polynomial is \(-2010\).

But for Vieta's formula, the sum of roots is \(-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\), where \(a_n\) is the coefficient of \(x^n\) (which is 9 in this case), and \(a_{n-1}\) is the coefficient of \(x^8\), which is \(-4\).

Wait, let me confirm:

The polynomial equation is:

\[
P(x) = N - (2010x - 4)D = 0.
\]

We have:

- \(N\) is degree 6.
- \((2010x - 4)D\) is degree 9.
- So, \(P(x)\) is degree 9.

The leading term of \((2010x - 4)D\) is \(2010x \times x^8 = 2010x^9\). So, the leading term is \(2010x^9\), but since it's subtracted, it becomes \(-2010x^9\). Similarly, other terms may contribute to lower degrees.

Wait, no, hold on:

Wait, the leading term of \(- (2010x - 4)D\) is \(-2010x \times x^8 = -2010x^9\). The coefficient of \(x^9\) is \(-2010\).

Similarly, the coefficient of \(x^8\) is \(-4\), as computed earlier.

So, in \(P(x) = N - (2010x - 4)D\), the leading term is \(-2010x^9\), followed by \(-4x^8\), then the rest of the terms from \(N\) and \(D\).

But in reality, \(N\) only goes up to \(x^6\), so in \(P(x)\), the coefficients for \(x^7, x^6, \ldots\) are combinations from \(N\) and the expansion of \(- (2010x - 4)D\).

But for Vieta's formula, the sum of roots is determined only by the coefficients of \(x^9\) and \(x^8\). So, regardless of the other coefficients, the sum of roots is \(-\frac{a_8}{a_9}\), where \(a_8\) is the coefficient of \(x^8\) and \(a_9\) is the coefficient of \(x^9\).

So, as we found:

- \(a_9 = -2010\)
- \(a_8 = -4\)

Therefore, the sum of roots is:

\[
-\frac{a_8}{a_9} = -\frac{-4}{-2010} = -\frac{4}{2010} = -\frac{2}{1005} = -\frac{2}{1005}.
\]

Wait, but hold on. The original equation is \(P(x) = 0\), which is a 9th-degree polynomial. So, it has 9 roots (some possibly complex). The sum of all roots is \(-a_8 / a_9\). So, it's \(-(-4)/(-2010)\).

But wait, let me re-express that:

Sum of roots = \(- (a_8) / a_9\). But \(a_8\) is the coefficient of \(x^8\), which is \(-4\), and \(a_9\) is \(-2010\). So,

Sum = \(-(-4)/(-2010)\) = \(4 / (-2010)\) = \(-2/1005\).

Wait, so the sum is \(-2/1005\). Hmm, that seems like a very small number.

But let me double-check the calculations.

First, the coefficient of \(x^9\) in \(- (2010x - 4)D\) is \(-2010\), as the leading term is \(-2010x^9\).

The coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(- (2010x - 4)D\) is:

From \(-2010x \times D\): the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(D\) is 1, so \(-2010 * 1 = -2010\).

From \(-4 \times D\): the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(D\) is 1, so \(-4 * 1 = -4\).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the coefficient of \(x^8\) comes from two sources:

1. The term \(-2010x \times D\): the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(D\) is 1, so when multiplied by \(-2010x\), it becomes \(-2010x^9\) and \(-2010x \times 1x^8 = -2010x^9\). Wait, no, I think I confused something.

Wait, actually, when you multiply \(-2010x\) by \(D\), which is \(x^8 - 10x^6 + 35x^4 - 50x^2 + 24\), you get:

- \(-2010x \times x^8 = -2010x^9\)
- \(-2010x \times (-10x^6) = +20100x^7\)
- \(-2010x \times 35x^4 = -70350x^5\)
- \(-2010x \times (-50x^2) = +100500x^3\)
- \(-2010x \times 24 = -48240x\)

So, in this multiplication, the only term contributing to \(x^8\) is zero? Wait, no, because each term is multiplied by \(x\), so the degrees go up by 1. So, none of these terms contribute to \(x^8\); they contribute to \(x^9\), \(x^7\), etc.

Wait, so actually, the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(-2010x \times D\) is zero because that term only contributes to \(x^9\).

Similarly, the term \(-4 \times D\) contributes to \(x^8\) as \(-4\) times the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(D\), which is 1, so \(-4\).

Therefore, in the entire expression \(- (2010x - 4)D\), the coefficient of \(x^8\) is \(-4\), and the coefficient of \(x^9\) is \(-2010\).

Therefore, Vieta's formula tells us that the sum of the roots is \(-\frac{a_8}{a_9}\). But \(a_8 = -4\), and \(a_9 = -2010\). So,

Sum of roots = \(-\frac{-4}{-2010} = -\frac{4}{2010} = -\frac{2}{1005}\).

But wait, does this include all roots? The polynomial is degree 9, so it has 9 roots (counting multiplicity). However, the original equation may have some extraneous roots introduced when we multiplied both sides by \(D\), which is a denominator.

But in our case, when we moved everything to one side, we had:

\[
\frac{N}{D} - 2010x + 4 = 0.
\]

Which is equivalent to:

\[
\frac{N}{D} = 2010x - 4.
\]

So, as long as \(D \neq 0\), which is when \(x^2 \neq 1, 2, 3, 4\), meaning \(x \neq \pm 1, \pm \sqrt{2}, \pm \sqrt{3}, \pm 2\). So, any roots of the polynomial \(N - (2010x - 4)D = 0\) that make \(D = 0\) are extraneous and must be discarded.

But in the original equation, we have denominators \(x^2 - 1, x^2 - 2, x^2 - 3, x^2 - 4\). So, when we multiplied both sides by \(D\), we introduced solutions where \(D = 0\), which are invalid. However, since we are only interested in the sum of solutions, and these extraneous roots would have contributed to the sum as well, but we need to verify if any of them are actually roots of the original equation.

But since the extraneous roots come from \(D = 0\), which are \(x = \pm 1, \pm \sqrt{2}, \pm \sqrt{3}, \pm 2\). Let me check if these satisfy the original equation.

Let me test \(x = 1\):

The original equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - 1} + \frac{2}{1 - 2} + \frac{3}{1 - 3} + \frac{4}{1 - 4} = \text{undefined} + \frac{2}{-1} + \frac{3}{-2} + \frac{4}{-3}.
\]

But since the first term is undefined, \(x = 1\) is not a solution.

Similarly, \(x = -1\):

\[
\frac{1}{1 - 1} + \frac{2}{1 - 2} + \frac{3}{1 - 3} + \frac{4}{1 - 4} = \text{undefined} + \frac{2}{-1} + \frac{3}{-2} + \frac{4}{-3}.
\]

Undefined, so \(x = -1\) is not a solution.

Similarly, \(x = \pm \sqrt{2}\):

Plug in \(x = \sqrt{2}\):

Denominators:

\(x^2 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\),

\(x^2 - 2 = 0\),

\(x^2 - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1\),

\(x^2 - 4 = 2 - 4 = -2\).

So, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1} + \frac{2}{0} + \frac{3}{-1} + \frac{4}{-2} = \text{undefined} + \text{undefined} + (-3) + (-2).
\]

So, undefined, so \(x = \sqrt{2}\) is not a solution.

Same for \(x = -\sqrt{2}\), \(x = \pm \sqrt{3}\), \(x = \pm 2\), the denominators would be zero in some terms, so these are not solutions.

Therefore, all the roots of the polynomial \(N - (2010x - 4)D = 0\) are valid solutions to the original equation. Hence, the sum of all complex solutions (including real ones) is indeed \(-2/1005\).

But wait, \(-2/1005\) is a very small number. Let me check if my calculations are correct.

Wait, maybe I made a sign error.

Earlier, I had:

- Coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(- (2010x - 4)D\) is \(-4\).
- Coefficient of \(x^9\) is \(-2010\).

Therefore, using Vieta's formula, the sum is \(-a_8 / a_9 = -(-4)/(-2010) = -4/2010 = -2/1005\).

Yes, that seems correct.

But let me think again: the original equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

This is a rational equation, which we converted into a polynomial equation of degree 9, which has 9 roots. The sum of all roots is \(-2/1005\).

But let me think: is this possible? The right-hand side is a linear function, and the left-hand side is a sum of four rational functions. So, intuitively, the solutions might not be symmetric or anything, but the sum being a rational number suggests that all the roots, when summed, give a simple fraction. But \(-2/1005\) seems quite specific.

Wait, maybe I can test this with a simpler equation where I know the sum.

Suppose I have an equation like \(\frac{1}{x - 1} = 0\). Then, the solution is non-existent, but if I clear the denominator, it's \(1 = 0\), which is a contradiction, sum of roots is zero (since it's a degenerate equation). Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, if I have an equation like \(\frac{1}{x - 1} + \frac{1}{x - 2} = 0\). Multiply both sides by \((x - 1)(x - 2)\):

\[
(x - 2) + (x - 1) = 0 \implies 2x - 3 = 0 \implies x = 3/2.
\]

So, the sum is 3/2. But in this case, the original equation is equivalent to a linear equation, so degree 1, with one root.

But in our problem, the equation is converted into a 9th-degree equation, but with only one real root, but the rest are complex. So, the sum is \(-2/1005\), which is a small number, but considering the high degree, perhaps it is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in assuming all roots are valid. But earlier, I saw that the only invalid roots are \(x = \pm 1, \pm \sqrt{2}, \pm \sqrt{3}, \pm 2\). Are any of these roots of the polynomial \(N - (2010x - 4)D = 0\)?

Let me check \(x = 1\):

Compute \(N - (2010x - 4)D\) at \(x = 1\):

First, \(D = (1 - 1)(1 - 2)(1 - 3)(1 - 4) = 0\). So, \( (2010*1 - 4)*D = 0 \). Therefore, \(N - 0 = N\).

Compute \(N\) at \(x = 1\):

\(N = 10(1)^6 - 70(1)^4 + 150(1)^2 - 96 = 10 - 70 + 150 - 96 = (10 - 70) + (150 - 96) = (-60) + 54 = -6\).

So, \(N(1) = -6\). Therefore, \(x = 1\) is not a root of the polynomial equation because the value is -6, not zero. Similarly, check \(x = -1\):

Compute \(D = ((-1)^2 - 1)((-1)^2 - 2)((-1)^2 - 3)((-1)^2 - 4) = (1 - 1)(1 - 2)(1 - 3)(1 - 4) = 0\). So, \(N - (2010*(-1) -4)D = N - (-2010 -4)D = N - (-2014)D\). But since \(D = 0\), this is \(N\). Compute \(N(-1)\):

\(N(-1) = 10*(-1)^6 -70*(-1)^4 + 150*(-1)^2 -96 = 10 -70 + 150 -96 = same as before, -6\). So, \(x = -1\) is not a root.

Similarly, check \(x = \sqrt{2}\):

Compute \(D = (2 -1)(2 - 2)(2 -3)(2 -4) = (1)(0)(-1)(-2) = 0\). So, \(N - (2010*\sqrt{2} -4)*0 = N\). Compute \(N(\sqrt{2})\):

\(N(\sqrt{2}) = 10*(\sqrt{2})^6 -70*(\sqrt{2})^4 +150*(\sqrt{2})^2 -96\).

Compute each term:

- \((\sqrt{2})^2 = 2\),
- \((\sqrt{2})^4 = 4\),
- \((\sqrt{2})^6 = 8\).

So,

\(N = 10*8 -70*4 +150*2 -96 = 80 -280 + 300 -96 = (80 -280) + (300 -96) = (-200) + 204 = 4\).

So, \(N(\sqrt{2}) = 4\), which is not zero. Therefore, \(x = \sqrt{2}\) is not a root.

Similarly, \(x = -\sqrt{2}\):

\(N(-\sqrt{2}) = 10*(\sqrt{2})^6 -70*(\sqrt{2})^4 +150*(\sqrt{2})^2 -96 = same as above, 4\), which is not zero.

Same with \(x = \sqrt{3}\):

\(D\) at \(x = \sqrt{3}\):

\((\sqrt{3})^2 -1 = 3 -1 = 2\),

\((\sqrt{3})^2 -2 = 3 -2 =1\),

\((\sqrt{3})^2 -3 = 0\),

\((\sqrt{3})^2 -4 = 3 -4 = -1\).

So, \(D(\sqrt{3}) = 2 *1 *0*(-1) = 0\). Therefore, \(N - (2010*\sqrt{3} -4)*0 = N(\sqrt{3})\).

Compute \(N(\sqrt{3})\):

\(N = 10*(3)^3 -70*(3)^2 +150*(3) -96\). Wait, no, wait:

Wait, \(N = 10x^6 -70x^4 +150x^2 -96\).

So,

\(x = \sqrt{3}\), \(x^2 =3\), \(x^4 =9\), \(x^6=27\).

So,

\(N(\sqrt{3}) = 10*27 -70*9 +150*3 -96 = 270 -630 +450 -96 = (270 -630) + (450 -96) = (-360) + 354 = -6\).

So, \(N(\sqrt{3}) = -6\), which is not zero. So, \(x = \sqrt{3}\) is not a root.

Similarly, \(x = -\sqrt{3}\):

Same result, \(N(-\sqrt{3}) = -6\), so not a root.

Lastly, \(x = 2\):

Compute \(D(2)\):

\((4 -1)(4 -2)(4 -3)(4 -4) = 3*2*1*0 = 0\). So, \(N(2)\):

\(N(2) = 10*64 -70*16 +150*4 -96 = 640 -1120 +600 -96 = (640 -1120) + (600 -96) = (-480) + 504 = 24\).

So, \(x = 2\) is not a root.

Similarly, \(x = -2\):

\(N(-2) = same as N(2) because all exponents are even, so \(N(-2) = 24\), not zero.

Therefore, all the points where \(D = 0\) do not satisfy the polynomial equation, which means none of them are roots. Therefore, all 9 roots of the polynomial equation are valid solutions to the original equation.

Thus, the sum of all solutions is indeed \(-2/1005\).

But let me just verify once more the coefficient of \(x^9\):

In \(- (2010x -4)D\), the leading term is \(-2010x * x^8 = -2010x^9\). So, the coefficient is \(-2010\). So, \(a_9 = -2010\).

Coefficient of \(x^8\) is \(-4\), as computed earlier. Therefore, the sum is \(-(-4)/(-2010) = -4/2010 = -2/1005\).

Yes, that seems consistent. So, my final answer is \(-2/1005\). But the question asks for the sum of all complex solutions. So, as a complex number, it's \(-2/1005\). But perhaps, is that reducible?

\(2\) and \(1005\) share a common factor? \(1005\) is divisible by 5, 3, etc. \(1005 ÷ 5 = 201\), which is 3×67. So, 1005 is 3×5×67. 2 and 1005 are coprime, so the fraction is reduced.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is expecting a positive number? Wait, no, the sum is negative.

Wait, let me just check the initial equation:

The right-hand side is \(2010x -4\). The left-hand side is a sum of four rational functions, each with vertical asymptotes at \(x = \pm1, \pm\sqrt{2}, \pm\sqrt{3}, \pm2\). The left-hand side tends to zero as \(x\) approaches infinity, while the right-hand side tends to \(2010x\), which goes to infinity. So, the equation will have solutions on both sides of the asymptotes, but since it's a high-degree equation, the number of solutions is high. But the sum being a negative number makes sense because the leading term is negative.

Therefore, after all this calculation, I think the sum is \(-2/1005\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-\dfrac{2}{1005}}
</think>

To find the sum of all complex solutions of the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4,
\]

we start by making the substitution \(y = x^2\). This transforms the equation into:

\[
\frac{1}{y - 1} + \frac{2}{y - 2} + \frac{3}{y - 3} + \frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

We then combine the fractions on the left-hand side:

\[
\frac{10(y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4) + 24(y - 1)(y - 3)(y - 4) + 30(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 4) + 40(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)}{(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4)} = 2010x - 4.
\]

The numerator simplifies to a polynomial \(N = 10y^3 - 70y^2 + 150y - 96\). The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{10y^3 - 70y^2 + 150y - 96}{(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4)} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Cross-multiplying to clear the denominator, we get:

\[
10y^3 - 70y^2 + 150y - 96 = (2010x - 4)(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4).
\]

Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we have:

\[
10x^6 - 70x^4 + 150x^2 - 96 = (2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4).
\]

Expanding the right-hand side and combining terms, we form a ninth-degree polynomial. The sum of the roots of this polynomial is given by Vieta's formula, which is the negative ratio of the coefficient of \(x^8\) to the coefficient of \(x^9\).

The coefficient of \(x^9\) is \(-2010\) and the coefficient of \(x^8\) is \(-4\). Thus, the sum of the roots is:

\[
-\frac{-4}{-2010} = -\frac{4}{2010} = -\frac{2}{1005}.
\]

Therefore, the sum of all complex solutions is:

\[
\boxed{-\dfrac{2}{1005}}
\]
