Question:
Find the number of quadratic equations of the form $x^2 + ax + b = 0,$ such that whenever $c$ is a root of the equation, $c^2 - 2$ is also a root of the equation.

Correct Answer:
Let the roots be $r$ and $s$ (not necessarily real).  We take the cases where $r = s$ and $r \neq s.$

Case 1: $r = s.$

Since $r$ is the only root, we must have $r^2 - 2 = r.$  Then $r^2 - r - 2 = 0,$ which factors as $(r - 2)(r + 1) = 0,$ so $r = 2$ or $r = -1.$  This leads to the quadratics $x^2 - 4x + 4$ and $x^2 + 2x + 1.$

Case 2: $r \neq s.$

Each of $r^2 - 2$ and $s^2 - 2$ must be equal to $r$ or $s.$  We have three cases:

(i) $r^2 - 2 = r$ and $s^2 - 2 = s.$

(ii) $r^2 - 2 = s$ and $s^2 - 2 = r.$

(iii) $r^2 - 2 = s^2 - 2 = r$.

In case (i), as seen from Case $r,$ $s \in \{2,-1\}.$  This leads to the quadratic $(x - 2)(x + 1) = x^2 - x - 2.$

In case (ii), $r^2 - 2 = s$ and $s^2 - 2 = r.$  Subtracting these equations, we get
\[r^2 - s^2 = s - r.\]Then $(r - s)(r + s) = s - r.$  Since $r - s \neq 0,$ we can divide both sides by $r - s,$ to get $r + s = -1.$  Adding the equations $r^2 - 2 = s$ and $s^2 - 2 = r,$ we get
\[r^2 + s^2 - 4 = r + s = -1,\]so $r^2 + s^2 = 3.$  Squaring the equation $r + s = -1,$ we get $r^2 + 2rs + s^2 = 1,$ so $2rs = -2,$ or $rs = -1.$  Thus, $r$ and $s$ are the roots of $x^2 + x - 1.$

In case (iii), $r^2 - 2 = s^2 - 2 = r.$  Then $r^2 - r - 2 = 0,$ so $r = 2$ or $r = -1.$

If $r = 2,$ then $s^2 = 4,$ so $s = -2.$  (We are assuming that $r \neq s.$)  This leads to the quadratic $(x - 2)(x + 2) = x^2 - 4.$

If $r = -1$, then $s^2 = 1,$ so $s = 1.$  This leads to the quadratic $(x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 - 1.$

Thus, there are $\boxed{6}$ quadratic equations that work, namely $x^2 - 4x + 4,$ $x^2 + 2x + 1,$ $x^2 - x - 2,$ $x^2 + x - 1,$ $x^2 - 4,$ and $x^2 - 1.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out how many quadratic equations of the form \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\) satisfy the condition that whenever \(c\) is a root, then \(c^2 - 2\) is also a root. Hmm, that sounds interesting. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that a quadratic equation has at most two roots. So, if \(c\) is a root, then \(c^2 - 2\) must also be a root. But since there can only be two roots, maybe each root maps to another root through this transformation \(c \mapsto c^2 - 2\). So, this could create some sort of cycle or relationship between the roots.

Let me denote the roots as \(c_1\) and \(c_2\). According to the problem, if \(c_1\) is a root, then \(c_1^2 - 2\) must also be a root. Similarly, if \(c_2\) is a root, then \(c_2^2 - 2\) must be a root. But since there are only two roots, this transformation can either map a root to itself or to the other root. So, there are a few possibilities here.

Case 1: Both roots are fixed points of the transformation. That is, \(c_1^2 - 2 = c_1\) and \(c_2^2 - 2 = c_2\). So, in this case, each root satisfies the equation \(x^2 - x - 2 = 0\). Let me solve that equation: \(x^2 - x - 2 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula, \(x = [1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}]/2 = [1 \pm 3]/2\). So, the roots are \(2\) and \(-1\). Therefore, if both roots are fixed points, the quadratic equation must have roots \(2\) and \(-1\), so the equation is \((x - 2)(x + 1) = x^2 - x - 2 = 0\). So, that's one quadratic equation.

Case 2: The roots form a cycle where each root maps to the other. So, \(c_1^2 - 2 = c_2\) and \(c_2^2 - 2 = c_1\). So, we have a system of equations:

1. \(c_1^2 - 2 = c_2\)
2. \(c_2^2 - 2 = c_1\)

So, let me try to solve this system.

From equation 1: \(c_2 = c_1^2 - 2\)

Plug this into equation 2: \((c_1^2 - 2)^2 - 2 = c_1\)

Let me expand that: \((c_1^2 - 2)^2 = c_1^4 - 4c_1^2 + 4\), so the equation becomes:

\(c_1^4 - 4c_1^2 + 4 - 2 = c_1\)

Simplify: \(c_1^4 - 4c_1^2 + 2 = c_1\)

Bring all terms to one side: \(c_1^4 - 4c_1^2 - c_1 + 2 = 0\)

Hmm, now I have a quartic equation. Maybe I can factor this. Let me try possible rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are ±1, ±2.

Testing c=1: 1 - 4 - 1 + 2 = -2 ≠ 0

c=-1: 1 - 4 + 1 + 2 = 0. Hey, c=-1 is a root!

So, factor out (c + 1). Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Divide \(c^4 - 4c^2 - c + 2\) by (c + 1):

Using synthetic division:

- Coefficients: 1 (c^4), 0 (c^3), -4 (c^2), -1 (c), 2 (constant)

Bring down 1

Multiply by -1: 1*(-1) = -1. Add to next coefficient: 0 + (-1) = -1

Multiply by -1: -1*(-1) = 1. Add to next coefficient: -4 + 1 = -3

Multiply by -1: -3*(-1) = 3. Add to next coefficient: -1 + 3 = 2

Multiply by -1: 2*(-1) = -2. Add to last coefficient: 2 + (-2) = 0. Perfect.

So, the quartic factors as (c + 1)(c^3 - c^2 - 3c + 2) = 0

Now, let's factor the cubic \(c^3 - c^2 - 3c + 2\).

Again, try rational roots: ±1, ±2.

c=1: 1 - 1 - 3 + 2 = -1 ≠ 0

c=2: 8 - 4 - 6 + 2 = 0. So, c=2 is a root.

Divide cubic by (c - 2):

Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 (c^3), -1 (c^2), -3 (c), 2 (constant)

Bring down 1

Multiply by 2: 1*2 = 2. Add to next coefficient: -1 + 2 = 1

Multiply by 2: 1*2 = 2. Add to next coefficient: -3 + 2 = -1

Multiply by 2: -1*2 = -2. Add to last coefficient: 2 + (-2) = 0

So, cubic factors as (c - 2)(c^2 + c - 1)

Therefore, quartic factors as (c + 1)(c - 2)(c^2 + c - 1) = 0

So, the solutions are c = -1, 2, and roots of \(c^2 + c - 1 = 0\). Let's solve \(c^2 + c - 1 = 0\):

Using quadratic formula: \(c = [-1 ± \sqrt{1 + 4}]/2 = [-1 ± \sqrt{5}]/2\)

So, the roots are \(c = (-1 + \sqrt{5})/2\) and \(c = (-1 - \sqrt{5})/2\)

Therefore, in case 2, where the roots form a cycle, we can have two different quadratics, each corresponding to one of the two possible pairs of roots.

Let me check: For each pair (c1, c2) where c1 = (-1 + sqrt5)/2 and c2 = (-1 - sqrt5)/2, we can form a quadratic equation with these roots.

So, the quadratic equation will be \(x^2 - (c1 + c2)x + c1*c2 = 0\)

Compute c1 + c2: [(-1 + sqrt5)/2 + (-1 - sqrt5)/2] = (-1 + sqrt5 -1 - sqrt5)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1

Compute c1*c2: [(-1 + sqrt5)/2] * [(-1 - sqrt5)/2] = [(-1)^2 - (sqrt5)^2]/4 = (1 - 5)/4 = (-4)/4 = -1

Therefore, the quadratic equation is \(x^2 - (-1)x + (-1) = x^2 + x - 1 = 0\)

Similarly, if we take the other roots, but since they are the same as above, it's the same equation. So, only one quadratic equation in this case.

Wait, but hold on, in case 2, we have a cycle where c1 maps to c2 and c2 maps back to c1. So, the quadratic equation is uniquely determined by this cycle, so only one equation here.

So far, we have two quadratic equations: one from case 1, which is \(x^2 - x - 2 = 0\), and one from case 2, which is \(x^2 + x - 1 = 0\). Are there more cases?

Wait, maybe case 3 where one of the roots is fixed (i.e., satisfies \(c^2 - 2 = c\)) and the other root is part of a cycle with itself. But wait, if one root is fixed, can the other root form a cycle with itself? That would mean that the other root must also satisfy \(c^2 - 2 = c\), which would imply that both roots are fixed points, bringing us back to case 1. So, I think case 3 is redundant because if one root is fixed, the other must also be fixed.

Alternatively, maybe both roots form a cycle of length 2, which is what case 2 already considered.

Is there another case where the roots form a cycle with period more than 2? But since a quadratic has only two roots, the cycle can't be longer than 2. So, I think we only have two cases: either both roots are fixed points, or they form a 2-cycle.

Therefore, in total, there are two quadratic equations satisfying the given condition.

Wait, but hold on, let me double-check. Are we sure that these are the only possibilities? Or is there a scenario where the quadratic has a repeated root?

So, suppose the quadratic has a repeated root, say \(c\). Then, according to the condition, if \(c\) is a root, then \(c^2 - 2\) must also be a root. But since it's a repeated root, \(c^2 - 2\) must equal \(c\), because it's the only root. So, in that case, we have \(c^2 - 2 = c\), which is the same as case 1. So, solving \(c^2 - c - 2 = 0\), which gives roots \(c = 2\) and \(c = -1\), as before.

Therefore, a repeated root would only happen if the root satisfies \(c^2 - c - 2 = 0\), so the quadratic equation would have a double root at either 2 or -1. But wait, if it's a double root, then both roots are equal, so in that case, the quadratic equation would be \((x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\) or \((x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0\). So, do these equations satisfy the condition?

Let's check for the equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\) with root 2 (double root). Applying the transformation \(c^2 - 2\), we get \(2^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2\), which is still a root. So, it satisfies the condition. Similarly, for the equation \(x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0\) with root -1 (double root). Applying the transformation, \((-1)^2 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1\), which is still a root. So, these also satisfy the condition.

Therefore, in addition to the two quadratics from case 1 (with roots 2 and -1), we also have two more quadratics: one with a double root at 2 and one with a double root at -1. So, that adds two more quadratic equations.

Wait, but hold on. When we considered case 1, we assumed both roots are fixed points, meaning each root individually satisfies \(c^2 - 2 = c\). So, in that case, if both roots are fixed, the quadratic equation can be either \(x^2 - x - 2 = 0\) (with roots 2 and -1) or a quadratic with a double root at 2 or -1. So, do we have three quadratics here?

Wait, no. The quadratic equation \(x^2 - x - 2 = 0\) has two distinct roots, 2 and -1. The quadratics with double roots, \((x - 2)^2 = 0\) and \((x + 1)^2 = 0\), have both roots equal to 2 or -1 respectively. So, are these considered different quadratics?

Yes, because their coefficients are different. So, \(x^2 - x - 2\) is different from \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) and \(x^2 + 2x + 1\). So, in case 1, where both roots are fixed points, we have three possibilities: two with distinct roots (2 and -1) and one with a double root at 2, and one with a double root at -1. Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, actually, when both roots are fixed points, the quadratic equation is uniquely determined by the roots. So, if both roots are fixed points, meaning both satisfy \(x^2 - x - 2 = 0\), which has roots 2 and -1, so the quadratic is \(x^2 - x - 2\). But if we have a double root, that is, a repeated root which is a fixed point, then it's a different quadratic. So, in addition to \(x^2 - x - 2\), we have two more quadratics: one with a double root at 2 and one with a double root at -1.

Therefore, in case 1, we have three quadratic equations: \(x^2 - x - 2\), \(x^2 - 4x + 4\), and \(x^2 + 2x + 1\).

But wait, hold on. Wait, if the quadratic equation has a double root, it's not necessarily a fixed point equation. Wait, no, in the case of a double root, the root must satisfy \(c^2 - 2 = c\), which is the same condition as in case 1. So, for a double root at 2: 2^2 - 2 = 2, which is true, so that's a fixed point. Similarly, for a double root at -1: (-1)^2 - 2 = -1, which is also true.

Therefore, in case 1, where both roots are fixed points, we can have quadratics with two distinct fixed roots (2 and -1) or quadratics with a double root at either 2 or -1. So, that gives us three quadratics.

But in case 2, where the roots form a 2-cycle, we have only one quadratic equation: \(x^2 + x - 1 = 0\), as we saw earlier.

So, in total, 3 (from case 1) + 1 (from case 2) = 4 quadratic equations.

Wait, but earlier, when I considered case 1, I thought of only one quadratic equation with roots 2 and -1. But if we allow for double roots, that equation can also have a double root at 2 or -1, so that actually, case 1 leads to three quadratics: two distinct roots and two double roots. But wait, no. Wait, the quadratic with two distinct roots is just one equation, and the quadratics with double roots are two separate equations.

So, in total, case 1 gives us three quadratics: \(x^2 - x - 2\), \(x^2 - 4x + 4\), and \(x^2 + 2x + 1\). Case 2 gives us one quadratic: \(x^2 + x - 1\). So, in total, 4 quadratics.

But wait, hold on. Let me reconsider.

Is the quadratic \(x^2 - x - 2\) considered as case 1 with two distinct roots, while the quadratics \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) and \(x^2 + 2x + 1\) are considered as case 1 with a double root?

Yes, that's correct.

So, case 1: both roots are fixed points, leading to three quadratics: one with two distinct roots, and two with double roots.

Case 2: roots form a 2-cycle, leading to one quadratic.

So, in total, 4 quadratics.

But wait, let me verify if all these quadratics indeed satisfy the condition that whenever \(c\) is a root, \(c^2 - 2\) is also a root.

Starting with \(x^2 - x - 2 = 0\):

Roots are 2 and -1.

Check 2: \(2^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2\), which is a root.

Check -1: \((-1)^2 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1\), which is a root.

So, yes, this satisfies the condition.

Quadratic \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\):

Double root at 2.

Check 2: \(2^2 - 2 = 2\), which is a root (since it's a double root, it's still the same).

Quadratic \(x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0\):

Double root at -1.

Check -1: \((-1)^2 - 2 = -1\), which is a root.

Quadratic \(x^2 + x - 1 = 0\):

Roots are \((-1 ± \sqrt{5})/2\). Let's denote them as c1 and c2.

Check c1: \(c1^2 - 2 = c2\). Let's compute \(c1^2\):

Since c1 = [-1 + sqrt5]/2, c1^2 = [1 - 2sqrt5 + 5]/4 = [6 - 2sqrt5]/4 = [3 - sqrt5]/2

Then, c1^2 - 2 = [3 - sqrt5]/2 - 2 = [3 - sqrt5 - 4]/2 = [-1 - sqrt5]/2 = c2, which is the other root.

Similarly, c2^2 - 2 = c1, as shown in case 2. So, this quadratic also satisfies the condition.

Therefore, all four quadratics satisfy the condition. So, is the answer 4?

Wait, but hold on. When I considered case 1, I had three quadratics: one with two distinct roots, and two with double roots. But I need to check whether the double roots are considered as separate quadratics or not.

Yes, because a quadratic equation with a double root is different from one with two distinct roots, even if the roots are the same value. So, each quadratic is uniquely determined by its coefficients, so \(x^2 - x - 2\), \(x^2 - 4x + 4\), \(x^2 + 2x + 1\), and \(x^2 + x - 1\) are four distinct quadratics.

Therefore, the total number is 4.

But wait, hold on. Let me check another angle. Maybe there are more quadratics that satisfy the condition.

Suppose that c is a root, c^2 - 2 is also a root. If c is not a fixed point, then c^2 - 2 must be another root.

But since the quadratic has only two roots, the transformation c → c^2 - 2 must map the set of roots to itself. So, in other words, the set of roots is invariant under the transformation c → c^2 - 2.

So, the set of roots is either:

1. A single fixed point (double root), but that's already considered.

2. Two points forming a 2-cycle.

3. Or, the set of roots is the entire orbit under the transformation, which for quadratics can't be longer than 2.

So, in addition to case 1 and case 2, is there another case where the roots form a 2-cycle, but with another pair? But we saw that the 2-cycle leads to one quadratic.

Alternatively, perhaps the roots form a 2-cycle with multiplicity, but since multiplicity doesn't change the transformation, I think only one quadratic comes out of the 2-cycle.

Therefore, I think we have exhausted all cases: case 1 (three quadratics) and case 2 (one quadratic), totaling four quadratics.

Wait, but hold on. Another thought: If the quadratic equation has roots c and c^2 - 2, but c^2 - 2 could be equal to c, leading to fixed points, or c^2 - 2 could be another root.

But wait, if the quadratic has two roots c and d, then we have:

Either:

1. c = c^2 - 2, and d = d^2 - 2 (so both roots are fixed points)

2. c = d^2 - 2 and d = c^2 - 2 (forming a 2-cycle)

3. Or, one of the roots is fixed, and the other is part of a 2-cycle with itself? But that would require c = c^2 - 2, and d = c^2 - 2, which would mean d = c, so it's a double root. So, that's covered in case 1.

Wait, but in case 1, we considered both roots fixed, which can either be two distinct fixed points or a double fixed root. So, I think we have considered all possibilities.

Therefore, after this thorough analysis, I think the total number of such quadratic equations is four.

But to be thorough, let me list all four quadratics:

1. \(x^2 - x - 2 = 0\) with roots 2 and -1.

2. \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\) with a double root at 2.

3. \(x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0\) with a double root at -1.

4. \(x^2 + x - 1 = 0\) with roots \((-1 ± \sqrt{5})/2\).

Each of these quadratics satisfies the condition that whenever c is a root, c^2 - 2 is also a root.

Therefore, the number of such quadratic equations is 4.

**Final Answer**
The number of such quadratic equations is \boxed{4}.
</think>

To find the number of quadratic equations of the form \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\) such that whenever \(c\) is a root, \(c^2 - 2\) is also a root, we consider the following cases:

1. **Case 1: Both roots are fixed points.**
   - If \(c\) is a root, then \(c^2 - 2 = c\). Solving \(x^2 - x - 2 = 0\) gives roots \(2\) and \(-1\).
   - The quadratic equation with roots \(2\) and \(-1\) is \(x^2 - x - 2 = 0\).
   - If the quadratic has a double root, it must satisfy \(c^2 - 2 = c\). Solving this gives double roots at \(2\) and \(-1\), leading to the quadratic equations \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\) and \(x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0\).

2. **Case 2: Roots form a 2-cycle.**
   - If \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are roots, then \(c_1^2 - 2 = c_2\) and \(c_2^2 - 2 = c_1\). Solving this system leads to the roots \(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\) and \(\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\).
   - The quadratic equation with these roots is \(x^2 + x - 1 = 0\).

Summarizing, we have four quadratic equations:
1. \(x^2 - x - 2 = 0\) with roots \(2\) and \(-1\).
2. \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\) with a double root at \(2\).
3. \(x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0\) with a double root at \(-1\).
4. \(x^2 + x - 1 = 0\) with roots \(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\) and \(\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\).

Thus, the number of such quadratic equations is \(\boxed{4}\).
