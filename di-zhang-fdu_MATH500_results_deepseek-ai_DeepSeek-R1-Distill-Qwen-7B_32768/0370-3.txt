Question:
Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 5 such that
\[p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1}\]for $n = 2,$ 3, 4, $\dots,$ 7.  Find $p(8).$

Correct Answer:
Let $q(x) = (x^2 - 1) p(x) - x.$  Then $q(x)$ has degree 7, and $q(n) = 0$ for $n = 2$, 3, 4, $\dots,$ 7, so
\[q(x) = (ax + b)(x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7)\]for some constants $a$ and $b.$

We know that $q(1) = (1^2 - 1)p(1) - 1 = -1.$  Setting $x = 1$ in the equation above, we get
\[q(1) = 720(a + b),\]so $a + b = -\frac{1}{720}.$

We also know that $q(-1) = ((-1)^2 - 1)p(-1) + 1 = 1.$  Setting $x = -1$ in the equation above, we get
\[q(-1) = 20160(-a + b),\]so $-a + b = \frac{1}{20160}.$  Solving for $a$ and $b,$ we find $a = -\frac{29}{40320}$ and $b = -\frac{3}{4480}.$  Hence,
\begin{align*}
q(x) &= \left( -\frac{29}{40320} x - \frac{3}{4480} \right) (x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7) \\
&= -\frac{(29x + 27)(x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7)}{40320}.
\end{align*}In particular,
\[q(8) = -\frac{(29 \cdot 8 + 27)(6)(5) \dotsm (1)}{40320} = -\frac{37}{8},\]so
\[p(8) = \frac{q(8) + 8}{8^2 - 1} = \boxed{\frac{3}{56}}.\]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find p(8) for a polynomial p(x) of degree 5. It's given that p(n) = n / (n² - 1) for n = 2, 3, 4, ..., 7. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.

First off, I know that p(x) is a polynomial of degree 5, and it's given at six points: n = 2 to 7. Wait, n=2 to 7 is six points, right? Because 7 - 2 + 1 is 6. So, if I have a polynomial of degree 5, which is determined uniquely by 6 points, so that must mean p(x) is uniquely defined by these six points. So, the question is, how do I construct p(x) given these points, and then evaluate it at x=8.

But maybe there's a smarter way instead of trying to construct p(x) directly. Polynomials can sometimes be tricky, especially of higher degrees. Let me think.

I remember something about Lagrange interpolation, which is a method to find a polynomial passing through a given set of points. But with six points, that might get pretty messy. Alternatively, maybe there's another approach.

Wait, let's consider the equation p(n) = n / (n² - 1). So, for each n from 2 to 7, the polynomial p(n) equals n divided by (n squared minus 1). Let me rewrite that equation:

p(n) = n / (n² - 1) = n / [(n - 1)(n + 1)]

So that's n divided by (n-1)(n+1). Hmm, interesting. So p(n) is equal to that fraction. Now, the denominator is (n-1)(n+1), which is a quadratic. So, if I consider (n² - 1), it's a quadratic, but p(n) is a rational function, not a polynomial. So, p(n) is a polynomial that agrees with this rational function at six points.

Wait, so if I define another polynomial, say q(n) = (n² - 1) * p(n) - n. Then, for n = 2,3,...,7, we have q(n) = 0, right? Because (n² - 1)p(n) - n = 0 for those n.

So, q(n) is a polynomial that has roots at n = 2,3,4,5,6,7. That is, q(n) has six roots. Now, what's the degree of q(n)?

Well, p(n) is a degree 5 polynomial, so (n² - 1)p(n) is degree 5 + 2 = 7. Then, subtracting n, which is degree 1, doesn't change the degree. So, q(n) is a degree 7 polynomial.

But we've already identified six roots of q(n). So, q(n) can be written as (n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)(n - 6)(n - 7) * k, where k is some constant.

Wait, yes, because q(n) is a degree 7 polynomial with roots at 2 through 7. So, the factorization would include those linear terms multiplied by a linear term, right? Because 6 roots and it's degree 7, so one more factor. But since we already have all the roots from 2 to 7, the remaining factor must be a linear term, which is the constant k.

But wait, in reality, q(n) is (n² - 1)p(n) - n. So, maybe that can help us find k.

Let me write that down:

q(n) = (n² - 1)p(n) - n = k(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)(n - 6)(n - 7)

So, I need to find the constant k. How can I do that?

Well, since this equation holds for all n, including n=1 and n=-1, where (n² - 1) is zero, maybe we can plug those in to get some information about k.

Wait, let me see. If I plug in n=1, then (n² -1) is zero, so q(1) = (1² -1)p(1) -1 = 0 - 1 = -1. On the other hand, the right side becomes k(1 - 2)(1 - 3)...(1 -7). Let me compute that.

Compute k*(1 -2)(1 -3)(1 -4)(1 -5)(1 -6)(1 -7) = k*(-1)*(-2)*(-3)*(-4)*(-5)*(-6)

Let's compute that:

First, let's count the number of negative signs. Each term (1 - m) for m=2 to 7 is negative. So, we have 6 terms, each negative, so overall sign is (-1)^6, which is positive. The absolute value is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720.

So, q(1) = k*720. But we also found that q(1) = -1. Therefore, 720k = -1 => k = -1/720.

Therefore, now we have:

(n² -1)p(n) - n = (-1/720)(n - 2)(n - 3)...(n -7)

So, let's rearrange this equation to solve for p(n):

(n² -1)p(n) = n - (1/720)(n - 2)(n - 3)...(n -7)

Therefore,

p(n) = [n - (1/720)(n - 2)(n -3)...(n -7)] / (n² -1)

So, that's an expression for p(n). Now, we need to compute p(8).

So, plug n=8 into the above expression:

p(8) = [8 - (1/720)(8 -2)(8 -3)(8 -4)(8 -5)(8 -6)(8 -7)] / (8² -1)

Compute the denominator first: 8² -1 = 64 -1 = 63.

Now, compute the numerator:

First, the term 8 is straightforward. Then, the second term is (1/720) times the product (8-2)(8-3)(8-4)(8-5)(8-6)(8-7).

Let's compute each of those:

(8 - 2) = 6

(8 - 3) = 5

(8 - 4) = 4

(8 - 5) = 3

(8 - 6) = 2

(8 -7) =1

So, the product is 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720.

Therefore, the second term is (1/720)*720 = 1.

So, the numerator is 8 - 1 = 7.

Therefore, p(8) = 7 / 63 = 1/9.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check the computations.

So, p(n) = [n - (1/720)(n-2)(n-3)...(n-7)] / (n² -1). For n=8:

First, compute (8 -2)=6, (8-3)=5, (8-4)=4, (8-5)=3, (8-6)=2, (8-7)=1. So, 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720.

Multiply by (1/720): 720*(1/720)=1.

So, numerator is 8 -1=7. Denominator is 63. 7/63=1/9. That seems correct.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a miscalculation earlier. Let's go back.

We had q(n) = (n² -1)p(n) -n = k(n -2)...(n -7). Plugged in n=1 and found k=-1/720. Then, for n=8, we found p(8)=1/9. Seems consistent.

Alternatively, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the concept of finite differences or constructing the polynomial in another way.

But considering that p(n) is degree 5, and we have six points, so the method I used is probably the standard one.

Wait, but let me consider another approach to verify. Suppose we denote q(n) as above, and since q(n) is a degree 7 polynomial with roots at 2 through 7, and leading coefficient k. So, q(n) = k*(n -2)(n-3)...(n -7). Then, to find k, we can use another value of n where we know p(n). Wait, we only know p(n) at n=2,...,7. So, maybe another way is to plug in a value of n that is not a root of q(n), like n=1 or n=-1, as I did earlier.

Alternatively, maybe plugging in n=0 or n= something else? Let me try n=0.

Compute q(0) = (0² -1)p(0) -0 = (-1)p(0). On the other side, q(0) = k*(0 -2)(0 -3)...(0 -7) = k*(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6)(-7). Let's compute that.

First, the product is (-2)*(-3)*(-4)*(-5)*(-6)*(-7). Let's compute step by step:

(-2)*(-3)=6

6*(-4)=-24

(-24)*(-5)=120

120*(-6)=-720

(-720)*(-7)=5040

So, the product is 5040. Then, q(0) = k*5040.

But q(0) is (-1)p(0). So, (-1)p(0) = 5040k. Therefore, p(0) = -5040k.

But do we know p(0)? Since p(n) is a polynomial, p(0) is just the constant term of the polynomial. However, we don't have a given value for p(0), so maybe that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps this can help us find k if we have another equation.

Wait, but earlier, we found k by plugging n=1, which gave us a direct equation for k. So, that was sufficient. So, perhaps n=1 is the easiest way to find k, and that gives us k=-1/720 without involving p(0).

So, our earlier computation seems correct.

Therefore, p(8)=1/9.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me try another value of n to verify the expression for q(n). For example, take n=2.

Compute q(2) = (2² -1)p(2) -2 = (4 -1)p(2) -2= 3*(2/(2² -1)) -2.

But p(2) = 2/(4 -1)=2/3. So, 3*(2/3)=2. Then, 2 -2=0. So, q(2)=0, which is correct. Similarly, for n=3, let's check.

q(3) = (9 -1)p(3) -3 = 8*(3/(9 -1)) -3 = 8*(3/8) -3=3 -3=0. So, q(3)=0, which is correct.

Similarly, for n=4: q(4)=16 -1)p(4)-4=15*(4/15)-4=4 -4=0. So, that works too.

Good, so our expression for q(n) is correct, since q(n)=0 at n=2,3,4,5,6,7.

Therefore, the expression for p(n) is correct.

So, computing p(8)=1/9 is the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 1/9.

But just to make sure, let me do the calculations again.

Compute numerator: 8 - (1/720)*6*5*4*3*2*1

Compute 6*5=30, 30*4=120, 120*3=360, 360*2=720, 720*1=720.

So, (1/720)*720=1.

Thus, numerator is 8 -1=7. Then, denominator is 8² -1=63. So, 7/63=1/9.

Yes, that's consistent.

So, I think I'm confident that p(8)=1/9.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{9}}
</think>

Given a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree 5 such that
\[ p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \]
for \( n = 2, 3, 4, \ldots, 7 \). We need to find \( p(8) \).

First, we define another polynomial \( q(n) \) as follows:
\[ q(n) = (n^2 - 1)p(n) - n \]

For \( n = 2, 3, 4, \ldots, 7 \), we have \( q(n) = 0 \). Therefore, \( q(n) \) has roots at \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). This means \( q(n) \) can be written as:
\[ q(n) = k(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)(n - 6)(n - 7) \]

To find the constant \( k \), we evaluate \( q(n) \) at \( n = 1 \):
\[ q(1) = (1^2 - 1)p(1) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1 \]
On the other hand,
\[ q(1) = k(1 - 2)(1 - 3)(1 - 4)(1 - 5)(1 - 6)(1 - 7) = k(-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6) \]
The product of the terms is:
\[ (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6) = 720 \]
Thus,
\[ 720k = -1 \implies k = -\frac{1}{720} \]

Therefore, we have:
\[ q(n) = -\frac{1}{720}(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)(n - 6)(n - 7) \]

Rewriting \( q(n) \) in terms of \( p(n) \):
\[ (n^2 - 1)p(n) - n = -\frac{1}{720}(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)(n - 6)(n - 7) \]
Solving for \( p(n) \):
\[ p(n) = \frac{n - \frac{1}{720}(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)(n - 6)(n - 7)}{n^2 - 1} \]

To find \( p(8) \):
\[ p(8) = \frac{8 - \frac{1}{720}(8 - 2)(8 - 3)(8 - 4)(8 - 5)(8 - 6)(8 - 7)}{8^2 - 1} \]
Calculating the product in the numerator:
\[ (8 - 2)(8 - 3)(8 - 4)(8 - 5)(8 - 6)(8 - 7) = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720 \]
Thus,
\[ p(8) = \frac{8 - \frac{1}{720} \times 720}{64 - 1} = \frac{8 - 1}{63} = \frac{7}{63} = \frac{1}{9} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{\dfrac{1}{9}} \]
