Question:
The coordinates of a parallelogram are (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4) and $(x, y)$ and $x > 7$. What is the value of $x + y$?

Correct Answer:
Name the points $A(5,3)$, $B(6,8)$, $C(7,4)$, and $D(x,y)$ and sketch the first three.  We find that there are three possible locations for $D$ (see figure).  Only the one to the right has an $x$-coordinate greater than 7.  Since $AC$ is parallel to $BD$ and equal in length to it, $D$ is two units to the right and one unit up from $B$, just as $C$ is two units to the right and one unit up from $A$.  Therefore, the coordinates of $D$ are $(8,9)$, and $x+y=8+9=\boxed{17}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem here about a parallelogram with three given coordinates: (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and an unknown point (x, y) where x is greater than 7. I need to find x + y. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. That means the midpoints of the diagonals should be the same. So maybe I can use that property to find the missing point.

Let me list the points again: A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), and D(x,y). Since it's a parallelogram, the midpoints of the diagonals AC and BD should be equal.

So, let's find the midpoint of diagonal AC first. The midpoint formula is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). Plugging in the coordinates of A and C:

Midpoint of AC = ((5 + 7)/2, (3 + 4)/2) = (12/2, 7/2) = (6, 3.5)

Now, the midpoint of diagonal BD should also be (6, 3.5). Let's write the coordinates of B and D. B is (6,8) and D is (x,y). Using the midpoint formula again:

Midpoint of BD = ((6 + x)/2, (8 + y)/2) = (6, 3.5)

So, setting up equations:

(6 + x)/2 = 6

and

(8 + y)/2 = 3.5

Let me solve the first equation:

(6 + x)/2 = 6

Multiply both sides by 2:

6 + x = 12

Subtract 6:

x = 6

Wait, but the problem says x > 7. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I do something wrong?

Let me double-check. The midpoint of BD is supposed to be the same as the midpoint of AC, which is (6, 3.5). So, if I plug in x = 6, then the midpoint would be (6, (8 + y)/2). But if x = 6, that would give BD's midpoint x-coordinate as (6 + 6)/2 = 6, which is correct. The y-coordinate would be (8 + y)/2 = 3.5, so 8 + y = 7, which gives y = -1.

So, D would be (6, -1). But wait, the problem says x > 7, so x cannot be 6. That's a problem. Maybe I assigned the points incorrectly?

Perhaps I assumed the order of the points incorrectly. Maybe the order is different. In a parallelogram, the order of the points can affect the diagonals. Let me try assigning the points differently.

Let's say the vertices are A(5,3), B(6,8), C(x,y), and D(7,4). Wait, that might not be the right order either. Maybe I should consider the order such that diagonals are AC and BD, but perhaps I assigned the points wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors or slopes to figure out the missing point.

Wait, another approach: In a parallelogram, the vector from A to B should be the same as the vector from D to C. Similarly, the vector from B to C should be the same as the vector from A to D.

Let me try this vector approach.

Vector AB is B - A = (6 - 5, 8 - 3) = (1,5)

So, vector DC should also be (1,5). Since D is (x,y) and C is (7,4), vector DC is (7 - x, 4 - y). So:

7 - x = 1 => x = 6

4 - y = 5 => y = -1

Again, x = 6, which contradicts x > 7. Hmm, same result.

Alternatively, maybe vector AD should equal vector BC.

Vector AD is D - A = (x - 5, y - 3)

Vector BC is C - B = (7 - 6, 4 - 8) = (1, -4)

So, setting them equal:

x - 5 = 1 => x = 6

y - 3 = -4 => y = -1

Again, same result. So, x = 6, y = -1, which doesn't satisfy x > 7.

Wait, so maybe the point D is not (x, y) but is another point? Maybe I assigned the points incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the parallelogram is not in the order A, B, C, D. Maybe it's A, B, D, C or some other order.

Let me try that. Suppose the points are A(5,3), B(6,8), D(x,y), and C(7,4). So, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.

But wait, in a parallelogram, AB should be equal and parallel to CD, and BC equal and parallel to DA.

Wait, let me make sure.

If order is A, B, D, C, then AB and DC are sides, and BC and AD are sides.

So, vector AB is (1,5). Then vector DC should be (1,5). Vector DC is (7 - x, 4 - y). So, 7 - x = 1 => x=6, 4 - y =5 => y=-1.

Same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the order is A, C, B, D? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the diagonals are AC and BD, but maybe I should have considered different diagonals.

Wait, another thought: maybe the diagonals are AB and CD? No, diagonals in a parallelogram are the ones connecting opposite vertices. So, diagonals are AC and BD.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the points given are not necessarily in order. So, maybe the given points are A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), and D(x,y), but they could be arranged in a different order.

So, perhaps the points are arranged as A, B, C, D, but that didn't give the correct x. Alternatively, perhaps A, B, D, C.

Let me try that. So, suppose the points are A(5,3), B(6,8), D(x,y), C(7,4). Then, the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA? Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, in a parallelogram, consecutive points should be connected by sides. So, if the order is A, B, D, C, then sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA. Hmm, that doesn't form a parallelogram because BD is a diagonal, not a side.

Wait, maybe the order is A, B, C, D, but with the sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Then, diagonals are AC and BD.

But in that case, we tried that, and x came out as 6. So, perhaps the problem is that the given points are not in order.

Alternatively, maybe one of the given points is the intersection point? Wait, no, they're all vertices.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe plotting the points will help.

Plotting A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4). Let me visualize their positions.

Point A is at (5,3), which is somewhere in the middle. Point B is at (6,8), which is higher up. Point C is at (7,4), which is to the right of A but lower than B.

So, in this case, maybe the missing point D is somewhere.

If I connect A to B to C, then D should complete the parallelogram.

Wait, in that case, the vector from B to C is (7 - 6, 4 - 8) = (1, -4). So, to get from A to D, we should go the same vector as from B to C. So, from A(5,3), adding vector (1, -4) gives D(6, -1). But again, x=6, which is less than 7, conflicting with x>7.

Alternatively, maybe the vector from A to C is (7 - 5, 4 - 3) = (2,1). So, the vector from B to D should be the same, so D = B + (2,1) = (6 + 2, 8 + 1) = (8,9). So, D would be (8,9). Then x=8, which is greater than 7, so that works.

Wait, let me check if that makes sense.

If D is (8,9), then the sides would be AB, BC, CD, and DA.

AB is from (5,3) to (6,8), vector (1,5)

BC is from (6,8) to (7,4), vector (1,-4)

CD is from (7,4) to (8,9), vector (1,5)

DA is from (8,9) to (5,3), vector (-3,-6)

Wait, hold on, CD is (1,5), same as AB, but DA is (-3,-6), which is not the same as BC, which is (1,-4). Hmm, that doesn't make sense because in a parallelogram, opposite sides should be equal and parallel.

So, DA should be equal and parallel to BC. But DA is (-3,-6), and BC is (1,-4). These are not equal or scalar multiples, so that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assigning the vectors.

Alternatively, if D is (8,9), then vector AD would be (8 - 5, 9 - 3) = (3,6). Vector BC is (1,-4). These are not equal, so that doesn't satisfy the parallelogram condition.

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't correct.

Wait, another idea: If I consider the midpoints. The midpoint of diagonals should be the same.

Earlier, I found the midpoint of AC is (6, 3.5). So, the midpoint of BD should also be (6, 3.5). But when I tried that, I got D as (6, -1), which doesn't satisfy x >7.

But if I instead compute the midpoint of AB and the midpoint of CD, they should be equal.

Midpoint of AB: ((5 + 6)/2, (3 + 8)/2) = (11/2, 11/2) = (5.5, 5.5)

Midpoint of CD: ((7 + x)/2, (4 + y)/2)

Set them equal:

(7 + x)/2 = 5.5 => 7 + x = 11 => x = 4

(4 + y)/2 = 5.5 => 4 + y = 11 => y = 7

So, D would be (4,7). But x=4, which is less than 7, so that doesn't satisfy x>7 either.

Hmm, this is confusing. Both approaches gave me D with x=6 or x=4, both less than 7.

Wait, maybe the diagonals are BD and AC, but perhaps I assigned the diagonals incorrectly. Maybe in the parallelogram, the diagonals are not AC and BD but some other pair?

Wait, no, in a quadrilateral, the diagonals are the ones connecting opposite vertices, so AC and BD. So, that should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use the fact that in a parallelogram, the sides are equal and the slopes are equal.

Let me calculate the slopes between the points.

Slope of AB: (8 - 3)/(6 - 5) = 5/1 = 5

Slope of BC: (4 - 8)/(7 - 6) = (-4)/1 = -4

Slope of CD: If D is (x,y), then slope of CD is (y - 4)/(x - 7)

Slope of DA: (3 - y)/(5 - x)

In a parallelogram, opposite sides have equal slopes. So, slope AB equals slope CD, and slope BC equals slope DA.

So, slope AB = 5, so slope CD should also be 5.

So, (y - 4)/(x - 7) = 5 => y - 4 = 5(x - 7) => y = 5x - 35 + 4 => y = 5x - 31

Similarly, slope BC is -4, so slope DA should also be -4.

Slope DA is (3 - y)/(5 - x) = -4

So, (3 - y) = -4(5 - x) => 3 - y = -20 + 4x => -y = -23 + 4x => y = 23 - 4x

Now, we have two equations:

1) y = 5x - 31

2) y = 23 - 4x

Set them equal:

5x - 31 = 23 - 4x

5x + 4x = 23 + 31

9x = 54

x = 6

Then, y = 5(6) - 31 = 30 - 31 = -1

So, again, we get x = 6, y = -1. Which doesn't satisfy x >7.

Wait, so all these methods are giving me x=6, which is conflicting with x>7.

Is there another way? Maybe the given points are not in order.

Suppose that the points are in the order A, B, D, C. So, sides AB, BD, DC, and CA. Then, in this case, vector AB is (1,5), vector BD is (x - 6, y - 8), vector DC is (7 - x, 4 - y), and vector CA is (5 - 7, 3 - 4) = (-2, -1).

In a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC.

So, vector AB = (1,5), vector DC = (7 - x, 4 - y)

Thus:

7 - x = 1 => x = 6

4 - y = 5 => y = -1

Same result.

Alternatively, vector BD should equal vector CA.

Vector BD is (x - 6, y - 8), vector CA is (-2, -1)

Thus,

x - 6 = -2 => x = 4

y - 8 = -1 => y = 7

So, D would be (4,7). Again, x=4 <7.

Hmm, so regardless of how I arrange the points, I keep getting x=6 or x=4, both less than 7.

Wait, maybe the given points are not all vertices? Or perhaps one of the given points is not a vertex?

But the problem says the coordinates of a parallelogram are (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), and (x,y). So, all four are vertices.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the given points are not in the order of the parallelogram. So, perhaps the parallelogram isn't formed by connecting A to B to C to D, but in a different order.

So, maybe A to B to D to C.

Wait, in that case, the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA. But as I saw earlier, that gives D as (6,-1).

Wait, but then if I take D as (8,9), which was another thought, but that didn't satisfy the vector conditions.

Wait, maybe I need to label the points differently.

Let me consider that the given points are A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(x,y). Let me assume that sides are AB and BC, and then find D accordingly.

Wait, no, in a parallelogram, sides are AB and AD, and then BC is the next side. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the area of the parallelogram.

Wait, but without knowing the base or height, that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe use the shoelace formula to compute the area.

But since it's a parallelogram, the area should be twice the area of a triangle formed by three of the points.

Wait, let me compute the area using coordinates.

Given four points, but I don't know which ones are connected. Maybe I can use the shoelace formula for quadrilaterals.

But since we don't know the order, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the given three points can form a triangle, and the fourth point completes the parallelogram.

Wait, another idea: In a parallelogram, the coordinates can be determined by vector addition.

So, if I consider vectors from A to B and from A to C, then the fourth point D can be found by adding the vectors.

Wait, but in this case, let me see.

Vector AB is (1,5), vector AC is (2,1). Then, vector AB + vector AC = (3,6). So, point D would be A + vector AB + vector AC = (5 + 3, 3 + 6) = (8,9). So, D is (8,9). Then, x=8, which is greater than 7.

But earlier, when I thought of D as (8,9), the opposite sides didn't match. Let me check again.

If D is (8,9), then sides would be:

AB: from (5,3) to (6,8), vector (1,5)

BC: from (6,8) to (7,4), vector (1,-4)

CD: from (7,4) to (8,9), vector (1,5)

DA: from (8,9) to (5,3), vector (-3,-6)

Wait, so AB and CD are both (1,5), which is good, but DA is (-3,-6) and BC is (1,-4). These are not equal or scalar multiples, meaning DA is not equal and parallel to BC.

So, that's a problem. So, DA should be equal to BC, but it's not. So, that suggests that D is not (8,9). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the given points are A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), and D(x,y), and the order is A, B, D, C.

So, sides AB, BD, DC, and CA.

In that case, as I found earlier, D would be (6,-1), which is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the order is A, C, B, D.

So, sides AC, CB, BD, and DA.

But then, vector AC is (2,1), vector CB is (1,-4), so vector BD should be (2,1), so from B(6,8), D is (6 + 2, 8 + 1) = (8,9). Then, vector DA is (5 - 8, 3 - 9) = (-3,-6). Vector CB is (1,-4). These are not equal, so that's a problem.

Hmm, so that approach also fails.

Wait, maybe I need to use the property that in a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the sides equals the sum of the squares of the diagonals.

Wait, but without knowing the sides or diagonals, it might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can set up equations based on the midpoints.

Wait, earlier, I tried midpoint of AC and BD, but that gave me a point with x=6, which is conflicting.

Wait, but maybe I have an error in how I'm calculating the midpoints.

Wait, midpoint of AC is ((5 + 7)/2, (3 + 4)/2) = (6, 3.5). Then, midpoint of BD is ((6 + x)/2, (8 + y)/2). So, equate them:

(6 + x)/2 = 6 => 6 + x = 12 => x=6

(8 + y)/2 = 3.5 => 8 + y =7 => y= -1

So, x=6, y=-1.

But x=6 is not greater than 7, as given. So, that's a conflict.

Wait, maybe the diagonal is not AC but AD?

Wait, if I consider diagonal AD and BC.

Midpoint of AD: ((5 + x)/2, (3 + y)/2)

Midpoint of BC: ((6 + 7)/2, (8 + 4)/2) = (13/2, 6)

So, set them equal:

(5 + x)/2 = 13/2 => 5 + x =13 =>x=8

(3 + y)/2 =6 =>3 + y =12 => y=9

So, D is (8,9). Then, x=8>7, which satisfies the condition.

So, now, check if this D makes sense.

So, points are A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(8,9). Let's check the vectors.

Vector AB: (1,5)

Vector DC: (7 -8,4 -9)=(-1,-5). Wait, that's not equal to AB, it's negative. So, not the same.

Hmm, but in a parallelogram, opposite sides should be equal and same direction.

Wait, but maybe I should check the vectors for adjacent sides.

Vector AB: (1,5)

Vector AD: (8 -5,9 -3)=(3,6)

In a parallelogram, adjacent sides should have the same magnitude but not necessarily the same direction.

Wait, but the key is that opposite sides are equal and parallel.

So, vector AB should equal vector DC, and vector AD should equal vector BC.

Compute vector DC: from D(8,9) to C(7,4) is (-1,-5). Which is not equal to vector AB(1,5). So, that's a problem.

Similarly, vector BC: from B(6,8) to C(7,4) is (1,-4)

Vector AD: from A(5,3) to D(8,9) is (3,6). These are not equal either.

Wait, so now I'm confused. Using diagonal midpoints, I get D(8,9), which doesn't satisfy the parallelogram properties.

But that seems contradictory because the midpoint method should hold.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the midpoint method.

Wait, in a parallelogram, the midpoints of the diagonals coincide. So, if I take diagonals AC and BD, their midpoints should be the same. So, midpoint of AC is (6, 3.5) and midpoint of BD is ((6 + x)/2, (8 + y)/2). So, setting them equal as before gives x=6, y=-1.

But if I take diagonals AD and BC, their midpoints should also be equal. So, midpoint of AD is ((5 + x)/2, (3 + y)/2), and midpoint of BC is (13/2,6). Setting them equal, as above, gives x=8, y=9.

But in a parallelogram, both midpoints should coincide, right? Because both diagonals intersect at the same midpoint.

So, why are we getting two different midpoints?

Wait, that can't be. So, in that case, perhaps the given points cannot form a parallelogram? But the problem states that it's a parallelogram, so that can't be.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the given points are not all vertices of the parallelogram, but some are midpoints or something else.

But the problem clearly says the coordinates of a parallelogram are (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), and (x,y). So, all four are vertices.

Wait, maybe the order of the points is different.

Let me try labeling them differently. Maybe A(5,3), B(7,4), C(6,8), D(x,y). Let's see.

So, sides: AB, BC, CD, DA.

Vectors:

AB: (7 -5, 4 -3)=(2,1)

BC: (6 -7,8 -4)=(-1,4)

CD: (x -6, y -8)

DA: (5 -x,3 - y)

In a parallelogram, AB should equal CD, and BC should equal DA.

So, AB=(2,1)=CD=(x -6, y -8)

Therefore:

x -6=2 =>x=8

y -8=1 =>y=9

Similarly, BC=(-1,4)=DA=(5 -x,3 - y)

Therefore:

5 -x = -1 =>x=6

3 - y =4 =>y= -1

So, same problem. x=8 and x=6, conflicting. So, no solution. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the order is different.

Alternatively, A(5,3), C(7,4), B(6,8), D(x,y)

Vectors:

AC: (2,1)

CB: (1, -4)

BD: (x -6, y -8)

DA: (5 -x, 3 - y)

In a parallelogram, AC and BD should be diagonals, so their midpoints should be equal.

Midpoint of AC: (6, 3.5)

Midpoint of BD: ((6 +x)/2, (8 + y)/2)

Set equal:

(6 +x)/2 =6 =>x=6

(8 + y)/2=3.5 =>y= -1

Again, same result.

Alternatively, maybe the given points are arranged as A, B, C, D, but in a different configuration.

Wait, maybe the sides are AB and BC, but in that case, the fourth point would be computed differently.

Wait, let me try vector addition.

If I have points A, B, C, then D can be found by adding the vector from A to B and the vector from A to C.

Wait, vector AB is (1,5), vector AC is (2,1). So, vector AB + vector AC = (3,6). So, D = A + (3,6) = (5 +3, 3 +6)=(8,9). So, D is (8,9). But as before, this doesn't satisfy the parallelogram properties.

Wait, unless I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the given points include a duplicate or something.

Wait, let me compute the distances between the points.

Distance AB: sqrt((6 -5)^2 + (8 -3)^2)=sqrt(1 +25)=sqrt(26)

Distance BC: sqrt((7 -6)^2 + (4 -8)^2)=sqrt(1 +16)=sqrt(17)

Distance AC: sqrt((7 -5)^2 + (4 -3)^2)=sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5)

Distance AD: if D is (8,9), then sqrt((8 -5)^2 + (9 -3)^2)=sqrt(9 +36)=sqrt(45)

Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal.

So, AB should equal CD, and BC should equal AD.

Distance AB is sqrt(26), distance CD would be sqrt((7 -8)^2 + (4 -9)^2)=sqrt(1 +25)=sqrt(26). So, that matches.

Distance BC is sqrt(17), distance AD is sqrt(45). Which are not equal. So, that's a problem.

Wait, so even though AB and CD are equal, BC and AD are not. So, that doesn't satisfy the parallelogram condition.

Wait, so maybe D is (8,9), but then it's not a parallelogram? But the problem says it is.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the given points don't form a parallelogram unless D is (8,9), but in that case, the sides aren't equal. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I need to compute the coordinates differently.

Wait, let's try to find another point D such that all sides are equal.

Wait, but that might not be possible because three points are given, and the fourth is missing.

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are given in a different order, so that the sides aren't AB, BC, CD, DA, but something else.

Wait, maybe the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA. So, then AB is (1,5), BD is (x -6, y -8), DC is (7 -x,4 - y), and CA is (-2,-1). So, in this case, AB should equal DC, and BD should equal CA.

So, AB=(1,5)=DC=(7 -x,4 - y). So,

7 -x=1 =>x=6

4 - y=5 =>y= -1

Similarly, BD=(x -6,y -8)=(-2,-1). So,

x -6=-2 =>x=4

y -8=-1 =>y=7

So, we have x=6 and x=4, which is impossible. So, that's a contradiction.

Wait, so in all cases, when trying to find D, we end up with conflicting x values, which can't be.

But the problem clearly states that it's a parallelogram, so there must be a point D with x>7.

Wait, is it possible that I made a mistake in considering the midpoints?

Wait, if the midpoints are different, maybe I have to rethink.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept that in a parallelogram, the vector from A to B is equal to the vector from D to C.

So, vector AB is (1,5), so vector DC should also be (1,5).

So, vector DC is (7 -x,4 - y) = (1,5). Therefore, 7 -x=1 =>x=6, 4 - y=5 =>y= -1.

Same as before.

Alternatively, vector from B to C is (1,-4), so vector from A to D should also be (1,-4). So, vector AD=(1,-4). So, D would be (5 +1,3 -4)=(6,-1). Again, same result.

So, x=6, which is not greater than 7.

Wait, so maybe the given points are not in the order A, B, C, D, but in a different order, such that the sides are different.

Wait, let me try labeling the points as A(5,3), B(7,4), C(6,8), D(x,y). So, sides AB, BC, CD, DA.

Vectors:

AB: (2,1)

BC: (-1,4)

So, in a parallelogram, AB should equal CD, and BC should equal DA.

So, vector CD should be (2,1). So, from C(6,8), D is (6 +2,8 +1)=(8,9)

Vector DA should be (-1,4). From D(8,9) to A(5,3) is (-3,-6). Which is not equal to (-1,4). So, that doesn't work.

Wait, so again, same issue.

Wait, maybe the vectors aren't the same but negative?

Wait, vector DA would be (5 -8, 3 -9)=(-3,-6). Which is different from vector BC=(-1,4). So, they aren't negatives either.

Hmm.

Wait, so maybe in this labeling, the sides don't satisfy the parallelogram properties.

Alternatively, maybe labeling is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the sides are AB, AC, BD, and CD. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about it differently.

Wait, let me compute the slopes again.

Slope of AB: (8 - 3)/(6 - 5)=5/1=5

Slope of BC: (4 - 8)/(7 - 6)=(-4)/1=-4

Slope of AC: (4 - 3)/(7 -5)=1/2=0.5

Slope of BD: (y -8)/(x -6)

In a parallelogram, the slopes of adjacent sides are not necessarily equal, but the opposite sides are equal. Wait, actually, wait: in a parallelogram, the sides are not necessarily parallel, but opposite sides are parallel.

Wait, actually, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are both equal and parallel.

So, slope of AB should equal slope of CD, and slope of BC should equal slope of DA.

So, slope AB=5, so slope CD=5.

Slope BC=-4, so slope DA=-4.

So, from point D(x,y), slope DA is (3 - y)/(5 - x)=-4

So, (3 - y)= -4*(5 -x)=>3 - y= -20 +4x => -y= -23 +4x => y=23 -4x

Similarly, slope CD=5, which is (4 - y)/(7 -x)=5

So, 4 - y=5*(7 -x)=>4 - y=35 -5x => -y=31 -5x => y=5x -31

So, set y=23 -4x and y=5x -31

So, 23 -4x=5x -31

23 +31=5x +4x

54=9x

x=6

Then, y=23 -4*6=23 -24= -1

Again, x=6, y=-1. So, same result.

Hmm, so regardless of how I approach this, I keep getting D=(6,-1). But x must be greater than 7. So, maybe the problem is that the given points are not in order, so that the diagonals are different.

Wait, maybe the diagonals are AC and BD, but if I take another pair, say AB and CD, as diagonals.

Wait, in a parallelogram, diagonals are not sides, they are the ones connecting opposite vertices.

So, I think the approach is correct. The midpoint method is standard.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the coordinates are given in a different order, so that the diagonals are different.

Wait, suppose the diagonals are AB and CD.

Wait, midpoint of AB: ((5 +6)/2, (3 +8)/2)=(11/2, 11/2)=(5.5,5.5)

Midpoint of CD: ((7 +x)/2, (4 + y)/2)

Set equal:

(7 +x)/2=5.5 =>7 +x=11 =>x=4

(4 + y)/2=5.5 =>4 + y=11 =>y=7

So, D=(4,7). Then, x=4, which is less than 7, so not acceptable.

Alternatively, if diagonals are AC and BD, and we get D=(6,-1), which is x=6, which is also less than 7.

Wait, is there a way to have D with x>7?

Wait, perhaps if I take different pairs of points as diagonals.

Wait, but in a quadrilateral, there are only two diagonals, AC and BD.

Wait, unless the figure is not a convex quadrilateral, but concave.

Wait, but parallelogram is always convex.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the reflection of a point.

Wait, if D is (8,9), which conflicts, maybe it's symmetric.

Wait, let me think.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the centroid of the parallelogram.

Wait, in a parallelogram, the intersection point of the diagonals is the midpoint, which is the same for both diagonals.

So, computing the centroid as the average of all four vertices. But since three points are given, maybe.

Wait, but without knowing the fourth point, it's difficult.

Wait, perhaps the centroid is ((5 +6 +7 +x)/4, (3 +8 +4 + y)/4)

But since the centroid is also the midpoint of the diagonals, which we know is (6, 3.5). So,

(5 +6 +7 +x)/4=6 =>(18 +x)/4=6 =>18 +x=24 =>x=6

(3 +8 +4 +y)/4=3.5 =>(15 +y)/4=3.5 =>15 + y=14 =>y= -1

Again, same result.

Wait, so it's impossible to have a fourth point with x>7 that forms a parallelogram with the given three points?

But the problem says it is, so I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe the given points are not three vertices, but something else.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again: "The coordinates of a parallelogram are (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4) and (x, y) and x > 7. What is the value of x + y?"

So, four vertices, three given, one missing. So, x>7.

Wait, perhaps the given points are not all vertices? Maybe two are vertices, and the other two are midpoints or something else.

But the problem says "the coordinates of a parallelogram are (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), and (x,y)", so they are all vertices.

Wait, maybe I need to compute the centroid and use vector methods.

Wait, centroid of a parallelogram is the intersection of diagonals, which is the average of all four vertices.

So, centroid x-coordinate: (5 +6 +7 +x)/4

Centroid y-coordinate: (3 +8 +4 + y)/4

This should equal the midpoint of the diagonals, which is (6, 3.5)

So,

(18 +x)/4 =6 =>18 +x=24 =>x=6

(15 +y)/4=3.5 =>15 +y=14 =>y= -1

Again, same result.

Wait, so regardless of how I compute it, x=6, y=-1.

Therefore, unless I'm missing a trick, the only possible point is (6, -1). So, x=6, y=-1, and x+y=5.

But the problem says x>7, so maybe I have to consider that perhaps the given points are not in order, and instead, the diagonals are different.

Wait, perhaps if I take another pair of points as diagonals.

Wait, so if I take (5,3) and (7,4) as one diagonal, midpoint (6, 3.5). Then, take (6,8) and (x,y) as the other diagonal, so their midpoint is ((6 +x)/2, (8 + y)/2). So, set ((6 +x)/2, (8 + y)/2)=(6, 3.5)

So,

(6 +x)/2=6 =>6 +x=12 =>x=6

(8 + y)/2=3.5 =>8 + y=7 =>y= -1

Same result.

Alternatively, if I take (5,3) and (6,8) as a diagonal, midpoint (5.5,5.5). Then, the other diagonal is (7,4) and (x,y), which should also have midpoint (5.5,5.5). So,

(7 +x)/2=5.5 =>7 +x=11 =>x=4

(4 + y)/2=5.5 =>4 + y=11 =>y=7

So, D=(4,7). But x=4 <7, which is not acceptable.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the reflection.

Wait, if D=(8,9), which didn't satisfy the properties, but x=8>7. Maybe it's a different kind of parallelogram.

Wait, but as I saw before, with D=(8,9), the opposite sides are not equal or parallel.

Wait, unless it's a different type of parallelogram, like a rhombus or something else.

Wait, let me compute the distances.

From A(5,3) to B(6,8): sqrt(1 +25)=sqrt(26)

From B(6,8) to C(7,4): sqrt(1 +16)=sqrt(17)

From C(7,4) to D(8,9): sqrt(1 +25)=sqrt(26)

From D(8,9) to A(5,3): sqrt(9 +36)=sqrt(45)=3*sqrt(5)

So, sides AB=CD=sqrt(26), BC=DA= not equal.

Therefore, it's not a parallelogram, unless I made a mistake.

Wait, but in the problem, it's given as a parallelogram, so this must be a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I need to compute the fourth point such that x>7, but I can't find such a point.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try again.

Given points A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(x,y)

If I consider vectors AB and BC, then the vector from A to B is (1,5), and from B to C is (1,-4). So, the vector from C to D should be the same as vector AB, which is (1,5), so D=(7 +1, 4 +5)=(8,9). But as above, that doesn't satisfy the parallelogram properties.

Alternatively, vector from C to D is equal to vector from A to B, which is (1,5). So, D=(7 +1,4 +5)=(8,9). Then, vector from D to A is (5 -8,3 -9)=(-3,-6), which should be equal to vector BC=(1,-4). They are not equal or scalar multiples, so that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe the vector from D to A is equal to vector from B to C, which is (1,-4). So, from D(x,y) to A(5,3): vector=(5 -x, 3 - y)=(1,-4). So,

5 -x=1 =>x=4

3 - y= -4 =>y=7

So, D=(4,7). Then, vector from C to D is (4 -7,7 -4)=(-3,3). Vector from A to B is (1,5). These are not equal or scalar multiples, so not a parallelogram.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe using vectors is not working. Maybe the issue is that with the given three points, the fourth point is fixed, regardless of x>7.

So, perhaps the problem is incorrectly stating x>7, or maybe I misread the coordinates.

Wait, let me double-check the coordinates.

The problem says: The coordinates of a parallelogram are (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), and (x,y) and x>7. What is the value of x + y?

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I can use complex numbers.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe plotting the points.

Plotting A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4)

So, A is at (5,3), B is at (6,8), which is up and to the right, C is at (7,4), which is down from B.

So, connecting A to B to C, it seems like a V shape.

Wait, so maybe the fourth point D is somewhere else.

Wait, if I consider A(5,3) connected to B(6,8), and B connected to C(7,4), then to form a parallelogram, D should be such that AB is equal and parallel to CD, and BC is equal and parallel to AD.

So, vector AB is (1,5). So, vector CD should be (1,5). So, from C(7,4), moving (1,5), D=(8,9). But as before, DA vector is (-3,-6), which is not equal to BC vector (1,-4).

Alternatively, maybe vector BC is (1,-4). So, vector AD should be (1,-4). So, from A(5,3), moving (1,-4), D=(6,-1). Then, vector CD is from C(7,4) to D(6,-1), which is (-1,-5). Not equal to AB vector (1,5). So, not a parallelogram.

Wait, so either way, the sides are not equal.

So, in conclusion, maybe the given points can't form a parallelogram unless D is (6,-1) or (8,9), neither of which satisfy x>7.

But the problem says it is a parallelogram. So, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, perhaps the coordinates are given in order, so A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(x,y), and it's a parallelogram. So, sides AB, BC, CD, DA.

So, vector AB=(1,5), vector BC=(1,-4), so vector CD should be equal to vector AB=(1,5). So, from C(7,4), moving (1,5), D=(8,9). Then, vector DA is from D(8,9) back to A(5,3), which is (-3,-6). Which is not equal to vector BC=(1,-4). So, it doesn't satisfy the parallelogram condition.

Alternatively, vector DA should be equal to vector BC=(1,-4). So, from A(5,3), moving (1,-4), D=(6,-1). Then, vector CD is from C(7,4) to D(6,-1)=(-1,-5), which is not equal to vector AB=(1,5). So, again, not a parallelogram.

Wait, so in both cases, whether we set CD=AB or DA=BC, we don't get a parallelogram.

So, maybe the given points can't form a parallelogram with x>7, unless it's a different configuration.

Wait, but the problem says it is a parallelogram. So, perhaps my mistake is in the way I'm interpreting the vectors.

Wait, maybe I should use the property that in a parallelogram, consecutive sides are equal and opposite sides are equal. So, the lengths of AB and CD are equal, and the lengths of BC and AD are equal.

Compute lengths:

AB: sqrt((6-5)^2 + (8 -3)^2)=sqrt(1 +25)=sqrt(26)

BC: sqrt((7 -6)^2 + (4 -8)^2)=sqrt(1 +16)=sqrt(17)

So, if AB=CD=sqrt(26), then CD should be sqrt(26). So, distance from C(7,4) to D(x,y) is sqrt(26). So,

sqrt((x -7)^2 + (y -4)^2)=sqrt(26)

So,

(x -7)^2 + (y -4)^2=26

Similarly, BC=AD=sqrt(17). So, distance from A(5,3) to D(x,y)=sqrt(17)

So,

sqrt((x -5)^2 + (y -3)^2)=sqrt(17)

So,

(x -5)^2 + (y -3)^2=17

So, we have two equations:

1) (x -7)^2 + (y -4)^2=26

2) (x -5)^2 + (y -3)^2=17

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1.

Equation1 - Equation2:

[(x -7)^2 - (x -5)^2] + [(y -4)^2 - (y -3)^2] =26 -17=9

Compute each term:

(x -7)^2 - (x -5)^2= [x^2 -14x +49] - [x^2 -10x +25]= (-14x +49) - (-10x +25)= (-14x +49) +10x -25= (-4x +24)

Similarly, (y -4)^2 - (y -3)^2= [y^2 -8y +16] - [y^2 -6y +9]= (-8y +16) - (-6y +9)= (-8y +16) +6y -9= (-2y +7)

So, overall:

(-4x +24) + (-2y +7)=9

Simplify:

-4x -2y +31=9

-4x -2y= -22

Divide both sides by -2:

2x + y=11

So, equation 3: 2x + y=11

Now, we can use this with either equation1 or equation2.

Let me use equation2:

(x -5)^2 + (y -3)^2=17

From equation3: y=11 -2x

Substitute into equation2:

(x -5)^2 + (11 -2x -3)^2=17

Simplify:

(x -5)^2 + (8 -2x)^2=17

Compute each term:

(x -5)^2= x^2 -10x +25

(8 -2x)^2=64 -32x +4x^2

So, equation2 becomes:

x^2 -10x +25 +64 -32x +4x^2=17

Combine like terms:

(1x^2 +4x^2) + (-10x -32x) + (25 +64)=5x^2 -42x +89=17

So,

5x^2 -42x +89 -17=0 =>5x^2 -42x +72=0

Quadratic equation:5x² -42x +72=0

Let's compute discriminant:

D=42² -4*5*72=1764 -1440=324

sqrt(324)=18

So, solutions:

x=(42 ±18)/10

So,

x=(42 +18)/10=60/10=6

x=(42 -18)/10=24/10=2.4

So, x=6 or x=2.4

But the problem states that x>7, so neither of these solutions satisfy x>7.

Hmm, so this suggests that there is no solution where x>7, which contradicts the problem statement.

But the problem says that such a parallelogram exists, so perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.

Wait, let me double-check the equations.

Equation1: (x -7)^2 + (y -4)^2=26 (distance from C to D)

Equation2: (x -5)^2 + (y -3)^2=17 (distance from A to D)

Subtract equation2 from equation1:

[(x -7)^2 - (x -5)^2] + [(y -4)^2 - (y -3)^2]=26 -17=9

Which led to:

-4x -2y +31=9 =>2x + y=11

Which is correct.

Then, substituting y=11 -2x into equation2:

(x -5)^2 + (8 -2x)^2=17

Expanding:

x² -10x +25 +4x² -32x +64=17

Wait, wait, hold on, (8 -2x)^2 is 64 -32x +4x², correct.

So, adding to (x -5)^2=x² -10x +25, total is 5x² -42x +89=17

Which gives 5x² -42x +72=0

So, correct.

Solutions x=6 and x=2.4, as above.

Therefore, there are no solutions with x>7.

But the problem says x>7, so that must mean that the given points cannot form a parallelogram unless x>7.

Wait, unless there's a different configuration.

Wait, maybe the given points are not all consecutive vertices.

Wait, for example, A(5,3), C(7,4), B(6,8), D(x,y). So, perhaps the parallelogram is A-C-B-D.

Wait, in that case, vectors AC and CB.

But vector AC is (2,1), and vector CB is (-1,4). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the sides are AC and CB, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A, C, B, D are arranged differently.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in 3D, but no, coordinates are 2D.

Wait, maybe the given points are not three vertices, but two vertices and a midpoint.

But the problem says four vertices.

Wait, another approach: maybe using complex numbers.

Let me assign complex numbers to the points: A=5+3i, B=6+8i, C=7+4i, D=x+yi

In a parallelogram, (A + C)/2 = (B + D)/2

So, (A + C)= (B + D)

So,

(5 +7) + (3 +4)i = (6 +x) + (8 + y)i

So,

12 +7i = (6 +x) + (8 + y)i

Therefore, equating real and imaginary parts:

12=6 +x =>x=6

7=8 + y =>y= -1

Same result.

So, x=6, y= -1, which is x=6, not greater than7.

So, same issue.

Wait, but the problem says x>7. Maybe the given points are not in order, or the parallelogram is not convex.

Wait, no, a parallelogram is always convex.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the given points are three vertices, but not necessarily in order, so that the fourth point is in a different position.

Wait, for example, maybe A(5,3) and C(7,4) are opposite vertices, and B(6,8) is another vertex, then D can be found such that the diagonals bisect each other.

So, midpoint of AC is ((5 +7)/2, (3 +4)/2)=(6, 3.5)

Midpoint of BD should also be (6,3.5). So, given B(6,8), then D must satisfy:

(6 +x)/2=6 =>x=6

(8 + y)/2=3.5 =>y= -1

Again, same result.

Alternatively, A(5,3) and B(6,8) are opposite vertices, midpoint (5.5,5.5). Then, midpoint of CD is (5.5,5.5). So,

C(7,4), D(x,y)

(7 +x)/2=5.5 =>x=4

(4 + y)/2=5.5 =>y=7

So, D=(4,7). Then, check if sides are equal.

AB: sqrt(1 +25)=sqrt(26)

BC: sqrt(1 +16)=sqrt(17)

CD: sqrt( (4 -7)^2 + (7 -4)^2 )=sqrt(9 +9)=sqrt(18)

DA: sqrt( (5 -4)^2 + (3 -7)^2 )=sqrt(1 +16)=sqrt(17)

So, sides AB=sqrt(26), BC=sqrt(17), CD=sqrt(18), DA=sqrt(17). So, not a parallelogram.

Alternatively, if A and D are opposite vertices, but that's not necessary.

Wait, so in all cases, to satisfy the midpoint condition, the fourth point is either (6,-1) or (4,7), neither of which have x>7. So, seems impossible.

Wait, but the problem says x>7. So, perhaps the given points are not all vertices, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the given points include a midpoint or something else, but the problem states they are coordinates of a parallelogram.

Wait, unless the given points are not all vertices, but three vertices and the fourth is somewhere else.

Wait, but in that case, I can't use the midpoint method, because I don't know which points are opposite.

Wait, another idea: Maybe using vectors to express D in terms of A, B, C.

In a parallelogram, D can be expressed as B + C - A.

So, D= B + C - A = (6,8)+(7,4)-(5,3)=(6+7-5,8+4-3)=(8,9). So, D=(8,9). But as before, this leads to D=(8,9), which doesn't satisfy the parallelogram condition with x>7.

Wait, but x=8>7, so maybe that's acceptable? Wait, but does the quadrilateral with points A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(8,9) form a parallelogram?

Wait, if I compute vectors AB, BC, CD, DA.

AB=(1,5)

BC=(-1,4)

CD=(1,5)

DA=(-3,-6)

So, AB=CD=sqrt(1 +25)=sqrt(26). But BC=DA? BC is sqrt(1 +16)=sqrt(17), DA is sqrt(9 +36)=sqrt(45). So, no, BC≠DA.

So, sides BC and DA are not equal, so not a parallelogram.

Wait, but maybe another pair of sides.

Wait, maybe if I take AB and DA as sides, then vectors AB=(1,5), DA=(-3,-6). These are not equal or scalar multiples.

Alternatively, maybe sides AB and CD are equal, but sides BC and DA are not.

So, to form a parallelogram, both pairs of opposite sides must be equal and parallel.

Thus, in this case, with D=(8,9), BC≠DA, so it's not a parallelogram.

Therefore, the only possible point D that satisfies the midpoint condition is (6,-1) or (4,7), neither of which have x>7.

Therefore, unless the problem is incorrect, or unless I'm missing something, there's no solution with x>7.

But the problem states that such a parallelogram exists. So, perhaps the mistake is in assuming the order of the points.

Wait, maybe the given points are not in order, so I need to arrange them differently.

Wait, for example, suppose the parallelogram is A(5,3), B(6,8), D(x,y), C(7,4). So, sides AB, BD, DC, CA.

But in that case, vectors:

AB=(1,5)

BD=(x -6, y -8)

DC=(7 -x,4 - y)

CA=(5 -7,3 -4)=(-2,-1)

So, in a parallelogram, AB should equal DC, and BD should equal CA.

So,

AB=(1,5)=DC=(7 -x,4 - y)

Thus,

7 -x=1 =>x=6

4 - y=5 =>y= -1

Similarly, BD=(x -6, y -8)=(-2,-1)

So,

x -6=-2 =>x=4

y -8=-1 =>y=7

But x=6 and x=4 simultaneously? Contradiction.

So, no solution.

Wait, maybe another approach.

Wait, given all of this, perhaps the correct point is (8,9), even though it doesn't satisfy the parallelogram properties, but in that case, x=8>7, so x+y=17.

But in reality, with D=(8,9), it's not a parallelogram.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different type of quadrilateral.

Wait, maybe it's a trapezoid or something else, but the problem says a parallelogram.

Wait, but given that the problem is stated as is, perhaps the answer is x+y=17, with D=(8,9), even though the properties aren't satisfied. But that seems incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that in my calculation, D=(8,9) is the reflection of A over the midpoint of BC.

Wait, midpoint of BC: ((6 +7)/2, (8 +4)/2)=(6.5,6)

So, reflecting A(5,3) over (6.5,6) gives D=(8,9). So, that makes sense.

But, again, the problem is that with D=(8,9), the sides aren't equal or parallel.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the given points are not in order, so that AB and AC are sides, and BD and CD are the other sides. But that's not a standard parallelogram.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the given points are three vertices, and the fourth is the intersection of the diagonals, but that would make the fourth point the midpoint, which would be (6,3.5). But that's not one of the given points.

Wait, or maybe the given points are four vertices, but two are the same, but no, all four are distinct.

Wait, maybe the given points are not all vertices, but midpoints or something else. But the problem states they are the coordinates of a parallelogram.

Wait, unless, the point (x,y) is the midpoint of one of the diagonals, but then x is involved in the midpoint.

Wait, no, the midpoint would be ((5 +7)/2, (3 +4)/2)=(6, 3.5) or ((6 +8)/2, (8 + y)/2), which would be (7, (8 + y)/2). But the midpoint must be same for both diagonals, so it's (6,3.5). So, if we take this as a diagonal, then the other diagonal must have midpoint (6,3.5). So, the other diagonal is between (7,4) and (x,y). So,

(7 +x)/2=6 =>x=5

(4 + y)/2=3.5 =>y=3

So, D=(5,3), but that's already point A.

So, that doesn't work.

Wait, this is really perplexing.

Given all these attempts, it seems that the only possible fourth point that satisfies the midpoint condition is either (6,-1) or (4,7), both of which have x<=7. So, unless the problem is misstated, or unless I'm missing something, I can't find a point D with x>7 that forms a parallelogram with the given points.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the given points are not all vertices but something else. But the problem clearly states they are the coordinates of a parallelogram, so they must be vertices.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the sides are not in the order I thought. Maybe AB is not a side, but a diagonal.

Wait, suppose AB is a diagonal, then the other diagonal would be CD.

So, midpoint of AB: ((5 +6)/2, (3 +8)/2)=(5.5,5.5)

Midpoint of CD: ((7 +x)/2, (4 + y)/2)

Set equal:

(7 +x)/2=5.5 =>x=4

(4 + y)/2=5.5 =>y=7

So, D=(4,7). Then, check if sides are equal.

AB: sqrt(1 +25)=sqrt(26)

BC: sqrt(1 +16)=sqrt(17)

CD: sqrt( (4 -7)^2 + (7 -4)^2 )=sqrt(9 +9)=sqrt(18)

DA: sqrt( (5 -4)^2 + (3 -7)^2 )=sqrt(1 +16)=sqrt(17)

So, sides AB=CD? sqrt(26) vs sqrt(18). No.

Sides BC=DA? sqrt(17)=sqrt(17). Yes.

So, two pairs of sides: BC=DA, but AB≠CD.

So, it's a parallelogram only if both pairs of opposite sides are equal.

So, unless AB=CD, which they aren't, it's not a parallelogram.

So, in this case, even though D=(4,7) satisfies midpoint condition, the sides aren't equal, so it's not a parallelogram.

Wait, unless it's a different type of quadrilateral.

Wait, but the problem says it's a parallelogram.

Wait, so in this case, the conclusion is that no such point D exists with x>7, unless the given points are incorrect.

But since the problem says it exists, perhaps I need to go back and re-examine my calculations.

Wait, let me re-examine the midpoint method.

Given three vertices A, B, C, the fourth vertex D can be found in three ways:

1. D = A + vector BC

2. D = B + vector AC

3. D = C + vector AB

But in each case, D ends up at (6,-1), (4,7), or (8,9). All have x <=7 or x=8.

But x=8 is acceptable since x>7, but in that case, the figure is not a parallelogram.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the given points are in a different order.

Wait, so if I take A(5,3), C(7,4), and B(6,8), then D is the fourth point.

So, using the vector approach, D = A + vector CB.

Vector CB = B - C = (6 -7,8 -4)=(-1,4)

So, D = A + vector CB = (5 -1,3 +4)=(4,7)

Alternatively, D = C + vector AB = (7 +1,4 +5)=(8,9)

But in both cases, D is either (4,7) or (8,9), neither of which are compatible with the parallelogram.

So, I think I'm stuck here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the given points are not labeled in order, so that A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), and D(x,y) are arranged differently.

Suppose that A is connected to B, B to D, D to C, and C to A.

So, sides AB, BD, DC, and CA.

In this case, vectors:

AB=(1,5)

BD=(x -6, y -8)

DC=(7 -x,4 - y)

CA=(5 -7,3 -4)=(-2,-1)

So, in this case, for a parallelogram, AB should be equal to DC, and BD should be equal to CA.

So,

AB=(1,5)=DC=(7 -x,4 - y)

So,

7 -x=1 =>x=6

4 - y=5 =>y= -1

Similarly, BD=(x -6, y -8)=(-2,-1)

So,

x -6=-2 =>x=4

y -8=-1 =>y=7

But x=6 and x=4 simultaneously, which is impossible.

Thus, no solution.

Wait, so with all these methods, the only possible D points don't satisfy x>7, unless the problem is incorrect.

But the problem says it's a parallelogram, so I must have made an error. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe I can use complex numbers.

Let me assign complex numbers: A=5+3i, B=6+8i, C=7+4i, D=x+yi.

In a parallelogram, the midpoints of the diagonals are equal.

So, midpoint of A and C: (5 +7)/2 + (3 +4)/2 i=6 +3.5i

Midpoint of B and D: (6 +x)/2 + (8 + y)/2 i

Set equal:

(6 +x)/2=6 =>x=6

(8 + y)/2=3.5 =>y= -1

Same result.

Wait, unless the diagonals are AC and BD, but that's the same as before.

Wait, so unless the problem is incorrect, or unless I'm missing something, I can't find a point D with x>7.

But since the problem asks for x + y, maybe it's expecting the answer as 6 + (-1)=5, despite x not being greater than 7. But that seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, if the correct point is (8,9), even though it doesn't form a parallelogram, then x + y=17.

But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe it's a different parallelogram where the order is changed. So, for example, A(5,3), D(6,-1), B(7,4), C(8,9). Wait, but then it's four points, so that's the same as before.

Wait, in that case, maybe the sides are AD and BC.

So, vector AD=(6 -5, -1 -3)=(1,-4)

Vector BC=(7 -6,4 -8)=(1,-4)

So, equal vectors. Similarly, vector AB=(7 -5,4 -3)=(2,1)

Vector DC=(8 -7,9 -4)=(1,5). Not equal.

So, only one pair of sides equal, so it's not a parallelogram.

Wait, so in conclusion, after trying all possible configurations, the only point D that satisfies the midpoint condition is (6,-1) or (4,7), neither of which have x>7. Therefore, unless the problem is incorrect or misstated, there is no solution where x>7.

But since the problem asks for x + y, maybe the answer is x + y=5, even though x=6 is not greater than 7. Or maybe x + y=17, with D=(8,9), even though it's not a parallelogram.

But since the problem says it is a parallelogram, I think the correct answer is x=6, y=-1, so x + y=5.

Therefore, I think the answer is 5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5}
</think>

Given the coordinates of a parallelogram as (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and (x, y) with x > 7, we need to find the value of x + y.

1. **Midpoint Method**:
   - The midpoint of diagonals in a parallelogram must be the same.
   - Calculate the midpoint of AC: \(\left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)\).
   - Set this equal to the midpoint of BD: \(\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right)\).
   - Solving the equations:
     \[
     \frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies x = 6
     \]
     \[
     \frac{8 + y}{2} = 3.5 \implies y = -1
     \]
   - Thus, D is (6, -1), but x = 6 is not greater than 7.

2. **Vector Method**:
   - Using vectors to find D:
     - Vector AB = (1, 5), vector DC should be equal.
     - Solving for D gives (6, -1).
     - Vector BC = (-1, 4), vector DA should be equal.
     - Solving for D gives (4, 7).
   - Both points do not satisfy x > 7.

3. **Reflection Method**:
   - Reflecting point A over the midpoint of BC gives D = (8, 9).
   - Checking sides shows it does not form a parallelogram.

4. **Quadratic Equation**:
   - Using distances and solving the quadratic equation led to x = 6 and x = 2.4, neither satisfying x > 7.

After verifying all methods, the only possible point D that satisfies the midpoint condition is (6, -1), but x = 6 is not greater than 7. Despite this, the problem states it is a parallelogram, leading to the conclusion that the correct point is (6, -1).

Thus, the value of x + y is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
