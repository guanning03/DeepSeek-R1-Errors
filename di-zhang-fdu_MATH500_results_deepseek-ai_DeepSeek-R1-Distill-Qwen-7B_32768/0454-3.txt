Question:
The equation
\[x^{10}+(13x-1)^{10}=0\,\]has 10 complex roots $r_1,$ $\overline{r}_1,$ $r_2,$ $\overline{r}_2,$ $r_3,$ $\overline{r}_3,$ $r_4,$ $\overline{r}_4,$ $r_5,$ $\overline{r}_5,$ where the bar denotes complex conjugation. Find the value of
\[\frac 1{r_1\overline{r}_1}+\frac 1{r_2\overline{r}_2}+\frac 1{r_3\overline{r}_3}+\frac 1{r_4\overline{r}_4}+\frac 1{r_5\overline{r}_5}.\]

Correct Answer:
Let $p(x) = x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}.$  If $r$ is a root of $p(x),$ then $r^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0.$  Then $(13r - 1)^{10} = -r^{10},$ so
\[-1 = \left( \frac{13r - 1}{r} \right)^{10} = \left( \frac{1}{r} - 13 \right)^{10}.\]Then $\frac{1}{r} - 13$ has magnitude 1, so
\[\left( \frac{1}{r} - 13 \right) \left( \frac{1}{\overline{r}} - 13 \right) = 1,\]so
\[\left( \frac{1}{r_1} - 13 \right) \left( \frac{1}{\overline{r}_1} - 13 \right) + \dots + \left( \frac{1}{r_5} - 13 \right) \left( \frac{1}{\overline{r}_5} - 13 \right) = 5.\]Expanding, we get
\[\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r}_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r}_5} - 13 \left( \frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{\overline{r}_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5} + \frac{1}{\overline{r}_5} \right) + 5 \cdot 169 = 5.\]We see that $\frac{1}{r_1},$ $\frac{1}{\overline{r}_1},$ $\dots,$ $\frac{1}{r_5},$ $\frac{1}{\overline{r}_5}$ are the solutions to
\[\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)^{10} + \left( \frac{13}{x} - 1 \right)^{10} = 0,\]or $1 + (13 - x)^{10} = 0.$  The first few terms in the expansion as
\[x^{10} - 130x^9 + \dotsb = 0,\]so by Vieta's formulas,
\[\frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{\overline{r}_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5} + \frac{1}{\overline{r}_5} = 130.\]Hence,
\[\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r}_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r}_5} = 13 \cdot 130 - 5 \cdot 169 + 5 = \boxed{850}.\]

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this equation: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). It's given that it has 10 complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs: \(r_1, \overline{r}_1\), \(r_2, \overline{r}_2\), and so on up to \(r_5, \overline{r}_5\). The question is asking for the sum \(\frac{1}{r_1\overline{r}_1} + \frac{1}{r_2\overline{r}_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5\overline{r}_5}\). 

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that for complex roots, especially when dealing with polynomials, the product of a root and its conjugate is the square of the modulus of the root. So, \(r_i \overline{r_i} = |r_i|^2\), which is a positive real number. Therefore, each term in the sum is the reciprocal of the square of the modulus of each root.

But I'm not sure if I need to compute the modulus directly or if there's another property or theorem that could help here. Maybe Vieta's formula? Because Vieta relates the sum and products of roots to the coefficients of the polynomial. So, perhaps I can express the sum in terms of the coefficients.

Wait, but the given equation is not in the standard polynomial form. It's \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). Maybe I should first expand it or rewrite it in a way that makes it a standard polynomial. Let me see.

Let me set \(y = 13x - 1\). Then the equation becomes \(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\). But \(y = 13x - 1\), so substituting back, it's \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). Hmm, that doesn't seem to help much. Maybe I can factor this equation differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out \(x^{10}\) or \(y^{10}\). Let me try dividing both sides by \(x^{10}\), assuming \(x \neq 0\). Then we have:

\(1 + \left(\frac{13x - 1}{x}\right)^{10} = 0\)

Simplify the term inside the brackets:

\(\frac{13x - 1}{x} = 13 - \frac{1}{x}\)

So, the equation becomes:

\(1 + \left(13 - \frac{1}{x}\right)^{10} = 0\)

Let me set \(z = \frac{1}{x}\). Then, the equation becomes:

\(1 + (13 - z)^{10} = 0\)

So, \((13 - z)^{10} = -1\)

Taking the 10th root of both sides, we get:

\(13 - z = \sqrt[10]{-1}\)

Now, the 10th roots of \(-1\) are the complex numbers \(e^{i\pi(2k + 1)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\). So, in general, \(13 - z = e^{i\pi(2k + 1)/10}\), which implies \(z = 13 - e^{i\pi(2k + 1)/10}\).

But \(z = \frac{1}{x}\), so \(x = \frac{1}{13 - e^{i\pi(2k + 1)/10}}\).

Therefore, the roots \(r_i\) are \(x = \frac{1}{13 - e^{i\pi(2k + 1)/10}}\) for \(k = 0\) to \(9\). Since the roots come in conjugate pairs, each pair corresponds to a pair of \(k\) values that are symmetric around the circle. However, since 10 is even, there will be 5 distinct pairs.

Wait, hold on. Each \(k\) will give a distinct root, but since the equation is degree 10, we have 10 roots. So, the roots are \(r_k = \frac{1}{13 - e^{i\pi(2k + 1)/10}}\) for \(k = 0\) to \(9\), and their complex conjugates would correspond to \(k' = 10 - k\), because \(e^{-i\theta}\) is the conjugate of \(e^{i\theta}\).

Yes, that makes sense. So, each pair \(r_k\) and \(\overline{r_k}\) corresponds to \(k\) and \(10 - k\). Therefore, the roots come in conjugate pairs as given.

Now, the problem is to compute the sum \(S = \sum_{k=1}^{5} \frac{1}{r_k \overline{r_k}}\). But since \(r_k \overline{r_k} = |r_k|^2\), which is the modulus squared, the reciprocal is \(1/|r_k|^2\). So, \(S\) is the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the moduli of each pair of roots.

Alternatively, since the roots are \(r_k = \frac{1}{13 - e^{i\pi(2k + 1)/10}}\), then \(|r_k|^2 = \frac{1}{|13 - e^{i\pi(2k + 1)/10}|^2}\). Therefore, \(1/|r_k|^2 = |13 - e^{i\pi(2k + 1)/10}|^2\). So, the sum \(S\) is equal to the sum over \(k=1\) to \(5\) of \(|13 - e^{i\pi(2k + 1)/10}|^2\).

Hmm, that's an interesting observation. So, \(S = \sum_{k=1}^{5} |13 - e^{i\theta_k}|^2\), where \(\theta_k = \pi(2k + 1)/10\).

Let me compute \(|13 - e^{i\theta}|^2\). Remember that for a complex number \(a + ib\), the modulus squared is \(a^2 + b^2\). So, \(|13 - e^{i\theta}|^2 = (13 - \cos\theta)^2 + (\sin\theta)^2\). Let's compute that.

Expanding this, we have:

\((13 - \cos\theta)^2 + \sin^2\theta = 169 - 26\cos\theta + \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta\)

We know that \(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1\), so:

\(169 - 26\cos\theta + 1 = 170 - 26\cos\theta\)

Therefore, \(|13 - e^{i\theta}|^2 = 170 - 26\cos\theta\).

So, each term in the sum \(S\) is \(170 - 26\cos\theta_k\), where \(\theta_k = \pi(2k + 1)/10\). Therefore, the sum is:

\(S = \sum_{k=1}^{5} (170 - 26\cos\theta_k) = 5 \times 170 - 26 \sum_{k=1}^{5} \cos\theta_k\)

Calculating the first part: \(5 \times 170 = 850\).

Now, the second part is \(26\) times the sum of \(\cos\theta_k\) from \(k=1\) to \(5\), where \(\theta_k = \pi(2k + 1)/10\). Let's compute that sum.

Let me list out the angles \(\theta_k\):

For \(k = 1\) to \(5\):

- \(k=1\): \(\theta_1 = \pi(3)/10 = 3\pi/10\)
- \(k=2\): \(\theta_2 = \pi(5)/10 = \pi/2\)
- \(k=3\): \(\theta_3 = \pi(7)/10 = 7\pi/10\)
- \(k=4\): \(\theta_4 = \pi(9)/10 = 9\pi/10\)
- \(k=5\): \(\theta_5 = \pi(11)/10 = 11\pi/10\)

Wait, hold on. But 11π/10 is greater than π. But cosine is periodic with period 2π, so cos(11π/10) = cos(11π/10 - 2π) = cos(-9π/10) = cos(9π/10). Similarly, cos(9π/10) is equal to cos(π - π/10) = -cos(π/10). Similarly, cos(7π/10) = cos(π - 3π/10) = -cos(3π/10). Cos(5π/10) is cos(π/2) = 0.

So, let me compute the sum:

Sum = cos(3π/10) + cos(π/2) + cos(7π/10) + cos(9π/10) + cos(11π/10)

But using the identities:

cos(7π/10) = cos(π - 3π/10) = -cos(3π/10)

cos(9π/10) = cos(π - π/10) = -cos(π/10)

cos(11π/10) = cos(π + π/10) = -cos(π/10)

Similarly, cos(3π/10) remains as it is, and cos(π/2) is zero.

Wait, let's be precise:

cos(3π/10) = cos(54°) ≈ 0.5878

cos(π/2) = 0

cos(7π/10) = cos(126°) = -cos(54°) ≈ -0.5878

cos(9π/10) = cos(162°) = -cos(18°) ≈ -0.9511

cos(11π/10) = cos(198°) = -cos(18°) ≈ -0.9511

Wait, hold on, cos(5π/10) is cos(π/2) which is 0, that's correct.

But wait, 11π/10 is 198°, which is in the third quadrant, so cosine is negative, and cos(198°) = -cos(18°), yes.

Similarly, 9π/10 is 162°, cosine is negative, cos(162°) = -cos(18°). 7π/10 is 126°, which is 180° - 54°, so cos(126°) = -cos(54°). So, let me write down the exact terms.

So, let's compute the sum:

cos(3π/10) + cos(π/2) + cos(7π/10) + cos(9π/10) + cos(11π/10)

= cos(3π/10) + 0 + (-cos(3π/10)) + (-cos(π/10)) + (-cos(π/10))

Wait, let's see:

cos(3π/10) is positive.

cos(7π/10) = cos(π - 3π/10) = -cos(3π/10)

cos(9π/10) = cos(π - π/10) = -cos(π/10)

cos(11π/10) = cos(π + π/10) = -cos(π/10)

So, substituting these in:

Sum = cos(3π/10) + 0 + (-cos(3π/10)) + (-cos(π/10)) + (-cos(π/10))

Simplify term by term:

cos(3π/10) - cos(3π/10) = 0

Then, we have -2cos(π/10)

So, the total sum is -2cos(π/10)

Therefore, going back to the sum S:

S = 850 - 26*(-2cos(π/10)) = 850 + 52cos(π/10)

Wait, hold on, because the sum of cos(theta_k) was equal to -2cos(π/10). So, 26 times that sum is 26*(-2cos(π/10)) = -52cos(π/10). Then, the entire S is 850 - (-52cos(π/10)) = 850 + 52cos(π/10)

Wait, wait, let me verify:

Earlier, I had:

Sum = cos(3π/10) + 0 + cos(7π/10) + cos(9π/10) + cos(11π/10)

Which became:

cos(3π/10) + 0 - cos(3π/10) - cos(π/10) - cos(π/10) = -2cos(π/10)

So, the sum is -2cos(π/10). Therefore, 26 times that is -52cos(π/10). Thus, S = 850 - (-52cos(π/10)) = 850 + 52cos(π/10)

Wait, that seems a bit odd because it's a constant plus a multiple of cosine. Is that correct?

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the computation of the sum.

Wait, let me re-express the angles:

But perhaps instead of trying to compute each term and see the symmetries, maybe I can use some trigonometric identities or properties to compute the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the sum over k=1 to 5 of cos(theta_k) is equal to -2cos(π/10), as we saw earlier.

But let me double-check that.

So, theta_k for k=1 to 5: 3π/10, π/2, 7π/10, 9π/10, 11π/10.

Expressed in terms of π/10:

3π/10 is 0.3π, π/2 is 0.5π, 7π/10 is 0.7π, 9π/10 is 0.9π, 11π/10 is 1.1π.

So, in terms of multiples of π/10, they are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the angles are 3π/10, 5π/10, 7π/10, 9π/10, 11π/10.

Wait, 5π/10 is π/2, so that's why the second term is zero.

So, let me list the angles as:

3π/10, π/2, 7π/10, 9π/10, 11π/10

Which correspond to 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 times π/10.

Now, if I consider the sum of cos(3π/10) + cos(5π/10) + cos(7π/10) + cos(9π/10) + cos(11π/10)

We can note that cos(11π/10) = cos(π + π/10) = -cos(π/10)

Similarly, cos(9π/10) = cos(π - π/10) = -cos(π/10)

cos(7π/10) = cos(π - 3π/10) = -cos(3π/10)

cos(3π/10) is just cos(3π/10)

So, substituting:

Sum = cos(3π/10) + 0 + (-cos(3π/10)) + (-cos(π/10)) + (-cos(π/10))

Which is:

cos(3π/10) - cos(3π/10) - cos(π/10) - cos(π/10) = 0 - 2cos(π/10) = -2cos(π/10)

So, that part is correct.

Therefore, the sum is indeed -2cos(π/10). Therefore, 26 times that is -52cos(π/10). Therefore, the total sum S is 850 - (-52cos(π/10)) = 850 + 52cos(π/10).

Hmm, so S = 850 + 52cos(π/10). Is this the final answer? Wait, but the problem is asking for a numerical value, I think, or perhaps it wants an exact expression in terms of radicals?

Wait, let me check the original problem again. It just says "Find the value of [...]". So, maybe it's expecting an exact value, perhaps an integer or a fraction, but 850 + 52cos(π/10) is likely not an integer. Wait, cos(π/10) is a known exact value. Let me recall that.

Yes, cos(π/10) is equal to sqrt((5 + sqrt(5))/8). Let me verify that:

cos(36°) = cos(π/5) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2, wait, no, actually, cos(π/10) is cos(18°), which is sqrt((5 + sqrt(5))/8) * 2, wait, let me recall exact values.

Wait, cos(36°) is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Maybe it's better to look up exact value.

Wait, cos(36°) is (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 multiplied by 2, but actually, cos(36°) is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5) + 1)/2 * (1/2), no, wait, I'm confusing.

Wait, let's recall that cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Wait, actually, cos(36°) is equal to (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5) + 1)/2 * (1/2). Hmm, no, let me think differently.

I remember that cos(36°) is equal to (1 + sqrt(5))/4 multiplied by 2. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to recall that cos(π/10) is equal to sqrt((5 + sqrt(5))/8). Let me check.

Yes, cos(π/10) is sqrt((5 + sqrt(5))/8). So, let me write it down:

cos(π/10) = sqrt[(5 + sqrt(5))/8]

Therefore, 52cos(π/10) = 52 * sqrt[(5 + sqrt(5))/8]

Hmm, that's still a complicated expression. Maybe I can compute this numerically?

Wait, but perhaps there's a better approach. Let me step back.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the original equation is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\), which can be rewritten as \(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\). Taking the 10th root, we get \(x = \omega (13x - 1)\), where \(\omega\) is a 10th root of -1, which is e^{i\pi(2k + 1)/10} for k=0,...,9.

Therefore, \(x = \omega(13x - 1)\)

Solving for x:

x = 13\omega x - \omega

Bring terms with x to one side:

x - 13\omega x = -\omega

x(1 - 13\omega) = -\omega

Therefore, x = -\omega / (1 - 13\omega)

So, each root is x = -\omega / (1 - 13\omega)

Therefore, the roots are \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13\omega}\), where \(\omega\) are the 10th roots of -1.

So, the roots are \(r_k = \frac{-\omega_k}{1 - 13\omega_k}\), where \(\omega_k = e^{i\pi(2k + 1)/10}\).

Now, we need to compute \(S = \sum_{k=1}^{5} \frac{1}{r_k \overline{r_k}} = \sum_{k=1}^{5} |r_k|^2\).

But from earlier, we have that \(|r_k|^2 = |13 - e^{i\theta}|^2 = 170 - 26\cos\theta\), which is where we were before.

But maybe instead of computing each term separately, I can find a way to compute the sum over all k, or perhaps relate it to the coefficients of a polynomial.

Wait, perhaps using Vieta's formula. Since the given polynomial is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\), which can be expanded into a standard polynomial. If I can find the coefficients, maybe I can find the sum of reciprocals of the roots, or something similar.

But expanding \((13x - 1)^{10}\) and adding to \(x^{10}\) would result in a polynomial of degree 10 with specific coefficients. Then, using Vieta's, the sum of reciprocals of roots is related to the coefficients.

Wait, but the roots are \(r_1, \overline{r_1}, r_2, \overline{r_2}, ..., r_5, \overline{r_5}\). So, each pair is complex conjugates, so the polynomial must have real coefficients. Therefore, the polynomial is a real polynomial.

Therefore, the sum over all roots of 1/r_k is equal to the negative coefficient of x^9 divided by the coefficient of x^10.

Wait, let's recall that for a polynomial \(P(x) = a_{10}x^{10} + a_9x^9 + ... + a_0\), the sum of reciprocals of roots is \(\sum 1/r_k = -a_9 / a_{10}\).

But in our case, the polynomial is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\). Let me expand this.

First, expand \((13x - 1)^{10}\). Using the binomial theorem:

\[(13x - 1)^{10} = \sum_{m=0}^{10} \binom{10}{m} (13x)^m (-1)^{10 - m}\]

So, expanding this, we get:

\[\sum_{m=0}^{10} \binom{10}{m} 13^m (-1)^{10 - m} x^m\]

So, the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\) is:

\[P(x) = x^{10} + \sum_{m=0}^{10} \binom{10}{m} 13^m (-1)^{10 - m} x^m\]

So, combining like terms, the coefficient of \(x^{10}\) in \(P(x)\) is:

1 (from the first term) + 1 (from the second term when m=10). Because when m=10, the term is \(\binom{10}{10}13^{10}(-1)^0 x^{10} = 1 \times 13^{10} x^{10}\). Therefore, the coefficient of \(x^{10}\) is 1 + 13^{10}.

Similarly, the coefficient of \(x^9\) comes from two sources:

1. The \(x^9\) term in the expansion of \((13x - 1)^{10}\), which is when m=9: \(\binom{10}{9}13^9(-1)^1 x^9 = 10 \times 13^9 \times (-1) x^9 = -10 \times 13^9 x^9\).

2. The \(x^9\) term from the original \(x^{10}\) term is zero.

Therefore, the coefficient of \(x^9\) is \(-10 \times 13^9\).

Therefore, using Vieta's formula, the sum of reciprocals of all roots is \(\sum_{k=1}^{10} 1/r_k = -a_9 / a_{10}\).

Here, \(a_{10} = 1 + 13^{10}\) and \(a_9 = -10 \times 13^9\).

Therefore, \(\sum_{k=1}^{10} 1/r_k = -(-10 \times 13^9) / (1 + 13^{10}) = (10 \times 13^9) / (1 + 13^{10})\).

But the problem is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the moduli of the roots, which is \(S = \sum_{k=1}^{5} |r_k|^2\).

But \(|r_k|^2 = r_k \overline{r_k}\), and since the polynomial has real coefficients, the roots come in conjugate pairs, so each pair contributes \(r_k \overline{r_k}\) and \(r_j \overline{r_j}\), which are equal. So, the total sum is \(2 \sum_{k=1}^{5} |r_k|^2\). Wait, no. Wait, actually, each pair contributes \(|r_k|^2\) twice, but in our case, each pair is \(r_k\) and \(\overline{r_k}\), so their product is \(|r_k|^2\), and each \(|r_k|^2\) is counted once in the sum over k=1 to 5.

Wait, the total number of roots is 10, which are 5 conjugate pairs. So, the sum over all roots of \(1/r_k\) is equal to \(\sum_{k=1}^{5} (1/r_k + 1/\overline{r_k}) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{5} \text{Re}(1/r_k)\), but that's different from our sum S.

Wait, perhaps I can express S in terms of the sum of reciprocals of roots.

But S is the sum of |r_k|^2, which is the same as \(r_k \overline{r_k}\), so for each k, |r_k|^2 = r_k \overline{r_k}.

But in Vieta's formula, the sum of 1/r_k is related to the coefficients, but it's not directly related to the sum of |r_k|^2. Hmm, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, another idea: from the original equation, \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\), we can write this as \(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\), so taking modulus on both sides, we have:

\(|x|^{10} = |13x - 1|^{10}\)

Taking the 10th root, this implies \(|x| = |13x - 1|\)

So, for each root \(r_k\), \(|r_k| = |13 r_k - 1|\)

Therefore, \(|r_k| = |13 r_k - 1|\)

So, squaring both sides:

\(|r_k|^2 = |13 r_k - 1|^2\)

Which is:

\((r_k \overline{r_k}) = (13 r_k - 1)(13 \overline{r_k} - 1)\)

Expanding the right-hand side:

\(13 r_k \overline{r_k} - r_k - 13 \overline{r_k} + 1\)

Thus, we have:

\(r_k \overline{r_k} = 13 r_k \overline{r_k} - r_k - 13 \overline{r_k} + 1\)

Let me denote \(|r_k|^2 = M_k\). Then, the equation becomes:

\(M_k = 13 M_k - r_k - 13 \overline{r_k} + 1\)

Bring all terms to one side:

\(0 = 12 M_k - r_k - 13 \overline{r_k} + 1\)

So,

\(12 M_k = r_k + 13 \overline{r_k} - 1\)

Therefore,

\(M_k = \frac{r_k + 13 \overline{r_k} - 1}{12}\)

But \(M_k = |r_k|^2 = r_k \overline{r_k}\), so:

\(r_k \overline{r_k} = \frac{r_k + 13 \overline{r_k} - 1}{12}\)

Multiply both sides by 12:

\(12 r_k \overline{r_k} = r_k + 13 \overline{r_k} - 1\)

Rearranged:

\(12 r_k \overline{r_k} - r_k - 13 \overline{r_k} + 1 = 0\)

Hmm, not sure if this is helpful.

Wait, but we can write this equation for each root, so for each root \(r_k\), we have:

\(12 |r_k|^2 - r_k - 13 \overline{r_k} + 1 = 0\)

Let me take the conjugate of this equation, since \(r_k\) is a root, \(\overline{r_k}\) is also a root.

So, taking conjugate:

\(12 |r_k|^2 - \overline{r_k} - 13 r_k + 1 = 0\)

Now, we have two equations:

1. \(12 |r_k|^2 - r_k - 13 \overline{r_k} + 1 = 0\)

2. \(12 |r_k|^2 - \overline{r_k} - 13 r_k + 1 = 0\)

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

\( (12 |r_k|^2 - r_k - 13 \overline{r_k} + 1) - (12 |r_k|^2 - \overline{r_k} - 13 r_k + 1) = 0 \)

Simplify:

- r_k -13 \overline{r_k} - (- \overline{r_k} -13 r_k) = 0

Which is:

- r_k -13 \overline{r_k} + \overline{r_k} +13 r_k = 0

Factor terms:

(13 r_k - r_k) + (-13 \overline{r_k} + \overline{r_k}) = 0

That is:

12 r_k -12 \overline{r_k} = 0

So, 12(r_k - \overline{r_k}) = 0

Therefore, \(r_k = \overline{r_k}\), which implies that \(r_k\) is real.

Wait, that can't be, because the original equation has complex roots in conjugate pairs. So, unless all roots are real, which is not the case here, since the polynomial is degree 10 with complex roots.

So, that suggests that our earlier assumption is wrong, or perhaps my algebra is incorrect.

Wait, but the original equation is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\), which might have all real roots? No, because \(x^{10}\) is always non-negative for real x, and \((13x -1)^{10}\) is also non-negative. Therefore, the sum of two non-negative numbers can't be zero unless both are zero. So, x^{10} = 0 implies x=0, but then (13x -1)^{10} = 1, which is not zero. Therefore, there are no real roots, so all roots are complex, and come in conjugate pairs.

Therefore, my conclusion that \(r_k = \overline{r_k}\) must be wrong. Therefore, perhaps my earlier approach is flawed.

Wait, but then in the step above, we derived that 12(r_k - \overline{r_k}) = 0, meaning that r_k = \overline{r_k}, which would mean that all roots are real, which contradicts.

So, that suggests that my mistake is somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps going back to the step where I derived \(|r_k| = |13 r_k - 1|\). Let's verify this.

Given \(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\), taking modulus:

\(|x|^{10} = |13x - 1|^{10}\), so yes, \(|x| = |13x -1|\). So, that part is correct.

But then, proceeding further, I argued that \(|x|^2 = |13x -1|^2\), which is correct because modulus squared equals the product of the number and its conjugate.

So, \(|x|^2 = x \overline{x} = |13x -1|^2 = (13x -1)(13 \overline{x} -1)\). So, that part is correct.

Proceeding further, expanding that gives:

\(x \overline{x} = 13x \overline{x} - x -13 \overline{x} + 1\)

Which is:

\(|x|^2 = 13 |x|^2 - x -13 \overline{x} + 1\)

Then, bringing terms to one side:

\(0 = 12 |x|^2 - x -13 \overline{x} +1\)

Which is:

\(12 |x|^2 = x +13 \overline{x} -1\)

So, \(M = 12 M - x -13 \overline{x} +1\), but wait, actually, \(M = |x|^2 = x \overline{x}\), so:

\(M = 12 M - x -13 \overline{x} +1\)

Therefore, moving all terms to left:

\(M -12 M + x +13 \overline{x} -1 =0\)

Which is:

\(-11 M + x +13 \overline{x} -1 =0\)

So,

\(11 M = x +13 \overline{x} -1\)

Therefore,

\(M = \frac{x +13 \overline{x} -1}{11}\)

But \(M = |x|^2 = x \overline{x}\), so:

\(x \overline{x} = \frac{x +13 \overline{x} -1}{11}\)

Multiply both sides by 11:

\(11 x \overline{x} = x +13 \overline{x} -1\)

Rearranged:

\(11 x \overline{x} - x -13 \overline{x} +1 =0\)

Hmm, this seems similar to before. 

Alternatively, perhaps writing x as a complex number. Let me set \(x = a + ib\), where a and b are real numbers.

Then, \(\overline{x} = a - ib\), and \(|x|^2 = a^2 + b^2\).

Plugging into the equation:

\(11(a^2 + b^2) - (a + ib) -13(a - ib) +1 =0\)

Simplify:

11(a^2 + b^2) -a - ib -13a +13ib +1 =0

Combine like terms:

11a^2 +11b^2 -14a +12ib +1 =0

Since a and b are real, the real and imaginary parts must separately equal zero. Therefore:

Real part: 11a^2 +11b^2 -14a +1 = 0

Imaginary part: 12b = 0 => b = 0

So, b = 0, which implies x is real. But earlier, we saw that the equation \(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} =0\) cannot have real roots because both terms are non-negative for real x, so their sum can't be zero.

Therefore, this is a contradiction. So, our earlier conclusion that \(|x| = |13x -1|\) leading to \(M = (x +13 \overline{x} -1)/11\) must be flawed, or perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, but if b = 0, then x is real, which we know is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is that our initial assumption is wrong, but that doesn't make sense because \(|x| = |13x -1|\) was derived correctly.

So, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me re-examine the step:

From \(|x| = |13x -1|\), squaring both sides:

\(|x|^2 = |13x -1|^2\)

Which is:

\(x \overline{x} = (13x -1)(13 \overline{x} -1)\)

Expanding the right-hand side:

13x *13 \overline{x} -13x -13 \overline{x} +1

Which is:

169 x \overline{x} -13x -13 \overline{x} +1

So, equation:

x \overline{x} = 169 x \overline{x} -13x -13 \overline{x} +1

Bring all terms to the left:

x \overline{x} -169 x \overline{x} +13x +13 \overline{x} -1 =0

Which simplifies to:

-168 x \overline{x} +13x +13 \overline{x} -1 =0

Factor:

-168 M +13(x + \overline{x}) -1 =0

But \(x + \overline{x} = 2a\), where a is the real part.

So,

-168 M +26 a -1 =0

But also, \(M = a^2 + b^2\), so:

-168(a^2 + b^2) +26a -1 =0

But from the original equation, since x is a root, \(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}=0\), which would imply that \(x^{10} = - (13x -1)^{10}\). However, for real x, this would require that \(x^{10}\) is negative, which is impossible because any real number raised to the 10th power is non-negative. Therefore, x cannot be real, so b ≠ 0.

Therefore, going back, the equation:

-168 M +26a -1 =0

But since b ≠ 0, we have another equation from the original polynomial equation, which may be difficult to handle.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express in terms of a and b.

Given \(x = a + ib\), and the equation:

-168(a^2 + b^2) +26a -1 =0

Which is:

-168a^2 -168b^2 +26a -1 =0

But this seems complex as well.

Alternatively, perhaps take the real and imaginary parts of the original equation.

Wait, the original equation is \(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}=0\). Let me write \(x = a + ib\), then:

\(x^{10} = (a + ib)^{10}\), which is a complex number.

Similarly, \(13x -1 =13a -1 +i13b\), so \((13x -1)^{10}\) is another complex number.

Then, their sum is zero, so both the real and imaginary parts must be zero.

Therefore, we can write two equations:

Real part: Re(x^{10}) + Re((13x -1)^{10}) = 0

Imaginary part: Im(x^{10}) + Im((13x -1)^{10}) = 0

But computing these real and imaginary parts is going to be complicated, especially for the 10th power.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the original equation as \(x^{10} = - (13x -1)^{10}\), so taking 10th roots:

\(x = \omega (13x -1)\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Thus, as before, \(\omega = e^{i\pi(2k +1)/10}\) for k=0,...,9.

Therefore, \(x = \omega (13x -1)\)

Rearranged:

\(x =13 \omega x - \omega\)

Bring terms with x to one side:

\(x -13 \omega x = - \omega\)

Factor:

\(x(1 -13 \omega) = - \omega\)

Thus,

\(x = - \omega / (1 -13 \omega)\)

Therefore, the roots are \(x_k = - \omega_k / (1 -13 \omega_k)\), where \(\omega_k = e^{i\pi(2k +1)/10}\) for k=0,...,9.

Therefore, each root can be written as:

\(x_k = \frac{\omega_k}{13 \omega_k -1}\)

So, let me write \(x_k = \frac{\omega_k}{13 \omega_k -1}\).

Therefore, \(1/x_k = \frac{13 \omega_k -1}{\omega_k} =13 - 1/\omega_k\).

Therefore, \(1/r_k = 13 - 1/\omega_k\).

Therefore, \(1/r_k = 13 - \overline{\omega_k}\), since \(1/\omega_k = \overline{\omega_k}\) when \(|\omega_k| =1\).

Therefore, \(1/r_k =13 - \overline{\omega_k}\).

Therefore, \(1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k} = [13 - \omega_k] + [13 - \overline{\omega_k}] = 26 - (\omega_k + \overline{\omega_k}) =26 - 2 \text{Re}(\omega_k)\).

But for each pair \(r_k\) and \(\overline{r_k}\), we have:

\(1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k} =26 - 2 \text{Re}(\omega_k) +26 - 2 \text{Re}(\overline{\omega_k})\).

Wait, no, actually, for each k, \(1/r_k =13 - \overline{\omega_k}\), and \(1/\overline{r_k} =13 - \omega_k\).

Therefore, adding them:

\(1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k} =26 - (\omega_k + \overline{\omega_k}) =26 - 2 \text{Re}(\omega_k)\).

Therefore, each pair contributes \(26 - 2 \text{Re}(\omega_k)\).

But since we have 5 pairs, and each \(\omega_k\) is \(e^{i\pi(2k +1)/10}\), so the real parts are \(\cos(\pi(2k +1)/10)\).

Thus, the sum \(S = \sum_{k=1}^{5} |r_k|^2 = \sum_{k=1}^{5} r_k \overline{r_k}\).

But wait, we have another relationship earlier:

From Vieta, the sum of \(1/r_k\) is \(\sum 1/r_k = (10 \times13^9)/(1 +13^{10})\).

But each \(1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k} =26 - 2 \cos(\pi(2k +1)/10)\). Therefore, the total sum is:

\(\sum_{k=1}^{5} (1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k}) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{5} |r_k|^2 = 2 S = 26 \times5 - 2 \sum_{k=1}^{5} \cos(\pi(2k +1)/10)\).

Wait, this is because each pair contributes \(26 - 2 \cos(\theta_k)\), where \(\theta_k = \pi(2k +1)/10\), so summing over k=1 to 5:

Total sum = 5*26 - 2 \sum_{k=1}^{5} \cos(\theta_k) = 130 - 2 \sum_{k=1}^{5} \cos(\theta_k)

But this total sum is equal to \(\sum_{k=1}^{5} (1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k})\). But in Vieta's formula, we have:

\(\sum_{k=1}^{10} 1/r_k = 10 \times13^9 / (1 +13^{10})\)

But since the roots come in conjugate pairs, this sum is equal to twice the sum over k=1 to5 of \(1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k}\), because each pair contributes twice.

Wait, no. Wait, for each pair \(r_k\) and \(\overline{r_k}\), \(1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k}\) is a real number. Therefore, the total sum of all \(1/r_k\) is equal to \(2 \sum_{k=1}^{5} (1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k})\).

But actually, not exactly, because the sum over all roots is \( \sum_{k=1}^{10} 1/r_k = \sum_{k=1}^{5} (1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k}) \), since each pair contributes once.

Wait, no. Each root is either \(r_k\) or \(\overline{r_k}\). Therefore, the sum over all roots of \(1/r_k\) is equal to \(\sum_{k=1}^{5} (1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k})\), which is equal to \(2 \sum_{k=1}^{5} (1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k}) /2 = \sum_{k=1}^{5} (1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k})\).

Wait, no, each term in the sum is unique. So, in fact, the sum over all roots is \(\sum_{k=1}^{5} (1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k})\). Therefore, the total sum is equal to \(2 S\), since each \(|r_k|^2 = r_k \overline{r_k}\), so \(1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k} = (r_k \overline{r_k} + r_k \overline{r_k}) / (r_k \overline{r_k}) ) = 2 |r_k|^2 / |r_k|^2 = 2\). Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, \(1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k}\) is not equal to \(2 |r_k|^2\). Let me correct that.

\(1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k} = \overline{r_k}/|r_k|^2 + r_k / |r_k|^2 = (r_k + \overline{r_k}) / |r_k|^2 = 2 \text{Re}(r_k) / |r_k|^2\).

So, it's not directly equal to twice the modulus squared. Therefore, my earlier statement is incorrect.

Wait, so actually, \(1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k} = 2 \text{Re}(1/r_k)\), since \(1/\overline{r_k} = \overline{1/r_k}\). Therefore, the sum is \(2 \sum_{k=1}^{5} \text{Re}(1/r_k)\).

But since the polynomial has real coefficients, the sum of \(1/r_k\) is real. Therefore, the imaginary parts cancel out, and the sum is twice the sum of the real parts.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, going back to the equation:

From Vieta, the sum of \(1/r_k\) is \(10 \times13^9 / (1 +13^{10}) = 10 \times13^9 / (1 +13^{10})\).

But from the earlier step, the sum of \(1/r_k\) is equal to \(\sum_{k=1}^{5} (1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k}) = \sum_{k=1}^{5} (1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k})\).

Therefore,

\(\sum_{k=1}^{5} (1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k}) = 10 \times13^9 / (1 +13^{10})\).

But we can also express \(1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k}\) in terms of \(|r_k|^2\).

Wait, let me denote \(M_k = |r_k|^2 = r_k \overline{r_k}\). Then,

\(1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k} = \overline{r_k} / M_k + r_k / M_k = (r_k + \overline{r_k}) / M_k = 2 \text{Re}(r_k) / M_k\)

So, \(\sum_{k=1}^{5} (1/r_k +1/\overline{r_k}) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{5} \text{Re}(1/r_k) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{5} \text{Re}(1/r_k)\), but it's equal to \(10 \times13^9 / (1 +13^{10})\).

But unless we can compute \(\sum \text{Re}(1/r_k)\), this might not help.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to go back to the original expression for \(|r_k|^2\):

From earlier, we had \(|r_k|^2 =170 -26 \cos\theta\), where \(\theta = \pi(2k +1)/10\).

Therefore, \(S = \sum_{k=1}^{5} (170 -26 \cos\theta) = 5 \times170 -26 \sum_{k=1}^{5} \cos\theta =850 -26 \sum_{k=1}^{5} \cos\theta\)

So, we need to compute \(\sum_{k=1}^{5} \cos\theta\), where \(\theta = \pi(2k +1)/10\) for k=1 to5. Let me compute each angle:

For k=1: \(\theta_1 = \pi(3)/10\)

k=2: \(\theta_2 = \pi(5)/10 = \pi/2\)

k=3: \(\theta_3 = \pi(7)/10\)

k=4: \(\theta_4 = \pi(9)/10\)

k=5: \(\theta_5 = \pi(11)/10\)

So, the angles are:

\(\theta_1 = 3\pi/10\)

\(\theta_2 = \pi/2\)

\(\theta_3 =7\pi/10\)

\(\theta_4 =9\pi/10\)

\(\theta_5 =11\pi/10\)

Therefore, the sum is:

\(\cos(3\pi/10) + \cos(\pi/2) + \cos(7\pi/10) + \cos(9\pi/10) + \cos(11\pi/10)\)

Compute each term:

1. \(\cos(3\pi/10)\): which is \(\cos(54^\circ)\). Its exact value is \(\sqrt{(5 + \sqrt{5})}/4 \times 2\), Wait, let me recall that \(\cos(36^\circ) = (1 + \sqrt{5})/4 \times 2\). Wait, perhaps it's better to use exact expressions.

From trigonometric identities, \(\cos(3\pi/10) = \cos(54^\circ) = (\sqrt{5} +1)/4 \times 2\), but actually, exact value is \(\sqrt{(5 + \sqrt{5})}/2 \times something\). Wait, let me recall that:

We know that \(\cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2}\). Wait, no, actually:

Wait, \(\cos(36^\circ) = (1 + \sqrt{5})/4 \times 2\). Wait, actually, let me look it up in exact terms.

Yes, \(\cos(36^\circ) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2\), so it is \(\frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2}\). Wait, let me confirm:

Wait, actually, \(\cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2\), which is \(\frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2}\). But numerically, \(\sqrt{5} \approx 2.236, so \(\sqrt{5} +1 \approx 3.236, divided by 2 is approximately 1.618, which is the golden ratio, but cosine of 36 degrees is approx 0.8090, so that's not correct.

Wait, actually, I think my mistake is in the calculation. Let me recall that \(\cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2\), but that's incorrect.

Wait, let me recall that \(\cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2\), but actually, it's known that \(\cos(36°) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2\), which is \(\frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2}\) divided by 2, which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that \(\cos(36°) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2\), but perhaps I'm confusing with different angles.

Wait, another approach. Let me recall that \(\cos(3\pi/10) = \sin(\pi/10)\), because \(\cos(\pi/2 - x) = \sin x\). But \(3\pi/10 = \pi/2 - 2\pi/10 = \pi/2 - \pi/5\). So, yes, \(\cos(3\pi/10) = \sin(\pi/5)\). Similarly, \(\cos(7\pi/10) = \cos(\pi - 3\pi/10) = -\cos(3\pi/10)\), so \(\cos(7\pi/10) = -\cos(3\pi/10)\).

Similarly, \(\cos(9\pi/10) = \cos(\pi - \pi/10) = -\cos(\pi/10)\).

And \(\cos(11\pi/10) = \cos(\pi + \pi/10) = -\cos(\pi/10)\).

So, let's write down the sum:

\(\cos(3\pi/10) + \cos(\pi/2) + \cos(7\pi/10) + \cos(9\pi/10) + \cos(11\pi/10)\)

Substitute the identities:

= \(\cos(3\pi/10) + 0 + (-\cos(3\pi/10)) + (-\cos(\pi/10)) + (-\cos(\pi/10))\)

Simplify:

= [\(\cos(3\pi/10) - \cos(3\pi/10)\)] + [ -\cos(\pi/10) - \cos(\pi/10) ] +0

= 0 + (-2 \cos(\pi/10)) +0

= -2 \cos(\pi/10)

Therefore, the sum of the cosines is -2 \cos(\pi/10)

Therefore, going back:

S =850 -26*(-2 cos(pi/10)) =850 +52 cos(pi/10)

So, S=850 +52 cos(pi/10)

Now, we can compute this:

We know that \(\cos(\pi/10) = \cos(18°) = \sqrt{(5 + \sqrt{5})}/4 \times 2\), which is exact value.

Wait, exact value of \(\cos(18°)\) is \(\sqrt{(5 + \sqrt{5})}/8\) multiplied by something? Wait, let me recall.

Yes, \(\cos(18°)\) is equal to \(\frac{\sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}\). Wait, let me check:

Using the exact formula, \(\cos(18°) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2\). Wait, perhaps more accurately, \(\cos(18°) = \frac{\sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}\).

Yes, that's correct. So, \(\cos(\pi/10) = \cos(18°) = \frac{\sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}\).

Therefore, 52 \cos(pi/10) =52*(sqrt(10 + 2 sqrt5)/4)=13*sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

Therefore, S=850 +13 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

Wait, but this doesn't seem to align with my earlier thought that S would be 850 +52 cos(pi/10), but if cos(pi/10)=sqrt(10 + 2 sqrt5)/4, then 52 cos(pi/10)=13 sqrt(10 + 2 sqrt5)

So, S=850 +13 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

But let me compute sqrt(10 + 2 sqrt5). Let me compute sqrt(10 + 2 sqrt5):

Let me approximate the value:

sqrt5≈2.236, so 2 sqrt5≈4.472, so 10 +4.472≈14.472, sqrt(14.472)=approx 3.8.

Similarly, 13*3.8≈49.4

Therefore, S≈850 +49.4≈899.4

But wait, earlier, with Vieta's formula, we had S=850 +52 cos(pi/10)≈850 +52*0.9511≈850 +49.45≈899.45.

So, that's roughly 899.45.

But the problem is asking for the exact value, which is 850 +13 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

But let me check if this can be simplified.

Wait, sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5) is equal to 2 cos(pi/10), because sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5) = 2 cos(pi/10). Let me check:

We know that:

cos(pi/10) = sqrt((5 + sqrt5)/8)*2

Wait, no, wait, let me compute:

cos(pi/10) = sqrt((5 + sqrt5)/8)*2?

Wait, actually, cos(pi/10) = (sqrt(5) +1)/4 *2, which is (sqrt(5)+1)/2 * something.

Wait, let me compute [sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)]:

Suppose sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5) = 2 cos(theta). Let me compute theta:

If 2 cos(theta)=sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5), then cos(theta)=sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)/2.

But sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)=sqrt( (sqrt5)^2 + (sqrt5)^2 + 2*sqrt5 )= wait, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using multiple-angle formulas.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that 10 +2 sqrt5 is equal to (sqrt5 +1)^2 + something.

Wait, (sqrt5 +1)^2 =5 +2 sqrt5 +1=6 +2 sqrt5. Not 10 +2 sqrt5.

Wait, 10 +2 sqrt5 is 4 more than 6 +2 sqrt5. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5) as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).

Assume sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)=sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Then, squaring both sides:

10 +2 sqrt5= a + b +2 sqrt(ab)

Therefore, equating the terms:

a + b=10

2 sqrt(ab)=2 sqrt5 => sqrt(ab)=sqrt5 => ab=5

So, solve for a and b:

a + b=10

a*b=5

So, the solutions are the roots of x^2 -10x +5=0, which are [10 ±sqrt(100 -20)]/2= [10 ±sqrt80]/2= [10 ±4 sqrt5]/2=5 ±2 sqrt5

Therefore, sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)=sqrt(5 +2 sqrt5) + sqrt(5 -2 sqrt5). Hmm, but this doesn't seem to help as it complicates further.

Therefore, perhaps the simplest form is 13 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5). Therefore, S=850 +13 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

But let me see if that's the case.

Wait, 13*sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5). Since sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5) is approximately 3.8, as we saw earlier, 13*3.8≈49.4. So, 850 +49.4≈899.4.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an answer in terms of radicals, so 850 +13 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5). Alternatively, perhaps this can be expressed differently.

Wait, but let me recall that 10 +2 sqrt5= (sqrt5 +1)^2 + something? Wait, (sqrt5 +1)^2=6 +2 sqrt5, which is less than 10 +2 sqrt5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5) as 2 cos(pi/10), as I thought earlier.

Because 2 cos(pi/10) = sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5). Let me confirm:

We know that cos(pi/10)=cos(18°)=sqrt((5 + sqrt5)/8)*2.

Wait, let me compute 2 cos(pi/10):

=2 * sqrt((5 + sqrt5)/8)*2

Wait, no, cos(pi/10)=sqrt((5 + sqrt5)/8)*2? Wait, not exactly.

Wait, actually, cos(36°)= (sqrt5 +1)/4 *2, which is the same as (sqrt5 +1)/2, which is approximately 1.618, but cosine of 36° is approximately 0.8090, so that can't be.

Wait, actually, cos(pi/5)=cos(36°)= (sqrt5 +1)/4 *2= (sqrt5 +1)/2 * something.

Wait, perhaps I need to recall exact formula for cos(pi/10).

Yes, exact value: cos(pi/10)= (sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5))/4 *2= sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)/2

Wait, so:

cos(pi/10)=sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)/2 *2= sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)/1?

Wait, no, wait, more accurately:

cos(pi/10)= [sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)]/4 * 2, which is [sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)]/2

Wait, no, to be precise, cos(pi/10)= [sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)]/4 multiplied by 2, which is [sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)]/2.

Wait, let me verify:

Using exact formulas, cos(pi/10)=sqrt((5 + sqrt5)/8)*2= sqrt(5 + sqrt5)/2*sqrt2.

Wait, maybe it's too confusing. Alternatively, perhaps we can accept that sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5) =2 cos(pi/10), so that 13*sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)=26 cos(pi/10). But earlier, we saw that S=850 +52 cos(pi/10). So, if sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)=2 cos(pi/10), then 52 cos(pi/10)=26*2 cos(pi/10)=26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5). Therefore, S=850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, let me think:

If sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)=2 cos(pi/10), then cos(pi/10)=sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)/2

Then, 52 cos(pi/10)=52*(sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)/2)=26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

Therefore, S=850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

Wait, but this contradicts our earlier result where S=850 +52 cos(pi/10). Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the step where I expressed the sum of cosines.

Wait, let's go back to the sum of cos(theta):

We had:

Sum= -2 cos(pi/10)

But if we have S=850 +52 cos(pi/10), and cos(pi/10)=sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)/2, then 52 cos(pi/10)=26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

Therefore, S=850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

But earlier, when I computed it through another method, it was S=850 +13 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5). Wait, conflict here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up in the computation of the sum of cos(theta). Let me recast that.

Wait, earlier, when computing the sum of cos(theta), where theta =3pi/10, pi/2,7pi/10,9pi/10,11pi/10.

I had:

Sum=cos(3pi/10) + cos(pi/2) +cos(7pi/10)+cos(9pi/10)+cos(11pi/10)

And I had converted cos(7pi/10)= -cos(3pi/10), cos(9pi/10)= -cos(pi/10), cos(11pi/10)= -cos(pi/10)

So, sum becomes:

cos(3pi/10) +0 -cos(3pi/10) -cos(pi/10)-cos(pi/10)= -2 cos(pi/10)

Therefore, the sum is -2 cos(pi/10). Therefore, S=850 +52*(-2 cos(pi/10))=850 -104 cos(pi/10)

Wait, no, no, no. Wait, S=850 +52*(sum of cos(theta))=850 +52*(-2 cos(pi/10))=850 -104 cos(pi/10)

Wait, so that's different from my initial conclusion. Wait, so which is correct?

Wait, in the step where I had:

S=850 -26*(sum of cos(theta))=850 -26*(-2 cos(pi/10))=850 +52 cos(pi/10)

But I just now reassessed and saw that sum of cos(theta) is -2 cos(pi/10), so S=850 + (-26)*(-2 cos(pi/10))=850 +52 cos(pi/10)

Wait, but when I re-expressed sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)=2 cos(pi/10), which would make cos(pi/10)=sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)/2.

Therefore, 52 cos(pi/10)=26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

Therefore, S=850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

But in an earlier step, I thought the sum was -2 cos(pi/10), so S=850 +52 cos(pi/10)=850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

But, in another thought, I thought S=850 -104 cos(pi/10), but that was a miscalculation.

Wait, let me be precise.

From the sum of cos(theta)= -2 cos(pi/10). Therefore, S=850 -26*(sum cos(theta))=850 -26*(-2 cos(pi/10))=850 +52 cos(pi/10)

But if cos(pi/10)=sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)/2, then 52 cos(pi/10)=26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

Therefore, S=850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

Alternatively, since sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)=2 cos(pi/10), then 26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)=52 cos(pi/10). So, both expressions are equivalent.

Therefore, S=850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)=850 +52 cos(pi/10)

But wait, in the initial step, I thought that:

From the sum of cos(theta)= -2 cos(pi/10), so S=850 +52 cos(pi/10)=850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

Therefore, the final answer is 850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

But the problem asks for the value, so perhaps we can leave it in terms of sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5). Alternatively, we might need to compute the numerical value, but since it's exact, we can leave it as is.

But wait, let me see if 850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5) can be simplified or expressed in another form.

Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that 10 +2 sqrt5= (sqrt5 +1)^2, but sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)=sqrt5 +1?

Compute sqrt5 +1≈2.236 +1=3.236, but sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)=sqrt(10 +4.472)=sqrt(14.472)=approx 3.8, so no, it's not equal.

Alternatively, perhaps 10 +2 sqrt5= (sqrt5 +2)^2, but (sqrt5 +2)^2=5 +4 sqrt5 +4=9 +4 sqrt5, which is not equal to10 +2 sqrt5.

Alternatively, 10 +2 sqrt5= (sqrt5 + something)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps accept that it's not further reducible and present the answer as 850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

Thus, the final answer is 850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5). Alternatively, as 850 +52 cos(pi/10)

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in the form with radicals, so 850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5). Alternatively, the numerical value is approximately 850 +26*3.8≈850 +98.8≈948.8

But since the problem asks for the exact value, I think 850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5) is the answer.

But, hold on, let me check again the computation of the sum of cos(theta).

Earlier, I had:

Sum=cos(3pi/10) +0 -cos(3pi/10) -cos(pi/10) -cos(pi/10)= -2 cos(pi/10). Therefore, the sum is -2 cos(pi/10)

Therefore, S=850 -26*(-2 cos(pi/10))=850 +52 cos(pi/10)

But in the step before, I thought that the sum was -2 cos(pi/10). So, 52 cos(pi/10)=26*2 cos(pi/10)=26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5). So, S=850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5)

Therefore, the exact value is 850 +26 sqrt(10 +2 sqrt5). Thus, I think that's the answer.

Therefore, boxed, it is:

\boxed{850 + 26 \sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{850 + 26 \sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}
</think>

Given the polynomial equation \((x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}) = 0\), we need to find the value of \(\frac{1}{r_1^2} + \frac{1}{r_2^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{r_5^2}\), where \(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_{10}\) are the complex roots.

First, we rewrite the equation as:
\[ x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10} \]
Taking the 10th root of both sides, we get:
\[ x = \omega (13x - 1) \]
where \(\omega\) is a 10th root of -1. Solving for \(x\), we find:
\[ x = \frac{\omega}{13\omega - 1} \]

Each root \(r_k\) can be written as:
\[ r_k = \frac{\omega_k}{13\omega_k - 1} \]
where \(\omega_k = e^{i\pi(2k + 1)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 9\).

We need to compute the sum:
\[ \sum_{k=1}^{5} \frac{1}{r_k^2} \]

Using the identity for the modulus squared, we have:
\[ |r_k|^2 = \left| \frac{\omega_k}{13\omega_k - 1} \right|^2 = \frac{|\omega_k|^2}{|13\omega_k - 1|^2} = \frac{1}{|13\omega_k - 1|^2} \]

Thus, we need to find:
\[ \sum_{k=1}^{5} |13\omega_k - 1|^2 \]

Each term \(|13\omega_k - 1|^2\) can be expanded as:
\[ |13\omega_k - 1|^2 = 169 + 1 - 26 \text{Re}(\omega_k) = 170 - 26 \text{Re}(\omega_k) \]

We sum these terms for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 5\):
\[ \sum_{k=1}^{5} (170 - 26 \text{Re}(\omega_k)) = 5 \times 170 - 26 \sum_{k=1}^{5} \text{Re}(\omega_k) \]

The sum of the real parts of the roots \(\omega_k\) is computed as:
\[ \sum_{k=1}^{5} \text{Re}(\omega_k) = \sum_{k=1}^{5} \cos\left(\frac{\pi(2k + 1)}{10}\right) \]

Using trigonometric identities and simplifications, we find:
\[ \sum_{k=1}^{5} \cos\left(\frac{\pi(2k + 1)}{10}\right) = -2 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{10}\right) \]

Thus, the sum becomes:
\[ 850 - 26(-2 \cos(\pi/10)) = 850 + 52 \cos(\pi/10) \]

Recognizing that \(\cos(\pi/10) = \frac{\sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{2}\), we substitute:
\[ 52 \cos(\pi/10) = 26 \sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}} \]

Therefore, the value is:
\[ \boxed{850 + 26 \sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}} \]
