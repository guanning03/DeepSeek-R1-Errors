Question:
Rectangle $ABCD$ has center $O$ and $AB/AD=k$. A point is randomly chosen from the interior of rectangle $ABCD$. What is the probability that it is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices?  [asy]
size(200);
draw((-250,100)--(250,100)--(250,-100)--(-250,-100)--cycle);
dot((0,0));
label("$O$",(0,0),N);
label("$A$",(-250,100),NW); label("$B$",(250,100),NE); label("$C$",(250,-100),SE); label("$D$",(-250,-100),SW);[/asy]

Correct Answer:
The original rectangle may be subdivided into four smaller congruent rectangles, all sharing $O$ as a vertex. Each of these rectangles is analogous, so we can consider our random point $P$ to be without loss of generality in the smaller rectangle with $A$ as a vertex. All points in this smaller rectangle are closer to $A$ than they are to $B$, $C$, or $D$, so we just need to determine the probability that $OP<AP$. [asy]
size(100);
draw((0,0)--(0,100)--(-250,100)--(-250,0)--cycle);
label("$A$",(-250,100),NW); label("$O$",(0,0),SE);
draw((-105,100)--(-145,0));
fill((-105,100)--(-145,0)--(0,0)--(0,100)--cycle, gray(.7));
[/asy] Since a $180^\circ$ rotation about the center of the smaller rectangle takes $O$ to $A$, it takes the shaded region to the unshaded region. Therefore, exactly half the area is shaded, and the overall probability is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$, independent of $k$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O. The ratio of AB to AD is given as k. A point is randomly chosen from the interior of the rectangle, and I need to find the probability that this point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay.

First, let me try to visualize this. The rectangle has its center at O, so O is equidistant from all four sides. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, and all angles are right angles. The ratio of AB to AD is k, so if I let AB = k and AD = 1, for simplicity, then the rectangle has dimensions k by 1. Maybe I can scale it later if needed.

Now, the problem is about probability, so I know it's going to be the area of the region where the point is closer to O than any vertex divided by the total area of the rectangle. So, Probability = (Area where point is closer to O) / (Total area of rectangle). That makes sense.

So, I need to figure out the area within the rectangle where any point is closer to O than to A, B, C, or D. Since it's a rectangle, and O is the center, I suspect that the region where points are closer to O than to the vertices will be some shape in the center. Maybe another rectangle or an ellipse or something else.

Let me think. The set of points equidistant from two points is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting those two points. So, if I consider the distance from a point to O and to a vertex, the boundary between the regions where points are closer to O and closer to the vertex will be the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining O and that vertex.

Therefore, the region closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions defined by each of these perpendicular bisectors for each vertex. So, essentially, it's the area within the rectangle that's closer to O than to A, B, C, or D.

To find this area, I can find the equations of the perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex, and then find the intersection region.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let me place O at the origin (0,0). Since it's the center of the rectangle, and AB is the horizontal side, AD is vertical. Let me denote AB = k units and AD = 1 unit. So, the rectangle extends from (-k/2, -1/2) to (k/2, 1/2). Wait, actually, if AB is the horizontal side, then AB is length k, so each half of AB is k/2, and AD, being the vertical side, is length 1, so each half is 1/2.

So, the coordinates of the rectangle's vertices would be:
- A: (-k/2, 1/2)
- B: (k/2, 1/2)
- C: (k/2, -1/2)
- D: (-k/2, -1/2)

And center O is (0,0).

So, now, the four vertices are at those coordinates. Now, for each vertex, I need to find the set of points equidistant to O and that vertex. The region closer to O will be on one side of each of these bisectors.

Let me compute the perpendicular bisector between O and A first.

Point A is (-k/2, 1/2). O is (0,0). So, the segment OA connects (0,0) to (-k/2, 1/2). The midpoint of OA is (-k/4, 1/4). The slope of OA is (1/2 - 0)/(-k/2 - 0) = (1/2)/(-k/2) = -1/k. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector will have a slope of k, since it's the negative reciprocal.

So, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is y - 1/4 = k(x + k/4). Let me write that out:

y = kx + k*(k/4) + 1/4
y = kx + k²/4 + 1/4

Wait, let me check that again. The midpoint is (-k/4, 1/4). The slope is k, so using point-slope form:

y - 1/4 = k(x + k/4)

So, expanding that:

y = kx + (k^2)/4 + 1/4.

Hmm, okay.

Similarly, I can find the perpendicular bisectors for the other vertices.

Let me do vertex B: (k/2, 1/2). The segment OB connects (0,0) to (k/2, 1/2). The midpoint is (k/4, 1/4). The slope of OB is (1/2)/ (k/2) = 1/k, so the perpendicular bisector will have a slope of -k.

Equation: y - 1/4 = -k(x - k/4)

So, y = -kx + (k^2)/4 + 1/4.

Similarly, for vertex C: (k/2, -1/2). The segment OC connects (0,0) to (k/2, -1/2). Midpoint is (k/4, -1/4). The slope of OC is (-1/2)/ (k/2) = -1/k, so perpendicular bisector slope is k.

Equation: y + 1/4 = k(x - k/4)

Which is y = kx - (k^2)/4 - 1/4.

And for vertex D: (-k/2, -1/2). The segment OD connects (0,0) to (-k/2, -1/2). Midpoint is (-k/4, -1/4). Slope of OD is (-1/2)/(-k/2) = 1/k, so perpendicular bisector slope is -k.

Equation: y + 1/4 = -k(x + k/4)

Which is y = -kx - (k^2)/4 - 1/4.

So, now I have four lines:

1. From vertex A: y = kx + (k² + 1)/4
2. From vertex B: y = -kx + (k² + 1)/4
3. From vertex C: y = kx - (k² + 1)/4
4. From vertex D: y = -kx - (k² + 1)/4

Wait, hold on, no. Wait, let me write them again carefully.

From A: y = kx + (k²)/4 + 1/4 = kx + (k² + 1)/4
From B: y = -kx + (k²)/4 + 1/4 = -kx + (k² + 1)/4
From C: y = kx - (k²)/4 - 1/4
From D: y = -kx - (k²)/4 - 1/4

So, these are four lines. Now, the region where points are closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions defined by each of these four lines.

To figure out which side of each line is closer to O, I can test a point. For example, take the origin (0,0). Let's plug into each inequality.

For line from A: y = kx + (k² + 1)/4. At (0,0): 0 vs. (k² + 1)/4. Since (k² + 1)/4 is positive, the origin is below this line. So, the region closer to O would be below this line.

Similarly, for line from B: y = -kx + (k² + 1)/4. At (0,0): 0 vs. (k² + 1)/4. Again, origin is below this line, so region closer to O is below.

For line from C: y = kx - (k² + 1)/4. At (0,0): 0 vs. -(k² + 1)/4. Origin is above this line. So, region closer to O is above this line.

For line from D: y = -kx - (k² + 1)/4. At (0,0): 0 vs. -(k² + 1)/4. Origin is above this line, so region closer to O is above.

Therefore, the region where a point is closer to O than to any vertex is bounded by these four lines, specifically the area that is below both lines from A and B, and above both lines from C and D. So, it's a quadrilateral in the center.

Wait, actually, let me think. Because each pair of lines (from A and B, C and D) are symmetric across the center, so the region should be a convex polygon, possibly a rectangle or a diamond shape.

But let me try to visualize or sketch it. The four lines form a diamond, but depending on the value of k, the shape might vary.

Wait, maybe it's a rectangle rotated by 45 degrees, or maybe it's a square. Hmm, not necessarily. Let me find the intersection points of these lines.

Let's find where the lines from A and B intersect. So, solve y = kx + (k² + 1)/4 and y = -kx + (k² + 1)/4.

Setting them equal: kx + (k² + 1)/4 = -kx + (k² + 1)/4

So, 2kx = 0 => x = 0.

Then, y = (k² + 1)/4. So, the intersection is at (0, (k² + 1)/4).

Similarly, the lines from A and D: y = kx + (k² + 1)/4 and y = -kx - (k² + 1)/4.

Setting equal: kx + (k² + 1)/4 = -kx - (k² + 1)/4

2kx = - (k² + 1)/2

x = - (k² + 1)/(4k)

Then, y = k*(- (k² + 1)/(4k)) + (k² + 1)/4 = - (k² + 1)/4 + (k² + 1)/4 = 0

So, the intersection is at (- (k² + 1)/(4k), 0)

Similarly, lines from B and C: y = -kx + (k² + 1)/4 and y = kx - (k² + 1)/4.

Set equal: -kx + (k² + 1)/4 = kx - (k² + 1)/4

-2kx = - (k² + 1)/2

x = (k² + 1)/(4k)

Then, y = k*( (k² + 1)/(4k) ) - (k² +1)/4 = (k² +1)/4 - (k² +1)/4 = 0

So, intersection at ( (k² +1)/(4k), 0 )

Similarly, lines from C and D: y = kx - (k² +1)/4 and y = -kx - (k² +1)/4.

Set equal: kx - (k² +1)/4 = -kx - (k² +1)/4

2kx = 0 => x = 0

Then, y = 0 - (k² +1)/4 = - (k² +1)/4

So, intersection at (0, - (k² +1)/4 )

Therefore, the four intersection points are:

1. (0, (k² +1)/4 )

2. (- (k² +1)/(4k), 0 )

3. ( (k² +1)/(4k), 0 )

4. (0, - (k² +1)/4 )

So, connecting these points, the region closer to O is a diamond (a rhombus) centered at the origin with vertices at those four points.

Therefore, the region is a rhombus with diagonals along the x and y axes.

The lengths of the diagonals are:

- Along the y-axis: from (0, (k² +1)/4 ) to (0, - (k² +1)/4 ), so the length is (k² +1)/4 - (- (k² +1)/4 ) = (k² +1)/2.

- Along the x-axis: from (- (k² +1)/(4k), 0 ) to ( (k² +1)/(4k), 0 ), so the length is ( (k² +1)/(4k) ) - ( - (k² +1)/(4k) ) = (k² +1)/(2k).

For a rhombus, the area is (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. So, plugging in:

Area = [ ( (k² +1)/2 ) * ( (k² +1)/(2k) ) ] / 2

Wait, no, wait. The formula for the area of a rhombus is (d1 * d2)/2, but actually, wait, no, hold on. Let me recall.

In a rhombus, area can be calculated as (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. So, yes, that's correct.

So, substituting:

d1 = (k² +1)/2

d2 = (k² +1)/(2k)

Therefore, Area = ( (k² +1)/2 ) * ( (k² +1)/(2k) ) / 2

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, the formula is (d1 * d2)/2.

So, Area = [ (k² +1)/2 * (k² +1)/(2k) ] / 2 ?

Wait, no, no. Wait, let me clarify. The area is (d1 * d2)/2.

So, d1 is (k² +1)/2, d2 is (k² +1)/(2k). So, multiplying them:

d1 * d2 = [ (k² +1)/2 ] * [ (k² +1)/(2k) ] = (k² +1)^2 / (4k)

Then, Area = (d1 * d2)/2 = (k² +1)^2 / (8k)

Wait, is that correct? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, hold on. Actually, the formula is (d1 * d2)/2, so if d1 and d2 are the diagonals, then area is half the product.

So, Area = ( ( (k² +1)/2 ) * ( (k² +1)/(2k) ) ) / 2

Wait, no, no, that's incorrect. Actually, Area = (d1 * d2)/2.

So, if d1 is (k² +1)/2 and d2 is (k² +1)/(2k), then:

Area = [ (k² +1)/2 * (k² +1)/(2k) ] / 2

Wait, that seems too much. Wait, no, actually, no division by 2 again.

Wait, no, let me just compute it step by step.

d1 = length of vertical diagonal = (k² +1)/2

d2 = length of horizontal diagonal = (k² +1)/(2k)

Then, Area = (d1 * d2) / 2 = [ (k² +1)/2 * (k² +1)/(2k) ] / 2

Wait, hold on, that's not correct because the formula is (d1 * d2)/2, not divided by 2 again. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me confirm. The area of a rhombus is (d1 * d2)/2.

So, if d1 = (k² +1)/2 and d2 = (k² +1)/(2k), then:

Area = [ (k² +1)/2 * (k² +1)/(2k) ] / 2

Wait, no, that would be (d1 * d2) / 2. So, it's [ (k² +1)/2 * (k² +1)/(2k) ] / 2.

Wait, that's ( (k² +1)^2 ) / (8k ) / 2, which is (k² +1)^2 / (16k ). That seems too small. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of coordinates. Since we have the vertices of the rhombus, we can use the shoelace formula to compute the area.

The four vertices are:

1. (0, (k² +1)/4 )

2. (- (k² +1)/(4k), 0 )

3. (0, - (k² +1)/4 )

4. ( (k² +1)/(4k), 0 )

So, let's list them in order:

(0, (k² +1)/4 ), (- (k² +1)/(4k), 0 ), (0, - (k² +1)/4 ), ( (k² +1)/(4k), 0 ), back to (0, (k² +1)/4 )

Using shoelace formula:

Area = 1/2 |sum over i (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|

Let me compute each term:

First, list of points:

1. (0, (k² +1)/4 ) = (x1, y1)
2. (- (k² +1)/(4k), 0 ) = (x2, y2)
3. (0, - (k² +1)/4 ) = (x3, y3)
4. ( (k² +1)/(4k), 0 ) = (x4, y4)
5. Back to (0, (k² +1)/4 ) = (x5, y5)

Compute each term:

Term1: x1 y2 - x2 y1 = 0*0 - (- (k² +1)/(4k)) * ( (k² +1)/4 ) = 0 + (k² +1)^2 / (16k )

Term2: x2 y3 - x3 y2 = (- (k² +1)/(4k)) * (- (k² +1)/4 ) - 0 * 0 = (k² +1)^2 / (16k ) - 0 = (k² +1)^2 / (16k )

Term3: x3 y4 - x4 y3 = 0 * 0 - ( (k² +1)/(4k) ) * (- (k² +1)/4 ) = 0 + (k² +1)^2 / (16k )

Term4: x4 y5 - x5 y4 = ( (k² +1)/(4k) ) * ( (k² +1)/4 ) - 0 * 0 = (k² +1)^2 / (16k ) - 0 = (k² +1)^2 / (16k )

Adding all terms:

Term1 + Term2 + Term3 + Term4 = 4 * (k² +1)^2 / (16k ) = (k² +1)^2 / (4k )

Then, Area = 1/2 * | sum | = 1/2 * (k² +1)^2 / (4k ) = (k² +1)^2 / (8k )

So, that's consistent with the earlier calculation, except that I had a confusion about whether to divide by 2 again, but in reality, the shoelace formula already gives the area as 1/2 times the sum, so the total area is (k² +1)^2 / (8k )

Wait, no, wait, hold on. Let me clarify.

Wait, in the shoelace formula, for a polygon with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ..., (xn,yn), (x1,y1), the area is 1/2 |sum_{i=1 to n} (xi yi+1 - xi+1 yi)|.

So, in our case, the sum was Term1 + Term2 + Term3 + Term4, each equal to (k² +1)^2 / (16k ). So, total sum is 4*(k² +1)^2 / (16k ) = (k² +1)^2 / (4k )

Then, area is 1/2 times that, so:

Area = 1/2 * (k² +1)^2 / (4k ) = (k² +1)^2 / (8k )

Yes, so that's correct.

So, the area of the region where points are closer to O than to any vertex is (k² +1)^2 / (8k )

Now, the total area of the rectangle is length * width = AB * AD = k * 1 = k.

Wait, hold on. Wait, earlier I set AB = k and AD =1, but in the Asymptote code, it's given as (-250,100), (250,100), etc., which suggests that the rectangle is 200 units long (from -250 to 250) and 200 units tall (from -100 to 100). Hmm, but in the problem statement, it's called rectangle ABCD with center O, and AB/AD = k.

But in my coordinate system, I set AB = k and AD =1, so perhaps in general, the rectangle has length k and width 1, with center at (0,0).

But when I did the shoelace formula, the area came out to (k² +1)^2 / (8k ), but wait, in the Asymptote code, it's symmetric with AB and AD both being 500 units. Wait, maybe I need to adjust.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the coordinate system. Let me double-check.

Wait, in my coordinate system, I considered AB to be horizontal, with length k, and AD to be vertical, with length 1. But in the Asymptote code, it's from -250 to 250 on x-axis (total length 500) and -100 to 100 on y-axis (total height 200). So, in the Asymptote code, AB is 500 and AD is 200, so the ratio AB/AD is 500/200 = 2.5, so k=2.5 in that case.

But in the problem statement, it's general, with AB/AD = k. So, perhaps I should keep AB as k and AD as 1, as I did earlier.

So, in that case, the area of the rectangle is AB * AD = k * 1 = k.

Therefore, the probability is [ (k² +1)^2 / (8k ) ] / k = (k² +1)^2 / (8k² )

Simplify that: (k² +1)^2 / (8k² )

Alternatively, expand the numerator: (k^4 + 2k² +1 ) / (8k² ) = (k^4)/(8k² ) + (2k²)/(8k² ) + 1/(8k² ) = (k²)/8 + 1/4 + 1/(8k² )

So, the probability is (k²)/8 + 1/4 + 1/(8k² )

But perhaps it's better to leave it as (k² +1)^2 / (8k² )

Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, in my coordinate system, I placed O at (0,0), and the rectangle with vertices at (-k/2, 1/2), (k/2, 1/2), etc.

Wait, but when I calculated the area of the region closer to O, I used the shoelace formula on the four vertices, which gave me (k² +1)^2 / (8k )

But the total area of the rectangle is k*1 = k.

Therefore, the probability is [ (k² +1)^2 / (8k ) ] / k = (k² +1)^2 / (8k² )

Yes, that's correct.

So, simplifying, (k² +1)^2 / (8k² ) = (k^4 + 2k² +1 ) / (8k² ) = (k^4)/(8k² ) + (2k²)/(8k² ) + 1/(8k² ) = (k²)/8 + 1/4 + 1/(8k² )

Alternatively, we can write it as [ (k² +1)^2 ] / (8k² )

Either way, both expressions are correct.

But let me see if this can be simplified more or if I made an error.

Wait, let me test this with k=1, which is a square. Then, the probability should be 1/4, since in a square, the region closer to the center than to any vertex is a smaller square in the center.

Wait, let's plug in k=1 into my formula:

(1 +1)^2 / (8*1 ) = 4 /8 = 0.5

But that's not 1/4. Hmm, that suggests that my formula is incorrect.

Wait, that can't be. If k=1, it's a square, then the region closer to the center than to any vertex is a square with half the area?

Wait, no, let me think again. If it's a square, the region where points are closer to the center than to any vertex is actually a smaller square rotated by 45 degrees, whose vertices are the centers of the sides of the original square.

Wait, so in a unit square, the region closer to the center than to any vertex would have vertices at (0.5,0.5), but wait, no, that's the center. Wait, no, the points equidistant to the center and the vertices.

Wait, in a square with side length s, the region closer to the center than to any vertex is another square rotated by 45 degrees, whose distance from the center to its sides is s/4.

Wait, actually, the distance from center to a vertex is (s√2)/2, and the distance from center to the edge is s/2.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute for k=1, the area.

Wait, let me try k=1.

In this case, rectangle is a square with side length 1 (AD=1, AB=1). So, the center is at (0,0).

The region closer to O than to any vertex is a square rotated by 45 degrees.

Wait, actually, no. The set of points closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions closer to O than to each vertex. For a square, this intersection is an octagon or something else?

Wait, no, actually, for a square, the set of points closer to the center than to any vertex is another square rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at the midpoints of the original square's edges.

Wait, the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side is 0.5, and the distance from the center to a vertex is √(0.5² +0.5² ) = √0.5 ≈ 0.707.

So, the region closer to the center than to any vertex would be a square whose distance from the center to each side is the same as the distance from the center to the midpoint of the original square's sides, which is 0.5.

Wait, but actually, the perpendicular distance from the center to the sides of the new square would be equal to the distance from the center to the vertices of the original square.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the area.

Wait, for k=1, the formula I derived gave me (1 +1)^2 / (8*1 ) = 4/8 = 0.5. But in reality, for a unit square, the area closer to the center than to any vertex is actually 1/2, because it's a square with half the area.

Wait, but wait, let me visualize it. If the original square has side length 1, then the region closer to the center than to any vertex is a square whose sides are at a distance where the distance from center to any point on the side is equal to the distance from that point to the nearest vertex.

Wait, let me compute.

The distance from center to a point (x,y) is sqrt(x² + y² )

The distance to the nearest vertex is the minimum of sqrt( (x - 0.5)^2 + y² ), sqrt( (x +0.5)^2 + y² ), sqrt( x² + (y -0.5)^2 ), sqrt( x² + (y +0.5)^2 )

But actually, for points closer to the center, the distance to the center is less than the distance to any of the four vertices.

So, for a unit square, the region is defined by sqrt(x² + y² ) < sqrt( (x - 0.5)^2 + y² ), which simplifies to x² + y² < (x - 0.5)^2 + y² => x² < x² -x +0.25 => 0 < -x +0.25 => x < 0.25.

Similarly, the condition with other vertices will give similar inequalities.

So, the region closer to the center is actually the intersection where |x| < 0.25 and |y| < 0.25.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because if you have a point (0,0), it's closer to the center, but (0.25,0) is equidistant to center and to the vertex (0.5,0). Similarly, (0,0.25) is equidistant to center and to (0,0.5).

So, the region is actually a square with side length 0.5 centered at the origin.

Therefore, the area is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

But according to my formula, with k=1, I get 0.5, which is incorrect.

Therefore, my formula must be wrong.

Wait, so clearly, the formula (k² +1)^2 / (8k² ) is incorrect because when k=1, it gives 0.5, but the correct area is 0.25.

So, where did I go wrong?

Let me go back to the shoelace calculation.

Wait, when I set up the rectangle with AB = k and AD =1, but in the Asymptote code, the rectangle is symmetric, but in my coordinate system, I have AB =k, AD=1, so the rectangle is not necessarily symmetric in x and y unless k=1.

Wait, but in my setup, I considered AB to be along x-axis, so AB has length k, and AD has length 1, so the rectangle is longer in x-direction if k>1, and taller in y-direction if k<1.

But when k=1, it's a square, but in that case, the region closer to center is a smaller square with half the side length, so area 1/4.

Wait, so perhaps my mistake is in the shoelace formula.

Wait, let me re-examine the shoelace calculation.

So, the four points are:

1. (0, (k² +1)/4 )

2. (- (k² +1)/(4k), 0 )

3. (0, - (k² +1)/4 )

4. ( (k² +1)/(4k), 0 )

So, the shoelace formula requires the points to be ordered either clockwise or counterclockwise without crossing.

I ordered them as:

1. Top center

2. Left center

3. Bottom center

4. Right center

Then back to top center.

So, computing the shoelace sum:

Compute x1 y2 - x2 y1:

0 * 0 - (- (k² +1)/(4k )) * ( (k² +1)/4 ) = 0 + (k² +1)^2 / (16k )

Similarly, x2 y3 - x3 y2:

(- (k² +1)/(4k )) * (- (k² +1)/4 ) - 0 * 0 = (k² +1)^2 / (16k ) - 0 = (k² +1)^2 / (16k )

x3 y4 - x4 y3:

0 * 0 - ( (k² +1)/(4k )) * (- (k² +1)/4 ) = 0 + (k² +1)^2 / (16k )

x4 y1 - x1 y4:

( (k² +1)/(4k )) * ( (k² +1)/4 ) - 0 * 0 = (k² +1)^2 / (16k ) - 0 = (k² +1)^2 / (16k )

Total sum: 4 * (k² +1)^2 / (16k ) = (k² +1)^2 / (4k )

Then, area is 1/2 of that absolute value: 1/2 * (k² +1)^2 / (4k ) = (k² +1)^2 / (8k )

But when k=1, that gives (1 +1)^2 / (8*1 ) = 4/8 = 0.5, which is wrong because the correct area is 0.25.

Wait, so perhaps my initial assumption about the region is incorrect.

Wait, when k=1, the region is a square of side 0.5, area 0.25, but according to the formula, it's 0.5. So, that suggests that the region is twice as big as it should be.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the definition of the rhombus.

Wait, perhaps the region is not the rhombus but another shape.

Wait, let me think again. The region where points are closer to O than to any vertex is actually bounded by four parabolas, not straight lines.

Wait, no, in 2D, the set of points equidistant to a point and a line is a parabola. But here, it's the set of points equidistant to a point and another point.

Wait, no, actually, the set of points equidistant to two points is the perpendicular bisector.

Wait, yes, so the equidistant set between O and A is the perpendicular bisector of OA, which is the line we computed earlier.

So, the region closer to O than to A is one side of that line, and similarly for the other vertices.

So, the intersection of all four regions is indeed the quadrilateral we computed, which is a rhombus.

But when k=1, according to the shoelace formula, the area is 0.5, but in reality, the area should be 0.25.

So, something is wrong here.

Wait, maybe the rhombus is not entirely within the rectangle.

Wait, when k=1, the rectangle is a square with vertices at (-0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, -0.5), (-0.5, -0.5 )

And the rhombus has vertices at (0, 0.5 ), (-0.5, 0 ), (0, -0.5 ), (0.5, 0 )

So, the rhombus with vertices at midpoints of the sides of the square, which is actually a square rotated by 45 degrees with side length sqrt(0.5 )

Wait, but then the area of that rhombus is (d1 * d2 ) /2, where d1 and d2 are the diagonals.

In this case, the rhombus has diagonals of length 1 (from (0,0.5 ) to (0,-0.5 )) and 1 (from (-0.5, 0 ) to (0.5, 0 )). So, area is (1 *1 ) /2 = 0.5.

But in reality, in the unit square, the region closer to the center than to any vertex is actually a smaller square in the center with side length 0.5, area 0.25.

Wait, so why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, maybe the rhombus I computed is not the correct region. Perhaps the region is actually a square with side length 0.5.

Wait, but according to the equidistant lines, the region closer to O than to A is the area below the line y = x + (k² +1 ) /4.

Wait, in the case when k=1, the line from A ( -0.5, 0.5 ) to (0,0 ) is y = -x + 0.5.

Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, the perpendicular bisector was y = kx + (k² +1 ) /4, which when k=1, is y = x + 0.5.

Wait, but that seems incorrect because the midpoint between O and A is (-0.25, 0.25 ), and the slope is 1.

So, the perpendicular bisector is y = x + 0.5. But when x=0, y=0.5, which is above the center.

Wait, but that can't be, because the region closer to O than to A should be below that line.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the slope.

Wait, when k=1, the slope of OA is (0.5 -0)/( -0.5 -0 ) = -1, so the perpendicular bisector has slope 1.

And it passes through midpoint (-0.25, 0.25 ). So, equation is y - 0.25 = 1*(x + 0.25 ), so y = x + 0.5.

So, yes, that is correct.

So, the region closer to O than to A is below the line y = x + 0.5.

Similarly, the region closer to O than to B is below y = -x + 0.5.

Closer to O than to C is above y = -x - 0.5.

Closer to O than to D is above y = x - 0.5.

So, the intersection of these four regions is the area bounded by:

y < x + 0.5,

y < -x + 0.5,

y > -x -0.5,

y > x -0.5.

So, in the case when k=1, this region is a square with vertices at (0,0.5 ), (-0.5,0 ), (0,-0.5 ), (0.5,0 )

Wait, but this is a diamond shape, which is a square rotated by 45 degrees, with diagonals of length 1 along the x and y axes.

Wait, so the area of this square is (d1 * d2 ) /2 = (1 *1 ) /2 =0.5.

But in reality, when k=1, the region should be a square with side length 0.5, area 0.25.

Wait, so that suggests that the region closer to O than to any vertex is actually half of what I computed.

Wait, perhaps I have an error in my coordinate system.

Wait, in reality, for a unit square, the region closer to the center is actually a square with side length 0.5, but in my shoelace formula, I computed the area as 0.5.

So, perhaps my mistake is that the region closer to O than to any vertex is not a rhombus, but rather a square.

Wait, but according to the perpendicular bisectors, it's a rhombus.

Alternatively, perhaps my mistake is that the region is not the rhombus but the intersection of all four half-planes. Let me think.

Wait, let me plot the four lines:

1. y = x + 0.5

2. y = -x + 0.5

3. y = -x -0.5

4. y = x -0.5

These four lines form a diamond shape (rotated square) with vertices at (0,0.5 ), (-0.5,0 ), (0,-0.5 ), (0.5,0 )

So, it's a square rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at those points.

But when I compute the area of this, it's 0.5, but in reality, the region closer to the center is a smaller square.

Wait, perhaps the region is not the entire diamond, but the central region where all four inequalities are satisfied.

Wait, no, all four inequalities define the intersection, which is the diamond. So, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps in reality, when k=1, the region closer to O is the central square with vertices at (0,0.5 ), (0.5,0 ), (0,-0.5 ), (-0.5, 0 )

Wait, but this is the same diamond.

Wait, but in that case, the area is indeed 0.5, but according to my intuition, in a unit square, the region closer to the center is a square of side 0.5, area 0.25.

Wait, perhaps my intuition is wrong.

Wait, let me compute the distance from O to a point in that region.

Take the point (0,0.5 ). The distance to O is 0.5, distance to vertex A (-0.5,0.5 ) is sqrt( (0.5)^2 +0 )=0.5. So, equidistant.

Similarly, point (0.5,0 ): distance to O is 0.5, distance to vertex B (0.5,0.5 ) is sqrt(0 +0.5^2 )=0.5.

So, all four points are equidistant.

Wait, so the boundary is the diamond, and the region inside is closer to O.

But in reality, the central square would have points closer to O.

Wait, perhaps in the unit square, the region closer to O is the diamond, which has area 0.5, which is half of the square. So, that's correct.

Wait, but I thought initially that it was a smaller square, but in reality, it's the diamond.

So, that suggests that my formula is correct, and my intuition was wrong.

Therefore, for k=1, the probability is 0.5, but the total area is 1, so probability is 0.5.

Wait, but in my earlier thought process, I thought it was 0.25, but that was incorrect.

Wait, actually, no, wait. The region closer to O is the diamond with area 0.5, so the probability is 0.5.

But actually, in the unit square, the set of points closer to center than to any vertex is indeed the diamond, which has area 0.5, so the probability is 0.5.

Wait, so that is correct.

But I initially thought it's a smaller square, which was wrong.

So, that suggests that for k=1, the probability is 0.5, which is consistent with my formula.

Wait, so when k=1, (k² +1)^2 / (8k² ) = (1 +1)^2 / (8*1 )= 4 /8= 0.5.

So, that is correct.

Similarly, let's test another value, say k=2.

So, for k=2, the rectangle has AB=2, AD=1.

The region closer to O is a rhombus with vertices at (0, (4 +1)/4 )= (0,1.25 ), (- (4 +1)/(4*2 ), 0 )= (-5/8, 0 ), (0, -1.25 ), (5/8, 0 )

So, the rhombus has vertices at (0,1.25 ), (-0.625,0 ), (0,-1.25 ), (0.625,0 )

So, the area is (d1 * d2 ) /2 = (2.5 *1.25 ) /2= (3.125 ) /2=1.5625.

The total area of the rectangle is AB * AD= 2 *1=2.

So, the probability is 1.5625 /2=0.78125=25/32.

But according to my formula, (k² +1)^2 / (8k² ) when k=2 is (4 +1)^2 / (32 )=25 /32≈0.78125, which matches.

So, this shows that the formula works.

Therefore, the probability is (k² +1 )² / (8k² )

Thus, the answer is (k² +1 )² / (8k² )

But let me write it in a simplified form.

(k² +1 )² / (8k² )= (k^4 +2k² +1 ) / (8k² )= (k^4)/(8k² ) + (2k² )/(8k² ) +1/(8k² )= (k²)/8 + 1/4 +1/(8k² )

So, that's another way to write it.

Alternatively, factor as [ (k² +1 ) / (2√2 k ) ]^2, but probably not necessary.

So, the probability is (k² +1 )² / (8k² )

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{8k^2}}

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{8k^2}}.

Rectangle \(ABCD\) has center \(O\) and \(AB/AD = k\). We need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point from the interior of the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices.

1. **Setting up the coordinate system**:
   - Place \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\).
   - The vertices of the rectangle are \(A(-k/2, 1/2)\), \(B(k/2, 1/2)\), \(C(k/2, -1/2)\), and \(D(-k/2, -1/2)\).

2. **Perpendicular bisectors**:
   - The region where points are closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of the segments joining \(O\) to each vertex.
   - The equations of these bisectors are derived and found to be:
     - \(y = kx + (k^2 + 1)/4\)
     - \(y = -kx + (k^2 + 1)/4\)
     - \(y = kx - (k^2 + 1)/4\)
     - \(y = -kx - (k^2 + 1)/4\)

3. **Intersection points**:
   - These bisectors intersect at four points forming a rhombus:
     - \((0, (k^2 + 1)/4)\)
     - \((- (k^2 + 1)/(4k), 0)\)
     - \((0, - (k^2 + 1)/4)\)
     - \(( (k^2 + 1)/(4k), 0)\)

4. **Area calculation**:
   - The lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus are calculated.
   - The area of the rhombus is found using the formula \((d_1 \cdot d_2)/2\), where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals.
   - The area of the rhombus is \(\frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{8k}\).

5. **Total area of the rectangle**:
   - The total area of the rectangle is \(k \cdot 1 = k\).

6. **Probability calculation**:
   - The probability is the ratio of the area of the rhombus to the total area of the rectangle:
     \[
     \text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{8k}}{k} = \frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{8k^2}
     \]

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is \(\boxed{\dfrac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{8k^2}}\).
