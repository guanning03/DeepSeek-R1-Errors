Question:
There are 360 people in my school.  15 take calculus, physics, and chemistry, and 15 don't take any of them.  180 take calculus.  Twice as many students take chemistry as take physics.  75 take both calculus and chemistry, and 75 take both physics and chemistry.  Only 30 take both physics and calculus.  How many students take physics?

Correct Answer:
Let $x$ be the number of students taking physics, so the number in chemistry is $2x$.  There are 15 students taking all three, and 30 students in both physics and calculus, meaning there are $30 - 15 = 15$ students in just physics and calculus.  Similarly there are $60$ students in just chemistry and calculus, and $60$ in physics and chemistry.  Since there are $x$ students in physics and $15 + 15 + 60 = 90$ students taking physics along with other classes, $x - 90$ students are just taking physics.  Similarly, there are $2x - 135$ students taking just chemistry and $90$ students taking just calculus.  Knowing that there are 15 students not taking any of them, the sum of these eight categories is 360, the total number of people at the school:   \[
(x - 90) + (2x - 135) + 90 + 60 + 15 + 60 + 15 + 15 = 360.
\] We solve for $x$ and find that the number of physics students is $x = \boxed{110}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. It seems a bit complex with all these overlapping subjects, but if I break it down, maybe I can manage it.

First, let me list out all the given information:

- Total number of people in the school: 360
- Number of students taking all three subjects (calculus, physics, chemistry): 15
- Number of students not taking any of the three subjects: 15
- Number of students taking calculus: 180
- Number of students taking chemistry is twice the number taking physics. So, if I let the number of students taking physics be P, then the number taking chemistry would be 2P.
- Number of students taking both calculus and chemistry: 75
- Number of students taking both physics and chemistry: 75
- Number of students taking both physics and calculus: 30

And the question is: How many students take physics?

Hmm, okay, so maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. That principle is usually helpful for problems involving overlapping sets.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets. For three sets A, B, and C, the formula is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

In this case, A is calculus, B is physics, and C is chemistry. So, plugging in the numbers I have:

|A| = 180 (students taking calculus)
|B| = P (students taking physics)
|C| = 2P (students taking chemistry)
|A ∩ B| = 30 (students taking both calculus and physics)
|A ∩ C| = 75 (students taking both calculus and chemistry)
|B ∩ C| = 75 (students taking both physics and chemistry)
|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 15 (students taking all three)

But wait, we also know that 15 students don't take any of these subjects. So, the total number of students taking at least one subject is 360 - 15 = 345.

Therefore, |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 345.

Now, let's plug everything into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15

Let me simplify this step by step.

First, combine like terms:

345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15

Combine the P terms: P + 2P = 3P

Combine the constants: 180 - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15

Calculating that:

180 - 30 = 150

150 - 75 = 75

75 - 75 = 0

0 + 15 = 15

So now the equation simplifies to:

345 = 3P + 15

Subtract 15 from both sides:

345 - 15 = 3P

330 = 3P

Divide both sides by 3:

P = 110

So, the number of students taking physics is 110.

But wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting again:

Total students in the school: 360

Students not taking any: 15

Therefore, students taking at least one subject: 360 - 15 = 345.

That part is correct.

Number of students taking calculus: 180

Number of students taking physics: P

Number taking chemistry: 2P

Intersections:

Calculus and physics: 30

Calculus and chemistry: 75

Physics and chemistry: 75

All three: 15

So, plug into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

Which is:

345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15

Calculating the constants:

180 - 30 = 150

150 - 75 = 75

75 - 75 = 0

0 + 15 = 15

So, 345 = 180 + 3P - 150 + 15

Wait, hold on, maybe I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, let me recast that:

180 + P + 2P is 180 + 3P

Then subtract 30, 75, 75: So subtract (30 + 75 + 75) = 180

Then add 15.

So, 345 = 180 + 3P - 180 + 15

Simplify:

180 - 180 = 0

So, 345 = 3P + 15

Yes, same as before.

345 - 15 = 330 = 3P

Therefore, P = 110.

Hmm, seems consistent.

But let me think again: if P is 110, then the number of students taking chemistry is 2P = 220.

Is that possible?

Wait, let's check if 110 physics, 180 calculus, 220 chemistry, with the overlaps as given.

But let me see if the total number of students in these classes adds up correctly.

Wait, perhaps I can use another approach: constructing a Venn diagram with three circles.

Let me denote:

Only calculus: C

Only physics: P

Only chemistry: Ch

Calculus and physics only: 30

Calculus and chemistry only: 75

Physics and chemistry only: 75

All three: 15

So, let me denote:

Only calculus: C = total calculus - (calculus & physics only) - (calculus & chemistry only) - (all three)

So, C = 180 - 30 - 75 - 15 = 180 - 120 = 60

Similarly, Only physics: P_only = P - (calculus & physics only) - (physics & chemistry only) - (all three)

Which is P - 30 - 75 - 15

That is P - 120

Only chemistry: Ch_only = 2P - (calculus & chemistry only) - (physics & chemistry only) - (all three)

Which is 2P - 75 - 75 - 15 = 2P - 165

Now, adding up all these only sections and the overlaps should give us the total number of students taking at least one subject, which is 345.

So, let's write the equation:

Only C + Only P + Only Ch + (Calculus & Physics only) + (Calculus & Chem only) + (Physics & Chem only) + (All three) = 345

Plugging in the numbers:

60 + (P - 120) + (2P - 165) + 30 + 75 + 75 + 15 = 345

Simplify step by step:

First, compute each part:

Only C: 60

Only P: P - 120

Only Ch: 2P - 165

Calculus & Physics only: 30

Calculus & Chem only: 75

Physics & Chem only: 75

All three: 15

Adding all together:

60 + (P - 120) + (2P - 165) + 30 + 75 + 75 + 15

Combine like terms:

Constants: 60 - 120 - 165 + 30 + 75 + 75 + 15

Compute constants:

60 - 120 = -60

-60 - 165 = -225

-225 + 30 = -195

-195 +75 = -120

-120 +75 = -45

-45 +15 = -30

Variables: P + 2P = 3P

So, total equation is:

3P - 30 = 345

So, 3P = 345 + 30 = 375

Therefore, P = 375 / 3 = 125

Wait a minute, this is different from my earlier result of 110.

Hmm, that's concerning. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me check my calculations again.

In the second approach:

Only C: 180 - 30 -75 -15 = 60

Only P: P - 30 -75 -15 = P - 120

Only Ch: 2P -75 -75 -15 = 2P - 165

Then, adding all the sections:

60 + (P - 120) + (2P - 165) + 30 + 75 +75 +15

Compute constants:

60 -120 -165 +30 +75 +75 +15

60 -120 = -60

-60 -165 = -225

-225 +30 = -195

-195 +75 = -120

-120 +75 = -45

-45 +15 = -30

Variables: P + 2P = 3P

So, 3P -30 = 345

3P = 345 +30 = 375

P = 125

Hmm, so now I get P=125, which contradicts my earlier answer of 110.

Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, maybe in the first approach, I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion formula.

Let me check that again.

First approach:

Total students taking at least one subject: 345

Inclusion-exclusion:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

So, 345 = 180 + P + 2P -30 -75 -75 +15

Which is 345 = 180 +3P -180 +15

Wait, 180 +3P -30 -75 -75 +15

Compute step by step:

180 -30 = 150

150 -75 =75

75 -75 =0

0 +15=15

So, 345 = 180 +3P -180 +15

Simplify: 180 -180 =0; 345 = 3P +15

So, 345 -15=330=3P

Thus, P=110

But in the second approach, I get P=125. Hmm, conflicting results.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach.

In the second approach, maybe I have an error in the Only P calculation.

Wait, Only P is P - (Calculus and Physics only) - (Physics and Chemistry only) - (All three)

So, Only P = P -30 -75 -15 = P -120

But in the inclusion-exclusion formula, is that correct?

Wait, in the inclusion-exclusion, it's |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

So, if I represent |A| as 180, which includes all calculus students: Only calculus, Calculus & Physics, Calculus & Chem, and All three.

Similarly, |B| is P, which includes Only P, P&C, P&Ch, and All three.

Similarly, |C| is 2P, which includes Only Ch, Ch&C, Ch&P, and All three.

So, when I do |A| + |B| + |C|, that's counting Only C, Only P, Only Ch, Calculus & Physics, Calculus & Chem, Physics & Chem, and 3 times All three.

Then, subtracting |A ∩ B|, |A ∩ C|, |B ∩ C|, which are Calculus & Physics, Calculus & Chem, Physics & Chem, each subtracted once. So, that removes their double counts.

But then we have added back |A ∩ B ∩ C| once, which was subtracted three times in the previous step.

So, in the inclusion-exclusion formula, it's correct.

Wait, but in the second approach, when I broke down Only C, Only P, Only Ch, and the overlaps, and added them up, I got 3P -30 =345, giving me P=125.

But in the first approach, I got P=110.

So, there must be a mistake in one of these calculations.

Wait, let me check the second approach again.

Only C: 60

Only P: P -30 -75 -15 = P -120

Only Ch: 2P -75 -75 -15 = 2P -165

Calculus & Physics only:30

Calculus & Chem only:75

Physics & Chem only:75

All three:15

Adding all these:

60 + (P -120) + (2P -165) +30 +75 +75 +15

Calculate step by step:

60 + P -120 +2P -165 +30 +75 +75 +15

Combine like terms:

Constants: 60 -120 -165 +30 +75 +75 +15

60 -120 = -60

-60 -165 = -225

-225 +30 = -195

-195 +75 = -120

-120 +75 = -45

-45 +15 = -30

Variables: P +2P =3P

So, 3P -30 =345

Thus, 3P =345 +30=375

So, P=125

Hmm, so in this case, P=125.

But in the first approach, I get P=110.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first approach.

Wait, in the first approach, I used the inclusion-exclusion formula:

345 =180 + P +2P -30 -75 -75 +15

Which is 345=180 +3P -180 +15

Simplify: 180-180=0, so 345=3P +15, so 3P=330, P=110

But in the second approach, I get 125.

Wait, how can these two approaches give different answers?

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the inclusion-exclusion formula.

Wait, let me check the inclusion-exclusion formula again.

The formula is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

So, in this case, |A| =180, |B|=P, |C|=2P

|A ∩ B|=30, |A ∩ C|=75, |B ∩ C|=75

|A ∩ B ∩ C|=15

Therefore, plugging into the formula:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| =180 + P +2P -30 -75 -75 +15

=180 +3P -30 -75 -75 +15

= (180 -30) + (3P) + (-75 -75 +15)

=150 +3P -120 +15

=150 -120 +15 +3P

=45 +3P

Therefore, |A ∪ B ∪ C| =3P +45

But we know |A ∪ B ∪ C|=345

Therefore, 3P +45=345

Subtract 45: 3P=300

Thus, P=100

Wait, now I get P=100.

Wait, that's different from both previous answers.

Hmm, so now I have 3 different answers: 110, 125, and 100.

Wait, that can't be. Maybe I messed up the calculations again.

Wait, let me do it step by step.

Compute |A ∪ B ∪ C| using inclusion-exclusion:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

So, plugging in numbers:

=180 + P +2P -30 -75 -75 +15

Compute each operation:

First, 180 + P +2P =180 +3P

Then subtract 30: 180 +3P -30=150 +3P

Subtract 75: 150 +3P -75=75 +3P

Subtract 75: 75 +3P -75=3P

Then add 15: 3P +15

Therefore, |A ∪ B ∪ C|=3P +15

But we know that |A ∪ B ∪ C|=345

So, 3P +15=345

Subtract 15: 3P=330

Divide by 3: P=110

So, this is the first approach, giving me P=110

Wait, but in the second approach, I had:

Only C=60, Only P=P-120, Only Ch=2P -165

Then, adding all sections:

60 + (P -120) + (2P -165) +30 +75 +75 +15=345

Which simplifies to:

60 + P -120 +2P -165 +30 +75 +75 +15=345

Compute constants:

60 -120= -60

-60 -165= -225

-225 +30= -195

-195 +75= -120

-120 +75= -45

-45 +15= -30

Variables: P +2P=3P

So, equation becomes: 3P -30=345

Therefore, 3P=375, so P=125

Wait, so in this case, the two approaches are giving different results.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach.

Wait, in the second approach, when I calculated Only P as P -30 -75 -15, is that correct?

Wait, Only P should be equal to P minus those who take P and another subject.

But wait, in set theory, the intersection of P and C is 75, which includes those who take all three.

Similarly, the intersection of P and B (which is P) is 75, which includes those taking all three.

So, in the formula for Only P, it's P minus (P & C only) minus (P & B only) minus (all three).

But wait, in the problem statement, it's given that 75 take both Physics and Chemistry, but does that include those taking all three?

Yes, because when it says "75 take both physics and chemistry", that includes those who take all three.

Similarly, "75 take both calculus and chemistry", which includes those taking all three.

Same with "30 take both calculus and physics", which includes those taking all three.

Therefore, when I calculate Only P, it's P minus (P&C only) minus (P&Ch only) minus (all three). So, Only P = P - 30 -75 -15 = P - 120

Similarly, Only C = C - (C&P only) - (C&Ch only) - (all three)

Which is 180 -30 -75 -15=60

Only Ch = Ch - (C&Ch only) - (P&Ch only) - (all three)

Which is 2P -75 -75 -15=2P -165

So, this is correct.

So, adding all sections:

Only C (60) + Only P (P-120) + Only Ch (2P -165) + (C&P only) 30 + (C&Ch only)75 + (P&Ch only)75 + (all three)15

=60 + (P -120) + (2P -165) +30 +75 +75 +15

=60 + P -120 +2P -165 +30 +75 +75 +15

=3P -30 +345?

Wait, no, 60 -120= -60; -60 -165= -225; -225 +30= -195; -195 +75= -120; -120 +75= -45; -45 +15= -30.

So, it's 3P -30

Set equal to 345.

3P -30=345

3P=375

P=125

But in the first approach, using inclusion-exclusion, I had |A ∪ B ∪ C|=3P +15=345, so 3P=330, P=110.

So, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion formula.

Wait, in the inclusion-exclusion formula, it's |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

But in the problem statement, when it says "Twice as many students take chemistry as take physics", does that mean |C|=2|P|, which is correct.

And "twice as many students take chemistry as take physics", so yes, |C|=2|P|

So, that seems correct.

Wait, let me think about the numbers.

If P=125, then |C|=250

But the total number of students is 360, with 15 not taking any.

So, total number taking at least one subject is 345.

But if |C|=250, which is more than half of 345, that seems plausible.

But let's see what the other numbers would be.

Only C=60

Only P=125 -30 -75 -15=125-120=5

Only Ch=250 -75 -75 -15=250 -165=85

Calculus & Physics only=30

Calculus & Chem only=75

Physics & Chem only=75

All three=15

So, adding all these:

Only C:60

Only P:5

Only Ch:85

C&P:30

C&Ch:75

P&Ch:75

All three:15

Total=60+5+85+30+75+75+15= let's compute:

60+5=65

65+85=150

150+30=180

180+75=255

255+75=330

330+15=345

So, that's correct.

But in the first approach, using inclusion-exclusion, if P=110, then |C|=220

Then, Only C=60

Only P=110 -30 -75 -15=110-120=-10

Wait, that can't be, because Only P can't be negative.

So, that must mean that P=110 is incorrect.

Because Only P= P -120, which would be negative if P=110.

Thus, P must be at least 120 to have Only P non-negative.

But wait, if P=125, Only P=5, which is okay.

So, that suggests that the second approach is correct, with P=125.

But then why is the first approach giving a different answer?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.

Wait, in the first approach, when I wrote:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

So, plugging in:

|A|=180, |B|=P, |C|=2P

|A ∩ B|=30, |A ∩ C|=75, |B ∩ C|=75

|A ∩ B ∩ C|=15

So, |A ∪ B ∪ C| =180 + P +2P -30 -75 -75 +15=3P -30 +15=3P -15

Wait, wait, no, that's incorrect.

Wait, 180 +3P -30 -75 -75 +15.

Let me compute step by step:

Start with 180 +3P.

Subtract 30: 180 +3P -30=150 +3P

Subtract 75: 150 +3P -75=75 +3P

Subtract 75:75 +3P -75=3P

Add 15:3P +15

So, total |A ∪ B ∪ C|=3P +15

Set equal to 345:

3P +15=345

So, 3P=330

P=110

But wait, that would mean Only P=110 -30 -75 -15= -10

Which is impossible, as you can't have negative students.

Therefore, this suggests that P=110 is not a feasible solution because it results in a negative number of students taking only Physics.

Thus, P=110 is invalid because Only P would be negative, which is impossible.

Therefore, the correct solution is P=125, because when we plug it back into the second approach, we don't get negative numbers.

Therefore, the correct number of students taking Physics is 125.

But wait, hold on, in the second approach, I had:

Only P= P -120=125 -120=5

Which is okay, 5 students only take Physics.

So, even though P=125, which is more than half of 345, but since the overlaps are high, it's possible.

But wait, how does that make sense?

Wait, the total number of students taking Physics is 125, but the number taking both Physics and Calculus is 30, and both Physics and Chemistry is 75, and all three is 15.

So, total Physics students:30 (C&P) +75 (P&Ch)+15 (all three)=120

Wait, but only 120, but P=125, so where do the remaining 5 come from? They are only Physics.

So, Only P=5.

So, 5 students take only Physics, 30 take Physics and Calculus, 75 take Physics and Chemistry, and 15 take all three.

Wait, but 5 +30 +75 +15=125, which is P.

So, that's correct.

But let's verify the total number of students in each subject.

Calculus:180

Only Calculus:60

C&P only:30

C&Ch only:75

All three:15

So, total Calculus:60 +30 +75 +15=180, which is correct.

Chemistry:2P=250

Only Chemistry:85

C&Ch only:75

Ch&P only:75

All three:15

Total Chemistry:85 +75 +75 +15=250, correct.

Physics:125

Only Physics:5

P&C only:30

P&Ch only:75

All three:15

Total Physics:5 +30 +75 +15=125, correct.

So, all numbers add up correctly.

Therefore, the number of students taking Physics is 125.

But wait, in the first approach, I got 110, but that led to a negative number of students taking only Physics, which is impossible.

Therefore, the correct answer must be 125.

But wait, let me just double-check if I applied the inclusion-exclusion correctly.

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

So, plugging in the numbers:

180 + P +2P -30 -75 -75 +15 =180 +3P -30 -75 -75 +15=180 -30=150, 150 -75=75, 75 -75=0, 0 +15=15, so total=3P +15

Wait, no, that's incorrect.

Wait, if I compute 180 +3P -30 -75 -75 +15:

180 +3P is first.

Then, subtract 30:180 +3P -30=150 +3P

Subtract 75:150 +3P -75=75 +3P

Subtract 75:75 +3P -75=3P

Add 15:3P +15

Therefore, |A ∪ B ∪ C|=3P +15=345

Therefore, 3P=330, so P=110

But as we saw, that gives Only P=-10, which is impossible.

Therefore, that suggests that the inclusion-exclusion is being applied incorrectly.

Wait, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the error is in how I've defined P.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "twice as many students take chemistry as take physics".

So, if P is the number of students taking Physics, then C=2P.

But in my second approach, I took |C|=2P, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, the formula is correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the numbers given are not consistent?

Wait, if P=125, C=250, and Calculus is 180.

So, the overlap between C and P is 75.

So, the number of students taking both Calculus and Physics is 75, which is more than the number of students taking Calculus (180) and the number taking Physics (125).

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, how can 75 students take both Calculus and Physics when the number of Physics students is 125?

Well, 75 is less than 125, so it's possible.

Wait, but the number of students taking both Calculus and Physics is 75, which is more than the number of students taking both Physics and Chemistry (30 and 75), but okay.

Wait, no, 75 is the number of students taking both Calculus and Physics, which is okay.

Wait, 75 is less than the number of students taking Physics, which is 125.

Similarly, number of students taking both Physics and Chemistry is 75, which is okay.

So, it's acceptable.

So, maybe the numbers are okay.

But wait, when P=110, which gives C=220.

The overlap between Calculus and Physics is 30, which is okay.

But in that case, Only P=110 -30 -75 -15= -10, which is impossible.

So, P=110 is invalid.

Therefore, P=125 is the correct answer.

Wait, but in the initial approach, I think I messed up the inclusion-exclusion formula.

Wait, let me check the inclusion-exclusion formula again.

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

Yes, that is correct.

But when I applied it, I got 3P +15=345, so 3P=330, P=110

But that leads to a negative number of students.

Therefore, perhaps the problem is that the overlaps are not independent.

Wait, but no, the overlaps are given.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the given overlaps are not feasible.

Wait, for example, if the number of students taking both Physics and Calculus is 30, but the number of students taking Physics is 125, then 30 is less than 125, which is fine.

Similarly, 75 is less than 125, so that's fine.

But perhaps the issue is that the number of students taking both Physics and Chemistry is 75, which is more than the number taking only Physics.

Wait, but when P=125, Only P=5, and P&Ch=75, which is okay, since 75>5, so you can have 75 students taking both Physics and Chemistry, even if only 5 are taking only Physics.

Similarly, C=250, and Only C=85, which is okay.

So, the numbers are consistent.

Therefore, the answer is 125.

But why did the first approach give me a wrong answer?

Wait, because when I set up the equation as 345 =180 + P +2P -30 -75 -75 +15, which is 345=3P +15, so 3P=330, P=110.

But that led to an impossible number of students taking only Physics.

Therefore, the issue is that in the first approach, I incorrectly assumed that the formula is 345=180 + P +2P -30 -75 -75 +15.

But in reality, the formula is |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

So, 345=180 + P +2P -30 -75 -75 +15

=180 +3P -165 +15

=180 -150 +15 +3P

=45 +3P

Therefore, 45 +3P=345

So, 3P=300, P=100

Wait, now I'm getting P=100.

Wait, wait, now I have 3P=300, so P=100, but in the second approach I had P=125.

Wait, so which is correct?

Wait, okay, let's re-express the inclusion-exclusion formula.

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

So, plugging in numbers:

345=180 +P +2P -30 -75 -75 +15

So, compute step by step:

180 + P +2P =180 +3P

Then, subtract 30: 180 +3P -30=150 +3P

Subtract 75:150 +3P -75=75 +3P

Subtract 75:75 +3P -75=3P

Add 15:3P +15

So, 3P +15=345

Thus, 3P=330, so P=110

Wait, so that's the same as before.

Wait, but in the second approach, we get P=125.

So, which is correct?

Wait, in the second approach, we get P=125, which is consistent with all the number of students taking each subject and their overlaps, but in the first approach, we get P=110, which leads to a negative number of students taking only Physics.

Therefore, the problem is that the first approach is giving an incorrect result because when P=110, Only P= -10, which is impossible, so P=110 is invalid.

Therefore, the correct value of P must be 125, which gives Only P=5, which is acceptable.

Therefore, the number of students taking Physics is 125.

But wait, let me think again.

If P=125, then:

Only P=125 -30 -75 -15=5

Only C=60

Only Ch=250 -75 -75 -15=85

C&P=30

C&Ch=75

P&Ch=75

All three=15

Total=5+60+85+30+75+75+15=345, which is correct.

But in the first approach, why is 3P +15=345 leading to P=110?

I think the confusion is that in the inclusion-exclusion formula, the overlaps are being subtracted, but in the second approach, the counts are being handled correctly.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in the first approach, the formula is correct, but the interpretation is incorrect.

Wait, let me write down all components:

Only C=60

Only P=5

Only Ch=85

C&P=30

C&Ch=75

P&Ch=75

All three=15

Total=60+5+85+30+75+75+15=345

So, that's correct.

So, in the inclusion-exclusion formula, we get |A ∪ B ∪ C|=3P +15=345, so P=110.

But that gives negative Only P, which is impossible.

So, that suggests that the inclusion-exclusion formula may not be directly applicable here because we have overlapping overlaps? Or maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's a question of the overlaps.

Wait, in the first approach, I used the formula, but perhaps I didn't account for the fact that the overlaps include those who take all three.

Wait, no, in the inclusion-exclusion formula, overlaps are correctly subtracted.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, plugging P=125 into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

|A ∪ B ∪ C|=180 +125 +250 -30 -75 -75 +15

Compute:

180 +125=305

305 +250=555

555 -30=525

525 -75=450

450 -75=375

375 +15=390

Wait, no, that's incorrect.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the computation earlier.

Wait, if P=125, then |C|=250

So, |A ∪ B ∪ C|=180 +125 +250 -30 -75 -75 +15

Compute:

180 +125=305

305 +250=555

555 -30=525

525 -75=450

450 -75=375

375 +15=390

But we know |A ∪ B ∪ C|=345

Thus, 390≠345

So, that suggests that P=125 doesn't satisfy the inclusion-exclusion formula.

Wait, so that's a problem.

Wait, so where's the mistake?

Wait, in the second approach, when we calculated the total, we had 345, but when we compute via inclusion-exclusion with P=125, we get 390, which is more than 345.

So, that suggests that perhaps the second approach was wrong.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, the number of students taking at least one subject is 345, so |A ∪ B ∪ C|=345.

But when I use the inclusion-exclusion formula with P=125, I get 390, which is higher than 345.

Therefore, that suggests that P=125 is invalid.

So, why does the second approach give me 345 when P=125, but the inclusion-exclusion formula gives me 390?

Because in the second approach, I'm overcounting.

Wait, no, in the second approach, I correctly accounted for all overlaps, which should give the correct total.

But if P=125, the inclusion-exclusion formula suggests that |A ∪ B ∪ C|=390, but according to the problem, it's 345.

Therefore, that suggests that P=125 is invalid.

So, my earlier second approach was incorrect because I didn't correctly account for all overlaps.

Wait, so let's go back.

If P=110, then |C|=220

Then, Only C=60

Only P=110 -30 -75 -15= -10

Which is invalid.

So, perhaps I need to solve the inclusion-exclusion equation.

Wait, so starting again.

Given:

|A|=180, |B|=P, |C|=2P

|A ∩ B|=30, |A ∩ C|=75, |B ∩ C|=75

|A ∩ B ∩ C|=15

Total students taking at least one subject:345

So, using inclusion-exclusion:

345=180 +P +2P -30 -75 -75 +15

Simplify:

345=180 +3P -165 +15

So, 345= (180 -165 +15) +3P

Compute:

180 -165=15; 15 +15=30

So, 345=30 +3P

Therefore, 3P=315

So, P=105

Wait, 3P=315, so P=105

So, that's different from both previous results.

Wait, so let me do that again.

Compute 345=180 +3P -30 -75 -75 +15

Which is 345=180 +3P -165 +15

So, 345= (180 -165 +15) +3P

180 -165 is 15, 15 +15 is 30.

So, 345=30 +3P

Therefore, 3P=345 -30=315

So, P=105

Wait, so P=105

So, why did I get 110 before?

Wait, perhaps I had miscalculated.

Wait, wait, in my first approach, I had written:

345=3P +15, so 3P=330, P=110

But in reality, the equation is:

345=180 +3P -30 -75 -75 +15

Which is 345=180 +3P -165 +15

Which is 345=30 +3P

So, 3P=315, so P=105

Therefore, I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, in my initial equation, I must have messed up the signs.

So, correct equation is 345=180 +3P -30 -75 -75 +15

Which simplifies to 345=3P +15

Wait, no, 180 +3P -30 -75 -75 +15=180 -30 -75 -75 +15 +3P=180 -120 +15 +3P=75 +3P

Wait, so 75 +3P=345

So, 3P=270, so P=90

Wait, wait, now I'm confused.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

Compute 180 +3P -30 -75 -75 +15

First, 180 +3P: that's 180 +3P

Subtract 30: 180 +3P -30=150 +3P

Subtract 75:150 +3P -75=75 +3P

Subtract 75:75 +3P -75=3P

Add 15:3P +15

So, 3P +15=345

Thus, 3P=345 -15=330

330=3P

So, P=110

Wait, but in the second approach, when I had P=105, but that didn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I confused the numbers.

Wait, I think I need to write down the equation correctly.

Wait, the inclusion-exclusion formula is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C|=|A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

So, plugging the numbers:

345=180 +P +2P -30 -75 -75 +15

So, 345=180 +3P -30 -75 -75 +15

Simplify the constants:

180 -30=150

150 -75=75

75 -75=0

0 +15=15

So, 345=15 +3P

Therefore, 3P=345 -15=330

So, P=110

Therefore, P=110

Wait, but when I proceed with P=110, Only P=110 -30 -75 -15= -10, which is impossible.

Hence, P=110 is invalid.

So, this suggests that the problem is inconsistent?

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, but the problem is given, so there must be a solution.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is that in the inclusion-exclusion formula, I have to subtract |A ∩ B|, |A ∩ C|, |B ∩ C|, which includes the students taking all three.

But in the second approach, when I calculate Only P, I subtract those taking P and C, P and B, and all three, which is correct.

So, perhaps the issue is that the problem is flawed, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the problem.

Wait, let me rephrase.

Total students:360

Students not taking any:15

Therefore, students taking at least one subject:345

Given:

Calculus students:180

Physics students:P

Chemistry students:2P

Only Calculus:180 - (those taking Calculus and another subject) + (all three)

Wait, maybe that's another way to think.

Wait, the number of students taking only Calculus is Total Calculus minus those taking Calculus and another subject, plus those taking all three?

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, in a three-set Venn diagram, the number of students taking only Calculus is |A| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the formula for only A is |A| - (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ B ∩ C|)

Wait, no, the formula is |A| - (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| - 2|A ∩ B ∩ C|)

Wait, no, let me think.

In set theory, the number of elements only in A is |A| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

Because |A ∩ B| includes those in both A and B, and |A ∩ C| includes those in both A and C, but those in all three are subtracted twice, so we need to add them back once.

So, Only A= |A| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

Similarly, Only B= |B| - |A ∩ B| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

Only C= |C| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

Therefore, Only A=180 -30 -75 +15=180 -105=75

Only B= P -30 -75 +15=P -90

Only C=2P -75 -75 +15=2P -135

Then, Only A=75

Only B=P -90

Only C=2P -135

And the overlaps:

A&C only=75

C&B only=75

A&B only=30

All three=15

So, total students:

Only A + Only B + Only C + A&B only + C&B only + A&C only + All three=75 + (P -90) + (2P -135) +30 +75 +75 +15=345

So, compute:

75 + P -90 +2P -135 +30 +75 +75 +15

Combine like terms:

75 -90 -135 +30 +75 +75 +15 +P +2P

Compute constants:

75 -90= -15

-15 -135= -150

-150 +30= -120

-120 +75= -45

-45 +75=30

30 +15=45

Variables: P +2P=3P

So, total=45 +3P=345

Thus, 3P=345 -45=300

So, P=100

So, according to this, P=100

Wait, okay, so according to this, P=100

So, Only B=100 -90=10

Only C=200 -135=65

So, let me check the total:

Only A=75

Only B=10

Only C=65

A&B only=30

C&B only=75

A&C only=75

All three=15

Total=75+10+65+30+75+75+15=345

Yes, that works.

So, that's correct.

So, P=100.

So, this contradicts the earlier results.

Wait, so where is the problem?

In the first inclusion-exclusion approach, I had mistakenly thought that Only P= P -120, but in reality, Only P= P - |P&C only| - |P&B only| - |All three|

Which is P -75 -75 -15= P -165

But in my second approach, according to the correct formula, Only P= P - |P&C| - |P&B| + |All three|= P -75 -75 +15= P -135

Wait, so in the second approach, Only P= P -135

But in my first approach, I mistakenly thought Only P= P -120

So, that was my mistake.

Therefore, in the first approach, my error was in computing Only P as P -120, but it's actually P -135.

So, that's why when I plugged into the inclusion-exclusion formula, I was getting P=110, which led to a negative Only P, which was invalid, but in the second approach, correctly computing Only P as P -135, I get P=100, which is consistent.

So, therefore, the correct answer is P=100.

Wait, but in the first approach, using the inclusion-exclusion, I should have:

345=180 +P +2P -30 -75 -75 +15

Which is 345=180 +3P -165 +15

Simplify:

180 -165=15; 15 +15=30

So, 345=30 +3P

Thus, 3P=315

So, P=105

Wait, now I'm confused, because in the second approach, setting up the equation, I had 3P +15=345, so P=110, but in the second approach, computing Only P as P -135, I got P=100.

But in reality, the correct equation is 45 +3P=345, so 3P=300, P=100.

Wait, so maybe I messed up the first approach.

Wait, in the first approach, I think I miscalculated.

Wait, let me write down the equation again.

Only A= |A| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|=180 -30 -75 +15=75

Only B= P -30 -75 +15= P -90

Only C=2P -75 -75 +15=2P -135

A&B only=30

C&B only=75

A&C only=75

All three=15

Total=75 + (P -90) + (2P -135) +30 +75 +75 +15=345

Compute:

75 +P -90 +2P -135 +30 +75 +75 +15

Simplify constants:

75 -90= -15

-15 -135= -150

-150 +30= -120

-120 +75= -45

-45 +75=30

30 +15=45

Variables: P +2P=3P

So, total=45 +3P=345

Thus, 3P=300, P=100

Therefore, Only B=100 -90=10

Only C=200 -135=65

Therefore, P=100 is correct.

Therefore, the correct number of students taking Physics is 100.

But why in the first approach, when I applied the inclusion-exclusion formula, I got P=110, which was invalid?

Because in that approach, I incorrectly computed Only P as P -120, when it's actually P -135.

So, that was the mistake.

Therefore, the correct number is 100.

Therefore, the number of students taking Physics is \boxed{100}

**Final Answer**
The number of students taking Physics is \boxed{100}.
</think>

Given the problem, we need to determine the number of students taking Physics (P). Here are the key steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 360
2. **Number of students not taking any subject**: 15
3. **Number of students taking at least one subject**: 360 - 15 = 345
4. **Number of students taking Calculus (C)**: 180
5. **Number of students taking Physics (P)**: P
6. **Number of students taking Chemistry (Ch)**: 2P
7. **Number of students taking both Calculus and Physics**: 75
8. **Number of students taking both Physics and Chemistry**: 75
9. **Number of students taking both Calculus and Chemistry**: 75
10. **Number of students taking all three subjects**: 15

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets, we have:

\[
|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
345 = 180 + 3P - 165 + 15
\]

\[
345 = 30 + 3P
\]

Solving for P:

\[
3P = 345 - 30
\]
\[
3P = 315
\]
\[
P = 105
\]

However, this result was found to be invalid when considering the number of students taking only Physics. Re-evaluating the problem using the correct approach, we find:

1. **Only Calculus**: 75
2. **Only Physics**: \( P - 90 \)
3. **Only Chemistry**: \( 2P - 135 \)
4. **Both Calculus and Physics only**: 30
5. **Both Physics and Chemistry only**: 75
6. **Both Calculus and Chemistry only**: 75
7. **All three subjects**: 15

Summing these:

\[
75 + (P - 90) + (2P - 135) + 30 + 75 + 75 + 15 = 345
\]

Simplifying:

\[
45 + 3P = 345
\]
\[
3P = 300
\]
\[
P = 100
\]

Thus, the number of students taking Physics is \(\boxed{100}\).
