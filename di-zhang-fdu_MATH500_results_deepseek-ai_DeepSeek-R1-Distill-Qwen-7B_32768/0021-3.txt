Find all the integer roots of
\[x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0.\]Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
By the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots are all the divisors of 14 (including negative divisors), which are $-14,$ $-7,$ $-2,$ $-1,$ $1,$ $2,$ $7,$ and $14.$  Checking, we find that the only integer roots are $\boxed{-2,1}.$

Gold:
-2,1

Wrong Prediction:
-2

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this equation: \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, integer roots... I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Maybe I should start by recalling that.

The Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) is a factor of the constant term and \(q\) is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. So, that means all possible rational roots are just the factors of -14. Since we're looking for integer roots, \(q\) must be 1, so the possible integer roots are \(\pm1, \pm2, \pm7, \pm14\). Got that.

So, my job is to test each of these possible roots by plugging them into the equation and seeing if they make it zero. Let me write them down: 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14.

Starting with 1: let me plug that in.

\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 -14\). Calculating that: 1+5 is 6, 6+9 is 15, 15-1 is 14, 14-14 is 0. Oh, so 1 is a root! Nice, that worked.

Now, let's try -1. Plugging in -1.

\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) -14\). Calculating each term: 1 + (-5) + 9 +1 -14. So, 1 -5 is -4, -4 +9 is 5, 5 +1 is 6, 6 -14 is -8. Not zero, so -1 isn't a root.

Next, 2. Plugging in 2.

\(2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 -2 -14\). Let's calculate each term: 16 + 40 + 36 -2 -14. Adding those up: 16+40 is 56, 56+36 is 92, 92-2 is 90, 90-14 is 76. Not zero. So 2 is not a root.

How about -2? Let me try -2.

\((-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 - (-2) -14\). Calculating each term: 16 + (-40) + 36 +2 -14. Let's add them: 16-40 is -24, -24+36 is 12, 12+2 is 14, 14-14 is 0. Perfect, -2 is a root.

Alright, so far I've found two integer roots: 1 and -2. Let me note that down.

Now, let's try 7. Plugging in 7.

\(7^4 + 5(7)^3 + 9(7)^2 -7 -14\). Calculating each term: 2401 + 5*343 + 9*49 -7 -14.

Compute step by step:

2401 is 7^4.

5*343 is 1715.

9*49 is 441.

So adding those up: 2401 + 1715 is 4116, 4116 + 441 is 4557.

Then subtract 7 and 14: 4557 -7 is 4550, 4550 -14 is 4536. Definitely not zero. So 7 is not a root.

How about -7? Let's try.

\((-7)^4 + 5(-7)^3 + 9(-7)^2 - (-7) -14\).

Compute each term: 2401 + (-5*343) + 9*49 +7 -14.

Calculating:

2401 - 1715 is 686, 686 + 441 is 1127, 1127 +7 is 1134, 1134 -14 is 1120. Not zero. So -7 isn't a root.

Next, 14. Let's try 14.

14^4 is 14*14*14*14. 14^2 is 196, so 14^4 is 196*196. Let me compute that: 200*196 is 39200, minus 4*196 which is 784, so 39200 -784 is 38416. Wow, that's big.

Then, 5*(14)^3: 14^3 is 2744, so 5*2744 is 13720.

9*(14)^2: 14^2 is 196, so 9*196 is 1764.

Then, subtract 14 and 14.

So, putting it all together: 38416 + 13720 + 1764 -14 -14.

Let's add the big numbers first: 38416 +13720 is 52136, plus 1764 is 53900.

Subtract 14 and 14: 53900 -14 is 53886, minus another 14 is 53872. Definitely not zero. So 14 isn't a root.

How about -14? Let me try.

\((-14)^4 + 5(-14)^3 + 9(-14)^2 - (-14) -14\).

Calculating each term: 14^4 is 38416, 5*(-14)^3 is 5*(-2744) which is -13720, 9*(-14)^2 is 9*196 which is 1764, then -(-14) is +14, then -14.

So, let's add them up: 38416 -13720 +1764 +14 -14.

Compute step by step: 38416 -13720 is 24696, 24696 +1764 is 26460, 26460 +14 is 26474, 26474 -14 is 26460. Not zero. So -14 isn't a root.

So, the only integer roots I found are 1 and -2. Hmm, wait, but is that all? The polynomial is degree 4, so we should have four roots in total, maybe with multiplicities or complex roots.

But since we're only asked for integer roots, 1 and -2 are the ones. But wait, just to make sure, maybe I missed something. Let me check if I did the calculations correctly.

First, testing x=1: 1 +5 +9 -1 -14. 1+5=6, 6+9=15, 15-1=14, 14-14=0. Correct, so 1 is a root.

Testing x=-2: 16 + (-40) + 36 + 2 -14. 16-40=-24, -24+36=12, 12+2=14, 14-14=0. Correct, so -2 is a root.

So, that's two integer roots. Now, perhaps we can factor the polynomial knowing these roots.

If 1 and -2 are roots, then (x -1) and (x +2) are factors. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor these out.

Let me try to factor them out step by step.

First, let's factor out (x -1). Using synthetic division.

Set up the coefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), 0 (x), -14 (constant). Wait, hold on, the original equation is \(x^4 +5x^3 +9x^2 -x -14\). So coefficients are 1, 5, 9, -1, -14.

So, for synthetic division with root 1:

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1 by 1, get 1, add to next coefficient: 5 +1=6.

Multiply 6 by 1=6, add to next coefficient: 9 +6=15.

Multiply 15 by1=15, add to next coefficient: -1 +15=14.

Multiply 14 by1=14, add to last coefficient: -14 +14=0. Perfect, no remainder.

So, after division by (x -1), the polynomial becomes \(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\).

Now, we can take this cubic polynomial and factor out (x +2), since we already know -2 is a root.

Set up synthetic division with root -2 on the cubic polynomial.

Coefficients: 1, 6, 15, 14.

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1 by (-2) = -2, add to next coefficient: 6 + (-2)=4.

Multiply 4 by (-2) = -8, add to next coefficient: 15 + (-8)=7.

Multiply 7 by (-2)= -14, add to last coefficient: 14 + (-14)=0. So, no remainder.

Therefore, after division by (x +2), the cubic polynomial becomes \(x^2 +4x +7\).

So, now our original polynomial factors as (x -1)(x +2)(x^2 +4x +7). Now, we can attempt to factor the quadratic or find its roots.

The discriminant of \(x^2 +4x +7\) is \(16 - 28 = -12\), which is negative, so it has no real roots, only complex ones. Therefore, the only integer roots are 1 and -2.

Wait a second, but let me double-check if I did the synthetic divisions correctly.

First, dividing \(x^4 +5x^3 +9x^2 -x -14\) by (x -1):

Using synthetic division, with root 1:

1 | 1 5 9 -1 -14

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1 by 1: 1, add to 5: 6.

Multiply 6 by1:6, add to 9:15.

Multiply15 by1:15, add to -1:14.

Multiply14 by1:14, add to -14:0. So, correct.

Then, dividing \(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\) by (x +2):

-2 | 1 6 15 14

Bring down 1.

Multiply1 by -2: -2, add to 6:4.

Multiply4 by -2: -8, add to15:7.

Multiply7 by -2: -14, add to14:0. Correct.

So, quadratic is correct: \(x^2 +4x +7\), which doesn't factor further over integers or reals.

Therefore, indeed, the only integer roots are 1 and -2.

But just to make sure, let me think: is there another possible integer root I might have missed? Maybe I should cross-verify.

Wait, when I tested x=-2, it worked, but maybe I should test x=-1 again? Wait, I did, and it didn't work.

Wait, let me try x=7 again, maybe I miscalculated.

7^4 is 2401, 5*7^3 is 5*343=1715, 9*7^2=9*49=441, -7, -14.

So, 2401 +1715=4116, 4116 +441=4557, 4557 -7=4550, 4550 -14=4536. Definitely not zero.

How about x=-7? (-7)^4=2401, 5*(-7)^3=5*(-343)=-1715, 9*(-7)^2=9*49=441, -(-7)=7, -14.

So, 2401 -1715=686, 686 +441=1127, 1127 +7=1134, 1134 -14=1120. Not zero.

Wait, x=0? Let me try, though 0 isn't in the list of possible roots, but just in case.

Plugging in 0: 0 +0 +0 -0 -14= -14≠0. So, no.

Wait, but 0 isn't a possible root because the constant term is -14, which is divisible by q=1 but not necessarily 0. So, anyway, 0 isn't a root.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when you have synthetic division with roots, you have to make sure that the polynomial is correctly divided. Did I correctly factor out (x -1) and (x +2)?

Let me multiply (x -1)(x +2)(quadratic) and see if I get the original polynomial.

First, multiply (x -1)(x +2): that's x^2 +2x -x -2 =x^2 +x -2.

Multiply that by \(x^2 +4x +7\):

Multiply each term:

First, x^2*(x^2 +4x +7)=x^4 +4x^3 +7x^2.

Then, x*(x^2 +4x +7)=x^3 +4x^2 +7x.

Then, -2*(x^2 +4x +7)= -2x^2 -8x -14.

Now, add all these together:

x^4 +4x^3 +7x^2 +x^3 +4x^2 +7x -2x^2 -8x -14.

Combine like terms:

x^4 + (4x^3 +x^3) =x^4 +5x^3.

(7x^2 +4x^2 -2x^2)= (7+4-2)x^2=9x^2.

(7x -8x)= -x.

Constant term: -14.

So, the product is x^4 +5x^3 +9x^2 -x -14, which is exactly our original polynomial. So, correct.

Therefore, I didn't make a mistake in the factoring. So, indeed, the only integer roots are 1 and -2.

Wait, but just to ensure, maybe I can factor the quadratic further or see if it can be factored into integers.

Looking at \(x^2 +4x +7\). If I try to factor it, we need two numbers that multiply to 7 and add to 4. But 7 is prime, so 1 and7. 1+7=8≠4. So, it can't be factored over integers. Therefore, only integer roots are 1 and -2.

So, after all that, my conclusion is that the integer roots are x=1 and x=-2.

**Final Answer**
The integer roots are \boxed{1} and \boxed{-2}.
</think>

To find all the integer roots of the equation \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\), we use the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (-14) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1), giving us the possible integer roots: \(\pm1, \pm2, \pm7, \pm14\).

Testing each possible root:

- \(x = 1\): 
  \[
  1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0
  \]
  So, \(x = 1\) is a root.

- \(x = -2\):
  \[
  (-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 - (-2) - 14 = 16 - 40 + 36 + 2 - 14 = 0
  \]
  So, \(x = -2\) is a root.

The polynomial can be factored using synthetic division with roots 1 and -2. Dividing by \(x - 1\) gives the cubic polynomial \(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\). Dividing this by \(x + 2\) gives the quadratic polynomial \(x^2 + 4x + 7\).

The quadratic \(x^2 + 4x + 7\) has a discriminant of \(16 - 28 = -12\), which is negative, indicating no real roots. Therefore, the only integer roots are 1 and -2.

The integer roots are \(\boxed{1}\) and \(\boxed{-2}\).
