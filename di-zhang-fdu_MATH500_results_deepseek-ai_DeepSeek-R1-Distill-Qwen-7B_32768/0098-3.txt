Question:
If $\omega^{1997} = 1$ and $\omega \neq 1,$ then evaluate
\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}}.\]

Correct Answer:
Note that
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997 - k}} &= \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{\omega^k}{\omega^k + \omega^{1997}} \\
&= \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{\omega^k}{\omega^k + 1} \\
&= \frac{1 + \omega^k}{1 + \omega^k} = 1.
\end{align*}Thus, we can pair the terms
\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega}, \ \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}, \ \dots, \ \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1995}}, \ \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1996}}\]into $1996/2 = 998$ pairs, so that the sum of the numbers in each pair is 1.  Also, $\frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}} = \frac{1}{2},$ so the sum works out to $998 + \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1997}{2}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, let's see. I've got this problem where ω^1997 equals 1, and ω isn't equal to 1. I need to evaluate the sum from k=1 to 1997 of 1/(1 + ω^k). Hmm, okay, so ω is a 1997th root of unity, right? Since ω^1997 = 1, and it's not equal to 1, so it must be a primitive root or something.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to sums and products. Maybe I can use that here. Let me recall that the sum of all n-th roots of unity is zero. So, for the 1997th roots of unity, the sum from k=0 to 1996 of ω^k is zero. That might come in handy.

But in this problem, the sum is from k=1 to 1997 of 1/(1 + ω^k). Hmm, that's a bit different. I wonder if there's a way to relate this to the roots of unity or some identity.

Let me think about the denominator first: 1 + ω^k. Maybe I can manipulate this somehow. I remember that 1 + x can sometimes be expressed as a product or something. Wait, if ω is a root of x^1997 - 1 = 0, then maybe I can factor something out.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that (x^n - 1) factors into (x - 1)(x - ω)(x - ω^2)...(x - ω^{n-1}), where ω is a primitive root. So, maybe that can help me somehow.

But the expression here is 1/(1 + ω^k). Hmm, maybe I can write 1/(1 + ω^k) as something else. Let me try to express ω^k as another variable, say ζ = ω^k. Then, the term becomes 1/(1 + ζ). Maybe I can find a relationship for 1/(1 + ζ) when ζ is a root of unity.

Wait, since ω is a primitive 1997th root of unity, all the ω^k for k=1 to 1997 are distinct roots, except for ω^0=1, which is excluded here.

I also remember that for roots of unity, certain sums can be simplified due to their symmetric properties. Maybe I can pair terms or use conjugates.

Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have n = 3, and ω^3 = 1, ω ≠ 1. Then, ω is a primitive 3rd root. Let's compute the sum S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω^2). Maybe computing this for a small n can give me insight.

Compute S: 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω^2). Let's compute each term separately.

First, 1/(1 + ω). Since ω^2 + ω + 1 = 0 (from x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)), so 1 + ω = -ω^2, so 1/(1 + ω) = -1/ω^2.

Similarly, 1/(1 + ω^2) = -1/ω.

So, S = -1/ω^2 - 1/ω. But ω^2 = ω^{-1} since ω^3 = 1, so S = -ω - ω^2. But from ω^2 + ω + 1 = 0, we have ω + ω^2 = -1. So, S = -(-1) = 1. Wait, that's interesting. So, in the case of n=3, the sum is 1.

Hmm, maybe that's a pattern. Let me try n=2. But n=2, ω^2 =1, ω ≠1, so ω is -1. Then, the sum is 1/(1 + (-1)) which is undefined, so maybe n=2 is too small.

How about n=4? Let's see. ω^4 =1, ω ≠1, so ω is i or -1 or -i.

Wait, but if n=4, the sum is 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω^2) + 1/(1 + ω^3). Let's compute that.

First, 1/(1 + ω): ω is i, so 1/(1 + i) = (1 - i)/2.

1/(1 + ω^2): ω^2 = -1, so 1/(1 + (-1)) is undefined. Wait, same problem. So maybe n=4 is also problematic because one term becomes undefined.

Wait, perhaps n needs to be odd? Because when n is odd, all the roots ω^k for k=1 to n are distinct and none of them are -1, since (-1)^n is -1 only if n is odd. Wait, actually, for n even, ω^{n/2} = -1, but for n odd, ω^{(n-1)/2} is something else, but not necessarily -1.

Wait, actually, if n is odd, then ω^{n} =1, but ω^{(n-1)/2} is not necessarily -1. For example, with n=3, ω^2 is not -1 because ω^2 is a primitive root as well.

Wait, actually, in n=3, ω^2 is the other primitive root, and in that case, 1 + ω^2 is not zero. So maybe my earlier approach for n=3 is okay, but for even n, one of the terms could be undefined because 1 + ω^{n/2} = 0.

But in our problem, n=1997 is odd, so ω^{1997} =1, but none of the ω^k for k=1 to 1997 will be -1, because -1 is not a 1997th root of unity (since 1997 is odd, (-1)^{1997} = -1 ≠1). So, that term is safe.

So, maybe I can use the n=3 case as a hint. In the n=3 case, the sum was 1. Maybe for n=1997, the sum is something similar. Let me see if I can generalize.

Let me denote S = Σ_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + ω^k). I need to find S.

I know that for roots of unity, sometimes we can pair terms or find a telescoping sum, or use some identity.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can consider multiplying numerator and denominator by something to make it easier.

For each term 1/(1 + ω^k), if I multiply numerator and denominator by ω^{-k/2}, I get ω^{-k/2}/(ω^{-k/2} + ω^{k/2}) = ω^{-k/2}/(2 cos(kπ/1997)). Hmm, that might complicate things more.

Alternatively, maybe consider writing 1/(1 + ω^k) as (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}). Wait, that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the identity:

1/(1 + x) = (1 - x)/(1 - x^2). Hmm, so 1/(1 + ω^k) = (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

But I don't know if that helps. Let me try.

So, S = Σ_{k=1}^{1997} (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

Hmm, but 1 - ω^{2k} is the denominator, which is (1 - ω^k)(1 + ω^k). So, that would make 1/(1 + ω^k) = (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

But not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I can write 1/(1 + ω^k) as (1 - ω^k)/ (1 - ω^{2k}) = (1 - ω^k)/ ( (1 - ω^k)(1 + ω^k) )) = 1/(1 + ω^k). Hmm, that's just going in circles.

Alternatively, maybe we can write 1/(1 + ω^k) as (1/2)(1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^k - ω^{2k} + ω^{3k})... Hmm, maybe that's too convoluted.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since ω is a root of x^{1997} -1 =0, we can write x^{1997} -1 = (x -1)(x - ω)(x - ω^2)...(x - ω^{1996}).

So, maybe partial fractions or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, consider that S = Σ_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + ω^k). We can write this as Σ_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + ω^k).

Let me consider that 1 + ω^k is a complex number, but maybe I can relate it to the roots of some equation.

Wait, another thought: Let me consider the sum S = Σ_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + ω^k). Let me consider multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 - ω^k):

So, 1/(1 + ω^k) = (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

So, S = Σ_{k=1}^{1997} (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

But 1 - ω^{2k} is (1 - ω^k)(1 + ω^k), so S = Σ_{k=1}^{1997} (1 - ω^k)/( (1 - ω^k)(1 + ω^k) ) = Σ_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + ω^k). Hmm, again, same expression.

Wait, maybe that approach isn't helpful.

Let me try another angle. Let me consider the function f(x) = Σ_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + x^k).

Then, maybe I can relate this to some generating function or something.

But I don't know. Maybe I can find f(x) as a function, but I need to evaluate it at x = ω.

Wait, another idea: Let's consider the sum S = Σ_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + ω^k). Let me note that 1/(1 + ω^k) can be rewritten as (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

But then S = Σ_{k=1}^{1997} (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe consider that (1 + ω^k)(1 + ω^{-k}) = 2 + ω^k + ω^{-k}.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps consider that 1/(1 + ω^k) = (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

But 1 - ω^{2k} is (1 - ω^k)(1 + ω^k). So, that gives us back the same term.

Alternatively, maybe writing 1/(1 + ω^k) as (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}) = (1 - ω^k)/( (1 - ω^k)(1 + ω^k) ) = 1/(1 + ω^k). Hmm, same thing.

Wait, maybe I can pair terms. Since ω^{1997} =1, so ω^{k + 1997} = ω^k. So, exponents are modulo 1997.

Wait, but in the sum, k goes from 1 to 1997, so each ω^k is unique. So, each term is unique.

Wait, but maybe pairing k and 1997 - k.

Wait, let's see, for each k, 1/(1 + ω^k) and 1/(1 + ω^{1997 - k}).

So, let's compute 1/(1 + ω^k) + 1/(1 + ω^{1997 - k}).

Compute that:

1/(1 + ω^k) + 1/(1 + ω^{-k}) because ω^{1997 - k} = ω^{-k} since ω^{1997}=1.

So, 1/(1 + ω^k) + 1/(1 + ω^{-k}) = [1/(1 + ω^k)] + [ω^k/(1 + ω^k)] = (1 + ω^k)/(1 + ω^k) = 1.

Wait, that's nice! So, for each k from 1 to 998, pairing k and 1997 - k, each pair sums to 1. Then, the middle term when k=999? Wait, 1997 is odd, so the middle term is when k= (1997 +1)/2 = 999. So, k=999: ω^{999}.

Wait, but let's check if 1997 is odd. 1997 divided by 2 is 998.5, so middle term is at k=999.

So, for k=1 and k=1996, they pair up and sum to 1. Similarly, k=2 and k=1995, etc., up to k=998 and k=999.

Wait, hold on. Wait, k=999 is the middle term, so when you pair k=999 with k=1997 -999=998. Wait, 1997 -999=998? Wait, 1997-999=998? 1997-999=998? No, 1997-999=998? Wait, 999 +998=1997, yes.

Wait, so k=999 is paired with k=998. Hmm, so perhaps I need to adjust.

Wait, actually, for k=1, pair with k=1996; for k=2, pair with k=1995; etc., up to k=998 paired with k=999.

Wait, so k=999 is the last term in the upper half, paired with k=998 in the lower half.

But wait, hold on, 1997 is odd, so there's an odd number of terms. So, 1997 terms, so when you pair them, you can pair k=1 with k=1996, k=2 with k=1995, ..., k=998 with k=999, and then the middle term is k=999.5? Wait, no, k has to be integer.

Wait, 1997 is odd, so the number of pairs is (1997 -1)/2=998, and then the middle term is when k=999. Because 1997=2*998 +1.

Therefore, actually, when k=999, ω^{999} is the middle root.

Wait, so when I pair k=1 with k=1996, k=2 with k=1995, etc., each pair sums to 1, and then we have the middle term k=999, which is 1/(1 + ω^{999}).

So, the total sum S would be 998 pairs each summing to 1, plus the middle term.

Thus, S = 998*1 + [1/(1 + ω^{999})].

So, S = 998 + [1/(1 + ω^{999})].

Hmm, so now I need to compute 1/(1 + ω^{999}).

But perhaps ω^{999} has some special property.

Wait, note that ω^{1997}=1, so ω^{999} = ω^{1997 - 998} = ω^{-998}.

Therefore, 1 + ω^{999} = 1 + ω^{-998} = 1 + conjugate(ω^{998}).

But I don't know if that helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can note that since ω^{1997}=1, so ω^{999} = ω^{(1997 +1)/2} = ω^{(1997)/2 + 1/2} = ω^{998.5}.

Wait, 1997 is 2*998 +1, so 1997/2=998.5. So, ω^{999}=ω^{998.5 +0.5}=ω^{998.5} * ω^{0.5}.

But ω^{0.5} is sqrt(ω). Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Wait, another thought: Let's compute 1/(1 + ω^{999}) + 1/(1 + ω^{999 *2}) + ... Maybe not.

Wait, let me try to compute 1/(1 + ω^{999}).

Note that ω^{999} is a root of x^{1997} -1=0, so (x^{1997} -1)=0.

But ω^{999} is a primitive 1997th root of unity as well, since 999 and 1997 are coprime? Wait, 1997 is prime, right? Yes, 1997 is a prime number.

Yes, because 1997 divided by, say, 3 is 665.666..., not integer. 1997 divided by 7 is 285.285..., not integer. Similarly, 11: 181.545..., etc. So, 1997 is prime.

Therefore, 999 is less than 1997 and since 1997 is prime, gcd(999,1997)=1. Therefore, ω^{999} is also a primitive 1997th root of unity.

So, similar to ω, ω^{999} is a primitive root. So, perhaps similar properties apply.

Wait, but I still don't see how to compute 1/(1 + ω^{999}).

Wait, maybe considering that 1 + ω^{999} is equal to 2 cos(theta) for some theta, but complex numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can note that 1/(1 + ω^{999}) + 1/(1 + ω^{-999}) = 1, as we saw earlier.

Wait, 1/(1 + ω^{999}) + 1/(1 + ω^{-999}) = [1/(1 + ω^{999})] + [ω^{999}/(1 + ω^{999})] = (1 + ω^{999})/(1 + ω^{999}) = 1.

But in our sum S, we only have the single term 1/(1 + ω^{999}), not both 1/(1 + ω^{999}) and 1/(1 + ω^{-999}).

So, maybe 1/(1 + ω^{999}) = something.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω^{1998}).

But 1998 is 1997 +1, so ω^{1998}=ω.

Therefore, 1/(1 + ω^{999}) = (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω).

Hmm, so S = 998 + (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω).

Hmm, that might be helpful.

So, S = 998 + (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω).

Let me compute (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω). That's a geometric series.

Wait, (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω) = 1 + ω + ω^2 + ... + ω^{998}.

Similarly, (1 - ω^{1997})/(1 - ω) = 1 + ω + ... + ω^{1996} = 0, since the sum of all 1997th roots is zero.

But we have (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω) = sum_{n=0}^{998} ω^n.

So, let's write that as T = sum_{n=0}^{998} ω^n.

Therefore, S = 998 + T.

But T is a partial sum of the geometric series.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute T.

Wait, T = sum_{n=0}^{998} ω^n = (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω).

But I have to compute T, which is a complex number. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I can relate T to another sum.

Wait, let me note that the sum from n=0 to 1996 of ω^n =0.

Therefore, T + sum_{n=999}^{1996} ω^n = 0.

So, T = - sum_{n=999}^{1996} ω^n.

But sum_{n=999}^{1996} ω^n is equal to sum_{n=0}^{997} ω^{n +999} = ω^{999} sum_{n=0}^{997} ω^n.

So, T = - ω^{999} * sum_{n=0}^{997} ω^n.

But sum_{n=0}^{997} ω^n = (1 - ω^{998})/(1 - ω).

Therefore, T = - ω^{999} * (1 - ω^{998})/(1 - ω).

So, T = - ω^{999} + ω^{1997}/(1 - ω).

But ω^{1997}=1, so T = - ω^{999} + 1/(1 - ω).

Therefore, T = (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω) = same as before. Hmm, circular.

Wait, but maybe let's compute T + ω^{999} = [sum_{n=0}^{998} ω^n] + ω^{999} = sum_{n=0}^{999} ω^n = (1 - ω^{1000})/(1 - ω).

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: Let me note that T = sum_{n=0}^{998} ω^n.

But the original sum is T + sum_{n=999}^{1996} ω^n =0.

But sum_{n=999}^{1996} ω^n = sum_{n=0}^{997} ω^{n +999} = ω^{999} sum_{n=0}^{997} ω^n.

Let me denote U = sum_{n=0}^{997} ω^n.

So, T = sum_{n=0}^{998} ω^n = sum_{n=0}^{997} ω^n + ω^{998} = U + ω^{998}.

Then, sum_{n=999}^{1996} ω^n = ω^{999} U.

So, T + ω^{999} U =0.

But T = U + ω^{998}, so substituting:

(U + ω^{998}) + ω^{999} U =0.

Factor out U:

U (1 + ω^{999}) + ω^{998}=0.

So, U (1 + ω^{999}) = - ω^{998}.

Thus, U = - ω^{998}/(1 + ω^{999}).

Therefore, T = U + ω^{998} = (- ω^{998}/(1 + ω^{999})) + ω^{998} = ω^{998}(1 - 1/(1 + ω^{999})) = ω^{998} * ( (1 + ω^{999} -1 )/(1 + ω^{999}) ) = ω^{998} * (ω^{999}/(1 + ω^{999})) )= ω^{998 +999}/(1 + ω^{999}) = ω^{1997}/(1 + ω^{999}).

But ω^{1997}=1, so T =1/(1 + ω^{999}).

Therefore, T =1/(1 + ω^{999}).

But earlier, we had S = 998 + T, so S =998 + T =998 + 1/(1 + ω^{999}).

Wait, but that brings us back to the same point.

Wait, so T =1/(1 + ω^{999}), which is the term we were stuck on earlier.

So, S =998 + T =998 +1/(1 + ω^{999}).

But we still need to find T or 1/(1 + ω^{999}).

Wait, but we can note that S =998 + T, and T =1/(1 + ω^{999}), so S =998 +1/(1 + ω^{999}).

But then, perhaps we can write S = (998*(1 + ω^{999}) +1)/(1 + ω^{999}).

But I don't know if that helps.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can find an expression for 1/(1 + ω^{999}).

Let me note that 1 + ω^{999} = (ω^{499.5})^2, but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that 1/(1 + ω^{999}) = (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω^{1998}).

But 1998=1997 +1, so ω^{1998}=ω.

Thus, 1/(1 + ω^{999})= (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω).

So, S =998 + (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω).

But (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω) is the sum T, which we already considered.

Hmm, but how does that help us? Maybe we can compute (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω) in another way.

Wait, let me consider that (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω) = sum_{n=0}^{998} ω^n.

But this is a geometric series. So, let me compute it.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that (1 - ω^{1997})/(1 - ω) =0, so (1 - ω^{1997})=0, which is true.

But (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω) is not zero unless ω^{999}=1, which it isn't, since 999 <1997.

Wait, but perhaps I can note that (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω) = sum_{n=0}^{998} ω^n.

But I don't think that's helpful.

Wait, another idea: Let me note that the original sum S is equal to 998 + 1/(1 + ω^{999}).

But S is also equal to sum_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + ω^k). So, if I can express S in terms of itself or something else.

Wait, maybe I can consider that sum_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + ω^k) = sum_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + ω^k) = something symmetric.

Wait, perhaps consider that if I let k go from 1 to 1997, then ω^k are all the roots except 1.

Wait, another approach: Let me note that sum_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + ω^k) = sum_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + ω^k).

Let me denote this sum as S.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - ω^k):

S = sum_{k=1}^{1997} (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

Hmm, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps write 1/(1 + ω^k) = (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

But then, as before, 1 - ω^{2k} = (1 - ω^k)(1 + ω^k), so 1/(1 + ω^k) = (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

But maybe it's better to think about the sum as sum_{k=1}^{1997} (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

But I don't know.

Wait, another idea: Let me consider that 1 + ω^k = (ω^{k/2} +1)(ω^{k/2} -1)/ω^{k/2}, but that might not help because k is integer, but ω^{k/2} would be complex.

Alternatively, maybe note that 1/(1 + ω^k) = (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

Wait, but again, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the sum S and pair terms in a different way.

Wait, another approach: Let me note that if I let z = ω, then S = sum_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + z^k).

Let me consider that sum as a function f(z) = sum_{k=1}^{n} 1/(1 + z^k), where n=1997.

But I don't know if that helps.

Wait, but perhaps consider that f(z) = sum_{k=1}^{n} 1/(1 + z^k).

But maybe I can write this as sum_{k=1}^{n} (1/(1 + z^k) ) = sum_{k=1}^{n} (1 - z^k)/(1 - z^{2k}).

But that seems similar to before.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for geometric series or partial fractions.

Wait, another idea: Let me note that sum_{k=1}^{n} 1/(1 + z^k) can be expressed as sum_{k=1}^{n} (1 - z^k)/(1 - z^{2k}).

But we can also note that 1/(1 + z^k) = sum_{m=0}^\infty (-1)^m z^{k m}, for |z| <1, but since |z|=1, this might not converge.

Hmm, but maybe in some formal sense.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that sum_{k=1}^{n} 1/(1 + z^k) = (n -1)/2, because the sum is symmetric.

Wait, in the case of n=3, the sum was 1. For n=3, (3 -1)/2 =1, which matches.

For n=5, what would the sum be? Let me test n=5.

Wait, n=5, sum_{k=1}^5 1/(1 + ω^k), where ω^5=1, ω≠1.

Compute each term:

1/(1 + ω) +1/(1 + ω^2) +1/(1 + ω^3) +1/(1 + ω^4) +1/(1 + ω^5).

But ω^5=1, so last term is 1/(1 +1)=1/2.

Compute the first four terms.

Note that ω^3 = ω^{-2}, ω^4= ω^{-1}.

So, 1/(1 + ω) +1/(1 + ω^2) +1/(1 + ω^{-2}) +1/(1 + ω^{-1}) +1/2.

Compute 1/(1 + ω) +1/(1 + ω^{-1}) = [1/(1 + ω)] + [ω/(1 + ω)] = (1 + ω)/(1 + ω) =1.

Similarly, 1/(1 + ω^2) +1/(1 + ω^{-2})=1.

So, total sum is 1 +1 +1/2=2.5=5/2.

Wait, for n=5, which is odd, the sum is (n -1)/2 +1/(1 +1)= (4)/2 +1/2=2 +0.5=2.5=5/2.

So, the pattern seems to be S=(n +1)/2 when n is odd.

Wait, n=3: (3 +1)/2=2, but our earlier calculation gave S=1.

Wait, n=3: S=1, n=5: S=5/2=2.5. So, the pattern is S=(n -1)/2 +1/2= n/2.

Wait, for n=3: 3/2=1.5≠1.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, for n=3: sum=1, which is (3 -1)/2=1.

n=5: sum=5/2=2.5, which is (5 -1)/2 +1=2 +1=3. No, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps S=(n -1)/2 for n odd.

But n=3: 1, n=5: 2, but we have n=5 sum=2.5≠2.

Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, maybe let's see a general approach.

I recall that for the sum S = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 1/(1 + ω^k), where ω^n=1, the sum is (n -1)/2.

Wait, let me test n=3: sum_{k=1}^{2}1/(1 + ω^k).

In our earlier case, for n=3, sum was 1/(1 + ω) +1/(1 + ω^2)=1.

But according to formula, (3 -1)/2=1, which matches.

For n=5: sum_{k=1}^4 1/(1 + ω^k)=?

Wait, in our earlier calculation, it was 2.5, but according to formula, (5 -1)/2=2, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps it's more complicated.

Wait, maybe I can find a general formula for S = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 1/(1 + ω^k), where ω^n=1.

Let me note that S = sum_{k=1}^{n -1} 1/(1 + ω^k).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - ω^k):

S = sum_{k=1}^{n -1} (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

But as before, 1 - ω^{2k}= (1 - ω^k)(1 + ω^k).

Hmm, perhaps I can write S as sum_{k=1}^{n -1} (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

But 1 - ω^{2k}= (1 - ω^k)(1 + ω^k). So, S = sum_{k=1}^{n -1} 1/(1 + ω^k).

Wait, same as before. So, perhaps that approach isn't helpful.

Wait, another idea: Let me note that 1 + ω^k = (ω^{k/2} +1)(ω^{k/2} -1)/ω^{k/2}, but as before, this may not help.

Wait, maybe use the identity that 1/(1 + ω^k) = (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

But 1 - ω^{2k}=1 - (ω^k)^2.

So, if I let x=ω^k, then 1/(1 +x) = (1 -x)/(1 -x^2).

So, in terms of x, the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (1 -x)/(1 -x^2) where x=ω^k.

But 1 -x^2= (1 -x)(1 +x). So, (1 -x)/(1 -x^2)=1/(1 +x).

So, that brings us back again.

Wait, perhaps the sum is equal to sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 1/(1 +x_k), which is the same as S.

Hmm, so that approach is circular.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me consider that the sum S +1 is equal to sum_{k=0}^{n -1} 1/(1 + ω^k).

So, S +1 = sum_{k=0}^{n -1} 1/(1 + ω^k).

But then, n=1997, which is prime.

Wait, maybe there is a formula for sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(1 + ω^k).

Wait, I recall that in some problems, the sum over all roots of 1/(1 + ω^k) can be evaluated using logarithmic derivatives or other methods.

Wait, another idea: Let me consider that the sum_{k=0}^{n -1} 1/(1 + ω^k) = sum_{k=0}^{n -1} (1 - ω^k + ω^{2k} - ω^{3k} + ...).

But that would be a geometric series in the exponent.

But since ω^{n}=1, for each term, the exponents cycle every n.

But the sum becomes sum_{k=0}^{n -1} sum_{m=0}^\infty (-1)^m ω^{m k}.

But interchanging the sums, sum_{m=0}^\infty (-1)^m sum_{k=0}^{n -1} ω^{m k}.

Now, sum_{k=0}^{n -1} ω^{m k} is equal to n if n divides m, otherwise 0.

So, sum_{k=0}^{n -1} ω^{m k} = n if m ≡0 mod n, else 0.

Therefore, the entire double sum becomes sum_{m=0}^\infty (-1)^m *n if m ≡0 mod n, else 0.

So, that is, sum_{m=0}^\infty (-1)^{n * t} *n, where t=0,1,2,...

So, that is sum_{t=0}^\infty (-1)^{n t} *n = n * sum_{t=0}^\infty [(-1)^n]^t.

Now, if n is even, (-1)^n=1, so sum diverges. If n is odd, (-1)^n=-1, so sum is n * sum_{t=0}^\infty (-1)^t.

But sum_{t=0}^\infty (-1)^t is 1/(1 - (-1))=1/2, but that's for the sum from t=0 to infinity. However, in our case, the original sum is finite, because we have n terms in the inner sum.

Wait, maybe my approach is wrong here because interchanging the sums for an infinite series is not valid unless certain conditions are met.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to compute the sum directly, I can use some properties of roots.

Wait, another idea: Let me note that sum_{k=1}^{n} 1/(1 + ω^k) = (n -1)/2.

Wait, for n=3, that gives 1, which is correct.

For n=5, (5 -1)/2=2, but our earlier calculation gave 2.5, so that doesn't match.

Wait, so perhaps it's not a general formula.

Wait, but in our specific case, n=1997, which is prime and odd.

Wait, let me think about it. Maybe the sum is (n -1)/2.

Wait, let me test with n=1: trivial case, sum is 0, which would be (1 -1)/2=0, which works.

n=3: sum=1=(3 -1)/2=1, works.

n=5: sum=2.5=(5 -1)/2=2, which does not match. Hmm, inconsistent.

Wait, so maybe it's not a general formula.

Wait, but in our earlier case, n=5, sum was 2.5. So, it's not exactly (n -1)/2.

Wait, maybe for prime n, the sum is (n -1)/2.

But in n=5, which is prime, the sum was 2.5, which is (5 -1)/2=2, but we had 2.5, which is 5/2. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe another approach: Let me note that in the case of n=3, S=1= (3 -1)/2=1.

In n=5, S=2.5=5/2.

Wait, so in n=3, S=(n)/2 - 0.5, n=5, S=(n)/2.

Wait, maybe for n=3, S=(n)/2 - something. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, that S=(n -1)/2.

Wait, maybe I need to consider another idea.

Wait, I found that S =998 + T, where T=1/(1 + ω^{999}).

But I also know that T + ω^{999} T=1.

So, T(1 + ω^{999})=1.

But S=998 + T.

Wait, but 1 + ω^{999} is a complex number, but maybe I can relate it to something else.

Wait, another idea: Let me note that 1 + ω^{999} = 1 + ω^{-998}, because ω^{999}=ω^{-998} since ω^{1997}=1.

Therefore, 1 + ω^{999}=1 + ω^{-998}=1 + conjugate(ω^{998}).

But unless we know something about ω^{998}, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can write 1 + ω^{999}=1 + ω^{-998}= (ω^{998} +1)/ω^{998}.

But that seems not helpful.

Wait, another idea: Let me note that 1/(1 + ω^{999})= (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω^{1998})= (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω).

But 1 - ω^{999} is a complex number. However, note that 1 - ω^{999} is equal to (ω^{499.5})^2 - (ω^{499.5})^2, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps consider that 1 - ω^{999}= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m.

But we had that earlier.

Wait, but 1 - ω^{999}= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m.

But that is equal to T * (1 - ω^{999})= T*(1 - ω^{999}).

Wait, I think I'm going in circles.

Wait, another thought: Let me consider that S =998 + T, and T=1/(1 + ω^{999}).

But then, note that 1 + ω^{999}=1 + ω^{-998}, and since 998= (1997 -1)/2=998, which is an integer.

Wait, 1997 is a prime, so 998 is (1997 -1)/2.

Therefore, 998 ≡ -1 mod 1997.

Wait, ω^{998}=ω^{-1}, because 998=1997 -1 -998=998, but let me compute 1997 -998=999, so 998 ≡ -999 mod1997.

Wait, actually, 998 +999=1997, so 998 ≡ -999 mod1997.

Therefore, ω^{998}=ω^{-999}.

Therefore, 1 + ω^{999}=1 + ω^{-999}= (ω^{999} +1)/ω^{999}= same as before.

Wait, but maybe I can write 1 + ω^{999}= (ω^{499.5})^2 + (ω^{499.5})^2, but again, 499.5 isn't integer.

Wait, maybe not helpful.

Wait, another idea: Let me note that 1 + ω^{999}=1 + ω^{-998}= (ω^{998} +1)/ω^{998}.

But then, 1 + ω^{999}= (1 + ω^{998})/ω^{998}.

But perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, another approach: Let me note that 1 + ω^{999}=1 + ω^{-998}= (ω^{998} +1)/ω^{998}.

But then, 1 + ω^{999}= conjugate(1 + ω^{998}) if ω is on the unit circle.

But I don't know if that's helpful.

Wait, perhaps consider that 1 + ω^{999}= something.

Wait, maybe I can write 1 + ω^{999}=1 + (-1)^{999} ω^{999}=1 - ω^{999}.

Wait, no, since 999 is odd, so (-1)^{999}= -1, but 1 + ω^{999}=1 + ω^{999}.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, another idea: Let me note that 1 + ω^{999}=1 + ω^{999}= (ω^{499.5})^2 +1. But 499.5 isn't integer.

Wait, maybe think in terms of complex conjugates.

Wait, 1 + ω^{999}=1 + e^{2πi *999/1997}=1 + e^{-2πi *998/1997}.

But that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that 1 + ω^{999}= e^{πi *999/1997} * [e^{-πi *999/1997} + e^{πi *999/1997}] = 2 e^{πi *999/1997} cos(π *999/1997).

So, 1 + ω^{999}=2 e^{πi *999/1997} cos(π *999/1997).

But then, 1/(1 + ω^{999})=1/(2 e^{πi *999/1997} cos(π *999/1997))= e^{-πi *999/1997}/(2 cos(π *999/1997)).

But since e^{-πi *999/1997}= ω^{-999/2}.

Wait, but 999=1997 -998, so ω^{999}=ω^{-998}.

Thus, e^{-πi *999/1997}=ω^{999/2}.

But 999 is odd, so 999/2 is not integer, so ω^{999/2} is not a root of unity, but a 2nd root.

Wait, maybe I can leave it as is.

But then, 1/(1 + ω^{999})= e^{-πi *999/1997}/(2 cos(π *999/1997)).

But this seems complicated.

Wait, another thought: Let me note that 2 cos(π *999/1997)=2 cos(π - π*(1997 -999)/1997)=2 cos(π - π*998/1997)= -2 cos(π*998/1997).

So, 1/(1 + ω^{999})= e^{-πi *999/1997}/(-2 cos(π*998/1997)).

But 998= (1997 -1)/2=998, so π*998/1997=π*(1997 -1)/2 /1997=π*(1 -1/1997)/2=π/2 - π/(2*1997).

Therefore, cos(π*998/1997)=cos(π/2 - π/(2*1997))=sin(π/(2*1997)).

Therefore, 1/(1 + ω^{999})= -e^{-πi *999/1997}/(2 sin(π/(2*1997))).

But this seems really complicated, and I don't see how this helps in summing up.

Wait, maybe I can think of the imaginary parts canceling out, leaving a real number.

But then, 1/(1 + ω^{999}) is a complex number with real and imaginary parts, but when added to S, which is a sum of complex numbers, would result in a real number.

But I don't know.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the imaginary parts cancel out when summing all terms.

Wait, let me think about the sum S.

Each term is 1/(1 + ω^k)=1/(1 + e^{2πi k /1997}).

Each such term can be written as [1 + e^{-2πi k /1997}]/[2 - 2 cos(2πk /1997)].

Wait, no, that's similar to what we did before.

Wait, another idea: Let me consider pairing each term with its complex conjugate.

Since ω^{k} and ω^{1997 -k} are complex conjugates.

So, 1/(1 + ω^{k}) +1/(1 + ω^{1997 -k})= 1/(1 + ω^{k}) +1/(1 + ω^{-k}).

Which is [1/(1 + ω^{k}) +1/(1 + ω^{-k})]= [ (1 + ω^{-k} +1 + ω^{k}) / (1 + ω^{k} + ω^{-k} +1) ]= [2 + ω^{k} + ω^{-k}]/[2 + ω^{k} + ω^{-k} ]=1.

So, each pair sums to 1.

But in our case, when pairing k and 1997 -k, which is equivalent to 1997 -k= -k mod1997, because 1997 -k= -k +1997≡ -k mod1997.

So, each pair (k, -k) sums to 1.

But in our sum S, we have k from1 to1997.

So, how many such pairs are there?

1997 is odd, so from k=1 tok=998 andk=1997 -998=999.

Wait, but 1997 -1=1996, which is even, so 1996/2=998.

So, the pairs are (1,1996),(2,1995),...,(998,999).

Each pair sums to1, so 998 pairs, each summing to1, so total sum is998.

But wait, in our initial pairing, we saw that (k,1997 -k) sum to1, but 1997 is odd, so 1997 -k= -k mod1997.

Wait, but in our specific case, the term whenk=999 is paired withk=1997 -999=998, but we already countedk=998 in the pair.

Wait, no, 1997 -999=998, so whenk=999, it is paired withk=998, which was already paired withk=1.

Wait, so actually, each pair is counted twice.

Wait, no, let me think.

Wait, 1997 terms, when paired as (1,1996),(2,1995),...,(998,999), which is998 pairs, each summing to1.

So, total sum is998.

But wait, in our case, we're summing fromk=1 tok=1997, so that's1997 terms.

But when pairing, 1997 is the total number of terms, so in fact, the number of pairs is(1997 -1)/2=998, sincek=999 is the middle term.

Wait, but no, in our case, the original sum is fromk=1 tok=1997, so it's1997 terms.

But pairingk and1997 -k for k=1 tok=998, each pair sums to1, and the middle termk=999 is1/(1 + ω^{999}).

So, total sum is998*1 +1/(1 + ω^{999})=998 +1/(1 + ω^{999}).

But we already derived that earlier.

So, now, the problem is to compute1/(1 + ω^{999}).

But perhaps note that1/(1 + ω^{999})= (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω^{1998})= (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω).

But wait, since1 - ω^{1998}=1 - ω, because ω^{1998}=ω^{1997 +1}=ω.

So, 1/(1 + ω^{999})= (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω).

But 1 - ω^{999}= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m.

So, (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω)= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m.

But earlier, we saw that sum is a geometric series.

But sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m= (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω).

Wait, but we just did that.

Wait, but then, 1/(1 + ω^{999})= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m.

But that would mean S=998 + sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m.

But sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m is a geometric series, which is equal to (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω).

But (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω)= [1 - ω^{999}]/(1 - ω)= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m.

So, maybe I can write sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m= T.

But then, S=998 + T.

But from earlier, T=1/(1 + ω^{999}).

But I don't know.

Wait, perhaps consider that sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m= (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω).

But then, since1/(1 + ω^{999})= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m, so T= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m.

Therefore, S=998 + sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m.

But sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m is a geometric series, which is (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω).

But 1 - ω^{999}=1 - ω^{-998}, since ω^{999}=ω^{-998}.

So, sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^m= (1 - ω^{-998})/(1 - ω).

But 1 - ω^{-998}=1 - ω^{1997 -998}=1 - ω^{999}= same as before.

Wait, but this just brings us back.

Wait, another idea: Let me note that sum_{m=0}^{n -1} ω^{m}=0, since ω is a primitive nth root.

But in our case, n=1997, so sum_{m=0}^{1996} ω^{m}=0.

Therefore, sum_{m=0}^{1996} ω^{m}=0.

But sum_{m=0}^{1996} ω^{m}= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^{m} + sum_{m=999}^{1996} ω^{m}= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^{m} + sum_{m=1}^{998} ω^{m +999}= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^{m} + sum_{m=1}^{998} ω^{m} ω^{999}= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^{m} + ω^{999} sum_{m=1}^{998} ω^{m}=0.

But sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^{m}= let's call it T1, and sum_{m=1}^{998} ω^{m}= T2.

So, T1 + ω^{999} T2=0.

But T1 + T2= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^{m} + sum_{m=1}^{998} ω^{m}=1 + 2 sum_{m=1}^{998} ω^{m}.

But that equals1 + 2(T2).

But I don't know if that helps.

Wait, but we have:

T1 + ω^{999} T2=0.

But T1=1 + sum_{m=1}^{998} ω^{m}=1 + T2 - ω^{998}.

Wait, no, because T2= sum_{m=1}^{998} ω^{m}, so T1=1 + T2.

Therefore, substituting into T1 + ω^{999} T2=0:

1 + T2 + ω^{999} T2=0.

Factor out T2:

1 + T2(1 + ω^{999})=0.

Therefore, T2= -1/(1 + ω^{999}).

But T2= sum_{m=1}^{998} ω^{m}= -1/(1 + ω^{999}).

But T2 is a sum of complex numbers.

Wait, but T2 is equal to sum_{m=1}^{998} ω^{m}= sum_{m=1}^{998} e^{2πi m /1997}.

Which is a complex number.

But perhaps, this is getting me nowhere.

Wait, but earlier, we have S=998 + T, where T=1/(1 + ω^{999}).

But T=1/(1 + ω^{999})= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^{m}.

But sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^{m}= [1 - ω^{999}]/[1 - ω].

But [1 - ω^{999}]/[1 - ω]= sum_{m=0}^{998} ω^{m}= T.

But then, S=998 + T.

But T= [1 - ω^{999}]/[1 - ω].

But 1 - ω^{999}=1 - ω^{-998}=1 - ω^{1997 -998}=1 - ω^{999}= same as before.

Wait, but I can write T= [1 - ω^{999}]/[1 - ω]= (1 - ω^{999})/(1 - ω).

But 1 - ω^{999}=1 - e^{2πi *999 /1997}.

But then, I don't know.

Wait, another idea: Let me note that1 - ω^{999}=1 - e^{2πi *999 /1997}=1 - e^{2πi*(1 -1997 +999)/1997}=1 - e^{-2πi *998 /1997}=1 - e^{-2πi*(1997 -999)/1997}=1 - e^{-2πi *998 /1997}=1 - e^{2πi*(1997 -998)/1997}=1 - e^{2πi *999 /1997}= same as before.

Wait, not helpful.

Wait, but perhaps note that1 - ω^{999}=1 - e^{2πi *999 /1997}=1 - e^{2πi*(500.5)/998.5}= no, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let me note that 999=1997/2 +1.

Wait, 1997 is prime, so 1997/2=998.5.

So,999=998.5 +0.5.

But not helpful.

Wait, another idea: Let me think about the sum S= sum_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + ω^k).

Let me denote S= sum_{k=1}^{n} 1/(1 + ω^k), where n=1997, and ω is a primitive n-th root.

Then, I can consider that sum_{k=0}^{n -1} 1/(1 + ω^k)= sum_{k=0}^{n -1} 1/(1 + ω^k).

But in our case, k=1 to n, so sum_{k=1}^{n} 1/(1 + ω^k)= S.

But sum_{k=0}^{n} 1/(1 + ω^k)= S +1/(1 +1)= S +1/2.

But in the case whenk=0,1/(1 +1)=1/2.

But in the general case, sum_{k=0}^{n} 1/(1 + ω^k)= (n +1)/2.

Wait, perhaps in complex analysis, the sum over all roots.

Wait, let me consider that sum_{k=0}^{n -1} 1/(1 + ω^k).

Let me evaluate this sum.

Let me write f(x)= sum_{k=0}^{n -1} 1/(1 + ω^k x).

But maybe not helpful.

Wait, another idea: Let me note that sum_{k=0}^{n -1} 1/(1 + ω^k)=n/2.

But is that true?

Wait, when n=3, sum is1/(1 + ω) +1/(1 + ω^2)=1, which is not 3/2.

So, that idea is incorrect.

Wait, but when n=5, sum_{k=0}^{4}1/(1 + ω^k)=5/2? Let's see.

But earlier, n=5, sum_{k=0}^{4}1/(1 + ω^k)=1/(1 +1)+1/(1 +ω)+1/(1 +ω^2)+1/(1 +ω^3)+1/(1 +ω^4}=1/2 + T + T +1/2 + T=1 +3T, which is not 5/2.

Wait, so that's not the case.

Wait, I think I need to find another approach.

Wait, going back to the sum S= sum_{k=1}^{n}1/(1 + ω^k)= sum_{k=1}^{n}1/(1 + ω^k).

Let me note that S= sum_{k=1}^{n}1/(1 + ω^k)= sum_{k=1}^{n} (1 - ω^k + ω^{2k} - ω^{3k} +...).

But since ω^{n}=1, the sum telescopes.

Wait, so sum_{k=1}^{n}1/(1 + ω^k)= sum_{k=1}^{n} sum_{m=0}^\infty (-1)^m ω^{m k}.

But interchanging sums:

sum_{m=0}^\infty (-1)^m sum_{k=1}^{n} ω^{m k}.

But sum_{k=1}^{n} ω^{m k}= sum_{k=0}^{n -1} ω^{m k} -1=0 -1= -1, when m≡0 modn, otherwise, sum_{k=0}^{n -1} ω^{m k}=0.

Therefore, sum_{k=1}^{n} ω^{m k}= -1, whenn dividesm, else0.

So, only whenm ≡0 modn, sum is-1, else0.

Therefore, S= sum_{m=0}^\infty (-1)^m * (-1) whenm ≡0 modn, else0.

Therefore, S= sum_{r=0}^\infty (-1)^{r n}*(-1).

But (-1)^{r n}= (-1)^r, since n is odd.

Therefore, S= sum_{r=0}^\infty (-1)^r*(-1)= sum_{r=0}^\infty (-1)^{r +1}= -1 +1 -1 +1 -1 +... which does not converge.

But that seems problematic.

Wait, perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, another idea: Let me note that 1/(1 + ω^k)= (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

But since 1 - ω^{2k}= (1 - ω^{k})(1 + ω^{k}).

Therefore, 1/(1 + ω^k)= (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

But not helpful.

Wait, another idea: Let me consider that 1/(1 + ω^k)= (1 - ω^k + ω^{2k} - ω^{3k} +...).

As before, but only if |ω^k|<1, which it's not, since |ω^k|=1.

So, that series does not converge.

Wait, another thought: Let me note that 1/(1 + ω^k)= (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

Wait, but then, 1/(1 + ω^k)= (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k})= [1/(1 - ω^{2k})] - [ω^k/(1 - ω^{2k})].

But then, summing overk, we get sum [1/(1 - ω^{2k}) - ω^k/(1 - ω^{2k}) ].

But sum_{k=1}^{n}1/(1 - ω^{2k}) - sum_{k=1}^{n} ω^k/(1 - ω^{2k}).

But 2k modn, sinceω^{n}=1.

So, for eachk, 2k modn, which cycles through different residues.

But since n is prime and odd, 2 is invertible modn.

Therefore, the mappingk →2k modn is a bijection.

Therefore, the set {2k |k=1,...,n} is equal to {1,2,...,n} since2 is invertible.

Therefore, sum_{k=1}^{n}1/(1 - ω^{2k})= sum_{m=1}^{n}1/(1 - ω^{m})= sum_{m=1}^{n}1/(1 - ω^{m}).

Similarly, sum_{k=1}^{n} ω^k/(1 - ω^{2k})= sum_{m=1}^{n} ω^{m/2}/(1 - ω^{m}).

Wait, but m=2k, so k= m/2, but m must be even.

Wait, but since n is odd, m=2k cycles through all residues, but only for k=1,...,n, m=2,4,...,2n≡2,4,...,1 modn.

But since n is odd, 2k modn cycles through all residues not equal to0.

But no, since2 is invertible, the mapping is a permutation.

Therefore, sum_{k=1}^{n} ω^k/(1 - ω^{2k})= sum_{m=1}^{n} ω^{m}/(1 - ω^{2m}).

But this seems similar to the original sum.

Wait, but it's getting too convoluted.

Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, another idea: Let me note that in the sum S= sum_{k=1}^{n}1/(1 + ω^k}, where n=1997.

I can consider that sum_{k=1}^{n}1/(1 + ω^k}= [sum_{k=1}^{n}1]/2= n/2.

Wait, is that true?

Wait, whenn=3, sum is1, which is3/2=1.5≠1.

So, that's not correct.

But wait, in complex analysis, perhaps if you have sum_{k=1}^{n}1/(1 + ω^k}=n/2.

But in our case, n=1997, which is odd.

But n=3 gives1, which is less than3/2.

Wait, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, perhaps consider the function f(x)= sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(x - ω^k}= (nx^{n -1})/(x^n -1).

Wait, let me verify.

Yes, in general, sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(x - ω^k}= (nx^{n -1})/(x^n -1).

This is because the derivative of log(x^n -1)= sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(x - ω^k}.

But in our case, x= -1, so f(-1)= sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(-1 - ω^k}= sum_{k=0}^{n -1} -1/(1 + ω^k}= -S'.

Where S' is the sum fromk=0}^{n -1}1/(1 + ω^k}= (n*(-1)^{n -1})/( (-1)^n -1).

But n=1997 is odd, so (-1)^n= -1.

Therefore, S'= (n*(-1)^{n -1})/( (-1)^n -1 )= (n*(-1)^{1996})/( -1 -1 )= (n*1)/(-2)= -n/2.

Therefore, f(-1)= -S'=n/2.

But f(-1)= sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(-1 - ω^k}= - sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(1 + ω^k}= -S'.

But S'= -n/2, so -S'=n/2.

Therefore, f(-1)=n/2.

But f(-1)= sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(-1 - ω^k}= sum_{k=0}^{n -1} -1/(1 + ω^k}= - sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(1 + ω^k}= -S'.

But from the formula, f(x)= (n x^{n -1})/(x^n -1).

Therefore, f(-1)= (n*(-1)^{n -1})/( (-1)^n -1 )= (n*(-1)^{1996})/( -1 -1 )= (n*1)/(-2)= -n/2.

But earlier, f(-1)=n/2.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, no:

Wait, from the formula, f(x)= sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(x - ω^k}= n x^{n -1}/(x^n -1).

Therefore, f(-1)=n*(-1)^{n -1}/((-1)^n -1)=n*(-1)^{1996}/(-1 -1)=n*1/(-2)= -n/2.

But also, f(-1)= sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(-1 - ω^k}= sum_{k=0}^{n -1}-1/(1 + ω^k}= - sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(1 + ω^k}= -S'.

But S'= sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(1 + ω^k}= [sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(1 + ω^k}.

But whenk=0,1/(1 +1)=1/2.

Whenk=1 to n, S'=1/2 + sum_{k=1}^{n}1/(1 + ω^k}=1/2 + S.

But S'=1/2 + S.

But from above, f(-1)= -S'= - (1/2 + S)= -n/2.

Therefore, - (1/2 + S)= -n/2.

Multiply both sides by -1:

1/2 + S= n/2.

Therefore, S= n/2 -1/2= (n -1)/2.

But n=1997, so S=(1997 -1)/2=1996/2=998.

Therefore, the sum S=998.

Wait, that seems neat.

So, summarizing:

We considered f(x)= sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(x - ω^k}=n x^{n -1}/(x^n -1).

Then, evaluated atx=-1:

f(-1)=n*(-1)^{n -1}/((-1)^n -1)= -n/2.

But also, f(-1)= sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(-1 - ω^k}= - sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(1 + ω^k}= -S'.

But S'= sum_{k=0}^{n -1}1/(1 + ω^k}=1/2 + S, since whenk=0,1/(1 +1)=1/2, and for k=1 to n, that's S.

Therefore, f(-1)= - (1/2 + S)= -n/2.

Thus, 1/2 + S= n/2.

Therefore, S= n/2 -1/2= (n -1)/2.

Since n=1997, S=(1997 -1)/2=998.

Therefore, the sum is998.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{998}
</think>

Given \(\omega^{\frac{1}{1997}} = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\), we need to evaluate the sum \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}}\).

1. Recognize that \(\omega\) is a primitive 1997th root of unity, meaning \(\omega^{1997} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(0 < k < 1997\).

2. Consider the function \(f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1}{x - \omega^k}\). This function can be expressed as \(\frac{1997 x^{1996}}{x^{1997} - 1}\).

3. Evaluate \(f(-1)\):
   \[
   f(-1) = \sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1}{-1 - \omega^k} = - \sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k}
   \]
   Using the formula for \(f(x)\), we get:
   \[
   f(-1) = \frac{1997 (-1)^{1996}}{(-1)^{1997} - 1} = \frac{1997 \cdot 1}{-1 - 1} = -\frac{1997}{2}
   \]

4. Relate this to the sum \(S\):
   \[
   f(-1) = - \sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} = - \left( \frac{1}{1 + 1} + \sum_{k=1}^{1997} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} \right)
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   - \left( \frac{1}{2} + S \right) = -\frac{1997}{2}
   \]
   Solving for \(S\):
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} + S = \frac{1997}{2}
   \]
   \[
   S = \frac{1997}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1996}{2} = 998
   \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{998}\).
