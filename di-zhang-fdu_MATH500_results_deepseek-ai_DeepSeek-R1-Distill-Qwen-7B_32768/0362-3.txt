Question:
What is the total surface area, in square inches, of a cube with a volume of $1$ cubic foot?

Correct Answer:
Recall that  $$1 \mbox{ foot} = 12 \mbox{ inches}$$

Hence $$1 \mbox{ foot}^2 = 12^2 \mbox{ inches}^2 = 144 \mbox{ inches}^2$$

Finally, remember the formula $V = l \times w \times h$, that is, Volume is the product of length, width, and height.

The length, height, and width for a cube are equal, so the cube we are given has sides of length $1 \mbox{ feet}$. Now, a cube has 6 faces, so the surface area of our cube is $$6 \times (1 \mbox{ foot} \times 1 \mbox{ foot}) = 6 \mbox{ feet}^2$$

Now, convert: $$ 6 \mbox{ feet}^2 \frac{144 \mbox{ inches}^2}{1 \mbox{ foot}^2} = 864 \mbox{ inches}^2$$

So, our final answer is $\boxed{864 \mbox{ inches}^2}$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem here: "What is the total surface area, in square inches, of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot?" Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.

First off, I know that a cube has all its sides equal. So, if I can find the length of one edge, I can figure out the surface area. But wait, the volume is given in cubic feet, and the answer needs to be in square inches. I think I need to convert units here. Units can be tricky sometimes, so I need to be careful.

Let me recall the formula for the volume of a cube. Volume (V) is equal to side length cubed, so V = s³, where s is the length of a side. Since the volume is 1 cubic foot, that means s³ = 1 ft³. To find s, I take the cube root of both sides. So, s = ∛(1 ft³) which is 1 foot. Hmm, so each side of the cube is 1 foot long.

But the question asks for the surface area in square inches. I need to convert feet to inches because 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, each side is 12 inches long. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the surface area (SA) of a cube is calculated by the formula SA = 6s². Since a cube has 6 faces, each with an area of s². So, plugging in the side length in inches, we have SA = 6*(12 inches)².

Let me calculate that. First, compute 12 squared: 12*12 is 144. Then multiply that by 6: 144*6. Hmm, 144 times 6. Let me do that step by step. 100*6 is 600, 40*6 is 240, and 4*6 is 24. So, adding those together: 600 + 240 is 840, plus 24 is 864. So, 144*6 is 864.

Therefore, the surface area is 864 square inches. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Volume of cube is 1 cubic foot, so each side is 1 foot.
2. Convert 1 foot to inches: 12 inches.
3. Surface area formula: 6*(side length)².
4. Compute (12)²: 144.
5. Multiply by 6: 144*6=864.

Everything seems to add up. I don't think I missed any steps here. Sometimes when converting units, it's easy to mix up feet and inches, but in this case, since it's a cube, it's straightforward.

Wait, just to be thorough, let me visualize the cube. Each face is a square with sides of 12 inches. So, each face has an area of 12*12=144 square inches. Then, since there are 6 faces, 6*144=864. Yep, that's consistent. 

I guess another way to think about it is unit conversion first. Since the volume is in cubic feet, and we need the surface area in square inches, maybe I should convert the entire volume to cubic inches first and then find the side length in inches. Let me try that approach to confirm.

I know that 1 foot is 12 inches, so 1 cubic foot is (12 inches)³, which is 12*12*12. Let me calculate that: 12*12 is 144, then 144*12. 144*10 is 1440, 144*2 is 288, so adding them together gives 1440+288=1728. So, 1 cubic foot is 1728 cubic inches. Therefore, the volume is 1728 in³.

Given that the volume of the cube is 1728 in³, the side length s is the cube root of 1728. Let me compute that. I know that 12*12*12 is 1728, so s is 12 inches. Yep, which lines up with what I found earlier. So, the side length is 12 inches.

Then, using the surface area formula, 6*(12)²=6*144=864. So, same answer. This makes me more confident that 864 square inches is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about what 1 cubic foot is in terms of cubic inches and then find the surface area. But that seems more complicated because I still need to get back to inches. Maybe not the best approach, but it's reassuring that both methods give the same result.

Just to recap, steps were:

1. Understand that the cube has equal sides, so volume is s³.
2. Given volume is 1 ft³, so s = 1 ft.
3. Convert 1 ft to inches: 12 inches.
4. Calculate surface area using SA = 6s², which is 6*(12)².
5. Compute 12²: 144, then 6*144: 864.
6. Verified by converting volume to cubic inches, found side length same way, and recalculated surface area same result.

I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be extra sure, let me compute 6*(12)^2 again.

First, 12 squared is 144, correct. Then, 144*6: 144*5 is 720, plus 144 is 864. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, 144*6 can be broken down as (100+44)*6=100*6 + 44*6=600 + 264=864. Yep, same result.

So, I think 864 square inches is definitely the answer here.

I just want to make sure that the question didn't have any trick or anything. Sometimes problems have units or wording that can be tricky, but in this case, it's straightforward: volume is given in cubic feet, convert to side length in inches, then compute surface area.

So, all in all, I feel confident that 864 square inches is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The total surface area is \boxed{864} square inches.
</think>

Given a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to find its total surface area in square inches.

1. The volume of a cube is given by \( V = s^3 \), where \( s \) is the side length. Since the volume is 1 cubic foot, we have:
   \[
   s^3 = 1 \text{ ft}^3 \implies s = 1 \text{ foot}
   \]

2. Convert the side length from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, we have:
   \[
   s = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The surface area \( SA \) of a cube is given by \( SA = 6s^2 \). Plugging in the side length in inches:
   \[
   SA = 6 \times (12 \text{ inches})^2
   \]

4. Calculate \( (12 \text{ inches})^2 \):
   \[
   (12)^2 = 144
   \]

5. Multiply by 6 to find the surface area:
   \[
   SA = 6 \times 144 = 864
   \]

Thus, the total surface area is \(\boxed{864}\) square inches.
