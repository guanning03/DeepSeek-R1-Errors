Question:
Bob and Alice each have a bag that contains one ball of each of the colors,  blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob then randomly selects one ball from his bag and  puts it into Alice's bag. What is the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same?

Correct Answer:
After Alice puts the ball into Bob's bag, his bag will contain six balls: two of one color and one of each of the other colors. After Bob selects a ball and places it into Alice's bag, the two bags will have the same contents if and only if Bob picked one of the two balls in his bag that are the same color. Because there are six balls in the bag when Bob makes his selection, the probability of selecting one of the same colored pair is $2/6=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem where Bob and Alice each have a bag with balls of different colors: blue, green, orange, red, and violet. That means each of them starts with 5 balls, one of each color. Then, Alice randomly picks one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. After that, Bob randomly selects one ball from his bag (which now has 6 balls) and puts it into Alice's bag. The question is asking for the probability that after this whole process, both Alice and Bob have the same set of balls in their bags.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. Maybe I should think about what happens in each step and how it affects the final outcome.

First, Alice has her original 5 balls: B, G, O, R, V. She randomly selects one to put into Bob's bag. So, she's choosing uniformly at random, right? Since all the balls are equally likely to be picked. So, the probability of her picking any specific color is 1/5.

Once Alice puts a ball into Bob's bag, Bob's bag now has 6 balls: his original 5 plus the one Alice gave him. Then, Bob randomly selects one of these 6 balls to put back into Alice's bag. So again, each of the 6 balls has an equal chance of being selected, which would be 1/6.

Now, after this exchange, we want the two bags to have the same set of balls. That means that the ball Alice took from Bob must be the same as the one Bob took back to Alice. Otherwise, their bags would have different sets.

Wait, let me think about that. If Alice gives a ball to Bob, and then Bob gives a different ball back to Alice, then Alice's bag would have her original 4 balls plus the one Bob gave her, but Bob would have his original 4 balls plus the one he took from Alice. So their bags are different because they swapped different balls.

But if Alice gives a ball to Bob, and then Bob gives back the same ball, then Alice's bag remains with 5 balls, and Bob's bag also remains with 5 balls, both containing the same original set, right? Because Alice gave one and Bob gave back the same one.

So, in order for the two bags to have the same contents after this process, the ball that Alice gives to Bob must be the same ball that Bob gives back to Alice. Otherwise, they'll have different sets.

Therefore, the probability we are looking for is the probability that Alice and Bob exchange the same ball. So, it's the probability that Bob selects the same ball that Alice gave him.

Let me formalize this a bit. Let's denote the color of the ball Alice picks as C. So, Alice picks C and puts it into Bob's bag. Now, Bob has 6 balls: his original 5 plus C. He picks one ball at random to put back into Alice's bag. The probability that he picks C is 1/6 because there are 6 balls and each is equally likely.

So, the probability that Bob picks the same ball Alice gave him is 1/6. Since Alice could have picked any of the 5 colors, but regardless of which color she picked, the probability that Bob picks it is 1/6. So, the total probability is 1/6.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure this makes sense. Because Alice is choosing uniformly at random, and Bob is also choosing uniformly at random. So, is the probability just 1/6?

Let me think about it another way. Maybe I can model this as a probability problem with two stages.

First, Alice selects a color uniformly at random from 5. So, the probability of selecting any color is 1/5.

Then, Bob, after receiving that color, selects a color uniformly at random from 6, which includes the one that Alice gave him. So, the probability that Bob selects the same color as Alice gave him is 1/6.

Therefore, the probability that both events happen (Alice picks color C, then Bob picks color C again) is the product of the two probabilities: (1/5) * (1/6) = 1/30 for each color.

Since there are 5 colors, we can sum this probability over all 5 colors. So, 5 * (1/30) = 1/6.

So, that confirms it. The probability is 1/6.

But wait, maybe I should think about this in terms of the entire process, not just for one color. Let's consider the total number of possible outcomes.

When Alice picks a ball and gives it to Bob, there are 5 choices for Alice. Then, Bob picks one of 6 balls. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 5 * 6 = 30.

Now, how many of these outcomes result in the two bags having the same contents? That would be the cases where Alice and Bob exchange the same ball. So, for each color that Alice could pick, there's exactly one outcome where Bob picks the same color. Since Alice has 5 colors, there are 5 such successful outcomes.

Therefore, the number of successful outcomes is 5, and the total number of possible outcomes is 30. So, the probability is 5/30, which simplifies to 1/6. That's the same answer as before.

So, that makes me more confident that 1/6 is the correct probability.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about this problem in terms of expected value or permutations, but that might complicate things. I think the straightforward approach is the best.

Wait, another way to think about it: After the exchange, the two bags have the same number of balls, but the content might differ. For their contents to be the same, the ball that Alice gave to Bob must be the same as the one Bob gave back to Alice. So, that is only possible if the two balls are the same. Since Alice picks one, and Bob picks one, the probability that they are the same is equal to the probability that Bob picks the same as Alice, which is 1/6.

Alternatively, think about the problem as a two-step process where the first step is Alice giving a ball to Bob, and the second step is Bob giving a ball back to Alice. The only way their bags are the same is if the net transfer is zero, i.e., Alice gave a ball and Bob gave the same ball back.

Therefore, the probability is 1/6.

I think this is correct.

**Final Answer**
The probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.

Alice and Bob each start with a bag containing one ball of each color: blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob then randomly selects one ball from his bag (which now has 6 balls) and puts it into Alice's bag. We need to find the probability that after this process, both bags contain the same set of balls.

1. Alice selects a ball uniformly at random from her 5 balls. The probability of selecting any specific color is \( \frac{1}{5} \).
2. After receiving Alice's ball, Bob has 6 balls in his bag. He selects one ball uniformly at random, so the probability of selecting the same ball Alice gave him is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

The probability that Bob selects the same ball Alice gave him is the product of the two probabilities:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{6} \right) = \frac{1}{30} \]

Since there are 5 colors, we sum this probability over all 5 colors:
\[ 5 \times \frac{1}{30} = \frac{1}{6} \]

Thus, the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same is \( \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}} \).
