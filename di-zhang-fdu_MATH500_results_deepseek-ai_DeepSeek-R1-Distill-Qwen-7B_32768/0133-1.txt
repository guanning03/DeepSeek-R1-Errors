Question:
For what values of $x$ is it true that $x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10$? Express your answer in interval notation.

Correct Answer:
Re-arranging, $x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0$. The left-hand quadratic factors as $x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0$. Thus, $x-7$ and $x+2$ have opposite signs, so $-2 \le x \le 7$ and $\boxed{x \in [-2,7]}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: \(x^2 - 5x - 4 \leq 10\). Hmm, I think I need to find all the values of \(x\) that make this true. Let me try to remember how to approach quadratic inequalities. 

First, maybe I should move all terms to one side to make it easier to handle. That way, I can have a single quadratic expression on one side and zero on the other. So, subtracting 10 from both sides gives:

\(x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \leq 0\)

Simplifying that, I combine the constants:

\(x^2 - 5x - 14 \leq 0\)

Alright, so now the inequality is \(x^2 - 5x - 14 \leq 0\). I think the next step is to solve the corresponding quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\) to find the critical points. These points will help me determine the intervals to test for the inequality.

To solve \(x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\), I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) where \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = -14\).

Plugging in the values:

\(x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(-14)}}{2(1)}\)

Simplifying inside the square root:

\(x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 56}}{2}\)

Because \(-4ac = -4(1)(-14) = 56\). So, adding 25 and 56 gives 81:

\(x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2}\)

Since \(\sqrt{81} = 9\), this becomes:

\(x = \frac{5 \pm 9}{2}\)

So, there are two solutions:

1. \(x = \frac{5 + 9}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7\)
2. \(x = \frac{5 - 9}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2\)

Okay, so the roots are at \(x = -2\) and \(x = 7\). These points divide the number line into three intervals:

1. \( (-\infty, -2) \)
2. \( (-2, 7) \)
3. \( (7, \infty) \)

Now, I need to test each interval to see where the quadratic expression \(x^2 - 5x - 14\) is less than or equal to zero. 

To do this, I can pick a test point from each interval and plug it into the expression to see if it satisfies the inequality.

**First interval: \( (-\infty, -2) \)**

Let me choose \(x = -3\).

Plugging into \(x^2 - 5x - 14\):

\((-3)^2 - 5(-3) - 14 = 9 + 15 - 14 = 10\)

So, \(10 > 0\), which doesn't satisfy the inequality \( \leq 0 \). So, this interval is not part of the solution.

**Second interval: \( (-2, 7) \)**

Let me pick \(x = 0\).

Plugging into the expression:

\(0^2 - 5(0) - 14 = 0 - 0 - 14 = -14\)

\(-14 \leq 0\), so this satisfies the inequality. Therefore, this interval is part of the solution.

**Third interval: \( (7, \infty) \)**

Let me choose \(x = 8\).

Plugging into the expression:

\(8^2 - 5(8) - 14 = 64 - 40 - 14 = 10\)

Again, \(10 > 0\), which doesn't satisfy the inequality. So, this interval is not part of the solution.

Now, I should also check the critical points \(x = -2\) and \(x = 7\) to see if they satisfy the inequality.

At \(x = -2\):

\((-2)^2 - 5(-2) - 14 = 4 + 10 - 14 = 0\)

\(0 \leq 0\) is true, so \(x = -2\) is included.

At \(x = 7\):

\(7^2 - 5(7) - 14 = 49 - 35 - 14 = 0\)

Again, \(0 \leq 0\) is true, so \(x = 7\) is included as well.

Therefore, combining the intervals where the expression is less than or equal to zero, and including the endpoints, the solution is the interval from \(-2\) to \(7\), inclusive.

So, in interval notation, that's written as \([-2, 7]\).

Wait, let me just double-check in case I made any calculation mistakes. It's easy to mess up signs when dealing with quadratics.

Going back to the quadratic equation: \(x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\). The roots were 7 and -2. Let me verify that:

For \(x = 7\):

\(7^2 - 5(7) - 14 = 49 - 35 - 14 = 0\). Correct.

For \(x = -2\):

\((-2)^2 - 5(-2) - 14 = 4 + 10 - 14 = 0\). Correct.

Good, so the roots are correct.

Then, testing the intervals:

- For \(x = -3\), which is left of both roots, the expression was positive, so not part of the solution.

- For \(x = 0\), between the roots, expression was negative, so included.

- For \(x = 8\), right of both roots, expression was positive, not included.

So, the interval between the roots is where the quadratic is negative, which is the solution.

Therefore, I think my solution is correct.

**Final Answer**
The values of \(x\) that satisfy the inequality are \boxed{[-2, 7]}.

To solve the inequality \(x^2 - 5x - 4 \leq 10\), we first move all terms to one side:

\[x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \leq 0\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[x^2 - 5x - 14 \leq 0\]

Next, we solve the corresponding quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) where \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = -14\):

\[x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(-14)}}{2(1)}\]
\[x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 56}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{5 \pm 9}{2}\]

This gives the solutions:

\[x = \frac{14}{2} = 7\]
\[x = \frac{-4}{2} = -2\]

The roots are \(x = -2\) and \(x = 7\), which divide the number line into three intervals: \((-\\infty, -2)\), \((-2, 7)\), and \((7, \infty)\). We test each interval:

- For \(x = -3\) in \((-\\infty, -2)\), the expression is positive.
- For \(x = 0\) in \((-2, 7)\), the expression is negative.
- For \(x = 8\) in \((7, \infty)\), the expression is positive.

Since the quadratic expression is less than or equal to zero in the interval \((-2, 7)\) and at the endpoints \(x = -2\) and \(x = 7\), the solution is:

\[\boxed{[-2, 7]}\]
