Correct Answer:
Draw the dashed line segment in the figure below to divide the trapezoid into a rectangle and a right triangle.  The area of the rectangle is $(5\text{ cm})(3\text{ cm})=15\text{ cm}^2$, and the area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}(3\text{ cm})(9\text{ cm}-5\text{ cm})=6\text{ cm}^2$.  Adding the area of the rectangle and the area of the triangle, we find that the area of the trapezoid is $\boxed{21}$ square centimeters. [asy]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this trapezoid here, and I need to find its area in square centimeters. Hmm, trapezoids can be a bit tricky, but I remember there's a formula for the area. I think it's something like the average of the two bases multiplied by the height. Let me recall, is it (base1 + base2)/2 * height? Yeah, that sounds right.

Looking at the Asymptote figure provided, it seems like the trapezoid is drawn with some specific measurements. Let me try to parse the Asymptote code a bit to understand the coordinates and the sides. The code draws lines from (0,0) to (27,0) to (15,9) to (0,9) and back to (0,0). So, the trapezoid has vertices at (0,0), (27,0), (15,9), and (0,9). 

Alright, so maybe I can figure out the lengths of the two bases and the height from this. The bases are the two parallel sides of the trapezoid. In a trapezoid, the bases are the sides that are parallel. Looking at the coordinates, the side from (0,0) to (27,0) is along the x-axis, so that's definitely one base. The length of that base is 27 cm, from (0,0) to (27,0). 

Then, the top side is from (0,9) to (15,9), which is parallel to the bottom base. So, the length of the top base is from x=0 to x=15, so that's 15 cm. So, base1 is 27 cm, base2 is 15 cm. 

Now, the height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance between these two bases. Since the bases are horizontal (they're along y=0 and y=9), the vertical distance between them is 9 cm. So, the height is 9 cm.

Wait, let me make sure. The height is the distance between the two parallel sides, which in this case are at y=0 and y=9, so yes, that's 9 cm. 

So, plugging these into the area formula: (base1 + base2)/2 * height. That would be (27 + 15)/2 * 9. Let me compute that.

First, 27 plus 15 is 42. Then, 42 divided by 2 is 21. Then, 21 multiplied by 9 is 189. So, the area should be 189 square centimeters.

But wait, let me double-check just to be sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I misread the lengths of the bases or the height. 

Looking back at the Asymptote code, the trapezoid is drawn with vertices at (0,0), (27,0), (15,9), and (0,9). So, the bottom base is from (0,0) to (27,0), which is 27 units long, and the top base is from (0,9) to (15,9), which is 15 units. So, that part seems correct.

The height is the vertical distance between these two bases, which is 9 units, from y=0 to y=9. So, that's correct too.

But just to make sure, maybe I can compute the area another way, like dividing the trapezoid into simpler shapes. Maybe a rectangle and a triangle?

Looking at the figure, from (0,0) to (0,9) to (15,9) to (15,0) would form a rectangle, but since the trapezoid goes all the way to (27,0), perhaps there's a triangle on the other side.

Wait, actually, let me think. The trapezoid is from (0,0) to (27,0) to (15,9) to (0,9) back to (0,0). So, if I split this trapezoid into a rectangle and a triangle, the rectangle would be from (0,0) to (0,9) to (15,9) to (15,0) to (0,0). The area of this rectangle would be 15 cm (length) times 9 cm (height) which is 135 square centimeters.

Then, the remaining part of the trapezoid is a triangle. The triangle would have vertices at (15,9), (27,0), and (15,0). Wait, is that correct? Let me see. From (15,9) to (27,0) to (15,0) back to (15,9). Hmm, that seems like a right triangle.

Wait, actually, from (15,9) to (27,0) is a line, and from (27,0) to (15,0) is another line. So, that is indeed a triangle with base length from (15,0) to (27,0), which is 12 cm, and height from (15,9) down to (15,0), which is 9 cm. 

So, the area of the triangle would be (base * height)/2, which is (12 * 9)/2 = 108 / 2 = 54 square centimeters.

So, adding the area of the rectangle and the area of the triangle: 135 + 54 = 189 square centimeters. That's the same result I got before. So, that's reassuring.

Alternatively, I could also compute the area using coordinates. There's a formula called the shoelace formula that can compute the area of a polygon when you know the coordinates of its vertices. Maybe I can apply that here as another check.

The shoelace formula says that for a polygon with vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn), the area is |(x1y2 + x2y3 + ... + xn y1) - (y1x2 + y2x3 + ... + ynx1)| / 2.

So, let's apply this to the trapezoid with vertices at (0,0), (27,0), (15,9), (0,9).

Compute the sum of x1y2 + x2y3 + x3y4 + x4y1:

x1y2 = 0*0 = 0

x2y3 = 27*9 = 243

x3y4 = 15*9 = 135

x4y1 = 0*0 = 0

So, the first sum is 0 + 243 + 135 + 0 = 378

Now, the second sum: y1x2 + y2x3 + y3x4 + y4x1

y1x2 = 0*27 = 0

y2x3 = 0*15 = 0

y3x4 = 9*0 = 0

y4x1 = 9*0 = 0

So, the second sum is 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the area is |378 - 0| / 2 = 378 / 2 = 189 square centimeters. Perfect, that's consistent with what I got earlier.

Wait, so all three methods: the standard trapezoid area formula, splitting into a rectangle and a triangle, and the shoelace formula, give me the same result: 189. So, I can be pretty confident that the area is 189 square centimeters.

But just to make sure, let me visualize the figure again. The trapezoid is on the coordinate system with points at (0,0), (27,0), (15,9), (0,9). So, the bottom base is 27 units, top base is 15 units, and the vertical distance is 9 units. 

Alternatively, sometimes in trapezoids, especially when not aligned with the axes, you have to compute the height differently, but in this case, since both bases are horizontal, the vertical distance is straightforward.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, they drew right angles at (0,0) and (0,9), which suggests that the sides at (0,0) and (0,9) are perpendicular to the bases, so that confirms that it's a right trapezoid. So, that might be why the height is just 9 cm.

But in this case, it's even simpler because both sides are vertical, so the height is just the vertical distance between the two bases, which is 9 cm.

So, to recap: bases are 27 cm and 15 cm, height is 9 cm, area is (27 + 15)/2 * 9 = 189.

Wait, hold on a second. In the Asymptote code, the labels are given: "5 cm", "5 cm", "3 cm", "9 cm". So, let me see if that affects anything.

Wait, looking back at the Asymptote code, it labels "5 cm" at (21,4.5), which is probably the side from (0,9) to (15,9) to (27,0), so that's the slanted side? Wait, no, at (21,4.5), which is halfway between (15,9) and (27,0)? Wait, no, (21,4.5) is between (27,0) and (15,9). Hmm, actually, that point is the midpoint of the side from (15,9) to (27,0). So, the label "5 cm" is placed there, probably indicating that side is 5 cm.

Similarly, the label "5 cm" is at (7.5,9), which is halfway between (0,9) and (15,9). So, that's the top base, which is 15 cm, but they labeled it as 5 cm? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 7.5 is half of 15, so that's the midpoint of the top base, which is indeed 15 cm. So, perhaps the label is indicating that the top side is 5 cm? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 15 cm is twice 7.5 cm.

Wait, hold on, maybe I misinterpret the labels. Let me parse the Asymptote code again. It labels "5 cm" at (21,4.5), which is in the middle of the side from (15,9) to (27,0). So, that side is 5 cm.

Similarly, the label "5 cm" is at (7.5,9), which is the midpoint of the top base from (0,9) to (15,9). So, the top base is 15 cm, but they labeled it as 5 cm? Hmm, that seems contradictory. Maybe that's a mistake.

Wait, let me check the actual figure. The Asymptote code draws lines from (0,0) to (27,0) to (15,9) to (0,9) to cycle. So, the sides are:

(0,0)-(27,0): length 27 cm

(27,0)-(15,9): length sqrt((27-15)^2 + (0-9)^2) = sqrt(12^2 + 9^2) = sqrt(144 + 81) = sqrt(225) = 15 cm

(15,9)-(0,9): length 15 cm

(0,9)-(0,0): length 9 cm

So, the sides are 27 cm, 15 cm, 15 cm, and 9 cm. So, the side from (27,0) to (15,9) is 15 cm, which is the slanted side on the right.

But in the labels, they have "5 cm" at (21,4.5), which is on the side from (15,9) to (27,0), which is 15 cm long, so that's 5 cm? Wait, no, that's a length? Wait, 21,4.5 is on the side from (15,9) to (27,0). Let me calculate the distance from (15,9) to (27,0). As I did before, it's 15 cm. So, the midpoint is at (21,4.5), right? Because halfway between x=15 and x=27 is 21, and halfway between y=9 and y=0 is 4.5.

So, if they label this midpoint with "5 cm", maybe that's indicating the length of another segment? Wait, but that segment is 15 cm, so labeling it as 5 cm is confusing.

Wait, maybe the label is indicating the length of the side from (27,0) to some point, not the entire side. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the labels are for the sides: one side is 5 cm, another is 5 cm, another is 3 cm, and another is 9 cm. But in the figure, from the Asymptote code, the sides are 27,15,15,9. So, that doesn't add up. Maybe I misinterpret the labels.

Wait, the label "5 cm" is at (21,4.5), which is on the side from (15,9) to (27,0). So, perhaps that side is divided into two segments, each labeled 5 cm? But 5 cm each would make 10 cm total, but the side is 15 cm. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the label "5 cm" is on the base from (0,0) to (5,0), but in the Asymptote code, the base is from (0,0) to (27,0). Hmm, no, the label is at (21,4.5), which is on the right side.

Wait, perhaps the figure is scaled down? Wait, the Asymptote code just defines coordinates, so the labels might be indicating something else. Maybe they are indicating the lengths of the legs? Wait, but in a trapezoid, the legs are the non-parallel sides.

Wait, in this trapezoid, the legs are from (27,0) to (15,9) and from (0,9) to (0,0). So, the sides from (27,0) to (15,9) is 15 cm, and from (0,9) to (0,0) is 9 cm. So, the legs are 15 cm and 9 cm.

But in the labels, they have "5 cm", "5 cm", "3 cm", "9 cm". So, maybe the sides are divided into segments. For example, the side from (0,9) to (0,0) is 9 cm, labeled as "9 cm". The side from (27,0) to (15,9) is 15 cm, labeled as "5 cm" and "5 cm", meaning each segment is 5 cm. Wait, that might be it.

Wait, so if the side from (27,0) to (15,9) is 15 cm, and it's divided into two 5 cm segments? But 5 cm each would make 10 cm total, which is less than 15 cm. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, maybe the labels are indicating the lengths of the projections on the x-axis and y-axis.

Wait, perhaps the label "5 cm" is on the vertical side from (0,0) to (0,9), which is 9 cm, but labeled as 5 cm? That doesn't make sense either.

Alternatively, perhaps the labels are indicating the lengths of the top and bottom bases. But the top base is 15 cm, which is longer than the 5 cm label. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just go back. The Asymptote code defines the figure with coordinates, so the lengths should be based on those coordinates.

Given that, the bottom base is 27 cm, top base is 15 cm, and height is 9 cm. So, to get area, it's (27 + 15)/2 * 9 = 189.

But the labels in the figure are "5 cm", "5 cm", "3 cm", "9 cm". Maybe these are indicating something else, like the legs and the top base? Wait, perhaps the side from (0,9) to (0,0) is 9 cm, labeled as 9 cm. The side from (27,0) to (15,9) is 15 cm, but it's divided into two 5 cm segments? Wait, 5 cm each would only make 10 cm. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the label "5 cm" is indicating the length of the base from (0,0) to (5,0), but that's only 5 cm, but the entire base is 27 cm. That seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, maybe the label "5 cm" is indicating the length of the side from (21,4.5) to somewhere else? Wait, but (21,4.5) is just a midpoint label.

Wait, perhaps the figure is showing that the trapezoid is made up of smaller segments, each labeled with their lengths. Maybe the side from (0,9) to (0,0) is 9 cm, labeled as "9 cm" at (0,4.5). Then, the side from (0,0) to (27,0) is 27 cm, but in the figure, it's divided into segments labeled "5 cm" and "3 cm". Wait, but 5 + 3 is 8, which is less than 27. So, that doesn't add up either.

Wait, maybe the figure is divided into smaller parts with those labels. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the labels are indicating the lengths of the non-parallel sides. Wait, the non-parallel sides are from (27,0) to (15,9) and from (0,9) to (0,0). The latter is 9 cm, labeled as "9 cm", and the former is 15 cm, which could be split into two 5 cm segments? But 5 + 5 is 10, not 15.

Wait, unless the side from (27,0) to (15,9) is split into three segments, each labeled "5 cm", making 15 cm total. So, maybe the Asymptote figure is showing that side divided into three equal parts, each 5 cm. Hmm, that might be.

Alternatively, perhaps the labels are indicating the height of the trapezoid is 9 cm. So, that's clear.

Wait, I think maybe the labels are just indicating specific segments on the figure, but not necessarily corresponding to the lengths of the sides. So, maybe the side from (27,0) to (15,9) is 15 cm, but it's split into two parts, each 5 cm? But 5 + 5 is 10, which is less than 15. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the labels are indicating the lengths of the legs. So, the left leg is 5 cm, the right leg is 5 cm, and the top and bottom bases are 3 cm and 9 cm. But in the Asymptote code, the bottom base is 27 cm, top base is 15 cm, left leg is 9 cm, right leg is 15 cm. So, that seems conflicting.

Wait, I think maybe the figure is scaled down. Because in the Asymptote code, the coordinates go up to (27,0), but the labels are much smaller. Maybe the drawing is scaled down, so that each unit is represented as a smaller centimeter. So, 27 units correspond to 3 cm, 15 units correspond to 5 cm, etc. But that seems inconsistent.

Wait, but the labels say "3 cm", "5 cm", "5 cm", "9 cm". So, perhaps the base from (0,0) to (27,0) is 3 cm, the base from (0,9) to (15,9) is 5 cm, the side from (15,9) to (27,0) is 5 cm, and the side from (0,9) to (0,0) is 9 cm.

But in the Asymptote code, the coordinates go from 0 to 27 on the x-axis, so maybe the figure is scaled such that 27 units correspond to 3 cm? So, each unit is 1/9 cm? Hmm, that seems too small.

Alternatively, maybe the figure is not drawn to scale, and the labels are just indicating the lengths of different parts. So, the base is 27 units, but labeled as 3 cm? That would mean each unit is 1/9 cm, but that seems odd.

Wait, perhaps the labels are not on the sides but on different parts. Let me check the Asymptote code labels again.

label("5 cm",(21,4.5),NE);

label("5 cm",(7.5,9),N);

label("3 cm",(0,4.5),W);

label("9 cm",(13.5,0),S);

So, the labels are placed at specific coordinates:

- (21,4.5): which is on the side from (15,9) to (27,0), midpoint, labeled "5 cm"

- (7.5,9): which is on the top base from (0,9) to (15,9), midpoint, labeled "5 cm"

- (0,4.5): on the left side from (0,9) to (0,0), midpoint, labeled "3 cm"

- (13.5,0): on the bottom base from (0,0) to (27,0), midpoint, labeled "9 cm"

So, these labels are indicating the lengths of specific segments. So, the top base is 15 cm, and its midpoint is labeled "5 cm". Wait, that can't be, because 15 cm is the entire length. Hmm, unless the label is indicating that a segment is 5 cm, but in the Asymptote code, they are labeling the midpoints.

Wait, perhaps the label "5 cm" is indicating the length of the segment from (15,9) to (21,4.5), which is half of the side from (15,9) to (27,0). Since the entire side is 15 cm, half would be 7.5 cm. But they labeled it as 5 cm. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, maybe the label "5 cm" is indicating that from (21,4.5) to somewhere is 5 cm. Wait, but (21,4.5) is the midpoint of the side from (15,9) to (27,0). So, the distance from (15,9) to (21,4.5) is sqrt((21-15)^2 + (4.5 -9)^2) = sqrt(6^2 + (-4.5)^2) = sqrt(36 + 20.25) = sqrt(56.25) = 7.5 cm. So, that segment is 7.5 cm, but it's labeled as 5 cm. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the label is indicating the distance from (21,4.5) to the base, but that seems unclear.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should just stick to the coordinates given in the Asymptote code, which are precise. So, the bottom base is 27 cm, top base is 15 cm, height is 9 cm, and area is (27 + 15)/2 * 9 = 189 cm².

The labels in the figure might be misleading or perhaps they are indicating something else, but in the absence of more information, I think the area is 189 square centimeters.

Wait, but according to the Asymptote code, the sides are 27, 15, 15, and 9. So, maybe it's a trapezoid with bases 27 and 15, legs 15 and 9, and height 9. So, the area should be (27 + 15)/2 * 9 = 189, which still holds.

But just to make sure, let me think about the side lengths. The left side is from (0,9) to (0,0), which is 9 cm, so that's 9 cm. The right side is from (27,0) to (15,9). The distance is sqrt((27-15)^2 + (0 - 9)^2) = sqrt(144 + 81) = sqrt(225) = 15 cm. So, that's 15 cm. The top base is from (0,9) to (15,9), which is 15 cm, and the bottom base is from (0,0) to (27,0), which is 27 cm.

So, the trapezoid has two bases: 27 cm and 15 cm, and the legs are 15 cm and 9 cm. So, the height is the perpendicular distance between the two bases, which is 9 cm, as it's the vertical side from (0,0) to (0,9). So, that's consistent.

Therefore, all these confirm that the area is 189 cm². So, I think I've got it right.

**Final Answer**
The area of the trapezoid is \boxed{189} square centimeters.
</think>

To find the area of the trapezoid, we use the formula for the area of a trapezoid, which is the average of the two bases multiplied by the height. The vertices of the trapezoid are given as (0,0), (27,0), (15,9), and (0,9).

1. **Identify the bases and height:**
   - The bottom base is from (0,0) to (27,0), which is 27 cm.
   - The top base is from (0,9) to (15,9), which is 15 cm.
   - The height is the vertical distance between the two bases, which is 9 cm.

2. **Apply the area formula:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{(b_1 + b_2)}{2} \times \text{height}
   \]
   where \( b_1 = 27 \) cm, \( b_2 = 15 \) cm, and the height is 9 cm.

3. **Calculate the area:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{(27 + 15)}{2} \times 9 = \frac{42}{2} \times 9 = 21 \times 9 = 189
   \]

Thus, the area of the trapezoid is \(\boxed{189}\) square centimeters.
