Question:
The expression $$1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$$is equivalent to 13. If we add parentheses in various locations, we can change this value. For example, $1+2+3-(4+5)+6=1+2+3-9+6=6-9+6=3$. If we only add parentheses (and not rearrange the order of the terms), what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain? (For the purposes of this problem, we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication. For example, $ (1+2+3)(-4)+5+6 $ is not a valid placement of parentheses.)

Enter your answer as a single value.

Correct Answer:
Because every term before the subtraction sign is added, and addition is associative (parentheses don't matter) placing parentheses on them will not change their value. However, subtraction is not associative. Since we are trying to minimize this expression's value, we want to subtract as much as possible. The expression is thus minimized when parentheses are placed in the following location: $1+2+3-(4+5+6)$. This simplifies to $1+2+3-15 = 6-15=\boxed{-9}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I've got this math problem here where I need to find the minimum possible value of the expression \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\) by adding parentheses in different places. The catch is, I can't change the order of the terms or turn any operations into multiplication. I can only use addition and subtraction as they are. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I should recall that parentheses can affect the order in which operations are performed. So, by adding parentheses, I can group certain numbers together and perform operations on them before moving on to the rest. Since the original expression without parentheses is \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\), let me compute that first just to see what value we're starting with.

Calculating that: \(1 + 2 = 3\), then \(3 + 3 = 6\), then \(6 - 4 = 2\), \(2 + 5 = 7\), and \(7 + 6 = 13\). Yes, so the value is 13 as given in the problem. Now, the task is to use parentheses to make this expression as small as possible, not necessarily negative, but the smallest possible value.

So, I need to strategically place parentheses to create the smallest possible sum. Since I can only add parentheses, not rearrange terms or change operations, I need to figure out where to group numbers together to maximize the negative impact or minimize the positive impact on the total.

Let me list the original expression again for clarity: \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\).

I think a good approach is to consider how parentheses can change the sign of certain parts of the expression. For example, if I can make a large positive number negative by grouping it with a minus sign, that would decrease the total. Alternatively, grouping more negative numbers together might not help because they are already negative.

Wait, not sure about that. Let me think.

Each term is either positive or negative. So, if I can group a set of positive terms together and subtract them, that might lower the total. Similarly, grouping a set of negative terms and subtracting them could potentially have a bigger effect? Hmm, actually, negative terms are already negative, so subtracting them would make them positive, which might not help in decreasing the total.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify.

In the original expression, the operations are all addition and subtraction. So, the expression is equivalent to \(1 + 2 + 3 + (-4) + 5 + 6\). So, if I can group some terms with parentheses, I can change the order of operations, but I can't change the signs of the individual numbers.

So, if I group a negative term with its preceding positive terms, I can change the sign of that group. For instance, if I group \(+3 - 4\) as \((3 - 4)\), that becomes \(-1\). Alternatively, grouping \(+2 + 3 - 4\) as \((2 + 3 - 4)\) is still \(-1\). Hmm, similar effect.

But if I group more terms together, I can get a more significant negative number, which might help in reducing the overall total.

Wait, maybe I can create a larger negative number by grouping a larger set of positive and negative terms. Let me try that.

What if I group \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4\) into parentheses: \((1 + 2 + 3 - 4)\). Calculating that: \(1 + 2 = 3\), \(3 + 3 = 6\), \(6 - 4 = 2\). So, that group is 2. Then, the rest of the expression is \(5 + 6 = 11\). So, the total would be \(2 + 11 = 13\), same as before. That didn't help.

Alternatively, if I group \(+3 -4 +5\) as \((3 -4 +5)\). Let's compute that: \(3 -4 = -1\), \(-1 +5 = 4\). Then, the rest would be \(1 + 2 + 6 = 9\). Total is \(4 + 9 = 13\). Also 13. Still same.

Hmm, seems like just grouping these terms didn't help.

Wait, maybe I need to group in a way that turns a larger positive number into a negative or vice versa.

For example, if I group \(1 + 2 + 3\) as \((1 + 2 + 3)\), which is 6. Then, the rest of the expression is \(-4 +5 +6\). Let's compute that: \(-4 +5 = 1\), \(1 +6 =7\). So total is \(6 +7 =13\). Same as before.

Alternatively, what if I group \(1 + 2 + 3 -4\) as before, which is 2, then \(5 +6\) is 11, total 13. Same.

Wait, maybe grouping more terms. Let's try grouping \(1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5\) as \((1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5)\). Compute that: 1+2=3, 3+3=6, 6-4=2, 2+5=7. Then, the last term is 6, so total is 7 +6 =13. Still same.

Hmm, perhaps I need to group some negative numbers with other numbers to subtract them.

Wait, in the original expression, the only negative sign is in front of 4. So, if I can group 4 with other numbers, perhaps I can make a larger negative number.

Wait, for example, grouping \( -4 +5 +6\) as \((-4 +5 +6)\). Compute that: \(-4 +5 =1\), \(1 +6=7\). So, that's positive 7, which is same as before.

Alternatively, grouping \(1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5 +6\) as \(((1 + 2 + 3) -4) +5 +6)\). Which is same as original, 13.

Wait, maybe if I group terms further out. For instance, grouping \(1 + 2 + 3\) as \((1 + 2 + 3)\) which is 6, then grouping \(-4 +5 +6\) as \((-4 +5 +6)\) which is 7, so 6 +7=13.

Alternatively, maybe grouping \(1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5 +6\) differently. Like, \(1 + (2 + 3 -4) + (5 +6)\). Let's compute that: 2+3=5, 5-4=1, 5+6=11. So total is 1 +1 +11=13.

Still 13.

Wait, maybe another approach. Since we can only add parentheses, perhaps we can create a situation where a large positive number is subtracted.

For example, if I can make a group that results in a large positive number and then subtract that entire group. For instance, if I can have something like \(1 + 2 + (3 -4 +5 +6)\). Let me compute that: 3-4=-1, -1+5=4, 4+6=10. So, the group is 10. Then, the expression is \(1 + 2 +10=13\). Again, same.

Alternatively, grouping \(1 + (2 + 3 -4) +5 +6\). 2+3=5, 5-4=1, so group is 1. Then, 1 +1 +5 +6=13.

Wait, seems like all groupings so far don't lower the total. Maybe I need to group in a way that creates a large negative number.

Wait, in the original expression, the only single negative term is -4. If I can group more terms together, maybe I can have a larger negative number.

Wait, for example, if I make a group that includes -4 and then some more positive terms, but that might not make it more negative.

Wait, actually, if I can arrange it so that I have a larger group that is subtracted. For instance, if I can make a group of positive terms, then subtract that group somewhere else.

Wait, let me try grouping \(1 + 2 +3\) as a group, which is 6, then the rest is \(-4 +5 +6\). So, that is \(-4 +5 +6=7\). Then, adding 6 +7=13.

Alternatively, if I group \(1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5\) as a group, which is 7, then the last term is 6, so 7 +6=13.

Wait, maybe if I can group in a way that a larger positive number is subtracted. For example, grouping \(1 +2 +3 +5 +6\) as a group, which is 17, then subtracting 4: \(17 -4=13\). But that's just the same as the original.

Wait, perhaps I need to group in a way that an even larger number is subtracted. For example, maybe grouping \((1 +2 +3 +4)\), which is 10, then subtracting that from the rest. But in the original expression, 4 is subtracted, so if I group 1+2+3+4 as 10, then the expression becomes \(10 -5 -6\). Wait, that would be \(10 -5 -6= -1\). Hmm, that's lower than 13.

Wait, hold on, let me verify that.

Wait, if I group \(1 +2 +3 +4\) as \((1 +2 +3 +4)\), which is 10, then the rest is \(-5 -6\). So, \(10 -5 -6 = -1\). That's actually lower, so that's better. But is that a valid grouping?

Wait, hold on. Let me parse the original expression again: \(1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5 +6\). If I group \(1 +2 +3 +4\), that would require changing the original expression to \( (1 +2 +3 +4) -5 +6 \). Wait, is that allowed?

Wait, because in the original expression, after 3, it's a minus 4, so grouping \(1 +2 +3 +4\) would require that we have an addition before 4, but in the original, it's a minus. So, we cannot just group without considering the operations in between.

Wait, so actually, the expression is \(1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5 +6\). So, the operations are: +2, +3, -4, +5, +6.

Therefore, if we group \(1 +2 +3 -4\), that is a valid grouping because it's the sequence of operations starting from 1 up to -4. Then, the rest is +5 +6.

But if I try to group beyond -4, like \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\), that's the entire expression, which is 13.

But if I want to group \(1 +2 +3 +4\), that would require changing the operator between 3 and 4 from - to +, which is not allowed because the original expression has a -4. So, we cannot change the operator. Therefore, we can only group consecutive terms with their original operations.

Therefore, we can't arbitrarily group terms that would require changing a minus to a plus. So, the grouping must follow the existing operations.

Therefore, in that case, the grouping I considered earlier where I grouped \(1 +2 +3 -4\) is allowed because it's a consecutive set of terms with their original operations.

Wait, but if I group \(1 +2 +3 -4\), which is 1+2+3-4=2, then the remaining terms are +5 and +6, which is 11, so total is 13.

But if I group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5\), that is 1+2+3-4+5=7, then the remaining term is +6, so total is 13.

Alternatively, what if I group \(1 +2 +3\) as a group, which is 6, then the rest is \(-4 +5 +6\), which is 7, so total is 13.

Wait, same as before.

So, regardless of grouping, it seems to add up to 13. Hmm, but the problem says that "we can change the value" by adding parentheses, so there must be a way to make it smaller.

Wait, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I need to group in a way that creates a larger negative number that is subtracted, effectively making the total smaller.

Wait, let me consider the negative terms. We only have a single negative term, which is -4.

But if I can somehow make a larger negative number by grouping, perhaps that can help.

Wait, for example, if I group \(-4 +5 +6\) as \((-4 +5 +6)=7\), which is positive. But that doesn't help.

Alternatively, if I group \(1 +2 +3 -4\), which is 2, as before.

Wait, is there a way to group terms such that the negative number is subtracted multiple times?

Wait, let me think differently. Let me consider that if I can have multiple negative terms, but in the original expression, only the -4 is negative.

Wait, so if I can somehow make a larger negative number by grouping the 4 with other positive terms.

Wait, but in the original expression, the 4 is subtracted, so it's like adding a negative 4.

If I can group 4 with other numbers and have it subtracted as a group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps if I group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \((1 +2 +3) - (4 +5 +6)\). Let's compute that: 1+2+3=6, 4+5+6=15, so 6 -15= -9. That's a negative number, which is lower than 13.

Wait, but is that a valid grouping? Because in the original expression, the operations are +2, +3, -4, +5, +6.

So, grouping \((1 +2 +3)\) and \(-(4 +5 +6)\) would essentially require changing the operations between terms, right? Because between 3 and 4, we have a minus, but if we group them as \(- (4 +5 +6)\), that would require that the operator before 4 is changed from - to -, but I don't think that's allowed.

Wait, actually, in the original expression, it's \(1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5 +6\). So, the operations are:

1 +2 = 3,

3 +3 =6,

6 -4 =2,

2 +5=7,

7 +6=13.

So, the operations are fixed as +, +, -, +, +.

Therefore, if I group \((1 +2 +3)\), that's 6, and then the rest is \(-4 +5 +6\), which is 7, so 6 +7=13.

Alternatively, if I group \(-(4 +5 +6)\), that would effectively be \(-4 -5 -6\), but in the original expression, the operations are fixed, so I can't change the operation before 4; it's a minus.

So, grouping \(-(4 +5 +6)\) would require changing the operator before 4 from + to -, which isn't allowed. So, that's not a valid grouping.

Wait, so is that operationally a valid grouping? Hmm, perhaps not, because the original expression has a minus before 4, so you can't just group 4 +5 +6 with a minus sign unless you change the operator.

Therefore, that grouping isn't allowed.

Hmm, so maybe I need another approach.

Wait, maybe if I can group the expression in a way that creates a larger negative number by combining positive and negative terms.

Wait, for example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, as before, then group \(5 -6\) as -1. But wait, in the original expression, 5 and 6 are added, not subtracted. So, we can't group them as \(5 -6\), because the original operation is +6.

Wait, perhaps if I can group \( -4 +5 +6\) as \(-4 +5 +6=7\), which is same as before.

Wait, maybe grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5\) as 7, and then 6 as 6, which is 13.

Wait, that's the same.

Wait, maybe if I can group the expression as \(1 + (2 +3 -4) +5 +6\). Let's see: 2+3=5, 5-4=1, so group is 1. Then, 1 +1 +5 +6=13. Still same.

Alternatively, grouping \(1 +2 + (3 -4 +5) +6\). Compute that: 3-4=-1, -1+5=4. So, group is 4. Then, 1 +2 +4 +6=13.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: since the only negative number is 4, if I can make 4 subtracted multiple times, that would lower the total more. But in the original expression, 4 is subtracted only once.

But if I can group multiple terms together and subtract them multiple times, but that would require inserting parentheses in a way that creates multiple subtractions. But in the original expression, there's only one subtraction operator before 4.

Wait, let me think about the order of operations. If I can create a situation where a group is subtracted more than once, but with the given expression, I can't really do that because there's only one subtraction.

Wait, unless I can group the operations such that a group is subtracted from another group.

Wait, for example: \((1 +2 +3) - (4 +5 +6)\). But as before, that would require changing the operator before 4 from + to -, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, is there a way to group the expression so that a group is subtracted from another group without changing the operator?

Wait, maybe if I can group the expression as \( (1 +2 +3 -4) + (5 +6)\). Which is 6 -4=2, and 5+6=11, so 2 +11=13. Same as before.

Wait, is there a way to group a larger group that includes 4 and then subtracts it? For example, grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \((1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6\). So, 1+2+3=6, 6-4=2, 2+5=7, so group is 7, then +6=13.

Same as before.

Wait, perhaps grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5 +6)\). But again, this would require changing the operator before 4 from + to -, which isn't allowed. So, that's invalid.

Wait, another approach: maybe I can group terms in such a way that a positive group is subtracted from another positive group, but that might not help.

Wait, for example, grouping \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, and then grouping \(4 -5 -6\) as -7, but in the original expression, it's \(+5 +6\), so we can't group \(4 -5 -6\) because the operator before 4 is a minus.

Wait, so in the original expression, it's \(+2 +3 -4 +5 +6\). So, if I can somehow group \( -4 +5 +6\) as a negative group, but that would be \( -4 +5 +6 =7\), which is positive. Hmm.

Wait, maybe if I can group \(4 +5 +6\) as a group and then subtract it. But again, in the original expression, the operator before 4 is a minus, so grouping 4 +5 +6 would require changing the operator, which isn't allowed.

Wait, hold on. Let me think about the associativity of addition and subtraction. Subtraction can be thought of as adding a negative. So, the entire expression can be written as:

1 + 2 + 3 + (-4) +5 +6.

So, adding all these together.

If I can group terms in such a way that some of these terms are grouped together and then subtracted as a whole.

Wait, for example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3\) as a positive group, and then group \(-4 +5 +6\) as another group, then the total is \( (1 +2 +3) + (-4 +5 +6) =6 +7=13\).

Alternatively, if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as a group and then add 5 and 6, that's 2 +11=13.

Wait, is there a way to group so that a larger negative number is created?

Wait, perhaps if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4 -5 -6\) as a group, but in the original expression, it's \(+5 +6\), so we can't change the operator before 5 and 6.

Wait, so that's not allowed.

Alternatively, if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2 +3) - (4 -5 -6)\). Let me compute that: 1+2+3=6, 4-5-6= -7, so 6 - (-7)=13. But that requires changing the operator before 5 and 6, which isn't allowed.

Wait, so that's not valid.

Hmm, maybe I need to think about the problem differently. Since I can only add parentheses, which can change the order of operations, but not change the operators themselves.

So, the expression is \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\). The operators are fixed: +, +, -, +, +.

So, if I can insert parentheses to change the grouping, but without changing the operators.

So, for example, I can group \(1 + 2 + 3\) as before, or group \(1 + 2 + 3 -4\), or \(1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5\), or \(1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5 +6\).

Alternatively, I can group \(1 + (2 + 3 -4)\), which would be \(1 + (5 -4)=1 +1=2\), then +5 +6=13.

Alternatively, grouping \( (1 + 2) + (3 -4)\), which is 3 -1=2, then +5 +6=13.

Wait, another idea: can I group in such a way that a negative number is subtracted multiple times?

Wait, for example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, then group \(-4 +5 +6\) as 7, then 6 +7=13.

Alternatively, if I group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5\) as 7, then +6=13.

Wait, it's still 13.

Wait, maybe the issue is that without changing the operators, we can't really change the overall sum much.

Wait, let me see. The original sum is 13. If we can't change the operators, just the grouping, can we make the sum smaller? Maybe, but how?

Wait, perhaps if I can group a positive and a negative term together, creating a larger negative number when subtracted.

Wait, for example, grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, which is positive, and then grouping \(5 +6\) as 11, so total is 13.

Alternatively, grouping \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, then grouping \(-4 +5 +6\) as 7, so total is 13.

Wait, so in all cases, it seems like the total is 13.

But the problem says that we can change the value by adding parentheses, so there must be a way to get a smaller value.

Wait, perhaps I need to group terms in a way that subtracts a larger positive number.

Wait, in the original expression, the only way to subtract a number is with the "-4".

If I can somehow group multiple terms that include 4 and subtract their sum, that would be subtracting a larger number, hence decreasing the total.

But in the original expression, 4 is subtracted once. If I can group 4 with other terms and subtract their sum, that would be subtracting a larger number.

Wait, but to do that, I would need to group 4 with other positive terms and have it subtracted from the total.

Wait, for example, if I group \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, then the remaining terms are +5 +6=11, so total is 13.

Alternatively, if I group \(1 +2 +3 +4\) as 10, then the rest is \(-5 -6\), which is -11, so total is 10 -11= -1.

Wait, that seems like a much lower value.

But wait, hold on. In the original expression, the 4 is subtracted, so if I group \(1 +2 +3 +4\) as 10, then the rest of the terms are -5 and -6. But in the original expression, after 4, it's +5 +6. So, grouping 1+2+3+4 would require that instead of +5 +6, it's -5 -6. But I can't change the operators. So, is this possible?

Wait, in the original expression, the operations are: +2, +3, -4, +5, +6.

So, if I group \(1 +2 +3 +4\) as a group, it would require that after 4, the operator is still +, but in reality, it's a - before 4.

So, to group \(1 +2 +3 +4\), the operator between 4 and 5 must be a +, but in the original expression, it's a -, so we can't just change it.

Therefore, that grouping isn't allowed because it would require changing the operator between 4 and 5.

Wait, so that approach doesn't work.

Hmm, perhaps another way: if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \(1 + (2 + 3 -4) + (5 +6)\). Let's compute that:

Compute \(2 + 3 -4\): 2 +3=5, 5 -4=1.

Compute \(5 +6=11\).

So, total is \(1 +1 +11=13\).

Same as before.

Alternatively, group \(1 +2 + (3 -4 +5 +6)\). Compute \(3 -4 +5 +6\): 3 -4=-1, -1 +5=4, 4 +6=10.

So, total is \(1 +2 +10=13\).

Same result.

Wait, perhaps grouping more terms together.

Wait, if I group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6)\). Which is the entire expression, so 13.

Alternatively, group \( (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6\). Compute \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5\): 1+2=3, 3+3=6, 6-4=2, 2+5=7. Then, 7 +6=13.

Same.

Wait, maybe if I can group \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, then group \(-4 +5 +6\) as 7. So, 6 +7=13.

Wait, that's same as before.

Wait, perhaps if I can group in a way that a larger negative number is created, but I don't see how because 4 is the only negative term.

Wait, another thought: can I group multiple negative terms? But in the original expression, only 4 is negative.

Wait, unless I can make a group that includes multiple negative terms by grouping their negatives.

Wait, but the only negative term is 4. So, unless I can make a group that includes 4 and some other negative terms, but in the original expression, all other terms are positive.

So, unless I can make a group that flips the sign of some other term, but that's not allowed because the operators are fixed.

Wait, another idea: perhaps grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5 +6)\). But that would be \(6 -15= -9\), but as before, that would require changing the operator before 4 from + to -, which isn't allowed.

Wait, unless I can use parentheses in a way that effectively subtracts the entire group, regardless of the operator. But in reality, the operator before 4 is -, so you can't just group 4,5,6 as a group and subtract them without changing the operator.

Wait, perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I can think of the expression as 1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5 +6, and try to group some terms in the middle to subtract a larger number.

Wait, for example, group \(3 -4 +5\) as a group. Compute that: 3 -4= -1, -1 +5=4. Then, the expression becomes \(1 +2 +4 +6\). Compute that: 1+2=3, 3+4=7, 7+6=13.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group \(2 +3 -4\) as a group: 2+3=5, 5-4=1. Then, the expression is \(1 +1 +5 +6\). Compute that: 1+1=2, 2+5=7, 7+6=13.

Same.

Wait, perhaps grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as a group, which is 2, then group \(5 +6\) as 11, so 2 +11=13.

Same.

Wait, maybe if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2) + (3 -4) + (5 +6)\). Compute that: 3 + (-1) +11=13.

Same.

Wait, I'm going around in circles here. All groupings I try result in 13. So, maybe 13 is the minimum? But the problem says that we can change the value, so 13 isn't the answer.

Wait, but according to the example given, changing the parentheses can result in a different value, but not necessarily lower or higher. So, in the example, they changed it to 6 -9 +6=3. So, they changed the order of operations to get a smaller value.

So, perhaps I can find a way to make the value lower than 13.

Wait, here's another approach: can I make a negative number by grouping terms and then subtract that from the rest.

For example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, then group \(5 +6\) as 11, so 2 +11=13.

Alternatively, group \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, then group \(-4 +5 +6\) as 7, so 6 +7=13.

Wait, same.

Wait, but what if I can group in such a way that a part of the expression becomes negative and then subtract that negative.

Wait, like grouping \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, then group \(-4 +5 +6\) as 7, so 6 +7=13. Still same.

Wait, another idea: group the expression as \( (1 +2 +3 -4) + (5 +6)\), which is 2 +11=13.

Alternatively, group \( (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5 +6)\). But that would be 6 -15=-9, which is lower, but as before, that would require changing the operator before 4, which isn't allowed.

Wait, so maybe it's impossible to subtract a group that is a sum of positive numbers because that would require changing the operator before 4.

Wait, maybe if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \(1 + (2 +3 -4) +5 +6\). Compute that: 2 +3=5, 5 -4=1, so group is 1. Then, 1 +1 +5 +6=13.

Same.

Wait, perhaps grouping in a way that some terms are subtracted multiple times.

Wait, for example, group \(1 + (2 +3 -4) + (5 -6)\). But in the original expression, it's 5 +6, not 5 -6. So, can't do that.

Wait, unless I can flip the operator, which is not allowed.

Wait, another idea: Let me consider creating a larger negative number by grouping a segment that includes the subtraction of a larger positive number.

Wait, for example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2 +3) - (4 -5 -6)\). Let me compute that: 1+2+3=6, and 4 -5 -6= -7, so 6 - (-7)=13. But that would require changing the operator before 5 and 6, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, that's invalid.

Wait, so I'm starting to think that maybe 13 is actually the minimum value, and you can't get lower than that with the given constraints.

But the problem says that you can change the value, so 13 must not be the minimum. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I can group the expression in a way that subtracts a larger positive number.

Wait, for example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \(1 + (2 +3 -4 +5 +6)\). Compute that: 2 +3=5, 5 -4=1, 1 +5=6, 6 +6=12. So, 1 +12=13.

Same.

Alternatively, group \(1 +2 + (3 -4 +5 +6)\). Compute that: 3 -4=-1, -1 +5=4, 4 +6=10. So, 1 +2 +10=13.

Same.

Wait, so in all these cases, I can't seem to get lower than 13.

Wait, unless I can group the entire expression in a way that subtracts a larger number.

Wait, for example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5 +6)\). Which is 6 -15= -9. But in the original expression, the operator before 4 is -, so to group 4 +5 +6, you would have to change the operator before 4 from + to -, which is not allowed. So, that's invalid.

Wait, unless the problem allows us to assume that the entire expression is treated as a single group, but that doesn't make sense because the operations are fixed.

Wait, another thought: maybe if I can group all the terms except the first one as a group and subtract that.

For example, group \(2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as a group. Let's compute that: 2 +3=5, 5 -4=1, 1 +5=6, 6 +6=12. So, the expression becomes \(1 -12= -11\). Wait, that's lower than 13.

Wait, is that a valid grouping? Let me double-check.

Original expression: \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\).

If I can group \(2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as a group, the expression becomes \(1 + [2 +3 -4 +5 +6]\). So, 1 +12=13.

But if I can instead group \(2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as a group and subtract it from 1, that would be \(1 - [2 +3 -4 +5 +6]\). So, 1 -12= -11.

But in the original expression, the operations are fixed as +2, +3, -4, +5, +6. So, grouping \(2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as a single group would require that the operator before 2 is a +, which it is, but the operator before 4 is a -, which is already there.

Wait, hold on. The expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

If I group \(2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) together, it's equivalent to 1 + (2 +3 -4 +5 +6). Which is 1 +12=13.

Alternatively, is there a way to group it so that it subtracts the entire group?

Wait, for example, if I group \(2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as a group and place a minus sign before it, but in the original expression, that would require changing the operator before 2 from + to -, which isn't allowed.

Wait, because the original expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

If I try to group it as 1 - (2 +3 -4 +5 +6), that would require that the operator before 2 is a -, but in the original expression, it's a +, so that's not allowed.

Therefore, that approach isn't valid.

Wait, so in that case, grouping \(2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as a group is just 1 +12=13, same as before.

Wait, so in that case, that approach can't get us lower.

Wait, another idea: grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2 +3 -4) + (5 +6)\). Which is 2 +11=13.

Alternatively, \( (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5 +6)\). But that would be 6 -15=-9, but as before, requires changing the operator before 4, which is invalid.

Wait, is there a way to group terms in a way that a larger negative number is created by combining multiple negative terms?

Wait, but in the original expression, there's only one negative term, which is 4. So, unless I can make 4 negative by grouping, but that would require changing the operator before 4, which isn't allowed.

Wait, so perhaps 13 is the minimum. But the problem says that we can change the value, so 13 must not be the answer.

Wait, maybe I can group in a way that a positive group is subtracted multiple times.

Wait, for example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, then group \(-4 +5 +6\) as 7. So, 6 +7=13.

Alternatively, group \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, then group \(-4\) as -4, and then group \(5 +6\) as 11. So, 6 -4 +11=13.

Wait, same.

Wait, another idea: if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, and group \(5 -6\) as -1. So, 2 -1=1. But in the original expression, 5 is added, not subtracted. So, grouping \(5 -6\) would require changing the operator before 5 from + to -, which isn't allowed.

Hmm, so that's invalid.

Wait, maybe the key is to group multiple terms in such a way that a larger negative number is created.

Wait, for example, if I can group \( -4 +5 +6\) as a group, which is 7, then the expression becomes \(1 +2 +3 +7=13\).

Alternatively, grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \(1 +2 +3 + ( -4 +5 +6)\). Which is 6 +7=13.

Same.

Wait, is there a way to create a larger negative number by grouping? For example, if I can make a group that subtracts a larger positive number.

Wait, for example, grouping \(1 +2 +3 +4\) as 10, but that would require that 4 is positive, but in the original expression, 4 is subtracted. So, that would change the operator before 4 from - to +, which isn't allowed.

Wait, so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \(1 + (2 +3 -4) +5 +6\). Which is 1 +1 +5 +6=13.

Same.

Wait, another idea: grouping \(2 +3 -4\) as a group, which is 1, then grouping \(1 +5 +6\) as 12, so 1 +12=13.

Same result.

Wait, perhaps if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \(1 +2 + (3 -4) +5 +6\). Which is 1+2=3, 3-4=-1, -1 +5=4, 4 +6=10. Wait, 1 +2 + (3 -4) +5 +6 is 1 +2 + (-1) +5 +6=13.

Same.

Wait, so in all these cases, I can’t get a value lower than 13. Is there a different way?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I can group the expression such that a positive group is subtracted multiple times.

Wait, for example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, and then group \(-4\) as -4, and then group \(5 +6\) as 11, so 6 -4 +11=13.

Same as before.

Alternatively, grouping \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, then group \(-4 +5 +6\) as 7, so 6 +7=13.

Wait, same.

Wait, maybe if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, and then group \(5 +6\) as 11, so 2 +11=13.

Same.

Wait, is there a way to group terms so that a negative group is subtracted?

Wait, for example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, then group \(5 +6\) as 11, so 2 +11=13.

Same.

Wait, unless I can make a group that is negative and then subtract that from the rest.

Wait, for example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, then group \(-4 +5 +6\) as 7, so 6 +7=13.

Wait, same.

Wait, perhaps grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \(1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6)\). So, 1+2+3=6, 4+5+6=15, so 6 -15= -9. But in the original expression, operator before 4 is -, so the grouping \(4 +5 +6\) would require changing the operator before 4 from - to +, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, invalid.

Wait, another approach: if I can group terms such that a part of the expression becomes a negative number, and then subtract that negative number from the rest.

Wait, for example, group \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, then group \(5 +6\) as 11, so 2 +11=13.

Same.

Wait, group \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, then group \(-4 +5 +6\) as 7, so 6 +7=13.

Same.

Wait, maybe grouping \(2 +3 -4\) as 1, then grouping \(1 +5 +6\) as 12, so 1 +12=13.

Same.

Wait, I'm really not seeing a way to get lower than 13.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe if I can create a larger negative number by grouping multiple negative terms.

But the only negative term is 4. So, unless I can make 4 negative by grouping, but that would require changing the operator before 4, which isn't allowed.

Wait, is there a way to group \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, then group \(5 -6\) as -1, so 2 -1=1. But in the original expression, 5 is added, not subtracted. So, grouping \(5 -6\) would require changing the operator before 5 from + to -, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, that's invalid.

Wait, I'm starting to think that maybe 13 is actually the minimum possible value with the given constraints. But the problem says that we can change the value, so that must not be the case.

Wait, hold on. Maybe if I can group the expression in a way that a larger positive group is subtracted.

Wait, for example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, then group \(5 +6\) as 11, so 2 +11=13.

Alternatively, group \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, group \(-4 +5 +6\) as 7, so 6 +7=13.

Wait, same.

Wait, is there a way to group the expression so that a positive group is subtracted?

Wait, for example, \( (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5 +6)\). Which is 6 -15= -9, but that would require changing the operator before 4, which isn't allowed.

Wait, so that's invalid.

Wait, perhaps if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, and group \(5\) as 5, then group \(6\) as 6, so 2 +5 +6=13.

Same.

Wait, maybe grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2 +3) - (4) + (5 +6)\). Which is 6 -4 +11=13.

Same.

Wait, so I'm not seeing any way to change the value lower than 13. Therefore, maybe 13 is indeed the minimum.

But the problem says "If we add parentheses in various locations, we can change this value. For example, \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) is equivalent to \(1+2+3-4+5+6\). If we add parentheses as in \(1+2+3-(4+5)+6=1+2+3-9+6=3\). If we only add parentheses in various locations, what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain?"

Wait, in the example, they have \(1+2+3-(4+5)+6=3\). So, they grouped \(4 +5\) as a group, making it subtracted as a single group. So, the key was to group multiple terms into a group and subtract that group.

So, in the original expression, if I can group \(4 +5\) as a group, and subtract that group, then \(1 +2 +3 - (4 +5) +6\). So, 1+2+3=6, 4+5=9, so 6 -9= -3, then +6=3.

So, that's how they got 3.

So, in that case, we can group terms that are being subtracted or added in the original expression into larger groups, effectively changing the order of operations.

Therefore, perhaps in our problem, we can do similar things.

So, in the original expression: \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\).

We can group \(4 +5\) into a group, subtract that group, and get 1+2+3 -9 +6=3.

Similarly, we can group \(4 +5 +6\) as a group, but in the original expression, the operator before 4 is -, so grouping \(4 +5 +6\) would require changing the operator before 4, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, group \(3 -4\) as a group, then add 5 +6.

So, \(1 +2 + (3 -4) +5 +6\). Compute that: 1+2=3, 3 -4= -1, -1 +5=4, 4 +6=10. So, total is 10.

Alternatively, group \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, then group \(-4 +5 +6\) as 7, so 6 +7=13.

But in the example, they grouped \(4 +5\) as a group, subtracted that, so 1+2+3 -9 +6=3.

So, that approach gave a lower value.

So, perhaps the key is to group as many subtracted terms as possible into a single group, thereby reducing the total.

Wait, in the example, they grouped \(4 +5\) as a group, making it subtracted as a single group.

In our problem, we can group \(4 +5 +6\) as a group, but in the original expression, it's subtracted only 4, then added 5 and 6.

So, grouping \(4 +5 +6\) would mean that we subtract that entire group, so \(1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6)\). Which is 1+2+3=6, 4+5+6=15, so 6 -15= -9, which is lower than 13.

But wait, in the original expression, 5 and 6 are added, so grouping them as part of the group before 4 would require changing the operator before 4, which isn't allowed. So, that grouping isn't valid.

Wait, so in the original expression, the operator before 4 is -, so you can't just group 4 +5 +6 as a single group because in the original expression, 5 and 6 are being added after 4.

Therefore, grouping \(4 +5 +6\) as a group would require that the operator before 5 is a +, which isn't allowed if we want to group 4 +5 +6.

Wait, unless we can somehow flip the operator before 5, but that's not allowed as per the problem statement.

Therefore, in the original expression, we can't group \(4 +5 +6\) as a single group because that would require changing the operator before 5, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, the only way to group is by grouping terms that are adjacent with their original operators.

So, in the example, they grouped \(4 +5\) as a group, which is allowed because 4 and 5 are adjacent with a + operator. Then, subtracted that group.

Similarly, in our problem, if we can group \(4 +5\) as a group, subtract that group, then the expression becomes \(1 +2 +3 - (4 +5) +6\), which is 1+2+3=6, 4+5=9, so 6 -9= -3, then +6=3.

So, that gives us a lower value.

But in the original expression, 5 is added after 4, so grouping \(4 +5\) as a group is allowed because they're adjacent.

Similarly, grouping \(1 +2 +3\) as a group is allowed because they're adjacent.

Grouping \(5 +6\) as a group is allowed, but in the original expression, 5 is added and 6 is added, so grouping \(5 +6\) as a group is allowed, but that just gives 11, so 1 +2 +3 -4 +11=13.

Wait, so in that case, grouping terms in the middle.

Wait, so perhaps the key is that in the original expression, 4 is a subtraction operator, so we can group terms after 4 as a group and subtract them.

So, for example, grouping \(4 +5 +6\) as a group, but in the original expression, 4 is subtracted, 5 and 6 are added. So, grouping \(4 +5 +6\) would mean 4 is subtracted and 5 and 6 are subtracted as well, which would be 4 -5 -6, which is different.

Wait, but in the original expression, the 5 and 6 are added. So, grouping \(4 +5 +6\) would require that 5 and 6 are subtracted, which changes their operator, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, in the original expression, you can only group terms that are adjacent with their original operators.

Therefore, to subtract a group that includes 4, you have to group 4 with the terms that follow it, but in the original expression, 4 is subtracted, and 5 and 6 are added.

Therefore, grouping \(4 +5 +6\) as a group would change their operators, which isn't allowed.

Wait, so only grouping terms that are added or subtracted without changing the operator is allowed.

Therefore, the only way to subtract a group is if that group starts with a subtraction operator.

But in the original expression, the only subtraction operator is before 4. So, any group that includes 4 must start with a subtraction operator.

But in the original expression, 4 is a single term with a subtraction operator before it.

So, for example, grouping \(4 +5 +6\) as a group, but that would require the operator before 4 to be a +, which it isn't. So, that's invalid.

Therefore, the only way is to group 4 with the terms that follow it, but as a subtraction.

Wait, for example, grouping \(4 -5 -6\) as a group, but in the original expression, 5 and 6 are added, so grouping \(4 -5 -6\) would change their operators from + to -, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, grouping is only allowed where the operator is already there.

Therefore, in the original expression, we can't group 4 with 5 and 6 as a subtraction group because that would require changing their operators.

Therefore, the only way is to group 4 as a single term, subtract it, and group other terms as additions.

Therefore, in that case, the minimum value is 13.

But the problem says we can change the value. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe if I can group the expression so that a larger positive group is subtracted.

Wait, for example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2 +3) - (4 -5 -6)\). But in the original expression, 5 and 6 are added, so grouping \(4 -5 -6\) would change their operators, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, invalid.

Wait, another thought: perhaps grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as a group, which is 2, and then group \(5 +6\) as 11, so 2 +11=13.

Same.

Wait, or grouping \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, then group \(-4 +5 +6\) as 7, so 6 +7=13.

Same.

Wait, unless I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \(1 +2 +3 + (-4 +5 +6)\). Which is 1 +2 +3 +7=13.

Same.

Wait, so all groupings result in 13.

But the problem says that we can change the value. So, perhaps 13 is not the minimum.

Wait, maybe I can use associativity or something?

Wait, for example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \(1 + (2 +3 -4) +5 +6\). Which is 1 +1 +5 +6=13.

Same.

Wait, or \(1 +2 + (3 -4 +5 +6)\). Which is 1 +2 +10=13.

Same.

Wait, same as before.

Wait, perhaps grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \(1 +2 + (3 -4) +5 +6\). Compute that: 1 +2=3, 3 -4=-1, -1 +5=4, 4 +6=10. Wait, that's 10.

Wait, is that correct?

Let me compute step by step:

Original expression: 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

If I group \(3 -4\) as a group: 3 -4=-1.

So, the expression becomes: 1 +2 + (-1) +5 +6.

Compute that: 1 +2=3, 3 + (-1)=2, 2 +5=7, 7 +6=13.

Wait, same.

Wait, but if I group \(3 -4 +5 +6\) as a group, but in the original expression, that would require that 5 and 6 are inside the group, but the operator before 5 is +, so as long as I group them, it's allowed.

Wait, but earlier, when I tried grouping \(3 -4 +5 +6\) as a group, that was 10, but when I actually compute the expression step by step, it's 13.

Wait, so in that case, perhaps I can't just group \(3 -4 +5 +6\) as a single group because the rest of the expression is still there.

Wait, actually, the expression is 1 +2 + (3 -4) +5 +6. So, that is 1 +2 + (-1) +5 +6=13.

But if I group \(3 -4 +5 +6\) as a group, then it's 3 -4 +5 +6=10, but the rest of the expression is 1 +2 +10=13.

Wait, same.

So, in that case, I don't think I can get a lower value.

Wait, unless I can group in a way that subtracts a larger group from a smaller one.

Wait, for example, if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, and then group \(5\) as 5, and group \(6\) as 6, so 2 +5 +6=13.

Same.

Wait, unless I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5\) as 1 +2 +3 -4 +5=7, and then subtract 6, so 7 -6=1.

But in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. So, grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5\) as a group and then subtracting 6 would require that the 6 is subtracted, but in the original expression, it's added. So, grouping \(6\) as a separate term is allowed, but grouping it as a part of the group would require changing the operator before it from + to -, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, that grouping isn't valid.

Wait, so in conclusion, it seems that no matter how I group the terms in the original expression, I can't get a value lower than 13. Therefore, 13 is the minimum possible value. But the problem says that we can change the value, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let me try to think differently. Maybe if I can group the entire expression except for the last term as a group and subtract that group from the last term.

Wait, for example, group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as a group, which is 13, and then subtract that from 0? But that doesn't make sense because the original expression is 13.

Alternatively, group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5\) as a group, which is 7, and then subtract 6, which is 1. But in the original expression, 6 is added, so grouping \(6\) as a separate term is allowed, but grouping it as part of the group before would require changing the operator before it, which isn't allowed.

Wait, so that approach isn't valid.

Wait, another idea: if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2 +3 -4) + (5 +6)\). Which is 2 +11=13.

Same.

Wait, or group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \(1 + (2 +3 -4) + (5 +6)\). Which is 1 +1 +11=13.

Same.

Wait, perhaps grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5) +6\). So, 6 -9 +6=3.

Wait, that's the example given. So, in that case, we grouped \(4 +5\) as a group, subtracted that group, and then added 6.

So, that gave us 3.

So, in that case, we can get 3, which is lower than 13.

So, how did that work?

In that case, we grouped \(4 +5\) as a group, subtracted that, so that was 9, then added 6.

So, 1+2+3=6, 6 -9= -3, -3 +6=3.

So, that worked.

So, in that case, perhaps grouping other parts as well.

Wait, so perhaps grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5) +6\), which is 6 -9 +6=3.

Similarly, grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6\), which is 7 +6=13.

So, in that case, 7 +6=13.

Alternatively, grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \(1 + (2 +3 -4 +5) +6\), which is 1 +8 +6=15.

Wait, same.

Wait, so the key is to group the terms such that a larger positive group is subtracted, thereby reducing the total.

So, in the example, grouping \(4 +5\) as a group subtracted 9, which is larger than grouping \(4\) as a single term.

Therefore, in the original problem, perhaps the key is to group as many terms as possible after 4 as a group and subtract that group.

But in the original expression, 4 is subtracted, so grouping 4 with the terms after it as a group would mean that 4 is subtracted, and the terms after it are subtracted as well, which changes their operators, which isn't allowed.

Wait, for example, grouping \(4 +5 +6\) as a group would mean subtracting 4, 5, and 6, which is 4 -5 -6= -7, which is different from the original.

But in the original expression, 5 and 6 are added, so grouping \(4 +5 +6\) would change their operators from + to -, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, we can only subtract the group \(4 +5\) as a group, which is 9, thereby reducing the total.

So, in that case, grouping \(4 +5\) as a group subtracted gives 1+2+3 -9 +6=3.

Similarly, in the original expression, if we can group \(3 -4\) as a group, subtracting that group would be 3 -4= -1, then adding 5 and 6.

So, grouping \(3 -4\) as a group, subtracting that group, and then adding 5 and 6.

Wait, let's compute that:

Group \(3 -4\) as a group: 3 -4= -1.

So, the expression becomes \(1 +2 + (-1) +5 +6\).

Compute that:

1 +2=3, 3 + (-1)=2, 2 +5=7, 7 +6=13.

Same.

Wait, so grouping \(3 -4\) as a group doesn't change the total.

Wait, but in the example, grouping \(4 +5\) as a group subtracted 9, which was a larger number, thereby reducing the total.

So, maybe the key is to group terms after a subtraction operator as a group and subtract that group.

In the original expression, 4 is subtracted, so grouping \(4 +5 +6\) as a group would subtract 4, 5, and 6, but that changes their operators, which isn't allowed. So, invalid.

But grouping \(4 +5\) as a group, subtracting 9, which is allowed because 5 is added, so grouping \(4 +5\) as a group subtracts 9, which is valid, and 6 is still added.

Wait, so in that case, the expression becomes \(1 +2 +3 -9 +6=3\).

So, that's how the example got 3.

Therefore, in our problem, perhaps the minimum possible value is 3.

Wait, but in the example, they only grouped \(4 +5\). So, maybe in our problem, we can group \(4 +5 +6\) as a group, but as we saw, that would require changing the operator before 5 and 6 from + to -, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, only grouping \(4 +5\) as a group is allowed, subtracting that group, and then adding 6.

Thus, resulting in 3.

So, is 3 the minimum possible value? Or can we get lower?

Wait, in the example, grouping \(4 +5\) gives 3. What if we group \(3 -4 +5 +6\) as a group? But as before, grouping \(3 -4 +5 +6\) as a group would require changing the operator before 5 and 6, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, grouping \(3 -4\) as a group, subtracting that group, then adding 5 and 6.

But as before, that doesn't change the total.

Wait, so only grouping \(4 +5\) as a group subtracts 9, which is the largest possible group after 4.

So, maybe 3 is the minimum possible value.

Wait, but in the expression \(1 +2 +3 -9 +6=3\), we can see that.

Alternatively, if we group \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, then group \(-4 +5 +6\) as 7, so 6 +7=13.

Same.

Wait, so 3 is lower.

Wait, but perhaps we can group multiple groups.

Wait, for example, group \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, then group \(5 +6\) as 11, so 2 +11=13.

Same.

Wait, unless we can group both \(3 -4\) and \(-4 +5\) as groups, but in the original expression, 4 is only subtracted once.

Wait, no, 4 is subtracted once.

Wait, perhaps grouping \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, and then grouping \(5 +6\) as 11, so 2 +11=13.

Same.

Wait, so unless we can group in a way that subtracts a larger group, the only way is to group \(4 +5\) as a group, subtracting 9.

So, in that case, 1+2+3 -9 +6=3.

Therefore, 3 is the minimal possible value.

Wait, but in that case, the grouping is done as follows: \(1 +2 +3 - (4 +5) +6\).

Which is allowed, as \(4 +5\) is a group, subtracted, and 6 is added separately.

Therefore, that gives 3.

Is there a way to get lower than 3?

Wait, if I can group more terms, but in the original expression, the only subtraction operator is before 4. So, any group that includes 4 must start with a subtraction operator.

So, the only way to group 4 is as part of a subtraction group.

So, grouping \(4 +5\) as a group, subtracted, gives 3.

Similarly, grouping \(4 +5 +6\) as a group, subtracted, would give 1+2+3 -15 +6=1+2+3=6, 6 -15=-9, -9 +6=-3.

But in the original expression, 5 and 6 are added, so grouping them as part of the group before 4 is invalid.

Wait, unless I can group \(4 +5 +6\) as a group, but in the original expression, 5 and 6 are added, so grouping them as part of the group before 4 would require that they are subtracted, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, that grouping isn't valid.

Wait, so in that case, the only way is to group \(4 +5\) as a group, subtracting that group, which gives 3.

So, 3 is the minimal possible value.

But wait, in the original problem, the expression is \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\). The example groups \(4 +5\) as a group, subtracting that group, so 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5) +6=3.

So, in that case, 3 is the minimum possible value.

Therefore, I think the minimum possible value is 3.

But let me just check.

Wait, if I group \(1 +2 +3\) as 6, then group \(-4 +5 +6\) as 7, so 6 +7=13.

Same.

Wait, if I group \(1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6\) as \( (1 +2 +3) - (4 -5 -6)\). But in the original expression, 5 and 6 are added, so grouping \(4 -5 -6\) would change their operators, which isn't allowed.

Therefore, invalid.

Wait, another thought: if I can group \(1 +2 +3 -4\) as 2, then group \(5\) as 5, then group \(6\) as 6, so 2 +5 +6=13.

Same.

Wait, same as before.

Wait, so, no matter how I group, the only way to get lower than 13 is to group \(4 +5\) as a group, subtracted, which gives 3.

So, 3 is the minimum possible value.

Therefore, I think the answer is 3.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
</think>

To find the minimum possible value of the expression \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\) by adding parentheses, we need to consider different ways to group the terms. 

First, we note that the expression evaluates to 13 without any parentheses. However, by strategically grouping terms, we can change the value of the expression.

One effective way to minimize the value is to group the terms after the subtraction of 4. Specifically, we can group \(4 + 5\) as a single group and subtract this group from the rest of the expression. This approach is allowed because the original expression already has a subtraction before 4, and grouping \(4 + 5\) as a group does not change the operators before 4, 5, or 6.

Here are the steps:

1. Start with the original expression: \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\).
2. Group \(4 + 5\) as a single group: \(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6\).
3. Evaluate the grouped expression:
   - Compute \(4 + 5 = 9\).
   - Substitute back into the expression: \(1 + 2 + 3 - 9 + 6\).
   - Compute step-by-step: \(1 + 2 = 3\), \(3 + 3 = 6\), \(6 - 9 = -3\), \(-3 + 6 = 3\).

Thus, the minimum possible value of the expression is \(\boxed{3}\).
