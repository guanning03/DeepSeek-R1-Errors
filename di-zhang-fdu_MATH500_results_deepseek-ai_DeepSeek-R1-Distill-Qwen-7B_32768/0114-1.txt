Question:
Find the roots of $(x - 3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.$

Correct Answer:
Let $a = x - 3$ and $b = x - 7.$  Then we can write the given equation as
\[a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3.\]Expanding, we get $a^3 + b^3 = a^3 + 3a^2 b + 3ab^2 + b^3,$ so $3a^2 b + 3ab^2 = 0,$ which factors as
\[3ab(a + b) = 0.\]Thus, $a = 0,$ $b = 0,$ or $a + b = 0.$  Then $x - 3 = 0,$ $x - 7 = 0,$ or $2x - 10 = 0.$  This gives us the roots $\boxed{3, 5, 7}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this equation to solve: \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\). Hmm, it looks a bit intimidating with all those cubes, but maybe I can simplify it somehow. Let me think about how to approach this.

First off, I notice that the right side is \((2x - 10)^3\). Wait a second, \(2x - 10\) is actually \(2(x - 5)\), right? So that can be rewritten as \(2^3(x - 5)^3\), which is \(8(x - 5)^3\). So, the equation becomes:

\[
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3
\]

Hmm, that might make things a bit easier. Now, I recall that sometimes when you have an equation like \(a^3 + b^3 = c^3\), especially if \(c\) is a multiple of \(a\) or \(b\), there might be a way to factor it or find a relationship between \(a\) and \(b\). Let me see if that applies here.

Wait, another thought: if I set \(a = x - 3\) and \(b = x - 7\), then \(c = 2x - 10\). Let me see if there's a relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Let's compute \(a + b\):

\[
a + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10
\]

Oh! That's exactly \(c\). So, \(a + b = c\). That's interesting. So, now my equation is:

\[
a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3
\]

Hmm, that rings a bell. I remember that \(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\). So, maybe I can use that identity to expand the left side.

Let me write that out:

\[
a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)
\]

So, substituting that into the original equation:

\[
(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (a + b)^3
\]

Hmm, so I can rewrite this as:

\[
(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) - (a + b)^3 = 0
\]

Factor out \((a + b)\):

\[
(a + b)[a^2 - ab + b^2 - (a + b)^2] = 0
\]

So, either \(a + b = 0\) or the expression in the brackets is zero. Let's consider both cases.

**Case 1: \(a + b = 0\)**

Since \(a + b = c = 2x - 10\), this case implies:

\[
2x - 10 = 0 \implies 2x = 10 \implies x = 5
\]

So, \(x = 5\) is one potential root. Let me verify if this works in the original equation.

Plugging \(x = 5\) into the left side:

\[
(5 - 3)^3 + (5 - 7)^3 = (2)^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 + (-8) = 0
\]

And the right side:

\[
(2*5 - 10)^3 = (10 - 10)^3 = 0^3 = 0
\]

So, both sides equal zero, which means \(x = 5\) is indeed a solution.

**Case 2: The expression in the brackets is zero**

Let's set the bracket equal to zero:

\[
a^2 - ab + b^2 - (a + b)^2 = 0
\]

First, expand \((a + b)^2\):

\[
(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
\]

So, substituting back in:

\[
a^2 - ab + b^2 - (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = 0
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
a^2 - ab + b^2 - a^2 - 2ab - b^2 = 0
\]

Combine like terms:

- \(a^2 - a^2 = 0\)
- \(-ab - 2ab = -3ab\)
- \(b^2 - b^2 = 0\)

So, the equation simplifies to:

\[
-3ab = 0
\]

Which means:

\[
ab = 0
\]

Since \(a = x - 3\) and \(b = x - 7\), this implies:

Either \(x - 3 = 0\) or \(x - 7 = 0\)

So, \(x = 3\) or \(x = 7\)

Therefore, the potential roots are \(x = 3\), \(x = 5\), and \(x = 7\). Let me check each of these in the original equation to make sure they actually work.

**Testing \(x = 3\):**

Left side:

\[
(3 - 3)^3 + (3 - 7)^3 = 0^3 + (-4)^3 = 0 + (-64) = -64
\]

Right side:

\[
(2*3 - 10)^3 = (6 - 10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64
\]

So, both sides are equal. \(x = 3\) is a valid root.

**Testing \(x = 5\):**

Already checked earlier, and it works. So, that's good.

**Testing \(x = 7\):**

Left side:

\[
(7 - 3)^3 + (7 - 7)^3 = 4^3 + 0^3 = 64 + 0 = 64
\]

Right side:

\[
(2*7 - 10)^3 = (14 - 10)^3 = 4^3 = 64
\]

Both sides equal 64, so \(x = 7\) is also a valid root.

Wait a minute, so we have three real roots: 3, 5, and 7. That's interesting because the original equation was a cubic, so it can have up to three real roots, which matches our findings.

But just to be thorough, let me think if there might be any other solutions. Since we factored the equation completely into linear terms, and found all three roots, I don't think there are any more solutions. The cubic equation is fully factored as \((x - 3)(x - 5)(x - 7) = 0\), so those are the only roots.

But just to make sure, let me consider expanding the original equation and see if it indeed simplifies to a cubic equation with these roots.

Starting with:

\[
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3
\]

Let me expand each term.

First, \((x - 3)^3\):

\[
(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27
\]

Second, \((x - 7)^3\):

\[
(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343
\]

Adding these together:

\[
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (x^3 + x^3) + (-9x^2 - 21x^2) + (27x + 147x) + (-27 - 343)
\]
\[
= 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370
\]

Now, expand the right side: \((2x - 10)^3\)

First, note that \((2x - 10)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3\), but let's expand it directly:

\[
(2x - 10)^3 = (2x)^3 - 3*(2x)^2*(10) + 3*(2x)*(10)^2 - (10)^3
\]
\[
= 8x^3 - 3*4x^2*10 + 3*2x*100 - 1000
\]
\[
= 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000
\]

So, now, set the left side equal to the right side:

\[
2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000
\]

Bring all terms to one side:

\[
2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 - 8x^3 + 120x^2 - 600x + 1000 = 0
\]

Combine like terms:

- \(2x^3 - 8x^3 = -6x^3\)
- \(-30x^2 + 120x^2 = 90x^2\)
- \(174x - 600x = -426x\)
- \(-370 + 1000 = 630\)

So, the equation simplifies to:

\[
-6x^3 + 90x^2 - 426x + 630 = 0
\]

Let me factor out a common factor first. I notice that all coefficients are divisible by -6:

\[
-6(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105) = 0
\]

Divide both sides by -6:

\[
x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0
\]

So, now we have the cubic equation:

\[
x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0
\]

Let me check if \(x = 3\), \(x = 5\), and \(x = 7\) are roots here.

**Testing \(x = 3\):**

\[
3^3 - 15*3^2 + 71*3 - 105 = 27 - 135 + 213 - 105
\]
\[
= (27 - 135) + (213 - 105)
\]
\[
= (-108) + (108) = 0
\]

So, \(x = 3\) is a root.

**Testing \(x = 5\):**

\[
5^3 - 15*5^2 + 71*5 - 105 = 125 - 375 + 355 - 105
\]
\[
= (125 - 375) + (355 - 105)
\]
\[
= (-250) + (250) = 0
\]

Good, \(x = 5\) is a root.

**Testing \(x = 7\):**

\[
7^3 - 15*7^2 + 71*7 - 105 = 343 - 735 + 497 - 105
\]
\[
= (343 - 735) + (497 - 105)
\]
\[
= (-392) + (392) = 0
\]

Perfect, \(x = 7\) is also a root.

So, the cubic factors as \((x - 3)(x - 5)(x - 7) = 0\), giving roots at 3, 5, and 7, which matches what I found earlier. Therefore, all three are indeed roots of the original equation.

Just to wrap up, I started by noticing a relationship between the terms in the equation, recognized a pattern that allowed me to factor it, and then confirmed by expanding everything out and verifying the roots. This makes me confident that I haven't missed any solutions, and the roots are correct.

**Final Answer**
The roots are \(\boxed{3}\), \(\boxed{5}\), and \(\boxed{7}\).
</think>

Given the equation \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\), we start by rewriting the right-hand side:

\[
(2x - 10)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3
\]

Let \(a = x - 3\) and \(b = x - 7\). Then, we have \(a + b = 2x - 10\), which is the same as \(2(x - 5)\). This means our equation can be rewritten using the identity \(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3\) if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(a\) or \(b\).

Using the identity \(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\), we rewrite the equation:

\[
(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (a + b)^3
\]

Factoring out \((a + b)\):

\[
(a + b)[a^2 - ab + b^2 - (a + b)^2] = 0
\]

This gives us two cases:

1. \(a + b = 0\)
2. \(a^2 - ab + b^2 - (a + b)^2 = 0\)

**Case 1: \(a + b = 0\)**

\[
2x - 10 = 0 \implies x = 5
\]

**Case 2: \(a^2 - ab + b^2 - (a + b)^2 = 0\)**

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
a^2 - ab + b^2 - (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = 0 \implies -3ab = 0 \implies ab = 0
\]

Since \(a = x - 3\) and \(b = x - 7\), this gives us \(x = 3\) or \(x = 7\).

We verify all potential roots \(x = 3\), \(x = 5\), and \(x = 7\) in the original equation and find that they all satisfy it.

Thus, the roots of the equation are:

\[
\boxed{3}, \boxed{5}, \boxed{7}
\]
