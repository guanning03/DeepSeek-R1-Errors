Question:
Find all solutions to
\[\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
Since $\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} x$ for all $x,$ we can write
\[\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} x \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]Let $\theta = \tan^{-1} x,$ so $x = \tan \theta.$  Also, $\sin 2 \theta = \frac{1}{3},$ so
\[2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \frac{1}{3}.\]Construct a right triangle with legs 1 and $x.$  Then the angle opposite the side length $x$ be $\theta.$

[asy]
unitsize(1 cm);

pair A, B, C;

A = (2,1.8);
B = (0,0);
C = (2,0);

draw(A--B--C--cycle);
draw(rightanglemark(A,C,B,8));

label("$\theta$", B + (0.7,0.3));
label("$1$", (B + C)/2, S);
label("$x$", (A + C)/2, E);
label("$\sqrt{x^2 + 1}$", (A + B)/2, NW);
[/asy]

Also, the hypotenuse will be $\sqrt{x^2 + 1},$ so $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}$ and $\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}.$  Hence,
\[2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = \frac{1}{3},\]or
\[\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}.\]This gives us $x^2 + 1 = 6x,$ or $x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula, the roots are $x = \boxed{3 \pm 2 \sqrt{2}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I've got this trigonometric equation to solve: \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First off, I remember that \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) are inverse trigonometric functions. I also recall that \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) is related to \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) because \(\cot^{-1}(x) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) when \(x > 0\). Wait, is that always true? Let me think. I think that's correct, but only when \(x\) is positive. If \(x\) is negative, there might be a shift by \(\pi\) or something? Hmm, maybe I should verify that later. For now, let's assume \(x\) is positive.

So, substituting that into the equation, we have:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Hmm, that simplifies the expression a bit. Now, I also remember that \(\tan^{-1}(a) + \tan^{-1}(b)\) has a formula, which is \(\tan^{-1}(a) + \tan^{-1}(b) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{a + b}{1 - ab}\right)\), but that's only when \(ab < 1\). Wait, in this case, \(a = x\) and \(b = \frac{1}{x}\), so \(ab = 1\). Oh, so when \(ab = 1\), the formula doesn't directly apply because it would lead to division by zero. Maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, I remember that \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\). Is that true? Let me test it with a specific value. Let's say \(x = 1\), then \(\tan^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}\), and \(\cot^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}\), so their sum is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Okay, that works. What about \(x = \sqrt{3}\)? \(\tan^{-1}(\sqrt{3}) = \frac{\pi}{3}\), and \(\cot^{-1}(\sqrt{3}) = \frac{\pi}{6}\), so their sum is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Yeah, that seems consistent. So, in general, \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\).

But in our problem, it's \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). Is that the same as \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x)\)? Because \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If \(y = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), then \(\cot(y) = \frac{1}{x}\), which implies \(\tan(y) = x\). So, yes, \(y = \tan^{-1}(x)\). So, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so that expression becomes \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) = 2\tan^{-1}(x)\). So, the original equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin(2\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Alright, so now we have to solve \(\sin(2\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\). Let's denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then, \(x = \tan(\theta)\), and the equation becomes:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

I know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta\). So, substituting that in:

\[
2\sin\theta\cos\theta = \frac{1}{3}
\]

But since \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), we can express \(\sin\theta\) and \(\cos\theta\) in terms of \(x\). Let me recall that if \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then we can imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is \(x\) and the adjacent side is 1, so the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\).

Therefore,

\[
\sin\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}, \quad \cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}
\]

Plugging these into the equation:

\[
2 \times \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:

\[
2 \times \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

So,

\[
\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Cross-multiplying:

\[
6x = x^2 + 1
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]

Now, we have a quadratic equation. Let's solve for \(x\) using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(6)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 1}}{2 \times 1} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2}
\]

Simplify \(\sqrt{32}\):

\[
\sqrt{32} = \sqrt{16 \times 2} = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

So,

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]

Hmm, so the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). But wait, I need to check if these solutions are valid in the original equation because sometimes when dealing with inverse trigonometric functions, we might introduce extraneous solutions.

So, let's check both solutions.

First, \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). Since \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is positive, we can plug it back into the original functions.

Similarly, \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Let's calculate the approximate value to see if it's positive or negative. \(2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828\), so \(3 - 2.828 \approx 0.172\), which is positive. So, both solutions are positive, so they are within the domain where \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\) holds true. So, both solutions should be valid.

Let me verify \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\):

Compute \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). Since \(x\) is positive, this is equal to \(2\tan^{-1}(x)\). Then, \(\sin(2\tan^{-1}(x))\). We know that \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\), so let's compute \(\tan^{-1}(x)\). Hmm, alternatively, since we know that \(2\tan^{-1}(x) = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\), so taking sine of both sides, \(\sin(2\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\), which is consistent. So, the solution is valid.

Similarly, for \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\), same reasoning applies. So, both are valid.

Therefore, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

Just to recap:

1. Recognized that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\).
2. Simplified the expression inside the sine function to \(2\tan^{-1}(x)\).
3. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so the equation became \(\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}\).
4. Expressed \(\sin(2\theta)\) in terms of \(\sin\theta\) and \(\cos\theta\), which are in terms of \(x\).
5. Derived a quadratic equation in \(x\), solved it, and found two solutions.
6. Verified both solutions are positive, hence valid.

So, I think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, so I feel confident about the solutions.

**Final Answer**
The solutions are \(\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}\) and \(\boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}\).
</think>

To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by recognizing that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This allows us to simplify the expression inside the sine function:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \sin(2\tan^{-1}(x))
\]

Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then, the equation becomes:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Using the double-angle identity for sine, we have:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Since \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), we know that \(\sin\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\). Substituting these into the equation gives:

\[
2 \times \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Cross-multiplying and rearranging terms, we obtain the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]

Both solutions \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) are positive, so they are valid. Therefore, the solutions are:

\[
\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}
\]
