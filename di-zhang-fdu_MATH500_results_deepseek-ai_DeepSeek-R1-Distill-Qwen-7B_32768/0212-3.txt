Question:
Find all solutions to
\[\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
Since $\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} x$ for all $x,$ we can write
\[\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} x \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]Let $\theta = \tan^{-1} x,$ so $x = \tan \theta.$  Also, $\sin 2 \theta = \frac{1}{3},$ so
\[2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \frac{1}{3}.\]Construct a right triangle with legs 1 and $x.$  Then the angle opposite the side length $x$ be $\theta.$

A = (2,1.8);
B = (0,0);
C = (2,0);

label("$1$", (B + C)/2, S);
label("$x$", (A + C)/2, E);
label("$\sqrt{x^2 + 1}$", (A + B)/2, NW);
[/asy]

Also, the hypotenuse will be $\sqrt{x^2 + 1},$ so $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}$ and $\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}.$  Hence,
\[2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = \frac{1}{3},\]or
\[\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}.\]This gives us $x^2 + 1 = 6x,$ or $x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula, the roots are $x = \boxed{3 \pm 2 \sqrt{2}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this equation to solve: \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). Hmm, it's a bit complicated with inverse trigonometric functions inside a sine function. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that \(\cot^{-1}(y)\) is the same as \(\tan^{-1}(1/y)\). So, maybe I can rewrite the equation to make it simpler. Let me see: \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) is equal to \(\tan^{-1}(x)\), right? Because if I let \(y = \frac{1}{x}\), then \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \tan^{-1}(1/y)\), which is \(\tan^{-1}(x)\). So that simplifies the equation a bit.

So now, the equation becomes: \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). Wait, that's \(\sin(2 \cdot \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\). Hmm, okay, so it's the sine of twice the arctangent of x equals 1/3.

I remember that there's a double-angle formula for sine. Specifically, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin\theta \cos\theta\). Maybe I can use that here. Let me set \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin\theta \cos\theta\). So, substituting back, this becomes \(2\sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\).

Now, I need to figure out what \(\sin(\tan^{-1}(x))\) and \(\cos(\tan^{-1}(x))\) are. Let me think about this. If \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\tan\theta = x\). I can represent this on a right triangle where the opposite side is x and the adjacent side is 1, so the hypotenuse would be \(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\).

Therefore, \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\).

So, substituting these back into the equation, we get:

\(2 \times \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} = \frac{1}{3}\).

Simplifying the left side, the denominators multiply to give \(1 + x^2\), so:

\(2 \times \frac{x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}\).

That simplifies to:

\(\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}\).

Now, let's cross-multiply to solve for x:

\(2x \times 3 = 1 \times (1 + x^2)\).

Which is:

\(6x = 1 + x^2\).

Let me rearrange this equation to standard quadratic form:

\(x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0\).

Alright, now we have a quadratic equation: \(x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0\). To solve this, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where a = 1, b = -6, and c = 1.

Plugging in those values:

\(x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 1}}{2 \times 1}\).

Simplify the numerator:

\(x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2}\).

Which is:

\(x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2}\).

Simplify \(\sqrt{32}\). Since 32 is 16 times 2, \(\sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\).

So, substituting back in:

\(x = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

We can simplify this further by dividing numerator and denominator by 2:

\(x = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\).

Okay, so the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

But wait, I need to make sure that these solutions are valid in the original equation because sometimes when dealing with inverse trigonometric functions, there might be domain or range restrictions.

Let me check each solution.

First, \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). Since \(2\sqrt{2}\) is approximately 2.828, so 3 + 2.828 is approximately 5.828. That's a positive number, so \(\tan^{-1}(5.828)\) is defined, as is \(\cot^{-1}(1/5.828)\), which is also defined because 1/x is positive.

Similarly, \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Let's compute that: \(2\sqrt{2}\) is approximately 2.828, so 3 - 2.828 is approximately 0.172. That's still positive, so both \(\tan^{-1}(0.172)\) and \(\cot^{-1}(1/0.172)\) are defined. 1/0.172 is approximately 5.814, which is positive, so everything is fine.

Therefore, both solutions are valid.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me verify the original equation with both solutions.

First, let’s test \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\).

Compute \(\tan^{-1}(x)\). Let me denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\). Then, \(\tan\theta = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\).

Similarly, \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\). Since \(1/x = 1/(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\). Let me rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\):

\(\frac{1}{3 + 2\sqrt{2}} \times \frac{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}{3 - 2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}{9 - 8} = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

So, \(\cot^{-1}(1/x) = \cot^{-1}(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\). But \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \tan^{-1}(1/y)\), so that's \(\tan^{-1}(1/(3 - 2\sqrt{2}))\). Wait, let's compute that.

Again, \(1/(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\). Multiply numerator and denominator by \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\):

\(\frac{1}{3 - 2\sqrt{2}} \times \frac{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}{3 + 2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}{9 - 8} = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\).

So, \(\cot^{-1}(1/x) = \tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\). Therefore, the original expression inside the sine becomes:

\(\tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2}) + \tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2}) = 2 \tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\).

So, we have \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2}))\).

Let me compute \(2 \tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\). Let’s denote \(\phi = \tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\), so \(\tan\phi = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). Then, \(\sin(2\phi) = 2 \sin\phi \cos\phi\).

From earlier, for a right triangle with opposite side \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and adjacent side 1, hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{1 + (3 + 2\sqrt{2})^2}\).

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me compute \((3 + 2\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 + 12\sqrt{2} + 8 = 17 + 12\sqrt{2}\). So, the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{1 + 17 + 12\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{18 + 12\sqrt{2}}\).

Simplify \(\sqrt{18 + 12\sqrt{2}}\). Hmm, maybe express it as \(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}\). Let's see:

Suppose \(\sqrt{18 + 12\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}\). Then, squaring both sides:

18 + 12\sqrt{2} = a + b + 2\sqrt{ab}\).

Therefore, we have:

a + b = 18,

2\sqrt{ab} = 12\sqrt{2} => \sqrt{ab} = 6\sqrt{2} => ab = 72.

So, we need two numbers a and b such that a + b = 18 and ab = 72. Let me solve this system.

From a + b = 18, express b = 18 - a. Then, ab = a(18 - a) = 72.

So, 18a - a^2 = 72.

Rearranged: a^2 -18a +72=0.

Solving quadratic: a = [18 ± sqrt(324 - 288)]/2 = [18 ± sqrt(36)]/2 = [18 ±6]/2.

So, a = (18 +6)/2=24/2=12, or a=(18-6)/2=12/2=6.

Therefore, a=12, b=6 or a=6, b=12.

So, \(\sqrt{18 + 12\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{12} + \sqrt{6} = 2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6}\).

Wait, actually, sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), and sqrt(6) is sqrt(6). But let me check: (sqrt(12) + sqrt(6))^2 = 12 + 6 + 2*sqrt(72) = 18 + 2*6*sqrt(2) = 18 + 12*sqrt(2). Yes, that's correct.

So, the hypotenuse is \(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6}\).

Therefore, \(\sin\phi = \frac{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6}}\).

Similarly, \(\cos\phi = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6}}\).

So, \(\sin(2\phi) = 2 \times \sin\phi \times \cos\phi\).

Compute numerator: 2*(3 + 2√2)*(1) = 2*(3 + 2√2).

Denominator: (2√3 + √6)^2.

Compute denominator: (2√3)^2 + 2*(2√3)*(√6) + (√6)^2 = 12 + 4*sqrt(18) + 6 = 18 + 4*3*sqrt(2) = 18 + 12√2.

So, \(\sin(2\phi) = \frac{2*(3 + 2√2)}{18 + 12√2}\).

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2*(3 + 2√2).

Denominator: 6*(3 + 2√2).

So, \(\sin(2\phi) = \frac{2*(3 + 2√2)}{6*(3 + 2√2)} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\).

Perfect, that's exactly what the equation states. So, x = 3 + 2√2 is a valid solution.

Now, let's check the other solution, x = 3 - 2√2.

Similarly, let me denote \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\), which is approximately 0.172 as I computed earlier. Let me compute \(\tan^{-1}(x)\), which is \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\). Then, \(\tan\theta = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

Similarly, \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\). Since \(1/x = 1/(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\). Let's rationalize the denominator:

\(1/(3 - 2\sqrt{2}) \times (3 + 2\sqrt{2})/(3 + 2\sqrt{2}) = (3 + 2\sqrt{2})/(9 - 8) = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\).

Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}(1/x) = \cot^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2}) = \tan^{-1}(1/(3 + 2\sqrt{2}))\).

Again, compute \(1/(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\):

Multiply numerator and denominator by \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\):

\(1/(3 + 2\sqrt{2}) \times (3 - 2\sqrt{2})/(3 - 2\sqrt{2}) = (3 - 2\sqrt{2})/(9 - 8) = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}(1/x) = \tan^{-1}(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\).

So, the argument inside the sine in the original equation becomes:

\(\tan^{-1}(3 - 2\sqrt{2}) + \tan^{-1}(3 - 2\sqrt{2}) = 2 \tan^{-1}(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\).

Let me denote \(\phi = \tan^{-1}(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\), so \(\tan\phi = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Then, using the same approach as before, we can compute \(\sin(2\phi)\).

Again, using the right triangle approach, with opposite side 3 - 2√2, adjacent side 1, hypotenuse \(\sqrt{1 + (3 - 2\sqrt{2})^2}\).

Compute \((3 - 2\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 - 12\sqrt{2} + 8 = 17 - 12\sqrt{2}\). So, hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{1 + 17 - 12\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{18 - 12\sqrt{2}}\).

Similarly, as before, express \(\sqrt{18 - 12\sqrt{2}}\) as \(\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b}\). Then, squaring both sides:

18 - 12√2 = a + b - 2√(ab).

Therefore:

a + b = 18,

-2√(ab) = -12√2 => √(ab) = 6√2 => ab = 72.

Same as before, so the numbers are 12 and 6.

Thus, \(\sqrt{18 - 12\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{12} - \sqrt{6} = 2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{6}\).

So, \(\sin\phi = \frac{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{6}}\).

Similarly, \(\cos\phi = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{6}}\).

Compute \(\sin(2\phi) = 2 \sin\phi \cos\phi\).

Compute numerator: 2*(3 - 2√2)*1 = 2*(3 - 2√2).

Denominator: \((2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{6})^2\).

Compute denominator:

(2√3)^2 + (-√6)^2 + 2*(2√3)*(-√6) = 12 + 6 - 4*sqrt(18) = 18 - 12√2.

So, \(\sin(2\phi) = \frac{2*(3 - 2√2)}{18 - 12√2}\).

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2*(3 - 2√2).

Denominator: 6*(3 - 2√2).

Thus, \(\sin(2\phi) = \frac{2*(3 - 2√2)}{6*(3 - 2√2)} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\).

Perfect, so x = 3 - 2√2 is also a valid solution.

Therefore, both solutions satisfy the original equation.

Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's recap the steps:

1. Recognized that \(\cot^{-1}(1/x) = \tan^{-1}(x)\).
2. Thus, the equation simplifies to \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = 1/3\).
3. Used the identity for sine of double angle, leading to an equation in terms of x.
4. Transformed into a quadratic equation, solved it, got two solutions.
5. Verified each solution by plugging back into the original equation, using right triangle relationships and simplifying.

Everything seems to check out. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. So, I think the solutions are correct.

**Final Answer**
The solutions are \(\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}\) and \(\boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}\).
</think>

Given the equation:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

we start by recognizing that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This simplifies the equation to:

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Using the double-angle identity for sine, we let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so the equation becomes:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin\theta \cos\theta.
\]

We know that \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:

\[
2 \times \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Simplifying, this becomes:

\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
6x = 1 + x^2,
\]

which rearranges to the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) with \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\), we find:

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

We verify that both solutions \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) are valid by checking that they satisfy the original equation. Both solutions are valid as they result in the correct value of \(\frac{1}{3}\) when substituted back into the equation.

Thus, the solutions are:

\[
\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}} \text{ and } \boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}.
\]
