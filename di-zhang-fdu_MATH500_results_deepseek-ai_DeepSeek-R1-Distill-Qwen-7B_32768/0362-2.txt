Question:
What is the total surface area, in square inches, of a cube with a volume of $1$ cubic foot?

Correct Answer:
Recall that  $$1 \mbox{ foot} = 12 \mbox{ inches}$$

Hence $$1 \mbox{ foot}^2 = 12^2 \mbox{ inches}^2 = 144 \mbox{ inches}^2$$

Finally, remember the formula $V = l \times w \times h$, that is, Volume is the product of length, width, and height.

The length, height, and width for a cube are equal, so the cube we are given has sides of length $1 \mbox{ feet}$. Now, a cube has 6 faces, so the surface area of our cube is $$6 \times (1 \mbox{ foot} \times 1 \mbox{ foot}) = 6 \mbox{ feet}^2$$

Now, convert: $$ 6 \mbox{ feet}^2 \frac{144 \mbox{ inches}^2}{1 \mbox{ foot}^2} = 864 \mbox{ inches}^2$$

So, our final answer is $\boxed{864 \mbox{ inches}^2}$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: "What is the total surface area, in square inches, of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot?" Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step. I need to find the surface area of a cube, but first, I have to figure out the side length from the given volume. 

Wait, the volume is given in cubic feet, and the surface area needs to be in square inches. I remember that when dealing with different units, I have to convert them appropriately. So, let's start with the volume.

The volume of a cube is calculated by side length cubed, right? So, if the volume is 1 cubic foot, then the side length must be 1 foot because 1 foot times 1 foot times 1 foot is 1 cubic foot. That makes sense. So, the cube has sides of 1 foot each.

But hold on, the question asks for the surface area in square inches. I need to convert the side length from feet to inches. I remember that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, if each side is 1 foot, that's equivalent to 12 inches. So, the side length of the cube is 12 inches.

Now, surface area of a cube. A cube has 6 faces, right? Each face is a square, and the area of one face is side length squared. So, the surface area should be 6 times the area of one face. 

Let me write that down. The area of one face is (12 inches)^2, which is 12 times 12. Hmm, 12 squared is 144, so each face is 144 square inches. Then, multiplying that by 6 to get the total surface area: 144 times 6.

Let me calculate that. 144 times 6... Well, 100 times 6 is 600, 40 times 6 is 240, and 4 times 6 is 24. So, adding those together: 600 plus 240 is 840, plus 24 is 864. So, 144 times 6 is 864. Therefore, the total surface area is 864 square inches.

Wait, just to double-check my steps: started with volume 1 cubic foot, converted that to side length 1 foot, converted that to 12 inches, then calculated the area of one face as 12 squared, which is 144, multiplied by 6 for all faces, getting 864. Seems solid.

But let me think again: is there another way to approach this? Maybe by converting cubic feet to cubic inches first and then finding the side length in inches?

Wait, hold on. Volume in cubic feet is 1, but if I want to work entirely in inches, I can convert 1 cubic foot to cubic inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, then 1 cubic foot is 12 inches times 12 inches times 12 inches, which is 1728 cubic inches. So, volume is 1728 cubic inches.

But the volume of a cube is also side length cubed, so side length is cube root of 1728. Hmm, what's the cube root of 1728? I remember that 12 times 12 times 12 is 1728, so the side length is 12 inches, which matches what I had before. So, that's consistent.

Then, surface area. Each face is 12 inches by 12 inches, so 144 square inches per face, times 6 is 864 square inches. Yep, same answer. So, that seems to confirm that 864 is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it in different units. Let's see, 1 foot is 12 inches, so 1 cubic foot is 12^3 cubic inches, which is 1728 cubic inches. So, if the volume is 1728 cubic inches, the side length is the cube root of that, which is 12 inches. So, same as before.

So, surface area is 6 times (12 inches)^2, which is 6 x 144 square inches, which is 864 square inches. So, I think that's correct.

Just to recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors:

1. Volume of cube = 1 cubic foot.
2. Since volume is side^3, side = 1 foot = 12 inches.
3. Surface area of cube = 6*(side^2) = 6*(12^2) = 6*144 = 864.
4. Alternatively, convert volume to cubic inches: 1728, which leads to side length 12 inches, same surface area.

Yes, that seems consistent. I think 864 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The total surface area of the cube is \boxed{864} square inches.
</think>

The volume of the cube is given as 1 cubic foot. To find the side length, we note that 1 cubic foot is equivalent to 12 inches on each side. Therefore, the side length of the cube is 12 inches.

The surface area of a cube is calculated by finding the area of one face and multiplying by 6 (since a cube has 6 faces). The area of one face is:

\[
12 \text{ inches} \times 12 \text{ inches} = 144 \text{ square inches}
\]

Thus, the total surface area is:

\[
6 \times 144 \text{ square inches} = 864 \text{ square inches}
\]

\[
\boxed{864}
\]
