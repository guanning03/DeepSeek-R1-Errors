Question:
Find the number of quadratic equations of the form $x^2 + ax + b = 0,$ such that whenever $c$ is a root of the equation, $c^2 - 2$ is also a root of the equation.

Correct Answer:
Let the roots be $r$ and $s$ (not necessarily real).  We take the cases where $r = s$ and $r \neq s.$

Case 1: $r = s.$

Since $r$ is the only root, we must have $r^2 - 2 = r.$  Then $r^2 - r - 2 = 0,$ which factors as $(r - 2)(r + 1) = 0,$ so $r = 2$ or $r = -1.$  This leads to the quadratics $x^2 - 4x + 4$ and $x^2 + 2x + 1.$

Case 2: $r \neq s.$

Each of $r^2 - 2$ and $s^2 - 2$ must be equal to $r$ or $s.$  We have three cases:

(i) $r^2 - 2 = r$ and $s^2 - 2 = s.$

(ii) $r^2 - 2 = s$ and $s^2 - 2 = r.$

(iii) $r^2 - 2 = s^2 - 2 = r$.

In case (i), as seen from Case $r,$ $s \in \{2,-1\}.$  This leads to the quadratic $(x - 2)(x + 1) = x^2 - x - 2.$

In case (ii), $r^2 - 2 = s$ and $s^2 - 2 = r.$  Subtracting these equations, we get
\[r^2 - s^2 = s - r.\]Then $(r - s)(r + s) = s - r.$  Since $r - s \neq 0,$ we can divide both sides by $r - s,$ to get $r + s = -1.$  Adding the equations $r^2 - 2 = s$ and $s^2 - 2 = r,$ we get
\[r^2 + s^2 - 4 = r + s = -1,\]so $r^2 + s^2 = 3.$  Squaring the equation $r + s = -1,$ we get $r^2 + 2rs + s^2 = 1,$ so $2rs = -2,$ or $rs = -1.$  Thus, $r$ and $s$ are the roots of $x^2 + x - 1.$

In case (iii), $r^2 - 2 = s^2 - 2 = r.$  Then $r^2 - r - 2 = 0,$ so $r = 2$ or $r = -1.$

If $r = 2,$ then $s^2 = 4,$ so $s = -2.$  (We are assuming that $r \neq s.$)  This leads to the quadratic $(x - 2)(x + 2) = x^2 - 4.$

If $r = -1$, then $s^2 = 1,$ so $s = 1.$  This leads to the quadratic $(x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 - 1.$

Thus, there are $\boxed{6}$ quadratic equations that work, namely $x^2 - 4x + 4,$ $x^2 + 2x + 1,$ $x^2 - x - 2,$ $x^2 + x - 1,$ $x^2 - 4,$ and $x^2 - 1.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out how many quadratic equations of the form \( x^2 + a x + b = 0 \) satisfy the condition that whenever \( c \) is a root, then \( c^2 - 2 \) is also a root. Hmm, that's an interesting problem. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's recall that a quadratic equation has two roots, say \( c \) and \( d \). So, if \( c \) is a root, then \( c^2 - 2 \) must also be a root. Similarly, if \( d \) is a root, then \( d^2 - 2 \) must also be a root. But wait, since it's a quadratic, it can only have two roots. So, this condition is forcing a kind of relationship between the roots.

Let me try to formalize this. Let’s denote the roots as \( c \) and \( d \). The problem says that if \( c \) is a root, then \( c^2 - 2 \) is also a root. So, either \( c^2 - 2 = c \) or \( c^2 - 2 = d \). Similarly, if \( d \) is a root, then \( d^2 - 2 \) must be either \( c \) or \( d \).

So, let's consider the possibilities:

1. \( c^2 - 2 = c \)
2. \( d^2 - 2 = d \)
3. Or, \( c^2 - 2 = d \) and \( d^2 - 2 = c \)

I think these are the cases we need to explore. Let's analyze each case.

**Case 1: \( c^2 - 2 = c \)**

If this is true, then we can write the equation as:

\( c^2 - c - 2 = 0 \)

Let me solve this quadratic equation. The solutions are:

\( c = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 3}{2} \)

So, \( c = 2 \) or \( c = -1 \).

So, in this case, one root is either 2 or -1. Let's note that.

**Case 2: \( d^2 - 2 = d \)**

Similarly, if this is true, then \( d^2 - d - 2 = 0 \), which gives the same solutions as above: \( d = 2 \) or \( d = -1 \).

So, similar to Case 1, the other root could be 2 or -1.

**Case 3: \( c^2 - 2 = d \) and \( d^2 - 2 = c \)**

This seems a bit more involved because it creates a system of equations. Let's write them down:

1. \( c^2 - 2 = d \)
2. \( d^2 - 2 = c \)

So, substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

\( (c^2 - 2)^2 - 2 = c \)

Let me expand this:

First, compute \( (c^2 - 2)^2 \):

\( (c^2 - 2)^2 = c^4 - 4c^2 + 4 \)

So, the equation becomes:

\( c^4 - 4c^2 + 4 - 2 = c \)

Simplify:

\( c^4 - 4c^2 + 2 = c \)

Bring all terms to one side:

\( c^4 - 4c^2 - c + 2 = 0 \)

Hmm, now we have a quartic equation. This might be tricky to solve, but let's see if we can factor it.

Let me try to factor \( c^4 - 4c^2 - c + 2 \). I'll look for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 2 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2.

Let me test \( c = 1 \):

\( 1 - 4 - 1 + 2 = -2 \neq 0 \)

\( c = -1 \):

\( 1 - 4 + 1 + 2 = 0 \). Oh, that works! So, \( c = -1 \) is a root.

So, we can factor out \( (c + 1) \) from the quartic.

Let me perform polynomial long division or synthetic division.

Using synthetic division with root -1:

Coefficients: 1 (c^4), 0 (c^3), -4 (c^2), -1 (c), 2 (constant)

Bring down 1.

Multiply by -1: 1*(-1) = -1. Add to next coefficient: 0 + (-1) = -1.

Multiply by -1: -1*(-1) = 1. Add to next coefficient: -4 + 1 = -3.

Multiply by -1: -3*(-1) = 3. Add to next coefficient: -1 + 3 = 2.

Multiply by -1: 2*(-1) = -2. Add to last coefficient: 2 + (-2) = 0.

So, the quartic factors as \( (c + 1)(c^3 - c^2 - 3c + 2) \).

Now, let's factor the cubic \( c^3 - c^2 - 3c + 2 \).

Again, using Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are ±1, ±2.

Testing \( c = 1 \):

\( 1 - 1 - 3 + 2 = -1 \neq 0 \)

Testing \( c = 2 \):

\( 8 - 4 - 6 + 2 = 0 \). So, c = 2 is a root.

Factor out \( (c - 2) \) from the cubic.

Using synthetic division on \( c^3 - c^2 - 3c + 2 \) with root 2:

Coefficients: 1, -1, -3, 2

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 2: 1*2 = 2. Add to next coefficient: -1 + 2 = 1.

Multiply by 2: 1*2 = 2. Add to next coefficient: -3 + 2 = -1.

Multiply by 2: -1*2 = -2. Add to last coefficient: 2 + (-2) = 0.

So, the cubic factors as \( (c - 2)(c^2 + c - 1) \).

Therefore, the quartic factors as \( (c + 1)(c - 2)(c^2 + c - 1) \).

So, the roots are c = -1, c = 2, and roots of \( c^2 + c - 1 = 0 \).

Solving \( c^2 + c - 1 = 0 \):

\( c = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \)

So, the four roots of the quartic are: -1, 2, \( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), \( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

But in Case 3, we had the system \( c^2 - 2 = d \) and \( d^2 - 2 = c \). So, if c is one root, d is another.

Therefore, we can pair these roots such that each satisfies the other's equation.

Let me check for each root:

1. If c = -1, then d = (-1)^2 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1. So, d = -1. So, both roots are -1. So, this would be a double root at -1.

2. If c = 2, then d = 2^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2. So, d = 2. Again, both roots are 2.

3. If c = \( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), then d = \( c^2 - 2 \). Let me compute c^2:

\( c^2 = \left( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1 - 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \)

So, d = \( \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \)

Now, check if d satisfies \( d^2 - 2 = c \):

Compute d^2:

\( d^2 = \left( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)

So, d^2 - 2 = \( \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = c \)

Yes, so it works. So, c and d are \( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \), respectively.

Similarly, if c is \( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \), then d = \( c^2 - 2 \), which we saw earlier is \( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), and vice versa.

Therefore, in Case 3, we have two possibilities:

- Both roots are equal to -1.

- Both roots are equal to 2.

- Or, the roots are \( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Wait, hold on. If both roots are equal, like both being -1 or both being 2, does that satisfy the condition? Let me check.

Suppose both roots are -1. Then, for each root c = -1, \( c^2 - 2 = (-1)^2 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1 \), which is also a root. So, yes, that works.

Similarly, both roots being 2: For c = 2, \( c^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 \), which is a root. So, that also works.

Therefore, in Case 3, we have three possibilities:

1. Both roots are -1.

2. Both roots are 2.

3. Roots are \( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

So, that's Case 3.

Now, let's summarize all the cases we have:

- **Case 1**: One root is 2, the other root is either 2 or -1.

Wait, hold on. I think I need to reevaluate. Because in Case 1, we had \( c^2 - 2 = c \), leading to c = 2 or c = -1. So, if one root is 2, then \( 2^2 - 2 = 2 \), which is itself, so the other root can be 2 or -1. Similarly, if one root is -1, then \( (-1)^2 - 2 = -1 \), so again, the other root can be 2 or -1.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that if one root is 2, then the other root must satisfy \( d^2 - 2 = c \) or \( d^2 - 2 = d \). Similarly, if one root is -1, the other root must satisfy similar conditions.

Perhaps it's better to consider all possible combinations of the roots.

So, let me think differently. Let the roots be \( c \) and \( d \). Then, for each root, \( c^2 - 2 \) must be a root, and \( d^2 - 2 \) must be a root.

Therefore, the set of roots must be closed under the transformation \( x \rightarrow x^2 - 2 \).

So, starting with root \( c \), applying the transformation gives \( c^2 - 2 \), which must also be a root. Similarly, starting with \( d \), applying the transformation gives \( d^2 - 2 \), which must be a root.

Since it's a quadratic, only two roots. So, the transformation can either map each root to itself or to the other root.

Therefore, the possible scenarios are:

1. Both roots are fixed points of the transformation: \( c^2 - 2 = c \) and \( d^2 - 2 = d \).

2. Each root maps to the other: \( c^2 - 2 = d \) and \( d^2 - 2 = c \).

So, these are the two main cases.

Wait, that's a better way to approach it. So, either both roots are fixed points, or they form a 2-cycle under the transformation.

So, let's handle these two cases.

**Case A: Both roots are fixed points**

So, for each root \( c \), \( c^2 - 2 = c \). So, both roots satisfy \( x^2 - x - 2 = 0 \), which factors as \( (x - 2)(x + 1) = 0 \). So, the roots are 2 and -1.

Therefore, the quadratic equation would have roots 2 and -1. So, the quadratic is \( (x - 2)(x + 1) = x^2 - x - 2 \). So, \( a = -1 \), \( b = -2 \).

But wait, hold on. Since both roots are fixed points, the quadratic can have either both roots as 2, both roots as -1, or one root as 2 and the other as -1.

So, actually, there are three possibilities:

1. Both roots are 2: Then, quadratic is \( (x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 \). So, \( a = -4 \), \( b = 4 \).

2. Both roots are -1: Quadratic is \( (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 \). So, \( a = 2 \), \( b = 1 \).

3. One root is 2, the other is -1: Quadratic is \( (x - 2)(x + 1) = x^2 - x - 2 \). So, \( a = -1 \), \( b = -2 \).

Therefore, in Case A, we have three quadratic equations.

**Case B: The roots form a 2-cycle**

Here, \( c^2 - 2 = d \) and \( d^2 - 2 = c \).

So, as we saw earlier, this leads to the quartic equation, which gives roots \( c = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( c = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

So, the two roots are \( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Therefore, the quadratic equation is \( (x - c)(x - d) \), where \( c \) and \( d \) are these roots.

Let me compute that quadratic. Let me denote \( c = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( d = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

So, the quadratic is \( (x - c)(x - d) = x^2 - (c + d)x + c d \).

Compute \( c + d = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1 \).

Compute \( c d = \left( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5} - 5}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1 \).

So, the quadratic equation is \( x^2 - (-1)x + (-1) = x^2 + x - 1 \). So, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -1 \).

Therefore, in Case B, there's only one quadratic equation.

Wait, but hold on, since the quadratic is determined by its roots, and in this case, the roots are specific, so only one quadratic comes from this case.

Therefore, combining Case A and Case B, we have:

- Case A: 3 quadratics.

- Case B: 1 quadratic.

So, total number of quadratics is 3 + 1 = 4.

But wait, hold on. Let me verify whether all these quadratics actually satisfy the original condition.

For Case A:

1. Quadratic with both roots 2: \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \).

Check: If 2 is a root, then \( 2^2 - 2 = 2 \), which is also a root. So, yes.

2. Quadratic with both roots -1: \( x^2 + 2x + 1 \).

Check: If -1 is a root, then \( (-1)^2 - 2 = -1 \), which is also a root. Yes.

3. Quadratic with roots 2 and -1: \( x^2 - x - 2 \).

Check: For root 2, \( 2^2 - 2 = 2 \), which is a root. For root -1, \( (-1)^2 - 2 = -1 \), which is a root. So, yes.

For Case B: Quadratic \( x^2 + x - 1 \).

Roots are \( c = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( d = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Check for root c: \( c^2 - 2 = d \). We saw earlier that this is true.

Similarly, for root d: \( d^2 - 2 = c \). Also true.

Therefore, all quadratics in Case A and Case B satisfy the condition.

So, total quadratics are 3 + 1 = 4.

Wait, but hold on. Let me see if there are overlaps or if I have missed any cases.

In Case A, I considered both roots being fixed points, which includes both roots being the same (either both 2 or both -1) or different (2 and -1). So, that seems comprehensive.

In Case B, I considered the 2-cycle, which gives a distinct quadratic. So, that should be the only one.

Therefore, altogether, there are four quadratics satisfying the condition.

But wait, let me think again. Are there any other possibilities?

For instance, suppose one root is fixed and the other maps to the fixed root. So, for example, c is fixed (\( c^2 - 2 = c \)), and d is such that \( d^2 - 2 = c \). But then, in this case, since c is fixed, d must map to c.

But if c is fixed, say c = 2, then \( d^2 - 2 = 2 \) which implies \( d^2 = 4 \) so d = 2 or d = -2. But if d is a root, then d = 2 or d = -2.

But wait, if d = -2, then \( (-2)^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 \), which is c. So, in this case, the roots would be 2 and -2. Let me check if this quadratic satisfies the condition.

Quadratic with roots 2 and -2: \( (x - 2)(x + 2) = x^2 - 4 \). So, \( a = 0 \), \( b = -4 \).

Check: For root 2, \( 2^2 - 2 = 2 \), which is a root. For root -2, \( (-2)^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 \), which is a root. So, yes, this quadratic also satisfies the condition.

Wait, so this is another quadratic equation that I might have missed earlier.

So, in Case A, I considered both roots fixed, but if one root is fixed and the other maps to it, that would be a different case.

Similarly, c = -1 is a fixed point, so if one root is -1, the other root can be such that \( d^2 - 2 = -1 \), which would mean \( d^2 = 1 \), so d = 1 or d = -1.

But wait, if d = 1, then \( 1^2 - 2 = -1 \), which is a root. So, roots would be -1 and 1.

So, let me check if quadratic \( x^2 + 0x - 1 \), which is \( x^2 - 1 \), satisfies the condition.

Check roots: 1 and -1.

For root 1: \( 1^2 - 2 = -1 \), which is a root.

For root -1: \( (-1)^2 - 2 = -1 \), which is a root.

So, that works. So, quadratic \( x^2 - 1 \) is another one.

Similarly, if the fixed point is 2, then the other root can be -2, as above.

So, this suggests that my initial analysis in Case A was incomplete because I didn't consider that one root can be fixed and the other can map to it.

So, perhaps, I need to adjust Case A accordingly.

So, let's reconsider Case A.

**Revised Case A: Both roots are fixed points or one root is fixed and the other maps to it.**

So, actually, in Case A, we can have:

1. Both roots fixed: 2 and 2.

2. Both roots fixed: -1 and -1.

3. One root fixed (2), the other maps to it (-2).

4. One root fixed (-1), the other maps to it (1).

So, quadratics:

1. Both roots 2: \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \).

2. Both roots -1: \( x^2 + 2x + 1 \).

3. Roots 2 and -2: \( x^2 - 4 \).

4. Roots -1 and 1: \( x^2 - 1 \).

So, that's four quadratics in Case A.

Additionally, in Case B, we had the quadratic \( x^2 + x - 1 \).

But wait, earlier I thought Case B only gave one quadratic, but now, perhaps, depending on whether the roots are fixed or not, we can have more quadratics.

Wait, but in Case B, the roots form a 2-cycle, so they aren't fixed. So, that quadratic is different from the ones in Case A.

Therefore, in total, we have:

- Case A: Four quadratics.

- Case B: One quadratic.

So, total of five quadratics.

But wait, let me verify each quadratic:

1. \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \): Roots 2, 2. Check: 2^2 - 2 = 2, which is a root. So, good.

2. \( x^2 + 2x + 1 \): Roots -1, -1. Check: (-1)^2 - 2 = -1, which is a root. Good.

3. \( x^2 - 4 \): Roots 2, -2. Check: 2^2 - 2 = 2, which is a root; (-2)^2 - 2 = 2, which is a root. Good.

4. \( x^2 - 1 \): Roots 1, -1. Check: 1^2 - 2 = -1, which is a root; (-1)^2 - 2 = -1, which is a root. Good.

5. \( x^2 + x - 1 \): Roots \( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Check: Each maps to the other under the transformation. So, yes.

Therefore, five quadratics.

But wait, hold on. The quadratic \( x^2 - 1 \) was considered in Case A because one root is fixed (-1) and the other maps to it (1). Similarly, quadratic \( x^2 - 4 \) is another.

So, that suggests that Case A actually has four quadratics:

1. Both roots 2.

2. Both roots -1.

3. Roots 2 and -2.

4. Roots 1 and -1.

And Case B has one quadratic.

So, total is five.

But wait, let me think again. Is quadratic \( x^2 - x - 2 \) included in Case A or not?

Wait, quadratic \( x^2 - x - 2 \) has roots 2 and -1.

In this case, for root 2: 2^2 - 2 = 2, which is a root.

For root -1: (-1)^2 - 2 = -1, which is a root.

So, this quadratic is also in Case A because both roots are fixed points. So, yes, it's included in Case A.

Similarly, quadratic \( x^2 + x - 1 \) is in Case B because the roots form a 2-cycle.

Therefore, total quadratics:

Case A: 4 quadratics.

Case B: 1 quadratic.

Total: 5 quadratics.

Wait, but earlier, I thought Case A had 3 quadratics, but upon further analysis, considering that one root can be fixed and the other mapping to it, it's 4.

So, perhaps, the total is 5.

But wait, let me think about whether quadratics \( x^2 - x - 2 \) and \( x^2 - 4 \) and \( x^2 - 1 \) are actually distinct.

Yes, \( x^2 - x - 2 \) is different from \( x^2 - 4 \) and \( x^2 - 1 \).

So, to be thorough, let me list all five quadratics:

1. \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) (double root at 2)

2. \( x^2 + 2x + 1 \) (double root at -1)

3. \( x^2 - 4 \) (roots 2 and -2)

4. \( x^2 - 1 \) (roots 1 and -1)

5. \( x^2 + x - 1 \) (roots \( \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \))

Each satisfies the condition that whenever c is a root, \( c^2 - 2 \) is also a root.

Wait, but hold on. Let me check quadratic \( x^2 - 4 \): roots 2 and -2.

For root 2: \( 2^2 - 2 = 2 \), which is a root.

For root -2: \( (-2)^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 \), which is a root.

So, yes, it works.

Similarly, quadratic \( x^2 - 1 \): roots 1 and -1.

For root 1: \( 1^2 - 2 = -1 \), which is a root.

For root -1: \( (-1)^2 - 2 = -1 \), which is a root.

So, that works.

Quadratic \( x^2 - x - 2 \): roots 2 and -1.

For root 2: \( 2^2 - 2 = 2 \), which is a root.

For root -1: \( (-1)^2 - 2 = -1 \), which is a root.

Quadratic \( x^2 + x - 1 \): roots \( c = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( d = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

For c: \( c^2 - 2 = d \).

For d: \( d^2 - 2 = c \).

So, that works.

Quadratic \( x^2 + 2x + 1 \): roots -1 and -1.

For root -1: \( (-1)^2 - 2 = -1 \), which is a root.

Quadratic \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \): roots 2 and 2.

For root 2: \( 2^2 - 2 = 2 \), which is a root.

So, yes, all five quadratics satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the total number is five.

But wait, hold on. Let me think if there are any duplicates or if I have missed any.

Wait, quadratic \( x^2 - x - 2 \) is in Case A as both roots are fixed points.

Quadratic \( x^2 + x - 1 \) is in Case B as a 2-cycle.

Quadratics \( x^2 - 4 \) and \( x^2 - 1 \) are in Case A because one root is fixed and the other maps to it.

Quadratics \( x^2 + 2x + 1 \) and \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) are in Case A as both roots fixed.

So, total is five.

But wait, hold on, is quadratic \( x^2 - 4 \) and \( x^2 - 1 \) considered as separate quadratics?

Yes, because their coefficients are different.

Therefore, with that, I think the total number is five.

But wait, just to make sure, let me see if there are any other possibilities.

Another way to think is that the set of roots must be closed under the transformation \( x \rightarrow x^2 - 2 \).

In the case of quadratics, the maximum size of the set is two, so the possible closed sets under this transformation can be:

1. A single root which is a fixed point: roots are 2 or -1. So, multiplicities considered.

2. Two roots which form a 2-cycle.

3. Or, a single root which is fixed, and another root which maps to it.

Wait, but actually, in the quadratic case, the roots can be:

- Both fixed points (either both 2, both -1, or one 2 and one -1).

- Or, a 2-cycle.

But in addition, when you have a fixed point and a root that maps to it, which would give you roots 2 and -2, or -1 and 1.

So, these quadratics are also valid.

Therefore, that's:

- Both roots fixed: 2 and 2; -1 and -1; 2 and -1.

- 2-cycle: \( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

- Fixed point with mapping: 2 and -2; -1 and 1.

Thus, that gives us five distinct quadratics.

Therefore, the number of quadratics is five.

But to make sure, let me list them all:

1. \( (x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 \).

2. \( (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 \).

3. \( (x - 2)(x + 2) = x^2 - 4 \).

4. \( (x - 1)(x + 1) = x^2 - 1 \).

5. \( (x - \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})(x - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}) = x^2 + x - 1 \).

Yes, these are five distinct quadratics.

Therefore, the number of such quadratic equations is 5.

**Final Answer**
The number of such quadratic equations is \boxed{5}.

To find the number of quadratic equations of the form \(x^2 + ax + b = 0\) such that whenever \(c\) is a root, \(c^2 - 2\) is also a root, we need to consider the roots and their transformations.

1. **Case 1: Both roots are fixed points.**
   - If \(c\) is a root, then \(c^2 - 2 = c\). Solving \(c^2 - c - 2 = 0\) gives \(c = 2\) or \(c = -1\).
   - Possible quadratics:
     - Both roots are 2: \(x^2 - 4x + 4\).
     - Both roots are -1: \(x^2 + 2x + 1\).
     - One root is 2 and the other is -1: \(x^2 - x - 2\).

2. **Case 2: Roots form a 2-cycle.**
   - If \(c\) is a root, then \(c^2 - 2 = d\) and \(d^2 - 2 = c\). Solving the system gives roots \(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\) and \(\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\).
   - Quadratic: \(x^2 + x - 1\).

3. **Case 3: One root is fixed and the other maps to it.**
   - If one root is fixed (2 or -1) and the other maps to it:
     - Roots 2 and -2: \(x^2 - 4\).
     - Roots -1 and 1: \(x^2 - 1\).

Summarizing the quadratics:
1. \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) (both roots 2)
2. \(x^2 + 2x + 1\) (both roots -1)
3. \(x^2 - 4\) (roots 2 and -2)
4. \(x^2 - 1\) (roots -1 and 1)
5. \(x^2 + x - 1\) (roots \(\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}\))

Thus, the number of such quadratic equations is \(\boxed{5}\).
