Question:
In the diagram below, we have $\overline{ST}\parallel\overline{QR}$, $\angle P= 40^\circ$, and $\angle Q =35^\circ$. Find the measure of $\angle STR$ in degrees.

[asy]
pair P,Q,R,SS,T;
Q = (0,0);
R = (1,0);
P = (1.1,0.5);
SS = 0.6*P;
T = R + 0.6*(P-R);
draw(T--SS--P--R--Q--SS);
label("$P$",P,N);
label("$S$",SS,NW);
label("$Q$",Q,S);
label("$R$",R,S);
label("$T$",T,ENE);
[/asy]

Correct Answer:
From $\triangle PQR$, we have $\angle R = 180^\circ - \angle Q - \angle P = 105^\circ$.  Since $\overline{ST}\parallel \overline{QR}$, we have $\angle STR = 180^\circ - \angle R = \boxed{75^\circ}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I'm looking at this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first since there's an Asymptote diagram provided, but I can't see the image. Hmm, okay, maybe I can figure it out just from the description.

We have two lines, ST and QR, which are parallel. That's important because when lines are parallel, the corresponding angles are equal, and the alternate interior angles are equal. Also, the concept of similar triangles might come into play here.

Given angles are angle P, which is 40 degrees, and angle Q, which is 35 degrees. The goal is to find the measure of angle STR. Hmm, okay, so point S is somewhere, connected to points T and P, I think. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

First, let me note down what I know:

1. ST is parallel to QR.
2. Angle P is 40 degrees.
3. Angle Q is 35 degrees.
4. Need to find angle STR.

Okay, so maybe triangle PQR is a big triangle with point S somewhere on side PQ, and T is a point on side QR such that ST is parallel to QR.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, they have points P, Q, R, SS, T. It draws T connected to SS, SS connected to P, P connected to R, R connected to Q, and Q connected to SS. So, maybe the figure is a bit more complicated.

But let's see: since ST is parallel to QR, and angle Q is 35 degrees, which is at point Q. So, angle Q is at point Q between QR and QP. Since ST is parallel to QR, maybe the angle at S corresponding to angle Q is also 35 degrees?

Wait, not sure. Maybe I should consider the transversal lines here. If ST is parallel to QR, and if we can find some transversal cutting across them, then we can use properties of parallel lines.

Looking at the Asymptote code, point S is on segment PQ, right? Because SS is 0.6*P, so it's somewhere between P and Q. Similarly, point T is on QR, since T is R + 0.6*(P - R). Hmm, so T is somewhere between R and P, but since it's connected to R, perhaps T is on QR.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to reconstruct the diagram step by step.

Let me try to interpret the Asymptote code. The points are:

- Q at (0,0)
- R at (1,0)
- P at (1.1,0.5)
- SS at 0.6*P, which would be (0.6*1.1, 0.6*0.5) = (0.66, 0.3)
- T at R + 0.6*(P - R) = (1,0) + 0.6*( (1.1 -1), 0.5 -0 ) = (1,0) + 0.6*(0.1, 0.5) = (1 + 0.06, 0 + 0.3) = (1.06, 0.3)

So, the figure is drawn as T connected to SS, SS connected to P, P connected to R, R connected to Q, and Q connected to SS.

So, the figure has points:

- P at (1.1,0.5)
- SS at (0.66,0.3)
- T at (1.06,0.3)
- Q at (0,0)
- R at (1,0)

So, lines:

- T to SS
- SS to P
- P to R
- R to Q
- Q to SS

So, the figure is a pentagon? Or rather, a polygon with points T, S, P, R, Q, connected in some way.

Wait, maybe not. Let me see: T connected to SS, which is connected to P, which is connected to R, which is connected to Q, which is connected back to SS. So, the figure is a polygon with vertices T, S, P, R, Q, with sides T-S, S-P, P-R, R-Q, Q-S.

So, this is a pentagon? Or maybe not. Wait, no, it's a polygon with 5 sides: T connected to S, S connected to P, P connected to R, R connected to Q, Q connected back to T? Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, it's T--SS--P--R--Q--SS. So, actually, it's a polygon starting at T, going to SS, then to P, then to R, then to Q, then back to SS. So, that makes a pentagon, but with a missing side between T and SS? Wait, no, it's T connected to SS, SS connected to P, P connected to R, R connected to Q, Q connected back to SS, so it's a polygon with sides T-SS, SS-P, P-R, R-Q, Q-SS. So, that's a pentagon, but it's not a simple one because Q is connected back to SS, which is connected to P.

Wait, maybe that's a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of triangles or something.

But perhaps all this is unnecessary. Let's go back to the problem.

We have ST parallel to QR. So, ST is a line segment somewhere, and QR is another line segment.

Given that angle P is 40 degrees, angle Q is 35 degrees.

We need to find angle STR. Hmm.

Maybe triangle PQR is a triangle where angle Q is 35 degrees, angle P is 40 degrees, so angle R would be 180 - 35 - 40 = 105 degrees.

Wait, so triangle PQR has angles at Q: 35, at P: 40, and at R: 105.

Now, since ST is parallel to QR, and if I can figure out the relationship between the angles, maybe through similar triangles or something.

Wait, so if ST is parallel to QR, and if we have a transversal PS, then the corresponding angles at S and Q should be equal.

Wait, but angle P is 40 degrees. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR because of the parallel lines.

Wait, if ST is parallel to QR, then triangles PST and PQR might be similar.

But let me check.

If two lines are parallel, then the corresponding triangles are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem, also known as Thales' theorem.

So, if ST is parallel to QR, then triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR.

Therefore, the angles in triangle PST correspond to those in triangle PQR.

Given that, angle at P is common, so angle P is 40 degrees.

Therefore, angle PST is equal to angle PQR, which is angle Q, which is 35 degrees.

Wait, is that right?

Wait, in triangle PQR, angle Q is 35 degrees at point Q.

But in triangle PST, angle at S is corresponding to angle at Q if ST is parallel to QR.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

If ST is parallel to QR, then the corresponding angles when cut by a transversal PS would be equal.

So, angle at S (angle PST) corresponds to angle at Q (angle PQR) because ST is parallel to QR, and PS is the transversal.

Therefore, angle PST = angle PQR = 35 degrees.

Similarly, angle at T (angle PTS) corresponds to angle at R (angle PRQ) = 105 degrees.

Therefore, in triangle PST, angles are 40 degrees at P, 35 degrees at S, so angle at T is 180 - 40 - 35 = 105 degrees.

Therefore, angle PTS is 105 degrees.

Wait, so angle STR is the angle at point T between points S, T, R.

But wait, point R is connected to point Q, but is it connected to point T? In the Asymptote code, it's R connected to Q, but not necessarily to T.

Wait, no, in the figure, T is connected to R? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's T connected to R? Let me check.

No, in the Asymptote code, T is defined as R + 0.6*(P - R), so T is on QR extended? Wait, no, R is at (1,0), P is at (1.1,0.5). So, vector from R to P is (0.1,0.5). So, 0.6*(P - R) is (0.06,0.3). Therefore, T is at (1 + 0.06, 0 + 0.3) = (1.06, 0.3). So, T is above R, but QR is the segment from Q(0,0) to R(1,0). So, T is not on QR, but above it at (1.06,0.3). Hmm.

Therefore, maybe the figure is more complex, with T connected to R? Or not? Wait, from the Asymptote code, T is connected to SS and Q is connected to SS. So, the figure is T connected to SS, SS connected to P, P connected to R, R connected to Q, Q connected to SS.

So, it's a closed figure: T-SS-P-R-Q-SS-T.

So, it's a pentagon with vertices T, SS, P, R, Q.

Now, in that case, maybe we can find some triangles inside this figure.

But perhaps I should try to use the given angles and the parallel lines.

Given that ST is parallel to QR, which is the base of triangle PQR.

Hmm, so ST is a line segment parallel to QR, somewhere above it, connected to point S on PQ and point T somewhere else.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, T is connected to SS (which is S) and S is connected to P, which is connected to R, which is connected to Q, which is connected back to S.

Wait, perhaps triangle STR is part of this figure.

Wait, if I can figure out the angles at point S and point T, maybe I can find angle STR.

Alternatively, maybe triangle STR is formed by connecting points S, T, R.

Given that ST is parallel to QR, and angle P is 40 degrees, angle Q is 35 degrees.

Wait, maybe I should consider triangle PQR first.

In triangle PQR, angles at Q is 35, at P is 40, so angle at R is 105. So, angles are 35, 40, 105.

Since ST is parallel to QR, and assuming that S is on PQ and T is on PR or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, S is on PQ (since SS is 0.6*P, so it's closer to Q), and T is on QR? Wait, no, T is at (1.06, 0.3), which is above R, so it's not on QR.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Maybe I should try a different approach.

Since ST is parallel to QR, and angle P is 40 degrees. So, angle at P is 40 degrees, which is angle SPQ or something.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of alternate interior angles.

If ST is parallel to QR, then angle between PS and ST is equal to angle between PS and QR.

But angle at P is 40 degrees, so maybe angle between PS and PQ is 40 degrees.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps triangle PQR has angle at Q as 35 degrees, angle at P as 40 degrees, so the third angle is 105 degrees at R.

Since ST is parallel to QR, and if we can find where S and T are, maybe we can find some angles.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of similar triangles.

Wait, if ST is parallel to QR, then triangles PST and PQR are similar.

So, triangle PST ~ triangle PQR.

Therefore, the angles in triangle PST are equal to those in triangle PQR.

Given that, angle at P is common, so angle PST = angle PQR = 35 degrees.

Angle at S in triangle PST corresponds to angle at Q in triangle PQR, which is 35 degrees.

Wait, no, actually, in triangle PST, angle at S is corresponding to angle at R in triangle PQR because of the parallel lines.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think about the transversal cutting the parallel lines.

If ST is parallel to QR, and PS is the transversal, then angle at S (angle PST) is equal to angle at Q (angle PQR) because they are corresponding angles.

Therefore, angle PST = angle PQR = 35 degrees.

Similarly, angle at T (angle PTS) is equal to angle at R (angle PRQ) because they are corresponding angles.

So, angle PTS = angle PRQ = 105 degrees.

Therefore, in triangle PST, angles are 40 degrees at P, 35 degrees at S, so angle at T is 105 degrees.

Wait, so angle PTS is 105 degrees.

But angle STR is the angle at T between S, T, R.

So, if I can figure out angle STR, which is part of triangle STR.

Wait, but to find angle STR, maybe I need to find some other angles.

Alternatively, maybe triangle STR is part of triangle PQR.

Wait, but point T is not on QR, it's somewhere else.

Wait, maybe I need to use the Law of Sines or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can figure out some other angles.

Wait, angle at T is 105 degrees, as in triangle PST.

But point T is connected to R, so maybe in triangle STR, we can find angle STR.

Wait, maybe I need to find angle at T in triangle STR, which is angle STR.

Wait, but to find that, I need to know some other angles in triangle STR.

Alternatively, maybe I can find angle SRT or angle SRT.

Wait, point R is connected to Q, so angle at R is 105 degrees in triangle PQR.

Wait, but in triangle STR, angle at R is same as angle PRQ, which is 105 degrees.

But wait, is that true? Because point T is not on QR, so angle SRT is different.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider triangle STR and triangle PQR.

Wait, this is getting too vague.

Maybe I should try to find coordinates of the points.

Given that, from the Asymptote code, we have:

- Q at (0,0)
- R at (1,0)
- P at (1.1, 0.5)
- S at (0.66, 0.3)
- T at (1.06, 0.3)

So, coordinates:

- P: (1.1, 0.5)
- S: (0.66, 0.3)
- T: (1.06, 0.3)
- R: (1, 0)
- Q: (0, 0)

So, now, let's compute angle STR.

Point S is at (0.66, 0.3), point T is at (1.06, 0.3), point R is at (1,0).

So, angle STR is the angle at point T between points S, T, and R.

So, to find angle STR, we can compute the angle between vectors TS and TR.

First, let's find coordinates:

- S: (0.66, 0.3)
- T: (1.06, 0.3)
- R: (1, 0)

So, vector TS is from T to S: S - T = (0.66 - 1.06, 0.3 - 0.3) = (-0.4, 0)

Vector TR is from T to R: R - T = (1 - 1.06, 0 - 0.3) = (-0.06, -0.3)

So, vector TS is (-0.4, 0) and vector TR is (-0.06, -0.3)

Now, to find the angle between these two vectors, we can use the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (TS . TR) / (|TS| |TR|)

Compute the dot product:

TS . TR = (-0.4)(-0.06) + (0)(-0.3) = 0.024 + 0 = 0.024

Compute |TS|:

|TS| = sqrt((-0.4)^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4

Compute |TR|:

|TR| = sqrt((-0.06)^2 + (-0.3)^2) = sqrt(0.0036 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.0936) ≈ 0.306

Therefore,

cos(theta) = 0.024 / (0.4 * 0.306) ≈ 0.024 / 0.1224 ≈ 0.196

Therefore, theta ≈ arccos(0.196) ≈ 78.8 degrees

Hmm, so approximately 79 degrees.

But wait, let me verify the calculations.

First, vectors:

TS: from T(1.06,0.3) to S(0.66,0.3): (0.66 - 1.06, 0.3 - 0.3) = (-0.4, 0)

TR: from T(1.06,0.3) to R(1,0): (1 - 1.06, 0 - 0.3) = (-0.06, -0.3)

Dot product: (-0.4)(-0.06) + (0)(-0.3) = 0.024 + 0 = 0.024

|TS|: sqrt((-0.4)^2 + 0^2) = 0.4

|TR|: sqrt((-0.06)^2 + (-0.3)^2) = sqrt(0.0036 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.0936) ≈ 0.306

So, cos(theta) = 0.024 / (0.4 * 0.306) ≈ 0.024 / 0.1224 ≈ 0.196

Arccos(0.196) ≈ 78.8 degrees

So, approximately 79 degrees.

But wait, let me think about this. Angle STR is approximately 79 degrees.

But the problem didn't specify approximate angles, so maybe we can find an exact value.

Wait, perhaps using exact coordinates.

Given that:

- P is at (1.1, 0.5)
- S is at (0.66, 0.3)
- T is at (1.06, 0.3)
- R is at (1,0)

So, vectors:

TS: from T(1.06, 0.3) to S(0.66, 0.3) is (-0.4, 0)

TR: from T(1.06, 0.3) to R(1,0) is (-0.06, -0.3)

So, exact calculation:

Dot product: (-0.4)(-0.06) + (0)(-0.3) = 0.024 + 0 = 0.024

|TS| = sqrt( (-0.4)^2 + 0^2 ) = 0.4

|TR| = sqrt( (-0.06)^2 + (-0.3)^2 ) = sqrt(0.0036 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.0936) = 0.306

So, cos(theta) = 0.024 / (0.4 * 0.306) = 0.024 / 0.1224 = 0.196

So, exact value of cos(theta) is 0.196. Let me see what angle has cosine 0.196.

Using a calculator, arccos(0.196) is approximately 78.8 degrees, which is approximately 79 degrees.

But, wait, is there a way to find this angle without using coordinates?

Alternatively, maybe using triangle properties.

Let me think differently.

Since ST is parallel to QR, and angle P is 40 degrees, angle Q is 35 degrees.

In triangle PQR, angle at P is 40, angle at Q is 35, so angle at R is 105.

Since ST is parallel to QR, triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR.

Therefore, angle at T in triangle PST is equal to angle at R in triangle PQR, which is 105 degrees.

Thus, angle PST = angle PQR = 35 degrees, angle PTS = angle PRQ = 105 degrees, and angle at P is 40 degrees.

Therefore, in triangle PST, angles are 35, 40, 105.

Now, in triangle STR, which is another triangle.

Wait, maybe quadrilateral PSTR is a trapezoid because ST is parallel to QR, but I don't think so because point S is on PQ and point T is somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe triangle STR is part of triangle PQR.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe we can find angle STR as 180 minus some angles.

Wait, at point T, we have angle PTS = 105 degrees, as in triangle PST.

But in triangle STR, angle at T is angle STR.

Wait, perhaps not directly.

Wait, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle PST.

In triangle PST, sides are proportional to the sines of their opposite angles.

So, let's denote:

- angle at P: 40 degrees
- angle at S: 35 degrees
- angle at T: 105 degrees

Therefore, sides:

- PS: opposite angle at T (105)
- PT: opposite angle at S (35)
- ST: opposite angle at P (40)

So, ratios:

PS / sin(105) = PT / sin(35) = ST / sin(40)

But I don't know the lengths of any sides, so maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, since coordinates gave us approximately 79 degrees, but maybe it's 80 degrees.

Wait, 0.196 is approximately cos(78.8), which is roughly 79 degrees.

But is there an exact value?

Wait, if we use exact values, perhaps the angle is 80 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe 75 degrees.

Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe we can consider that angle STR is equal to angle PQR, which is 35 degrees, but that seems too small.

Alternatively, 40 degrees? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can think of triangle STR.

Point S is on PQ, point T is on PR, but not necessarily.

Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, T is connected to S and R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can use the Law of Sines in triangle STR.

But without knowing any sides, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps think about the full diagram.

Given that, maybe the sum of angles around point T.

Wait, in triangle PST, angle at T is 105 degrees.

But point T is connected to R as well.

Wait, at point T, we have two angles: angle PTS = 105 degrees (from triangle PST) and angle STR, which is the angle we need to find.

But unless we know something about the straight line, which we don't.

Wait, unless there's a straight line somewhere.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, T is connected to SS, which is S, and to R.

So, the angle at T between S, T, R is angle STR, which is what we need.

But without more information, maybe we can't find it.

Wait, but in the coordinate system, we can compute it exactly.

Wait, in the coordinate system, we have vectors:

TS vector: (-0.4, 0)

TR vector: (-0.06, -0.3)

So, the angle between them is calculated as:

cos(theta) = (0.024) / (0.4 * 0.306) ≈ 0.196

theta ≈ 78.8 degrees

So, approximately 79 degrees.

But the problem is probably expecting an exact value, perhaps 80 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe 80 degrees.

Wait, 78.8 is close to 79, but if I consider that in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are given as decimal numbers, maybe the exact angle is 80 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe 75 degrees.

Wait, maybe I can calculate it more precisely.

Given that:

cos(theta) = 0.024 / (0.4 * 0.306) = 0.024 / 0.1224 = 0.196

So, arccos(0.196) is approximately:

Since cos(60) = 0.5

cos(75) ≈ 0.2588

cos(80) ≈ 0.1736

So, 0.196 is between cos(75) and cos(80), closer to cos(75). Wait, no, 0.196 is less than 0.2588 but more than 0.1736.

Wait, actually, wait, cos decreases as angle increases, so 0.196 is between cos(75) and cos(80). Wait, cos(75) ≈ 0.2588, cos(76) ≈ 0.2419, cos(77) ≈ 0.2348, cos(78) ≈ 0.2079, cos(79) ≈ 0.1908, cos(80) ≈ 0.1736

So, 0.196 is between cos(78) ≈ 0.2079 and cos(79) ≈ 0.1908.

So, 0.196 is approximately 78.5 degrees.

So, approximately 78.5 degrees, which is roughly 78.5, so 79 degrees.

So, approximately 79 degrees.

But the problem didn't specify approximate, so perhaps exact value is 80 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 80 degrees.

But wait, maybe the exact value is 80 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe 75 degrees.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are given as 0.66, which is 2/3, 0.3 is 3/10, 1.06 is approx 1 + 1/10, etc.

Wait, maybe the exact angle is 80 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle PST, angle at T is 105 degrees, angle at S is 35 degrees, so angle at P is 40 degrees.

Thus, in triangle STR, maybe angle STR is equal to 180 - 105 - something.

Wait, not necessarily.

Alternatively, since ST is parallel to QR, then the angle between ST and SR is equal to the angle between QR and something.

Wait, maybe using the concept of alternate interior angles.

Wait, since ST || QR, and if we can find a transversal cutting them, maybe angle between ST and SR is equal to angle between QR and something.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe triangle STR is similar to another triangle.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in triangle PST, angle at T is 105 degrees, and in triangle PQR, angle at R is 105 degrees.

Therefore, maybe angle STR is equal to angle PQR, which is 35 degrees.

Wait, but that seems inconsistent with the coordinate calculation.

Alternatively, maybe angle STR is equal to angle PQR minus something.

Wait, I think the coordinate method is more precise.

So, if I can compute it more accurately.

Given that:

Vector TS: (-0.4, 0)

Vector TR: (-0.06, -0.3)

Dot product: 0.024

|TS| = 0.4

|TR| = sqrt(0.0036 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.0936) = 0.306

So, cos(theta) = 0.024 / (0.4 * 0.306) = 0.024 / 0.1224 ≈ 0.196

So, theta ≈ arccos(0.196)

Using calculator, arccos(0.196) ≈ 78.8 degrees

So, approximately 79 degrees.

So, maybe the answer is 80 degrees, which is close.

But perhaps, given the problem, it's 80 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe 75 degrees.

Wait, let me think of an exact method.

Wait, in triangle PST, since ST is parallel to QR, the ratio of PS to PQ is equal to the ratio of PT to PR.

Given that, maybe we can find some proportions.

Wait, but without knowing the lengths, maybe it's difficult.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry.

Given that, since we have coordinates, let's compute the angle.

Compute vectors:

From point T(1.06, 0.3) to S(0.66, 0.3): (-0.4, 0)

From point T(1.06, 0.3) to R(1,0): (-0.06, -0.3)

So, the angle between these two vectors is angle STR.

Compute the angle between vector (-0.4, 0) and (-0.06, -0.3).

Compute the dot product:

(-0.4)(-0.06) + (0)(-0.3) = 0.024 + 0 = 0.024

Compute |(-0.4, 0)| = 0.4

Compute |(-0.06, -0.3)| = sqrt(0.0036 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.0936) = 0.306

So, cos(theta) = 0.024 / (0.4 * 0.306) ≈ 0.196

So, theta ≈ arccos(0.196) ≈ 78.8 degrees

So, approximately 79 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of angle STR is approximately 79 degrees.

But since the problem is likely constructed to have an integer answer, probably 80 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe 75 degrees.

Wait, but 78.8 is closer to 79.

But in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are given as decimal numbers, so maybe the exact angle is 79 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe it's 80 degrees, considering the approximate.

But since the problem didn't specify, and in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are decimal, which could lead to a more precise calculation.

But, in reality, perhaps the exact angle is 80 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the triangle.

Wait, in triangle STR, points S, T, R.

From coordinates, S is at (0.66,0.3), T is at (1.06,0.3), R is at (1,0).

So, plotting these points:

- S is at (0.66, 0.3)
- T is at (1.06, 0.3)
- R is at (1, 0)

So, triangle STR is a triangle with base SR and point T.

Wait, SR is from S(0.66,0.3) to R(1,0). So, vector SR is (0.34, -0.3)

Vector ST is from S to T: (0.4, 0)

Wait, but we need angle at T, between S, T, R.

Wait, maybe using coordinates, compute the angle.

So, from point T(1.06, 0.3), we have two lines:

- TS: to S(0.66,0.3): vector (-0.4, 0)
- TR: to R(1,0): vector (-0.06, -0.3)

So, the angle between these two vectors.

Which we did earlier, giving approx 78.8 degrees.

So, 79 degrees.

But the problem is likely constructed to have an integer answer, so 80 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe 75 degrees.

Wait, but 78.8 is closer to 79, so probably 79 degrees.

But in the problem statement, they gave angles as 40 and 35, which are both integers.

Therefore, 79 degrees is a plausible answer.

Wait, but is there a way to find it exactly?

Alternatively, since in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are given as decimals, but maybe exact fractions.

Looking back:

- Q at (0,0)
- R at (1,0)
- P at (1.1, 0.5)
- S at (0.66, 0.3)
- T at (1.06, 0.3)

So, 0.66 is 2/3 approximately, but 0.66 is 2/3 is 0.666..., so close.

Similarly, 0.3 is 3/10.

Similarly, 1.06 is 1 + 0.06, which is 1 + 6/100 = 1 + 3/50.

So, maybe the coordinates are exact fractions.

Therefore, perhaps point S is at (2/3, 1/3), but 0.66 is 2/3, and 0.3 is 3/10.

But 2/3 is approximately 0.666, but in the code, it's 0.66, which is 66/100 = 16.5/25, which is 33/50.

Wait, 0.66 is 66/100 = 33/50.

Similarly, 0.3 is 3/10.

Similarly, T is at (1.06, 0.3), which is 1 + 6/100 = 1 + 3/50.

So, maybe exact coordinates are fractions.

Therefore, let's consider exact fractions.

Let me write down:

- Q(0,0)
- R(1,0)
- P(11/10, 1/2)
- S(33/50, 3/10)
- T(1 + 3/50, 3/10) = (53/50, 3/10)

So, in exact fractions:

- P: (11/10, 1/2)
- S: (33/50, 3/10)
- T: (53/50, 3/10)
- R: (1,0)

So, vectors:

TS: from T(53/50, 3/10) to S(33/50, 3/10): (33/50 - 53/50, 3/10 - 3/10) = (-20/50, 0) = (-2/5, 0)

TR: from T(53/50, 3/10) to R(1,0): (1 - 53/50, 0 - 3/10) = (7/50, -3/10)

So, vectors:

TS: (-2/5, 0)

TR: (7/50, -3/10)

So, to compute the angle between TS and TR.

Compute the dot product:

(-2/5)(7/50) + (0)(-3/10) = (-14/250) + 0 = -14/250 = -7/125

Compute |TS|:

sqrt( (-2/5)^2 + 0^2 ) = sqrt(4/25) = 2/5

Compute |TR|:

sqrt( (7/50)^2 + (-3/10)^2 ) = sqrt(49/2500 + 9/100) = sqrt(49/2500 + 225/2500) = sqrt(274/2500) = sqrt(274)/50

So, cos(theta) = (dot product) / (|TS| |TR| )

So, cos(theta) = (-7/125) / ( (2/5)(sqrt(274)/50) )

Simplify denominator:

(2/5)(sqrt(274)/50) = (2 sqrt(274)) / 250 = (sqrt(274))/125

Therefore,

cos(theta) = (-7/125) / (sqrt(274)/125) = (-7)/sqrt(274)

So, cos(theta) = -7/sqrt(274)

But wait, this is negative, which would mean the angle is greater than 90 degrees.

Wait, but in the diagram, angle STR is between two lines going from T to S and T to R.

Given the coordinates, point S is to the left of T, and R is below T.

So, the angle between TS (left) and TR (down-left) is actually greater than 90 degrees.

Wait, but earlier when I computed with approximate coordinates, I got about 79 degrees, which is acute.

Hmm, this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the vector direction.

Wait, vector TS is from T to S: (-2/5, 0)

Vector TR is from T to R: (7/50, -3/10)

Therefore, the angle between (-2/5, 0) and (7/50, -3/10)

Wait, but in reality, the angle at T is the angle between incoming vectors, but in terms of the angle between the vectors as defined.

But since vectors can have direction, the angle between them is the smallest angle between them.

But given that, if the dot product is negative, the angle is obtuse.

But in the coordinate system, from T, going left to S and down-left to R, so the angle between them is actually greater than 90 degrees.

Wait, let me calculate.

cos(theta) = -7/sqrt(274) ≈ -7/16.552 ≈ -0.423

Therefore, theta ≈ arccos(-0.423) ≈ 115 degrees

Wait, that's conflicting with the approximate calculation earlier.

Wait, wait, no.

Wait, in the approximate calculation, I considered vectors:

TS: (-0.4, 0)

TR: (-0.06, -0.3)

But in exact fractions:

TS: (-2/5, 0) = (-0.4, 0)

TR: (7/50, -3/10) = (0.14, -0.3)

Wait, so TR is (0.14, -0.3), not (-0.06, -0.3). Wait, earlier I thought TR was (-0.06, -0.3), but in exact fractions, it's (7/50, -3/10) which is (0.14, -0.3)

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, point T is at (1.06, 0.3), so from T(1.06, 0.3) to R(1,0): (1 - 1.06, 0 - 0.3) = (-0.06, -0.3). So, why in exact fractions, it's (7/50, -3/10)?

Wait, 7/50 is 0.14, but 1 - 53/50 = (50/50 - 53/50)= -3/50= -0.06

Wait, no, 53/50 is 1.06, so 1 - 53/50 = -3/50= -0.06.

Wait, but (7/50, -3/10) is (0.14, -0.3), which is different.

Wait, so what is the exact vector?

From T(53/50, 3/10) to R(1,0):

x-component: 1 - 53/50 = (50/50 - 53/50) = -3/50

y-component: 0 - 3/10 = -3/10

So, vector TR is (-3/50, -3/10), which is (-0.06, -0.3)

But earlier, I thought it was (7/50, -3/10). So, that was a mistake.

So, correcting that:

Vector TR is (-3/50, -3/10) = (-0.06, -0.3)

Therefore, vectors:

TS: (-2/5, 0) = (-0.4, 0)

TR: (-0.06, -0.3)

So, the angle between (-0.4, 0) and (-0.06, -0.3)

So, let's compute the dot product:

(-0.4)(-0.06) + (0)(-0.3) = 0.024 + 0 = 0.024

|TS| = 0.4

|TR| = sqrt( (-0.06)^2 + (-0.3)^2 ) = sqrt(0.0036 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.0936) = 0.306

Therefore,

cos(theta) = 0.024 / (0.4 * 0.306) = 0.024 / 0.1224 ≈ 0.196

Therefore, theta ≈ arccos(0.196) ≈ 78.8 degrees

So, approximately 79 degrees.

Earlier confusion was due to miscalculating vector TR.

Therefore, the angle at T is approximately 79 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of angle STR is approximately 79 degrees.

But since in exact terms, it's arccos(0.196), which is approximately 78.8 degrees, which is roughly 79 degrees.

But since the problem is likely expecting an integer, I think 80 degrees.

But let me think again.

Wait, in the problem, angles are given as 40 and 35, both integers, so the answer is likely an integer.

Given that, 79 is close to 80, but is 79 the exact value?

Alternatively, maybe 80 degrees.

Wait, but according to calculation, it's approximately 78.8, which is 79.

But perhaps, in the problem, it's exactly 80 degrees because of some properties.

Wait, thinking differently, since ST is parallel to QR, and considering the triangle PQR, which has angles 40, 35, 105.

Since ST || QR, the triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR.

Therefore, the angles are preserved.

So, in triangle PST, angle at P is 40, angle at S is 35, angle at T is 105.

Therefore, in triangle STR, we might have some relations.

Wait, since triangle STR is connected to triangle PST.

Wait, if I can find some relationship.

Wait, since ST || QR, and S is on PQ, then maybe the ratio of PS to PQ is equal to PT to PR.

But without lengths, it's difficult.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines.

In triangle PST:

PS / sin(105) = PT / sin(35) = ST / sin(40)

Similarly, in triangle PQR:

PQ / sin(105) = PR / sin(40) = QR / sin(35)

But since ST || QR, the ratio PS / PQ = PT / PR

Therefore, PS / PQ = PT / PR

So, let me denote PS = x, PQ = x + QS

PR = y, PT = y - TR

But without knowing QS or TR, it's difficult.

Alternatively, maybe express in terms of the ratio.

Let me denote k = PS / PQ = PT / PR

Therefore, in triangle PST, PS = k * PQ, PT = k * PR

Then, in triangle PQR, sides are PQ, PR, QR.

Therefore, in triangle PST and PQR, sides are proportional by k.

But without knowing k, we can't find exact lengths.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio can be connected to the angle STR.

Wait, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle STR.

But without knowing sides, hard to compute.

Alternatively, maybe the angle STR is equal to angle PQR, which is 35 degrees, but that seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps angle STR is equal to angle PQR + angle Q, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach.

Since ST || QR, then the angle between ST and SR is equal to the angle between QR and something.

Wait, at point R, angle PQR is 35 degrees.

But since ST || QR, the angle between SR and ST is equal to angle between SR and QR.

But angle between SR and QR is equal to angle at R, which is 105 degrees.

Wait, no, angle between SR and QR is supplementary to angle at R.

Wait, if I draw line QR, which is the base of triangle PQR, and line SR, which connects S to R.

Then, since ST is parallel to QR, the angle between SR and ST is equal to the angle between SR and QR.

But angle between SR and QR is equal to angle at R, which is 105 degrees.

Wait, but if angle between SR and QR is 105 degrees, then angle between SR and ST is also 105 degrees.

But ST is parallel to QR, so the angle between SR and ST is equal to the angle between SR and QR.

Wait, which is 105 degrees.

But angle STR is the angle at T between S, T, R.

Which is different.

Wait, in triangle STR, angle at T is angle between TS and TR.

Earlier calculation shows it's approximately 79 degrees.

But now, using the fact that angle between SR and ST is 105 degrees, which is angle between SR and ST.

But angle STR is at T, which is different.

Wait, maybe using the triangle STR, with angle at T as 79 degrees, angle at S is something, angle at R is something.

Wait, but without more info, can't compute.

Alternatively, maybe triangle STR is similar to some other triangle.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in triangle PST, angle at S is 35 degrees, which is equal to angle at R in triangle PQR.

So, perhaps angle STR is 35 degrees.

But that's inconsistent with the coordinate calculation.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, in triangle PST, angle at S is 35 degrees, which is equal to angle at Q in triangle PQR.

But angle at S in triangle PST is also angle between PS and ST, which is 35 degrees.

But angle STR is the angle between ST and TR.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe angle STR is equal to angle PQR, which is 35 degrees, but according to the coordinate calculation, it's 79 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe 180 - 35 - something.

Wait, without knowing the other angles, not helpful.

Wait, but in triangle STR, the sum of angles is 180, so angle at T is theta, angle at S is phi, angle at R is psi.

But without knowing phi or psi, can't compute theta.

Wait, another idea.

Since ST is parallel to QR, the triangle STR is similar to triangle QRT or something.

Wait, not sure.

Wait, maybe using the concept of corresponding angles.

Since ST || QR, the angle between ST and SR is equal to the angle between QR and something.

Wait, at point R, the angle between QR and something.

Wait, angle between QR and PR is angle PQR, which is 35 degrees.

So, since ST || QR, the angle between ST and PR is equal to angle PQR, which is 35 degrees.

Wait, but PR is a different line.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, since ST || QR, the angle between ST and SR is equal to the angle between QR and something.

Wait, maybe angle between ST and SR is equal to angle between QR and the transversal SR.

Wait, but since ST || QR, the corresponding angles are equal.

Therefore, angle between ST and SR is equal to angle between QR and the transversal SR.

But angle between QR and SR is equal to angle at R, which is 105 degrees.

Wait, but that's the same as angle between QR and SR is 105 degrees.

But since ST || QR, angle between ST and SR is also 105 degrees.

But in triangle STR, angle at S is between ST and SR, which is 105 degrees.

Wait, but according to the coordinate calculation, angle at S is 35 degrees.

Wait, confusion.

Wait, in triangle PST, angle at S is 35 degrees, which is angle between PS and ST.

But in triangle STR, angle at S is between ST and SR, which is different.

Therefore, angle at S in triangle STR is different.

So, maybe 105 degrees?

Wait, but according to the coordinate system, in triangle STR, angle at S was angle between ST and SR, which was angle between vectors (-0.4, 0) and (-0.06, -0.3), which was approximately 79 degrees.

So, 79 degrees.

Wait, which is approximately 80 degrees.

Therefore, I think the answer is 80 degrees.

But why did the coordinate calculation give 79 degrees?

Maybe due to decimal approximations.

Alternatively, maybe the exact calculation is 80 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the direction of vectors.

Wait, in the coordinate system, from point S(33/50, 3/10) to T(53/50, 3/10), which is to the right, so vector ST is (20/50, 0) = (0.4, 0)

From T(53/50, 3/10) to R(1,0), which is to the left and down, vector TR is (-3/50, -3/10) = (-0.06, -0.3)

So, vector ST is (0.4, 0), vector TR is (-0.06, -0.3)

Therefore, angle between ST and TR is angle at T.

So, compute the angle between vectors ST and TR.

Vector ST: (0.4, 0)

Vector TR: (-0.06, -0.3)

So, dot product: (0.4)(-0.06) + (0)(-0.3) = -0.024 + 0 = -0.024

Wait, earlier, I thought it was positive 0.024, but actually, it's negative.

Wait, so cos(theta) = (-0.024) / (|ST| |TR| )

|ST| = 0.4

|TR| = sqrt( (-0.06)^2 + (-0.3)^2 ) = sqrt(0.0036 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.0936) = 0.306

So, cos(theta) = (-0.024) / (0.4 * 0.306) = (-0.024) / 0.1224 ≈ -0.196

Therefore, theta ≈ arccos(-0.196) ≈ 101 degrees

Wait, wait a minute, this is conflicting with the previous calculation.

Wait, in the first calculation, I thought vector TS is (-0.4, 0), but actually, vector ST is (0.4, 0). So, the angle between ST and TR is different.

Wait, so in reality, vectors ST and TR are (0.4, 0) and (-0.06, -0.3), so the angle between them is arccos(-0.196) ≈ 101 degrees.

But that's different from the previous calculation where I thought angle was 79 degrees.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, in the coordinate system, point S is to the left of T, and point R is below T.

So, from T, going to S is to the left, and going to R is down-left.

So, the angle between left and down-left is measured as the angle between vectors (-0.4, 0) and (-0.06, -0.3), which is approximately 79 degrees.

But in reality, vector ST is from S to T: (0.4, 0), and vector TR is from T to R: (-0.06, -0.3)

Therefore, the angle between ST and TR is the angle between (0.4, 0) and (-0.06, -0.3), which is 101 degrees.

But in the problem, angle STR is the angle at T between S, T, R, which is the angle between incoming vectors ST and RT.

Wait, so from T, vector TS is (-0.4, 0) and vector TR is (-0.06, -0.3)

Therefore, the angle between vectors TS and TR is the angle at T, which is approximately 79 degrees.

But if I compute the angle between vectors ST and RT, which is the same as vectors TS and TR, it's 79 degrees.

But when I computed the angle between vectors ST and TR, which are (0.4, 0) and (-0.06, -0.3), I get 101 degrees.

But in the problem, angle STR is the internal angle at T between S, T, R.

Therefore, it's the angle between vectors TS and TR, which is 79 degrees.

Therefore, the measure is approximately 79 degrees.

So, why did I get 101 degrees when computing the angle between ST and TR?

Because I was computing the angle between outgoing vectors, which is different from the internal angle.

Therefore, in reality, angle STR is approximately 79 degrees.

So, rounding to the nearest degree, it's 80 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of angle STR is 80 degrees.

But wait, according to the exact calculation, it's approximately 78.8 degrees, which is closer to 79.

But in the problem, it's likely that the answer is 80 degrees, due to the construction.

Alternatively, maybe 75 degrees, but that's not close.

Wait, but 78.8 is closer to 79, so 79 degrees.

But 79 is a prime number, so it's unlikely to be a whole number unless it's 80.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are given as decimals, so maybe the angle is 80 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe 80 degrees is the correct answer.

Wait, since the problem is given with angles 35 and 40, which are both divisible by 5, maybe the answer is also a multiple of 5, like 75 or 80.

But 78.8 is closer to 79, but since I think the answer is 80 degrees, due to the problem's constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 85 degrees.

Wait, but no, 85 is too high.

Alternatively, maybe 35 degrees.

Wait, no, that's too low.

Alternatively, maybe 55 degrees.

But 55 is 40 + 15, but not sure.

Wait, no, 79 is the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe 65 degrees.

But 65 is less than 79.

Alternatively, maybe 70 degrees.

But no.

Wait, maybe 75 degrees.

Wait, 75 is a common angle.

Wait, but in the coordinate calculation, it's 78.8, so 79.

Alternatively, maybe 80 degrees.

But since in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are given as decimals, 0.66, 0.3, 1.06, 0.3, which are all fractions with denominator 10 or 50.

Therefore, the angle would be a rational multiple.

Wait, but 78.8 is approximately 79 degrees.

Therefore, I think the answer is 80 degrees.

But since the calculation is approximately 79 degrees, maybe it's 80 degrees.

Alternatively, since in the problem, angles are 35 and 40, the answer is likely 80 degrees, as it's the sum of 35 and 45, but no.

Wait, 35 and 40, perhaps 75.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 55 degrees.

Wait, no, 55 is 40 + 15.

Alternatively, perhaps 45 degrees.

But that's too low.

Wait, perhaps 70 degrees.

No, 70 is 40 + 30.

Alternatively, 75 degrees.

Wait, 75 is a common angle, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe 80 degrees.

But in the calculation, it's 78.8, which is 79.

But perhaps, the problem is expecting 80 degrees.

Therefore, I think the answer is 80 degrees.

But, to make sure, in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are given as decimals, which could result in a rounded angle.

Therefore, in the problem, it's likely 80 degrees.

But since in the exact calculation, it's 78.8, which is closer to 79, but since 80 is the nearest whole number, maybe that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the vector direction.

Wait, let me think.

From point T, vectors to S and to R.

From T(53/50, 3/10) to S(33/50, 3/10): vector (-20/50, 0) = (-0.4, 0)

From T to R: (1 - 53/50, 0 - 3/10) = (7/50, -3/10) ≈ (0.14, -0.3)

Wait, so vectors from T are (-0.4, 0) and (0.14, -0.3)

Wait, then, the angle between (-0.4, 0) and (0.14, -0.3) is different.

Wait, so vectors:

TS: (-0.4, 0)

TR: (0.14, -0.3)

Dot product: (-0.4)(0.14) + (0)(-0.3) = -0.056 + 0 = -0.056

|TS| = 0.4

|TR| = sqrt(0.14^2 + (-0.3)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0196 + 0.09) ≈ sqrt(0.1096) ≈ 0.331

Therefore, cos(theta) = (-0.056)/(0.4 * 0.331) ≈ (-0.056)/(0.1324) ≈ -0.423

Therefore, theta ≈ arccos(-0.423) ≈ 115 degrees

Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation.

Wait, now I'm really confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm using vectors from T to S and T to R, but in reality, the angle at T is between incoming vectors ST and RT.

So, ST is from S to T: (0.4, 0)

RT is from R to T: (-7/50, 3/10) ≈ (-0.14, 0.3)

So, vectors:

ST: (0.4, 0)

RT: (-0.14, 0.3)

So, angle between vectors (0.4, 0) and (-0.14, 0.3)

Compute the dot product:

(0.4)(-0.14) + (0)(0.3) = -0.056 + 0 = -0.056

|ST| = 0.4

|RT| = sqrt( (-0.14)^2 + 0.3^2 ) = sqrt(0.0196 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.1096) ≈ 0.331

Therefore, cos(theta) = (-0.056)/(0.4 * 0.331) ≈ (-0.056)/(0.1324) ≈ -0.423

Therefore, theta ≈ 115 degrees

Wait, that's different.

Wait, so depending on which vectors I use, I get different angles.

Wait, so the key is that the angle at T is between incoming vectors: from S to T and from R to T.

Therefore, vectors are ST and RT.

So, vectors:

ST: from S to T: (0.4, 0)

RT: from R to T: (-0.14, 0.3)

Therefore, the angle between (0.4, 0) and (-0.14, 0.3) is 115 degrees.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave me 78 degrees.

Wait, this is very confusing.

Wait, let me recap.

In the Asymptote code, the points are:

- P(1.1, 0.5)

- S(0.66, 0.3)

- T(1.06, 0.3)

- R(1, 0)

So, vectors:

From T(1.06, 0.3):

- To S: (0.66 - 1.06, 0.3 - 0.3) = (-0.4, 0)

- To R: (1 - 1.06, 0 - 0.3) = (-0.06, -0.3)

So, vectors TS: (-0.4, 0) and TR: (-0.06, -0.3)

Dot product: (-0.4)(-0.06) + (0)(-0.3) = 0.024 + 0 = 0.024

|TS| = 0.4

|TR| = sqrt(0.0036 + 0.09) = 0.306

Therefore, cos(theta) = 0.024 / (0.4 * 0.306) ≈ 0.196

Thus, theta ≈ 78.8 degrees.

Therefore, angle STR is approximately 79 degrees.

But when I take vectors from S to T and R to T, I get a different angle.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the angle at T is determined by the incoming vectors, so from S to T and from R to T.

Therefore, vectors are ST and RT, which are (0.4, 0) and (-0.14, 0.3)

Dot product: 0.4*(-0.14) + 0*0.3 = -0.056

|ST| = 0.4

|RT| ≈ 0.331

cos(theta) ≈ -0.423

theta ≈ 115 degrees

But in reality, the angle at T is the internal angle between the two lines TS and TR, which is 79 degrees.

Wait, but in reality, how?

Wait, the angle between two lines is determined by the smallest angle between them.

Therefore, whether the angle is acute or obtuse, it's the smallest one.

Therefore, in this case, the angle between vectors TS and TR is 79 degrees, which is acute, and the angle between vectors ST and RT is 115 degrees, which is obtuse.

Therefore, the internal angle at T is 79 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of angle STR is approximately 79 degrees.

Since the problem is likely constructed with integer angles, 79 is close to 80, but 79 is also acceptable.

Therefore, I think the answer is 79 degrees.

But perhaps the exact calculation is 80 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe the exact answer is 80 degrees.

But according to the precise calculation, it's 79 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are approximate, so maybe the exact answer is 80 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe 75 degrees.

But since 79 is closer to 80, I think 80 degrees is acceptable.

Wait, but in the calculation, it's 79 degrees.

Therefore, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's 35 degrees, but that's inconsistent with coordinate calculation.

Alternatively, maybe 40 degrees.

But in the coordinate calculation, it's 79 degrees.

Therefore, I think 80 degrees is the closest.

Alternatively, maybe 75 degrees.

But, in the problem, with given angles 35 and 40, the answer is likely 80 degrees.

Therefore, I think 80 degrees is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{80}

Given the problem where we need to find the measure of angle \( \angle STR \) in the diagram, we know that \( \angle P = 40^\circ \) and \( \angle Q = 35^\circ \). Segments \( \overline{ST} \parallel \overline{QR} \).

1. **Triangle \( PQR \) Calculation**:
   - The sum of angles in triangle \( PQR \) is \( 180^\circ \).
   - Given \( \angle P = 40^\circ \) and \( \angle Q = 35^\circ \), we find \( \angle R \) as follows:
     \[
     \angle R = 180^\circ - 40^\circ - 35^\circ = 105^\circ
     \]

2. **Using Parallel Lines**:
   - Since \( \overline{ST} \parallel \overline{QR} \), the corresponding angles formed by a transversal are equal.
   - In triangle \( PST \), the angle at \( T \) (corresponding to \( \angle Q \)) is \( 35^\circ \).
   - In triangle \( PST \), the angle at \( S \) (corresponding to \( \angle R \)) is \( 105^\circ \).

3. **Vectors and Dot Product Calculation**:
   - Using coordinates from the Asymptote code, we calculate vectors to find the angle at \( T \).
   - Vectors from \( T \) to \( S \) and \( T \) to \( R \) are calculated.
   - The dot product and magnitudes of these vectors are used to find the cosine of the angle.

4. **Angle Calculation**:
   - Using the dot product formula, we find the angle between vectors \( \overrightarrow{TS} \) and \( \overrightarrow{TR} \).
   - The calculation shows the angle is approximately \( 78.8^\circ \), which rounds to \( 79^\circ \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the problem's context and the likely integer answer, the angle \( \angle STR \) is determined to be approximately \( 80^\circ \).

Thus, the measure of \( \angle STR \) is \(\boxed{80}\) degrees.
