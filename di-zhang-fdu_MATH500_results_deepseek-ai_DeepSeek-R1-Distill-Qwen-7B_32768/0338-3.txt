Correct Answer:
The shaded triangle has a base of length $10\text{ cm}.$ Since the triangle is enclosed in a rectangle of height $3\text{ cm},$ then the height of the triangle is $3\text{ cm}.$ (We know that the enclosing shape is a rectangle, because any figure with four sides, including two pairs of equal opposite sides, and two right angles must be a rectangle.) Therefore, the area of the triangle is $$\frac{1}{2}\times 3 \times 10 = \boxed{15\mbox{ cm}^2}.$$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this Asymptote diagram here, and I need to find the area of the shaded triangle. Let me try to visualize it first. The diagram shows a rectangle with length 10 cm and width 3 cm. On top of this rectangle, there are two triangles drawn, and the shaded area is the triangle connecting the points (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0). Hmm, okay.

First, let me understand the coordinates. The rectangle goes from (0,0) to (10,0) along the x-axis and up to (10,3) and (0,3) on the top. The triangle is formed by connecting (0,0) to (2,3) and then to (10,0), closing the shape back to (0,0). So, it's a triangle that sits on the base of the rectangle, with one vertex at the bottom left corner, another somewhere on the top left, and the third at the bottom right corner.

I remember that the area of a triangle can be found using the formula: 1/2 * base * height. But in this case, it might not be straightforward because the triangle isn't a right triangle or an obvious one. Maybe I can use coordinates to figure out the base and height?

Alternatively, I think the shoelace formula might be useful here. The shoelace formula is a method to calculate the area of a polygon when you know the coordinates of its vertices. For a triangle with vertices at (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3), the formula is:

Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) / 2|

Let me apply that. The points are (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0). Plugging these into the formula:

Area = |(0*(3 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0) + 10*(0 - 3)) / 2|
= |(0 + 0 + 10*(-3)) / 2|
= |( -30 ) / 2|
= | -15 | = 15

So, is the area 15 cm²? Wait, let me make sure I haven't messed up the coordinates or the formula.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the triangle into smaller parts. The rectangle is 10 cm by 3 cm, so its area is 30 cm². The shaded triangle is part of this rectangle, so maybe I can find the areas of the other regions and subtract them?

Looking at the Asymptote code, the diagram is a rectangle with two triangles on top. Wait, actually, the Asymptote code draws the rectangle from (0,0) to (10,0) to (10,3) to (0,3) and back. Then, it draws the triangle (0,0)--(2,3)--(10,0). So, the shaded area is the triangle in question.

But maybe if I consider the entire figure, which is a rectangle, and the triangle is part of it. Maybe I can figure out the area by subtracting the areas of the other parts.

Wait, but the rectangle is 10x3, so 30 cm². The triangle is shaded, but I need to find its area. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by three points.

Wait, let me go back to the shoelace formula because that seems straightforward. Maybe I was right the first time. Let's reapply it step by step.

The coordinates are (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0). Let me list them in order:

(0,0), (2,3), (10,0), and then back to (0,0).

Using the shoelace formula, you multiply each x by the next y, sum them up, subtract the sum of each y multiplied by the next x, take the absolute value, and divide by 2.

So, the first sum (sum of x_i * y_{i+1}):

0*3 + 2*0 + 10*0 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

The second sum (sum of y_i * x_{i+1}):

0*2 + 3*10 + 0*0 = 0 + 30 + 0 = 30

Subtract the second sum from the first: 0 - 30 = -30

Take absolute value: 30

Divide by 2: 30 / 2 = 15

So, the area is 15 cm².

Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because the triangle is on the base of the rectangle, which is 10 cm long, and the height is 3 cm. So, if I thought of it as a triangle with base 10 and height 3, the area would be 1/2 *10*3=15 cm². Oh, that's the same result.

So, actually, maybe it's simpler. The base is 10 cm, the height is 3 cm, so area is 15 cm². So, that confirms it.

But let me make sure: if I have a triangle with base 10 and height 3, is the height indeed perpendicular from the base to the opposite vertex? In this case, the base is from (0,0) to (10,0), which is 10 cm along the x-axis. The opposite vertex is (2,3). The y-coordinate of this vertex is 3, which is the vertical distance from the base. So yes, the height is 3 cm.

Therefore, area is 1/2 * 10 * 3 = 15 cm².

But wait, another thought: the triangle isn't necessarily a right triangle, but in this case, since the base is along the x-axis, and the height is the y-coordinate of the opposite vertex, it is effectively a right triangle. Because the height is vertical, perpendicular to the base.

So, actually, it's a right triangle with legs 10 cm and 3 cm, but wait, no, because the base is 10 cm, and the height is 3 cm, but the third side is not necessarily a leg. Wait, no, in a right triangle, the base and height are perpendicular. Since the base is horizontal and the height is vertical, yes, they are perpendicular. So, actually, this triangle is a right triangle.

Wait, but hold on. Is the triangle (0,0)--(2,3)--(10,0) a right triangle? Let me check.

The sides from (0,0) to (2,3) is a vector of (2,3), and from (0,0) to (10,0) is a vector of (10,0). The dot product between these two vectors is 2*10 + 3*0 = 20, which is not zero, so they are not perpendicular. Therefore, it's not a right triangle.

Hmm, so maybe my initial thought was wrong. It's not a right triangle because the two sides from (0,0) are not perpendicular.

So, then, the area isn't just 1/2 * base * height. Although in this case, the base is 10 cm, and the height is 3 cm, perhaps because the opposite vertex is at y=3.

Wait, no, actually, in general, the area of a triangle is 1/2 * base * height, regardless of whether it's right-angled or not. The height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex. So, in this case, since the base is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (10,0), the height is just the y-coordinate of the opposite vertex, which is (2,3), so 3 cm.

Therefore, the area should be 1/2 * 10 * 3 = 15 cm².

But to verify, let me use the shoelace formula again.

Coordinates: (0,0), (2,3), (10,0)

Calculating shoelace formula:

First, list the points in order and repeat the first point at the end:

(0,0), (2,3), (10,0), (0,0)

Multiply diagonally and sum:

0*3 + 2*0 + 10*0 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

Then, the other diagonal:

0*2 + 3*10 + 0*0 = 0 + 30 + 0 = 30

Subtract: |0 - 30| = 30

Divide by 2: 30 / 2 = 15

So, yes, it's 15 cm².

Alternatively, if I divide the triangle into two parts, maybe? From (0,0) to (2,3) to (10,0). So, maybe from (0,0) to (2,3) is one edge, and (2,3) to (10,0) is another.

Wait, if I split the triangle along the y-axis at x=2, but that's not necessarily helpful. Maybe I can use coordinates to find the area.

Alternatively, another method is to use the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates. The formula is the same as the shoelace formula, so it's consistent.

Alternatively, I can calculate the vectors and use the cross product. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of two sides.

Let me try that.

First, define vectors from (0,0) to (2,3) and from (0,0) to (10,0).

Vector A: (2,3)
Vector B: (10,0)

The cross product in 2D is given by A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x.

So, 2*0 - 3*10 = 0 - 30 = -30

The magnitude is 30, so the area is half of that, which is 15 cm².

So, same result.

Therefore, all methods point to 15 cm².

Wait, but just to make sure, let me think if the triangle is indeed spanning the entire base. The base is 10 cm, but the triangle goes from (0,0) to (10,0), so that's the full base. The height is 3 cm, which is the vertical distance from the base to the opposite vertex at (2,3). So, it's a triangle with base 10 and height 3, so area is 1/2 *10*3=15.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, if I use the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates, which is 1/2 |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))|

Plugging in:

x1=0, y1=0

x2=2, y2=3

x3=10, y3=0

So,

Area = 1/2 |0*(3 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0) + 10*(0 - 3)|

= 1/2 |0 + 0 + (-30)|

= 1/2 * 30 = 15

Yes, 15 cm².

Wait, but just to make sure, because sometimes when coordinates are given, the order of the points can affect the calculation, but as long as I take the absolute value, it should be fine.

So, in this case, no matter the order, as long as I take the absolute value, the area is positive.

Therefore, I think 15 cm² is the correct answer.

But hold on, in the Asymptote code, it draws the rectangle from (0,0) to (10,0) to (10,3) to (0,3), so that's a rectangle of 10x3.

Then, it draws the triangle (0,0)--(2,3)--(10,0)--cycle, which is the shaded area.

So, maybe another way to compute the area is to subtract the areas of the other parts from the rectangle.

The rectangle is 10*3=30 cm².

If I can find the areas of the other two triangles outside the shaded one, then subtract them from 30 to get the shaded area.

Looking at the Asymptote code, it also draws lines from (0,0) to (2,3) and (2,3) to (10,0). So, the rectangle is divided into three parts: the shaded triangle, and two smaller triangles.

Wait, let's see: the rectangle has four sides. The shaded triangle is from (0,0) to (2,3) to (10,0). So, it's a triangle that covers part of the rectangle. Then, the other areas are the two triangles on the sides.

Wait, actually, when you draw a triangle across the rectangle from (0,0) to (2,3) to (10,0), you divide the rectangle into three regions: the shaded triangle, and two smaller triangles on the sides.

So, to find the shaded area, maybe I can calculate the area of the rectangle, subtract the areas of the two smaller triangles.

So, let me calculate the areas of the two smaller triangles.

First, the triangle on the left: it's from (0,0) to (0,3) to (2,3). Wait, no, the lines are drawn from (0,0) to (2,3), so the triangle on the left is actually from (0,0) to (0,3) to (2,3). Wait, but (0,0) to (2,3) is a diagonal.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

If I draw a line from (0,0) to (2,3), then the area below that line in the rectangle is a trapezoid, but maybe it's a triangle.

Wait, no, the line from (0,0) to (2,3) is actually outside the rectangle? Wait, (2,3) is a point on the top side of the rectangle, which goes from (0,3) to (10,3). So, (2,3) is somewhere along the top edge.

So, drawing a line from (0,0) to (2,3) divides the rectangle into two parts: a triangle on the left and a quadrilateral on the right. Similarly, drawing a line from (2,3) to (10,0) divides the rectangle into another triangle on the right and a quadrilateral on the left.

Wait, but actually, both lines are being drawn, so the shaded triangle is in the middle.

Wait, maybe it's better to calculate the areas of the two smaller triangles outside the shaded one.

So, the rectangle is divided into three parts: the shaded triangle, and two smaller triangles on the sides.

So, the two smaller triangles are:

1. The triangle from (0,0) to (0,3) to (2,3). Wait, but (0,0) to (2,3) is a diagonal, so the triangle is actually a right triangle with base 2 and height 3.

Wait, if I consider the triangle on the left, it is bounded by (0,0), (0,3), and (2,3). So, it's a right triangle with legs 2 and 3.

So, area is 1/2 *2*3=3 cm².

Similarly, the triangle on the right is from (2,3) to (10,3) to (10,0). So, that's another triangle.

But wait, (10,3) to (10,0) is the right side of the rectangle, and (2,3) to (10,3) is the top edge. So, the triangle on the right is from (2,3) to (10,3) to (10,0). Hmm, is that a triangle?

Wait, (2,3) to (10,3) is a horizontal line, and (10,3) to (10,0) is a vertical line. So, the figure formed is a right triangle with legs of length (10-2)=8 and 3.

Therefore, area is 1/2 *8*3=12 cm².

So, the two smaller triangles have areas 3 cm² and 12 cm².

Therefore, the area of the shaded triangle is the area of the rectangle minus these two areas.

Total area of rectangle: 10*3=30 cm²

Subtract the two smaller triangles: 30 - 3 -12=15 cm²

So, same result.

Therefore, using two different methods, shoelace formula and subtracting areas, I get 15 cm².

Therefore, I can be confident that the area is 15 cm².

**Final Answer**
The area of the shaded triangle is \boxed{15} square centimeters.
</think>

To find the area of the shaded triangle with vertices at \((0,0)\), \((2,3)\), and \((10,0)\), we can use the shoelace formula. The shoelace formula for the area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]

Plugging in the coordinates \((0,0)\), \((2,3)\), and \((10,0)\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(3 - 0) + 2(0 - 0) + 10(0 - 3) \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + 0 - 30 \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| -30 \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15
\]

Thus, the area of the shaded triangle is \(\boxed{15}\) square centimeters.
