Correct Answer:
The shaded triangle has a base of length $10\text{ cm}.$ Since the triangle is enclosed in a rectangle of height $3\text{ cm},$ then the height of the triangle is $3\text{ cm}.$ (We know that the enclosing shape is a rectangle, because any figure with four sides, including two pairs of equal opposite sides, and two right angles must be a rectangle.) Therefore, the area of the triangle is $$\frac{1}{2}\times 3 \times 10 = \boxed{15\mbox{ cm}^2}.$$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to find the area of this shaded triangle in the diagram. Hmm, let me see. The Asymptote code draws a rectangle with length 10 cm and width 3 cm. Inside this rectangle, there's a diagonal line connecting three points: (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0). So, the triangle is formed by these three points. 

First, I remember that the area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: (base * height) / 2. But in this case, since it's a triangle within a coordinate plane, maybe I can use the coordinates to find the area more accurately. I recall there's a formula called the shoelace formula which can calculate the area of a polygon when the coordinates of its vertices are known. 

Let me write down the coordinates of the triangle's vertices: (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0). So, plugging these into the shoelace formula. The formula is:

Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) / 2|

Let me assign the points: let (x1, y1) be (0,0), (x2, y2) be (2,3), and (x3, y3) be (10,0).

Plugging these into the formula:

Area = |(0*(3 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0) + 10*(0 - 3)) / 2|
= |(0 + 0 + 10*(-3)) / 2|
= |(0 + 0 - 30) / 2|
= |-30 / 2|
= | -15 | 
= 15 cm².

Wait, is that correct? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check using another method to make sure. Maybe I can find the base and height of the triangle.

Looking at the triangle, one of its sides is along the base of the rectangle from (0,0) to (10,0), so that's 10 cm. But is this the base of the triangle? If I take this as the base, I need to find the corresponding height. The height would be the perpendicular distance from the opposite vertex, which is (2,3), to the base.

So, the base is 10 cm. The height is the y-coordinate of the point (2,3), which is 3 cm. So, plugging into the area formula:

Area = (base * height) / 2
= (10 * 3) / 2
= 30 / 2
= 15 cm².

Hmm, that's the same result as before. So, it seems consistent.

Alternatively, I can also break down the figure into simpler shapes. The rectangle has an area of length * width = 10 cm * 3 cm = 30 cm². Maybe the triangle is occupying a portion of this area. But actually, since it's a triangle inside the rectangle, not necessarily dividing it into equal parts, maybe that's not the best approach. 

Wait, another thought: if I can find the equations of the lines forming the triangle and then determine the base and height, that might work. The triangle has three sides: from (0,0) to (2,3), from (2,3) to (10,0), and from (10,0) back to (0,0). 

Let me find the equation of the line from (0,0) to (2,3). The slope (m) would be (3 - 0)/(2 - 0) = 3/2. So, the equation is y = (3/2)x.

Similarly, the line from (2,3) to (10,0). The slope (m) is (0 - 3)/(10 - 2) = (-3)/8. So, the equation is y - 3 = (-3/8)(x - 2). Let me simplify that:

y = (-3/8)x + (6/8) + 3
= (-3/8)x + (3/4) + 3
= (-3/8)x + 3.75.

And the line from (10,0) back to (0,0) is just the x-axis, y = 0.

If I can find the height of the triangle with respect to the base (0,0) to (10,0), which is 10 cm, then the height is the maximum y-value of the triangle, which is 3 cm at point (2,3). So, the area is (10 * 3)/2 = 15 cm², same as before.

Just to make sure, maybe I can use vectors or coordinate geometry. The area of a triangle can also be calculated using the determinant method. The formula is:

Area = (1/2)| (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) |

Which is essentially the shoelace formula again. Plugging in the points:

(0*(3 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0) + 10*(0 - 3)) / 2
= (0 + 0 - 30)/2
= |-15| = 15 cm².

Okay, so all methods point to 15 cm². But let me visualize the triangle to ensure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the Asymptote code. The Asymptote code draws a rectangle from (0,0) to (10,0) to (10,3) to (0,3) and back. Then it draws the lines from (0,0) to (2,3) to (10,0) and back to (0,0). So, yeah, the triangle is indeed connecting (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0). So, that's a non-right triangle, but the area calculations still hold.

Wait, one more thing: could the area be more than half of the rectangle? The rectangle is 30 cm², so half would be 15 cm². Since the triangle is connecting opposite corners, maybe it's exactly half? Hmm, but in this case, the triangle is not spanning the entire rectangle. It's connecting (0,0) to (2,3) to (10,0). So, it's a triangle that's on one side of the rectangle, but not exactly half.

Wait, but in the calculations, it's still 15 cm², which is half of the rectangle's area. That seems coincidental or maybe it's actually correct. Let me think: if you have a rectangle, and you draw a diagonal from (0,0) to (10,3), that would divide the rectangle into two triangles, each with area 15 cm². But in this case, the triangle is not a diagonal, but this other triangle connecting (0,0), (2,3), (10,0). Hmm.

Wait, maybe since the point (2,3) is two-fifths along the length from (0,0) to (10,0). So, maybe the area is proportionally related. Hmm, but in any case, the area calculation via multiple methods gave me 15 cm², so maybe that's just the way it is.

Alternatively, if I plot the points: (0,0), (2,3), (10,0). So, the base is from (0,0) to (10,0), which is 10 units long. The height is the maximum y-value, which is 3 units, so area is 15 cm². That's consistent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps using vectors. If I consider vectors from (0,0) to (2,3) and from (0,0) to (10,0), then the area is half the magnitude of their cross product.

So, vector a = (2,3), vector b = (10,0). The cross product is (2*0 - 3*10) = -30. The magnitude is 30, so area is 30/2 = 15 cm². Yeah, that works too.

So, in all these different methods—shoelace formula, base-height, determinant, vectors—the area consistently comes out to 15 cm². So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The area of the shaded triangle is \boxed{15} square centimeters.
</think>

To find the area of the shaded triangle with vertices at \((0,0)\), \((2,3)\), and \((10,0)\), we can use the shoelace formula. The coordinates of the vertices are \((0,0)\), \((2,3)\), and \((10,0)\).

Using the shoelace formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]
Substituting the coordinates:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(3 - 0) + 2(0 - 0) + 10(0 - 3) \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + 0 - 30 \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| -30 \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ cm}^2
\]

We can also verify this using the base and height method. The base is 10 cm (from \((0,0)\) to \((10,0)\)) and the height is 3 cm (the y-coordinate of the point \((2,3)\)). Thus, the area is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 3 = 15 \text{ cm}^2
\]

Both methods confirm that the area of the shaded triangle is \(\boxed{15}\) square centimeters.
