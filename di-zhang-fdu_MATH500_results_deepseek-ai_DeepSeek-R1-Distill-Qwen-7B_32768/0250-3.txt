Question:
The function $f$ satisfies the functional equation
\[f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1\]for all real numbers $x$ and $y.$  If $f(1) = 1,$ then find all integers $n$ such that $f(n) = n.$  Enter all such integers, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
Setting $x = y = 0,$ we get
\[2f(0) = f(0) - 1,\]so $f(0) = -1.$

Setting $y = 1,$ we get
\[f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1,\]so
\[f(x + 1) - f(x) = x + 2.\]Thus,
\begin{align*}
f(2) - f(1) &= 1 + 2, \\
f(3) - f(2) &= 2 + 2, \\
f(4) - f(3) &= 3 + 2, \\
&\dots, \\
f(n) - f(n - 1) &= (n - 1) + 2.
\end{align*}Adding all the equations, we get
\[f(n) - f(1) = 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + (n - 1) + 2(n - 1) = \frac{(n - 1)n}{2} + 2n - 2 = \frac{n^2 + 3n - 4}{2},\]so
\[f(n) = \frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2}\]for all positive integers $n.$

Setting $x = -n$ and $y = n,$ where $n$ is a positive integer, we get
\[f(-n) + f(n) = f(0) + n^2 - 1.\]Then
\[f(-n) = n^2 - f(n) + f(0) - 1 = n^2 - \frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2} - 2 = \frac{n^2 - 3n - 2}{2}.\]Thus, the formula
\[f(n) = \frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2}\]holds for all integers $n.$

We want to solve $f(n) = n,$ or
\[\frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2} = n.\]Then $n^2 + 3n - 2 = 2n,$ or $n^2 + n - 2 = 0.$  This factors as $(n - 1)(n + 2) = 0,$ so the solutions are $n = \boxed{1,-2}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this functional equation: \( f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 \) for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \). And I know that \( f(1) = 1 \). I need to find all integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \). Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, functional equations often require us to make smart substitutions for \( x \) and \( y \) to find a general form of the function \( f \). Maybe I can plug in specific values for \( x \) and \( y \) to simplify the equation and figure out what \( f \) looks like.

Let me try setting \( x = 0 \) and see what happens. Plugging in, we get:

\( f(0) + f(y) = f(0 + y) - 0 \cdot y - 1 \)

Simplifying that, the right-hand side becomes \( f(y) - 0 - 1 = f(y) - 1 \). So the equation is:

\( f(0) + f(y) = f(y) - 1 \)

Subtracting \( f(y) \) from both sides, we get:

\( f(0) = -1 \)

Alright, so we found that \( f(0) = -1 \). That's useful information.

Next, maybe I can find \( f(2) \) in terms of \( f(1) \). Let me set \( x = y = 1 \). Plugging into the equation:

\( f(1) + f(1) = f(1 + 1) - 1 \cdot 1 - 1 \)

Simplifying, that's \( 1 + 1 = f(2) - 1 - 1 \), so:

\( 2 = f(2) - 2 \)

Adding 2 to both sides, \( f(2) = 4 \).

Hmm, okay, so \( f(2) = 4 \). That's more information. Maybe I can see a pattern here. Let me compute \( f(3) \) as well, using \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 1 \):

\( f(2) + f(1) = f(3) - 2 \cdot 1 - 1 \)

Plugging in the known values, \( 4 + 1 = f(3) - 2 - 1 \), so:

\( 5 = f(3) - 3 \)

Adding 3 to both sides, \( f(3) = 8 \).

Wait, so \( f(1) = 1 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), \( f(3) = 8 \). Is that a pattern? It seems like \( f(n) = n^2 \) for these values. Let's test it for \( n = 4 \) to see if the pattern holds.

Compute \( f(4) \) using \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 1 \):

\( f(3) + f(1) = f(4) - 3 \cdot 1 - 1 \)

Plugging in, \( 8 + 1 = f(4) - 3 - 1 \), so:

\( 9 = f(4) - 4 \)

Adding 4, \( f(4) = 13 \). Wait, that's not \( 16 \). Hmm, so the pattern breaks at \( n = 4 \). So my initial guess isn't quite right. Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me try to figure out the general form of \( f(x) \). Since functional equations often require assuming a form and solving for coefficients, maybe I can guess that \( f(x) \) is a quadratic function. Let's suppose that \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants. Then I can plug this into the functional equation and solve for the coefficients.

Let's compute both sides of the equation:

Left-hand side: \( f(x) + f(y) = a x^2 + b x + c + a y^2 + b y + c = a(x^2 + y^2) + b(x + y) + 2c \)

Right-hand side: \( f(x + y) - x y - 1 = a(x + y)^2 + b(x + y) + c - x y - 1 \)

Expanding \( f(x + y) \), we get:

\( a(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) + b(x + y) + c - xy - 1 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( a x^2 + 2a x y + a y^2 + b x + b y + c - x y - 1 \)

Now, let's set the left-hand side equal to the right-hand side:

\( a(x^2 + y^2) + b(x + y) + 2c = a x^2 + 2a x y + a y^2 + b x + b y + c - x y - 1 \)

Simplify both sides:

Left-hand side: \( a x^2 + a y^2 + b x + b y + 2c \)

Right-hand side: \( a x^2 + a y^2 + 2a x y + b x + b y + c - x y - 1 \)

Now, subtract the left-hand side from both sides to bring everything to one side:

0 = (Right-hand side) - (Left-hand side)

So,

0 = [a x^2 + a y^2 + 2a x y + b x + b y + c - x y - 1] - [a x^2 + a y^2 + b x + b y + 2c]

Simplify term by term:

- \( a x^2 - a x^2 = 0 \)
- \( a y^2 - a y^2 = 0 \)
- \( 2a x y - 0 = 2a x y \)
- \( b x - b x = 0 \)
- \( b y - b y = 0 \)
- \( c - 2c = -c \)
- \( -x y - 0 = -x y \)
- \( -1 - 0 = -1 \)

Putting it all together:

0 = (2a x y) - c - x y - 1

So,

0 = (2a - 1) x y - c - 1

This equation must hold for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \). Therefore, the coefficients of \( x y \) and the constant term must both be zero.

Thus, we have the system of equations:

1. Coefficient of \( x y \): \( 2a - 1 = 0 \)
2. Constant term: \( -c - 1 = 0 \)

Solving equation 1:

\( 2a - 1 = 0 \) implies \( a = \frac{1}{2} \)

Solving equation 2:

\( -c - 1 = 0 \) implies \( c = -1 \)

So, we have \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( c = -1 \). We still need to find \( b \). For this, we can use the given information that \( f(1) = 1 \).

Compute \( f(1) \):

\( f(1) = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = a + b + c \)

We know \( f(1) = 1 \), so:

\( \frac{1}{2} + b - 1 = 1 \)

Simplify:

\( -\frac{1}{2} + b = 1 \)

Adding \( \frac{1}{2} \) to both sides:

\( b = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \)

Therefore, the function is:

\( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 \)

Let me check if this function satisfies the original functional equation. Let me compute both sides.

Left-hand side: \( f(x) + f(y) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}y - 1 \)

Simplify: \( \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}y - 2 \)

Right-hand side: \( f(x + y) - x y - 1 \)

Compute \( f(x + y) \):

\( \frac{1}{2}(x + y)^2 + \frac{3}{2}(x + y) - 1 \)

Expanding:

\( \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y - 1 \)

Simplify:

\( \frac{1}{2}x^2 + xy + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y - 1 \)

Subtract \( xy \) and 1:

Right-hand side becomes:

\( \frac{1}{2}x^2 + xy + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y - 1 - xy - 1 \)

Simplify:

\( \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y - 2 \)

Which is equal to the left-hand side. So, yes, the function satisfies the functional equation. Good.

Now, so \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 \). Let me write this as:

\( f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 3x - 2}{2} \)

Simplify numerator: \( x^2 + 3x - 2 \). So, \( f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 3x - 2}{2} \). Maybe we can write it as:

\( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 \). Either way is fine.

So, now, the problem asks for all integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \). So, we need to solve the equation:

\( \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{3}{2}n - 1 = n \)

Let me solve this equation for \( n \). First, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:

\( n^2 + 3n - 2 = 2n \)

Bring all terms to one side:

\( n^2 + 3n - 2 - 2n = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \)

So, the quadratic equation is \( n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \). Let's solve this.

Using the quadratic formula:

\( n = \frac{ -1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8} }{2} = \frac{ -1 \pm 3 }{2} \)

So, the solutions are:

\( n = \frac{ -1 + 3 }{2 } = 1 \)

and

\( n = \frac{ -1 - 3 }{2 } = -2 \)

So, \( n = 1 \) and \( n = -2 \).

But wait, the problem says "find all integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \)." So, both 1 and -2 are integers, so these are the solutions. Let me verify them.

First, \( n = 1 \). We know from the given information that \( f(1) = 1 \), so that's correct.

Next, \( n = -2 \). Let me compute \( f(-2) \) using the function we found.

\( f(-2) = \frac{1}{2}(-2)^2 + \frac{3}{2}(-2) - 1 \)

Compute step by step:

\( (-2)^2 = 4 \), so \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \)

\( \frac{3}{2} \times (-2) = -3 \)

Then, subtract 1: \( 2 - 3 - 1 = -2 \)

So, \( f(-2) = -2 \), which equals \( n = -2 \). Perfect, that works.

Therefore, the integers \( n \) satisfying \( f(n) = n \) are \( n = 1 \) and \( n = -2 \).

But wait, just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other integer solutions. Our quadratic equation only gave two solutions, so unless there's a mistake in my solving, these are the only solutions.

Wait, let me double-check my solving of the quadratic equation:

Starting from \( f(n) = n \):

\( \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{3}{2}n - 1 = n \)

Multiply both sides by 2: \( n^2 + 3n - 2 = 2n \)

Bring 2n to left: \( n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \)

Quadratic formula: \( n = \frac{ -1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8} }{2} = \frac{ -1 \pm 3 }{2} \)

So yes, only two solutions, 1 and -2. So, 1 and -2 are the integers where \( f(n) = n \).

Just to make sure, let me compute \( f(2) \) again, since I had a conflicting result earlier.

\( f(2) = \frac{1}{2}(4) + \frac{3}{2}(2) - 1 = 2 + 3 - 1 = 4 \). So, \( f(2) = 4 \). Which is different from 2, so 2 is not a solution. Similarly, \( f(0) = -1 \), which is different from 0. So, okay, seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( n = 1 \) and \( n = -2 \).

Given the functional equation \( f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 \) for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), and knowing that \( f(1) = 1 \), we need to find all integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \).

First, we determine \( f(0) \) by setting \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \):

\[
f(0) + f(0) = f(0) - 1 \implies 2f(0) = f(0) - 1 \implies f(0) = -1
\]

Next, we compute \( f(2) \) by setting \( x = y = 1 \):

\[
f(1) + f(1) = f(2) - 1 - 1 \implies 2 = f(2) - 2 \implies f(2) = 4
\]

We then compute \( f(3) \) by setting \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 1 \):

\[
f(2) + f(1) = f(3) - 2 - 1 \implies 4 + 1 = f(3) - 3 \implies f(3) = 8
\]

We notice a pattern and then assume \( f(x) \) is a quadratic function. We let \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) and substitute into the functional equation. After equating coefficients, we find:

\[
a = \frac{1}{2}, \quad c = -1
\]

Using \( f(1) = 1 \), we solve for \( b \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} + b - 1 = 1 \implies b = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Thus, the function is \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 \).

To find integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \), we solve:

\[
\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{3}{2}n - 1 = n \implies n^2 + n - 2 = 0
\]

Solving the quadratic equation:

\[
n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm 3}{2}
\]

This gives solutions \( n = 1 \) and \( n = -2 \).

Thus, the integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \) are \boxed{1} and \boxed{-2}.
