Question:
If $\frac{a}{b}$ is the probability that the reciprocal of a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010 gives a terminating decimal, with $a$ and $b$ being relatively prime positive integers, what is $a+b$?

Correct Answer:
There are 2009 positive integers less than 2010, of which 1005 are odd. If $\frac{1}{n}$ is equal to a terminating decimal, then $n$ can only be divisible by 2 and 5. However, since we have the added restriction that $n$ is odd, $n$ must be a power of 5. There are five powers of 5 less than 2010. \begin{align*}
5^0 &= 1 \\
5^1 &= 5 \\
5^2 &= 25 \\
5^3 &= 125 \\
5^4 &= 625
\end{align*} Note that $5^5 = 3125$. Since there are five odd integers that satisfy our desired condition, the desired probability is $\frac{5}{1005} = \frac{1}{201}$. This is in simplest terms, so our answer is $1+201 = \boxed{202}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here. It says: If a/b is the probability that the reciprocal of a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010 gives a terminating decimal, with a and b being relatively prime positive integers, what is a + b?

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what it means for a reciprocal to give a terminating decimal. Then, I have to figure out how many such integers there are among the positive odd integers less than 2010. Finally, I can compute the probability, reduce the fraction, and find a + b.

Starting with the first part: when does a reciprocal of an integer give a terminating decimal? I remember that a fraction 1/n will have a terminating decimal if and only if the prime factors of n are only 2 and/or 5. So, n must be of the form 2^k * 5^m where k and m are non-negative integers. This is because terminating decimals are fractions whose denominators have only prime factors 2 and 5.

So, applying this to our problem, we need to find the number of positive odd integers less than 2010 such that when you take their reciprocal, it's a terminating decimal. But wait, the integer is odd. Hmm, so if the integer is odd, it can't have 2 as a factor, right? So, if n is odd, then for 1/n to be a terminating decimal, n must be a power of 5 only, because 2 is not a factor.

Therefore, the positive odd integers less than 2010 whose reciprocals are terminating decimals are exactly the powers of 5 that are less than 2010.

Let me write that down:

Number of favorable outcomes = number of positive odd integers less than 2010 which are powers of 5.

So, I need to find all numbers of the form 5^k where 5^k is an odd integer less than 2010. Since 5 is odd, all its powers are odd, so I don't have to worry about that. So, I just have to find all k such that 5^k < 2010.

Let me compute these powers:

5^1 = 5

5^2 = 25

5^3 = 125

5^4 = 625

5^5 = 3125

Wait, 5^5 is 3125, which is more than 2010. So, the highest power of 5 less than 2010 is 5^4 = 625.

Therefore, the powers of 5 less than 2010 are 5, 25, 125, 625. So, that's 4 numbers.

Hence, the number of favorable outcomes is 4.

Now, moving on to the total number of possible outcomes. The problem says it's a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010. So, we need to count how many positive odd integers there are less than 2010.

Wait, 2010 is an even number, so positive odd integers less than 2010 would be from 1, 3, 5, ..., up to 2009.

So, how many terms are in this sequence? Since it's an arithmetic sequence starting at 1, ending at 2009, with a common difference of 2.

The formula for the number of terms is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1.

So, ((2009 - 1)/2) + 1 = (2008 / 2) + 1 = 1004 + 1 = 1005.

So, there are 1005 positive odd integers less than 2010.

Therefore, the probability is 4 / 1005.

But we need to make sure that 4 and 1005 are relatively prime. So, let's compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4 and 1005.

Factors of 4: 1, 2, 4.

Factors of 1005: Let's see, 1005 divided by 5 is 201. 201 divided by 3 is 67. 67 is a prime number. So, prime factors of 1005 are 3, 5, 67.

4's prime factors are 2, 2. So, they share no common factors except 1. Therefore, GCD(4, 1005) = 1. So, 4/1005 is already in its simplest form. So, a = 4 and b = 1005.

Therefore, a + b = 4 + 1005 = 1009.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my reasoning.

First, confirming that reciprocals of odd integers can only be terminating if the integer is a power of 5. Since the integer is odd, it can't have 2 as a prime factor, so only 5 is allowed.

We found that 5^1, 5^2, 5^3, 5^4 are all less than 2010, but 5^5 is 3125 which is too big. So, 4 numbers.

Total number of positive odd integers less than 2010: from 1 to 2009, stepping by 2. So, the count is (2009 - 1)/2 + 1 = 2008/2 +1 = 1004 + 1 = 1005. That seems correct.

So, 4 favorable over 1005 total. 4 and 1005 are co-prime because 1005 is 3*5*67, none of which are factors of 4. So, yes, the fraction is reduced completely.

Therefore, a + b is 4 + 1005 = 1009.

Wait, but let me make sure that 5^4 is indeed 625. 5^1=5, 5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125. Yep, 625 is less than 2010, so that's correct.

And 2009 is indeed the last odd integer before 2010, so that seems correct.

Hmm, I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 1009.

**Final Answer**
The value of \(a + b\) is \boxed{1009}.
</think>

To determine the probability that the reciprocal of a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010 gives a terminating decimal, we first need to understand when a reciprocal of an integer results in a terminating decimal. A fraction \( \frac{1}{n} \) will have a terminating decimal if and only if \( n \) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. Since we are dealing with positive odd integers, they cannot have 2 as a factor, so \( n \) must be a power of 5.

Next, we identify the powers of 5 that are less than 2010:
- \( 5^1 = 5 \)
- \( 5^2 = 25 \)
- \( 5^3 = 125 \)
- \( 5^4 = 625 \)
- \( 5^5 = 3125 \) (which is greater than 2010)

Thus, the powers of 5 less than 2010 are 5, 25, 125, and 625, giving us 4 favorable outcomes.

We then count the total number of positive odd integers less than 2010. These integers form an arithmetic sequence from 1 to 2009 with a common difference of 2. The number of terms in this sequence is calculated as:
\[
\left( \frac{2009 - 1}{2} \right) + 1 = \left( \frac{2008}{2} \right) + 1 = 1004 + 1 = 1005
\]

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{4}{1005} \). Since 4 and 1005 are relatively prime, the fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, \( a = 4 \) and \( b = 1005 \), giving us \( a + b = 4 + 1005 = 1009 \).

The value of \( a + b \) is \(\boxed{1009}\).
