Question:
Find the sum of all complex solutions of the equation
\[\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\]

Correct Answer:
We can add 4 to both sides to get
\[\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + 1 + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + 1 + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + 1 + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} + 1 = 2010x.\]This simplifies to
\[\frac{x^2}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x.\]We see that $x = 0$ is a solution (which does not affect our sum).  Otherwise, we can divide both sides by $x$:
\[\frac{x}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{x}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{x}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{x}{x^2 - 4} = 2010.\]Clearing the denominators, we get
\begin{align*}
&x(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + x(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + x(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + x(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) \\
&\quad = 2010(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4).
\end{align*}This expands to
\[4x^7 + \dotsb = 2010x^8 + \dotsb,\]where only terms that have degree 7 or greater are shown.  Then
\[2010x^8 - 4x^7 + \dotsb = 0,\]so by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $\frac{4}{2010} = \boxed{\frac{2}{1005}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I've got this equation to solve:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Hmm, okay. It says to find the sum of all complex solutions. Hmm, complex solutions, so that includes real ones too, right? Because real numbers are a subset of complex numbers.

First, let me understand what kind of equation this is. On the left side, there are four fractions, each with a denominator that's quadratic in x. On the right side, it's a linear term in x minus 4. That seems complicated because of the fractions. Maybe I can find a common denominator or something, but that might get really messy. There's four different denominators: (x² - 1), (x² - 2), (x² - 3), and (x² - 4). Each of these can be factored as (x - 1)(x + 1), (x - √2)(x + √2), and so on. 

Wait, maybe I can make a substitution to simplify things. Let's let y = x². Then each denominator becomes (y - a) where a is 1, 2, 3, 4. So the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{y - 1} + \frac{2}{y - 2} + \frac{3}{y - 3} + \frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

But now, y is x², so y is related to x², which complicates things because y is a function of x, but in the equation, it's still written as if y is a variable. Hmm, maybe this substitution isn't helpful because we still have x on the right side. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that each term on the left is a function of y, so perhaps we can write the left side as a function f(y), and the right side as another function g(x). But since y = x², it's a relation between y and x, so it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can combine all the fractions on the left side and set it equal to the right side, then get everything to one side and try to find roots. But that seems complicated because each denominator is quadratic, so the common denominator would be (x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4). That would be a degree 8 polynomial. Multiplying through by that would lead to an 8th-degree equation, which is difficult to solve directly.

But maybe instead of expanding everything, I can think about the sum of roots. The problem is asking for the sum of all complex solutions. So perhaps I can use Vieta's formula? Vieta's relates the sum of roots to the coefficients of the polynomial. But to use Vieta's, I need to have a polynomial equation. So perhaps I can manipulate the equation to form a polynomial.

Let me try that. Let's denote:

Left side: L = 1/(x² - 1) + 2/(x² - 2) + 3/(x² - 3) + 4/(x² - 4)

Right side: R = 2010x - 4

So the equation is L = R.

To combine L, let's find a common denominator, which is (x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4). So:

L = [1*(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4) + 2*(x² - 1)(x² - 3)(x² - 4) + 3*(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 4) + 4*(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)] / [(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4)]

Set this equal to R = 2010x - 4.

So, moving everything to one side:

[1*(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4) + 2*(x² - 1)(x² - 3)(x² - 4) + 3*(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 4) + 4*(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)] - (2010x - 4)*(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4) = 0

Wow, that's going to be a massive polynomial. Let's denote this entire expression as P(x) = 0, where P(x) is the numerator after bringing everything to one side.

But instead of expanding everything, maybe I can figure out the degree of P(x). The left side numerator is a polynomial of degree 6 because each term is (x² - a)(x² - b)(x² - c), which is x^6. So each term on the left numerator is degree 6, and there are four such terms, so adding them gives a degree 6 polynomial.

The right side is (2010x - 4)* (x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4). So that is (2010x - 4) multiplied by a degree 8 polynomial. So the right side is a degree 9 polynomial.

So when we bring everything to one side, P(x) is the left numerator minus the right side, which is a degree 9 polynomial minus a degree 6 polynomial. Hence, P(x) is a degree 9 polynomial.

But the problem is, we need to find the sum of all complex solutions. For a polynomial equation of degree n, the sum of all roots is equal to - (coefficient of x^{n-1}) / (coefficient of x^n). So if we can find the coefficients of x^9 and x^8 in P(x), we can find the sum of the roots.

Therefore, let's focus on finding the coefficients of x^9 and x^8 in P(x). Let's denote:

P(x) = Left numerator - Right side.

So, P(x) = [Left numerator] - [Right side]

First, find the degree 9 term in P(x). The right side is (2010x - 4)*(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4). Let's find the leading term of this product.

The leading term of (x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4) is x^8, since each x² term is multiplied together, so x² * x² * x² * x² = x^8. Then multiplying by (2010x - 4), the leading term is 2010x * x^8 = 2010x^9. So the right side has a leading term of 2010x^9.

The left numerator is a degree 6 polynomial, so when subtracted by the right side, the leading term of P(x) will be -2010x^9.

Therefore, the coefficient of x^9 in P(x) is -2010.

Now, the coefficient of x^8 in P(x). Let's compute that.

First, the coefficient of x^8 in the right side. The right side is 2010x*(x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4). So to find the coefficient of x^8, we need to consider the term when we multiply 2010x by the term with x^7 in the expansion of (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4). Hmm, so we need the coefficient of x^7 in (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4).

Wait, but (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4) is a polynomial where each term is x^8 plus lower degree terms. So the coefficient of x^7 is zero, because when multiplying these quadratics, the highest degree is x^8, and the coefficient of x^7 would come from terms where you pick x² from three factors and a constant from one. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply four quadratics, each term is formed by picking one term from each quadratic and multiplying them.

So to get x^7, we need the sum of exponents from each factor to add up to 7. Since each factor is x² - a, the exponents are either 2 or 0. So in order to get x^7, which is an odd exponent, we need to have one factor contributing x (which is actually not possible because each factor is either x² or a constant). Wait, actually, each factor is x² - a, so when expanding, each term is selected as either x² or -a from each factor.

So to get x^7, we would need to pick x² from three factors and -a from one factor. Because 2 + 2 + 2 + (-a) doesn't make sense, but wait, no, each factor is either x² or a constant. So each term is a product of either x² or constants. So each term in the expansion is x^{2k} * (product of constants). Therefore, the exponents are all even numbers. Thus, the coefficient of x^7 is zero because 7 is odd, and all exponents in the expansion are even.

Therefore, the coefficient of x^8 in the right side is zero because the coefficient of x^7 in (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4) is zero, so 2010 multiplied by zero is zero.

Now, the coefficient of x^8 in the left numerator. The left numerator is:

1*(x² - 2)(x² - 3)(x² - 4) + 2*(x² - 1)(x² - 3)(x² - 4) + 3*(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 4) + 4*(x² - 1)(x² - 2)(x² - 3)

Each of these terms is a cubic in x², so degree 6. So when we expand each term, they contribute up to x^6. Therefore, the coefficient of x^8 in the left numerator is zero.

Therefore, the coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is 0 (from left numerator) minus 0 (from right side), which is zero. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the left numerator is of degree 6, so when we subtract the right side, which has a degree 9 term, but the left numerator doesn't have an x^8 term, so the coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is just the negative of the coefficient of x^8 in the right side.

But in the right side, as we saw, the coefficient of x^8 is zero. So the coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is zero. So overall, the coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is zero.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

P(x) is Left numerator - Right side. The left numerator is degree 6, so when subtracting the right side (degree 9), the degrees will only go up to 9.

So the coefficient of x^9 in P(x) is -2010, as we saw.

The coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is the coefficient of x^8 in Left numerator minus the coefficient of x^8 in Right side.

But as we saw, the coefficient of x^8 in Left numerator is zero because Left numerator is degree 6. The coefficient of x^8 in Right side is zero because as we saw, the coefficient of x^7 in (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4) is zero, so when multiplied by 2010x, the coefficient of x^8 is zero.

Therefore, the coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is 0 - 0 = 0.

Thus, the coefficient of x^9 is -2010, and the coefficient of x^8 is 0. So the sum of the roots is - (coefficient of x^8) / (coefficient of x^9) = -0 / (-2010) = 0.

Wait, is that correct? So the sum of all complex solutions is zero? That seems surprising, but let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the coefficient of x^8 in P(x). Let me double-check.

Wait, the left numerator is a degree 6 polynomial, so when we subtract the right side (degree 9), the highest degree term in P(x) is 9, as I thought. The coefficient of x^9 is -2010, and the coefficient of x^8 is 0.

Therefore, by Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots is - (coefficient of x^8) / (coefficient of x^9) = -0 / (-2010) = 0.

So, that suggests the sum of all complex solutions is zero.

But let me think if that makes sense. The equation is:

1/(x² - 1) + ... + 4/(x² - 4) = 2010x - 4.

So it's a mix of rational functions on the left and a linear function on the right. The left side is even in x, because each term is 1/(x² - a), which is even. So the left side is even, meaning that if x is a solution, then -x is also a solution. Therefore, the solutions come in pairs of x and -x. So when we sum all solutions, each pair would sum to zero, and any other solutions would have to be zero themselves. But is x=0 a solution?

Let me test x=0. Plugging in, left side becomes 1/(-1) + 2/(-2) + 3/(-3) + 4/(-4) = (-1) + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -4. The right side is 2010*0 -4 = -4. So x=0 is indeed a solution.

Therefore, x=0 is a solution, and it's the only solution that is its own negative. So that's one solution, and the rest come in pairs of x and -x. So if we have solutions x1, -x1, x2, -x2, ..., then the sum would be 0 + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. Therefore, the sum is zero, which aligns with our earlier conclusion.

Therefore, I think the sum is indeed zero.

Wait, but hold on. Let me check if P(x) is an odd function or not. If P(x) is an odd function, then all roots would come in pairs x and -x, so the sum would be zero. But earlier, we saw that the coefficient of x^8 is zero, but the coefficient of x^9 is -2010, which is not zero. So P(x) is not an odd function. So, is the sum still zero?

Wait, but in reality, the function is even on the left and linear on the right, so the equation isn't necessarily symmetric. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the left side is even in x, as we saw, because replacing x with -x doesn't change it. The right side is 2010x - 4, which is an odd function shifted down by 4. So the equation is even on the left, and an odd function minus 4 on the right. So if x is a solution, then -x would satisfy:

Left side remains the same, right side becomes -2010x - 4. So unless -2010x -4 = 2010x -4, which would imply 2010x = 0, so x=0. So only x=0 is a solution that is symmetric with itself. All other solutions would have to come in pairs where x and -x are solutions only if 2010x -4 equals 2010(-x) -4, which would require 2010x -4 = -2010x -4, meaning 4020x = 0, so x=0. So indeed, only x=0 is a solution that is symmetric, and all other solutions are asymmetric, but they come in pairs x and -x, but not necessarily both solutions.

Wait, but that complicates things because if some solutions are not symmetric, then they come in complex conjugate pairs? Hmm, maybe not necessarily.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the function f(x) = Left side - Right side.

Since Left side is even, f(-x) = Left side - Right(-x) = Left side - (-2010x -4) = f(x) + 4020x.

So f(-x) = f(x) + 4020x.

So unless x=0, f(-x) ≠ f(x). So the function is not symmetric, so the solutions don't necessarily come in pairs. Therefore, maybe some solutions are not paired with their negatives, hence the sum isn't necessarily zero. However, earlier, by Vieta's formula, we found that the sum is zero because the coefficient of x^8 is zero. So that suggests that regardless of the symmetry, the sum is zero.

But how is that possible, if the equation isn't symmetric?

Wait, perhaps because the coefficients of the polynomial are real. Therefore, complex roots come in conjugate pairs, and their sum is twice the real part. But in our case, the polynomial is of degree 9, which is odd, so there must be at least one real root, which is x=0 as we saw. The rest of the roots would come in complex conjugate pairs.

But if it's a degree 9 polynomial with real coefficients, the non-real roots come in pairs. So the sum of all roots is the sum of x=0 plus the sum of all other roots, which are in complex conjugate pairs. Each pair sums to twice the real part, but unless they are purely imaginary, their sum is real. Wait, but in general, for a polynomial with real coefficients, the sum of roots is given by Vieta, regardless of being real or complex. So if the polynomial is degree 9, with real coefficients, and the coefficient of x^9 is non-zero, the sum is - (coefficient of x^8)/ (coefficient of x^9). Since we have coefficient of x^8 as zero, the sum is zero.

So regardless of the symmetry, the sum is zero. So even if the equation isn't symmetric, the sum is still zero because the polynomial has real coefficients and the coefficient of x^8 is zero.

Therefore, the sum of all complex solutions is zero.

Wait, but x=0 is a real solution, and the rest are complex? If the polynomial is degree 9, it must have 9 roots, at least one of which is real (x=0), and the rest are complex. But complex roots come in pairs, so 8 complex roots, which can form 4 pairs. So the sum of all roots is zero. So, in this case, the sum is zero.

So, to recap, we transformed the original equation into a polynomial of degree 9, found that the coefficient of x^8 is zero, and the coefficient of x^9 is -2010, so the sum of all roots is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.

But just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Suppose I let y = x, then perhaps consider the equation in terms of y, but I don't think that's helpful. Alternatively, maybe using partial fractions or something else, but I don't think that would help either. So, sticking with the polynomial approach seems the way to go.

Therefore, I think the sum of all complex solutions is zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
</think>

To find the sum of all complex solutions of the equation

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4,
\]

we start by noting that each term on the left side is a rational function. We denote \( y = x^2 \), but this substitution complicates the equation because of the \( x \) term on the right side. Instead, we consider the equation as a rational function and clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by the common denominator \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\).

This results in a polynomial equation. The left side, after combining the fractions, is a degree 6 polynomial. The right side is a degree 9 polynomial after expanding and multiplying by the common denominator. Thus, the resulting polynomial \( P(x) \) is of degree 9.

Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of a polynomial is given by the negative coefficient of \( x^{n-1} \) divided by the coefficient of \( x^n \). For \( P(x) \), the coefficient of \( x^9 \) is \(-2010\) and the coefficient of \( x^8 \) is \(0\). Therefore, the sum of the roots is:

\[
-\frac{\text{coefficient of } x^8}{\text{coefficient of } x^9} = -\frac{0}{-2010} = 0.
\]

Thus, the sum of all complex solutions is

\[
\boxed{0}.
\]
