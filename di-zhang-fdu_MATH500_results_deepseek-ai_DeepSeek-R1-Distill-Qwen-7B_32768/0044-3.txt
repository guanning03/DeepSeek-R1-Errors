Question:
Let $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ be vectors such that the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is $29^\circ,$ and the angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $84^\circ.$  Find the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}.$

Correct Answer:
Since $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b},$ and $\mathbf{a-b}$ all lie in the same plane, from the diagram below, we see that the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $84^\circ - 29^\circ = \boxed{55^\circ}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this vector problem here. Let me read it again: We have vectors **a** and **b**. The angle between **a** and **b** is 29 degrees. Then, the angle between **b** and **a** minus **b** (so that's **a** - **b**) is 84 degrees. We need to find the angle between **a** and **a** - **b**. Hmm, alright.

Let me try to visualize this. I know that vectors can be represented as arrows in space, and the angle between them is determined by the dot product formula. The formula for the angle θ between two vectors **u** and **v** is cosθ = (**u** · **v**) / (||**u**|| ||**v**||). Maybe I can use this somewhere.

First, let me note down what's given:

1. The angle between **a** and **b** is 29°, so let's denote that as θ_ab = 29°.
2. The angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**) is 84°, so θ_b(a - b) = 84°.

We need to find the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**), which we can denote as θ_a(a - b).

Alright, so maybe I can set up some equations using the dot product formula. Let me denote vectors **a** and **b** with magnitudes |**a**| and |**b**|, respectively.

First, the angle between **a** and **b** is 29°, so their dot product is:

**a** · **b** = |**a**| |**b**| cos(29°).

Similarly, the angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**) is 84°, so their dot product is:

**b** · (**a** - **b**) = |**b**| |**a** - **b**| cos(84°).

Let me compute that dot product:

**b** · (**a** - **b**) = **b** · **a** - **b** · **b**.

Which simplifies to:

**a** · **b** - |**b**|².

So we have:

**a** · **b** - |**b**|² = |**b**| |**a** - **b**| cos(84°).

But we already have an expression for **a** · **b** from the first equation. Let me plug that in:

|**a**| |**b**| cos(29°) - |**b**|² = |**b**| |**a** - **b**| cos(84°).

Hmm, okay. Let me see if I can rearrange this equation to find something useful. Let's factor out |**b**| on the left-hand side:

|**b**| [ |**a**| cos(29°) - |**b**| ] = |**b**| |**a** - **b**| cos(84°).

Since |**b**| is a magnitude, it can't be zero (otherwise, the angle between **a** and **b** wouldn't be defined). So I can divide both sides by |**b**|:

|**a**| cos(29°) - |**b**| = |**a** - **b**| cos(84°).

Alright, now we have an equation involving |**a**|, |**b**|, and |**a** - **b**|.

But we need to find the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**). Let's denote this angle as φ. Then, by the dot product formula:

**a** · (**a** - **b**) = |**a**| |**a** - **b**| cosφ.

Let me compute the left-hand side:

**a** · (**a** - **b**) = **a** · **a** - **a** · **b**.

Which simplifies to:

|**a**|² - **a** · **b**.

So, we have:

|**a**|² - **a** · **b** = |**a**| |**a** - **b**| cosφ.

We can express this as:

cosφ = (|**a**|² - **a** · **b**) / (|**a**| |**a** - **b**|).

We already have an expression for **a** · **b** from the first part: |**a**| |**b**| cos(29°). So substituting that in:

cosφ = (|**a**|² - |**a**| |**b**| cos(29°)) / (|**a**| |**a** - **b**|).

Simplify numerator:

= (|**a**|² - |**a**| |**b**| cos29°) / (|**a**| |**a** - **b**|)

= (|**a**| (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29°)) / (|**a**| |**a** - **b**|)

The |**a**| cancels out:

= (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29°) / |**a** - **b**|.

Hmm, so cosφ is equal to (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29°) divided by |**a** - **b**|.

Now, looking back at the previous equation we had:

|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| = |**a** - **b**| cos84°.

Let me rearrange that equation to express |**a** - **b**| in terms of |**a**| and |**b**|.

So,

|**a** - **b**| = (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**|) / cos84°.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

From:

|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| = |**a** - **b**| cos84°.

So, solving for |**a** - **b**|:

|**a** - **b**| = (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**|) / cos84°.

Yes, that seems right.

Therefore, |**a** - **b**| is equal to (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**|) / cos84°.

So, now going back to our expression for cosφ:

cosφ = (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29°) / |**a** - **b**|.

But |**a** - **b**| is equal to (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**|) / cos84°.

So, substituting that:

cosφ = (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29°) / [ (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**|) / cos84° ].

Which is the same as:

cosφ = [ (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29°) * cos84° ] / (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| ).

Wait, that looks a bit complex, but let me see if I can factor terms or perhaps express it in terms of a ratio.

Let me denote |**a**| as 'a' and |**b**| as 'b' for simplicity.

So, let a = |**a**|, b = |**b**|. Then:

cosφ = (a - b cos29°) * cos84° / (a cos29° - b).

So, cosφ is equal to [ (a - b cos29°) cos84° ] / (a cos29° - b ).

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

cosφ = [ (a - b cos29°) / (a cos29° - b) ] * cos84°.

Is there a way to simplify (a - b cos29°) / (a cos29° - b)?

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Let me write:

Numerator: a - b cos29° = a - b cos29°

Denominator: a cos29° - b = a cos29° - b

Hmm, perhaps factor out a negative sign in the denominator:

Denominator: a cos29° - b = -(b - a cos29°)

Similarly, numerator: a - b cos29° = -(b cos29° - a)

So, [ - (b cos29° - a) ] / [ - (b - a cos29°) ] = (b cos29° - a) / (b - a cos29°)

Wait, so the negatives cancel:

= (b cos29° - a) / (b - a cos29° )

Hmm, that's interesting.

So, (a - b cos29°) / (a cos29° - b ) becomes (b cos29° - a)/(b - a cos29° )

Which is equal to [ -(a - b cos29°) ] / [ -(a cos29° - b) ] = same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor a and b terms.

Wait, maybe it's better to factor numerator and denominator differently.

Wait, let me write numerator as:

a - b cos29° = a - b cos29°

Denominator: a cos29° - b = a cos29° - b

So, if I factor out 'a' from numerator and denominator:

Numerator: a(1 - (b/a) cos29° )

Denominator: a(cos29° - (b/a) )

So, that would give:

[ a(1 - (b/a) cos29° ) ] / [ a( cos29° - (b/a) ) ] = [1 - (b/a) cos29° ] / [ cos29° - (b/a) ]

So, the 'a's cancel.

Let me denote k = b/a, so k is the ratio of |**b**| to |**a**|.

Then, expression becomes:

[1 - k cos29° ] / [ cos29° - k ]

So, going back:

cosφ = [ (a - b cos29° ) / (a cos29° - b ) ] * cos84° = [ (1 - k cos29° ) / ( cos29° - k ) ] * cos84°.

So, cosφ = [ (1 - k cos29° ) / ( cos29° - k ) ] * cos84°.

Hmm, so this seems a bit involved, but perhaps we can find a relationship for k.

Wait, is there another equation involving k that we can use?

Earlier, we had:

From |**a**| cos29° - |**b**| = |**a** - **b**| cos84°.

Which in terms of k is:

a cos29° - b = |**a** - **b**| cos84°.

Divide both sides by a:

cos29° - (b/a) = (|**a** - **b**| / a ) cos84°.

So,

cos29° - k = (|**a** - **b**| / a ) cos84°.

But |**a** - **b**| can be expressed in terms of a and b as well. From the law of cosines, the magnitude of (**a** - **b**) is:

|**a** - **b**| = sqrt( a² + b² - 2ab cos(theta_ab) ) = sqrt( a² + b² - 2ab cos29° ).

So, |**a** - **b**| = sqrt(a² + b² - 2ab cos29° ).

Therefore,

cos29° - k = [ sqrt(a² + b² - 2ab cos29° ) / a ] cos84°.

Let me simplify the right side:

sqrt(a² + b² - 2ab cos29° ) / a = sqrt(1 + (b/a)² - 2 (b/a) cos29° ) = sqrt(1 + k² - 2k cos29° ).

Therefore,

cos29° - k = sqrt(1 + k² - 2k cos29° ) cos84°.

Hmm, so we have an equation in terms of k:

cos29° - k = sqrt(1 + k² - 2k cos29° ) cos84°.

This seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can square both sides to eliminate the square root.

Let me denote the left side as L = cos29° - k, and the right side as R = sqrt(1 + k² - 2k cos29° ) cos84°.

So, L = R.

Square both sides:

L² = R².

So,

(cos29° - k)² = (1 + k² - 2k cos29° ) cos²84°.

Expanding left side:

cos²29° - 2k cos29° + k² = (1 + k² - 2k cos29° ) cos²84°.

Now, let's bring all terms to one side:

cos²29° - 2k cos29° + k² - (1 + k² - 2k cos29° ) cos²84° = 0.

Let me distribute the cos²84° term:

= cos²29° - 2k cos29° + k² - cos²84° - k² cos²84° + 2k cos29° cos²84° = 0.

Now, let's collect like terms:

1. Constants: cos²29° - cos²84°
2. Terms with k: -2k cos29° + 2k cos29° cos²84°
3. Terms with k²: k² - k² cos²84°.

So,

[cos²29° - cos²84°] + k [ -2 cos29° + 2 cos29° cos²84° ] + k² [1 - cos²84° ] = 0.

Factor where possible:

First, note that 1 - cos²84° = sin²84°, so that term can be written as k² sin²84°.

Similarly, in the linear term, factor out -2 cos29°:

= -2 cos29° (1 - cos²84° ) + 2k cos29° cos²84°.

Wait, perhaps let me try to factor further:

Let me write down:

= (cos²29° - cos²84°) + k [ -2 cos29° (1 - cos²84° ) + 2 cos29° cos²84° ] + k² sin²84° = 0.

Wait, perhaps that's getting messy. Maybe it's better to compute each term numerically.

Let me compute the numerical values step by step.

First, compute cos29°, cos84°, etc.

Compute cos29°: cos(29°) ≈ 0.8746

Compute cos84°: cos(84°) ≈ 0.1045

Compute sin84°: sin(84°) ≈ 0.9945

Compute sin²84°: (0.9945)^2 ≈ 0.9890

Compute cos²29°: (0.8746)^2 ≈ 0.7648

Compute cos²84°: (0.1045)^2 ≈ 0.0109

Now, let's compute each bracket:

1. Constants: cos²29° - cos²84° ≈ 0.7648 - 0.0109 ≈ 0.7539

2. Linear term coefficient: -2 cos29° + 2 cos29° cos²84°
= -2 * 0.8746 + 2 * 0.8746 * 0.0109
≈ -1.7492 + 2 * 0.8746 * 0.0109
≈ -1.7492 + 0.0190
≈ -1.7302

3. Quadratic term coefficient: 1 - cos²84° ≈ 1 - 0.0109 ≈ 0.9891

So, plugging these into the equation:

0.7539 + (-1.7302)k + 0.9891k² = 0.

So, we have a quadratic equation in terms of k:

0.9891k² -1.7302k + 0.7539 = 0.

Let me write it as:

0.9891k² -1.7302k + 0.7539 = 0.

To solve for k, use quadratic formula:

k = [1.7302 ± sqrt( (1.7302)^2 - 4 * 0.9891 * 0.7539 ) ] / (2 * 0.9891)

Compute discriminant D:

D = (1.7302)^2 - 4 * 0.9891 * 0.7539

Compute (1.7302)^2 ≈ 2.9934

Compute 4 * 0.9891 * 0.7539 ≈ 4 * 0.7455 ≈ 2.9820

So, D ≈ 2.9934 - 2.9820 ≈ 0.0114

Square root of D: sqrt(0.0114) ≈ 0.1068

So, k = [1.7302 ± 0.1068] / (2 * 0.9891) ≈ [1.7302 ± 0.1068] / 1.9782

Compute both possibilities:

First, with the plus sign:

k1 = (1.7302 + 0.1068)/1.9782 ≈ 1.8370 / 1.9782 ≈ 0.9285

Second, with the minus sign:

k2 = (1.7302 - 0.1068)/1.9782 ≈ 1.6234 / 1.9782 ≈ 0.8206

So, two possible solutions: k ≈ 0.9285 or k ≈ 0.8206.

Wait, but let's see which one makes sense. Remember, k = |**b**| / |**a**|, which is a positive ratio.

But we need to check which value of k satisfies the original equation before squaring, because squaring can introduce extraneous solutions.

Let me test k ≈ 0.9285:

From the earlier equation:

cos29° - k = sqrt(1 + k² - 2k cos29° ) cos84°

Compute left side: cos29° - 0.9285 ≈ 0.8746 - 0.9285 ≈ -0.0539

Compute right side:

sqrt(1 + (0.9285)^2 - 2 * 0.9285 * 0.8746 ) * cos84°

Compute inside sqrt:

1 + 0.8623 - 2 * 0.9285 * 0.8746 ≈ 1 + 0.8623 - 1.6309 ≈ 0.2314

sqrt(0.2314) ≈ 0.4810

Multiply by cos84° ≈ 0.1045:

≈ 0.4810 * 0.1045 ≈ 0.0503

So, left side ≈ -0.0539, right side ≈ 0.0503. Not equal, but close. Hmm, considering rounding errors, maybe acceptable, but let's check the other solution.

Test k ≈ 0.8206:

Left side: cos29° - 0.8206 ≈ 0.8746 - 0.8206 ≈ 0.0540

Right side:

sqrt(1 + (0.8206)^2 - 2 * 0.8206 * 0.8746 ) * cos84°

Compute inside sqrt:

1 + 0.6733 - 2 * 0.8206 * 0.8746 ≈ 1 + 0.6733 - 1.446 ≈ 0.2273

sqrt(0.2273) ≈ 0.4767

Multiply by cos84° ≈ 0.1045:

≈ 0.4767 * 0.1045 ≈ 0.0500

Left side ≈ 0.0540, right side ≈ 0.0500. Again, close but not exact. Hmm, seems both solutions are approximate. Maybe due to the approximated cosine values.

Alternatively, perhaps one of them is correct and the other is extraneous. Let's think about the physical meaning.

Since angle between **a** and **b** is 29°, which is acute. If k = |**b**| / |**a**| is approximately 0.8206, meaning |**b**| is about 82% of |**a**|. Alternatively, k ≈ 0.9285, meaning |**b**| is about 93% of |**a**|.

But let's see, the angle between **a** - **b** and **b** is 84°, which is also acute, but close to 90°. So, maybe if |**b**| is slightly smaller than |**a**|, the angle could be 84°. Alternatively, perhaps the other way.

Wait, perhaps the correct k is the one where cos29° - k is negative, as in the first case, which would make the right side also negative because sqrt is positive, but we had cos84° positive. Wait, but in the first case, the left side was negative, the right side was positive. That doesn't match. So that suggests that k ≈ 0.9285 is extraneous because it leads to a negative left and positive right, which can't be.

On the other hand, for k ≈ 0.8206, left side is positive (0.0540) and right side is positive (0.0500), which makes sense. So, k ≈ 0.8206 is the valid solution.

Therefore, |**b**| ≈ 0.8206 |**a**|.

So, k ≈ 0.8206.

Now, going back to our expression for cosφ:

cosφ = (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° / (|**a** - **b**| )

But we have |**a** - **b**| = (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| ) / cos84°.

So, substituting into cosφ:

cosφ = (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° / [ (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| ) / cos84° ]

= [ (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° * cos84° ] / (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| )

= [ (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos²84° ] / (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| )

Let me factor out a negative sign from the denominator:

|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| = - (|**b**| - |**a**| cos29° )

Similarly, the numerator is |**a**| - |**b**| cos29° = |**a**| - |**b**| cos29°.

So,

cosφ = [ (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos²84° ] / [ - (|**b**| - |**a**| cos29° ) ]

= - [ (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) / (|**b**| - |**a**| cos29° ) ] * cos²84°

But note that (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) / (|**b**| - |**a**| cos29° ) = (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) / ( - (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| ) )

So, it's equal to - (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) / (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| )

Therefore,

cosφ = - [ - (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) / (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| ) ] * cos²84°

Wait, perhaps my previous step is getting too convoluted. Let me try a different approach.

Given that |**b**| ≈ 0.8206 |**a**|, so let's denote |**b**| = k |**a**|, where k ≈ 0.8206.

So, let me substitute k into the expression for cosφ:

cosφ = (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° / (|**a** - **b**| )

But |**a** - **b**| = (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| ) / cos84°.

Therefore,

cosφ = (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° / [ (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| ) / cos84° ]

= [ (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° * cos84° ] / (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| )

= [ (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos²84° ] / (|**a**| cos29° - |**b**| )

Substitute |**b**| = k |**a**|:

= [ (1 - k cos29° ) * cos²84° ] / (cos29° - k )

So, plug in k ≈ 0.8206:

First, compute 1 - k cos29° ≈ 1 - 0.8206 * 0.8746 ≈ 1 - 0.719 ≈ 0.281

Compute cos²84° ≈ (0.1045)^2 ≈ 0.0109

Compute denominator: cos29° - k ≈ 0.8746 - 0.8206 ≈ 0.0540

So,

cosφ ≈ (0.281 * 0.0109) / 0.0540 ≈ (0.00306) / 0.0540 ≈ 0.0567

So, cosφ ≈ 0.0567

Therefore, φ ≈ arccos(0.0567) ≈ 86.7°, approximately 87°.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is approximately 87°, which is close to 84°, but a bit larger. Hmm.

But let me check if this makes sense. Since (**a** - **b**) is a vector that's kind of subtracting **b** from **a**, so if **b** is somewhat in the direction of **a**, then (**a** - **b**) would be slightly smaller in magnitude but pointing in a slightly different direction.

Given that the angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**) is 84°, which is close to 90°, so (**a** - **b**) is almost perpendicular to **b**, but slightly not. So, if (**a** - **b**) is almost perpendicular to **b**, then **a** must be mostly in the direction of **b**, but slightly adjusted.

Wait, but if (**a** - **b**) is almost perpendicular to **b**, then the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is going to be close to 90° as well, but perhaps a bit more or less.

But our calculation shows approximately 87°, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately without approximating.

Wait, let me go back to the quadratic equation:

0.9891k² -1.7302k + 0.7539 = 0.

We had k ≈ 0.8206, but let's use more precise values.

First, let's compute cos29°, cos84°, etc., with more precision.

Compute cos29°:

cos(29°) = cos(29 * π / 180 ) ≈ cos(0.5061 radians ) ≈ 0.8746197071

cos84° = cos(84 * π / 180 ) ≈ cos(1.466076633 radians ) ≈ 0.1045284633

Compute sin84° ≈ sqrt(1 - cos²84° ) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.010927008) ≈ sqrt(0.989072992) ≈ 0.994510268

Compute sin²84° ≈ 0.989072992

Compute cos²29° ≈ (0.8746197071)^2 ≈ 0.764814837

Compute cos²84° ≈ (0.1045284633)^2 ≈ 0.010927008

So, substituting back into the quadratic equation:

0.9891k² -1.7302k + 0.7539 = 0

Compute the coefficients:

a = 0.9891

b = -1.7302

c = 0.7539

Compute discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (1.7302)^2 - 4 * 0.9891 * 0.7539

Compute (1.7302)^2 = 2.99345204

Compute 4 * 0.9891 * 0.7539 ≈ 4 * 0.7455 ≈ 2.9820

Thus, D ≈ 2.99345204 - 2.9820 ≈ 0.01145204

sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(0.01145204) ≈ 0.10706

Therefore, k = [1.7302 ± 0.10706 ] / (2 * 0.9891) ≈ [1.7302 ± 0.10706 ] / 1.9782

Compute both roots:

k1 = (1.7302 + 0.10706)/1.9782 ≈ 1.83726 / 1.9782 ≈ 0.9285

k2 = (1.7302 - 0.10706)/1.9782 ≈ 1.62314 / 1.9782 ≈ 0.8206

So, as before, k ≈ 0.9285 and k ≈ 0.8206.

Now, as before, testing k ≈ 0.9285:

Left side: cos29° - k ≈ 0.8746197071 - 0.9285 ≈ -0.05388

Right side: sqrt(1 + k² - 2k cos29° ) * cos84° ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.8623 - 2 * 0.9285 * 0.8746197071 ) * 0.1045284633

Compute inside sqrt:

1 + 0.8623 - 2 * 0.9285 * 0.8746197071 ≈ 1 + 0.8623 - 1.6309 ≈ 0.2314

sqrt(0.2314) ≈ 0.4810

Multiply by cos84°: ≈ 0.4810 * 0.1045284633 ≈ 0.0503

So, left ≈ -0.05388, right ≈ 0.0503: not equal. So, invalid.

Testing k ≈ 0.8206:

Left side: cos29° - k ≈ 0.8746197071 - 0.8206 ≈ 0.0540

Right side: sqrt(1 + k² - 2k cos29° ) * cos84° ≈ sqrt(1 + 0.6733 - 2 * 0.8206 * 0.8746197071 ) * 0.1045284633

Compute inside sqrt:

1 + 0.6733 - 2 * 0.8206 * 0.8746197071 ≈ 1 + 0.6733 - 1.446 ≈ 0.2273

sqrt(0.2273) ≈ 0.4767

Multiply by cos84°: ≈ 0.4767 * 0.1045284633 ≈ 0.0500

So, left ≈ 0.0540, right ≈ 0.0500: close but not exact. Due to rounding, perhaps.

So, k ≈ 0.8206 is the valid solution.

So, now, with k = |**b**| / |**a**| ≈ 0.8206, we can compute cosφ:

cosφ = [ (1 - k cos29° ) / (cos29° - k ) ] * cos²84°

Compute numerator: 1 - k cos29° ≈ 1 - 0.8206 * 0.8746197071 ≈ 1 - 0.719 ≈ 0.281

Denominator: cos29° - k ≈ 0.8746197071 - 0.8206 ≈ 0.0540

So,

[ (0.281 ) / (0.0540 ) ] ≈ 5.2037

Multiply by cos²84° ≈ (0.1045284633)^2 ≈ 0.010927008

Thus,

cosφ ≈ 5.2037 * 0.010927008 ≈ 0.0570

So, cosφ ≈ 0.0570

Therefore, φ ≈ arccos(0.0570 ) ≈ 86.7°, which is approximately 87°.

But let me compute it more precisely.

Compute arccos(0.0570):

Using calculator, arccos(0.0570 ) ≈ 86.7°, which is approximately 87°, as before.

But let's see if we can get a more precise value.

Compute cos(86° ) ≈ 0.0697564737

cos(87° ) ≈ 0.0523359562

cos(86.7° ) ≈ ?

Compute 86.7°:

Compute 86.7° in radians: 86.7 * π / 180 ≈ 1.513 radians.

Compute cos(1.513 ) ≈ 0.0570.

Therefore, arccos(0.0570 ) ≈ 86.7°. So, yes, approximately 86.7°, which is roughly 87°.

But let's see if we can get an exact value.

Wait, 86.7° is approximately 86°42', which is close to 87°, but perhaps the exact value is 86.7°, which is 86.7°, so maybe we can write it as approximately 87°, but perhaps the exact value is 86.7°, which is 86 and 0.7 degrees, which is 86°42'.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 86.7°, but in the problem, it's likely expecting an exact value, perhaps 86°, 87°, or something else.

But let me think, perhaps through exact trigonometric identities, can we get an exact angle?

Wait, but given the information, maybe it's 86.7°, but perhaps 86.7° is approximately 86.7°, which is roughly 87°, but maybe the exact value is 86.7°, so we can write it as 86.7°, but in the problem, the angles are given as 29°, 84°, so maybe the answer is 86.7°, but we can write it as 86.7°, but perhaps it's 86.8°, let me check.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute cos(86.7° ):

Compute 86.7°, let's compute cos(86.7):

Using calculator: 86.7°, cos ≈ 0.0570.

Yes, so 86.7° is accurate.

Alternatively, 86.7° is 86°42', which is roughly 86.7°.

But perhaps the exact value is 86.7°, so we can write it as 86.7°, but the problem might require an exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 86.8°, depending on the precision.

But since the given angles are 29°, 84°, which are exact, perhaps the angle we are looking for is 86.7°, which is 86.7°, so 86.7° is approximately 86.7°, so maybe the answer is 86.7°, but given that 86.7 is 86.7, perhaps write it as 86.7°, but perhaps the exact value is 86.7°, but let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps 86.7° is equal to 86.7°, but let me see, is there a way to express it as an exact angle?

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is 86.7°, but it's more likely that the answer is 86.7°, which is approximately 87°, but let me think.

Wait, perhaps we can compute it more accurately.

Wait, cosφ ≈ 0.0570, so φ ≈ arccos(0.0570 ). Let me compute this more precisely.

Compute using Taylor series or look up the value.

Alternatively, use a calculator for better precision.

But since I don't have a calculator here, but perhaps I can use linear approximation.

We know that cos(86° ) ≈ 0.0697564737

cos(87° ) ≈ 0.0523359562

So, 0.0570 is between cos86° and cos87°. Let me find how much between.

Difference between 0.069756 and 0.052336 is 0.01742.

Our value is 0.0570, which is 0.0570 - 0.052336 ≈ 0.00466 above cos87°.

So, the fraction is 0.00466 / 0.01742 ≈ 0.267.

So, the angle is 87° - 0.267*(1° ) ≈ 86.733°, which is ≈86.73°, so 86.7°.

Thus, the angle is approximately 86.7°, which is approximately 86.7°, so we can box it as 86.7°, but maybe the problem expects an exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 86.7°, but perhaps it's 86.7°, which is approximately 86.7°, so 86.7°, so we can write it as 86.7°, but in the box, we can write \boxed{86.7^\circ}.

But wait, maybe it's better to check if 86.7° is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the exact value.

Wait, from the calculation, cosφ ≈ 0.0570, so φ ≈ 86.7°, so that's the answer.

Alternatively, let me check if 86.7° is 86.7°, which is 86.7°, so 86.7°, so we can write it as 86.7°, but in the problem, the given angles are 29°, 84°, so maybe 86.7° is the exact answer.

Alternatively, perhaps 86.7° is 86.7°, so we can write it as 86.7°, so in the box, we can write it as \boxed{86.7^\circ}.

But wait, let me check.

Wait, in the initial steps, we approximated cos29°, cos84°, etc., but if I use more precise values, perhaps the angle is more accurate.

But for the purposes of this problem, 86.7° is a good approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact answer is 87°, but let me think.

Wait, 86.7° is 86°42', which is 86.7°, so 86.7° is more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as 86.7°, so the answer is 86.7°, so I can box it as 86.7°.

But let me think if there is another way to get the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is 86.7°, which is 86.7°, so I can write it as 86.7°, so \boxed{86.7^\circ}.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an exact value, but given the approximate nature, 86.7° is acceptable.

Wait, but let me check with more accurate calculations.

Compute cosφ ≈ 0.0570, so φ ≈ arccos(0.0570 ).

Using a calculator, arccos(0.0570 ) ≈ 86.7°, so that's the value.

So, the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is approximately 86.7°, which we can write as 86.7°, so the answer is 86.7°.

But wait, let me think again. The original problem gives angles in whole degrees, except 84°, so perhaps the answer is 86.7°, which is 86.7°, but in the box, it's better to write it as 86.7°, so \boxed{86.7^\circ}.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 86.7°, so I can write it as \boxed{86.7^\circ}.

But let me check if the problem expects an exact value, but given the approximated nature, maybe 86.7° is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 86.7°, so that's the answer.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can use vectors to compute it. Let's assume **a** is a unit vector along the x-axis, so **a** = (1, 0).

Then, **b** makes an angle of 29° with **a**, so **b** can be written as (cos29°, sin29° ).

Now, compute **b** - **a** = (cos29° - 1, sin29° )

We need to find the angle between **a** = (1, 0) and **b** - **a** = (cos29° - 1, sin29° )

The angle φ between **a** and (**b** - **a**) can be found via:

cosφ = (**a** • (**b** - **a**)) / (|**a**| |**b** - **a**| )

Compute the dot product:

**a** • (**b** - **a**) = (1, 0) • (cos29° - 1, sin29° ) = 1*(cos29° - 1) + 0*sin29° = cos29° - 1

|**a**| = 1

|**b** - **a**| = sqrt( (cos29° - 1)^2 + (sin29°)^2 ) = sqrt( cos²29° - 2cos29° + 1 + sin²29° ) = sqrt( (cos²29° + sin²29° ) - 2cos29° + 1 ) = sqrt(1 - 2cos29° + 1 ) = sqrt(2 - 2cos29° ) = sqrt(2(1 - cos29° )) = 2 sin(29°/2 ) [using the identity 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2 ) ]

So,

cosφ = (cos29° - 1 ) / (2 sin(29°/2 ) )

Compute cos29° - 1 ≈ 0.8746 - 1 ≈ -0.1254

Compute 2 sin(14.5° ) ≈ 2 * 0.2505 ≈ 0.5010

So,

cosφ ≈ (-0.1254 ) / 0.5010 ≈ -0.2504

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, so cosφ ≈ -0.2504, which would imply φ ≈ arccos(-0.2504 ) ≈ 104.4°, which contradicts our earlier result of 86.7°. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, but in this approach, I assumed **a** is a unit vector, but perhaps I need to consider the magnitude of **b** as well.

Wait, no, in this approach, I assumed **a** is a unit vector, but **b** is not necessarily a unit vector. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, let me clarify.

If I set **a** as a unit vector (1,0), then **b** is a vector with magnitude |**b**| and angle 29° with **a**, so **b** = (|**b**| cos29°, |**b**| sin29° )

Then, (**b** - **a**) is (|**b**| cos29° - 1, |**b**| sin29° )

Then, the angle between **a** and (**b** - **a**) is given by:

cosφ = ( **a** • (**b** - **a**) ) / ( |**a**| |**b** - **a**| )

= (1*(|**b**| cos29° - 1) + 0*(|**b**| sin29° )) / (1 * sqrt( (|**b**| cos29° - 1)^2 + (|**b**| sin29° )^2 ) )

Simplify numerator: |**b**| cos29° - 1

Denominator: sqrt( |**b**|² cos²29° - 2|**b**| cos29° + 1 + |**b**|² sin²29° ) = sqrt( |**b**|² (cos²29° + sin²29° ) - 2|**b**| cos29° + 1 ) = sqrt( |**b**|² - 2|**b**| cos29° + 1 )

So, cosφ = (|**b**| cos29° - 1 ) / sqrt( |**b**|² - 2|**b**| cos29° + 1 )

But in the earlier approach, we had:

cosφ = (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° / (|**a** - **b**| )

But when we set **a** as a unit vector, |**a**| = 1, so:

cosφ = (1 - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° / (|**b** - **a**| )

But in the vector approach, it's (|**b**| cos29° - 1 ) / sqrt( |**b**|² - 2|**b**| cos29° + 1 )

Wait, so these are different expressions, but they should be equivalent.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, in the first approach, I had:

cosφ = (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° / (|**a** - **b**| )

But in this vector approach, it's (|**b**| cos29° - 1 ) / sqrt( |**b**|² - 2|**b**| cos29° + 1 )

Let me check if these are consistent.

From the first approach, with |**a**| = 1, we had:

cosφ = (1 - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° / |**b** - **a**|

But in the vector approach, it's (|**b**| cos29° - 1 ) / |**b** - **a**|

So, the numerator is negative of each other, but denominator is same.

Thus, cosφ = - (1 - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° / |**b** - **a**|

But in the vector approach, it's (|**b**| cos29° - 1 ) / |**b** - **a**|

Which is same as - (1 - |**b**| cos29° ) / |**b** - **a**|

So, cosφ = - (1 - |**b**| cos29° ) / |**b** - **a**| * cos84°

Wait, that's different, which suggests that perhaps my earlier approach had a sign error.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, in the first approach, we had:

cos29° - k = sqrt(1 + k² - 2k cos29° ) * cos84°

But in the vector approach, we have:

cosφ = (|**b**| cos29° - 1 ) / |**b** - **a**|

But in the earlier approach, we had:

cosφ = [ (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° ] / |**a** - **b**|

Which, with |**a**| = 1, is:

cosφ = (1 - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° / |**a** - **b**|

But in the vector approach, it's (|**b**| cos29° - 1 ) / |**a** - **b**|

So, cosφ = - (1 - |**b**| cos29° ) / |**a** - **b**|

Thus, combining both, we have:

(1 - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° / |**a** - **b**| = - (1 - |**b**| cos29° ) / |**a** - **b**|

Which implies that:

cos84° = -1

But that's not true, since cos84° ≈ 0.1045.

Therefore, there must be a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps I forgot a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, in the initial setup, the angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**) is 84°, so the dot product is negative, as **b** and (**a** - **b**) have an angle greater than 90°, so their dot product is negative.

So, perhaps I should have considered that in the equation.

Wait, in the initial setup, we had:

**b** • (**a** - **b**) = |**b**| |**a** - **b**| cos84°, but since the angle is 84°, which is acute, but wait, actually, if the angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**) is 84°, which is acute, but (**a** - **b**) could be in a different direction, so the dot product could be positive or negative.

Wait, but in the vector approach, **b** • (**a** - **b**) = |**b**| |**a** - **b**| cos84°, which is positive since cos84° is positive.

But in reality, **b** • (**a** - **b**) = |**b**| |**a** - **b**| cosθ, where θ is the angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**), which is 84°, so it's positive.

But in the vector approach, we computed cosφ as (|**b**| cos29° - 1 ) / |**b** - **a**|, which equals cos86.7°, which is positive, but in reality, we saw that (|**b**| cos29° - 1 ) can be positive or negative.

Wait, in the vector approach, if |**b**| cos29° - 1 is positive, then cosφ is positive, implying φ is acute, but when we computed earlier with **a** as (1,0) and **b** as (|**b**| cos29°, |**b**| sin29° ), we found that cosφ ≈ -0.2504, which would imply φ ≈ 104.4°, which contradicts the earlier result.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when we have **a** as a unit vector, we are considering the angle between **a** and (**b** - **a**), but depending on the direction of (**b** - **a**), the angle could be acute or obtuse.

Wait, in the vector approach, with **a** = (1,0), **b** = (|**b**| cos29°, |**b**| sin29° ), then (**b** - **a**) = (|**b**| cos29° - 1, |**b**| sin29° )

So, the angle between **a** and (**b** - **a**) is given by the dot product formula, which can be either acute or obtuse.

But in the initial problem, they don't specify whether it's acute or obtuse, so perhaps in the vector approach, with **a** as (1,0), we can compute it.

But in our initial approach, we found that cosφ ≈ 0.0570, which is positive, leading to φ ≈ 86.7°, but in the vector approach, when we set **a** as a unit vector, we have cosφ ≈ (|**b**| cos29° - 1 ) / |**b** - **a**|.

But in that case, if |**b**| cos29° - 1 is positive, then cosφ is positive, implying φ is acute, but in reality, from the first approach, we had 86.7°, which is acute.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the vector approach.

Wait, in the vector approach, when **a** is a unit vector, and **b** is not a unit vector, then (**b** - **a**) is not necessarily of unit magnitude. So, perhaps the angle can be either acute or obtuse depending on the relative magnitudes.

Wait, but in our initial problem, from the quadratic equation, we found that |**b**| ≈ 0.8206 |**a**|, so |**b**| < |**a**|, so |**b**| cos29° - 1 is negative, because |**b**| < |**a**|, and cos29° ≈ 0.8746, so 0.8206 * 0.8746 ≈ 0.719, so 0.719 - 1 ≈ -0.281, which is negative.

Thus, in the vector approach, (|**b**| cos29° - 1 ) ≈ -0.281, and |**b** - **a**| ≈ sqrt( (|**b**| cos29° - 1 )^2 + (|**b**| sin29° )^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.078 + 0.101 ) ≈ sqrt(0.179 ) ≈ 0.423.

Thus, cosφ ≈ (-0.281 ) / 0.423 ≈ -0.664, which would imply φ ≈ 131.4°, which is conflicting with our earlier result.

But earlier, in the first approach, we had cosφ ≈ 0.057, which is positive, implying φ ≈ 86.7°, but in the vector approach, we get cosφ ≈ -0.664, implying φ ≈ 131.4°, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, perhaps the first approach was incorrect because I forgot to consider the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**), which is 180° - 84°, but no, because the angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**) is 84°, so the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) would be 180° - 84°, but only if **a** and **b** are in specific directions.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**) is 84°, which is acute, so **b** and (**a** - **b**) are pointing in somewhat similar directions, so (**a** - **b**) is pointing in a direction closer to **b**.

So, when you subtract **b** from **a**, you get a vector that is in the opposite direction relative to **b**.

Wait, perhaps a diagram would help, but since I can't draw it, I'll try to imagine.

If **a** and **b** are at 29°, and (**a** - **b**) is such that the angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**) is 84°, which is acute, so (**a** - **b**) is pointing in a direction that makes an acute angle with **b**.

So, perhaps (**a** - **b**) is pointing more towards the direction opposite to **a**, but at an angle of 84° from **b**.

Therefore, the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is greater than 90°, making it obtuse.

But in our first approach, we found cosφ ≈ 0.057, leading to φ ≈ 86.7°, which is acute, conflicting with this.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is actually 180° - φ, so if φ is 86.7°, then 180° - 86.7° ≈ 93.3°, which is close to our earlier vector approach result.

Wait, but perhaps the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is 180° - φ, where φ is the angle computed earlier.

Wait, if in the vector approach, we found cosφ ≈ -0.664, leading to φ ≈ 131.4°, then the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) would be 180° - 131.4° ≈ 48.6°, which is not matching with the first approach.

I think perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and the vector approach is more accurate.

Wait, in the vector approach, let's compute it precisely.

Given that **a** is a unit vector (1, 0).

**b** is (|**b**| cos29°, |**b**| sin29° )

So, (**b** - **a**) = (|**b**| cos29° - 1, |**b**| sin29° )

Compute |**b** - **a**| = sqrt( (|**b**| cos29° - 1)^2 + (|**b**| sin29° )^2 ) = sqrt( |**b**|² - 2|**b**| cos29° + 1 + |**b**|² sin²29° ) = sqrt( |**b**|² (1 + sin²29° ) - 2|**b**| cos29° + 1 )

Now, the angle φ between **a** and (**b** - **a**) is given by:

cosφ = ( **a** • (**b** - **a**) ) / ( |**a**| |**b** - **a**| )

= (1*(|**b**| cos29° - 1) + 0*(|**b**| sin29° )) / (1 * |**b** - **a**| )

= (|**b**| cos29° - 1 ) / |**b** - **a**|

From the problem, we had |**b**| ≈ 0.8206, so let's compute:

|**b**| cos29° ≈ 0.8206 * 0.8746 ≈ 0.719

So, |**b**| cos29° - 1 ≈ 0.719 - 1 ≈ -0.281

Compute |**b** - **a**|:

= sqrt( (0.8206)^2 - 2*0.8206*0.8746 + 1 + (0.8206)^2 * (0.1229) )

Wait, perhaps better to compute numerically.

Compute each term:

|**b**| = 0.8206

cos29° ≈ 0.8746

sin29° ≈ 0.4848

So,

(**b** - **a**) = (0.8206 * 0.8746 - 1, 0.8206 * 0.4848 )

= (0.719 - 1, 0.396 )

= (-0.281, 0.396 )

Then, |**b** - **a**| = sqrt( (-0.281)^2 + (0.396)^2 ) = sqrt(0.0789 + 0.1568 ) = sqrt(0.2357 ) ≈ 0.4855

Then, cosφ = (-0.281 ) / 0.4855 ≈ -0.579

Thus, φ ≈ arccos(-0.579 ) ≈ 125.3°, which is obtuse.

Wait, but earlier, with the first approach, I had φ ≈ 86.7°, which is acute.

But in reality, from the vector approach, it's 125.3°, which is more accurate.

But why the discrepancy?

Wait, because in the first approach, I assumed that |**b**| is the magnitude of **b**, but perhaps I didn't account for the actual magnitude correctly.

Wait, in the first approach, I had:

cosφ = (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° / |**a** - **b**|

But in reality, |**a** - **b**| is sqrt( |**a**|² + |**b**|² - 2|**a**| |**b**| cos29° )

In the vector approach, with |**a**| = 1 and |**b**| ≈ 0.8206, then:

|**a** - **b**| = sqrt(1 + 0.6735 - 2 * 1 * 0.8206 * 0.8746 )

= sqrt(1.6735 - 2 * 0.8206 * 0.8746 )

Compute 2 * 0.8206 * 0.8746 ≈ 2 * 0.719 ≈ 1.438

So,

|**a** - **b**| ≈ sqrt(1.6735 - 1.438 ) ≈ sqrt(0.2355 ) ≈ 0.4853

Which matches our vector approach result.

So, in the first approach, we had:

cosφ = (1 - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° / |**a** - **b**|

= (1 - 0.719 ) * 0.1045 / 0.4853

= (0.281 ) * 0.1045 / 0.4853 ≈ 0.02937 / 0.4853 ≈ 0.0605

Wait, but in the vector approach, cosφ ≈ -0.579

Wait, that's a big discrepancy, so clearly, my first approach was incorrect.

Therefore, the vector approach is more accurate, and the angle is approximately 125.3°, which is obtuse.

But in the problem statement, it's asking for the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**). In the vector approach, that angle is 125.3°, but in the problem, it's given that the angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**) is 84°, which is acute.

So, the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is 125.3°, but that contradicts the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my vector approach.

Wait, in the vector approach, when I computed the angle φ between **a** and (**b** - **a**), which is the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) as negative, it gave me cosφ ≈ -0.579, which is 125.3°, but in the problem, they didn't specify the direction, so perhaps the acute angle is 180° - 125.3° = 54.7°, but that's not 86.7°, so perhaps not.

Wait, but that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach had a mistake, and the correct angle is 125.3°, which is obtuse.

But then, how come the first approach gave me φ ≈ 86.7°, which is acute?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach, perhaps in the initial equation.

Wait, in the first approach, I had:

cosφ = (|**a**| - |**b**| cos29° ) * cos84° / |**a** - **b**|

But in reality, in the vector approach, it's:

cosφ = (|**b**| cos29° - 1 ) / |**a** - **b**|

Which is different.

So, perhaps in the first approach, I incorrectly set up the equation.

Therefore, given that the vector approach yields cosφ ≈ -0.579, which is 125.3°, perhaps the correct answer is 125.3°, but that's inconsistent with the problem's given angle of 84°, which is acute.

Wait, but given that the angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**) is 84°, which is acute, the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is 125.3°, which is obtuse, so it's possible.

Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is 125.3°, which is approximately 125°, but let me check.

Wait, let me try to compute it more accurately.

From the vector approach:

**a** = (1, 0)

**b** = (0.8206 * cos29°, 0.8206 * sin29° )

Compute cos29° ≈ 0.8746

sin29° ≈ 0.4848

So,

**b** ≈ (0.8206 * 0.8746, 0.8206 * 0.4848 ) ≈ (0.719, 0.396 )

**b** - **a** ≈ (-0.281, 0.396 )

Compute |**b** - **a**| ≈ sqrt( (-0.281)^2 + 0.396^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.0789 + 0.1568 ) ≈ sqrt(0.2357 ) ≈ 0.4855

Then, **a** • (**b** - **a**) ≈ (1, 0) • (-0.281, 0.396 ) ≈ -0.281

Thus, cosφ ≈ -0.281 / 0.4855 ≈ -0.579

Thus, φ ≈ arccos(-0.579 ) ≈ 125.3°, so the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is approximately 125.3°, which is 125.3°, approximately 125°.

But this contradicts the initial approach where I had φ ≈ 86.7°, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use the correct formula.

In the vector approach, we have:

cosφ = ( **a** • (**b** - **a**) ) / ( |**a**| |**b** - **a**| ) = ( |**b**| cos29° - 1 ) / |**b** - **a**|

From this, if |**b**| ≈ 0.8206, then:

cosφ ≈ (0.8206 * 0.8746 - 1 ) / 0.4855 ≈ (0.719 - 1 ) / 0.4855 ≈ (-0.281 ) / 0.4855 ≈ -0.579

Which is approximately 125.3°, so the angle is 125.3°, which is approximately 125°.

But in the problem, it's given that the angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**) is 84°, which is acute, so the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is 125.3°, which is obtuse.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 125°, but let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the vector approach.

Wait, let me recompute.

Given that **a** is (1,0), **b** is (0.719, 0.396 )

(**b** - **a**) is (-0.281, 0.396 )

|**b** - **a**| is sqrt( (-0.281)^2 + (0.396)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.0789 + 0.1568 ) ≈ sqrt(0.2357 ) ≈ 0.4855

Dot product with **a** is -0.281

Thus, cosφ = -0.281 / 0.4855 ≈ -0.579

Which is 125.3°, as before.

So, the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is 125.3°, so approximately 125°.

But in the first approach, I had 86.7°, which is acute, but this contradicts the vector approach.

Therefore, I think I must have made a mistake in the first approach, perhaps in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 125.3°, but that's not matching the expected answer.

Wait, but in the problem, the angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**) is 84°, which is acute, so the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is 180° - 84° = 96°, but that's not matching with the vector approach result of 125.3°, so that's inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is 180° - 84° = 96°, but in reality, in the vector approach, it's 125.3°, which suggests that the initial approach was incorrect.

Thus, perhaps the correct answer is 125.3°, which is approximately 125°, so I can write it as \boxed{125^\circ}.

But wait, just to be thorough, let me check the exact calculation.

Compute cosφ = -0.579, then φ = arccos(-0.579 ) ≈ 125.3°, which is approximately 125.3°, so 125° is a good approximate.

But let me check with another method.

Alternatively, perhaps using the sine formula.

In triangle formed by **a**, **b**, and (**a** - **b**), perhaps we can use the sine formula, but I think that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the angle using the relationship between the vectors and solve for φ.

But given that the vector approach gives 125.3°, perhaps that's the correct answer.

But wait, the problem is in English, and the initial angle given is 29°, so perhaps the answer is 106°, but that doesn't align with calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the vector approach.

Wait, let me compute the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) again, using exact values.

Given that **a** is (1,0), **b** is (0.8206 * cos29°, 0.8206 * sin29° )

cos29° ≈ 0.8746, sin29° ≈ 0.4848

So, **b** ≈ (0.8206 * 0.8746, 0.8206 * 0.4848 ) ≈ (0.719, 0.396 )

(**b** - **a**) ≈ (-0.281, 0.396 )

Compute |**b** - **a**| = sqrt( (-0.281)^2 + 0.396^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.0789 + 0.1568 ) ≈ sqrt(0.2357 ) ≈ 0.4855

Dot product of **a** and (**b** - **a**) is (-0.281 )

Thus, cosφ = -0.281 / 0.4855 ≈ -0.579

Which gives φ ≈ 125.3°, so I think that's accurate.

Therefore, the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is approximately 125.3°, so I can write it as 125°, but let me check.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use exact values.

From the initial equations, we had:

From angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**) being 84°, which gave us:

k ≈ 0.8206

Which led to |**b**| ≈ 0.8206, and then in the vector approach, we found the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) as 125.3°, so I think that's the correct answer.

But since the problem is in English and I might have made a mistake in interpreting the angle, perhaps the correct answer is 106°, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps my vector approach is correct, and the angle is 125.3°, so I think I'll go with that.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{125^\circ}
</think>

Given vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we know that the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(29^\circ\), and the angle between \(\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}\) is \(84^\circ\). We need to find the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\).

1. **Dot Product and Magnitude Calculations**:
   - The dot product of \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(|\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{b}| \cos 29^\circ\).
   - The dot product of \(\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}\) is \(|\mathbf{b}|^2 - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}\).
   - The magnitude of \(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}\) is \(\sqrt{|\mathbf{a}|^2 + |\mathbf{b}|^2 - 2|\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{b}| \cos 29^\circ}\).

2. **Using the Given Angles**:
   - The angle between \(\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}\) is \(84^\circ\), so we use the dot product formula:
     \[
     \cos 84^\circ = \frac{\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})}{|\mathbf{b}| |\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}|}
     \]
   - Substituting the dot product and magnitudes, we get:
     \[
     \cos 84^\circ = \frac{|\mathbf{b}|^2 - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{|\mathbf{b}| |\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}|}
     \]

3. **Vector Approach**:
   - Assume \(\mathbf{a}\) is a unit vector \((1, 0)\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \((|\mathbf{b}| \cos 29^\circ, |\mathbf{b}| \sin 29^\circ)\).
   - Compute \(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}\) as \((|\mathbf{b}| \cos 29^\circ - 1, |\mathbf{b}| \sin 29^\circ)\).
   - The magnitude of \(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}\) is calculated, and the dot product with \(\mathbf{a}\) is found.

4. **Angle Calculation**:
   - Using the dot product formula for the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\):
     \[
     \cos \phi = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})}{|\mathbf{a}| |\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|}
     \]
   - The dot product \(\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})\) is \(1 - |\mathbf{b}| \cos 29^\circ\).
   - The magnitude \(|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|\) is computed.

5. **Result**:
   - After detailed calculations, the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is found to be approximately \(125.3^\circ\).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{125^\circ}
\]
