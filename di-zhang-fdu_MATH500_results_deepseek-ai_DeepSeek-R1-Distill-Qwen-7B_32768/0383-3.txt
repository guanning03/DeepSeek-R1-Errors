Question:
A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. The sum of a particular set of three consecutive positive integers is a three-digit palindrome. If the sum is less than 220, what is the greatest possible value for the largest of the three integers in the set?

Correct Answer:
The sum of the set $\{n-1, n, n+1\}$ of three consecutive integers is $3n$.  Therefore, we are looking for the largest three-digit palindromic multiple of $3$ less than $220$.  Checking through $212, 202, 191, 181$, and $171$, we find that $171$ is the greatest palindrome which is also a multiple of $3$.  Solving $3n=171$ for $n$ we find $n=57$. The three integers are $56,57,58$, and the greatest is $\boxed{58}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out the greatest possible value for the largest of three consecutive positive integers, given that their sum is a three-digit palindrome and the sum is less than 220. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's recall what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. So for three-digit numbers, it's numbers like 121, 343, 555, where the first and last digits are the same, and the middle digit can be anything. So the sum we're looking for is a three-digit number where the hundreds digit equals the units digit.

Now, the problem says the sum is less than 220. So, we're looking for a three-digit palindrome less than 220. Let me list all the three-digit palindromes less than 220. They start from 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, 212. Wait, 212 is 212, which is less than 220, right? So that's the next one. After that would be 222, but that's 222, which is over 220. So, our possible palindromic sums are from 101 up to 212.

But the sum is the total of three consecutive integers. Let's denote the three consecutive integers as n, n+1, and n+2. So their sum would be n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3, which simplifies to 3(n + 1). So, the sum is three times (n + 1).

Therefore, 3(n + 1) must be equal to one of these three-digit palindromes. So, the sum is a three-digit palindrome, and it's divisible by 3.

So, let's list the possible palindromic sums: 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, 212.

Our task is to see which of these are divisible by 3 because the sum is 3(n+1). So, if the sum is divisible by 3, then (n + 1) will be an integer, which it has to be because n is a positive integer.

Let me check each palindrome:

1. 101: Divided by 3 is approximately 33.666... Not an integer. So, not divisible by 3.

2. 111: Divided by 3 is 37. That's an integer. So, 111 is a possible sum.

3. 121: Divided by 3 is approximately 40.333... Not an integer.

4. 131: Divided by 3 is approximately 43.666... Not an integer.

5. 141: Divided by 3 is 47. So, 141 is a possible sum.

6. 151: Divided by 3 is approximately 50.333... Not an integer.

7. 161: Divided by 3 is approximately 53.666... Not an integer.

8. 171: Divided by 3 is 57. So, 171 is a possible sum.

9. 181: Divided by 3 is approximately 60.333... Not an integer.

10. 191: Divided by 3 is approximately 63.666... Not an integer.

11. 202: Divided by 3 is approximately 67.333... Not an integer.

12. 212: Divided by 3 is approximately 70.666... Not an integer.

So, from the list, the sums that are palindromes and divisible by 3 are 111, 141, 171. These are the possible sums.

Now, we need to find the largest possible value for the largest of the three integers. Since we're looking for the largest possible, we should consider the largest possible sum first, which is 171. So, let's check if 171 is a valid sum.

If the sum is 171, then 3(n + 1) = 171. So, n + 1 = 171 / 3 = 57. Therefore, n = 56. So, the three consecutive integers would be 56, 57, and 58. Hence, the largest integer is 58.

Wait, but let me check if 171 is indeed the largest possible sum. The next sum after 171 is 202 and 212, but both of these are not divisible by 3, so they can't be expressed as 3(n + 1). So, 171 is the largest possible sum that is a palindrome, divisible by 3, and less than 220.

But hold on, just to make sure, is 171 the only possible sum? Let me confirm the palindromes again.

Wait, 202 is a palindrome, but it's not divisible by 3. 212 is also a palindrome, but it's not divisible by 3. So, 171 is the largest possible.

So, if 171 is the sum, then n = 56, so the numbers are 56, 57, 58. Hence, the largest is 58.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. The three numbers are 56, 57, 58. Their sum is indeed 56 + 57 + 58 = 171. 171 is a palindrome, correct.

But just to ensure, is there a larger sum? Let's see. The next palindrome after 171 is 181, which is not divisible by 3, then 191, also not. Then 202, not, 212, not. So, 171 is indeed the largest sum that satisfies the given conditions.

Wait, but hang on another thoughtâ€”could there be a palindrome between 171 and 212 that is a multiple of 3? For example, let's see: 171, the next palindrome is 181, which is not a multiple of 3. Then 191, same thing. Then 202, not, 212, not. So, no, 171 is the next one after 141 and 111.

So, 171 is the maximum sum that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the three consecutive numbers are 56, 57, 58, with the largest being 58.

But, let's make sure that we're not missing any other palindromic sum between 171 and 212 that is a multiple of 3. Hmm. Let's see: 171 is 171, 180 is not a palindrome, 181 is the next palindrome. 189 is not a palindrome, 190 is not, 191 is a palindrome but not divisible by 3, 200 is not a palindrome, 201 is not, 202 is a palindrome but not divisible by 3, 210 is not, 211 is a palindrome but not divisible by 3, 212 is a palindrome but not divisible by 3.

So, yes, 171 is indeed the largest such sum.

So, the largest integer in this set is 58.

Wait, but hold on a second. Is 58 the largest possible? Let me think differently.

Suppose we have three consecutive numbers: n, n+1, n+2. Their sum is 3n + 3, which is 3(n + 1). So, the sum is a palindrome, less than 220, and divisible by 3.

We found that 3(n + 1) can be 111, 141, or 171. So, n + 1 can be 37, 47, or 57. Hence, n can be 36, 46, or 56. Therefore, the sets would be:

- For 111: 36, 37, 38. Largest is 38.

- For 141: 46, 47, 48. Largest is 48.

- For 171: 56, 57, 58. Largest is 58.

So, 58 is the largest possible.

But wait, just to make sure, is there any palindrome between 171 and 212 that's a multiple of 3? For example, let's take 180. 180 is not a palindrome. 189 is not a palindrome. 190, not. 192, not. 195, not. 201, not. 204, not. 207, not. 210, not. 213, not. So, no palindromic numbers that are multiples of 3 between 171 and 212 except 202 and 212, which aren't divisible by 3.

Therefore, 171 is indeed the largest possible sum, leading to the largest integer being 58.

Wait, but just to check: if the sum is 171, which is n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3 = 171. So, 3n = 168, so n = 56. So, integers are 56,57,58.

But let me make sure that 56 is a positive integer. Yes, definitely. So, that's valid.

Is there a way to get a larger integer? Suppose someone argues that 57 is the middle number, so can we have a larger middle number? But if the sum is fixed as 171, then n has to be 56. So, the largest number is 58.

Alternatively, suppose we have a larger middle number, say 57, then the sum would be 55 + 56 + 57 = 168. 168 is less than 220, but is it a palindrome? 168 reversed is 861, which is not the same. So, 168 is not a palindrome.

Similarly, if the middle number is 58, the sum would be 57 + 58 + 59 = 174. 174 is not a palindrome. 174 reversed is 471, not the same.

So, moving up, 59: 58 + 59 + 60 = 177. 177 is a palindrome. Wait, 177 is a palindrome. So, is 177 a possible sum?

Wait, 177 is a palindrome. 177 divided by 3 is 59. So, n + 1 = 59, so n = 58. So, the numbers are 58, 59, 60. Their sum is 58 + 59 + 60 = 177, which is a palindrome.

Wait, so 177 is a larger palindrome than 171, and it's also a multiple of 3. So why did I not consider that earlier?

Hold on, did I make a mistake in my initial assessment? Let me go back.

I had listed 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, 212 as three-digit palindromes less than 220.

But 177 is also a three-digit palindrome less than 220. So why didn't I include that?

Ah, I see. Because when I listed the palindromes, I started from 101, 111, ..., 191, then 202, 212. But 177 is between 171 and 181, which I didn't include.

Wait, so I need to check all three-digit palindromes between 100 and 220.

So, let me correct that.

Starting from 101:

101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 201, 211, 222.

Wait, but 222 is above 220, so we can exclude that. So, the palindromes between 100 and 220 are:

101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 201, 211.

Wait, 201 is a palindrome, right? 201 reversed is 102, which is not the same, so 201 is not a palindrome.

Wait, hold on. 201 is not a palindrome because the first digit is 2 and the last digit is 1, which are different. So, 201 is not a palindrome. Similarly, 211 is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards. 211 reversed is 112, which is not the same, wait, no, wait, 211 is 2-1-1, reversed is 1-1-2, which is 112, which is not the same as 211. So, 211 is not a palindrome.

Wait, no, wait, 211 is a palindrome? Let me check.

Wait, 211: first digit 2, second digit 1, third digit 1. So, first digit is 2, last digit is 1, so they aren't the same. So, 211 is not a palindrome. So, 211 is not a palindrome. Therefore, the palindromes less than 220 are:

101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191.

So, 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191.

So, in that case, 177 is not a palindrome. So, 177 is not a palindrome.

Wait, hold on, 177 is 1-7-7. First digit is 1, last digit is 7. So, not the same. So, 177 is not a palindrome. So, my initial list was correct.

Therefore, the three-digit palindromes less than 220 are 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191.

So, 177 is not a palindrome, so 171 is indeed the largest three-digit palindrome less than 220 that is divisible by 3.

Therefore, n = 56, so the numbers are 56,57,58, with largest 58.

But wait, hold on, let's think again. Is 171 the only one? Because 180 is a multiple of 3, but it's not a palindrome. 168 is a multiple of 3, not a palindrome. So, yes, 171 is the only one in that list that is both a palindrome and a multiple of 3.

Therefore, 58 is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check another angle. Maybe the sum is not necessarily 3n + 3, but perhaps for other representations? Wait, three consecutive numbers: n, n+1, n+2. Sum is 3n + 3, which is 3(n + 1). So, that's correct.

Alternatively, is there a way for the three consecutive numbers to be non-consecutive integers? But the problem says three consecutive positive integers, so they have to be consecutive.

So, another way is, perhaps the middle number is n, so the three numbers are n-1, n, n+1. Then sum is (n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n. So, the sum is 3n. So, 3n is a palindrome. So, 3n must be a three-digit palindrome less than 220.

So, 3n < 220, so n < 220/3, which is approximately 73.333. So, n can be at most 73.

So, the sum is 3n, which is a three-digit palindrome. So, sum is 101, 111, ..., up to maybe 210.

But 3n is a palindrome, and 3n < 220.

So, let's list the three-digit palindromes that are multiples of 3 and less than 220.

So, starting from 101:

101: 101 is not a multiple of 3, as we saw earlier.

111: 111 is a multiple of 3, as 1+1+1=3, which is divisible by 3.

121: 121 divided by 3 is not an integer, as 1+2+1=4, which isn't divisible by 3.

131: 1+3+1=5, not divisible by 3.

141: 1+4+1=6, which is divisible by 3.

151: 1+5+1=7, not divisible by 3.

161: 1+6+1=8, not divisible by 3.

171: 1+7+1=9, which is divisible by 3.

181: 1+8+1=10, not divisible by 3.

191: 1+9+1=11, not divisible by 3.

201: 2+0+1=3, so 201 is a multiple of 3.

211: 2+1+1=4, not divisible by 3.

222: 2+2+2=6, which is divisible by 3, but it's over 220.

So, the three-digit palindromes less than 220 that are multiples of 3 are: 111, 141, 171, 201.

So, the sums can be 111,141,171,201.

So, 3n can be 111, so n=37, numbers are 36,37,38.

3n=141, so n=47, numbers 46,47,48.

3n=171, so n=57, numbers 56,57,58.

3n=201, so n=67, numbers 66,67,68.

Wait, so 201 is another possible sum.

So, then the numbers are 66,67,68, with the largest being 68.

But wait, hold on, 201 is a palindrome, 201 is less than 220, and it's a multiple of 3.

So, that would mean the numbers are 66,67,68, so the largest is 68. That's larger than 58.

Wait, so why didn't I think of this earlier?

So, in this approach, 3n is the sum, which is a palindrome. So, 3n can be 111, 141, 171, or 201.

So, 201 is another possible sum.

So, 201 is a larger sum, so the largest integer would be 68.

Therefore, that's a larger number.

Wait, so which approach is correct?

Earlier, I considered the sum as 3(n + 1), so 3(n + 1) is a palindrome, leading to n + 1 = 37, 47, 57, 67, etc. So, n would be 36,46,56,66.

But in this second approach, considering the sum as 3n, so n is the middle number, 3n is the sum, which is a palindrome.

So, in this case, 3n can be 111, 141, 171, 201. So, n is 37, 47, 57, 67. So, the numbers are 36,37,38 or 46,47,48 etc.

Wait, so in the first approach, the largest number was 58, and in the second approach, it's 68. So, which is correct?

Wait, I think both are correct, but in the first approach, if the numbers are n, n+1, n+2, then the sum is 3n + 3, so 3(n + 1). In the second approach, if the numbers are n-1, n, n+1, then the sum is 3n.

So, both are valid, but different representations.

So, depending on which representation we take, the middle number is n or n + 1.

Therefore, in the first case, the middle number is n + 1, so the largest number is n + 2.

In the second case, the middle number is n, so the largest number is n + 1.

So, in the first approach, 3(n + 1) is the sum. So, the largest number is n + 2 = (sum / 3) - 1 + 2 = sum / 3 + 1.

In the second approach, the largest number is n + 1 = (sum / 3) + 1.

So, in the first approach, if sum is 171, then n + 1 = 57, so n = 56, so largest number is 58.

In the second approach, if sum is 201, then n = 67, so largest number is 68.

So, both are correct, but in each case, the middle number is different.

So, the problem says "three consecutive positive integers". It doesn't specify whether the middle number is considered n or not. So, both are acceptable.

But in the first approach, 171 is the sum, leading to the largest number as 58, while in the second approach, 201 is the sum, leading to the largest number as 68.

So, which sum is larger? 201 is larger than 171, so if 201 is a valid sum, then 68 would be the correct answer.

But wait, is 201 a valid sum? Let me check.

If the numbers are 66,67,68, then their sum is 66 + 67 + 68 = 201, which is indeed a palindrome, and less than 220.

So, 201 is a valid sum, so 68 is a valid largest number.

But why, in my initial approach, I didn't get 201?

Because in my initial approach, I considered the sum as 3(n + 1), so the middle number was n + 1. So, 3(n + 1) = 201 implies n + 1 = 67, so n = 66, so numbers are 66,67,68.

Wait, so actually, in the first approach, if 3(n + 1) = 201, then n + 1 = 67, so n = 66. So, numbers are 66,67,68. So, the largest number is 68.

So, in that case, 68 is the correct answer.

So, why did I not consider 201 earlier? Because I was listing the palindromes and only considered those where the sum was 3(n + 1). But 201 is also a palindrome, so why didn't I include it in my first analysis?

Because in my initial approach, I considered n as the first number, so the numbers are n, n + 1, n + 2, and the sum is 3n + 3.

So, 3n + 3 must be a palindrome. So, 3n + 3 = palindrome.

So, 3n + 3 can be 101, 111, 121, etc.

So, let's solve 3n + 3 = palindrome.

So, 3n + 3 = 101: 3n = 98, n is not integer.

3n + 3 = 111: 3n = 108, n = 36.

3n + 3 = 121: 3n = 118, n is not integer.

3n + 3 = 131: 3n = 128, n is not integer.

3n + 3 = 141: 3n = 138, n = 46.

3n + 3 = 151: 3n = 148, n is not integer.

3n + 3 = 161: 3n = 158, n is not integer.

3n + 3 = 171: 3n = 168, n = 56.

3n + 3 = 181: 3n = 178, n is not integer.

3n + 3 = 191: 3n = 188, n is not integer.

3n + 3 = 201: 3n = 198, n = 66.

3n + 3 = 211: 3n = 208, n is not integer.

3n + 3 = 221: Over 220.

So, in this case, n can be 36,46,56,66. So, the numbers are:

- 36,37,38: sum 111

- 46,47,48: sum 141

- 56,57,58: sum 171

- 66,67,68: sum 201

So, these are the four possible sets. Therefore, the largest integer in the set is 68.

Therefore, 68 is a possible largest number. And since 201 is less than 220, this is acceptable.

So, why didn't I consider this earlier? Because in my initial approach, I considered the sum as 3(n + 1), but in the second approach, I considered the sum as 3n.

So, depending on how you represent the three consecutive numbers, the sum can be expressed as either 3(n) or 3(n + 1). So, both are correct, but the key is to recognize that 3n must be a palindrome, so the largest such palindrome less than 220 is 201.

Therefore, the largest possible value for the largest integer is 68.

So, my initial mistake was not considering that the sum could be expressed as 3n, which allows for a larger palindrome. So, 201 is a valid sum, leading to the largest number being 68.

Therefore, the correct answer should be 68.

But let me confirm once more.

If the three consecutive numbers are 66,67,68, their sum is 66 + 67 + 68.

Calculating that: 66 + 67 is 133, plus 68 is 201, which is a three-digit palindrome, and 201 is less than 220.

Yes, that's correct.

So, 68 is a valid answer.

Wait, so why did I initially have only 171 as the largest sum? Because I didn't consider the second representation where the sum is 3n, which allows for a larger palindrome.

So, in summary, the problem is about three consecutive integers whose sum is a three-digit palindrome less than 220. The sum can be expressed as 3n, where n is the middle number. Since 3n must be a palindrome, the largest such palindrome is 201, which gives n = 67, so the numbers are 66,67,68, with the largest being 68.

Therefore, the greatest possible value for the largest of the three integers is 68.

**Final Answer**
The greatest possible value for the largest of the three integers is \boxed{68}.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find three consecutive positive integers whose sum is a three-digit palindrome less than 220. The goal is to determine the greatest possible value for the largest of these three integers.

1. **Understanding the problem**:
   - A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.
   - The sum of three consecutive integers \( n, n+1, n+2 \) is \( 3n + 3 \).
   - The sum must be a three-digit palindrome less than 220.

2. **Finding the possible sums**:
   - The sum \( 3(n + 1) \) must be a three-digit palindrome.
   - The largest three-digit palindromes less than 220 are 191, 181, 171, 161, 151, 141, 131, 121, 111, 101.
   - We need to check which of these are divisible by 3.

3. **Checking divisibility by 3**:
   - 111, 141, 171 are divisible by 3.
   - These sums correspond to \( n + 1 \) values of 37, 47, and 57, respectively.

4. **Considering another approach**:
   - The sum can also be expressed as \( 3n \) where \( n \) is the middle number.
   - The three-digit palindromes less than 220 that are multiples of 3 are 111, 141, 171, and 201.

5. **Finding the largest sum**:
   - The largest palindrome is 201, which corresponds to \( n = 67 \).
   - The three consecutive integers are 66, 67, and 68.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The largest integer in this set is 68.

Thus, the greatest possible value for the largest of the three integers is \(\boxed{68}\).
