Question:
A hexagon is inscribed in a circle: [asy]
pair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF, pO;
pO = (0, 0);
pA = pO + dir(-10);
pB = pO + dir(60);
pC = pO + dir(130);
pD = pO + dir(170);
pE = pO + dir(-160);
pF = pO + dir(-80);
draw(pA--pB--pC--pD--pE--pF--pA);
label("$105^\circ$", pF, N * 2);
label("$110^\circ$", pB, SW * 1.5);
label("$\alpha$", pD, E);
draw(circle(pO, 1));
[/asy] What is the measure of $\alpha$, in degrees?

Correct Answer:
Labeling our vertices will help a great deal, as will drawing a few radii: [asy]
pair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF, pO;
pO = (0, 0);
pA = pO + dir(-10);
pB = pO + dir(60);
pC = pO + dir(130);
pD = pO + dir(170);
pE = pO + dir(-160);
pF = pO + dir(-80);
draw(pA--pB--pC--pD--pE--pF--pA);
draw(pA--pO--pC--pO--pE--pO, red);
draw(circle(pO, 1));
label("$O$", pO, NE);
label("$A$", pA, E);
label("$B$", pB, NE);
label("$C$", pC, NW);
label("$D$", pD, W);
label("$E$", pE, SW);
label("$F$", pF, S);
label("$105^\circ$", pF, N * 2);
label("$110^\circ$", pB, SW * 1.5);
label("$\alpha$", pD, E);
[/asy] First of all, we see that $\angle ABC = 110^\circ$ must be half of the major arc ${AEC},$ thus arc ${AEC} = 2 \cdot \angle ABC.$ Then, the minor arc ${AC}$ must be $360^\circ - 2 \cdot \angle ABC = 360^\circ - 2 \cdot 110^\circ = 140^\circ.$

Likewise, the minor arc ${EA}$ must be $360^\circ - 2 \cdot \angle EFA = 360^\circ - 2 \cdot 105^\circ = 150^\circ,$ and the minor arc ${CE}$ is $360^\circ - 2 \alpha.$ Now, arc ${AC},$ ${CE},$ and ${EA}$ must add up to $360^\circ,$ which means that \begin{align*}
360^\circ &= (360^\circ - 2 \alpha) + 140^\circ + 150^\circ\\
360^\circ &= 650^\circ - 2\alpha\\
2\alpha &= 290^\circ\\
\alpha &= \boxed{145^\circ}.
\end{align*}

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where a hexagon is inscribed in a circle. That means all six of its vertices lie on the circumference of the circle. The diagram shows a hexagon with points labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and there are some angles labeled: 105 degrees at point F, 110 degrees at point B, and an angle labeled α at point D. I need to find the measure of α.

First, since it's a cyclic hexagon (all vertices on a circle), I remember that the opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum up to 180 degrees. But wait, this is a hexagon, not a quadrilateral. Maybe there's a similar property for hexagons? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think.

Another property I remember is that the sum of all interior angles in a hexagon is (n-2)*180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. So, for a hexagon, that would be (6-2)*180 = 1200 degrees. Wait, no, that's 1200 divided by 6? No, wait, no. Wait, no, the sum is 1200?

Wait, no, hold on. The formula is (n-2)*180, so for n=6, it's (6-2)*180 = 4*180 = 720 degrees. So the sum of all interior angles in a hexagon is 720 degrees. So if I know some of the angles, maybe I can find the others.

But wait, since it's inscribed in a circle, each angle is related to the arcs of the circle. In a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides of the angle.

Wait, let me recall. For a triangle inscribed in a circle, each angle is half the measure of its opposite arc. For quadrilaterals, opposite angles sum to half the circle, which is 180 degrees. So for a hexagon, each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides meeting at that vertex.

Wait, maybe I should think about the arcs corresponding to each side. Each side of the hexagon subtends an arc on the circle. The measure of each angle is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming that angle.

So, if I denote the arcs between each pair of consecutive points as a, b, c, d, e, f, going around the circle, then each interior angle is half the sum of the two arcs adjacent to it.

Wait, let me try to visualize this. Let's say between points A and B is arc a, between B and C is arc b, C and D is arc c, D and E is arc d, E and F is arc e, and F and A is arc f. So, each interior angle at a vertex is equal to half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the two sides meeting at that vertex.

So, for example, the angle at point A is half the sum of arcs f and a. Similarly, the angle at point B is half the sum of arcs a and b, and so on.

Given that, if I can figure out the measures of these arcs, I can find the measure of α at point D.

But wait, I don't know the measures of the arcs. Maybe I can set up variables for them. Let's denote the arcs as follows:

Arc AB = a

Arc BC = b

Arc CD = c

Arc DE = d

Arc EF = e

Arc FA = f

Since the hexagon is inscribed in a circle, the sum of all arcs should be 360 degrees. So, a + b + c + d + e + f = 360 degrees.

Now, each interior angle is half the sum of the two arcs adjacent to it. So:

Angle at A: (f + a)/2

Angle at B: (a + b)/2

Angle at C: (b + c)/2

Angle at D: (c + d)/2 = α

Angle at E: (d + e)/2

Angle at F: (e + f)/2 = 105 degrees

Given that, we have some known angles: angle at B is 110 degrees, angle at F is 105 degrees, and angle at D is α, which we need to find.

So, let's write down the equations:

1. Angle B = (a + b)/2 = 110 degrees

Therefore, a + b = 220 degrees

2. Angle F = (e + f)/2 = 105 degrees

Therefore, e + f = 210 degrees

We also know that the sum of all arcs is 360 degrees:

a + b + c + d + e + f = 360

We can substitute the known sums:

220 + c + d + 210 = 360

So c + d = 360 - 220 - 210 = 360 - 430 = -70 degrees

Wait, that can't be right. Negative degrees? That doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let's double-check. If angle B is (a + b)/2 = 110, so a + b = 220. Angle F is (e + f)/2 = 105, so e + f = 210. Then total sum is a + b + c + d + e + f = 220 + c + d + 210 = 430 + c + d = 360

Therefore, c + d = 360 - 430 = -70

Negative arcs? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I messed up the angle assignments.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let's think again.

In a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming that angle.

But wait, in a polygon, each angle intercepts two arcs: the arc opposite to it and the arc adjacent? No, wait.

Wait, perhaps I need to revisit this. In a cyclic quadrilateral, each angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc. But in a polygon with more sides, each angle intercepts two arcs.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the central angles.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the two opposite arcs.

Wait, for example, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle is equal to half the sum of the opposite arcs. But in a hexagon, maybe each angle is equal to half the sum of the arcs opposite to it.

Wait, let me look up if that's the case.

Wait, I can't look things up, I need to figure it out.

Wait, maybe I should try to use the fact that in a cyclic polygon, the sum of every other angle is equal to the sum of the opposite arcs.

Wait, actually, let me think about a triangle inscribed in a circle. Each angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc.

But in a quadrilateral, each angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it.

So, perhaps in a hexagon, each angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it.

But wait, in a hexagon, each angle would intercept two arcs? Or maybe each interior angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to it.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the angle at a vertex is equal to half the measure of the arc that's not adjacent to it.

Wait, hmm.

Wait, let's think about an inscribed polygon. In a cyclic polygon, the measure of an interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming that angle.

Wait, so for a triangle, each angle intercepts one arc, but for a quadrilateral, each angle intercepts two arcs? No, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps each interior angle in a cyclic polygon is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it.

In a triangle, each angle is half the measure of the opposite arc.

In a quadrilateral, each angle is half the measure of the opposite arc as well, but since it's a quadrilateral, the opposite arc is actually the arc that is opposite to the angle, meaning it's the arc that doesn't contain the sides of the angle.

Wait, in a quadrilateral, the angle is equal to half the measure of its opposite arc.

Similarly, in a hexagon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it.

Wait, so if that's the case, then for a hexagon, each interior angle intercepts an opposite arc, which is the arc that's not adjacent to it.

Wait, so if that's the case, maybe the measure of each angle is half the measure of the opposite arc.

So, in a hexagon, each angle would intercept a unique arc opposite to it.

But then, since the hexagon is regular, each opposite arc would be equal. But in this case, the hexagon is not regular, so the opposite arcs can be different.

Wait, but then in that case, perhaps each interior angle is equal to half the measure of its opposite arc.

So, for example, angle at A is half the measure of the opposite arc, which is the arc from D to A, right?

Wait, in a hexagon, each angle is opposite to another angle, so for a hexagon, the opposite arc would be the arc between the two angles opposite to it.

Wait, maybe let me label the arcs properly.

If I denote the arcs between each pair of consecutive points as I did before: a, b, c, d, e, f.

Then, the opposite arc to angle A would be the arc that is not adjacent to A. So, the arc opposite to A would be the arc from D to A, which is the sum of arcs d, e, and f? Wait, no.

Wait, actually, in a hexagon, each angle is opposite to another angle, so the arc opposite to angle A would be the arc that is not adjacent to A, which would be the arc from D to A, but that spans multiple arcs.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each angle is opposite to another angle, so the measure of angle A is half the measure of the arc opposite to it, which is the arc from D to A, which is equal to the sum of arcs D-E-F-A, which is d + e + f.

But wait, that seems like a lot.

Wait, maybe in a cyclic polygon with an even number of sides, each angle is opposite to another angle, and the opposite arc is the one that is not adjacent.

Wait, for a hexagon, each angle has an opposite angle, and the opposite arc is the arc between those two opposite points.

Wait, for example, angle at A is opposite to angle at D, so the opposite arc would be from D to A, which is the sum of arcs D-E-F-A, which is arcs d + e + f.

But that seems complicated because the opposite arc is actually spanning three arcs.

Wait, but if that's the case, then angle A is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it, which is d + e + f.

Similarly, angle D is opposite to angle A, so angle D is also equal to half the measure of the same arc, which is d + e + f.

But wait, that would mean angle A and angle D are equal, but in the problem, angle D is labeled as α, and angle A is not given, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I got this wrong.

Wait, maybe in a cyclic polygon, each angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it, but if the polygon has an even number of sides, each angle is opposite to another angle, so the opposite arc is the one that's directly across.

But in a hexagon, each angle is opposite to another angle, but the arc opposite to angle A is actually the arc from D to A, which is three arcs: D-E-F-A.

Wait, that seems too long.

Wait, perhaps instead, each angle is equal to half the measure of the arc that is intercepted by the two sides meeting at that angle.

Wait, in a triangle, each angle intercepts one arc.

In a quadrilateral, each angle intercepts the opposite arc, which is the arc not adjacent to it.

Similarly, in a hexagon, each angle intercepts an arc that is opposite to it, which is the arc that doesn't contain the sides forming the angle.

Wait, so for angle A, the sides forming it are AF and AB, so the arc opposite to angle A would be the arc from B to F, right?

Wait, that is, the arc that is not adjacent to angle A.

Wait, so maybe the arc opposite to angle A is the arc from B to F, which is arc b + arc c + arc d + arc e?

Wait, no, that seems too much.

Wait, maybe it's just the arc between the two vertices that are not adjacent to A.

Wait, let me think differently.

In a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle at A intercepts the arc from B to D, which is opposite to angle A.

Similarly, in a cyclic pentagon, the angle at A intercepts the arc from C to E, which is opposite.

So, in a cyclic hexagon, maybe the angle at A intercepts the arc from C to F.

Wait, but in the hexagon, the sides at A are AB and AF, so the arc opposite to angle A would be from B to F, but that's a long arc.

Wait, maybe it's the arc that is intercepted by the two sides.

Wait, actually, in a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc that is intercepted by the two sides forming that angle.

So, for angle A, the two sides are AB and AF, so the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to angle A, which is the arc from B to F, not passing through A.

Wait, so in that case, angle A is equal to half the measure of arc BF.

Similarly, angle B is equal to half the measure of arc AC.

Wait, but in a hexagon, the arc BF is made up of arcs BC and CD and DE and EF?

Wait, if that's the case, then the intercepted arc for angle A is arc BF, which is arc b + c + d + e.

But that would make angle A = 1/2*(b + c + d + e). Similarly, angle B is equal to half the measure of the arc intercepted by sides BA and BC, which is arc AF + arc F something? Wait, no.

Wait, maybe angle B is equal to half the measure of the arc that's opposite to it, which is arc DF.

Wait, let me think.

Wait, in a triangle inscribed in a circle, the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

In a quadrilateral, the angle is half the measure of the opposite arc.

So, perhaps in a hexagon, each angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to it.

Therefore, angle A is half the measure of the arc from D to A, which is arc d + e + f.

Similarly, angle D is half the measure of the arc from A to D, which is the same arc d + e + f.

Wait, so that would mean angle A and angle D are equal? But in the problem, angle F is 105 degrees, angle B is 110 degrees, and angle D is α. So, unless angle A is also α, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe in a hexagon, each angle is equal to half the measure of its own opposite arc, but the opposite arc is not necessarily the same for all.

Wait, maybe the opposite arcs are different.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach.

Let me think about the arcs.

Since the hexagon is inscribed in a circle, each side corresponds to an arc.

Let me denote the arcs between each pair of consecutive points as follows:

Arc AB = a

Arc BC = b

Arc CD = c

Arc DE = d

Arc EF = e

Arc FA = f

So, arcs a, b, c, d, e, f.

As before, a + b + c + d + e + f = 360 degrees.

Now, each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the two arcs adjacent to that angle.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming that angle.

Wait, so for angle at A, the sides are AB and AF, so the intercepted arcs are the arcs opposite to angle A.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the intercepted arcs as the arcs that are not adjacent.

Wait, in a triangle, the angle intercepts the arc opposite to it.

In a quadrilateral, each angle intercepts the opposite arc.

In a hexagon, maybe each angle intercepts the opposite arc, which is the arc that is not adjacent.

So, for angle at A, the sides are AB and AF, so the opposite arc is the arc from B to F, which is arc b + c + d + e.

Wait, but if the hexagon is labeled in order, so points A, B, C, D, E, F, so arc from B to F is b + c + d + e.

Similarly, angle at B is intercepting arc from C to A, which is arc c + d + e + f.

Wait, no, angle at B is between AB and BC, so the intercepted arc is the arc opposite to angle B, which is arc D to F.

Wait, that is, arc d + e + f.

Wait, so angle B is half of (d + e + f). But we know angle B is 110 degrees, so:

110 = (d + e + f)/2

Therefore, d + e + f = 220 degrees.

Similarly, angle at F is (e + f)/2 = 105, so e + f = 210.

So, from angle F: e + f = 210.

From angle B: d + e + f = 220.

Subtracting e + f from both sides: d = 220 - 210 = 10 degrees.

So, d = 10 degrees.

So, arc DE is 10 degrees.

Now, we can use this information to find other arcs.

We have:

a + b + c + d + e + f = 360

We know d = 10, e + f = 210.

So, a + b + c + 10 + 210 = 360

Therefore, a + b + c = 360 - 220 = 140 degrees.

So, a + b + c = 140.

Also, angle at F is 105, which is (e + f)/2 = 105, which we already used.

Now, let's look at angle D, which is α.

Angle D is at point D, between sides CD and DE.

So, the sides forming angle D are CD and DE.

Therefore, the intercepted arc for angle D is the arc opposite to angle D, which is the arc from A to B.

Wait, arc AB is a, so is that correct?

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, each angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it.

So, angle D is opposite to arc AB, which is a.

Wait, so angle D = α = (arc AB)/2 = a/2

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, in a quadrilateral, the angle is equal to half the measure of the opposite arc. So, in a hexagon, would the angle be equal to half the measure of the opposite arc?

Wait, if that's the case, then angle D is equal to half of arc AB, which is a.

Similarly, angle A is equal to half of arc DE, which is d.

Wait, in the triangle, angle is half of the opposite arc.

In quadrilateral, angle is half of the opposite arc.

So, in hexagon, perhaps each angle is half of its opposite arc.

So, angle D is half of arc AB, which is a.

Similarly, angle A is half of arc DE, which is d.

Therefore, angle D = a / 2.

Similarly, angle A = d / 2.

But we don't know angle A, but we can maybe find a.

We have a + b + c = 140.

And angle D = a / 2, so a = 2α.

So, if we can find a, then we can find α.

So, let's write that:

a = 2α

So, angle D = a / 2 = α

Therefore, a = 2α.

So, plugging into a + b + c = 140:

2α + b + c = 140.

But we don't know b and c.

Wait, maybe we can use another angle.

Looking back at the diagram, the only other given angle is angle F, which is 105 degrees.

Angle F is at point F, between sides EF and FA.

So, the sides forming angle F are EF and FA.

Therefore, the intercepted arc for angle F is the arc opposite to angle F, which is arc BC, which is b.

Wait, so angle F = b / 2.

We know angle F is 105 degrees, so:

105 = b / 2

Therefore, b = 210 degrees.

Wait, hold on, that seems too large, because the total circumference is 360 degrees.

If b is 210, then a + 210 + c = 140, which would make a + c = -70, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, maybe I got the intercepted arc for angle F wrong.

Wait, angle F is at point F, between sides EF and FA.

Therefore, the intercepted arc is the arc opposite to angle F, which is the arc from B to C, which is b.

Wait, but angle F is 105 degrees, which is equal to half of arc BC.

Therefore, 105 = (arc BC)/2 => arc BC = 210 degrees.

But that is a problem because the total circumference is 360, and we have arc BC = 210, which is already more than half the circle.

Wait, that seems impossible because the sum of arcs would be over 360.

Wait, maybe I messed up the intercepted arc.

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, each angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc, which is the arc opposite to the angle.

But in a hexagon, the angle is formed by two sides, and the intercepted arc is the one that's opposite, not adjacent.

Wait, in a triangle, the angle is opposite to the arc that is not adjacent.

In a quadrilateral, the angle is opposite to the arc that is not adjacent.

So, in a hexagon, perhaps each angle is opposite to an arc that's not adjacent, and that arc is made up of three arcs: the ones that are not adjacent to the angle.

Wait, so for angle F, which is at point F, between sides EF and FA, the intercepted arc would be the arc from A to E, not passing through F.

Wait, but point F is part of the hexagon, so arc from A to E would be arc AF + arc FE, but that is the same as arc f + arc e.

Wait, but we already have arcs e and f as part of the hexagon.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the intercepted arc for angle F is the arc opposite to it, which is arc BC, which is b, as before.

But if arc BC is 210 degrees, that's a problem because the total circumference is 360, and other arcs are a + b + c + d + e + f.

Wait, if b = 210, then:

From above, a + b + c = 140

So, a + 210 + c = 140 => a + c = -70, which is impossible.

Therefore, my assumption must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps angle F is not equal to half of arc BC.

Wait, maybe I got the intercepted arc wrong.

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc that is intercepted by the two sides forming the angle, but on the opposite side of the circle.

Wait, so for angle F, the sides are EF and FA, so the intercepted arc is the one that's opposite to angle F, which is arc BC.

But arc BC is b, so angle F = b / 2.

But that leads us to an impossible result because b would be 210, which is more than half the circle.

Wait, maybe the intercepted arc is a different one.

Wait, perhaps for angle F, the intercepted arc is the one that's opposite, which is arc AD.

Wait, arc AD is made up of arcs a + b + c + d.

Wait, but in that case, angle F = 1/2*(a + b + c + d).

But arc AD is a + b + c + d, and we have angle F = 1/2*(a + b + c + d).

Given that angle F is 105 degrees, so:

105 = (a + b + c + d)/2

Therefore, a + b + c + d = 210 degrees.

But earlier, we had a + b + c = 140 degrees.

Therefore, 140 + d = 210 => d = 70 degrees.

But earlier, we had d = 10 degrees.

Wait, that's contradictory because we had d = 10 from angle B.

Wait, so that's a problem.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption that angle F is half of arc BC is wrong.

Wait, perhaps in a cyclic hexagon, the measure of each angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the sides.

Wait, meaning, angle F is equal to half the sum of the arcs intercepted by sides EF and FA.

Wait, sides EF and FA intercept arcs.

Wait, side EF intercepts arc from F to E, which is arc e, and side FA intercepts arc from F to A, which is arc f.

But angle F is formed by sides EF and FA, so the intercepted arcs would be the arcs opposite to those sides.

Wait, perhaps the intercepted arcs are the ones opposite to the sides.

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, the angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to the angle.

Wait, but we tried that before, and got into a contradiction.

Wait, maybe the measure of each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the sum of the two arcs that are opposite to the sides forming the angle.

Wait, sides EF and FA intercept arcs.

Wait, side EF is between points E and F, so the arc opposite to side EF is arc AB.

Similarly, side FA is between F and A, so the arc opposite to side FA is arc BC.

Therefore, angle F is equal to half the sum of arcs AB and BC.

So, angle F = 1/2*(a + b).

Given that angle F is 105 degrees, so:

105 = (a + b)/2

Multiply both sides by 2: a + b = 210 degrees.

Earlier, we had from angle B: d + e + f = 220 degrees

And from angle F: e + f = 210 degrees

Subtracting, we get d = 10 degrees.

Then, a + b + c = 140 degrees.

From angle F: a + b = 210 degrees

Wait, hold on, a + b is 210, but a + b + c = 140. That would mean 210 + c = 140 => c = -70, which is impossible.

Wait, so that's another contradiction.

Wait, maybe my understanding is wrong.

Wait, maybe angle F is not equal to (a + b)/2, but instead, the angle at F is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it, which is the arc from D to A.

Wait, so arc DA is d + e + f.

Therefore, angle F is equal to half of arc DA.

So, angle F = (d + e + f)/2

Given angle F is 105 degrees, so:

105 = (d + e + f)/2

Multiply both sides by 2: d + e + f = 210

Earlier, from angle B, which is at point B: angle B = (arc CD + arc DE)/2

Wait, no, angle B is formed by sides AB and BC, so the intercepted arc is the arc opposite to angle B, which is arc DE + arc EF.

Wait, so angle B = (arc DE + arc EF)/2 = (d + e)/2

Wait, but in the problem, angle B is 110 degrees.

So:

110 = (d + e)/2

Multiply both sides by 2: d + e = 220

Earlier, from angle F: d + e + f = 210

Subtracting angle F from angle B:

(d + e) - (d + e + f) = 220 - 210 => -f = 10 => f = -10

Wait, f is negative? That can't be.

Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, so perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps in a cyclic hexagon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the sum of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming the angle.

So, for angle at B, formed by sides AB and BC, the intercepted arcs are the arcs opposite to AB and BC.

Wait, arc AB is a, arc BC is b, so the intercepted arcs are the arcs opposite to those, which would be arcs that are opposite to AB and BC.

In a cyclic polygon, the angle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let's look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that the sum of all interior angles is 720 degrees, and we can write equations for the angles in terms of the arcs.

So, each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the two arcs adjacent to it.

Wait, for a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the sum of the two arcs adjacent to it.

Wait, that sounds more accurate.

So, angle at A is equal to half the sum of arcs FA and AB.

Similarly, angle at B is half the sum of arcs AB and BC.

Angle at C is half the sum of arcs BC and CD.

Angle at D is half the sum of arcs CD and DE.

Angle at E is half the sum of arcs DE and EF.

Angle at F is half the sum of arcs EF and FA.

Wait, is this correct?

Wait, in a triangle, the angle is equal to half the measure of the opposite arc, which would be the sum of the two non-adjacent arcs.

Wait, perhaps in a hexagon, each angle is equal to half the sum of the two arcs adjacent to it.

Wait, that might make sense.

So, for angle at A, which is between arcs FA and AB, the measure of angle A is half the sum of arcs FA and AB.

Similarly, angle B is half the sum of arcs AB and BC.

So, if that's the case, then:

Angle A = (f + a)/2

Angle B = (a + b)/2

Angle C = (b + c)/2

Angle D = (c + d)/2

Angle E = (d + e)/2

Angle F = (e + f)/2

Wait, that seems to make more sense.

So, given that, we can write:

Angle A = (f + a)/2

Angle B = (a + b)/2 = 110 degrees

Angle C = (b + c)/2

Angle D = (c + d)/2 = α

Angle E = (d + e)/2

Angle F = (e + f)/2 = 105 degrees

Also, we know that the sum of all angles is 720 degrees.

So, let's write equations.

First, from angle B:

(a + b)/2 = 110 => a + b = 220 degrees.

From angle F:

(e + f)/2 = 105 => e + f = 210 degrees.

We need more equations.

Also, from angle D:

(c + d)/2 = α => c + d = 2α.

From angle E:

(d + e)/2 = something, but we don't know angle E.

From angle C:

(b + c)/2 = something, which we don't know.

So, let's see what else we can do.

We know that the sum of all arcs is 360 degrees:

a + b + c + d + e + f = 360.

We also have:

a + b = 220

e + f = 210

So, adding these: 220 + c + d + 210 = 360 => c + d = 360 - 220 - 210 = -70.

Wait, c + d = -70? That can't be.

Wait, that can't be, because arc measures can't be negative.

So, that must mean that our assumption is wrong.

Wait, if angle A = (f + a)/2, angle B = (a + b)/2, etc., then the sum of angles:

Angle A + Angle B + Angle C + Angle D + Angle E + Angle F

= (f + a)/2 + (a + b)/2 + (b + c)/2 + (c + d)/2 + (d + e)/2 + (e + f)/2

= [ (f + a) + (a + b) + (b + c) + (c + d) + (d + e) + (e + f) ] / 2

Simplify numerator:

f + a + a + b + b + c + c + d + d + e + e + f

= 2a + 2b + 2c + 2d + 2e + 2f

= 2(a + b + c + d + e + f) = 2*360 = 720

Therefore, the sum of the angles is 720 / 2 = 360 degrees.

Wait, but the sum of interior angles in a hexagon is 720 degrees, not 360.

Wait, that is a problem.

So, the formula that each angle is equal to half the sum of the two adjacent arcs is incorrect.

Wait, that must mean my earlier approach is wrong.

Wait, so perhaps I should not be using that formula.

Wait, so maybe I need to go back.

Wait, perhaps the measure of each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it.

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it.

So, in a triangle, yes, angle is half the opposite arc.

In a quadrilateral, each angle is half the opposite arc.

In a hexagon, perhaps each interior angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to it.

So, in that case, angle A is half of arc D to A, which is arc D-E-F-A.

Similarly, angle D is half of arc A-B-C-D.

Wait, but in that case, angle A and angle D are both half of the same arc.

Wait, if that's the case, then angle A and angle D would be equal.

But in the problem, angle D is labeled as α, and angle F is 105.

But unless angle A is also α.

Wait, let me think.

Arc opposite to angle A is arc D-E-F-A.

Which is arcs d + e + f.

Similarly, arc opposite to angle D is arc A-B-C-D, which is a + b + c.

So, angle A = (d + e + f)/2

Angle D = (a + b + c)/2

Similarly, angle F is opposite to arc B-C-D-E-F-A, but wait, no, angle F is at point F, so its opposite arc is arc A-B-C.

Wait, that is, the arc opposite to angle F is arc A-B-C, which is a + b + c.

Wait, so angle F is (a + b + c)/2.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, if that's the case, then:

Angle A = (d + e + f)/2

Angle D = (a + b + c)/2

Angle F = (a + b + c)/2

So, angle D and angle F are equal?

Wait, in the problem, angle F is 105 degrees, so angle D would also be 105 degrees.

But the problem states that angle D is α, which is different from angle F.

Wait, that can't be, unless α is 105. But in the problem, angle D is labeled as α, and angle F is 105. So, unless α is 105, but that may not be the case.

Wait, perhaps there is an error in the problem statement.

Alternatively, maybe the opposite arcs are different.

Wait, maybe angle F is opposite to a different arc.

Wait, perhaps angle F is opposite to arc C-D-E.

Wait, but in that case, angle F would be (c + d + e)/2.

Given angle F is 105, so (c + d + e)/2 = 105 => c + d + e = 210.

Similarly, angle D is (a + b + c)/2 = α.

So, if angle F is (c + d + e)/2 = 105, and angle D is (a + b + c)/2 = α.

Then, we can write:

From angle F: c + d + e = 210

From angle D: a + b + c = 2α.

We also know from angle B: angle B = (a + b)/2 = 110 => a + b = 220.

From angle F: c + d + e = 210.

And from the total arcs:

a + b + c + d + e + f = 360

We can plug in a + b = 220, and c + d + e = 210.

So, 220 + 210 + f = 360 => f = 360 - 430 = -70.

Again, negative.

Hmm.

Wait, seems like we're getting negative arcs again, which is impossible.

Therefore, my assumption must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps angle F is not opposite to arc C-D-E.

Wait, let me try a different approach.

Maybe each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the sides.

So, in a triangle, it's half the opposite arc.

In a quadrilateral, it's half the sum of the opposite arcs.

Wait, in a quadrilateral, each angle is equal to half the sum of the opposite arcs.

Wait, so in a quadrilateral, angle A = (arc C + arc D)/2.

Similarly, angle B = (arc D + arc E)/2.

Wait, but in a hexagon, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe each angle is equal to half the sum of the two arcs opposite to the sides forming the angle.

Wait, for angle A, formed by sides FA and AB, the opposite arcs would be arc C and arc D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's getting too convoluted.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

Therefore, in the hexagon, each interior angle intercepts an arc that is not adjacent to it.

So, for angle A, which is at point A, it intercepts the arc from D to A, which is arc D-E-F-A, which is d + e + f.

Similarly, angle D is at point D, intercepting the arc from A to D, which is a + b + c.

Therefore, angle A = (d + e + f)/2, angle D = (a + b + c)/2.

Similarly, angle F is at point F, intercepting the arc from B to F, which is arc B + arc C + arc D + arc E, but that's too much.

Wait, no, the intercepted arc is the one opposite to angle F, which is the arc from A to F, which is a + b + c.

Wait, so angle F is (a + b + c)/2.

Wait, so angle F is equal to angle D.

Given that, angle F is 105 degrees, so angle D is also 105 degrees.

But in the problem, angle D is labeled as α, so is α 105 degrees?

But the problem says "What is the measure of α?" as if it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the intercepted arc.

Wait, if angle F is 105 degrees, then (a + b + c)/2 = 105, so a + b + c = 210.

Similarly, angle D is (a + b + c)/2, which is 105, so α = 105.

But that's the same as angle F. So, unless the problem is designed such that α is equal to angle F, which is 105, then α is 105.

But in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as α, different from angle F.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the intercepted arc.

Wait, if angle F is at point F, then the intercepted arc is not a + b + c, but perhaps another arc.

Wait, perhaps the intercepted arc is the one that's opposite to the two sides forming angle F, which are EF and FA.

So, side EF is between E and F, so the intercepted arc is arc D-C-B-A-F-E, but that's the whole circle.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the sides EF and FA.

So, for side EF, the intercepted arc is the one opposite to it, which is from E to F, but that is a single arc.

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

So, for side EF, the intercepted arc is from E to F, which is arc E-F, which is f.

Similarly, for side FA, the intercepted arc is from F to A, which is arc F-A, which is f.

So, angle F, being at point F, is formed by sides EF and FA, so the intercepted arcs are arc E-F and arc F-A, both of which are f.

Therefore, angle F is half the measure of arc E-F plus arc F-A.

Wait, but that's equal to f + f = 2f.

Wait, so angle F = (f + f)/2 = f

So, angle F = f.

Given that, angle F is 105 degrees, so f = 105 degrees.

So, arc FA is 105 degrees.

Similarly, angle B is 110 degrees.

Angle B is at point B, formed by sides AB and BC.

Therefore, the intercepted arcs are arc A-F and arc C-D-E-F-A.

Wait, no, intercepted arcs are the arcs opposite to the sides forming the angle.

So, side AB intercepts the arc from F to E to D to C to B.

Wait, that's a lot.

Wait, perhaps it's better to refer back to the formula.

In a cyclic polygon, the measure of an interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the sides forming the angle.

So, for angle B, formed by sides AB and BC, the intercepted arcs are the arcs opposite to those sides.

Side AB is between A and B, so the intercepted arc is from F to E to D to C to B, which is a long arc.

Wait, that seems too much.

Alternatively, the intercepted arc is the one that is not adjacent.

Wait, side AB intercepts arc F-E-D-C.

Wait, but that's three arcs.

Wait, perhaps in a hexagon, each side intercepts three arcs.

Wait, in a triangle, each side intercepts the opposite arc.

In a quadrilateral, each side intercepts the opposite two arcs.

Wait, so in a hexagon, each side intercepts three arcs.

Therefore, for side AB, which is between A and B, the intercepted arc is the arc from F to E to D to C to B.

Wait, which is five arcs.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps in a cyclic polygon, each side intercepts the arc that is opposite to it, which is the arc that is not adjacent.

In a triangle, opposite arc is one.

In a quadrilateral, opposite arc is two arcs.

In a hexagon, opposite arc is three arcs.

Therefore, side AB intercepts the arc from D to E to F.

Wait, that is, the arc that is opposite to side AB.

Similarly, side BC intercepts the arc from E to F to A.

Wait, so for angle B, formed by sides AB and BC, the intercepted arcs are the arcs opposite to AB and BC.

So, side AB intercepts arc D-E-F.

Side BC intercepts arc E-F-A.

Therefore, the measure of angle B is half the sum of the measures of these two arcs.

So, angle B = 1/2*(arc D-E-F + arc E-F-A) = 1/2*(d + e + e + f + f + a).

Wait, that seems messy.

Wait, perhaps angle B is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it.

Wait, in a quadrilateral, angle B is equal to half the sum of the opposite arcs.

Wait, perhaps in a hexagon, angle B is equal to half the sum of the arcs opposite to AB and BC.

So, angle B = 1/2*(arc D-E-F + arc E-F-A)

Wait, arc D-E-F is d + e + f

Arc E-F-A is e + f + a

Therefore, angle B = (d + e + f + e + f + a)/2 = (a + 2e + 2f + d)/2.

But angle B is given as 110 degrees.

So, (a + 2e + 2f + d)/2 = 110

Multiply both sides by 2:

a + 2e + 2f + d = 220

Similarly, angle F is 105 degrees.

Angle F is at point F, formed by sides EF and FA.

So, the intercepted arcs are opposite to sides EF and FA.

Side EF intercepts arc D-E-F.

Wait, no, side EF is between E and F, so the intercepted arc is arc D.

Similarly, side FA is between F and A, so the intercepted arc is arc B.

Wait, so angle F is equal to half the sum of the intercepted arcs.

So, angle F = 1/2*(arc D + arc B).

Given angle F is 105, so:

105 = 1/2*(arc D + arc B)

Thus, arc D + arc B = 210 degrees.

Arc D is d, arc B is b.

Therefore, b + d = 210.

So, from angle B's equation:

a + 2e + 2f + d = 220

But from angle F: b + d = 210

And the total arcs: a + b + c + d + e + f = 360

So, we have three equations:

1. a + b + c + d + e + f = 360

2. a + 2e + 2f + d = 220

3. b + d = 210

Let me write these:

Equation 1: a + b + c + d + e + f = 360

Equation 2: a + d + 2e + 2f = 220

Equation 3: b + d = 210

We can try to solve these equations.

From Equation 3: b = 210 - d

Plug into Equation 1:

a + (210 - d) + c + d + e + f = 360

Simplify:

a + 210 - d + c + d + e + f = 360

The -d and +d cancel:

a + c + e + f + 210 = 360

So, a + c + e + f = 150

From Equation 2: a + d + 2e + 2f = 220

We can write this as: a + d + 2(e + f) = 220

But from Equation 1: a + c + e + f = 150

So, if we subtract these equations:

(a + d + 2(e + f)) - (a + c + e + f) = 220 - 150

Which gives:

d - c + (e + f) = 70

So, d - c + (e + f) = 70

But we don't know e + f.

Wait, from Equation 3: b = 210 - d

From the total arcs: a + b + c + d + e + f = 360

Plug b = 210 - d:

a + (210 - d) + c + d + e + f = 360

Which simplifies to a + c + e + f + 210 = 360 => a + c + e + f = 150

So, as before.

So, we have:

From Equation 2: a + d + 2(e + f) = 220

From Equation 1: a + c + e + f = 150

Let me denote S = e + f

Then, Equation 1: a + c + S = 150

Equation 2: a + d + 2S = 220

From Equation 3: b = 210 - d

We have another equation from angle D, which is at point D.

Angle D is labeled as α, so:

Angle D is formed by sides CD and DE.

The intercepted arcs are opposite to sides CD and DE.

Side CD is between C and D, so the intercepted arc is arc B-A-F-E-D-C.

Wait, that's a long arc.

Alternatively, intercepted arc is arc A-F, which is f.

Wait, but that can't be.

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, each side intercepts the arc opposite to it.

Side CD is between C and D, so the intercepted arc is the arc opposite to CD, which is arc A-B-F-E.

Wait, that's arcs A, B, F, E.

So, arc A-B is a, arc F-E is f, so the intercepted arc is a + f.

Similarly, side DE is between D and E, so the intercepted arc is arc F-A, which is f.

Wait, no, side DE intercepts the arc opposite to it, which is arc C-B.

Wait, arc C-B is c + b.

Wait, getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps angle D is equal to half the sum of the intercepted arcs opposite to sides CD and DE.

So, side CD intercepts the arc opposite to it, which is arc A-F-E.

Wait, arc A-F-E is a + f.

Side DE intercepts the arc opposite to it, which is arc C-B.

Arc C-B is c + b.

Therefore, angle D is equal to half the sum of these intercepted arcs.

Therefore, angle D = (a + f + c + b)/2

Given angle D is α, so:

α = (a + c + b + f)/2

But from Equation 1: a + c + e + f = 150

From Equation 3: b + d = 210 => d = 210 - b

Also, we have:

Equation 2: a + d + 2S = 220, where S = e + f

So, plug d = 210 - b:

a + (210 - b) + 2S = 220

Thus, a - b + 2S = 10

From Equation 1: a + c + S = 150

We have two equations:

1. a + c + S = 150

2. a - b + 2S = 10

We can try to solve for a and c.

From Equation 1: c = 150 - a - S

From Equation 2: a - b + 2S = 10 => a = b + 10 - 2S

So, plug into Equation 1:

c = 150 - (b + 10 - 2S) - S = 150 - b -10 + 2S - S = 140 - b + S

Now, we can write c in terms of b and S.

From Equation 3: d = 210 - b

From S = e + f, but we don't know e and f individually.

Wait, but we can try to find another equation.

Wait, let me recall that angle D is α = (a + c + b + f)/2

From above, angle D is α = (a + c + b + f)/2

But from Equation 1: a + c + S = 150, where S = e + f

Therefore, a + c + e + f = 150

So, a + c + b + f = (a + c + e + f) + b - e = 150 + b - e

But since S = e + f, then e = S - f

So, a + c + b + f = 150 + b - (S - f) = 150 + b - S + f

But S = e + f, so we can write:

a + c + b + f = 150 + b - (e + f) + f = 150 + b - e

But this seems to complicate.

Alternatively, let's see:

We have:

α = (a + c + b + f)/2

But from Equation 1:

a + c + e + f = 150

So, a + c + b + f = 150 + b - e

Therefore, α = (150 + b - e)/2

But we don't know e.

Alternatively, from Equation 2:

a + d + 2S = 220

And from Equation 3:

d = 210 - b

So, plug into Equation 2:

a + (210 - b) + 2S = 220

Thus, a - b + 2S = 10

From Equation 1: a + c + S = 150

We have:

From Equation 1: a = 150 - c - S

Plug into a - b + 2S = 10:

(150 - c - S) - b + 2S = 10

Simplify:

150 - c - S - b + 2S = 10

150 - c - b + S = 10

So, S = c + b - 140

But from Equation 1: a + c + S = 150

Substitute S:

a + c + (c + b - 140) = 150

Simplify:

a + 2c + b - 140 = 150

Thus:

a + 2c + b = 290

From Equation 3: d = 210 - b

From Equation 2: a + d + 2S = 220

We have:

a + (210 - b) + 2S = 220

Thus, a - b + 2S = 10

From above, S = c + b - 140

So, plug into a - b + 2(c + b - 140) = 10

Simplify:

a - b + 2c + 2b - 280 = 10

a + c + b - 280 = 10

Thus:

a + c + b = 290

Which is consistent with the above equation.

So, now, from a + 2c + b = 290 and a + c + b = 290.

Subtract:

(a + 2c + b) - (a + c + b) = 290 - 290

Which gives c = 0.

Wait, c = 0? That can't be, because c is an arc measure, it can't be zero.

So, that's a problem.

Therefore, something is wrong in our equations.

Wait, I think the mistake is in the assumption about angle D.

Maybe angle D is not equal to (a + c + b + f)/2.

Perhaps, I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in a cyclic hexagon, each angle is equal to half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the sides forming the angle.

So, angle D is formed by sides CD and DE, which intercept arcs C-B and E-F.

Wait, arc C-B is c + b, arc E-F is e + f.

Therefore, angle D is equal to half the sum of these arcs.

So, angle D = (c + b + e + f)/2.

Which is equal to α.

Similarly, angle B is formed by sides AB and BC, intercepting arcs F-E and E-D.

Arc F-E is f + e, arc E-D is e + d.

Therefore, angle B is equal to half the sum of these arcs.

So, angle B = (f + e + e + d)/2 = (d + 2e + f)/2 = 110 degrees.

Which is given.

So, angle B = (d + 2e + f)/2 = 110

Multiply both sides by 2:

d + 2e + f = 220.

Similarly, angle D = (c + b + e + f)/2 = α.

So, angle D = α = (c + b + e + f)/2.

We also know angle F is 105 degrees, which is equal to the sum of arcs intercepted by sides EF and FA.

Side EF intercepts arc D-E, which is d + e.

Side FA intercepts arc B-A, which is a.

Therefore, angle F = (d + e + a)/2 = 105

Multiply both sides by 2:

d + e + a = 210

So, we have:

1. d + 2e + f = 220 (from angle B)

2. d + e + a = 210 (from angle F)

3. The total arcs: a + b + c + d + e + f = 360

We also have angle D = (c + b + e + f)/2 = α

We need to find α.

So, we have three equations:

Equation 1: d + 2e + f = 220

Equation 2: d + e + a = 210

Equation 3: a + b + c + d + e + f = 360

Let me see if we can express variables in terms of others.

From Equation 2: a = 210 - d - e

From Equation 1: d + 2e + f = 220 => f = 220 - d - 2e

From Equation 3: a + b + c + d + e + f = 360

Plug a and f from above:

(210 - d - e) + b + c + d + e + (220 - d - 2e) = 360

Simplify:

210 - d - e + b + c + d + e + 220 - d - 2e = 360

Combine like terms:

210 + 220 - d - d - 2e + b + c = 360

430 - 2d - 2e + b + c = 360

So,

-2d - 2e + b + c = -70

Divide both sides by -2:

d + e - (b + c)/2 = 35

Hmm.

But we also have angle D = (c + b + e + f)/2 = α

From Equation 1: f = 220 - d - 2e

So, angle D = (c + b + e + 220 - d - 2e)/2 = (c + b - e - d + 220)/2 = α

Simplify:

(c + b - d - e + 220)/2 = α

But from above, we have:

d + e - (b + c)/2 = 35

Multiply both sides by 2:

2d + 2e - b - c = 70

Rearranged:

- b - c + 2d + 2e = 70

From angle D:

(c + b - d - e + 220)/2 = α

Multiply numerator:

(c + b - d - e)/2 + 110 = α

But from above, - b - c + 2d + 2e = 70 => multiply both sides by -1:

b + c - 2d - 2e = -70

Divide by 2:

(b + c)/2 - d - e = -35

Thus,

(c + b)/2 = d + e - 35

So, plug into angle D:

(c + b - d - e + 220)/2 = (2*(d + e - 35) - d - e + 220)/2

Simplify numerator:

2d + 2e - 70 - d - e + 220 = (2d - d) + (2e - e) + (-70 + 220) = d + e + 150

Therefore, angle D = (d + e + 150)/2

But from the previous equation:

- b - c + 2d + 2e = 70

And from Equation 3 rearranged:

-2d - 2e + b + c = -70

Which is the same as above.

So, perhaps we can solve for d + e.

From angle D:

α = (d + e + 150)/2

We need to find α.

But we need another equation to relate d + e.

Wait, from angle D expression:

α = (d + e + 150)/2

From above, we have:

From - b - c + 2d + 2e = 70

And from Equation 3:

a + b + c + d + e + f = 360

Where a = 210 - d - e

f = 220 - d - 2e

So, plug in:

(210 - d - e) + b + c + d + e + (220 - d - 2e) = 360

Simplify:

210 - d - e + b + c + d + e + 220 - d - 2e = 360

Combine like terms:

210 + 220 - d - d - 2e + b + c = 360

430 - 2d - 2e + b + c = 360

Thus,

-2d - 2e + b + c = -70

Which is the same as above.

So, I think we need another equation.

Wait, perhaps we can use the expression for angle D and angle F.

But angle F is given.

Wait, angle F is 105 degrees, which is (d + e + a)/2 = 105

From Equation 2: a = 210 - d - e

Therefore,

(d + e + 210 - d - e)/2 = 105 => 210/2 = 105 => 105 = 105

Which is a tautology.

So, no new information.

So, we can't get another equation.

Therefore, we need to find another relation.

Wait, perhaps using angle D.

We have:

α = (d + e + 150)/2

We need to find α.

But we don't know d + e.

Wait, but from the equation:

From above,

- b - c + 2d + 2e = 70

Which can be written as:

2d + 2e = b + c + 70

Divide both sides by 2:

d + e = (b + c)/2 + 35

From angle D:

α = (d + e + 150)/2 = ( (b + c)/2 + 35 + 150 ) / 2 = ( (b + c)/2 + 185 ) / 2 = (b + c)/4 + 92.5

But we don't know b + c.

Wait, from Equation 3:

a + b + c + d + e + f = 360

But a = 210 - d - e

f = 220 - d - 2e

So,

(210 - d - e) + b + c + d + e + (220 - d - 2e) = 360

Simplify:

210 - d - e + b + c + d + e + 220 - d - 2e = 360

Combine like terms:

210 + 220 - d - d - 2e + b + c = 360

430 - 2d - 2e + b + c = 360

So,

-2d - 2e + b + c = -70

Which is the same as:

b + c = 2d + 2e -70

Now, plug this into the expression for α:

α = (d + e)/2 + (2d + 2e -70)/4 + 92.5

Wait, from above:

From angle D:

α = (d + e + 150)/2

From the equation:

b + c = 2d + 2e -70

So, plug into α:

From angle D: α = (d + e + 150)/2

But we can also express α in terms of b + c.

From above, we had:

α = (b + c)/4 + 92.5

Since,

α = (d + e + 150)/2 = ( (b + c)/2 + 35 + 150 ) / 2 = ( (b + c)/2 + 185 ) / 2 = (b + c)/4 + 92.5

So, if we can find b + c, we can find α.

But from above, b + c = 2d + 2e -70

So,

α = (2d + 2e -70)/4 + 92.5 = (d + e -35)/2 + 92.5

But from above, d + e = (b + c)/2 + 35

So, d + e = (2d + 2e -70)/2 + 35 = (d + e -35) + 35 = d + e

Which is consistent.

So, no progress.

Wait, maybe solve for α in terms of itself.

Wait, let me write:

From α = (d + e + 150)/2

From b + c = 2d + 2e -70

From angle D: α = (b + c)/4 + 92.5

So,

α = (2d + 2e -70)/4 + 92.5 = (d + e -35)/2 + 92.5

But from α = (d + e + 150)/2

So,

(d + e + 150)/2 = (d + e -35)/2 + 92.5

Multiply both sides by 2:

d + e + 150 = d + e -35 + 185

Simplify:

d + e + 150 = d + e + 150

Which is a tautology.

So, again, no new information.

Therefore, this approach is not working.

Wait, maybe we can assume that arcs are integer values and try to solve.

From f = 220 - d - 2e

From a = 210 - d - e

From b + c = 2d + 2e -70

We have:

Arcs:

a = 210 - d - e

b = ?

c = ?

d = d

e = e

f = 220 - d - 2e

But we have another relation from angle D:

α = (d + e + 150)/2

But we don't know d + e.

Wait, maybe we can express the sum of all arcs:

a + b + c + d + e + f = 360

We have:

a = 210 - d - e

f = 220 - d - 2e

b + c = 2d + 2e -70

So,

(210 - d - e) + (2d + 2e -70) + d + e = 360

Simplify:

210 - d - e + 2d + 2e -70 + d + e = 360

Combine like terms:

210 -70 = 140

(-d + 2d + d) = 2d

(-e + 2e + e) = 2e

So,

140 + 2d + 2e = 360

Thus,

2d + 2e = 220 => d + e = 110

Therefore, d + e = 110

So, now, we can plug this into α.

From angle D:

α = (d + e + 150)/2 = (110 + 150)/2 = 260/2 = 130

So, α = 130 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of angle D is 130 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The measure of angle \( \alpha \) is \(\boxed{130}\) degrees.

Given a hexagon inscribed in a circle, we need to find the measure of angle \( \alpha \) at point \( D \). The hexagon is labeled \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) in order, and the diagram shows specific angles at points \( B \) and \( F \).

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The hexagon is cyclic, meaning all its vertices lie on a circle.
   - The sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is \( 720 \) degrees.
   - The given angles are \( 110^\circ \) at point \( B \) and \( 105^\circ \) at point \( F \).

2. **Key Concepts:**
   - Each interior angle of a cyclic polygon is half the measure of the arc opposite to it.
   - The sum of the arcs in a circle is \( 360^\circ \).

3. **Setting Up Equations:**
   - Let the arcs between the points be \( a, b, c, d, e, f \).
   - The sum of the arcs is \( a + b + c + d + e + f = 360^\circ \).
   - Angle \( B \) is formed by sides \( AB \) and \( BC \), intercepting arcs \( f, e, d, c \). Thus, \( \frac{f + e + d + c}{2} = 110^\circ \).
   - Angle \( F \) is formed by sides \( EF \) and \( FA \), intercepting arcs \( a, b, c \). Thus, \( \frac{a + b + c}{2} = 105^\circ \).

4. **Solving the Equations:**
   - From angle \( B \): \( f + e + d + c = 220^\circ \).
   - From angle \( F \): \( a + b + c = 210^\circ \).
   - Using the total sum of arcs: \( a + b + c + d + e + f = 360^\circ \).

5. **Finding Arcs:**
   - From the equations, we find \( d + e = 110^\circ \).
   - The measure of angle \( \alpha \) (at point \( D \)) is half the sum of the arcs opposite to it, which are \( b + c + e + f \).

6. **Calculating \( \alpha \):**
   - Using the derived values, we find \( \alpha = \frac{d + e + 150}{2} \).
   - Substituting \( d + e = 110^\circ \), we get \( \alpha = \frac{110 + 150}{2} = 130^\circ \).

Thus, the measure of angle \( \alpha \) is \(\boxed{130}\) degrees.
