Question:
Find all the integer roots of
\[x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0.\]Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
By the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots are all the divisors of 14 (including negative divisors), which are $-14,$ $-7,$ $-2,$ $-1,$ $1,$ $2,$ $7,$ and $14.$  Checking, we find that the only integer roots are $\boxed{-2,1}.$

Gold:
-2,1

Wrong Prediction:
-2

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this equation: \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First off, I remember that for polynomial equations, the Rational Root Theorem is a useful tool. It states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as \(\frac{p}{q}\), has \(p\) as a factor of the constant term and \(q\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, our polynomial is a quartic (degree 4), with the leading coefficient being 1 (since the \(x^4\) term has a coefficient of 1) and the constant term is -14.

So, according to the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the factors of -14 divided by the factors of 1. Since the factors of 1 are just ±1, the possible rational roots are the same as the factors of -14. That would be ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14. These are all the possible integer roots because we're only considering integer solutions.

Alright, so my next step is to test each of these possible integer roots to see which ones actually satisfy the equation. Let's start with the smaller integers and work our way up.

First, let's try \(x = 1\). Plugging that into the equation:

\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14\).

Calculating that: 1 + 5 is 6, plus 9 is 15, minus 1 is 14, minus 14 is 0. So, 0. That means \(x = 1\) is a root! Nice, so 1 is definitely a root.

Now, since \(x = 1\) is a root, we can factor out \((x - 1)\) from the polynomial. Let me perform polynomial long division or synthetic division to factor it out.

I think synthetic division might be quicker here. Let's set up the coefficients: 1 (for \(x^4\)), 5, 9, -1, -14. We're dividing by \(x - 1\), so we use 1 as the test root.

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by 1: 1. Add to the next coefficient: 5 + 1 = 6.

Multiply 6 by 1: 6. Add to the next coefficient: 9 + 6 = 15.

Multiply 15 by 1: 15. Add to the next coefficient: -1 + 15 = 14.

Multiply 14 by 1: 14. Add to the last coefficient: -14 + 14 = 0. Perfect, no remainder.

So, after factoring out \((x - 1)\), the polynomial becomes \((x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14) = 0\).

Now, our task is to factor the cubic polynomial \(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\). Again, let's apply the Rational Root Theorem to this cubic. The constant term is 14 and the leading coefficient is 1, so possible rational roots are again ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.

Let's test these one by one.

First, \(x = -1\):

\((-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 15(-1) + 14 = -1 + 6 - 15 + 14\).

Calculating: -1 + 6 is 5, 5 - 15 is -10, -10 + 14 is 4. Not zero, so -1 isn't a root.

Next, \(x = -2\):

\((-2)^3 + 6(-2)^2 + 15(-2) + 14 = -8 + 24 - 30 + 14\).

Calculating: -8 + 24 is 16, 16 - 30 is -14, -14 + 14 is 0. Perfect, so \(x = -2\) is a root.

So, we can factor out \((x + 2)\) from the cubic polynomial using synthetic division again.

Set up the coefficients: 1 (for \(x^3\)), 6, 15, 14. Using \(x = -2\), we'll use -2 as the test root.

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by -2: -2. Add to the next coefficient: 6 + (-2) = 4.

Multiply 4 by -2: -8. Add to the next coefficient: 15 + (-8) = 7.

Multiply 7 by -2: -14. Add to the last coefficient: 14 + (-14) = 0. No remainder again.

So, factoring out \((x + 2)\), the cubic becomes \((x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7)\).

Now, our polynomial is factored as \((x - 1)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7) = 0\).

So, now we have a quadratic factor left: \(x^2 + 4x + 7\). Let's see if this quadratic can be factored further or if it has integer roots.

Again, applying the quadratic formula to \(x^2 + 4x + 7 = 0\):

Discriminant \(D = 16 - 28 = -12\). Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots, let alone integer roots. So, the quadratic doesn't factor over the integers.

Therefore, the only integer roots of the original quartic equation are \(x = 1\) and \(x = -2\).

Wait a minute, hold on. I remember that when we factored the quartic, we found two roots, 1 and -2, but the quartic is of degree four, so there should be four roots in total, including complex ones. But since we're only looking for integer roots, and the quadratic doesn't contribute any, we're done.

Just to be thorough, let me double-check if I missed any possible integer roots. The possible roots were ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14. We tried \(x = 1\), \(x = -2\). Let's check the others just to make sure.

Testing \(x = 2\):

\(2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14 = 16 + 40 + 36 - 2 - 14\).

Calculating: 16 + 40 = 56, +36 = 92, -2 = 90, -14 = 76 ≠ 0.

Testing \(x = -1\):

We did that earlier, it gave 4, not zero.

Testing \(x = -7\):

This might be tedious, but let me try.

\((-7)^4 + 5(-7)^3 + 9(-7)^2 - (-7) - 14\).

Calculate each term:

\((-7)^4 = 2401\),

\(5(-7)^3 = 5*(-343) = -1715\),

\(9(-7)^2 = 9*49 = 441\),

\(-(-7) = 7\),

\(-14\) remains.

So, adding them up:

2401 - 1715 + 441 + 7 - 14.

First, 2401 - 1715: 2401 - 1700 = 701, then subtract 15 more: 686.

686 + 441 = 1127.

1127 + 7 = 1134.

1134 - 14 = 1120. Definitely not zero.

Testing \(x = 7\):

\(7^4 + 5*7^3 + 9*7^2 - 7 -14\).

Calculate each term:

7^4 = 2401,

5*343 = 1715,

9*49 = 441,

-7,

-14.

Adding: 2401 + 1715 = 4116,

4116 + 441 = 4557,

4557 - 7 = 4550,

4550 -14 = 4536 ≠ 0.

Testing \(x = -14\):

This is probably going to be a huge number, but let me check.

\((-14)^4 = 14^4 = (14^2)^2 = 196^2 = 38416\),

5*(-14)^3 = 5*(-2744) = -13720,

9*(-14)^2 = 9*196 = 1764,

-(-14) = 14,

-14.

Adding all together:

38416 -13720 = 24696,

24696 + 1764 = 26460,

26460 +14 = 26474,

26474 -14 = 26460 ≠ 0.

Same with \(x = 14\):

14^4 is 38416,

5*14^3 = 5*2744 = 13720,

9*14^2 = 9*196 = 1764,

-14,

-14.

So, adding:

38416 +13720 = 52136,

52136 +1764 = 53900,

53900 -14 = 53886,

53886 -14 = 53872 ≠ 0.

So, none of the other possible integer roots satisfy the equation. Thus, the only integer roots are indeed \(x = 1\) and \(x = -2\).

Just to recap:

1. I used the Rational Root Theorem to list possible integer roots.
2. Tested each possible root by substitution.
3. Found that 1 and -2 are roots.
4. Factored the polynomial accordingly to reduce it to a quadratic.
5. Checked the quadratic for integer roots but found none.
6. Double-checked all possible roots just to be thorough.

So, confident that the integer roots are 1 and -2.

**Final Answer**
The integer roots are \boxed{1} and \boxed{-2}.
</think>

To find all the integer roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\), we start by applying the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term -14 divided by the factors of the leading coefficient 1, which gives us the possible integer roots: ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14.

Testing each possible root:

1. Testing \(x = 1\):
   \[
   1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0
   \]
   \(x = 1\) is a root.

2. Factoring out \((x - 1)\) using synthetic division, we get:
   \[
   (x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14) = 0
   \]

3. Testing the cubic polynomial \(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\) for integer roots:
   - Testing \(x = -2\):
     \[
     (-2)^3 + 6(-2)^2 + 15(-2) + 14 = -8 + 24 - 30 + 14 = 0
     \]
     \(x = -2\) is a root.

4. Factoring out \((x + 2)\) using synthetic division, we get:
   \[
   (x - 1)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7) = 0
   \]

5. The quadratic \(x^2 + 4x + 7\) has no real roots (discriminant is negative), so it does not contribute any integer roots.

After testing all possible integer roots and verifying, we find that the only integer roots are \(x = 1\) and \(x = -2\).

\[
\boxed{1}, \boxed{-2}
\]
