Correct Answer:
From $\triangle PQR$, we have $\angle R = 180^\circ - \angle Q - \angle P = 105^\circ$.  Since $\overline{ST}\parallel \overline{QR}$, we have $\angle STR = 180^\circ - \angle R = \boxed{75^\circ}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so here's the problem: we have two lines, ST and QR, which are parallel. There's a point P connected to Q and R, and there's another point S connected to both P and T. The diagram isn't shown, but the Asymptote code gives a rough idea. We know angle P is 40 degrees, angle Q is 35 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle STR.

Alright, let me visualize this. There's a point P connected to Q and R, forming triangle PQR. Then, point S is somewhere on PQ, and point T is somewhere on QR. ST is parallel to QR. Hmm. So, maybe triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR because of the parallel lines?

Wait, let me think step by step. First, angles at point P is 40 degrees. So, angle QPR is 40 degrees. Then, angle Q is 35 degrees, which is angle PQR. Since triangle PQR has angles at P, Q, and R, let's see.

In triangle PQR, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So, angle at P is 40, angle at Q is 35, so angle at R must be 180 - 40 - 35 = 105 degrees. So, angle PRQ is 105 degrees.

Now, ST is parallel to QR. So, maybe triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR by the basic proportionality theorem or something? If ST is parallel to QR, then the corresponding angles should be equal.

Wait, angle at P is common to both triangles PST and PQR, so that's 40 degrees. Since ST is parallel to QR, the corresponding angles where ST and QR meet the lines would be equal. So, angle PST is equal to angle PQR, which is 35 degrees. Similarly, angle PTS is equal to angle PRQ, which is 105 degrees.

Wait, is that right? So, in triangle PST, angle at S is 35 degrees, angle at T is 105 degrees, so angle at P is 40 degrees. So, that adds up to 180 degrees. So, triangle PST has angles 40, 35, 105.

But we need angle STR. Hmm, angle STR is at point S, between points T, S, and R. So, in the figure, it's the angle at S formed by points T, S, and R. So, that's part of triangle STR, I think.

Wait, maybe I need to use some transversal properties here. Since ST is parallel to QR, and PR is a transversal, then corresponding angles should be equal. So, angle SRT is equal to angle QRP? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider triangle STR. If I can find some angles in that triangle, then I can find angle STR.

Wait, angle at R is 105 degrees in triangle PQR. Since ST is parallel to QR, angle at T in triangle PST is equal to angle at R in triangle PQR, so that's 105 degrees. But wait, in triangle PST, angle at T is 105, angle at S is 35, angle at P is 40. So, in triangle STR, which is connected to triangle PST, maybe angle STR is part of triangle STR, but I need to find a way to relate it.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of transversals and corresponding angles. Since ST is parallel to QR, the angles formed by a transversal will be equal. So, if I consider line SR as a transversal intersecting ST and QR, then angle SRT is equal to angle STR? Wait, not necessarily. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, let's think about triangle STR. What do we know about it? We know that angle at R is 105 degrees, but that's in triangle PQR. In triangle STR, angle at R is the same as in triangle PQR? No, wait, maybe not. Because point R is connected to both T and S, so angle at R in triangle STR is different.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try another approach. Since ST is parallel to QR, triangles PST and PQR are similar. So, the ratio of sides is the same, but we might not need the ratio. So, the corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle PST is equal to angle PQR, which is 35 degrees. Angle P is common, 40 degrees. So, angle PTS is equal to angle PRQ, which is 105 degrees.

Therefore, in triangle STR, which is part of the figure, we can think of angle STR as part of triangle STR. Wait, but triangle STR isn't necessarily similar to anything.

Wait, maybe we can use the fact that angle at S in triangle PST is 35 degrees, and in triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which is adjacent to that 35 degrees? Or maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can look at angles around point S. So, point S is connected to P, T, and Q. So, around point S, the angles sum up to 360 degrees. So, angle PQS is angle P, which is 40 degrees. Then, angle QSP is something, and angle PST is 35 degrees. Wait, maybe I'm not getting this right.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the angles on the straight lines. Since ST is parallel to QR, the angles formed by a transversal should be equal. So, if I consider line PT as a transversal cutting ST and QR, then angle P is 40 degrees, which is equal on both sides? Or maybe the corresponding angles.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I need to draw the figure or label all the points properly. But since I don't have the exact figure, I have to go based on the Asymptote code.

Looking at the Asymptote code: points Q(0,0), R(1,0), P(1.1,0.5), S=0.6P, T=R + 0.6*(P-R). So, S is 60% along from P to Q, and T is 60% from R towards P.

So, S is on PQ, closer to Q, and T is on QR, closer to R.

So, line ST is drawn from S on PQ to T on QR, and ST is parallel to QR? Wait, no, ST is parallel to QR? Wait, QR is the base, from Q(0,0) to R(1,0). So, QR is horizontal. ST is parallel to QR, so ST is also horizontal.

But in the Asymptote code, T is R + 0.6*(P - R). So, from R, move 0.6*(P - R). Let me compute coordinates.

P is (1.1, 0.5). So, vector from R(1,0) to P is (0.1, 0.5). So, 0.6*(0.1, 0.5) is (0.06, 0.3). So, T is R + (0.06,0.3) = (1.06, 0.3). Similarly, S is 0.6*P, so S is (0.66, 0.3). So, line ST is from (0.66, 0.3) to (1.06, 0.3), which is indeed horizontal, same as QR which is from (0,0) to (1,0). So, yes, ST is parallel to QR.

So, in this figure, ST is a horizontal line segment from S(0.66, 0.3) to T(1.06, 0.3), and QR is from (0,0) to (1,0). So, ST is above QR, connected via point P(1.1, 0.5). So, lines SP and TP connect to S and T, respectively.

So, point S is on PQ, which is from Q(0,0) to P(1.1,0.5). So, PQ is a line going from (0,0) to (1.1,0.5), and S is 0.6 along that line. Similarly, P is connected to R(1,0), and T is on PR, 0.6 along from R.

So, in this figure, we have triangle PQR with base QR, and ST is a line parallel to QR, cutting PQ at S and PR at T.

So, in this case, triangles PST and PQR are similar because ST is parallel to QR, right? So, triangle PST ~ triangle PQR by the basic proportionality theorem.

So, similarity ratio can be computed. Since S is 0.6 along PQ from Q, so the ratio is 0.6. Similarly, T is 0.6 along PR from R, so ratio is 0.6.

Therefore, in triangle PST, angle at S is 35 degrees, angle at T is 105 degrees, angle at P is 40 degrees, as we computed earlier.

Now, angle STR is the angle at S between points T, S, and R. So, that's angle between ST and SR.

Wait, but in the figure, SR is a line from S to R. S is at (0.66, 0.3), R is at (1,0). So, the line SR goes from (0.66,0.3) to (1,0). Similarly, ST goes from (0.66,0.3) to (1.06,0.3). So, angle STR is the angle between SR and ST at point S.

So, to find angle STR, we need to find the angle between SR and ST at S.

Since we have coordinates, maybe we can compute the vectors and find the angle.

Coordinates:

S: (0.66, 0.3)

T: (1.06, 0.3)

R: (1, 0)

So, vector ST is from S to T: (1.06 - 0.66, 0.3 - 0.3) = (0.4, 0)

Vector SR is from S to R: (1 - 0.66, 0 - 0.3) = (0.34, -0.3)

So, angle STR is the angle between vectors ST(0.4, 0) and SR(0.34, -0.3). Since angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product formula.

Dot product of ST and SR is (0.4)(0.34) + (0)(-0.3) = 0.136 + 0 = 0.136

Magnitude of ST: sqrt(0.4^2 + 0^2) = 0.4

Magnitude of SR: sqrt(0.34^2 + (-0.3)^2) = sqrt(0.1156 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.2056) ≈ 0.4534

Therefore, cos(theta) = dot product / (|ST| |SR|) = 0.136 / (0.4 * 0.4534) ≈ 0.136 / 0.1814 ≈ 0.749

Therefore, theta ≈ arccos(0.749) ≈ 41.1 degrees.

Hmm, so approximately 41.1 degrees. But since the problem gives angles as 40 and 35, which are whole numbers, maybe the answer is 35 degrees? Or maybe 40?

Wait, but according to the calculation, it's approximately 41.1, which is close to 40, but not exactly.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the coordinates. Let's see.

Wait, from the Asymptote code, P is (1.1, 0.5). So, exact coordinates:

S = 0.6 * P = (0.6 * 1.1, 0.6 * 0.5) = (0.66, 0.3)

T = R + 0.6*(P - R) = (1,0) + 0.6*(1.1 -1, 0.5 -0) = (1,0) + 0.6*(0.1,0.5) = (1 + 0.06, 0 + 0.3) = (1.06, 0.3)

So, those are exact coordinates.

Then, vector ST is (1.06 - 0.66, 0.3 - 0.3) = (0.4,0)

Vector SR is (1 - 0.66, 0 - 0.3) = (0.34, -0.3)

So, exact dot product is 0.4 * 0.34 + 0 * (-0.3) = 0.136

|ST| = 0.4

|SR| = sqrt(0.34^2 + (-0.3)^2) = sqrt(0.1156 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.2056) ≈ 0.4534

So, cos(theta) = 0.136 / (0.4 * 0.4534) = 0.136 / 0.1814 ≈ 0.749

Then, arccos(0.749) ≈ 41.1 degrees.

So, 41.1 degrees approximately.

But since the given angles are 40 and 35, which are exact, maybe there is a more precise way to calculate this.

Alternatively, maybe using triangle properties.

Since ST is parallel to QR, then angle between ST and SP is equal to angle between QR and QP, which is angle P, 40 degrees.

Wait, but in triangle PST, angle at S is 35 degrees, angle at P is 40 degrees, angle at T is 105 degrees.

So, in triangle STR, point S is connected to T and R.

Wait, maybe we can consider triangle STR and triangle PQR.

Wait, if I can find some relationship.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in triangle STR, angle at S is what we need, and we know some sides.

Wait, but without knowing the lengths, it's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines.

But since we have coordinates, perhaps the vector approach is more precise.

Wait, let me calculate the exact angle.

We have:

Dot product: 0.136

|ST| = 0.4

|SR| = sqrt(0.34^2 + 0.3^2) = sqrt(0.1156 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.2056)

So, 0.34^2 is 0.1156, 0.3^2 is 0.09, so total is 0.2056.

sqrt(0.2056) is approximately 0.4533.

So, cos(theta) = 0.136 / (0.4 * 0.4533) = 0.136 / 0.1813 ≈ 0.749

So, arccos(0.749). Let me compute this more accurately.

cos(theta) = 0.749

What's arccos(0.749)?

We know that cos(40°) ≈ 0.7660

cos(45°) ≈ 0.7071

So, 0.749 is between 40 and 45 degrees.

Compute the difference:

0.7660 - 0.749 = 0.017

The difference between cos(40) and cos(45) is about 0.7660 - 0.7071 = 0.0589 over 5 degrees.

So, 0.017 is roughly 0.017 / 0.0589 ≈ 0.287 of the interval.

So, 0.287 * 5 ≈ 1.435 degrees.

Therefore, arccos(0.749) ≈ 40° + (5° - 1.435°) ≈ 40° + 3.565° ≈ 43.565°, but this is conflicting with the previous.

Wait, actually, from 45° to 40°, the cosine decreases.

Wait, perhaps better to compute it using a calculator.

Alternatively, since in the problem, the angles are given as 40 and 35, maybe the exact angle is 35 degrees? Or 40?

Wait, but according to the coordinates, it's approximately 41.1 degrees.

But that seems messy. Maybe I made an error in interpreting the figure.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of triangle properties.

Since ST is parallel to QR, then angle SRT is equal to angle QRP?

Wait, angle QRP is angle at R in triangle PQR, which is 105 degrees.

So, angle SRT is 105 degrees? But that seems too large.

Wait, in triangle STR, angle at R is part of the figure. If ST is parallel to QR, then angle SRT is equal to angle QRP. Wait, angle QRP is 105 degrees, so angle SRT is also 105 degrees? But in triangle STR, the sum of angles would be 180, so that might not make sense.

Alternatively, maybe angle SRT is equal to angle QRP? Wait, no, because R is the same point, but the lines are different.

Wait, maybe using the concept of corresponding angles.

Since ST is parallel to QR, and line SR is a transversal, then angle SRT is equal to angle QRS.

Wait, angle QRS is angle at R in triangle PQR, which is 105 degrees. So, angle SRT would be 105 degrees. But that seems too big because in triangle STR, angle at R is 105, angle at S is what we're looking for, and angle at T is something else.

Wait, but if angle SRT is 105, then the other angles would have to be small, but in reality, angle at S is 35 or 40.

Wait, maybe I got the corresponding angles wrong.

Alternatively, maybe angle STR is equal to angle P?

Wait, angle P is 40 degrees. But in triangle STR, angle STR is at S, not at P.

Wait, maybe using the fact that angles on a straight line sum to 180. Since ST is parallel to QR, then angle between ST and SP is equal to angle between QR and QP.

But angle between QR and QP is angle P, which is 40 degrees. So, angle between ST and SP is 40 degrees.

In triangle PST, angle at S is 35 degrees, angle at P is 40 degrees, so angle at T is 105 degrees.

Therefore, in triangle STR, we have point S connected to T and R.

Wait, maybe using the fact that in triangle STR, we can find angle STR if we can find some other angles.

Wait, perhaps triangle STR shares angle at S with triangle PST.

Wait, in triangle PST, angle at S is 35 degrees. But that is angle PST, not angle STR.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe triangle STR is similar to another triangle?

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to use the Law of Sines in triangle PST and triangle STR.

In triangle PST:

Angle at P: 40°, angle at S: 35°, angle at T: 105°

So, sides opposite these angles: let's denote PS, ST, PT.

But without side lengths, it's hard to find exact lengths.

Alternatively, maybe consider the ratio of sides.

But without more information, it's difficult.

Wait, but in triangle STR, we have:

Point S connected to T and R.

We can find coordinates, as we did before, so we can compute the angle.

Earlier, we found that angle STR is approximately 41.1 degrees.

But since the problem gives angles as 40 and 35, which are integers, perhaps the answer is 35 degrees? Or maybe 40?

Wait, but according to the coordinates, it's approximately 41.1 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it exactly.

Let me compute the vectors more precisely.

Vector ST: from S(0.66, 0.3) to T(1.06, 0.3): (0.4, 0)

Vector SR: from S(0.66, 0.3) to R(1,0): (0.34, -0.3)

So, the angle between vectors (0.4, 0) and (0.34, -0.3)

The formula for the angle theta between two vectors u and v is:

cos(theta) = (u • v) / (|u| |v|)

So, u • v = 0.4 * 0.34 + 0 * (-0.3) = 0.136

|u| = sqrt(0.4^2 + 0^2) = 0.4

|v| = sqrt(0.34^2 + (-0.3)^2) = sqrt(0.1156 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.2056)

So, cos(theta) = 0.136 / (0.4 * sqrt(0.2056)) = 0.136 / (0.4 * 0.4534) ≈ 0.136 / 0.1813 ≈ 0.749

So, theta ≈ arccos(0.749) ≈ 41.1 degrees.

So, approximately 41 degrees. But the problem gives angles as 40 and 35, which are whole numbers, so maybe 35 is too low, 40 is close but not exact, 41 is not an integer.

Wait, maybe the angle is 35 degrees? But from calculation, it's 41.1.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate approach.

Wait, let's try using triangle properties.

Since ST is parallel to QR, then triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR.

So, similarity ratio is 0.6, so all sides are scaled by 0.6.

Therefore, angle at S in triangle PST is equal to angle at Q in triangle PQR, which is 35 degrees.

Wait, but angle at S in triangle PST is 35 degrees, which is angle PST.

But in triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which is different.

Wait, perhaps angle STR is equal to angle PQR, which is 35 degrees? But why?

Wait, because if we consider the transversal SR cutting the parallel lines ST and QR, then angle SRT is equal to angle QRP? Hmm.

Wait, let me think.

Since ST is parallel to QR, and SR is a transversal.

Therefore, angle SRT is equal to angle QRP.

But angle QRP is the angle at R in triangle PQR, which is 105 degrees. So, angle SRT is 105 degrees.

But in triangle STR, angle at R is 105, angle at S is what we need, angle STR, and angle at T is something.

Wait, but in triangle STR, the sum of angles is 180, so angle STR + angle SRT + angle TSR = 180.

But we don't know angle TSR.

Wait, angle TSR is the angle at S between lines SR and SP. But we know in triangle PST, angle at S is 35 degrees.

Wait, but angle TSR is part of angle P.

Wait, angle P is 40 degrees, which is the angle at P between lines PQ and PR.

Given that S is on PQ, maybe angle between SP and SR is the same as angle between SP and SR.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that triangle PST ~ triangle PQR, with ratio 0.6.

Therefore, all corresponding angles are equal.

So, angle PST = angle PQR = 35°, angle P = angle P = 40°, angle PTS = angle PRQ = 105°.

Therefore, in triangle PST, angle at S is 35°, at P 40°, at T 105°.

Now, in triangle STR, point S is connected to T and R.

Wait, from point S, we have line SP going to P, line SR going to R, and line ST going to T.

So, angle at S between SP and SR is angle PSR, which is not directly given.

But we can consider that angle PSR is equal to angle PQR because of the parallel lines? Wait, maybe.

Wait, since ST is parallel to QR, and SP is a transversal, then angle between SP and ST is equal to angle between SP and QR.

But angle between SP and QR is angle PQR, which is 35 degrees.

Wait, so angle between SP and ST is 35 degrees.

But in triangle PST, angle at S is 35 degrees, which is between PS and ST.

Therefore, angle between SP and SR is angle PSR = angle between SP and ST + angle between ST and SR.

But angle between SP and ST is 35 degrees, and angle between ST and SR is angle STR, which is what we need to find.

Wait, but in triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which is adjacent to angle between ST and SR.

Wait, no, angle STR is the angle between ST and SR at S. So, angle STR is exactly angle between ST and SR.

So, angle between SP and SR is angle PSR = 35° + angle STR.

But in triangle PSR, we can compute angle PSR.

Wait, triangle PSR: points P, S, R.

We know angle at P is 40°, angle at S is angle PSR, angle at R is angle PRS.

Wait, but angle PRS is the same as angle QRP, which is 105°, because PR is being cut by transversal QR, but wait, QR is the base.

Wait, no, angle PRS is part of triangle PSR, not necessarily equal to angle QRP.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe go back to coordinates.

Given that angle STR is approximately 41.1°, which is roughly 41 degrees. Since the problem provides angles as 40 and 35, which are close, maybe the answer is 35 degrees or 40 degrees, but 41 is closer to 40.

But 40 is an option, but the calculation says approximately 41.1. Hmm.

Wait, but since in the Asymptote code, S is 0.6 along PQ, and T is 0.6 along PR from R. So, the triangles are similar with ratio 0.6.

Therefore, the angles should be the same as in triangle PQR.

In triangle PQR, angles are 40°, 35°, 105°. So, in triangle PST, angles are 40°, 35°, 105°, as we had before.

Therefore, in triangle STR, point S is connected to T and R.

Wait, maybe we can think of triangle STR as part of triangle PQR.

Wait, in triangle PQR, point S is on PQ, and point T is on PR.

So, triangle STR is inside triangle PQR.

Therefore, maybe angle STR is equal to angle PQR, which is 35°, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle STR.

But without knowing the sides, it's challenging.

Wait, but in triangle PST, we can figure out the ratio of sides.

Since triangle PST ~ triangle PQR with ratio 0.6, so PS = 0.6 PQ, ST = 0.6 QR, PT = 0.6 PR.

Given that in triangle PQR, QR is the base, which is length 1 (from (0,0) to (1,0)).

Therefore, QR = 1, so ST = 0.6 * 1 = 0.6.

Similarly, PQ is from (0,0) to (1.1, 0.5). So, length PQ is sqrt(1.1² + 0.5²) = sqrt(1.21 + 0.25) = sqrt(1.46) ≈ 1.208.

Therefore, PS = 0.6 * PQ ≈ 0.6 * 1.208 ≈ 0.725.

Which matches with S being at (0.66, 0.3). So, PS is from (0,0) to (0.66, 0.3), which is sqrt(0.66² + 0.3²) ≈ sqrt(0.4356 + 0.09) ≈ sqrt(0.5256) ≈ 0.725, which matches.

Similarly, PR is from (1.1, 0.5) to (1,0). So, PR length is sqrt( (1.1 -1)^2 + (0.5 - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(0.01 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.26) ≈ 0.51.

Therefore, PT = 0.6 * PR ≈ 0.6 * 0.51 ≈ 0.306.

From point P(1.1, 0.5) to T(1.06, 0.3), which is sqrt( (1.1 -1.06)^2 + (0.5 - 0.3)^2 ) = sqrt(0.0016 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.0416) ≈ 0.204, which is approximately 0.306? Wait, no, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe my calculation is wrong.

Wait, PR is from P(1.1,0.5) to R(1,0). So, vector PR is (-0.1, -0.5). So, length PR is sqrt(0.01 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.26) ≈ 0.5099.

Therefore, 0.6 * PR ≈ 0.306.

But PT is from P(1.1,0.5) to T(1.06, 0.3). So, vector PT is (-0.04, -0.2). Length is sqrt(0.0016 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.0416) ≈ 0.204, which is less than 0.306.

Wait, so perhaps my initial assumption that triangle PST ~ triangle PQR with ratio 0.6 is incorrect.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, S is 0.6 along PQ, so PS = 0.6 PQ, yes. Similarly, T is 0.6 along PR from R, so RT = 0.6 PR, so PT = 0.4 PR.

Wait, maybe that's the case. So, if S is 0.6 along PQ from P, and T is 0.6 along PR from R, then the ratio would be different.

Wait, maybe I got the direction wrong. If S is 0.6 along PQ from Q, then PS = 0.4 PQ. Similarly, if T is 0.6 along PR from R, then RT = 0.6 PR, so PT = 0.4 PR.

Wait, in that case, the ratio would be 0.4, not 0.6.

So, triangle PST ~ triangle PQR with ratio 0.4.

So, if that's the case, then angles would be the same, but sides scaled by 0.4.

So, in triangle PST, angle at S is 35°, angle at P is 40°, angle at T is 105°, same as triangle PQR.

So, in triangle STR, angle at S is angle between SR and ST.

Wait, since triangle PST ~ triangle PQR with ratio 0.4, then in triangle STR, which is part of triangle PQR, maybe angle STR is equal to angle PQR, which is 35°, but that might not be.

Wait, maybe the triangles are similar, so the angles at S and R are same.

Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe use the Law of Sines in triangle STR.

But without side lengths, it's difficult.

Wait, let me think differently.

Since ST is parallel to QR, then angle between ST and SR is equal to angle between QR and QR's continuation, which is angle QRP.

But angle QRP is 105°, so angle between ST and SR is 105°, which would be angle SRT.

But that contradicts with the coordinate calculation.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the angles.

Alternatively, since ST is parallel to QR, then angle between SR and ST is equal to angle between SR and QR, but on the other side.

Wait, actually, when two lines are cut by a transversal, the alternate interior angles are equal.

So, since ST || QR, and SR is a transversal, then angle between SR and ST is equal to angle between SR and QR.

But angle between SR and QR is angle QRS, which is 105°, so angle between SR and ST is also 105°, which is angle SRT.

Therefore, angle SRT is 105°, so in triangle STR, angle at R is 105°, angle at S is what we need, angle STR, and angle at T is something else.

Wait, but in triangle STR, sum of angles is 180, so angle STR + angle SRT + angle TSR = 180.

But we know angle SRT is 105°, angle TSR is angle at S between SR and ST, which is angle STR.

Wait, no, angle TSR is the angle at S between SR and ST, which is angle STR.

Wait, no, angle at S is angle STR, which is the angle between ST and SR.

Wait, actually, angle SRT is the angle at R, angle STR is the angle at S, and angle at T is angle STS?

Wait, maybe I'm getting the labels wrong.

Wait, in triangle STR, the points are S, T, R.

So, angle SRT is at R, angle STR is at S, angle RST is at T.

So, angle SRT is at R, which we found is 105°, angle STR is at S, which is what we're trying to find, and angle RST is at T.

So, 105 + angle STR + angle RST = 180

But since triangle STR is part of triangle PQR, maybe we can find angle RST.

Wait, in triangle PQR, angle at T is 105°, but in triangle STR, angle at T is angle RST.

Wait, but angle at T in triangle PQR is angle PQR, but in triangle STR, angle at T is different.

Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Wait, maybe the key is that in triangle STR, angle at R is 105°, angle at S is what we need, and angle at T is something.

But without more information, it's difficult to find angle STR.

But according to the coordinate calculation, it's approximately 41.1°, which is roughly 41°, but as the problem gives 40 and 35, which are close.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 35°, as it's the other given angle.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that in triangle PQR, angle at Q is 35°, and since ST is parallel to QR, then angle between SP and ST is 35°, which is angle PST.

Therefore, in triangle PST, angle at S is 35°, angle at P is 40°, so angle at T is 105°.

Therefore, in triangle STR, angle at S is angle between ST and SR.

But since angle between ST and SP is 35°, as we found from the coordinates, then angle between SP and SR is 35° + angle between ST and SR, which is angle STR.

But in triangle PSR, we can find angle at S.

Wait, triangle PSR: points P, S, R.

We know angle at P is 40°, angle at S is angle PSR, which is angle between SP and SR.

Wait, but we don't know angle at R, which is angle PRS.

But in triangle PQR, angle at R is 105°, which is angle PRQ.

But angle PRS is not the same as angle PRQ.

Wait, unless PRS is equal to PRQ, but they are not.

Wait, angle PRQ is 105°, but angle PRS is the angle at R in triangle PSR.

So, unless triangle PSR is similar to something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to go back to coordinates and compute the exact angle.

From earlier, we had:

Vector ST: (0.4, 0)

Vector SR: (0.34, -0.3)

Dot product: 0.136

|ST| = 0.4

|SR| = sqrt(0.34² + (-0.3)²) = sqrt(0.1156 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.2056) ≈ 0.4534

Therefore, cos(theta) = 0.136 / (0.4 * 0.4534) ≈ 0.749

So, arccos(0.749) ≈ 41.1 degrees.

Therefore, angle STR is approximately 41.1 degrees.

But since the problem is likely expecting an exact value, maybe 35°, but that conflicts with the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate approach.

Wait, let's try to compute the angle using exact values.

Points:

S: (0.66, 0.3)

T: (1.06, 0.3)

R: (1, 0)

So, vector ST: (1.06 - 0.66, 0.3 - 0.3) = (0.4, 0)

Vector SR: (1 - 0.66, 0 - 0.3) = (0.34, -0.3)

So, exact calculation:

Dot product: 0.4 * 0.34 + 0 * (-0.3) = 0.136

|ST| = sqrt(0.4² + 0²) = 0.4

|SR| = sqrt(0.34² + (-0.3)^2) = sqrt(0.1156 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.2056)

So, |SR| = sqrt(2056/10000) = sqrt(514/2500) = sqrt(257/1250) ≈ 0.4534

So, cos(theta) = 0.136 / (0.4 * sqrt(2056)/100)

Wait, wait, 0.4 * sqrt(2056)/100 = 0.4 * (sqrt(2056)/100) = 0.4 * (approx 45.34)/100 = 0.4 * 0.4534 ≈ 0.1813

So, 0.136 / 0.1813 ≈ 0.749

So, same as before.

Therefore, arccos(0.749) ≈ 41.1 degrees.

So, exact value is arccos(0.749), which is approximately 41.1 degrees.

But 41.1 is approximately 41°, but the problem is likely expecting an exact value.

Wait, perhaps 35°, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe 40°, which is angle P.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 35°, as angle PQR is 35°, but in triangle STR, angle at S is 35°, but no, that would be angle PQR, but in triangle STR, it's a different angle.

Alternatively, maybe it's 40°, as angle P is 40°, which is another given.

Alternatively, maybe my initial assumption is wrong, and the angle is 35°.

Wait, another approach: Since ST is parallel to QR, then triangle PQR is similar to triangle PST, as we thought before.

Therefore, the ratio of sides is 0.6, so PS = 0.6 PQ, PT = 0.6 PR.

Therefore, in triangle PST, angle at S is 35°, angle at P is 40°, angle at T is 105°, same as triangle PQR.

Therefore, in triangle STR, which is part of triangle PQR, angle at S is angle between SR and ST, which is angle STR.

But since ST is parallel to QR, and SR is a transversal, then angle between SR and ST is equal to angle between SR and QR on the other side.

But angle between SR and QR is angle QRS.

Wait, angle QRS is at point R, between QR and RS.

But angle at R in triangle PQR is 105°, which is angle PRQ.

So, angle QRS is part of angle PRQ.

Therefore, angle QRS is part of 105°, so angle between SR and QR is angle QRS.

Therefore, angle between SR and ST is equal to angle QRS.

But angle QRS is equal to angle in triangle PSR at point R.

Wait, in triangle PSR, angle at R is angle PRS.

Wait, in triangle PSR, we can compute angle at R.

We have triangle PSR with sides:

PS: 0.6 PQ ≈ 0.725

SR: sqrt(0.34² + (-0.3)^2) ≈ 0.4534

PR: sqrt( (1.1 -1)^2 + (0.5 -0)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.01 + 0.25) ≈ 0.5099

So, sides: PS ≈ 0.725, SR ≈ 0.4534, PR ≈ 0.5099

So, using Law of Cosines in triangle PSR:

cos(angle PRS) = (PS² + PR² - SR²) / (2 * PS * PR)

Compute:

PS² ≈ 0.725² ≈ 0.5256

PR² ≈ 0.5099² ≈ 0.2599

SR² ≈ 0.4534² ≈ 0.2056

So,

cos(angle PRS) = (0.5256 + 0.2599 - 0.2056) / (2 * 0.725 * 0.5099)

Compute numerator:

0.5256 + 0.2599 = 0.7855

0.7855 - 0.2056 ≈ 0.5799

Denominator:

2 * 0.725 * 0.5099 ≈ 2 * 0.725 * 0.5099 ≈ 2 * 0.368 ≈ 0.736

So,

cos(angle PRS) ≈ 0.5799 / 0.736 ≈ 0.786

So, angle PRS ≈ arccos(0.786) ≈ 38 degrees.

Therefore, angle between SR and QR is angle QRS ≈ 38 degrees.

Therefore, angle between SR and ST is also 38 degrees.

Therefore, angle STR ≈ 38 degrees.

But wait, in our coordinate approach, we had angle STR ≈ 41.1°, which is close but not exactly 38. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using the exact values, but that might not be necessary.

But 38° is not one of the given angles, but 35° and 40° are.

Alternatively, maybe my calculation is slightly off.

Wait, the Law of Cosines in triangle PSR:

angle PRS ≈ 38°, but in triangle PQR, angle at R is 105°, so angle QRS is 38°, angle SRP is 105° - 38° = 67°.

But maybe that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that angle STR is approximately 41.1°, which is roughly 41°, but since the problem gives 40 and 35, which are close, maybe 35° is the intended answer.

Alternatively, maybe 35°, thinking that angle between SR and ST is equal to angle PQR, which is 35°.

But according to the calculations, it's 41°, so that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 40°, as angle P is 40°, so perhaps angle STR is 40°, but that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, maybe 35°, since triangle PST has angle at S of 35°, which is similar to angle at Q.

Wait, but angle at S in triangle STR is different.

Wait, maybe the answer is 35°, but I'm unsure.

Wait, since all my calculations point to approximately 41°, which is closest to 40°, maybe 40° is the intended answer.

Alternatively, maybe the exact value is 35°, but I can't see how.

Wait, another approach: Since ST is parallel to QR, then angle between ST and SR is equal to angle between QR and another line.

Wait, but angle between QR and SR is angle QRS.

Which we found in triangle PSR to be approximately 38°, which is close to 40°, so maybe 40° is the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the exact value is 35°, but I'm not sure.

Given that, I think the answer is 40°, but it's a bit of a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe 35°, since angle PQR is 35°, and ST is parallel to QR, then angle between SR and ST is equal to angle between SR and QR, which is 35°, but according to the coordinate calculation, it's 41°, so that doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe another way: Since ST is parallel to QR, then angle between SR and ST is equal to angle between SR and QR on the other side.

But angle between SR and QR is angle QRS, which is 38°, so angle between SR and ST is also 38°, so angle STR is 38°, but that is not an option.

Alternatively, maybe angle between SR and ST is equal to angle between SR and QR on the same side, which is 180 - 38 = 142°, which is not helpful.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating.

Given that, perhaps accept that angle STR is approximately 41°, but since in the problem, angles given are 40 and 35, maybe it's 40°, or 35°, but 41 is closer to 40.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 35°, thinking that angle PQR is 35°, and it's carried over.

But in reality, angle STR is approximately 41°, so maybe the answer is 40°, which is the closest given angle.

Alternatively, maybe it's 35°, but I think 41° is more accurate.

But since the problem is likely constructed with integer angles, maybe 35° is the answer.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, angle P is 40°, angle Q is 35°, so maybe angle STR is 35°, same as angle Q.

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that in triangle STR, angle at R is 105°, angle at S is 40°, angle at T is 35°, but that might not hold.

Wait, no, triangle STR is different.

Wait, I think I've spent too much time on this, and the coordinate approach gives approximately 41°, so since 40 is an option, maybe 40°, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since in triangle PST, angle at S is 35°, and in triangle STR, angle at S is angle between ST and SR, which is supplementary to angle between ST and SP.

Since angle between ST and SP is 35°, then angle between ST and SR is 180 - 35 = 145°, but that can't be, because in triangle STR, angle at S can't be 145°, since sum of angles would exceed 180.

Wait, no, angle between ST and SR is different.

Wait, in triangle STR, angle at S is angle between SR and ST. In vector terms, angle between SR and ST is 41°, which we calculated.

So, I think that angle STR is approximately 41°, so maybe 40° is the closest answer.

But since we have exact calculation as 41.1°, which is approximately 41°, and 40 is the closest given angle, so perhaps the answer is 40°.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 35°, as in triangle PST, angle at S is 35°, so perhaps triangle STR has angle 35°, but I don't see a direct relation.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 35°, as angle PQR is 35°, and parallel lines make corresponding angles equal.

But in this case, angle PQR is 35°, angle between QR and QP is 35°, and since ST is parallel to QR, angle between ST and SP is 35°, but angle at S in triangle STR is different.

I think I've spent enough time, and perhaps the answer is 35°, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Since PQ is divided at S as 0.6, so PS = 0.6 PQ, and PR is divided at T as 0.6 from R, so RT = 0.6 PR.

Therefore, in triangle PQR, points S and T divide PQ and PR respectively in the ratio 0.6.

Therefore, by the basic proportionality theorem (Thales' theorem), ST is parallel to QR, which we already know.

Therefore, in triangle PQR, with points S on PQ and T on PR, such that PS/SQ = RT/TR = 0.6, so the ratio is 3:2.

Therefore, the triangles PST and PQR are similar with ratio 0.6.

Therefore, angle at S in triangle PST is 35°, angle at P is 40°, angle at T is 105°.

Therefore, in triangle STR, which is part of triangle PQR, angle at R is 105°, angle at S is something, angle at T is something.

But since triangle STR shares point R with triangle PQR, which has angle 105°, and triangle STR is inside triangle PQR.

Therefore, perhaps angle at S is equal to angle at T in triangle PQR.

Wait, angle at T in triangle PQR is 105°, same as angle at R in triangle PQR.

Wait, no, angle at T in triangle PQR is angle QTR, but since we're dealing with triangle STR, angle at T is different.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of triangle STR as a separate triangle.

Wait, in triangle STR, we know angle at R is 105°, angle at S is angle STR, which we need to find, and angle at T is angle SRT.

But in triangle PQR, angle at R is 105°, which is angle PRQ.

But angle SRT is part of angle PRQ.

Therefore, angle SRT = angle PRQ - angle SRQ.

But angle SRQ is angle between SR and RQ.

But RQ is QR, which is parallel to ST, so angle between SR and RQ is equal to angle between SR and ST.

Which is angle STR.

Wait, so angle SRT = angle PRQ - angle STR.

But angle PRQ is 105°, so angle SRT = 105° - angle STR.

But in triangle STR, sum of angles is 180°, so angle STR + angle SRT + angle RST = 180.

But angle RST is angle at T, which is angle STR_T, which is angle at T in triangle STR.

But angle STR_T is equal to angle PQR, which is 35°, because of parallel lines.

Wait, since ST || QR, then angle between ST and SR is equal to angle between QR and SR, which is angle QRS.

But angle QRS is part of angle PRQ, which is 105°, so angle QRS = angle PRQ - angle SRP.

Wait, angle SRP is angle at P in triangle PSR.

But I think this is going in circles.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that in triangle STR, angle at R is 105°, angle at S is x, angle at T is 180 - 105 - x = 75 - x.

But angle at T is angle SRT, which is equal to angle between SR and RT.

But since RT is part of PR, which is divided in ratio 0.6, so perhaps angle SRT can be found.

Wait, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle STR.

But without side lengths, it's difficult.

Alternatively, maybe consider triangle STR and triangle PQR.

But without more information, it's hard.

Given that, and my coordinate approach gives approximately 41°, which is not an integer, but the problem gives 40 and 35, which are close.

Given that, and considering that angle P is 40°, angle Q is 35°, perhaps angle STR is 35°, as it's similar.

But I can't be sure.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 35°, as angle PQR is 35°, and since ST || QR, angle between ST and SR is equal to angle between QR and SR, which is 35°, making angle STR = 35°.

Wait, that makes sense.

Because ST is parallel to QR, so the angle between ST and SR is equal to the angle between QR and SR.

But angle between QR and SR is angle QRS.

But in triangle PSR, angle at R is angle PRS ≈ 38°, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, if angle between QR and SR is 35°, then angle between ST and SR is also 35°, making angle STR = 35°.

But according to the coordinate calculation, that angle is 41°, so maybe 35° is the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong.

Given that, and given that angle PQR is 35°, and ST is parallel to QR, then angle between ST and SR is equal to angle between QR and SR, which is 35°, so angle STR is 35°.

Therefore, the measure of angle STR is 35°, which is option B.

But wait, in the coordinate approach, it's approximately 41°, so maybe 35° is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe 35° is correct.

Wait, let me think again.

Since ST is parallel to QR, then angle between ST and SR is equal to angle between QR and SR.

But angle between QR and SR is angle QRS, which in triangle PQR is angle at R.

But in triangle PQR, angle at R is 105°, which is angle PRQ.

Therefore, angle between QR and SR is part of angle PRQ.

So, angle between QR and SR is angle QRS, which in triangle PSR we calculated as 38°, which is close to 40°.

Therefore, angle between ST and SR is also 38°, so angle STR is 38°, which is approximately 40°, which is one of the options.

Therefore, the measure of angle STR is 40°, which is option A.

Therefore, I think the answer is 40°, which is option A.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{40}
</think>

In the given problem, we have $\overline{ST} \parallel \overline{QR}$, $\angle P = 40^\circ$, and $\angle Q = 35^\circ$. We need to find the measure of $\angle STR$.

1. **Calculate $\angle R$ in $\triangle PQR$**:
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$.
   - $\angle R = 180^\circ - \angle P - \angle Q = 180^\circ - 40^\circ - 35^\circ = 105^\circ$.

2. **Determine the coordinates of points**:
   - Using the Asymptote code, we find the coordinates of points $P$, $Q$, $R$, $S$, and $T$.
   - $P = (1.1, 0.5)$, $Q = (0, 0)$, $R = (1, 0)$.
   - $S$ is 60% along $PQ$ from $Q$, so $S = (0.66, 0.3)$.
   - $T$ is 60% along $PR$ from $R$, so $T = (1.06, 0.3)$.

3. **Calculate vectors**:
   - Vector $ST = (0.4, 0)$.
   - Vector $SR = (0.34, -0.3)$.

4. **Use the dot product to find the angle**:
   - The dot product of vectors $ST$ and $SR$ is $0.136$.
   - Magnitudes of vectors $ST$ and $SR$ are $0.4$ and approximately $0.4534$ respectively.
   - $\cos(\theta) = \frac{0.136}{0.4 \times 0.4534} \approx 0.749$.
   - $\theta \approx \arccos(0.749) \approx 41.1^\circ$.

5. **Consider the properties of parallel lines and similar triangles**:
   - Since $ST \parallel QR$, the angle between $ST$ and $SR$ is equal to the angle between $QR$ and $SR$.
   - Given the problem's context and the calculated approximate angle, the closest answer is $40^\circ$.

Thus, the measure of $\angle STR$ is $\boxed{40}$.
