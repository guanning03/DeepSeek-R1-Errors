Question:
In the circle with center $Q$, radii $AQ$ and $BQ$ form a right angle. The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, as shown. The radius of the circle with center $Q$ is 14 inches. What is the radius of the smaller semicircle? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Correct Answer:
Let $C$ and $D$ be the centers of the larger and smaller semicircles, respectively, and let $r$ be the radius of the smaller semicircle.  We have $QD=QB-DB=14-r$ and $QC=7$, so we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $QCD$ to obtain  \[
(14-r)^2+7^2=(7+r)^2.
\] After squaring both binomials and subtracting $7^2+r^2$ from both sides simplifies to $196-28r=14r$.  Adding $28r$ to both sides and dividing by 42, we find $r=\boxed{\frac{14}{3}}$ inches.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a circle with center Q. The radii AQ and BQ form a right angle, which means they are perpendicular to each other. The circle has a radius of 14 inches. There are two smaller regions that are tangent semicircles, and I need to find the radius of the smaller semicircle. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me sketch the scenario in my mind. There's a circle centered at Q, and from Q, two radii AQ and BQ are drawn, forming a right angle. So, points A and B are on the circumference of the main circle, and the angle between AQ and BQ is 90 degrees. That means the sector AQB is a quarter of the circle since a full circle is 360 degrees, and a right angle is 90 degrees.

Now, the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles. I assume these semicircles are each tangent to the radii AQ and BQ and also tangent to the main circle. So, each semicircle is sitting in the corner formed by AQ and BQ, but they must also touch the main circle somewhere.

Let me denote the radius of the smaller semicircle as r. Since it's a semicircle, its diameter would be 2r. But how exactly is it positioned? It should be tangent to both AQ and BQ, which are perpendicular, so the center of the semicircle must lie along the angle bisector of the right angle between AQ and BQ.

Wait, the angle bisector of a right angle is a line that splits the 90-degree angle into two 45-degree angles. So, the center of the semicircle should lie somewhere along that bisector. Also, since the semicircle is tangent to AQ and BQ, the distance from the center of the semicircle to each of these radii must be equal to its radius r.

Hmm, so if I consider the coordinate system with point Q at the origin, point A on the positive x-axis, and point B on the positive y-axis. Then the bisector would be the line y = x. The center of the semicircle would lie somewhere on this line, say at point (a, a). The distance from this center to both the x-axis and y-axis should be equal to r, which would mean a = r, right? Because the distance from (a, a) to the x-axis is a, and to the y-axis is also a, so both must equal r. Therefore, the center is at (r, r).

But wait, the semicircle is also tangent to the main circle. The main circle has a radius of 14 inches, so its equation is x² + y² = 14² = 196. The semicircle is a smaller semicircle with radius r, centered at (r, r). Since it's tangent to the main circle, the distance between the centers of the two circles should be equal to the sum of their radii if they are externally tangent. But wait, is the semicircle inside the main circle or outside? It must be inside because it's a smaller region. So, if the semicircle is inside the main circle, then the distance between their centers should be equal to the difference of their radii.

Wait, let me clarify. If two circles are tangent internally, the distance between their centers is equal to the difference of their radii. If they are tangent externally, the distance is equal to the sum. In this case, the smaller semicircle is inside the main circle, so it must be tangent internally. Therefore, the distance between Q (which is the center of the main circle) and the center of the semicircle (which is at (r, r)) should be equal to 14 - r.

Okay, so let's compute the distance between (0, 0) and (r, r). Using the distance formula, that's sqrt[(r - 0)² + (r - 0)²] = sqrt(r² + r²) = sqrt(2r²) = r√2.

So, according to the tangent condition, this distance should be equal to 14 - r. So, we have:

r√2 = 14 - r

Let me write that equation down:

r√2 + r = 14

Factor out r:

r(√2 + 1) = 14

Therefore, solving for r:

r = 14 / (√2 + 1)

But we need to rationalize the denominator, right? Multiply numerator and denominator by (√2 - 1):

r = [14(√2 - 1)] / [(√2 + 1)(√2 - 1)] = [14(√2 - 1)] / (2 - 1) = 14(√2 - 1) / 1 = 14(√2 - 1)

Wait a second, that can't be right. Because 14(√2 - 1) is approximately 14(1.414 - 1) = 14(0.414) ≈ 5.8 inches. But the main circle has a radius of 14 inches, and the semicircle is inside it. So, 5.8 inches is plausible, but let me check if I did everything correctly.

Wait, the equation was r√2 = 14 - r, which led to r(√2 + 1) = 14, so r = 14 / (√2 + 1), which after rationalization is 14(√2 - 1). But 14(√2 - 1) is approximately 14*(0.414) ≈ 5.8 inches, which is less than 14, so that's fine.

But wait, is that the radius of the semicircle? Let me think again. The distance from Q to the center of the semicircle is r√2, and since it's tangent internally, this distance should be equal to 14 - r. So, yes, that equation seems correct.

Wait, but hold on. The center of the semicircle is at (r, r), but the semicircle is tangent to the main circle. So, the distance between the centers is equal to 14 - r, which is correct.

But let me verify this with another approach. Maybe by considering the coordinates of the semicircle.

So, the semicircle is centered at (r, r) with radius r. The equation of the semicircle would be (x - r)² + (y - r)² = r², but since it's a semicircle, I suppose it's only the part that's in the first quadrant? Wait, no, because the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles in the corners. So, actually, each semicircle is in one of the four corners formed by the radii, but in this case, since AQ and BQ are forming a right angle, the two smaller regions are in the corner near A and the corner near B? Or maybe both in the same corner?

Wait, the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." Since AQ and BQ form a right angle, the sector AQB is 90 degrees, and within that sector, there are two smaller regions, each being a semicircle. So, maybe each semicircle is in one of the two smaller regions? Wait, perhaps each semicircle is tangent to both radii and the arc of the main circle.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as two semicircles, each sitting in the corner formed by AQ and BQ, but also tangent to the main circle. So, each semicircle is in one of the two quadrants formed by AQ and BQ. But since AQ and BQ are perpendicular, they divide the circle into four quadrants, but the two smaller regions are probably each in two of these quadrants.

Wait, hold on. The problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." So, the main circle is divided by AQ and BQ into four regions, but the two smaller ones are each semicircles. Hmm, perhaps each semicircle is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle. So, each semicircle is inside the main circle, in one of the two smaller regions formed by the radii.

Wait, maybe the two semicircles are in the two smaller regions, each lying in a 45-degree sector. Hmm, but without the figure, it's a bit challenging, but let me try to proceed.

Given that, perhaps each semicircle has its diameter lying along one of the radii, but that seems unlikely since they are tangent semicircles.

Wait, another approach. If the semicircles are tangent to each other and to the sides AQ and BQ, and also tangent to the main circle, then each semicircle is in a corner formed by AQ and BQ.

Wait, let me think in terms of coordinates again. If the center of the semicircle is at (r, r), then the distance from Q (0,0) to (r, r) is r√2, which is equal to 14 - r, as we had before. So, solving for r gives us 14/(√2 + 1) which simplifies to 14(√2 - 1). So, approximately 5.8 inches. That seems to make sense.

Wait, but let me think again about the positioning. If the semicircle is tangent to both AQ and BQ, which are the x-axis and y-axis, then its center must be at (r, r). Then, it's also tangent to the main circle, so the distance from (0,0) to (r, r) is equal to 14 - r, as the semicircle is inside the main circle. So, that equation should hold.

Alternatively, if the semicircle were outside, we would have the distance equal to 14 + r, but in this case, it's inside, so 14 - r.

So, with that in mind, solving r√2 = 14 - r gives r = 14/(√2 + 1), which is equal to 14(√2 - 1) inches after rationalizing.

Wait, but 14(√2 - 1) is approximately 14*(1.4142 - 1) = 14*(0.4142) ≈ 5.8 inches, which is less than 14, so that seems fine.

But let me just confirm. If the radius is 14(√2 - 1), then the center is at (14(√2 - 1), 14(√2 - 1)). Let me compute the distance from the origin to this center:

sqrt[(14(√2 - 1))² + (14(√2 - 1))²] = sqrt[2*(14)²*(√2 - 1)²] = 14*(√2 - 1)*sqrt(2) = 14*(√2 - 1)*√2.

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me compute it step by step:

First, (14(√2 - 1))² = 14²*(√2 - 1)² = 196*( (√2)² - 2√2 + 1 ) = 196*(2 - 2√2 + 1) = 196*(3 - 2√2)

Then, adding the two identical terms:

196*(3 - 2√2) + 196*(3 - 2√2) = 2*196*(3 - 2√2) = 392*(3 - 2√2)

Then, taking the square root:

sqrt(392*(3 - 2√2)) = sqrt(392)*sqrt(3 - 2√2). Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, actually, if the center is at (r, r), then the distance from (0,0) to (r, r) is r√2. And we set that equal to 14 - r. So, that equation is r√2 = 14 - r, which is straightforward.

So, solving for r:

r√2 + r = 14

r(√2 + 1) = 14

r = 14 / (√2 + 1)

Then, rationalizing:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (√2 - 1):

r = [14*(√2 - 1)] / [ (√2 + 1)(√2 - 1) ] = [14*(√2 - 1)] / (2 - 1) = 14*(√2 - 1)

So, r = 14(√2 - 1). But let me compute this value to check if it's reasonable.

√2 ≈ 1.4142, so √2 - 1 ≈ 0.4142

Thus, r ≈ 14 * 0.4142 ≈ 5.8 inches.

Since the main circle has a radius of 14 inches, 5.8 inches is indeed smaller, so that's plausible.

Wait, but the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." So, does each of these semicircles have the same radius? Because if so, then each semicircle would have radius 14(√2 - 1). But the question asks for the radius of the smaller semicircle, implying that there are two, but they are both the same size, so maybe that's correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. If there are two semicircles, each with radius 14(√2 - 1), that would mean each is quite substantial, but let's see. The diameter of each would be 28(√2 - 1) ≈ 11.6 inches, which is less than the radius of the main circle, so that seems fine.

Wait, but another thought: if each semicircle is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, then they should both have the same radius, so the answer is 14(√2 - 1). But the problem says "the radius of the smaller semicircle," so if there are two semicircles, both of which are tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, then they are congruent, so both have the same radius.

But let me think again if I interpreted the problem correctly. It says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." So, the two regions each are a semicircle. So, maybe each semicircle is in one of the two smaller regions, each of which is bounded by AQ, BQ, and the main circle.

Therefore, in each of the two smaller regions (each a 45-degree sector), there is a semicircle. So, each semicircle is in one of the two smaller regions, each with radius r.

So, the center of each semicircle is located at (r, r) and (-r, r), but since the figure is in the first quadrant, only (r, r) is relevant. So, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the radius is 14(√2 - 1). But let me compute this more precisely.

14*(√2 - 1) = 14√2 - 14.

But to write it as a common fraction, we can rationalize 14/(√2 + 1) as 14(√2 - 1)/ ( (√2 + 1)(√2 - 1) ) = 14(√2 - 1)/1 = 14√2 - 14. But this is an expression, not a fraction.

Wait, the problem says "Express your answer as a common fraction." So, perhaps 14(√2 - 1) is not a common fraction. Hmm, that is confusing.

Wait, but 14(√2 - 1) is an exact expression, but as a common fraction, maybe it's 14(√2 - 1). But √2 is irrational, so it can't be expressed as a common fraction. Hmm, so perhaps I did something wrong in the process.

Wait, let me go back. Maybe the problem is not about two semicircles, but about two quarter-circles or something else. Wait, no, it says "two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." So, each is a semicircle, so each has a diameter, but the diameter is not along the radius but perhaps along the arc.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the two smaller regions are each formed by a semicircle whose diameter lies along the main circle's radius. So, each semicircle is inside the main circle, with their diameters being parts of AQ and BQ.

Wait, but the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." So, maybe each semicircle is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, but they are in the two smaller regions.

Wait, perhaps the two semicircles are each in their own smaller regions, each with their own radius, but the problem is asking for the radius of the smaller semicircle. So, maybe one is smaller than the other? But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps they are congruent.

Alternatively, maybe the two semicircles are congruent, each with radius r, and the question is just asking for that r.

So, given that, I think my previous approach is correct. So, solving for r:

r√2 = 14 - r

r(√2 + 1) = 14

r = 14 / (√2 + 1) = 14(√2 - 1) after rationalization.

But since the question asks for the radius as a common fraction, perhaps 14(√2 - 1) is acceptable, but it's not a fraction. Alternatively, maybe I need to rationalize it differently.

Wait, but 14(√2 - 1) is a simplified form, but perhaps it's necessary to present it as 14(√2 - 1)/1, but that's not a common fraction. Maybe the problem expects just 14/(√2 + 1), but rationalized. Hmm, 14(√2 - 1) is a common expression, but is that considered a common fraction?

Wait, perhaps I need to write it as a fraction with numerator and denominator as integers. But since √2 is irrational, it can't be expressed as a fraction with integers. So, maybe the problem is expecting to write 14/(√2 + 1), but rationalized, so 14(√2 - 1). Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equation.

Wait, let me think again. The distance from Q to the center of the semicircle is r√2, and since the semicircle is tangent to the main circle, the distance between centers is 14 - r. So, equation is r√2 = 14 - r. Solving for r:

r√2 + r = 14

r(√2 + 1) = 14

r = 14 / (√2 + 1) = 14(√2 - 1) / ( (√2 + 1)(√2 - 1) ) = 14(√2 - 1)/1 = 14√2 - 14

Wait, but 14√2 - 14 is approximately 14*1.4142 - 14 ≈ 19.7988 - 14 ≈ 5.7988 inches, which is about 5.8 inches, as before.

But the problem asks for the radius expressed as a common fraction. Since 14√2 - 14 is not a common fraction, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.

Wait, maybe the two smaller regions are each a semicircle, and perhaps each is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the arc AB. So, each is a semicircle in the corner, but they may not be tangent to the main circle's center.

Wait, perhaps the main circle's center is Q, and the two smaller semicircles are each tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle. So, each semicircle is in a corner, and the centers are located somewhere else.

Wait, let me clarify the figure. If AQ and BQ are radii forming a right angle, then the main circle is divided into four quadrants. The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles. Maybe these semicircles are each in two of the four quadrants. So, each semicircle is in a quadrant, tangent to the two sides (AQ and BQ) and also tangent to the main circle.

If that's the case, then each semicircle is in a corner, with its diameter lying along the main circle's radius. Wait, but if the diameter is along the radius, then the radius of the semicircle would be half the main radius. But the main radius is 14, so the semicircle would have radius 7 inches. But that can't be, because the two smaller regions would each have radius 7, but the problem says "the smaller semicircle," implying that there are two, and it's asking for the radius of the smaller one, so perhaps both are equal.

Alternatively, maybe each semicircle is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, but not necessarily lying along the main circle's radius. So, their centers are somewhere else.

Wait, given that, let me try to model it again.

Let me denote the center of the semicircle as point C, which is at (r, r) because it's equidistant from AQ and BQ. Then, the distance from Q (0,0) to C (r, r) is sqrt(r² + r²) = r√2. Since the semicircle is tangent to the main circle, the distance between centers is equal to the difference of their radii, which is 14 - r. Therefore:

r√2 = 14 - r

Which is the same equation as before, leading to r = 14 / (√2 + 1) = 14(√2 - 1). So, this seems correct.

Therefore, the radius is 14(√2 - 1), which is approximately 5.8 inches.

But since the problem asks for a common fraction, and 14(√2 - 1) is already simplified, but it's not a common fraction because of the √2. Maybe the problem expects a fractional form with radicals, so 14(√2 - 1) is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in interpretation. Maybe the two smaller regions are semicircles whose diameters are chords of the main circle, not along the radii.

Wait, let me think. If the two smaller regions are semicircles, each lying in a quadrant formed by AQ and BQ, and each semicircle is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle.

In that case, the center of each semicircle would be at (r, r), as before. The distance from Q to the center is r√2, and the distance from the center to the main circle is 14 - r. So, same equation:

r√2 = 14 - r

So, same result, r = 14(√2 - 1). So, that seems consistent.

Therefore, perhaps the answer is 14(√2 - 1), which can be written as 14√2 - 14. But the problem says "Express your answer as a common fraction." Hmm, since √2 is irrational, it cannot be expressed as a common fraction, so maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the two semicircles are not placed in the same corner but in different corners. So, perhaps each semicircle is in a different smaller region, each in a different quadrant. So, each has radius r, and the centers are located at (r, r) and (-r, -r), but that would complicate things.

Wait, but in that case, the distance between the centers would be sqrt[(r + r)^2 + (r + r)^2] = sqrt[(2r)^2 + (2r)^2] = sqrt(8r²) = 2r√2. But since they're both tangent to the main circle, each is at a distance of 14 - r from Q. So, the distance between their centers would be 2*(14 - r). Therefore:

2*(14 - r) = 2r√2

Simplify:

14 - r = r√2

14 = r√2 + r

14 = r(√2 + 1)

r = 14 / (√2 + 1) = 14(√2 - 1)

Same result as before. So, regardless of how I model it, I get r = 14(√2 - 1). So, that's about 5.8 inches.

But the problem says "Express your answer as a common fraction." Hmm, maybe the question is expecting 14/(√2 + 1), but rationalized, so 14(√2 - 1). But that's not a fraction, it's an expression.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting a fractional value in terms of the radius, so 14/(√2 + 1). But if we rationalize it, it's 14(√2 - 1). So, maybe 14(√2 - 1) is the answer, and it's acceptable as a common fraction with radicals.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption about where the semicircle is located. Maybe the semicircle is not centered at (r, r), but somewhere else.

Wait, let me think differently. Suppose the semicircle is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle. So, the semicircle is in the corner formed by AQ and BQ, but its diameter is not along the radius, but instead, it's lying along a tangent.

Wait, no, in that case, the center would still be equidistant from AQ and BQ, so at (r, r). The distance from the center to Q is r√2, which is equal to 14 - r, giving the same equation.

So, I think my approach is correct.

Wait, but since the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles," maybe each semicircle is in a different smaller region, but each with the same radius. So, their radii are both 14(√2 - 1). So, the answer is 14(√2 - 1) inches.

But in the problem statement, it's mentioned as "the smaller semicircle," so maybe there are two semicircles with different radii, but the smaller one's radius is what's being asked.

Wait, but if both are tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, they should have the same radius.

Alternatively, perhaps the two semicircles are in the two smaller regions, each being a quarter-circle, but the problem says semicircles, so they must each span 180 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the two smaller regions are each semicircular, but not overlapping. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to calculate the radius using a different method. Let me consider the coordinates again. Let me denote the center of the semicircle as (a, a). The semicircle is tangent to AQ (x-axis) and BQ (y-axis), so the distance from (a, a) to both axes is a, so the radius r is a.

The semicircle is also tangent to the main circle centered at (0,0) with radius 14. The distance between (0,0) and (a, a) is sqrt(a² + a²) = a√2. Since the semicircle is inside the main circle, the distance from (0,0) to (a, a) is equal to 14 - r, which is 14 - a.

Therefore, a√2 = 14 - a.

Solving for a:

a√2 + a = 14

a(√2 + 1) = 14

a = 14 / (√2 + 1) = 14(√2 - 1) inches.

So, that's consistent with my previous result.

Therefore, the radius of the smaller semicircle is 14(√2 - 1) inches.

But the problem asks for the answer as a common fraction. Hmm, 14(√2 - 1) is approximately 5.8 inches, but as a common fraction, is this acceptable? Or perhaps I need to write it as 14(√2 - 1) over 1, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the problem expects an answer in terms of a fraction multiplied by (√2 - 1), so 14(√2 - 1) is the simplified form.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again:

"In the circle with center Q, radii AQ and BQ form a right angle. The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, as shown. The radius of the circle with center Q is 14 inches. What is the radius of the smaller semicircle? Express your answer as a common fraction."

Hmm, perhaps the two smaller regions are each a semicircle, and the problem is asking for the radius of the smaller one. So, perhaps both semicircles are equal, so the radius is 14(√2 - 1).

Alternatively, maybe the two smaller regions are each semicircles with different radii, but that seems unlikely because AQ and BQ form a right angle, so symmetry suggests both would have the same radius.

Thus, I think the answer is 14(√2 - 1), which is approximately 5.8 inches, and in exact terms, it's 14(√2 - 1). Since the problem asks for a common fraction, and 14(√2 - 1) is the exact value, I think that's the answer.

Wait, but 14(√2 - 1) is a multiple of (√2 - 1), which is an irrational number, so it can't be expressed as a simple fraction. Therefore, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of a fraction with radicals, so I should write it as 14(√2 - 1). But the problem says "as a common fraction," which usually refers to a rational number expressed as a fraction. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial equation. Let me try another approach.

Suppose the radius is r. The center of the semicircle is at (r, r). The distance from (r, r) to Q is r√2. Since the semicircle is tangent to the main circle, the distance between centers is 14 - r.

So, r√2 = 14 - r

So, same equation. Solving this gives r = 14 / (√2 + 1) = 14(√2 - 1). So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe the two smaller regions are each a semicircle whose diameter is the arc AB, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another thought: The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, each lying in the two smaller regions formed by AQ and BQ. So, each semicircle is in a different smaller region, each with radius r. Therefore, the total area of the two semicircles would be 2*(1/2 π r²) = π r². But maybe that's not necessary.

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the radius, not the area. So, perhaps the answer is indeed 14(√2 - 1), which is approximately 5.8 inches.

But given the problem asks for a common fraction, and 14(√2 - 1) is not a common fraction, maybe I need to present it differently. Wait, perhaps 14(√2 - 1) can be expressed as (14√2 - 14)/1, but that's still not a common fraction.

Wait, maybe 14(√2 - 1) is acceptable as a common fraction with radicals. Since the problem didn't specify that it's a rational number, just a common fraction, which can include radicals.

Therefore, I think the answer is 14(√2 - 1). So, to write it as a common fraction, I can write it as 14√2 - 14, but it's still not a single fractional term. Alternatively, since 14 is a common factor, perhaps it can be written as 14(√2 - 1), which is a single term.

So, given that, I think the answer is 14(√2 - 1), which can be expressed as 14√2 - 14, but since the problem asks for a common fraction, I think 14(√2 - 1) is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe I did something wrong in the initial setup, and the answer is simply 14/2 = 7 inches, but that seems too big for the smaller semicircle.

Wait, if the radius was 7 inches, then the center would be at (7,7), and the distance from (0,0) would be 7√2 ≈ 9.899, which is less than 14, so the semicircle would indeed be inside the main circle. But the problem states that the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, so if they were both 7 inches, the regions would be pretty big, but perhaps that's the case.

Wait, but if I plug r = 7 into the equation:

r√2 = 14 - r

7√2 ≈ 9.899 = 14 - 7 = 7

But 9.899 ≈ 7 is not true. So, that's not correct. So, 7 is not the solution.

Therefore, my initial equation is correct, leading to r = 14(√2 - 1). So, perhaps that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I need to represent it as a fraction with denominator rationalized, so 14(√2 - 1)/1, but that's still not a fraction.

Wait, maybe the problem expects a fractional value in terms of pi or something else, but the problem just says to express it as a common fraction, so probably not.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the two smaller regions are semicircles whose diameters are the radii AQ and BQ. So, each semicircle would have a diameter of 14 inches, so radius 7 inches. But that seems too big for the smaller regions. Also, 7 inches is about half of 14 inches, so that would make the smaller regions not smaller.

Alternatively, if the two smaller regions are each semicircles with diameter along AQ and BQ, but that seems inconsistent with the problem statement.

Wait, given that, I think my initial approach is correct, so the radius is 14(√2 - 1). So, perhaps that's the answer.

But, to make sure, let me think about the problem again. The main circle has radius 14, and the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles. The two smaller regions are in the two smaller regions formed by AQ and BQ, each a quarter-circle. So, each smaller region is a quarter-circle with radius 14, but if each is a semicircle, then the radius would be smaller.

Wait, perhaps the two smaller regions are each a semicircle whose diameter is the arc AB, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the two smaller regions are each a semicircle whose diameter is the segment from the main circle's circumference to the point where the semicircle is tangent.

Wait, this is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to think in terms of the initial equation.

r√2 = 14 - r

So, solving for r:

r = 14 / (√2 + 1) = 14(√2 - 1)

So, that is approximately 5.8 inches. Therefore, I think that is the correct answer, even though it's not a rational number. Maybe the problem allows for an answer with radicals.

So, the radius of the smaller semicircle is 14(√2 - 1) inches.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{14(\sqrt{2} - 1)}.

Wait, but the problem says to express it as a common fraction, and 14(√2 - 1) is not a common fraction. Hmm. Maybe the problem is expecting a fractional form with a rational denominator, but 14(√2 - 1) is already rationalized. So, maybe that's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps 14(√2 - 1) can be written as (14√2 - 14)/1, but that's still not a fraction. Alternatively, maybe it's 14√2 - 14, which is an expression but not a single fraction.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer written as 14/(√2 + 1), but rationalized, it's 14(√2 - 1). So, perhaps that's acceptable as a common fraction.

Wait, in conclusion, after multiple approaches and checks, I think the radius of the smaller semicircle is 14(√2 - 1) inches. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the smaller semicircle is \boxed{14(\sqrt{2} - 1)} inches.

Given a circle with center \( Q \) and radii \( AQ \) and \( BQ \) forming a right angle, we need to find the radius of the smaller semicircles that are tangent to each other and the main circle. The radius of the main circle is 14 inches.

1. The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, each lying in the smaller regions formed by the radii \( AQ \) and \( BQ \).
2. The center of each semicircle is equidistant from \( AQ \) and \( BQ \), so it lies on the line \( y = x \) if we consider \( Q \) at the origin.
3. Let the radius of the smaller semicircle be \( r \). The center of the semicircle is at \( (r, r) \).
4. The distance from the center \( Q \) to the center of the semicircle is \( \sqrt{(r)^2 + (r)^2} = r\sqrt{2} \).
5. Since the semicircle is tangent to the main circle, the distance from \( Q \) to the center of the semicircle is equal to the difference of their radii, which is \( 14 - r \).
6. Setting up the equation: \( r\sqrt{2} = 14 - r \).
7. Solving for \( r \):
   \[
   r\sqrt{2} + r = 14
   \]
   \[
   r(\sqrt{2} + 1) = 14
   \]
   \[
   r = \frac{14}{\sqrt{2} + 1}
   \]
8. Rationalizing the denominator:
   \[
   r = \frac{14}{\sqrt{2} + 1} \times \frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{\sqrt{2} - 1} = 14(\sqrt{2} - 1)
   \]

Thus, the radius of the smaller semicircle is \(\boxed{14(\sqrt{2} - 1)}\) inches.
