Question:
In the diagram below, we have $\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}$.  What is $\cos \angle RPS$?

[asy]

pair R,P,Q,SS;

SS = (-2,0);

P = (0,0);

Q = (2,0);

R = rotate(aSin(7/25))*(1.5,0);

dot("$S$",SS,S);

dot("$Q$",Q,S);

dot("$R$",R,N);

dot("$P$",P,S);

draw(Q--SS);

draw(P--R);

[/asy]

Correct Answer:
For any angle $x$, we have $\cos(180^\circ - x)=-\cos x$, so $\cos \angle RPS = \cos(180^\circ - \angle RPQ) =- \cos\angle RPQ$.

Since $\sin^2 \angle RPQ + \cos^2 \angle RPQ = 1$, we have $\cos^2\angle RPQ = 1 - \left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 = \frac{576}{625}$.  Since $\angle RPQ$ is acute, we have $\cos\angle RPQ = \frac{24}{25}$, which gives us $\cos\angle RPS = -\cos\angle RPQ = \boxed{-\frac{24}{25}}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says that in the diagram, sin(angle RPQ) is 7/25, and I need to find cos(angle RPS). Hmm, let me try to visualize the diagram first because sometimes the Asymptote code can be a bit tricky to interpret.

Looking at the Asymptote code, it defines points R, P, Q, and S. S is at (-2,0), Q is at (2,0), P is at (0,0), and R is somewhere else. They used the rotate function with asin(7/25) on the point (1.5,0). So, point R is obtained by rotating the point (1.5,0) around the origin by an angle whose sine is 7/25. That should place R somewhere in the upper half-plane since the rotation is by an angle with positive sine.

So, the figure is a bit like this: points S and Q are on the x-axis, with P at the origin. R is somewhere above the x-axis connected to P, and S is connected to Q and P. So, triangle RPS is formed with points R, P, S, and Q.

Wait, actually, the Asymptote code draws Q to S and P to R. So, maybe the figure is a quadrilateral? Or maybe two triangles? Hmm, not sure, but maybe I can just focus on the angles given.

The problem mentions angles RPQ and RPS. So angle RPQ is at point P, between points R, P, and Q. Similarly, angle RPS is at point P, between points R, P, and S. So both angles share the sides PR and PS or PQ? Wait, no. RPQ is angle at P between R and Q, so that's angle QPR. And RPS is the angle at P between R and S, so that's angle SPR.

So, the two angles share the side PR but have different other sides: one is PQ and the other is PS.

Given that sin(angle RPQ) is 7/25, which is sin(angle QPR) = 7/25.

So, in triangle PQR, angle at P is angle QPR with sine 7/25. Then, I need to find cosine of angle RPS, which is the angle at P between PR and PS.

Wait, but I don't know much about triangle PRS. Hmm. Maybe I can figure out some relationships between the triangles.

First, let's consider triangle PQR. In triangle PQR, angle at P is angle QPR, with sine 7/25. So, sine of angle QPR is opposite over hypotenuse. But wait, in triangle PQR, is PR the hypotenuse? Wait, triangle PQR: points P, Q, R. So, sides are PQ, PR, and QR.

Wait, actually, in triangle PQR, angle at P is between sides PQ and PR, so PR is one side, PQ is another, and QR is the third side. So, if angle at P has sine 7/25, then the side opposite to angle QPR is QR, and the hypotenuse would be... Wait, no, in triangle PQR, angle at P is not a right angle, so we can't assume hypotenuse.

Wait, maybe I should draw a right triangle somewhere. Since we are given sine of an angle, perhaps we can model that.

Alternatively, maybe I can assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Let's see.

Given that in the Asymptote code, R is obtained by rotating (1.5,0) by asin(7/25). So, the rotation angle theta has sin(theta) = 7/25. Therefore, cos(theta) would be sqrt(1 - (7/25)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/625) = sqrt(576/625) = 24/25. So, cos(theta) is 24/25.

So, when we rotate the point (1.5,0) by theta, we get R. The rotation matrix is:

x' = x cos(theta) - y sin(theta)

y' = x sin(theta) + y cos(theta)

So, plugging in (1.5, 0):

x' = 1.5 * (24/25) - 0 * (7/25) = (36/25)

y' = 1.5 * (7/25) + 0 * (24/25) = (21/25)

So, point R is at (36/25, 21/25).

So, R is at (1.44, 0.84). Let me note that.

Points P, Q, S are on the x-axis at (0,0), (2,0), (-2,0) respectively.

So, PR is the line from (0,0) to (1.44, 0.84). PQ is from (0,0) to (2,0). PS is from (0,0) to (-2,0).

We need to find cos(angle RPS), which is the angle at P between PR and PS.

So, in other words, angle between vectors PR and PS.

Since we have coordinates, maybe we can compute the vectors and then use the dot product formula to find the cosine of the angle between them.

Yes, that sounds like a solid plan.

So, vector PR is R - P, which is (1.44, 0.84) - (0,0) = (1.44, 0.84).

Vector PS is S - P, which is (-2,0) - (0,0) = (-2, 0).

So, vectors PR = (1.44, 0.84) and PS = (-2, 0).

The cosine of the angle between them is given by the dot product divided by the product of their magnitudes.

So, cos(theta) = (PR . PS) / (|PR| |PS|)

First, compute the dot product:

PR . PS = (1.44)(-2) + (0.84)(0) = (-2.88) + 0 = -2.88

Now, compute |PR|:

|PR| = sqrt(1.44^2 + 0.84^2) = sqrt(2.0736 + 0.7056) = sqrt(2.7792)

Let me compute that:

2.7792 is approximately 2.7792, let's see:

sqrt(2.7792) ≈ 1.667, but let me do it more accurately.

Wait, 1.44^2 is 2.0736, 0.84^2 is 0.7056, so sum is 2.7792.

Compute sqrt(2.7792):

Well, 1.66^2 is 2.7556, which is close. 1.66^2 = (1.6 + 0.06)^2 = 2.56 + 0.192 + 0.0036 = 2.7556.

2.7792 - 2.7556 = 0.0236.

So, sqrt(2.7792) ≈ 1.66 + (0.0236)/(2*1.66) ≈ 1.66 + 0.0236/3.32 ≈ 1.66 + 0.0071 ≈ 1.6671.

So, |PR| ≈ 1.6671.

|PS| is the magnitude of vector (-2,0), which is 2.

So, cos(theta) = (-2.88) / (1.6671 * 2) ≈ (-2.88) / (3.3342) ≈ -0.864.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

First, 1.44 * (-2) is -2.88, yes.

|PR|: 1.44^2 = 2.0736, 0.84^2 = 0.7056, so 2.0736 + 0.7056 = 2.7792.

sqrt(2.7792). Let's compute it precisely.

Let me see, 1.66^2 is 2.7556, as I did before.

1.667^2 = (1.66 + 0.007)^2 = 1.66^2 + 2*1.66*0.007 + 0.007^2 = 2.7556 + 0.02324 + 0.000049 ≈ 2.778889.

Which is very close to 2.7792.

So, sqrt(2.7792) ≈ 1.667 approximately.

Therefore, |PR| ≈ 1.667, |PS| = 2.

So, cos(theta) ≈ (-2.88)/(1.667 * 2) ≈ (-2.88)/3.334 ≈ -0.864.

But let me compute it more accurately:

Compute numerator: -2.88

Denominator: 1.667 * 2 = 3.334

So, -2.88 / 3.334 ≈

Let me do this division: 2.88 / 3.334.

Well, 3.334 goes into 2.88 approximately 0.864 times because 3.334 * 0.864 ≈ 3.334 * 0.8 = 2.6672, 3.334 * 0.064 ≈ 0.213, so total ≈ 2.6672 + 0.213 ≈ 2.8802. So, 3.334 * 0.864 ≈ 2.8802, so 2.88 / 3.334 ≈ 0.864. Therefore, -2.88 / 3.334 ≈ -0.864.

So, cos(theta) ≈ -0.864.

But let's see if we can express this as a fraction.

Wait, 2.88 is equal to 288/100, which simplifies to 72/25.

Similarly, 3.334 is approximately 3334/1000, which simplifies to 1667/500.

So, cos(theta) = (-72/25) / (1667/500) = (-72/25) * (500/1667) = (-72 * 20) / 1667 = (-1440)/1667.

Wait, 500 divided by 25 is 20, so 72 * 20 is 1440. So, yeah, cos(theta) = -1440/1667.

Wait, but 1440 and 1667, do they have any common factors?

1667 divided by 1440 is approximately 1.146, so let's see if 1667 is a prime number or if it can be factored.

1667 ÷ 7 = 238.14... Not integer.

1667 ÷ 13 = 128.23... Not integer.

Wait, 1667, let me check. 1667 ÷ 17 ≈ 98.05... Not integer.

Wait, 1667 is actually a prime number? Hmm, 1667 ÷ 23 ≈ 72.478... Not integer.

So, maybe 1440 and 1667 have no common factors, so the fraction is -1440/1667.

But that seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the coordinates.

Wait, because in the Asymptote code, R is obtained by rotating (1.5, 0) by asin(7/25). So, (1.5, 0) is a point 1.5 units along the x-axis. When we rotate it by angle theta, where sin(theta) = 7/25, then the coordinates are (1.5*cos(theta), 1.5*sin(theta)).

Wait, hold on, in the rotation matrix, the point (x,y) rotated by theta becomes (x cos(theta) - y sin(theta), x sin(theta) + y cos(theta)). So, in this case, x = 1.5, y = 0. So, it becomes (1.5 cos(theta), 1.5 sin(theta)).

So, R is at (1.5*(24/25), 1.5*(7/25)) = (36/25, 21/25). So, (1.44, 0.84). So, that's correct.

So, vector PR is (36/25, 21/25), and vector PS is (-2, 0).

So, let's compute the dot product:

PR . PS = (36/25)*(-2) + (21/25)*(0) = (-72/25) + 0 = -72/25.

The magnitude of PR is sqrt( (36/25)^2 + (21/25)^2 ) = sqrt( (1296/625) + (441/625) ) = sqrt(1737/625) = sqrt(1737)/25.

Wait, 1737 divided by 625 is 2.7792, which is what I had before. So, sqrt(1737)/25 is approximately 1.667, as before.

So, |PR| = sqrt(1737)/25, |PS| = 2.

Therefore, cos(theta) = ( -72/25 ) / ( sqrt(1737)/25 * 2 ) = (-72/25) / (2 sqrt(1737)/25 ) = (-72)/ (2 sqrt(1737)) ) = (-36)/sqrt(1737).

Simplify sqrt(1737). Let's factor 1737:

1737 ÷ 3 = 579

579 ÷ 3 = 193

193 is a prime number (since it's not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11,13,17; 17^2 is 289 which is more than 193). So, sqrt(1737) = sqrt(3*3*193) = 3 sqrt(193).

So, sqrt(1737) = 3 sqrt(193). Therefore, cos(theta) = (-36)/(3 sqrt(193)) = (-12)/sqrt(193).

We can rationalize the denominator:

(-12)/sqrt(193) = (-12 sqrt(193))/193.

So, cos(theta) = (-12 sqrt(193))/193.

But let me check if that's correct.

Wait, earlier, I had:

cos(theta) = (-72/25) / ( (sqrt(1737)/25 ) * 2 )

= (-72/25) / (2 sqrt(1737)/25 )

= (-72)/2 sqrt(1737)

= (-36)/sqrt(1737)

= (-36)/(3 sqrt(193)) [since 1737 = 9*193]

= (-12)/sqrt(193)

= (-12 sqrt(193))/193.

Yes, that seems correct.

But let me think, is this the correct approach? Because I used coordinates to compute the angle between PR and PS.

But in the problem, angle RPQ is given as sin(theta) = 7/25.

Wait, angle RPQ is at point P, between R, P, Q, so that is angle QPR. So, in triangle PQR, angle at P is theta, with sin(theta) = 7/25.

Therefore, in triangle PQR, we can reconstruct that triangle.

Wait, maybe I can use the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle PQR to find the sides, and then use that information to find cos(angle RPS).

But since I have coordinates, maybe the coordinate method is more straightforward, but perhaps let's see another way.

In triangle PQR, angle at P has sine 7/25, so the opposite side QR would be related to the hypotenuse, but wait, triangle PQR isn't necessarily a right triangle.

So, if I can find the lengths of sides PQ, PR, and QR, then I can apply the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines.

Given that PQ is from (0,0) to (2,0), so length PQ is 2 units.

PR is from (0,0) to (36/25, 21/25), so length PR is sqrt( (36/25)^2 + (21/25)^2 ) = sqrt(1296 + 441)/25 = sqrt(1737)/25, as before.

QR is from (2,0) to (36/25, 21/25). Let's compute that distance.

Difference in x: 36/25 - 2 = 36/25 - 50/25 = (-14)/25

Difference in y: 21/25 - 0 = 21/25

So, QR has length sqrt( (-14/25)^2 + (21/25)^2 ) = sqrt(196 + 441)/25 = sqrt(637)/25.

So, sides:

PQ = 2

PR = sqrt(1737)/25 ≈ 1.667

QR = sqrt(637)/25 ≈ 0.808

Wait, let me compute sqrt(637). 25^2 is 625, so sqrt(637) is a bit more than 25.14.

Wait, no, sqrt(637) is sqrt(625 + 12) = 25 + 12/(2*25) approximately, so 25 + 0.24 = 25.24. So, sqrt(637)/25 ≈ 25.24/25 ≈ 1.0096. Wait, that can't be right because QR is from (2,0) to (1.44, 0.84). The x difference is 2 - 1.44 = 0.56, y difference is 0.84. So, distance is sqrt(0.56^2 + 0.84^2). 0.56^2 is 0.3136, 0.84^2 is 0.7056, so total is 1.0192, so sqrt(1.0192) ≈ 1.0095. So, QR ≈ 1.0095. But in our earlier calculation, QR was sqrt(637)/25, which is sqrt(637)/25. Since sqrt(637) is about 25.24, so 25.24/25 ≈ 1.0096. So, that matches. So, QR ≈ 1.0096.

So, in triangle PQR, sides are PQ = 2, PR ≈ 1.667, QR ≈ 1.0096.

Now, angle at P is theta, with sin(theta) = 7/25.

We can use the Law of Sines on triangle PQR:

sin(theta)/QR = sin(angle PQR)/PR = sin(angle PRQ)/PQ

But maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates, maybe we can find vectors PR and PS, compute their dot product, and get the cosine of the angle between them, which is angle RPS.

Wait, that's what I did earlier, giving me cos(theta) = (-12 sqrt(193))/193.

But let me see if that's correct.

Wait, in the coordinate system, point S is at (-2,0), so vector PS is (-2,0). Vector PR is (36/25, 21/25). So, yes, the dot product is (36/25)*(-2) + (21/25)*(0) = -72/25.

The magnitude of PR is sqrt( (36/25)^2 + (21/25)^2 ) = sqrt(1296 + 441)/25 = sqrt(1737)/25.

So, |PR| = sqrt(1737)/25, |PS| = 2.

Thus, cos(theta) = (-72/25) / (sqrt(1737)/25 * 2 ) = (-72)/ (2 sqrt(1737)) = (-36)/sqrt(1737).

Then, sqrt(1737) is sqrt(9*193) = 3 sqrt(193), so cos(theta) = (-36)/(3 sqrt(193)) = (-12)/sqrt(193) = (-12 sqrt(193))/193.

So, yes, that seems correct.

But let me check if I can get it another way.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates, compute the angle RPS.

Point R is at (36/25, 21/25), point P is at (0,0), point S is at (-2,0).

So, angle at P between R and S.

Wait, so in terms of coordinates, we can think of lines PR and PS.

PR is from P(0,0) to R(36/25, 21/25). So, direction vector is (36/25, 21/25).

PS is from P(0,0) to S(-2,0). So, direction vector is (-2,0).

So, the angle between (36/25, 21/25) and (-2,0).

Which is exactly what I did before.

So, the dot product is (36/25)*(-2) + (21/25)*(0) = -72/25.

Lengths are sqrt( (36/25)^2 + (21/25)^2 ) = sqrt(1737)/25 and 2.

So, yes, same as before.

So, cos(theta) = (-72/25) / ( sqrt(1737)/25 * 2 ) = (-72)/ (2 sqrt(1737)) = (-36)/sqrt(1737) = (-12)/sqrt(193) = (-12 sqrt(193))/193.

So, that's approximately -0.864, but as an exact value, it's (-12 sqrt(193))/193.

Wait, but the problem says "what is cos(angle RPS)?"

Is there a way to express this more simply? Because 193 is a prime number, so sqrt(193) can't be simplified.

Alternatively, maybe I can write it as -12/193 sqrt(193). Wait, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is simply -12/13? Wait, 12 and 13 are from the sin(theta) = 7/25, so maybe it's a 7-24-25 triangle?

Wait, wait, 7-24-25 triangle is a right triangle, so maybe that relates.

But in triangle PQR, angle at P is theta with sin(theta) = 7/25, so if we model triangle PQR as right-angled somewhere, but it's not necessarily right-angled.

Wait, but in my coordinate system, PR is (36/25, 21/25), so its length is sqrt( (36/25)^2 + (21/25)^2 ) = sqrt(1737)/25 ≈ 1.667.

Wait, 1737 is 9*193, so sqrt(1737) is 3 sqrt(193). So, I think that's as far as we can go.

But let me think again.

Alternatively, in triangle PQR, with angle at P, sin(theta) = 7/25. So, if we can find the sides, maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines.

Wait, let me denote:

In triangle PQR, angle at P is theta, sin(theta) = 7/25.

Let me denote sides:

PQ = 2

PR = let's say, 'a'

QR = 'b'

So, from the Law of Sines:

sin(theta)/QR = sin(angle PQR)/PR = sin(angle PRQ)/PQ

But we don't know the other angles, so maybe it's not helpful.

Alternatively, from the Law of Cosines on triangle PQR:

QR^2 = PQ^2 + PR^2 - 2*PQ*PR*cos(theta)

But we don't know QR, but we can compute it from coordinates.

Wait, earlier, we found QR ≈ 1.0096, but exact value is sqrt(637)/25.

So, QR^2 = 637/625.

PQ^2 = 4

PR^2 = 1737/625

So, let's plug into the Law of Cosines:

QR^2 = PQ^2 + PR^2 - 2*PQ*PR*cos(theta)

So, 637/625 = 4 + 1737/625 - 2*2*(sqrt(1737)/25)*cos(theta)

Compute 4 as 2500/625.

So, 637/625 = 2500/625 + 1737/625 - (4 sqrt(1737)/25) cos(theta)

So, 637 = 2500 + 1737 - (4 sqrt(1737)/25)*625 cos(theta)

Wait, let me check:

Wait, 637/625 = (2500 + 1737)/625 - (4 sqrt(1737)/25) cos(theta)

So, 637 = 2500 + 1737 - 4 sqrt(1737)*25 cos(theta)

Compute 2500 + 1737 = 4237

So, 637 = 4237 - 100 sqrt(1737) cos(theta)

So, 100 sqrt(1737) cos(theta) = 4237 - 637 = 3600

So, cos(theta) = 3600 / (100 sqrt(1737)) = 36 / sqrt(1737) = same as earlier, which is 12 / sqrt(193) after simplifying.

Wait, 36 / sqrt(1737) = 36 / (3 sqrt(193)) = 12 / sqrt(193) = same as before.

So, cos(theta) is positive 12/sqrt(193). But in reality, in the coordinate system, the angle is obtuse because the dot product is negative.

Wait, hold on, in the coordinate system, the angle between PR and PS is actually greater than 90 degrees because vector PR is in the first quadrant and vector PS is in the second quadrant, so the angle between them is more than 90 degrees, so cosine should be negative. But in my calculation, I have cos(theta) as -12 sqrt(193)/193, which is negative, which is correct.

But when I applied the Law of Cosines, I got a positive 12/sqrt(193). That seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Law of Cosines.

Wait, in Law of Cosines, for angle theta at P, we have QR^2 = PQ^2 + PR^2 - 2 PQ PR cos(theta). So, in our case, cos(theta) is positive, but in reality, the angle between PR and PS is actually 180 - theta, which is obtuse, so cos(180 - theta) = -cos(theta).

Wait, so in the diagram, angle RPS is 180 - theta, so cos(angle RPS) = -cos(theta). Therefore, in the Law of Cosines, we have angle theta, but in reality, the angle we need is 180 - theta, so cosine is negative of the cosine of theta.

Wait, that's probably where I messed up.

So, in triangle PQR, angle at P is theta, which is angle QPR, with sin(theta) = 7/25.

But in the coordinate system, angle RPS is supplementary to angle QPR. Wait, angle RPS is the angle between PR and PS, which is 180 - angle QPR, because PS is on the opposite side of PQ.

Wait, so angle RPS = 180 - theta.

Therefore, cos(angle RPS) = cos(180 - theta) = -cos(theta).

But earlier, from the coordinate system, we found cos(theta) = -12 sqrt(193)/193, which is negative. So, that suggests that angle RPS is theta, which can't be because angle RPS is 180 - theta.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, in triangle PQR, angle at P is angle QPR = theta, with sin(theta) = 7/25.

In the coordinate system, point S is on the opposite side of PQ from R, so angle RPS is on the other side, so it's 180 - theta.

Therefore, cos(angle RPS) = cos(180 - theta) = -cos(theta).

But from the coordinate system, cos(theta) is negative, so -cos(theta) would be positive.

Wait, but in the Law of Cosines, we found cos(theta) = 12 / sqrt(193), which is positive, but in reality, in the coordinate system, angle RPS is 180 - theta, whose cosine is negative of cos(theta).

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to clarify.

Let me denote:

Let’s call angle QPR as theta, with sin(theta) = 7/25. So, angle RPS is angle between PR and PS, which is the supplementary angle to theta, so angle RPS = 180 - theta.

Therefore, cos(angle RPS) = cos(180 - theta) = -cos(theta).

So, if we can find cos(theta), then cos(angle RPS) is -cos(theta).

But in the coordinate system, we found cos(theta) as negative, which would make cos(angle RPS) positive. But in reality, angle RPS is 180 - theta, which is obtuse, so cos(angle RPS) should be negative.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I should use the Law of Cosines properly.

Wait, in triangle PQR, angle at P is theta, so sides are PQ=2, PR= sqrt(1737)/25, QR= sqrt(637)/25.

So, using Law of Cosines:

QR^2 = PQ^2 + PR^2 - 2 PQ PR cos(theta)

So, (637/625) = 4 + (1737/625) - 2*(2)*(sqrt(1737)/25)*cos(theta)

Multiply both sides by 625:

637 = 2500 + 1737 - 2*2*sqrt(1737)*25 cos(theta)

So, 637 = 4237 - 100 sqrt(1737) cos(theta)

So, 100 sqrt(1737) cos(theta) = 4237 - 637 = 3600

So, cos(theta) = 3600 / (100 sqrt(1737)) = 36 / sqrt(1737) = same as before, which is 12 / sqrt(193).

So, cos(theta) is positive 12 / sqrt(193). But in reality, in the coordinate system, the angle between PR and PS is 180 - theta, which is obtuse, so cos(angle RPS) = -cos(theta) = -12 / sqrt(193).

But wait, in the coordinate system, we directly computed the angle between PR and PS as negative, which gave cos(theta) = -12 sqrt(193)/193. So, that seems conflicting.

Wait, I think the confusion is arising because in the coordinate system, the angle between PR and PS is 180 - theta, so if theta is acute, then angle RPS is obtuse, and vice versa. Therefore, cos(angle RPS) = -cos(theta).

But when we computed it via the dot product, we directly got cos(angle RPS) = -12 sqrt(193)/193, which is equivalent to -12 / sqrt(193). Since sqrt(193) is approx 13.89, so 12 / 13.89 ≈ 0.864, so -0.864, which is the same as -12 / sqrt(193) ≈ -0.864.

Wait, but 12 / sqrt(193) is approximately 12 / 13.89 ≈ 0.864.

Wait, so cos(angle RPS) = -12 / sqrt(193).

But, in the Law of Cosines, we found that cos(theta) = 12 / sqrt(193). So, angle RPS is 180 - theta, so cos(angle RPS) = -cos(theta) = -12 / sqrt(193).

So, that's consistent.

Therefore, cos(angle RPS) = -12 / sqrt(193). Rationalizing the denominator, we get (-12 sqrt(193))/193.

So, that is the exact value.

Therefore, the answer is -12 sqrt(193)/193.

But to write it in the simplest form, I think that's acceptable, as 193 is a prime number and can't be simplified further.

Alternatively, we can write as -12/193 sqrt(193), but both are equivalent.

Wait, let me compute 12 sqrt(193)/193:

sqrt(193) ≈13.890, so 12*13.890 ≈166.68, so 166.68/193 ≈0.864.

So, 12 sqrt(193)/193 ≈0.864, so with the negative sign, it's ≈-0.864.

Which is consistent with our earlier approximate calculation.

Therefore, the exact value is -12 sqrt(193)/193.

So, the answer is \boxed{-\dfrac{12\sqrt{193}}{193}}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-\dfrac{12\sqrt{193}}{193}}

Given the diagram and the problem, we need to find \(\cos \angle RPS\) where \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\).

1. **Identify Coordinates and Vectors**:
   - Point \(P\) is at the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - Point \(Q\) is at \((2, 0)\).
   - Point \(S\) is at \((-2, 0)\).
   - Point \(R\) is obtained by rotating the point \((1.5, 0)\) by \(\arcsin\left(\frac{7}{25}\right)\). Using the rotation matrix, the coordinates of \(R\) are \(\left(\frac{36}{25}, \frac{21}{25}\right)\).

2. **Vectors Calculation**:
   - Vector \(PR\) is \(\left(\frac{36}{25}, \frac{21}{25}\right)\).
   - Vector \(PS\) is \((-2, 0)\).

3. **Dot Product and Magnitudes**:
   - Dot product of \(PR\) and \(PS\) is \(\left(\frac{36}{25}\right)(-2) + \left(\frac{21}{25}\right)(0) = -\frac{72}{25}\).
   - Magnitude of \(PR\) is \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{36}{25}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{21}{25}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1737}{625}} = \frac{\sqrt{1737}}{25}\).
   - Magnitude of \(PS\) is 2.

4. **Cosine of the Angle**:
   - Using the dot product formula: \(\cos \theta = \frac{\text{dot product}}{|\text{PR}| |\text{PS}|}\).
   - \(\cos \theta = \frac{-\frac{72}{25}}{\left(\frac{\sqrt{1737}}{25}\right) \cdot 2} = \frac{-72}{2\sqrt{1737}} = \frac{-36}{\sqrt{1737}}\).
   - Simplifying \(\sqrt{1737} = 3\sqrt{193}\), we get \(\cos \theta = \frac{-12}{\sqrt{193}}\).
   - Rationalizing the denominator, we get \(\cos \theta = \frac{-12\sqrt{193}}{193}\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The angle \(RPS\) is supplementary to \(\theta\), so \(\cos \angle RPS = -\cos \theta\).
   - Therefore, \(\cos \angle RPS = -\left(\frac{12\sqrt{193}}{193}\right)\).

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{-\dfrac{12\sqrt{193}}{193}}\).
