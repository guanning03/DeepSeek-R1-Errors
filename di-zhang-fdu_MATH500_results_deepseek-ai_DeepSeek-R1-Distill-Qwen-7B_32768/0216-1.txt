Correct Answer:
The number of $1\times1$ squares in the diagram is $2(n-1)$, the number of $2\times 2$ squares is $n-2$, and the number of $\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}$ squares is also $n-2$ (see diagram).  Solving \[
2(n-1)+n-2+n-2=70
\] we find $n=\boxed{19}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I've got this problem here about a 3×n grid of points. The question says there are a total of 70 squares whose vertices are points on this grid, and these squares come in three different sizes. I need to figure out what n is.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in a grid, squares can be counted based on their side lengths and orientations. Since this grid is 3 units tall and n units wide, and it's made up of points, that means there are 4 points along the height (0 to 3) and n+1 points along the width (0 to n). So, the grid has (n+1) columns and 4 rows.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's 3 rows by n columns, meaning it's a rectangle with 3 units vertically and n units horizontally. The Asymptote code shows a 3×n grid, but I don't know the exact value of n yet.

The problem mentions there are squares of three sizes. So, I need to figure out how many squares of each size can be formed in this grid and then add them up to get 70.

Let me recall that in a grid, the number of squares of a particular size depends on how many positions that square can occupy without going beyond the grid. For example, in a grid with m rows and k columns, the number of 1×1 squares is (m-1)(k-1). Similarly, the number of 2×2 squares is (m-2)(k-2), and so on, as long as the dimensions allow it.

But wait, this grid is 3×n, but actually, since it's a grid of points, the number of unit squares (squares with side length 1) would be (3-1)(n-1) = 2(n-1). Similarly, for squares of side length 2, it would be (3-2)(n-2) = 1(n-2). However, in a 3×n grid, can we have squares larger than 2×2? Well, a square of side length 3 would require 4 points along each side, but since the grid only has 4 points vertically, maybe we can have squares of size 3×3? Wait, in terms of grid squares, but since the grid is 3 units high, a square of side length 3 would span the entire height, but only 3 units wide. Hmm, but the grid is 3 units tall and n units wide, so depending on n, maybe we can have such squares.

Wait, maybe I should clarify: in a grid of points, the number of squares is determined by the number of positions where a square of a certain size can fit. For a square of side length k, the number of such squares is (number of rows - k + 1) multiplied by (number of columns - k + 1). But in this case, the grid has 4 rows and (n+1) columns of points, so the number of squares of side length k would be (4 - k) * (n + 1 - k). But wait, is that correct?

Hold on, maybe I'm confusing grid points with unit squares. Let me think. If the grid is 3×n points, that means it's a grid with 3 rows and n columns, so the number of unit squares would be (3 - 1)*(n - 1) = 2(n - 1). Similarly, for squares of size 2×2, it would be 1*(n - 2). But wait, the squares can also be tilted, right? Because in a grid, you can have squares that are not aligned with the grid lines, like diamonds or rotated squares.

Wait, the problem didn't specify whether the squares have to be axis-aligned or can be at an angle. Hmm, the Asymptote code shows a grid with points, and it's a 3×n grid. I'm not sure if the squares are restricted to axis-aligned or can be any orientation. The problem says "vertices are points on this rectangular 3×n grid of points," so it doesn't specify orientation, so I think we have to consider all possible squares, both axis-aligned and tilted.

Therefore, my initial approach was only considering axis-aligned squares, but actually, we might have more squares if we consider squares that are rotated, like 45-degree rotated squares or others.

So, how do we approach counting all squares in a grid?

I remember that in a grid, the number of squares can be calculated by considering all possible squares of all possible sizes and orientations. For a grid with m rows and k columns, the total number of squares is the sum over all possible square sizes s, where s is from 1 up to the minimum of (m, k), of (m - s + 1)(k - s + 1). But that's only for axis-aligned squares.

But for squares of any orientation, it's a bit more complicated. I think the formula for counting all squares in a grid is different.

Wait, maybe I should look for a way to calculate the number of squares in a grid, including all orientations.

I recall that in a square grid, the number of squares is the sum of squares, but that's only for axis-aligned squares. For all squares, including tilted ones, the formula is different.

In a grid with m rows and k columns, the number of squares of all sizes is given by the formula:

Sum from s=1 to min(m, k) of (m - s + 1)(k - s + 1) + additional squares for each possible orientation.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Actually, I think the number of squares in a grid, regardless of orientation, is more complex because squares can be rotated at various angles, not just 45 degrees. For each possible square, we can calculate its side length and the number of positions it can occupy.

But this might get complicated because for each possible square, whether it's axis-aligned or tilted, we need to consider its bounding box dimensions.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of vectors. For a square, the side length can be determined by the distance between two points, and the number of such squares would depend on how many times that vector can fit in the grid.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I should look for a formula or a method to calculate the total number of squares in a grid, including all orientations. I think the number is equal to the sum over all possible side lengths s (from 1 to the maximum possible) of the number of squares with that side length, considering both axis-aligned and tilted squares.

But how?

Alternatively, I remember that in a grid, the number of squares can be calculated by considering all possible pairs of points that can form the diagonal of a square. Then, for each such pair, if the distance between them is sqrt(2)*k for some integer k, and they are positioned such that the other two vertices also lie on the grid, then it's a square.

But this seems too abstract.

Wait, maybe it's better to approach it step by step. Let's start with axis-aligned squares, then consider squares that are tilted at 45 degrees, and perhaps any other orientations.

First, axis-aligned squares.

In a 3×n grid of points, the number of axis-aligned squares is calculated as follows:

For 1×1 squares: The number is (number of unit squares) = (rows - 1)*(columns - 1) = (3 - 1)*(n - 1) = 2(n - 1).

For 2×2 squares: Similarly, the number is (rows - 2)*(columns - 2) = (3 - 2)*(n - 2) = 1*(n - 2).

For 3×3 squares: Wait, in a 3×n grid, can we have 3×3 squares? A 3×3 square would require points that are 4 units apart in both directions, but since the grid is only 3 units tall, a 3×3 square would require 4 rows of points, but our grid only has 3 rows. Therefore, we can't have 3×3 axis-aligned squares.

So, only 1×1 and 2×2 axis-aligned squares.

Therefore, the total number of axis-aligned squares is 2(n - 1) + (n - 2).

Simplify that: 2n - 2 + n - 2 = 3n - 4.

Okay, so axis-aligned squares give us 3n - 4.

Now, moving on to squares that are not axis-aligned. These are squares that are rotated, such as squares tilted at 45 degrees or other angles.

To count these, I need to find all squares where the sides are not parallel to the grid lines.

How do we count these?

I remember that for a square to be tilted, its sides must form right angles, and the distance between the points must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

In a grid, the vectors that can form the sides of squares can be represented as (a, b), where a and b are integers, and the length squared is a^2 + b^2. For the square to be valid, the other two points must also lie on the grid.

So, for each possible vector (a, b), we can see how many squares can be formed with that vector.

But since the grid is finite, we have to make sure that all four vertices of each square lie within the grid.

Given that the grid is 3 rows by n columns, let's consider the possible vectors (a, b) such that the square can fit within the grid.

First, let's consider squares tilted at 45 degrees, which have vectors like (1,1), (1,-1), etc. These squares would have side lengths sqrt(2), but wait, in terms of grid points, moving from (x, y) to (x+1, y+1) is a vector of (1,1), which would create a square of side length sqrt(2).

But wait, in our grid, we have points in a 3×n grid, so how many such squares can we have?

Let me think. If we have a vector (1,1), the square would require points at (x, y), (x+1, y+1), (x, y+2), (x-1, y+1). Wait, no, actually, for a square with vector (1,1), the next point would be (x+1, y+1), then to complete the square, we need to go in a perpendicular direction.

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. Starting from (x, y), moving (1,1) to (x+1, y+1), then moving (-1,1) to (x, y+2), then moving (-1, -1) to (x-1, y+1), but that doesn't make a square. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the square's side vectors. For a square, two adjacent sides should be perpendicular and of equal length.

So, if I have a vector (a, b), the other vector should be (-b, a) or (b, -a) to form a right angle.

Therefore, for a given vector (a, b), the number of squares is determined by how many positions such vectors can fit in the grid.

So, let's consider all possible (a, b) vectors where a and b are integers, and a ≠ 0, b ≠ 0, and a^2 + b^2 is the squared length.

In our grid, which is 3 rows and n columns, we have to find all possible (a, b) vectors such that the square with sides (a, b) and (-b, a) can fit within the grid.

So, let's start with the smallest possible vectors.

First, vector (1, 0): That's the axis-aligned case, which we've already considered.

Vector (0, 1): Also axis-aligned.

Vector (1, 1): This would form a square tilted at 45 degrees with side length sqrt(2).

Similarly, vector (1, 2): This would form a square with side length sqrt(5).

Wait, but we have to check if such squares can fit in our 3×n grid.

So, let's try to find all possible vectors (a, b) such that the square can fit in the grid.

Given that the grid has 3 rows, the maximum vertical distance we can have is 2 units (since the grid has 3 points, the maximum difference in y-coordinates is 2). Similarly, the maximum horizontal distance is (n - 1) units.

So, for a vector (a, b), the maximum a is such that a ≤ (n - 1), and the maximum b is such that b ≤ 2, because the grid only has 3 rows.

Therefore, possible vectors (a, b) where a and b are integers, a ≥ 1, b ≥ 1, and a^2 + b^2 is the squared length.

So, let's list all possible (a, b) vectors:

1. (1, 1): This vector would give squares of side length sqrt(2). The other vector would be (-1, 1) or (1, -1), but since we're on a grid, negative vectors just flip the direction. So, for each occurrence of (1,1) in the grid, we can form a square.

2. (1, 2): This vector would give squares of side length sqrt(5). The other vector would be (-2, 1) or (2, -1). Wait, but in our grid, can we have a vector of (2,1)? Because the grid has 3 rows, so the maximum b is 2.

Wait, let's think. For vector (1, 2), starting from a point (x, y), the next point would be (x+1, y+2). But since the grid only has 3 rows (y = 0, 1, 2), y+2 must be ≤ 2, so y must be 0. So, such squares can only exist in the first row.

Similarly, the other vector would be (-2, 1), so starting from (x, y), moving (-2, 1) would take us to (x-2, y+1). So, x must be ≥ 2.

So, to form such a square, the starting point (x, y) must satisfy x ≥ 2 and y = 0.

Additionally, after moving (1,2) to (x+1, y+2), we need to move (-2,1) to (x+1 -2, y+2 +1) = (x -1, y+3). But wait, y+3 would be beyond the grid since y can only be 0,1,2. So, y+3 is invalid. Therefore, such squares cannot exist because the fourth point would be outside the grid.

Wait, that's a problem. So, even though we can move (1,2) from (x, 0), the resulting point (x -1, 3) is outside the grid since y only goes up to 2. Therefore, such squares cannot be formed. Hence, vector (1,2) doesn't contribute any squares.

Similarly, let's check vector (2,1). Starting from (x, y), moving (2,1) would take us to (x+2, y+1). Then, moving (-1,2) would take us to (x+2 -1, y+1 +2) = (x+1, y+3). Again, y+3 is beyond the grid. So, this square would also not fit.

Therefore, vector (2,1) can't form a square in this grid.

What about vector (1, -1)? That would be a downward tilt, but since our grid only goes up to y=2, starting from y=1 or y=2, moving (1,-1) would be valid.

Wait, let's consider vector (1, -1). Starting from (x, y), moving (1, -1) to (x+1, y-1). Then, moving (1,1) would take us to (x+2, y). Then, moving (-1,0) would take us back to (x+1, y). Wait, that doesn't form a square. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that for a square, if we have vectors (a, b) and (-b, a), the four points would be (x, y), (x+a, y+b), (x+a - b, y+b + a), and (x - b, y + a). So, for each starting point (x, y), these four points must lie within the grid.

Therefore, for vector (1,1):

- Starting point (x, y): must have x + 1 ≤ n-1 (since columns are 0 to n-1) and y + 1 ≤ 2 (since rows are 0,1,2).
- So, x ≤ n - 2 and y ≤ 1.
- Therefore, the number of such squares is (number of x positions) * (number of y positions) = (n - 1) * 2. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, if we have 3 rows, y can be 0 or 1 for the starting point so that y +1 ≤ 2. Similarly, for columns, x can be from 0 to n - 2 (since x +1 ≤ n -1). Therefore, the number of squares with vector (1,1) is (n - 1) * 2.

Wait, but let's verify.

If we have 3 rows (y=0,1,2), but to start a square with vector (1,1), we need to be at y=0 or y=1, because y=2 would lead to y+1=3, which is beyond the grid. Similarly, for columns, x can be from 0 to n - 2, because x +1 must be ≤ n -1.

Therefore, the number of squares with vector (1,1) is (n - 1) * 2, since there are 2 possible y positions (0 and 1) and n -1 possible x positions (0 to n -2).

Wait, but actually, for each x from 0 to n -2, and each y from 0 to 1, we can form a square. So, the number is (n -1) * 2. So, 2(n -1).

Similarly, for vector (1,-1): Starting from y=1 or y=2, moving (1,-1). So, y must be 1 or 2, and x must be from 0 to n -2.

So, starting from (x,1), moving (1,-1) to (x+1,0). Then, moving (-1,-1) to (x, -1), which is invalid. Wait, no, perhaps I'm not applying the correct vectors.

Wait, maybe I should use the vectors (a, b) and (-b, a). So for vector (1,1), the other vector is (-1,1). So, starting from (x, y), moving (1,1) to (x+1, y+1), then moving (-1,1) to (x, y+2), and then moving (-1,-1) to (x -1, y+1), but that last point (x -1, y+1) must lie within the grid. So, x must be ≥1.

Therefore, for vector (1,1), starting points (x, y) must satisfy x ≥1 and y ≤1. So, x can be from 1 to n -1, and y can be 0 or 1.

Hence, the number of squares with vector (1,1) is (n -1) * 2.

Similarly, for vector (1,1), same count.

Wait, so for each (1,1) vector, the number of squares is 2(n -1). But wait, that seems to be the same as the axis-aligned squares.

Wait, no, because axis-aligned squares are 1×1 and 2×2, but these squares with vector (1,1) are different.

Wait, actually, in our earlier count of axis-aligned squares, we had 2(n -1) 1×1 squares and (n -2) 2×2 squares, totaling 3n -4.

But these squares with vector (1,1) are not axis-aligned; they are tilted squares. So, they are separate.

So, the number of squares with vector (1,1) is 2(n -1). Similarly, we might have squares with vector (1, -1). But since the grid is symmetric, maybe it's the same count.

Wait, let me think again.

For vector (1,1), the starting points must be such that (x +1, y +1) is within the grid, and (x, y +2) is within the grid.

So, x must be ≤ n -2 and y must be ≤1.

Similarly, for vector (1, -1), starting points must be such that (x +1, y -1) is within the grid, and (x, y -2) is within the grid.

So, y must be ≥2 and x ≤ n -2.

But in our grid, y can only be 0,1,2. So, for vector (1,-1), starting points would be y=2, and x from 0 to n -2.

Therefore, the number of squares with vector (1, -1) is (n -1) * 1.

Similarly, for vector (1,1), starting points are y=0 and y=1, so 2(n -1).

Wait, so in total, squares with vector (1,1) and (1,-1) would be 2(n -1) + (n -1) = 3(n -1).

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recast this.

For vector (1,1):

- Starting points: x from 0 to n -2 (so n -1 positions), y from 0 to 1 (so 2 positions). So total squares: (n -1)*2.

For vector (1,-1):

- Starting points: x from 0 to n -2 (n -1 positions), y from 1 to 2 (2 positions). So total squares: (n -1)*2.

Wait, but hold on. For vector (1,-1), starting at y=1, moving to y=0, and then moving (1,-1) again would take us to y=-1, which is invalid. So, actually, only starting at y=2 can we move (1,-1) twice without leaving the grid.

Wait, so for vector (1,-1), starting at (x,2), moving (1,-1) to (x+1,1), then moving (1,-1) again to (x+2,0). Then, to complete the square, moving (-1,1) from (x+2,0) to (x+1,1), which is already one of the points. Hmm, maybe I'm not visualizing this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of squares with vector (1,-1) is (n -1)*1 because starting from y=2, x can go up to n -2.

Similarly, for vector (1,1), starting from y=0 and y=1, so (n -1)*2.

Therefore, total squares with vectors (1,1) and (1,-1) would be 2(n -1) + (n -1) = 3(n -1).

But wait, is that correct?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for each of these vectors, the number is (n -1) * number of starting y positions.

For vector (1,1): starting y can be 0 or 1, so 2 positions. So, 2*(n -1).

For vector (1,-1): starting y can only be 2, so 1 position. So, 1*(n -1).

Therefore, total squares with these vectors: 3(n -1).

But does that make sense?

Wait, let me test with small n.

Suppose n=3.

Then, the grid is 3×3 points.

For vector (1,1):

Starting points: x=0,1 (since n=3, x must be ≤1), y=0,1.

So, 2*2=4 squares.

For vector (1,-1):

Starting points: x=0,1, y=2.

So, 2 squares.

Total squares: 6.

But in a 3×3 grid, how many squares are there?

Axis-aligned: 1×1: 4, 2×2:1. So, 5.

Tilted squares: 6?

Wait, that's 11 in total? But that seems too high.

Wait, let me count manually.

In a 3×3 grid (points):

Axis-aligned squares: 1×1: 4, 2×2:1. So, total 5.

Tilted squares: 2 squares of sqrt(2) size.

Wait, is that correct?

From the points, you can have squares like (0,0), (1,1), (0,2), (-1,1), but (-1,1) is outside. So, actually, maybe not.

Wait, in a 3×3 grid, how many squares can you have?

Wait, actually, in a 3×3 grid, the number of squares is 6: 4 small axis-aligned, 1 medium axis-aligned, and 1 tilted.

Wait, perhaps I'm not counting correctly.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that in a 3×3 grid, you can have:

- 4 1×1 axis-aligned squares.

- 1 2×2 axis-aligned square.

- 1 tilted square.

So, total 6 squares.

But according to the formula, 3(n -1) where n=3: 3(2)=6. So, that seems to fit.

Therefore, the count for squares with vectors (1,1) and (1,-1) is 6, which matches the manual count.

So, with n=3, we have 5 axis-aligned and 6 tilted, total 11.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, axis-aligned squares are 5 and tilted squares are 6? That seems too much.

Wait, in a 3×3 grid, I think the number of squares is 6: 4 axis-aligned 1×1, 1 axis-aligned 2×2, and 1 tilted. So, 6 squares in total.

But according to our previous calculation, axis-aligned are 5? Wait, no, axis-aligned are 3n -4: when n=3, 3*3 -4=5. So, that's 5 axis-aligned squares, and 6 tilted? That can't be.

Wait, maybe the formula for axis-aligned is incorrect. Wait, axis-aligned squares in a 3×n grid: 1×1 and 2×2.

Wait, for 1×1: 2(n -1). For n=3, that's 4 squares.

For 2×2: 1*(n -2). For n=3, that's 1 square.

So, total axis-aligned squares: 4 +1=5. That's correct.

Then, the tilted squares: in n=3, how many?

From vector (1,1): starting points (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1). So, 4 squares? Wait, but n=3, so x can go up to 2, but starting x must be ≤1 because x +1 must be ≤2 (since n=3, columns 0,1,2; x +1 should be ≤2). So, starting x=0,1.

Similarly, starting y=0,1.

Therefore, for vector (1,1): 2*2=4 squares.

But in reality, in a 3×3 grid, we can only fit one square of vector (1,1). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm overcounting.

Wait, in a 3×3 grid, the square with vector (1,1) starting at (0,0) would have points (0,0), (1,1), (0,2), (-1,1). But (-1,1) is outside the grid, so that square is invalid.

Similarly, starting at (0,1): points (0,1), (1,2), (0,3), (-1,2). Again, (0,3) is outside.

Starting at (1,0): points (1,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,1). All points except (0,1) are inside, but (1,2) is okay, but (0,1) is also inside. Wait, so does that square count?

Wait, (1,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,1). So, all these points are within the grid, right?

(1,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,1). So, that's a square tilted at 45 degrees with side length sqrt(2).

Similarly, starting at (1,1): points (1,1), (2,2), (1,3), (0,2). But (1,3) is outside. So, that square is invalid.

Therefore, in a 3×3 grid, how many such squares are there? Only 1: starting at (1,0).

Wait, but according to our earlier count, it's 4, but in reality, only 1 is valid.

So, perhaps my formula is overcounting.

Hmm, so maybe the number of squares with vector (1,1) is not 2(n -1) but something else.

Alternatively, maybe my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps instead of considering all possible vectors, I should use a different formula for counting squares in a grid.

Wait, I remember that in a grid with m rows and n columns, the total number of squares is given by the sum over all possible square sizes s, where s is from 1 up to the minimum of (m -1) and (n -1), of (m - s)(n - s). But that's only for axis-aligned squares.

But for all squares, including tilted ones, it's more complicated.

Wait, I found a resource that says that the number of squares in a grid can be calculated by considering all possible squares of different sizes and orientations.

But perhaps it's too time-consuming for me to derive the formula here.

Wait, another approach: for any square, it's determined by two vectors (a, b) and (-b, a), as before.

So, for each possible pair of points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), we can see if (x2 -x1, y2 - y1) is a vector that can form a square.

But that seems too vague.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the bounding box.

For a square of side length sqrt(s), the bounding box required is s x s.

But in our grid, the maximum s is 2, because the grid is only 3 rows.

Wait, no, that's for axis-aligned squares. For tilted squares, the bounding box can be larger.

Wait, for example, a square with vector (1,1) has a bounding box of 2x2.

Wait, so in a 3×n grid, can we have squares that require a 2x2 bounding box?

Yes, but we have only 3 rows, so vertically, we can have up to 2 units.

Wait, so for a square with vector (1,1), its bounding box is 2x2, but in the grid, it's 3 rows and n columns.

Therefore, the number of such squares is (n -1)*(number of vertical positions). For the vector (1,1), the number of vertical positions is (3 - 2)=1, because the square spans 2 rows.

Wait, so for each column, how many squares can we have?

Wait, perhaps the number of squares with vector (1,1) is (n -1)*(number of vertical positions). Since the vector (1,1) spans 1 row and 1 column each, but since it's a square, it spans sqrt(2) in both x and y.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the bounding box.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to switch strategies. Instead of trying to count all possible squares, perhaps I can use the formula for the number of squares in a grid with m rows and n columns:

Total squares = sum_{i=1 to min(m-1, n-1)} (m - i)(n - i) + sum_{other orientations}.

But since I don't have a formula for other orientations, perhaps it's better to refer to known results.

Wait, actually, I found a resource that says the number of squares in a grid is given by:

sum_{i=1 to m-1} sum_{j=1 to n-1} gcd(i,j)^2

But wait, no, that's the number of lattice points visible from the origin or something else.

Wait, actually, the number of squares is equal to the number of rectangles whose sides are vectors (a, b) and (-b, a), such that both vectors fit in the grid.

But that's too vague.

Wait, maybe I should consider that each square is determined by two vectors, which must satisfy certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to refer back to the problem statement.

The problem says: There is a total of 70 squares of three sizes whose vertices are points on this rectangular 3×n grid of points. What is the value of n?

So, the problem mentions three sizes of squares. So, maybe the squares come in three distinct sizes, each with a certain number of squares, adding up to 70.

Therefore, perhaps I need to figure out what the possible sizes are in a 3×n grid.

First, let's figure out the possible square sizes.

In a 3×n grid, the possible square side lengths can be:

1. Axis-aligned:

- Size 1×1: side length 1
- Size 2×2: side length 2

2. Tilted squares:

- Size sqrt(2): side length sqrt(2)
- Size sqrt(5): side length sqrt(5)

Wait, let me check if sqrt(5) is possible.

A vector (2,1) would give side length sqrt(5). But in a 3×n grid, can such squares fit?

Starting from (x, y), moving (2,1) would take us to (x+2, y+1). Then, moving (-1,2) would take us to (x+1, y+3), which is beyond the grid because y+3 is beyond 2. So, such squares cannot fit.

Similarly, vector (1,2) would take us beyond the grid as well.

Similarly, vector (2,1) would require the square to have a height of 2 units, but moving (2,1) twice would take us beyond.

Wait, so maybe only vectors (1,1) and (1,-1) give valid tilted squares.

Therefore, the possible square sizes are:

1. Axis-aligned: 1×1 and 2×2.

2. Tilted: sqrt(2).

Wait, but then the problem mentions three sizes. So, perhaps in addition to these, there's another size.

Wait, maybe another orientation?

Wait, if we consider squares with vectors like (1,2), but as we saw, those squares can't fit in the grid because they go beyond the 3-row limit.

Wait, unless the square is rotated such that its sides are not aligned with (1,2), but maybe another vector.

Wait, let's consider vector (2,2). Wait, that would give a square of side length sqrt(8), but it's redundant with axis-aligned.

Wait, maybe we're missing something.

Wait, another possible square is a 1x1 square, but actually, that's the same as axis-aligned.

Wait, perhaps the third size is a combination of both axis-aligned and tilted.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, it's three sizes.

Wait, maybe the three sizes are 1×1, sqrt(2), and 2×2.

But in a 3×n grid, the number of axis-aligned squares of size 1×1 is 2(n -1), size 2×2 is (n -2). Tilted squares of size sqrt(2) is 2(n -1). So, total squares would be 2(n -1) + (n -2) + 2(n -1) = 5n -4.

But according to the problem, the total is 70. So, 5n -4=70 => 5n=74 => n=14.8, which is not an integer. So, that can't be.

Wait, so that suggests my count is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the three sizes are:

1. 1×1 axis-aligned: 2(n -1)

2. sqrt(2) tilted: 2(n -1)

3. 2×2 axis-aligned: (n -2)

So, total squares: 2(n -1) + 2(n -1) + (n -2) = 5n -4.

Again, same result.

But 5n -4=70 => 5n=74 => n=14.8. Not integer.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the three square sizes are different.

Wait, in a 3×n grid, maybe you can have squares of size 1×1, 2×2, and sqrt(5)×sqrt(5). Wait, but earlier, we saw that sqrt(5) squares can't fit.

Wait, unless n is larger.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose that in a 3×n grid, the possible square side lengths are:

1. 1 unit (axis-aligned)

2. sqrt(2) units (tilted)

3. 2 units (axis-aligned)

So, three different sizes: 1, sqrt(2), 2.

Therefore, total squares would be:

- 1×1: 2(n -1)

- sqrt(2): 2(n -1)

- 2×2: (n -2)

So, total: 2(n -1) + 2(n -1) + (n -2) = 5n -4.

Set equal to 70:

5n -4=70

5n=74

n=14.8

Not integer.

So, that can't be.

Wait, so perhaps the three sizes are something else.

Wait, perhaps the third size is a different tilted square.

Wait, for example, maybe a 2x2 square that's tilted.

Wait, but in a 3×n grid, a 2x2 tilted square would require more rows. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the possible squares.

In a 3×n grid, the maximum vertical distance between two points is 2 units, so any square with a vertical side length larger than 2 cannot fit.

Therefore, the possible square side lengths are limited.

Wait, in terms of squares:

- Axis-aligned: 1×1, 2×2.

- Tilted: sqrt(2), sqrt(5). But sqrt(5) requires more grid space.

Wait, but sqrt(5) squares can't fit as we saw earlier.

Therefore, perhaps only sqrt(2) tilted squares can fit.

Therefore, the three square sizes are:

1. 1×1 axis-aligned

2. 2×2 axis-aligned

3. sqrt(2) tilted

But then, as before, the total would be 5n -4=70, which gives n=14.8, which is not an integer.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong about the number of squares.

Wait, maybe the three sizes are 1×1, 2×2, and another tilted size.

Wait, but if the grid is 3×n, the other tilted size is sqrt(2). So, maybe it's indeed 1, 2, and sqrt(2).

But then 5n -4=70, which gives non-integer n.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not 3×n grid, but 3×n grid points, making it a 2×(n-1) grid?

Wait, no, the problem says 3×n grid of points. So, 3 rows, n columns.

Wait, perhaps the squares are counted differently.

Wait, let me try to think differently.

Suppose that in addition to axis-aligned squares, there are two types of tilted squares: one with side length sqrt(2) and another with side length sqrt(5). But as we saw, sqrt(5) squares can't fit.

Wait, but maybe for certain n, sqrt(5) squares can fit.

Wait, for example, if n is large enough, say n=5, then we might have sqrt(5) squares.

But in our case, n must be such that 5n -4=70, but n=14.8, which is not integer.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the number of squares is 2(n -1) + 2(n -1) + (n -2) + something else.

Wait, but according to the problem, there are three sizes, so only three different square types.

Wait, maybe the three sizes are:

1. 1×1: 2(n -1)

2. sqrt(2): 2(n -1)

3. 2×2: something else.

Wait, but 2×2 is axis-aligned.

Wait, maybe the total number is (2(n -1) + 2(n -1) + something) =70.

Alternatively, maybe the number of squares is 2(n -1) + 2(n -1) + (n -2) + 2(n -1) = ?

Wait, that seems messy.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, the number of squares in a grid is given by the formula for each possible square size.

In a grid with m rows and n columns, the number of squares is sum_{i=1 to m-1} sum_{j=1 to n-1} gcd(i,j)^2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, that's the number of lattice points visible from the origin.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the number of squares is given by the number of possible squares for each square size.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many squares of each size exist.

First, axis-aligned squares:

- 1×1: (number of positions) = (m -1)*(n -1) = 2*(n -1)

- 2×2: (m -2)*(n -2) = (1)*(n -2)

So, total axis-aligned squares: 2(n -1) + (n -2) = 3n -4.

Now, for tilted squares.

Tilted squares can be classified by their side vectors.

The smallest tilted square has side length sqrt(2), formed by vectors (1,1). So, how many such squares are there?

For each starting point (x, y), such that x +1 ≤n -1 and y +1 ≤2 (since it's 3 rows). So, x can be from 0 to n -2, y can be from 0 to1.

Therefore, number of such squares is (n -1)*2.

Similarly, another type of tilted square could be with vector (2,1), but we saw that such squares don't fit because they go beyond the grid.

Alternatively, perhaps another orientation.

Wait, vector (1,2) would also give a square, but moving (1,2) from (x, y) would lead to (x +1, y +2). Then, moving (-2,1) would lead to (x -1, y +3), which is beyond the grid.

Therefore, such squares cannot fit.

Wait, perhaps the only tilted square possible is with vector (1,1), so 2(n -1) squares.

Therefore, total squares: axis-aligned (3n -4) + tilted (2n - 2) = 5n -6.

But according to the problem, total squares are 70.

So, 5n -6=70 => 5n=76 => n=15.2.

Not integer.

Hmm, that's still not integer.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing another type of square.

Wait, maybe the third size is another tilted square with a different vector, like (2,2), but that would be a larger square.

Wait, a square with vector (2,2) would have side length sqrt(8). Let's see if such squares can fit.

Starting from (x, y), moving (2,2) to (x +2, y +2). Then, moving (-2,2) to (x, y +4). But since y +4 is beyond the 3-row grid, such squares cannot fit.

Therefore, such squares are invalid.

Alternatively, maybe the third size is the other way, vector (1, -1). But we already considered that.

Wait, maybe another vector, like (1,0), but that's axis-aligned.

Wait, perhaps I should consider squares of size 2×sqrt(2). Wait, is that possible?

Wait, a square with side length 2*sqrt(2) would require a 3x3 grid, but our grid is only 3 rows.

Wait, no, 2*sqrt(2) is the diagonal of a 2x2 square.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in addition to the 1×1 and 2×2 axis-aligned squares, and the sqrt(2) tilted squares, there's another type.

Wait, maybe squares of size sqrt(5). Wait, but vector (2,1) is needed, which we saw earlier can't fit.

Wait, but if n is large enough, say n=5, then starting from (x, y), moving (2,1) to (x+2, y+1), then moving (-1,2) to (x+1, y+3). But since y+3 exceeds 2, it's invalid.

Wait, but if n is 5, columns go up to 5, so x +2 can be up to 5 -1=4. But y is only 0,1,2, so y +3=3 is invalid.

Therefore, such squares still can't fit.

Wait, so perhaps my count is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows squares of different sizes, but only axis-aligned and one type of tilted.

Wait, given that the problem says there are three sizes, so maybe:

1. 1×1 axis-aligned

2. 2×2 axis-aligned

3. sqrt(2) tilted

So, total squares: 2(n -1) + (n -2) + 2(n -1) = 5n -4.

But 5n -4=70 => 5n=74 => n=14.8. Not integer.

Alternatively, perhaps the three sizes are:

1. 1×1 axis-aligned: 2(n -1)

2. 2×2 axis-aligned: (n -2)

3. sqrt(5) tilted: ?

But as we saw, sqrt(5) squares can't fit unless n is at least 4, but even then, they don't fit.

Wait, maybe n=5. Let's test n=5.

Then, total axis-aligned squares: 2*(5 -1)=8, 1*(5 -2)=3, total=11.

Tilted squares with vector (1,1): 2*(5 -1)=8.

Total squares:11+8=19.

Which is much less than 70.

Wait, 19≠70.

Wait, maybe n=10.

Axis-aligned:2*9=18, 1*8=8, total=26.

Tilted:2*9=18. Total squares=44.

Still less than 70.

n=12.

Axis-aligned:2*11=22, 1*10=10, total=32.

Tilted:2*11=22. Total squares=54.

Still less than 70.

n=14.

Axis-aligned:2*13=26, 1*12=12, total=38.

Tilted:2*13=26. Total squares=64.

Still less than 70.

n=15.

Axis-aligned:2*14=28, 1*13=13, total=41.

Tilted:2*14=28. Total squares=69.

Close to 70.

n=16.

Axis-aligned:2*15=30, 1*14=14, total=44.

Tilted:2*15=30. Total squares=74.

Which is more than 70.

Hmm, so n is between 15 and 16, but n must be integer.

Therefore, n=15 gives 69 squares, n=16 gives 74 squares.

But the problem says total squares are 70, so there's no integer n that gives exactly 70.

Wait, so perhaps my assumption is wrong about the number of tilted squares.

Wait, maybe the number of tilted squares is different.

Wait, maybe the number of tilted squares is not 2(n -1). Maybe it's 2(n -1)(n -2)/something.

Wait, let me think differently.

Wait, in the 3×n grid, how many squares of vector (1,1) can fit?

For each starting column x from 0 to n -2, and each starting row y from 0 to1, we can have a square.

Therefore, the number of such squares is (n -1)*2.

Similarly, for vector (1,-1), starting from y=1 to2, x from0 to n -2, so also (n -1)*2.

Wait, but in reality, for vector (1,-1), starting from (x, y) where y=1, x can be from0 to n -2, giving (n -1) squares.

Similarly, starting from y=2, x can be from0 to n -2, another (n -1) squares.

Therefore, total squares with vector (1,1) and (1,-1) is 2(n -1).

So, that part is correct.

Therefore, total squares: axis-aligned (3n -4) + tilted (2n -2) = 5n -6.

Set equal to70:

5n -6=70 =>5n=76 =>n=15.2.

Not integer. Therefore, this suggests that either the problem is miscounted or my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the problem counts squares of different sizes, but also includes squares that are not aligned with the grid's sides or diagonals.

Wait, but in a 3×n grid, the maximum square size is limited.

Wait, perhaps the three sizes include squares of different orientations.

Wait, for example, three different square sizes that can fit in a 3×n grid, each with different side lengths.

Wait, but in a 3×n grid, the only possible square sizes are 1, sqrt(2), and 2.

So, three sizes.

Therefore, according to this, the total number of squares is 5n -4=70 =>5n=74 =>n=14.8, which is not integer.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem includes squares larger than 2 in another orientation.

Wait, but in a 3×n grid, the maximum square side is 2, since the grid is only 3 rows.

Wait, perhaps the three sizes are:

1. 1×1 axis-aligned

2. 1×1 tilted (but that's same as axis-aligned)

Wait, no, that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not considering the orientation, just the side length regardless of direction.

Wait, in that case, side lengths can be 1, sqrt(2), sqrt(5), etc.

But in a 3×n grid, sqrt(5) can't fit.

Wait, so maybe the three sizes are 1, sqrt(2), and 2.

Therefore, the total number of squares is:

1×1 axis-aligned: 2(n -1)

2×2 axis-aligned: (n -2)

sqrt(2) tilted: 2(n -1)

Total: 2(n -1) + (n -2) +2(n -1)=5n -4.

Set equal to70:5n=74, n=14.8.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering squares that can be formed by connecting any four points, regardless of their sides being aligned or not.

Wait, but that would be the total number of squares, which can be calculated using the formula for number of squares in a grid.

Wait, perhaps that's the case.

Wait, I found a resource that says the number of squares in a grid is the sum over all possible square sizes, each computed by (m - s +1)(n - s +1) for s from1 to min(m,n).

But in our case, the grid is 3×n.

Therefore, number of squares of size 1×1: (3 -1)(n -1)=2(n -1)

Size 2×2: (3 -2)(n -2)=1*(n -2)

Size 3×3: 0, since 3×3 needs at least 4 rows.

Wait, but if we consider tilted squares, it's more complicated.

Wait, so in that formula, axis-aligned squares are 2(n -1) + (n -2) = 3n -4.

But in reality, in the grid, the number of axis-aligned squares is 3n -4.

But in addition, we have tilted squares.

Therefore, the total number of squares is 3n -4 + number of tilted squares.

Therefore, if the total number is70, then 3n -4 + t =70, where t is the number of tilted squares.

So, if I can find t in terms of n, then I can solve for n.

But how?

Well, the number of tilted squares can be calculated as follows:

For a square to be tilted, it must have sides of length sqrt(k), where k is an integer greater than1.

In a 3×n grid, the possible tilted squares are those with side vectors (1,1), which gives squares of side sqrt(2).

As before, the number of such squares is 2(n -1).

Therefore, total squares:3n -4 +2(n -1)=5n -6.

Set equal to70:5n -6=70 =>5n=76 =>n=15.2.

Not integer.

Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering squares of different sizes, not just 1, sqrt(2), 2.

Wait, but in a 3×n grid, the maximum possible square size is2, and only sqrt(2) is the tilted one.

Wait, unless n is such that larger squares can fit.

Wait, n=5, let's compute manually.

n=5.

Axis-aligned:

1×1:2*(5-1)=8

2×2:1*(5-2)=3

Total axis-aligned:11.

Tilted:

sqrt(2):2*(5 -1)=8

Total squares:19.

But problem says70, which is way higher.

Wait, maybe n=10.

Axis-aligned:

1×1:2*9=18

2×2:1*8=8

Total:26

Tilted:

sqrt(2):2*9=18

Total squares:44.

Wait, still less than70.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering all possible squares, including those that go beyond the 3-row grid in the other direction.

Wait, but in a 3×n grid, the other direction is only n columns.

Wait, perhaps the squares can be larger in the column direction.

Wait, for example, a square that is 1×1, but in the column direction, so 1×1.

Wait, no, it's the same as above.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in a 3×n grid where n is larger, say n=100, but that would have way more squares.

Wait, but in that case, the total number would be way more than70.

Wait, perhaps the problem includes squares in multiple orientations, but in our grid, only three sizes: 1, sqrt(2), 2.

But as we saw, 5n -6=70 =>n=15.2.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem counts squares of different sizes, including larger squares that wrap around.

But in a grid, squares can't wrap around.

Wait, unless considering the grid as a torus, but the problem doesn't specify that.

Wait, maybe the problem counts squares in all possible orientations, not just axis-aligned and sqrt(2). But in a 3×n grid, the only possible square sizes are 1, sqrt(2), and2.

So, as I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is incorrect or my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the grid is 3×n, but we're considering squares that can have their sides at any angle, not just 45 degrees.

Wait, but in that case, for each square, you have to compute the number of possible positions for each possible square.

But in a 3×n grid, the number of such squares is limited.

Wait, maybe the three sizes are:

1. 1×1 axis-aligned

2. 2×2 axis-aligned

3. 1×1 tilted

But then, it's still two unique sizes.

Wait, unless the problem counts 1×1, 1×1 tilted, and 2×2 axis-aligned as three sizes.

But then, it's still three sizes, but the count is still similar.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the three sizes are 1, 2, and sqrt(2), and according to the formula, 5n -6=70 =>n=15.2, but since n must be integer, perhaps n=15 or n=16.

But neither gives exactly 70.

Wait, 5*15 -6=75 -6=69.

5*16 -6=80 -6=74.

Hmm, 69 and74.

Wait, n=15 gives69, which is close to70.

But the problem says70.

Wait, maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the number of squares is more than just axis-aligned and tilted.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers squares of size sqrt(5). Wait, but as we saw, sqrt(5) squares can't fit.

Wait, unless n is larger.

Wait, if n=4.

Axis-aligned:2*3=6, 1*2=2, total=8.

Tilted:2*3=6.

Total squares=14.

n=5:19, n=6:24, n=7:29, n=8:34, n=9:39, n=10:44, n=11:49, n=12:54, n=13:59, n=14:64, n=15:69, n=16:74.

So, no, n=15 gives69, n=16 gives74.

Wait, maybe the problem counts both axis-aligned and tilted squares, but also squares that are 2×sqrt(2). Wait, how?

Wait, a square with side length 2*sqrt(2) would have a vector of (2,2). But in a 3×n grid, moving (2,2) from (x, y) would go to (x+2, y+2), which is beyond the 3-row limit.

So, can't fit.

Wait, I'm stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the three sizes are:

1. 1×1 axis-aligned

2. 2×2 axis-aligned

3. 1×1 tilted

But that's still two unique sizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the three sizes are:

1. 1×1 axis-aligned

2. 1×1 tilted

3. 2×2 axis-aligned

But again, three sizes, but similar counts.

Wait, 2(n -1) + (n -2) +2(n -1)=5n -6.

Wait, unless the problem is considering squares of different sizes, including non-integer side lengths.

But no, squares must have integer side lengths in terms of grid units.

Therefore, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the grid as 3 rows and n columns, but as 3 columns and n rows? Wait, no, the problem says 3×n grid of points, which is 3 rows and n columns.

Wait, perhaps the problem counts squares that have their corners at the grid points but are not necessarily axis-aligned or with sides at 45 degrees.

Wait, but in a 3×n grid, the only such squares are the axis-aligned and the sqrt(2) tilted ones.

Wait, unless considering larger tilted squares.

Wait, for example, a square with side length sqrt(5), but as we saw, it's impossible.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps we're considering squares that are formed by more than four points.

Wait, no, a square is four points.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering squares of different sizes, including those that are not based on the grid lines.

Wait, but in that case, the counting would be more complicated.

Wait, maybe it's better to reference the formula for squares in a grid.

Wait, according to the formula, the number of squares in a grid with m rows and n columns is the sum over s from1 to min(m,n) of (m - s +1)(n - s +1). But this counts only axis-aligned squares.

But in our problem, we're counting all squares, including tilted ones.

Therefore, the formula only counts axis-aligned squares.

Therefore, the total number of squares in the grid is more than that.

Wait, so if I use this formula, the number of axis-aligned squares is 2(n -1) + (n -2)=3n -4.

Then, the number of tilted squares can be found by subtracting that from70.

But wait, no, because the formula counts axis-aligned only.

Wait, so if I can find a formula for the number of squares in a grid, including all orientations, then:

In general, for a grid with m rows and n columns, the total number of squares is:

sum_{s=1}^{min(m,n)} (m - s +1)(n - s +1) + sum_{s=1}^{floor((m-1)/2)} sum_{t=1}^{floor((n-1)/2)} gcd(s,t)^2.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, alternatively, the number of squares in a grid is equal to the number of axis-aligned squares plus the number of squares with side vectors (a,b), where a and b are integers, not both zero.

But this is getting too complex.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula from the literature.

Wait, according to what I found, the number of squares in a grid is equal to the number of axis-aligned squares plus the number of squares with vectors (a, b), where a and b are positive integers, and the greatest common divisor of a and b is 1, plus their multiples.

Wait, perhaps too complicated.

Alternatively, for a grid with m rows and n columns, the number of squares is given by:

sum_{i=1}^{m-1} sum_{j=1}^{n-1} gcd(i,j)

But I'm not sure.

Wait, according to this resource, the number of squares in a grid is the sum over all possible square side lengths s, and for each s, the number of squares is (m - s)(n - s). But that counts only axis-aligned squares.

Wait, so in our case, axis-aligned squares are 3n -4.

But we need to add the tilted squares.

Wait, maybe the number of tilted squares in a 3×n grid is equal to 2(n -1). So, total squares:5n -6.

Set equal to70:5n=76, n=15.2.

Hmm.

Wait, unless the number of tilted squares is different.

Wait, maybe the number of tilted squares is 2(n -1)(n -2). So, for n=15:2*14*13=364, which is way too high.

No, that can't be.

Wait, maybe the number of tilted squares is 2(n -1).

Hmm.

Wait, if I accept that the formula is5n -6=70, then n=15.2, but since n must be integer, maybe the problem is expecting n=15, as it's close.

But in that case, 5*15 -6=69, which is one less than70.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the number of tilted squares is different.

Wait, let me think of the number of squares with side length sqrt(2): for each such square, it's determined by its top-left corner, such that the corner is in the grid. So, the number of such squares is (n -1)*(3 -2)= (n -1)*2.

Similarly, number of squares with side length2: (n -2)*(3 -3)=0.

Therefore, total tilted squares:2(n -1).

Therefore, total squares:3n -4 +2n -2=5n -6.

Therefore, 5n -6=70 =>5n=76 =>n=15.2.

Hmm.

Wait, unless the problem counts squares of size sqrt(5), but that can't fit.

Wait, but in a 3×n grid, n=15.2 is non-integer, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula for total squares is different.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the total number of squares in a 3×n grid is equal to the number of axis-aligned squares plus the number of tilted squares.

Axis-aligned squares:1×1:2(n -1), 2×2:1*(n -2). So, total axis-aligned:3n -4.

Tilted squares: with side length sqrt(2), number is 2(n -1).

Therefore, total squares:3n -4 +2n -2=5n -6.

Set equal to70:5n=76 =>n=15.2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering squares with side length sqrt(5), but in a 3×n grid, such squares can't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering squares that have side length sqrt(10), but that also can't fit.

Wait, perhaps the problem is misworded, and the grid is 3×n points, but the side length is different.

Wait, no, the side length is determined by the number of units between points.

Wait, unless the problem is considering squares of area70.

Wait, no, the problem says total number of squares is70.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is considering squares of different sizes, including those that are rotated, but not necessarily with side vectors of (1,1).

Wait, but in a 3×n grid, the maximum rotated square is sqrt(2), as beyond that, it would go outside the grid.

Wait, perhaps the squares are counted as unit squares, but in different sizes.

Wait, no, the problem is about the number of squares, not the number of unit squares.

Wait, I'm really stuck here.

Wait, maybe the answer is14, but 5n -6=70 =>5n=76, n=15.2, which is not integer.

Wait, maybe the answer is15, as it is the closest integer, and the discrepancy is due to an error in the problem statement.

But the problem states total squares are70, which is exactly5n -6=70, n=15.2, which is not integer.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the number of squares is not5n -6, but something else.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the number of squares is sum of squares of different sizes.

Wait, in a 3×n grid, the number of squares of size k×k is (3 -k)(n -k).

Therefore, for k=1:2*(n -1)

For k=2:1*(n -2)

Total axis-aligned squares:3n -4.

Number of tilted squares: For each possible square with side length sqrt(2), which is determined by vectors (1,1). The number is (n -1)*2.

Therefore, total squares:5n -6.

Set equal to70:5n=76 =>n=15.2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem includes squares that are formed by more than four points, but that's not standard.

Wait, no, a square is four points.

Wait, unless considering squares that have overlapping points, but that is not standard.

Wait, unless the problem is considering squares that are not necessarily with vertices at grid points, but somewhere else.

But no, the problem says "vertices are points on this grid."

Therefore, vertices must be at grid points.

Therefore, I think the formula is correct.

Therefore, unless the problem is incorrect, n=15.2, which is not integer, so perhaps the answer is15, as the closest integer.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the formula is different.

Wait, let me check n=14.

5*14 -6=70 -6=64.

Wait, n=14 gives64.

Wait, but the problem says70.

Wait, unless it's 5n -5=70 =>5n=75 =>n=15.

Wait, 5n -6=70 =>5n=76 =>n=15.2.

But 5n -5=70 =>n=15.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the formula is different.

Wait, if the number of squares is5n -5, then n=15.

But according to previous counts, that's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the answer is15, given that5n -6=70 gives n=15.2, so round to15.

But maybe the problem counts the number of unit squares.

Wait, no, in a 3×n grid, the number of unit squares is2(n -1).

Wait, 2(n -1)=70 =>n=36.

Wait, but that would be for unit squares only.

But the problem says total squares of three sizes, which includes larger squares.

Therefore, n=15.2 is the only solution, which is not integer.

Hence, I think the problem might have a typo, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is different.

Wait, let me think differently.

In a grid of m rows and n columns, the number of squares is:

sum_{i=1}^{min(m,n)} (m -i)(n -i)

Which is the number of axis-aligned squares.

But we need to add the tilted squares.

Wait, for each square with side length sqrt(k), where k is sum of squares of integers, the number is (m -i)(n -j) for some i and j.

Wait, perhaps the formula is more complicated.

Wait, according to the resource, the number of squares in a grid is equal to:

(m choose 2)(n choose 2) + sum_{i=1}^{m-1} sum_{j=1}^{n-1} gcd(i,j)

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to this formula.

Wait, according to this formula, the total number of squares in an m×n grid is the number of axis-aligned squares plus the number of squares with sides not aligned to the grid.

Number of axis-aligned squares: (m -1)(n -1) + (m -2)(n -2). Wait, no.

Wait, no, the number of axis-aligned squares is sum_{k=1}^{min(m,n)-1} (m -k)(n -k).

Which for m=3, n=n, it's sum_{k=1}^{2} (3 -k)(n -k)=2(n -1) +1*(n -2)=2n -2 +n -2=3n -4.

Therefore, axis-aligned squares:3n -4.

Tilted squares: ?

Wait, perhaps the number of tilted squares is sum_{k=1}^{floor((m-1)/2)} sum_{l=1}^{floor((n-1)/2)} gcd(k,l)^2.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of tilted squares is 2*(n -1).

Therefore, total squares:3n -4 +2*(n -1)=5n -6.

Set equal to70:5n=76 =>n=15.2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not considering the grid as 3×n, but as a 3×n lattice, meaning n points along one side and 3 points along the other.

Wait, that would be similar.

Therefore, regardless, n=15.2.

Hmm.

Wait, unless the problem is considering squares of different sizes, but including the grid lines.

Wait, no, the problem says vertices are points on the grid.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering all squares, including those that are not necessarily axis-aligned or with sides at 45 degrees, but with any orientation, as long as the vertices are on the grid.

But in that case, the number of squares is more than5n -6.

But in our case, for a 3×n grid, the maximum number of squares is limited.

Wait, maybe the number is 2*(n -1) + (n -1)*(n -2).

Wait, but that seems too high.

Wait, let me think.

Wait, in a 3×n grid, the number of squares of size1 is2(n -1).

The number of squares of size2 is1*(n -2).

The number of squares of size sqrt(2) is2(n -1).

Therefore, total squares:3n -4 +2(n -1)=5n -6.

Hmm.

Wait, unless the problem is including larger squares, but in a 3×n grid, it's impossible.

Wait, maybe the problem is in 3D, but the problem says grid of points, so 2D.

Wait, unless the grid is 3-dimensional, but no.

Wait, given all that, maybe the answer is15, since5n -6=70 leads ton=15.2≈15.

So, I'll go with n=15.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( n \) is \boxed{15}.
</think>

To determine the value of \( n \) for a 3×n rectangular grid of points where there are a total of 70 squares of three different sizes, we need to consider both axis-aligned squares and tilted squares.

1. **Axis-aligned squares**:
   - **1×1 squares**: The number of such squares is \( 2(n - 1) \).
   - **2×2 squares**: The number of such squares is \( (n - 2) \).
   - Total axis-aligned squares: \( 2(n - 1) + (n - 2) = 3n - 4 \).

2. **Tilted squares**:
   - **√2×√2 squares**: These squares are formed by vectors like (1,1) or (1,-1). The number of such squares is \( 2(n - 1) \).

3. **Total number of squares**:
   - The total number of squares is the sum of axis-aligned squares and tilted squares.
   - Total squares: \( (3n - 4) + 2(n - 1) = 5n - 6 \).

Given that the total number of squares is 70, we set up the equation:
\[ 5n - 6 = 70 \]
Solving for \( n \):
\[ 5n = 76 \]
\[ n = 15.2 \]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round to the nearest integer, which is 15.

Thus, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{15}\).
