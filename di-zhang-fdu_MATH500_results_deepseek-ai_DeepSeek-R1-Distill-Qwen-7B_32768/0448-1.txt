Question:
$\textbf{Juan's Old Stamping Grounds}$

Juan organizes the stamps in his collection by country and by the decade in which they were issued. The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each. (Brazil and Peru are South American countries and France and Spain are in Europe.) [asy]

[/asy] What was the average price, in cents, of his $70\text{'s}$ stamps? Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a cent.

Correct Answer:
The $\text{70's}$ stamps cost:

$\bullet$  Brazil, $12(\$ 0.06) = \$ 0.72;$

$\bullet$  Peru, $6(\$ 0.04) = \$ 0.24;$

$\bullet$  France, $12(\$ 0.06) = \$ 0.72;$

$\bullet$  Spain, $13(\$ 0.05) = \$ 0.65.$

The total is $\$2.33$ for the $43$ stamps and the average price is $\frac{\$ 2.33}{43} \approx \$0.054 = \boxed{5.4 \text{ cents}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here about Juan's stamp collection. It's asking for the average price, in cents, of his '70s stamps, rounded to the nearest tenth of a cent. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand the setup. Juan organizes his stamps by country and by the decade they were issued. The prices he paid were: Brazil and France at 6 cents each, Peru at 4 cents each, and Spain at 5 cents each. The Asymptote figure provided is a sort of bar graph showing the number of stamps he has for each country across different decades. 

Looking at the Asymptote code, it seems like it's drawing a bar graph with the x-axis labeled as countries: Brazil, France, Peru, Spain, and the y-axis labeled with different decades: 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s. Each bar is divided into five sections, each corresponding to a decade. The numbers on top of each bar section indicate the number of stamps in each decade for each country.

Wait, actually, let me parse the Asymptote code more carefully. It draws vertical lines at x=0 to x=18, and then labels the decades: 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s at positions 7.5, 10.5, 13.5, 16.5 respectively. Then, for each decade, it labels the number of stamps for each country.

Looking at the code:

For the 50s decade:
- Brazil: 4 stamps
- France: 8
- Peru: 6
- Spain: 3

For the 60s:
- Brazil: 6
- France: 7
- Peru: 4
- Spain: 9

For the 70s:
- Brazil: 12
- France: 12
- Peru: 12
- Spain: 6

For the 80s:
- Brazil: 8
- France: 15
- Peru: 10
- Spain: 9

So, the numbers are for each country in each decade. Got it. So, for the 70s, each country has a certain number of stamps: Brazil 12, France 12, Peru 12, Spain 6.

Now, the question is about the average price of his '70s stamps. Hmm, so I need to calculate the total cost of all the '70s stamps and then divide by the total number of '70s stamps to get the average price per stamp.

First, let's figure out how many '70s stamps he has in total. That would be the sum of the stamps from each country in the 70s decade.

Looking at the numbers:
- Brazil: 12
- France: 12
- Peru: 12
- Spain: 6

So, total number of '70s stamps = 12 + 12 + 12 + 6. Let me calculate that.

12 + 12 = 24
24 + 12 = 36
36 + 6 = 42

So, 42 stamps in the '70s.

Now, I need to find the total cost of these 42 stamps. To do that, I need to know how much each country's stamps cost. The problem says:

- Brazil and France: 6 cents each
- Peru: 4 cents each
- Spain: 5 cents each

So, I can calculate the total cost for each country's '70s stamps and then sum them up.

Let's break it down:

1. Brazil: 12 stamps at 6 cents each.
   Total cost = 12 * 6 = 72 cents

2. France: 12 stamps at 6 cents each.
   Total cost = 12 * 6 = 72 cents

3. Peru: 12 stamps at 4 cents each.
   Total cost = 12 * 4 = 48 cents

4. Spain: 6 stamps at 5 cents each.
   Total cost = 6 * 5 = 30 cents

Now, add up all these amounts to get the total cost of the '70s stamps.

Total cost = 72 + 72 + 48 + 30

Calculating step by step:

72 + 72 = 144
144 + 48 = 192
192 + 30 = 222

So, the total cost is 222 cents.

Now, to find the average price per stamp, we divide the total cost by the total number of stamps.

Average price = Total cost / Number of stamps = 222 / 42

Let me compute that.

First, 42 goes into 222 how many times?

42 * 5 = 210

So, 222 - 210 = 12

So, that's 5 with a remainder of 12.

So, 222 / 42 = 5 + 12/42

Simplify 12/42: divide numerator and denominator by 6.

12 ÷ 6 = 2

42 ÷ 6 = 7

So, 12/42 = 2/7 ≈ 0.2857

Therefore, 222 / 42 ≈ 5.2857

Rounding to the nearest tenth of a cent: look at the hundredths place, which is 8, which is 5 or above, so we round up.

So, 5.3 cents.

Wait, hold on: 5.2857 is approximately 5.286, which is 5.29 when rounded to the nearest hundredth, but the question asks for the nearest tenth. So, 5.2857 is approximately 5.3 when rounded to the nearest tenth because the tenth place is 2, the hundredth is 8, which is more than 5, so we round up.

Wait, actually, 5.2857 is 5.29 when rounded to the nearest hundredth, but to the nearest tenth, we look at the first decimal place (2) and the next digit (8). Since 8 is greater than or equal to 5, we round up the 2 to a 3. Therefore, 5.3.

Alternatively, if I compute 222 divided by 42 exactly:

42 * 5 = 210, remainder 12.

12 divided by 42 is approximately 0.2857.

So, 5.2857.

Rounded to the nearest tenth: 5.3.

Therefore, the average price is 5.3 cents per stamp.

But let me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

Total number of '70s stamps:

12 (Brazil) + 12 (France) + 12 (Peru) + 6 (Spain) = 42. That seems correct.

Total cost:

12 * 6 = 72 (Brazil)
12 * 6 = 72 (France)
12 * 4 = 48 (Peru)
6 * 5 = 30 (Spain)

Total cost: 72 + 72 = 144; 144 + 48 = 192; 192 + 30 = 222. So, 222 cents.

222 divided by 42: Let's do this division again.

42 * 5 = 210

222 - 210 = 12

12 / 42 = 2/7 ≈ 0.2857

So, 5.2857... Rounded to the nearest tenth is indeed 5.3. So, the average price is 5.3 cents.

Wait, but let me make sure about the per-stamp average. Is it possible that I mixed up something?

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:

Average price = (Total cost) / (Total stamps)

Which is 222 / 42.

Let me do this division more precisely.

222 divided by 42.

42 goes into 222:

42 * 5 = 210

222 - 210 = 12

Bring down a zero: 120

42 goes into 120 twice (42 * 2 = 84)

120 - 84 = 36

Bring down another zero: 360

42 goes into 360 eight times (42 * 8 = 336)

360 - 336 = 24

Bring down another zero: 240

42 goes into 240 five times (42 * 5 = 210)

240 - 210 = 30

Bring down another zero: 300

42 goes into 300 seven times (42 * 7 = 294)

300 - 294 = 6

Bring down another zero: 60

42 goes into 60 once (42 * 1 = 42)

60 - 42 = 18

Bring down another zero: 180

42 goes into 180 four times (42 * 4 = 168)

180 - 168 = 12

Wait, now we have a remainder of 12 again, which is where we started after the first division.

So, putting it all together:

5.2857142857...

So, it's a repeating decimal: 5.2857142857..., with the block "285714" repeating.

So, when rounding to the nearest tenth, which is the first decimal place, we look at the second decimal place. The first decimal is 2, the second is 8. Since 8 is greater than or equal to 5, we round up the 2 to a 3. Therefore, 5.3.

So, the average price is 5.3 cents per stamp.

I think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the answer is 5.3 cents.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5.3}
</think>

Juan organizes his stamp collection by country and by the decade in which they were issued. The prices he paid were: Brazil and France at 6 cents each, Peru at 4 cents each, and Spain at 5 cents each. The Asymptote figure shows the number of stamps for each country in each decade.

For the 70s decade:
- Brazil: 12 stamps
- France: 12 stamps
- Peru: 12 stamps
- Spain: 6 stamps

First, we calculate the total number of 70s stamps:
\[
12 + 12 + 12 + 6 = 42
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for each country's 70s stamps:
- Brazil: \(12 \times 6 = 72\) cents
- France: \(12 \times 6 = 72\) cents
- Peru: \(12 \times 4 = 48\) cents
- Spain: \(6 \times 5 = 30\) cents

Adding these amounts gives the total cost:
\[
72 + 72 + 48 + 30 = 222 \text{ cents}
\]

To find the average price per stamp, we divide the total cost by the total number of stamps:
\[
\frac{222}{42} \approx 5.2857
\]

Rounding 5.2857 to the nearest tenth gives 5.3.

Thus, the average price of his 70s stamps is \(\boxed{5.3}\) cents.
