Question:
Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, how much did she make from lemonade sales?

Correct Answer:
At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars
Since the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.
Adding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars
Subtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars
Tasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.
#### 26

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this problem here about Tasha earning money last month by selling lemonade and mowing lawns. She made a total of $80, and I need to figure out how much she made from lemonade sales. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's read the problem again carefully:

- Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
- The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.
- The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
- How much did she make from lemonade sales?

Hmm, okay. So, Tasha made money from two activities: selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The total she made was $80. Out of this, she earned $6 from Joe's lawn because that's what she was paid for her work. But wait, no, actually, the problem says Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. So, does that mean she only made $6 from mowing lawns, specifically from Joe's? Or does it mean she made $6 in total from mowing lawns? Hmm, probably specifically from Joe's because that's mentioned in the context of the first and second weeks.

Wait, let me try to parse this again. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, in the first week, she mowed Kamala 3 times as much as Joe. The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. So, in the second week, she mowed Alba 5 times as much as Joe did.

So, she mowed lawns for two weeks: first week, Kamala's lawn 3 times as often as Joe's, and second week, Alba's lawn 5 times as often as Joe's. So, she spent two weeks mowing lawns, and each week she mowed lawns for Joe. So, Joe's lawn was mowed by her in both weeks, but different numbers: first week 3 times, second week 5 times. So, her total mowing for Joe's lawn would be 3 + 5 = 8 times.

But wait, does that mean she earned $6 total for mowing lawns? Because the problem says she was paid $6 for her work. Wait, is that referring to all her work? Or is it per week? Hmm, the problem says, "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work." Since she mowed Joe's lawn both weeks, it's possible that she was paid $6 in total for all her mowing work. Or maybe it's per week? But the wording is "for her work," which is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, let me think. If it's $6 for her work, and she mowed lawns in two weeks, maybe she was paid $6 per lawn, but that seems high. Alternatively, she was paid $6 in total for all her mowing work, but then she also made money from selling lemonade. So, total income is $80, which includes both lemonade and mowing.

Wait, let me read the problem again:

"Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, how much did she make from lemonade sales?"

So, "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work." So, that $6 is for her mowing work, right? So, that's her income from mowing lawns. So, her total income is $80, which is from both lemonade and mowing. So, if she made $6 from mowing, then the rest must be from lemonade. So, 80 - 6 = 74? So, she made $74 from lemonade. Is that the answer? Wait, that seems too straightforward, but let me check.

Wait, maybe not. Because perhaps Joe paid her $6 per week for her work? But the problem says "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work." It doesn't specify per week or total. If it's total, then her mowing income is $6, and lemonade income is $74. But it's possible that it's per week. Let me see.

Wait, the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed lawns in two weeks, both times mowing Joe's lawn as well. So, if she was paid $6 for her work, perhaps that's for both weeks? So, her total mowing income is $6.

But wait, actually, mowing lawns in two weeks, so maybe she earned $6 for each week? But the wording is "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work." So, unless it's ambiguous, but in the problem, she was paid $6 for her work overall. So, perhaps her total mowing income is $6, so her lemonade income is 80 - 6 = 74. So, $74.

But let me make sure. It might be that she was paid $6 per week, so 6 * 2 = 12, but that seems less likely because the problem says "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work." It doesn't specify total or per week.

Wait, another thought: she made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The total income is $80. Some of that is from selling lemonade, some from mowing lawns. If Joe paid her $6 for her work, which is part of her mowing income, so her mowing income is $6, and her lemonade income is 80 - 6 = 74.

But let me think again. Is it possible that the $6 is per lawn mowed? So, she mowed Joe's lawn three times in the first week and five times in the second week, so total of 8 times. If she was paid $6 for mowing all those lawns, then her rate is 6 / 8 = $0.75 per lawn.

But then, the problem didn't specify how much she was paid per lawn, so maybe that's overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem doesn't say anything about her pay per lawn. It just says Joe paid her $6 for her work. So, if her total mowing income is $6, then her lemonade income is $74.

But hold on, is there more to this? Because the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. So, perhaps the number of times she mowed lawns is different for each person, but she was paid $6 for her work. So, maybe "her work" refers to both weeks, so total mowing.

Alternatively, if she was paid $6 per week, that would be 12 total, but that seems inconsistent with the problem statement.

Wait, maybe she was paid $6 per week, so she made 6 * 2 = 12 from mowing, but that doesn't seem to add up.

Wait, the problem says she made a total of $80 from both lemonade and mowing. If she made $6 from mowing, then $74 from lemonade. Alternatively, if she made $6 per week, that would be 12, so lemonade would be 80 - 12 = 68.

But the problem says "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work." It doesn't specify per week or total. So, maybe she was paid $6 total for mowing both weeks. So, her mowing income is $6, total, and lemonade is $74.

But let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe she was paid $6 per week for her work, which would be $6 * 2 = $12, so her total mowing income is $12, so her lemonade income is 80 - 12 = $68.

But which is it? The problem says "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work." It's ambiguous. But in the context of the problem, since it's about mowing lawns, and she mowed lawns in two weeks, the $6 is probably referring to the total she was paid for all her mowing work.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned specifically in the context of the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, perhaps the $6 is for mowing Kamala's lawn, but no, that's not specified.

Wait, no, Joe paid her $6 for her work, which is just a single amount, so it's likely her total mowing income is $6, so the rest is lemonade. Therefore, 80 - 6 = 74.

But let me try to see if the problem can be interpreted differently. Maybe the amount she made from mowing is calculated based on the number of times she mowed each lawn, but then she was paid per lawn.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that she was paid per lawn. It just says Joe paid her $6 for her work. So, maybe she was paid $6 total for mowing both weeks. Therefore, her lemonade income is 80 - 6 = 74.

Alternatively, maybe her payment is based on the number of times she mowed. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's in the first week, and Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's in the second week. So, the total number of times she mowed is 3 + 5 = 8 times Joe's. But if Joe paid her $6 for her work, that might mean she was paid per lawn.

Wait, but if she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times and Alba's lawn 5 times, but Joe's lawn once each week, so total mowing is 3 (Kamala) + 5 (Alba) + 1 (Joe) + 1 (Joe) = 10 times? Wait, no, that's if she mowed each lawn each week.

Wait, actually, let's clarify.

First week: She mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times and Joe's lawn, say, x times.

Second week: She mowed Alba's lawn 5 times and Joe's lawn, x times.

Wait, but the problem says, "The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's." So, if she did Joe's lawn x times in the first week, then Kamala's lawn is 3x.

Similarly, in the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. So, if she did Joe's lawn y times in the second week, then Alba's lawn is 5y.

But the problem doesn't specify whether she mowed Joe's lawn the same number of times each week or not. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the key is that it's the same number of times. Maybe Joe's lawn was mowed the same number of times each week, so in both weeks, she mowed Joe's lawn, say, n times, so Kamala's was 3n in the first week, and Alba's was 5n in the second week.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify that she mowed Joe's lawn the same number of times each week. It just says in the first week, she mowed Kamala's thrice as many as Joe's, and in the second week, she mowed Alba's five times as many as Joe's. So, Joe's lawn could have been mowed a different number of times each week.

Hmm, but without knowing how many times she mowed Joe's lawn each week, we can't calculate her earnings from that.

Wait, but the problem says "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work." So, maybe that $6 is in addition to her lemonade sales? Or is it her total earnings?

Wait, the problem says she made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. So, total income is $80. Out of that, she made some from lemonade and some from mowing. The $6 is Joe's payment for her work, which is part of her mowing income.

So, her total mowing income is $6, so her lemonade income is $74.

But that seems too straightforward, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work" refers to the fact that she was paid $6 per lawn mowed. So, her earnings from mowing would be based on the number of lawns she mowed.

So, let's try that approach.

First, we need to find out how many times she mowed each lawn and then calculate her earnings.

But we don't know how many times she mowed each lawn, except in relation to Joe's lawn.

Wait, let's denote variables.

Let me try to set up some variables.

Let n be the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn in the first week.

Then, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3n times.

In the second week, let m be the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.

Then, she mowed Alba's lawn 5m times.

So, her total mowing work is:

First week: 3n (Kamala) + n (Joe) = 4n

Second week: 5m (Alba) + m (Joe) = 6m

Total mowing lawns: 4n + 6m

But we don't know n and m. However, if "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work," that might be referring to her total mowing income.

But without knowing her pay rate, we can't calculate her total mowing income.

Wait, but maybe Joe paid her $6 in total for her mowing work, so her total mowing income is $6, so her lemonade income is 80 - 6 = 74.

But the problem didn't specify her pay rate per lawn, so maybe that's the interpretation.

Alternatively, if she was paid per lawn, then her total mowing income would be 6 times the number of lawns she mowed, but since we don't know how many lawns she mowed, unless we can figure it out from the given information.

Wait, but if we don't know the number of times she mowed each lawn, except in proportion to Joe's lawn, we can't calculate the exact number of lawns. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted differently.

Wait, perhaps "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work" is referring to the fact that she was paid $6 for her mowing work, which is her only income. So, she made $6 from mowing, and the rest from lemonade. So, 80 - 6 = 74.

Alternatively, if she was paid $6 per week, so two weeks, she made 12 from mowing, so lemonade is 80 - 12 = 68.

But the problem says "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work." It's ambiguous, but in the context of the problem, since she was mowing lawns in two weeks, and the payment is $6, it's more likely that $6 is the total payment for her mowing work, so her mowing income is $6, and lemonade is 74.

But wait, hold on. If it's $6 per week, then that's $6 * 2 = 12, so her mowing income is 12, lemonade is 80 - 12 = 68.

But which interpretation is correct? The problem is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, let's read the problem again:

"Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, how much did she make from lemonade sales?"

So, she made $80 total, which includes both lemonade and mowing. Joe paid her $6 for her work, which is her mowing income.

So, her total mowing income is $6, so lemonade income is 80 - 6 = 74.

Therefore, the answer is $74.

But wait, hold on. Maybe "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work" is referring to her total payment for the two weeks, meaning she was paid $6 each week, so total mowing income is 12, so lemonade is 68.

But how can we know? The problem says "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work." It could be interpreted as she was paid $6 in total for her work, which is mowing.

Alternatively, it could be interpreted as per week. But in the problem statement, she mowed in two weeks, so it's not clear.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe "her work" refers to the mowing, so she was paid $6 for mowing, so her mowing income is $6, and lemonade is 74.

Alternatively, if it's her total income, then she made $80, and $6 of that was from mowing, so lemonade is 74.

Alternatively, if "her work" refers to both mowing and lemonade, but that seems unlikely because lemonade isn't mowing.

Wait, but the problem says "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work." Since she worked two weeks, mowing lawns, and Joe paid her $6 for that work, it's likely that the $6 is her total mowing income.

Therefore, her total mowing income is $6, so her lemonade income is 80 - 6 = 74.

So, the answer is $74.

But let me check my reasoning again.

Total income: $80

Mowing income: $6

Lemonade income: 80 - 6 = 74

That seems straightforward, but let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the $6 is her payment per week, so she made 6 * 2 = 12 from mowing, so lemonade is 80 - 12 = 68.

But the problem says "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work." If it's $6 per week, it would probably say "each week" or "per week." Since it doesn't, it's more likely that it's a total payment of $6 for both weeks. So, her mowing income is $6, so lemonade is 74.

Therefore, I think the answer is $74.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{74}
</think>

Tasha made a total of $80 last month from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. She was paid $6 by Joe for her work, which is her total mowing income. Therefore, her income from lemonade sales is calculated by subtracting her mowing income from her total income.

\[
\text{Total income} = \$80
\]
\[
\text{Mowing income} = \$6
\]
\[
\text{Lemonade income} = \text{Total income} - \text{Mowing income} = \$80 - \$6 = \$74
\]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is \(\boxed{74}\).
