Question:
Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Correct Answer:
Pat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.
Pat needs to buy 74 plants - 17 plants = <<74-17=57>>57 plants needed to purchase.
Pat will spend 57 plants * $6 = $<<57*6=342>>342.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Pat has this flower bed that's 111 feet long. She wants to fill it up with her flowers, which grow 12 inches wide. Hmm, wait, 12 inches is a foot, right? So each flower needs a space of 12 inches, which is 1 foot. But she also wants to leave 1.5 feet between every plant. Hmm, so that means each plant, including the space between them, takes up 1 foot for the plant and 1.5 feet for the gap. So each plant effectively needs 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet of space? 

Wait, let me make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. If each plant is 12 inches (which is 1 foot) wide and she needs 1.5 feet between each plant, does that mean the total space between two plants is 1.5 feet? So, if you have two plants, each taking 1 foot, and 1.5 feet between them, the total length they occupy would be 1 + 1.5 + 1 = 3.5 feet? Yeah, that seems right. So for each additional plant beyond the first one, you add 1 foot for the plant and 1.5 feet for the space. So, the total space per plant after the first one is 2.5 feet.

But wait, maybe I should approach this differently. The flower bed is 111 feet long. Each plant needs 1 foot of space, and then 1.5 feet between each plant. So, the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed depends on the spacing. 

I remember that in planting, the number of plants is not just the total length divided by the space per plant, because you have to account for the spaces between them. So, if you have n plants, the total length they occupy is n*(plant width) + (n-1)*spacing. So, in this case, that would be n*(1 foot) + (n-1)*(1.5 feet). 

So, equation: n + 1.5*(n - 1) ≤ 111. Let me write that down:

n + 1.5(n - 1) ≤ 111.

Let's solve for n. 

First, distribute the 1.5:

n + 1.5n - 1.5 ≤ 111.

Combine like terms:

(1 + 1.5)n - 1.5 ≤ 111.

2.5n - 1.5 ≤ 111.

Add 1.5 to both sides:

2.5n ≤ 112.5.

Divide both sides by 2.5:

n ≤ 45.

So, n is 45. So, she can plant 45 flowers in the bed. But wait, she already owns 17 flowers. So, she doesn't need to buy all 45. She already has 17, so she needs 45 - 17 = 28 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6. So, the total cost is 28 * $6. Let me calculate that.

28 * 6: 20*6 is 120, and 8*6 is 48, so 120 + 48 = 168.

So, she will spend $168 at the store.

Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the total length of the flower bed is 111 feet. Each plant is 1 foot wide, and 1.5 feet between each. So, for n plants, the total length is n + 1.5(n - 1). So, n + 1.5n - 1.5 = 2.5n - 1.5. So, 2.5n - 1.5 ≤ 111.

Adding 1.5: 2.5n ≤ 112.5.

Divide by 2.5: n ≤ 45. So, maximum 45 plants. She has 17, so she needs 28 more. 28 * 6 = 168. Yeah, that seems right.

But just to make sure, let me visualize it. If she plants 45 flowers, each 1 foot apart with 1.5 feet between them, how much space does that take? So, each flower after the first requires 1.5 feet of space (1 foot for the flower and 1.5 feet between it and the previous one). Wait, no, actually, the total length is the sum of all the plant widths and the gaps between them.

So, 45 plants: each takes 1 foot, so 45 feet. The gaps between them are 44 gaps, each 1.5 feet, so 44 * 1.5 = 66 feet. So total length is 45 + 66 = 111 feet. Perfect, that's exactly the length of the flower bed. So, 45 plants fit exactly.

She already has 17, so she needs 45 - 17 = 28 more. Each at $6, so 28 * 6 = 168. So, the total money she'll spend is $168.

I think that's correct. But let me make sure there isn't a different interpretation. For example, sometimes when people say "1.5 feet between every plant," they might be referring to the center-to-center distance, which would be different from the gap between the plants. But in this context, the problem says "she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant." I think that refers to the space between them, not the center-to-center. So, with that, our calculation stands.

Alternatively, if it was center-to-center, then each plant plus 1.5 feet would be the spacing. But I think in gardening terms, "between every plant" is the space between them, so 1.5 feet apart. So, the gap between each plant is 1.5 feet, so our initial calculation is correct.

Therefore, the answer is $168.

**Final Answer**
Pat will spend \boxed{168} dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed.
</think>

Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long. Each flower grows 12 inches (1 foot) wide and needs to be spaced 1.5 feet apart. To determine how many plants she can fit, we use the equation for the total length occupied by \( n \) plants:

\[ n + 1.5(n - 1) \leq 111 \]

Solving for \( n \):

\[ n + 1.5n - 1.5 \leq 111 \]
\[ 2.5n - 1.5 \leq 111 \]
\[ 2.5n \leq 112.5 \]
\[ n \leq 45 \]

Pat can plant 45 flowers. Since she already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy:

\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \]

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost is:

\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Thus, Pat will spend \boxed{168} dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed.
