Question:
Marin and his neighbor Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. How many apples do they eat in 30 days?

Correct Answer:
In one day, Marin and Nancy eat 4 + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5 apples.
In 30 days, they eat 30 * 5 = <<30*5=150>>150 apples.
#### 150

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this problem here: Marin and his neighbor Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. How many apples do they eat in 30 days? Hmm, let me think about how to solve this step by step.

First off, I need to figure out how many apples each person eats in a day and then extend that over 30 days. Since both Marin and Nancy eat 4 apples each day, I can calculate their combined consumption. Let me write that down.

Marin eats 4 apples/day, and Nancy also eats 4 apples/day. So together, in one day, they eat 4 + 4 apples. Let me compute that: 4 + 4 is 8. So, combined, they eat 8 apples each day.

Now, the question is asking about 30 days. So, I need to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days. That means I have to multiply the number of apples they eat in one day by 30. 

So, 8 apples/day multiplied by 30 days. Hmm, let me compute that. 8 times 30. I know that 8 times 10 is 80, so 8 times 30 should be three times that, right? Because 30 is three times 10. So, 80 times 3 is 240.

Wait, let me check that again. If I do 8 times 30, that's the same as 8 multiplied by 3 multiplied by 10. 8 times 3 is 24, and 24 times 10 is 240. Yep, that's correct.

So, putting it all together, in one day, they eat 8 apples, and over 30 days, that would be 240 apples. 

Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning. So, step one: each person eats 4 apples per day. Step two: adding both together gives 8 apples per day. Step three: multiplying 8 by 30 gives 240 apples. That seems straight forward.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe by calculating how many apples each person eats in 30 days individually and then adding them together. Let me try that approach to verify.

Marin eats 4 apples each day, so in 30 days, he eats 4 times 30, which is 120 apples. Similarly, Nancy eats 4 apples each day, so in 30 days, she eats 4 times 30, which is also 120 apples. Adding their totals together, 120 plus 120 is 240 apples. Yep, that's the same answer I got before.

So, that seems to confirm that the total number of apples they eat together in 30 days is 240. I don't think I missed anything here. It's a pretty straightforward multiplication problem.

Another way to think about it is to consider the total number of days and the number of apples per day. Since they each eat 4 apples a day, together they eat 8 apples a day. So, over 30 days, it's 8 times 30, which is 240. 

I guess another thing to be careful about is making sure I didn't confuse the number of apples each person eats with the number of days. But in this case, since both are eating 4 apples each day, it was straightforward to add their daily consumption and then multiply by the number of days.

I could also visualize it. If I imagine a calendar for 30 days, each day both Marin and Nancy eat 4 apples. So, each day, 8 apples are being consumed. Over the entire 30 days, that adds up to 30 times 8, which is 240.

Is there a possibility that I misread the question? Let me check again. It says, "Marin and his neighbor Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. How many apples do they eat in 30 days?" So, each of them individually eats 4 apples a day, so combined, 8 per day. 30 days times that. Yep, that's correct.

I was wondering if it was a trick question where maybe they don't eat apples every day or something, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It just says they each eat 4 apples a day, so I think it's safe to assume they eat 4 apples every day without fail.

Another thing to consider is the units. The problem gives apples per day, so when we multiply by days, the days unit cancels out, leaving us with apples. That makes sense because we're calculating the total apples consumed over a period of time.

So, I think I'm confident that 240 is the correct answer. Both methods, calculating their combined daily consumption and then multiplying by 30, and calculating each person's consumption separately and then adding, give me the same result. So, I don't see any reason to doubt that 240 is correct.

Wait, just to be absolutely thorough, let me break it down day by day for a smaller number of days to see if the pattern holds. Let's say, for example, in 1 day, together they eat 8 apples. In 2 days, that's 16 apples. In 3 days, 24 apples. So, it's 8 multiplied by the number of days. So, for 30 days, it's 8 times 30, which is 240. That seems consistent.

Alternatively, if I think about it per person, in 30 days, each person eats 4 times 30, which is 120. So, two people would eat 240. Yeah, that still works.

I guess another way to think about it is by using multiplication properties. 4 apples per day is the same as 4/1 apples per day. So, over 30 days, it's 4/1 multiplied by 30, which is 120 apples per person. Then, since there are two people, 120 times 2 is 240. 

Alternatively, if I think about it as 4 apples multiplied by 30 days for each person, that's 120 apples each. So, adding both, 120 plus 120 is 240.

I think I've covered several ways to approach this problem, and they all lead to the same answer. So, unless I made a calculation error in the multiplication, which I double-checked, I think 240 is correct.

Just to be extra cautious, let me compute 8 multiplied by 30 again. 8 times 10 is 80, 8 times 20 is 160, and 8 times 30 is 240. Yep, that's correct.

So, I think I'm confident that the total number of apples they eat together in 30 days is 240.

**Final Answer**
The total number of apples they eat in 30 days is \boxed{240}.
</think>

Marin and his neighbor Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. To find out how many apples they eat together in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apples they eat together in one day:
   \[
   4 \text{ apples/day (Marin)} + 4 \text{ apples/day (Nancy)} = 8 \text{ apples/day}
   \]

2. Multiply the total number of apples they eat in one day by the number of days (30):
   \[
   8 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ apples}
   \]

Thus, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is \(\boxed{240}\).
