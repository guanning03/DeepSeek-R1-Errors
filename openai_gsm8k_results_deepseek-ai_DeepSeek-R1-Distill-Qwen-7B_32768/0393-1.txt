Question:
My wife wants to evenly split the check but wants me to pay an additional 20% tip on our $50 dinner bill. How much did I end up paying?

Correct Answer:
If the total bill is $50, the total tip of 20% would be $50*20% = $<<50*20*.01=10>>10
Similarly, if the bill was $50 an even split (1/2) would be $50 * 1/2 = $<<50*1/2=25>>25 to be paid by each person
That means I paid $25 for the bill + $10 for the tip = $<<25+10=35>>35

30

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total amount of the dinner bill, which is $50.

Next, I should determine the additional 20% tip that needs to be added to the bill. To do this, I'll calculate 20% of $50.

After calculating the tip, I'll add it to the original bill to find the total amount that needs to be split between my wife and me.

Finally, I'll divide the total amount by two to find out how much each person owes.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much you ended up paying.

**Step 1: Determine the Total Bill**

The dinner bill is \$50.

\[
\text{Total Bill} = \$50
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the Additional 20% Tip**

You want to add an additional 20% tip to the bill. To find out how much the tip is:

\[
\text{Tip} = 20\% \times \$50 = 0.20 \times \$50 = \$10
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the Total Amount to Split**

Add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = \text{Total Bill} + \text{Tip} = \$50 + \$10 = \$60
\]

**Step 4: Split the Total Amount Equally**

Since you want to split the total amount evenly between you and your wife:

\[
\text{Amount Each Person Pays} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{2} = \frac{\$60}{2} = \$30
\]

**Final Answer**

You ended up paying \(\boxed{\$30}\).
