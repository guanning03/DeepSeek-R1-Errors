Question:
In one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more. How many books have they read altogether?

Correct Answer:
If Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more in the next hour, he has read a total of 300+150=<<300+150=450>>450
Since Ezra reads twice as many books as Ahmed, Ahmed has read 450/2=<<450/2=225>>225 books.
Together, Ahmed and Ezra has read 225+450=<<225+450=675>>675 books
#### 675

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out how many books Ezra and Ahmed have read altogether. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, it says that in one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. So, if I let the number of books Ahmed read be something, maybe a variable, then Ezra read twice that amount. The problem doesn't give me the exact number, but it does tell me that Ezra has already read 300 books this hour.

Wait, hold on. If Ezra read twice as many as Ahmed, and he read 300 books, then Ahmed must have read half of that, right? Because if Ezra is twice as much, then Ahmed is half. So, let me calculate that.

Ezra read 300 books. That's twice as much as Ahmed. So, if I let Ahmed's count be A, then:

Ezra = 2 * Ahmed
300 = 2 * A

So, A = 300 / 2 = 150. So, Ahmed read 150 books in that hour. Got that.

But then the problem says, "Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more." Hmm, so does that mean he read an additional 150 books after the initial 300? So, in total, does that make his total reading 300 + 150?

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says, "In one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed." So, that one hour, he read 300. Then, he decided to read 150 more, but does that mean 150 more in that same hour, or in addition to that hour?

Hmm, that's a bit unclear. Let me think. If the initial statement is about one hour, then the "decided to read 150 more" â€“ does that mean in that same hour? But he already read 300 in that hour. So, maybe that 150 is separate.

Wait, the problem says, "In one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more." So, maybe first, in one hour, he read 300, which is twice as much as Ahmed. Then, he decided to read 150 more. So, maybe 150 more in addition to that hour.

Wait, but that might not make much sense because if he's reading 300 in one hour, then reading 150 more would be in another hour, making it two hours? The problem says "this hour," so maybe only one hour. So, perhaps he read 300 in that hour, and decided to read 150 more, but does that mean he read 150 more in addition to that hour or as part of the same hour?

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the sentence: "In one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more." So, maybe the "in one hour" is a separate statement, and the 300 is the total for that hour. Then he read 150 more outside of that hour? But the problem is asking for how many they've read altogether. So, perhaps I should consider the total.

Wait, let me read the problem again:

"In one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more. How many books have they read altogether?"

So, it seems that in one hour, Ezra read twice as much as Ahmed. But since it's saying that "Ezra has read 300 books this hour," that must mean that in that one hour, he read 300, which is twice as much as Ahmed, so Ahmed read 150. Then, "and decided to read 150 more." Hmm, so is that in addition to the 300, making his total 450? Or is it that he's going to read 150 more in the same hour? But since it's separated by "this hour," maybe it's in addition.

Wait, but the problem is asking for how many books they have read altogether. So, it's probably asking for the total number of books both have read, regardless of the time. So, perhaps we need to consider both their readings.

Wait, but the problem says "how many books have they read altogether," which would be the sum of both their readings. So, if in one hour, Ezra read twice as much as Ahmed, and he read 300, so Ahmed read 150. Then, he decided to read 150 more. So, perhaps he read 300 in that hour and 150 more, making it 450. So, in total, he's read 450, and Ahmed has read 150.

So, altogether, they've read 450 + 150 = 600 books.

Wait, but the wording is a bit unclear. Let me parse it again.

"In one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more. How many books have they read altogether?"

So, the first part is about a one-hour period where Ezra read twice as much as Ahmed. Then, in that same hour, he has read 300 and decided to read 150 more. So, maybe that 150 is in addition to that hour.

Wait, so in that one hour, he read 300, which is twice as much as Ahmed. Then, in addition to that one hour, he read 150 more. So, maybe the 150 is in another hour? But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we're only considering the one hour.

Wait, no, the problem is asking for how many they have read altogether. So, that would include all the books they've read. So, if in that one hour, Ezra read 300 and decided to read 150 more. So, does that mean he has read 300 in that hour, and is going to read 150 more, but hasn't read those yet? Or is that 150 already part of the total?

Wait, the problem says "decided to read 150 more," which suggests that he has already read 300, and is planning to read an additional 150. So, maybe he will have read 450 in total, but I don't know if that 150 is included or not.

But the question is asking for how many they have read altogether, so that would be the sum of both their current readings. So, if he has read 300 in that hour and is going to read 150 more, but Ahmed has only read 150 in that hour, so together, they have read 300 + 150 + 150, which is 600.

Wait, but if the 150 is just in addition to that hour, meaning that he's going to read more, but hasn't read those yet, then his total would be 450, and Ahmed's is 150, so altogether, 600. So, regardless of whether the 150 is included or not, the total is 600.

Alternatively, if the 150 is in addition to the one hour, meaning that he read 300 in one hour, then 150 in another, so total 450, and Ahmed read 150 in that first hour, so altogether, 450 + 150 = 600.

So, either way, it's 600.

Wait, but hold on, let me make sure. Maybe the "decided to read 150 more" is in addition to the one hour, so in another hour, he read 150. So, if that's the case, then in the first hour, he read 300, and in the second hour, he read 150. So, total for Ezra is 450. And in the first hour, Ahmed read 150. So, the total is 450 + 150 = 600.

But the wording is a bit unclear. It says, "In one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more."

So, the "this hour" is referring to the one hour where he read twice as much as Ahmed, which was 300. So, he read 300 in that hour, and decided to read 150 more. So, that 150 is in addition to that hour, meaning in another hour. So, in total, he has read 300 + 150 = 450.

But the problem is about how many they have read altogether. So, I think we need to consider all the books both have read. So, in one hour, Ezra read 300, which is twice as much as Ahmed's 150. Then, in another hour, Ezra read 150. So, in total, Ezra has read 300 + 150 = 450, and Ahmed has read 150. So, altogether, 450 + 150 = 600.

Alternatively, if the 150 is read in the same hour, so then in that hour, he read 300, and decided to read 150 more, meaning that he's going to read 150 in that same hour. So, in total, in that hour, he's going to read 300 + 150 = 450. But then, since the problem says "this hour," it might mean that he's going to read 150 more during that hour, so the total for that hour becomes 450. But the problem is, did he count those 150 as part of the one hour?

Wait, the problem says "Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more." So, in that hour, he read 300, and then decided to read 150 more. So, perhaps he's going to read 150 more in that same hour? But that would be a total of 450 in that hour.

But the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. "Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more." So, "has read" would mean that he already has read 300, and "decided to read 150 more," which might mean he's going to read 150 more after that. But in that case, "this hour" refers only to the 300. So, perhaps the 150 is in another hour.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me step back.

We know that in one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. So, if I let Ahmed's reading be A, then Ezra read 2A. But the problem says that in that hour, Ezra read 300 books. So, 2A = 300 => A = 150. So, in that hour, Ahmed read 150, Ezra read 300.

Now, the problem says, "Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more." So, "this hour" is the hour in which he read 300, so "decided to read 150 more." So, is he going to read 150 more in that hour, or in addition to that hour? The "this hour" seems to refer to the one hour where he read 300. So, perhaps he's going to read 150 more in that same hour, making it 450. But that would be a lot for one hour.

Alternatively, the 150 is in addition to that hour, so in another hour, he read 150. So, in total, he's read 300 + 150 = 450. But the problem is about how many they have read altogether, not considering the time.

So, perhaps the total number of books they've read is the sum of all books each has read, regardless of the time. So, in that one hour, Ezra read 300, Ahmed read 150. Additionally, Ezra decided to read 150 more. So, is that 150 already included in the 300? No, because he decided to read 150 more, meaning he's going to read them in addition to the 300. So, perhaps in total, he's going to read 450, but the question is asking for how many they have read altogether, so 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600.

Alternatively, if the 150 is in another hour, then in total, Ezra has read 300 + 150 = 450, and Ahmed has read 150, so altogether, 600.

Either way, it's 600. So, the total number of books they've read altogether is 600.

But just to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations:

1. If "decided to read 150 more" is in addition to the one hour, meaning he will read another 150, then his total is 450, and Ahmed's is 150, so together 600.

2. If "decided to read 150 more" is in the same hour, meaning he's going to read 150 during that hour, making his total for that hour 450, and Ahmed's is 150, so together 600.

Either way, the total is 600.

So, I think the answer is 600 books altogether.

**Final Answer**
The total number of books they have read altogether is \boxed{600}.
</think>

First, we know that in one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Let \( A \) be the number of books Ahmed read in that hour. Therefore, Ezra read \( 2A \) books. Given that Ezra read 300 books in that hour, we have:

\[ 2A = 300 \]
\[ A = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, Ahmed read 150 books in that hour. 

Ezra then decided to read 150 more books. This means in addition to the 300 books he read in the first hour, he read another 150 books. Therefore, Ezra's total reading is:

\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Ahmed read 150 books in the same hour. 

To find the total number of books they have read altogether, we add the books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:

\[ 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Thus, the total number of books they have read altogether is \(\boxed{600}\).
