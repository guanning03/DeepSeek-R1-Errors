Question:
Britany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week. She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs to sing on TikTok, and 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup before filming herself for TikTok. How much time does Britany spend on TikTok in a month with four weeks?

Correct Answer:
First find how long Britany spends recording the videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes
Then find how long she spends writing songs in minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes
Then find how long Britany spending doing her makeup in a week: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week
Then add the time she spends on videos and song-writing to find the total time she spends on TikTok in a week: 72 minutes/week + 90 minutes/week + 120 minutes/week = <<72+90+120=282>>282 minutes/week
Then multiply the time spent per week by the number of weeks per month to find the total time spent per month: 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes/month
#### 1128

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month. She does a few things each week, and I have to add up all her weekly activities and then multiply by four weeks to get the monthly total. Let me break it down step by step.

First, Britany records 18 TikTok videos every week, and each video is 4 minutes long. Hmm, so I need to calculate how much time she spends just recording videos. That should be 18 videos multiplied by 4 minutes per video. Let me write that down:

18 videos/week * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week.

Okay, so she spends 72 minutes a week just recording her videos. That seems manageable.

Next, she spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs for TikTok. Hmm, I should convert that into minutes because the other activities are in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is:

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes/week.

Got it. So another 120 minutes a week writing songs.

Then, she does her makeup six days a week, and each day she spends 15 minutes on it. Alright, so let me figure out how much time that is per week. She does this six days a week, so:

6 days/week * 15 minutes/day = 90 minutes/week.

So, 90 minutes a week on makeup.

Now, to find the total time she spends on TikTok each week, I need to add up all these times: recording videos, writing songs, and makeup. Let me add them up:

72 minutes (videos) + 120 minutes (songs) + 90 minutes (makeup) = 282 minutes/week.

Hmm, 282 minutes each week. That seems like a lot, but maybe it's okay for content creation.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. She records 18 videos, each 4 minutes. 18*4 is indeed 72. She writes songs for 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. She does makeup six days a week at 15 minutes each, which adds up to 90 minutes. So 72+120 is 192, plus 90 is 282. Yep, that adds up.

Now, to find out how much she spends in a month, assuming four weeks, I need to multiply the weekly total by 4.

282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes/month.

Hmm, 1128 minutes. That's a big number. Maybe I should convert that into hours to make it more understandable.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so let me divide 1128 by 60.

1128 รท 60 = 18.8 hours.

So, approximately 18.8 hours a month. Let me verify that division. 60 goes into 1128 how many times? 60*18 is 1080, 1128-1080 is 48, so that's 18 hours and 48 minutes, which is 18.8 hours. Yep, that's correct.

But wait, before finalizing, let me double-check all the calculations because sometimes I make mistakes.

18 videos * 4 minutes = 72. Correct.

2 hours = 120 minutes. Correct.

6 days * 15 minutes = 90 minutes. Correct.

72 + 120 + 90 = 282. Correct.

282 * 4 = 1128 minutes. Correct.

1128 / 60 = 18.8 hours. Correct.

So, all the steps check out. Therefore, Britany spends 18.8 hours on TikTok in a month. Since the question asks for the time spent, it might be better to present it in hours and minutes for clarity. So, 18 hours and 48 minutes.

Alternatively, if they prefer it in minutes, 1128 minutes. But since the question says "how much time," either would be acceptable, but maybe hours are more intuitive.

Wait, let me check if they want it in a specific format. The question is in minutes and hours, so giving it in both might be good, but perhaps the problem expects it in hours, especially since they mentioned weeks and months.

Alternatively, maybe they just want the total in hours, which is 18.8 hours.

But, let me see. 1128 minutes divided by 60 is exactly 18.8, which is 18 hours and 48 minutes. So, if I present it as 18 hours and 48 minutes, that might be clearer.

But let me see if the problem expects it in a specific unit. The original question gives time in weeks, hours, and minutes, so maybe minutes is acceptable, but 1128 minutes is a bit unwieldy.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent it as 18.8 hours, which is a decimal. But sometimes, people prefer fractions. 0.8 hours is 0.8*60 = 48 minutes, so 18 and 48/60 hours, which simplifies to 18 and 4/5 hours, or 18 4/5 hours.

But I think 18.8 hours is fine.

Alternatively, if we want to present it as a fraction, 1128/60 simplifies. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1128 รท12=94, 60รท12=5. So, 94/5 hours, which is 18 and 4/5 hours, which is the same as 18.8 hours.

So, either way, 18.8 hours or 18 4/5 hours or 18 hours and 48 minutes.

But since the original question is in weeks with minutes and hours, maybe it's better to present the total in hours with the decimal.

Therefore, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is 18.8 hours.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me recast all the numbers:

18 videos * 4 minutes = 72 minutes.

2 hours = 120 minutes.

6 days * 15 minutes = 90 minutes.

72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes per week.

282 * 4 = 1128 minutes per month.

1128 /60 = 18.8 hours. Yep.

Alternatively, let me think about if there's another way to approach it. Maybe calculate each activity per week in hours and then add up, then multiply by four.

So, 18 videos at 4 minutes each: 72 minutes, which is 1.2 hours (since 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 72 is 1.2).

Writing songs: 120 minutes is 2 hours.

Makeup: 90 minutes is 1.5 hours.

So, adding those: 1.2 + 2 + 1.5 = 4.7 hours per week.

Then, 4.7 hours/week *4 weeks= 18.8 hours/month.

Same result. So that confirms it.

So, whether I convert to hours first or add up in minutes and then convert, I get the same answer. So, 18.8 hours is correct.

Alternatively, 18.8 hours is 18 hours and 48 minutes. So, if they prefer, 18:48 hours.

But the question doesn't specify, so either is fine.

Therefore, after all this calculation, I can confidently say that Britany spends 18.8 hours on TikTok in a month.

**Final Answer**
Britany spends \boxed{18.8} hours on TikTok in a month.
</think>

Britany records 18 TikTok videos each week, each lasting 4 minutes. She spends 2 hours a week writing songs and 15 minutes six days a week doing makeup. To find the total time she spends on TikTok in a month, we break down her weekly activities and then multiply by four.

1. Calculate the time spent recording videos:
   \[
   18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]

2. Convert the time spent writing songs from hours to minutes:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]

3. Calculate the time spent doing makeup:
   \[
   6 \text{ days/week} \times 15 \text{ minutes/day} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]

4. Add up all weekly activities:
   \[
   72 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 282 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]

5. Multiply the weekly total by four to get the monthly total:
   \[
   282 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes/month}
   \]

6. Convert the total monthly minutes into hours:
   \[
   1128 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 18.8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, Britany spends \boxed{18.8} hours on TikTok in a month.
