Question:
Vicki is planning a pop concert at her high school. The show will be 2 hours. She is allowing each group 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 minutes to exit the stage. If she allows a 10-minute intermission, how many groups can perform in the concert?

Correct Answer:
First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 – 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances.
Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.
Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.
#### 11

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here about Vicki planning a pop concert at her high school. The concert is going to be 2 hours long, and she has to figure out how many groups can perform. Each group needs 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and another 2 minutes to exit. Plus, there's a 10-minute intermission. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out the total duration of the concert. It says it's 2 hours, so I should convert that into minutes because all the other times are given in minutes. I know that 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 2 hours would be 2 times 60, which is 120 minutes. Got that down.

Now, the concert has several parts: each group getting on stage, performing, exiting, and then an intermission. So, I should calculate how much time each group takes in total, including their entrance, performance, and exit. Let's add those up: 2 minutes on stage, 6 minutes performing, and 2 minutes exiting. That's 2 + 6 + 2, which equals 10 minutes per group.

Wait, but there's also a 10-minute intermission. I need to figure out where this intermission fits in. Since it's an intermission, I think it's a break between performances. So, if there are multiple groups, the intermission comes after one group has finished and before the next one starts. So, for example, the first group goes on stage, then there's a 10-minute intermission, then the next group, and so on.

So, if I have 'n' number of groups, how much total time would that take? Each group needs 10 minutes, plus an intermission after each group except the last one. So, the total time would be (number of groups times 10 minutes) plus (number of intermissions times 10 minutes). Since there are n groups, the number of intermissions would be (n - 1). So, total time is 10n + 10(n - 1).

Wait, let me write that out again to make sure I get it right. Total time = (group time per group * number of groups) + (intermission time * number of intermissions). Since the intermission happens after each group except the last one, the number of intermissions is one less than the number of groups. So, that would be 10n + 10(n - 1). Let me compute that.

10n + 10(n - 1) simplifies to 10n + 10n - 10, which is 20n - 10. So, the total time taken by the groups and intermissions is 20n - 10 minutes. And this has to be less than or equal to the total concert time of 120 minutes.

So, I can set up the inequality: 20n - 10 ≤ 120. Now, I need to solve for n. Let me add 10 to both sides: 20n ≤ 130. Then, divide both sides by 20: n ≤ 6.5.

But wait, n has to be a whole number because you can't have half a group performing. So, n must be less than or equal to 6.5, which means the maximum number of groups is 6. Hmm, so is it 6 groups?

Let me verify that because sometimes when dealing with time, it's easy to make a mistake with the intermission placement.

So, if there are 6 groups, each taking 10 minutes (2+6+2), that's 6*10=60 minutes. Then, the intermissions: between each group, so 5 intermissions, each 10 minutes. That's 5*10=50 minutes. So, total time is 60 + 50=110 minutes.

But the concert is 120 minutes, so 110 minutes is within the time limit. Hmm, so that leaves 10 minutes unused. Wait, is that correct?

Alternatively, maybe the intermission is after each group, including the last one? But that doesn't make much sense. An intermission is usually a break between acts, so the last act would end, then there's the intermission, and then maybe the concert ends. Hmm, so if the concert is 120 minutes, and if we have 6 groups, each with 10 minutes, that's 60 minutes. Then, 5 intermissions of 10 minutes each, 50 minutes. So, 60 + 50=110. Then, the concert still has 10 minutes left. So, could there be another group? But that group would need 10 minutes, which would make the total time 120 minutes, but then the intermission after the seventh group would be unnecessary because the concert is over.

So, maybe it's 6 groups with 110 minutes and 10 minutes remaining. So, do we count that remaining 10 minutes as a full group? Well, each group needs 10 minutes, so 10 minutes is exactly enough for one group. But if we try to fit a group there, we would have an intermission after the seventh group, but since the concert is over, that intermission wouldn't be played. So, is it possible to have an extra group in those 10 minutes?

Alternatively, maybe the intermission is part of the total time, so if the intermission is after each group except the last one, so total intermission time is 10*(number of groups -1). Therefore, if we have n groups, total time is 10*n + 10*(n -1)=20n -10.

So, we have 20n -10 ≤120.

So, 20n ≤130, so n ≤6.5. So, n=6.

So, 6 groups, which take 6*10=60 minutes, and 5 intermissions, which take 5*10=50 minutes, so total of 110 minutes. The concert is 120 minutes, so 10 minutes are left.

So, can we squeeze in another group?

Wait, if we have 6 groups, each with 10 minutes, and 5 intermissions, that is 110 minutes. Then, the remaining 10 minutes can allow another group to perform, but without an intermission because the concert would end.

So, is that acceptable? But the problem says she is allowing a 10-minute intermission, but it doesn't specify whether that intermission must be between groups or if it's just an allowed break. So, perhaps the intermission is a fixed 10-minute break, and the groups can be scheduled around it.

Alternatively, maybe the 10-minute intermission is a set break, so in the total time, you can have a single 10-minute intermission somewhere, and then groups on either side.

Wait, maybe I need to model this differently. Let's think of the concert as having slots: each slot consists of a group performing, which takes 6 minutes, plus entrance and exit times, which take 4 minutes (2 each). So, each group's performance time is 10 minutes, as I calculated before.

Then, if we have n groups, each taking 10 minutes, plus an intermission of 10 minutes. If the intermission is after the first group, then the total time would be 10 +10 +10* (n-1). Wait, that might complicate.

Alternatively, maybe the concert is structured as: group 1, intermission, group 2, intermission, ..., group n, no intermission after that.

So, the total time would be: 10*n +10*(n -1). So, 10n +10n -10=20n -10.

Which is the same as before, so 20n -10 ≤120, so n ≤6.5, so n=6.

So, with 6 groups, the total time is 20*6 -10=110 minutes.

So, 110 minutes used, 10 minutes left.

Alternatively, could we fit another group?

If we try 7 groups, that would be 7*10=70 minutes for the groups, and 6 intermissions of 10 minutes each, so 60 minutes. Total time would be 70 +60=130 minutes. But the concert is only 120 minutes, so that's over. So, 7 groups is too many.

Therefore, 6 groups is the maximum.

But wait, so 6 groups take 60 minutes, with 5 intermissions taking 50 minutes, totaling 110 minutes. So, 10 minutes is left. Is that extra time unused? So, is there a way to utilize that? Maybe the intermission can be extended? But the problem says she is allowing a 10-minute intermission, so it's fixed.

Alternatively, maybe the entrance and exit times can be overlapped with the intermission? Hmm, that might be more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the entrance time is when the group gets on stage, the exit time is when they leave. So, perhaps if the intermission is during the transition, can it be incorporated? But I think that complicates the timing.

Alternatively, maybe the entrance time is before the performance, and the exit time is after the performance. So, each group requires 2 minutes before, 6 minutes during, and 2 minutes after. So, each group is 10 minutes, but the intermission is a separate 10-minute break.

So, in that case, the total time is 10n +10*(n-1). So, 10n +10n -10=20n -10. So, 20n -10 must be ≤120. So, 20n ≤130, so n ≤6.5, so 6 groups.

Therefore, 6 groups is the maximum number.

But just to think about it differently, maybe the concert is 120 minutes, and the intermission is one single 10-minute break somewhere in the middle. So, how would that affect the number of groups?

Let's say the concert is 120 minutes. If there is a 10-minute intermission, then the rest of the time is 110 minutes.

Each group requires 10 minutes, so 110 minutes /10 minutes per group=11 groups. But that can't be, because if you have 11 groups, you would need 10 intermissions, but the intermission is only one.

Wait, hold on, maybe the intermission is a fixed break, so you can have groups before and after. So, the total time is group time + intermission. So, group time is 10n, intermission is 10, so total is 10n +10. So, 10n +10 ≤120. So, 10n ≤110, so n ≤11.

But that seems contradictory to my earlier calculation.

Wait, so which model is correct? Is the intermission a fixed break or is it a break between groups?

The problem says "a 10-minute intermission". So, that could be interpreted as a single intermission between the groups. So, perhaps the concert is divided into acts, each with a group, and one intermission between them.

So, if there are n groups, there are (n-1) intermissions.

Therefore, the total time is 10n +10(n-1)=20n -10.

Which gives n=6.

Alternatively, if the intermission is just a single break in the entire concert, not between groups, then total time is 10n +10.

Which would give n=11.

But the problem says "a 10-minute intermission", without specifying whether it's between groups or just a single break. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "She is allowing a 10-minute intermission". So, in the context of a concert, an intermission is usually a break between acts. So, each act is a group's performance, so there are (n-1) intermissions between n acts.

Therefore, the total duration is (group time per act * number of acts) + (intermission time * number of intermissions). So, 10n +10(n -1)=20n -10.

Therefore, 20n -10 ≤120, so 20n ≤130, so n ≤6.5, hence n=6.

Therefore, 6 groups can perform.

But to make sure, let's think about when the intermission is placed. If we have 6 groups, each taking 10 minutes, and 5 intermissions of 10 minutes each, the total time is 6*10 +5*10=60+50=110 minutes. So, 110 minutes in, and the concert is 120 minutes. So, 10 minutes left. So, can we squeeze in another group?

If we have 7 groups, that would be 7*10=70 minutes for groups, and 6 intermissions=60 minutes, so total 130 minutes, which is over the 120-minute limit. So, that's no good.

Alternatively, if the intermission is considered as a single break, not between groups. So, total time is 10n +10. So, 10n +10 ≤120. So, 10n ≤110, so n=11. But in that case, the intermission is just one break, not between groups. So, the concert would be 11 groups performing with one 10-minute break in the middle.

But in a concert, intermission is typically between acts. So, that seems more likely. So, 6 groups with 5 intermissions in between.

So, 6 groups and 5 intermissions take 110 minutes, leaving 10 minutes. So, if we try to fit another group, it would have to be after the last intermission, but the concert is over. So, that 10 minutes can't be used for another group.

Therefore, 6 groups is the answer.

But to be thorough, let me calculate the exact time.

First group: enter stage (2 min), perform (6 min), exit (2 min). So, 10 minutes.

Then, 10 min intermission.

Second group: 10 minutes.

Third group: 10 minutes.

Fourth group: 10 minutes.

Fifth group: 10 minutes.

Sixth group: 10 minutes.

So, six groups, each taking 10 minutes, plus five intermissions of 10 minutes each.

Calculating:

6 groups *10 min=60 min

5 intermissions *10 min=50 min

60 +50=110 min

Total concert duration is 120 min, so 10 min left.

But the last group's exit is at 60 +50=110 min, so the concert can end at 120 min, so 10 min is unused. So, that seems acceptable.

Therefore, the number of groups is 6.

So, I think 6 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The number of groups that can perform is \boxed{6}.
</think>

Vicki is planning a 2-hour pop concert at her high school. The concert duration is 120 minutes. Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit, totaling 10 minutes per group. Additionally, there is a 10-minute intermission.

To determine the number of groups that can perform, we need to account for both the performance time and the intermission. The total time for each group is 10 minutes, and there are \( n - 1 \) intermissions for \( n \) groups. The total time equation is:

\[
10n + 10(n - 1) \leq 120
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
10n + 10n - 10 \leq 120
\]
\[
20n - 10 \leq 120
\]
\[
20n \leq 130
\]
\[
n \leq 6.5
\]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, the maximum number of groups is 6. Verifying, 6 groups take 60 minutes, and 5 intermissions take 50 minutes, totaling 110 minutes, leaving 10 minutes unused.

Thus, the number of groups that can perform is \(\boxed{6}\).
