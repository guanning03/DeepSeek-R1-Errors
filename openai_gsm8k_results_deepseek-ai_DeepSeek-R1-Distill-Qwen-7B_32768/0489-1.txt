Question:
Fishio posted her selfie on Instagram. She received 2000 likes on the photo after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. If she received 20000 more new likes recently, how many Instagram likes are there?

Correct Answer:
After receiving 2000 likes on her photo on Instagram on the first week, Fishio received 70*2000 = <<70*2000=140000>>140000 new likes on the photo after three more weeks.
The total number of likes in the four weeks is 140000+2000 = <<140000+2000=142000>>142000
If Fishio received 20000 more likes recently, the number of likes on the photo is 142000+20000=<<142000+20000=162000>>162000

Wrong Answer:
Okay, let me try to figure out this Instagram likes problem. So, Fishio posted her selfie, and after one week, she got 2000 likes. Then, three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number. So, let me parse that.

First, the initial number of likes is 2000. That's after one week. Then, three weeks later, so that's a total of four weeks from the initial post, the number of likes became 70 times the initial. Hmm, so 70 times 2000.

Let me compute that. 70 times 2000. Well, 70*2000 is 140,000. So, after four weeks, the likes went up to 140,000.

But wait, the initial 2000 likes were after one week. So, does that mean that the likes kept increasing from week one to week four? So, from week one to week four, the likes went from 2000 to 140,000. That seems like a big jump.

Now, the question also says that she received 20,000 more likes recently. So, I need to figure out what the total number of likes is now. Hmm.

Wait, so is the 70 times the likes after three weeks from the initial post, or is it after four weeks? Let me re-read the problem.

"Fishio posted her selfie on Instagram. She received 2000 likes on the photo after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. If she received 20000 more new likes recently, how many Instagram likes are there?"

So, she got 2000 likes after week one. Then, three weeks later, meaning week four, the likes were 70 times 2000. So, that's 140,000. So, from week one to week four, the likes increased from 2000 to 140,000.

Then, she received 20,000 more likes recently. So, I think "recently" would mean after week four. So, we're adding another 20,000 likes on top of the current total.

So, let's break it down:

- After 1 week: 2000 likes.

- After 4 weeks: 70 * 2000 = 140,000 likes.

- Then, recently, she got 20,000 more likes, so total likes now are 140,000 + 20,000.

Let me compute that. 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000.

So, the total number of Instagram likes now is 160,000.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't misinterpret anything. The initial likes after one week: 2000. Then, three weeks later (so at week four), it was 70 times that, so 140,000. Then, she got 20,000 more likes, so total is 160,000.

Is there another way to interpret "three weeks later"? Like, three weeks after the initial week? So, from week one to week four, it's three weeks after the initial week. So, yeah, three weeks after week one is week four. So, 70 times after week one, so that's 140,000.

So, the timeline is:

- Week 0: Posted the photo.

- Week 1: 2000 likes.

- Week 4: 70*2000 = 140,000 likes.

- Then, recently, she got 20,000 more likes, so adding to the current total.

So, 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000.

I think that's straightforward. So, the answer is 160,000.

But wait, let me make sure that she didn't get 20,000 likes in total in the three weeks after week one, making it 2000 + 20,000 = 22,000, but that doesn't align with the 70 times.

Wait, no, the 70 times is 70 times the initial number, which is 2000. So, 70*2000=140,000. So, she had 140,000 likes at week four. Then, she got 20,000 more likes. So, total is 160,000.

Alternatively, maybe the 70 times is over the total likes? But that doesn't make much sense. If it was 70 times the likes after week one, which is 2000, then 70*2000 is 140,000, which is at week four.

So, yeah, 160,000 is the total number now.

I think that's solid.

**Final Answer**
The total number of Instagram likes is \boxed{160000}.
</think>

Fishio received 2000 likes on her Instagram post after one week. Three weeks later (which is a total of four weeks from the initial post), the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. 

First, we calculate the number of likes after four weeks:
\[
70 \times 2000 = 140000
\]

Then, she received 20,000 more likes recently. Adding these to the current total:
\[
140000 + 20000 = 160000
\]

Thus, the total number of Instagram likes is \boxed{160000}.
