Question:
There are five phones on a phone plan. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. If the main phone plan costs $20, how much does the whole phone plan cost?

Correct Answer:
Each additional phone costs 20 / 2 = $<<20/2=10>>10.
Thus, the four additional phones cost 4 * 10 = $<<4*10=40>>40 in all.
Thus, the whole phone plan cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here about five phones on a phone plan. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. The main phone plan itself costs $20, and I need to figure out the total cost of the whole phone plan. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are five phones in total. One of them is the main phone, and the other four are additional phones. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. So, if I can figure out the cost of one additional phone, I can then calculate the total cost for all five phones.

The main phone costs $20. Wait, hold on, is the main phone's cost $20, or is the main phone plan costing $20? The problem says, "the main phone plan costs $20." Hmm, that might be a bit confusing. Let me parse that again. "There are five phones on a phone plan. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. If the main phone plan costs $20, how much does the whole phone plan cost?"

So, it sounds like the main phone is part of the phone plan, and the entire plan costs $20. But the main phone itself costs twice as much as each additional phone. So, the total cost is $20, and we need to find out how much each phone costs, both the main one and the additional ones.

Wait, maybe I misread it. Let me check again. It says, "the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone." So, the main phone's cost is twice that of each additional phone. Then, it says the main phone plan costs $20. Hmm, maybe the main phone is a part of the plan, and the plan includes all five phones, with the main one costing twice as much as each of the others. So, the total cost of the plan is $20, which includes five phones: one main phone and four additional phones.

So, let me try to model this.

Let me denote the cost of each additional phone as x dollars. Then, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so the main phone costs 2x dollars. The total cost of the plan is the sum of the main phone and the four additional phones. So, total cost = main phone + 4 * additional phone.

That is, Total = 2x + 4x.

Wait, but hold on. If main phone is 2x and each additional is x, then the total is 2x + 4x, which is 6x.

But the problem says the main phone plan costs $20. So, is the total cost 20, which is 6x? So, 6x = 20. Then, x = 20 / 6, which is approximately $3.33 per additional phone.

But wait, that would make the main phone 2x = (20 / 6)*2 = 40 / 6 ≈ $6.66. So, the main phone is about $6.66, and each additional phone is about $3.33. Then, the total would be 6x = 20, which matches.

Wait, but let me verify if that makes sense. Let me calculate the total cost: 4 additional phones at $3.33 each is 4 * 3.33 = $13.32, plus the main phone at $6.66, so total is $13.32 + $6.66 = $19.98, which is approximately $20. So, that works.

But wait, another way to think about it is whether the main phone plan costs $20, which includes all five phones. So, is the main phone part of the plan? So, the plan is for five phones, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. So, if each additional phone is x, the main is 2x, and total is 2x + 4x = 6x = $20. So, x = 20 / 6 ≈ 3.333..., which is $3.33 per additional phone, and the main is $6.66.

But wait, let me see if maybe I misread the original problem. It says, "the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone." So, the main phone is twice each additional phone. So, that's 2x for main, x for each of the four others. So, 2x + 4x = 6x. If the total is $20, then 6x = 20, so x = 20/6 ≈ 3.333.

But, wait, if each additional phone is $3.33, then four of them would be $13.32, and the main phone is twice that, so $6.66, which adds up to $20.

Alternatively, let's think of it as separate costs. Maybe the main phone plan's cost is $20, and how much each phone costs. But no, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, and the main phone is part of the plan.

So, perhaps, the plan is for five phones: main and four additional, with the main costing twice as much as each additional, and the entire plan (all five phones) costing $20.

So, if I let x be the cost of each additional phone, then the main phone is 2x, and total is 2x + 4x = 6x = $20.

Therefore, x = 20 / 6 = 10 / 3 ≈ $3.3333 per additional phone. Then, the main phone is 2x = 20 / 3 ≈ $6.6666.

So, each additional phone is approximately $3.33, main phone is approximately $6.67, and total is $20.

Alternatively, in fractions, each additional phone is $10/3, which is about $3.33, and the main phone is $20/3, which is about $6.67.

So, total cost is $20, which is the sum of all five phones.

But let me see if the problem is asking for the cost of the whole phone plan. Wait, is the whole phone plan referring to the total cost including all five phones? Or is it referring to something else?

Wait, the problem says: "the main phone plan costs $20, how much does the whole phone plan cost?"

Hmm, maybe the main phone plan is $20, which includes the main phone and the additional four. So, perhaps the main phone plan is the entire plan, so the total cost is $20. Therefore, the answer is $20.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I misinterpret the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the main phone plan is the plan that includes the main phone, and each additional phone is added on top, each costing half the main phone's cost. But if the main phone plan is $20, then maybe the total cost is more than $20.

Wait, let's read the problem again: "There are five phones on a phone plan. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. If the main phone plan costs $20, how much does the whole phone plan cost?"

So, the main phone is part of the plan. The main phone is twice as expensive as each additional phone. The main phone plan itself costs $20. How much does the whole phone plan cost?

Wait, maybe the main phone plan is the entire plan, which includes all five phones, and the cost is $20. So, the question is, how much does the whole phone plan cost? So, is it asking for the total cost, which is $20? Or is it a trick question?

Alternatively, maybe the main phone is a separate plan, and the whole plan includes the main phone plus additional phones, each costing half the main phone's cost. In that case, the main phone plan is $20, and each additional phone is $10, but that seems too high.

Wait, let me think again. The problem is in Chinese, but the translation is given. Wait, no, it's already translated. So, "There are five phones on a phone plan. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. If the main phone plan costs $20, how much does the whole phone plan cost?"

So, perhaps the main phone is part of the plan, costing twice as much as each additional phone, and the total cost of the plan is $20. So, the whole phone plan is just the total, which is $20. So, that seems too simple.

But maybe the main phone plan is separate, and each additional phone is added on top of that, each costing half the main phone's cost. So, the main phone plan is $20, plus four additional phones, each at $10, making the whole plan $60.

But that seems like a big jump. Let me see.

Wait, if the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, and the main phone plan is $20, which includes all five phones, then we need to find the cost per phone.

So, if I let x be the cost of each additional phone, then the main phone is 2x, and the total cost is 2x + 4x = 6x = 20. So, x = 20 / 6 ≈ 3.3333.

Therefore, each additional phone is approximately $3.33, and the main phone is approximately $6.67. So, total is $20.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $20.

Alternatively, if the main phone plan is $20, which is the cost of the main phone, and each additional phone is half that, so $10 each, then the total cost would be $20 (main) + 4*$10 = $60.

But that seems to interpret "main phone plan" as the cost of the main phone alone, rather than the entire plan.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is trying to say that the main phone is twice as expensive as each additional phone, and the main phone is part of the plan that costs $20. So, the plan includes the main phone and four additional phones, with the main phone costing twice as much as each additional phone.

So, in that case, the total cost is $20, which is the sum of the main phone and four additional phones. Therefore, as we calculated before, each additional phone is $10/3 ≈ $3.33, and the main phone is $20/3 ≈ $6.67.

Therefore, the whole phone plan is $20.

Wait, so is the problem trying to trick me into thinking that the main phone plan is $20, but the whole plan is more? Or is it straightforward?

Wait, let me check again. The problem says, "the main phone plan costs $20," and asks, "how much does the whole phone plan cost?" So, perhaps the whole phone plan is the same as the main phone plan, which is $20.

But maybe "the whole phone plan" refers to all five phones together, not just the main phone. In that case, if the main phone is part of the plan, and the main phone is twice as expensive as each additional phone, then the total cost would be $20.

So, in that case, the answer is $20.

Alternatively, if the main phone plan is $20, which includes all five phones, then the whole phone plan is $20.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem is trying to test understanding of the relationship between the main phone and additional phones.

Alternatively, maybe the main phone plan is $20, but that refers only to the main phone, and each additional phone is added separately, costing half as much.

So, main phone plan: $20.

Each additional phone: $10.

Total cost: $20 + 4*$10 = $60.

But in that case, the problem should clarify that the main phone plan is $20, and then additional phones are $10 each, so total is $60.

But the problem is stated as: "the main phone plan costs $20, how much does the whole phone plan cost?"

So, it's ambiguous whether the main phone plan is the entire plan, or it's just the main phone.

But given the problem structure, it's probably that the main phone is part of the plan, which includes four additional phones, with the main phone costing twice as much as each additional phone, and the entire plan costs $20.

Therefore, the whole phone plan is $20.

But to make sure, let's try to represent it with equations.

Let x be the cost of each additional phone.

Then, main phone is 2x.

Total cost: 2x + 4x = 6x = 20.

Therefore, x = 20/6 = 10/3 ≈ 3.3333.

Therefore, each additional phone is $10/3, main phone is $20/3, total is $20.

So, the whole phone plan is $20.

Therefore, the answer is $20.

But wait, I should verify if that makes sense in another way.

Suppose each additional phone is $10/3 ≈ $3.33, so four of them are about $13.32.

The main phone is twice that, so about $6.66.

So, total is approximately $13.32 + $6.66 ≈ $19.98, which is roughly $20.

So, that makes sense.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $20.

Alternatively, if each additional phone is $10, and main phone is $20, then total is $60, but that seems like a different interpretation.

But given the problem says the main phone is twice as much as each additional phone, and the main phone plan is $20, which includes all five phones, I think the correct way is to set up the equation where total cost is 6x = 20, leading to x = 20/6.

Therefore, the whole phone plan is $20.

So, the answer is $20.

But let me just think again. If the main phone is twice as much as each additional phone, the main phone is more expensive. So, the main phone is more expensive, so if the total cost is $20, the main phone is a significant portion, and the additional phones are cheaper.

So, if each additional phone is $10/3, that's about $3.33, and the main phone is $20/3, which is about $6.67. So, main phone is about a third more expensive than each additional phone.

Therefore, the whole plan is $20.

Alternatively, if the main phone plan is $20, which is just the main phone, and each additional phone is added at half the main phone's cost, so $10 each, then total is $20 (main) + 4*$10 = $60.

But the problem says, "the main phone plan costs $20," which is a bit ambiguous. Is the main phone plan referring to the cost of the main phone itself, or the entire plan that includes all five phones?

Given that it's a phone plan that includes five phones, and it's called the main phone plan, it's likely that the entire plan is $20, which includes all five phones, with the main phone being twice as expensive as each additional phone.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $20.

So, after all that thinking, I believe the total cost is $20.

**Final Answer**
The whole phone plan costs \boxed{20} dollars.
</think>

Let \( x \) be the cost of each additional phone. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so the main phone costs \( 2x \). The total cost of the phone plan includes the main phone and four additional phones, which can be expressed as:

\[
2x + 4x = 6x
\]

We know the total cost of the phone plan is $20, so we set up the equation:

\[
6x = 20
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33
\]

Thus, each additional phone costs approximately $3.33, and the main phone costs \( 2x \approx 6.67 \). The total cost of the phone plan is $20.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs \boxed{20} dollars.
