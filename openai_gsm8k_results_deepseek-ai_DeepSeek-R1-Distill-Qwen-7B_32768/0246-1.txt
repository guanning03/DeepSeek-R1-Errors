Question:
Steve decides to start eating more tomatoes and decides to grows his own cherry tomatoes.  He eats twice as much as his girlfriend.  He eats 6 per day.  If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week how many vines does he need?

Correct Answer:
His girlfriend eats 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 tomatoes per day
So together they eat 6+3=<<6+3=9>>9 tomatoes a day
That means they eat 9*7=<<9*7=63>>63 tomatoes a day
So he needs 63/3=<<63/3=21>>21 tomato vines

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Steve is starting to grow his own cherry tomatoes now, and he wants to eat more. The problem says he eats twice as much as his girlfriend and he eats 6 tomatoes per day. I need to figure out how many vines Steve needs. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the information given. Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend. So, if I can find out how many tomatoes his girlfriend eats per day, I can figure out Steve's consumption. But wait, the problem directly tells me that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Hmm, okay, maybe I don't need the relationship with his girlfriend after all? Let me read the problem again.

"Steve decides to start eating more tomatoes and decides to grows his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend. He eats 6 per day. If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week how many vines does he need?"

So, it says he eats twice as much as his girlfriend. Then he eats 6 per day. Wait, so if he eats 6 per day, that's twice his girlfriend's consumption. So, does that mean his girlfriend eats 3 per day? That would make sense because 6 is twice 3. So, Steve eats 6 per day, girlfriend eats 3 per day. But do I need the girlfriend's consumption for anything else? The question is about how many vines Steve needs. So maybe the girlfriend's data isn't necessary.

Let me check that. The problem says Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so if Steve eats 6 per day, that's 6 divided by 2, which is 3 per day for his girlfriend. Okay, so Steve is eating 6 per day. Now, the next part is about the vines. It says a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. So, how many tomatoes does Steve need to eat in a week, and then how many vines does he need to grow that many tomatoes?

Wait, so let's think about this. If Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, how many does he eat in a week? There are 7 days in a week, so 6 times 7 is 42 tomatoes per week. So, Steve needs 42 tomatoes per week. Each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. So, how many vines does he need to get 42 tomatoes? That would be 42 divided by 3, which is 14. So, does that mean he needs 14 vines?

Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me verify each step.

1. Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend. So, if Steve eats 6 per day, his girlfriend eats 3 per day. So, that's correct.

2. Now, to find the number of tomatoes Steve needs per week, it's 6 per day times 7 days, which is 42 tomatoes per week. That makes sense.

3. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. So, to find how many vines he needs, he divides the total tomatoes needed by the number of tomatoes per vine. So, 42 divided by 3 is 14. So, 14 vines.

Wait, but hold on. Is there something else I'm missing here? The problem states that Steve is growing his own cherry tomatoes. So, does that mean he needs to account for any losses, like if some tomatoes don't grow or something? The problem doesn't mention anything about yield efficiency or losses, so I think we can assume that each vine produces exactly 3 tomatoes per week without any loss. So, 14 vines should be sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me by mentioning his girlfriend, but I think that part is just extra information. Let me see if there's another way to interpret it. If Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and he eats 6 per day, so the girlfriend eats 3 per day. But maybe the problem is trying to get me to think about the total consumption of both of them? Wait, the question is only about how many vines Steve needs, so I think that's a red herring. It's just telling us how much he eats compared to his girlfriend, but the number 6 per day is directly given, so maybe the girlfriend's data isn't needed at all.

Wait, let me make sure. The problem says "He eats twice as much as his girlfriend. He eats 6 per day." So, it's telling us that Steve's eating rate is double his girlfriend's. If instead, the problem had said "Steve and his girlfriend together eat twice as much as another person," then we might need to consider that. But in this case, it's only comparing Steve to his girlfriend, so if Steve is eating 6 per day, his girlfriend is eating 3 per day.

But since the question is only about how many vines Steve needs, maybe the girlfriend's information isn't needed. So, perhaps I can just ignore the part about his girlfriend because it's not directly affecting the calculation for the number of vines. So, I can proceed with Steve's consumption only.

So, to recap: 6 tomatoes per day times 7 days is 42 per week. Each vine produces 3 per week, so 42 divided by 3 is 14. So, 14 vines.

Wait, is 14 an integer? Yes, that seems straightforward. So, unless there's a trick where you can't have a fraction of a vine, so you might need to round up. But 42 divided by 3 is exactly 14, so no rounding is needed. So, 14 is the exact number.

Is there another angle to approach this? Maybe considering separate weeks or something? Let me see. If Steve eats 6 per day, that's 42 per week. Each vine can produce 3 per week. So, 42 divided by 3 is 14. So, yes, 14 is correct.

Alternatively, thinking about how many tomatoes Steve eats in a day and per week. Since he needs 6 per day, and each vine gives 3 per week, how many vines does he need per day? Hmm, each week, each vine gives 3, so per day, that's 3 divided by 7, which is about 0.428 tomatoes per day per vine. But since he needs 6 per day, he needs 6 divided by 0.428, which is approximately 14. So, again, 14.

Wait, that seems a bit more complicated, but it confirms the same answer. So, 14 is right.

So, to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me write down the formulas.

Total tomatoes needed per week = Steve's daily consumption * 7
= 6 * 7
= 42 tomatoes per week.

Tomatoes per week per vine = 3.

Number of vines needed = Total tomatoes needed per week / Tomatoes per week per vine
= 42 / 3
= 14.

So, 14 is correct.

I think that's solid. So, the answer is 14.

**Final Answer**
Steve needs \boxed{14} vines.
</think>

Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend and eats 6 tomatoes per day. This means his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. However, since the question only asks about Steve's needs, we focus on his consumption.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. To find out how many tomatoes he needs per week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7:

\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes he needs per week by the number of tomatoes each vine produces:

\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 14 \text{ vines} \]

Thus, Steve needs \boxed{14} vines.
