Question:
A shoe store was having a weekend sale on a brand of popular tennis shoes. On Friday the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day they sold double that number of shoes. On the last day of the sale they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?

Correct Answer:
On Saturday 14*2=<<14*2=28>>28 shoes were sold
On Sunday 28/2=<<28/2=14>>14 shoes were sold
Before the returns were made 14+28+14=<<14+28+14=56>>56 pairs of shoes were sold
After the returns were made 56-6=<<56-6=50>>50 pairs of shoe were sold
#### 50

Wrong Answer:
Alright, let me try to figure out how many tennis shoes the store sold by the end of the sale. So, the sale happened over three days: Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Each day, the number of shoes sold changed, so I need to calculate the sales for each day separately and then add them all up.

First, on Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. That seems straightforward. So, Friday's sales are 14 pairs. I'll note that down.

Now, moving on to Saturday. The problem says they sold double that number of shoes the next day. Hmm, so double of Friday's sales. Since they sold 14 pairs on Friday, double that would be 14 multiplied by 2. Let me calculate that: 14 times 2 is 28. So, on Saturday, they sold 28 pairs of tennis shoes.

Alright, that was easy enough. Now, onto Sunday. This is the last day of the sale, and they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before. But wait, there's also a caveat: six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. So, I need to be careful here. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's figure out what the number of shoes sold on Sunday would have been before any returns. The problem says they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before. The day before Sunday is Saturday, right? So, on Saturday, they sold 28 pairs. Therefore, one-half of that would be 28 divided by 2. Let me compute that: 28 divided by 2 is 14. So, without considering the returns, they would have sold 14 pairs on Sunday.

But hold on, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. Hmm, so does that mean six pairs were returned? Or six people returned, each returning one pair? I think it's the latter. Each person returned a pair, so six people returning would mean six pairs were returned. So, out of the 14 pairs sold on Sunday, six were returned. Therefore, the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday would be 14 minus 6. Let me do that subtraction: 14 minus 6 is 8. So, on Sunday, they sold 8 pairs of tennis shoes.

Wait a second, let me make sure I interpreted that correctly. The problem says, "they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit." So, it's the amount sold before returns? Or is it the net amount sold after returns? Hmm. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "On the last day of the sale they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit." So, "sold one-half the amount that they did the day before" probably refers to the amount before the returns. So, that would mean that before any returns, they sold 14 pairs, but six people then returned their pairs, so net sales would be 14 minus 6, which is 8.

Alternatively, if it's after returns, then the amount sold would be 14, but six pairs were returned, which might complicate things. Wait, but it's phrased as "sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs." So, the "but" connects two separate events: the sale and the returns. So, the sale was for half the previous day's amount, but then six people returned. So, it's like they sold 14 pairs on Sunday, but six pairs were returned. So, the net number of shoes sold on Sunday is 14 minus 6, which is 8. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, to recap: Friday - 14 pairs, Saturday - 28 pairs, Sunday - 14 pairs before returns, minus 6 returns, so 8 pairs sold on Sunday.

Now, to find the total number of pairs sold by the end of the sale, I need to add up the pairs sold on each day. So, that would be Friday's 14 plus Saturday's 28 plus Sunday's 8.

Let me compute that step by step:

First, 14 (Friday) plus 28 (Saturday) is 42. Then, adding Sunday's 8 pairs: 42 plus 8 is 50. So, in total, 50 pairs of tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale.

But wait, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, Friday: 14, that's clear. Saturday: double of Friday, so 14 * 2 = 28, correct. Sunday: half of Saturday's sales. So, 28 / 2 = 14. Then, subtract the 6 returns, so 14 - 6 = 8. Then, adding them up: 14 + 28 = 42, plus 8 is indeed 50. So, all calculations seem to check out.

Wait another thought: sometimes, when people talk about pairs, do they mean individual shoes? Or is a pair considered as two shoes? Hmm, but in the context of sales, when they say "14 pairs sold," that typically means 14 pairs, which is 28 individual shoes, right? But in the final answer, are they asking for the number of pairs or the number of individual shoes? Let me check the question again.

The question says: "How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?" So, they specifically mention "tennis shoes," so that implies individual shoes, not pairs. Hmm, that changes things. So, I need to recast my calculations in terms of individual shoes, not pairs. So, each pair is two shoes, so when they sold 14 pairs, that's 28 shoes. Similarly, 28 pairs is 56 shoes, and 8 pairs is 16 shoes. So, adding up the individual shoes sold each day: 28 + 56 + 16.

Wait, hold on, that's different from my previous calculation. So, maybe I need to clarify whether the question is asking for pairs or individual shoes.

Looking back at the original problem: "On Friday the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day they sold double that number of shoes. On the last day of the sale they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?"

So, when it says "they sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes," that's 14 pairs. Then, the next day, they sold double that number of shoes. Wait, is that double the number of pairs or double the number of shoes?

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse that sentence again: "The next day they sold double that number of shoes." So, the previous day, which was Friday, they sold 14 pairs. So, 14 pairs is 28 shoes. So, "double that number of shoes" would be double 28, which is 56 shoes. So, Saturday's sales would be 56 individual shoes.

Then, on Sunday, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. So, "the day before" would be Saturday, which was 56 shoes. So, half of 56 is 28 shoes. But six people returned their pairs. So, each person returned a pair, which is two shoes. So, six people returning would mean six pairs, which is 12 shoes. So, six people returning their pairs would mean 12 individual shoes returned.

Therefore, on Sunday, they sold 28 shoes, but then 12 shoes were returned. So, the net number of shoes sold on Sunday would be 28 minus 12, which is 16 shoes.

Therefore, now, adding up all the individual shoes sold:

Friday: 14 pairs = 28 shoes

Saturday: double of Friday's shoes, which is 28 * 2 = 56 shoes

Sunday: half of Saturday's shoes, which is 56 / 2 = 28 shoes, minus 12 shoes returned, so 28 - 12 = 16 shoes

Total shoes sold: 28 (Friday) + 56 (Saturday) + 16 (Sunday) = 100 shoes

Wait, so now it's 100 shoes. So, earlier, I was calculating in terms of pairs, but the problem asks for the number of tennis shoes sold, so that's individual shoes. So, my initial mistake was interpreting "pairs" as individual shoes, but now I see that the problem is a bit ambiguous.

Let me go through it again.

First, Friday: sold 14 pairs. So, 14 * 2 = 28 shoes.

Saturday: sold double that number of shoes. So, double of Friday's shoes, which is 28 * 2 = 56 shoes.

Sunday: sold one-half the amount that they did the day before. So, half of Saturday's shoes, which is 56 / 2 = 28 shoes. But six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. Each person returned a pair, so that's 6 * 2 = 12 shoes returned. So, the net sales on Sunday are 28 - 12 = 16 shoes.

So, adding up all the individual shoes sold: 28 + 56 + 16.

Let me add them step by step:

28 + 56 = 84

84 + 16 = 100

So, total of 100 shoes sold.

Wait, so that's different from my initial conclusion of 50 pairs, which would be 100 shoes. So, actually, the answer is 100 shoes. But the question specifically asks for the number of tennis shoes, so that would be 100 individual shoes.

Wait, but let me make sure that the interpretation is correct. The problem says, "On Friday the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes." So, 14 pairs, which is 28 shoes. Then, "The next day they sold double that number of shoes." So, the "that number" refers to the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is 28. So, double that would be 56 shoes on Saturday.

Then, "On the last day of the sale they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit." So, "the day before" is Saturday, which was 56 shoes. So, half of that is 28 shoes. Then, six people returned their pairs, meaning six pairs, which is 12 shoes. So, net sales on Sunday: 28 - 12 = 16 shoes.

So, adding them up: 28 + 56 + 16 = 100 shoes. So, 100 individual shoes sold.

Therefore, the answer is 100.

But just to double-check, let me think about it another way. If I interpret "double that number of shoes" as double the number of pairs, instead of double the number of shoes. So, if Friday was 14 pairs, then Saturday would be double that, which is 28 pairs, which is 56 shoes. Then, Sunday would be half the amount they did the day before, so half of 28 pairs, which is 14 pairs, but then subtract six pairs returned. So, 14 - 6 = 8 pairs, which is 16 shoes. Then, adding up: 14 + 28 + 8 pairs, which is 50 pairs, which is 100 shoes.

So, whether I interpret "double that number of shoes" as doubling the number of pairs or doubling the number of shoes, I end up with the same total number of shoes sold, which is 100.

Wait, that's interesting. So, whether it's interpreted as doubling pairs or doubling shoes, the total is the same because we're adding pairs and then converting them to shoes.

But in the initial calculation, I thought that "double that number of shoes" was referring to the number of shoes, not the number of pairs. But regardless, both interpretations lead to the same total number of shoes sold because the operations are consistent with the unit conversions.

So, in the end, whether you calculate it in pairs or shoes, you get the same total, which is 100 shoes.

Therefore, the answer is 100.

But just to be thorough, let me parse the problem again:

"A shoe store was having a weekend sale on a brand of popular tennis shoes. On Friday the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day they sold double that number of shoes. On the last day of the sale they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?"

So, "On Friday the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes." So, 14 pairs.

"The next day they sold double that number of shoes." So, double of Friday's number of shoes. Since Friday was 14 pairs, which is 28 shoes, double that is 56 shoes.

"On the last day of the sale they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit." So, "the day before" is Saturday, which was 56 shoes. So, half of that is 28 shoes. But six people returned their pairs, which is six pairs, so 12 shoes. So, 28 - 12 = 16 shoes sold on Sunday.

So, 14 pairs (28 shoes) on Friday, 56 shoes on Saturday, and 16 shoes on Sunday. Total is 28 + 56 + 16 = 100 shoes.

Therefore, the answer is 100.

I think that's solid. I considered both possible interpretations and realized that regardless of whether you consider pairs or shoes, the total comes out to 100. So, that must be the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is \boxed{100}.
</think>

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. Converting this to individual shoes, we have \(14 \times 2 = 28\) shoes.

On Saturday, the store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. This is calculated as \(28 \times 2 = 56\) shoes.

On Sunday, the store sold half the number of shoes sold on Saturday, which is \(56 \div 2 = 28\) shoes. However, six people returned their pairs, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) shoes. Subtracting the returned shoes, we have \(28 - 12 = 16\) shoes sold on Sunday.

Adding up the shoes sold each day:
- Friday: 28 shoes
- Saturday: 56 shoes
- Sunday: 16 shoes

Total shoes sold: \(28 + 56 + 16 = 100\)

Thus, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is \(\boxed{100}\).
