Question:
Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 a meter. Sarah plans to use the profit to buy a new rope, which at the store costs $1.5 a meter. How much money will she have left over after she buys the new rope?

Correct Answer:
Her friend pays her $40 for the rope because 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40
She can buy the rope at the store for $30 because 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30
She has $10 left over because 40 - 30 = <<40-30=10>>10

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Sarah will have left after she buys the new rope. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, Sarah has a rope that's 20 meters long. I should note down that Sarah's rope is 20 meters. Now, her friend wants to buy this rope for $2 per meter. Hmm, so Sarah can sell her rope to her friend and make some money. I think that's the first part: calculating how much money Sarah makes from selling her rope.

So, if she sells 20 meters at $2 per meter, how do we calculate that? I should multiply the number of meters by the price per meter. Let me write that out: 20 meters * $2/meter. That should give me Sarah's total profit from selling the rope. 

Calculating that, 20 times 2 is 40. So, Sarah makes $40 from selling her rope. 

Now, Sarah plans to use this $40 to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.50 per meter. So, I need to figure out how many meters of rope Sarah can buy with her $40. 

To find out how many meters she can purchase, I should divide the total amount of money she has by the cost per meter of the new rope. That would be $40 divided by $1.50 per meter. Let me write that as 40 / 1.50. 

Hmm, dividing by 1.50 isn't straightforward, but I can convert that into a fraction to make it easier. 1.50 is the same as 3/2, so dividing by 3/2 is the same as multiplying by 2/3. So, 40 * (2/3) equals... let me compute that. 40 divided by 3 is approximately 13.333, and then multiplied by 2 is about 26.666. 

So, Sarah can buy approximately 26.666 meters of the new rope. But since you can't really buy a fraction of a meter in real life, we might need to consider if she can only buy whole meters. But the problem doesn't specify that, so I think it's okay to use the fractional meter for calculation purposes.

Now, the next step is to figure out how much money Sarah will have left after buying the rope. She started with $40. She spends some amount on the new rope. So, we need to calculate how much she spends and subtract that from her initial $40.

The amount she spends is the number of meters she buys multiplied by the cost per meter. So, that would be 26.666 meters * $1.50/meter. Let me compute that. 

First, 26 * 1.5 is 39. Then, 0.666 * 1.5 is approximately 1. So, 39 + 1 is 40. Wait, that's an interesting result. If she buys 26.666 meters at $1.50 per meter, she spends $40 in total. 

But that would mean she spends all her money, leaving her with $0. But that seems a bit counterintuitive because she started with $40 and the cost per meter is less than what she sold her rope for. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait a second, the cost per meter is $1.50, and she has $40. So, 40 divided by 1.50 is indeed 26.666... So, she can buy 26.666 meters. But if she buys 26.666 meters at $1.50 per meter, that's 26.666 * 1.50, which is 40. So, she would spend all her $40. Therefore, she would have $0 left. 

But that seems a bit strange because she made $40 from selling her rope, and then she uses all of that $40 to buy a new rope. So, she would have no money left. 

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I miscalculated something. Let me check:

Total money Sarah has: $40.

Cost per meter of new rope: $1.50.

Number of meters she can buy: 40 / 1.50 = 26.666...

Total cost for the rope: 26.666... * 1.50.

Let me compute 26.666... multiplied by 1.50.

26.666... is 80/3. So, 80/3 multiplied by 3/2 (since 1.50 is 3/2) is (80/3)*(3/2) = 80/2 = 40. 

So, yes, she spends all $40. Therefore, she has $0 left. 

Wait, maybe the question is a bit of a trick question, because she sells her rope for $40, and then uses that $40 to buy another rope, which costs $1.50 per meter. So, she uses all her money, and has nothing left. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting a different interpretation. Perhaps, she can only buy a whole number of meters, so she can only buy 26 meters. Then, let's see how much money she has left.

If she buys 26 meters, then the cost is 26 * 1.50 = 39. Then, she started with $40, so she has $1 left.

But that's a different answer depending on whether she can buy a fraction of a meter or not. The problem doesn't specify whether she can buy a partial meter or not. 

Looking back at the problem: "Sarah plans to use the profit to buy a new rope, which at the store costs $1.5 a meter." There's no mention of minimum purchase or whole meters, so I think it's acceptable to assume she can buy fractional meters.

Therefore, buying 26.666 meters would cost exactly $40, leaving her with $0.

But wait, another thought: maybe I should consider the total cost of the new rope. If she buys 20 meters, that would cost 20 * 1.50 = 30. Then, she would have 40 - 30 = 10 left. But that would be if the rope was only 20 meters. But she actually can buy more rope, since she has $40.

Wait, no, that's not the case. She can buy as much as she wants, up to the amount she can afford, which is 26.666 meters. So, she can buy more than 20 meters, and the amount is limited by her $40.

So, if she buys 26.666 meters, she spends all her $40, so she's left with $0. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the leftover from buying 20 meters, but that wouldn't make sense because she can buy more. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to go step by step.

1. Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long.
2. She sells it to her friend for $2 per meter. So, 20 * 2 = $40 profit.
3. She uses this $40 to buy a new rope that costs $1.50 per meter.
4. How much money does she have left after buying the new rope?

So, she can buy as much as she can with $40. Let's compute how much rope she can buy:

$40 divided by $1.50 per meter. 

Calculating that:

40 / 1.50 = ?

Well, 1.50 goes into 40 how many times?

1.50 * 26 = 39

1.50 * 27 = 40.50

So, 1.50 goes into 40 26 times with some remainder.

So, 26 meters would cost 26 * 1.50 = $39.

Then, she has 40 - 39 = $1 left.

But wait, she has $1 left, but she can't buy another meter because one more meter would cost another $1.50, which she doesn't have. So, if she can only buy whole meters, she would have $1 left.

However, if she can buy fractional meters, she can buy 26.666... meters, which would cost exactly $40, leaving her with $0.

But, the problem doesn't specify whether she can buy a partial meter or not. Therefore, I think both interpretations are possible. But in real-life contexts, when buying rope, you can buy partial meters, especially if it's sold by the meter. So, perhaps she can buy 26.666... meters, spending all her $40, leaving her with $0.

But let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly.

"Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 a meter. Sarah plans to use the profit to buy a new rope, which at the store costs $1.5 a meter. How much money will she have left over after she buys the new rope?"

Wait, so the key points are:

- Sarah sells her 20m rope for $2/m, making $40.

- She uses that $40 to buy a new rope at $1.5/m.

- The question is, how much money will she have left over.

So, it's not about how much she spends on the new rope, but how much she has left after purchasing.

If she can buy as much as $40 allows, then she can buy 26.666... meters, spending all $40, so she has $0 left.

But, if she can only buy whole meters, then she can buy 26 meters, spending $39, and has $1 left.

So, which is correct?

Looking back at the problem statement: "buy a new rope, which at the store costs $1.5 a meter." It doesn't specify that she needs to buy a specific length, just that it's sold at that price per meter. So, I think she can buy as much as she can afford with $40, which is 26.666... meters, leaving her with $0.

Alternatively, if the problem expects her to buy 20 meters again, then she would have 20 meters costing 20 * 1.50 = 30, and have 40 - 30 = 10 left. But that seems like an unnecessary assumption because she doesn't need to buy the same length.

Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that she can buy as much rope as she can with $40, which is 26.666 meters, spending all $40, leaving her with $0.

But let me check the math again:

Total money from selling: 20 * 2 = 40.

Money spent on new rope: 40 / 1.50 = 26.666...

Total cost: 26.666... * 1.50 = 40.

Money left: 40 - 40 = 0.

Therefore, Sarah has $0 left.

Alternatively, if she can't buy partial meters, she can only buy 26 meters, spending 26 * 1.50 = 39, so she has 1 left.

But the problem doesn't specify, so as a test-taker, I need to decide which interpretation is more likely.

In math problems, unless specified otherwise, it's usually acceptable to use fractional amounts. So, 26.666... is 80/3, which is approximately 26.67 meters. Therefore, she spends all her money, leaving her with $0.

But just to make sure, let me re-examine the problem statement:

"Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 a meter. Sarah plans to use the profit to buy a new rope, which at the store costs $1.5 a meter. How much money will she have left over after she buys the new rope?"

So, the key is that she uses the profit to buy a new rope. The new rope is priced at $1.5 per meter, and she has $40. She wants to buy as much as she can, so she will spend all $40, leaving her with $0.

Therefore, the answer is $0.

But I feel like maybe I should double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes.

Total money earned: 20 * 2 = 40. Correct.

Total money spent: 40 / 1.50 = 26.666... Correct.

Total money left: 40 - (26.666... * 1.50) = 40 - 40 = 0. Correct.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, if she can only buy whole meters, she might have $1 left. But as the problem is presented, I think the first interpretation is more appropriate.

So, in conclusion, Sarah will have $0 left over after she buys the new rope.

**Final Answer**
Sarah will have \boxed{0} dollars left over after she buys the new rope.
</think>

Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. She sells this rope to her friend for $2 per meter, making a profit of:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Sarah plans to use this $40 to buy a new rope, which costs $1.50 per meter. The number of meters she can buy with $40 is calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{\$40}{\$1.50/\text{meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = 26.666\ldots \text{ meters} \]

Since she can buy fractional meters, the total cost for 26.666... meters is:

\[ 26.666\ldots \text{ meters} \times \$1.50/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Therefore, Sarah spends all her $40, leaving her with:

\[ \$40 - \$40 = \$0 \]

Thus, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
