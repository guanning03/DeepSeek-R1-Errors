Question:
In November, a toy was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. In January, the price decreased by 50%. What was the price of the toy after it was discounted in January?

Correct Answer:
In November, the toy's price was $<<40=40>>40.
The 80% increment represents 40*0.8=$32
In December, the toy's price was 40 + 32 = $<<40+32=72>>72.
The 50% increment from January represents 72*0.5=<<72*0.5=36>>36
In January, the toy's price is 72 - 36 = $<<72-36=36>>36.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here about the price of a toy changing in November, December, and January. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the toy was $40 in November. Then, in December, the price increased by 80%. Hmm, okay, so an 80% increase means the price went up quite a bit. I think I need to calculate what the new price is after this increase.

Alright, so how do I calculate an 80% increase on $40? I remember that to find a percentage of a number, you multiply that number by the percentage in decimal form. So, 80% is like 0.8. Let me write that down:

80% of $40 = 0.8 * 40.

Let me do that multiplication. 0.8 times 40... Hmm, 0.8 times 40 is 32. So, the increase is $32. 

Therefore, the new price in December would be the original price plus the increase. So that's $40 + $32. Let me add that up. 40 plus 32 is 72. So, the toy now costs $72 in December. 

Okay, that seems right. Now, moving on to January. The problem says the price decreased by 50% in January. So, we're going to take the December price and reduce it by 50%. 

Alright, so how do we calculate a 50% decrease? I think it's similar to the increase. We take the current price, which is $72, and find 50% of that, then subtract it from the current price. So, 50% is 0.5 in decimal form.

So, 50% of $72 is 0.5 * 72. Let me calculate that. 0.5 times 72 is 36. So, the decrease is $36.

Therefore, the new price in January is the December price minus the decrease. That would be $72 - $36. Let me subtract that. 72 minus 36 is 48. So, the price after the discount in January is $48.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting at $40 in November, an 80% increase: 0.8 * 40 is 32, so 40 + 32 is 72. Then, a 50% decrease: 0.5 * 72 is 36, so 72 - 36 is 48. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is: an 80% increase is the same as multiplying by 1.8, because 100% + 80% = 180%, or 1.8. So, 40 * 1.8 is 72. Then, a 50% decrease is multiplying by 0.5, because 100% - 50% = 50%, which is 0.5. So, 72 * 0.5 is 48. Yep, same answer.

I guess that's another way to confirm. Both methods lead me to $48. So, that must be the correct price after the discount in January.

I don't think I missed anything here. The steps are pretty straightforward: calculate the increase, then the decrease, and that gives the final price. I didn't confuse the percentages or anything. It's just two successive percentage changes. 

So, final answer is $48.

**Final Answer**
The price of the toy after the discount in January was \boxed{48}.
</think>

In November, the toy was priced at $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price in December, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price:

\[
80\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.8 \times 40 = 32
\]
\[
\text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72
\]

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price in January, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price:

\[
50\% \text{ of } 72 = 0.5 \times 72 = 36
\]
\[
\text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 48
\]

Thus, the price of the toy after the discount in January was \boxed{48}.
