Question:
Gene is sewing a quilt out of old souvenir t-shirts. He has one shirt from each vacation he has been on. Every shirt is its own quilt block. Each row is made of blocks from a different year of vacations. He goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. He is now 34. How many quilt blocks does he have in total?

Correct Answer:
Gene has been on 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years of vacations, so he has 11 rows of blocks.
He goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.
Gene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.
#### 44

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Gene is sewing a quilt made up of old souvenir t-shirts, each from a different vacation. I need to figure out how many quilt blocks he has in total. Let me break down the information given.

First, he goes on four vacations each year. That seems straightforward. So every year, he gets four new quilt blocks. Now, he's been vacationing since he was 23 and is now 34. Hmm, so how many years has he been going on vacations?

Let me subtract his age when he started from his current age. So, 34 minus 23 is 11 years. So he's been on vacations for 11 years. 

But wait, he started at 23, so does that mean he had his first vacation at 23, making it 11 vacations? Let me think. If he's 34 now, and he started at 23, then the number of years he's been vacationing is 11. But depending on when his first vacation was, it might affect the count. If he started at age 23, then at age 23, he had his first vacation, and each subsequent year after that adds another vacation. So, from age 23 to 34 is 11 years, so he would have 11 vacation blocks.

But wait, hold on. The problem says he has one shirt from each vacation he's been on, and he goes on four vacations a year. So, if each year he does four, and he's been doing this for 11 years, then the total number of shirts should be 4 times 11, right?

Let me write that out:

Number of years = 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Number of vacations per year = 4.

Total quilt blocks = 4 * 11 = 44.

Wait, but let me check again. So, starting at 23, each year he has four more blocks. So, at 23, he has 4 blocks. At 24, he has another 4, totaling 8. At 25, another 4, totaling 12. So, each year adds 4, so after n years, it's 4n.

So, 11 years would give 4 * 11 = 44 blocks.

Is there any chance that the first year might not count if he started at 23? For example, if he turned 23 in the middle of a vacation, but the problem doesn't specify. It just says he's been vacationing since he was 23, so I think it's safe to assume that each year from 23 to 34 inclusive, he went on four vacations, each with a block.

Another way to think about it: the number of vacation years is 11, so 11 years * 4 blocks/year = 44 blocks.

Is there any other factor I need to consider? Maybe leap years or something? Probably not, since it's just counting the number of years and assuming each year he does four. The problem doesn't mention anything about missing vacations or taking breaks, so I think 44 is the straightforward answer.

Just to make sure, let me recount the years:

From 23 to 34 is:

23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34.

Wait, hold on, that's 12 years, isn't it? Wait, 34 minus 23 is 11, but when counting inclusive, it's 12 years. Hmm, this is a common confusion.

So, if he started at 23, then in 23 he had his first vacation, in 24 the second, ..., in 34 the 12th. So, 34 - 23 + 1 = 12 years.

Wait, so that would mean 12 years, each with four vacations, so 12 * 4 = 48.

Wait, now I'm confused. Which is it? 11 or 12 years?

Let me think. If I was born in 2005, how old am I now? If the current year is 2023, then 2023 - 2005 = 18, but I've had my 18th birthday, so I'm 18 years old. But if the current year is 2024, I would be 19. So, the number of years since 2005 is 19, but my age is 18?

Wait, no, that's another way. Wait, I think the confusion is about whether the starting point is inclusive or not.

If he started vacationing at 23, then in each subsequent year he does four more. So, at 23, he's done four blocks. At 24, another four, so total eight. At 25, twelve, etc.

So, in 23: 4 blocks

24: 8

25: 12

26: 16

27: 20

28: 24

29: 28

30: 32

31: 36

32: 40

33: 44

34: 48

Wait, so at age 23, he's done 4, 24:8,..., 34:48.

So, from 23 to 34 inclusive, that's 12 years, each adding four blocks. So, 12 * 4 = 48.

But the problem says he's 34 now, and he started vacationing when he was 23. So, if he started at 23, then by the time he's 34, it's been 12 years. So, total number of vacation blocks is 48.

But then earlier, when I did 34 -23=11, I thought it was 11, but actually, if he started at 23, then he's had 12 vacation years: 23,24,...,34.

So, why did I get confused? Because when you subtract 23 from 34, you get 11, but since both the start and end are inclusive, you add 1.

So, the formula is: Number of years = (Final age - Initial age) + 1.

So, 34 -23 +1=12 years.

Therefore, total blocks: 12 *4=48.

Wait, so now I'm getting conflicting answers: 44 vs 48.

Which one is correct?

Let me think of a smaller example. Suppose someone started at 20 and is now 23. So, 20,21,22,23: four years.

Number of years= (23-20)+1=4, which is correct.

So, in the original problem, 34-23+1=12 years, each with four blocks.

Therefore, 12*4=48 blocks.

But then, in the initial calculation, I thought of 34-23=11, which would be 11 blocks if each year is a block, but each year contributes four blocks, so it's 44.

Wait, no, that was incorrect. Because each year he adds four blocks, so it's 4 times the number of years.

Thus, if he's had 12 vacation years, then it's 12*4=48.

But wait, let's think about it another way.

If he started at age 23, then at age 23, he had 4 blocks. At age 24, another 4 (total 8). At age 25, another 4 (12). Following this, at age 34, he has how many?

So, from age 23 to 34, that's 12 years, each with four blocks, so 12*4=48.

Alternatively, if someone starts at age 23, that's year 1, then 24 is year 2, ..., 34 is year 12.

Therefore, 12 years, 4 blocks each: 48.

So, my initial thought of 44 was wrong because I didn't account for the inclusive years.

So, the correct total is 48 blocks.

Wait, but let me verify with another approach.

Total number of blocks is 4 per year times the number of years.

If he started at 23, and is now 34, the number of years he's been doing this is 34 -23=11, but since he started at 23, that's the first year, so total years are 11 +1=12.

So, 12 years, 4 blocks each: 12*4=48.

Yes, that seems right.

Alternatively, if he started at age 23, and is now 34, he's had 12 birthdays where he got a new block each year. So, 12 blocks per year, but no, he gets four each year.

Wait, no, he gets four blocks each year. So, each year adds four blocks. So, over 12 years, that's 12*4=48.

So, that makes sense.

Therefore, the correct number of quilt blocks he has is 48.

So, I think initially, I made a mistake in counting the number of years as 11 instead of 12 because I didn't account for the inclusive count. So, the correct answer is 48.

**Final Answer**
The total number of quilt blocks Gene has is \boxed{48}.
</think>

Gene is sewing a quilt made up of old souvenir t-shirts, each from a different vacation. He goes on four vacations each year and has been doing this since he was 23. He is now 34. 

To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to determine the number of years he has been on vacations and then multiply by the number of blocks per year.

1. Calculate the number of years Gene has been on vacations:
   \[
   34 - 23 + 1 = 12 \text{ years}
   \]
   (We add 1 because both the starting and ending years are inclusive.)

2. Multiply the number of years by the number of blocks per year:
   \[
   12 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ blocks/year} = 48 \text{ blocks}
   \]

Thus, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is \(\boxed{48}\).
