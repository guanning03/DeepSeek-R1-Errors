Question:
A new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.  Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.  Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  One of them is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long.  They play for 4 hours.  How much money is used?

Correct Answer:
Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour
So he spends 3*.25=$<<3*.25=.75>>.75 an hour
His two friends add change 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times an hour
So they spend 6*.25=$<<6*.25=1.5>>1.5 an hour
His last friend puts in money 3/1.5=<<3/1.5=2>>2 times an hour
So he spends 2*.25=$<<2*.25=.50>>.50 an hour
So in total they spend .75+1.5+.5=$<<.75+1.5+.5=2.75>>2.75 an hour
So they spend 2.75*4=$<<2.75*4=11>>11 in the 4 hours

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jack and his three friends playing games at an arcade. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Sometimes I get confused with word problems, but I'll take it slow.

First, let me restate what the problem says to make sure I understand it. Jack goes to an arcade with his three friends, so there are four people in total. Jack can play a game for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. That means each game he plays takes 20 minutes and costs 25 cents. 

Now, two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long. Hmm, half as long as what? Half as long as Jack, I guess. So, if Jack plays for 20 minutes, these two friends can only play for 10 minutes each game. And the third friend is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack. So that would be 20 minutes multiplied by 1.5, which is 30 minutes per game.

They all play for a total of 4 hours. Wait, 4 hours is how long? That's 240 minutes because 4 times 60 is 240. So, the total time they play is 240 minutes.

But now, the question is asking how much money is used. So, we need to find the total cost in quarters, multiply by 25 cents to get the total money used.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many games each person played and then multiply by the cost per game.

First, let's figure out the duration each person can play per game:

- Jack: 20 minutes per game.
- Friend 1: 10 minutes per game.
- Friend 2: 10 minutes per game.
- Friend 3: 30 minutes per game.

Now, we need to see how many games each person can play in 240 minutes.

Starting with Jack: He can play 20 minutes per game. So, the number of games Jack can play is 240 divided by 20. Let me calculate that: 240 / 20 = 12. So, Jack can play 12 games.

Friend 1: He can play 10 minutes per game. So, 240 / 10 = 24 games. That's a lot!

Friend 2: Same as Friend 1, 24 games.

Friend 3: 30 minutes per game. So, 240 / 30 = 8 games.

Let me write that down:

- Jack: 12 games
- Friend 1: 24 games
- Friend 2: 24 games
- Friend 3: 8 games

Now, let's make sure that the total playing time adds up to 240 minutes.

For Jack: 12 games * 20 minutes = 240 minutes.

For Friend 1: 24 games * 10 minutes = 240 minutes.

Same for Friend 2: 24 * 10 = 240 minutes.

Friend 3: 8 games * 30 minutes = 240 minutes.

Wait, hold on. Each person is playing for the entire 240 minutes? That doesn't make sense because if all of them are playing their games the whole time, the total time would be much more. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says "they play for 4 hours." Does that mean each person plays for 4 hours, or that the entire session lasts 4 hours? That's a crucial detail. Let me read it again: "They play for 4 hours." So, it could be interpreted either way, but usually, when it says "they play for X hours," it often means each person plays X hours. But in this context, since they have different play durations per game, maybe they are all playing simultaneously?

Wait, that might make more sense. Maybe the total time they spend playing, considering their individual game durations, adds up to 4 hours. Hmm, but the wording is a bit unclear. Let me think.

If each person is playing for 4 hours, that would mean:

- Jack plays 12 games (12 * 20 = 240 minutes = 4 hours)
- Friend 1 plays 24 games (24 * 10 = 240 minutes = 4 hours)
- Friend 2 plays 24 games (24 * 10 = 240 minutes = 4 hours)
- Friend 3 plays 8 games (8 * 30 = 240 minutes = 4 hours)

But in that case, each person is playing individually for 4 hours, but how does that work at an arcade? Maybe they all play one after another. So, the total time would be 4 hours multiplied by four people, which is 16 hours. But that seems too long, and the question is asking for the money used, so maybe theyâ€™re each playing for 4 hours. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe all of them are playing simultaneously? So, they each play their games for 4 hours total. So, the total number of quarters needed would be the sum of all games played by each person.

Wait, let me try to think differently. Maybe the total time they spend playing is 4 hours. So, the combined time all four of them play is 4 hours. That is, the sum of individual playtimes is 240 minutes.

So, for each person, the number of games they play multiplied by their game duration adds up to 240 minutes.

So, let's denote:

- Let G1 be the number of games Jack plays.
- Let G2 be the number of games Friend 1 plays.
- Let G3 be the number of games Friend 2 plays.
- Let G4 be the number of games Friend 3 plays.

Then, the total time is:

20*G1 + 10*G2 + 10*G3 + 30*G4 = 240 minutes.

But we don't know how many games each person plays. Hmm, so perhaps they all play until the total time is 4 hours, but each person can play games at different paces.

Wait, maybe it's a simultaneous play? So, all four are playing at the same time, but each game takes different amounts of time for each person.

But that also doesn't make much sense, because each person has their own games.

Wait, maybe they each play one game after another, so the total time is 4 hours, and we need to figure out how many games each person can play within that time.

But then, since each person has different game durations, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe the total time is 4 hours, and each person is playing as many games as possible within that time, but each game takes different time for each person.

Wait, that would mean each person can play a different number of games, depending on how long each game takes.

So, we need to figure out how many games each person can play in 240 minutes, depending on their individual game durations.

So, Jack plays 20 minutes per game: 240 / 20 = 12 games.

Friend 1: 240 / 10 = 24 games.

Friend 2: same as Friend 1, 24 games.

Friend 3: 240 / 30 = 8 games.

So, in total, they play 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 games.

Each game is 1 quarter, so total quarters needed are 68. So, 68 quarters times 25 cents each.

Wait, 68 quarters is 68 * 25 cents.

But let me double-check my understanding. If they each play for 4 hours, meaning each person is playing for 240 minutes, then yes, they can play that many games.

But if they were all playing simultaneously, the total duration would be the maximum of their individual playtimes, but since each person is playing their own games, maybe they can interleave.

But in most cases, when a problem says "they play for X hours," it usually means each person plays for X hours individually. So, in this case, each person is playing for 4 hours, each with their own games.

So, each person's number of games is determined by their individual game duration.

So, Jack plays 12 games, Friend 1: 24, Friend 2: 24, Friend 3: 8.

So, total number of games is 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 games.

Each game costs 1 quarter, so 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is 25 cents, total cost is 68 * 0.25 dollars.

Calculating that: 68 / 4 = 17. So, 17 dollars.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, each person's number of games:

Jack: 240 / 20 = 12.

Friend 1: 240 / 10 = 24.

Friend 2: same as Friend 1: 24.

Friend 3: 240 / 30 = 8.

Total games: 12 + 24 + 24 + 8.

Let me add that: 12 + 24 is 36, plus 24 is 60, plus 8 is 68. So, 68 games.

Each game is 1 quarter, so 68 quarters.

Convert quarters to dollars: 68 * 0.25 = 17.

So, total money used is 17 dollars.

Is there another way to interpret the problem? Maybe all four are playing together, and each game takes the maximum time of all their games. But that seems unlikely because each person is playing their own sets.

Alternatively, maybe it's the total time spent by all players is 4 hours. So, the sum of all their individual game times is 240 minutes.

So, 20*G1 + 10*G2 + 10*G3 + 30*G4 = 240.

But since we don't have more information, we can't determine individual G1, G2, G3, G4. But the problem says "they play for 4 hours," which is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, if it's a total of 4 hours, meaning 240 minutes, as in the sum of all their playing time is 240 minutes, then we can't solve it because we have one equation with four variables.

But maybe they all finish at the same time, which would mean that the time each person plays is the same, but that also doesn't make much sense.

Wait, the problem says they play for 4 hours, which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean each person plays for 4 hours, or the total time they play is 4 hours. Since it's ambiguous, but in the context, I think it's more likely that each person plays for 4 hours, so each person is playing for 4 hours with their own games.

Therefore, my initial calculation of 68 games, 68 quarters, 17 dollars, is correct.

Wait, but let me check the arithmetic again. 20 minutes per game for Jack: 240 / 20 is 12 games. 10 minutes per game for the other two: 240 / 10 is 24 games each. 30 minutes per game for the better friend: 240 / 30 is 8 games.

12 + 24 + 24 + 8, which is 68 games. 68 quarters: each quarter is 25 cents, so 68 * 0.25 = 17.

Yes, that seems right.

Alternatively, if they were all playing the same game, but no, the problem says Jack can play a game for 20 minutes, and others can play half as long or 1.5 times as long. So, each person has their own game duration.

So, yes, 68 quarters is 17 dollars.

Therefore, the total money used is 17 dollars.

**Final Answer**
The total money used is \boxed{17} dollars.
</think>

Jack and his three friends play games at an arcade for a total of 4 hours. Each game Jack plays takes 20 minutes, while his two friends can play for half that time (10 minutes each) and the third friend can play for 1.5 times as long (30 minutes). 

First, we calculate the number of games each person can play in 4 hours (240 minutes):

- Jack can play \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \) games.
- Each of the two friends can play \( \frac{240}{10} = 24 \) games.
- The third friend can play \( \frac{240}{30} = 8 \) games.

Next, we sum the total number of games played by all four friends:
- Jack: 12 games
- Friend 1: 24 games
- Friend 2: 24 games
- Friend 3: 8 games

Total games played: \( 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 \) games.

Each game costs 1 quarter (25 cents), so the total cost in quarters is 68. Converting this to dollars, we have:
- \( 68 \times 0.25 = 17 \) dollars.

Thus, the total money used is \(\boxed{17}\) dollars.
