Tokens: 2226.0

Question:
The girls are trying to raise money for a carnival. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430, and Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. How much money, in dollars, did they all raise in total?

Correct Answer:
Kim raises 320+430=<<320+430=750>>750 dollars.
Maryam raises 400+300=<<400+300=700>>700 dollars.
They raise 750+430+400+700=<<750+430+400+700=2280>>2280 dollars.
#### 2280

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out how much money the girls raised in total for the carnival. Let's see, the problem gives me some information about how much each girl raised compared to others. Hmm, it mentions Kim, Alexandra, Maryam, and Sarah. So, four girls in total.

First, let me note down the information given. It says, "Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430." Wait, so does that mean Kim's amount is $320 more than what Alexandra got? And Alexandra herself raised $430. Okay, so I can calculate Kim's contribution by adding $320 to $430. Let me write that down.

So, if Alexandra raised $430, then Kim raised $430 + $320. Let me compute that: 430 plus 320. Hmm, 400 plus 300 is 700, and 30 plus 20 is 50, so 700 plus 50 is $750. So, Kim raised $750.

Next, the problem says, "Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300." So, Sarah raised $300, and Maryam raised $400 more than that. Let me calculate Maryam's amount. That would be $300 + $400. 300 plus 400 is $700. So, Maryam raised $700.

Wait, let me just make sure I got that right. So, Sarah is $300, Maryam is Sarah's amount plus $400 more. Yeah, that seems correct. So, $300 plus $400 is $700. Maryam's total is $700.

Now, we have the amounts for both pairs. Let me list them out:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

So, to find the total amount raised by all four girls, I need to add up these four amounts. Let me write that out:

Total = Alexandra + Kim + Sarah + Maryam

Plugging in the numbers:

Total = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700

Let me add these step by step. First, I can add $430 and $750. 430 plus 750. Hmm, 400 + 700 is 1100, and 30 + 50 is 80, so 1100 + 80 is $1180.

Then, I have to add Sarah's $300. So, $1180 + $300. That's straightforward, 1180 + 300 is $1480.

Now, I need to add Maryam's $700 to that. So, $1480 + $700. 1400 + 700 is 2100, and 80 remains, so total is $2180.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that addition because I feel like that might not be correct. So, if I add $430 + $750, that's 430 + 750. 400 + 700 is 1100, and 30 + 50 is 80, so 1180. Then, 1180 + 300 is 1480. Then, 1480 + 700. 1480 + 700. Let me think, 1000 + 700 is 1700, plus 480 is 2180. Okay, that seems consistent.

But let me add them in a different order to verify. Maybe group the smaller numbers first. So, $430 + $300 is $730. Then, $750 + $700 is $1450. Then, add those two totals together: $730 + $1450. 700 + 1400 is 2100, and 30 + 50 is 80, so 2180. Same result. Okay, that seems consistent.

Just to be thorough, let me add all four numbers together in one go:

$430 + $750 + $300 + $700

Let me add $430 and $750 first: 430 + 750. 400 + 700 is 1100, 30 + 50 is 80. So, 1100 + 80 = 1180.

Then, add $300: 1180 + 300 = 1480.

Then, add $700: 1480 + 700. 1480 + 700: 1000 + 700 is 1700, 480 + 0 is 480. So, 1700 + 480. 1700 + 400 is 2100, plus 80 is 2180. Yep, same total.

Alternatively, I can add them all together in a column:

430
750
300
700
------

Let me stack them vertically:

430
750
300
700
-----
?

Adding the units place: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

Tens place: 3 + 5 + 0 + 0 = 8

Hundreds place: 4 + 7 + 3 + 7 = 21

So, writing that down, 21 in the hundreds place, carry over 2 to the thousands.

But wait, actually, let me do it more carefully.

Wait, in the units column, it's 0, so 0.

Tens column: 3 (from 430) + 5 (from 750) + 0 (from 300) + 0 (from 700) = 8. So, 8 in the tens place.

Hundreds column: 4 (from 430) + 7 (from 750) + 3 (from 300) + 7 (from 700) = 4 + 7 is 11, 11 + 3 is 14, 14 + 7 is 21. So, 21 in the hundreds place. So, we put 1 in the hundreds and carry over 2 to the thousands.

Thousands place: we have 0 from all except any carryover. So, 2 is carried over, so 2 in thousands place.

Putting it all together: 2 in thousands, 1 in hundreds, 8 in tens, 0 in units. So, 2180. That's correct.

Alright, so the total amount raised is $2180.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't misread anything. The problem says, "Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430." So, yeah, Kim is 430 + 320 = 750.

Then, Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam is 300 + 400 = 700.

So, adding all four: 430 + 750 + 300 + 700. Let me add 430 + 300 first: 730. Then, 750 + 700: 1450. Then, 730 + 1450: 2180. Yep, same as before.

Just to be absolutely thorough, let me add them in another order: 430 + 700 + 750 + 300.

430 + 700 = 1130

750 + 300 = 1050

1130 + 1050. 1000 + 1000 is 2000, 130 + 50 is 180, so 2180. Yep, same result.

Alright, I feel confident that the total is $2180.

**Final Answer**
The total amount of money raised by the girls is \boxed{2180} dollars.
</think>

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. Therefore, Kim's contribution is calculated as follows:
\[
430 + 320 = 750
\]

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. Therefore, Maryam's contribution is calculated as follows:
\[
300 + 400 = 700
\]

The amounts raised by each girl are:
- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

To find the total amount raised, we add these amounts together:
\[
430 + 750 + 300 + 700
\]

Adding step-by-step:
\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480
\]
\[
1480 + 700 = 2180
\]

Thus, the total amount of money raised by the girls is \boxed{2180} dollars.
