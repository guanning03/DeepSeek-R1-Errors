Question:
Two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head.  Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree.  This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.  How many apples did he bring home?

Correct Answer:
Two apples fell out of the tree, and Newton threw one away, leaving him with 2-1=<<2-1=1>>1 apples.
5 more apples fell out of the tree, bringing his total to 5+1=<<5+1=6>>6 apples.
Newton threw one at the tree, leaving him with 6-1=<<6-1=5>>5 apples.
6 more apples fell out of the tree, bringing Newton's apple collection to a total of 5+6=<<5+6=11>>11 apples.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, let me try to figure out this apple problem step by step. So, the question is about Newton and some apples that fell from a tree. Let me break it down and see how many apples he ends up bringing home.

First, it says two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head. Hmm, so initially, two apples are on the ground. One is on Newton's head, and the other is somewhere else. So, Newton picks up the two apples. Wait, does that mean he picks up both? Or just the one that fell off? Hmm, the wording says, "Two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head." So, he picked up the two apples. So, he has both in his possession.

Okay, so he picks up both, so he now has two apples. Then, the problem says he put one in his pocket and threw the other into the tree. So, he's holding one in his pocket and sending the other into the tree. But wait, when he threw that one into the tree, causing five more apples to fall out? So, throwing one apple into the tree results in five more apples falling. That's interesting.

So, let me note this down:

1. Two apples fall: two apples on the ground.
2. Newton picks up both, so he has two apples.
3. He puts one in his pocket and throws the other into the tree. Throwing that one causes five more apples to fall.

So, after this action, there were five more apples that fell out. So, how many apples are there now?

Initially, two apples fell. One was on his head, and one was on the ground. He picks up both, so he has two. Then he throws one into the tree, which causes five more to fall. So, the total number of apples on the ground now is five.

Wait, so before he threw the apple, he had two apples: one on the ground, one in his pocket. He threw one into the tree, which made five more fall. So, the number of apples on the ground is now five.

So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's see. So, he picks up two apples: one on the ground, one on his head. Then, he throws one of the apples into the tree, which causes five more apples to fall. So, he had two apples, put one in his pocket, so he has one apple left, which he threw into the tree. But throwing that apple made five more fall. So, the total number of apples on the ground is now five.

Wait, so initially two apples fell. He picks up both, so he removes two from the ground. Then, he throws one into the tree, and five more fall. So, net change: he took two apples off the ground, threw one into the tree, which caused five more to fall. So, the net apples on the ground are five. Therefore, total apples after this action is five.

Wait, that seems confusing. Let me try to map it step by step.

Start: Two apples on the ground.

Newton picks up both apples: so now he has two, and the ground has zero.

He puts one in his pocket, so he has one apple in his pocket, and the other he throws into the tree.

But throwing that apple into the tree causes five more apples to fall. So, when he throws that one apple, five more fall from the tree.

So, after this, how many apples are on the ground?

Initially, two apples fell. Newton picks up both, so he has two. Then, he puts one in his pocket and throws the other. Throwing that one causes five more to fall. So, the apples on the ground: before throwing, there were zero. After throwing, five more fall. So, total on the ground now is five. So, Newton has one apple in his pocket, and five on the ground.

But wait, is the apple he threw into the tree considered? The problem says "causing five more apples to fall out of the tree." So, throwing the apple into the tree doesn't mean it's still in the tree; it's just that the action of throwing it into the tree causes five more to fall. So, the apple he threw is still in the air, perhaps? Or is it now on the ground?

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read that part: "Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree."

Wait, after the first part, he had put one in his pocket and thrown the other into the tree, which caused five more to fall. So, now, after that, he picked up the remaining apples. Wait, so he had put one in his pocket, and then what happened to the other?

Wait, hold on, maybe I misread the first part.

Wait, let's parse the problem again:

Two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie. How many apples did he bring home?

Okay, so first, two apples fell. One on the ground, one on his head. Then, he picks up the two apples. So, he has both.

Then, he puts one in his pocket and throws the other into the tree. So, he's holding one in his pocket, and he's thrown one into the tree. But when he threw that one into the tree, five more fell. So, maybe now, the total number of apples on the ground is five. So, he has one in his pocket, and five on the ground.

So, he picks up these apples, meaning he goes and collects them. So, he picks up the five on the ground, and the one in his pocket. So, he has six apples.

Then, he puts all but one into his pocket. So, he has six apples. He puts all but one into his pocket, meaning he keeps one and puts the rest in his pocket. So, he's left with one apple, which he throws at the tree. So, he throws that one apple, and this causes another six apples to fall out.

So, after that, he picks up all remaining apples and goes home. So, let's see:

First, after the first throw, he has one apple in his pocket and five on the ground.

He picks up the five on the ground, so now he has six apples: one in his pocket, five on the ground.

He puts all but one into his pocket. So, he keeps one and puts the other five into his pocket. So, he now has six apples: one in his pocket, five on the ground.

Wait, no, he had six apples: one in pocket, five on the ground. He puts all but one into his pocket. So, all except one: so he takes the five on the ground and puts them into his pocket. So, he now has six apples in his pocket: one original and five, but he threw one more into the tree.

Wait, no, this is getting confusing.

Wait, let me model it step by step.

1. Two apples fall: one on Newton's head, one on the ground.

2. Newton picks up both: he has two apples, one on the ground, one in his hand.

3. He puts one in his pocket and throws the other into the tree. So, he's holding one in his pocket. He throws the other into the tree.

4. Throwing that apple into the tree causes five more apples to fall. So, those five apples are on the ground.

So, now, the ground has five apples. Newton has one apple in his pocket.

5. Now, he picks up these apples. So, he goes and collects the five on the ground. So, he picks up the five, and adds them to the one in his pocket. So, he now has six apples.

6. He puts all but one into his pocket. So, he keeps one and puts the other five into his pocket. So, he has six apples: five in his pocket, one on the ground.

7. He then throws that one remaining apple at the tree. Throwing that apple causes six more apples to fall. So, six more on the ground.

8. Now, he picks up all the remaining apples. So, he picks up the six on the ground and adds them to whatever he had in his pocket. But wait, in step 6, he had five in his pocket and one on the ground. Then, he threw that one, causing six more to fall. So, after step 7, he has six on the ground.

Therefore, he picks up the six on the ground, and adds them to his current holding.

Wait, but in step 6, he had five in his pocket and one on the ground. He threw the one on the ground, causing six more to fall. So, after that, he has six on the ground. Then, he picks up all remaining apples, so he picks up those six on the ground.

But what about the five in his pocket? He already had those. So, does he add them to his pocket, or does he just take the six on the ground?

Wait, the problem says: "Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie."

Wait, so "these apples" refers to the five on the ground, right? So, after he threw the one into the tree, causing six more to fall, he picks up all the remaining apples.

So, the remaining apples: six on the ground.

So, he picks up six apples and goes home.

Wait, but in the prior step, he had five in his pocket. So, does he add the six to his pocket? Or does he just take the six on the ground?

Hmm, the problem says: "Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home." So, it might be that after he threw the one apple, which caused six more to fall, he picks up all the remaining apples, which would be six on the ground.

Therefore, he brings home six apples.

Wait, but let me make sure.

Wait, so let's model it with numbers.

Start: Two apples. One on the ground, one on Newton's head.

Newton picks up both: he has two apples. One on the ground, one in his pocket.

He puts one in his pocket, throws the other. So, he throws one apple into the tree, which causes five more to fall.

So, after that, he has one apple in his pocket, and five on the ground.

He picks up these apples. So, he collects the five on the ground. So, he has five on the ground and one in his pocket.

He puts all but one into his pocket. So, he keeps one, puts the other five into his pocket. Now, he has six apples: five in his pocket, one on the ground.

He throws that one remaining apple at the tree, which causes six more to fall.

So, now, he has six on the ground.

He picks up all of the remaining apples. So, he picks up the six on the ground. So, he now has six apples in his pocket, and he throws none. So, he brings home six apples.

Wait, but hold on. After he throws the one apple, which causes six more to fall, he picks up all remaining apples. So, the six on the ground. So, he picks up six apples and brings them home.

But in the process, he had five in his pocket before. Does he add the six to his pocket or separate them?

Wait, the problem says he "picked up all of the remaining apples." So, regardless of where they are, he picks them all up and goes home. So, if he had five in his pocket and six on the ground, he would have 11 apples. But the problem says, in the prior step, he threw one apple, causing six more to fall. So, after that, he had six on the ground, and he picks up all remaining, meaning he picks up six apples.

But wait, let me think again.

Wait, when he threw the apple into the tree, it caused six more to fall. So, before that, he had one on the ground, and after throwing, he had six more. So, in total, after throwing, he had six on the ground. Then, he picks up all those six, so he brings home six apples.

Alternatively, maybe he had five on the ground, put one in his pocket, then after throwing, he had six on the ground, which he picks up.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to outline each step mathematically.

Let me denote:

After step 1: Two apples on the ground (G1 = 2), one on Newton's head (H1 = 1).

After step 2: Newton picks up both, so G1 becomes 0, and he has P1 = 2 apples.

After step 3: He puts one in his pocket and throws the other. So, P1 becomes 1 apple, and he throws one apple into the tree, which causes G2 = 5 apples to fall.

So, G2 = 5.

After step 4: Newton picks up the five apples on the ground, so G2 becomes 0, and he adds them to his pocket. So, P2 = 1 (from step 3) + 5 = 6 apples.

Then, he puts all but one into his pocket, so he keeps one and puts five into his pocket. So, P3 = 5 apples, and G3 = 1 apple.

He then throws that one apple, which causes G4 = 6 apples to fall.

So, G4 = 6.

After that, he picks up all remaining apples, which is G4 = 6 apples.

Therefore, he brings home 6 apples.

Wait, so in step 5, he picks up all remaining apples, which are the six on the ground, so he brings home six.

But in the process, he had five in his pocket before. So, does he add them to the six he just picked up? Or does he just have six?

The problem says he "picked up all of the remaining apples and went home." So, regardless of where they are, he picks them all up. So, if he had five in his pocket and six on the ground, he would have 11 apples. But the problem doesn't mention him adding them to his pocket, just picking up all the remaining.

Wait, but in the problem statement, "Newton picked up the two apples and put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out." So, after that, he has one apple in his pocket, and five on the ground.

Then, he "picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree." So, he picks up the five on the ground, puts all but one into his pocket, and throws the remaining one. After that, he has six on the ground.

Then, he "picked up all of the remaining apples." So, he picks up the six on the ground, bringing them home.

Therefore, he had five in his pocket before, but after that, he didn't add them to his pocket, just picked up the six on the ground.

Wait, but in the problem, he picked up the apples after putting one in his pocket and throwing the other.

Wait, let me parse it again:

"Two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie. How many apples did he bring home?"

So, the "these apples" refers to the five that fell after he threw the apple. So, after he threw one apple, causing five more to fall, he "picked up these apples," meaning he picks up the five on the ground. Then, he puts all but one into his pocket and throws the remaining one, which causes six more to fall. Then, he picks up all remaining apples, which are the six on the ground.

Therefore, the total he brings home is six apples.

But wait, let me think again.

When he threw the apple into the tree, that caused five more to fall. So, five on the ground. Then, he picks up all these five, so he has five in his pocket? Or he just adds them to his existing one.

Wait, no. Let me track the pocket apples.

First, he picks up two apples: one on the ground, one in his pocket.

He throws one into the tree, so he had one in his pocket, and he throws one into the tree, which causes five more to fall.

So, now, the apples on the ground: five.

Then, he picks up these five apples. So, he picks up the five on the ground, and adds them to whatever he had in his pocket. But he had one in his pocket before, right? Because he had picked up two, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree.

Wait, so he had one in his pocket, then he threw the other into the tree, which caused five more to fall. Then, after that, he picks up the five on the ground. So, he picks up five more, and now he has one in his pocket and five on the ground.

But then, the problem says: "Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree."

So, "these apples" are the five on the ground. So, he picks up the five, puts all but one into his pocket, and throws the remaining one. So, he was holding one in his pocket, then he picks up five, puts four into his pocket, and throws one, which causes six more to fall.

So, after that, he has four in his pocket and one on the ground. Then, he throws the one, which causes six more to fall. So, now, he picks up the six on the ground, bringing home six.

Wait, so let's go step by step:

1. Two apples on the ground, one on Newton's head.

2. Newton picks up both: he has one in his pocket and one on the ground.

3. He throws the one on the ground into the tree, which causes five more to fall. So, five on the ground. Now, he has one in his pocket.

4. He picks up these five on the ground: so he now has one in his pocket and five on the ground.

5. He puts all but one into his pocket: so he puts four into his pocket, keeps one on the ground, and throws it, which causes six more to fall. So, six on the ground.

6. Now, he picks up all remaining apples: six on the ground.

Therefore, he brings home six apples.

Wait, so that makes sense. So, in the end, he has six apples.

But let me verify one more time.

First, two apples: one on the ground, one on head.

Picks up both: one in pocket, one on ground.

Throws one into the tree, causing five more to fall: now five on ground.

He picks up these five, puts four into his pocket, keeps one on ground.

Throws that one, causing six more to fall: now six on ground.

Picks up all remaining: six.

So, he brings home six.

Alternatively, if we think that after step 4, he has one in pocket, five on ground. Then, when he throws the one, causing six more to fall, making it six on ground. Then, he picks up the six on ground, bringing home six.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Wait, but if we think about it, after he threw the one apple (step 3), he had five on the ground. Then, he picks up those five, puts four into his pocket, keeps one, throws it (step 5). So, before step 5, he had four in his pocket, one on ground. Then, he throws the one, which causes six more to fall, making six on ground. Then, he picks up six on ground.

Therefore, he brings home six.

But wait, is there another way to interpret the problem? Let me check.

Wait, in step 3, he throws one into the tree, causing five more to fall. So, five on the ground.

Then, he picks up these apples: so, five on the ground.

He puts all but one into his pocket: so, keeps one, puts four into his pocket.

Then, he throws the remaining one: which causes six more to fall.

Then, he picks up all remaining apples, which are six on the ground.

So, he brings home six.

Alternatively, if after step 5, he throws the one, which causes six more to fall, but does he pick up the five that were on the ground before he threw the sixth one? Or is it that he had four in his pocket, one on ground, then he throws the last one, which causes six more to fall, making six on ground, and then he picks up all of them.

Yes, that's consistent.

Therefore, he brings home six apples.

But wait, let me see if the answer is 6 or 11. Because in the step where he had five in his pocket and one on the ground, he throws the one, which causes six more to fall, making six on the ground, and then he picks up all of the remaining apples, so six on the ground.

But if he had four in his pocket, that's separate. So, does he add four to six, making ten? Wait, no, because in step 5, he "picked up all of the remaining apples." So, "remaining" likely refers to the ones on the ground, which are six. So, he picks up six, bringing them home.

But hold on, in step 4, he had four in his pocket and one on the ground. Then, he threw the one, causing six more to fall. So, the six are on the ground. So, when he picks up all remaining apples, it's the six on the ground.

Therefore, he brings home six apples.

Alternatively, if "remaining" includes the ones in his pocket, then it's four plus six, making ten. But since he had four in his pocket, and then he threw the one, which caused six more to fall, the remaining apples are the six on the ground. So, he picks up six.

But wait, the problem says: "Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie." So, "remaining" likely refers to the ones that are on the ground, not in his pocket. So, he picks up six, bringing home six.

Therefore, the answer is six.

But wait, in the problem statement, it's a bit ambiguous whether "remaining" includes the ones in his pocket or not. But given the way it's worded, I think it's only the ones on the ground.

Let me see how the problem is structured:

First, two apples fell: one on head, one on ground.

Newton picks up both: one in pocket, one on ground.

Throws one into the tree, causing five more to fall: now five on ground.

He picks up these five: so, he picks up five, which he adds to his existing one? Or does he just take them? Wait, if he picks up the five on the ground, he adds them to whatever he had.

But in the problem, it's stated as: "Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree."

So, "these apples" refers to the five on the ground. So, he picks up the five, puts all but one into his pocket, so he keeps one, and throws the remaining one. So, he had one in his pocket before, then he picks up five, puts four into his pocket, keeps one, and throws it.

Therefore, after that, he has four in his pocket, one on the ground.

Then, he throws that one, which causes six more to fall: now six on the ground.

He picks up all of the remaining apples: six on the ground.

So, he brings home six.

Alternatively, if he had four in his pocket, and six on the ground, that would be ten. But the problem says he "picked up all of the remaining apples," which are the six on the ground.

Therefore, the answer is six.

Wait, but let me think again: when he throws the one apple into the tree, causing six more to fall. So, six more on the ground. Then, he picks up all of the remaining apples, which are the six. So, he brings home six.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, is there another way to interpret it?

Wait, perhaps when he threw the one apple into the tree, causing five more to fall, making five on the ground. Then, he picks up the five, puts all but one into his pocket, so four in his pocket, keeps one. Then, he throws the one, causing six more to fall, so six on the ground. Then, he picks up all of the remaining apples, which are six on the ground.

Therefore, bringing home six.

So, yeah, six.

But wait, the problem says: "Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree."

So, after that, he has one in his pocket, five on the ground.

Then, he picks up these apples (the five on the ground), puts all but one into his pocket, and throws the remaining one. So, that's one on the ground, he throws it, causing six more to fall.

So, six more on the ground.

Then, he picks up all of the remaining apples. So, the six on the ground.

Therefore, he brings home six.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the answer is six.

But let me just see if I can find a different interpretation.

Wait, when he throws the one apple into the tree, causing five more to fall. So, five on the ground. Then, he picks up these five, puts all but one into his pocket, which would be four, and throws the remaining one, which causes six more to fall.

So, after that, he has four in his pocket, one on the ground.

Then, he throws the one on the ground, which causes six more to fall, so six on the ground.

Then, he picks up all of the remaining apples: six on the ground.

So, he brings home six.

Therefore, the answer is six.

**Final Answer**
Newton brought home \boxed{6} apples.
</think>

First, two apples fell out of the tree: one landed on Newton's head, and the other was on the ground. Newton picked up both apples, placing one in his pocket and throwing the other into the tree, which caused five more apples to fall out. This results in five apples on the ground.

Newton then picked up these five apples, putting all but one into his pocket and throwing the remaining one at the tree. This action caused six more apples to fall, leaving six apples on the ground.

Finally, Newton picked up all of the remaining apples, which were the six on the ground. Therefore, Newton brought home six apples.
