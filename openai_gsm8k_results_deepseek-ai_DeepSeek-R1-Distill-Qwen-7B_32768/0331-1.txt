Question:
Chase and Rider can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days; but on two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. How many times do they ride their bikes a week?

Correct Answer:
Each person rides his bike 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 times for 5 days.
Together, they ride 15+15 = <<15+15=30>>30 times for five days.
Each person rides his bike 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 times for every day of the other two days.
This means each person rides 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 times on each day of the other two days.
The total for the other two days is 12+12 = <<12+12=24>>24
For the whole week the together ride 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 times
#### 54

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week. Let me try to break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand the problem correctly.

First, the problem says that they can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. Hmm, okay, so that's 3 times each day, right? And this is for 5 days. Then, on two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. Wait, so those two days are different from the first 5 days, right?

Let me try to parse this. So, for 5 days, they ride 3 times each day. That seems straightforward. Then, on two other days, they ride twice as much as on the usual days. So, if their usual day is 3 rides, then on those two days, they ride 3 times 2, which is 6 times each day. Is that correct? Or does it mean that on those two days, they ride twice the number of times they do on each of the usual days?

Wait, let me read it again: "they ride twice the times they do on usual days." Hmm, so if on usual days, they ride 3 times, then on these two other days, they ride twice that amount, so 6 times each. That seems like what it means. So, on each of those two days, they ride 6 times.

So, let me summarize. They have 5 days where they ride 3 times each day, and 2 days where they ride 6 times each day. So, to find the total number of rides in a week, I need to calculate the rides for the first 5 days and then add the rides for the next 2 days.

Let me write that out:

Total rides = (Number of usual days × number of rides per usual day) + (Number of special days × number of rides per special day)

So, plugging in the numbers:

Total rides = (5 days × 3 rides/day) + (2 days × 6 rides/day)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 5 days times 3 rides per day: 5 × 3 is 15.

Then, 2 days times 6 rides per day: 2 × 6 is 12.

Now, adding those two results together: 15 + 12 = 27.

Wait, so does that mean they ride their bikes 27 times in a week? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, 5 days at 3 rides: 5 × 3 is indeed 15. Then, 2 days at 6 rides: 2 × 6 is 12. Adding 15 and 12 together, that's 27. Hmm, that seems correct.

But just to make sure, let me think about it another way. Maybe adding them up day by day.

So, for each of the first 5 days, they ride 3 times. So, day 1: 3 rides, day 2: 3, day 3:3, day 4:3, day 5:3. So, that's 5 days with 3 each: 5×3=15.

Then, for the next two days, which are the special days, they ride twice as much as on usual days. Since on usual days they ride 3 times, on these days they ride 6 times each. So, day 6:6 rides, day 7:6 rides. That's 2 days with 6 each: 2×6=12.

Adding those together: 15 + 12 = 27. Yeah, same result.

Wait a second, is there another interpretation of the problem? Maybe the "twice the times" refers to something else. Let me read the problem again carefully.

"Chase and Rider can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days; but on two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days."

Hmm, so maybe the "usual days" are the 5 days, and on the other two days, they ride twice as much as on the usual days. So, on the usual days, they ride 3 times, so on the special days, they ride 6 times each. That's how I interpreted it earlier.

Alternatively, is it possible that "they ride twice the times they do on usual days" meaning that on the two other days, they ride twice the total number of times they did on the usual days? But that interpretation doesn't seem to make much sense because it would be a total of twice 15, which is 30, but then adding that to the 15 would make it 45, which seems too high.

Wait, let's see: If on the usual days, they ride 3 times each day, so 5 days ×3=15. Then, on the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. So, does that mean 2 ×15=30? So, 15 (usual days) + 30 (special days) =45.

But that seems contradictory to the wording. It says "they ride twice the times they do on usual days." It sounds like on each special day, they ride twice as many times as they do on a usual day. So, each special day is 2×3=6. So, 2 days ×6=12. Then, total is 15+12=27.

Yeah, that seems more reasonable. Because if it were 2×15, that's 30, and adding that to 15 gives 45, which is a lot. So, probably 2× per day, not 2× the total.

So, I think 27 is the correct answer.

But let me make sure. Let's think in terms of units. They are riding bikes a certain number of times a day. So, each day they have a certain number of bike rides.

So, on each usual day, it's 3 rides. On each special day, it's 6 rides.

So, over 5 days, that's 5×3=15. On 2 days, that's 2×6=12. So, total rides per week is 15+12=27.

I think that makes sense.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is:

Total number of days in a week is 7. They ride 3 times on 5 days and 6 times on 2 days.

So, 5×3 + 2×6 =15 +12=27.

Yes, that's consistent.

Wait, another thought: Is "twice the times they do on usual days" referring to something else, like twice as many days? Hmm, that would be a different interpretation. Like, maybe on two other days, they ride their bikes twice as many times as they usually do on each day. But that's how I interpreted it.

Alternatively, if "twice the times" refers to twice the number of days, but that doesn't make sense because they already have 5 days, and the two other days are fixed.

So, I think the original interpretation is correct. The two other days, they ride twice the number of times they ride on the usual days. Since on usual days they ride 3 times, on the special days they ride 6 times each. So, 5×3 +2×6=27.

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27.

**Final Answer**
The total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is \boxed{27}.
</think>

Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. On two other days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days. 

First, we calculate the number of rides on the usual 5 days:
\[
5 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 15 \text{ rides}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of rides on the two special days, where they ride twice the usual amount (6 rides each day):
\[
2 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ rides/day} = 12 \text{ rides}
\]

Adding these together gives the total number of rides in a week:
\[
15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}
\]

Thus, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is \boxed{27}.
