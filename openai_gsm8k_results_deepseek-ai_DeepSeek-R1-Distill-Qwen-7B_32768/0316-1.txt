Question:
It is approximately 1955 kilometers from San Diego, California to New York City, New York. If Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, how many kilometers will she still need to drive?

Correct Answer:
325 * 4 = <<325*4=1300>>1300 km
1955 - 1300 = <<1955-1300=655>>655 km
Bernice will still have 655 kilometers to travel.
#### 655

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: Bernice is driving from San Diego, California to New York City, New York, and the total distance is approximately 1955 kilometers. She's already driven 325 kilometers over 4 days, and I need to figure out how many kilometers she still needs to drive. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to make sure I understand the question correctly. It's asking for the remaining distance Bernice has to cover after she's already driven part of the way. So, essentially, I need to subtract the distance she's already driven from the total distance.

Alright, so total distance is 1955 km, and she's driven 325 km. To find the remaining distance, I can subtract 325 from 1955. That should give me the answer. Let me write that down:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance driven
Remaining distance = 1955 km - 325 km

Now, I can do the subtraction. Hmm, 1955 minus 325. Let me do this step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.

Starting from the rightmost digit: 5 minus 5 is 0. Next, moving to the tens place: 5 minus 2 is 3. Then, moving to the hundreds place: 9 minus 3 is 6. Finally, the thousands place: 1 minus 0 is 1. So putting those together, 1955 minus 325 equals 1630.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check that. Maybe I should write it down vertically to avoid any mistakes.

Let's set it up like this:

```
 1955
- 325
------
```

Starting from the units place: 5 - 5 = 0.

Then, tens place: 5 - 2 = 3.

Hundreds place: 9 - 3 = 6.

Thousands place: 1 - 0 = 1.

So, yes, that gives me 1630. So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

Wait a second, is this realistic? 1955 km is roughly the distance from San Diego to New York, right? So if she's driven 325 km in 4 days, that's about 81 km per day on average. Depending on her speed, that might make sense. But the question isn't asking about the time or the speed, just the remaining distance.

So, maybe I don't need to consider anything else here. The problem is straightforward: subtract the distance driven from the total distance.

Alternatively, if I wanted to check my subtraction another way, I could add 325 to 1630 to see if I get 1955.

Let's try that: 1630 + 325.

Starting from the units place: 0 + 5 = 5.

Tens place: 3 + 2 = 5.

Hundreds place: 6 + 3 = 9.

Thousands place: 1 + 0 = 1.

So, 1630 + 325 = 1955, which matches the total distance. That confirms that my subtraction was correct.

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

**Final Answer**
Bernice still needs to drive \boxed{1630} kilometers.
</think>

To determine how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance. The total distance from San Diego to New York is 1955 kilometers, and she has driven 325 kilometers. 

The calculation is as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining distance} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance driven}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining distance} = 1955 \, \text{km} - 325 \, \text{km}
\]

Performing the subtraction:

\[
1955 - 325 = 1630
\]

Thus, Bernice still needs to drive \boxed{1630} kilometers.
