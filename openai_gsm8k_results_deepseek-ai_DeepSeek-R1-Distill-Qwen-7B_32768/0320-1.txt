Question:
Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year.  She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.  Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine.  How many magazines does she get every year?

Correct Answer:
She has 3 magazines that send 12 issues so that’s 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 issues
Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine so that’s 4*6 = <<4*6=24>>24 issues
All total she receives 36+24+6 = <<36+24+6=66>>66 magazine issues a year
#### 66

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Susan orders some magazines, and I need to figure out how many magazines she gets every year. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says she orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year. Hmm, okay, so that's three different magazines, each getting 12 issues annually. So, for these three, the number of issues per magazine is 12. I'm not sure if that's relevant yet, but maybe it'll become clear.

Then, she has 1 magazine that sends her 6 issues a year. So that's another magazine, this one getting 6 issues each year. So far, that's four magazines: three with 12 issues and one with 6.

Wait, hold on. The problem says "she has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year." Hmm, does that mean she has one, and then another that sends 4 times that? Let me read it again.

"Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine." So, her last magazine sends 4 times the 6 issues. So, is the last magazine the one that sends 24 issues a year? Because 4 times 6 is 24. So, that's another magazine. So, if the first three are 12 issues each, the fourth is 6 issues, and the last one is 24 issues. So, now she's got five magazines in total.

Wait, hold on, let me parse the sentence again: "Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine."

So maybe it's a bit more specific. Let's see: "Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year." So, she's ordered three, each with 12 issues. Then, she has one magazine that sends 6 issues. Then, her last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine, which would be 4*6=24. So, that's another magazine, bringing the total to five.

Wait, no, does she have a total of three magazines? Or is she having 3 that send 12, 1 that sends 6, and the last one sends 24? So, 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 magazines.

Hmm, the question is, "How many magazines does she get every year?" So, is it the total number of magazines, regardless of the number of issues? Or is it the total number of issues?

Wait, the question says, "How many magazines does she get every year?" So, yeah, it's asking for the number of magazines, not the number of issues.

So, she has five magazines: three that send 12 issues, one that sends 6, and one that sends 24. So, regardless of the number of issues, she gets five magazines every year.

Wait, but let's make sure. Let me try to parse the original sentence again:

"Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine."

So, first, she orders 3 magazines, each sending 12 issues a year. Then, she has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. Then, her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine, which is 24 issues.

So, in total, that's 3 (each 12) + 1 (6) + 1 (24) = 5 magazines.

Therefore, she gets 5 magazines every year.

Wait, but let me think again: does "Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine" mean that her last magazine sends her 4 times as many issues as the 6-issue magazine? So, the 6-issue magazine sends 6 issues, so 4 times that is 24. So, that's one more magazine, making five in total.

Alternatively, is there a way to interpret this differently? Maybe "she has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year" and "Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine." So, maybe it's just 3 magazines of 12, and one last magazine which sends 4 times 6, which is 24. So, total 4 magazines? Wait, that would be 3 + 1, but with that last one being 24.

Wait, hold on, let's parse it step by step.

1. She orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year. So, 3 magazines, 12 issues each.

2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, that's a fourth magazine.

3. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine. So, 4*6=24. So, that's a fifth magazine.

Therefore, in total, 3 + 1 +1=5 magazines.

Alternatively, if the phrasing is different, maybe she has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues, and her last magazine sends 4 times that. So, that would be 1 (6 issues) + 1 (24 issues). So, 2 magazines.

But in this case, she also orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues each. So, the total is 3 + 2 =5.

Wait, but maybe the 'last magazine' is separate from the 3 she ordered? Or is it part of the 3?

Wait, let me read the original sentence again:

"Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine."

So, the first part is about her ordering: 3 magazines, 12 issues each.

Then, she has 1 magazine that sends 6. So, that's another one.

Then, her last magazine sends her 4 times the 6-issue magazine. So, that is 24.

So, total is 3 + 1 +1=5.

Alternatively, if "her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine," meaning that the 6 issue magazine is part of the three she ordered? But that might not make sense.

Wait, maybe that's the key. Is the "6 issue magazine" one of the three she ordered? Or is it an additional one?

The first sentence says, "Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year." So, that implies she ordered three, each with 12.

Then, she has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, that's a fourth.

Then, her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. So, that's 24. So, another one.

Therefore, 3+1+1=5.

Alternatively, perhaps the "last magazine" is part of the 3 she ordered? So, maybe the 3 she ordered include a 6-issue and a 24-issue, but that seems inconsistent.

Wait, the first sentence says she orders 3 magazines that send 12 each. So, that's three, each 12. Then, she has another that sends 6, and another that sends 24. So, that seems separate.

Therefore, total number of magazines is 5.

But let me just think of another approach.

Alternatively, maybe "She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year." So, that's one.

And her last magazine sends 4 times that, so 24. So, another.

So, 2 magazines.

But then, she also orders 3 that send 12 each. So, does that mean she gets 3+1+1=5.

Wait, unless "the last magazine" is part of the three she ordered.

Wait, the sentence is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse it:

"Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine."

So, the first part: orders 3 magazines (12 each). Then, she has 1 (6). Then, her last magazine sends her 4 times the 6-issue one.

So, does the last magazine refer to one of the 12-issue ones? If so, then 4 times 6 is 24, so that would be a 24-issue magazine.

But the first part says she ordered 3 that send 12 each. So, unless one of them is 24, but that's not what she ordered. She ordered 3 that send 12 each. So, that would be 3x12.

Then, she has another one that sends 6, and another one that sends 24. So, total 5.

Therefore, the answer is 5.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe the "last magazine" is part of the 3 she ordered? So, she ordered 3, one of which sends 6 and the other two send 12 each? But that doesn't make sense because she ordered 3 that send 12 each.

Wait, no, that would mean that two of the three she ordered send 12, and one sends 6. But the first sentence says she orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year. So, all three send 12.

Then, she has 1 magazine that sends 6. Then, her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine, which is 24.

So, in total, 3 +1 +1=5.

Alternatively, perhaps the "last magazine" is the one that sends 4 times the 6-issue, meaning that she has 1 magazine that sends 6, and the last one sends 24. So, that's 2, plus the 3 that send 12 each, so total 5.

Wait, unless "the last magazine" is the 3 she ordered? So, maybe she ordered 3 magazines that send 12 each, but one of them is actually her last magazine, which sends 4 times the 6-issue one. But that seems conflicting.

Wait, if she has a magazine that sends 6, and her last magazine sends 4 times that, 24, then that's another. So, it's two separate magazines.

Therefore, 3 +1 +1=5.

I think that makes sense.

Therefore, the total number of magazines she gets every year is 5.

**Final Answer**
Susan gets \boxed{5} magazines every year.
</think>

Susan orders 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year. She also has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine, which is 24 issues. 

To determine the total number of magazines she gets every year, we add the magazines as follows:

1. 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year.
2. 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.
3. 1 magazine that sends 24 issues a year (4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine).

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \]

Thus, Susan gets \boxed{5} magazines every year.
