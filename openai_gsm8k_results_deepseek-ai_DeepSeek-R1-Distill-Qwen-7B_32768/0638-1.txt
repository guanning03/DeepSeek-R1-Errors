Question:
Mrs. Tatiana owns a grocery store that sells different fruits and vegetables, which includes carrots. The price of carrots in the grocery store increases by 5% of the original price every year. What would be the price of carrots after three years if it was $120 initially? (Round to the nearest integer)

Correct Answer:
In the first year, the price of carrots increases by 5/100*120 = $<<5/100*120=6>>6
After 3 years, the price of carrots will increase by $6*3 = $<<6*3=18>>18
The total price of carrots after three years will be 120+18 = $<<120+18=138>>138

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so Mrs. Tatiana has a grocery store where carrots are sold, and their price increases by 5% each year. I need to figure out what the price of carrots will be after three years if it starts at $120. Hmm, okay.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The price increases by 5% every year. That means each year, the price is 5% higher than it was the previous year. So, it's not like a flat increase; instead, it's compounding, right? Like, each year's increase is based on the new, higher price from the previous year. That makes it a bit more involved than just adding 5% once.

So, starting with $120, after one year, it's going to be 120 plus 5% of 120. Let me write that down. Maybe I can use a formula for compound interest because it's similarâ€”except instead of interest, it's the price increasing.

The formula for compound interest is:

A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)

But in this case, since the price increases once a year, n would be 1. So, the formula simplifies to:

A = P (1 + r)^t

Where:
- A is the amount after t years,
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount),
- r is the annual increase rate (as a decimal),
- t is the time in years.

Plugging in the numbers we have:
- P = $120,
- r = 5% = 0.05,
- t = 3 years.

So, A = 120 * (1 + 0.05)^3.

Calculating that exponent first: (1 + 0.05) is 1.05. Then, raising 1.05 to the power of 3.

Let me compute 1.05 cubed. Hmm, 1.05 times 1.05 is... 1.1025. Then, 1.1025 multiplied by 1.05. Let me do that step by step.

1.1025 * 1.05. Let's break it down:

First, 1 * 1.05 is 1.05.

Then, 0.1025 * 1.05. Hmm, 0.1 * 1.05 is 0.105, and 0.0025 * 1.05 is 0.002625. Adding those together: 0.105 + 0.002625 = 0.107625.

So, adding that to the 1.05 gives us 1.05 + 0.107625 = 1.157625.

Therefore, 1.05^3 is approximately 1.157625.

Now, multiply that by the initial price of $120:

A = 120 * 1.157625.

Let me compute that. 120 * 1 is 120, 120 * 0.15 is 18, and 120 * 0.007625 is... Hmm, 120 * 0.007 is 0.84, and 120 * 0.000625 is 0.075. So, adding those together: 0.84 + 0.075 = 0.915.

Wait, hold on, maybe I should do this more accurately. Let me try another approach.

120 * 1.157625. Let's break 1.157625 into 1 + 0.15 + 0.007625.

So, 120 * 1 = 120.

120 * 0.15 = 18.

120 * 0.007625. Hmm, 0.007625 is a small number, so 120 * 0.007 = 0.84, and 120 * 0.000625 is 0.075. So, adding those: 0.84 + 0.075 = 0.915.

Therefore, adding all three parts: 120 + 18 + 0.915 = 138.915.

So, approximately $138.915 after three years.

But wait, let me verify that. Maybe I made a calculation error somewhere.

Alternatively, I can compute each year step by step to ensure accuracy.

Starting with $120 in year 0.

After year 1: 120 + 5% of 120.

5% of 120 is 6, so 120 + 6 = 126.

After year 2: 126 + 5% of 126.

5% of 126 is 6.3, so 126 + 6.3 = 132.3.

After year 3: 132.3 + 5% of 132.3.

5% of 132.3 is... Let me calculate that. 10% of 132.3 is 13.23, so 5% is half of that, which is 6.615.

So, 132.3 + 6.615 = 138.915.

Yes, so after three years, the price is $138.915.

Rounding that to the nearest integer. So, 138.915 is approximately 139 when rounded to the nearest whole number.

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me do the exponentiation again.

1.05^3: 1.05 * 1.05 is 1.1025, as before. Then, 1.1025 * 1.05.

Let me compute 1.1025 * 1.05:

1.1025 * 1 is 1.1025.

1.1025 * 0.05 is 0.055125.

Adding those together: 1.1025 + 0.055125 = 1.157625. So, that's correct.

Then, 120 * 1.157625 = ?

Let me do 120 * 1.157625.

First, 100 * 1.157625 = 115.7625.

Then, 20 * 1.157625 = 23.1525.

Adding those together: 115.7625 + 23.1525 = 138.915.

So, that's consistent. So, yeah, $138.915, which is approximately $139.

Alternatively, if I use logarithms or another method, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, use the formula step by step each year, which I did earlier, and got the same result.

So, either way, it seems that the price after three years is approximately $138.915, which rounds to $139.

Therefore, I think the final answer is $139.

**Final Answer**
The price of carrots after three years would be \boxed{139} dollars.
</think>

Mrs. Tatiana's grocery store sells carrots, whose price increases by 5% each year. To find the price after three years starting from $120, we use the compound interest formula:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \]

where:
- \( P = 120 \) dollars (initial price),
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% annual increase),
- \( t = 3 \) years.

First, we calculate the factor by which the price increases:

\[ (1 + 0.05)^3 = 1.05^3 \]

Breaking it down:

\[ 1.05 \times 1.05 = 1.1025 \]
\[ 1.1025 \times 1.05 = 1.157625 \]

Now, we multiply this factor by the initial price:

\[ A = 120 \times 1.157625 \]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[ 120 \times 1 = 120 \]
\[ 120 \times 0.15 = 18 \]
\[ 120 \times 0.007625 = 0.915 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 120 + 18 + 0.915 = 138.915 \]

Rounding 138.915 to the nearest integer gives us 139.

Thus, the price of carrots after three years is \(\boxed{139}\) dollars.
