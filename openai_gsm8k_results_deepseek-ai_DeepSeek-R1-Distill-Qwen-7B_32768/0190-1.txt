Question:
Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the first race, he lost $5. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?

Correct Answer:
On the second race he won $11 because 1+ 5 x 2 = <<1+5*2=11>>11
On the third race he lost $15 because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15
He lost a total of $20 on the first and third races because 15 + 5 = <<15+5=20>>20

He lost $9 that day because 11 - 20 = <<11-20=-9>>-9
He lost an average of $3 per race because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3
#### 3

Gold:
3

Wrong Prediction:
3.50

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so Johnny's dad went to watch some horse racing, and he ended up betting some money. I need to figure out how much he lost on average that day. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.

First, the problem says that on the first race, he lost $5. Okay, so that seems straightforward. Let me write that down.

First race loss: $5.

Now, moving on to the second race. It says he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Hmm, let me parse this. Previously lost, so that refers back to the first race, which is $5. So twice that amount would be 2 times $5, which is $10. Then, he won $1 more than that. So, $10 plus $1 is $11. So, he won $11 on the second race.

Let me write that down.

Second race win: 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

Okay, so he went from losing $5 to winning $11. Now, onto the third race. It says he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he won $11 on the second race, and 1.5 times that would be 1.5 multiplied by $11.

Let me calculate that. 1.5 * 11. Hmm, 1 times 11 is 11, and 0.5 times 11 is 5.5, so adding those together, 11 + 5.5 is $16.50. So, he lost $16.50 on the third race.

Third race loss: 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Alright, so now I have three races: he lost $5, won $11, and lost $16.50. The question is asking for his average loss for the day. Hmm, so I think we need to consider his net loss or his total loss?

Wait, the problem says "how much did he lose on average that day." So, I think it's referring to the total amount he lost, averaged over the races where he lost. Or maybe over all races, including the win.

Wait, let me think. When it says "how much did he lose on average that day," it's a bit ambiguous. But in racing, sometimes people talk about overall loss, considering both wins and losses.

But in this case, he had two losses and one win. So, maybe we should calculate his total profit or loss and then find the average per race.

Alternatively, maybe just compute the average of his losses, regardless of the wins.

Hmm, the problem says "how much did he lose on average that day." So, probably considering all his losses, whether it was in different races.

Wait, let me read again: "On the first race, he lost $5. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race."

So, he had three races: first, he lost $5; second, he won $11; third, he lost $16.50. So, he had two losses and one win. So, maybe he's asking for the average loss considering all his losses, or the average loss considering all races.

But "on average that day," so maybe it's the average over all races, including the win as a negative value? Hmm.

Wait, let's see. If I were to compute the total net loss or gain, it would be the sum of all his gains and losses. So, first race: -$5, second race: +$11, third race: -$16.50. So, total net is (-5) + 11 + (-16.50). Let me compute that.

First, (-5) + 11 is 6. Then, 6 + (-16.50) is -10.50. So, overall, he had a net loss of $10.50 for the day.

Now, if the question is asking for the average loss per race, considering all three races, it would be the total loss divided by the number of races. But he only lost money in two races, so is the average loss only over the races he lost, or over all races?

Hmm, the phrasing is "how much did he lose on average that day," which is a bit ambiguous. But in racing, when someone talks about average loss, they might be referring to the overall average, including both wins and losses, with wins considered as negative losses.

So, in that case, the total net loss is -$10.50 over three races, so average loss per race would be -$10.50 divided by 3, which is -$3.50. But since the question asks "how much did he lose on average," we can probably take the absolute value, so $3.50.

But wait, let me think again. If I compute average loss as total loss divided by number of races, but he had two losses and one win. So, if you count each race separately, he had two losses and one gain. So, if we consider the average loss, but in the races he won, he didn't lose. Hmm, so perhaps it's better to compute the average of his losses, not considering the race where he won. Because in that race, he didn't lose any money.

So, if we consider only the races where he lost, which are two races: first race, $5 loss; third race, $16.50 loss. So, total loss is $5 + $16.50 = $21.50. Then, average loss per race where he lost would be total loss divided by number of losses, which is 2.

So, $21.50 divided by 2 is $10.75.

Alternatively, if we consider the average loss per race over all three races, treating wins as negative losses, then as I computed before, total net loss is -$10.50, so average is -$3.50 per race.

But, typically, when someone asks for average loss, it might refer to the average of the losses, not considering the wins. So, that would be $10.75.

Wait, let's see what the problem says: "how much did he lose on average that day." It doesn't specify over how many races or anything. So, maybe it's safer to compute the average of all his losses, regardless of how many races. So, in that case, total loss is $5 + $16.50 = $21.50, over two races, so average is $10.75.

Alternatively, if we include the win as a negative loss, so total loss is $5 + (-11) + (-16.50). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, losses are positive numbers, and gains are negative numbers. So, the total loss is $21.50, and the total gain is $11. So, net loss is $10.50.

But perhaps the average loss is referring to just the monetary amount lost, not considering the number of races. So, he lost a total of $21.50, across two races, so average loss per lost race is $10.75.

But let me check the problem again: "On the first race, he lost $5. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?"

Hmm, so the way it's phrased, "how much did he lose on average that day," it might mean the average of his losses, not considering the wins. So, over the three races, he only lost money in two races, so the average loss would be over those two races.

Alternatively, if we consider the total amount he lost, $21.50, over the total number of races, which is three, then it's $21.50 / 3 ≈ $7.17.

Wait, now I'm confused. So, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me try to parse it again.

First, he lost $5 in the first race. Then, on the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, 'previous loss' is $5, so twice that is $10, plus $1 is $11, so he won $11. Then, on the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, which is 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

So, the total amount he lost is $5 + $16.50 = $21.50. The total amount he won is $11.

So, if we are talking about his average loss for the day, considering all his losses, regardless of the number of races, it's $21.50 total loss, but since there are only two races where he lost money, the average loss per race would be $21.50 / 2 = $10.75.

Alternatively, if we consider the average loss over all three races, including the win as a negative value, it's total net loss of $10.50 over three races, so average is $3.50 per race.

But the problem says "how much did he lose on average that day." It doesn't specify whether it's per race or overall. Hmm.

But in common language, when someone asks for average loss, they usually refer to the average amount lost per occurrence of loss, not considering the wins. So, for example, if you lost two times and won once, the average loss per lost race would be the total loss divided by number of losses.

So, in this case, he lost a total of $21.50 over two races, so average loss per race would be $10.75.

Alternatively, if they just want the average of all the losses, not per race, it's the same as $10.75 per lost race.

Wait, but the problem is asking for how much he lost on average that day. So, if he had two losses, total $21.50, so average per loss is $10.75.

But the problem is in the wording, "on average that day," which could be interpreted as average of all his losses, or average per race. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the average considering all races, treating losses as negative and wins as positive, so net loss is $10.50 over three races, so average is $3.50 per race.

But in that case, the answer would be $3.50.

But now, I'm not sure. Let me think about similar problems.

In betting contexts, when someone asks about average loss, sometimes they refer to the average absolute loss, not considering the direction. But in this case, the question is about how much he lost on average, so it's more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to compute the average of the amounts he lost in each race, so two races, $5 and $16.50, so average is ($5 + $16.50)/2 = $21.50 / 2 = $10.75.

But let me check my calculations again.

First race: lost $5.

Second race: won $11.

Third race: lost 1.5 * 11 = $16.50.

So, total loss is $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.

Total wins: $11.

So, net loss: $21.50 - $11 = $10.50.

So, over three races, net loss is $10.50.

If we are talking about average loss per race, considering all three races, it's $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

But again, the problem is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, if we compute the average loss over the races where he lost, it's $21.50 / 2 = $10.75.

But perhaps, in the problem's context, since it's asking for "on average that day," without specifying, it might be referring to the average loss considering all his losses and wins, so treating losses as negative and wins as positive, then the average per race would be total net loss divided by number of races.

But let's consider, if we go with that, the total amount he lost was $21.50, and he won $11, so net loss is $10.50 over three races, so average per race is $3.50.

But actually, in terms of how much he lost each day, the average would be the total loss divided by the number of races, so $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

But wait, the problem says "how much did he lose on average that day." So, maybe it's more accurate to say that he lost an average of $3.50 per race, considering all three races.

Alternatively, if we think about it in terms of total loss, $10.50, over the day, so average per day is $10.50. But that seems less.

Wait, no, if you have three races, so per race, it's $3.50.

But the problem isn't specifying per race, just "on average that day."

Hmm, perhaps the question is expecting the average of the losses, regardless of the number of races.

So, he lost $5 and $16.50, so average is $10.75.

But to make sure, perhaps we can calculate both ways and see which one makes more sense.

First, average per race over all three races: total net loss is $10.50, so $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

Alternatively, average loss per race where he lost: $21.50 / 2 = $10.75.

But the problem says "on average that day," so I think the first interpretation is more appropriate, considering all races. So, the average loss per race is $3.50.

But I'm still a bit confused because the term "average loss" can be ambiguous.

Wait, let me think about similar problems. If I have a person who gains and loses money over several days, when asked for average daily loss, it usually refers to the average absolute loss per day, not considering the direction. So, for example, if someone has a net loss of $10 over 3 days, their average daily loss is $3.33.

Similarly, in this case, if he had a net loss of $10.50 over three races, his average loss per race is $3.50.

Alternatively, if the question is about average loss per race where he lost, it's $10.75.

But since the problem doesn't specify, I think the more precise answer is to compute the average of his losses per race, regardless of the wins.

But wait, in the problem, the question is "how much did he lose on average that day." If it's asking for the amount lost each day on average, considering all his gains and losses, then it's the total loss divided by the number of races. So, $10.50 divided by 3 is $3.50.

But maybe it's more precise to say that, but I need to be careful.

Wait, another way to think about it is, if you have money going in and out, the average loss per race is the total loss divided by the number of races. So, if he had total loss of $21.50 but also a gain of $11, so net loss is $10.50 over three races, so average loss per race is $3.50.

Alternatively, if you think of it as just the losses, without considering the wins, it's $10.75 per lost race.

But the problem says "he lost $5, won $11, lost $16.50." So, he only lost money in two races, so average loss per lost race is $10.75.

Alternatively, since he had three races, two losses and one win, if the question is about average loss per race, it's $10.50 over three races.

So, in that case, $3.50.

But given that the problem is phrased as "on average that day," I think the answer should be $3.50, as it's the average per race over the entire day, considering all races.

But wait, the problem is in the context of horse racing, so he might have multiple races, but each race is a separate event.

But let me see the exact wording: "how much did he lose on average that day." So, if he had two losses and one win, the average loss per race would be total loss divided by number of races.

But, in reality, in horse racing, people usually talk about their overall profit or loss for the day, not per race unless specified.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the average of the losses, not considering the wins.

Wait, let's think about how the problem is constructed.

It says: "On the first race, he lost $5. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race."

So, it's telling us the sequence of events: first he lost $5, then he won something based on the previous loss, then he lost something based on the second race's winnings.

So, the problem gives us all the necessary information to compute each individual result.

So, from that, he lost $5, won $11, lost $16.50.

So, his total loss is $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.

Total winnings: $11.

So, net loss: $10.50 over three races.

So, on average, his loss per race is $10.50 divided by 3, which is $3.50.

But the problem says "how much did he lose on average that day." So, if it's per race, it's $3.50.

Alternatively, if we think of the average of his losses, regardless of the wins, it's $21.50 divided by 2, which is $10.75.

But since the problem mentions all three races and asks for the average loss that day, it's more consistent to consider all races. So, if the total loss over three races is $21.50, but he also won $11, so the net loss is $10.50, so average per race is $3.50.

But wait, is that correct? Because losses are $21.50, but wins are $11, so net loss is $10.50, so if you average that over three races, it's $3.50 per race.

But if you consider just the losses, it's $21.50 over two races, so $10.75 per lost race.

So, perhaps, the problem is expecting $10.75 as the average loss per race where he lost.

But the question is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, let me think of the problem as presented: it's a single day with three races, and we have specific amounts for each race.

So, the total loss is $21.50, total winnings is $11, so net loss is $10.50 over three races.

Therefore, the average per race is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50. So, he lost an average of $3.50 per race that day.

Alternatively, if we only consider the races where he lost money, he lost $21.50 over two races, so that's $10.75 per lost race.

But since the problem mentions all three races, maybe it's expecting the average per race, considering all races, so $3.50.

But perhaps, in common usage, when someone asks "how much did he lose on average that day," they mean the average of all his losses, not per race.

Wait, but he only lost money in two races, so it's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the average of the losses, regardless of the wins.

So, in that case, average loss per lost race is $10.75.

But since the problem is presented in a way that it's giving the sequence of events, maybe it's expecting the average of all his losses, which would be $10.75.

Alternatively, if we think about the entire day, he had a net loss of $10.50 over three races, so the average per race is $3.50.

But I need to figure out which interpretation is correct.

Wait, in the problem, they specify the first race, second race, third race, so he had three races in total.

So, if they're asking for the average loss that day, it's more precise to compute the average of all his losses, considering all races. So, that would be the total loss divided by the number of races.

So, total loss is $21.50, number of races is 3, so average loss is $21.50 / 3 ≈ $7.17.

Wait, no, hold on, that would be the average of his losses and wins. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

If he had two losses and one win, his total loss is $21.50, and total profit is $11.

Therefore, his net loss is $10.50 over three races.

So, if we are talking about the average net loss per race, it's $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

But if we are talking about the average of his losses, regardless of the profit, it's $21.50 / 3 ≈ $7.17.

Wait, but that would be adding the profit as a loss, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, because in reality, the profit is positive, and loss is negative.

So, perhaps, to calculate the average loss per race, we can take the total loss and divide by the number of races where he lost.

So, total loss is $21.50, number of races lost is 2, so average loss per race is $10.75.

Alternatively, if we consider the average over all races, including the win, the total loss is $21.50, but he also made a profit of $11, so net loss is $10.50 over three races, average is $3.50 per race.

But in that case, we would be treating the win as a negative loss.

But in reality, a win is a positive amount, so when computing average loss, we should only consider the losses.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to compute the average of the losses, not considering the wins.

So, the two losses are $5 and $16.50, so total loss is $21.50, average is $10.75.

Alternatively, the average of all amounts, considering wins as losses, would be total loss divided by number of races, which is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

But in reality, a win is a gain, not a loss, so when talking about loss, we should only consider the amounts he lost.

So, in that case, the average loss per race where he lost is $10.75.

But the problem is asking for "how much did he lose on average that day," without specifying. So, perhaps, it's ambiguous.

But in most cases, when people talk about average loss, they usually refer to the average of the losses, not considering the wins, just like in sports, if a team has a certain number of wins and losses, the average loss is the average of the losses.

Therefore, I think in this context, the answer is $10.75.

But to be thorough, let me check the two interpretations:

1. Average loss per race: total loss divided by number of races where he lost.

Total loss: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.

Number of losses: 2.

So, average loss per lost race: $21.50 / 2 = $10.75.

2. Average loss per race over all races: total loss divided by total number of races.

Total loss: $21.50.

Total races: 3.

So, average loss per race: $21.50 / 3 ≈ $7.17.

But in reality, the second interpretation is incorrect because he didn't lose money in all races. So, the average per race is not simply total loss divided by number of races, because in one race he made a profit.

Wait, but in terms of profit and loss, perhaps, we can model it as net loss, so total loss is $21.50, total profit is $11, so net loss is $10.50, over three races, so average loss per race is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

But, again, that's considering the profit as a negative loss.

Alternatively, if we are to compute the average of all his losses, regardless of the wins, it's $10.75 per lost race.

So, the problem is a bit ambiguous, but in the absence of specific instructions, I think the more precise answer is $10.75 because that's the average of his losses in the races where he lost.

Alternatively, if we are to compute the average of his net loss per race, treating wins as negative losses, then it's $3.50.

But since he only lost money in two races, the average of his losses in those races is more relevant.

Wait, but the question is "how much did he lose on average that day." So, the average is over the day, which includes all races.

So, in that case, we can model it as the total loss over three races, which is $21.50, and then average loss per race is $21.50 / 3 ≈ $7.17.

Wait, but that includes the profit as a loss, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to calculate the total amount he is out of pocket, which is the total loss minus the total winnings.

So, total loss: $21.50.

Total winnings: $11.

Net loss: $21.50 - $11 = $10.50.

So, over three races, he had a net loss of $10.50, so average loss per race is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

But in reality, the net loss is the total amount he lost minus the amount he won, so the average net loss per race is $3.50.

Alternatively, if we compute the average of his losses, regardless of the wins, it's $21.50 / 2 = $10.75, as he only lost in two races.

So, to sum it up, depending on the interpretation:

- If considering all races, net loss is $10.50 over three races, so average per race is $3.50.

- If considering only the races where he lost, total loss is $21.50 over two races, so average per lost race is $10.75.

But the problem is asking for "how much did he lose on average that day," without specifying. So, given that he had three races, two losses, and one win, the average loss per race is $3.50.

But another perspective is that he lost money each day, so if we are talking about the average amount he lost each day, considering the races, it's $3.50.

Alternatively, if we are talking about the average of his losses, not considering the profit, it's $10.75.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the average per race, regardless of profit or loss.

So, the total amount he is out of pocket is $21.50, over three races, so average per race is $7.17.

But that would be the average of his losses and winnings, but that's not quite correct because he's winning in one race.

Wait, let me think again.

Each race, he either loses or wins. So, for each race, if he loses, it's -$5, if he wins, it's +$11, and if he loses again, it's -$16.50.

So, the total over three races is -$5 + $11 - $16.50 = -$10.50.

So, his net loss is $10.50.

Therefore, the average loss per race is total loss divided by number of races, which is -$10.50 / 3 = -$3.50.

But since we are talking about how much he lost, it's $3.50 per race on average.

Alternatively, if we take the absolute value, it's $3.50.

So, perhaps, in that sense, the average loss per race is $3.50.

But another way, the average of his losses is the total losses divided by the number of races, which is $21.50 / 3 ≈ $7.17, but that's not quite correct because he didn't lose money in all races.

Wait, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the average of his losses, not considering the profit.

So, total loss is $21.50, number of losses is 2, so average loss per lost race is $10.75.

Hmm.

Since the problem is given in a narrative form, it's likely that they expect the average per race, considering all races, so total loss is $21.50 over three races, so average loss per race is $3.50.

Alternatively, if we think of average loss per lost race, it's $10.75.

But given the problem is asking "how much did he lose on average that day," without specifying, it's safer to compute the average over all races, which is $3.50.

Therefore, I think the answer is $3.50.

But just to make sure, let me recompute:

First race: lost $5.

Second race: won $11.

Third race: lost 1.5 * 11 = $16.50.

Total loss: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.

Total winnings: $11.

Net loss: $10.50 over three races.

Average loss per race: $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

Yes, that's consistent.

So, the answer is $3.50.

**Final Answer**
He lost an average of \boxed{3.50} dollars that day.
</think>

Johnny's dad went to watch horse racing and his dad bet money. We need to determine how much he lost on average that day.

1. **First race**: Johnny lost $5.
2. **Second race**: He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Twice the amount he lost is \(2 \times 5 = 10\). Therefore, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. **Third race**: He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. He won $11 in the second race, so he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.50\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total loss and the average loss per race:
- **Total loss**: \(5 + 16.50 = 21.50\) dollars.
- **Total races**: 3.
- **Net loss**: The total loss is $21.50, and the total winnings are $11. The net loss is \(21.50 - 11 = 10.50\) dollars.
- **Average loss per race**: The net loss of $10.50 over 3 races gives an average loss per race of \(\frac{10.50}{3} = 3.50\) dollars.

Thus, the average loss per race is \(\boxed{3.50}\) dollars.
