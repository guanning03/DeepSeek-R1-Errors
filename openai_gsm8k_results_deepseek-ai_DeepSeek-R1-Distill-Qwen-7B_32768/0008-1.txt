Question:
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. Calculate the total cost of buying each cup.

Correct Answer:
Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6
Half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.
If the twenty dozen cups cost $34800, each cup costs $34800/240=$<<34800/240=145>>145

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here that says: "Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. Calculate the total cost of buying each cup." Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First off, the problem is talking about cups and plates. It mentions the cost of cups and relates it to the cost of plates. I need to find the total cost of buying each cup, which I think means I need to find the cost per cup. 

Alright, let's parse the information given. It says, "Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each." Hmm, okay. Let me write that out in parts to make it clearer.

So, starting with the cups: 20 dozen cups. I know that one dozen is 12, so 20 dozen would be 20 times 12. Let me calculate that. 20 x 12 is 240. So, 20 dozen cups is 240 cups. Got that.

Now, the cost of these 240 cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Each plate is sold at $6000, and it's half a dozen plates. So, half a dozen is 6/2, which is 3. So, half a dozen plates mean 3 plates. 

Wait, hold on. The wording says, "half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each." Hmm, so does that mean each plate is $6000? That seems really expensive. Is that right? Because if each plate is $6000, then half a dozen plates would be 3 plates, each at $6000, so 3 x 6000 = $18,000. Is that correct? Let me make sure.

Yes, I think so. If half a dozen plates are sold at $6000 each, then each plate is $6000. So, half a dozen is 3 plates, so total cost is 3 x 6000 = $18,000.

So, the total cost of the plates is $18,000. Now, the cost of the cups is $1200 less than that. So, cups cost $18,000 - $1200. Let me do that subtraction: 18,000 minus 1,200 is 16,800. So, the total cost for the cups is $16,800.

But wait, the problem is asking for the total cost of buying each cup. So, each cup would be the total cost divided by the number of cups. We have 240 cups, right? So, 16,800 divided by 240. Hmm, okay, let me compute that.

First, let's see how many times 240 goes into 16,800. Maybe I can simplify this division. Let's divide both numerator and denominator by 10: 1680 divided by 24. Hmm, 24 times 70 is 1680, because 24 x 70 = 1680. So, 16,800 divided by 240 is also 70. So, each cup costs $70.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, the plates: half a dozen is 3 plates at $6000 each, so 3 x 6000 is indeed $18,000. Then, the cups cost $1200 less, so 18,000 - 1,200 is $16,800. Then, 20 dozen cups is 240 cups. 16,800 divided by 240, let's compute that.

Alternatively, 16,800 divided by 240: I can divide both numerator and denominator by 10, getting 1,680 divided by 24. 24 goes into 1,680 how many times? 24 x 70 is 1,680. So, yes, that's 70. So, each cup is $70. Okay, that seems consistent.

Just to make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. It says, "Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each." So, is each plate $6000? That seems like a lot, but if that's what the problem says, then it's correct.

Alternatively, sometimes problems can be tricky with the wording. Perhaps "half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each" could mean that the total for half a dozen is $6000, not each. Hmm, that would be a different interpretation.

Wait, let's see. The phrasing is important. If it's "half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each," that would mean each plate is sold for $6000. If it were "half a dozen plates sold at $6000 total," then that would be different. So, in this case, "sold at $6000 each" is the key. So, each plate is $6000.

Therefore, half a dozen plates would be 3 plates, each at $6000, totaling $18,000. So, the cups are $1200 less, which is $16,800 for 240 cups, so each cup is $70. 

I think that makes sense. Let me just rephrase the problem in my own words to ensure I understand it: The cost of 20 dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates, where each plate is $6000. So, half a dozen plates is 3 plates, each at $6000, so total plates cost is $18,000. Then, cups are $1200 less than that, so $16,800. Since there are 240 cups, each cup is $70.

Yeah, that seems to check out. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the total cost per cup is $70.

**Final Answer**
The total cost of buying each cup is \boxed{70} dollars.
</think>

First, we determine the number of cups. Twenty dozen cups is calculated as:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. Half a dozen is 3 plates, so the total cost is:
\[ 3 \times 6000 = 18000 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the cups is $1200 less than the total cost of the plates:
\[ 18000 - 1200 = 16800 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the cost per cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:
\[ \frac{16800}{240} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]
