Question:
Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?

Correct Answer:
Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.
The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.
Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Cole wants to buy two types of jeans: tattered and jogger. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans are $6 less than the tattered ones. He ended up saving a total of $6 by buying both, and he saved 1/3 of that total from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered ones. The question is asking how much more the jogger jeans originally cost compared to the tattered ones. Wait, actually, hold on. The problem says the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered ones. So, the difference in original price is $6. But let me read the question again to make sure.

"how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?"

Wait, hold on, no. It says the jogger jeans cost $6 less. So, the original price difference is $6, right? So, actually, the answer is $6. But maybe that's not the case because he saved money. Maybe the question is a bit more complicated. Hmm.

Wait, let me read the problem again carefully.

"Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans."

So, original prices: tattered = $28, jogger = $28 - $6 = $22.

" He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?"

Wait, hold on. Hold on. Wait, the problem says he saved a total of $6. So, he saved $6 from both, and he saved 1/3 of that total from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered ones. So, the total savings is $6, with 1/3 and 2/3.

Wait, but the question is asking how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans? But the problem says the jogger jeans cost $6 less. So, that would mean the original difference is $6.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again.

"how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?"

Wait, so the original price of the jogger jeans is $6 less than the tattered ones, so the original difference is -6, meaning jogger is $6 less. But the question is "how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?" So perhaps, the answer is negative, but since it's asking "how much more," maybe it's $6 less, so the answer is -$6. But that seems odd.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Because the problem is talking about savings, so maybe the question is a bit more about the sale prices or something else.

Wait, let's parse the problem again:

1. Tattered jeans cost $28.

2. Jogger jeans cost $6 less than tattered, so $22.

3. He bought both, so total original cost would be $28 + $22 = $50.

4. He saved a total of $6. So, he didn't spend all the money, he saved $6? Or he saved $6 overall?

Wait, if he bought them on sale, he saved $6 in total. So, the total amount he saved is $6.

5. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from jogger jeans and the rest from tattered jeans. So, from jogger, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2, and from tattered, he saved 2/3 * $6 = $4.

But wait, he saved a total of $6, which is the amount he didn't spend, right? So, he saved $6 in total.

But then, the question is asking how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans? But the original price of jogger is $22, tattered is $28, so jogger is $6 less. So, the original difference is $6.

Wait, so maybe the answer is $6. But the problem is, it's a bit confusing because the saving is about the amount he saved when purchasing on sale. So, maybe the original prices are different?

Wait, hold on. Let me think.

Wait, the problem states that he couldn't decide between tattered and jogger, but both were on sale. He bought both. So, the tattered jeans were on sale for $28, and the jogger jeans were on sale for $6 less than tattered, so $22. So, the original prices of the tattered and jogger are $28 and $22, respectively.

But he saved a total of $6. So, perhaps he saved some money on each pair.

Wait, but the problem says he saved a total of $6 by buying both. So, maybe the total amount he saved is $6. Then, he saved 1/3 from jogger and 2/3 from tattered. So, 1/3 of 6 is $2 saved on jogger, and 2/3 is $4 saved on tattered.

So, if he saved $2 on jogger, that means the original price of jogger was higher by $2, so $22 + $2 = $24?

Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense because if jogger is on sale for $22, and he saved $2, that would make the original price $24.

Similarly, he saved $4 on tattered, so original price was $28 + $4 = $32.

But that contradicts the fact that jogger was originally $6 less than tattered.

Wait, so perhaps the original price of the tattered jeans was $28, and the original price of the jogger jeans was $22. But when he bought them on sale, he saved some money on each, so the sale prices became $28 - $4 = $24 and $22 + $2 = $24? Wait, but that would mean both are now $24, which is not the case.

Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let's define variables.

Let me define:

Let T = original price of tattered jeans = $28.

Let J = original price of jogger jeans = T - 6 = $22.

Let S_total = total savings = $6.

He saved 1/3 of S_total from jogger, so S_j = (1/3)*6 = $2.

And he saved 2/3 of S_total from tattered, so S_t = (2/3)*6 = $4.

So, the sale price of tattered jeans is T - S_t = 28 - 4 = $24.

The sale price of jogger jeans is J - S_j = 22 - 2 = $20.

So, the sale prices are $24 for tattered and $20 for jogger.

Therefore, the original prices were $28 and $22, and the sale prices are $24 and $20.

Therefore, the difference in the original prices is still $6. So, jogger is still $6 less than tattered.

Wait, but the question is, he saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 from jogger and 2/3 from tattered.

So, the difference in the original prices remains the same, which is $6. So, the answer is $6.

But the question is "how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?" So, since jogger is $6 less, does that mean it's -$6? But that doesn't make sense because it's asking how much more.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Maybe it's supposed to be "how much more did the tattered jeans cost than the jogger jeans originally?" But the question is written as "how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?"

Which seems to be $6 less, so maybe the answer is -$6, but that's not typical in such problems.

Wait, maybe the problem is trying to trick us into thinking that the original prices were different, but actually, the original difference is $6.

Alternatively, maybe the question is miswritten, and it should be "how much more did the tattered jeans cost than the jogger jeans originally?" Then, the answer would be $6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about something else.

Wait, let me re-express the problem:

- Tattered jeans original price: $28.

- Jogger jeans original price: $28 - $6 = $22.

- He bought both.

- He saved a total of $6.

- He saved 1/3 from jogger, so $2.

- He saved 2/3 from tattered, so $4.

Therefore, the original prices are $28 and $22, difference is $6.

But the question is asking "how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?" So, the answer is jogger is $6 less, so maybe the answer is -$6. But since the question is phrased as "how much more," which implies a positive difference, perhaps it's $6 less.

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct, and the difference is actually higher.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the savings.

Wait, maybe he saved a total of $6 on both, meaning he didn't spend $6 in total. So, the total he would have spent without savings is $28 + $22 = $50. But he saved $6, so he only spent $44.

Wait, but the problem says he saved a total of $6, which could mean he didn't spend $6, but rather saved $6 compared to some amount.

Wait, the problem is a bit unclear. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, original prices:

Tattered: $28

Jogger: $28 - $6 = $22

Total original price: $28 + $22 = $50

He bought both on sale, so he paid less than $50. The total amount he saved is $6, so he only spent $50 - $6 = $44.

He saved $6 in total, with 1/3 from jogger and 2/3 from tattered.

So, savings from jogger: 1/3 * 6 = $2

Savings from tattered: 2/3 * 6 = $4

Therefore, the sale prices are:

Tattered: $28 - $4 = $24

Jogger: $22 - $2 = $20

So, now, the question is, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than tattered jeans.

Original price of jogger: $22

Original price of tattered: $28

Difference: $22 - $28 = -$6

But since the question is "how much more," it's a bit confusing because it's negative. So, perhaps we should answer $6, but specify it's less.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?" So, it's actually the difference in original prices, which is $22 - $28 = -$6, meaning jogger is $6 less, so the answer is $6 less. But since it's asking "how much more," maybe it's $6.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be "how much more do tattered jeans cost than jogger jeans," which would be $6.

But according to the problem, it's asking about jogger compared to tattered.

Wait, maybe the problem is a bit different. Let me read it again.

" Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?"

Wait, so in the original statement, it says the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered ones. So, the original difference is $6, meaning jogger is $6 less.

Then, the question is how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than tattered. So, that's $6 less, so the answer is -$6. But in terms of amount, it's $6.

But the problem says he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger and the rest from the tattered. So, he saved $2 from jogger and $4 from tattered.

So, the original price of jogger is $22, he saved $2, so he paid $20.

Original price of tattered is $28, he saved $4, so he paid $24.

Therefore, the original prices are $22 and $28, difference is $6. But the question is about how much more jogger originally costs than tattered. So, since it's $6 less, the answer is -$6, but in terms of absolute value, it's $6.

But the question is asking how much more, so maybe it's expecting $6 as the answer, even though it's actually less.

Wait, perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying he saved a total of $6 on both, but the amount saved from each is different: 1/3 and 2/3.

So, total savings: $6.

1/3 on jogger: $2

2/3 on tattered: $4

Therefore, the original price of jogger is higher by $2, so he saved $2 on jogger, making the original price $22 + $2 = $24.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the original price of jogger is $22.

Wait, hold on. Maybe the original price of the jogger is not $22, but something else.

Wait, hold on. Let me define:

Let me denote:

Let T = original price of tattered jeans = $28

Let J = original price of jogger jeans = T - 6 = $22

Total original price = T + J = $50

He saved a total of $6, so he paid $44.

He saved 1/3 of the total savings from jogger, which is 1/3 * 6 = $2.

So, he saved $2 on jogger, meaning the sale price of jogger is J - 2 = $20.

He saved 2/3 of the total savings from tattered, which is 2/3 * 6 = $4.

So, he saved $4 on tattered, meaning the sale price is T - 4 = $24.

Therefore, the original prices were $28 and $22, so the difference is $6.

But the question is how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than tattered jeans? So, since $22 - $28 = -$6, meaning jogger is $6 less, so the answer is $6 less.

But since the question is written as "how much more," it's a bit confusing. Maybe it's a translation issue or something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a positive answer, so $6.

Alternatively, maybe I have to compute something else.

Wait, maybe the question is asking about the difference in the sale prices, but no, it's asking about the original prices.

Wait, no, the original prices were $28 and $22, so the difference is $6, but the question is how much more jogger originally cost than tattered, which is the same as the original difference, just phrased differently.

So, the answer is $6. Because the original difference is $6, but since it's asking how much more, which would be positive, so $6.

Therefore, despite the wording, the answer is $6.

Wait, but in the original problem, it says "how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?" So, if the original price of jogger is $22, and tattered is $28, then jogger is $6 less. So, the answer is jogger is $6 less, which is -$6. But since the question is phrased as "how much more," it's expecting a positive number, so $6.

So, maybe the answer is $6.

Alternatively, maybe the question is written incorrectly, and it should be "how much more do tattered jeans cost than jogger jeans," which would then be $6.

But since it's asking about jogger compared to tattered, the answer is $6 less.

But in the problem statement, it says the jogger jeans cost $6 less, so the original difference is $6.

Therefore, regardless of the phrasing, the answer is $6.

So, I think the answer is $6.

**Final Answer**
The jogger jeans originally cost $\boxed{6}$ dollars more than the tattered jeans.
</think>

Cole wanted to buy both tattered jeans and jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, while the jogger jeans cost $6 less, which is $22. He saved a total of $6 by buying both, with 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. 

The savings from the jogger jeans are 1/3 of $6, which is $2, and the savings from the tattered jeans are 2/3 of $6, which is $4. 

The original prices of the tattered jeans were $28 and the jogger jeans were $22. The difference in the original prices is $6. 

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $\boxed{6}$ dollars more than the tattered jeans.
