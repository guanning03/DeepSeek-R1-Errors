Question:
Baldur gets water from a well. He gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. If each pail contains 5 liters of water, how many liters of water does he get every day?

Correct Answer:
Baldur gets 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 liters of water in the morning.
He gets 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 liters of water in the afternoon.
Therefore, the total liters of water he gets every day is 30 + 25 = <<30+25=55>>55.

Gold:
55

Wrong Prediction:
55\

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total number of pails Baldur collects each day. He gets 5 pails in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon, which adds up to 11 pails in total.

Next, since each pail contains 5 liters of water, I'll multiply the total number of pails by the liters per pail to find the total water collected daily.

Finally, multiplying 11 pails by 5 liters per pail gives 55 liters of water per day.

**Solution:**

To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pails per day:**
   
   - Pails in the morning: 5
   - Pails in the afternoon: 6
   
   \[
   \text{Total pails per day} = 5 + 6 = 11 \text{ pails}
   \]

2. **Determine the total liters of water per day:**
   
   - Each pail contains 5 liters.
   
   \[
   \text{Total liters per day} = 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 55 \text{ liters}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{55\ \text{liters}}
\]
