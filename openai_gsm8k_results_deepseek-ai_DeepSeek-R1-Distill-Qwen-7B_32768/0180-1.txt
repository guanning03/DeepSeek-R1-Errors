Question:
Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began.  After the practice time was over, he asked Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick up the balls and carry them over to the bag.  The three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip.  Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. If Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?

Correct Answer:
Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 balls.
Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 ball.
In total, the three boys carried 4+2+1=<<4+2+1=7>>7 balls, which were all the balls the coach brought to practice.
#### 7

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll define the number of balls each boy carried using variables. Let's let J represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried, B represent the number Jason carried, and T represent the number Jordan carried.

According to the problem, Jason carried 2 balls. So, B = 2.

Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, which means B = 2J. Substituting B = 2 into this equation gives 2 = 2J, so J = 1. Jeffrey carried 1 ball.

Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so T = 2B. Since B = 2, T = 4. Jordan carried 4 balls.

To find the total number of balls, I'll add up the balls carried by all three boys: J + B + T = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

Therefore, the coach brought a total of 7 balls to practice.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Jason carried 2 balls.**
- **Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.**
- **Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason.**

**Letâ€™s define:**
- Let \( J \) be the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
- Let \( B \) be the number of balls Jason carried.
- Let \( T \) be the number of balls Jordan carried.

**From the problem:**
1. **Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey:**
   \[
   B = 2J
   \]
   
2. **Jason carried twice as many balls as Jordan:**
   \[
   B = 2T
   \]
   
3. **Jason carried 2 balls:**
   \[
   B = 2
   \]

**Step 1:** Substitute \( B = 2 \) into the first equation to find \( J \):
\[
2 = 2J \quad \Rightarrow \quad J = 1
\]

**Step 2:** Substitute \( B = 2 \) into the second equation to find \( T \):
\[
2 = 2T \quad \Rightarrow \quad T = 1
\]

**Step 3:** Calculate the total number of balls carried by all three:
\[
\text{Total balls} = J + B + T = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
