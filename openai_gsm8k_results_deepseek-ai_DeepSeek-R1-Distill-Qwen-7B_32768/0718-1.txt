Question:
Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. This means that each hour the AC uses 900 watts of energy. If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, how many kilowatts of electric energy will he save in 30 days?

Correct Answer:
An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.
An air conditioner uses 900 x 5 = <<900*5=4500>>4500 watts for 5 hours a day.
So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.
Hence, in 30 days he will have 2.7 x 30 = <<2.7*30=81>>81 kilowatts of electric energy saved.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Mel has this air conditioner that uses 900 watts, right? And he's using it for 8 hours a day. But he wants to reduce the time he uses it by 5 hours each day. Hmm, so I need to figure out how much energy he'll save in kilowatts over 30 days.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The air conditioner's power is 900 watts, and he uses it for 8 hours daily. If he reduces the time by 5 hours, that means he'll only be using it for 3 hours a day, right? Because 8 minus 5 is 3. So, instead of 8 hours, he's going to use it for 3 hours each day.

Now, the question is about the energy saved. So, I think I need to calculate the energy used before the reduction and after the reduction, then find the difference and multiply by 30 days to get the total savings.

Let me recall the formula for energy. Energy is equal to power multiplied by time, right? So, in this case, the power is 900 watts, and the time is the number of hours he uses it each day. But since energy is usually measured in kilowatt-hours, I might need to convert watts to kilowatts before doing the calculations.

First, let's compute the daily energy usage before the reduction. So, 900 watts is the same as 0.9 kilowatts because 1 kilowatt is 1000 watts. So, 900 divided by 1000 is 0.9 kilowatts. Now, he uses it for 8 hours a day. So, the daily energy consumption is 0.9 kilowatts multiplied by 8 hours. Let me compute that: 0.9 * 8 equals 7.2 kilowatt-hours per day.

Okay, now let's figure out the energy usage after he reduces the time by 5 hours. So, he'll only be using it for 3 hours a day. So, again, using 0.9 kilowatts for 3 hours. That would be 0.9 * 3, which is 2.7 kilowatt-hours per day.

So, the difference in daily energy usage is 7.2 minus 2.7. Let me subtract those: 7.2 - 2.7 is 4.5 kilowatt-hours saved each day. Hmm, that seems like a significant saving.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations. 0.9 times 8 is indeed 7.2, and 0.9 times 3 is 2.7. Subtracting, 7.2 minus 2.7 is 4.5. Yep, that looks right.

Now, to find the total energy saved over 30 days, I can multiply the daily saving by 30. So, 4.5 kilowatt-hours per day times 30 days. Let me compute that: 4.5 * 30. Hmm, 4 times 30 is 120, and 0.5 times 30 is 15, so adding those together is 135. So, 4.5 * 30 is 135 kilowatt-hours.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake there. 4.5 multiplied by 30. Another way to think about it is 4.5 * 10 is 45, so 4.5 * 30 is 45 * 3, which is 135. Yep, that's correct.

Just to recap, the steps I took were:

1. Convert the power from watts to kilowatts: 900 watts = 0.9 kilowatts.
2. Calculate the daily energy usage before reduction: 0.9 kW * 8 hours = 7.2 kWh.
3. Calculate the daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours: 0.9 kW * 3 hours = 2.7 kWh.
4. Find the daily energy saving: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.
5. Multiply the daily saving by 30 days to get the total saving: 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

So, all my steps check out, and I don't see any errors in the calculations. Therefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days by reducing the air conditioner usage time by 5 hours each day.

I think that's all. Wait, just to be thorough, let me verify the initial reduction calculation. He was using it 8 hours a day, which is 8 hours, and he's reducing by 5 hours, so that's 8 - 5 = 3 hours. Yes, that's correct. So, the reduction in time is indeed 5 hours, so the new usage time is 3 hours.

Another way to think about it: the power remains the same at 0.9 kW, so the energy used is directly proportional to the time. So, if he uses it 5 fewer hours each day, that's 5 hours less. The energy saved per day is 5 hours multiplied by 0.9 kW, which is 4.5 kWh per day. Then, over 30 days, 4.5 * 30 is 135 kWh. This method also gives the same result, so that's consistent.

So, both methods—calculating the difference between the two usages and calculating the reduction based on the time saved—give the same answer, which is reassuring.

I think that's all. I can't spot any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations.

**Final Answer**
The electric energy saved in 30 days is \boxed{135} kilowatts.

Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. To find the energy saved by reducing the usage time by 5 hours each day over 30 days, we follow these steps:

1. Convert the power from watts to kilowatts: 
   \[
   900 \text{ watts} = 0.9 \text{ kilowatts}
   \]

2. Calculate the daily energy usage before reduction:
   \[
   0.9 \text{ kW} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7.2 \text{ kilowatt-hours}
   \]

3. Calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours (using it for 3 hours a day):
   \[
   0.9 \text{ kW} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours}
   \]

4. Find the daily energy saving:
   \[
   7.2 \text{ kWh} - 2.7 \text{ kWh} = 4.5 \text{ kWh}
   \]

5. Multiply the daily saving by 30 days to get the total saving:
   \[
   4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kilowatt-hours}
   \]

Thus, the electric energy saved in 30 days is \boxed{135} kilowatts.
