Question:
Avery needs to buy a 3 piece place setting (dinner & salad plate and a bowl) for her holiday dinner.  She’s having 12 people over for dinner.  If the dinner plates cost $6.00 each and bowls each cost $5.00 and the salad plates cost $4.00, how much will she spend on place settings?

Correct Answer:
Each place setting will need a dinner plate that’s $6.00, a bowl for $5.00 and a salad plate that’s $4.00 so each place setting will cost 6+5+4 = $<<6+5+4=15.00>>15.00
She needs 12 place settings for her guests and they're $15.00 each so she will spend 12*15 = $<<12*15=180.00>>180.00 on the place settings.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total cost of the dinner plates. Since each dinner plate costs $6.00 and Avery needs 3 plates, the total cost for the dinner plates is 3 multiplied by $6.00, which equals $18.00.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost of the bowls. Each bowl costs $5.00, and she also needs 3 bowls. Therefore, the total cost for the bowls is 3 multiplied by $5.00, totaling $15.00.

Finally, I'll find the cost of the salad plates. Each salad plate costs $4.00, and Avery requires 3 of them. Multiplying 3 by $4.00 gives a total of $12.00 for the salad plates.

To find the overall total cost, I'll add the costs of the dinner plates, bowls, and salad plates together: $18.00 plus $15.00 plus $12.00, which equals $45.00.

Therefore, Avery will spend a total of $45.00 on place settings.

- A dinner plate
- A salad plate
- A bowl

**Costs:**
- Dinner plate: \$6.00
- Salad plate: \$4.00
- Bowl: \$5.00

**Calculations:**

1. **Total Cost for Dinner Plates:**
   \[
   3 \text{ plates} \times \$6.00/\text{plate} = \$18.00
   \]

2. **Total Cost for Salad Plates:**
   \[
   3 \text{ plates} \times \$4.00/\text{plate} = \$12.00
   \]

3. **Total Cost for Bowls:**
   \[
   3 \text{ bowls} \times \$5.00/\text{bowl} = \$15.00
   \]

4. **Total Cost for All Place Settings:**
   \[
   \$18.00 + \$12.00 + \$15.00 = \$45.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$45}
