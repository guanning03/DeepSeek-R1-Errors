Question:
Finn watches 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond.  Suddenly he sees 6 of them come out of hiding from under a lily pad ,then he sees 2 of them hide under a rock.  How many tadpoles can Finn see in the pond now?

Correct Answer:
When the hidden tadpoles come out, Finn sees 11 + 6 = <<11+6=17>>17 tadpoles swimming.
After some of them hide under a rock, he now sees 17 - 2 = <<17-2=15>>15 tadpoles swimming.
#### 15

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Finn is watching 11 tadpoles in a pond. Then he sees 6 of them come out of hiding from under a lily pad. After that, he notices 2 of them hide under a rock. The question is asking how many tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now.

Hmm, let me break this down. Initially, there are 11 tadpoles in total. When Finn sees 6 come out of hiding, does that mean those 6 are now visible to him? I think so. So, if there were 11 and 6 come out, maybe they're now visible, so they're not hiding anymore.

But then, after that, 2 of them hide under a rock. So, does that mean those 2 are now hidden again? So, they're no longer visible to Finn.

Wait, so initially, all 11 are hidden or swimming around? The problem just says Finn watches 11. So, maybe they're all hidden at the start, and then some come out.

So, if 6 come out, then those 6 are now visible, and the remaining 5 are still hidden. Then, 2 of those 5 hide under a rock, so now, instead of 5 hidden, it's 3 hidden. So, the number of hidden tadpoles is 3, and the number of visible is 6.

Therefore, the total number of visible tadpoles is still 6, right? Because the 2 that hid are no longer visible, so we subtract those 2 from the 8 that came out?

Wait, hold on, maybe I need to think differently. Let me visualize this.

Total tadpoles: 11.

First, 6 come out. So, the number of visible tadpoles is 6, and the number of hidden is 11 - 6 = 5.

Then, 2 of the hidden ones hide under a rock. So, the number of hidden becomes 5 - 2 = 3, but the number of visible remains 6 because those 2 that hid were already hidden before.

Wait, but is the question asking how many are visible or how many are in the pond? Because the 2 that hid are still in the pond, just under a rock. So, if the question is about what's visible, then it's still 6. If it's about the total number in the pond, it's still 11.

But I think the question is asking how many tadpoles Finn can see now, so that would be the number of visible ones. So, 6.

But let me make sure. Initially, he sees 11. Then 6 come out, so now he sees 6. Then 2 hide, so he can't see those 2 anymore. So, the number he can see is 6.

Wait, but another way to think about it: When 6 come out, they are visible, so he sees 6. Then, 2 hide, so he can no longer see those 2, but the remaining 5 are still visible. So, total visible would be 6 (from the first batch) minus the 2 that hid, but wait, no, the 2 that hid were already hidden before.

Wait, maybe the total visible is still 6 because the 2 that hid were already not visible. So, 6 are visible, 2 are hidden under a rock, and 3 are still in the pond but not hidden.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see:

Total tadpoles: 11.

6 come out, so visible: 6.

Then, 2 of the remaining 5 (since 11 - 6 = 5) hide under a rock, so now hidden: 2.

So, visible: 6, hidden: 3 (because 5 - 2 = 3). So, total in the pond: 6 + 3 = 9? But the total should still be 11 because 6 are visible, 2 are hidden under a rock, and 3 are just in the pond but not hidden.

Wait, no, the 3 are still in the pond, just not under the rock. So, the total is 6 (visible) + 2 (hidden under rock) + 3 (still in the pond) = 11. That makes sense.

But the question is, how many can Finn see? So, it's 6.

Wait, but another perspective: When the 2 hide under the rock, are they no longer visible? So, he had 6 visible, then 2 hide, so he can no longer see those 2, so he sees 6 - 2 = 4? But that doesn't seem right because the 2 that hid were already hidden.

Wait, maybe the total number of visible is 6, regardless of the 2 that hid, because 2 are already hidden. So, yeah, he can see 6.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick us into thinking that 6 came out, then 2 went back in, so total is 6 + 2 = 8? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let me think of it in terms of sets.

Initially, all 11 are in the pond. Let's say set A: 11.

6 come out, so visible: 6, remaining hidden: 5.

Then, 2 of those 5 hide under a rock, so now hidden: 2 + (5 - 2) = 2 + 3 = 5? Wait, no.

Wait, if he had 5 hidden, and 2 hide under a rock, that should leave 3 hidden, right? So, total hidden is 2, and total visible is 6.

So, the number visible is still 6. The 2 that hid were already hidden before, so their hiding doesn't affect the count of visible ones.

Alternatively, maybe the 2 that hide make the hidden ones 2, but the visible ones are 6 because the 2 that hid were already not visible. So, I think the answer is 6.

But to make sure, let me think of it another way.

Total tadpoles: 11.

6 come out: visible = 6, hidden = 5.

Then, 2 of the hidden ones hide under a rock: hidden becomes 5 - 2 = 3, but visible remains 6.

So, visible is still 6.

Alternatively, if 2 hide, does that mean that those 2 are now not visible? So, from the visible 6, 2 leave, so visible becomes 4? But that can't be because the 2 are already not visible.

Wait, maybe the 2 that hide are in addition to the ones already hidden. So, initially, 5 were hidden. Then, 2 of them hide under a rock. So, the number hidden becomes 5 + 2 = 7? But that can't be, because total is 11.

Wait, no, because the 2 that hide are part of the 5 that were already hidden.

So, 5 were hidden, 2 of them hide under a rock, so now 2 are under a rock and 3 are still hidden but not under a rock.

So, total hidden: 2 (under rock) + 3 (hidden in pond) = 5.

Total visible: 6.

So, yeah, still 6.

Wait, so even though 2 of them hide, they were already hidden. So, the number of visible ones is still 6. The number of hidden ones becomes 5.

So, the answer is 6.

But to make sure, let me do it step by step.

Start: 11 in the pond.

6 come out: visible = 6, hidden = 5.

Then, 2 of the hidden ones hide under a rock: hidden becomes 5 - 2 = 3, but the 2 are still hidden. So, visible remains 6.

Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see is 6.

Wait, but isn't 6 + 2 = 8, which is less than 11? That can't be.

Wait, no, because the 2 that hide are part of the 5 that were already hidden.

So, total visible is 6, total hidden is 5 (2 under rock + 3 still hidden). So, 6 + 5 = 11, which is correct.

So, yeah, the answer is 6.

**Final Answer**
The number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now is \boxed{6}.
</think>

Finn starts by watching 11 tadpoles in the pond. When he sees 6 of them come out of hiding from under a lily pad, those 6 become visible. This leaves 5 tadpoles still hidden. Then, 2 of those 5 hidden tadpoles hide under a rock, making them no longer visible. 

The number of visible tadpoles remains 6, as the 2 that hid were already hidden. Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]
