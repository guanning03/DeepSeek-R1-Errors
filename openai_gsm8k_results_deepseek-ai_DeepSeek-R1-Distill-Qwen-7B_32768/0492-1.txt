Question:
Dale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his club at school. He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?

Correct Answer:
Dale starts off selling 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered, but ends up selling 150, 100 - 150 = <<100-150=-50>>-50 candies.
So Dale orders 100 more candies to make up for the deficit and to sell even more, -50 candies + 100 candies = <<100-50=50>>50 candies Dale has left and still needs to sell.
#### 50

Gold:
50

Wrong Prediction:
150

Wrong Answer:
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Dale is selling butterscotch candies and he's trying to raise money for his club. He started by ordering 100 candies, right? But then he sold 150 of them. Hmm, that seems like he sold more than he had. Wait, so he didn't have all the candies yet, but he ended up selling 150. 

Let me break this down. He initially ordered 100 candies. He sold 150. So, does he have any left from the first order? I don't think so because he only ordered 100, but he sold 150. So, that means he must have run out of the first 100 and then probably ordered more. 

After that, he ordered 100 more. So, he sold 150, then ordered another 100. Now, how many does he have in total? Wait, no, he already sold 150 from the first 100, so he didn't have any left from the first order. Then he ordered 100 more. So, he has 100 more candies to sell.

But hold on, he sold 150 in total, so if he only had 100 to begin with, he must have had to get 50 more from somewhere else? Or maybe he had some stock before? The problem doesn't specify, so I think we can assume he only had the 100 he ordered initially and then ordered another 100.

So, let's recast this. He started with 100, sold 150. So, he sold all 100 he had and then 50 more from the next order. Then he ordered another 100. So now, how many does he have left?

He sold 150, so he sold 100 from the first order and 50 from the second order. Then he ordered another 100. So, the second order was 100, he sold 50, so he has 50 left from the second order. Then he ordered another 100, so now he has 50 plus 100, which is 150 candies remaining.

Wait, but the question is asking how many does he still need to sell to sell all of his candy. So, if he has 150 candies left, he needs to sell 150 more.

Wait, let me double-check. Initially, he had 100, sold 150, so he must have needed to order another 50 to fulfill the 150 sales. But then he ordered another 100, making the total remaining 100 - 50 sold + 100 ordered, so 150. So, he needs to sell 150 more.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. He started with 100, sold all 100, then had to order another 50 to fulfill the 150 sale. Then he ordered another 100, so he had 50 + 100 = 150 left. So, he still needs to sell 150.

But another way to think about it: he sold 150 in total, started with 100, so he needed 50 more. Then he ordered another 100, so he has 100, of which he sold 50, so 50 left from that order, and then the new order is 100. So total remaining is 50 + 100 = 150. Therefore, he needs to sell 150 more.

Wait, is there another interpretation? Maybe he only had 100 initially, sold 150, which is 50 more than he had. So, he had to get 50 more from somewhere else, but since he only ordered another 100, he now has 100 + (100 - 50) = 150. So yeah, 150 left.

I think that's the answer. He still needs to sell 150 more candies to have all sold.

**Final Answer**
Dale still needs to sell \boxed{150} butterscotch candies.
</think>

Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150. This means he sold all 100 he initially had and needed to order another 50 to fulfill the remaining 50 sales. After selling 50 from the next order, he had 50 left. He then ordered another 100, making the total remaining candies 50 + 100 = 150. Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 150 more candies.

\[
\boxed{150}
