Question:
Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.  If he was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, how many reports did he staple altogether?

Correct Answer:
In one hour, there are 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 (15 minutes).
From 8am - 11am, there are 11 - 8 = <<11-8=3>>3 hours.
In 3 hours, there are 3 x 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 (15 minutes).
In those 3 hours, Vince stapled 12 x 30 = <<12*30=360>>360 reports.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. I need to figure out how many reports he staples from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably figure out how long he was stapling reports. He starts at 8:00 AM and ends at 11:00 PM. Wait, that's a pretty long time. Let me convert that into hours or minutes to make calculations easier.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Let me check that: from 8 AM to 12 PM is 4 hours, and from 12 PM to 11 PM is 11 hours, so 4 + 11 is 15 hours. Yeah, that's right.

Now, he staples reports every 15 minutes. So, how many 15-minute intervals are there in 15 hours? Well, each hour has 60 minutes, so 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour. Therefore, there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour. So, in 15 hours, how many 15-minute intervals would there be? Let me calculate that.

15 hours multiplied by 4 intervals per hour. 15 x 4 is 60. So, there are 60 intervals of 15 minutes in 15 hours. Wait, but hold on, that might not be right. Let me think again.

Wait, if each hour has 4 quarters, then 15 hours would have 15 x 4 = 60 quarters. So, 60 intervals. But each interval is 15 minutes, so 60 intervals x 15 minutes would be 900 minutes, which is 15 hours. Yeah, that checks out.

But wait, he staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. So, in each 15-minute interval, he does 30 reports. So, if there are 60 intervals in 15 hours, how many reports is that?

So, 30 reports per interval times 60 intervals. 30 x 60 is 1800. So, does that mean he staples 1800 reports in total?

Wait, hold on a second. Let me double-check my math because sometimes these time problems can be tricky.

He starts at 8:00 AM. So, first 15 minutes: 8:00 AM to 8:15 AM, he does 30 reports. Then, 8:15 AM to 8:30 AM, another 30, and so on. So, each 15-minute block adds 30 reports.

So, how many blocks are there in 15 hours? As we established earlier, 60 blocks. So, 60 x 30 is indeed 1800 reports.

Wait, but let me think about whether it's 60 blocks or 60 something else. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of intervals.

Wait, starting at 8:00 AM, the first interval is 8:00 AM to 8:15 AM, which is the first 15 minutes. Then, the second is 8:15 to 8:30, and so on until 11:00 PM.

So, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Each hour has 4 intervals, so 15 x 4 = 60 intervals.

But let's verify with another approach. Let's calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then see how many 15-minute intervals are in that time.

15 hours is 15 x 60 = 900 minutes. Each interval is 15 minutes, so 900 / 15 = 60 intervals. So, that's consistent.

Therefore, 60 intervals x 30 reports per interval = 1800 reports.

Wait, hold on another thing. Is he working continuously from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM without breaks? If so, then my calculation is correct. But sometimes in these problems, they might consider starting and ending times, so maybe the last interval ends at 11:00 PM exactly.

Wait, starting at 8:00 AM, adding 15 minutes each time. So, from 8:00 AM, first interval 8:00-8:15, second 8:15-8:30, and so on.

So, the last interval would end at 11:00 PM. Let's see, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Each hour has 4 intervals, so 15 x 4 is 60 intervals. So, the last interval would end at 11:00 PM. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, let me think of it as the number of reports per hour. If he does 30 reports every 15 minutes, how many does he do in an hour?

Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, he does 4 x 30 = 120 reports per hour.

Then, over 15 hours, that would be 120 x 15.

Calculating that, 120 x 10 is 1200, 120 x 5 is 600, so total 1200 + 600 = 1800 reports.

Yeah, so that corroborates the previous calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as his stapling rate. If he does 30 reports in 15 minutes, how many reports per minute is that?

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports per minute.

Then, over 900 minutes, his total reports would be 2 x 900 = 1800.

So, that's another method leading to the same answer. So, that's comforting.

Wait, let me make sure that 30 reports in 15 minutes is 2 per minute. 30 divided by 15 is 2. Yeah, that's correct.

So, 2 reports per minute x 900 minutes is 1800.

Therefore, regardless of the method I use, I get 1800 reports.

So, I think 1800 is the correct answer.

But just to make sure, let me think about whether the time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is indeed 15 hours.

So, from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM is 4 hours, then from 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM is 11 hours. 4 + 11 is 15. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I think in 24-hour format, 8 AM is 8, 11 PM is 23. So, 23 - 8 = 15 hours. Yeah, that's correct.

So, 15 hours in total.

So, 15 hours x 60 minutes per hour is 900 minutes. 900 minutes divided by 15 minutes per interval is 60 intervals. 60 intervals x 30 reports per interval is 1800.

Alternatively, 15 hours x 2 reports per minute is 30 reports per hour x 15 hours is 450? Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, no, 2 reports per minute x 15 hours.

Wait, 15 hours is 900 minutes, so 2 x 900 is 1800. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, I think I was just second-guessing myself earlier when I thought maybe 30 x 15 was 450, but that's incorrect because 30 is per 15 minutes, not per hour.

So, to clarify, he does 30 in 15 minutes, so in 60 minutes, he does 120. So, per hour, 120.

Yes, 120 x 15 = 1800.

So, all my different methods lead to 1800.

Therefore, I feel confident that the answer is 1800 reports.

**Final Answer**
The total number of reports Vince stapled is \boxed{1800}.
</think>

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To determine how many reports he staples from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we first calculate the total duration he is working.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. 

Next, we convert this duration into 15-minute intervals. Each hour has 4 intervals of 15 minutes, so:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 4 \text{ intervals per hour} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he staples is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports per interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Thus, the total number of reports Vince stapled is \boxed{1800}.
