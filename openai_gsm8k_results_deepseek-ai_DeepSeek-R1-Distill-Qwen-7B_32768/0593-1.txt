Question:
Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%. She has to pay an equal amount every month. How much does she have to pay per month?

Correct Answer:
Karan's interest is $3,650 × 0.1 = $<<3650*0.1=365>>365.
In total Karan has to pay $3650 + $365 = $<<3650+365=4015>>4015.
Every month she has to pay $4015 / 5 = $<<4015/5=803>>803.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months, and she has to pay back the amount every month equally. The interest rate is 10%. Hmm, I need to figure out how much she has to pay each month. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that when you borrow money, you have to pay back the principal amount plus interest. The interest here is 10% per annum, which I assume is the annual rate. But she borrowed the money for only five months, so I need to calculate the interest for that specific period.

So, the principal amount is $3,650. The rate is 10% per year, and the time is five months. I need to convert the time from months to years because the rate is given annually. There are 12 months in a year, so five months would be 5/12 years.

To find the interest, the formula is:

Interest = Principal × Rate × Time

Plugging in the numbers:

Interest = 3650 × 10% × (5/12)

First, let me convert 10% to decimal, which is 0.10.

So, Interest = 3650 × 0.10 × (5/12)

Let me calculate 3650 × 0.10 first. That should be 365, right?

Then, multiply that result by (5/12). So, 365 × (5/12).

Let me compute 365 divided by 12 first. 365 ÷ 12 is approximately 30.4167. Then, multiply that by 5: 30.4167 × 5 = 152.0833.

So, the interest is approximately $152.08.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check my calculation again.

Alternatively, I can compute 3650 × 0.10 = 365. Then, 365 × (5/12). 5/12 is approximately 0.4167. So, 365 × 0.4167.

Calculating that: 365 × 0.4 = 146, and 365 × 0.0167 ≈ 6.09. So, 146 + 6.09 ≈ 152.09. Yep, that's about $152.09.

So, the total amount she has to pay back is principal plus interest: 3650 + 152.09 = 3802.09.

Now, she has to pay this amount equally over five months. So, I need to divide the total amount by 5.

3802.09 ÷ 5. Let me compute that.

3800 ÷ 5 is 760, and 2.09 ÷ 5 is approximately 0.418. So, adding those together, it's 760 + 0.418 = 760.418.

So, approximately $760.42 per month.

Wait, let me use a calculator for more precision.

Total amount to pay back is 3650 + (3650 × 0.10 × 5/12).

Calculating 3650 × 0.10 = 365.

365 × 5 = 1825.

1825 ÷ 12 is 152.0833.

So, total amount is 3650 + 152.0833 = 3802.0833.

Divide that by 5: 3802.0833 ÷ 5.

3802.0833 ÷ 5: 3800 ÷ 5 = 760, 2.0833 ÷ 5 = 0.41666. So, total is 760 + 0.41666 = 760.41666.

So, approximately $760.42 per month.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the exact fractional value.

3802.0833 divided by 5 is exactly 3802.0833 / 5 = 760.41666. So, in decimal, that's $760.42 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Alternatively, if I'm supposed to round to the nearest dollar, it would be $760 per month.

But the question doesn't specify, so I think it's safer to provide it to the nearest cent, which is $760.42.

Wait a second, is there another way to compute this?

I remember sometimes loans can be amortized, meaning each payment covers the interest for the period and the principal. Maybe I should use the amortization formula.

The formula for the monthly payment is:

Payment = (P × r × (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)

Where P is the principal, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments.

Let me try that.

First, convert the annual rate of 10% to a monthly rate.

10% per year is 0.10, so monthly rate is 0.10 / 12 = 0.008333...

Number of payments, n, is 5.

So, plugging into the formula:

Payment = (3650 × 0.008333... × (1 + 0.008333...)^5) / ((1 + 0.008333...)^5 - 1)

Let me compute (1 + 0.008333...)^5 first.

1.008333^5. Let me compute that step by step.

1.008333^1 = 1.008333

1.008333^2 = 1.008333 × 1.008333 ≈ 1.016736

1.008333^3 ≈ 1.016736 × 1.008333 ≈ 1.025254

1.008333^4 ≈ 1.025254 × 1.008333 ≈ 1.033898

1.008333^5 ≈ 1.033898 × 1.008333 ≈ 1.042506

So, approx 1.042506.

Now, numerator: 3650 × 0.008333 × 1.042506

First, 3650 × 0.008333 ≈ 3650 × 0.008333 ≈ 30.416665

Then, 30.416665 × 1.042506 ≈ Let's compute that.

30.416665 × 1.042506

First, 30.416665 × 1 = 30.416665

30.416665 × 0.042506 ≈ 30.416665 × 0.04 = 1.2166666

30.416665 × 0.002506 ≈ approximately 0.07622

Adding those together: 1.2166666 + 0.07622 ≈ 1.2928866

So, total numerator ≈ 30.416665 + 1.2928866 ≈ 31.70955

Denominator: (1.042506 - 1) = 0.042506

So, payment ≈ 31.70955 / 0.042506 ≈ Let me compute that.

31.70955 ÷ 0.042506

Well, 0.042506 × 745 ≈ 31.70955

Because 0.042506 × 700 = 29.7542

0.042506 × 45 ≈ 1.91277

Adding those: 29.7542 + 1.91277 ≈ 31.66697

Which is close to 31.70955, so perhaps 745.15.

Wait, 0.042506 × 745 = ?

Let me compute 745 × 0.042506:

700 × 0.042506 = 29.7542

45 × 0.042506 ≈ 1.91277

Total ≈ 29.7542 + 1.91277 ≈ 31.66697

Difference from numerator: 31.70955 - 31.66697 ≈ 0.04258

So, 0.04258 ÷ 0.042506 ≈ 1.0019

So, total payment ≈ 745 + 1.0019 ≈ 746.0019

So, approximately $746.00 per month.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated simple interest and divided, I got around $760.42. There's a significant difference here. So, which one is correct?

I think the discrepancy is because the first method was simple interest, whereas the second method is using amortization, which accounts for the fact that each payment covers the interest for that period and reduces the principal accordingly.

So, in simple interest, you calculate interest on the original principal for the entire period, which is what I did first. But in reality, when you make monthly payments, the principal reduces each month, so the interest each month is less because it's calculated on a smaller principal.

Therefore, the second method using the amortization formula is more accurate because it takes into account the decreasing principal.

So, the monthly payment should be approximately $746.00.

Wait, but in my initial calculation with the amortization formula, I got approximately $746.00, but when I calculated it more precisely, it was about $746.0019, which is effectively $746.00.

But here's the thing: the initial simple interest approach gave me about $760.42, which is higher, and the amortization approach gave me about $746.00, which is lower.

I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, actually, in the simple interest calculation, I computed the total interest as $152.09, leading to a total payback of $3802.09, which when divided by 5 gives $760.42 per month.

But in the amortization calculation, the monthly payment is $746.00. So, which one is correct?

I think the confusion is about whether the interest is simple or compound, and whether the payments are applied to interest and principal.

In the simple interest case, the interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire period, so the total interest is $152.09, as I calculated.

But in the amortization method, each payment goes towards the interest for that month, and the remainder goes towards the principal, reducing the principal for the next month.

So, perhaps in the problem statement, it's simply asking for simple interest, but it's not entirely clear.

The problem says, "she has to pay an equal amount every month." It doesn't specify whether the interest is simple or compound or if it's being amortized.

But in real-life loans, especially short-term ones like five months, the interest is usually calculated and paid in such a way that each payment reduces the principal, so the amortization method would be more accurate.

However, sometimes in such problems, unless specified, simple interest is used. But I think given that it's a short-term loan, the amortization method is more appropriate.

Wait, let me check the formula again. So, when you have a loan with equal monthly payments, the payment is calculated using the present value of an annuity formula, which is the same as the amortization formula.

Therefore, the correct approach here is the second method, which gives approximately $746.00 per month.

But let me check my calculation again because 746 seems a bit low compared to 760.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error in the amortization method.

Let me recompute the amortization payment step by step.

First, the monthly interest rate is 10% / 12 = 0.008333...

Number of payments, n = 5

Principal, P = 3650

The formula is:

Payment = P * [ r(1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ]

So, let me compute (1 + r)^n first.

(1 + 0.008333)^5

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.008333 is approximately 1/120.

So, 1.008333^5 can be calculated as:

First, compute ln(1.008333) ≈ 0.008298

Multiply by 5: 0.04149

Exponentiate: e^0.04149 ≈ 1.0425

So, approximately 1.0425, as I did before.

So, numerator: 3650 * 0.008333 * 1.0425

So, 3650 * 0.008333 is 30.416665

30.416665 * 1.0425 ≈ 30.416665 + (30.416665 * 0.0425)

Compute 30.416665 * 0.0425:

First, 30 * 0.0425 = 1.275

0.416665 * 0.0425 ≈ 0.017709

Total ≈ 1.275 + 0.017709 ≈ 1.292709

So, numerator ≈ 30.416665 + 1.292709 ≈ 31.709374

Denominator: 1.0425 - 1 = 0.0425

So, payment ≈ 31.709374 / 0.0425 ≈ Let's compute this.

31.709374 ÷ 0.0425

Well, 0.0425 × 745 ≈ 31.709375

Because 0.0425 × 700 = 29.75

0.0425 × 45 = 1.9125

29.75 + 1.9125 = 31.6625

So, 0.0425 × 745 = 31.6625 + (0.0425 × 5) = 31.6625 + 0.2125 = 31.875

Wait, that's too high.

Wait, let me try 745 × 0.0425:

700 × 0.0425 = 29.75

45 × 0.0425 = 1.9125

Total: 29.75 + 1.9125 = 31.6625

But we have numerator as 31.709374, so the difference is 31.709374 - 31.6625 = 0.046874

So, 0.046874 ÷ 0.0425 ≈ 1.105

So, total payment is 745 + 1.105 ≈ 746.105

So, approximately $746.11 per month.

Therefore, more precisely, it's approximately $746.11.

Hmm, so about $746.11 per month.

Wait, so now, why is the difference between the simple interest approach and the amortization approach so significant?

Because in the simple interest approach, we're paying interest on the original principal for the entire period, which is 5 months, so that's 10% / 12 * 5 = 4.1667%, leading to $152.08 interest. Total payback $3802.08, divided by 5 is $760.42.

But in the amortization approach, each month, the interest is calculated on the remaining principal, which is decreasing each month, so the total interest is less than in the simple interest case.

So, for example, if you pay off the loan each month, the principal reduces, so the interest each month is less, so the total interest is less than the simple interest.

Wait, but in our case, we're not told whether it's simple interest or if it's being amortized. So, how do we know which one to use?

Looking back at the problem statement: "Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%. She has to pay an equal amount every month. How much does she have to pay per month?"

It doesn't specify whether it's simple interest or if it's being amortized. Hmm.

In some cases, when the loan term is less than a year, and it's not specified, sometimes simple interest is used. But in reality, loans are usually amortized.

But maybe in this problem, it's expecting simple interest.

Wait, let me check what would be the monthly payment for both cases.

If it's simple interest, it's $760.42 per month.

If it's amortized, it's $746.11 per month.

Since the problem doesn't specify, but in typical financial problems, unless stated otherwise, it's usually either simple interest or compound interest. But here, it's not compound interest; it's just 10% per annum.

Wait, the problem says "at an interest rate of 10%." It doesn't specify simple or compound.

In that case, perhaps we need to assume simple interest.

Alternatively, the problem might be expecting the use of the simple interest formula.

Given that, let me recast the problem using simple interest.

Principal: $3650

Rate: 10% per annum

Time: 5 months, which is 5/12 of a year.

Interest = P × R × T = 3650 × 0.10 × (5/12) = 3650 × 0.10 × 0.416667 ≈ 3650 × 0.0416667 ≈ 152.0833

Total amount to pay back: 3650 + 152.0833 ≈ 3802.0833

Divide by 5: 3802.0833 / 5 ≈ 760.416666...

So, approximately $760.42 per month.

Therefore, if we're using simple interest, the monthly payment is approximately $760.42.

But I'm confused because the problem says "she has to pay an equal amount every month," which implies that it's an amortized loan, but doesn't specify.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting simple interest. Let me check the problem again.

"Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%. She has to pay an equal amount every month. How much does she have to pay per month?"

It just says "equal amount every month." It doesn't specify whether it's simple interest or amortized.

In that case, perhaps we should use the simple interest approach.

Therefore, the total amount to be paid back is principal plus simple interest, divided by the number of months.

Thus, the monthly payment would be approximately $760.42.

Alternatively, if we use the amortization method, it's approximately $746.11.

But given that the problem is likely expecting a simple interest calculation, especially since it's only for five months, not a long-term loan.

Also, if it were an amortized loan, the problem would probably mention something about equal monthly payments covering interest and principal or specify that it's an amortizing loan.

So, considering that, I think the answer is approximately $760.42 per month.

But wait, let me just verify with another method.

Suppose Karan pays $760.42 each month for five months.

Total payment: 760.42 × 5 = 3802.10

Total interest paid: 3802.10 - 3650 = 152.10

Which is approximately the interest calculated using simple interest: $152.08.

So, this matches.

Therefore, if the problem expects simple interest, then the monthly payment is $760.42.

Alternatively, if it's an amortized loan, the monthly payment is $746.11, but that would result in less total interest.

Wait, but in reality, the total interest paid over the five months with amortization would be different.

Wait, let's calculate the total interest paid with the amortization payment.

If the monthly payment is $746.11, let's compute the interest paid each month.

First month:

Interest = 3650 × 0.10 × (1/12) = 3650 × 0.008333 ≈ 30.416666

Payment: 746.11

Principal paid: 746.11 - 30.416666 ≈ 715.6933

New principal: 3650 - 715.6933 ≈ 2934.3067

Second month:

Interest: 2934.3067 × 0.008333 ≈ 24.452556

Payment: 746.11

Principal paid: 746.11 - 24.452556 ≈ 721.6574

New principal: 2934.3067 - 721.6574 ≈ 2212.6493

Third month:

Interest: 2212.6493 × 0.008333 ≈ 18.438744

Payment: 746.11

Principal paid: 746.11 - 18.438744 ≈ 727.6713

New principal: 2212.6493 - 727.6713 ≈ 1484.978

Fourth month:

Interest: 1484.978 × 0.008333 ≈ 12.3747

Payment: 746.11

Principal paid: 746.11 - 12.3747 ≈ 733.7353

New principal: 1484.978 - 733.7353 ≈ 751.2427

Fifth month:

Interest: 751.2427 × 0.008333 ≈ 6.260356

Payment: 746.11

Principal paid: 746.11 - 6.260356 ≈ 739.8496

New principal: 751.2427 - 739.8496 ≈ 11.3931

Wait, but after five payments, the principal is not fully paid off yet—it's still about $11.39. So, that's an issue.

Therefore, in reality, with the amortization formula, after five equal payments, the loan isn't fully paid. So, perhaps the monthly payment needs to be adjusted to ensure the loan is paid off in five months.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute the monthly payment again using the formula.

Payment = (P × r × (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)

Where P = 3650, r = 0.10/12 ≈ 0.0083333, n = 5.

So, (1 + 0.0083333)^5 ≈ 1.042506

Numerator: 3650 × 0.0083333 × 1.042506 ≈ 3650 × 0.008703 ≈ 31.729

Denominator: 1.042506 - 1 = 0.042506

So, payment ≈ 31.729 / 0.042506 ≈ 745.00

So, approximately $745.00 per month.

Wait, but when I computed it manually, after five payments, the principal was still about $11.39. That suggests that if we pay $745 per month, after five payments, the principal isn't fully paid.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the last payment to ensure the loan is fully paid.

Alternatively, maybe my manual calculation was slightly off.

Let me try to compute it again with more precise numbers.

Starting principal: $3650

Payment per month: $745.00

Month 1:

Interest: 3650 × 0.10 / 12 = 30.416666...

Payment: 745.00

Principal paid: 745.00 - 30.416666 ≈ 714.5833

New principal: 3650 - 714.5833 ≈ 2935.4167

Month 2:

Interest: 2935.4167 × 0.10 / 12 ≈ 2935.4167 × 0.0083333 ≈ 24.4618

Payment: 745.00

Principal paid: 745.00 - 24.4618 ≈ 720.5382

New principal: 2935.4167 - 720.5382 ≈ 2214.8785

Month 3:

Interest: 2214.8785 × 0.0083333 ≈ 18.4573

Payment: 745.00

Principal paid: 745.00 - 18.4573 ≈ 726.5427

New principal: 2214.8785 - 726.5427 ≈ 1488.3358

Month 4:

Interest: 1488.3358 × 0.0083333 ≈ 12.4028

Payment: 745.00

Principal paid: 745.00 - 12.4028 ≈ 732.5972

New principal: 1488.3358 - 732.5972 ≈ 755.7386

Month 5:

Interest: 755.7386 × 0.0083333 ≈ 6.2979

Payment: 745.00

Principal paid: 745.00 - 6.2979 ≈ 738.7021

New principal: 755.7386 - 738.7021 ≈ 17.0365

So, after five payments, the remaining principal is $17.04, not $11 as before. So, to pay off the loan, the fifth payment should be $745 + $17.04 = $762.04.

But that complicates things because payments would vary in the last month.

But the problem states that she has to pay an equal amount every month, so the payment must be the same each month.

Therefore, perhaps the initial payment calculated via the formula is correct at approximately $745.00 per month, with the understanding that in the last month, a slightly higher payment is made to pay off the remaining balance.

But since the problem states equal monthly payments, perhaps the correct approach is to make the payment each month such that after five payments, the principal is fully paid.

Therefore, the fifth payment must be adjusted to cover the remaining principal.

Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be rounded, but the problem doesn't specify.

Wait, perhaps the initial formula already factors in the rounding.

Wait, when I computed the payment as approximately $745, but in reality, when I computed the payment using the formula, it was approximately $745.00, but due to the rounding, there's a small residual amount.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise decimal places.

Let me try to compute it using more precise numbers.

Compute (1 + 0.10/12)^5:

First, 0.10 / 12 = 0.00833333333

Compute (1.00833333333)^5.

Using a calculator, 1.00833333333^5 ≈ 1.042325571

Numerator: 3650 × 0.00833333333 × 1.042325571

First, 3650 × 0.00833333333 ≈ 30.41666666

30.41666666 × 1.042325571 ≈ Let's compute this.

30.41666666 × 1 = 30.41666666

30.41666666 × 0.042325571 ≈ 30.41666666 × 0.04 = 1.216666666

30.41666666 × 0.002325571 ≈ Approximately 0.070694444

Adding together: 1.216666666 + 0.070694444 ≈ 1.28736111

So, total numerator ≈ 30.41666666 + 1.28736111 ≈ 31.70402777

Denominator: 1.042325571 - 1 = 0.042325571

So, payment ≈ 31.70402777 / 0.042325571 ≈ Let's compute.

31.70402777 ÷ 0.042325571

First, 0.042325571 × 745 ≈ 31.70402777

Because 745 × 0.042325571:

700 × 0.042325571 = 29.6279

45 × 0.042325571 ≈ 1.90465

Total ≈ 29.6279 + 1.90465 ≈ 31.53255

But we need 31.70402777, which is 31.70402777 - 31.53255 ≈ 0.171477 difference.

So, 0.171477 ÷ 0.042325571 ≈ 4.05

So, total payment ≈ 745 + 4.05 ≈ 749.05

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I did that wrong.

Wait, no. Wait, the division is 31.70402777 / 0.042325571 ≈ 745 exactly, as 0.042325571 × 745 ≈ 31.70402777.

So, payment ≈ $745.00 per month.

So, when I computed it step by step, after five payments, the remaining principal was about $17.04, so the fifth payment needs to be $745 + $17.04 ≈ $762.04.

But since the problem states equal monthly payments, the correct way is to compute the payment such that after five months, the principal is zero, so we need to ensure that the last payment covers the remaining principal.

So, perhaps the correct payment is calculated as follows:

We can model this as an annuity. The formula for the monthly payment is:

PMT = PV × [ r × (1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ]

Where PV is the present value, which is $3650.

r is the monthly interest rate, which is 10% / 12 = 0.0083333333

n is the number of periods, which is 5.

So, let's compute this more accurately.

First, compute (1 + r)^n:

(1.0083333333)^5.

Using a calculator:

1.0083333333^1 = 1.0083333333

^2: 1.0083333333 × 1.0083333333 ≈ 1.0167361111

^3: 1.0167361111 × 1.0083333333 ≈ 1.025270061

^4: 1.025270061 × 1.0083333333 ≈ 1.033876283

^5: 1.033876283 × 1.0083333333 ≈ 1.042506

So, (1 + r)^n ≈ 1.042506

Numerator: PV × r × (1 + r)^n = 3650 × 0.0083333333 × 1.042506 ≈ 3650 × 0.008703 ≈ 31.72945

Denominator: (1 + r)^n - 1 ≈ 1.042506 - 1 = 0.042506

So, PMT ≈ 31.72945 / 0.042506 ≈ 745.00

So, PMT ≈ $745.00 per month.

But as we saw earlier, when we compute month by month, after five payments, the principal is still about $17.04.

Therefore, to pay off the loan in five equal payments, the last payment must be slightly higher.

So, to make it equal, perhaps the payment is $745.00 for the first four months, and then in the fifth month, pay $745 + $17.04 ≈ $762.04.

But since the problem says "she has to pay an equal amount every month," this suggests that each payment is the same, so we need to find a payment amount such that the present value of all payments equals $3650.

So, the formula is:

PV = PMT × [ 1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

So, rearranged to solve for PMT:

PMT = PV × r / [ 1 - (1 + r)^-n ]

So, plugging in the numbers:

PV = 3650

r = 0.0083333333

n = 5

So,

PMT = 3650 × 0.0083333333 / [ 1 - (1 + 0.0083333333)^-5 ]

First, compute (1 + 0.0083333333)^-5.

(1.0083333333)^-5 = 1 / (1.0083333333)^5 ≈ 1 / 1.042506 ≈ 0.960074

So,

PMT = 3650 × 0.0083333333 / (1 - 0.960074) ≈ 3650 × 0.0083333333 / 0.039926

Compute numerator: 3650 × 0.0083333333 ≈ 30.41666666

Denominator: 0.039926

So, PMT ≈ 30.41666666 / 0.039926 ≈ 761.63

Therefore, PMT ≈ $761.63 per month.

Wait, that's different from the previous calculation.

Wait, let me compute 30.41666666 / 0.039926.

Calculate 30.41666666 ÷ 0.039926.

First, 0.039926 × 760 ≈ 30.35

0.039926 × 761 ≈ 30.35 + 0.039926 ≈ 30.39

0.039926 × 762 ≈ 30.39 + 0.039926 ≈ 30.43

But we have 30.41666666 as numerator.

So, 0.039926 × 761 ≈ 30.39

Difference: 30.41666666 - 30.39 ≈ 0.02666666

So, 0.02666666 ÷ 0.039926 ≈ 0.668

So, total PMT ≈ 761 + 0.668 ≈ 761.668

So, approximately $761.67 per month.

Therefore, the monthly payment is approximately $761.67.

But let me verify this with another method.

If PMT is $761.67 per month, let's compute the total amount paid.

761.67 × 5 = 3808.35

Subtract the principal: 3808.35 - 3650 = 158.35

So, total interest is $158.35 over five months.

Which gives an effective monthly interest of 158.35 / 5 / 3650 ≈ 158.35 / 18250 ≈ 0.008701 or 0.8701% per month.

Which is slightly higher than the 10% annual rate, as expected due to the compounding.

Alternatively, using the formula, PMT ≈ $761.67.

So, in conclusion, there are two approaches:

1. Simple interest: total payment ≈ $760.42 per month

2. Amortized loan: total payment ≈ $761.67 per month

Given the problem's wording, it's ambiguous which method to use. However, since it mentions "an equal amount every month," it's more likely referring to an amortized loan, even though the exact calculation requires more precise methods.

But in reality, loans are often amortized, so the second method is more accurate.

Therefore, the monthly payment is approximately $761.67.

But let me check with another formula.

The monthly payment can be calculated using the present value of an annuity formula:

PV = PMT × [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r

We can solve for PMT:

PMT = PV × r / [1 - (1 + r)^-n]

Which is what I did earlier.

So, plugging in the numbers:

PMT = 3650 × 0.0083333333 / [1 - (1.0083333333)^-5]

We already computed this as approximately $761.67.

Therefore, the monthly payment is approximately $761.67.

But let me check once more with precise computation.

Compute denominator: 1 - (1.0083333333)^-5

We can compute (1.0083333333)^5 ≈ 1.042506

So, (1.0083333333)^-5 ≈ 1 / 1.042506 ≈ 0.960074

So, denominator: 1 - 0.960074 ≈ 0.039926

Numerator: 3650 × 0.0083333333 ≈ 30.41666666

So, PMT ≈ 30.41666666 / 0.039926 ≈ 761.67

Yes, that's consistent.

Therefore, the precise monthly payment is approximately $761.67.

Therefore, the answer is approximately $761.67 per month.

But the problem didn't specify to round to the nearest cent, so perhaps it's fine to leave it at that.

Alternatively, if we use more precise decimal places, it might be $761.67, but let me check.

Wait, 30.41666666 ÷ 0.039926 ≈ 761.67

Yes, so $761.67 per month.

Therefore, Karan has to pay approximately $761.67 each month.

But wait, in the initial simple interest approach, it was $760.42 per month.

So, depending on the method, the answer varies between approximately $760.42 and $761.67.

Given the problem says she has to pay an equal amount every month, it's more accurate to use the amortization method, resulting in approximately $761.67 per month.

But the difference is only about $1.25, which might be due to rounding in intermediate steps.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the simple interest approach.

Given the problem doesn't specify, but since it mentions "equal amount every month," which is a characteristic of an amortized loan, it's more appropriate to use the amortization method.

Thus, the monthly payment is approximately $761.67.

But let me compute the exact value without rounding too much.

Compute PMT = (3650 × 0.0083333333 × (1 + 0.0083333333)^5) / ((1 + 0.0083333333)^5 - 1)

So, numerator:

3650 × 0.0083333333 = 30.41666666

30.41666666 × 1.042506 ≈ 30.41666666 × 1.042506 ≈ 31.72945

Denominator: 1.042506 - 1 = 0.042506

So, PMT ≈ 31.72945 / 0.042506 ≈ 745.00

Wait, now I'm confused, because earlier using the annuity formula, we had PMT ≈ 761.67, but this calculation is showing PMT ≈ 745.00.

Wait, no, that can't be. There must be a miscalculation.

Wait, let me clarify.

In the annuity formula, it's:

PMT = PV × r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)

Which is 3650 × 0.0083333333 / (1 - 1.0083333333^-5)

Which is 30.41666666 / (1 - 0.960074) ≈ 30.41666666 / 0.039926 ≈ 761.67

But in the previous step, I used a different formula, which was:

PMT = [ P × r × (1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ]

Which is same as:

PMT = (P × r × (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 )

Which is same as:

PMT = (P × r × FV Factor ) / ( FV Factor - 1 )

Which is same as:

PMT = PV × r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n )

Yes, so it's the same formula.

So, PMT ≈ 761.67.

But when I computed the monthly payment as $745, that was with a different formula, which is for the total amount paid, not the monthly payment.

Therefore, the correct monthly payment is approximately $761.67.

Thus, Karan has to pay approximately $761.67 each month.

But let me check the precise calculation.

Compute 3650 × 0.0083333333 × 1.042506 / (1.042506 - 1)

Compute numerator:

3650 × 0.0083333333 ≈ 30.41666666

30.41666666 × 1.042506 ≈ 30.41666666 × 1.042506

Compute 30.41666666 × 1 = 30.41666666

30.41666666 × 0.04 = 1.216666666

30.41666666 × 0.002506 ≈ 0.076333333

So, total ≈ 30.41666666 + 1.216666666 + 0.076333333 ≈ 31.70966665

Denominator: 1.042506 - 1 = 0.042506

So, PMT ≈ 31.70966665 / 0.042506 ≈ 745.00

Wait, that brings us back to 745.00.

But wait, that contradicts the earlier result.

Wait, I'm using two different formulas but getting different results.

Wait, no, actually, in the first formula, PMT = PV × r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n ), which is 3650 × 0.0083333333 / (1 - 0.960074 ) ≈ 761.67

In the second formula, PMT = (P × r × (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 )

Which is (3650 × 0.0083333333 × 1.042506 ) / (1.042506 - 1 ) ≈ (30.41666666 × 1.042506 ) / 0.042506 ≈ 31.70966665 / 0.042506 ≈ 745.00

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, no, let's clarify.

The formula PMT = PV × r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) is correct.

But when I try to compute it as:

( P × r × (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 )

This is actually equal to PMT.

Wait, but in that case, it's:

PMT = (3650 × 0.0083333333 × 1.042506 ) / ( 1.042506 - 1 ) ≈ 31.70966665 / 0.042506 ≈ 745.00

But that's different from the other formula.

Wait, but if PMT is 745.00, then total payments would be 745 × 5 = 3725, which is higher than the principal plus interest.

Wait, principal is 3650, total interest is 152.08, so total amount is 3802.08.

But 745 × 5 = 3725, which is less than 3802.08, which is inconsistent.

Wait, that suggests that PMT is not 745.00.

Wait, so maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I have a misunderstanding.

Wait, let me clarify the formula.

The correct formula for the monthly payment is:

PMT = ( P × r × (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 )

But in this case, P is the principal, which is 3650.

r is the monthly interest rate, which is 0.10 / 12 ≈ 0.0083333333.

n is the number of periods, which is 5.

So, plug in:

PMT = (3650 × 0.0083333333 × (1 + 0.0083333333)^5 ) / ( (1 + 0.0083333333)^5 - 1 )

Which is same as:

PMT = (3650 × 0.0083333333 × 1.042506 ) / (1.042506 - 1 )

Compute numerator:

3650 × 0.0083333333 ≈ 30.41666666

30.41666666 × 1.042506 ≈ 31.70966665

Denominator: 0.042506

So, PMT ≈ 31.70966665 / 0.042506 ≈ 745.00

But as we saw, this gives a total payment of 745 × 5 = 3725, which is less than the principal plus interest.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the formula is correct, but in reality, when you have an annuity, the present value of all payments equals the principal.

So, let's check:

PV = PMT × [ 1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

So, PV = 745 × [ 1 - (1.0083333333)^-5 ] / 0.0083333333

Compute (1.0083333333)^-5 ≈ 0.960074

So,

PV ≈ 745 × [ 1 - 0.960074 ] / 0.0083333333 ≈ 745 × 0.039926 / 0.0083333333 ≈ 745 × 4.79112 ≈ 745 × 4.79112

Compute 700 × 4.79112 ≈ 3353.784

45 × 4.79112 ≈ 215.599

Total ≈ 3353.784 + 215.599 ≈ 3569.383

Which is approximately equal to the principal of 3650, but not exact.

Wait, that suggests that with PMT = 745, the present value is approximately 3569.38, which is less than 3650.

Therefore, to get the correct PMT, it needs to be slightly higher to make the present value equal to 3650.

Therefore, the PMT should be around $761.67, as we calculated earlier.

Wait, let's compute PV with PMT = 761.67.

PV = 761.67 × [1 - (1.0083333333)^-5 ] / 0.0083333333

≈ 761.67 × [1 - 0.960074 ] / 0.0083333333

≈ 761.67 × 0.039926 / 0.0083333333

≈ 761.67 × 4.79112 ≈ ?

Compute 700 × 4.79112 ≈ 3353.784

61.67 × 4.79112 ≈ approx 61.67 × 4.79 ≈ 295.51

Total PV ≈ 3353.784 + 295.51 ≈ 3649.29

Which is very close to 3650.

Therefore, PMT ≈ $761.67 makes the present value equal to 3650.

Therefore, the correct monthly payment is approximately $761.67.

Therefore, Karan has to pay approximately $761.67 each month.

But in the initial simple interest approach, it was approximately $760.42.

But the correct approach, considering the equal principal reduction over the period, is the amortized loan method, so the payment should be approximately $761.67.

Therefore, the answer is approximately $761.67 per month.

But since the question didn't specify whether it wants the exact amount or an approximate, and given the context, maybe it's expecting the simple interest method.

But perhaps I need to verify.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting simple interest.

Wait, the problem says, "She has to pay an equal amount every month. How much does she have to pay per month?"

Given that, it's ambiguous, but since it's a standard loan, it's more likely to be the amortized loan.

But in any case, since $761.67 is the exact amount using the annuity formula, and $760.42 is the simple interest, I think the correct answer is $761.67.

But since in the initial calculation with the simple interest, the total amount is $3802.08, which divided by 5 is $760.42.

Therefore, depending on the method, it's either $760.42 or $761.67.

Given that, perhaps the question is expecting the simple interest approach, as it's more straightforward and the term "equal amount every month" could refer to equal principal each month, which is different from equal payments.

Wait, hold on, maybe it's equal principal each month, not equal payments.

Wait, that could be another interpretation.

If she has to pay equal principal every month, then each month, she pays 3650 / 5 = 730.

Then, the interest for each month is on the remaining balance.

So, let's compute that.

First month:

Principal payment: 730

Remaining principal: 3650 - 730 = 2920

Interest: 2920 × 0.10 / 12 ≈ 2920 × 0.00833333 ≈ 24.3333

Total payment: 730 + 24.3333 ≈ 754.33

Second month:

Principal payment: 730

Remaining principal: 2920 - 730 = 2190

Interest: 2190 × 0.00833333 ≈ 18.25

Total payment: 730 + 18.25 ≈ 748.25

Third month:

Principal payment: 730

Remaining principal: 2190 - 730 = 1460

Interest: 1460 × 0.00833333 ≈ 12.16666

Total payment: 730 + 12.16666 ≈ 742.16666

Fourth month:

Principal payment: 730

Remaining principal: 1460 - 730 = 730

Interest: 730 × 0.00833333 ≈ 6.08333

Total payment: 730 + 6.08333 ≈ 736.08333

Fifth month:

Principal payment: 730

Remaining principal: 730 - 730 = 0

Interest: 0

Total payment: 730

So, payments are:

1: ≈754.33

2: ≈748.25

3: ≈742.17

4: ≈736.08

5: 730

So, the payments are decreasing each month due to decreasing principal.

Therefore, if "equal amount every month" refers to equal principal payments, then the monthly payments are decreasing, starting from $754.33 and going down to $730.

But the problem says "she has to pay an equal amount every month," which could mean equal in value, but in this case, it's not equal.

Alternatively, if it means equal installments (equal payments), which would be the case of an amortized loan, resulting in monthly payments of approximately $761.67.

Therefore, given the ambiguity, but considering that in most loans, it's the amortized loan, the payment is $761.67.

But to be precise, let's check if the total of these decreasing payments equals the total amount with interest.

Compute total amount paid:

754.33 + 748.25 + 742.17 + 736.08 + 730 ≈

754.33 + 748.25 = 1502.58

1502.58 + 742.17 = 2244.75

2244.75 + 736.08 = 2980.83

2980.83 + 730 = 3710.83

So, total amount paid is $3710.83.

Principal is $3650, so total interest is $3710.83 - $3650 = $60.83.

Which is less than the simple interest of $152.08.

Wait, that can't be. Because the simple interest is $152.08, but in the principal equal payment method, the total interest is only $60.83.

Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, that suggests that the principal equal payment method actually results in less total interest, which can't be right because it's supposed to be an amortized loan with higher interest.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, in the principal equal payment method, each payment is equal principal plus interest on the remaining balance.

Wait, but in my calculation, I assumed equal principal payments, but in reality, equal principal payments would mean each month, she pays 730, so the interest each month is calculated on decreasing balance.

But in the way I computed, the total interest is only $60.83, which is way less than the simple interest.

But that's because in the principal equal payment method, the interest is only on the remaining balance.

Wait, but in reality, the interest should be higher than simple interest.

Wait, let's compute the interest properly.

First month:

Principal at start: 3650

Interest: 3650 × 0.00833333 ≈ 30.41666666

Payment: 730

Principal paid: 730 - 30.41666666 ≈ 699.5833333

Remaining principal: 3650 - 699.5833333 ≈ 2950.4166667

Second month:

Interest: 2950.4166667 × 0.00833333 ≈ 24.58680556

Payment: 730

Principal paid: 730 - 24.58680556 ≈ 705.4131944

Remaining principal: 2950.4166667 - 705.4131944 ≈ 2245.0034723

Third month:

Interest: 2245.0034723 × 0.00833333 ≈ 18.70836227

Payment: 730

Principal paid: 730 - 18.70836227 ≈ 711.2916377

Remaining principal: 2245.0034723 - 711.2916377 ≈ 1533.7118346

Fourth month:

Interest: 1533.7118346 × 0.00833333 ≈ 12.78093195

Payment: 730

Principal paid: 730 - 12.78093195 ≈ 717.219068

Remaining principal: 1533.7118346 - 717.219068 ≈ 816.4927666

Fifth month:

Interest: 816.4927666 × 0.00833333 ≈ 6.804106388

Payment: 730

Principal paid: 730 - 6.804106388 ≈ 723.1958936

Remaining principal: 816.4927666 - 723.1958936 ≈ 93.296873

Wait, that's not zero. So, in the fifth month, she still owes $93.296873.

So, in this case, she needs to pay an extra $93.296873 in the fifth month to clear the loan.

Therefore, total payments:

First four months: 730 each

Fifth month: 730 + 93.296873 ≈ 823.296873

Therefore, total amount paid:

730 × 4 + 823.296873 ≈ 2920 + 823.296873 ≈ 3743.296873

Total interest paid: 3743.296873 - 3650 ≈ 93.296873

But in reality, the interest should be $152.08 as per simple interest.

Therefore, this method gives a different result.

Therefore, the principal equal payment method (paying equal principal each month) results in less total interest, which is inconsistent with the simple interest calculation.

Therefore, the problem must be referring to an amortized loan where each payment is equal in value.

Therefore, the correct monthly payment is approximately $761.67.

Therefore, Karan has to pay approximately $761.67 each month.

But let me compute the exact amount.

We can use the PMT formula more accurately.

Compute (1 + r)^n = (1 + 0.0083333333)^5

Calculate step by step:

1.0083333333^1 = 1.0083333333

1.0083333333^2 = 1.0083333333 × 1.0083333333 ≈ 1.0167361111

1.0083333333^3 ≈ 1.0167361111 × 1.0083333333 ≈ 1.0252166666

1.0083333333^4 ≈ 1.0252166666 × 1.0083333333 ≈ 1.0337736111

1.0083333333^5 ≈ 1.0337736111 × 1.0083333333 ≈ 1.042506

So, as before.

Now, compute numerator: 3650 × 0.0083333333 ≈ 30.41666666

Denominator: 1.042506 - 1 = 0.042506

Therefore, PMT ≈ 30.41666666 / 0.042506 ≈ 716.16

Wait, that doesn't align with earlier.

Wait, no, the formula is:

PMT = (P × r × (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 )

So, plug in:

P = 3650

r = 0.0083333333

(1 + r)^n = 1.042506

Therefore,

PMT = (3650 × 0.0083333333 × 1.042506 ) / (1.042506 - 1 )

Compute numerator:

3650 × 0.0083333333 ≈ 30.41666666

30.41666666 × 1.042506 ≈ 31.70966665

Denominator: 1.042506 - 1 = 0.042506

So, PMT ≈ 31.70966665 / 0.042506 ≈ 745.00

Therefore, PMT ≈ 745.00

But this is inconsistent with the earlier result where I got PMT ≈ 761.67.

Wait, perhaps confusion between two different formulas.

Wait, PMT = PV × r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) is correct for present value.

Alternatively, PMT = (P × r × (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) is also correct.

But in the first case, PMT was 761.67, and in the second, PMT was 745.00.

Wait, I think the confusion arises because of the two different ways of calculating the payment.

Wait, in reality, the two formulas are equivalent.

Wait, let me see:

PV = PMT × [ 1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

Which is same as:

PMT = PV × r / [ 1 - (1 + r)^-n ]

Alternatively,

PMT = (P × r × (1 + r)^n ) / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ]

But that would be if P is the principal.

Wait, but in our case, PV is the present value, which is the principal. So, PV = 3650.

So, PMT = PV × r / [ 1 - (1 + r)^-n ] = 3650 × 0.0083333333 / [ 1 - 1.0083333333^-5 ] ≈ 30.41666666 / (1 - 0.960074 ) ≈ 30.41666666 / 0.039926 ≈ 761.67

Alternatively, PMT = (P × r × (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) = (3650 × 0.0083333333 × 1.042506 ) / (1.042506 - 1 ) ≈ (30.41666666 × 1.042506 ) / 0.042506 ≈ (31.70966665 ) / 0.042506 ≈ 745.00

But which one is correct?

Wait, in the first formula, PMT = PV × r / [ 1 - (1 + r)^-n ], which is correct.

In the second formula, PMT = (P × r × (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ), which is correct when P is the principal.

But in our case, PV is the present value, which is the principal.

Therefore, both formulas should give the same result.

Wait, let's compute both:

PV formula:

PMT = PV × r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) ≈ 3650 × 0.0083333333 / (1 - 0.960074 ) ≈ 30.41666666 / 0.039926 ≈ 761.67

PMT formula:

PMT = (PV × r × (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) ≈ (3650 × 0.0083333333 × 1.042506 ) / (1.042506 - 1 ) ≈ (31.70966665 ) / 0.042506 ≈ 745.00

But 761.67 ≠ 745.00. Therefore, either I made a mistake, or the formulas are not equivalent.

Wait, no, actually, in the PMT formula, it's (P × r × (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 )

But P is the principal, which is same as PV.

Wait, so PV = P, so both formulas should give the same result.

But 761.67 ≠ 745.00.

Wait, there must be a miscalculation.

Wait, compute denominator:

(1 + r)^n - 1 = 1.042506 - 1 = 0.042506

Numerator: PV × r × (1 + r)^n = 3650 × 0.0083333333 × 1.042506 ≈ 3650 × 0.008770833 ≈ 3650 × 0.008770833 ≈ 3650 × 0.008 = 29.2, 3650 × 0.000770833 ≈ 2.816666665

So, total numerator ≈ 29.2 + 2.816666665 ≈ 32.016666665

Therefore, PMT ≈ 32.016666665 / 0.042506 ≈ 752.00

Wait, that's approximately 752.00, which is closer to 761.67.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, 3650 × 0.0083333333 × 1.042506

First, 3650 × 0.0083333333 ≈ 30.41666666

Then, 30.41666666 × 1.042506

Compute 30.41666666 × 1 = 30.41666666

30.41666666 × 0.042506 ≈ 1.294429166

Total ≈ 30.41666666 + 1.294429166 ≈ 31.71109583

Therefore, numerator ≈ 31.71109583

Thus, PMT ≈ 31.71109583 / 0.042506 ≈ 745.00

But in the other formula, PMT ≈ 761.67

Wait, so now, I'm really confused. Let's think.

Wait, perhaps due to the way the formula is applied.

Wait, actually, the correct formula is PMT = PV × r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n )

Which is 3650 × 0.0083333333 / (1 - 0.960074 ) ≈ 30.41666666 / 0.039926 ≈ 761.67

Alternatively, perhaps the formula (P × r × (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) is for calculating PMT when the principal is unknown, but here we have PV, so I think the first formula is correct.

Therefore, PMT ≈ $761.67

Therefore, Karan has to pay approximately $761.67 each month.

Therefore, after all this, I think the correct answer is approximately $761.67.

But since the problem didn't specify the method, but given that in the initial simple interest approach, it's $760.42, and with the correct amortized loan formula, it's approximately $761.67, which is very close, so either way, it's approximately $761.67.

Therefore, rounding to two decimal places, it's $761.67.

But in the problem, the interest rate is 10%, which is a round number, and the time is 5 months, which is a fraction of a year, so perhaps the answer is expected to be in whole dollars.

Therefore, maybe $762.

But in the initial simple interest approach, it's approximately $760.42, which is about $760.

But in the amortized loan, it's approximately $761.67, which is about $762.

Therefore, depending on the method, it's either $760 or $762.

But in reality, the exact amount is approximately $761.67.

But since the problem didn't specify, but considering that it's a formal loan, the correct approach is the amortized loan, so $761.67.

Therefore, Karan has to pay approximately $761.67 each month.

**Final Answer**
Karan has to pay each month an amount of \boxed{761.67} dollars.
</think>

Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an annual interest rate of 10%. She has to pay an equal amount every month. 

First, we need to determine the total amount to be paid, which includes the principal and the interest. The interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula or the amortized loan method. 

Using the simple interest formula:
\[ \text{Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where \( P = 3650 \), \( r = 0.10 \) (annual rate), and \( t = \frac{5}{12} \) (time in years).

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \approx 152.08 \]

The total amount to be paid is:
\[ 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Dividing this total by the number of months (5) gives the monthly payment:
\[ \frac{3802.08}{5} \approx 760.42 \]

However, using the amortized loan method (annuity formula), the monthly payment is calculated as:
\[ \text{PMT} = \frac{PV \times r \times (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1} \]
where \( PV = 3650 \), \( r = 0.0083333333 \) (monthly rate), and \( n = 5 \).

\[ \text{PMT} = \frac{3650 \times 0.0083333333 \times (1 + 0.0083333333)^5}{(1 + 0.0083333333)^5 - 1} \approx 761.67 \]

Thus, Karan has to pay each month an amount of \boxed{761.67} dollars.
