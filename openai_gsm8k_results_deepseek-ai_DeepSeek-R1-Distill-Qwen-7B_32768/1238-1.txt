Question:
Sasha and Julie are best friends playing on opposing basketball teams. The teams have two practice games scheduled. In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. Sasha always struggles during away games and their second match was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. How many total points did Sasha score during both games?

Correct Answer:
In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points, and Julie scored four fewer points: 14-4 = <<14-4=10>>10 points.
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 points fewer than Julie's score in the first game, meaning she scored 10-6=<<10-6=4>>4 points.
Sasha scored 10+4=<<10+4=14>>14 points in the two games.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem about Sasha and Julie playing basketball. They're on opposing teams with two practice games. I need to figure out how many total points Sasha scored in both games. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that in the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. That seems straightforward. So, for Game 1, Sasha's score is 14 points. Let me write that down:

Game 1:
- Sasha: 14 points

Now, it says Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. So, if Sasha scored 14 points, Julie must have scored 14 - 4 points. Let me calculate that:

Julie's score in Game 1 = 14 - 4 = 10 points.

So, Game 1:
- Sasha: 14
- Julie: 10

Alright, that's the first game done. Now, the second game was at Julie's home court. Hmm, the problem mentions that Sasha struggles during away games. So, in the second game, which was away for Sasha, she scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game.

Wait, so I need to figure out Julie's score in the first game first, which I already did—she scored 10 points. Then, in the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than that. Let me write that down.

First, Julie's score in Game 1: 10 points.

Then, Sasha's score in Game 2 = Julie's score in Game 1 - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4 points.

So, Game 2:
- Sasha: 4 points
- Julie: Well, the problem doesn't specify how much Julie scored in the second game, so I don't need that for the total points of Sasha.

But just to make sure I'm understanding correctly, the problem is only asking for Sasha's total points across both games, so maybe I don't need to calculate Julie's second game score. Let me check.

Yes, the question is only about Sasha's total points, so I just need to add her scores from both games.

So, Game 1: 14 points
Game 2: 4 points

Total points for Sasha = 14 + 4.

Let me calculate that:

14 + 4 = 18.

So, Sasha scored a total of 18 points in both games.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Because sometimes, when problems mention things like "home court advantage" or "struggles during away games," they might refer to more than just the score difference. But in this case, the problem specifically says in the first game, Sasha scored 14, and Julie scored 4 fewer in the same game. Then, in the second game, which was away for Sasha, she scored 6 fewer points than Julie's first game score.

So, let's reiterate:

Game 1:
- Sasha: 14
- Julie: 14 - 4 = 10

Game 2:
- Sasha: 10 - 6 = 4 (since she scored 6 fewer than Julie's first game score)

Adding Sasha's scores: 14 + 4 = 18.

I think that's correct. Just to ensure, let's think about it another way. If I were to represent this with variables, maybe that would help.

Let me assign variables to each game.

Let S1 be Sasha's score in Game 1, which is 14.

J1 be Julie's score in Game 1.

We know that J1 = S1 - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10.

Then, in Game 2, let S2 be Sasha's score, which is 6 fewer than J1. So, S2 = J1 - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4.

Therefore, total for Sasha is S1 + S2 = 14 + 4 = 18.

Yep, same result. It seems consistent.

I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just think if there's another way to interpret the problem. For example, sometimes in these problems, the "home court advantage" might imply something else, like maybe the point difference or something. But in this case, it's straightforward—they just gave the points Sasha scored. So, I think it's safe.

Alternatively, if I were to visualize this, maybe draw a table:

| Player | Game 1 | Game 2 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Sasha  | 14     | ?      |
| Julie  | 10     | ?      |

And the problem says that in Game 2, Sasha scored 6 fewer than Julie's Game 1 score. So, Julie's Game 1 score is 10, so Sasha's Game 2 is 10 - 6 = 4. Then, adding her Game 1 and Game 2: 14 + 4 = 18.

Alternatively, maybe I can write equations:

Let S1 = 14

J1 = S1 - 4 = 10

S2 = J1 - 6 = 4

Total S = S1 + S2 = 14 + 4 = 18

Yes, that's consistent.

Wait, just to make sure, sometimes in basketball, the scoring can be affected by other factors, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It's just straightforward points.

So, I think 18 is the correct answer. Let me just write it as per the instructions.

**Final Answer**
The total points Sasha scored during both games is \boxed{18}.
</think>

Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game, so Julie scored 10 points. In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Therefore, Sasha scored 4 points in the second game. Adding her scores from both games, we get:

\[
14 + 4 = 18
\]

The total points Sasha scored during both games is \boxed{18}.
