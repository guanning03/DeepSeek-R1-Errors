Question:
Maggie spent a quarter of her money, while Riza spent one-third of her money. They each had $60. How much money do the two of them have left?

Correct Answer:
Maggie spent $60/4 = $<<60/4=15>>15.
So, Maggie is left with $60 - $15 = $<<60-15=45>>45.
Riza spent $60/3 = $<<60/3=20>>20.
So, Riza is left with $60 - $20 = $<<60-20=40>>40.
Thus, they have a total of $45 + $40 = $<<45+40=85>>85 left.
#### 85

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where Maggie and Riza each spent some of their money, and now they both have $60 left. I need to figure out how much money they had originally and then find the total they have left. Wait, hold on, the question says they each had $60 left after spending, so that means together they have $120? Hmm, no, maybe not, because when they spend money, they might have different amounts originally. Let me think.

First, let's break it down. The problem says Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she has three-quarters left. Riza spent one-third of her money, so she has two-thirds left. After spending, both of them have $60. That means $60 is three-quarters of Maggie's original money, and $60 is two-thirds of Riza's original money. So I need to find out how much each of them had originally and then add those together? Wait, no, the question is asking how much money the two of them have left. But wait, they each have $60 left, so together they have $120? Wait, that seems straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something.

But let me make sure. If they each spent a portion of their money and ended up with $60 each, then yes, together they have $120. But maybe the problem is trying to trick me into thinking they have combined $60, but no, the wording says "they each had $60," so it's $60 each, so total is $120. But that seems too easy, so perhaps I should verify.

Let me approach it step by step. Let's denote the original amount of money that Maggie had as M, and the original amount Riza had as R.

After spending, Maggie has three-quarters of M left, which is equal to $60. So, (3/4)M = 60. To find M, we can solve for it:

Multiply both sides by (4/3):

M = 60 * (4/3) = 80.

So, Maggie originally had $80.

Similarly, for Riza, she spent one-third of her money, so she has two-thirds left, which is also $60. So, (2/3)R = 60. Solving for R:

Multiply both sides by (3/2):

R = 60 * (3/2) = 90.

So, Riza originally had $90.

Therefore, the total amount they had together originally was M + R = 80 + 90 = $170.

But the question is asking how much money do the two of them have left? After their spending, they each have $60, so together they have 60 + 60 = $120.

Wait, so is that the answer? $120. Hmm, but let me double-check.

Maggie had $80, spent a quarter, which is $20, so she has $60 left. Riza had $90, spent one-third, which is $30, so she has $60 left. Yeah, that adds up. So together, they have $120 left.

But hold on, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick question where it says "how much money do the two of them have left," and since each has $60, it's just $120. So, that seems to be the case.

But just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she has 3/4 left, which is $60. So, 3/4 M = 60 => M = 80. Correct.

Riza spent one-third of her money, so she has 2/3 left, which is $60. So, 2/3 R = 60 => R = 90. Correct.

So, they each have $60 left, so total is $120. So, the answer is $120.

But wait, just to make sure, I'll think about it another way. If I didn't notice that each had $60 left individually, but maybe someone might think that together they have $60, but that interpretation doesn't make much sense because the problem says "they each had $60." So, it's definitely each of them has $60, so total is $120.

Alternatively, someone might think that the total amount they had left combined is $60, but that would be incorrect because the problem says each had $60, so they have $60 each.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is $120.

Wait, but to make sure, let's go through the problem again.

"Maggie spent a quarter of her money, while Riza spent one-third of her money. They each had $60. How much money do the two of them have left?"

So, they each have $60 left, so together $120. So, yes, that's the answer.

I think I've thought this through enough. The answer is $120.

**Final Answer**
The two of them have a total of \boxed{120} dollars left.
</think>

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she has three-quarters left. Riza spent one-third of her money, so she has two-thirds left. Both have $60 left after spending.

For Maggie:
- Let \( M \) be the original amount of money she had.
- She has three-quarters left, which is $60.
- \(\frac{3}{4}M = 60\)
- Solving for \( M \):
  \[
  M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
  \]
- So, Maggie originally had $80.

For Riza:
- Let \( R \) be the original amount of money she had.
- She has two-thirds left, which is $60.
- \(\frac{2}{3}R = 60\)
- Solving for \( R \):
  \[
  R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
  \]
- So, Riza originally had $90.

After spending, each of them has $60 left. Therefore, together they have:
- \( 60 + 60 = 120 \)

\[
\boxed{120}
\]
