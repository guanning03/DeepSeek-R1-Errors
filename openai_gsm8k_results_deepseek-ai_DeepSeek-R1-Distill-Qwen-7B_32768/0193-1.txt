Question:
Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?

Correct Answer:
When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.
Thus it has been 31 - 17 = <<31-17=14>>14 years since Raymond's son was born.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Alright, let's break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says Raymond and Samantha are cousins, and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Hmm, so that means if Samantha is now 31, Raymond must be 31 minus 6, right? Let me write that down to make sure. 

Samantha's age now: 31 years. 

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond's age now is 31 - 6 = 25 years. 

Alright, so Raymond is 25 years old now. Next, it says Raymond had a son at the age of 23. So, how old was his son now? Well, if Raymond is 25 and he had the son when he was 23, that means his son is now 25 - 23 = 2 years old. 

Wait, hold on. If the son is 2 years old now, and Samantha is 31, how many years ago was the son born? Since the son is 2, he must have been born two years ago. 

Let me just ensure I didn't mix up any ages here. 

Raymond is 25, so he had his son when he was 23. That means the son is 25 - 23 = 2. Since the son is 2 now, he was born two years ago. 

Yeah, that seems correct. So, the son was born two years ago. 

Wait a second, another way to think about it: 

If Samantha is 31, and she's a cousin to Raymond, who is 25. So, cousins are typically the same age, right? So, if Samantha is 31, Raymond is 25 because he was born 6 years before her. 

Raymond had a son at 23, so the son is now 25 - 23 = 2. Thus, the son is 2 years old, meaning he was born two years ago. 

Yeah, that all checks out. So, the answer should be 2 years ago. 

**Final Answer**
The son was born \boxed{2} years ago.
</think>

Raymond and Samantha are cousins, and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Samantha is now 31 years old, so Raymond is \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old. 

Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so the son's current age is \(25 - 23 = 2\) years. Therefore, the son was born 2 years ago.

\[
\boxed{2}
