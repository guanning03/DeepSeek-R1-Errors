Question:
Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. They also went on 2 different rides which costs $33 for each ride. If they agreed to split all the costs evenly, how much did each of them pay?

Correct Answer:
They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.
They spent $33 x 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66 for the rides.
They spent a total of $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.
So each of them paid $102/3 = $<<102/3=34>>34.
#### 34

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the total cost of the tickets by multiplying the number of tickets by the cost per ticket: 3 tickets × $20.25 = $60.75.

Next, I'll determine the amount spent on food by subtracting $4.50 from the ticket cost: $60.75 - $4.50 = $56.25.

Then, I'll calculate the total cost of the rides by multiplying the number of rides by the cost per ride: 2 rides × $33 = $66.

After that, I'll sum up all the expenses: tickets ($60.75) + food ($56.25) + rides ($66) = $183.

Finally, I'll divide the total cost by the number of friends to find out how much each person paid: $183 ÷ 3 = $61.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how much each of the three friends paid in total.

1. **Cost of Tickets:**
   - **Number of Tickets:** 3
   - **Cost per Ticket:** \$20.25
   - **Total Cost for Tickets:** 
     \[
     3 \times \$20.25 = \$60.75
     \]

2. **Cost of Food:**
   - **Amount Saved on Food:** \$4.50
   - **Total Cost for Food:** 
     \[
     \$60.75 - \$4.50 = \$56.25
     \]

3. **Cost of Rides:**
   - **Number of Rides:** 2
   - **Cost per Ride:** \$33
   - **Total Cost for Rides:** 
     \[
     2 \times \$33 = \$66
     \]

4. **Total Expenses:**
   - **Total Cost for Tickets:** \$60.75
   - **Total Cost for Food:** \$56.25
   - **Total Cost for Rides:** \$66
   - **Overall Total Cost:** 
     \[
     \$60.75 + \$56.25 + \$66 = \$183
     \]

5. **Cost per Friend:**
   - **Number of Friends:** 3
   - **Amount Each Friend Pays:** 
     \[
     \frac{\$183}{3} = \$61
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{61}
\]
