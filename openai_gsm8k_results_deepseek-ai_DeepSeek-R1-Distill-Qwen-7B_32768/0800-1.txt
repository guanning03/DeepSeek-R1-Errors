Question:
James has 30 teeth. His dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. What percentage of James' teeth does the dentist fix?

Correct Answer:
First find the total number of teeth the dentist caps: 4 teeth + 7 teeth = <<4+7=11>>11 teeth
Then find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes: 11 teeth + 4 teeth = <<11+4=15>>15 teeth
Then divide that number by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of teeth he fixes: 15 teeth / 30 teeth * 100% = 50%

Wrong Answer:
Okay, let's see. So, the problem is about James and his dentist. James has 30 teeth in total. The dentist drills 4 of them and then caps 7 more teeth than he drills. We need to find out what percentage of James' teeth the dentist fixes. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many teeth the dentist drills. The problem says the dentist drills 4 teeth. So, that's straightforward. Drilling teeth is one part of the process. Now, after drilling, the dentist caps more teeth. It says he caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, if he drilled 4 teeth, then the number of teeth he caps is 4 plus 7, which is 11 teeth. Let me write that down: 4 drilled, 11 capped.

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes. Hmm, okay. So, does that mean the percentage of teeth that are either drilled or capped? Or is it specifically about the capped teeth? The wording says, "denti fixes," so I think it might refer to the teeth that are fixed, which would be the ones that are capped. Because drilling is more like removing the decay, but fixing might mean putting caps on them to prevent further decay. So, perhaps only the capped teeth are considered fixed.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me read the problem again: "James has 30 teeth. His dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. What percentage of James' teeth does the dentist fix?" So, the dentist does two things: drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than he drills. So, 4 + 7 is 11 teeth. So, does that mean that 11 teeth are fixed? Or is "fixing" a different action?

Wait, maybe "fixes" refers to both drilling and capping. Because "fixes" can sometimes mean both removing and covering. Hmm, but in the context of dentistry, when a dentist drills a tooth, they remove the decayed part, and then when they cap it, they seal it to prevent further decay. So, perhaps both drilling and capping are part of the fixing process.

But the problem says "denti fixes," which is singular. Wait, no, it's plural: "dentist" and "teeth." Hmm, maybe "fixes" refers to the action of fixing the problem with decay. So, if he both drills and caps, then both actions are fixing the teeth.

But in the problem, the dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more. So, in total, he's fixed 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. Then, out of James' 30 teeth, 11 are fixed. So, to find the percentage, we can calculate (11/30)*100.

Wait, but let me think again. Does "fixes" mean only the capping? Because drilling is not really fixing the tooth, it's more like extracting decay. Fixing might refer to sealing it with a cap to prevent further decay. So, perhaps only the capping is considered fixing the teeth. So, out of 30 teeth, 7 are capped, so fixing 7 teeth.

Hmm, now I'm confused. The problem isn't entirely clear on whether drilling counts as fixing or not. Let's see the exact wording: "denti fixes." Since the dentist does two actions: drilling and capping. It says the dentist drills 4 and caps 7 more. So, if we take "fixes" as both actions, then it's 11 teeth. If "fixes" is only capping, then it's 7 teeth.

Wait, maybe I need to interpret the problem again. It says, "the dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills." So, the number of capped teeth is 7 more than the number of drilled teeth. So, if he drilled 4, he capped 4 + 7 = 11. So, the total number of teeth fixed is 11, as both drilling and capping are part of the fixing process.

Alternatively, if "fixes" is only the capping, then it's 11 teeth. Wait, but capping 7 more than he drilled, which is 11, but that seems like a lot. Wait, 7 more than the 4 he drilled, so 4 + 7 = 11. So, perhaps he capped 11 teeth.

But 11 seems like a lot for a dentist to cap in a single visit, but in the problem's context, it's just a number, so maybe it's okay.

Wait, hold on. The problem says " James has 30 teeth. His dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills." So, the number of teeth capped is 7 more than the number drilled. So, if he drilled 4, then he capped 4 + 7 = 11. So, that's 11 teeth that are fixed, assuming fixing includes both drilling and capping.

But, if "fixes" is only the capping, then it's 11 teeth. Hmm, but since he did both drilling and capping, it's possible that both are considered fixing. So, maybe 11 is the number of teeth fixed.

Alternatively, maybe "fixes" only refers to the capping, as drilling is more like removing the decay rather than fixing. So, fixing might mean covering them so they don't decay further. So, in that case, only the capping is considered fixing, so 11 teeth.

But that seems a bit high because 11 out of 30 is over 30%, which might be a lot. Alternatively, if only 7 teeth are fixed, that's about 23%, which is also a significant portion.

Wait, actually, let's read the problem again: "James has 30 teeth. His dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. What percentage of James' teeth does the dentist fix?"

So, he drills 4, and caps 7 more than he drilled, so 4 + 7 = 11. So, in total, he fixed 11 teeth. Therefore, 11 out of 30.

So, I think that is the correct interpretation. So, 11 teeth are fixed, so the percentage is (11/30)*100.

Let me compute that. 11 divided by 30 is equal to approximately 0.366666..., so multiplying by 100 gives approximately 36.666...%. So, rounding to a reasonable decimal place, it's about 36.67%.

Alternatively, if we consider only the capping as fixing, then it's 7 teeth, which is 7/30, which is approximately 23.33%. But in that case, the problem says "caps 7 more teeth than he drills," so the number of capping teeth is 7 more than the number of drilled teeth, which is 4. So, 4 + 7 = 11.

So, I think the correct interpretation is that 11 teeth are fixed, so 11/30 is approximately 36.67%.

Wait, but let's think about it differently. If the dentist drills 4 teeth, that's 4 teeth that are affected. Then, he caps 7 more, so 7 teeth are covered. So, in total, 4 + 7 = 11 teeth are fixed.

Therefore, 11 out of 30. So, 11 divided by 30 is 0.366666..., which is 36.666...%, which is approximately 36.67%.

So, rounding to two decimal places, 36.67%. If we round to the nearest whole number, it's 37%.

But since the question asks for percentage, it might want a fractional answer or a decimal. So, perhaps 36.67% is the answer.

But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the question. The dentist does two things: drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than he drills. So, he caps 11 teeth. So, 11 teeth are fixed. So, the percentage is 11/30.

Alternatively, if fixing meant only the capping, but since capping is 7 more than the number drilled, which is 11, maybe both drilling and capping are considered fixing.

So, I think 11 is the correct number.

Let me do the calculation again: 11 divided by 30.

11 รท 30 = 0.366666...

Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 36.6666...%, which is approximately 36.67%.

Alternatively, 36.666...% can be written as 36 and two-thirds percent.

But since the question says, "what percentage," and doesn't specify rounding, I think either 36.67% or 36.7% is acceptable, or 36 and two-thirds percent.

Wait, but often in exams, they might prefer fractions or decimals. 36.67% is roughly 36.67%, or as a fraction, 11/30 is equal to approximately 0.366666..., so 36.666...%.

Alternatively, 36.67%.

So, I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me just make sure that we're not supposed to consider only the capped teeth as fixed. If fixing means covering the decay, then only the capping is fixing, so 7 teeth. So, 7/30 is approximately 23.33%.

But the problem says, "denti fixes," so dentists fix teeth by drilling and capping. So, both actions are part of fixing. So, I think 11 is correct.

But let's think about the wording: "denti fixes." So, the dentist fixes teeth. How? By drilling and capping. So, in that case, fixing would include both actions. So, 11 teeth are fixed.

Therefore, 11 / 30 is the fraction, which is approximately 36.67%.

Alternatively, maybe "fixes" refers to the number of teeth that are no longer problematic. So, after drilling and capping, the number of teeth that are fixed is 11.

So, I think 36.67% is the correct answer.

Wait, let me also think about the possibility of a misinterpretation. The problem says, "denti fixes," which is plural. So, dentists fix teeth. So, each dentist can fix multiple teeth. So, in this context, fixing a tooth is either drilling it or capping it.

Therefore, the number of teeth fixed is 4 drilled + 7 capped = 11.

So, 11 out of 30.

Therefore, 11 divided by 30 is 0.366666..., which is 36.666...%.

So, rounding to two decimal places, 36.67%.

Alternatively, if we write it as a fraction, it's 11/30, but the question asks for percentage, so decimal or rounded percentage.

Therefore, 36.67% is the answer.

But let me just confirm once more.

Total teeth: 30.

Dentist does: drills 4, caps 7 more than he drills, so 4 + 7 = 11.

Therefore, 11 teeth are fixed.

So, percentage fixed: (11 / 30) * 100 = 36.666...%.

So, approximately 36.67%.

Yes, I think that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 36.67%.

**Final Answer**
The percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is \boxed{36.67\%}.
</think>

James has 30 teeth. His dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. We need to find out what percentage of James' teeth the dentist fixes.

First, we determine the number of teeth the dentist drills, which is 4. The dentist then caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the number of capped teeth is \(4 + 7 = 11\).

Therefore, the total number of teeth fixed (drilled and capped) is 11. To find the percentage of James' teeth that are fixed, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of fixed teeth}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{11}{30} \right) \times 100 \approx 36.67\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is \boxed{36.67\%}.
