Question:
Josh decides to take up juggling to perform at the school talent show a month in the future.  He starts off practicing juggling 3 balls, and slowly gets better adding 1 ball to his juggling act each week.  After the end of the fourth week the talent show begins, but when Josh walks on stage he slips and drops three of his balls.  2 of them are caught by people in the crowd as they roll off the stage, but one gets lost completely since the auditorium is dark.  With a sigh, Josh starts to juggle on stage with how many balls?

Correct Answer:
Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks for a total of 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7
Josh drops 3 balls when he trips on stage leaving him with 7-3= <<7-3=4>>4 balls

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Josh is trying to perform juggling at his school talent show. He starts by practicing with 3 balls. Each week, he adds 1 more ball to his act. That means every week, his number of balls increases by 1. 

Let me break this down step by step. First, when he starts, he has 3 balls. Then, each week, he adds another ball. So, after the first week, he'll have 4 balls, right? Then, the second week, he'll have 5 balls. The third week, 6 balls, and so on.

Now, the talent show starts after the end of the fourth week. Hmm, so let me figure out how many balls he has by the fourth week. Starting at 3, then adding 1 each week for four weeks. Wait, does that mean after week 1, week 2, week 3, and week 4, or does week 4 include the addition? Let me clarify that.

If he starts with 3 balls, then after the first week, he adds 1, so that's 4 balls. After the second week, adding another, so 5 balls. After the third week, 6 balls. And then after the fourth week, he adds yet another, making it 7 balls. So, when the talent show starts, he's supposed to juggle 7 balls. That seems to be the case.

But here's the twist: when he walks on stage, he slips and drops three of his balls. Okay, so he loses 3 balls. Let me subtract that from the total. So, 7 balls minus 3 dropped equals 4 balls remaining.

However, not all of those dropped balls are lost forever. Two of them are caught by people in the crowd as they roll off the stage. So, those 2 balls are retrieved. But one gets lost completely because the auditorium is dark. So, out of the 3 dropped balls, 2 are found, but 1 is lost.

So, let me re-examine the total. He starts with 7 balls. Drops 3, so he has 4 left. Then, 2 are caught, so he gains 2 back. But 1 is lost. So, the total number of balls he has on stage is 4 (remaining) + 2 (caught) - 1 (lost). Wait, actually, that's not quite correct.

Hold on, if he starts with 7 balls, drops 3, so he has 4 left. Then, 2 of those 3 dropped balls are caught. So, he loses 3 but gains back 2. So, effectively, he's down by 1 ball. So, from 7, he lost 1, making it 6? Or is it 4 remaining plus 2 caught, which is 6, and then minus the 1 lost, which would still be 6?

Wait, maybe I need to think of it differently. When he drops 3, he has 7 - 3 = 4 balls left. Then, 2 of those dropped balls are caught, but the third is lost. So, the total number of balls he's handling is the 4 he has left plus the 2 caught, which is 6. But he also lost 1, which is separate from his current count. Hmm, no, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2 caught balls were part of the 3 he dropped. So, he had 7, lost 3, but 2 were caught, so he's still left with 4, which includes the 2 caught? Or does the 2 caught reduce the number of balls he's handling?

Wait, no, the 2 caught are separate. So, he had 7 balls, drops 3, so he has 4. Then, 2 of those 3 dropped are caught, meaning he gains those 2 back, but still has 1 lost. So, the total number of balls he's juggling is still 4, because he only dropped 3, but 2 were caught. So, he has 4, but 1 is lost.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because he had 7, drops 3, so 4 left. Then, 2 of the dropped ones are caught, so he's adding 2 back, so 4 + 2 = 6. But one is lost, so he still has 6 minus 1, which is 5. Hmm, now I'm confused.

Let me parse the problem again: he drops three of his balls—so he loses 3. Then, 2 of them are caught—so he gains 2. Then, one gets lost. So, total loss is 3 - 2 = 1. So, he loses a total of 1 ball. So, starting from 7, he ends up with 7 - 1 = 6 balls.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial 7 minus 3 is 4, then 2 are caught, so 4 + 2 = 6, and the one lost is separate, so he's still only handling 6. Hmm, I think that's the correct way. So, he started with 7, dropped 3, so 4 left. Then, 2 of the dropped ones are caught, so he's back to 6. The one that's lost is gone, so he's only handling 6. So, 6 balls.

Wait, but in the problem, it says 2 of them are caught, but one gets lost. So, in terms of his current number, he has 4, but 2 are caught: So, is he still juggling 4, but 2 have been caught? Or does catching them mean he now has 6?

No, catching them means they are no longer in the air, so he's adding them to the ones he's already juggling. So, if he drops 3, he has 4 left. Then, catching 2 of the dropped balls means he's adding those 2 back into his juggling routine. Thus, he now has 4 + 2 = 6, but one is lost, so he can't add that one. So, total is 6.

Alternatively, if the 2 caught were from the 3 dropped, meaning he's only dropping 1, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no—if he drops 3, and 2 are caught, so 1 is lost. So, he's down by 1.

Therefore, starting with 7, ends with 6. So, he's juggling 6 balls on stage.

Wait, but let me think another way. When you drop 3, you have 4. Then, 2 are caught, so you're back to 6. So, yes, 6.

Alternatively, maybe the 2 caught are from his current juggling, not the dropped ones. Hmm, that might complicate things, but the problem says he drops three of his balls, and then 2 are caught. So, it implies that the 2 caught are the ones he had already dropped. So, he had 7, drops 3, so 4 left. Then, 2 of the dropped 3 are caught, so he now has 4 + 2 = 6. The third is lost, but since it's lost, it's not part of his current juggling. So, he's juggling 6.

Therefore, the answer should be 6.

But wait, let me make sure. So, starting at 3, adding 1 each week for 4 weeks. So, week 1: 4, week 2:5, week3:6, week4:7. So, he's supposed to juggle 7 balls when the show starts.

Then, he drops 3, so 7 -3 =4. Then, 2 are caught, so 4 +2=6. Then, 1 is lost, but he doesn't do anything about it, so he's left with 6.

Alternatively, does the 1 lost affect the count? If he's juggling 6, but 1 is lost, so he's actually handling 6, but one is gone, so he can't juggle that anymore. So, he's juggling 6.

Alternatively, maybe the 1 is lost is not part of his count anymore, so he only has 6.

Yes, I think 6 is the correct answer.

Wait, but hold on a second—when he slips and drops three balls, does that mean he only had 3 balls on stage? No, because he had been building up to 7 over four weeks.

Wait, no. Wait, he had 7 balls before the show, correct? So, he had 7, drops 3, so he's left with 4.

Then, 2 are caught, so he's back to 6.

And 1 is lost, so he's handling 6.

Therefore, Josh is juggling 6 balls when he starts performing.

So, the answer is 6.

But just to be thorough, let me check the timeline.

- Week 0: 3 balls.

- Week 1: 4

- Week 2: 5

- Week 3: 6

- Week 4: 7

Then, at week 4, before the show, he's supposed to juggle 7.

But, during the show, he drops 3.

So, 7 - 3 =4.

Then, 2 of them are caught, so 4 +2=6.

But 1 is lost, so he can't juggle that anymore.

Hence, he's handling 6.

So, yeah, 6 is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the lost ball is subtracted from the total, but since he had 6 after adding 2, maybe 6 -1=5? Wait, no, because the 1 is a separate loss. So, he had 7, drops 3, so 4. Then, 2 of the dropped are caught, so he's adding 2, so 6. The one is a separate loss, but he's still handling 6.

Alternatively, maybe the total number is 6, because he's still juggling 6, even though 1 is lost.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the balls he's actively juggling, so the 6 he's handling, regardless of whether one is lost.

But the problem says, "with a sigh, Josh starts to juggle on stage with how many balls?"

So, it's asking how many balls he starts juggling with, after the slip.

So, he had 7, drops 3, so 4 left. Then, 2 are caught, so 6. So, he starts juggling with 6.

Therefore, the answer is 6.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{6}
</think>

Josh starts off practicing juggling 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he is supposed to juggle 7 balls. However, when he drops 3 balls, 2 of them are caught by people in the crowd, and 1 gets lost. 

1. Josh starts with 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 ball:
   - After Week 1: 4 balls
   - After Week 2: 5 balls
   - After Week 3: 6 balls
   - After Week 4: 7 balls
3. When he drops 3 balls, he has 4 left.
4. 2 of the dropped balls are caught, so he gains 2 balls, making it 6.
5. The remaining 1 ball is lost, but it doesn't affect the count of balls he is juggling.

Thus, Josh starts juggling on stage with 6 balls.

\[
\boxed{6}
