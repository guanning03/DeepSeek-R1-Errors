Question:
Alex is getting ready to attend an event that she has hosted and wants to make sure that she has enough seats for everyone. She invites 100 people via email and each invited person says that they will also invite 2 of their friends. She then calls 10 of her friends to invite them too and 8 of them say they will be bringing their spouses. How many seats will Alex need?

Correct Answer:
Each of the people that were emailed are bringing 2 friends, which means that they will be in groups of 1 +2 = <<1+2=3>>3 people.
Since 100 people were emailed, this creates a total of 3 * 100 = <<3*100=300>>300 people.
Out of her friends, 8 people said that they will be bringing their spouse, so this is a total of 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 people.
Including her own seat, Alex is going to need a total of 300 + 18 +1 = <<300+18+1=319>>319 seats.
#### 319

Wrong Answer:
Okay, let me try to figure out how many seats Alex needs. So, she's hosting an event and wants to make sure there are enough seats for everyone. She invited 100 people via email, and each of those people will invite 2 of their friends. Hmm, that sounds like a chain reaction. Then, she also called 10 of her friends and 8 of them said they'll bring their spouses. I need to add all these up to find the total number of guests.

First, let me break it down. She initially invited 100 people. Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends. So, for each person she invited, there are 2 more coming. So, that would be 100 times 2, which is 200. But wait, does that mean 200 additional people? Or is it 200 people in total? Hmm, the wording says each invited person will invite 2 of their friends, so that should be an additional 200 people. So, adding that to the original 100, that would be 100 + 200 = 300 people.

But hold on, she also called 10 of her friends and 8 of them said they'll bring their spouses. So, those 8 spouses are additional people coming as well. So, from the 10 friends she called, 8 are bringing their spouses. So, that's 8 more people. So, adding that to the previous total.

Wait, let me make sure. So, when she called 10 friends, each of those 10 is coming, right? So, that's 10 people. Then, 8 of them are bringing their spouses, so that's 8 more people. So, from the 10, she gets 10 + 8 = 18 people.

But wait, are the 10 friends she called included in the initial 100 she invited? Or is she inviting them separately? Let me read the question again. She invited 100 people via email and each invited person will invite 2 friends. She then called 10 of her friends to invite them too and 8 of them say they will be bringing their spouses.

So, she has two groups of people coming: one is the 100 invited via email, each bringing 2 friends, which would be 200, and the other is the 10 friends she called, plus 8 spouses. So, the 100 and the 200 are separate from the 10 and the 8.

So, adding all of them together: 100 (invited via email) + 200 (their friends) + 10 (friends she called) + 8 (their spouses). That would be 100 + 200 + 10 + 8.

Let me do the math: 100 + 200 is 300, plus 10 is 310, plus 8 is 318. So, 318 people in total.

Wait, but hold on a second. When she invited the 100 people via email, each of them will invite 2 friends. So, that 2 is per person, right? So, if each of the 100 invites 2, that's 200 additional guests, as I thought before.

But then, the 10 friends she called, are those included in the initial 100? Or are they separate? The question says she invited 100 via email and then called 10 of her friends to invite them too. So, I think the 10 are separate from the 100. So, the 100 are people she didn't meet before, and the 10 she called are additional people she met, who are bringing their spouses.

So, that would make the total number of guests: 100 (email invites) + (100 * 2) (their friends) + 10 (called friends) + 8 (their spouses). So, that's 100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcounting? Let me think. When she invited 100 people via email, each of them invites 2 friends. So, is that 200 people, or is that 200 people in addition to the 100? I think it's in addition, so 100 + 200 = 300. Then, she called 10 friends, which is 10 more, and 8 spouses, which is 8 more. So, 300 + 10 + 8 = 318.

Alternatively, maybe she invited 100 people, but each of those 100 is bringing 2 friends, so 100 + 200 = 300. Then, she called her own 10 friends, who are separate, and 8 of them bring their spouses, so that's 10 + 8 = 18. So, 300 + 18 = 318. Yeah, that seems to add up.

I don't think she's double-counting anyone because the 100 via email are separate from her own 10 friends. So, 100 + 200 + 10 + 8. So, 318 seats needed.

Wait, is there another way to look at this? Maybe the 10 friends she called are part of the 100 invited via email? But the question says she invited 100 people via email, and then she called 10 of her friends to invite them too. So, unless she already included her own friends in the 100, they are separate.

So, she has 100 people she invited, each bringing 2 friends: 100 + 200 = 300.

She also has 10 friends she called, each bringing a spouse: 10 + 8 = 18.

So, total guests: 300 + 18 = 318.

Therefore, Alex needs 318 seats.

Wait, but I just need to make sure that the 10 friends she called are not part of the 100 she invited via email. If they are, then the total might be different. But the wording is: she invited 100 via email, and then she called 10 of her friends (which are separate from the 100) and 8 of them are bringing their spouses.

Therefore, yes, it's 318.

**Final Answer**
Alex will need \boxed{318} seats.
</think>

Alex is hosting an event and wants to ensure she has enough seats for everyone. She invited 100 people via email, and each of these people will invite 2 friends. Additionally, she called 10 of her friends and 8 of them said they will bring their spouses. 

1. She invited 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends, resulting in \(100 \times 2 = 200\) additional people.
3. She called 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, resulting in \(10 + 8 = 18\) additional people.

Adding all these together:
- 100 (invited via email) + 200 (their friends) + 10 (friends she called) + 8 (their spouses) = 318.

Thus, Alex will need \boxed{318} seats.
