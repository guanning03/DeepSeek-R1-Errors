Question:
James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.  He gets 1 hour free.  The first paid hour is $15 and each hour after that is twice the cost.  How much did he pay?

Correct Answer:
He got it for 9-5=<<9-5=4>>4 hours
He pays for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours
The first hour cost 1*15=$<<1*15=15>>15
The other 3-1=2 hours are more expensive
They cost 15*2=$<<15*2=30>>30 per hour
So those 2 hours cost 2*30=$<<2*30=60>>60
So he pays 60+15=$<<60+15=75>>75 per hours
#### 75

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, and he gets 1 hour free. The first paid hour is $15, and each hour after that is twice the cost. I need to figure out how much he paid. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out the total time James had the carriage. He went from 5 PM to 9 PM. Let's count the hours: from 5 to 6 is one hour, 6 to 7 is another, 7 to 8 is the third, and 8 to 9 is the fourth. So that's 4 hours in total. Hmm, wait, but he got 1 hour free. Does that mean he only pays for 3 hours? That seems right.

But let me make sure. If he's hired from 5 PM to 9 PM, that's 4 hours. If he gets 1 hour free, perhaps he can take a break or something, so he doesn't pay for that hour. So, he pays for 3 hours. Now, the cost structure is a bit specific. The first paid hour is $15, and each subsequent hour is twice the cost. So, the first hour is $15, the second hour would be 2 times $15, which is $30, the third hour would be 2 times $30, which is $60, and so on. Wait, but since he only pays for 3 hours, maybe he only pays for the first three hours with this structure.

Let me verify the exact wording: "The first paid hour is $15 and each hour after that is twice the cost." So, does that mean the first hour is $15, and each hour after that is double the previous hour? So, the first hour is $15, the second is $30, the third is $60, and so on. So, for each subsequent hour, the cost doubles.

So, if James pays for 3 hours, with the first being $15, the second being $15 * 2 = $30, and the third being $30 * 2 = $60. So, adding those up: $15 + $30 + $60. Let me compute that: 15 + 30 is 45, plus 60 is 105. So, the total cost would be $105.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misunderstand the "1 hour free." Is the free hour automatically the earliest one, or can he choose which one is free? The problem just says he gets 1 hour free, so I think it's safe to assume that the free hour is the first one, so he only pays for the subsequent hours.

Alternatively, could the free hour be considered as an extra? For example, if he hires for 4 hours, but gets one free, does that mean he might pay for 4 hours but one is free? That would complicate things. But the way it's phrased is he "hires from 5 PM to 9 PM," which is 4 hours, and he "gets 1 hour free." So, maybe he can take a 1-hour break within that time and only pays for 3 hours.

But another way to interpret it is that he gets 1 hour free on top of the 4 hours he hires, meaning he would pay for 5 hours, but that seems odd because he's only hiring for 4 hours. So, I think the first interpretation is correct: he gets 1 hour free from the 4-hour period he's hiring, so he only pays for 3 hours.

So, continuing with that, the first paid hour is $15, the next is $30, the third is $60, totaling $105. So, James paid $105 for his carriage ride.

Wait, let me think again: is "the first paid hour is $15" meaning that he must pay the first hour, and the next one is double, or is it that the first hour he pays $15, and each subsequent hour is double the previous? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Hmm.

Let me reread it: "The first paid hour is $15 and each hour after that is twice the cost." So, it sounds like the first hour is $15, and each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the previous one. So, that would mean the first is $15, the second is $30, the third is $60, as I thought earlier.

Alternatively, if it had said "each hour after the first is twice the first hour," that would mean each subsequent hour is $30, but it says "twice the cost," which would imply doubling each time. So, yes, $15, $30, $60 for each subsequent hour.

Therefore, for 3 hours, it's $15 + $30 + $60 = $105. That seems correct.

Wait, another thought: if he gets 1 hour free, does that mean he can extend his time? For example, if he's only hiring for 4 hours, but he gets one hour free, maybe he can go an hour extra? But that seems like a stretch. The problem doesn't mention anything about extending beyond the 4 hours. It just says he hires from 5 PM to 9 PM, and gets 1 hour free. So, probably, he only pays for 3 hours.

Another angle: perhaps the free hour can be applied to any part of the hire. So, maybe he could take the free hour in the middle or something. But unless specified, I think it's safe to assume it's the first hour.

So, in that case, paying for the next three hours: $15, $30, $60. So, total is $105.

Wait, let me visualize the timeline: from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. If he takes the first hour as free, he pays for 6 PM to 7 PM, 7 PM to 8 PM, and 8 PM to 9 PM.

So, the first paid hour is from 6 PM to 7 PM: $15.

Then, 7 PM to 8 PM is the second hour, which is twice the first: $30.

Then, 8 PM to 9 PM is the third hour, which is twice the second: $60.

So, total paid: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Alternatively, if he takes the free hour somewhere else, like from 5 PM to 6 PM free, then he would pay for 6 PM to 9 PM, which is 3 hours: same as before, so same total.

So, regardless of when he takes the free hour, he's only paying for 3 hours with the cost structure of $15, $30, $60.

Therefore, the total amount he paid is $105.

I'm pretty confident now that the answer is $105.

**Final Answer**
James paid a total of \boxed{105} dollars.
</think>

James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 3 hours. The cost structure is such that the first paid hour is $15, and each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the previous one.

Breaking down the cost:
- The first paid hour (from 6 PM to 7 PM) is $15.
- The second paid hour (from 7 PM to 8 PM) is $30 (twice the first hour).
- The third paid hour (from 8 PM to 9 PM) is $60 (twice the second hour).

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 \]

Thus, James paid a total of \boxed{105} dollars.
