Question:
Colby loves going to the movies and every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies. Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Tickets for any other day cost $7. Popcorn costs $8 and boxes of candy cost $2. It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?

Correct Answer:
He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50
He has spent $56 on movies the rest of the day because 8 x 7 = <<8*7=56>>56
He has spent $16 on popcorn because 2 x 8 = <<16=16>>16
He has spent $8 on candy because 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8
He has spent 130 in total because 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = <<50+56+16+8=130>>130
He plans to spend $10 on popcorn and candy because 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10
He has $10 left to spend because 150 - 130 - 10 = <<150-130-10=10>>10
He can see 1 movie because 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1

Wrong Answer:
Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, Colby has $150 each month to spend on movies. He loves going to the movies every month, and his parents give him this money. Now, tickets cost different prices depending on the day. Fridays and Saturdays are more expensive because they're weekends, right? So, Friday and Saturday tickets are $10 each. On any other day, like Monday to Thursday or Sunday, the tickets are cheaper at $7 each. 

He also has some other expenses: popcorn and candy. Popcorn costs $8 per tub, and candy is $2 per box. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and a box of candy that night. So, that means on the movie night he chooses, he has to spend $8 + $2 = $10 for those two items. 

Now, the problem says it's the last day of the month and it's a Friday. So, he's going to the movies on a Friday night. He already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month. We need to figure out how many movies he can see if he sticks to his budget, considering all these expenses.

First, let me summarize the given information:

- Total monthly budget: $150
- Ticket prices:
  - Fridays and Saturdays: $10 each
  - Other days: $7 each
- Popcorn: $8 per tub
- Candy: $2 per box
- He wants at least one popcorn and one candy, which costs $10.
- He already saw:
  - 5 movies on Friday or Saturday
  - 8 movies on other days
  - 2 tubs of popcorn
  - 4 boxes of candy

He wants to know how many movies he can see in total this month, considering all his expenses.

Wait, actually, the problem is a bit unclear. It says he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy. So, does that mean he's already spent some money on these? Or is he planning this and wants to know how many he can see without exceeding his budget?

I think it's the latter. So, he's already allocated some movies and some snacks, and now we need to figure out how many more movies he can see without exceeding his $150. Or maybe it's about the total number of movies he can see given his previous purchases.

Wait, let me read again:

"It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?"

Hmm, the phrasing is a bit ambiguous. Is he asking how many movies he can see in total, given that he already saw some and has some snack expenses? Or is he asking how many more movies he can see given his previous expenses and the current budget?

I think it's the second. So, he's already spent some money on movies and snacks, and we need to figure out how many more movies he can see without exceeding his $150.

Wait, but he wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. So, the current night is Friday, and he wants to see a movie with a popcorn and candy. So, that means he needs to have that combination.

But let me break it down:

1. Total budget: $150
2. Tickets: Depending on the day, either $10 or $7
3. Snacks: Popcorn is $8, candy is $2. He wants at least one of each, so $10
4. He already saw 5 movies on Friday/Saturday, 8 on other days, 2 tubs of popcorn, and 4 boxes of candy.

So, perhaps we need to calculate how much he has already spent and how much he can still spend on additional movies.

Wait, the problem is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.

He has $150. Each month, he can spend this on movies, popcorn, and candy. The prices are: $10 for Friday/Saturday, $7 for other days, $8 for popcorn, $2 for candy. He wants to make sure on Friday, he has a movie and a combo of popcorn and candy, which costs $10.

He already saw:
- 5 movies on Friday/Saturday
- 8 movies on other days
- 2 tubs of popcorn
- 4 boxes of candy

So, does this mean he's already spent some money on these, and he wants to know how many more movies (or perhaps total) he can see?

Wait, the problem is asking: "How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?"

So, he's asking in total, considering he has already seen some movies and bought some snacks, how many movies can he see in total?

But then, the problem says he wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. So, that night is Friday, so he needs to have that on that specific night.

Hmm, maybe my initial interpretation is wrong. Perhaps he wants to see how many movies he can see in total, given that he already saw 5 on Fri/Sat, 8 on other days, bought 2 tubs and 4 boxes, and he wants to have a combo on that Friday.

Wait, maybe it's about the total number of movies he can see, considering he already saw a certain number, and he wants to ensure that on that Friday, he can have a movie with popcorn and candy.

But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's about how much money he has left after buying the snacks, and how many movies he can see on other days and on Friday/Saturday, with the ticket prices.

Let me try to structure this:

Total money: $150

Expenses so far:
- Tickets: 5 on Fri/Sat at $10 each, 8 on other days at $7 each
- Snacks: 2*$8 + 4*$2 = $16 + $8 = $24

So, total spent so far: (5*10) + (8*7) + (2*8 + 4*2) = $50 + $56 + $24 = $130

Therefore, remaining money: $150 - $130 = $20

Now, if he wants to see more movies, he needs to consider the cost of tickets and snacks. But since he already wants to have a combo on that Friday night, which is already covered in his initial expenses. Wait, no, the 5 movies on Fri/Sat include that Friday night? Or is the 5 movies separate?

Wait, the problem says: "he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month."

So, that's the total movies he has seen so far, and the total snacks he has bought. So, he has spent money on all these.

Therefore, he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

But he wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy on that Friday. So, he needs to have that for that night. Since he already bought 2 tubs and 4 boxes, he already has more than enough. So, maybe he doesn't need to spend more on snacks.

Wait, but the problem says he wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. So, he might be planning to go to that Friday night, and he already has the snacks. So, he just needs to see another movie on Friday/Saturday, which would cost $10.

But wait, he already saw 5 movies on Fri/Sat, so maybe he wants to see more? Or is that the total?

Wait, the problem is unclear. Let me read it again:

"Colby loves going to the movies and every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies. Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Tickets for any other day cost $7. Popcorn costs $8 and boxes of candy cost $2. It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?"

So, he already saw 5 movies on Fri/Sat, 8 on other days, and bought 2 tubs and 4 boxes. So, these are all his previous activities, not including the current night.

So, on the last day, which is Friday, he wants to see a movie and have a popcorn and candy. Since he already bought the snacks, he just needs to see a movie on Friday/Saturday, which costs $10.

But the question is, how many movies can he see in total, considering that he already saw 5 on Fri/Sat, 8 on other days, and he wants to see one more on this Friday.

But wait, if he has already seen 5 on Fri/Sat, and today is Friday, can he see another movie today? Or is the 5 movies already including today?

This is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the 5 movies on Fri/Sat include today's movie, and he wants to see how many more he can see today, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the 5 movies on Friday/Saturday are separate from today's movie. So, he's going to see one more movie today, which is a Friday, costing $10, and he already has 2 tubs and 4 boxes, so his total expenses would be:

- Tickets: (5 + 1)*$10 + 8*$7 = 6*10 + 8*7 = $60 + $56 = $116
- Snacks: 2*8 + 4*2 = $16 + $8 = $24
- Total: $116 + $24 = $140

So, $140 spent, leaving him with $10.

But wait, if he only wants to buy one more movie today, that's $10, which would exactly use up his remaining $10.

But the problem is asking "how many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?"

So, he already saw 5 on Fri/Sat, 8 on other days, and has 2 popcorns and 4 candies. So, he's planning to see one more movie on Friday, which would cost $10 for the ticket and he already has enough snacks for the combo.

Therefore, total movies he can see would be 5 + 8 + 1 = 14 movies.

But let me check the total cost:

- Tickets: (5 + 1)*10 + 8*7 = 6*10 + 56 = $60 + $56 = $116
- Snacks: 2*8 + 4*2 = $16 + $8 = $24
- Total: $116 + $24 = $140

Which is within his $150 budget, leaving him with $10. Since the question is about how many movies he can see, and he's only planning to see one more today, that would make it 14 movies in total.

But wait, maybe he can see more movies on other days? Because he has $10 left after buying the snacks and the movie ticket.

Wait, no, because he's already spent $140, so he only has $10 left, which isn't enough for another movie on Friday (needs $10) or another movie on other days (needs $7). So, he can't see any more movies beyond the 14.

Wait, but let's double-check the math:

Total budget: $150

Expenses:

- Tickets: 5 (Fri/Sat) * $10 = $50
- Tickets: 8 (other days) * $7 = $56
- Tickets: 1 (this Friday) * $10 = $10
- Snacks: 2*$8 + 4*$2 = $16 + $8 = $24

Total: $50 + $56 + $10 + $24 = $140

Remaining: $150 - $140 = $10

With $10 left, he can't buy another movie on Friday (needs $10) or another movie on other days (needs $7). So, he can't see any more movies. Therefore, total movies he can see is 5 (Fri/Sat) + 8 (other days) + 1 (this Friday) = 14 movies.

But wait, hold on. Maybe the 5 movies on Fri/Sat include today's movie? Let me check the problem again:

"It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?"

So, does the 5 movies on Friday/Saturday include today's movie or not? If today is Friday, and he wants to see a movie tonight, does that count as one of the 5? Or is it separate?

The wording is a bit unclear. If the 5 movies on Friday/Saturday include today's movie, then he has already seen that movie, so he can't see it again. But if it's separate, he can see one more today.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the safer assumption is that the 5 movies include today's movie. So, he cannot see another movie today because he's already counted it in the 5.

But wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me think.

If he has already seen 5 movies on Friday/Saturday, and today is Friday, does that mean he has already seen one of those 5 on this Friday, or is today a separate Friday where he can see another movie?

Given that it's the last day of the month, perhaps he's going to see a movie tonight, which is a new Friday/Saturday, separate from the 5 he saw previously.

But the problem says he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday. So, if he's seeing this Friday, which is a separate day, then he can add one more to the 5.

Therefore, he can see 5 + 1 = 6 movies on Friday/Saturday, 8 on other days, and the snacks already paid for.

So, total movies: 6 + 8 = 14.

But let me verify the total cost:

- Tickets: 6*10 + 8*7 = 60 + 56 = $116
- Snacks: 2*8 + 4*2 = $24
- Total: $140
- Remaining: $10

So, he can only see 14 movies in total, with $10 left. So, he can't see any more movies because he can't afford another ticket on Friday ($10) or on other days ($7). So, he can't go see another movie.

Alternatively, if he decides not to see the movie on Friday, he can use the remaining $10 to see a movie on another day. But wait, if he doesn't see the movie on Friday, he can use $10 to buy another ticket on another day, which is cheaper at $7. So, he can go see another movie on another day with the remaining $10.

Wait, let me recast this.

He has $150.

He has already spent:

- Tickets: 5*10 + 8*7 = 50 + 56 = $106
- Snacks: 24
- Total: $130

Remaining: $20

Now, if he wants to see a movie on Friday, that's $10, which would leave him with $10. He can't see another movie on Friday because he can only spend $10 on one movie.

Alternatively, he can use the remaining $20 to see two more movies on other days at $7 each, which would cost $14, leaving him with $6. But he can't buy another snack combo because that would cost $10, which he doesn't have.

But wait, the problem says he wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. So, that night, he needs to have a combo. So, he must have $10 set aside for that combo.

Therefore, he can't use the remaining $10 for another ticket because he needs to use it for the combo.

So, he has to set aside $10 for the combo, and then with the remaining $10, he can see one more movie on another day at $7, leaving him with $3.

Wait, but if he sets aside $10 for the combo, he has $150 - $10 = $140 left for tickets.

So, let's recast everything:

Total budget: $150

Snacks for combo: $10

Remaining for tickets: $140

He already saw:

- 5 movies on Fri/Sat: 5*$10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8*$7 = $56
- Total spent on tickets so far: $50 + $56 = $106

Remaining on tickets: $140 - $106 = $34

With $34, he can see:

- On Fri/Sat: Each ticket is $10, so he can see 3 more movies (3*$10 = $30), leaving $4.
- On other days: Each ticket is $7, so he can see 4 more movies (4*$7 = $28), but he only has $34 left, so 4 would cost $28, leaving $6.

But wait, he wants to make sure he gets a combo on that Friday. So, he needs to have that combo, which is $10, but he can't use it for a ticket. So, he needs to have $10 set aside for the combo, and the rest can be used for tickets.

Therefore, total budget:

- $10 for combo
- Remaining: $140

But he already spent $106 on tickets, so remaining for tickets: $140 - $106 = $34

So, with $34, he can see:

- On Fri/Sat: 3 more movies at $10 each = $30, leaving $4
- On other days: With $4, he can't buy any tickets since they are $7 each.

Alternatively, he can use the $34 to see as many movies as possible on other days:

- $34 divided by $7 is 4 with a remainder of $6, so 4 movies on other days.

But he can only see 4 more on other days, costing $28, leaving $6, which isn't enough for another movie on Fri/Sat.

But wait, he also needs to see the combo on Friday. So, he has to set aside $10 for that. So, he has $10 reserved for the combo, and $140 for tickets.

He already saw 5 on Fri/Sat and 8 on other days, costing $50 + $56 = $106. So, remaining for tickets: $140 - $106 = $34.

Therefore, with $34, he can see:

- On Fri/Sat: 3 more movies ($30), leaving $4
- On other days: 4 more movies ($28), leaving $6

But he can't use the leftover money for anything else because he already reserved $10 for the combo.

Therefore, in total, he can see:

- 5 (initial) + 3 (additional Fri/Sat) = 8 on Fri/Sat
- 8 (initial) + 4 (additional other days) = 12 on other days
- 1 (combo night) = 1 on Friday

Wait, but the initial 5 on Fri/Sat include the combo night? Or is the combo night separate?

If the initial 5 on Fri/Sat include today's movie, then he can't see another one. But if it's separate, he can.

This is the crux of the confusion.

If the 5 movies on Fri/Sat are separate from today's movie, then he can add one more to that 5.

But if the 5 movies include today's movie, then he can't add another.

Given that it's the last day of the month and it's a Friday, it's more likely that today's movie is a separate Friday/Saturday movie, so he can add one more.

Therefore, total movies:

- 5 (Fri/Sat) + 1 (today) = 6 on Fri/Sat
- 8 on other days
- 1 combo night (same as today's Friday)

Wait, but the combo night is the same as today's Friday, so he can't count it twice.

Therefore, total movies:

- 6 on Fri/Sat
- 8 on other days
- 0 additional combo night, since it's already counted in the 6.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because he wants to make sure he gets the combo on that night. So, maybe he needs to see a movie on Friday, which is the combo night.

Wait, perhaps the 5 movies on Fri/Sat are separate from today's movie. So, he can see 5 on previous Fri/Sat and 1 today, making it 6 on Fri/Sat.

But the problem says he wants to make sure he gets the combo on that night. So, the combo is for that night, which is separate from the previous 5.

Therefore, the total movies he can see:

- 5 on previous Fri/Sat
- 1 on this Friday (combo night)
- 8 on other days
- And the remaining money after all these expenses can be used for more movies if possible.

Wait, but we have to calculate the total number.

So, let's recast:

Total budget: $150

Snacks: $10 (combo) + $24 (other snacks) = $34

Remaining for tickets: $150 - $34 = $116

He already saw:

- 5 on Fri/Sat: $50
- 8 on other days: $56
- Total: $106

Remaining for tickets: $116 - $106 = $10

With $10, he can see one more movie on Fri/Sat, costing $10.

Therefore, total movies:

- 5 (previous) + 1 (today) = 6 on Fri/Sat
- 8 on other days
- 1 combo night (same as today's Fri/Sat)

But again, the combo night is the same as today's movie, so he can't count it twice.

Alternatively, perhaps the $10 is just for the combo, so he can only see the 5 on Fri/Sat, 8 on other days, and 1 combo night, but that's already included in the 5 on Fri/Sat, so he can't see another on Fri/Sat.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me approach it step by step:

1. Total budget: $150

2. Snacks: 2 tubs + 4 boxes = 2*8 + 4*2 = 16 + 8 = $24

3. Combo: 1 * ($8 + $2) = $10

So, total snacks and combo: $24 + $10 = $34

4. Remaining for tickets: $150 - $34 = $116

5. He has already seen:

   - 5 movies on Fri/Sat: 5 * $10 = $50
   - 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
   - Total tickets so far: $50 + $56 = $106

6. Remaining tickets: $116 - $106 = $10

7. With $10, he can see one more movie on Fri/Sat.

8. Therefore, total movies:

   - 5 (previous) + 1 (additional Fri/Sat) = 6 on Fri/Sat
   - 8 on other days
   - 1 combo night (same as the additional Fri/Sat)

But the combo night is the same as the additional Fri/Sat, so he can only count that once.

Wait, perhaps the 5 movies on Fri/Sat are separate from the additional one. So, in total, he can see 6 on Fri/Sat, 8 on other days, and 1 combo night, but that combo night is part of the Fri/Sat movies, so he's only seen 6 movies on Fri/Sat, which includes the combo night.

Therefore, total movies: 6 + 8 = 14

But wait, the problem says he saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 on other days, had 2 tubs and 4 boxes. He wants to make sure he gets a combo on that Friday.

So, he can't see the combo night as a separate movie, it's just that on that Friday, he wants to have the combo. So, he needs to have that combo, which is part of the $10 ticket.

Therefore, he can see 5 movies on previous Fri/Sat, 8 on other days, and then one more on Friday/Saturday with the combo.

So, total movies: 5 + 8 + 1 = 14

But wait, the 1 is already included in the Fri/Sat count, so it's 5 + 1 = 6 on Fri/Sat, and 8 on other days, making 14 total.

But the $10 for the combo is already accounted for in the ticket price, so he has to make sure he has that $10 set aside for the combo.

Therefore, the total movies he can see is 14, with the $10 allocated for the combo on Friday.

Alternatively, if he wants to see more movies, he might need to adjust the combo.

Wait, but the problem says he wants to make sure he gets the combo on that night. So, he must have that combo, which is $10.

Therefore, with the remaining $10, he can see one more movie on Fri/Sat, which would allow him to have that combo night.

Therefore, he can see 6 movies on Fri/Sat, 8 on other days, which is 14 total.

But let me just do a final check:

Total expenses:

- Tickets: (5 + 1)*10 + 8*7 = 6*10 + 56 = 60 + 56 = $116
- Snacks: 24
- Combo: $10

Total: $116 + $24 + $10 = $150

Perfect, that adds up to his total budget.

Therefore, total movies he can see is 5 + 8 + 1 = 14.

So, the answer is 14 movies.

**Final Answer**
Colby can see a total of \boxed{14} movies this month.
</think>

Colby has a monthly budget of $150 to spend on movies. Tickets cost $10 for Fridays and Saturdays, and $7 for other days. Popcorn costs $8 and candy costs $2. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and a box of candy on Friday night, which costs $10.

He already saw:
- 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday
- 8 movies on other days
- 2 tubs of popcorn
- 4 boxes of candy

First, we calculate his expenses so far:
- Tickets for 5 movies on Fridays/Saturdays: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
- Tickets for 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars
- Snacks: \(2 \times 8 + 4 \times 2 = 16 + 8 = 24\) dollars

Total expenses so far: \(50 + 56 + 24 = 130\) dollars

Remaining budget: \(150 - 130 = 20\) dollars

He needs $10 for the combo of popcorn and candy on Friday. With the remaining $10, he can see one more movie on a Friday/Saturday.

Total movies seen:
- 5 movies on Fridays/Saturdays
- 8 movies on other days
- 1 additional movie on Friday/Saturday (for the combo)

Total movies: \(5 + 8 + 1 = 14\)

\[
\boxed{14}
\]
