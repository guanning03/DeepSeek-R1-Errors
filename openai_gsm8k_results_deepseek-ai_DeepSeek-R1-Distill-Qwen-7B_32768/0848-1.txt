Question:
Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores.  There are 3 sleeves in a box.  If 9 kids want 2 smores apiece and 6 adults will eat 1 smore apiece, how many boxes of graham crackers will they need?

Correct Answer:
Each sleeve makes 8 smores and there are 3 sleeves in a box so a box can make 8*3 = <<8*3=24>>24 smores
There are 9 kids who will eat 2 smores a piece so they will eat 9*2 = <<9*2=18>>18 smores
There are 6 adults who will eat 1 smore a piece so they will eat 6*1 = <<6*1=6>>6 smores
Together the kids will eat 18 and the adults will eat 6 so 18+6 = <<18+6=24>>24 smores
Each box makes 24 smores and together the kids and adults will eat 24 s'mores so they will need 24/24 = <<24/24=1>>1 box of graham crackers

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the total number of smores needed by calculating the amount each group of people will consume.

For the children, 9 kids each want 2 smores, so that's 9 multiplied by 2, which equals 18 smores.

For the adults, 6 adults each will eat 1 smore, so that's 6 multiplied by 1, totaling 6 smores.

Adding both amounts together, the total number of smores needed is 18 plus 6, which equals 24 smores.

Each box of graham crackers provides enough base for 8 smores. To find out how many boxes are required, divide the total number of smores by the number of smores each box can make: 24 divided by 8 equals 3.

Therefore, they will need 3 boxes of graham crackers.

To determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of smores needed:**
   
   - **Children:**  
     \( 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores} \)
   
   - **Adults:**  
     \( 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores} \)
   
   - **Total smores required:**  
     \( 18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores} \)

2. **Determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed:**
   
   - Each box makes enough for **8 smores**.
   
   - **Number of boxes required:**  
     \( \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per box}} = 3 \text{ boxes} \)

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{3}
