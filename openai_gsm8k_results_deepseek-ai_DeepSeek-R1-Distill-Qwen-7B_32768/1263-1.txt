Question:
James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy. James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?

Correct Answer:
James has 4+8=<<4+8=12>>12 toys.
There were 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 dogs.
James needed to buy 24-12=<<24-12=12>>12 more toys.
There are 36 total toys.
36-3=<<36-3=33>>33 toys are now needed.
#### 33

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Let me try to figure out how many toys he needs in total. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that each dog needs one toy. So, the number of toys James needs is equal to the number of dogs he has. Got that.

Now, initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. That part makes sense. So, 4 toys for 4 dogs, one each. Cool.

But then, it says there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. Wait, so initially, before he went to buy more toys, there were 4 dogs, right? Then, 8 more dogs came in, so now the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. So, he needs 12 toys now, right? Because each dog needs one toy.

But wait, hold on. The problem says he "bought the toys" and went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Hmm, okay, let me parse this sentence.

"He went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys." So, when he left, there were 4 dogs. Now, when he went back, the number of dogs increased by some amount, but it's twice as many as when he left. Wait, let me think.

Wait, maybe it's twice as many as he had before? Or is it twice as many more? Hmm, the wording is a bit tricky. "Twice as many more dogs than when he left." Hmm. So, when he left, there were 4 dogs. So, "more" than when he left would be an increase.

So, if he went back and saw that there are twice as many more dogs, meaning the number of additional dogs is twice what he had before. So, initially, when he left, there were 4 dogs. Then, more dogs came, so more = X. He went back and saw that X is twice as many as when he left.

Wait, no, maybe it's twice as many as when he left. So, when he left, he had 4 dogs. When he went back, the total number is twice that, so 8 dogs. But that doesn't make sense because before he went back, 8 more dogs had already come in, making 12 dogs.

Wait, perhaps I need to parse the sentence more carefully.

"He went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys."

So, when he left, there were 4 dogs. When he went back, the number of dogs had increased by some amount, and that amount is twice as many as when he left. So, let me define variables.

Let me let D be the number of dogs when he left. So, D = 4. Then, when he went back, the number of dogs increased by X, such that X = 2 * D. So, X = 2 * 4 = 8. Therefore, the number of dogs when he went back is D + X = 4 + 8 = 12. So, he had to buy 12 toys.

But wait, before that, he already had 4 toys for 4 dogs. So, he had to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys. So, he bought 8 more toys, bringing the total to 12.

But then, when he came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. So, he had 12 dogs, but 3 left, so now there are 12 - 3 = 9 dogs. Therefore, he no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs, so he can remove those. Therefore, he only needs toys for 9 dogs now.

Wait, but the problem says he went back again and saw that 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. So, he doesn't need to buy toys for them anymore. So, he had 12 dogs, bought 12 toys, but then 3 left, so he needs 9 toys.

Wait, but the question is asking how many toys in total does James need? Hmm.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem.

"James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy. James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?"

So, let's break it down:

1. Initially, 4 dogs, 4 toys.

2. Now, there are 8 more dogs, so total dogs now: 4 + 8 = 12.

3. He buys toys for 12 dogs, so he needs 12 toys.

Wait, but hold on. He already had 4 toys. So, he needs to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys. So, total toys after first purchase: 12.

4. Then, he went back and saw that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left (when he left, he had 4 dogs). So, when he went back, the number of dogs increased by twice as much as before. So, initially, he had 4 dogs, then 8 more. So, 8 is twice as much as 4? Wait, 8 is twice 4, yes. So, 8 more dogs came in, making total 12.

So, he had to buy 12 toys in total, but he already had 4, so he bought 8 more.

5. Then, when he came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed their toys. So, the number of dogs decreased by 3, so now he has 12 - 3 = 9 dogs.

Therefore, he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs, so he can remove 3 toys, bringing his total needed down to 9.

But wait, but the problem is asking for how many toys in total does James need. So, is it 12, or 9?

Wait, let me see.

He initially had 4 toys.

Then, he bought 8 more to get to 12.

Then, when 3 dogs left, he had 9 dogs remaining, so he no longer needs 3 toys.

So, his current total number of toys is 12, but he can remove 3, so he just needs 9.

But does he need to have all the toys he bought, or can he reduce the number because some dogs are gone?

Hmm, the problem says he bought the toys after the initial 4, then went back and saw more dogs, had to buy more, and then when he came back again, some dogs left, so he no longer needed those toys.

So, does that mean he needs to keep the toys for the dogs that are still there, or can he let them go?

I think he can let them go, so he can remove the toys for the dogs that left.

So, in total, he had 12 toys, but then 3 were for dogs that left, so he can remove them, leaving him with 9.

But the problem is asking for how many toys does he need in total. So, 9.

But let me make sure.

Alternatively, maybe he has to keep all the toys in case more dogs come. But the problem doesn't specify that. It just says he went back, saw some dogs left, so he no longer needed those toys. So, I think he can remove them.

Therefore, 9 toys.

But let me read the problem again.

"James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy. James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?"

So, the key is that each dog needs one toy, so he needs as many toys as dogs currently in the shelter.

Initially, he had 4 dogs, 4 toys.

But now, 8 more dogs are there, so 12 dogs, so he needs 12 toys.

But he had already bought 12 toys earlier. However, when he came back, 3 dogs left, so he no longer needs those 3 toys.

So, he needs 12 - 3 = 9 toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys he needs is 9.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the first part.

He initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs.

Then, 8 more dogs come in, so total 12 dogs.

He buys the toys for all 12 dogs, so he buys 8 more toys, bringing his total to 12.

Then, 3 dogs leave, so he no longer needs 3 toys, leaving him with 9.

So, does he need 9 toys in total? Or is the total number of toys he has 12, but he can dispose of 3, so he only needs 9.

But the question is asking "How many toys in total does James need?"

So, the need is for the current number of dogs, which is 9, so he needs 9 toys.

Alternatively, maybe he needs all the toys he bought because he doesn't know which ones are going to leave. But the problem says he came back and saw that 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. So, he can remove them.

Therefore, the total number he needs is 9.

But let me think again.

Wait, another interpretation: Each time he goes back, he sees more dogs, so he has to buy more toys.

Wait, when he first went back, he saw that there were twice as many more dogs than when he left.

When he left, he had 4 dogs.

So, twice as many more dogs as when he left. So, the number of additional dogs is twice 4, which is 8.

So, he had 4 dogs, 8 more came in, making 12.

But he had already bought toys for 12 dogs, so he had 12 toys.

Then, when he came back again, 3 dogs left, so he no longer needed their toys, so he can remove 3, bringing the total needed to 9.

Therefore, the answer is 9.

Alternatively, if he had to buy toys each time, but he initially had 4, bought 8 more, and then 3 left, so he had to buy 3 more. But that interpretation seems less likely because the problem says he went back and saw that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, so he had to buy some more. Then, when he came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys.

So, it's more like he bought the initial 4, then when more dogs came in, he bought more, and then when some dogs left, he removed their toys.

So, the total he needs is 9.

Wait, but another way to think about it is:

Total number of dogs now: 12.

Total toys needed: 12.

But since 3 left, he doesn't need 3, so 12 - 3 = 9.

So, 9 toys.

Therefore, the answer is 9.

Wait, but let me think again.

Is the initial purchase 4 toys, then he needs 12, buys 8 more, so total toys are 12. Then, he had 12 dogs, 3 left, so he removes 3 toys, so he has 9 toys left.

But the question is asking how many toys does James need in total, so I think it's 9.

Alternatively, maybe the 8 more dogs came in, making 12, so he needs 12. But then, when 3 leave, he only needs 9. So, he needs to have 9.

But maybe the answer is 12 because he bought 12 toys, but the problem is, it's not specified whether he can remove the toys for the 3 dogs or not. But the problem says he came back again and saw that 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. Therefore, he can remove them, so he doesn't need to have those 3 toys anymore.

Therefore, the total number of toys he needs is 9.

Wait, but maybe the first time he bought 12 toys, but when he came back, he saw that 3 were gone, so he can remove 3, so he only needs 9.

So, the answer is 9.

But let me check the problem statement again.

"James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy. James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?"

So, let's parse the timeline:

1. Initially, 4 dogs, 4 toys.

2. Now, 8 more dogs are there, so total 12 dogs.

3. He buys toys for all 12 dogs, so he buys 8 more toys, now he has 12 toys.

4. Then, he goes back and sees that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. When he left, he had 4 dogs. So, twice as many more dogs: 2 * 4 = 8. So, he saw 8 more dogs, which makes sense because now there are 12 dogs.

5. So, he bought toys for those 8 dogs, so now he has 12 toys.

6. Then, he comes back again and sees that 3 dogs are gone, so he doesn't need their toys. So, he removes 3 toys, leaving him with 9.

7. Therefore, he needs 9 toys in total.

So, my conclusion is 9.

But wait, hold on. Another interpretation: When he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, does that mean that the number of dogs is twice as much as when he left? So, when he left, he had 4 dogs, now he sees 8 dogs, which is twice as much.

But then, 8 more dogs came in, making 12.

Then, when he came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he had 9 dogs left.

Therefore, the total number of toys he needs is 9.

So, yeah, 9.

So, after careful consideration, I think the answer is 9.

**Final Answer**
James needs a total of \boxed{9} toys.
</think>

James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs. Now, there are 8 more dogs, making the total number of dogs 12. He buys 12 toys in total. 

After buying the toys, he goes back and sees that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, meaning 8 more dogs came in, making the total 12 dogs. He then goes back again and finds that 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs those toys. 

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 12 minus the 3 toys for the dogs that left, resulting in 9 toys.

\[
\boxed{9}
\]
