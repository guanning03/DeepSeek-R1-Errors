Question:
For his 30th birthday, Elvira chose a new computer with many accessories as a gift. She has a budget of €1500 donated by her whole family and thinks that she will be able to keep a little money to afford a garment. She goes to a computer store and chooses a machine that costs €1090 with a screen, keyboard and mouse. She also takes a scanner for €157, a CD burner worth €74 and a printer for €102. How much money will she have left for her clothing?

Correct Answer:
First, let’s look at the total cost of computer equipment: 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = <<1090+157+74+102=1423>>1423 euros
Let us now calculate what is left for the garment: 1500 - 1423 = <<1500-1423=77>>77 euros
#### 77

Gold:
77

Wrong Prediction:
€\,177

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total amount Elvira has budgeted for her computer accessories. She allocated €1500 for the computer and €100 for clothing.

The computer costs €1090, the scanner is €157, the CD burner is €74, and the printer is €102. Adding these amounts together: 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 equals €1423.

Next, I'll subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget to find out how much she has left for clothing. Subtracting €1423 from €1500 leaves her with €77.

To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Budget Allocated for Computer Accessories:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Budget for Accessories} = \text{Budget for Computer} + \text{Budget for Clothing}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total Budget for Accessories} = €1500 + €100 = €1600
   \]

2. **Determine the Total Cost of the Purchased Accessories:**
   
   - **Computer:** €1090
   - **Scanner:** €157
   - **CD Burner:** €74
   - **Printer:** €102
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost of Accessories} = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = €1423
   \]

3. **Calculate the Remaining Amount for Clothing:**
   
   \[
   \text{Money Left for Clothing} = \text{Total Budget for Accessories} - \text{Total Cost of Accessories}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Money Left for Clothing} = €1600 - €1423 = €177
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{€\,177}
\]
