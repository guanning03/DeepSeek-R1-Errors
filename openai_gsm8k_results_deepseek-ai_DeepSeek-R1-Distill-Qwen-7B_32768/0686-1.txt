Question:
A company's HR hires 20 new employees every month to add to its total workforce. If the company's initial employee number is 200, and each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months?

Correct Answer:
If each month the company hire 20 new employees, the total number of employees in the company in the first month is 200 employees + 20 employees = <<200+20=220>>220 employees
If each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money paid by the employee to its workers in the first month is 220 employees * $4000/employee = $<<220*4000=880000>>880000
In the second month, 20 more workers are hired, bringing the total number of employees to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees
The company pays a total of 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000 in wages for its employees in the second month.
When an additional 20 workers are hired in the third month, the total number of workers become 240 employees + 20 employees = <<240+20=260>>260 employees
In total, the company 260 employees * $4000/employee = $<<260*4000=1040000>>1040000 in wages on the third month.
The total amount of money the company pays to all its employees in the three months is $1040000 + $960000 + $880000 = <<1040000+960000+880000=2880000>>2880000

Wrong Prediction:
3,120,000

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the number of employees the company has after three months. The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees each month.

After the first month, the total number of employees will be:
200 + 20 = 220

After the second month, adding another 20 employees:
220 + 20 = 240

After the third month, hiring another 20 employees:
240 + 20 = 260

So, at the end of three months, the company has 260 employees.

Next, I need to calculate the total monthly salary expense. Each employee is paid $4,000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary expense is:
260 employees * $4,000 = $1,040,000

Finally, to find the total amount paid over three months, I multiply the monthly expense by 3:
$1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000
</think>

To determine the total amount the company pays to its employees after three months, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Given:**
- **Initial number of employees:** 200
- **Monthly hires:** 20 employees
- **Monthly salary per employee:** \$4,000

### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Employees After 3 Months**

1. **Start with the initial number of employees:** 200
2. **Add the monthly hires for each of the 3 months:**
   - **After 1 month:** 200 + 20 = 220 employees
   - **After 2 months:** 220 + 20 = 240 employees
   - **After 3 months:** 240 + 20 = **260 employees**

### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Monthly Salary Expense**

1. **Number of employees after 3 months:** 260
2. **Monthly salary per employee:** \$4,000
3. **Total monthly salary:** 
   \[
   260 \text{ employees} \times \$4,000 = \$1,040,000
   \]

### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Salary Over 3 Months**

1. **Total monthly salary:** \$1,040,000
2. **Total for 3 months:**
   \[
   \$1,040,000 \times 3 = \$3,120,000
   \]

### **Final Answer**

The company pays a total of \(\boxed{\$3,\!120,\!000}\) to its employees after three months.
