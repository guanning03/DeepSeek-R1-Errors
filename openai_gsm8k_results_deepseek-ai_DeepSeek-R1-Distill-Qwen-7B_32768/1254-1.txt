Question:
Johnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.  He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces.  How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?

Correct Answer:
The first set had 500 pieces, and the second set had 3 times as many as the first set, so the second set has 500*3=<<500*3=1500>>1500 pieces
The third set had one-quarter of the 500 pieces, so that means it had 500*.25= <<500*.25=125>>125 pieces
In total, that means Johnny picked up 500 + 1500+ 125= <<500+1500+125=2125>>2125 blocks
#### 2,125

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Johnny is picking up all these lego toys, and I need to figure out how many pieces he picks up in total. Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, he found a lego box with 500 pieces. That seems straightforward. So, 500 pieces is one box. Got that.

Then, he also found another box that has 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece one. Hmm, "3 times more" can sometimes be confusing. Let me think. If I have 500 pieces and something is 3 times more, does that mean 500 plus 3 times 500, or just 3 times 500? I remember that sometimes "times more" can mean multiplication, but it can also imply adding the original amount. So, 3 times more than 500 would be 500 + (3*500) = 500 + 1500 = 2000 pieces? Or is it just 3*500 = 1500 pieces? 

Wait, let me clarify that. If something is "3 times more," that generally means the original amount plus three times the original. So, "more" implies addition. So, 3 times more than 500 would be 500 + (3*500) = 2000. So, that box has 2000 pieces. I think that's the right interpretation.

Okay, moving on to the third box. It says Johnny found another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces. So, 1/4 of what? 1/4 of the 500-piece box or 1/4 of the 2000-piece box? The wording says "1/4 the number of pieces," so it doesn't specify which one. But since he's found two different boxes, one with 500 and another with 2000, I think it's referring to one of those. 

Wait, the problem says he found a lego box with 500 pieces, another one with 3 times more than that, and another one with 1/4 the number of pieces. So, probably, the third box is 1/4 of the 500-piece box. Because if it was 1/4 of the 2000-piece, that would be 500 pieces, and that might not make sense because we already have a 500-piece box. So, to clarify, 1/4 of 500 is 125 pieces. So, 125 pieces in the third box.

Now, let me write that down:

- First box: 500 pieces
- Second box: 3 times more than 500, which is 2000 pieces
- Third box: 1/4 of 500, which is 125 pieces

So, to find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, I need to add all these together. So, 500 + 2000 + 125.

Wait, let me calculate that step by step.

First, 500 + 2000 is 2500. Then, adding 125 to that: 2500 + 125.

Hmm, 2500 + 100 is 2600, and then +25 is 2625. So, total pieces are 2625.

But hold on, let me double-check that. If I have 500, 2000, and 125. 500 + 2000 is 2500. 2500 + 125 is 2625. Yeah, that seems right.

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting "3 times more." Sometimes, in language, "times more" can be ambiguous. Some people might interpret it as just multiplying by 3, not adding 3 times. So, for example, if I say "3 times more," does that mean 3 times as many as the original, or 4 times as many? Because "times more" can be tricky.

Wait, let me think. If I have 500 pieces, and I have something that is 3 times more than that, does that mean 500 * 3 = 1500, or 500 + 1500 = 2000? Hmm, this is a common confusion. I think in standard usage, "times more" usually means multiplied by that number, so 3 times more would be 3 * 500 = 1500. But sometimes people use it to mean multiplied by (times plus one). So, it's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, so if it's 3 times more, meaning that the total is 3 times the original, then 500 + 1500? Or is it 3 times the original, so 1500. Hmm, this is confusing. I need to figure out which interpretation is correct here.

Let me check an example. If I say, "I have 2 times more apples than you," and you have 1 apple. Does that mean I have 2 apples or 3 apples? Usually, it's interpreted as 2 times as many, so 2 apples. But sometimes, people might say "more" as in addition. So, in that case, 2 times more would mean 1 + 2*1 = 3 apples.

Wait, so maybe the correct interpretation is that "3 times more" is 3 times as many as the original. So, 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

But if that's the case, then the second box is 1500 pieces, not 2000. Then, the third box is 1/4 of 500 is 125.

So, total pieces would be 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

Wait, so now I'm confused because depending on the interpretation, the answer could be 2125 or 2625.

Hmm, so how do I figure this out?

I think in standard math problems, when they say "3 times more," it usually means 3 times as many, not 4 times as many. So, if Johnny has a box with 500 pieces, and another box with 3 times more, that would be 1500. So, 3 times more is 3*500.

But sometimes, people use "more" to mean addition. So, if you have 500 and someone has 3 times more, they might mean 500 + 3*500 = 2000.

So, this is a bit ambiguous, but in math problems, it's usually interpreted as multiplicative. So, 3 times more is 3*original. So, 1500.

But let me check the problem statement again: "He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces."

So, the first is 500, the second is 3 times more than the 500, which would be 3*500=1500, and the third is 1/4 the number of pieces, which would be 1/4*500=125.

Wait, but then "1/4 the number of pieces," does that refer to the number of pieces in the second box or the first? Hmm, that's another point of confusion.

The problem says: he found a 500-piece box, another with 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece one, and another with 1/4 the number of pieces.

So, perhaps the third box is 1/4 of the 500-piece one, which is 125. So, that seems more likely.

Alternatively, if the third box is 1/4 of the second box, which was 1500, that would be 375, but that seems less likely because 1/4 of 1500 is 375, but then why specify 1/4? It's just another number.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the third box is 1/4 of the first or the second box. It just says "another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces." So, the number of pieces in the first box is 500, so 1/4 of that is 125. Alternatively, if it had 1/4 of the second box, that's 375. But since the second box is 3 times more, which is 1500, 1/4 of that is 375.

But the problem doesn't specify whether it's 1/4 of the first box or the second box. Hmm. So, how do we interpret that?

Wait, the problem is phrased as: he found a lego box with 500, another with 3 times more, and another with 1/4 the number of pieces. So, the third box is 1/4 the number of pieces, which is ambiguous.

But in the first sentence, it's "a lego boxed set with 500 pieces," so that's one box. Then, "and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one." So, that's another box. Then, "another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces."

So, the number of pieces is 1/4 of what? Maybe it's 1/4 of the first one, which is 500. Or 1/4 of the second one, which is 1500.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's 1/4 of the total? That seems less likely because the first box is 500, the second is 1500, so 1/4 of the total would be 1/4 of 2000, which is 500. But that seems redundant.

Wait, maybe the problem is just trying to say the third box is 1/4 of the second box? Because if it's 1/4 of the first box, it's 125, which is separate.

Alternatively, maybe the third box is 1/4 of the second box, which is 1500, so 375. Hmm.

But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's 1/4 of the number of pieces, meaning 1/4 of 500, which is 125. So, that would be the third box.

Wait, but then the problem is just listing the three boxes: 500, 3 times more (1500), and 1/4 the number of pieces (125). So, adding them up: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

Alternatively, if the third box is 1/4 of the second box, which is 1500, so 1/4 of that is 375, then total is 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375.

But the problem is ambiguous on that point. So, how do we resolve that?

Wait, let me read the problem again carefully: "He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces."

So, the first box is 500. The second box is 3 times more than the 500, so that's 3*500=1500. The third box is 1/4 the number of pieces. So, the number of pieces is 1/4 of what? Since it's describing the third box, it's probably referring to the number of pieces in the second box or the first box.

But in the problem statement, the first box is 500, the second is 3 times more, which is 1500. So, the third box is 1/4 the number of pieces, but it's unclear which one.

Wait, maybe the "number of pieces" refers to the total number of pieces he has, but that seems unlikely because it's a bit convoluted.

Alternatively, maybe the third box is 1/4 of the number of pieces in the second box. So, 1/4*1500 = 375.

But since the problem is written in a way that it's sequential, first, 500, then another one with 3 times more, and then another one with 1/4 the number of pieces. So, the third box is 1/4 of the number of pieces in the second box.

So, if the second box is 3 times more than 500, which is 1500, then 1/4 of 1500 is 375.

So, adding up: 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375.

Alternatively, if the third box is 1/4 of the first box, which is 125, then total is 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

But how do we know which one it is?

Wait, let's look at the wording again: "another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces."

So, the number of pieces is 1/4. So, it's 1/4 of what? It's not specified, but in the context, the first two boxes are being described as having 500 and 3 times more. So, the third box is 1/4 the number of pieces, which is probably referring to the number of pieces in the second box.

Alternatively, maybe it's 1/4 of the total number of pieces. But then, that would be 1/4 of (500 + 1500) = 1/4 of 2000, which is 500, but that seems redundant because the first box is 500.

Alternatively, maybe it's 1/4 of the number in the second box, so 1/4*1500=375.

But the problem is, without explicit wording, it's ambiguous. So, maybe we need to interpret it as 1/4 of the second box.

Alternatively, sometimes in math problems, when they say "another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces," they mean 1/4 of the first box. It's a bit unclear.

But, perhaps, in context, since the first box is 500, and the second is 1500, which is 3 times more, the third box is 1/4 of the second box, because it's more logical that the third box is a smaller number relative to the second one.

Alternatively, maybe the third box is 1/4 of the first box, which is 125.

But without explicit wording, it's a bit of a guess. However, in math problems, when it says "1/4 the number of pieces," it's usually referring to the immediately preceding quantity, which would be the second box.

So, the second box is 1500, so 1/4 of that is 375. So, total pieces would be 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375.

But let me check if the problem says "another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces." So, the number of pieces is 1/4 of what? It's unclear. But, given the flow, it's probably 1/4 of the second box.

Alternatively, if I think about the problem, it's Johnny picking up all the legos. So, all the legos he found. So, the total number is the sum of all three boxes.

But the problem is, without knowing which one the third box is, it's ambiguous.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the original statement: "He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces."

Wait, so, he found three boxes: one with 500, another with 3 times more than 500, and another with 1/4 the number of pieces.

So, the third box is 1/4 the number of pieces. So, "the number of pieces" as in the pieces in the second box? Or as in total pieces?

Hmm, maybe the third box is 1/4 of the second box, which is 1500, so 375. So, 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375.

Alternatively, if it's 1/4 of the total, which is 2000, so 500. But that would be 500 + 1500 + 500 = 3000, but that seems redundant because the first box is 500.

Alternatively, maybe it's 1/4 of the number of pieces in the second box, so 375.

But I think, in math problems, when it's mentioned after another quantity, it's usually referring to the preceding one. So, "another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces" would refer to the second box, which is 1500. So, 1/4 of 1500 is 375.

So, total pieces would be 500 + 1500 + 375.

Calculating that: 500 + 1500 is 2000, plus 375 is 2375.

But let me just confirm, is 1/4 of the number of pieces in the second box, which is 1500, so 1/4*1500=375. So, yes.

So, total is 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375.

Alternatively, if the third box was 1/4 of the first box, 125, then total is 2125.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the wording again: "another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces." So, it's another one, so it's a separate box.

So, the first box is 500, the second box is 3 times more than 500, so 1500, and the third box is 1/4 of the number of pieces. So, the number of pieces in the third box is 1/4 of what? The number of pieces in what? The number of pieces in the first box? Or the second box?

Wait, the problem says "another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces." So, the number of pieces in the third box is 1/4 of the number of pieces in the second box. So, 1500 * 1/4 = 375.

So, 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375.

Alternatively, if it's 1/4 of the first box, it's 125, but that would be inconsistent with the way the problem is structured.

Alternatively, maybe the third box is 1/4 of the total number of pieces, which would be 1/4 of (500 + 1500) = 1/4 of 2000 = 500. But then the third box is 500, same as the first box. That seems less likely.

Alternatively, maybe it's 1/4 of the number of pieces in the second box, which is 1500, so 375.

So, with that reasoning, I think the total is 2375. So, 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375.

But wait, let me make sure. 3 times more can also be interpreted as 4 times as many as the original. So, for example, if you have something that is 3 times more than 500, does that mean 500 + 3*500 = 2000? Wait, that's 4 times the original.

Wait, now I'm getting confused again.

Wait, 3 times more than 500 can be ambiguous. "More" can mean addition or multiplication. So, if it's 3 times more than 500, it's 500 + 3*500 = 2000. Alternatively, if it's 3 times as much, it's 3*500 = 1500.

So, which interpretation is correct?

In standard terms, "times more" usually implies addition. For example, "500 more than 3 times as much." So, if it's "3 times more than 500," it's 500 + 3*500 = 2000.

But sometimes, people use "times as much" or "times more" interchangeably, but "times more" can mean multiplied by that factor.

Wait, let me think of an example. If I say, "I have 100 dollars, and you have 3 times more," does that mean you have 400 or 300? It's ambiguous.

But in many contexts, "3 times more" is interpreted as 3 times as much, which would be 300, but in other contexts, it's 400.

But in math problems, usually, if you say "3 times more," it's 3 times as much, so 3*original.

But in the problem statement, it's written as "3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one." So, "more" can be confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to interpret it as 3 times more pieces, so original is 500, and 3 times more would be 500 + 3*500 = 2000.

So, in that case, the second box is 2000.

Then, the third box is 1/4 the number of pieces. So, does that refer to the first box or the second box? If it's 1/4 of the second box, which is 2000, then 1/4 is 500. So, 500 + 2000 + 500 = 3000.

Alternatively, if it's 1/4 of the first box, which is 500, so 125.

But if the second box is 2000, then 1/4 of that is 500. So, total is 500 + 2000 + 500 = 3000.

Alternatively, if the third box is 1/4 of the total pieces, which would be 500 + 2000 = 2500, so 1/4 is 625. So, 500 + 2000 + 625 = 3125.

But unless the problem specifies, it's hard to say.

But the problem says: "another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces."

So, the number of pieces is 1/4 of what? It's unclear.

But in the problem statement, the first two boxes are defined: 500, and 3 times more. The third box is 1/4 the number of pieces.

Hmm. So, if we take the first box as 500, the second box as 3 times more, which would be 2000, and the third box as 1/4 of the number of pieces, which is ambiguous.

But if we think of the "number of pieces" as referring to the second box, which is 2000, then 1/4 is 500. So, total is 500 + 2000 + 500 = 3000.

Alternatively, if the third box is 1/4 of the first box, which is 125, then total is 500 + 2000 + 125 = 2625.

But in that case, the third box is 125, which is a separate box.

Wait, but 125 is a small number, so it's possible. Alternatively, 500 is a standard number.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be:

First box: 500.

Second box: 3 times more than 500, which is 1500.

Third box: 1/4 of the second box, which is 375.

So, total is 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375.

Alternatively, if the third box is 1/4 of the first box, 125, total is 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

But, given that the second box is 1500, and the third box is 1/4 of that, 375, that seems a more logical progression.

Alternatively, if the third box was 1/4 of the first box, the problem would have said something like "1/4 the number of pieces in the first box."

But it just says "1/4 the number of pieces."

So, it's ambiguous.

But, in math problems, when they say "another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces," it's often referring to the immediately preceding one.

So, if the second box is 1500, then 1/4 of 1500 is 375.

So, 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375.

Alternatively, maybe it's 1/4 of the total number of pieces, which is 2000. So, 1/4 of 2000 is 500. So, 500 + 1500 + 500 = 3000.

But again, that's adding the third box as 500, which is same as the first box.

But, in the problem statement, the third box is described as "another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces." So, another box with 1/4 the number of pieces, which could be 1/4 of the second box or the first box.

But, given that the first box is 500, and the second box is 1500, 1/4 of the second box is 375, which seems like a separate number. 1/4 of the first box is 125.

So, it's unclear.

But, given that, perhaps the correct interpretation is 1/4 of the second box, so 375, making the total 2375.

Alternatively, I can think of it as "another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces," meaning that the number of pieces is 1/4 of the number in the second box, which is 1500. So, 1/4 of that is 375. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if it's 1/4 the number of pieces in the first box, which is 500, so 125.

But, the problem is about Johnny picking up all the legos on the floor. So, if he found three boxes, 500, 1500, and 375, so the total is 2375.

Alternatively, if it's 125, the total is 2125.

But, without more context, it's hard to tell.

Wait, let's think about how the problem is written: "He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces."

So, the first box is 500. The second box is 3 times more than the 500 piece one, so that's 3*500=1500. The third box is 1/4 the number of pieces. So, the number of pieces is 1/4 of what?

It's ambiguous. It could be 1/4 of the second box, which is 375, or 1/4 of the first box, which is 125.

But, considering the flow, after 500 and 3 times more, which is 1500, the third box is another one with 1/4 the number of pieces. So, "the number of pieces" is relative to the second box because the first box was just described as 500, and the second as 3 times more. So, the third box is 1/4 the number of pieces in the second box, which is 375.

Therefore, total pieces is 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375.

But, hold on, let me check if 375 is 1/4 of 1500.

1500 divided by 4 is 375. Yes, that's correct.

So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if the third box is 1/4 of the first box, 125, then it's 125.

But, in that case, the third box is smaller than the first box, which is 500.

But, the problem says "another one," so it's separate.

So, I think the correct interpretation is 375.

Therefore, total is 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375.

But, another way to think about it is, maybe the third box is 1/4 of the total number of pieces.

So, total number of pieces is 500 + 1500 = 2000. So, 1/4 of that is 500. So, the third box is 500.

So, total is 500 + 1500 + 500 = 3000.

But, that seems a bit odd because the first box is 500 and the third box is also 500, which is just the same as the first one.

Alternatively, the third box is 1/4 of the total number of pieces, which is 500 + 1500 + x = total. But that would complicate.

Wait, let's set up an equation.

If the third box is 1/4 of the total number of pieces, then:

Let x = total number of pieces.

x = 500 + 1500 + (1/4)x

So, x - (1/4)x = 2000

(3/4)x = 2000

x = 2000 * (4/3) = 2666.666...

But that's not a whole number, which is problematic because you can't have a fraction of a lego piece.

So, that can't be the case.

Therefore, that interpretation is invalid.

So, in that case, the third box must be 1/4 of something else.

If 1/4 of the second box, which is 1500, then 375, which is a whole number.

Alternatively, 1/4 of the first box, 125.

So, 125 is also a whole number.

So, in that case, the third box is either 125 or 375.

So, which is it?

Wait, the problem is written as:

"He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces."

So, the first box is 500, the second is 3 times more than 500, so 1500, and the third is 1/4 the number of pieces.

Now, "the number of pieces" is a bit ambiguous, but likely referring to the number of pieces in the second box because that's the last box mentioned. So, 1/4 of 1500 is 375.

Therefore, the total is 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375.

Thus, I think the answer is 2375.

But, to be thorough, let's check both interpretations.

First interpretation:

First box: 500.

Second box: 3 times more than 500 = 1500.

Third box: 1/4 the number of pieces in the second box = 375.

Total: 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375.

Second interpretation:

First box: 500.

Second box: 3 times more than 500 = 1500.

Third box: 1/4 the number of pieces in the first box = 125.

Total: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

But, given the problem statement, it's more likely the first interpretation because it says "another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces," following the second box.

Therefore, I think 2375 is the correct answer.

So, my final answer is 2375 pieces.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces." So, when it says "the number of pieces," it's ambiguous whether it's referring to the second box or the first.

But, in context, since the second box is already 3 times more than the first, and the third box is another one, it's likely that "the number of pieces" refers to the second box, making the third box 375.

Therefore, the total is 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375.

Yes, that seems correct.

**Final Answer**
The total number of legos Johnny picks up is \boxed{2375}.
</think>

Johnny is picking up all the legos on the floor. He found three boxes: one with 500 pieces, another with 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece box, and another with 1/4 the number of pieces of the second box.

1. The first box has 500 pieces.
2. The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the second box, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375\) pieces.

Adding these together:
- First box: 500 pieces
- Second box: 1500 pieces
- Third box: 375 pieces

Total pieces picked up by Johnny:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 \]

Thus, the total number of legos Johnny picks up is \(\boxed{2375}\).
