Question:
If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?

Correct Answer:
Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100
Subtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40
We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.
#### 20

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem where Sam and Harry are splitting 100 feet of fence. Harry is supposed to get 60 feet more than Sam, and I need to figure out how much is left over for Sam. Hmm, let me think.

First, let me parse the problem. They have a total of 100 feet of fence. They want to split it, but Harry is getting 60 feet more than Sam. So essentially, Harry's share is Sam's share plus 60 feet. I need to find out how much Sam gets, and then figure out if there's any leftover. Wait, but the total is 100 feet, so if Harry is getting 60 more than Sam, the leftover would be after distributing the extra 60 feet. Hmm, maybe not. Let me try to break it down.

Let me denote Sam's share as S. Then Harry's share would be S + 60. Since together they have 100 feet, the sum of their shares should be 100. So, S + (S + 60) = 100. Let me write that down:

S + S + 60 = 100

Simplify:

2S + 60 = 100

Now, subtract 60 from both sides:

2S = 100 - 60

2S = 40

Then divide both sides by 2:

S = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet. Then Harry gets 20 + 60 = 80 feet. Let me check: 20 + 80 = 100, which matches the total fence they have. So, Sam gets 20 feet, Harry gets 80 feet, and there is no leftover fence. The leftover would be zero because the total is exactly 100 feet.

Wait, but the question says "how much is left over for Sam." If Sam is supposed to get 20 feet, why would there be leftover? Maybe I misread the question. Let me read it again.

"If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?"

Wait, perhaps the initial 100 feet is what they have to split, but maybe Sam is supposed to have some leftover? Hmm, maybe I need to interpret this differently. Maybe the 100 feet is the total, and when they split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, there's some leftover. But in my calculation, there's no leftover. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that they have 100 feet between them, so perhaps they are building something where they need to split the fence, but each has a specific area or something. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the fence is divided into two parts, one for Sam, one for Harry, with Harry's part being longer by 60 feet, and the total fence is 100 feet. So, perhaps I should write the equations as:

Sam's fence: S

Harry's fence: S + 60

Total: S + (S + 60) = 100

So, 2S + 60 = 100

2S = 40

S = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet, Harry gets 80 feet. Total fence used is 100 feet, so no leftover. So, the leftover is zero.

Is that the case? Or is there a mistake in my thinking? Let me think about it another way.

Suppose Sam and Harry need to split the fence, with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam. So, if I imagine the fence as a single unit, they need to divide it into two parts, one for each, where Harry's part is longer by 60. So, if Sam gets 20, Harry gets 80, which adds up to 100.

Alternatively, maybe they have 100 feet, and they decide to split it such that one has 60 feet more than the other, but maybe the 100 feet is just the total, so if we subtract 60 from the total, we have 40, which is split equally? Wait, no, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another approach: If Harry is getting 60 feet more than Sam, then the difference between their shares is 60 feet. So, the larger share (Harry's) is Sam's share plus 60. So, if I let S be Sam's share, then Harry's share is S + 60.

Total fence is S + (S + 60) = 2S + 60 = 100.

So, 2S = 40, so S = 20. Then Harry's share is 80. So, the total fence is 100, so all the fence is used, so there's nothing left over.

So, the leftover for Sam is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem says "how much is left over for Sam." Maybe it's a trick question where there's no leftover because all the fence is distributed as per the agreement.

Wait, let me consider another perspective. Maybe 'split' doesn't mean dividing into two parts but something else. But in the context of fences, split usually means dividing into two parts. So, if they have 100 feet, and they split it so that Harry gets 60 more than Sam, then Sam gets 20, Harry gets 80, total 100. So, no leftover.

Alternatively, maybe the fence is 100 feet between them, meaning that the fence is divided into two parts, one from each person, with Harry's part being longer by 60. So, same as before.

I don't think there's any leftover. So, the leftover is zero. So, the answer is zero.

Wait, but let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem. Maybe the 100 feet is the total fence they have, and they are splitting it such that each gets some, but the split is 60 feet more for Harry. So, maybe the leftover is the difference? But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking how much is left over after Sam gets his share, but that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equations. Let me try again.

If Sam gets S feet, then Harry gets S + 60 feet. Together, that's S + S + 60 = 2S + 60.

They have 100 feet total, so 2S + 60 = 100.

Solving for S: 2S = 40, so S = 20.

Therefore, Sam gets 20 feet, Harry gets 80 feet.

Total fence used is 100, so leftover is 0.

So, the leftover is 0. So, the answer is 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a bit ambiguous. Maybe it's not that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, but that the split is 60 feet, with Harry getting more. But that interpretation doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the fence is being split such that each gets a portion, and the difference is 60 feet. So, if you have two parts, one is S, the other is S + 60, total is 100. So, same as before.

Therefore, I think the leftover is zero. So, Sam gets 20 feet, and there is nothing left over.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that the fence is 100 feet between them, meaning that it's a fence between two people, like a garden fence or something, and they want to split it so that Harry has 60 feet more than Sam. So, again, the same problem.

Wait, maybe the question is asking how much is left over for Sam after Harry takes his share? But that doesn't make sense because Sam is the one getting his share.

Wait, perhaps the wording is tricky. Maybe it's saying that they have 100 feet of fence between them, meaning that the fence is 100 feet long, and they split it such that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. So, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the 100 feet is the total fence, but they are splitting it into two parts, one for each, with the difference being 60. So, same equations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that they have 100 feet of fencing material, and they are building something where they need to split it into two parts, Sam's part and Harry's part, with Harry's part being 60 feet longer than Sam's. So, same problem.

In that case, total fencing is 100 feet, so Sam's fence plus Harry's fence is 100 feet, and Harry's fence is 60 feet more than Sam's. So, equations as before.

So, Sam gets 20 feet, Harry gets 80 feet, total 100. No leftover.

Therefore, the leftover is 0.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that they have 100 feet, and when they split it, they can't agree, so there's leftover.

Wait, but the problem says they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam. So, they are able to split it that way, so there's no leftover. So, the leftover is 0.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the wording: "split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam." Maybe they have 100 feet, and when they split it, the total for Harry is 60 feet more than Sam. So, same as before.

Hmm, so I think the answer is 0.

Wait, but the problem says "how much is left over for Sam?" Maybe it's a trick question where the answer is zero because all the fence is allocated as per the agreement. So, Sam gets 20 feet, Harry gets 80 feet, and there's nothing left.

Wait, but the phrasing is "how much is left over for Sam?" Maybe it's trying to trick you into thinking that perhaps some fence is leftover for other purposes, but in reality, the 100 feet is split as per the agreement, so nothing is leftover. So, the leftover is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the 100 feet is the total length they have, but when they split it, they have some leftover because the split is not equal.

But in this case, the split is unequal, but they use up all the fence. So, no leftover.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the wording: "split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam." Maybe they have 100 feet, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, which would require 100 feet, so no leftover.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just solve it step by step.

Total fence: 100 feet.

Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

Let Sam's share = S

Then Harry's share = S + 60

Total fence: S + (S + 60) = 100

Simplify: 2S + 60 = 100

Subtract 60: 2S = 40

Divide by 2: S = 20

So, Sam's share is 20 feet. Then Harry's share is 20 + 60 = 80 feet.

Total used: 20 + 80 = 100 feet.

Leftover: 100 - 100 = 0 feet.

Therefore, the leftover is 0 feet.

So, the answer is 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking how much is left over after Sam takes his share, but that seems different.

Wait, if the question is asking how much is left over for Sam after splitting, maybe it's the same as his share. But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking how much is leftover for something else, but the problem doesn't specify.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem says "how much is left over for Sam?" Given that Sam is getting 20 feet, and the total is 100 feet, so the leftover is 0.

Alternatively, maybe "left over" is a mistranslation or misphrasing. Maybe it's supposed to be "left after splitting," but in that case, again, it's 0.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the fence is 100 feet, and they are splitting it such that each has a portion, but the difference between their portions is 60 feet. So, in that case, the larger portion is Harry's, which is 80, Sam's is 20, so nothing is left. So, leftover is 0.

Alternatively, maybe if the fence was more than 100 feet, but no, they have 100 feet.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way I'm interpreting "split." Maybe splitting it means dividing into two parts, but if the difference is 60, then the total is 100, so leftover is 0.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in another language, and "split" has a different connotation. But in English, "split" means dividing into parts.

Wait, let me think differently. Suppose the fence is 100 feet, and they are splitting it into two parts, with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam. So, Sam gets S, Harry gets S + 60. Together, that's 2S + 60 = 100.

So, S = 20, Harry gets 80. So, all the fence is used. So, leftover is 0.

Thus, the answer is 0.

Wait, maybe the question is a trick question to see if I fall into the trap of thinking that all the fence is used, so leftover is 0. But maybe in reality, if they can't agree, there is leftover, but in this case, they do agree. So, leftover is 0.

Therefore, I think the answer is 0. So, the leftover for Sam is 0 feet.

**Final Answer**
The leftover for Sam is \boxed{0} feet.
</think>

Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence. They agree to split it such that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we denote Sam's share as \( S \). Then Harry's share is \( S + 60 \).

The equation for the total fence is:
\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Simplifying this equation:
\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Subtracting 60 from both sides:
\[
2S = 40
\]

Dividing by 2:
\[
S = 20
\]

Thus, Sam gets 20 feet, and Harry gets \( 20 + 60 = 80 \) feet. The total fence used is 100 feet, so there is no leftover.

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
