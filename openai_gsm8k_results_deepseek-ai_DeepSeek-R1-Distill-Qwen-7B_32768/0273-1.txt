Question:
John decides to build a program capable of identifying cancer cells.  He gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.  His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.  How much did his research cost?

Correct Answer:
The research ended up taking 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 months
So he paid for expensive research for 50-5=<<50-5=45>>45 months
Each month of research at the cheaper stage cost 100,000/5=$<<100000/5=20000>>20,000
So the more expensive research cost 20,000*1.5=$<<20000*1.5=30000>>30,000
So that research cost 45*30,000=$<<45*30000=1350000>>1,350,000
So the total cost was 1,350,000+100,000=$<<1350000+100000=1450000>>1,450,000

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out how much John's research cost in total. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says John gets an initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. That part is straightforward—I'll note that down as the starting point.

Now, it says his research ends up taking 10 times that long. Hmm, so the initial funding period was 5 months, so the total duration of the research must be 10 times 5 months, right? Let me calculate that. 10 multiplied by 5 is 50. So, the research took 50 months in total.

Wait, hold on. The problem mentions that the first 5 months were funded at $100,000. Then, after those first 5 months, each month took 50% more funding per month. Hmm, so I need to clarify whether the initial $100,000 is for the first 5 months, and then each subsequent month after that is 50% more than the initial $100,000 per month?

Or is it that after the first 5 months, the funding per month increases by 50% each month? That would be a different calculation. Let me read it again.

"His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month."

Hmm, so the first 5 months are $100,000. Then, each month after that, funding is 50% more per month. Wait, that phrasing is a bit confusing. Does that mean each month after the first 5, the total funding per month increases by 50%? Or does it mean that each month after the first 5, the funding per month is 50% more than the previous month?

Wait, actually, let me parse the sentence again: "every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month."

Hmm, "took 50% more funding per month." So, does that mean that each subsequent month, the funding per month is 1.5 times the previous month's funding? Or is it that each month after the first 5, the total funding is 50% more than the initial $100,000?

Wait, the initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months. So, that's a total funding of $100,000, but per month, that would be $20,000 per month. Then, each month after that, it's 50% more per month.

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me think.

If it's saying that for each month after the first 5, the funding per month is 50% more than the initial $100,000, that could be interpreted as each subsequent month's funding is 1.5 times $100,000, which would be $150,000 per month. But that seems like a huge jump, and it's only for 45 more months? That would make the total cost extremely high.

Alternatively, it could be that each month after the first 5, the per-month funding increases by 50% relative to the previous month. So, starting from the 6th month, each month's funding is 1.5 times the previous month's funding.

That seems more reasonable because it's a percentage increase each month.

So, let me go with that interpretation. The first 5 months: $100,000 total, which is $20,000 per month.

Then, starting from month 6, each month's funding is 50% more than the previous month. So, month 6 would be $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000.

Month 7: $30,000 * 1.5 = $45,000.

Month 8: $45,000 * 1.5 = $67,500.

And so on, until month 50.

Wait, but 50 months in total. So, 50 months of research, with the first 5 months at $20,000 per month, and each subsequent month increasing by 50% from the previous month.

So, to calculate the total cost, I need to compute the total funding for the first 5 months and then add the total funding for months 6 through 50.

First, the initial 5 months: 5 * $20,000 = $100,000. Got that.

Now, months 6 to 50: that's 45 months. Each month's funding is 50% more than the previous month. So, starting at $30,000 in month 6, then $45,000, $67,500, etc.

This is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 1.5 each month. So, the total funding for these 45 months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a1 * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1), where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a1 is $30,000, r is 1.5, and n is 45.

So, plugging in the numbers, S = 30,000 * (1.5^45 - 1) / (1.5 - 1).

Calculating that, let's see.

First, let me compute 1.5^45. That's a huge number. I might need to use logarithms or a calculator. But since this is a thought process, I can approximate it.

I know that 1.5^10 is about 57.665, 1.5^20 is about (57.665)^2 ≈ 3325.25, 1.5^30 is about 3325.25 * 57.665 ≈ 192,000, and 1.5^40 is about 192,000 * 57.665 ≈ 11,059,200. Then, 1.5^45 is 1.5^40 * 1.5^5. 1.5^5 is 7.59375, so 11,059,200 * 7.59375 ≈ 83,890,625.

Wait, that seems extremely high, but maybe that's correct.

So, 1.5^45 ≈ 83,890,625.

Then, S = 30,000 * (83,890,625 - 1) / (0.5) = 30,000 * (83,890,624 / 0.5) = 30,000 * 167,781,248 ≈ 5,033,437,440.

Wait, that seems way too high. Maybe my approximation of 1.5^45 is way off.

Alternatively, let me think: 1.5^10 is approximately 57.66, as I said before. So 1.5^20 is about 57.66^2 ≈ 3325. Then, 1.5^30 is 3325 * 57.66 ≈ 192,000. 1.5^40 is 192,000 * 57.66 ≈ 11,059,200. Then, 1.5^45 is 11,059,200 * (1.5)^5.

We know that 1.5^5 is 7.59375, so multiplying that by 11,059,200:

11,059,200 * 7.59375 ≈ 11,059,200 * 7.5 = 82,944,000 plus 11,059,200 * 0.09375 ≈ 1,038,240, so total ≈ 83,982,240.

So, 1.5^45 ≈ 83,982,240.

Then, S = 30,000 * (83,982,240 - 1) / 0.5 ≈ 30,000 * 83,982,239 / 0.5 ≈ 30,000 * 167,964,478 ≈ 5,038,934,340.

So, approximately $5,038,934,340 for months 6 to 50.

Adding that to the initial $100,000, the total cost is approximately $5,038,934,340 + $100,000 ≈ $5,039,034,340.

Wait, that seems incredibly high. Is this correct? It feels like a lot, but considering the exponential growth each month, it might add up.

But let me double-check my calculations because maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the funding.

Alternatively, maybe the initial $100,000 is for the entire 5 months, so $20,000 per month. Then, each subsequent month, the funding per month increases by 50%. So, each month after the first 5, the funding is 1.5 times the previous month.

So, that would mean:

Month 6: 20,000 * 1.5 = 30,000

Month 7: 30,000 * 1.5 = 45,000

Month 8: 45,000 * 1.5 = 67,500

And so on, each month the funding is 1.5 times the previous month.

So, the series is geometric with a1 = 30,000, r = 1.5, n = 45.

So, the sum is S = 30,000 * (1.5^45 - 1) / (1.5 - 1) ≈ 30,000 * (83,982,240 - 1) / 0.5 ≈ 30,000 * 83,982,239 / 0.5 ≈ 30,000 * 167,964,478 ≈ 5,038,934,340.

So, yes, that seems consistent.

But to get a better sense, let's compute a few terms manually and see if the growth seems reasonable.

First month after 5 months: $30,000

Second month: $45,000

Third month: $67,500

Fourth month: $101,250

Fifth month: $151,875

Sixth month: $227,812.50

Seventh month: $341,718.75

Eighth month: $512,578.125

Ninth month: $768,867.1875

Tenth month: $1,153,300.78125

So, by the 10th month, the funding per month is already over a million dollars. That seems extremely high, but it's an exponential growth, so it does escalate quickly.

Given that, over 45 months, the total funding would indeed be in the billions, which, when added to the initial $100,000, is about $5.04 billion.

But wait, is John's research taking 10 times the initial 5 months, totaling 50 months? So, 50 months is about 4 years and 2 months. That's a very long time for a research project, and getting into the billions seems unrealistic, but maybe it's a hypothetical problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial funding is $100,000 spread over 5 months, so $20,000 per month. Then, each month after that, the total funding is 50% more than the total funding in the previous month. So, each month after 5, the total funding increases by 50%.

Wait, that interpretation is different. Let me see.

If it's 50% more funding each month relative to the previous month's total, then it's a different calculation.

So, first 5 months: $20,000 per month, total $100,000.

Then, month 6: total funding is 1.5 times month 5's total. Wait, but month 5's total is $20,000, so month 6 would be $30,000.

Then, month 7: 1.5 times month 6's total, so $45,000.

Month 8: 1.5 times $45,000 = $67,500.

Wait, that's actually the same as before—the geometric series with a1 = 30,000, r = 1.5.

So, regardless of whether it's per month or total, the calculation ends up the same, because the per month funding is increasing by 50% each month.

So, in that case, the total funding for months 6 through 50 is approximately $5.04 billion, plus the initial $100,000, totaling approximately $5.04004 billion.

But that's an astronomically high cost for a cancer research project. Maybe the problem is intended to be a mathematical exercise regardless of real-world feasibility.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of months. The problem says the research ends up taking 10 times that long. The initial funding was for the first 5 months, so 10 times that would be 5 * 10 = 50 months. So, 50 months in total.

But wait, the first 5 months are already covered by the initial $100,000. So, the remaining 45 months are after that.

So, yes, 45 months after the first 5 months, each with 50% more funding than the previous month.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe the 50% increase is per month on top of the initial $100,000. So, each subsequent month, the total funding is $100,000 + 50% of $100,000 = $150,000. But that would make it a flat $150,000 per month, which doesn't make sense because it's supposed to increase.

Wait, that interpretation wouldn't make sense because it's supposed to increase each month. So, that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the $50% increase is on top of the previous month's total. So, each month after the first 5, the funding is previous month's funding plus 50% of that.

Which is the same as multiplying by 1.5 each month, which is what I did earlier.

So, given all that, unless I made a mistake in the exponent calculation, the total funding is about $5.04 billion.

Wait, let me check the exponent again.

1.5^45: let's calculate it step by step.

We know that 1.5^10 ≈ 57.66

1.5^20 = (1.5^10)^2 ≈ 57.66^2 ≈ 3325

1.5^30 = 3325 * 57.66 ≈ 192,000

1.5^40 = 192,000 * 57.66 ≈ 11,059,200

1.5^45 = 11,059,200 * (1.5)^5

1.5^5 = 7.59375

So, 11,059,200 * 7.59375 ≈ 11,059,200 * 7.5 = 82,944,000

Plus 11,059,200 * 0.09375 ≈ 1,038,240

Total ≈ 82,944,000 + 1,038,240 ≈ 83,982,240

So, 1.5^45 ≈ 83,982,240

Therefore, S = 30,000 * (83,982,240 - 1) / 0.5 ≈ 30,000 * 83,982,239 / 0.5 ≈ 30,000 * 167,964,478 ≈ 5,038,934,340

So, that's approximately $5,038,934,340 for months 6 through 50.

Adding the initial $100,000: total cost ≈ $5,038,934,340 + $100,000 ≈ $5,039,034,340

So, approximately $5.04 billion.

But let me cross-verify with another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the per month funding increases by 50% each month, meaning each month's funding is 1.5 times the previous month's.

So, starting at $30,000 in month 6, then $45,000, $67,500, etc.

So, the total for 45 months is the sum of a geometric series with a1 = 30,000, r = 1.5, n = 45.

Sum = 30,000 * (1.5^45 - 1) / (1.5 - 1)

Which is the same as before, leading to approximately $5.04 billion.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the total funding per month increases by 50% each month after the first 5. So, starting at $20,000, then $30,000, $45,000, etc. But that's the same as before.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of months.

Wait, total duration is 50 months. The first 5 months are at $20,000 per month. Then, starting from month 6, each month's funding is 50% more than the previous month.

So, it's a geometric series with 45 terms, starting at 30,000, ratio 1.5.

So, the sum is 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/(1.5 -1). As above.

Therefore, the total funding is approximately $5.04 billion.

So, unless the problem expects a different interpretation, this seems to be the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the 50% increase is applied to the total funding so far each month. But that would be a different calculation.

Wait, if each month after the first 5, the total funding is 50% more than the previous month's total. So, month 6: total funding is 1.5*month5.

But month5's total funding is $20,000, so month6 would be $30,000.

Then month7: 1.5*month6 = $45,000.

And so on, which is the same as before.

So, it's the same calculation.

Thus, the total cost would be approximately $5.04 billion.

But let me check if there's another way to interpret the problem.

"every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month."

So, "took 50% more funding per month"—could that mean that each subsequent month, the funding is 50% more than the per month funding of the first month? That would be a flat 50% increase, but that wouldn't make sense because it's supposed to increase each month.

Alternatively, maybe each subsequent month, the funding is 50% more than the previous month's per month funding, which is the same as before.

So, in that case, the calculation remains.

Alternatively, maybe it's 50% more funding per month than the initial $100,000.

Wait, the initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months, so $20,000 per month.

If each subsequent month, the funding is 50% more than $20,000, that would be $30,000 per month. But that would be a flat rate, not increasing each month. So, that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe each subsequent month, the funding is 50% more than the previous month's, which would be the same as the geometric series.

Therefore, I think the initial interpretation is correct.

Therefore, the total cost is approximately $5,039,034,340.

But given that, I should express the exact value rather than the approximate one.

Given that, the exact value is 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/0.5.

But 1.5^45 is a huge number, so maybe we can write it in terms of exponents.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an exact expression rather than a numerical approximation.

But let me think again.

Wait, months 6 through 50: 45 months.

So, the total funding is 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/(1.5 -1) = 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/0.5 = 60,000*(1.5^45 -1)

So, 60,000*(1.5^45 -1). So, the total funding is 60,000*(1.5^45 -1).

Given that 1.5^45 is approximately 83,982,240, as calculated before, so 60,000*(83,982,240 -1) ≈ 60,000*83,982,239 ≈ 5,038,934,340.

So, that's consistent.

Therefore, the total cost is approximately $5,038,934,340.

Adding the initial $100,000 gives $5,039,034,340.

So, rounding to the nearest dollar, it's approximately $5,039,034,340.

But since the problem didn't specify the need for an exact figure or a rounded figure, and given that it's a hypothetical scenario, perhaps we can leave it in terms of the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an exact figure using exponents.

But given that 1.5^45 is a specific number, we can compute it more precisely.

Alternatively, use logarithms to compute 1.5^45 more accurately.

Wait, let's try that.

We can use natural logarithm:

ln(1.5^45) = 45*ln(1.5) ≈ 45*0.4054651 ≈ 18.24593

Then, e^18.24593 ≈ e^18 * e^0.24593.

We know that e^10 ≈ 22026.4658, so e^18 = e^(10+8) = e^10 * e^8 ≈ 22026.4658 * 2980.911 ≈ 22026.4658 * 3000 ≈ 66,079,397.4, but more accurately, 22026.4658 * 2980.911 ≈ 65,659,868.

Then, e^0.24593 ≈ 1.278.

So, e^18.24593 ≈ 65,659,868 * 1.278 ≈ 83,835,206.

So, 1.5^45 ≈ 83,835,206.

Therefore, S = 30,000*(83,835,206 -1)/0.5 = 30,000*83,835,205 /0.5 = 60,000*83,835,205 ≈ 5,030,112,300.

Wait, but this is different from the previous calculation.

Wait, perhaps my initial estimation was off because of the approximate value of e^18.24593.

Wait, let's compute 45*ln(1.5) more accurately.

ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4054651081.

45 * 0.4054651081 ≈ 18.24593.

Then, e^18.24593.

But e^18 is approximately 65,659,868. So, e^18.24593 = e^18 * e^0.24593 ≈ 65,659,868 * 1.278 ≈ 83,835,206.

So, 1.5^45 ≈ 83,835,206.

Thus, S = 30,000*(83,835,206 - 1)/0.5 ≈ 30,000*83,835,205 /0.5 ≈ 60,000*83,835,205 ≈ 5,030,112,300.

Wait, so approximately $5,030,112,300, which is slightly less than the previous $5.04 billion.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps my initial approximation of 1.5^45 as 83,982,240 was slightly off.

But in reality, using logarithms, it's approximately 83,835,206.

So, perhaps 83,835,206 is more accurate.

Therefore, the exact value is 60,000*(83,835,206 -1) = 60,000*83,835,205 ≈ 5,030,112,300.

So, approximately $5,030,112,300.

But in any case, it's roughly around $5.03 billion.

So, the total cost would be approximately $5.03 billion.

But to make sure, let's compute 1.5^45 more precisely.

Alternatively, use the fact that 1.5^10 ≈ 57.665, 1.5^20 ≈ 57.665^2 ≈ 3325.256, 1.5^30 ≈ 3325.256 * 57.665 ≈ 192,000.000, 1.5^40 ≈ 192,000 * 57.665 ≈ 11,059, 200.000, and 1.5^45 ≈ 11,059,200 * (1.5)^5.

1.5^5 is 7.59375.

So, 11,059,200 * 7.59375.

Compute 11,059,200 * 7 = 77,414,400

11,059,200 * 0.59375 = Let's compute 11,059,200 * 0.5 = 5,529,600

11,059,200 * 0.09375 = approximately 11,059,200 * 0.1 = 1,105,920; subtract 11,059,200 * 0.00625 = ~69,120. So, 1,105,920 - 69,120 ≈ 1,036,800.

So, total 5,529,600 + 1,036,800 ≈ 6,566,400.

Thus, total 77,414,400 + 6,566,400 ≈ 83,980,800.

So, 1.5^45 ≈ 83,980,800.

Therefore, S = 30,000*(83,980,800 -1)/0.5 ≈ 30,000*83,980,799 /0.5 ≈ 60,000*83,980,799 ≈ 5,038,847,940.

So, approximately $5,038,847,940.

Therefore, the total cost is approximately $5,038,847,940.

Adding the initial $100,000, we get approximately $5,038,947,940.

So, about $5,038,947,940.

But let me confirm with another method.

Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

Sum = a1*(r^n - 1)/(r -1)

Here, a1 = 30,000, r = 1.5, n = 45.

So, Sum = 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/(1.5 -1) = 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/0.5 = 60,000*(1.5^45 -1)

As above, 1.5^45 ≈ 83,980,800.

So, Sum ≈ 60,000*(83,980,800 -1) ≈ 60,000*83,980,799 ≈ 5,038,847,940.

So, same result.

Thus, the total funding for the research is approximately $5,038,847,940 plus the initial $100,000, totaling approximately $5,038,947,940.

Given that, I can write the final answer as approximately $5,038,947,940.

But let me check if the problem expects an exact figure or if there's a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the number of months.

Wait, the first 5 months are at $100,000, then each subsequent month, the total is 50% more than the previous month.

Wait, so first 5 months: $20,000 per month.

Then, month 6: total funding is 1.5 times month5's total.

But month5's total is $20,000.

So, month6: 1.5 * 20,000 = $30,000.

Then, month7: 1.5 * 30,000 = $45,000.

Month8: 1.5 *45,000 = $67,500.

And so on.

Thus, the total funding is the sum of the first 5 months: 5*20,000 = 100,000.

Plus the sum from month6 to month50: 45 terms, starting at 30,000, ratio 1.5.

So, sum = 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/(1.5 -1) ≈ 30,000*(83,980,800 -1)/0.5 ≈ same as before.

So, same calculation.

Thus, I think the answer is approximately $5,038,947,940.

But let me check: 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/0.5.

1.5^45 ≈ 83,980,800.

So, 30,000*(83,980,800 -1) = 30,000*83,980,799 ≈ 2,519,423,970.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 30,000 * 83,980,799 is 2,519,423,970,000? Wait, no, 30,000 * 83,980,799 is 2,519,423,970,000? Wait, that can't be.

Wait, 30,000 * 83,980,799 is 30,000 * 83,980,799.

Wait, 30,000 * 80,000,000 = 2,400,000,000,000.

30,000 * 3,980,799 ≈ 30,000 * 4,000,000 ≈ 120,000,000,000.

So, approximately 2,520,000,000,000.

Then, divided by 0.5, that's 5,040,000,000,000.

Wait, that seems too high.

Wait, no, the formula is:

Sum = 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/0.5.

Which is 30,000*(83,980,800 -1)/0.5 = 30,000*83,980,799 /0.5.

Which is 30,000*83,980,799 *2 = 60,000*83,980,799 ≈ 5,038,847,940,000.

Wait, no, no. Wait, 30,000*83,980,799 is 2,519,423,970,000.

Then, divided by 0.5 is multiplying by 2, so 2,519,423,970,000 *2 = 5,038,847,940,000.

Wait, that seems correct.

But 5,038,847,940,000 is 5.038 trillion, which is an extremely high cost for a research project.

But given the exponential growth, it's mathematically correct.

Therefore, unless the problem expects a different interpretation, perhaps it's intended to be a straightforward calculation regardless of the realism.

Therefore, I think the total cost is approximately $5,038,847,940.

Adding the initial $100,000, the total is approximately $5,038,947,940.

But since the problem is asking for the total cost, and the initial $100,000 is already included in the first 5 months, I think we should not add it again.

Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months. Then, each subsequent month after that, the funding per month increases by 50%. So, the first 5 months: $100,000 total, $20,000 per month.

Then, starting from month 6, each month's funding is 50% more than the previous month.

Thus, the initial $100,000 is part of the total cost, plus the subsequent 45 months' funding.

Therefore, the total cost is $100,000 + sum from month6 to month50.

Which is 100,000 + 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/0.5 ≈ 100,000 + 5,038,847,940 ≈ 5,038,947,940.

Therefore, the total cost is approximately $5,038,947,940.

But let me see if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial $100,000 is for the first 5 months, and then each subsequent month, the total funding is 50% more than the previous month's total.

So, that would mean:

Month 1-5: $20,000 each, total $100,000.

Month 6: total funding is 1.5*month5 = 1.5*20,000 = $30,000.

Month 7: 1.5*month6 = $45,000.

And so on.

Therefore, the total cost is $100,000 + sum from month6 to month50.

Which is $100,000 + 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/0.5 ≈ 5,038,947,940.

Thus, same as before.

Therefore, the total cost is approximately $5,038,947,940.

But since the problem is in dollars, and it's a math problem, it's likely expecting an exact figure, which would be expressed as 100,000 + 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/0.5.

But perhaps we can write it in terms of exponentials.

Alternatively, maybe it's expecting the answer in dollars with commas for readability.

So, approximately $5,038,947,940, or $5,038,947,940.00.

But let me just recap to make sure.

Total duration: 50 months.

First 5 months: $20,000 each, total $100,000.

Subsequent 45 months: each month's funding is 50% more than the previous month.

So, it's a geometric series with first term 30,000, ratio 1.5, 45 terms.

Sum = 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/(1.5 -1) = 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/0.5.

1.5^45 ≈ 83,980,800.

Thus, sum ≈ 30,000*(83,980,800)/0.5 ≈ 30,000*167,961,600 ≈ 5,038,848,000.

Thus, total funding is $100,000 + $5,038,848,000 ≈ $5,038,948,000.

So, approximately $5,038,948,000.

Therefore, rounding appropriately, it's about $5,039,000,000.

But to be precise, it's approximately $5,038,948,000.

Given that, I think the problem expects the answer in dollars, possibly rounded to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the total cost is approximately $5,038,948,000.

So, in boxed form, that would be \boxed{5038948000}.

But wait, let me check once more.

Wait, 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/0.5.

1.5^45 ≈ 83,980,800.

So, (83,980,800 -1) ≈ 83,980,799.

Then, 30,000 * 83,980,799 ≈ 2,519,423,970,000.

Divide by 0.5: 2,519,423,970,000 / 0.5 = 5,038,847,940,000.

Wait, no, wait: 30,000 * 83,980,799 = 2,519,423,970,000.

Then, 2,519,423,970,000 / 0.5 = 5,038,847,940,000.

Wait, that's $5,038,847,940,000.

But that's 5.038 trillion dollars, which is way too high.

Wait, this is inconsistent with the earlier calculation.

Wait, in the formula, it's 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/0.5.

So, 30,000*(83,980,800 -1)/0.5 = 30,000*83,980,799 /0.5.

Which is 30,000 * 83,980,799 * 2.

So, 30,000 * 83,980,799 = 2,519,423,970,000.

Then, multiplied by 2 is 5,038,847,940,000.

Wait, so that would be 5.038 trillion.

But that seems too high.

Wait, but 1.5^45 is about 84 billion, so 30,000*84 billion is 2.52 trillion, divided by 0.5 is 5.04 trillion. So, that seems correct.

But 5.04 trillion dollars is an enormous amount, way beyond what any research project would need.

So, perhaps the problem is expecting a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the 50% increase is applied monthly on the initial $100,000, rather than on the previous month's total.

Wait, that is, the initial funding is $100,000 for the first five months. Then, each subsequent month, the funding is 50% more than the initial $100,000.

But that would mean each subsequent month, the funding is $150,000.

But that can't be, because that would be an exponential increase but only 50% per month.

Wait, no, if each month after the first five, it's 50% more than the initial $100,000, then every month after month5 is $150,000.

But that seems contradictory because the problem says "50% more funding per month."

Hmm, maybe the problem is intended to have the total funding per month after the first five being 50% more than the initial $100,000, which would be $150,000 per month.

But 45 months at $150,000 would be 45*150,000 = $6,750,000.

Adding the initial $100,000, total funding is $6,850,000.

But that seems more reasonable.

But that would mean the problem is interpreted differently: after the initial five months, each month's funding is 50% more than the initial $100,000.

So, each subsequent month's funding is $150,000.

But that seems like a flat rate, not exponential.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 50% more than the previous month's funding, meaning exponential.

But in that case, the numbers are as above.

But given that, the answer can vary depending on interpretation.

Given that, perhaps the problem is intended to have a monthly increase of 50% on the initial $100,000, meaning $150,000 per month.

So, 45 months * $150,000 = $6,750,000.

Adding the initial $100,000, total is $6,850,000.

But that seems more plausible.

But the problem says "50% more funding per month," which is ambiguous.

In financial terms, "50% more funding" could mean 50% of the initial funding, or 50% of the previous month's funding.

But in the context of a research project, it's more likely to mean that each month's funding is 50% more than the previous month's, leading to exponential growth.

But given that, the total is about $5.04 billion, which is too high.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different reading.

Wait, let me read the problem again:

"John decides to build a program capable of identifying cancer cells. He gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first those five took took 50% more funding per month. How much did his research cost?"

Wait, maybe I misread the "10 times that long."

Wait, "His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first those five took took 50% more funding per month."

Wait, perhaps it's supposed to be "His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first five took took 50% more funding per month."

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it should be "His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first five months took took 50% more funding per month."

But regardless, the duration is 10 times the initial 5 months, so 50 months.

So, I think my initial interpretation is correct.

Therefore, I think the answer is approximately $5,038,947,940.

But, to check, perhaps I can use another approach.

If I think of the total cost as:

First 5 months: 5 * $20,000 = $100,000.

Then, from month6 to month50: 45 months.

Each month's funding is 50% more than the previous month's.

So, the first term a1 = 30,000, ratio r = 1.5, n = 45.

Sum S = a1*(r^n -1)/(r -1) = 30,000*(1.5^45 -1)/(1.5 -1) ≈ same as before.

So, same calculation.

Thus, same result.

Therefore, I think the answer is approximately $5,038,947,940.

But to present it in a more concise form, perhaps rounded to the nearest million is $5,039,000,000.

But unless the problem specifies, I think the exact figure is preferable.

Therefore, I think the total cost is \boxed{5038947940}.

**Final Answer**
The total cost of John's research is \boxed{5038947940} dollars.
</think>

John's research project starts with an initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months. The research ends up taking 10 times that long, totaling 50 months. After the first 5 months, each subsequent month's funding increases by 50% per month.

1. The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000, which is $20,000 per month.
2. The total funding for the first 5 months is:
   \[
   5 \times 20,000 = 100,000
   \]
3. The research duration is 10 times the initial 5 months, totaling 50 months.
4. After the first 5 months, each subsequent month's funding increases by 50%. This forms a geometric series with the first term \(a_1 = 30,000\) (since the 6th month's funding is 1.5 times the 5th month's $20,000) and a common ratio \(r = 1.5\). The number of terms is 45 (from month 6 to month 50).
5. The sum of the geometric series is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = a_1 \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
   \]
   where \(n = 45\).
6. Calculating the sum:
   \[
   S = 30,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1}
   \]
   \[
   S = 30,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{0.5}
   \]
   \[
   S = 60,000 (1.5^{45} - 1)
   \]
7. Using logarithms to approximate \(1.5^{45}\):
   \[
   \ln(1.5^{45}) = 45 \ln(1.5) \approx 45 \times 0.405465 \approx 18.24593
   \]
   \[
   e^{18.24593} \approx 83,982,206
   \]
8. Therefore, \(1.5^{45} \approx 83,982,206\).
9. Substituting back into the sum formula:
   \[
   S = 60,000 (83,982,206 - 1) \approx 60,000 \times 83,982,205 \approx 5,038,932,300
   \]
10. Adding the initial $100,000 funding:
    \[
    \text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 5,038,932,300 \approx 5,038,942,300
    \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is \boxed{5038947940} dollars.
