Question:
A landscaping company is delivering flagstones to a customer’s yard. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip?

Correct Answer:
The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.
Thus, the landscaping company will need 6000 / 2000 = <<6000/2000=3>>3 trucks to transport the flagstones in one trip.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem here about a landscaping company delivering flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and the trucks can carry a total of 2000 pounds. I need to figure out how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First off, I think I need to calculate the total weight of all 80 flagstones. Since each one is 75 pounds, I can just multiply the number of flagstones by the weight per flagstone. That should give me the total weight. Let me write that down:

Total weight = Number of flagstones × Weight per flagstone
Total weight = 80 × 75

Hmm, 80 multiplied by 75. Let me do that multiplication. 75 times 80 is... 75 times 8 is 600, and since 80 is 8 times 10, I can just add a zero to 600, which makes 6000. So, 80 flagstones weigh 6000 pounds in total. Okay, that seems right.

Now, each truck can carry 2000 pounds. So, I need to figure out how many 2000-pound trucks are needed to handle 6000 pounds. That sounds like a division problem. I should divide the total weight by the truck capacity to see how many trucks are needed.

Number of trucks = Total weight ÷ Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 ÷ 2000

6000 divided by 2000. Well, 2000 goes into 6000 three times because 2000 times 3 is 6000. So, does that mean I need three trucks? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check my work to be sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, double-checking: 80 flagstones at 75 pounds each is indeed 6000 pounds. Each truck can carry 2000 pounds. Dividing 6000 by 2000 gives 3. So, three trucks should be enough. Hmm, but wait, is there a possibility that a truck can't be partially loaded? Because sometimes, if the division doesn't come out even, you have to round up. But in this case, 6000 divided by 2000 is exactly 3, so no need to round up. So, three trucks are sufficient.

Hold on, let me think again. The problem says "how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip." So, if each truck can carry 2000 pounds, and all 80 flagstones together weigh 6000, which is exactly three times 2000. So, three trucks each carrying 2000 pounds would exactly transport all the flagstones in one trip. That makes sense.

But just to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors, let me recalculate the total weight:

80 flagstones × 75 pounds per flagstone. Let me do 80 × 70 first, which is 5600, and then 80 × 5, which is 400. So, 5600 + 400 = 6000. Yep, that's correct.

And the truck capacity is 2000 pounds. So, 2000 × 3 = 6000. Perfect, that's exactly the total weight needed to be transported. So, no leftovers, no partial trucks needed because the division was perfect.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe per flagstone? Let me try that. Each flagstone is 75 pounds, so how many flagstones can one truck carry? That would be the truck capacity divided by the weight per flagstone.

Number of flagstones per truck = Truck capacity ÷ Weight per flagstone
Number of flagstones per truck = 2000 ÷ 75

Calculating that, 2000 divided by 75. Hmm, 75 goes into 2000 how many times? Let me see: 75 × 26 is 1950, because 75 × 20 is 1500, and 75 × 6 is 450, so 1500 + 450 is 1950. Subtract that from 2000, and we get 50. So, 26 flagstones would be 1950 pounds, and then 50 pounds remaining. Since we can't have a fraction of a flagstone, we have to consider that 26 flagstones would require a full truck, but the remaining 50 pounds would need another truck. But wait, that's per truck, right?

Wait, no, maybe I confused it. Let me clarify: if each truck can carry 2000 pounds, and each flagstone is 75 pounds, then the number of flagstones per truck is 2000 ÷ 75, which is approximately 26.666... So, about 26 flagstones per truck with some leftover capacity.

But since we can't have a fraction of a flagstone, each truck can carry 26 full flagstones, which would be 26 × 75 = 1950 pounds, leaving 50 pounds of capacity unused. So, for 80 flagstones, how many trucks would we need?

If each truck can carry 26 flagstones, then 80 ÷ 26 is approximately 3.076... So, approximately 3.076 trucks. But since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we'd need to round up to 4 trucks. Wait, hold on, that's conflicting with my previous conclusion. Hmm, so now I'm confused. Which one is correct?

Wait, let me re-examine this. So, earlier, I calculated the total weight as 6000 pounds, which requires 3 trucks. But when I calculated how many flagstones per truck, I got about 26.666 flagstones per truck, which would require 4 trucks for 80 flagstones. So, now I have a conflict in my results.

This must mean I made a mistake in one of the calculations. Let me see.

First, total weight: 80 × 75 = 6000. That's correct.

Number of flagstones per truck: 2000 ÷ 75 = 26.666... So, 26 full flagstones per truck with some extra space. So, 26 flagstones per truck.

Therefore, 80 ÷ 26 = 3.076, which would be 4 trucks when rounded up. But wait, that contradicts the total weight calculation.

So, which is correct? Hmm.

Wait, maybe the confusion is because the extra capacity per truck isn't being considered when calculating the number of flagstones. So, if one truck can carry 26 flagstones, that's 1950 pounds, but if we do 3 trucks, that would be 3 × 1950 = 5850 pounds. But 5850 is less than 6000. Therefore, we still need more.

Wait, so 3 trucks can carry 5850 pounds, but we need 6000. So, 6000 - 5850 = 150 pounds. So, 150 pounds is still left. So, a fourth truck is needed to carry the remaining 150 pounds. Therefore, 4 trucks are needed.

But earlier, I thought 3 trucks would be enough because 3 × 2000 = 6000, which is exactly the total weight. So, why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, because when we calculate the number of flagstones per truck, we have to consider whether each truck can be loaded to its full capacity. If we don't use the extra capacity on each truck, we might need more trucks. But if we use the extra capacity, maybe we can fit all in 3 trucks.

Wait, so if we think in terms of weight, 3 trucks can carry 6000 pounds, which is exactly what we have. So, if the flagstones can be distributed among the trucks in such a way that each truck is loaded to its full capacity, then 3 trucks would suffice.

But if we go by the number of flagstones per truck, which is 26.666, we can't have a fraction of a flagstone, so each truck can only carry 26 full flagstones, and we have leftover space. Therefore, 26 flagstones per truck times 3 trucks is 78 flagstones, which is less than 80. So, we need a fourth truck for the remaining 2 flagstones.

Hence, depending on how we approach it, we get different numbers. But the key is whether the flagstones can be distributed in such a way that each truck is loaded to its full capacity, or if we have to stick strictly to the number of flagstones per truck.

But in reality, you can distribute the weight across the trucks in a way that each truck is loaded to its full capacity, as long as the total weight doesn't exceed 2000 pounds per truck.

So, let's see: if we have 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, totaling 6000 pounds, and each truck can carry 2000 pounds, how many trucks do we need?

Total weight ÷ truck capacity = 6000 ÷ 2000 = 3. So, 3 trucks.

But wait, if we try to load each truck to 2000 pounds, that would mean each truck carries approximately 26.666 flagstones, which isn't possible because you can't have a fraction of a flagstone. But you can split the flagstones across multiple trucks, so that each truck is loaded to 2000 pounds.

Wait, for example, maybe one truck carries 26 flagstones (1950 pounds), another carries 27 flagstones (1975 pounds), and the third carries 27 flagstones (1975 pounds). Wait, but 26 + 27 + 27 = 80. Let me check:

26 + 27 + 27 = 80? 26 + 27 is 53, plus another 27 is 80. Yes, that adds up. So, the first truck carries 26 flagstones, the second and third carry 27 each.

Let me calculate the total weight:

26 × 75 = 1950
27 × 75 = 2025
27 × 75 = 2025

Wait, adding them up: 1950 + 2025 + 2025 = 6000. Perfect, that's exactly the total weight.

So, in this distribution, each truck isn't necessarily loaded with the same number of flagstones, but each truck is loaded to its capacity as much as possible. The first truck is at 1950 pounds, which is 50 pounds less than capacity, but that's okay because we can't have a fraction of a flagstone. The other two trucks are each at 2025 pounds, which is over the capacity. Wait, hold on, that's a problem.

Wait, each truck can only carry up to 2000 pounds. So, 27 flagstones would be 27 × 75 = 2025 pounds, which is over the capacity. So, that's not allowed.

Therefore, that distribution isn't possible because the second and third trucks would exceed the weight limit. So, each truck can't carry more than 2000 pounds. Therefore, in that case, each truck can carry a maximum of 26 flagstones (1950 pounds). So, 26 × 3 = 78 flagstones, which is still two short of 80. Therefore, we need a fourth truck for the remaining two flagstones.

But wait, that's conflicting with the total weight calculation. If each truck can carry 2000 pounds, then three trucks can carry 6000 pounds, which is exactly the total weight. So, why is this discrepancy happening?

Because when we try to distribute the flagstones in a way that each truck is loaded to its maximum capacity, we end up needing more flagstones than we have. Hmm, that seems confusing.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the total weight is exactly divisible by the truck capacity, so in theory, we can distribute the weight in such a way that each truck is at full capacity, but in reality, since we can't split flagstones, it's not possible.

Therefore, in reality, since 80 flagstones can't be perfectly divided into groups that each add up to exactly 2000 pounds, we might have to use more trucks. So, in this case, 3 trucks would carry 78 flagstones (26 each), totaling 1950 pounds each, which is 3 × 1950 = 5850 pounds. But we have 6000 pounds, so we need two more trucks for the remaining 150 pounds? Wait, no, two more flagstones.

Wait, hold on, 80 flagstones minus 78 is 2 flagstones. So, two more flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, so 150 pounds. So, that would require a fourth truck.

But in that case, the fourth truck is only carrying 150 pounds, which is way under its capacity. So, in that case, we have three trucks carrying 26 flagstones each (1950 pounds total each), and one truck carrying 2 flagstones (150 pounds). So, total of four trucks.

But wait, that can't be, because 3 × 26 = 78, plus 2 is 80. So, four trucks are needed. But that contradicts the total weight division.

Wait, hold on, maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me recast it.

Total weight: 80 × 75 = 6000 pounds.

Each truck can carry 2000 pounds.

6000 ÷ 2000 = 3. So, 3 trucks.

But when we try to distribute 80 flagstones into 3 trucks, each truck can carry up to 2000 pounds.

But 80 ÷ 3 is approximately 26.666 flagstones per truck. So, we can't have a fraction, so we have to round up, which would require 27 flagstones per truck, but 27 × 75 = 2025, which exceeds the truck capacity.

So, that's not possible. Therefore, we can only have 26 flagstones per truck, which is 1950 pounds. So, 3 trucks can carry 3 × 1950 = 5850 pounds. But we have 6000 pounds, so the remaining 150 pounds would need a fourth truck.

But wait, 150 pounds is not a full flagstone, so do we need another truck? Or can we just split the flagstones? But the problem is about transporting 80 flagstones. So, you can't split the flagstones; they have to be whole.

Therefore, 3 trucks can carry 78 flagstones, totaling 5850 pounds. The remaining 2 flagstones (150 pounds) need a fourth truck. So, in that case, four trucks are needed.

But hold on, that contradicts the initial thought where the total weight is exactly 3 times the truck capacity. So, which is correct?

I think the confusion is arising because when we have a total weight that's a multiple of the truck capacity, but the number of items (flagstones) isn't a multiple that allows for even distribution.

So, in this case, 80 flagstones at 75 pounds each is exactly 6000 pounds, which is 3 times 2000. So, in an ideal scenario, without any constraints on the number of flagstones per truck, 3 trucks would suffice.

However, because each flagstone is indivisible and each truck can only carry a whole number of flagstones, we might not be able to perfectly distribute them to use all three trucks to their full capacity. So, in reality, we might need an extra truck because we can't split the flagstones.

Therefore, to avoid overloading any truck and ensure all flagstones are transported, even if it means not fully utilizing a truck, we need to use four trucks.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there's a smarter way to distribute the flagstones so that we don't need a fourth truck. Let me try different groupings.

Suppose we have three trucks. Each truck can carry up to 2000 pounds. So, we need to distribute 80 flagstones across three trucks without exceeding 2000 pounds per truck.

Let me see if it's possible to have two trucks carry 27 flagstones each and one truck carry 26 flagstones.

Calculating the total:

27 × 75 = 2025 (over capacity)
27 × 75 = 2025 (over capacity)
26 × 75 = 1950

But 2025 + 2025 + 1950 = 6000, which is correct. But the first two trucks would be over capacity, which isn't allowed. So, that's no good.

Alternatively, maybe one truck carries 28 flagstones, which is 28 × 75 = 2100 pounds, which is way over. Not allowed.

Alternatively, maybe distribute differently: 25, 25, 30.

25 × 75 = 1875
25 × 75 = 1875
30 × 75 = 2250

Again, the last truck is over capacity.

Alternatively, 24, 28, 28.

24 × 75 = 1800
28 × 75 = 2100 (over)
28 × 75 = 2100 (over)

Nope, same problem.

Alternatively, 20, 30, 30.

20 × 75 = 1500
30 × 75 = 2250 (over)
30 × 75 = 2250 (over)

Still over.

Alternatively, 15, 35, 30.

15 × 75 = 1125
35 × 75 = 2625 (way over)
30 × 75 = 2250 (over)

Nope.

Wait, maybe it's impossible to distribute 80 flagstones into three trucks without exceeding the weight limit on at least one truck. Because 26 flagstones is 1950, which is under 2000, but 27 is over.

So, if we use 26 flagstones in each truck, that's 78 flagstones, leaving 2, which would need a fourth truck.

Alternatively, maybe use 26, 26, 28. But 28 is over.

Wait, perhaps 26, 27, 27? But as before, two of them are over.

Wait, but maybe if we have 26, 27, 27, but the two 27s are over, which isn't allowed.

So, it seems that we can't distribute the 80 flagstones into three trucks without exceeding the weight limit on at least one truck. Therefore, we need a fourth truck.

But hold on, maybe we can have one truck with 26 flagstones (1950), another with 26 flagstones (1950), and the third with 28 flagstones (2100), but the third is over. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe one truck with 26, another with 26, and the third with 28, but the third is over. So, not allowed.

Alternatively, 26, 26, 28. Again, over.

Wait, maybe 26, 27, 27, but same issue.

Alternatively, 25, 25, 30. But 30 is over.

Wait, maybe I need to think of another way.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the total weight.

Total weight is 6000, each truck can carry 2000. So, 6000 ÷ 2000 = 3. So, 3 trucks. So, why does the flagstone count complicate things?

Because each flagstone is 75 pounds, which is a multiple of 25. So, 75 × 80 = 6000.

But 2000 is also a multiple of 25. 2000 ÷ 25 = 80. So, 2000 is 25 × 80.

Wait, so 6000 is 25 × 240, right? 25 × 240 = 6000.

So, if each truck can carry 25 × 80 = 2000, then each truck can carry 80 units of 25 pounds. But each flagstone is 75 pounds, which is 3 units of 25 pounds.

Therefore, each truck can carry 80 ÷ 3 ≈ 26.666 flagstones. So, approximately 26 or 27 flagstones.

But as we saw earlier, 26 flagstones per truck is 1950 pounds, which is 50 pounds short of capacity, and 27 flagstones is 2025, which is over.

So, perhaps, if we can split flagstones into parts, but the problem says flagstones, so they have to be whole. So, we can't split them.

So, in that case, each truck can carry either 26 or 27 flagstones, but 27 is over the limit.

Therefore, each truck must carry 26 flagstones at most.

So, 26 × 3 = 78 flagstones, leaving 2 flagstones. 2 flagstones weigh 150 pounds, so we need a fourth truck for them.

Therefore, the conclusion is that 4 trucks are needed.

But wait, the total weight is 6000 pounds, which is exactly 3 times 2000. So, why can't we distribute the flagstones in such a way that each truck is loaded to capacity? Because the number of flagstones doesn't divide evenly into groups that sum up to the truck capacity.

So, even though the total weight is a multiple of the truck capacity, the indivisibility of the items makes it so that we can't perfectly distribute them without exceeding the number of trucks or the weight limit.

Therefore, in this case, 3 trucks can't carry all 80 flagstones without some trucks being overloaded or without having leftover flagstones that need a fourth truck.

Thus, the answer must be 4 trucks.

But wait, now I'm confused because earlier, I thought 3 trucks would be enough because the total weight adds up, but upon considering the indivisibility of flagstones, 4 trucks are needed.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, let me think about it differently. If the problem was about transporting 6000 pounds, regardless of how many flagstones, then 3 trucks would suffice. But since it's about transporting 80 flagstones, each weighing 75, then you have to consider that you can't split them.

Therefore, even though the total weight is 6000, which is 3 times 2000, the actual number of flagstones is 80, which when divided into 3 groups, can't all fit into 2000-pound trucks without some trucks carrying more flagstones than others, but you can't carry more than 2000.

Therefore, in reality, you need 4 trucks because you can't have partial flagstones or trucks. So, 4 is the correct number.

But wait, earlier, when I calculated 80 ÷ 3, that was approximately 26.666 flagstones per truck. So, each truck needs to carry approximately 26.666 flagstones, but since you can't have a fraction, you have to round up, which would require 27 flagstones per truck, but 27 × 3 = 81, which is more than 80. So, 27 per truck would require 3 trucks, but that's 81 flagstones, which is one more than needed, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, if each truck carries 26 flagstones, that's 78, leaving 2 flagstones, which is 150 pounds. So, that's 4 trucks.

Therefore, the minimal number of trucks needed is 4.

But wait, let me check online if there's a formula or something for this kind of problem. Hmm, it's like a bin packing problem, where you have bins of capacity 2000, and items of size 75, and you have 80 items. What's the minimal number of bins needed?

Yes, bin packing problem. In bin packing, the minimal number of bins needed can be calculated by the ceiling of total size divided by bin capacity, which in this case is 6000 ÷ 2000 = 3, so 3 bins. However, in reality, due to the indivisibility of items, sometimes you need more bins.

But in our case, even though the total size fits into 3 bins, because of the item sizes, it's actually impossible to pack 80 items (each 75) into 3 bins (each 2000). Because, as I saw earlier, the maximum number of items per bin is 26, since 27 items would exceed the bin capacity.

So, 26 items per bin × 3 bins = 78 items. So, 2 items left, which would require a fourth bin.

Hence, the minimal number of trucks needed is 4.

But wait, let me confirm this with another approach.

If we try to calculate how many flagstones can fit into 3 trucks without exceeding 2000 pounds each, the maximum number per truck is 26, as 26 × 75 = 1950.

So, 26 flagstones per truck × 3 trucks = 78 flagstones.

Total flagstones transported: 78.

Total flagstones remaining: 80 - 78 = 2.

Therefore, we need a fourth truck for the remaining 2 flagstones.

Hence, 4 trucks are needed.

Alternatively, can we find a way to distribute the flagstones so that 3 trucks are enough?

Suppose, instead of 26, 26, 28, which is over, but maybe 25, 25, 30, which is over, or 24, 28, 30, which is over.

Wait, no, it's not possible. Any distribution where one truck carries more than 26 will exceed 2000 pounds.

Therefore, the only way is to have each truck carry 26 flagstones, which is 1950 pounds, and then have the remaining 2 flagstones go into a fourth truck.

Therefore, 4 trucks are needed.

But wait, I have conflicting conclusions here. On one hand, the total weight is 6000, which is 3 times 2000, suggesting 3 trucks. On the other hand, the number of flagstones requires 4 trucks due to indivisibility.

So, which is it? Hmm.

I think the key is that the problem is about transporting 80 flagstones, each 75 pounds. So, the question is, how many trucks do you need to transport all 80 flagstones in one trip, with each truck not exceeding 2000 pounds.

So, in this context, the fact that the total weight is 6000 is just a coincidence? Or is it?

Wait, 80 flagstones ×75 = 6000, and 6000 ÷ 2000 = 3. So, in that case, 3 trucks can carry all 80 flagstones in one trip, because the total weight is exactly 3 times the truck capacity.

But wait, how can 3 trucks carry 80 flagstones if each truck can only carry 2000 pounds, and each flagstone is 75. So, maybe the issue is not about the number of flagstones per truck, but about the total weight.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from interpreting the problem as either:

1. Total weight of all flagstones is 6000, which requires 3 trucks.

OR

2. Trying to fit all 80 flagstones into 3 trucks, each with a maximum of 2000 pounds. But because each flagstone is 75, you can't fit all 80 into 3 trucks because each truck can only carry up to 26 flagstones (1950 pounds), so you need 4 trucks.

Therefore, the answer could be either 3 or 4, depending on the interpretation.

But in reality, the problem is asking to transport 80 flagstones in one trip. So, if all 80 flagstones are on the same trip, then you have to consider how many trucks you need for all 80 at once, not just the total weight.

Therefore, in that case, each truck can only carry a certain number of flagstones without exceeding 2000 pounds.

So, if each truck can't carry more than 26 flagstones (1950 pounds), then with 3 trucks, you can carry 78 flagstones, and you need a fourth truck for the remaining 2.

Therefore, the answer should be 4 trucks.

But wait, if the problem was just about the total weight, regardless of the number of flagstones, then 3 trucks would be enough, but since it's about transporting 80 flagstones, each 75 pounds, in one trip, you have to consider the number of flagstones each truck can carry.

Therefore, the correct answer is 4 trucks.

But now, I'm really confused because I'm oscillating between 3 and 4.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again:

"A landscaping company is delivering flagstones to a customer’s yard. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip?"

So, it's about transporting 80 flagstones in one trip, with each truck able to carry up to 2000 pounds.

So, in that case, each truck can carry up to 2000 pounds, but since each flagstone is 75 pounds, we have to figure out the number of flagstones per truck, considering they must be whole.

So, since each truck can carry up to 2000 pounds, the maximum number of flagstones per truck is floor(2000 ÷ 75) = floor(26.666) = 26 flagstones.

Therefore, each truck can carry 26 flagstones at most.

Therefore, 80 flagstones divided by 26 per truck is approximately 3.076 trucks, which rounds up to 4 trucks.

Therefore, 4 trucks are needed.

So, I think the correct answer is 4 trucks.

Wait, but the total weight is 6000, which is exactly 3 times 2000, so why is it 4?

Because the number of flagstones is such that you can't split them, so even though the total weight is enough for 3 trucks, you can't fit all the flagstones into 3 trucks without overloading some of them, which isn't allowed. So, you have to use a fourth truck.

Therefore, 4 trucks are needed.

Hence, the answer is 4.

But wait, let me check once more.

Let me calculate how many flagstones 3 trucks can carry.

Each truck can carry up to 26 flagstones (1950 pounds).

So, 3 trucks × 26 flagstones = 78 flagstones.

Total flagstones needed: 80.

So, 80 - 78 = 2 flagstones remaining.

Each flagstone is 75 pounds, so 2 flagstones are 150 pounds.

So, 150 pounds is less than 2000, so it can fit into a fourth truck.

Therefore, 4 trucks are needed.

So, the conclusion is 4 trucks.

Wait, but another way: If the total weight is 6000, which is 3 × 2000, so 3 trucks can carry 6000 pounds. So, in terms of weight, 3 is enough, but in terms of the number of flagstones, 3 trucks can only carry 78, leaving 2.

Therefore, you need 4 trucks.

So, is the problem asking about weight or about the number of flagstones?

Wait, the problem says: "how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip?"

So, it's about transporting 80 flagstones, not about transporting 6000 pounds. So, it's about the number of flagstones, which can't be split, so the number of trucks required is based on the number of flagstones, not just the total weight.

Therefore, in that case, 4 trucks are needed.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is 4.

But now, to make sure, let me think of another similar problem.

Suppose, I have 100 items, each weighing 100 pounds, and trucks can carry up to 3000 pounds. So, total weight is 10,000 pounds, which is 10,000 ÷ 3000 ≈ 3.333 trucks. So, 4 trucks.

Alternatively, if each truck can carry up to 2000 pounds, and I have 80 items, each 75 pounds, total weight 6000, which is 3 × 2000, so 3 trucks. But since 80 items can't be split, each truck can carry 26 items, which is 1950 pounds, so 3 trucks can carry 78 items, leaving 2, so 4 trucks.

Therefore, the answer is 4.

So, yeah, I think that's the way to go.

**Final Answer**
The landscaping company will need \boxed{4} trucks to transport all 80 flagstones in one trip.

First, we need to calculate the total weight of all 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so we multiply the number of flagstones by the weight per flagstone:

\[
80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we determine how many trucks are needed to transport this total weight. Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the truck capacity:

\[
\frac{6000}{2000} = 3
\]

However, since each flagstone is indivisible, we need to check if we can distribute the flagstones evenly among the trucks without exceeding the weight limit. Each truck can carry a maximum of:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{2000}{75} \right\rfloor = 26 \text{ flagstones}
\]

Multiplying the number of flagstones per truck by the number of trucks gives:

\[
26 \times 3 = 78 \text{ flagstones}
\]

Since we need to transport 80 flagstones, we have 2 flagstones remaining after using 3 trucks. These remaining 2 flagstones will need an additional truck. Therefore, the total number of trucks required is:

\[
3 + 1 = 4
\]

Thus, the landscaping company will need \boxed{4} trucks to transport all 80 flagstones in one trip.
