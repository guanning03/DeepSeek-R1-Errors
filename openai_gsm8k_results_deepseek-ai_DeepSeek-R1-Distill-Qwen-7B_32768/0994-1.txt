Question:
Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time?

Correct Answer:
Bill saw the Comet for the second time when he was 30 years * 3= <<30*3=90>>90 years old.
Comet Halley can be seen every 75 years, so Bill saw the comet for the first time when he was 90 years - 75 years = <<90-75=15>>15 years old.
#### 15

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how old Bill was when he saw Comet Halley for the first time. Let me break down the problem step by step. 

First, the problem says that Comet Halley orbits the Sun every 75 years. That means if someone sees the Comet one time, they can expect to see it again 75 years later. 

Bill's dad saw the Comet when Bill was 30 years old. So, at that time, Bill was 30. Now, the problem mentions that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. Hmm, okay, let's try to parse that.

Let me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let me denote:

- Let \( B_1 \) be Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time.
- Let \( D_1 \) be his dad's age when the dad saw the Comet.
- Let \( B_2 \) be Bill's age when he saw the Comet the second time.
- Let \( D_2 \) be his dad's age when the dad saw the Comet the second time.

From the problem, we know that Bill was 30 when his dad saw the Comet. So, \( B_1 = 30 \). Wait, is that correct? Hmm, hold on.

Wait, actually, the problem says, "Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old." So, that would mean that when his dad saw the Comet, Bill was 30. So, actually, \( B_1 = 30 \). So, when the dad saw the Comet, Bill was 30. So, that means \( B_1 = 30 \). Hmm, okay, that makes sense.

But wait, let me reread that part: "Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old." So, when the dad saw the Comet, Bill was 30. So, the dad's age at that time was... well, we don't know his exact age, but we know that 75 years later, the Comet will return, so if the dad saw the Comet at some age, he will see it again 75 years later.

But how does that relate to Bill seeing the Comet a second time? The problem says: "Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet." So, when Bill saw the Comet the second time, his age was three times his father's age when the father saw the Comet.

So, in equation form, that would be \( B_2 = 3 \times D_1 \). 

But we know that \( D_1 \) is the father's age when the father saw the Comet. But the father saw the Comet when Bill was 30, so that moment was 75 years before the time when Bill saw it the second time. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, hold on. Let me think. If the Comet comes every 75 years, then the time between the first appearance and the second appearance is 75 years. So, if the father saw the Comet when Bill was 30, then 75 years later, the Comet would return, and Bill would be 30 + 75 = 105. So, if the problem says that Bill saw the Comet again when he was three times his father's age when he first saw it, that would mean that the second time was 75 years after the first time.

But wait, is that necessarily the case? Or could it be that the Comet was seen at the same time again? Hmm, but Comets don't orbit the Sun in such a short time, so they don't return every year. So, they do return every 75 years, so the time between sightings is 75 years.

So, if the father saw the Comet when Bill was 30, then 75 years later, the Comet comes back, and Bill would be 30 + 75 = 105. So, at that time, the father would be his age at that first sighting plus 75 years. 

But let me get back to the problem. It says, "Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet." So, \( B_2 = 3 \times D_1 \). 

We know that \( D_1 \) is the father's age when he saw the Comet, which was when Bill was 30. So, if I denote \( D_1 \) as the father's age at that time, then \( B_2 = 3 \times D_1 \). 

But how much older is the father than Bill at the time of their first sighting? Let's denote the age difference between the father and Bill as \( A \). So, \( A = D_1 - 30 \). Because at the time the father saw the Comet, Bill was 30, so the father is \( A \) years older than Bill.

Therefore, \( D_1 = 30 + A \). Then, \( B_2 = 3 \times D_1 = 3 \times (30 + A) = 90 + 3A \).

But we also know that the time between the two sightings is 75 years. So, when the Comet comes back, Bill will be 75 years older than he was the first time. So, \( B_2 = B_1 + 75 \). But \( B_1 \) is 30, so \( B_2 = 30 + 75 = 105 \).

Wait, hold on. So, from the first sighting, 75 years pass, and the Comet comes back, and Bill is 105. But the problem also says that \( B_2 = 3 \times D_1 \).

So, putting it all together:

\( B_2 = 3 \times D_1 \)
But \( B_2 = 105 \) as well.

So, substituting:

\( 105 = 3 \times D_1 \)
Therefore, \( D_1 = 105 / 3 = 35 \).

So, the father was 35 years old when he saw the Comet.

But we also know that the father was 35 when he saw the Comet, and at that time, Bill was 30. So, the age difference \( A = D_1 - B_1 = 35 - 30 = 5 \) years. So, the father is 5 years older than Bill.

Therefore, the father is 5 years older than Bill. So, when Bill was 30, his father was 35, and 75 years later, when Bill is 105, his father is 35 + 75 = 110.

But the problem states that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the father's age when he first saw the Comet. So, three times 35 is 105, which is Bill's age when he saw it the second time, which matches with 30 + 75.

So, all the numbers check out.

But wait, the question is: How old was Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time? Well, that was 30, right? Because the problem says, "Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old," implying that Bill was 30 when his dad saw it.

Wait, hold on, is that necessarily the case? Let me re-examine the wording.

The problem says: "Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old." So, when the dad saw the Comet, Bill was 30. So, the dad's age at that time is not given, but we can work with the information given.

However, the key is that the second sighting is 75 years after the first, so Bill would be 30 + 75 = 105 when he saw it the second time.

And the problem says that second time, Bill was three times as old as his father was when he (the father) saw the Comet. So, if in the first time, the father was some age, let's call it F, then in the second time, Bill is 3F.

But we also know that 75 years have passed, so the father's age at the second sighting would be F + 75.

But here's the thing: when Bill saw the Comet the second time, he was 3F, and the father was F + 75. However, if the father was F when Bill was 30, then the father is 30 + (F - 30) = F. Wait, no, that's circular.

Wait, maybe another approach.

Let me denote:

- Let’s say the first time, when the dad saw the Comet, Bill was 30. So, at that moment, the dad's age is D.

- Then, 75 years later, the Comet comes back, so the dad will be D + 75, and Bill will be 30 + 75 = 105.

But the problem says that at the second time, Bill was three times as old as his father was at the first time. So, 105 = 3 * D.

Therefore, D = 105 / 3 = 35.

So, the father was 35 when he saw the Comet.

Therefore, when Bill was 30, his dad was 35, so Bill is 5 years younger than his dad.

Therefore, when Bill saw the Comet the first time, he was 30.

Wait, so the question is: How old was Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time? So, is it 30? But let me make sure.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a leap there. Let me try again.

We know that when the father saw the Comet, Bill was 30. So, at that time, the father's age is F, and Bill's age is 30. Therefore, the age difference between the father and Bill is F - 30.

Then, 75 years later, the Comet comes back, so the father is F + 75, and Bill is 30 + 75 = 105.

But the problem says that when Bill saw the Comet the second time, he was three times the age his father was when he (the father) saw the Comet. So, Bill's age the second time is 105, and that's equal to three times the father's age the first time. So:

105 = 3 * F

Therefore, F = 35.

Therefore, the father was 35 when he saw the Comet, so Bill was 30. So, yes, Bill was 30 when he saw the Comet for the first time.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the answer is 30. That seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Alternative approach: Maybe the "a second time" refers to the same Comet appearing again, so the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years. So, if Bill was 30 when his dad saw it, then 75 years later, the Comet comes back, and Bill is 105. The problem says that at that second sighting, Bill was three times as old as his father was when he (the father) saw it the first time. So, 105 = 3 * F, so F = 35. Therefore, the father was 35 when he saw it, so when Bill was 30, his father was 35. Therefore, the age difference is 5 years. So, when Bill was 30, his father was 35. Therefore, Bill was 30 when he saw the Comet for the first time.

Wait, so that is consistent.

Alternatively, is there a scenario where the Comet was seen again before the first time? But Comets don't come back that often, so it's more likely that it's the first and second sightings, 75 years apart.

Therefore, I think the answer is 30.

Wait, but let me check again.

Let me assign variables differently.

Let’s denote:

- Let’s say when the father saw the Comet, Bill was 30. So, at that time, let’s say the father was F years old, so F = ?

- Then, 75 years later, the Comet comes back, so the father is F + 75, and Bill is 30 + 75 = 105.

- The problem states that at that second time, when Bill was 105, he was three times as old as his father was when he (the father) saw the Comet. So, 105 = 3 * F.

- Therefore, F = 35.

- So, the father was 35 when he saw the Comet, which was when Bill was 30.

Therefore, the first time Bill saw the Comet, he was 30.

So, yeah, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 30.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem.

Another way: Maybe "a second time" refers to seeing the Comet again, not necessarily 75 years later. But that would complicate things because the Comet's period is 75 years, so unless the Comet's period is different, which it isn't, the second time would have to be 75 years later.

Therefore, 75 years after the first sighting, the Comet comes back, so Bill would be 30 + 75 = 105. The problem says that at that second time, Bill was three times as old as his father was when he first saw the Comet, so 105 = 3 * F, so F = 35.

Therefore, the father was 35 when he saw the Comet, which was when Bill was 30. Therefore, Bill was 30 when he saw the Comet for the first time.

So, that seems to check out.

Therefore, I think the answer is 30.

**Final Answer**
Bill was \boxed{30} years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.
</think>

Let \( B_1 \) be Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, and let \( D_1 \) be his dad's age when he saw the Comet. 

1. The problem states that Bill's dad saw the Comet when Bill was 30 years old. Therefore, \( B_1 = 30 \).
2. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. Therefore, \( B_2 = 3 \times D_1 \).
3. Since the Comet orbits the Sun every 75 years, 75 years pass between the first and second sightings. Thus, \( B_2 = B_1 + 75 \).
4. Substituting \( B_1 = 30 \) into the equation, we get \( B_2 = 30 + 75 = 105 \).
5. We know that \( B_2 = 3 \times D_1 \). Substituting \( B_2 = 105 \) into this equation, we get \( 105 = 3 \times D_1 \).
6. Solving for \( D_1 \), we find \( D_1 = \frac{105}{3} = 35 \).

Therefore, when Bill's dad saw the Comet, he was 35 years old, which means Bill was 30 years old at that time. 

Thus, Bill was \boxed{30} years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.
