Question:
If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, how many hours will it take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do so?

Correct Answer:
If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, one kangaroo takes 18/3= <<18/3=6>>6 hours to cross the highway.
A turtle traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo will take 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 hours to cross the highway.
Four turtles will take a total of 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 hours to travel across the highway.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this problem here: If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, how many hours will it take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do so? Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's try to understand what the problem is asking. It's about comparing the time it takes for different animals to travel the same distance. Kangaroos and turtles have different speeds, and we need to find the time taken by the turtles. 

So, we're given that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours. I think the key here is to figure out the speed of the kangaroos and then relate that to the turtles. But wait, the question is about the time taken, so maybe we can figure out the distance first?

Let me recall the basic formula: speed = distance divided by time, or \( v = \frac{d}{t} \). Maybe I can use that. If I can find the distance, then knowing the speed of the turtles, I can find the time they take.

But wait, we don't have the actual distance. Hmm, but maybe it doesn't matter because the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. Let me think.

If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, then the total work done is 3 kangaroos multiplied by 18 hours, which gives the total "kangaroo-hours" or something like that. But that might not be directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe it's about speed.

Wait, let me see... If all 3 kangaroos are moving at the same speed, then the combined speed is 3 times the speed of one kangaroo. So, if I let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \), then the combined speed is \( 3v \).

The time taken to cross the highway is 18 hours. So, using the formula \( d = v \times t \), the distance \( d \) would be \( 3v \times 18 \) hours. So, \( d = 54v \).

Wait, hold on, that might not be right. Because if each kangaroo is moving at speed \( v \), then together, their combined speed is \( 3v \). So, the distance would be \( 3v \times 18 \) hours, which is \( 54v \). Hmm, but actually, if you're talking about one kangaroo traveling, then its speed is \( v \), so distance is \( v \times 18 \), but since there are 3 kangaroos, does that affect the distance?

Wait a second, maybe not. Because if all 3 kangaroos are traveling across the same highway, then the distance each one travels is the same. So, maybe it's just one kangaroo taking 18 hours, and the fact that there are 3 kangaroos is irrelevant? Hmm, that seems confusing.

Wait, no. If all 3 kangaroos are moving at the same speed, then their combined speed would be 3v. So, the time taken to cover the distance \( d \) is 18 hours. So, \( d = (3v) \times 18 \). Thus, \( d = 54v \).

But if we were to have one kangaroo traveling alone, its speed is \( v \), so the time it would take to cover the same distance \( d = 54v \) would be \( t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{54v}{v} = 54 \) hours. Hmm, so 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, so one kangaroo would take 54 hours? That seems logical because 3 kangaroos would cover the distance three times as fast, so the time is divided by 3.

Wait, yes, exactly. So, if 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, one kangaroo would take 3 times longer, which is 54 hours.

So, that means the speed of one kangaroo is \( \frac{d}{54} \) per hour, right? Because distance divided by time is speed.

But actually, no, the speed should be \( \frac{d}{18} \) if we consider that 3 kangaroos together take 18 hours. Wait, maybe I'm confusing something here.

Let me think again.

If 3 kangaroos together take 18 hours, their combined speed is \( v_{combined} = 3v \). So, \( d = v_{combined} \times t = 3v \times 18 \). So, \( d = 54v \).

If we have one kangaroo, its speed is \( v \), so time taken would be \( t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{54v}{v} = 54 \) hours. So, that makes sense. So, 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, 1 kangaroo takes 54 hours.

So, now, moving on to the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, speed of a turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

We have four turtles, each moving at \( \frac{v}{2} \). So, their combined speed is \( 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \).

So, the combined speed of the four turtles is \( 2v \).

We need to find the time taken for them to cross the same distance \( d = 54v \).

So, using the formula \( d = speed \times time \), the time \( t \) is \( t = \frac{d}{speed} = \frac{54v}{2v} \).

Wait, the \( v \) cancels out, so \( t = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \) hours.

So, that seems to be the answer. Let me just verify the logic again to make sure.

1. 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, so their combined speed is 3v. Thus, the distance is 54v.

2. 1 kangaroo's speed is v, so the time taken by 1 kangaroo would be 54v / v = 54 hours.

3. So, each turtle's speed is v/2.

4. Four turtles have a combined speed of 4*(v/2) = 2v.

5. So, to cover the same distance of 54v, the time is 54v / 2v = 27 hours.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of work done. The total work is the same for both animals. For the kangaroos, the work is 3 kangaroos * 18 hours = 54 kangaroo-hours. For the turtles, each turtle is half the speed, so each hour a turtle contributes half a "turtle-hour." With four turtles, each hour they contribute 4*(1/2) = 2 "turtle-hours." So, to get 54 hours of work, you need 54 / 2 = 27 hours.

That also gives the same answer, so that's good.

So, either way, whether I think in terms of distance, speed, or work, I get 27 hours as the time required for four turtles, each moving at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway.

I think that makes sense. So, I feel confident that the answer is 27 hours.

**Final Answer**
The time it will take four turtles is \boxed{27} hours.
</think>

First, we determine the distance traveled by the kangaroos. Given that 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to cross the highway, we calculate the combined speed of the kangaroos. Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \). The combined speed of 3 kangaroos is \( 3v \). The distance \( d \) they travel is given by:

\[ d = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we consider the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). With four turtles, their combined speed is:

\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

We need to find the time it takes for these turtles to cover the same distance \( d = 54v \). Using the formula \( d = speed \times time \), we solve for time \( t \):

\[ t = \frac{d}{2v} = \frac{54v}{2v} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Thus, the time it will take four turtles to cross the highway is \(\boxed{27}\) hours.
