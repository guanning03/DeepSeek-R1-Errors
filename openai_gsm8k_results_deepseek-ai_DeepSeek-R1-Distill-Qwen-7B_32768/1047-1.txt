Question:
Jordan wanted to surprise her mom with a homemade birthday cake.  From reading the instructions, she knew it would take 20 minutes to make the cake batter and 30 minutes to bake the cake.  The cake would require 2 hours to cool and an additional 10 minutes to frost the cake.  If she plans to make the cake all on the same day, what is the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm?

Correct Answer:
1 hour is 60 minutes so we know that 2 hours to cool the cake is the same as 2*60 so <<2*60=120>>120 min
It will take Jordan 20 min to make the batter, 30 to bake, 120 to cool and 10 to frost so the cake will take 20 +30 +120 +10 = <<20+30+120+10=180>>180 minutes total
Jordan needs to convert 180 minutes to hours so 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours
If the cake needs to be finished by 5:00 pm and it will take 3 hours total to make then 5-3 = <<5-3=2>>2:00 pm is the latest she can start making the cake

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Jordan wants to surprise her mom with a homemade birthday cake. She knows the different steps involved and their respective times. Let me try to figure out the latest time she can start making the cake so it's ready by 5:00 pm. Hmm, this seems like a timeline problem where I need to subtract the total time required from the desired finish time.

First, let me list down the tasks and their durations:

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes.
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes.
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours.
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes.

Wait, so she needs to do all these steps one after another? Or can she do them concurrently? Hmm, the problem says she plans to make the cake all on the same day, but it's not specified whether she can work on different parts simultaneously. Since it's a single day, I think she might have to do them sequentially, one after another, unless she has multiple ovens or something. But the problem doesn't mention anything about multiple ovens or parallel tasks, so I should assume each task is done one after another.

So, if I add up all these times, that will give me the total time needed to make the cake from start to finish. Then, subtracting that total time from 5:00 pm will give me the latest start time.

Let me calculate the total time first. 

First step: 20 minutes for the batter.

Second step: 30 minutes for baking. So, 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Third step: 2 hours for cooling. Hmm, 2 hours is 120 minutes. So adding that, 50 + 120 = 170 minutes.

Fourth step: 10 minutes for frosting. So, 170 + 10 = 180 minutes total.

Wait, 180 minutes is equal to 3 hours because 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 180 divided by 60 is 3. So, the total time needed is 3 hours.

But hold on, let me confirm that. 20 minutes + 30 minutes is 50, plus 2 hours which is 120, so 50 + 120 is 170, plus 10 is 180. Yes, that's correct. 180 minutes is 3 hours.

So, if the total time needed is 3 hours, and she needs to finish by 5:00 pm, she needs to start 3 hours before 5:00 pm.

What's 5:00 pm minus 3 hours? That would be 2:00 pm. So, 2:00 pm is the latest time she can start making the cake to have it ready by 5:00 pm.

Wait, but let me double-check my math because sometimes with time it's easy to make mistakes.

So, starting at 2:00 pm, making the batter takes 20 minutes, finishing at 2:20 pm.

Then, baking takes 30 minutes, so that would end at 2:50 pm.

Cooling takes 2 hours, so 2:50 pm plus 2 hours is 4:50 pm.

Then, frosting takes 10 minutes, so 4:50 pm plus 10 minutes is 5:00 pm exactly.

Perfect, that adds up. So, starting at 2:00 pm, each task finishes just in time for the next step, and she's done by 5:00 pm.

Is there any possibility that she can start earlier? Hmm, if she started earlier, she would finish earlier, but she wants the latest time to start so that it's ready at 5:00 pm. So, 2:00 pm is the answer.

But another thing to consider: can she start earlier without any issues? Maybe she has enough time, but the question is asking for the latest time she can start to be ready at 5:00 pm, so 2:00 pm is the latest.

Wait, but sometimes, with baking and cooling, you might need to wait for the cake to be ready before frosting it. But in this case, she's doing each step sequentially. So, she can't start frosting before the cake is done cooling, right?

But since the total time from start to finish is exactly 3 hours, and she needs to finish by 5:00 pm, starting at 2:00 pm will make it so that all steps finish by 5:00 pm.

So, I think 2:00 pm is the correct latest start time.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the duration. Let's recount:

- Making batter: 20 minutes.

- Baking: 30 minutes.

- Cooling: 2 hours.

- Frosting: 10 minutes.

20 + 30 is 50 minutes. 2 hours is 120 minutes. 50 + 120 is 170 minutes. 170 + 10 is 180 minutes. 180 minutes is 3 hours. 5:00 pm minus 3 hours is 2:00 pm. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, I think 2:00 pm is the latest time Jordan can start to have the cake ready by 5:00 pm.

**Final Answer**
The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is \boxed{2:00 \text{ PM}}.

Jordan wants to surprise her mom with a homemade birthday cake. The tasks involved and their durations are:

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes.
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes.
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (120 minutes).
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes.

Adding up all these times:

- Making the batter: 20 minutes.
- Baking: 30 minutes.
- Cooling: 120 minutes.
- Frosting: 10 minutes.

Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes, which is 3 hours.

To find the latest start time, we subtract the total time from the desired finish time of 5:00 pm:

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

Thus, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is \boxed{2:00 \text{ PM}}.
