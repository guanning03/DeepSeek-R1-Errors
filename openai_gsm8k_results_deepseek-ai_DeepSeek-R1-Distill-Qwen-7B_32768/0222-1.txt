Question:
Jenna has 4 roommates. Each month the electricity bill is $100. How much will each roommate pay per year for electricity, if they divide the share equally?

Correct Answer:
There are 12 months in a year, so the total electricity for the year will cost 100*12 =$<<100*12=1200>>1200.
Since there are 5 roommates, each roommate will pay 1200/5=$<<1200/5=240>>240 in a year.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out how much each roommate of Jenna will pay per year for electricity. Let me see. The problem says Jenna has 4 roommates, and each month the electricity bill is $100. They want to divide the share equally. Hmm, okay, so first, maybe I should figure out the total bill per year and then divide that by the number of roommates. That makes sense because they're splitting the cost.

Alright, so let's start by calculating the annual cost. If each month the bill is $100, then over 12 months, the total would be 100 multiplied by 12. Let me write that down: 100 * 12. Hmm, 100 times 12 is 1200. So the total electricity bill for the year is $1200. Got that.

Now, since Jenna has 4 roommates, including herself, I think? Wait, the problem says "4 roommates," so does that mean there are 4 people in total sharing the bill? Let me check the question again: "Jenna has 4 roommates. Each month the electricity bill is $100." It doesn't specify if Jenna is included in the 4 roommates or not. Hmm, that's a bit unclear. Wait, but usually, when someone says they have roommates, they mean excluding themselves. So, if Jenna has 4 roommates, that would make the total number of people sharing the bill 5, right? Because it's her 4 roommates plus her.

Wait, hold on, that might complicate things, but maybe I should assume that the 4 roommates are in addition to Jenna. So total people would be 5. Let me think: if it's 5 people, then each person would pay 1200 divided by 5. Alternatively, if the 4 roommates are the only ones sharing the bill, then it's 4 people. Hmm, the wording says "Jenna has 4 roommates," so if she has 4 roommates, that means 4 people in total, not counting herself. So, the bill is split among 4 people.

Wait, but sometimes people include themselves. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me think about it more carefully. The problem says "how much will each roommate pay." It doesn't mention Jenna, so maybe "roommate" refers to her 4 roommates. So perhaps the 4 roommates are the ones splitting the bill. So, if it's 4 roommates, that would be 4 people. So, the total bill is $1200 per year, divided by 4 roommates. That would be 1200 divided by 4, which is 300. So each roommate would pay $300 per year.

But wait, I might have overcomplicated it. Let me read the problem again: "Jenna has 4 roommates. Each month the electricity bill is $100. How much will each roommate pay per year for electricity, if they divide the share equally?" It says "each roommate," so maybe it's just her 4 roommates, not including Jenna. So, 4 people. So, the annual cost is 1200 divided by 4, which is 300. So each roommate pays $300 per year.

But just to be sure, maybe we should consider Jenna as part of the group. So, if there are 4 roommates, and Jenna is also paying, then it's 5 people. Hmm, but the problem specifically says "each roommate," so perhaps it's just the 4 roommates. The way it's phrased: "how much will each roommate pay..." So yes, I think it's 4 roommates. So 4 people.

So 1200 divided by 4 is 300. Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year. Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me just check my math again. 100 per month times 12 is 1200. Divided by 4 is 300. Yes, that seems right.

Alternatively, if we consider that the 4 roommates are including Jenna, then it's 5 people. So we would do 1200 divided by 5, which is 240. But the question says "each roommate," so I think it refers to her 4 roommates, not including herself. So, 4 people.

Wait, but the problem is a bit ambiguous. It says "Jenna has 4 roommates," so in a house, usually, when you say you have roommates, you don't count yourself. So, 4 roommates would be 4 people. So, the total bill is 1200, so 1200 divided by 4 is 300. So, each roommate pays $300 per year.

Alternatively, if the 4 roommates are including Jenna, then it's 5. But I think it's more likely that the 4 roommates are separate from Jenna, because when people say "I have X roommates," they don't include themselves. So, 4 roommates, so 4 people. So, 1200 divided by 4 is 300.

So, I think the answer is $300 per year per roommate.

**Final Answer**
Each roommate will pay \boxed{300} dollars per year for electricity.
</think>

Jenna has 4 roommates, and each month the electricity bill is $100. To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we first calculate the annual cost of the electricity bill:

\[
100 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 12 \, \text{months} = 1200 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

Since the bill is to be divided equally among the 4 roommates, we divide the annual cost by the number of roommates:

\[
1200 \, \text{dollars/year} \div 4 \, \text{roommates} = 300 \, \text{dollars/year per roommate}
\]

Thus, each roommate will pay \boxed{300} dollars per year for electricity.
