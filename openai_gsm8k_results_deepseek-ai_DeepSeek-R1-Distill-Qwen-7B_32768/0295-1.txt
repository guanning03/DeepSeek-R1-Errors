Question:
The light on a lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. How long will it take the light to blink 459 times?

Correct Answer:
The lighthouse blinks 255 / 5 = <<255/5=51>>51 times per minute.
It takes 459 / 51 = <<459/51=9>>9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: The light on a lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. I need to figure out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I think I should find out how many times the light blinks per minute. That makes sense because it's a rate problem. If I can find the rate, then I can use that to find the time for a different number of blinks.

So, the lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate, I can divide the number of blinks by the time. That should give me blinks per minute. Let me write that down:

255 blinks / 5 minutes = ?

Let me calculate that. 255 divided by 5. Hmm, 5 times 50 is 250, so 255 minus 250 is 5. So, 50 with a remainder of 5. That means 50.5 blinks per minute? Wait, or is it 51?

Wait, no, 255 divided by 5 is 51. Because 5 times 51 is 255. Yeah, I must have messed up my earlier calculation. So, 255 divided by 5 is 51. So, the rate is 51 blinks per minute.

Alright, so now that I know it blinks 51 times every minute, I can figure out how long it takes for 459 blinks. To find the time, I can take the total number of blinks and divide by the rate.

So, time = total blinks / rate.

That would be 459 blinks divided by 51 blinks per minute. Let me compute that.

Hmm, 51 times 9 is 459, right? Let me check: 50 times 9 is 450, and 1 times 9 is 9, so 450 + 9 is 459. So, 51 times 9 is 459. Therefore, 459 divided by 51 is 9. So, the time should be 9 minutes.

Wait a second, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 51 blinks per minute times 9 minutes is 459. Yep, that adds up. So, that seems correct.

But just to be thorough, let me go back step by step. So, 255 blinks in 5 minutes, so dividing both by 5 gives 51 blinks per minute. Then, to find how many minutes for 459 blinks, divide 459 by 51, which is 9. That all lines up.

Alternatively, I could set up a proportion to solve this. Let me try that method to confirm.

If 255 blinks correspond to 5 minutes, then 459 blinks correspond to x minutes. So, the proportion would be:

255 / 5 = 459 / x

Cross-multiplying gives 255x = 5 * 459.

Calculating 5 * 459: 5 times 400 is 2000, 5 times 59 is 295, so 2000 + 295 is 2295. So, 255x = 2295.

Now, solving for x, we divide both sides by 255.

x = 2295 / 255.

Let me compute that. 255 goes into 2295 how many times?

255 times 9 is 2295 because 255*10 is 2550, which is too much, so subtract 255 to get 2295. Therefore, x is 9. So, that confirms it as well. So, 9 minutes.

Another way to think about it is unit rates. How many blinks per minute? We already did that, 51. So, 51 blinks per minute. So, to find the time, we need to find how many minutes it takes for 459 blinks at that rate. So, 459 divided by 51 is 9.

I think I've verified this in multiple ways: dividing the total blinks by the rate, setting up a proportion, and thinking about unit rates. All lead me to the conclusion that it takes 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

Just to make sure, maybe I can think about how many blinks per second, but that's probably unnecessary unless the question asks for seconds. But since it's in minutes, 9 minutes is the answer.

Alternatively, I can check by multiplying 51 blinks per minute by 9 minutes to see if I get 459. 51*9: 50*9=450, 1*9=9, so total 459. Yep, that's correct.

So, no matter how I approach it, whether by dividing, using proportions, or checking the multiplication, the answer consistently comes out to 9 minutes. I feel confident that 9 minutes is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
It will take the light \boxed{B} minutes to blink 459 times.
</think>

First, we need to determine the rate at which the light blinks. The lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate, we divide the number of blinks by the time:

\[
\frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We use the rate we just found to calculate the time:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

We verified this by setting up a proportion and checking the multiplication, all leading to the same result.

### Final Answer
It will take the light \boxed{B} minutes to blink 459 times.
