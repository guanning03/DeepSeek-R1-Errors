Question:
Tim has a box with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. If he uses 3 blue shoeboxes and 1/3 red of his shoeboxes to go fishing, how many red and blue shoe boxes are left in Tim's box?

Correct Answer:
If Tim uses 3 blue shoeboxes, he remains with 7-3=<<7-3=4>>4 blue shoe boxes in the box.
Tim also uses 1/3 of the red shoeboxes, a total of 1/3*9=<<1/3*9=3>>3 red shoe boxes.
Tim remains with 9-3=<<9-3=6>>6 red shoeboxes.
The total number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10
#### 10

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Tim has a box with some blue shoe boxes and some red shoe boxes. Let me see, he has 7 blue ones and 9 red ones. Hmm, that's 7 plus 9, which is 16 shoe boxes in total. But I don't know if that total is important yet. The question is about how many red and blue shoe boxes are left after he uses some for fishing.

Alright, let's break it down. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing. So, if he originally had 7 blue ones and he uses 3, I can subtract 3 from 7. That should give me the remaining blue shoe boxes. Let me write that down:

7 (original blue) - 3 (used) = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, the tricky part is with the red shoe boxes. It says he uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes to go fishing. So, he doesn't just use 1 red box; he uses a fraction of the total red boxes he has.

He has 9 red shoe boxes in total. To find out what 1/3 of that is, I need to calculate 1/3 of 9. Let me think: 9 divided by 3 is 3. So, he uses 3 red shoe boxes for fishing.

Now, if he used 3 red shoe boxes out of 9, how many are left? I subtract 3 from 9. Let me write that:

9 (original red) - 3 (used) = 6 red shoe boxes left.

So, putting it all together, he has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes remaining. That seems right, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, blue: 7 - 3 = 4. That's correct. Red: 9 divided by 3 is 3, so 9 - 3 = 6. Yep, that adds up. So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left in his box after going fishing.

Wait a second, is there a chance that the 1/3 refers to something else? Like, maybe the total number of shoe boxes? Let me check that. If the total was 16, and he uses 1/3 of that, that would be about 5.333 shoe boxes, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a shoe box. So, no, it must be 1/3 of the red shoe boxes specifically. So, yeah, 3 red shoe boxes used.

Another thing to consider: Is 1/3 of 9 equal to 3? Yes, because 3 times 3 is 9. So, that's correct.

Therefore, I'm confident that Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

**Final Answer**
Tim has \boxed{4} blue shoe boxes and \boxed{6} red shoe boxes left.

Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes and 1/3 of his red shoe boxes for fishing.

First, calculate the remaining blue shoe boxes:
\[
7 \text{ (original blue)} - 3 \text{ (used)} = 4 \text{ blue shoe boxes left}
\]

Next, calculate the number of red shoe boxes used:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ (red)} = 3 \text{ red shoe boxes used}
\]

Then, calculate the remaining red shoe boxes:
\[
9 \text{ (original red)} - 3 \text{ (used)} = 6 \text{ red shoe boxes left}
\]

Thus, Tim has \boxed{4} blue shoe boxes and \boxed{6} red shoe boxes left.
