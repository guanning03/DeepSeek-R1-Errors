Question:
Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later?

Correct Answer:
Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.
The total amount of salary the two earn four years later is $39200+$56000 = $<<39200+56000=95200>>95200
#### 95200

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out the total salary that Adrien and Lylah were earning four years later. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So right now, Adrie's salary is 1.3 times Lylah's. But wait, four years ago, Adrien earned $40,000. Hmm, so I need to figure out Lylah's salary four years ago as well.

Let me denote some variables to make this clearer. Let's say four years ago, Adrien's salary was A_initial = $40,000, and Lylah's salary was L_initial. According to the problem, Adrien's current salary is 30% higher than Lylah's current salary. But I don't know their current salaries yet. Maybe I need to express their current salaries in terms of their initial salaries.

Wait, but the problem also says that four years later, Adrien's salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. So four years ago, Adrien earned $40,000, and now he's earning 40% more than that. Let me calculate that.

40% of $40,000 is 0.4 * 40,000 = $16,000. So his current salary is $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000. Okay, so Adrien's current salary is $56,000.

Now, the problem also mentions that four years later, Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously. Hmm, that might mean that both of their salaries went up at the same time, but I need to figure out by what percentage. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the percentage increase for Lylah, only Adrien's. So perhaps I need to find Lylah's current salary based on the initial information.

Let me recap:

- Four years ago: Adrien earned $40,000.
- Adrien's current salary is 40% higher, so $56,000.
- Currently, Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's current salary.

So, Adrien's current salary is 1.3 times Lylah's current salary.

Let me denote Lylah's current salary as L_current.

So, 56,000 = 1.3 * L_current

Therefore, L_current = 56,000 / 1.3

Let me compute that. 56 divided by 1.3. Hmm, 1.3 goes into 56 four times because 1.3 * 4 = 5.2, but wait, that's not right. Wait, 1.3 * 40 = 52, so 1.3 * 43 ≈ 56? Wait, maybe I should do it more precisely.

56,000 divided by 1.3. Let's compute 56,000 ÷ 1.3.

First, 1.3 * 43,000 = 55,900. Because 1.3 * 40,000 = 52,000, and 1.3 * 3,000 = 3,900, so 52,000 + 3,900 = 55,900. Then, 56,000 - 55,900 = 100. So, 100 ÷ 1.3 is approximately 76.923. So, L_current ≈ 43,000 + 76.923 ≈ 43,076.92.

Hmm, so approximately $43,076.92. So, Lylah's current salary is roughly $43,076.92.

But let me verify that because I might have messed up the division.

Wait, another way: 56,000 ÷ 1.3

Multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal: 560,000 ÷ 13

Now, 13 * 43,000 = 559,000

Subtract: 560,000 - 559,000 = 1,000

So, 1,000 ÷ 13 ≈ 76.923

Thus, total is 43,076.923. So, approximately $43,076.92.

So, Lylah's current salary is approximately $43,076.92.

But the problem says that four years later, both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously. It doesn't specify the percentage, but Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years, going from $40,000 to $56,000.

So, perhaps Lylah also had a salary increase, but we don't know the percentage. But we need to find the total salary four years later, which is Adrien's current salary plus Lylah's current salary, which we just calculated.

Wait, hold on. Is that all? Let me see.

Wait, no, because maybe we need to factor in the increase for Lylah. But the problem says "four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago." It also mentions that Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, but it doesn't specify whether the increase was the same percentage or different.

Hmm, perhaps I need to figure out Lylah's salary four years ago in terms of Adrien's, and then figure out the increase.

Wait, initially, four years ago, Adrien earned $40,000, and Lylah earned L_initial.

But the problem says that Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's at that time. So, four years ago, Adrien's salary = 1.3 * Lylah's salary.

So, 40,000 = 1.3 * L_initial

Therefore, L_initial = 40,000 / 1.3 ≈ 30,769.23

So, four years ago, Lylah earned approximately $30,769.23.

Now, if four years later, both Adrien and Lylah have increased their salaries, with Adrien increasing by 40%, as we found out, and Lylah's salary is now 43,076.92, which I think is her current salary.

But wait, if four years ago, Lylah earned approximately $30,769.23, and now, four years later, she's earning approximately $43,076.92, so her salary increased by about $12,307.69.

Wait, but the problem says that both increased simultaneously. So, maybe their salary increases were the same percentage? Or maybe we have to figure out their individual increases.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the percentage increase for Lylah, only for Adrien. So, maybe we cannot assume that Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider that both had salary increases, but we don't know the percentages. But we can figure out Lylah's current salary from Adrien's current salary and the 30% difference.

We already did that: Adrien's current is $56,000, which is 1.3 times Lylah's current. So, Lylah's current is about $43,076.92.

So, if I need the total salary four years later, that would be Adrien's current + Lylah's current.

So, 56,000 + 43,076.92 ≈ 99,076.92.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether I need to calculate the exact figure or do I need to express it in terms of some variables? Hmm, no, it just says to calculate the total salary four years later.

But, hold on, let me make sure. Maybe I need to relate their salary increases more.

Wait, so four years ago, Adrien earned $40,000, and Lylah earned approximately $30,769.23.

Then, over four years, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so he earned 40% more than he did four years ago.

But for Lylah, we don't know the percentage increase. But perhaps we can find it by knowing that Adrie's current is 1.3 times Lylah's current.

Wait, but we already used that to find Lylah's current. So, perhaps I don't need to worry about Lylah's increase percentage.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just go through the information again.

1. Four years ago: Adrie earned $40,000; Lylah earned L_initial.

2. Adrie's current salary is 1.3 * Lylah's current salary. So, Adrie's current = 1.3 * L_current.

3. Adrie's current is also 40% higher than four years ago, so Adrie_current = 1.4 * Adrie_initial = 1.4 * 40,000 = 56,000.

Therefore, from 2 and 3, we get L_current = 56,000 / 1.3 ≈ 43,076.92.

So, total salary four years later is Adrie_current + L_current ≈ 56,000 + 43,076.92 ≈ 99,076.92.

But the problem says "calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later?" So, that would be approximately $99,076.92.

But let me see if the problem expects an exact fraction or something.

Wait, 56,000 divided by 1.3 is equal to 56,000 * (10/13) = 560,000 / 13. Let me compute that division.

560,000 ÷ 13.

13 * 43,000 = 559,000.

Subtracting, 560,000 - 559,000 = 1,000.

So, 1,000 ÷ 13 is approximately 76.923. So, 43,076.923.

So, 56,000 + 43,076.923 = 99,076.923.

So, approximately $99,076.92.

But, perhaps, to express it as a fraction, 56,000 + (56,000 / 1.3) = 56,000 + (56,000 * 10/13) = 56,000 * (1 + 10/13) = 56,000 * (23/13).

So, 56,000 * 23 / 13.

Compute 56,000 ÷ 13 first.

13*4,000 = 52,000.

56,000 - 52,000 = 4,000.

So, 4,000 ÷ 13 ≈ 307.692.

Therefore, 56,000 ÷ 13 ≈ 4,307.692.

Then, 4,307.692 * 23.

Compute 4,307.692 * 20 = 86,153.84

4,307.692 * 3 = 12,923.076

Add them together: 86,153.84 + 12,923.076 ≈ 99,076.916.

So, approximately $99,076.92.

So, the total salary four years later is approximately $99,076.92.

But let me check if that makes sense with the given information.

Wait, four years ago, Adrie earned $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, Lylah's was $40,000 / 1.3 ≈ $30,769.23.

Then, Lylah's salary increased over four years to become L_current ≈ $43,076.92, which is an increase of about $12,307.69, which is roughly a 39.99% increase (12,307.69 / 30,769.23 ≈ 0.3999, so ~40%).

Wait, that's interesting. So, both Adrie and Lylah had roughly a 40% increase in their salaries over four years. Is that correct?

Wait, Adrie's increase was 40% over four years, going from $40,000 to $56,000. So, 16,000 increase, which is 40%.

Lylah's increase was from ~$30,769.23 to ~$43,076.92, which is an increase of ~$12,307.69. So, 12,307.69 / 30,769.23 ≈ 0.3999, so approximately 40% as well.

So, both had approximately a 40% increase in their salaries over the four years.

So, that makes sense. So, their salary increases were the same percentage, 40%.

Therefore, Lylah's current salary is 1.4 times her salary four years ago, which is 1.4 * 30,769.23 ≈ 43,076.92.

Thus, total salary four years later is 56,000 + 43,076.92 ≈ 99,076.92.

So, to express the total as a box, I might need to write it as $99,076.92 or as a fraction.

Wait, but 99,076.92 is approximately $99,076.92.

But let me verify if 56,000 / 1.3 is exactly 43,076.9230769...

Yes, because 1.3 times 43,076.9230769 is 56,000.

So, 56,000 + 43,076.9230769 ≈ 99,076.9230769.

So, approximately $99,076.92.

Alternatively, if I want to write it as a fraction, 99,076.9230769 is equal to 99,076 and 12/13 dollars, because 0.9230769 is approximately 12/13.

12 divided by 13 is approximately 0.9230769.

So, 12/13 is about 0.9230769.

Therefore, Lylah's current salary is 43,076.9230769, which is equal to 43,076 + 12/13.

Similarly, total salary is 99,076 + 12/13, which is 99,076.9230769.

So, in fractional terms, it's 99,076 12/13 dollars.

But in the problem statement, it's not specified whether to present as a fraction or decimal. Since the original salary was $40,000, which is a whole number, but the percentage increases resulted in fractions, so it's probably okay to present it as a decimal.

Alternatively, to present it as a fraction, 99,076 12/13.

But for the sake of the answer, I think it's better to write it as a decimal, rounded to the nearest cent, which would be $99,076.92.

So, putting it all together, the total salary four years later is approximately $99,076.92.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Adrie's current salary: 40% increase from 40,000, so 40,000 * 1.4 = 56,000. Correct.

2. Adrie's current salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, so Lylah's current salary is 56,000 / 1.3 ≈ 43,076.92. Correct.

3. So, total salary is 56,000 + 43,076.92 ≈ 99,076.92. Correct.

So, yeah, that seems right.

But just to think again, the problem says "four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago." So, Adrie's salary increased by 40%, which we used. It also says "simultaneously, and Adrie earned $40,000 four years ago." So, they both had salary increases, but the problem doesn't specify Lylah's percentage, so we had to figure out her current salary from Adrie's.

Wait, another way is to think that if both had the same percentage increase, then 40% makes sense because Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately 30,769.23, and with a 40% increase, it's 43,076.92, which is exactly Adrie's current salary divided by 1.3. So, that seems consistent.

Therefore, I think the answer is $99,076.92.

**Final Answer**
The total salary the two were receiving four years later was \boxed{99076.92}.
</think>

Adrie's current salary is 40% higher than his salary four years ago, which was $40,000. Therefore, Adrie's current salary is calculated as follows:

\[
40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000
\]

Adrie's current salary is 1.3 times Lylah's current salary. Let \( L_{\text{current}} \) be Lylah's current salary. We have:

\[
56,000 = 1.3 \times L_{\text{current}}
\]

Solving for \( L_{\text{current}} \):

\[
L_{\text{current}} = \frac{56,000}{1.3} \approx 43,076.92
\]

The total salary four years later is the sum of Adrie's current salary and Lylah's current salary:

\[
56,000 + 43,076.92 \approx 99,076.92
\]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

\[
\boxed{99076.92}
\]
