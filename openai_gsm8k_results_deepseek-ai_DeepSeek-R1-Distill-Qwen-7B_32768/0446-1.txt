Question:
Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. He earns $10 per hour and gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Watson make in April if the company performed very well for the whole month?

Correct Answer:
In a day, Watson makes 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100
If he works five days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 5 * 4= <<5*4=20>>20 days.
Since he makes $100 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 20 * 100= $<<20*100=2000>>2000.
He also got a 300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of April.
At the end of April, he earned 2000 +1200 = $<<2000+1200=3200>>3200.
#### 3200

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the total number of hours Watson worked in April. Since April has 30 days and he works 10 hours each day, the total hours are 30 multiplied by 10, which equals 300 hours.

Next, I'll determine his earnings from the hourly wage by multiplying the total hours by his hourly rate of $10. This gives Watson $3,000.

 Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week for performing well. Given that April has 4 weeks, his total bonus would be 4 multiplied by $300, resulting in $1,200.

Finally, I'll add his earnings from the hourly wage and the total bonus to find his total earnings for the month. Adding $3,000 and $1,200 gives Watson a total of $4,200 for April.

Sure, let's break down Watson's earnings for April step by step.

### **Step 1: Calculate Total Hours Worked in April**

- **Number of days in April:** 30 days
- **Hours worked per day:** 10 hours

\[
\text{Total Hours} = 30 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 300 \text{ hours}
\]

### **Step 2: Calculate Earnings from Hourly Wage**

- **Hourly wage:** \$10 per hour

\[
\text{Hourly Earnings} = 300 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$3,000
\]

### **Step 3: Calculate Weekly Bonus and Total Bonuses for April**

- **Weekly bonus:** \$300
- **Number of weeks in April:** 4 weeks

\[
\text{Total Bonuses} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$300/\text{week} = \$1,200
\]

### **Step 4: Calculate Total Earnings for April**

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Hourly Earnings} + \text{Total Bonuses} = \$3,000 + \$1,200 = \$4,200
\]

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{4200}
\]
