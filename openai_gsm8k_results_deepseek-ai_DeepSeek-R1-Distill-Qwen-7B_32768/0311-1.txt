Question:
Tim gets a promotion that offers him a 5% raise on his $20000 a month salary.  It also gives him a bonus worth half a month's salary. How much money will he make in a year?

Correct Answer:
The promotion increased his monthly salary by 20000*.05=$<<20000*0.05=1000>>1000
So his new salary is 20000+1000=$<<20000+1000=21000>>21000 a month
So he makes 21000*12=$<<21000*12=252000>>252,000 a year
The bonus is worth 21000*.5=$<<21000*.5=10500>>10500
So he makes 252,000+10,500=$<<252000+10500=262500>>262,500 for the year
#### 262500

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Tim got a promotion, and now he's getting a 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary. Plus, he also gets a bonus that's worth half a month's salary. I need to figure out how much he'll make in a year. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's tackle the raise. He's getting a 5% increase on his current salary of $20,000. I remember that to calculate a percentage increase, you multiply the original amount by the percentage (converted to decimal). So, 5% as a decimal is 0.05. 

So, the raise amount would be 20,000 multiplied by 0.05. Let me write that down: 20,000 * 0.05. Hmm, 20,000 times 0.05. Well, 20,000 divided by 100 is 200, so 5% of 20,000 is 1,000. So, Tim's raise is $1,000 per month. That means his new monthly salary is the original $20,000 plus $1,000, which is $21,000. 

Okay, got that part. Now, onto the bonus. The bonus is worth half a month's salary. His current salary is $20,000, so half of that would be 20,000 divided by 2. Let me calculate that: 20,000 / 2 = 10,000. So, his bonus is $10,000 per month. 

Wait, hold on. Is the bonus in addition to his new salary or replacing it? The question says it's a bonus worth half a month's salary. I think it's in addition to his salary, so he gets his raise plus the bonus each month. So, each month he would earn his new salary, which is $21,000, plus the $10,000 bonus. 

So, let me add those together. $21,000 plus $10,000 is $31,000. Therefore, Tim's total monthly income is $31,000. 

Now, the question is asking for his annual income. So, I need to figure out how much he makes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, I can multiply his monthly income by 12. 

So, $31,000 multiplied by 12. Hmm, let me do that calculation. 31,000 times 12. I can break this down as 30,000 * 12 plus 1,000 * 12. 

30,000 * 12: Well, 30,000 times 10 is 300,000, and 30,000 times 2 is 60,000, so adding those together, 300,000 + 60,000 = 360,000. 

Then, 1,000 * 12 is straightforward: 12,000. 

Adding those two results together: 360,000 + 12,000 equals 372,000. 

So, putting it all together, Tim's annual income after the raise and bonus would be $372,000. 

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with the raise: 5% of 20,000 is 1,000, so his new salary is 21,000. The bonus is half of 20,000, which is 10,000, so adding that to his salary gives 31,000 per month. Then, 31,000 times 12 is indeed 372,000. 

Hmm, seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let me calculate 31,000 * 12 another way. 31,000 * 12 can be thought of as 31,000 multiplied by 10 (which is 310,000) plus 31,000 multiplied by 2 (which is 62,000). Adding those together, 310,000 + 62,000 equals 372,000. Yep, same result. 

So, I think I'm confident that Tim's annual income is $372,000. 

Just to recap, breaking it down step by step: 

1. Original monthly salary: $20,000.
2. 5% raise: 20,000 * 0.05 = $1,000 raise.
3. New monthly salary: $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.
4. Bonus: half of original salary, so $20,000 / 2 = $10,000.
5. Total monthly income: $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.
6. Annual income: $31,000 * 12 = $372,000.

Everything adds up, so I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
Tim will make \boxed{372000} dollars in a year.
</think>

Tim's original monthly salary is $20,000. He receives a 5% raise, which is calculated as follows:

\[
20,000 \times 0.05 = 1,000
\]

Adding this raise to his original salary, his new monthly salary is:

\[
20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000
\]

Additionally, Tim receives a bonus worth half a month's salary. Half of his original salary is:

\[
20,000 \div 2 = 10,000
\]

Adding the bonus to his new salary, his total monthly income is:

\[
21,000 + 10,000 = 31,000
\]

To find his annual income, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:

\[
31,000 \times 12 = 372,000
\]

Thus, Tim will make \boxed{372000} dollars in a year.
