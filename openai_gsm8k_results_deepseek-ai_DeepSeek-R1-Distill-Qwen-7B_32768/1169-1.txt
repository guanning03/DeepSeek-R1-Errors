Question:
If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000/year. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?

Correct Answer:
First find how many years Marcy works after 20 years: 30 years - 20 years = <<30-20=10>>10 years
Then multiply that number by the amount of her pension she gets per year: 10 years * 5% = 50%
Then multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out Marcy's annual pension when she quits after 30 years. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, it says that if Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000/year. So, that seems straightforward. If she works 40 years, she retires and gets $50k each year. 

Then, it mentions that starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. Hmm, okay. So, before 20 years, maybe she didn't get a pension or it was different? Wait, the problem doesn't specify what she gets before 20 years. Maybe it's implied that after 20 years, she starts receiving 5% of the value of the pension? Or is it 5% of something else?

Wait, let me read that again. "Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year." So, perhaps after 20 years, she gets 5% of the original pension amount each year? Or is it 5% of her current pension value?

Wait, the problem says "she gets an annual pension of $50,000/year" for 40 years. So, maybe that's her full pension if she works 40 years. Then, starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. So, does that mean when she works 20 years, she starts getting 5% of $50k, which is $2,500, or is it 5% of her pension at that point?

This part is a bit confusing. Let me try to parse it again.

Original pension: $50,000/year for 40 years.

Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Hmm, so perhaps 5% of the present value of her pension or something? Maybe it's 5% of her current pension value as it stands when she reaches 20 years.

Wait, but if she works for 20 years, her pension is still $50,000/year, right? Because she hasn't reached 40 yet. So, does she then get 5% of that $50k? That would be $2,500 per year? But that seems low.

Alternatively, maybe it's 5% of the accumulated pension value up to that point. So, if she gets $50k per year for 20 years, the total accumulated pension would be $1,000,000. Then, 5% of that would be $50,000. So, is she then entitled to 5% of that $50,000, which is $2,500? Hmm, that seems similar.

Wait, but the wording says "5% of the value of the pension per year." So, maybe it's 5% of the current value of the pension each year? Or is it 5% of the original pension amount?

I think I might need to clarify this. Let me try to reconstruct.

If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets $50k/year. So, that's her full pension. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Wait, maybe it's 5% of her original pension amount, which is $50k, so 5% is $2,500. So, starting after 20 years, she gets an additional $2,500 per year?

But the question is, if she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?

Wait, so maybe her pension is increasing over time, and when she quits, she gets a higher pension based on how long she worked?

Wait, let me think again.

Original pension: $50k/year when she works 40 years. Starting after 20 years, she gets 5% of the pension's value per year. So, perhaps the pension is increasing by 5% each year after 20 years.

Wait, that might make sense. So, if she starts working, her pension is $50k/year. After 20 years, her pension increases by 5% each year. So, if she works 30 years, her pension would have increased by 5% for each year after 20, right?

Wait, no. Maybe it's that starting after 20 years, she is entitled to 5% of the pension per year. So, perhaps she gets an additional 5% on top of her original pension?

Wait, this is confusing. Let me try to break it down.

1. If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets $50k/year.

2. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Hmm, so perhaps after 20 years, the value of her pension increases by 5% each year? Or does she get 5% more per year?

Wait, maybe it's a percentage increase each year. So, if she works for 40 years, she gets $50k/year, but if she quits after 30 years, she might get a higher pension because she's been working longer.

But how?

Wait, maybe the 5% is applied to her original pension each year after 20. So, her pension would be $50k for the first 20 years, and then starting year 21, she gets 5% more each year? So, each subsequent year, her pension increases by 5%?

Wait, that could be. So, for the first 20 years, she gets $50k/year. Then, from year 21 to year 40, her pension increases by 5% each year.

But the question is, if she quits after 30 years, what is her annual pension?

So, her pension would have been increasing by 5% each year for the last 10 years after she reached year 20.

So, starting at $50k, each year it increases by 5% for 10 years.

So, her pension when she quits at 30 years would be $50k multiplied by (1 + 0.05)^10.

Wait, that seems like a possible interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe she gets 5% per year as an additional amount, so her pension is $50k plus 5% of $50k each year.

Wait, but 5% of $50k is $2,500, so if she gets that each year, her pension would be $52,500/year starting from year 21.

But then, each subsequent year, would that 5% increase again? So, each year, her pension increases by 5% of the current pension.

Which would be similar to compounding.

So, in that case, the pension at year 30 would be $50,000 * (1 + 0.05)^10.

Alternatively, perhaps her pension is being increased by 5% each year, so it's a 5% increase per year, compounded over 10 years.

So, let me calculate that.

First, let me recall the formula for compound interest: A = P * (1 + r)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount, r is the rate, and n is the number of years.

So, in this case, P is $50,000, r is 5%, so 0.05, and n is 10 years.

So, A = 50,000 * (1 + 0.05)^10.

Let me compute (1.05)^10.

I remember that (1.05)^10 is approximately 1.62889.

So, A ≈ 50,000 * 1.62889 ≈ 50,000 * 1.62889.

Calculating that: 50,000 * 1.62889.

Well, 50,000 * 1 = 50,000.

50,000 * 0.62889 = 50,000 * 0.6 = 30,000; 50,000 * 0.02889 ≈ 1,444.5.

So, 30,000 + 1,444.5 ≈ 31,444.5.

So, total A ≈ 50,000 + 31,444.5 ≈ 81,444.5.

So, approximately $81,444.50 per year.

But let me check the exact value of (1.05)^10.

I can compute it step by step:

1.05^1 = 1.05

1.05^2 = 1.1025

1.05^3 = 1.157625

1.05^4 = 1.21550625

1.05^5 = 1.2762815625

1.05^6 ≈ 1.3400956406

1.05^7 ≈ 1.4071004226

1.05^8 ≈ 1.4774554437

1.05^9 ≈ 1.5513282159

1.05^10 ≈ 1.628894627

Yes, so it's approximately 1.628894627.

So, 50,000 * 1.628894627 ≈ 50,000 * 1.628894627.

Compute 50,000 * 1.628894627:

First, 50,000 * 1 = 50,000.

50,000 * 0.628894627 = ?

Compute 50,000 * 0.6 = 30,000

50,000 * 0.028894627 = ?

0.028894627 * 50,000 = 1,444.73135

So, 30,000 + 1,444.73135 ≈ 31,444.73

So, total A ≈ 50,000 + 31,444.73 ≈ 81,444.73

So, approximately $81,444.73 per year.

Therefore, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension would be approximately $81,444.73.

But wait, let me make sure that's the correct interpretation. The problem says, "starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year."

So, is this 5% of the original $50k, or 5% of the current pension value each year?

If it's 5% of the original $50k, then each year after 20, she gets an additional $2,500, so her pension would be $52,500 in year 21, $55,125 in year 22, and so on.

But that's a linear increase, not compounding. So, in that case, her pension in year 30 would be $50k + ($2,500 * 10) = $50k + $25k = $75k.

But that's different from the previous result.

So, which interpretation is correct?

The problem says, "starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year."

Hmm, "5% of the value of the pension per year." So, 5% per year of the pension's value. So, that could mean 5% per year of the original value, which is $50k, so $2,500 per year, making her total pension $52,500. But that's 5% of the original value each year.

Alternatively, it could be 5% of the current value of the pension each year, meaning that the pension increases by 5% annually.

So, which one is it?

The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let's look again:

"Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year."

It says "5% of the value of the pension per year." So, "value" might refer to the current value of the pension.

So, perhaps each year after 20, her pension increases by 5% of the current value.

So, that would mean compounding.

Therefore, it's more likely that her pension increases by 5% each year after 20, leading to the higher amount of approximately $81,444.73.

Alternatively, if it's 5% of the original value each year, it would be a flat increase of $2,500 per year.

But the problem says "5% of the value," which is a bit vague, but in pension contexts, it's common to have a percentage increase each year.

So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that her pension increases by 5% each year after 20 years.

Therefore, the annual pension when she quits after 30 years is approximately $81,444.73.

Alternatively, if it's a flat 5% of the original value each year, then it's $52,500 per year.

But let's see if there's another way to interpret it.

Wait, the problem says, "If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000/year."

So, that's her total pension over 40 years. So, that's $50k per year for 40 years.

Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Wait, so perhaps the 5% is of the total pension value up to that point?

So, for the first 20 years, she gets $50k/year, so total pension is $1,000,000.

Then, starting after 20 years, 5% of that total is $50,000. So, she gets an additional $50,000 per year?

Wait, but that seems too much.

Wait, 5% of the total pension value is 5% of $1,000,000, which is $50,000. So, perhaps after 20 years, she gets an additional $50,000 per year.

But that seems different from what I thought before.

Wait, but the problem says "she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year." So, it's 5% of the value, which is per year.

Wait, so maybe each year, she gets 5% of the total value of the pension up to that year.

Wait, that would be different.

So, in the first 20 years, her total pension value is $1,000,000.

In year 21, her total pension value would be $1,050,000, so 5% of that is $52,500.

In year 22, total pension value is $1,100,000, so 5% is $55,000, and so on.

Wait, that's a bit different interpretation.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, it's "5% of the value of the pension per year." So, if the value is the total pension value up to that year, then each year after 20, she gets 5% of the total up to that year.

But that seems a bit more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe it's 5% of the annual pension value.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to rephrase the problem.

Original pension: $50k/year for 40 years.

Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

So, after 20 years, her pension is still $50k/year, right?

Wait, but when she quits after 30 years, what is her annual pension?

Wait, maybe the 5% is applied to her original pension each year after 20. So, her pension increases by 5% each year for 10 years, resulting in a total of $50k*(1.05)^10 ≈ $81,444.73.

Alternatively, if the 5% is applied to the total pension value each year, that's different.

But I think the first interpretation is more likely, that it's a 5% increase each year on the original pension, leading to compounding.

So, with that, the annual pension after 30 years would be approximately $81,444.73.

But to be precise, let's calculate it more accurately.

Compute (1.05)^10:

We know that ln(1.05) ≈ 0.04879.

So, ln(1.05^10) = 10 * 0.04879 ≈ 0.4879.

Then, exponentiate: e^0.4879 ≈ 1.629.

Which is consistent with our earlier calculation.

So, 50,000 * 1.629 ≈ 81,450.

So, approximately $81,450.

Alternatively, more accurately, 1.05^10 is approximately 1.628894627.

So, 50,000 * 1.628894627 ≈ 81,444.73.

So, approximately $81,444.73.

Therefore, her annual pension when she quits after 30 years would be approximately $81,444.73.

But let me make sure that this is the correct interpretation.

Another way to think about it is, if working 40 years gives $50k/year, then the present value of that is 40*$50k, which is $2,000,000, assuming some discount rate.

But the problem doesn't mention anything about present value, so maybe that's not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5% is an additional amount each year after 20.

So, for the first 20 years, she gets $50k/year.

Then, from year 21 to year 40, she gets 5% more each year.

So, year 21: $50k * 1.05 = $52,500

Year 22: $52,500 * 1.05 = $55,125

...

Up to year 40.

But if she quits at year 30, her pension in year 30 would be $50k * (1.05)^10 ≈ $81,444.73.

So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, if she quits at year 30, is her annual pension $81,444.73?

Alternatively, if the 5% is applied to the total pension value each year, then each year after 20, she gets 5% more of the total pension up to that year.

But that seems more complicated.

Wait, let me think.

If her pension is $50k/year for 40 years, the total value is $2,000,000.

Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. So, maybe each year after 20, she gets 5% of $2,000,000, which is $100,000 per year. That seems too high, but the problem says "5% of the value of the pension per year."

Alternatively, is the value referring to the current year's pension?

Wait, maybe it's 5% of the current year's pension.

So, for year 21, it's 5% of $50k, which is $2,500.

For year 22, it's 5% of the previous year's pension plus the increase.

Wait, no, that might not make sense.

Alternatively, it might be 5% of the accumulated pension up to that year.

So, for year 21, accumulated pension is $1,050,000, so 5% is $52,500.

For year 22, accumulated pension is $1,102,500, so 5% is $55,125.

Wait, but if that's the case, each year she's getting 5% of the accumulated value, which is a different calculation.

But in that case, her pension after 30 years would be 5% of the total accumulated pension up to each year.

But that seems a bit more complicated.

Wait, but the problem says "she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year." So, "value" is a bit ambiguous. It could be 5% of the current year's pension, or 5% of the total value.

But if it's 5% of the total value each year, then she would be getting an increasing amount each year.

But in that case, her pension isn't a flat amount anymore, but an increasing amount. So, for each year after 20, she gets 5% of the total pension value up to that year.

But then, her total pension would be the sum of those 5% amounts each year.

Wait, that would be different.

Wait, let me try to parse it again.

The problem says:

"If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000/year. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?"

So, the key is: Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.

So, the "pension" here is the total pension she has accumulated up to that point?

So, maybe after 20 years, she has a total pension value of $1,000,000.

Starting from year 21, each year she gets 5% of that total value.

But that doesn't make much sense because 5% of $1,000,000 is $50,000, so she would be getting $50,000 each year after 20. So, for 20 years, she would get $50,000/year, and for the next 20 years, she would get $50,000/year.

Wait, but that seems like she's getting the same amount for the first 20 and the next 20.

But if she quits after 30 years, her annual pension would be $50,000.

But that contradicts the idea of getting 5% of the value.

Wait, maybe it's 5% of the value each year, meaning 5% of the previous year's pension.

So, in that case, it's a 5% increase each year.

So, starting at $50k, each year it increases by 5%.

Then, in year 30, it would be $50k * (1.05)^10 ≈ $81,444.73.

So, that seems more plausible.

Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that starting after 20 years, her pension increases by 5% each year, so her annual pension when she quits after 30 years is approximately $81,444.73.

So, rounding to the nearest dollar, that's approximately $81,445.

But to represent it as a precise amount, it's $50,000 multiplied by (1.05)^10.

Alternatively, we can express it as an exact amount.

But since the question is asking for the annual pension, we can write it as $50,000*(1.05)^10.

But perhaps they want the numerical value.

So, 1.05^10 is approximately 1.628894627.

So, 50,000 * 1.628894627 ≈ 81,444.73.

So, approximately $81,444.73.

Therefore, the annual pension when she quits after 30 years is approximately $81,444.73.

So, writing that in the required format, it would be \boxed{81445} if rounded to the nearest dollar, or if we keep it precise, it's approximately $81,444.73.

But since the original pension was in whole dollars, maybe we can round to the nearest dollar.

So, $81,444.73 is approximately $81,445.

Hence, the final answer is \boxed{81445}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{81445}
</think>

Marcy's annual pension if she works for the same company for 40 years is $50,000/year. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, we need to determine her annual pension.

1. Marcy's pension for the first 20 years is $50,000/year.
2. Starting after 20 years, her pension increases by 5% each year.
3. This 5% increase is compounded annually.
4. The formula for compound interest is \( A = P \times (1 + r)^n \), where:
   - \( P \) is the principal amount ($50,000),
   - \( r \) is the annual increase rate (5% or 0.05),
   - \( n \) is the number of years (10 years from year 21 to year 30).

Calculating the compound interest:
\[ A = 50,000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{10} \]
\[ A = 50,000 \times (1.05)^{10} \]
\[ A \approx 50,000 \times 1.628894627 \]
\[ A \approx 81,444.73 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the annual pension when Marcy quits after 30 years is approximately $81,445.

\[
\boxed{81445}
\]
