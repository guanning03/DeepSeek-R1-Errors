Question:
Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each for a 3-month installment. A 2% interest will be charged for each unit. How much will Shiela pay each month for 3 months?

Correct Answer:
A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.
So, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.
The total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.
Thus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Shiela bought five cell phones, each costing $150. She's going to pay for them over three months, and there's a 2% interest on each unit. I need to figure out how much she'll pay each month. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest. She bought five phones at $150 each. So, that would be 5 multiplied by $150. Let me write that out:

5 * $150 = total cost.

Calculating that, 5 times 150 is 750. So, the total cost before interest is $750.

Now, there's a 2% interest charged on each unit. Hmm, does that mean 2% per unit per month, or 2% total on all units? The question says "a 2% interest will be charged for each unit." Hmm, maybe that's 2% per unit? But that seems a bit high. Maybe it's a total of 2% on the entire amount? Let me think.

Wait, usually when you buy something on installment with interest, it's usually a percentage per unit, but sometimes it's a total. Let me see if I can figure this out from the context. It says "a 2% interest will be charged for each unit." Hmm, that could mean 2% per unit per period, but with three months, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 2% of the total amount as interest.

Wait, let me read the question again: "A 2% interest will be charged for each unit." So, maybe it's 2% per unit? But that would mean each phone has 2% interest, so each phone would cost $150 plus 2% of $150. Then, total interest would be 5 times that.

Alternatively, maybe it's 2% per month on the entire amount. Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear. But let me try both interpretations and see which one makes more sense.

First, let's do the first interpretation: 2% interest on each unit. So, for each phone, the interest would be 2% of $150. Let's calculate that.

2% of $150 is 0.02 * 150 = $3 per phone.

So, each phone would cost $150 + $3 = $153. Since she bought five phones, total cost including interest would be 5 * $153.

Calculating that: 5 * 153 = 765.

So, total cost including interest is $765.

Alternatively, if the 2% is on the entire amount, then total interest would be 2% of $750.

2% of 750 is 0.02 * 750 = $15.

So, total cost including interest would be $750 + $15 = $765.

Wait, both interpretations lead to the same total amount of $765. Hmm, interesting. So, whether it's 2% per unit or 2% total, the total interest comes out to $15, so total cost is $765.

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. If it's 2% per unit, each phone is $150 plus 2% interest, so $153 per phone, five phones would be $765.

If it's 2% on the total, $750 plus 2% is $765 as well. So, in either case, the total amount Shiela has to pay is $765.

So, then, since she's paying over three months, we need to divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

So, $765 divided by 3 is... Let me calculate that.

765 divided by 3: 3 goes into 7 twice (3*2=6), remainder 1. Bring down the 6, making 16. 3 goes into 16 five times (3*5=15), remainder 1. Bring down the 5, making 15. 3 goes into 15 five times. So, altogether, that's 255.

So, $255 each month.

Wait, let me just make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, total cost is $765, spread over three months, so $255 per month. That seems straightforward.

But let me just make sure about the interest calculation. If it's 2% per unit, is that 2% per month or over three months? The question says "a 2% interest will be charged for each unit." I think it's per unit per month, but that seems high. Alternatively, it could be a total 2% interest on the entire amount over three months.

Wait, maybe the question is saying that 2% interest is charged each month on each unit? So, each phone would accrue 2% interest each month. Then, since she's paying over three months, each phone would have 2% interest each month.

So, let me think about that. If each phone is $150, and each month, 2% is charged on top. So, each month, the amount for each phone would be multiplied by 1.02, right?

Wait, but that's compound interest, isn't it? Or is it simple interest?

Hmm, the question doesn't specify, so maybe I should assume simple interest. But let's see.

Wait, if it's simple interest, then each month, Shiela would pay 2% of the original amount, not of the current balance. But actually, for installment loans, usually, it's simple interest. So, perhaps each month, 2% of the principal is added.

But this is getting a bit confusing. Let me clarify.

Wait, the initial total is $750. If it's 2% interest per unit, maybe 2% per month. Hmm, but that's unclear. Alternatively, the question might mean that for each unit, a 2% interest is charged over the three months. So, 2% of the purchase price per unit, so per phone.

So, 2% of $150 is $3, so each phone is $153, total $765, which is then divided by 3, giving $255 per month.

Alternatively, if the 2% is an annual interest rate, but it's charged over three months, so 6% over three months. But the question says "a 2% interest will be charged for each unit." So, maybe it's 2% per unit per month.

Wait, but 2% per month on $150 is $3, so each phone would accumulate $3 in interest each month. Over three months, that would be $9 per phone, so total interest would be 5 * $9 = $45. So, total cost would be $750 + $45 = $795, which would make the monthly payment $795 / 3 = $265.

But that's different from the $765 total.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to figure out whether the 2% is a monthly interest or an annual interest.

Wait, the problem says "for each unit." It doesn't specify the period, so maybe it's a flat 2% on the total amount. So, 2% of $750 is $15, so total amount is $765, which is $255 each month.

Alternatively, if it's 2% per unit per month, that's a lot. 2% of $150 is $3 per month per phone, so over three months, that's $9 per phone, total $45, so total cost is $795, which is $265 per month.

But the question isn't clear on whether the 2% is per month or total. Hmm.

Wait, let me look at the wording again: "A 2% interest will be charged for each unit." So, it says "for each unit," but it doesn't specify the period. So, maybe it's 2% of the purchase price per unit, regardless of the period. So, 2% of $150 is $3, so total interest is 5 * $3 = $15, so total cost is $765, which is $255 per month.

Alternatively, maybe it's 2% per month on each unit, which would be 2% of $150 is $3 per month per phone, so 5 phones would be $15 per month, so total interest over three months is $45, so total cost is $750 + $45 = $795, so $265 per month.

But without knowing whether the 2% is per month or total, it's ambiguous. Hmm.

Wait, if it's 2% per unit, without specifying the period, it's unclear whether it's per month or per year or something else. Maybe the context of the question suggests that it's per month because it's over three months.

Wait, let me think of the units. It says "for each unit," so maybe it's 2% per unit per month. So, each month, each phone is charged 2% interest.

But then, let's compute that. Each phone is $150, so 2% per month is $3 per phone per month. So, over three months, each phone would accrue $3 * 3 = $9. So, each phone's total cost would be $150 + $9 = $159. So, five phones would be $159 * 5 = $795. So, Shiela would pay $795 over three months, which is $265 per month.

Alternatively, if the 2% is an annual rate, but it's being charged over three months, which is a quarter of a year, so 2% per unit per year would be 0.5% per unit per month. So, 0.5% of $150 is $0.75 per phone per month, so over three months, that's $2.25 per phone, so total interest is 5 * $2.25 = $11.25, so total cost is $750 + $11.25 = $761.25, so monthly payment is $761.25 / 3 = approximately $253.75.

But the problem didn't specify whether it's an annual rate or something else. So, this is a bit of a confusion.

Wait, maybe I should just interpret it as a total interest of 2% on the total amount. So, 2% of $750 is $15, so total amount to pay is $765, so $255 per month. That seems straightforward.

Alternatively, if the 2% is per unit, but it's per month, then it's $3 per phone per month, so $15 per month for five phones, so total is $765, same as before. Wait, no. Wait, hold on.

Wait, if it's 2% per unit per month, then each phone's interest is $3 per month, so over three months, each phone is $9, so total interest is $45, so total amount is $750 + $45 = $795, which is $265 per month.

But if it's 2% total interest on the entire amount, then it's $15, so total amount is $765, which is $255 per month.

So, depending on interpretation, the answer is either $255 or $265.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased as "a 2% interest will be charged for each unit." So, each unit (each phone) will have 2% interest. So, if it's on each unit, perhaps it's 2% per unit, but over three months.

Hmm, maybe we need to think in terms of simple interest.

So, simple interest is calculated as principal * rate * time.

So, if the principal is the total amount, which is $750, and the rate is 2% per period, but over three periods.

Wait, but if it's 2% per unit, not per period.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that the 2% is per unit, so per phone, 2% of their cost, and she's paying over three months. So, each phone's interest is 2% of $150, which is $3, and that's it. So, she doesn't pay more interest over time, so total interest is $15, so total amount is $765, so $255 per month.

But if the interest is compounded monthly, then each phone would accrue 2% interest each month, so after three months, each phone's amount would be 150*(1 + 0.02)^3.

Calculating that: 1.02^3 is approximately 1.061208, so 150 * 1.061208 is approximately 159.1812. So, each phone would be approximately $159.18, so five phones would be 5 * 159.1812 ≈ 795.906, so total amount is approximately $795.91, so monthly payment is 795.91 / 3 ≈ 265.30.

So, approximately $265.30 per month.

But the question didn't specify whether it's simple or compound interest. Hmm.

Wait, in installment loans, typically, the interest is calculated on the remaining balance, so it's compound interest. So, each month, the interest is calculated on the outstanding balance.

But in this case, since she's paying all three months at the end, it's more like simple interest.

Wait, but if she's paying monthly, the interest would be on the remaining balance each month. So, let's model it as such.

So, total principal is $750. Each month, she makes a payment, which goes towards the interest first, then the principal.

So, let's assume she's paying each month, and each month, the interest is 2% on the remaining balance.

Wait, but the question says "a 2% interest will be charged for each unit." Hmm, maybe each unit incurs 2% interest per month.

Wait, now I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, maybe it's 2% per month on each unit.

Wait, perhaps the way to interpret it is that for each unit, a 2% interest is charged each month.

So, each phone would have 2% interest per month, so each month, each phone's balance increases by 2%.

So, over three months, each phone would be 150*(1.02)^3.

As I calculated earlier, approximately 159.18 per phone, so total is 795.90, so approximately $795.90 total, so $265.30 per month.

But, in the problem, she's buying five phones, so she's going to pay each month for three months. If it's compound interest, the total amount would be higher.

But the problem doesn't specify whether the interest is compounded or not. Hmm.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Without more information, maybe the intended interpretation is simple interest on the total amount, so 2% of 750 is 15, so total amount is 765, so 255 per month.

Alternatively, if the interest is on each unit per month, then it's 2% of 150 per phone per month, so 3 per phone per month, so over three months, 9 per phone, total 45, so total payment 795, so 265 per month.

Hmm.

Wait, since the question says "for each unit," maybe it's 2% per unit, which would be 2% of 150, which is 3 per phone, so 5 phones would be 15 in total interest. So, total amount is 765, so 255 per month.

Alternatively, if it's 2% per unit over three months, that's 2% of 150 over three months, which is still 3 per phone per month, so 9 per phone, 45 total.

Wait, maybe the question is written as "2% interest will be charged for each unit," which could be interpreted as 2% per unit per month.

But since the user hasn't specified, it's difficult.

Wait, let me see the original problem again:

"Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each for a 3-month installment. A 2% interest will be charged for each unit. How much will Shiela pay each month for 3 months?"

So, maybe the key is that it's 2% interest for each unit, so per phone, per month. So, each phone would have 2% interest per month.

Therefore, it's 2% simple interest per month per phone.

So, each phone would have $150, and each month, 2% is added.

So, over three months, each phone's amount would be:

First month: 150 + 2% of 150 = 153

Second month: 153 + 2% of 150 = 153 + 3 = 156

Wait, no, if it's simple interest, it's 2% per month on the principal, so each month, it's 150 + 3 = 153, but if it's compound, it's 153 in the first month, then 153 + 3.06 in the second month? Wait, no, 2% of 153 is 3.06.

But the problem is unclear.

Wait, maybe it's 2% of the principal each month, so simple interest.

So, each phone: 150 + 3*3 = 150 + 9 = 159.

So, total for five phones: 5*159 = 795, so 795 over three months, so 265 per month.

Alternatively, if it's compound interest, each month, the 2% is on the current balance, so:

First month: 150 + 3 = 153

Second month: 153 + 3.06 = 156.06

Third month: 156.06 + 3.1212 = 159.1812

So, per phone: approximately 159.18, so five phones: 5*159.18 = 795.90

Total payment: 795.90, so monthly payment: approximately 265.30.

But given that it's a 3-month installment, if she pays monthly, the interest calculation is usually simple interest.

So, maybe the intended answer is simple interest.

So, total principal is 5*150 = 750

Interest: 2% per month? Or 2% over three months?

Wait, the problem says "a 2% interest will be charged for each unit." So, maybe 2% per unit, each month.

So, per phone, 2% per month.

So, each phone: 150 + (150 * 0.02 * 3) = 150 + 9 = 159

So, total per month: 5*159 = 795, so 795 / 3 = 265 per month.

Alternatively, if it's 2% total interest over three months, then 2% of 750 is 15, so total amount is 765, so 255 per month.

Hmm.

Given that the problem is ambiguous, but in most installment loans, the interest is calculated on the remaining balance, so it's simple interest.

So, let's do that. So, total principal is 750, interest is 2% per year? Or 2% per month?

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the period for the 2% interest. So, maybe it's 2% per year.

Wait, if it's 2% per year, over three months, that's 0.5% per month.

So, simple interest each month would be 0.5% of 750, which is 3.75 per month.

So, total interest over three months would be 3.75 * 3 = 11.25

So, total amount is 750 + 11.25 = 761.25, so monthly payment is 761.25 / 3 = 253.75

Alternatively, if it's 2% per month on the total principal, so 15 per month, total interest 45, total amount 795, monthly payment 265.

But since the problem doesn't specify, it's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the key phrase is "a 2% interest will be charged for each unit." So, "each unit" is each phone. So, that might mean per phone, 2% interest per month.

So, if it's 2% per phone per month, then each phone is 150, so 2% is 3 per month, so each phone is 153 after first month, 156 after second, 159 after third. So, total per month: 5*159 = 795, so 265 per month.

Alternatively, if it's 2% per unit over three months, meaning 2% of the total principal over three months, which is 15, so total amount 765, 255 per month.

So, given that the problem says "for each unit," which is each phone, and the interest is being charged, it's more likely that it's 2% per phone per month.

So, each phone's interest is 2% per month, so each phone's amount after three months is 150*(1 + 0.02)^3 ≈ 159.18, so total amount is 5*159.18 ≈ 795.90, so monthly payment is approximately 265.30.

But since the problem is likely expecting an exact answer, not a decimal, so 795 divided by 3 is 265.

So, maybe the answer is $265 per month.

But I'm still a bit confused because the problem isn't clear. However, given that the interest is per unit, and given the way it's phrased, I think it's per unit per month.

So, the calculation would be:

Each phone: $150, 2% per month interest, so each month, 3 is added.

After three months, each phone is $150 + 3*3 = $159.

Total for five phones: 5*159 = $795.

Monthly payment: 795 / 3 = $265.

Therefore, the answer is $265 per month.

But wait, let me think again. If the interest is 2% per month on each phone, then the calculation is:

First month: 150 + 3 = 153

Second month: 153 + 3 = 156

Third month: 156 + 3 = 159

So, each phone is 159, total is 795, so 265 per month.

Alternatively, if it's 2% per month on the total principal, which is 750, then each month, 15 is added.

So, three months, 45 total, total amount 795, so 265 per month.

So, in either case, 265 is the answer.

Alternatively, if it's 2% per month on each phone, and it's simple interest, so no, in that case, it's still 3 per month, so 9 per phone over three months.

But the problem is, if it's 2% per month on each phone, then the total interest is 5*3*3 = 45, so total amount 795, so 265.

Alternatively, if it's 2% per month on the total principal, then 750 * 0.02 * 3 = 45, same thing. So, 45 interest, 795 total, 265 per month.

So, regardless of whether it's per phone or per total, the total interest is 45, so 795 total, 265 per month.

Wait, that seems to be the case. Because 2% per month on each phone's principal, 2% of 150 per month per phone, over three months, 3 per phone per month, so 9 per phone over three months, 45 total. So, same as 2% per month on the total principal, 750 * 0.02 * 3 = 45.

So, in either case, it's 45 total interest. So, whether it's per phone or per total, the total interest is same.

Therefore, total amount is 750 + 45 = 795, so 265 per month.

Therefore, even though the problem is a bit ambiguous, the correct answer is $265 per month.

So, the final answer is $265 each month.

**Final Answer**
Shiela will pay \boxed{265} dollars each month for 3 months.
</think>

Shiela bought five cell phones at $150 each, totaling $750. A 2% interest will be charged for each unit. 

First, we calculate the total cost without interest:
\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

Next, we consider the interest. The problem states a 2% interest will be charged for each unit. This can be interpreted in two ways: either 2% per unit per month or 2% of the total amount. 

1. **2% per unit per month**:
   - Each phone will accrue 2% interest per month.
   - The interest per phone per month is:
     \[ 150 \times 0.02 = 3 \]
   - Over three months, the interest per phone is:
     \[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \]
   - Total interest for all five phones over three months:
     \[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \]
   - Total amount to be paid:
     \[ 750 + 45 = 795 \]
   - Monthly payment:
     \[ \frac{795}{3} = 265 \]

2. **2% of the total amount**:
   - Total interest for three months:
     \[ 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]
   - Total amount to be paid:
     \[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]
   - Monthly payment:
     \[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

However, considering the problem's phrasing and the ambiguity, the correct interpretation is that the 2% interest is per unit per month. Therefore, the total interest is calculated as follows:

- Each phone's interest over three months:
  \[ 150 \times (1 + 0.02)^3 - 150 \approx 159.18 - 150 = 9.18 \]
- Total interest for all five phones:
  \[ 5 \times 9.18 = 45.90 \]
- Total amount to be paid:
  \[ 750 + 45.90 = 795.90 \]
- Monthly payment:
  \[ \frac{795.90}{3} \approx 265.30 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{265}
\]
