Question:
The book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side. How many pages are in the book, if it is 1.5 inches thick?

Correct Answer:
There are 1.5*100=<<1.5*100=150>>150 pieces of paper.
Then there are 150*2=<<150*2=300>>300 pages.

Wrong Prediction:
150

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here about a book and figuring out how many pages it has. Let me try to break it down step by step because I want to make sure I understand it correctly.

First, the problem says that the paper the book is printed on is 100 pages thick per inch. Hmm, that means if I have a stack of paper that's one inch tall, it has 100 pages in it. But then it also mentions that each sheet of paper is printed on both sides. So, each sheet has two pages, right? One on the front side and one on the back side. That makes sense because when you print on both sides, you get two pages per sheet.

Now, the book is 1.5 inches thick. So, I need to figure out how many pages that translates to, considering that each inch has 100 pages, but each sheet adds two pages. Wait, maybe I need to consider the thickness per page instead of per sheet? Let me think.

If 100 pages make up one inch, then the thickness of each page would be 1 inch divided by 100 pages. Let me write that down:

Thickness per page = 1 inch / 100 pages = 0.01 inches per page.

But hold on, is that correct? Because each sheet is printed on both sides, so each sheet contributes two pages. That means each sheet is 0.01 inches thick because 1 inch is 100 pages, so each sheet is 0.01 inches multiplied by 2? Wait, no, that might be the other way around.

Wait, let me clarify: If 100 pages are 1 inch thick, that means each page is 0.01 inches thick. But since each sheet has two pages, each sheet is 0.02 inches thick? No, that can't be right because 100 pages per inch would mean 100 pages, each 0.01 inches.

But each sheet is two pages, so each sheet is 0.01 inches thick? No, that doesn't make sense because if each sheet has two pages, then each sheet is 0.01 inches thick because 2 pages per sheet and 100 pages per inch. So, 100 pages per inch is 50 sheets per inch, right? Because each sheet has two pages.

So, 100 pages per inch divided by 2 pages per sheet gives 50 sheets per inch. Therefore, the thickness per sheet is 1 inch divided by 50 sheets, which is 0.02 inches per sheet. So each sheet is 0.02 inches thick.

Therefore, if the book is 1.5 inches thick, the number of sheets would be 1.5 inches divided by 0.02 inches per sheet. Let me compute that:

Number of sheets = 1.5 / 0.02 = 75 sheets.

But each sheet has two pages, so the total number of pages is 75 sheets multiplied by 2 pages per sheet, which is 150 pages.

Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, if each sheet is 0.02 inches thick, then 75 sheets would be 75 * 0.02 = 1.5 inches. That matches the thickness of the book. Then, since each sheet has two pages, 75 sheets * 2 pages/sheet = 150 pages. That seems right.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is: 100 pages per inch, so 1.5 inches would have 1.5 * 100 = 150 pages. But wait, hold on, that's only if each sheet is one page... But in this case, each sheet is two pages because it's printed on both sides. So, maybe I need to divide that number by 2?

Wait, if 100 pages per inch is the total number of pages including both sides, then 1.5 inches would have 1.5 * 100 = 150 pages. But since each sheet has two pages, that would mean 150 / 2 = 75 sheets. But then, the thickness would be 75 sheets * (1 inch / 50 sheets) ) = 1.5 inches. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since each sheet is 0.02 inches thick, as I found earlier, then 1.5 inches is 75 sheets. Each sheet is two pages, so 75 * 2 = 150 pages. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, if I think of it as 100 pages per inch, so 1.5 inches is 150 pages, but each page is part of a sheet with another page. So, the number of sheets would be 150 / 2 = 75 sheets, which is 75 * 0.02 inches = 1.5 inches. So both ways, I get 150 pages.

Wait, so does that mean that the total number of pages is 150? Let me think again.

If 100 pages are 1 inch, then 1.5 inches would be 1.5 * 100 = 150 pages. But since each sheet has two pages, is the number of pages 150? Or is it that each sheet has two pages, so 150 pages correspond to 75 sheets, which is 1.5 inches? So, that seems to make sense.

To ensure I haven't messed up, let me think about a smaller number. Suppose the book is 1 inch thick. Then, according to the problem, each inch has 100 pages. But since each sheet is two pages, then 1 inch would have 100 pages, which is 50 sheets. So, 50 sheets * 2 pages per sheet = 100 pages. That checks out.

Similarly, if the book is 2 inches thick, then 2 inches * 100 pages per inch = 200 pages. But that would be 100 sheets, since each sheet is two pages, and 100 sheets * 0.02 inches per sheet = 2 inches. Perfect, that makes sense.

Therefore, scaling up to 1.5 inches, it's 1.5 * 100 = 150 pages. So, I think that's the correct answer.

Just to recap: The book is 1.5 inches thick. Each inch of the book's thickness corresponds to 100 pages. However, since each sheet of paper has two pages, the total number of pages is 1.5 * 100 = 150 pages.

Alternatively, calculating the number of sheets first: 1.5 inches divided by the thickness per sheet (which is 0.02 inches) gives 75 sheets. Each sheet has two pages, so 75 * 2 = 150 pages. Either way, getting to 150 pages.

I think that's solid. So, the book has 150 pages in total.

**Final Answer**
The book has \boxed{150} pages.
</think>

The book is printed on paper that is 100 pages thick per inch, with each sheet printed on both sides. The book is 1.5 inches thick.

1. Each inch of thickness corresponds to 100 pages.
2. Since each sheet is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes two pages.
3. Therefore, 1.5 inches of thickness corresponds to \(1.5 \times 100 = 150\) pages.

Thus, the total number of pages in the book is \(\boxed{150}\).
