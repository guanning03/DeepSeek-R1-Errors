Question:
Dolly has two books. Pandora has one. If both Dolly and Pandora read each others' books as well as their own, how many books will they collectively read by the end?

Correct Answer:
There are 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 books in total.
Dolly and Pandora both read all 3 books, so 3 books/person x 2 people = <<3*2=6>>6 books total
#### 6

Gold:
6

Wrong Prediction:
3

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this problem here: Dolly has two books, and Pandora has one. Both of them read each other's books as well as their own. The question is, how many books will they collectively read by the end? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are two people, Dolly and Pandora. Dolly has two books, let's say Book 1 and Book 2. Pandora has one book, Book 3. Now, both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own. So that means Dolly will read her own two books and also read both of Pandora's books. Wait, but hold on, does she read all of Pandora's books? Since she has two books, she reads each of them. So, Dolly's reading list would be: her own two books and both of Pandora's one book? Wait, no, hold on, if she has two books, and she's going to read each of them, that's two books. Then, she's going to read each of Pandora's books, and she has one, so that's one more. So Dolly reads a total of three books: her two plus one from Pandora.

Similarly, Pandora has one book, and she's going to read each of her own books, which is just one. She also needs to read each of Dolly's books. Dolly has two books, so that's two more. So, Pandora will read her own one plus Dolly's two, totaling three books as well.

Wait a minute, so Dolly reads three books, and Pandora reads three books. So together, how many books do they read in total? Hmm, but I have to be careful here. Because when Dolly reads Puzzle's books, those are the same books that Pandora is going to read. So, is the total number of books they read just the sum of the unique books they read?

Wait no, that can't be. Because if Dolly reads both of her own books, and both of Pandora's books, and Pandora reads her own book and both of Dolly's books, then the books they read are overlapping. So, we have to consider that some books are being read by both of them.

So, perhaps the total number of books they collectively read is the union of the books Dolly reads and the books Pandora reads. So, let me list out the books:

- Dolly reads: Book 1, Book 2, Book 3.
- Pandora reads: Book 3, Book 1, Book 2.

So, altogether, they read Books 1, 2, and 3. So, the total number of books they collectively read is three.

But wait, is that the case? Let me think again. Dolly has two books, Book 1 and Book 2, and Pandora has one, Book 3. So, in total, there are three books. Both Dolly and Pandora will read each of these three books. So, the collective reading is three books, but each book is read by both of them.

But the question is asking how many books will they collectively read by the end. So, is it asking for the number of unique books they have read in total, or the total number of readings?

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again: "If both Dolly and Pandora read each others' books as well as their own, how many books will they collectively read by the end?"

So, it says collectively read. Hmm, "collectively read" could mean the total number of unique books that either Dolly or Pandora has read. Because if you think about it, each book is read by both, so the unique books are three. But if it's asking for how many books they read in total, considering both their own and the other's, then it's still three, because they both end up reading the same three books. Wait, but Dolly has two, and Pandora has one, so the books are already three. So, regardless of who reads which, they collectively have three books.

Alternatively, if we think about how many times they read books, Dolly reads three books, each once, and Pandora reads three books, each once. So, total number of readings would be six, but the question is about how many books they collectively read by the end. So, the key word here is "books," so it's about the quantity of unique books, not the number of readings.

So, each of the three books is read by both of them. So, the total number of unique books they've collectively read is three.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that Dolly has two books and Pandora has one, so in total, they have three books. But since they read each other's books, does that mean that they read all three books? Yes, because Dolly reads her own two and Pandora's one, and Pandora reads her own one and Dolly's two. So, in total, they read all three books.

Therefore, the number of books they collectively read by the end is three.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is there a possibility that they might read the same book multiple times? Like, does reading a book count multiple times if both people read it? But the question is asking how many books they collectively read, not how many times they read books. So, if they both read the same book, it's still just one book. So, the count is three.

Therefore, I think the answer is three.

But let me think again. If Dolly has two books, and she reads each of her own books and each of Pandora's books, so she reads two plus one, which is three. Similarly, Pandora has one book, and she reads her own and Dolly's two, so she reads three. But together, how many books have they read? It's three books in total, because they both end up reading all three books. So, the answer is three.

Alternatively, if it were asking how many books each of them reads individually, it would be three for each, but since it's asking collectively, it's three.

Wait, but maybe I should think in another way. If Dolly reads her two books and one from Pandora, that's three. Pandora reads her one and Dolly's two, that's three. So, total number of books read by both is six, but the unique books are three.

But the question says, "how many books will they collectively read by the end." So, I think it's the unique books, so three. So, I think the answer is three.

But just to make sure, let me think of it as a Venn diagram. The books Dolly reads are {Book1, Book2, Book3}, and the books Pandora reads are {Book1, Book2, Book3}. So, the union is {Book1, Book2, Book3}, which has three elements. Therefore, the number of books they collectively read is three.

Yes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is three.

**Final Answer**
The number of books they collectively read by the end is \boxed{3}.
</think>

Dolly has two books, Book 1 and Book 2, while Pandora has one book, Book 3. Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own.

- Dolly reads her own two books (Book 1 and Book 2) and reads both of Pandora's books (Book 3). Therefore, Dolly reads three books in total.
- Pandora reads her own one book (Book 3) and reads both of Dolly's books (Book 1 and Book 2). Therefore, Pandora reads three books in total.

The unique books they collectively read are Book 1, Book 2, and Book 3. Thus, the number of unique books they collectively read is three.

\[
\boxed{3}
