Question:
Ben bought a car for $20000 in 2007. The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. Find the price of the car in the year 2010.

Correct Answer:
The price of the car depreciates of 20000 * 21% = $<<20000*21*.01=4200>>4200 per year.
Ben had the car for 2010 - 2007 = <<2010-2007=3>>3 years.
The price of the car depreciates 4200 * 3 = $<<4200*3=12600>>12600 from 2007 to 2010.
So the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007, and the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. I need to find out how much the car will be worth in 2010. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, depreciation means the car loses value over time. The rate is 21% per year, which is pretty significant. So each year, the car's value decreases by 21% of its current value. I remember that depreciation can be modeled using exponential decay. The formula for depreciation is usually:

\[ \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{rate})^{\text{time}} \]

In this case, the initial value is $20,000, the rate is 21% or 0.21, and the time is from 2007 to 2010. Let me calculate how many years that is. From 2007 to 2008 is 1 year, 2008 to 2009 is another year, and 2009 to 2010 is the third year. So that's 3 years total.

So plugging the numbers into the formula, it should be:

\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]

Let me compute that step by step. First, calculate \(1 - 0.21\). That's 0.79. So each year, the car is worth 79% of its value from the previous year.

Now, I need to calculate \(0.79\) raised to the power of 3. Let me do that. 

First, \(0.79 \times 0.79\). Let me compute that:

0.79 times 0.79. 0.7 times 0.7 is 0.49, 0.7 times 0.09 is 0.063, 0.09 times 0.7 is 0.063, and 0.09 times 0.09 is 0.0081. Wait, that might not be the quickest way. Maybe just multiply 79 times 79 and then adjust for the decimals.

79 times 79:

79
times 79
--------
79*9 = 711
79*70 = 5530
Total: 5530 + 711 = 6241

But since both numbers are multiplied by 0.01, so 0.79 * 0.79 = 0.6241.

Okay, so that's 0.6241. Now, we need to multiply this result by another 0.79 for the third year.

So, 0.6241 * 0.79. Let me compute that.

First, 0.6 * 0.79 is 0.474. Then, 0.0241 * 0.79. Hmm, 0.02 * 0.79 is 0.0158, and 0.0041 * 0.79 is approximately 0.003239. So adding those together: 0.0158 + 0.003239 ≈ 0.019039.

So, adding that to the 0.474, we get approximately 0.474 + 0.019039 ≈ 0.493039.

So, \(0.79^3 ≈ 0.493039\).

Therefore, the final value is:

20,000 * 0.493039 ≈ ?

Let me calculate 20,000 * 0.493039.

First, 20,000 * 0.4 = 8,000.

20,000 * 0.09 = 1,800.

20,000 * 0.003039 = 20,000 * 0.003 = 60, and 20,000 * 0.000039 ≈ 0.78.

So adding those together: 8,000 + 1,800 = 9,800, plus 60 is 9,860, plus 0.78 is approximately 9,860.78.

Wait, but I think I might have messed up the breakdown. Maybe it's better to multiply 20,000 by 0.493039 directly.

20,000 * 0.493039:

20,000 * 0.4 = 8,000.

20,000 * 0.09 = 1,800.

20,000 * 0.003039 = 20,000 * 0.003 = 60, and 20,000 * 0.000039 = 0.78.

So adding 8,000 + 1,800 is 9,800. Then 9,800 + 60 is 9,860, and 9,860 + 0.78 is approximately 9,860.78.

So, approximately $9,860.78.

Wait, let me verify that. Alternatively, 20,000 * 0.493039 is the same as 20,000 * (0.4 + 0.09 + 0.003 + 0.000039). But another way is to compute 20,000 * 0.493039.

Let me compute 20,000 * 0.493039.

First, 20,000 * 0.4 = 8,000.

20,000 * 0.09 = 1,800.

20,000 * 0.003 = 60.

20,000 * 0.000039 = 0.78.

So adding all these together: 8,000 + 1,800 = 9,800; 9,800 + 60 = 9,860; 9,860 + 0.78 = 9,860.78.

Yes, that seems consistent.

So, according to this, the car's value in 2010 would be approximately $9,860.78.

But wait, let me check my exponent calculation again. I computed \(0.79^3\) as approximately 0.493039. Let me verify that.

0.79 * 0.79 = 0.6241, that's correct. Then, 0.6241 * 0.79.

Let me compute 0.6241 * 0.79:

0.6241 * 0.7 = 0.43687

0.6241 * 0.09 = 0.056169

Adding them together: 0.43687 + 0.056169 = 0.493039. Yes, that's correct.

So, the multiplication is correct.

Alternatively, I can compute 0.79^3 using a calculator step:

First, 0.79^2 = 0.6241.

Then, 0.6241 * 0.79:

Multiplying 0.6241 * 0.79:

Let me write it as 6241 * 79 and then adjust for decimal places.

6241 * 79:

6241 * 70 = 436,870

6241 * 9 = 56,169

Adding them: 436,870 + 56,169 = 493,039

So, 0.6241 * 0.79 = 0.493039.

Therefore, that is correct.

So, final value is 20,000 * 0.493039 ≈ $9,860.78.

Alternatively, we can round it to the nearest cent, which would be $9,860.78.

Wait, but let me see if there's another way to compute this. Maybe using logarithms or something else, but I think the straightforward way is correct.

Alternatively, let's compute each year's depreciation step by step.

Starting with $20,000 in 2007.

First year (2008): 20,000 - (21% of 20,000) = 20,000 - 4,200 = 15,800.

Second year (2009): 15,800 - (21% of 15,800). Let's compute 21% of 15,800: 0.21 * 15,800.

Calculating 0.2 * 15,800 = 3,160, and 0.01 * 15,800 = 158. So total is 3,160 + 158 = 3,318.

So, 15,800 - 3,318 = 12,482.

Third year (2010): 12,482 - (21% of 12,482). Let's compute 21% of 12,482.

0.2 * 12,482 = 2,496.4

0.01 * 12,482 = 124.82

Adding those: 2,496.4 + 124.82 = 2,621.22

So, subtracting that from 12,482: 12,482 - 2,621.22 = 9,860.78.

Hmm, same result. So, that's consistent.

So, both methods give me $9,860.78.

Therefore, the value of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,860.78.

But, let me think again: Is this a simple depreciation or is there another way to calculate it? For example, sometimes depreciation can be calculated using different methods, like straight-line, but in this case, it's specified as constant rate, which is exponential depreciation, not straight-line.

Straight-line depreciation would subtract the same amount each year, but since it's a constant rate, it's exponential.

So, yes, the formula I used earlier is correct.

Alternatively, if I wanted to use the exponential decay formula correctly, starting from 2007, which is the base year.

So, the formula is:

Final Value = Initial Value × (1 - rate)^t

Where t is the number of years.

So, t = 3, rate = 21% = 0.21.

Final Value = 20,000 × (1 - 0.21)^3 = 20,000 × (0.79)^3 ≈ 20,000 × 0.493039 ≈ 9,860.78.

So, same result.

So, I think that's solid.

Alternatively, just to make sure, if I compute 0.79^3 using a calculator, I can get the exact number.

0.79 * 0.79 = 0.6241, then 0.6241 * 0.79.

I can compute 0.6241 * 0.79:

0.6241 * 0.7 = 0.43687

0.6241 * 0.09 = 0.056169

Adding them: 0.43687 + 0.056169 = 0.493039.

Yes, that's accurate.

So, 20,000 * 0.493039 is indeed 9,860.78.

Therefore, the car's value in 2010 is $9,860.78.

But, just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again.

Starting with 20,000.

After first year: 20,000 - (0.21 * 20,000) = 20,000 - 4,200 = 15,800.

After second year: 15,800 - (0.21 * 15,800) = 15,800 - 3,318 = 12,482.

After third year: 12,482 - (0.21 * 12,482) = 12,482 - 2,621.22 = 9,860.78.

Yes, same result.

Alternatively, I can compute the depreciation factor for each year.

Year 1: 20,000 * 0.79 = 15,800.

Year 2: 15,800 * 0.79 = 12,482.

Year 3: 12,482 * 0.79 = 9,860.78.

Exactly, so that's consistent.

Therefore, I'm confident that the value after 3 years is $9,860.78.

But, just to ensure, let me consider the formula again:

Final Value = P(1 - r)^t

Where P is principal (initial value), r is rate, t is time.

So, plugging in the numbers:

Final Value = 20,000(1 - 0.21)^3 = 20,000(0.79)^3 ≈ 20,000 * 0.493039 ≈ 9,860.78.

Yes, again, same answer.

So, unless I made a calculation error in multiplication, but I've cross-verified it multiple ways.

Alternatively, thinking about the problem differently, suppose I use logarithms to compute (0.79)^3.

But that seems unnecessary since we can compute it directly.

Alternatively, using natural logarithms:

ln(0.79) ≈ -0.23107

Multiply by 3: -0.23107 * 3 ≈ -0.69321

Exponentiate: e^(-0.69321) ≈ 0.5.

Wait, but 0.79^3 is 0.493039, which is approximately 0.5, but slightly less.

Wait, e^(-0.6931) ≈ 0.5, because ln(2) ≈ 0.6931. So, e^(-0.6931) ≈ 0.5.

But 0.79^3 is approximately 0.493, which is close to 0.5, but a bit less. So, that makes sense.

But that's just another way to approximate it.

Therefore, the exact calculation is 0.493039, leading to the final value of approximately $9,860.78.

So, unless I made a mistake in the initial multiplication, which I don't think I did, that's the correct value.

Wait, just to check 0.79 * 0.79 again:

0.79 * 0.79:

0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49

0.7 * 0.09 = 0.063

0.09 * 0.7 = 0.063

0.09 * 0.09 = 0.0081

So, adding them up: 0.49 + 0.063 + 0.063 + 0.0081 = 0.49 + 0.126 + 0.0081 = 0.616 + 0.0081 = 0.6241. Yes, that's correct.

So, 0.79^2 = 0.6241.

Then, 0.6241 * 0.79:

Again, breaking it down:

0.6 * 0.79 = 0.474

0.0241 * 0.79:

Compute 0.02 * 0.79 = 0.0158

0.0041 * 0.79 ≈ 0.003239

So, adding 0.0158 + 0.003239 ≈ 0.019039

Adding to 0.474: 0.474 + 0.019039 ≈ 0.493039.

Yes, so 0.79^3 ≈ 0.493039.

Therefore, 20,000 * 0.493039 is indeed approximately $9,860.78.

Alternatively, if I compute 20,000 * 0.493039:

20,000 * 0.4 = 8,000

20,000 * 0.09 = 1,800

20,000 * 0.003039 = 20,000 * 0.003 = 60, and 20,000 * 0.000039 = 0.78

So, adding 8,000 + 1,800 + 60 + 0.78 = 9,860.78.

Yes, consistent.

Therefore, I can conclude that the car's value in 2010 is approximately $9,860.78.

But, let me think about whether the depreciation is per annum or something else. The problem says it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. So, that's an annual rate, which is what I've been using.

So, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, sometimes depreciation can be calculated as a multiple of the original value each year, but in this case, since it's a constant percentage, it's definitely exponential.

So, I think I've covered all the bases here. I've cross-verified using different methods, both step-by-step annual depreciation and the exponential formula, and both give me the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.

**Final Answer**
The price of the car in 2010 is \boxed{9860.78}.
</think>

Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. To find the price of the car in 2010, we use the exponential decay formula:

\[ \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{rate})^{\text{time}} \]

The initial value is $20,000, the rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the time is 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

First, calculate the depreciation factor:

\[ 1 - 0.21 = 0.79 \]

Next, raise this factor to the power of 3:

\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.493039 \]

Then, multiply this result by the initial value:

\[ 20000 \times 0.493039 \approx 9860.78 \]

Thus, the price of the car in 2010 is:

\[
\boxed{9860.78}
\]
