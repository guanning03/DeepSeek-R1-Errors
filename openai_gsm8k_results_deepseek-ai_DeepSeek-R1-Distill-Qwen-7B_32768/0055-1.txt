Question:
Carolyn works for a delivery service company that hires on a contract basis. In May, they hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.

Correct Answer:
When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000

Wrong Answer:
Okay, let's see. Carolyn works for a delivery service company that hires people on a contract basis. So, they don't have permanent employees; they hire them for specific contracts. In May, they hired 40 employees. Each of these employees was paid $15 per hour, and they worked a 40-hour workweek. 

First, I need to figure out how much the company paid in total for May. Since each employee was paid $15 per hour, and they worked 40 hours a week, I can calculate the weekly wage per employee. 

So, $15 per hour times 40 hours. Let me write that down: 15 * 40. Hmm, 15 times 40 is 600. So, each employee earned $600 per week. 

Now, in May, they hired 40 employees. So, to find the total payment for May, I need to multiply the weekly wage by the number of employees. That would be $600 multiplied by 40. Let me compute that: 600 * 40. Hmm, 600 times 40. Well, 6 times 4 is 24, and since there are two zeros in 600 and one zero in 40, that's three zeros. So, 24 followed by three zeros is 24,000. So, $24,000 in total for May.

Moving on to June. The problem states that 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June. Hmm, so 1/4 of the 40 employees had their contracts ending. Let me figure out how many that is. 1/4 of 40 is 10. Because 40 divided by 4 is 10. So, 10 employees had their contracts expire in June.

Now, I need to calculate how much the company paid for these 10 employees in June. The same terms apply; each was paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, just like in May, each employee earned $600 per week. Therefore, 10 employees would have been paid 10 * $600, which is $6,000 in total for June.

Wait a second, hold on. Is that all? Or do I need to consider if the 10 employees worked the same 40-hour week in June as in May? I think the problem is assuming that the contracts were for a specific number of hours, so maybe the same rate applies. But actually, since it's about the total payment, regardless of how many hours they worked, it's just the number of employees multiplied by their weekly rate.

But wait, no. Wait, in the problem statement, it just says they hired 40 employees in May, each paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, does that mean that in June, only 10 employees are still employed? Or are they still being paid for the same 40 hours?

Hmm, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: "In May, they hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months."

So, in May, they hired 40 employees and paid them each $15/hour for 40 hours. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 10 employees had their contracts end. I think that means that in June, these 10 employees were no longer employed, so the company didn't have to pay them. Wait, but the question is asking for the total amount paid in the two months. So, if they hired 40 in May, and 10 of their contracts expired in June, does that mean the company didn't hire those 10 again? Or did they hire them again?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me parse the problem again.

They hired 40 employees in May, each paid $15/hour for a 40-hour week. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, 1/4 of 40 is 10, so 10 contracts expired. So, does that mean that 10 employees were let go, and the company didn't hire them again? Or did they rehire them?

The problem doesn't specify whether the 1/4 expired and the company continued to hire them or not. Hmm. It just says "1/4 of the employees' contracts expired." So, that might mean that 10 employees were no longer employed, so the company didn't have to pay them in June. But wait, but the question is about the total paid in the two months. So, in May, they paid for 40 employees, in June, they paid for the remaining 30? Or did they have a different number?

Wait, I think I need to clarify.

In May, they have 40 employees, each paid $600. So total payment is 40 * 600 = $24,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees had contracts that expired. So, 10 employees. Does that mean they had 30 employees remaining, so they continued to pay those 30 in June? Or did they let go of 10, so only 30 were paid?

Wait, the problem says "1/4 of the employees' contracts expired." So, perhaps 10 employees had their contracts ending, so their payments would stop. Therefore, in June, the company didn't have to hire or pay those 10. So, they only paid the other 30.

But wait, the problem is asking for the total amount paid in the two months. So, in May, they paid 40 employees for May. In June, they paid 30 employees for June. So, total payment is May's 24,000 plus June's 30 * 600.

Wait, 30 * 600 is 18,000. So, 24,000 + 18,000 is 42,000. So, total is $42,000.

But hold on, another interpretation: Maybe in June, the 10 employees were still on contracts, so they were paid in June as well. So, the company hired 40 in May, and in June, 10 of them were still employed, so they were paid in June as well. So, total would be 40 * 600 for May, and 10 * 600 for June, which is 24,000 + 6,000 = 30,000.

But which interpretation is correct? The problem says "1/4 of the employees' contracts expired." So, 1/4 of 40 is 10. So, 10 contracts expired, meaning 10 employees were no longer employed. So, in June, those 10 weren't paid, but the remaining 30 were still employed and paid. So, total payment is 40*600 + 30*600 = 70*600 = 42,000.

Alternatively, if the 10 employees were still hired in June, but their contracts were expiring, that might mean they were being let go. But in that case, the company wouldn't have to pay them anymore. So, they were paid in May, but not in June. So, total payment is 40*600 for May, and 0 for June, but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for the total amount paid in two months.

Wait, no, if 10 contracts expired, meaning 10 employees were no longer employed, but the company is still paying the rest. It doesn't specify whether they rehire those 10 or not. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "1/4 of the employees' contracts expired." So, it's about the contracts expiring, not necessarily about rehiring. So, in June, 10 contracts expired, so 10 employees were let go, meaning the company didn't have to pay them in June. But in May, they had already paid them in May. So, the company's total payment in two months would be May's 40*600 plus June's 30*600, which is 24,000 + 18,000 = 42,000.

Alternatively, if they rehired the 10 in June, then they would have paid 40*600 in May and 40*600 in June, totaling 48,000.

But since the problem doesn't specify whether the 10 were rehired or not, but just that their contracts expired, which might mean they were no longer employed, so the company didn't have to pay them in June. So, I think the correct interpretation is that in June, only 30 employees were paid, so total payment is 24,000 + 18,000 = 42,000.

Wait, but let me think again. If their contracts expired, does that mean they're no longer employed, so they were only paid once in May, and then in June, they weren't paid anymore. So, total payment is just 24,000. But that seems contradictory because the problem is asking for two months.

So, perhaps the 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June, so they were no longer employed starting June, so in June, only the remaining 30 were paid. So, total payment is May's 24,000 plus June's 30*600=18,000, totaling 42,000. That seems more plausible.

Alternatively, if the 10 employees were rehired in June, so they were still paid in June, so total payment is 40*600 + 40*600=48,000.

But the problem is ambiguous on whether the 10 were rehired or not. Hmm.

Wait, let's re-examine the problem.

"Carolyn works for a delivery service company that hires on a contract basis. In May, they hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months."

So, in May: hired 40, paid each $15/hour, 40 hours, so 600 each, total 24,000.

In June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, 1/4 of 40 is 10. So, 10 contracts expired. So, in June, the company paid for the remaining 30 employees. So, each employee was paid 600 in June, so 30*600=18,000.

Therefore, total payment is 24,000 + 18,000=42,000.

Alternatively, if the 10 were rehired, but the problem didn't mention any rehiring. It just said that 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, I think it's safe to assume that the company didn't hire those 10 again in June, so only the remaining 30 were paid.

Therefore, the total amount paid in two months is $42,000.

Wait, but let me check if the problem is saying that in June, "1/4 of the employees' contracts expired," so maybe it's 1/4 of the total employees at the company, not just the ones hired in May. But wait, the company hired 40 in May, and didn't mention hiring more in June, so the total employees would still be 40, right? Because if they hired 40 in May and didn't hire more, then in June, 1/4 of 40 would be 10. So, 10 of the 40 employees had their contracts expire.

So, in May, all 40 were paid, in June, 30 remained and were paid. So, total payment is 40+30=70 employees, each paid $600, so 70*600=42,000.

Alternatively, if in June, the 10 were still on contracts, then the company would have paid 40 in May and 40 in June, totaling 80*600=48,000. But since the contracts expired, it's more logical that the company wouldn't have to pay them in June.

So, to sum up, I think the total payment is 42,000.

But just to make sure, let's think of another angle. Maybe the 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, meaning 10 contracts, but each contract might have a certain duration. So, perhaps each contract was for a certain number of months, and in June, 1/4 of them expired, meaning they weren't paid for the rest of the contract period. But the problem doesn't specify the contract duration, just that they were paid $15/hour for a 40-hour workweek.

Wait, the problem says "paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek." So, perhaps each contract was for a 40-hour week, meaning each month they work 40 hours, and the payment is per week. So, in May, they worked 40 hours, paid $600. In June, 1/4 of the contracts expired, so those 10 employees were no longer working, so the company didn't have to pay them in June. So, total payment is May's 24,000 plus June's 30*600=18,000, totaling 42,000.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, if the contracts were for a certain number of weeks, but the problem doesn't specify that. So, I think we can safely assume that each employee was paid $600 per month, and in June, 10 employees didn't work, so their payment was cut short.

Therefore, total payment is $24,000 in May and $18,000 in June, so $42,000 in total.

So, I think the final answer is $42,000.

**Final Answer**
The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \boxed{42000}.
</think>

In May, Carolyn's company hired 40 employees, each paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The weekly wage for each employee is calculated as follows:

\[
15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours} = 600 \, \text{dollars/week}
\]

The total payment for May is:

\[
40 \, \text{employees} \times 600 \, \text{dollars/week} = 24,000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Since there were 40 employees hired in May, 1/4 of 40 is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \, \text{employees}
\]

These 10 employees were no longer employed in June, so the company only paid the remaining 30 employees. The total payment for June is:

\[
30 \, \text{employees} \times 600 \, \text{dollars/week} = 18,000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Adding the payments for May and June gives the total amount paid in the two months:

\[
24,000 \, \text{dollars} + 18,000 \, \text{dollars} = 42,000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \boxed{42000}.
