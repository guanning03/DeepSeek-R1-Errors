Question:
Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed to have monthly interest of 2%. If Mandy was able to pay it after 3 months, how much should she give to Benedict?

Correct Answer:
The monthly interest is $100 x 2/100 = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.
After 3 months, the total interest amount to $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.
Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict a total of $100 + $6 = $<<100+6=106>>106.
#### 106

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they have an agreement where there's a monthly interest rate of 2%. Mandy is paying after 3 months, and I need to figure out how much she should give to Benedict. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that interest is calculated based on the principal amount, which in this case is $100. The interest rate is 2% per month. Since Mandy is paying after 3 months, the interest will compound each month. So, I guess I need to calculate the amount owed after each month and then sum it up.

Let me recall the formula for compound interest. It's A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), but wait, in this case, since it's monthly interest and compounded monthly, it might be simpler. Is it just A = P(1 + r)^t? Where P is principal, r is the monthly interest rate, and t is the number of months.

Let me confirm: since the interest is compounded monthly, each month's interest is calculated on the current principal, which includes the previous month's interest. So yes, that formula should work.

So, plugging in the numbers: P is $100, r is 2%, which is 0.02, and t is 3 months.

Therefore, the amount after 3 months would be A = 100*(1 + 0.02)^3.

Calculating that: first, 1 + 0.02 is 1.02. Then, 1.02 raised to the power of 3. Let me compute that step by step.

1.02^1 is 1.02.

1.02^2 is 1.02 * 1.02. Let me do that multiplication: 1 * 1 is 1, 1 * 0.02 is 0.02, 0.02 * 1 is 0.02, and 0.02 * 0.02 is 0.0004. Adding those up: 1 + 0.02 + 0.02 + 0.0004 = 1.0404.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me actually multiply 1.02 by 1.02 properly. 

1.02 * 1.02: 

First, multiply 1 * 1.02 = 1.02.

Then, multiply 0.02 * 1.02 = 0.0204.

Add them together: 1.02 + 0.0204 = 1.0404. So, yes, 1.02 squared is 1.0404.

Now, 1.02 cubed is 1.0404 * 1.02. Let me calculate that.

1.0404 * 1.02: 

First, multiply 1 * 1.0404 = 1.0404.

Then, multiply 0.02 * 1.0404 = 0.020808.

Add them together: 1.0404 + 0.020808.

Calculating that: 1.0404 + 0.020808. Let's add the decimals: 0.0404 + 0.020808 is 0.061208, so the total is 1.061208.

So, 1.02^3 is approximately 1.061208.

Therefore, the amount A is 100 * 1.061208 = $106.1208.

Since we're dealing with money, we usually round to the nearest cent. So, $106.1208 would round to $106.12.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with interest, people might use different methods, like simple interest instead of compound interest. But the question says they agreed to have monthly interest of 2%, so I think that's referring to compound interest each month.

But just to be thorough, what would it be if it was simple interest?

Simple interest is calculated as P * r * t. So, 100 * 0.02 * 3 = 6. So, total amount would be 106.

But since it's compounded monthly, the amount would be a bit higher, right? Which is what I calculated as $106.12.

So, yes, it seems like it's compounded monthly, so the amount is $106.12.

Alternatively, I can calculate the interest each month and add it up step by step to verify.

Starting principal: $100.

After first month: 100 + (100 * 0.02) = 100 + 2 = $102.

After second month: 102 + (102 * 0.02). Let's calculate that: 102 * 0.02 is 2.04. So, 102 + 2.04 = $104.04.

After third month: 104.04 + (104.04 * 0.02). Calculating 104.04 * 0.02: 2.0808. So, 104.04 + 2.0808 = $106.1208, which is the same as before.

So, rounding to the nearest cent, that's $106.12.

Therefore, Mandy should pay Benedict $106.12 after 3 months.

But hold on, let me make sure that when they say "monthly interest of 2%", it's not referring to the annual rate, but rather the monthly rate. The question says "monthly interest of 2%", so I think that's the monthly rate. So, each month, it's 2% of the current amount.

So, in that case, my calculation is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes in financial contexts, interest rates can be annual rates, but since it's specified as monthly, it's 2% per month.

Therefore, I think $106.12 is the correct amount.

Wait, but just to cross-verify, what if it's a simple interest of 2% per annum, compounded monthly? Hmm, that's a different scenario.

But the question says "monthly interest of 2%", so I think it's 2% each month, so compounding each month.

So, yeah, the amount after 3 months is $106.12.

Hence, Mandy should pay $106.12.

Alternatively, in some cases, interest could be calculated on the original principal each month, but that would be simple interest, but given that it's 2% per month, I think it's compounded.

But just to be absolutely sure, let me think again.

If it's simple interest, each month she would pay 2% of $100, which is $2, so over three months, she would pay $6, so total amount is $106.

But if it's compound interest, each month she pays 2% of the current balance, so after first month, it's $102, then $104.04, then $106.12.

So, if it's compound interest, it's $106.12, if it's simple, it's $106.

But the question says they agreed to have monthly interest of 2%. So that makes me think that each month, the interest is 2% of the current amount, which is compound interest. So, the amount owed increases each month.

Therefore, the amount owed after 3 months is $106.12.

So, Mandy should pay $106.12.

Alternatively, if I think about the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

Where P is principal, r is rate, n is number of periods.

So, plugging in:

A = 100*(1 + 0.02)^3 = 100*(1.02)^3

We can calculate 1.02^3 as 1.061208, so A = 106.1208, which is approximately $106.12.

Alternatively, if it's simple interest, it's different, but since it's specified as monthly, it's definitely compound.

So, Mandy should pay $106.12.

Just to make sure, let me compute 1.02^3 step by step.

1.02^1 = 1.02

1.02^2 = 1.02 * 1.02 = 1.0404

1.02^3 = 1.0404 * 1.02.

Calculating 1.0404 * 1.02:

First, 1 * 1.0404 = 1.0404

Then, 0.02 * 1.0404 = 0.020808

Adding them together: 1.0404 + 0.020808 = 1.061208

So, yes, that's correct.

So, 100 * 1.061208 = 106.1208, which is approximately $106.12.

Therefore, I'm confident that Mandy should pay $106.12 after 3 months.

**Final Answer**
Mandy should give Benedict \boxed{106.12} dollars.
</think>

Mandy owes Benedict $100 with a monthly interest rate of 2%. To find out how much she should pay after 3 months, we use the compound interest formula:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^t \]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount ($100),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (2% or 0.02),
- \( t \) is the number of months (3).

First, we calculate the compound interest factor:

\[ (1 + 0.02)^3 \]

Breaking it down step by step:
- \( 1 + 0.02 = 1.02 \)
- \( 1.02^2 = 1.0404 \)
- \( 1.02^3 = 1.0404 \times 1.02 = 1.061208 \)

Then, we calculate the amount owed:

\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should pay is:

\[
\boxed{106.12}
\]
