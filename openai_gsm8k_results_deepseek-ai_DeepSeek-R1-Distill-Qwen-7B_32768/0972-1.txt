Question:
Greta’s paycheck is $2400.00. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account. She then uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment. After funding her retirement and paying for her car, how much money does she have left to spend?

Correct Answer:
Her paycheck is $2400.00 and she puts 50% into her retirement so that’s 2400*.50 = $<<2400*.50=1200.00>>1200.00
Her paycheck is $2400.00 and she puts $1200 into retirement so that leaves 2400-1200 = $<<2400-1200=1200.00>>1200.00
Her car payment is 20% of 2400 so her car payment is .20*2400 = $<<20*.01*2400=480.00>>480.00
She had $1200 left and she uses $480.00 to make her car payment which leaves her with 1200-480 = $<<1200-480=720.00>>720.00 remaining for spending

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Greta has a paycheck of $2400.00. I need to figure out how much she has left after putting money into her retirement account and making her car payment. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, she puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account. Okay, so 50% of $2400. I remember that to find a percentage of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So 50% is the same as 0.5. Let me calculate that: 0.5 times $2400. Hmm, 0.5 times 2400 is... 1200. So she's putting $1200 into her retirement account. That makes sense because half of 2400 is 1200.

Now, after funding her retirement, she has the remaining amount left. So, I should subtract the retirement contribution from her total paycheck. Let me do that: $2400 minus $1200 equals $1200. So, she has $1200 left after her retirement contribution.

Next, she uses 20% of her original paycheck for her monthly car payment. Wait, is it 20% of the original $2400 or 20% of the remaining $1200? Hmm, the problem says she uses 20% of her paycheck, so I think it's 20% of the original amount, which is $2400. Wait, but she already took out $1200 for retirement. So does she take 20% from the original or the remaining? Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, let me read the question again: "She then uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment." The word "her paycheck" might refer to the original amount. So maybe it's 20% of the original $2400. Let me check that.

20% of $2400 is calculated as 0.2 times 2400, which is 480. So, she uses $480 for her car payment. Alternatively, if it's 20% of the remaining amount after retirement, which is $1200, that would be 0.2 times 1200, which is 240. Hmm, so which one is correct?

I think the key here is that she uses 20% of her paycheck, not 20% of what's left after retirement. So, her car payment is 20% of the original $2400, which is $480. So, she spends another $480 on her car payment.

Wait, but if she already took out $1200 for retirement, is the car payment taken from the original or the remaining? Hmm, typically, when they say "uses X% of her paycheck," they mean of her current paycheck. So, after she's already put money into her retirement, her remaining is $1200. So, is the car payment taken from that $1200? Hmm, that makes sense too because she's using part of her paycheck for two purposes: retirement and car payment.

So, perhaps I need to calculate both deductions and subtract both from the original amount.

Let me try that.

First, retirement: 50% of $2400 is $1200.

Then, car payment: 20% of $2400 is $480.

So, total deductions are $1200 + $480 = $1680.

Subtracting that from her original paycheck: $2400 - $1680 = $720.

So, she has $720 left to spend.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but I should make sure.

Alternatively, maybe she uses 20% of her remaining money after retirement. So, after retirement, she has $1200. Then, she uses 20% of that remaining $1200 for her car payment.

So, 20% of $1200 is $240. So, subtracting that from $1200, she'd have $960 left.

Wait, so now I have two different answers depending on how I interpret whether the car payment is taken from the original or the remaining.

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous: "She then uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment." The word "her paycheck" could be interpreted as her original, but it might mean her current paycheck, which is after the retirement contribution.

I think the key here is that she first puts 50% into retirement, so her remaining is 50%, and then from that remaining, she uses 20% for the car payment.

So, first, 50% of $2400 is $1200 to retirement, leaving $1200. Then, 20% of $1200 is $240 for the car payment, leaving her with $960.

Alternatively, if the car payment is 20% of the original, regardless of the retirement contribution, then it's $480, leaving her with $960 as well. Wait, no, that's the same as if she had only done one deduction.

Wait, no. Let me recast this.

Wait, if she first takes out 50% for retirement, which is $1200, leaving $1200. Then, from the remaining $1200, she takes out 20%, which is $240, leaving her with $960.

Alternatively, if she took out 20% of $2400 first, that would be $480, leaving her with $1920, then taking out 50% for retirement, which is $960, leaving her with $960.

Wait, that's different. So, depending on the order, she ends up with $960 in both cases? Wait, no, in the first case, she took out retirement first, then car payment, and in the second case, she took out car payment first, then retirement.

Wait, but in reality, she first puts money into retirement, then her car payment comes out of the remaining. So, it's the first case.

Wait, but let me verify.

If she takes out 50% for retirement, then 20% of the original for car, that's a total of 70% taken out, which would be 70% of 2400 is 1680, leaving 720.

Alternatively, if she takes out 20% of original for car, then 50% of original for retirement, that's 70% of original, same as above.

Wait, so is the order of deductions affecting the result?

Wait, let's see:

Case 1:

Retirement first: 50% of 2400 = 1200. Remaining: 1200.

Car payment: 20% of 2400 = 480. Subtract from remaining: 1200 - 480 = 720.

Case 2:

Car payment first: 20% of 2400 = 480. Remaining: 1920.

Retirement: 50% of 2400 = 1200. Subtract from remaining: 1920 - 1200 = 720.

So, same result.

Wait, that's interesting. So, regardless of the order, she ends up with $720.

Wait, so the order does not matter because percentages are being taken from the same total. So, in that case, the answer is $720.

Wait, but in my initial thought, I thought that the car payment was taken from the remaining, which is 20% of 1200, which is 240, so 1200 minus 240 is 960. But if you take 20% of original, regardless, you end up with same result.

Wait, so perhaps the way the question is phrased, "she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment," the word "her" refers to her original paycheck, not the remaining after retirement. So, in that case, she uses 20% of 2400, which is 480, then subtract that from her original.

Wait, but that would leave her with 1920, then she subtracts 1200 for retirement, ending up with 720. Alternatively, if she uses 20% of her remaining after retirement, that would be 240, so ending up with 960.

Wait, so which interpretation is correct?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, let me think about how paychecks work. When you put money into retirement, it's taken out of your paycheck, so your remaining is less. Then, the car payment is taken out of your remaining.

Therefore, the order matters in the sense that the car payment is taken from the remaining after retirement.

Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is:

1. Retirement: 50% of 2400 is 1200. Remaining: 1200.

2. Car payment: 20% of 1200 is 240. Remaining: 960.

Therefore, she has $960 left.

But wait, earlier when I took 20% of the original, I ended up with 720.

So, conflicting results.

Hmm, so which one is it?

Wait, the problem says "She then uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment."

So, after she has already used 50% for retirement, her remaining is 50%. So, "her paycheck" at that point would be 50%, which is 1200. So, 20% of her current paycheck is 20% of 1200, which is 240.

Therefore, she uses 240 for her car payment, leaving her with 960.

Alternatively, if "her paycheck" refers to the original amount, regardless of deductions, then she uses 20% of 2400, which is 480, but that would mean she's using 480 from her original, but she already used 1200 for retirement. So, she can't use 480 more because her original is only 2400.

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe she uses 20% of her current remaining, which is 1200, so 240.

So, that would leave her with 960.

Alternatively, if she uses 20% of her original, she has to take that out regardless of the retirement.

But, in reality, the car payment is a separate deduction from the remaining after retirement.

So, perhaps the correct way is to do 50% for retirement, then 20% of the remaining for car payment.

Let me check with the numbers.

First method:

- Retirement: 50% of 2400 = 1200

- Remaining: 2400 - 1200 = 1200

- Car payment: 20% of remaining 1200 = 240

- Remaining after car payment: 1200 - 240 = 960

Second method:

- Car payment: 20% of 2400 = 480

- Retirement: 50% of 2400 = 1200

- Total deductions: 480 + 1200 = 1680

- Remaining: 2400 - 1680 = 720

But, in reality, the car payment is taken after retirement, so the order matters.

Therefore, the correct remaining amount is 960.

Wait, but let me think again.

If she uses 20% of her original paycheck for the car payment, that would be 480, so she subtracts 480 from her original 2400, leaving her with 1920, then subtracts 1200 for retirement, leaving her with 720.

But, in reality, she can't use 480 from her original because she already took 1200 for retirement. So, she only has 1200 left. Therefore, she uses 20% of 1200, which is 240, leaving her with 960.

Therefore, the correct answer is 960.

Wait, but I'm confused because in the problem statement, it says "her paycheck." Her paycheck is 2400. So, if she's using 20% of her paycheck for the car payment, is it 20% of the original or the remaining?

Hmm, that's ambiguous, but in typical usage, when someone says "uses X% of her paycheck," it's usually X% of her current paycheck. So, if she's already used part of her paycheck, her current is less.

Therefore, after using 50%, her current is 1200, so 20% of that is 240.

Therefore, she has 960 left.

But wait, I'm still a bit confused because the problem didn't specify whether the car payment is 20% of the original or the remaining.

Wait, maybe let's interpret it as a straight percentage of the original.

So, she puts 50% into retirement: 1200.

Then, she uses 20% of her original paycheck (2400) for car payment: 480.

So, total spent: 1200 + 480 = 1680.

Remaining: 2400 - 1680 = 720.

Alternatively, using 20% of her remaining: 240.

So, remaining: 960.

So, it's ambiguous. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach: consider the problem as a series of deductions.

First deduction: 50% for retirement.

Second deduction: 20% for car payment, which is 20% of the original or the remaining.

But, since she has already made a deduction, her remaining is less.

Therefore, in a real-world scenario, the car payment would be taken from the remaining after retirement.

Therefore, the correct calculation is:

After retirement: 2400 - 1200 = 1200.

Then, car payment: 20% of 1200 = 240.

Remaining: 1200 - 240 = 960.

Therefore, she has $960 left.

But, to be thorough, I can compute both ways and see the difference.

First way:

Retirement: 50% of 2400 = 1200.

Car payment: 20% of 2400 = 480.

Total deductions: 1200 + 480 = 1680.

Remaining: 2400 - 1680 = 720.

Second way:

Retirement: 50% of 2400 = 1200.

Remaining: 2400 - 1200 = 1200.

Car payment: 20% of 1200 = 240.

Remaining: 1200 - 240 = 960.

Therefore, depending on interpretation, the answer is either $720 or $960.

But, in the context of the problem, she first puts money into retirement, then pays the car payment from the remaining. So, car payment is after retirement, hence, it's 20% of the remaining.

Therefore, it's $960.

But, to ensure correctness, let's re-examine the wording.

"Greta’s paycheck is $2400.00. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account. She then uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment."

The key is "uses 20% of her paycheck." After she's already taken 50% for retirement, her remaining is 50% of the original, so her "paycheck" at that point is $1200. So, she uses 20% of $1200 for the car payment, which is $240.

Therefore, the answer should be $960.

But, just to be thorough, let me see if there's a different interpretation.

Suppose that she uses 20% of her original paycheck, regardless of her retirement contribution, then she is left with $1920. Then, she uses her retirement contribution, which is 50% of original, $1200, so she is left with $720.

But, in reality, she can't make both deductions from the original, because she's using two portions: one for retirement, one for car.

So, probably, she uses 50% for retirement, then from the remaining, she uses 20% for car payment.

Therefore, remaining is $960.

Hence, the answer is $960.

But, just to make sure, let me think of it in another way.

Suppose her total deductions are 50% for retirement and 20% for car payment, which could be overlapping or not.

But, since she uses 50% first, then 20% of the remaining, the deductions are 50% and 20%*(100-50)=20%*50=10% of original.

So, total deductions: 50% + 10% = 60%, leaving 40% of original.

40% of 2400 is 960.

Therefore, $960.

Therefore, yes, that makes sense.

Alternatively, if she took 20% of original, which is 480, then 50% of original, which is 1200, total deductions 1680, so 2400 - 1680 = 720.

But, in reality, she can't take both deductions from the original, because she's using her paychecks in sequence: first retirement, then car.

Therefore, the correct way is to take 50%, then 20% of the remaining.

Thus, 50% is 1200, remaining 1200, then 20% of 1200 is 240, so remaining 960.

Therefore, the answer is $960.

I think that's solid. So, after both deductions, she has $960 left.

**Final Answer**
Greta has \boxed{960} dollars left to spend.
</think>

Greta’s paycheck is $2400.00. She first puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account, which is calculated as follows:

\[ 0.5 \times 2400 = 1200 \]

This leaves her with:

\[ 2400 - 1200 = 1200 \]

Next, she uses 20% of her remaining paycheck for her monthly car payment. This is calculated as:

\[ 0.2 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtracting this car payment from her remaining amount:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Therefore, Greta has \boxed{960} dollars left to spend.
