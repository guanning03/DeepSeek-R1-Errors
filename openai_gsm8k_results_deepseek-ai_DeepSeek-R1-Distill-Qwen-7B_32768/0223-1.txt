Question:
John drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes.  An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long.  How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?

Correct Answer:
He drinks a bottle of water every 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 minutes
It takes him 45*4=<<45*4=180>>180 minutes to solve an extreme sudoku
So he drinks 180/30=<<180/30=6>>6 bottles in that time
#### 6

Wrong Answer:
Alright, let's try to figure out how many bottles of water John drinks in the time he spends on Sudoku puzzles. Hmm, okay, so John drinks a bottle every half hour. That means every 30 minutes, he consumes one bottle. Got that part.

Now, a normal Sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. So, I guess that's 45 minutes of Sudoku time. But then it says an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times that long. Hmm, so does that mean he does one normal Sudoku and one extreme Sudoku, or does he do multiple extreme Sudokus? The wording says "a normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long." So, maybe he does both: one normal and one extreme? Or is it that he does an extreme Sudoku, which is 4 times longer than a normal one, so 4*45=180 minutes? Hmm, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.

"How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?" So, "that time" refers to the time he spends on Sudoku puzzles. If he does one normal Sudoku and one extreme Sudoku, the total time would be 45 + 180 = 225 minutes. Alternatively, if he just does an extreme Sudoku, which takes 180 minutes, then that's the time. Hmm, the problem says "A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long." So, maybe the "that time" is the time for the extreme Sudoku, which is 4*45=180 minutes. So, he drinks a bottle every half hour, so in 180 minutes, how many half hours are there?

Well, half an hour is 30 minutes, so 180 divided by 30 is 6. So, he drinks 6 bottles. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe he does both a normal and an extreme Sudoku.

If he does one normal Sudoku (45 minutes) and one extreme Sudoku (180 minutes), that's a total of 225 minutes. Then, how many half-hour intervals are there in 225 minutes? 225 divided by 30 is 7.5. But since you can't drink half a bottle, you round down or up? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify whether he can drink a half bottle or not. But since the question is "how many bottles does he drink," it's likely expecting a whole number.

Wait, but let me think again. If he drinks a bottle every half hour, regardless of the activities. So, every 30 minutes, he drinks a bottle. So, in the total time spent on Sudoku, how many 30-minute intervals are there? So, if he does one normal and one extreme, that's 45 + 180 = 225 minutes. 225 divided by 30 is 7.5. But since he can't really drink half a bottle, does that mean he drinks 7 bottles, or 8? Hmm, depends on whether he finishes the 7.5th bottle or not.

Wait, the problem says he drinks a bottle every half hour. So, does that mean every 30 minutes, he drinks one bottle? So, in 30 minutes, he drinks one. In 60 minutes, two, and so on. So, in 225 minutes, that's 225 divided by 30 is 7.5. So, he would have drunk 7 full bottles and half of another. But since the question is asking how many bottles he drinks in that time, does he count the half bottle? Or does he only count full bottles.

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me look back at the problem statement.

"John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?"

So, the "that time" is the time he spends on Sudoku puzzles. If he does one normal and one extreme, the total time is 45 + (4*45) = 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

In 225 minutes, how many half-hour intervals? 225 / 30 = 7.5.

So, does he drink 7.5 bottles? But you can't have half a bottle, so it's either 7 or 8.

But the question is probably expecting a whole number, so maybe 7 full bottles and half of another, but in terms of count, it's 7.5.

Wait, but in the problem statement, he drinks a bottle every half hour, so it's every 30 minutes. So, starting at time zero, he drinks one. Then at 30 minutes, another, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240... Wait, 240 is more than 225. So, how many bottles?

Let me count:

- At 0 minutes: 1 bottle
- 30: 2
- 60: 3
- 90: 4
- 120:5
- 150:6
- 180:7
- 210:8
But he stops at 225, which is between 210 and 240. So, he would have drunk 7 bottles by 180 minutes, and then between 180 and 225, he hasn't had another bottle yet, right?

Wait, but hold on, he drinks a bottle every half hour. So, does that mean at each half hour mark, he drinks one? So, at 0, 30, 60, etc. So, in 225 minutes, how many mark times have passed?

225 divided by 30 is 7.5, so 7 full marks and a half. So, does he drink 7 bottles because he hasn't completed the 8th at 225? Or does he drink 8 because he started the 8th?

Hmm, depending on whether he drinks the bottle as soon as the half hour mark passes or at the beginning.

If he drinks at the start of each half hour, then at 0, 30, 60,...210,240. So, at 210, he drinks the 8th bottle, and then from 210 to 240, he hasn't drunk the 9th yet. But since the total time is 225, which is after 210, he would have drunk 8 bottles, and then partway through drinking the 9th. But the problem says "how many bottles does he drink in that time?" So, if he started drinking the 9th bottle at 210 minutes, but only spent 15 minutes of it by 225, does that count as drinking a bottle? Probably not, because he hasn't finished it yet. So, he only fully drank 8 bottles? Wait, no, because at 210, he had already drunk 8 bottles, and then at 240, he would have drunk the 9th. But since he stopped at 225, he only had 15 minutes into the 9th. So, he hasn't fully drunk a bottle yet. So, he only drank 8 bottles.

Wait, hold on, let's think differently. How many intervals of 30 minutes are in 225 minutes? 7.5. So, each bottle is consumed over 30 minutes, but he drinks a bottle every 30 minutes. So, the number of bottles is equal to the number of intervals. So, 7.5 intervals, meaning 7.5 bottles. But you can't have half a bottle, so he would have drunk 7 full bottles and is in the middle of the 8th. But again, does that count as 7 or 8? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says he drinks a bottle every half hour. So, if he starts drinking a bottle at time zero, and takes 30 minutes to finish it, then he would finish it at 30 minutes, and immediately start another one. So, in 30 minutes, he drinks one bottle. In 60 minutes, two bottles, etc. So, in 225 minutes, how many bottles does he finish?

So, the time to finish each bottle is 30 minutes, so the number of bottles is equal to the number of 30-minute intervals in the total time. So, 225 / 30 = 7.5. So, he finishes 7 full bottles and is halfway through the 8th. So, in terms of completed bottles, he has 7. But if we're counting how many he started, he started 8. But the question is "how many bottles does he drink in that time." So, does he count the one he's in the middle of drinking? Probably not, because he hasn't finished it yet. So, it's 7 bottles.

But wait, another way to think about it: if he drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, then in 225 minutes, the number of bottles is the ceiling of 225 / 30, which is 8. So, 8 bottles. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe we can model it as a rate. He drinks 1 bottle every 30 minutes, so his rate is 1/30 bottles per minute. Then, over 225 minutes, he drinks 225*(1/30) = 7.5 bottles. Since you can't have half a bottle, we need to interpret whether it's 7 or 8.

But the problem is in the context of discrete bottles, not a continuous rate. So, it's either 7 or 8. But let's think about it in terms of events. He drinks a bottle at each 30-minute mark. So, at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240,... So, at 225, he has had bottles at 0,30,60,90,120,150,180,210. So that's 8 bottles. Because each mark is a bottle.

Wait, but he starts drinking at 0, finishes at 30, starts another at 30, finishes at 60, and so on. So, in 225 minutes, how many finishes have happened? At 30,60,90,120,150,180,210. So, 7 finishes, meaning he has drunk 7 bottles, and is in the process of drinking the 8th at 210. So, he hasn't completed the 8th yet.

Therefore, the number of bottles he has drunk is 7.

But wait, this is confusing. Let me think of it another way.

If he drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, starting at time 0, then:

- From 0 to 30: bottle 1
- 30 to 60: bottle 2
- 60 to 90: bottle 3
- 90 to 120: bottle 4
- 120 to 150: bottle 5
- 150 to 180: bottle 6
- 180 to 210: bottle 7
- 210 to 240: bottle 8

So, in 225 minutes, which is between 210 and 240, he has completed 7 bottles, and is in the 8th. So, depending on whether he counts the one he started, it's either 7 or 8.

But the question is "how many bottles of water does he drink in that time?" So, if he started drinking the 8th bottle at 210, and the total time is 225, which is 15 minutes into the 8th bottle. So, he hasn't finished it yet, so he hasn't drunk the 8th. So, he has drunk 7 bottles.

But wait, another perspective: when you drink a bottle every 30 minutes, does that mean that in each 30-minute interval, he consumes a bottle? So, in the first 30 minutes, he drinks one, in the next 30, another, etc. So, in total time T, the number of bottles is T divided by 30, rounded down.

So, 225 / 30 = 7.5, which would be 7 bottles.

Alternatively, if you consider that he drinks a bottle at each half-hour mark, so at 0,30,60,...,210,240. So, in 225 minutes, he has had 7 full bottle drinking events, so 7 bottles.

But in the 8th event, he hasn't started yet at 225. Wait, no, he started the 8th at 210, so he has 225 - 210 = 15 minutes into the 8th bottle. So, he hasn't completed it yet, so only 7.

But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe it's 8 because he started the 8th. But in terms of completed bottles, it's 7. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about a smaller example. Suppose he spends 30 minutes. How many bottles? 1. If he spends 60 minutes, 2. So, 30 minutes: 1, 60: 2, 90:3, 120:4, 150:5, 180:6, 210:7, 240:8.

So, at 225 minutes, he is still in the 8th bottle. So, he hasn't completed it yet. So, he has drunk 7 bottles.

Therefore, the answer is 7.

Wait, but 225 / 30 is 7.5. So, that's 7 bottles and a half. So, maybe 7.5 bottles? But you can't have half a bottle. So, the answer is 7 full bottles.

Alternatively, if we model it as a rate, 1 bottle per 30 minutes, so 225 minutes would be 7.5 bottles. But since you can't have half a bottle, it's either 7 or 8.

But in the context of the problem, it's asking "how many bottles does he drink in that time?" So, he can't drink half a bottle; he either finishes it or not. So, if he started a bottle, does that count? It's a bit ambiguous, but in most counting problems, if you're in the middle of an event, you don't count it unless it's completed. So, if he started a bottle at 210 and only drank 15 minutes of it by 225, he hasn't completed it, so it doesn't count.

Therefore, he has drunk 7 bottles.

But hold on, another way: the problem says he drinks a bottle every half hour. So, the interval between drinks is 30 minutes. So, the number of drinks is equal to the number of intervals. So, 225 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 7.5 intervals. So, 7 full bottles, and half an interval.

But in reality, he can't have half an interval. So, he has 7 bottles, and is halfway through the 8th. So, since the question is about how many bottles he drinks in that time, the 8th is not completed, so it's 7.

Alternatively, if he drinks a bottle every half hour, starting at time 0, then at 30 he drinks one, 60 another, etc. So, in 225 minutes, how many bottles has he drunk? 225 / 30 = 7.5. So, he's drunk 7 full bottles, and is in the process of the 8th. So, he has drunk 7 bottles.

But wait, let me check the initial problem again. It says "A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long." So, does that mean that the total time he spends is 45 + (4*45) = 225 minutes? Or is he doing both puzzles simultaneously? Or is he doing one after the other? The wording is a bit unclear.

Wait, let's parse the sentence: "A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long." So, that sounds like he does two puzzles: one normal and one extreme. So, the time is 45 + (4*45) = 225 minutes. So, he spends 225 minutes on Sudoku, during which he drinks water every half hour.

So, in 225 minutes, how many bottles does he drink? So, 225 / 30 = 7.5. So, 7 full bottles and half of another. So, as per the problem, does he count the half bottle? If he had a half bottle left, does that mean he drank it? Or is he still in the middle of it.

But the problem says "how many bottles of water does he drink in that time." So, if he started drinking a bottle during that time, even if he only drank part of it, does that count as a bottle? Or only full bottles?

In most problems, unless specified otherwise, you count only completed bottles. So, if he had started a bottle but didn't finish, it doesn't count. So, in this case, he has drunk 7 full bottles, and is in the middle of the 8th. So, he has drunk 7 bottles.

But wait, another way: if he drinks a bottle every half hour, regardless of whether he's in the middle of another. So, the number of bottles is equal to the number of half-hour intervals in the total time, rounded up. So, 225 minutes is 3.75 hours. 3.75 / 0.5 = 7.5. Rounded up, that's 8. So, 8 bottles.

Hmm, now I'm confused because different interpretations give different answers.

Wait, maybe the key is that he drinks a bottle every half hour. So, the rate is 1 bottle per 30 minutes. So, in t minutes, he drinks t / 30 bottles. So, 225 / 30 = 7.5. So, 7.5 bottles. But since you can't have half a bottle, you have to decide if it's 7 or 8.

But the question is "how many bottles...", so 7.5 is not a whole number. But in reality, he can't drink half a bottle, so maybe it's 7. But again, if you're counting the number of bottles he's attempted to drink, it's 8. Because he started drinking the 8th one. But if you count completed bottles, it's 7.

Given that the question is about how many bottles he drinks, I think it's referring to completed bottles, so 7.

But another perspective: if he drinks a bottle every half hour, starting at time 0, and the time is 225 minutes, so he has completed 7 bottles and is halfway through the 8th. So, he has 7 completed bottles, and is in the process of the 8th. So, the answer is 7.

Alternatively, if the question is just asking for the number of bottles he drinks in that time, regardless of completion, it might be 8. But in standard terminology, when someone asks how many they drank, it usually refers to completed ones.

Wait, perhaps I can think of another angle. Maybe the total time is 225 minutes, so how many half-hour intervals are in that? 7.5. So, he can drink 7 full bottles and is halfway through the 8th. So, the number of bottles he has consumed is 7.5, but since you can't have half, it's 7.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 8 because he's started the 8th, but hasn't finished it yet.

Wait, in real life, if you're at a bank teller machine, and you start a transaction, even if you haven't finished it yet, you count the number you've started. But in this case, it's drinking water. So, if he's in the middle of drinking a bottle, is that considered as drinking a bottle? Hmm, maybe.

But in terms of bottles consumed, it's more about completed bottles. So, unless he finishes it, it's not counted. So, 7.

Wait, let me think of a similar problem. If someone says, "how many times does he drink water in 30 minutes," the answer would be once. So, in 45 minutes, how many times does he drink? 45 / 30 = 1.5, so once fully, and half a time. So, he drinks once. So, same here, 7.5 times, so 7 full times.

Therefore, 7 bottles.

But then again, maybe the problem expects 8. Since it's a rate, 1 bottle every 30 minutes, so in 225 minutes, 225 / 30 = 7.5, so 8 bottles, rounding up. So, 8.

Hmm, so which is it?

Wait, perhaps the problem is structured as: he drinks a bottle every half hour, meaning that in one hour, he drinks two bottles. So, in 225 minutes, which is 3.75 hours, how many bottles? 3.75 * 2 = 7.5. So, 7.5 bottles.

But since you can't have half a bottle, you can either say 7 or 8.

But since the problem doesn't specify whether to round up or down, or to consider partial bottles, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in most math problems, unless specified, you probably round down to the nearest whole number.

So, 7 bottles.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting 8, because he started the 8th bottle. So, it's ambiguous.

Wait, let's think of how the problem is phrased: "how many bottles of water does he drink in that time?" The time is the total time he spends on Sudoku puzzles, which is 225 minutes. So, during those 225 minutes, he drinks water every half hour.

So, if he drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, starting at time zero, then:

- At 0: drinks 1
- At 30: drinks 2
- At 60: drinks 3
- At 90: drinks 4
- At 120: drinks 5
- At 150: drinks 6
- At 180: drinks 7
- At 210: drinks 8

So, at 210 minutes, he has just started drinking the 8th bottle. So, at 225 minutes, he has 15 minutes left in the 8th bottle. So, he has drunk 8 bottles, but hasn't finished the 8th. So, if the question is asking how many bottles he has drunk, it's 8.

But if it's asking how many bottles he has completed, it's 7.

The wording is "how many bottles of water does he drink in that time." So, if he is in the process of drinking a bottle, does that count as drinking it? In real life, you can say someone is drinking a bottle, so maybe yes. So, maybe 8.

But in math problems, usually, unless specified otherwise, you count completed bottles. So, 7.

But I'm still a bit confused. Maybe I need to look for similar problems.

Wait, for example, if someone says, "If a snail crawls a foot every minute, how many feet does it crawl in 15 minutes?" The answer would be 15 / 60 = 0.25 feet, which is 3 inches. But since you can't have a fraction of a foot, you might say 0 feet, but that's not correct. So, in reality, you can have fractions.

Similarly, with water bottles, it's 7.5. But since you can't have half a bottle, maybe you have to represent it as a fraction. But the problem asks for bottles, so it's expecting a whole number.

So, maybe 7 bottles because he hasn't completed the 8th.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects 8 because he started drinking the 8th.

But in the absence of specific instructions, I think it's safer to assume that the number of completed bottles is 7.

But wait, in the initial problem, does it say he drinks a bottle every half hour, meaning the time between drinks is 30 minutes. So, the number of bottles is equal to the number of intervals in the total time.

So, 225 / 30 = 7.5 intervals, so 7 full bottles, and half an interval.

So, if each interval corresponds to a bottle, then 7.5 intervals mean 7 full bottles. So, the answer is 7.

Alternatively, if you model it as the number of times he drank, it's 7.5, which would be 8 if you round up.

But in the context of the problem, it's more about the number of bottles he has consumed, which is 7.5. So, if you have to give a whole number, it's 7 or 8.

But since the problem is in English, and if he starts drinking a bottle, even if he doesn't finish it, it's still starting. So, maybe 8.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's see the problem again.

"John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?"

So, "that time" refers to the time he spends on Sudoku puzzles, which is a normal and an extreme, so 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

In 225 minutes, he drinks a bottle every 30 minutes.

So, number of bottles is 225 / 30 = 7.5. So, 7 full bottles and half of another. So, he has drunk 7 bottles, and is halfway through the 8th.

Therefore, in that time, he has drunk 7 bottles.

But wait, but he started the 8th bottle, so is that considered as drinking a bottle? Or is it only counted when it's finished?

I think in this context, since he started drinking during the time, but didn't finish, it doesn't count. So, only 7.

But to be thorough, let's consider both interpretations:

1. Completed bottles: 7.

2. Started bottles: 8.

But since the problem says he drinks a bottle every half hour, it's implied that each bottle is consumed over 30 minutes. So, if he started a bottle, he's in the process of drinking it, but hasn't finished. So, unless the bottle is finished, it's not counted.

So, the answer is 7.

But hold on, another way: if he has a bottle every half hour, starting at 0, then at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240 minutes. So, in 225 minutes, how many bottles has he started? He has started 8 bottles: at 0,30,60,90,120,150,180,210. So, 8 bottles.

But he hasn't completed the 8th, so he hasn't drunk it yet. So, does he count the ones he's started but not finished? If so, it's 8.

But in reality, when someone says "how many bottles does he drink," they usually mean how many he has consumed, not started.

So, 7.

But maybe the problem is structured in a way that the extreme Sudoku is 4 times the normal, so 4*45=180, so total time is 45+180=225.

So, during 225 minutes, how many half-hour intervals are there? 225/30=7.5. So, 7 full bottles, and half of another.

So, in terms of bottles, it's 7.5, but since you can't have half a bottle, it's either 7 or 8. Since he started the 8th, maybe 8.

But in conclusion, I think the answer is 8 bottles because he started drinking the 8th one during the total time.

Wait, but if you think of the time as the total time he's active, meaning he starts drinking at 0, and the total time is 225 minutes, so he has time to drink 8 bottles because he can start the 8th at 210 and finish it at 240, which is beyond 225. So, he's halfway through the 8th bottle at 225, but he has started it. So, if you count started bottles, it's 8.

But I'm really torn between 7 and 8.

Wait, maybe think of it as the number of times he drank. So, he drank once at 0, once at 30, ..., up to 210. So, 8 times. So, 8 bottles.

But if he hasn't finished the 8th, then he hasn't drunk it yet.

So, I think the answer is 8.

Wait, in the problem statement, "how many bottles of water does he drink in that time?" So, the time is 225 minutes. So, he drinks a bottle every half hour, starting at 0.

So, in 225 minutes, he has drunk 8 bottles, with the 8th one finishing at 240, which is beyond 225. So, he has drunk 8 bottles, but only completed 7.

Wait, no. He started drinking the 8th at 210, which is within the 225-minute timeframe, but hasn't finished it yet. So, he has drunk 8 bottles, but 7 are completed, and one is in progress.

So, depending on whether you count completed or started, it's 7 or 8.

But in the context of the problem, I think it's asking how many he has consumed, so completed. So, 7.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 8 because he started drinking the 8th, so he has consumed 8 bottles.

But I'm not 100% sure. In most cases, when you drink something in a certain time, it's the completed ones. So, 7.

But wait, let me think of a different approach. Let's model it as a function.

Number of bottles = floor(total time / bottle time) or ceiling(total time / bottle time).

So, total time is 225, bottle time is 30.

floor(225 / 30) = 7.

ceiling(225 /30) = 8.

So, depending on whether you want the number of completed bottles or the number of bottles attempted, it's 7 or 8.

But since the question is about how many bottles he drinks, it's the completed ones, so 7.

Alternatively, if it's about how many he attempts, it's 8. But in the context, "drinks a bottle of water every half hour," so it's about how many he actually consumes.

So, 7.

Therefore, I think the answer is 7 bottles.

**Final Answer**
The number of bottles John drinks in that time is \boxed{7}.
</think>

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 180 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends on Sudoku puzzles is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

To determine how many bottles of water John drinks in 225 minutes, we note that he drinks a bottle every 30 minutes. We calculate the number of 30-minute intervals in 225 minutes:

\[
\frac{225 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 7.5
\]

Since John can only complete whole bottles, we consider the number of completed bottles. He finishes 7 full bottles in 210 minutes and starts the 8th bottle at 210 minutes, but doesn't finish it by 225 minutes. Therefore, he has drunk 7 full bottles.

Thus, the number of bottles of water John drinks in that time is \boxed{7}.
