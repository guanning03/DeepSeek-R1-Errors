Question:
Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn’t fully charged yet. Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends’ phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. 5 hours later the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?

Correct Answer:
At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.
Later on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.
The power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I need to figure out the charge of Maria's power bank when she went to the park. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park. Then she disconnected it and noticed it wasn't fully charged. So, the power bank had some charge when she left to go to the park, but it wasn't 100%. Then, her friends asked if they could charge their phones, so she started charging her power bank. While charging, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. That's interesting. So, when she was charging it, it was losing charge? That doesn't make much sense because charging usually increases the charge, not decreases it. Wait, maybe I misread that. Let me check: "she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour." Hmm, so maybe she was charging it while using it? Or maybe there's a disconnect in the charging circuit? Wait, perhaps she was charging her phone instead of her power bank? Wait, no. Let me read the problem again.

"Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn't fully charged yet. Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends’ phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. 5 hours later the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?"

Wait, so she was charging her power bank, but then disconnected it. Then, her friends asked her to charge their phones, and while doing that, her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, while charging her own power bank, it was losing charge? That seems contradictory because charging should increase it, but maybe if she was using some other function or maybe a malfunction. Hmm, confusing.

Wait, maybe she was charging her phone while using the power bank? Hmm, not sure. Let me try to parse the timeline.

1. Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park. So, she was charging it, but then disconnected it. At that point, the power bank wasn't fully charged yet. So, maybe she was only partially charging it, or maybe it had some charge already? Hmm.

2. Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. So, she agreed to charge their phones, but while doing so, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, she was charging her friends' phones, but her own power bank was draining at 9% per hour. That's unusual because she was using the power bank to charge phones, but the power bank itself was losing charge. Maybe the power bank was in a state where it was losing charge when being used? Or maybe the charging function was faulty.

3. Then, 5 hours later, the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. So, after 5 hours of draining at 9% per hour, the rate changed to 7% per hour for 3 hours. Finally, the charge remaining was 28%. So, we need to find out the charge when she went to the park.

So, perhaps we can model this as follows:

Let me denote the initial charge when Maria went to the park as C (in percentage). So, C is what we need to find.

Then, she starts charging her friends' phones, and during this time, her power bank is losing charge at 9% per hour. So, for 5 hours, the power bank is losing 9% each hour.

After 5 hours, the rate changes to 7% loss per hour for another 3 hours. So, total time is 5 + 3 = 8 hours.

After these 8 hours, the remaining charge is 28%.

So, let's model the charge after each period.

First period: 5 hours at 9% loss per hour.

Second period: 3 hours at 7% loss per hour.

We can write the charge after each period as:

Charge after first period: C - 9% * 5

But wait, actually, losing 9% per hour means that each hour, the charge decreases by 9%, so the remaining charge is multiplied by (1 - 0.09) = 0.91 each hour.

Similarly, for the second period, the remaining charge is multiplied by (1 - 0.07) = 0.93 each hour.

So, more accurately, the charge after the first 5 hours is C * (0.91)^5.

Then, after the next 3 hours, it's C * (0.91)^5 * (0.93)^3.

And this equals 28%, so we can set up the equation:

C * (0.91)^5 * (0.93)^3 = 28

Then, solving for C:

C = 28 / [(0.91)^5 * (0.93)^3]

So, let me compute (0.91)^5 first.

Calculating (0.91)^5:

0.91^1 = 0.91

0.91^2 = 0.91 * 0.91 = 0.8281

0.91^3 = 0.8281 * 0.91 ≈ 0.8281 * 0.91. Let me compute 0.8281 * 0.9: 0.8281 * 0.9 = 0.74529, and 0.8281 * 0.01 = 0.008281, so total ≈ 0.74529 + 0.008281 ≈ 0.753571

0.91^4 = 0.753571 * 0.91 ≈ 0.753571 * 0.9 = 0.678214, plus 0.753571 * 0.01 = 0.00753571, so total ≈ 0.678214 + 0.00753571 ≈ 0.6857497

0.91^5 ≈ 0.6857497 * 0.91. Let's compute 0.6857497 * 0.9 = 0.61717473, and 0.6857497 * 0.01 = 0.006857497, so total ≈ 0.61717473 + 0.006857497 ≈ 0.624032227

So, approximately 0.624032227.

Now, calculating (0.93)^3:

0.93^1 = 0.93

0.93^2 = 0.93 * 0.93 = 0.8649

0.93^3 = 0.8649 * 0.93. Let's compute 0.8649 * 0.9 = 0.77841, and 0.8649 * 0.03 = 0.025947. Adding them together: 0.77841 + 0.025947 ≈ 0.804357

So, approximately 0.804357.

Now, multiply the two results:

0.624032227 * 0.804357 ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.624 * 0.804:

First, 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48

0.6 * 0.004 = 0.0024

0.024 * 0.8 = 0.0192

0.024 * 0.004 = 0.000096

Adding them up: 0.48 + 0.0024 = 0.4824; 0.0192 + 0.000096 = 0.019296; total ≈ 0.4824 + 0.019296 ≈ 0.501696

But wait, that's approximate. Maybe a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, multiply 0.624032227 * 0.804357.

Let me write it as:

0.624032227 * 0.804357 ≈

First, 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48

0.6 * 0.004357 ≈ 0.0026142

0.024032227 * 0.8 ≈ 0.0192257816

0.024032227 * 0.004357 ≈ approximately 0.0001046

Adding them together:

0.48 + 0.0026142 ≈ 0.4826142

0.0192257816 + 0.0001046 ≈ 0.0193303816

Total ≈ 0.4826142 + 0.0193303816 ≈ 0.5019445816

So, approximately 0.5019445816.

So, approximately 0.5019445816.

Therefore, the denominator is approximately 0.5019445816.

So, C = 28 / 0.5019445816 ≈ ?

28 divided by 0.5019445816.

Let me compute that.

28 / 0.5 is 56, but since it's 0.5019445816, it's slightly less than 0.5, so the result will be slightly more than 56.

Compute 28 / 0.5019445816.

Let's see:

0.5019445816 * 55 = ?

0.5 * 55 = 27.5

0.0019445816 * 55 ≈ 0.106952

So, total ≈ 27.5 + 0.106952 ≈ 27.606952

Which is less than 28. So, 55 gives us ~27.606952, which is less than 28.

So, 55 + (28 - 27.606952)/0.5019445816

Difference: 28 - 27.606952 ≈ 0.393048

So, 0.393048 / 0.5019445816 ≈ approximately 0.782

So, total C ≈ 55 + 0.782 ≈ 55.782

Therefore, approximately 55.78%.

So, the charge when Maria went to the park was approximately 55.78%, which is roughly 55.8%.

But let me verify this.

Wait, 28 divided by 0.5019445816.

Let me use another approach.

Let me compute 28 / 0.5019445816.

First, note that 0.5019445816 ≈ 0.5019446

So, 28 / 0.5019446 ≈ ?

Well, 28 / 0.5 = 56

But 0.5019446 is 0.5 + 0.0019446

So, 28 / (0.5 + 0.0019446) ≈ 28 / 0.5 * (1 / (1 + 0.0038892)) ≈ 56 * (1 - 0.0038892) ≈ 56 * 0.9961108 ≈ 56 - 56 * 0.0038892 ≈ 56 - 0.2178 ≈ 55.782

Yes, so 55.782%, which is approximately 55.78%.

So, rounding to two decimal places, it's 55.78%, but since the question might expect a whole number, maybe 56%? Or perhaps 55.8%? But let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps I can compute this more precisely.

Let me compute (0.91)^5 more accurately.

0.91^1 = 0.91

0.91^2 = 0.91 * 0.91 = 0.8281

0.91^3 = 0.8281 * 0.91

Let me compute 0.8281 * 0.91:

0.8281 * 0.9 = 0.74529

0.8281 * 0.01 = 0.008281

Adding together: 0.74529 + 0.008281 = 0.753571

So, 0.753571

0.91^4 = 0.753571 * 0.91

Compute 0.753571 * 0.9 = 0.6782139

0.753571 * 0.01 = 0.00753571

Adding together: 0.6782139 + 0.00753571 ≈ 0.68574961

0.91^5 = 0.68574961 * 0.91

Compute 0.68574961 * 0.9 = 0.617174649

0.68574961 * 0.01 = 0.0068574961

Adding together: 0.617174649 + 0.0068574961 ≈ 0.6240321451

So, (0.91)^5 = approximately 0.6240321451

Similarly, (0.93)^3:

0.93^1 = 0.93

0.93^2 = 0.8649

0.93^3 = 0.8649 * 0.93

Compute 0.8649 * 0.9 = 0.77841

0.8649 * 0.03 = 0.025947

Adding together: 0.77841 + 0.025947 ≈ 0.804357

So, (0.93)^3 ≈ 0.804357

Now, multiply the two results:

0.6240321451 * 0.804357

Let me compute this more accurately.

First, write both numbers:

0.6240321451

0.804357

Multiply them:

Let me denote A = 0.6240321451

B = 0.804357

Compute A * B.

Multiply 0.6240321451 * 0.804357

Let me write it as:

0.6240321451 * 0.8 = 0.4992257161

0.6240321451 * 0.004357 ≈ ?

Compute 0.6240321451 * 0.004 = 0.0024961286

0.6240321451 * 0.000357 ≈ 0.0002230213

Adding them together: 0.0024961286 + 0.0002230213 ≈ 0.0027191499

Now, add this to the previous result:

0.4992257161 + 0.0027191499 ≈ 0.501944866

So, A * B ≈ 0.501944866

So, denominator is approximately 0.501944866

Thus, C = 28 / 0.501944866 ≈ ?

Compute 28 / 0.501944866

Again, 0.501944866 is approximately 0.501945

So, 28 / 0.501945 ≈ ?

As before, 28 / 0.5 = 56

But since 0.501945 is 0.5 + 0.001945

So, 28 / (0.5 + 0.001945) = 28 / 0.5 * (1 / (1 + 0.00389)) ≈ 56 * (1 - 0.00389 + (0.00389)^2 - ... ) ≈ 56 * (1 - 0.00389) ≈ 56 * 0.99611 ≈ 56 - 56 * 0.00389 ≈ 56 - 0.21784 ≈ 55.78216

So, approximately 55.78216%, which is about 55.78%

So, the initial charge when Maria went to the park was approximately 55.78%, so about 55.8%.

But since the problem is given in whole percentages, maybe it's 56%. But let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 55.8%, but the question might want an exact fractional value or something. Wait, but the problem didn't specify, just asked for the charge, so probably to the nearest whole number or one decimal place.

But let me see if it's exactly 56%.

Wait, let me check the exact multiplication.

Is 0.6240321451 * 0.804357 exactly 0.501944866?

Yes, as computed above.

So, 28 / 0.501944866 is approximately 55.78216

So, 55.78216%, which is approximately 55.78%.

So, if we are to give the answer as a percentage, maybe 55.8%, but perhaps we can represent it as a fraction or something.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact fractional value.

Wait, let's compute 28 / (0.91^5 * 0.93^3) exactly.

But 0.91 is 91/100, and 0.93 is 93/100.

So, (0.91)^5 = (91/100)^5

(0.93)^3 = (93/100)^3

So, C = 28 / [ (91/100)^5 * (93/100)^3 ]

Which is equal to 28 * (100/91)^5 * (100/93)^3

So, 28 * (100^5 / 91^5) * (100^3 / 93^3) = 28 * (100^(5+3)) / (91^5 * 93^3) = 28 * 100^8 / (91^5 * 93^3)

But this seems complicated to compute exactly. Maybe we can compute it as is.

Alternatively, let me compute it as decimal.

So, 28 / (0.91^5 * 0.93^3) ≈ 28 / 0.501944866 ≈ 55.78216

So, approximately 55.78%

But perhaps the answer is 56%, as a whole number.

But let me check, is 55.78% close enough to 56%? Or maybe 55.8%.

Wait, 0.501944866 is approximately 0.501945

So, 28 / 0.501945 ≈ 55.78216

So, 55.78216 is approximately 55.78%, which is approximately 55.8%.

But since 0.78216 is more than 0.75, it rounds to 55.8%, which is approximately 55.8%.

Alternatively, if we want to keep it to one decimal place, 55.8%.

But the problem didn't specify, so perhaps we can give it as 55.8%.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact fractional value is preferred.

Wait, 55.78216 is approximately 55.782, which is roughly 55 782/1000, which simplifies to 55 391/500, but that's messy.

Alternatively, is 55.78216% a more precise way.

But maybe the answer is 56%.

Wait, but to be precise, perhaps 55.8%.

But in the absence of specific instructions, maybe 55.8% is acceptable.

Alternatively, if we can express it as a fraction, perhaps we can, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer should be 55.78%, but in the box, we can write \boxed{55.8}

But let me see if that is correct.

Wait, let me verify.

Let me compute the exact value step by step.

We have:

C = 28 / (0.91^5 * 0.93^3)

Compute 0.91^5:

0.91^1 = 0.91

0.91^2 = 0.8281

0.91^3 = 0.753571

0.91^4 = 0.68574961

0.91^5 = 0.6240321451

Similarly, 0.93^3:

0.93^1 = 0.93

0.93^2 = 0.8649

0.93^3 = 0.804357

Thus, 0.91^5 * 0.93^3 = 0.6240321451 * 0.804357 ≈ 0.501944866

Thus, C = 28 / 0.501944866 ≈ 55.78216

So, 55.78216%, which is approximately 55.78%

So, that's about 55.78%, which is approximately 55.8%

Alternatively, since 0.78216 is more than 0.77778 (which is 7/9 ≈ 0.77778), so 0.78216 is roughly 78.216%, which is approximately 78.2%, but no, wait, 0.78216 is the decimal part.

Wait, no, C ≈ 55.78216%, so the decimal part is 0.78216, so 78.216% of a percent, which is not the case.

Wait, no. Wait, sorry, 55.78216% is 55 and 0.78216 percent, not 78.216%.

Wait, no, no, 55.78216% is 55.78216 percent, which is approximately 55.78%.

So, just over 55.75%, which is 55 and three-quarters percent.

But, perhaps, the question expects an exact fractional value. So, let's compute 28 / (0.91^5 * 0.93^3) exactly.

But 0.91 is 91/100, 0.93 is 93/100.

So, let me compute (91/100)^5 and (93/100)^3.

So, (91/100)^5 = 91^5 / 100^5

Similarly, (93/100)^3 = 93^3 / 100^3

Thus, the denominator is (91^5 * 93^3) / 100^(5+3) = (91^5 * 93^3) / 100^8

Thus, C = 28 / [ (91^5 * 93^3) / 100^8 ] = 28 * (100^8) / (91^5 * 93^3 )

So, it's 28 * (100^8) / (91^5 * 93^3 )

Calculating this exactly is going to be cumbersome, but let me see if we can simplify.

First, 100^8 = (10^2)^8 = 10^16

91^5 = 91 * 91 * 91 * 91 * 91

93^3 = 93 * 93 * 93

So, perhaps we can compute the numerator and denominator.

But this is going to be a huge number, so perhaps it's not practical.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute 100^8 / (91^5 * 93^3 ) as:

(100^8) / (91^5 * 93^3 ) = (100/91)^5 * (100/93)^3

So, that's (100/91)^5 * (100/93)^3

Which is equal to (100^5 / 91^5) * (100^3 / 93^3 ) = 100^(5+3) / (91^5 * 93^3 ) = 100^8 / (91^5 * 93^3 )

Which brings us back to the original expression.

So, perhaps, in decimal, it's approximately 55.78%

Alternatively, if we compute 28 * (100^8) / (91^5 * 93^3 )

But 100^8 is 1e16

91^5: 91^2=8281, 91^3=91*8281=753571, 91^4=91*753571=68574961, 91^5=91*68574961=6240321451

Similarly, 93^3=93*93*93=804357

So, denominator is 91^5 * 93^3 = 6240321451 * 804357

Compute that:

6240321451 * 804357

This is a huge number, so perhaps we can approximate it as 6.240321451e9 * 8.04357e5 = approximately 6.240321451 * 8.04357 * 10^(9+5) = 6.240321451 * 8.04357 * 10^14

Compute 6.240321451 * 8.04357:

6 * 8 = 48

6 * 0.04357 ≈ 0.26142

0.240321451 * 8 ≈ 1.922571608

0.240321451 * 0.04357 ≈ 0.0104725

Adding all together:

48 + 0.26142 + 1.922571608 + 0.0104725 ≈ 50.1944541

So, approximately 50.1944541 * 10^14 = 5.01944541 * 10^15

Therefore, denominator is approximately 5.01944541 * 10^15

Thus, C = 28 / (5.01944541 * 10^15 ) * 1e16

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, C = 28 * (100^8) / (91^5 * 93^3 ) ≈ 28 * (1e16) / (5.01944541e15 ) ≈ 28 * (1e16 / 5.01944541e15 ) ≈ 28 * (10 / 5.01944541 ) ≈ 28 * 1.9923 ≈ 55.78

So, C ≈ 55.78

Thus, confirming our earlier result.

Therefore, the charge when Maria went to the park was approximately 55.78%, which is about 55.8%.

Since the problem is presented in whole numbers for the percentages (5% loss each hour), perhaps they expect a whole number. So, 56%.

But to check:

If the initial charge was 56%, then:

After 5 hours at 9% loss per hour:

56% * (0.91)^5 ≈ 56% * 0.624032 ≈ 56 * 0.624032 ≈ 34.945%

Then, starting from 34.945%, it loses 7% per hour for 3 hours:

After 3 hours, it's 34.945% * (0.93)^3 ≈ 34.945% * 0.804357 ≈ 34.945 * 0.804357 ≈ 28.13%

Wait, that's approximately 28.13%, which is close to 28%, as given.

So, if C was 56%, the final charge is approximately 28.13%, which is close to the given 28%.

Therefore, 56% is a reasonable whole number answer.

But wait, in reality, the exact value is 55.78%, which is approximately 55.8%, so 55.8% is more precise.

But since in the problem, the rates are given in whole numbers (9%, 7%), the answer is probably expected to be a whole number, which is 56%.

Therefore, I think 56% is the answer they are looking for.

**Final Answer**
The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was \boxed{56\%}.
</think>

Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park. When she arrived, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends’ phones, her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours. After that, her power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour for 3 hours. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. We need to find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park.

1. Let \( C \) be the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park.
2. The power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours. This means the remaining charge after 5 hours is \( C \times (0.91)^5 \).
3. After 5 hours, the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour for 3 hours. This means the remaining charge after another 3 hours is \( C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \).
4. The remaining charge is given as 28%. Therefore, we have the equation:
   \[
   C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 28
   \]
5. Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{28}{(0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3}
   \]
6. Calculating \( (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \).
7. Multiplying these results:
   \[
   0.624032 \times 0.804357 \approx 0.501944866
   \]
8. Dividing 28 by this result:
   \[
   C \approx \frac{28}{0.501944866} \approx 55.78\%
   \]
9. Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get 56%.

Thus, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was \(\boxed{56\%}\).
