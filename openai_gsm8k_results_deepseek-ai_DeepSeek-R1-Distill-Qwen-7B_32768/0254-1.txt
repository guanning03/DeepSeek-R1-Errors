Question:
You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?

Correct Answer:
The super ticket costs $20 and for $1 extra I can get a popcorn and a soda, there I'd pay in total $20+$1 = $<<20+1=21>>21
If I didn't buy the ($21) super ticket but bought everything included on it and still saved $2, then I spent in total $21-$2 = $<<21-2=19>>19
If the regular movie ticket costs $12 and the soda costs $3 then the popcorn would cost $19-$12-$3=$4

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here about movie tickets and figuring out the regular price of popcorn. Let me try to parse through it step by step.

First, the problem says there are two options for buying movie tickets. The first option is a super ticket for $20, which includes the right to watch any movie and also gives you one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. So, if I get the super ticket, it's $20 for the movie ticket plus $1 for the popcorn and soda. Wait, actually, hold on. It says the super ticket includes rights to watch any movie and one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. So, does the $20 include the movie ticket plus the $1 for the combo? Or is the $20 just the movie ticket and the $1 is an extra for the combo?

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra." So, it seems like the $20 super ticket includes the movie ticket plus the $1 for the combo. So, the super ticket is $20, which is the movie price plus $1 for the combo. Alternatively, you can buy a regular movie ticket for $12 and then buy a popcorn and a soda at regular price.

So, the question is: What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?

Alright, so let me break this down.

Let me denote the regular price of a movie ticket as M, the regular price of popcorn as P, and the regular price of a soda as S. The problem states that the soda costs $3, so S = $3.

Option 1: Buy a super ticket for $20, which includes a movie ticket, and one popcorn with a soda for $1 extra. So, does this mean that the total cost is $20, which is M + $1? Or does the $20 include M and the $1 is just for the combo?

Wait, hold on, the wording is confusing. It says: "You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra." So, the super ticket is $20, which includes the movie ticket and the combo (popcorn and soda) for $1 extra. So, does that mean the price is $20 for the movie ticket plus $1 for the combo? Or is the $20 including both the movie ticket and the combo?

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as the super ticket is a package deal. So, for $20, you get the movie ticket and the combo. So, that would mean that the price is $20, which includes M (movie ticket) and P + S (popcorn and soda). But then, it also says you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. So, is the $20 equal to M + (P + S) where (P + S) is $1? That can't be, because if P + S is $1, then M is $19, but the other option is $12 for the movie ticket plus P + S. But let me clarify.

Wait, perhaps the super ticket is $20, which includes the movie ticket and the combo for $1 extra. So, the movie ticket is cheaper when you buy the super ticket. Wait, no, the wording says "you can buy a movie super ticket..." So perhaps the super ticket is a different product.

Wait, the problem is a bit unclear, but let me try to figure it out.

First, let's write down what we know:

- Super ticket: $20, includes movie ticket and one popcorn with soda for $1 extra.

- Regular ticket: $12, plus buy popcorn and soda at regular price.

- Soda is $3.

- If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2.

So, "you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2." So, by not buying the super ticket, you saved $2 compared to what you would have spent if you had bought the super ticket.

Wait, that might be a different interpretation. Let me think.

Alternatively, if you didn't buy the super ticket, you bought the regular ticket for $12 and bought popcorn and soda at regular price, but instead, if you had bought the super ticket, you would have spent $20, but since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, that means you would have spent $2 more if you had bought the super ticket.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should define the variables first.

Let me define:

Let M = regular price of a movie ticket.

Let P = regular price of popcorn.

Let S = regular price of soda, which is $3.

Now, let's look at the two options:

1. Super ticket: $20, which includes the movie ticket and one popcorn with a soda. The problem says you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. So, does that mean that the combo is $1 extra on top of the movie ticket? Or is the total price $20?

Wait, if it's $20 for the super ticket that includes the movie ticket and the combo, then the total cost is $20, which is M + P + S.

But it also says "you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra." So, perhaps the super ticket is just the movie ticket plus $1 for the combo. So, M + 1 = $20. That would make M = $19, but that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the super ticket is M plus P + S = $20, and the combo is P + S = $1 extra. So, the combo is $1 extra, meaning P + S = $1? But that doesn't make sense because S is $3.

Wait, now I'm getting confused. Let me read the problem again:

"You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price."

So, the super ticket is $20, which gives you the movie rights and one combo (popcorn and soda) for only $1 extra. So, perhaps the combo is $1 extra on top of the movie ticket.

So, if the combo is $1 extra, then the total for the super ticket is M + 1 = $20. So, M = $19.

Alternatively, if the super ticket includes the combo for $1 extra, meaning the combo is $1, so M + 1 = $20, so M = $19.

But then, the other option is to buy a regular ticket for $12 and buy the combo at regular price, which is P + S.

So, if M = $19, then buying the regular ticket and combo would cost $12 + P + S. But we know S = $3, so it would be $12 + P + $3 = $15 + P.

But the problem says that if you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2. So, saving $2 by not buying the super ticket. That is, buying the regular ticket and combo instead of the super ticket saved you $2. So, the cost of the regular ticket and combo is $2 less than the super ticket.

So, in equation form:

Cost of regular ticket + combo = Cost of super ticket - $2

Which is:

$12 + P + S = $20 - $2

We know S = $3, so:

$12 + P + $3 = $18

Simplify:

$15 + P = $18

So, subtract $15 from both sides:

P = $18 - $15 = $3

Wait, so the regular price of popcorn is $3? But the soda is also $3. That seems a bit odd, but mathematically, it works.

Wait, but let me verify.

If regular ticket is $12, and you buy a combo (popcorn and soda) at regular price, which is P + S = $3 + $3 = $6.

So, total cost is $12 + $6 = $18.

If instead, you bought the super ticket for $20, you would have spent $20, but by buying the regular ticket and combo, you only spent $18. So, you saved $2. That matches the problem statement.

But wait, earlier I thought that M = $19. But in that case, the regular movie ticket is $12, so you saved $7 on the movie ticket by not buying the super one. But the problem says you saved $2 in total. Hmm, that contradicts.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in defining the variables.

Let me try again.

Let me think in terms of total cost if I didn't buy the super ticket: I bought a regular ticket for $12 and bought a combo (popcorn + soda) at regular price (P + S).

Total cost without super ticket: $12 + P + S.

Total cost with super ticket: $20.

But the problem says you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2. That means that buying the regular ticket and combo cost you $2 less than buying the super ticket.

So:

Total cost without super ticket = Total cost with super ticket - $2

So:

$12 + P + S = $20 - $2

Which is:

$12 + P + $3 = $18

So, $15 + P = $18

Therefore, P = $3

So, the regular price of popcorn is $3.

Wait, but is that right? Because if the regular price of a soda is $3, and the regular price of popcorn is also $3, that seems a bit expensive, but it's possible.

Let me verify the total costs:

- Super ticket: $20

- Regular ticket + combo: $12 + $3 + $3 = $18

So, $20 - $18 = $2. So, yes, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.

But wait, if you didn't buy the super ticket, you could have bought the combo separately, but in the problem, you didn't buy the super ticket, so you bought the regular ticket and the combo at regular price. So, you spent $12 + $3 + $3 = $18, which is $2 less than $20.

So, that seems to check out.

But hold on, earlier I thought that the super ticket was M + $1, where M is the movie ticket, but that might not be the case.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the super ticket is M + (P + S) = $20, and the combo is P + S = $1 extra.

Wait, the problem says "you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra." So, maybe the combo is $1 extra on top of the movie ticket.

So, if the combo is $1 extra, then the total cost is M + 1 = $20, so M = $19.

But then, if you bought a regular ticket for $12 and bought the combo at regular price, which is P + S, then the total cost would be $12 + P + S.

But if you didn't buy the super ticket, you didn't pay $20, but you could have still bought the combo separately, but in the problem, it's said that you bought a regular ticket and bought the combo at regular price.

So, the total cost is $12 + P + S.

But the problem says that by not buying the super ticket, you saved $2. So, how does that relate?

Wait, perhaps the saving is the difference between the super ticket and the regular ticket plus combo.

So, if you bought the super ticket for $20, and instead you bought a regular ticket for $12 and combo for P + S, then the saving would be $20 - ($12 + P + S) = $2.

So, $20 - $12 - P - S = $2

Which simplifies to:

$8 - P - S = $2

Then, -P - S = $2 - $8

-P - S = -$6

Multiply both sides by -1:

P + S = $6

We know that S = $3, so P = $6 - $3 = $3.

So, again, P = $3.

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is $3.

But then, earlier, if M = $19, but the problem didn't mention anything about saving on the movie ticket. It only mentions saving $2 in total by not buying the super ticket.

So, maybe my initial thought that M = $19 is not necessary here. The problem is only about the saving of $2 when choosing the regular ticket and combo over the super ticket.

So, regardless of the movie ticket price, the saving comes from the difference between the super ticket and the regular ticket plus combo.

So, in that case, the saving is $20 - ($12 + P + S) = $2, which gives P = $3.

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is $3.

But let me just make sure. If the regular ticket is $12, and the combo is $6 (since P = $3 and S = $3), then total is $18, which is $2 less than $20. So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is $3.

Wait, but the problem said that the soda costs $3, so the combo is $6, which is $3 for soda and $3 for popcorn. So, that seems consistent.

Hmm, okay, I think that makes sense. So, the answer is $3.

**Final Answer**
The regular price of popcorn is \boxed{3} dollars.
</think>

First, we define the variables:
- \( M \) is the regular price of a movie ticket.
- \( P \) is the regular price of popcorn.
- \( S \) is the regular price of a soda, which is given as $3.

We know the following options:
1. A super ticket costs $20, which includes a movie ticket and one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra.
2. A regular ticket costs $12, and you can buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price.

The problem states that if you didn't buy the super ticket, you saved $2. This means the total cost of buying a regular ticket and a combo (popcorn and soda) is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket.

We set up the equation for the total cost without the super ticket:
\[ 12 + P + S = 20 - 2 \]

Substituting the known value of \( S \):
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 18 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 15 + P = 18 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = 18 - 15 \]
\[ P = 3 \]

Thus, the regular price of popcorn is \(\boxed{3}\) dollars.
