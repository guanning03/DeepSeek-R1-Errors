Question:
Imma has 3 cats. She feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. How many days will 720 grams of cat food last?

Correct Answer:
The 3 cats consume 60 grams/cat x 3 cats = <<60*3=180>>180 grams of food per meal.
Since they eat twice a day, then they consume 180 grams/meal x 2 meals/day = <<180*2=360>>360 grams in a day.
So, 720 grams of cat food only last for 720 grams / 360 grams/day = <<720/360=2>>2 days.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I've got this problem here: Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds them twice a day with a total of 60 grams of cat food. The question is asking how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out how much cat food Imma uses each day. She feeds her cats twice a day, and each feeding is 60 grams. Wait, hold on, is that 60 grams in total each feeding or 60 grams per feeding? Hmm, the problem says "twice a day with 60 grams." So, I think that means she feeds them a total of 60 grams each day, but twice. So each feeding must be 30 grams? Because 60 divided by 2 is 30. So, each time she feeds her cats, it's 30 grams.

But wait, actually, let me re-read the problem to make sure I got that right. It says, "She feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food." So, that could be interpreted in two ways. Either she feeds them twice a day, each time giving 60 grams, which would be a total of 120 grams per day. Or, she feeds them twice a day, totaling 60 grams, so each feeding is 30 grams.

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous, but usually, when it says "with 60 grams," that's the total amount per day. So, it might be 60 grams in total, regardless of how many times she feeds them. So, if it's 60 grams in total per day, then 720 grams would last for 12 days because 720 divided by 60 is 12. But wait, hold on, she feeds them twice a day. So, does that mean she's using 60 grams per day, or 60 grams each time?

I think the key here is that it says she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams. So, in total, she uses 60 grams each day, regardless of the number of feedings. So, each feeding would be 30 grams. Hmm, now I'm confused because both interpretations could make sense.

Wait, let me think about it again. If she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams total, then each feeding is 30 grams. So, each time she feeds, she uses 30 grams. Therefore, in one day, she uses 60 grams. So, 720 grams divided by 60 grams per day is 12 days. Alternatively, if she uses 60 grams each feeding, that would be 120 grams per day, and then 720 divided by 120 is 6 days.

So, the problem is ambiguous in terms of interpretation. But in most cases, when it says "feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams," it usually means that in total, she uses 60 grams each day, split into two feedings. So, each feeding is 30 grams. That makes sense because it's more efficient to split the feeding into multiple times a day.

But to be thorough, let's consider both scenarios.

First scenario: Each feeding is 30 grams, so total daily usage is 60 grams. So, 720 divided by 60 is 12 days.

Second scenario: Each feeding is 60 grams, so total daily usage is 120 grams. Then, 720 divided by 120 is 6 days.

So, which one is correct? Hmm. The problem says she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams. So, does that mean 60 grams in total each day or 60 grams each feeding? The wording is a bit unclear. Let's look at how it's phrased: "feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food." So, if she feeds twice a day, each feeding is 60 grams, that seems like a lot because 60 grams times 2 is 120 grams per day. Alternatively, she feeds twice a day with 60 grams in total.

I think it's more likely that she feeds them twice a day with a total of 60 grams, so each feeding is 30 grams. Because 60 grams per feeding twice a day seems excessive for three cats. So, 30 grams per feeding sounds more reasonable.

But to be absolutely sure, let's try both calculations and see which one makes sense.

First, let's assume each feeding is 30 grams. So, 30 grams times 2 feedings is 60 grams per day. Then, 720 divided by 60 is 12 days. So, 12 days.

Alternatively, if each feeding is 60 grams, then 60 times 2 is 120 grams per day. Then, 720 divided by 120 is 6 days.

So, which interpretation is correct? The problem is a bit ambiguous, but I think the standard interpretation would be that she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams in total. So, that would be 30 grams per feeding.

Alternatively, if it was meant to say she feeds them twice a day each with 60 grams, it would probably say she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each, totaling 120 grams per day.

Hmm, so in the original problem, it says, "feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food." The word "with" might imply that each feeding is 60 grams. So, that would mean 60 grams per feeding, twice a day, totaling 120 grams per day.

Wait, now I'm overcomplicating it because "feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams" could mean that she uses 60 grams each day, regardless of the number of feedings. So, that would mean 30 grams per feeding.

But in common language, when someone says "feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams," it usually means that each feeding is 30 grams. So, 60 grams in total each day, split into two feedings.

So, maybe 12 days is the answer.

Wait, but let me think about the units. If she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams, that implies that the 60 grams is the total amount used per day, regardless of the number of feedings. So, 60 grams per day, so 720 grams divided by 60 grams per day is 12 days.

But if she uses 60 grams each feeding, then that's 60 grams twice a day, so 120 grams per day, so 720 divided by 120 is 6 days.

So, in that case, the answer is either 12 or 6, depending on the interpretation.

But in the problem statement, it's written as "feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams." So, it's more likely that the 60 grams is the total per day, so 60 grams over two feedings.

Therefore, the daily usage is 60 grams, so 720 divided by 60 is 12 days.

But just to double-check, let's see. If it was meant to say 60 grams each feeding, it might have said "feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams each feeding" or something like that. So, without specifying "each," it's more likely that 60 grams is the total daily amount.

So, 60 grams per day, 720 grams divided by 60 is 12 days.

Therefore, I think 12 days is the correct answer.

But, to be thorough, let's go through both interpretations.

First interpretation: 60 grams total per day, so 60 grams / day.

Second interpretation: 60 grams each feeding, so 60 grams x 2 feedings = 120 grams per day.

So, let's do both calculations.

First, 720 grams divided by 60 grams per day is 12 days.

Second, 720 grams divided by 120 grams per day is 6 days.

So, depending on the interpretation, it's either 12 days or 6 days.

But, given the phrasing, I think it's more likely that 60 grams is the total per day.

But, just to make sure, let's try to see how the problem is structured. It says, "Imma has 3 cats. She feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food." So, the 60 grams is the total she uses each day, regardless of how many times she feeds them. So, that would make sense.

So, if she feeds them twice a day, but only uses 60 grams in total, so each feeding is 30 grams.

Therefore, 30 grams per feeding times 2 feedings is 60 grams per day.

So, 720 divided by 60 is 12 days.

Therefore, the answer is 12 days.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose she feeds them twice a day, each time with 60 grams, that would be 120 grams per day, which is a lot. 60 grams per feeding for three cats seems excessive because 60 grams is a lot for three cats to eat in one feeding. So, 30 grams per feeding is more reasonable.

So, 30 grams per feeding times 2 feedings is 60 grams per day. So, 720 divided by 60 is 12 days.

So, yeah, 12 days seems right.

Therefore, I think the answer is 12 days.

**Final Answer**
The 720 grams of cat food will last \boxed{12} days.
</think>

Imma has 3 cats and feeds them twice a day with a total of 60 grams of cat food. To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to figure out the daily cat food consumption.

First, we interpret the problem as feeding twice a day with a total of 60 grams, which means each feeding is 30 grams. Therefore, the total daily consumption is 60 grams.

Next, we calculate how many days 720 grams of cat food will last by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[
\frac{720 \text{ grams}}{60 \text{ grams/day}} = 12 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the 720 grams of cat food will last \boxed{12} days.
