Question:
A bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning and half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. How many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon?

Correct Answer:
60 x 2/3 = <<60*2/3=40>>40 loaves of bread are sold in the morning.
60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon and evening.
Therefore, 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.
#### 10

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon at this bakery. Let me start by reading the problem again carefully to make sure I understand all the details.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. Then, half of what is left after the morning sales is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. I need to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I know the total number of loaves produced each day is 60. So, the bakery makes 60 loaves daily.

Next, it says two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. So, let me calculate how many that is. If two-thirds of 60 are sold in the morning, I can write that as (2/3) * 60. Let me compute that.

(2/3) * 60 = (2 * 60)/3 = 120/3 = 40. So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning.

Now, if 40 loaves are sold in the morning, how many are left? The total is 60, so subtracting the morning sales, we have 60 - 40 = 20 loaves remaining after the morning.

The problem then states that half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, first, let me find out what half of the remaining 20 loaves is.

Half of 20 is (1/2) * 20 = 10. So, 10 loaves are sold in the afternoon and another 10 in the evening.

Wait, hold on, let me verify that. Is half of the remaining loaves sold in the afternoon and the other half in the evening? The problem says, "half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening," so that would mean each part gets half of the half, which is a quarter of the original remainder? Hmm, no, that might not be correct.

Wait, no, the wording is important here. It says half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the remaining 20 loaves have half of them sold, which is 10, and that 10 is split equally between afternoon and evening. So, that would mean 5 loaves are sold in the afternoon and 5 in the evening? Wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me parse the sentence again: "half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening." So, half of the remaining 20 is sold in the afternoon and the other half is sold in the evening. That would mean 10 loaves in the afternoon and 10 in the evening. That makes more sense.

I think I misinterpreted it earlier when I thought only half was sold, with the other half maybe being unsold. But no, the problem says half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, 10 loaves are sold in the afternoon and 10 in the evening. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total loaves: 60

Morning sales: 2/3 of 60 = 40.

Remaining after morning: 60 - 40 = 20.

Half of the remaining is 10. That 10 is split equally between afternoon and evening. So, 10 divided by 2 is 5. Wait, hold on, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.

Wait, now I'm confused. Is it that half of the remaining is sold in both afternoon and evening, each getting half of that half? Or is half of the remaining sold in the afternoon and the other half in the evening?

The problem says, "half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening." So, the total sold during the afternoon and evening is half of what's left. Then, that amount is split equally between the two times.

So, half of 20 is 10. Then, 10 is sold in the afternoon and 10 in the evening? Or is it that each of afternoon and evening gets half of the 10?

Wait, the problem says, "half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening." So, the half is split equally between afternoon and evening. So, 10 is split equally, meaning 5 and 5. So, 5 sold in the afternoon and 5 in the evening.

Wait, so is that correct? Let me think about the wording again. "half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening." So, the half is 10, and it's sold equally in both afternoon and evening. So, each gets half of that 10, which is 5.

But some people might interpret it as half of what's left is sold in the afternoon, and then the remaining half is sold in the evening. But the wording says "half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening," which seems to indicate that the same amount is sold in both times, each being half of the half.

So, yes, I think it's 5 loaves in the afternoon and 5 in the evening.

Wait, but let me read the problem again precisely:

"A bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning and half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. How many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon?"

So, the key is "half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening." So, half of 20 is 10. And this 10 is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, 10 divided by 2 is 5. Therefore, 5 loaves in the afternoon.

But earlier, I thought 10 loaves were sold, 5 each. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the wording again. If you have X left, and you sell half of X equally in two periods, then each period gets X/2, so 5 each. Alternatively, if you have half of X sold in the afternoon, and the other half in the evening, that would also be 5 each.

Wait, no, if half of X is sold equally, that would mean each gets half of that half, which is X/4.

Wait, no, now I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's model it with variables.

Let total loaves = 60.

Morning sales = (2/3)*60 = 40.

Remaining = 60 - 40 = 20.

Half of remaining is (1/2)*20 = 10.

So, half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening.

So, "half of what is left" is 10, and this is sold equally in the afternoon and evening, meaning 10 is split equally. So, 10 / 2 = 5 in the afternoon and 5 in the evening.

So, the number sold in the afternoon is 5.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my initial thought where I thought 10 were sold in the afternoon and 10 in the evening, which would make 20 total sold after morning, which makes total sold 60.

Wait, no, hold on. If morning is 40, and then afternoon and evening together are 10, then total sold is 50, but the bakery produces 60. So, that's not correct.

Wait, no. Wait, if half of what is left after morning is sold in afternoon and evening, so half of 20 is 10, so 10 is sold in total during afternoon and evening, split equally. So, 5 each.

Thus, total sold is 40 + 10 = 50, which is less than 60. So, 10 are left unsold.

Wait, but the problem didn't mention anything about leftover bread or discarding. So, maybe the remaining 10 are left unsold? Hmm.

But the problem is only asking for the number sold in the afternoon, which is 5. So, that might be the answer.

But let me check again. Maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, original problem: "Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning and half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening."

So, two-thirds sold in the morning: 40.

Half of what is left (so half of 20) is sold equally in the afternoon and evening: so 10 is sold in total, 5 each.

Thus, 5 in the afternoon.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that half of what is left is sold in the afternoon and the other half is sold in the evening. So, 10 in the afternoon and 10 in the evening, but that would mean 40 + 10 + 10 = 60, so all loaves are sold.

But the problem says "half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening." So, that phrasing suggests that the same amount is sold in the afternoon as in the evening, but not that each is half of the half.

Wait, maybe "half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening" can be interpreted as half in the afternoon and half in the evening, each of the same amount.

So, that would mean half of 20 is 10, and that 10 is split equally between afternoon and evening, so 5 each.

Alternatively, perhaps half of what is left is sold in the afternoon, and half of what is left is sold in the evening, which would be 10 each, totaling 20 sold in the afternoon and evening, and leaving 20 unsold.

But the problem says "half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening." So, "half of what is left" is 10, and this 10 is sold in both the afternoon and evening equally. So, 10 / 2 = 5 each.

Therefore, 5 sold in the afternoon.

Wait, now I'm not so sure. Maybe it's 10 sold in the afternoon and 10 in the evening, totaling 20, which is half of the remaining 20. So, 40 sold in the morning, 20 in the afternoon and evening, 10 each.

But the problem says half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, half of 20 is 10, and that 10 is split equally. So, 5 and 5.

But I think this is a point of ambiguity in the problem's wording.

Wait, perhaps the problem is written such that half of what is left is sold in the afternoon and the other half in the evening, but the word "equally" might just mean that the same amount is sold in both periods, not necessarily that each is half of the remaining.

So, for example, if half of what is left is sold in the afternoon and the same amount is sold in the evening, that would mean total sold in the afternoon and evening is half of what is left, and each gets half of that. So, 10 total, 5 each.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that half of the remaining is sold in the afternoon and the other half in the evening, meaning 10 in each.

But perhaps I should consider both interpretations.

Wait, let me think about how it's phrased. It says, "half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening." So, the half is split equally between the two periods.

So, the half is 10, split equally, so 5 each. So, 5 in the afternoon, 5 in the evening.

Thus, the answer would be 5.

But let me try to compute it another way.

Total loaves: 60

Morning sales: 2/3 * 60 = 40

Remaining: 20

So, half of remaining is 10. So, half is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, 10 is split equally, so 5 each.

Therefore, afternoon sales: 5.

Alternatively, if it's half of remaining sold in the afternoon and half in the evening, meaning 10 each, but that doesn't match the wording.

Wait, unless "half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening," meaning that each of the two periods gets half of the half. So, 10 is the total from the half, and that's split equally, so 5 each.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is 5.

But to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations.

First interpretation:

- Total loaves: 60

- Morning: 40

- Remaining: 20

- Half of remaining (10) is sold equally in the afternoon and evening: 5 each.

Total sold: 40 + 5 + 5 = 50. So, 10 are left.

Second interpretation:

- Total loaves: 60

- Morning: 40

- Remaining: 20

- Half of remaining (10) is sold in the afternoon, and half in the evening: 10 each.

Total sold: 40 + 10 + 10 = 60. So, none left.

But the problem didn't mention anything about leftover bread, so maybe the second interpretation is correct.

Wait, but the wording says "half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening." So, the "half of what is left" is 10. Then, this 10 is sold equally in the afternoon and evening, meaning 5 each.

Therefore, I think the first interpretation is correct, resulting in 5 loaves sold in the afternoon.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that half of what is left is sold in the afternoon, and the other half is sold in the evening, meaning 10 each.

But in that case, the wording would probably say "half of what is left is sold in the afternoon and the other half in the evening."

But it says "half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening." So, "equally" suggests that the same amount is sold in each, implying that the 10 is split equally, so 5 each.

Therefore, I think the answer is 5.

Wait, hold on, let me try to write down the equations to clarify.

Let total = 60.

Morning sales: (2/3) * total = 40.

Remaining: total - morning sales = 20.

Half of remaining: (1/2)*20 = 10.

This 10 is sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so afternoon sales = evening sales = 10 / 2 = 5.

Therefore, the number sold in the afternoon is 5.

Yes, that seems consistent. So, 5 is the answer.

Therefore, I think the answer is 5.

**Final Answer**
The number of loaves sold in the afternoon is \boxed{5}.
</think>

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, and half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. We need to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon.

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
   \[
   \text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
   \]

2. Determine the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   \[
   \text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20
   \]

3. Calculate half of the remaining loaves:
   \[
   \text{Half of remaining} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

4. Since half of the remaining loaves is sold equally in the afternoon and evening, divide this amount by 2:
   \[
   \text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]

Thus, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is \boxed{5}.
