Tokens: 966.0

Question:
Morgan's dad said that she had $90 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is $5. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?

Correct Answer:
The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20
Each person costs $30 because 5 + 5 + 20 = <<5+5+20=30>>30
Three total people can attend because 90 / 30 = <<90/30=3>>3
She can invite 2 friends because 3 - 1 =<<3-1=2>>2

Wrong Answer:
Okay, let's try to figure out how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party. Hmm, she has a total budget of $90. She wants to make sure everyone, including herself, can play mini-golf once, have some arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. 

First, I need to break down the costs. Let me note down the expenses:

1. **Mini-golf**: Each round costs $5. Since she wants everyone, including herself, to play once, that's one round per person. So if she invites 'n' friends, the total number of people will be n + 1 (herself plus n friends). Therefore, the cost for mini-golf will be 5*(n + 1).

2. **Arcade Tokens**: She wants everyone to have $5 in tokens. Again, that's $5 per person for the number of people, which is n + 1. So the cost for tokens will be 5*(n + 1).

3. **Go-Karts**: Each ride costs $10, and she wants to ride twice. So regardless of the number of people, she needs two rides. Therefore, the total cost for go-karts is 2*10 = $20.

Now, let's sum up all these costs and set it equal to her total budget of $90.

So, the equation would be:

Cost of Mini-golf + Cost of Arcade Tokens + Cost of Go-Karts = Total Budget

Plugging in the values:

5*(n + 1) + 5*(n + 1) + 20 = 90

Let me simplify this equation step by step.

First, combine the costs for mini-golf and arcade tokens. Both are 5*(n + 1), so together that's 2*5*(n + 1) = 10*(n + 1).

So now, the equation becomes:

10*(n + 1) + 20 = 90

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with 'n':

10*(n + 1) = 70

Now, divide both sides by 10:

n + 1 = 7

Subtract 1 from both sides:

n = 6

So, that suggests she can invite 6 friends.

Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Total cost for mini-golf: 5*(6 + 1) = 5*7 = $35
Total cost for tokens: 5*(6 + 1) = $35
Total cost for go-karts: $20
Adding them up: 35 + 35 + 20 = $90

Yeah, that adds up to exactly her budget. So, 6 friends is correct.

I think that's solid. She can invite 6 friends.

**Final Answer**
Morgan can invite \boxed{6} friends.

Morgan has a total budget of $90 for her birthday party. She wants to ensure that she and her friends can play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. 

First, we calculate the cost for mini-golf, which is $5 per person. If she invites \( n \) friends, the total number of people will be \( n + 1 \). Therefore, the cost for mini-golf is \( 5(n + 1) \).

Next, the cost for arcade tokens is $5 per person, so the total cost for tokens is also \( 5(n + 1) \).

The cost for go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so the total cost for go-karts is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) dollars.

We set up the equation for the total budget:

\[
5(n + 1) + 5(n + 1) + 20 = 90
\]

Combining the costs for mini-golf and tokens, we get:

\[
10(n + 1) + 20 = 90
\]

Subtracting 20 from both sides:

\[
10(n + 1) = 70
\]

Dividing both sides by 10:

\[
n + 1 = 7
\]

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[
n = 6
\]

Thus, Morgan can invite \boxed{6} friends.
