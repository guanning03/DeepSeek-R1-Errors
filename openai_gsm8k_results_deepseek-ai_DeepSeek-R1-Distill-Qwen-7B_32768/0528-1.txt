Question:
It takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book before he goes to bed. He reads 18 pages of his book and then decides to go to sleep. How long does James spend reading, in minutes?

Correct Answer:
James would take 18 รท 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 times longer if he read all 18 pages.
This means James would spend 6 ร 10 = <<6*10=60>>60 minutes reading.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: James takes 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book before he goes to bed. Then he reads 18 pages and decides to go to sleep. The question is, how long does James spend reading in total, in minutes? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out the reading rate of James. The problem says he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. So, maybe I can calculate how long it takes him to read one page and then multiply that by the total number of pages he read, which is 18. That should give me the total time he spent reading.

Let me write that down. If 3 pages take 10 minutes, then one page would take 10 minutes divided by 3 pages. So, that's 10/3 minutes per page. Okay, that makes sense. So, 10 divided by 3 is approximately 3.333 minutes per page. But I don't know if I need to round that or if I should keep it as a fraction for more precise calculation.

So, if one page takes 10/3 minutes, then 18 pages would take 18 multiplied by 10/3 minutes. Let me calculate that. 18 times 10 is 180, and then divided by 3 is 60. So, 60 minutes. Wait, that seems straightforward. So, 18 pages would take 60 minutes.

But hold on, let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. It's kind of a straightforward rate problem. So, the rate is pages per minute or minutes per page. I think I did it right by finding minutes per page first.

Alternatively, I could set up a proportion to solve it. If 3 pages correspond to 10 minutes, then 18 pages correspond to x minutes. So, the proportion would be 3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes. Then, cross-multiplying, 3x = 10 * 18. Let's see, 10 times 18 is 180, so 3x = 180. Then, x = 180 / 3, which is 60. So, x is 60 minutes. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is 60 minutes. That seems solid.

Wait a second, but let me think about the first part again. It says he reads 3 pages before he goes to bed, and then he reads 18 pages and decides to go to sleep. So, does that mean the initial 10 minutes are separate from the 18 pages? Or is it 3 pages before bed and then 18 pages, making a total of 21 pages?

Wait, the problem says he reads 18 pages and then decides to go to sleep. So, does that 18 pages include the initial 3 pages? Hmm, that part is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original question again.

"James takes 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book before he goes to bed. He reads 18 pages of his book and then decides to go to sleep. How long does James spend reading, in minutes?"

Hmm. So, first, he takes 10 minutes to read 3 pages before bed. Then, after that, he reads 18 pages and decides to go to sleep. So, does the 18 pages include those initial 3 pages, or is it in addition to that?

That's a critical point. If the 18 pages include the initial 3 pages, then he's actually reading 18 pages in total, which would be different from the 3 pages. But the way it's phrased, he first takes 10 minutes to read 3 pages before bed, and then separately reads 18 pages and goes to sleep. So, I think it's safe to assume that he read 3 pages before bed, and then after, he read another 18 pages, making a total of 21 pages.

But wait, the problem is asking how long he spends reading in total. So, he spent 10 minutes reading 3 pages before bed, and then he read 18 pages, which we just calculated as 60 minutes. So, adding those together, 10 minutes plus 60 minutes is 70 minutes. Therefore, James spends 70 minutes reading in total.

But hold on, wait, no, that can't be right because the problem says "He reads 18 pages of his book and then decides to go to sleep." So, maybe the 18 pages include the initial 3 pages? Or does it mean that after reading the initial 3 pages to go to bed, he reads 18 more pages?

Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me parse the sentence again. "James takes 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book before he goes to bed. He reads 18 pages of his book and then decides to go to sleep." So, first, he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, then he reads another 18 pages. So, the total pages he read would be 21, and the total time would be 10 minutes plus 60 minutes, which is 70 minutes.

But if the 18 pages include the initial 3 pages, then it's reading 18 pages in total, which would be 60 minutes. So, the initial 10 minutes is separate.

Wait, the way it's written is a bit ambiguous. The first sentence is about reading 3 pages before going to bed, and the second sentence is about reading 18 pages and then going to sleep.

So, if he goes to bed after reading 3 pages, and then later he reads 18 pages and goes to sleep, so the two instances of going to sleep are separate. Therefore, the total reading time is 10 minutes plus 60 minutes, which is 70 minutes.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems can trip you up with the phrasing. Let me try to rephrase it.

First: He reads 3 pages, takes 10 minutes, then goes to bed.

Second: He reads 18 pages, takes an unknown time, then goes to sleep.

Wait, no, the problem says he reads 18 pages and then decides to go to sleep. So, maybe the total reading time is 10 minutes plus the time it takes him to read 18 pages. So, in that case, if 3 pages take 10 minutes, then 18 pages take 60 minutes, so total time is 70 minutes.

Alternatively, perhaps the 18 pages include the initial 3 pages, so he's reading 18 pages in total, taking 60 minutes, and then he goes to sleep. But then, why mention the 10 minutes? That seems unnecessary.

Hmm, so maybe the problem is structured such that he first read 3 pages in 10 minutes, then read 18 pages, which took him 60 minutes, and then he went to sleep. So, the total reading time is 10 + 60 = 70 minutes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just telling us that he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, and then 18 pages, but not necessarily that these are separate. So, perhaps the 18 pages include the initial 3, but that might not make much sense because reading 3 pages before bed, and then 18 pages after, so maybe the total pages are 21.

But the question is only asking how long he spends reading, not how many pages. So, he spends 10 minutes on the first part and then spends 60 minutes on the second part. So, in total, 70 minutes.

Wait, but let me think again. If he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, that's a rate of 3 pages per 10 minutes or 10 minutes per 3 pages. So, if he reads 18 pages, that's 18 divided by 3, which is 6 sets of 3 pages, each taking 10 minutes. So, 6 times 10 minutes is 60 minutes.

So, he spends 10 minutes on the first part and 60 minutes on the second part, totaling 70 minutes. So, that's the answer.

But just to make sure, let's think about whether the units make sense. 3 pages per 10 minutes is the same as 10 minutes per 3 pages. So, pages per minute would be 3/10 pages per minute, and minutes per page would be 10/3 minutes per page.

So, if he reads 18 pages, then minutes per page times pages is minutes. So, 10/3 * 18 = (10*18)/3 = 180/3 = 60 minutes. So, that's consistent.

So, 10 minutes for the first part and 60 minutes for the second part, so total of 70 minutes.

Wait, but hold on, is the initial 10 minutes part of the total reading time? Or is the question just asking how long he spends reading, regardless of when it happens.

So, he goes to bed after reading 3 pages, which took 10 minutes, and then later reads another 18 pages, which took him 60 minutes, and then he goes to sleep. So, the total time he spent reading is 10 + 60 = 70 minutes.

Yes, that seems right.

Alternatively, if the 18 pages are read before bed, but that would contradict the first part where he already read 3 pages before bed. So, it's more likely that he read 3 pages before bed, then read another 18 pages after, so the total is 70 minutes.

Therefore, I think the answer is 70 minutes.

**Final Answer**
James spends a total of \boxed{70} minutes reading.
</think>

James reads 3 pages of his book in 10 minutes. To find out how long he spends reading 18 pages, we first determine his reading rate. 

If 3 pages take 10 minutes, then the time taken to read 18 pages can be calculated using a proportion:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
3x = 10 \times 18
\]

\[
3x = 180
\]

\[
x = \frac{180}{3} = 60
\]

So, it takes James 60 minutes to read 18 pages. 

Additionally, he already spent 10 minutes reading 3 pages before bed. Therefore, the total time he spends reading is:

\[
10 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time James spends reading is \boxed{70} minutes.
