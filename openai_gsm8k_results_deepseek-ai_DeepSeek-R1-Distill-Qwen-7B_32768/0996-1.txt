Question:
A company decided to take its employees on a tour to explore an ancient site. The employees were divided into 3 groups of 200 employees. Each group was assigned 7 tour guides. How many is the total number of people going on this tour?

Correct Answer:
The number of employees is 3 groups * 200 employees/group = <<3*200=600>>600 employees.
The number of tour guides is 3 groups * 7 guides/group = <<3*7=21>>21 guides.
The total number of people going on this tour is 600 employees + 21 guides = <<600+21=621>>621 people.
#### 621

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here where a company is taking its employees on a tour to an ancient site. The employees are divided into 3 groups, each consisting of 200 people. Each group is assigned 7 tour guides. The question is asking for the total number of people going on this tour. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many employees there are in total. It says they're divided into 3 groups, each with 200 employees. So, if each group has 200 people, and there are 3 groups, I can calculate the total number by multiplying 200 by 3. Let me do that: 200 multiplied by 3 is 600. So, there are 600 employees in total.

Now, the problem also mentions that each group is assigned 7 tour guides. But wait, the question is about the total number of people going on the tour. So, do I need to consider the tour guides in the total count? Hmm, the question says "the total number of people going on this tour," so I think it's referring only to the employees, not the guides. Because the guides are presumably helping the employees, not going on the tour themselves.

Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. If each group has 7 tour guides, does that mean those guides are part of the tour? Or are they separate? The question specifies "the total number of people going on this tour," so probably just the employees. The tour guides are assisting, so they might not be counted as going on the tour. Although, sometimes in problems, people can be confused whether the guides are part of the group. But in this case, the question is clear about it being the total number of people, so I think it's just the employees.

So, if each group has 200 employees, and there are 3 groups, then 200 multiplied by 3 is 600. Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is 600.

Just to double-check, let me consider if there's another way to interpret this. If the 7 tour guides per group are considered as part of the people going on the tour, then I would add the number of guides to the number of employees. But since the problem specifies "the total number of people going on this tour," I think it's just referring to the employees. The guides are probably just people who are helping, not actually participants in the tour as attendees.

Therefore, I can confidently say that the total number of people going on the tour is 600.

**Final Answer**
The total number of people going on the tour is \boxed{600}.
</think>

The company has divided its employees into 3 groups, each consisting of 200 employees. To find the total number of employees, we multiply the number of groups by the number of employees per group:

\[
3 \text{ groups} \times 200 \text{ employees per group} = 600 \text{ employees}
\]

The problem specifies the total number of people going on the tour, which refers only to the employees. Therefore, the tour guides are not included in this count.

\[
\boxed{600}
\]
