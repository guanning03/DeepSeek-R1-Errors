Question:
Richard wants to make a video to share online of him doing a science experiment that creates a fountain of diet soda after placing a specific branded candy inside it. Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the driveway. After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?

Correct Answer:
If Richard's driveway is 24 feet long and he puts a bottle of soda every 3 feet, then out of 24 feet total there are 24 / 3 feet between each bottle = <<24/3=8>>8 bottles.
If Richard starts at 0 seconds with the first bottle and it takes him 5 seconds to go onto the next bottle to drop the candy, then it will take him 5 seconds x 7 bottles = 35 seconds total.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so Richard wants to create this video where he does a science experiment with diet soda fountains using some branded candy. He's got his driveway, which is 24 feet wide, and he plans to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet. Then, starting from the first bottle, it takes him 5 seconds to move to each subsequent bottle and drop the candy in. The question is asking how many seconds in total it will take him to set off all the soda fountains. 

Okay, let's break this down step by step. First, we need to figure out how many soda bottles Richard will place along his driveway. Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he's placing a bottle every 3 feet, we can divide 24 by 3 to find the number of intervals between the bottles. 

So, 24 divided by 3 is 8. Hmm, wait, does that mean 8 intervals or 8 bottles? Let me think. If you divide a 24-foot driveway into sections of 3 feet each, how many sections do you get? Well, 3 feet times 8 is 24, so that would create 8 intervals. But in terms of bottles, the number of bottles would be one more than the number of intervals because you start counting from the first bottle at the beginning of the driveway. So, actually, there would be 9 bottles in total. Let me check that: starting at 0 feet, then 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24. Yeah, that's 9 bottles. Okay, so 9 bottles in total.

Now, moving on to the timing. It says after starting at the first bottle, it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. So, the first bottle doesn't take any time; he just starts there. Then, moving from the first to the second takes 5 seconds, second to third another 5 seconds, and so on until he reaches the last bottle.

So, how many movements does he make? Well, if there are 9 bottles, the number of movements between them is 8. Because between 9 bottles, there are 8 gaps. For example, if you have 2 bottles, you only have 1 gap between them. So, with 9 bottles, it's 8 gaps. Each gap takes 5 seconds. So, the total time spent moving and dropping candies would be 8 multiplied by 5 seconds.

Calculating that, 8 times 5 is 40 seconds. So, 40 seconds is the total time he spends moving from one bottle to another and dropping the candy in each.

But hold on, does he start at the first bottle without any time taken? The problem says he starts at the first bottle, so the first bottle doesn't require moving, so we don't count that as a time interval. So, yes, it's 9 bottles, 8 intervals, 8 times 5 seconds, which is 40 seconds. That seems right.

Let me just visualize this to make sure. Imagine the driveway as a straight line: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24. So that's 9 points. Starting at 0, moving to 3 is 5 seconds, then 3 to 6 is another 5 seconds, and so on until he gets to 24. Each of these moves takes 5 seconds, and since there are 8 moves, it's 8 times 5, which is 40 seconds. So, I think that's correct.

Another way to look at it is: if he has 9 bottles, he needs to perform 8 actions of moving and dropping the candy. Each action is 5 seconds, so 8 times 5 is 40. Yeah, that makes sense.

I don't think I missed anything here. The key was realizing that the number of intervals is one less than the number of bottles because you don't have an interval before the first bottle. So, 24 divided by 3 gives 8 intervals, meaning 9 bottles. Then, moving from each bottle to the next takes 5 seconds each time, so 8 movements times 5 seconds is 40 seconds. 

So, the answer should be 40 seconds. I don't think there's any trick or hidden detail in the problem. It's pretty straightforward once you break it down.

**Final Answer**
It will take Richard a total of \boxed{40} seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

Richard wants to create a video where he places a bottle of diet soda every 3 feet along his 24-foot wide driveway. After starting at the first bottle, it takes him 5 seconds to move to each subsequent bottle and drop the candy in. 

First, we determine the number of soda bottles. Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he places a bottle every 3 feet, we divide 24 by 3, which gives 8 intervals. However, since we need to count the number of bottles, we add 1, resulting in 9 bottles.

Next, we calculate the total time taken. Since there are 9 bottles, there are 8 intervals between them. Each interval takes 5 seconds to move and drop the candy. Therefore, the total time is calculated as follows:

\[
8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds per interval} = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \boxed{40} seconds.
