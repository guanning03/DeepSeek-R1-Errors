Question:
A basket of green food costs $25 and a basket of red food costs $18. If you buy 3 baskets of green food and red food, how much will you have to pay in total if you get $2 off for each basket of red food?

Correct Answer:
The 3 baskets of green food will cost $25 x 3 = $<<25*3=75>>75.
The 3 baskets of red food will cost $18 x 3 = $<<18*3=54>>54.
There will be $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6 off for the baskets of red food.
So, the 3 baskets of red food will now cost $54 - $6 = $<<54-6=48>>48.
You will have to pay $75 + $48 = $<<75+48=123>>123 for all the baskets of food.

Wrong Answer:
First, identify the costs of each basket:
- A green basket costs $25.
- A red basket costs $18.

Next, determine the number of baskets purchased:
- 3 baskets in total, with an unspecified number of green and red baskets.

Since the total number of baskets is 3, let's assume there are 2 green baskets and 1 red basket.

Calculate the total cost for green baskets:
2 green baskets × $25 = $50.

Calculate the total cost for red baskets with the discount:
1 red basket × ($18 - $2) = $16.

Finally, add the costs together to find the total amount to be paid:
$50 + $16 = $66.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Cost of a green basket:** \$25
- **Cost of a red basket:** \$18
- **Total baskets purchased:** 3
- **Discount:** \$2 off for each red basket

**Assumption:**
Since the problem doesn't specify how many green and red baskets are bought, we'll assume that you buy 2 green baskets and 1 red basket. (This is a reasonable assumption since the total baskets are 3, and we need at least one red basket to apply the discount.)

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost for green baskets**
\[
\text{Total cost for green baskets} = 2 \times \$25 = \$50
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the discounted cost for red baskets**
\[
\text{Discounted cost per red basket} = \$18 - \$2 = \$16
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for red baskets} = 1 \times \$16 = \$16
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount to be paid**
\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Total cost for green baskets} + \text{Total cost for red baskets} = \$50 + \$16 = \$66
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{66}
\]
