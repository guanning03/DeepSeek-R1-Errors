Question:
Jen decides to travel to 3 different countries.  He has to pay $400 for the supplies he needs, in total.  The tickets for travel cost, in total, 50% more than the supplies.  How much does travel cost?

Correct Answer:
He pays 400*.5=$<<400*.5=200>>200 more for tickets than supplies
That means the tickets cost 400+200=$<<400+200=600>>600
So it cost 600+400=$<<600+400=1000>>1000 in total.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Jen is going to travel to three different countries. He needs some supplies which cost a total of $400. Then there are travel tickets, which cost 50% more than the supplies. Hmm, let me figure out how much the travel tickets will cost.

First, I know that the supplies are $400. The tickets cost 50% more than that. So, I think I need to calculate 50% of $400 and then add that to the original $400 to get the total cost for the tickets.

Let me write that down. 50% of $400 is... Well, 50% is the same as half. So half of $400 is $200. So, 50% of the supplies cost is $200.

Now, if the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, that means the tickets cost the original $400 plus $200. So, adding those together, $400 plus $200 equals $600.

Wait a minute, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Sometimes when I hear "50% more," I might get confused whether it's 50% more than the supplies or 50% more than the total cost. But I think in this case, it's 50% more than the supplies, which are $400. So, tickets would be 1.5 times the supplies.

Let me check that. 1.5 times $400 is the same as $400 plus 50% of $400, which is exactly what I did before. So, 1.5 multiplied by 400. Let me do the multiplication to verify. 1.5 times 400 is 600. Yep, that's correct.

So, the total cost for the travel tickets would be $600. Therefore, Jen has to pay $600 for the travel tickets.

I think that's the answer. To recap, supplies are $400, tickets are 50% more, so 1.5 times 400 is 600. So, travel tickets cost $600.

**Final Answer**
The travel cost is \boxed{600} dollars.

Jen needs to pay $400 for supplies. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. To find the cost of the travel tickets, we calculate 50% of $400 and add it to the original amount.

First, we calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.5 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, we add this amount to the original cost of the supplies:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost for the travel tickets is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]
