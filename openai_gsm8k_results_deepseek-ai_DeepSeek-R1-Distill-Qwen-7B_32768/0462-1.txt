Question:
Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. She painted them and sold them at a craft fair for $8 each. How much profit did she earn on her bags?

Correct Answer:
The total number of bags is 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40
The cost of the 40 bags is 40*4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Tara sold the 40 bags at 8 each earning her 40*8 = <<40*8=320>>320
Her profit was 320-160 = <<320-160=160>>160

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out how much profit Tara earned from selling the canvas bags. Hmm, let me think step by step. 

First, I should probably figure out how much money Tara spent initially. She bought 8 packs, and each pack had 5 canvas bags. So, that means she bought a total of... let me calculate that. 8 packs times 5 bags per pack. 8 times 5 is 40, right? So, she bought 40 canvas bags in total.

Now, each pack cost her $4. So, how much did all the packs cost her altogether? That should be the number of packs times the cost per pack. So that's 8 packs times $4 per pack. Hmm, 8 times 4 is 32. So, Tara spent $32 in total to buy all the canvas bags.

Alright, so her total cost is $32. Now, she sold each canvas bag for $8. But wait, she had 40 bags, right? So, she sold all 40 bags at $8 each. Let me figure out how much money she made from selling them. That would be the number of bags she sold times the selling price per bag. So, 40 bags times $8 per bag. Let me do that multiplication: 40 times 8. Hmm, 4 times 8 is 32, and since there's a zero, it should be 320. So, she made $320 from selling all the bags.

Now, to find the profit, I think profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue, right? So, that would be the money she made minus the money she spent. So, her profit is $320 minus $32. Let me subtract those: 320 minus 32 is 288. So, she earned a profit of $288.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Total number of bags: 8 packs times 5 bags each is indeed 40 bags. Total cost: 8 packs times $4 each is $32. Total revenue: 40 bags times $8 each is $320. Profit is $320 minus $32, which is $288. Hmm, that seems correct.

I think profit is calculated as revenue minus cost. So, yeah, that's exactly what I did here. So, the profit should be $288.

Just to make sure, let me break it down per pack or per bag. If she bought each pack for $4 and sold each bag for $8, how much profit did she make per bag? Well, each bag cost her $4 divided by 5 bags, which is $0.80 per bag. Then, she sold each bag for $8. So, profit per bag is $8 minus $0.80, which is $7.20. Then, she sold 40 bags, so total profit is 40 times $7.20. Let me calculate that: 40 times 7 is 280, and 40 times 0.20 is 8, so 280 plus 8 is 288. Yep, same answer. That confirms it.

So, the profit is $288.

**Final Answer**
Tara earned a profit of \boxed{288} dollars.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, each pack costing $4. 

1. Calculate the total number of canvas bags:
   \[
   8 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ bags per pack} = 40 \text{ bags}
   \]

2. Calculate the total cost for the canvas bags:
   \[
   8 \text{ packs} \times \$4 \text{ per pack} = \$32
   \]

3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags:
   \[
   40 \text{ bags} \times \$8 \text{ per bag} = \$320
   \]

4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
   \[
   \$320 - \$32 = \$288
   \]

Thus, the profit Tara earned is \boxed{288} dollars.
