Question:
Wayne and Bernadette are movie stars heading to the premiere of their latest film. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?

Correct Answer:
Bernadette takes 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes to get to the theater.
Her ride takes 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 minutes longer than Wayne’s to get to the theater.
Thus, she should leave 12 + 5 = <<12+5=17>>17 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater 5 minutes sooner than he does.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this problem here about Wayne and Bernadette heading to a movie premiere. Let me try to understand what's going on and figure out how to solve it step by step.

First, the problem says that Bernadette wants to arrive at the premiere 5 minutes before Wayne. That means she needs to leave earlier so that her total travel time is less than Wayne's by 5 minutes, right? So if Wayne takes, say, 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs her travel time to be 4 minus 5 minutes? Wait, that would be negative, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, no, let me read it again. It says, "Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne." So if Wayne arrives at time T, Bernadette wants to arrive at T - 5 minutes. So Bernadette's travel time is her own travel time, let's call it B, and Wayne's travel time is W. So B + her waiting time or something? Wait, actually, maybe both of them just drive directly to the theater, so their travel times are the only times we're considering. So if Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, as given, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's. Wait, is that right?

Wait, hold on. Let me parse the problem again:

"Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?"

Wait, so Wayne's drive is 4 minutes. Bernadette's drive is four times as long as Wayne's. So her drive would take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes. So if they both leave at the same time, Bernadette would arrive 16 minutes later, while Wayne arrives 4 minutes later. But Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

Wait, but if Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes, and Wayne's takes 4 minutes, how can she arrive 5 minutes before Wayne? Because if she leaves at the same time, she arrives 16 minutes later, which is way after Wayne. So she needs to leave earlier so that her total time is 5 minutes less than Wayne's.

Wait, no, maybe not the total time, but the difference in their arrival times. Let me think.

So, if both leave at the same time, Wayne arrives in 4 minutes, Bernadette arrives in 16 minutes. So the difference is 12 minutes, meaning Wayne arrives 12 minutes earlier than Bernadette. But Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes earlier than Wayne. So she needs to make up that 12 minute difference and then have an additional 5 minutes before. So she needs to leave early enough so that her arrival time is 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival time.

So, if we let T be the time Bernadette leaves before Wayne, then the time it takes for her to drive is 16 minutes, so her arrival time would be T - 16. Wayne's arrival time is 4 minutes. So we want T - 16 = 4 - 5. That is, T - 16 = -1. So T = 15 minutes. So Bernadette needs to leave 15 minutes before Wayne.

Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check.

If Bernadette leaves 15 minutes before Wayne, she will take 16 minutes to drive, so she arrives at 1 minute before Wayne arrives. Because 15 - 16 is -1, meaning 1 minute before. So yes, that works. So she arrives 5 minutes before, but actually, she arrives 1 minute earlier? Wait, no. Wait, if she leaves 15 minutes before, her arrival time is 15 - 16 = -1, which is 1 minute before Wayne's arrival time, which is 4 minutes. So that's 4 minutes after she leaves. So if she leaves at time 0, she arrives at time -1 (1 minute before). Wayne leaves at time 0 and arrives at time 4. So the difference is 5 minutes? Wait, actually, the difference is 5 minutes. Because from her arrival time to his arrival time is 5 minutes. So yes, she arrives 5 minutes before him.

Wait, but if she leaves 15 minutes earlier, her arrival is 1 minute earlier than his arrival. So the total difference is 5 minutes? Wait, but 1 minute is less than 5. Hmm, maybe I messed up the math.

Wait, let's formalize this. Let's assign variables.

Let’s denote:

- Let W be the time it takes Wayne to drive to the theater: W = 4 minutes.

- Let B be the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater: B = 4 * W = 16 minutes.

We want Bernadette to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. So if Wayne arrives at time T, Bernadette should arrive at time T - 5.

Assuming they both leave at the same time, let’s say time 0. Then:

- Wayne arrives at time 0 + W = 4.

- Bernadette arrives at time 0 + B = 16.

But Bernadette wants to arrive at 4 - 5 = -1. So she needs to arrive at -1, which is 1 minute earlier than Wayne's arrival time of 4. But that only gives her a 1 minute difference, not 5.

Wait, so the problem is she needs to arrive 5 minutes earlier than Wayne. So if Wayne arrives at 4, she arrives at -1 (1 minute earlier). So she needs to have an arrival time of -5, which is 5 minutes before 0.

Wait, so she needs to leave earlier so that her arrival time is 5 minutes before Wayne's. So if we let L be the time Bernadette leaves before Wayne, then:

- Bernadette's arrival time: L - B = (0 + L) - B = L - 16.

- Wayne's arrival time: 0 + W = 4.

We want:

L - 16 = 4 - 5 = -1.

So L - 16 = -1.

Then, L = 15.

So Bernadette needs to leave 15 minutes before Wayne.

So if she leaves at time -15, she arrives at -15 -16 = -31, which is 31 minutes before the intended time. But that doesn't seem to align.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the difference in their arrival times.

If both leave at the same time, Bernadette arrives in 16 minutes, Wayne in 4 minutes. So the difference is 12 minutes (Bernadette arrives 12 minutes after Wayne). But she wants to arrive 5 minutes earlier. So she needs to bridge that 12 minute gap and have an additional 5 minutes before. So she needs to leave 12 + 5 = 17 minutes before Wayne.

Wait, but 17 minutes seems like a lot.

Wait, let's think differently.

Let’s denote T as the time Bernadette leaves before Wayne.

Then, Bernadette's arrival time is T - B = T - 16.

Wayne's arrival time is 0 + W = 4.

We want:

T - 16 = 4 - 5 = -1.

So T = 15.

Yes, so T is 15 minutes. So Bernadette should leave 15 minutes before Wayne.

So that, she arrives at 15 - 16 = -1, which is 1 minute before Wayne arrives at 4.

Wait, but 1 minute isn't 5 minutes. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe we should think about the difference in their arrival times being 5 minutes. So if Wayne arrives at 4, Bernadette should arrive at -1. So the difference is 15 minutes.

Because Bernadette drives for 16 minutes, so if she leaves 15 minutes earlier, she arrives at -1, which is 1 minute before Wayne arrives. So the difference in arrival times is 1 minute, but we need a 5-minute difference.

Wait, so maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I need to set up the equation so that Bernadette's arrival time is 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival time.

So, if we let t be the time Bernadette leaves before Wayne, then:

Bernadette's arrival time: t - B.

Wayne's arrival time: 0 + W.

Set t - B = (0 + W) - 5.

So t - 16 = 4 - 5 = -1.

So t = 15.

So Bernadette needs to leave 15 minutes before Wayne. So that, she arrives at 15 - 16 = -1 (1 minute before Wayne arrives at 4). So the difference is 5 minutes? Wait, no, the difference is 1 minute.

Wait, maybe the question is that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so if Wayne arrives at 4, she arrives at -1. So the difference in their departure times is such that her drive time is 16 minutes, so she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne? Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of relative speed or something, but no, it's just driving times.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm misinterpreting the question.

Let me read it again:

"Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?"

So, it's not about arrival times, but about when they should leave. So, if the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as Wayne's, which is 4 minutes, so Bernadette's drive is 16 minutes.

But she wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. So, if Wayne takes 4 minutes, arriving at time 4, Bernadette should arrive at time 4 - 5 = -1.

But Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes, so if she arrives at -1, she must have left at -1 - 16 = -17.

Wayne arrives at 4, having left at 0. So the difference in their leaving times is -17 - 0 = -17 minutes, meaning Bernadette left 17 minutes before Wayne.

But that seems like a lot, but mathematically, that's what it comes out to.

Wait, but that would mean that Bernadette's arrival time is 17 - 16 = 1 minute earlier than Wayne, but the problem says she wants to arrive 5 minutes earlier. So this seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe I need another approach.

Let’s denote:

- Let’s say the time it takes Wayne to drive is W = 4 minutes.

- The time it takes Bernadette is B = 4 * W = 16 minutes.

- Let’s denote the time Bernadette should leave before Wayne as L.

- So Bernadette's arrival time is L - B.

- Wayne's arrival time is 0 + W.

We want:

L - B = W - 5.

So,

L - 16 = 4 - 5.

So,

L - 16 = -1.

Thus, L = 15.

So Bernadette needs to leave 15 minutes before Wayne.

So, if she leaves 15 minutes earlier, she arrives at 15 - 16 = -1 (1 minute before Wayne arrives at 4). So the difference in arrival times is 5 minutes (from -1 to 4). Wait, no, from -1 to 4 is 5 minutes.

Wait, actually, the difference between their arrival times is 5 minutes. So Bernadette arrives at -1, Wayne arrives at 4. The difference is 5 minutes. So that works.

But the question is, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne? So she leaves 15 minutes earlier, and arrives 5 minutes earlier. So the answer is 15 minutes.

But that seems like a lot, but according to the math, that's correct.

Wait, let me think of it in another way.

If both leave at the same time, Bernadette arrives 12 minutes after Wayne. But she wants to arrive 5 minutes earlier, so she needs to bridge that 12 minute gap and have a 5 minute lead. So she needs to leave 12 + 5 = 17 minutes before Wayne.

Wait, that would mean she arrives 17 - 16 = 1 minute earlier, which is only 1 minute. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is 15 minutes because when we set up the equation, it comes out to 15.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use relative speed or something else.

Wait, no, it's just linear driving times. So I think the initial approach is correct.

So, the answer is 15 minutes.

Wait, let me check:

If Bernadette leaves 15 minutes before Wayne:

- She arrives at 15 - 16 = -1.

- Wayne arrives at 0 + 4 = 4.

The difference is 5 minutes (-1 to 4 is 5 minutes). So, yes, she arrives 5 minutes earlier.

So, the answer is 15 minutes.

Wait, but 15 minutes seems like a lot. But according to the math, that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of distance and speed, but since the problem gives us times, not distances, that might not be necessary.

Let me think about the relationship between their driving times.

If Bernadette's drive is 4 times as long as Wayne's, and Wayne's drive is 4 minutes, then Bernadette's drive is 16 minutes.

So, if she wants to arrive 5 minutes earlier, she needs her total driving time plus the time she leaves earlier to result in arriving 5 minutes before Wayne.

Wait, let me denote:

Let’s let t be the time Bernadette leaves before Wayne.

So, Bernadette's arrival time is t - 16.

Wayne's arrival time is 0 + 4.

We want t - 16 = 4 - 5.

So, t = 15.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 15 minutes before Wayne.

So, the answer is 15 minutes.

Yes, that seems consistent.

So, I think the answer is 15 minutes.

**Final Answer**
Bernadette should leave \boxed{15} minutes before Wayne.
</think>

Wayne and Bernadette are heading to the premiere of their latest film. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Wayne’s drive takes 4 minutes. 

1. Wayne's drive time: \( W = 4 \) minutes.
2. Bernadette's drive time: \( B = 4 \times W = 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.
3. We need Bernadette to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. If Wayne arrives at time \( T \), Bernadette should arrive at \( T - 5 \).

Let \( L \) be the time Bernadette leaves before Wayne. Bernadette's arrival time is \( L - 16 \) and Wayne's arrival time is \( 4 \). We want:

\[ L - 16 = 4 - 5 \]
\[ L - 16 = -1 \]
\[ L = 15 \]

Thus, Bernadette should leave 15 minutes before Wayne.

\[
\boxed{15}
\]
