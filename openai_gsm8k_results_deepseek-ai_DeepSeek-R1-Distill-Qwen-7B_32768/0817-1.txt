Question:
Walter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?

Correct Answer:
Walter collects $500 + $1500 + $200 = $<<500+1500+200=2200>>2,200 he collects from everyone for charity.
His lawyer has offered to donate 3 times that amount, $2,200 x 3 = $<<3*2200=6600>>6,600 that Walter's lawyer is going to donate.
#### 6,600

Gold:
6600

Wrong Prediction:
6000

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Walter is collecting money for charity, and I need to figure out how much his lawyer is going to contribute. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Walter collects $500 from his neighbors. That seems straightforward. Then, he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. So, so far, he has $500 plus $1500, which is $2000.

Wait, hold on. Is the $500 from neighbors and the $1500 from the online fund, or are those separate? I think they are separate because they mention he collected from his neighbors and then from an online fund. So, that should be $500 + $1500 = $2000 total.

Next, his lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Hmm, so we need to figure out how much everyone else donates, and then multiply that by three to find the lawyer's contribution.

But wait, who is "everyone else"? Is it just his neighbors and the online fund, or does it include other people he might collect from? The problem says he is going to tell his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. So, does that mean that his friend is going to give him $200, which Walter will then use to help collect more?

Wait, let me read the problem again: "Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well." Hmm, maybe I misread that. So, maybe Walter is collecting from his neighbors, then from the online fund, and then he tells them about it until his friend gives him $200. So, the $200 is from his friend, which will be added to the collection.

But the lawyer's donation is three times as much as everyone else donates. So, "everyone else" is probably referring to the people Walter has already collected from, which would be his neighbors and the online fund.

So, let's clarify. Walter has collected from his neighbors: $500, and from the online fund: $1500. So, that's $2000. Then, Walter goes on to tell them about it, and when his friend gives him $200, so Walter now has an additional $200, making the total amount he has collected so far $2200.

But the lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Wait, so is the "everyone else" referring to the people Walter has collected from, which are his neighbors and the online fund, or does it include the $200 from his friend?

I think it's the former because the problem says Walter is collecting money for charity first from his neighbors, then from the online fund, then tells them about it until his friend gives him $200 as well. So, the $200 is from his friend, so it's an additional amount that Walter has collected.

So, the total amount that Walter has collected before his friend gives him $200 is $500 + $1500 = $2000. Then his friend gives him $200, so now he's going to tell his neighbors and online fund about it. So, the "everyone else" that the lawyer is donating to would be the people Walter has approached, which are his neighbors and the online fund.

Therefore, the amount that "everyone else" donates is the total Walter has collected from his neighbors and online fund, which is $2000. So, the lawyer is going to donate three times that amount.

So, $2000 multiplied by 3 is $6000. Therefore, the lawyer is going to contribute $6000.

Wait, but let me make sure. Is the $200 from his friend also part of the "everyone else"? The problem says he tells him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. So, the $200 is from his friend, so when Walter tells his neighbors and online fund about it, they would include the $200 as part of their donations? Or does the $200 come on top of that?

I think it's that Walter first gets $500 from neighbors, then $1500 from the online fund, so that's $2000. Then, he tells them about it, and then his friend gives him $200 as well, so now he has $2200. So, the "everyone else" is the people he's told, which are his neighbors and the online fund, and their donations include the $200 from his friend.

But wait, no. The $200 is from his friend, so it's an additional amount that Walter is going to tell his neighbors and online fund about, so when they donate, they might donate the $200 as well. But actually, the problem states that Walter is going to tell them about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well.

So, perhaps the $200 is the amount Walter is going to ask his friend to give him, and then he will tell his neighbors and online fund about it. So, the $200 is a separate amount.

So, in that case, the "everyone else" is just his neighbors and online fund, who have already donated $2000. Then, Walter is going to tell them about it, and then his friend gives him $200, but that $200 is not part of "everyone else" because it's from his friend, not from "everyone else".

So, in this case, the lawyer is donating three times as much as "everyone else donates," which is $2000. So, the lawyer donates 3 * $2000 = $6000.

Therefore, the answer is $6000.

But to make sure, let me parse the problem again.

"Walter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?"

So, order of events:

1. Collect $500 from neighbors.

2. Collect $1500 from online fund.

3. Then, he tells them about his neighbors and online fund.

4. Until his friend gives him $200 as well.

So, when he tells them about it, does he collect more donations from them, or does he tell them, and they donate more? Or does he tell them, and his friend gives him $200, which he will then distribute or use for something else?

I think the key is that the $200 is from his friend, so it's an additional amount that Walter will have.

But the problem is about his lawyer's contribution, which is three times as much as everyone else donates.

So, "everyone else" is the people Walter has already approached: his neighbors and the online fund. So, that's $500 + $1500 = $2000.

So, the lawyer is offering to donate three times that, which is $6000.

So, regardless of whether Walter gets more money from his friend, the lawyer's contribution is based on the amount that "everyone else" donates, which is the $2000 from his neighbors and online fund. The $200 from his friend is separate; perhaps that's additional money that Walter will have, but it's not part of "everyone else's" donations.

Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is three times the $2000, so $6000.

Alternatively, if the $200 is included in "everyone else's" donations, then "everyone else" would have $2200, so the lawyer would donate 3 * $2200 = $6600. But I don't think so because the $200 is from his friend, not from "everyone else."

So, I think the correct answer is $6000.

Wait, just to make sure, let's think about it another way.

If "everyone else" donates the total amount that Walter has collected from his neighbors and online fund, which is $2000, then the lawyer donates 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The $200 from his friend is not part of that total; it's an additional amount that Walter will use for the charity, perhaps to collect more donations? Or maybe he will add it to his existing funds.

But regardless, the lawyer's contribution is based on "everyone else's" donations, which are the $2000. So, the $200 is not part of that, because it's from his friend, so it's Walter's own money.

Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is $6000.

I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
Walter's lawyer is going to contribute \boxed{6000} dollars.
</think>

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund he set up online, totaling $2000. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. "Everyone else" refers to his neighbors and the online fund, who have donated $2000. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is three times $2000, which is $6000.
