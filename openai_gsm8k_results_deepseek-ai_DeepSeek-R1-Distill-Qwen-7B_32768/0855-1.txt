Question:
Luke is spending time at the beach building sandcastles. He eventually notices that each level of a sandcastle will have half the square footage as the level below it. If he makes a 4 leveled sandcastle where the top level has a square footage of 16, what is the average square footage of a level?

Correct Answer:
Level 3 is 32 square feet because 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32
Level 2 is 64 square feet because 32 x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64
Level 1 is 128 square feet because 64 x 2 = <<64*2=128>>128
The four levels total to 240 square feet because 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = <<128+64+32+16=240>>240
The average square footage of a level is 60 because 240 / 4 = <<240/4=60>>60

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out the average square footage of each level in Luke's sandcastle. Let me read the problem again and make sure I understand it.

Luke builds a 4-level sandcastle, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it. The top level has 16 square feet. I need to find the average square footage per level.

Alright, so let's break this down. The sandcastle has 4 levels, starting from the top. Each level is half the size of the one below. So, the top level is the smallest, and each subsequent level is twice as big as the one above it.

Given that the top level is 16 square feet, I can work my way down to find the square footage of each level.

Let me denote the levels as Level 1 (top) to Level 4 (bottom). So:

- Level 1: 16 square feet
- Level 2: half of Level 1, so 16 / 2 = 8 square feet
- Level 3: half of Level 2, so 8 / 2 = 4 square feet
- Level 4: half of Level 3, so 4 / 2 = 2 square feet

Wait a second, is that right? Let me double-check. If Level 1 is 16, then Level 2 is half of that, which is 8. Then Level 3 is half of 8, which is 4, and Level 4 is half of 4, which is 2. Hmm, that seems correct.

Now, to find the average square footage per level, I need to add up the square footage of all levels and then divide by the number of levels, which is 4.

So, first, let's sum them up:

Level 1: 16
Level 2: 8
Level 3: 4
Level 4: 2

Adding these together: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2.

Let me calculate that step by step.

16 + 8 = 24

24 + 4 = 28

28 + 2 = 30

So, the total square footage is 30.

Now, to find the average, I divide this total by the number of levels, which is 4.

So, 30 divided by 4.

Hmm, 30 รท 4 is equal to 7.5.

Wait, 4 times 7 is 28, and 4 times 7.5 is 30. So, yes, 7.5.

Therefore, the average square footage per level is 7.5 square feet.

Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through the steps again.

Starting from the top:

Level 1: 16

Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8

Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4

Level 4: 4 / 2 = 2

Total: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

Average: 30 / 4 = 7.5

Yes, that seems consistent. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations.

Alternatively, I can think about this in terms of geometric sequences. Since each level is half the size of the one below it, the square footages form a geometric sequence where the first term is 16, and the common ratio is 1/2.

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S_n = a1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values:

a1 = 16
r = 1/2
n = 4

So, S_4 = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)

First, calculate (1/2)^4: that's 1/16.

So, 1 - 1/16 = 15/16

Then, the denominator is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2

So, S_4 = 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)

Simplify numerator: 16 * (15/16) = 15

So, S_4 = 15 / (1/2) = 15 * 2 = 30

Which matches the total I calculated before.

Then, the average is 30 / 4 = 7.5

So, that's another way to confirm that the total is 30, so the average is 7.5.

I think this confirms that the average square footage is indeed 7.5.

Wait, just to make sure, let me try summing them again:

Level 1: 16

Level 2: 8

Level 3: 4

Level 4: 2

Adding them: 16 + 8 = 24; 24 + 4 = 28; 28 + 2 = 30.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I think of the average, it's like distributing the total square footage equally across all levels. So, 30 divided by 4 is 7.5. So each level would have 7.5 square feet on average.

Is 7.5 a reasonable number? Let's see. The levels go from 16 to 2, so it's decreasing each time. The average is somewhere in between, 7.5 is between 16 and 2, so that makes sense.

Alternatively, if I think of all the levels:

Level 1: 16

Level 2: 8

Level 3: 4

Level 4: 2

So, their sum is 30, which is 7.5 each on average.

Alternatively, if I think about it as the sum: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

Dividing by 4: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

Yep, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any errors in my calculations. So, the average square footage per level is 7.5.

**Final Answer**
The average square footage of a level is \boxed{7.5}.
</think>

Luke's sandcastle has 4 levels, with each level having half the square footage of the level below it. The top level has 16 square feet. To find the average square footage per level, we first determine the square footage of each level:

- Level 1 (top): 16 square feet
- Level 2: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
- Level 3: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
- Level 4 (bottom): \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Next, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total by the number of levels (4):
\[ \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is \(\boxed{7.5}\).
