Question:
Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack.  They are currently on sale for buy one get one free.  She also has a $2.00 coupon.  How much will each individual razor cost, in cents, after the discount if she buys 2 packs of razors?

Correct Answer:
Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00
Each pack has 4 razors and she buys 2 packs for a total of 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 razors
The razors cost $2.00 and she bought 8 so that means each razor costs $2.00/8 = $<<2/8=0.25>>0.25 each

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Heather has these razors that come in packs of 4, each pack costing $4.00. Right now, there's a sale going on where it's "buy one get one free." She also has a $2.00 coupon, and she wants to buy 2 packs. The question is asking how much each individual razor will cost in cents after applying the discounts. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out the total cost without any discounts. Each pack is $4.00, and she's buying 2 packs. So, that would be 2 multiplied by $4.00. Let me write that down:

2 packs * $4.00 per pack = $8.00

Okay, so without any sales or coupons, she would spend $8.00. But wait, there's a sale: buy one get one free. That means for every pack she buys, she gets another one for free. So, if she buys 2 packs, how does that work? Let me think.

If the sale is "buy one get one free," that usually means if you buy one pack, you get another one free. So, if she buys 1 pack, she gets 1 free, making it 2 packs. But she's buying 2 packs. Is that still applicable? Or does it mean that for each pack she buys, she gets another one free? Hmm, this might depend on how the sale is structured.

Wait, actually, the way the sale is worded is "buy one get one free," so it's a promotion where for each item you buy, you get another one for free. In this case, since she's buying razors in packs, perhaps for each pack she buys, she gets another pack free. So, buying 2 packs would mean she gets 2 free packs? That seems like a lot, but maybe that's how it's intended.

But that might not make sense, because in reality, such promotions usually apply when you buy a certain number of items, not necessarily per pack. Let me read the question again: "They are currently on sale for buy one get one free." So, for each item purchased, you get another one free. Wait, but razors come in packs of 4. So, does that mean for each pack she buys, she gets another pack free?

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify. If she buys one pack, she gets another one free. So, buying 1 pack, she gets 2 packs. So, if she wants to buy 2 packs, does she get 4 packs? Or is it a different structure?

Alternatively, maybe the "buy one get one free" applies when purchasing individual razors, not packs. But in the question, the razors come 4 to a pack. So, perhaps the deal is that for each pack you buy, you get another pack free. So, buying 1 pack gives you 2 packs, buying 2 packs gives you 4 packs. But that seems like a lot.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe it's similar to some coupon stores where if you buy one, you get one free, but it's per item. So, if she buys 8 razors, she gets 4 free. But since she's buying in packs of 4, perhaps the deal is that for every pack she buys, she gets another pack free.

So, if she buys 2 packs, each pack is 4 razors. So, buying 2 packs, she pays for 2 packs, but gets 2 packs free because of the promotion. So, essentially, she's getting 4 packs for the price of 2. Wait, that seems like she's getting 4 packs for the price of 2. That would be a big discount.

But let me parse the original question: "They are currently on sale for buy one get one free." So, for each pack she buys, she gets another pack free. So, if she buys 2 packs, she gets 2 free packs. So, in total, she would have 4 packs. Is that correct? But that might not be the case because "buy one get one free" usually applies per transaction, not per pack.

Wait, maybe it's per item. So, if she buys 2 packs (total of 8 razors), she gets 8 razors free. But that also seems excessive.

Alternatively, perhaps the sale is for each pack. So, if she buys one pack, she gets one free. So, if she buys 2 packs, she gets 2 free packs. But that would be 4 packs in total, which seems like a lot.

Wait, but let me read the question again: "They are currently on sale for buy one get one free." So, perhaps for each razor purchased, you get another razor free. So, if she buys 8 razors, she gets 8 free razors, but that would be 16 razors for the price of 8. That seems too much.

Alternatively, perhaps it's per pack. So, if she buys a pack, she gets another pack free. So, for 2 packs, she gets 2 free packs. So, 4 packs in total.

Wait, but the question is about how much each individual razor will cost in cents after the discount. So, if she is buying 2 packs (8 razors) and gets 2 free packs (8 razors), she would have 16 razors for the price of 8. But she also has a $2.00 coupon. So, perhaps the coupon can be applied on top of the sale.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify the order of operations. The question says, "How much will each individual razor cost, in cents, after the discount if she buys 2 packs of razors."

So, she buys 2 packs, which is 8 razors. Then, because of the sale, "buy one get one free," she gets 2 additional packs for free. So, she ends up with 4 packs, which is 16 razors, for the price of 2 packs, which is $8.00. Then, she has a $2.00 coupon. So, does she apply the coupon to the total?

Wait, so first, let's calculate the total cost without any coupons or sales: 2 packs * $4.00 = $8.00.

Then, with the sale, "buy one get one free," so for every pack purchased, you get another one free. So, if she buys 2 packs, she gets 2 free packs. So, she's paying for 2 packs, but getting 4 packs in total. So, the total cost is still $8.00.

Then, she has a $2.00 coupon. So, she can subtract $2.00 from the total. So, $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, she's paying $6.00 for 4 packs, which is 16 razors. So, each razor costs $6.00 / 16 razors. Let me compute that.

First, $6.00 divided by 16. Let me convert dollars to cents to make it easier. $6.00 is 600 cents. So, 600 cents divided by 16 razors. Let me do the division: 600 divided by 16.

16 goes into 600 how many times? 16*37 is 592, because 16*30=480, 16*7=112; 480+112=592. So, 600 - 592 is 8. So, 37 with a remainder of 8. So, 37.5 cents per razor.

Wait, 8 divided by 16 is 0.5. So, 37.5 cents per razor. So, each razor costs 37.5 cents.

But the question specifies to provide the answer in cents. So, 37.5 cents. But typically, prices are in whole cents, so maybe we need to round it? Or is 37.5 acceptable?

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Total cost without coupons: 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

With the "buy one get one free" sale, does that mean she gets 2 free packs? So, 4 packs in total, costing $8.00.

Then, she uses a $2.00 coupon, so total cost is $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Total razors: 4 packs * 4 razors = 16 razors.

Total cost: $6.00.

So, $6.00 divided by 16 razors: 600 cents / 16.

600 / 16: Let's do this division.

16*37 = 592

600 - 592 = 8

So, 8/16 = 0.5

So, 37.5 cents per razor.

Hmm, 37.5 cents. So, that's 37.5 cents per razor.

But in reality, stores don't usually price items in fractions of a cent, so maybe this is a theoretical question where fractions are allowed.

Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the sale. Maybe the sale is "buy one get one free," meaning for each razor you buy, you get another one free. So, if you buy 8 razors, you get 8 free, so 16 razors for the price of 8. Then, subtracting the $2.00 coupon, so 8 - 2 = 6. So, 16 razors for $6.00, which is the same as before.

So, 600 cents divided by 16 razors is still 37.5 cents per razor.

Alternatively, maybe the coupon is applied per pack? But the coupon is a flat $2.00, so it can be applied to the total.

So, regardless of how the sale is structured, it seems that the total cost after applying the coupon is $6.00 for 16 razors, so each razor is 37.5 cents.

Alternatively, let's think differently. Maybe the "buy one get one free" is only applicable per pack. So, if she buys 2 packs, she gets 2 free packs. So, that's 4 packs for the price of 2. So, the total cost is still $8.00, because she's buying 2 packs.

Then, she applies her $2.00 coupon, so subtracting $2.00, the total becomes $6.00.

So, same as before, 4 packs for $6.00, so 16 razors for $6.00.

So, 600 cents divided by 16 razors is 37.5 cents per razor.

Therefore, whether the sale is applied at the pack level or the individual item level, it seems the same result.

Wait, unless the sale is only applicable per pack, meaning that for each pack she buys, she gets one free. So, if she buys 2 packs, she gets 2 free packs. So, she's paying for 2, getting 4 for the price of 2. So, that's 4 packs for $8.00, same as before.

So, in that case, she still pays $8.00 for 4 packs, then applies the $2.00 coupon, so total cost is $6.00 for 4 packs, which is 16 razors. So, same calculation.

So, regardless of how the sale is structured, it's 16 razors for $6.00, which is 37.5 cents per razor.

So, 37.5 cents per razor.

But the question asks for the cost in cents, so 37.5 is acceptable? Or do we need to represent it as a fraction?

Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the coupons. Maybe the coupon can only be applied once or something. Hmm, the coupon is $2.00, so regardless of how much she spends, she can subtract $2.00. So, her total is $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00, as before.

Wait, another way: Maybe the coupon is applied after the sale discount. So, let me think.

If the sale is "buy one get one free," that could be a promotion where for each pack you buy, you get another pack free. So, if she buys 2 packs, she gets 2 free packs, so 4 packs total. So, she's paying for 2 packs, which is $8.00, but getting 4 packs. Then, she has a $2.00 coupon, which can be applied to the total. So, $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

So, total cost is $6.00 for 4 packs, which is 16 razors.

So, same as before.

Alternatively, if the coupon is applied before the sale, but that would be unusual. Typically, coupons are applied after discounts. So, I think the order is: buy 2 packs, get 2 free packs, so 4 packs total, costing $8.00, then apply $2.00 coupon, so total is $6.00.

Therefore, 16 razors for $6.00, which is 37.5 cents per razor.

So, 37.5 cents.

But in cents, that's 37.5, which is 37 cents and a half. So, if we need to represent this as a whole number, it might be 38 cents, but the question didn't specify rounding.

Wait, the question says, "How much will each individual razor cost, in cents, after the discount if she buys 2 packs of razors?"

So, it's just asking for the numerical value, in cents, so 37.5 is acceptable.

Alternatively, is there another way the discount could be calculated?

Wait, maybe the coupon can be applied per pack, but the coupon is a flat $2.00, so regardless of how many packs she buys, she can only subtract $2.00.

So, her total cost would be (2 packs * $4.00) + (2 packs * $0.00) because of the "buy one get one free," and then minus $2.00 coupon.

Wait, no, that's not the correct way. The "buy one get one free" is an offer that reduces the total cost by 50% on the packs purchased.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of discounts.

The original price for 2 packs is $8.00. With the sale, she gets 2 packs free, so the total cost is $8.00 for 4 packs.

But wait, she is buying 2 packs, getting 2 free, so it's 4 packs for $8.00. So, the price per pack is $2.00.

Then, subtracting the $2.00 coupon, the total cost is $6.00. So, she's spending $6.00 for 4 packs, which is 16 razors.

So, 16 razors for $6.00, which is 37.5 cents per razor.

Alternatively, is the coupon applied per pack? If she buys 2 packs, gets 2 free packs, so 4 packs, and then uses a $2.00 coupon on the total, which was originally $8.00. So, $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

So, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the coupon can only be applied if she buys more than a certain number of razors. But the question doesn't specify that.

So, I think 37.5 cents is the correct answer.

But to make sure, let me go through it one more time.

1. Heather buys 2 packs of razors. Each pack has 4 razors, so 2 packs = 8 razors.

2. The razors are on sale with "buy one get one free." So, for each pack she buys, she gets another pack free. Therefore, buying 2 packs, she gets 2 free packs. So, total packs she has is 4 packs, which is 16 razors.

3. The cost without the coupon: 4 packs * $4.00 per pack = $16.00.

Wait, hold on, that's conflicting with my previous thinking.

Wait, if she buys 2 packs, gets 2 free packs, so total packs is 4. Since each pack is $4.00, so 4 packs would be $16.00. Then, subtract the $2.00 coupon: $16.00 - $2.00 = $14.00.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation.

Wait, so now I'm confused. Let me clarify.

Is the "buy one get one free" applied per pack or per individual item?

If it's per pack, meaning for each pack bought, you get another pack free. So, if she buys 2 packs, she gets 2 free packs, totaling 4 packs.

Each pack is $4.00, so 4 packs would be $16.00. Then, she has a $2.00 coupon, so total cost is $16.00 - $2.00 = $14.00.

But she only bought 2 packs, so why would she have to pay $16.00? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, so maybe the "buy one get one free" is an offer where for each item bought, you get another one free. So, if she buys 8 razors (2 packs), she gets 8 razors free. So, she's paying for 8, getting 16 razors.

Then, she has a $2.00 coupon, so she subtracts $2.00 from the total.

Wait, so the total without coupon is 16 razors * (price per razor). The price per razor is $4.00 per pack / 4 razors = $1.00 per razor.

So, 16 razors at $1.00 each is $16.00.

Then, applying the $2.00 coupon, she pays $14.00.

Therefore, each razor is $14.00 / 16 razors = $0.875, which is 87.5 cents per razor.

Wait, that's different.

Wait, now I'm really confused because different interpretations lead to different answers.

So, let's parse the problem again:

"Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. They are currently on sale for buy one get one free. She also has a $2.00 coupon. How much will each individual razor cost, in cents, after the discount if she buys 2 packs of razors?"

So, she buys 2 packs. Each pack is 4 razors, costing $4.00.

The sale is "buy one get one free," which I think in this context, it's an offer where for each pack you buy, you get another pack free. So, if she buys 2 packs, she gets 2 free packs. So, she ends up with 4 packs for the price of 2.

So, without the coupon, the total cost is 2 packs * $4.00 = $8.00.

Then, she has a $2.00 coupon, so subtracting that, total cost is $6.00.

So, 4 packs, which is 16 razors, for $6.00.

Therefore, each razor is 600 cents / 16 = 37.5 cents.

Alternatively, if the sale is per razor, meaning for each razor she buys, she gets another one free, so buying 8 razors, getting 8 free, so 16 razors for the price of 8.

Then, without the coupon, the total cost is 8 razors * ($4.00 / 4) = 8 * $1.00 = $8.00.

Then, applying the $2.00 coupon, she pays $6.00 for 16 razors, so 600 / 16 = 37.5 cents per razor.

Wait, so both interpretations lead to the same result? Because in one case, buying 2 packs, getting 2 free packs, so 4 packs, costing $8.00, minus $2.00, is $6.00.

In the other case, buying 2 packs (8 razors), getting 8 free razors, so 16 razors, costing $8.00, minus $2.00, is $6.00.

So, regardless of whether the sale is per pack or per razor, she ends up with 16 razors for $6.00.

Therefore, each razor is 37.5 cents.

So, in both interpretations, the result is the same.

Therefore, the answer is 37.5 cents per razor.

But let me just confirm.

If the sale is per pack, so 2 packs, getting 2 free packs, so 4 packs, costing $8.00. Minus $2.00 coupon: $6.00.

4 packs is 16 razors, so 600 / 16 = 37.5.

If the sale is per razor, 2 packs (8 razors) get 8 free razors, so 16 razors, costing $8.00. Minus $2.00: $6.00.

Same result.

Therefore, 37.5 cents per razor.

So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The cost per individual razor after the discount is \boxed{37.5} cents.
</think>

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, each containing 4 razors, at $4.00 per pack. The razors are on sale with a "buy one get one free" promotion, meaning she gets 2 additional packs for free. She also has a $2.00 coupon.

1. Calculate the total cost without any discounts:
   \[
   2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
   \]

2. Apply the "buy one get one free" promotion, which gives her 2 free packs. Therefore, she ends up with 4 packs:
   \[
   4 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 16 \text{ razors}
   \]

3. Subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost:
   \[
   \$8.00 - \$2.00 = \$6.00
   \]

4. Convert the total cost to cents and divide by the number of razors to find the cost per razor:
   \[
   \$6.00 = 600 \text{ cents}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{600 \text{ cents}}{16 \text{ razors}} = 37.5 \text{ cents per razor}
   \]

Thus, the cost per individual razor after the discount is \boxed{37.5} cents.
