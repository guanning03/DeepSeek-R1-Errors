Question:
Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?

Correct Answer:
She trades 27 small stickers because 30 x .9 = <<27=27>>27
She gets 9 large buttons for these because 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9
She trades 20 large stickers for large buttons because 40 x .5 = 20
She gets 20 large buttons for these because 20 / 1 = <<20/1=20>>20
She trades 50% of her large stickers for small buttons because 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50
She trades 20 large stickers for small buttons because 40 x .5 = 20
She gets 60 small buttons because 20 x 3 = <<20*3=60>>60
She has 89 buttons at the end because 9 + 20 + 60 = <<9+20+60=89>>89
#### 89

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem about Lorraine and Colleen trading stickers for buttons. It seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me write down what I understand and then work through it.

First, there are two types of stickers: large and small. Each large sticker is worth either a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. Also, a large button is worth three small stickers. Hmm, that's a bit confusing, but I think I can handle it.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She does a few trades:

1. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
2. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
3. She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons.

We need to figure out how many buttons she has by the end. So, buttons can be large or small, and we need to calculate the total number of buttons she has after all these trades.

Let me start by figuring out how many small and large stickers Lorraine has initially.

She has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First trade: She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.

So, 90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. So she trades 27 small stickers.

Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, but wait, actually, she's trading small stickers for large buttons. So, I need to figure out how many large buttons she gets for those 27 small stickers.

Wait, let me read that again: Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. So, does that mean that a large sticker is equivalent to either one large button or three small buttons? Or is it that you can exchange a large sticker for a large button or three small buttons?

Hmm, maybe I need to clarify the exchange rates.

From the problem:

- A large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. So, that seems like the sticker can be exchanged for either a large button or three small buttons.

- A small sticker is worth one small button.

- A large button is worth three small stickers.

So, let's parse this:

- 1 large sticker = 1 large button or 3 small buttons.

- 1 small sticker = 1 small button.

- 1 large button = 3 small stickers.

So, the exchange rates are consistent because if 1 large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, and 1 large button is worth 3 small stickers, then 1 large sticker is worth 1 large button, which is worth 3 small stickers, which is worth 3 small buttons. So everything is consistent.

Therefore, when Lorraine trades her small stickers for large buttons, each small sticker can be converted to a large button or three small buttons.

But in this case, she's trading small stickers for large buttons. So, each small sticker can be exchanged for a large button. Alternatively, she could have gotten three small buttons for each small sticker, but since she's trading for large buttons, she gets one large button per small sticker.

Wait, but hold on. Is the exchange one for one? Or is there a different rate?

Wait, the problem says: "Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons." So, that suggests that 1 large sticker = 1 large button or 3 small buttons.

Therefore, 1 large sticker is equivalent to 1 large button or 3 small buttons. So, if she trades a small sticker for something, it's either a small button or, wait, no, she can only trade large stickers for buttons or small stickers. Wait, let me go back to the problem.

Wait, she has small stickers and large stickers. She is trading small stickers for large buttons and large stickers for large buttons and small buttons.

Wait, let's read the problem again:

"Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons."

So, in the first trade: 90% of small stickers for large buttons.

Second trade: 50% of large stickers for large buttons, and the rest 50% for small buttons.

So, the key is, she is converting her stickers into buttons. So, when she trades a sticker, it's being converted into buttons, which are either large or small.

So, the exchange rates are:

- 1 large sticker can be traded for 1 large button or 3 small buttons.

- 1 small sticker can be traded for 1 small button.

Wait, but the problem says a large button is worth three small stickers. So, 1 large button = 3 small stickers.

Therefore, 1 large button is worth 3 small stickers, and 1 small sticker is worth 1 small button.

So, that would imply that 1 large button is worth 3 small buttons.

So, now, let's think about the exchange rates.

If L is the number of large stickers, S is the number of small stickers, and B_l is the number of large buttons, B_s is the number of small buttons.

The exchange rates are:

1 large sticker (LS) = 1 large button (LB) or 3 small buttons (SB).

1 small sticker (SS) = 1 small button (SB).

1 large button (LB) = 3 small stickers (SS).

1 small button (SB) = 1 small sticker (SS).

Thus, we can model the trade as:

- For each large sticker traded, she can get 1 LB or 3 SB.

- For each small sticker traded, she can get 1 SB.

So, now, let's get back to the problem.

L starts with 30 SS and 40 LS.

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.

So, 90% of 30 SS is 0.9 * 30 = 27 SS. So, she trades 27 SS for large buttons.

Since each small sticker can be traded for 1 SB, trading 27 SS would give her 27 SB.

But wait, hold on. She can choose to trade small stickers for either large buttons or small buttons.

But in this case, she is trading small stickers for large buttons, so each small sticker is converted into a large button.

But wait, is that possible? Because 1 large sticker is equivalent to 3 small buttons.

Wait, no, the problem says she is trading small stickers for large buttons. So, each small sticker can be traded for a large button. But 1 large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 1 small sticker is not directly worth a large button. Wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify.

The problem says:

"Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons."

So, that suggests that 1 LS = 1 LB or 3 SB.

Similarly, 1 small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 1 SS = 1 SB.

Also, 1 large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 1 LB = 3 SS.

So, 1 LB = 3 SS, and 1 SS = 1 SB, so 1 LB = 3 SB.

Therefore, 1 LS can be converted into 1 LB or 3 SB.

But 1 LB is worth 3 SB, so in effect, 1 LS is worth 3 SB or 1 LB, which is the same as 3 SB. So, the value is consistent.

Therefore, when she trades a small sticker for a large button, she is effectively giving up 1 SS and getting 1 LB, which is equivalent to 3 SB.

Wait, but 1 LB is equal to 3 SB, so she's trading 1 SS for 1 LB, which is 3 SB.

So, the value remains the same.

Similarly, if she were to trade a large sticker for a large button, that would be a no-op, since they are the same.

Wait, but in the problem, she is trading her own stickers for buttons, so she's effectively converting her stickers into buttons.

So, when she trades small stickers for large buttons, she's exchanging 1 SS for 1 LB.

But since 1 LB is equal to 3 SB, she's effectively losing 1 SS and gaining 1 LB, which is 3 SB.

Wait, but since she's trading, perhaps she's giving up 1 SS and receiving 1 LB, so in terms of buttons, she's increasing her buttons by 1 LB, but she's losing 1 SS.

But her total number of buttons is different.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of this in terms of the total value.

But maybe it's simpler to just track the number of each type.

Wait, let's try to model this.

Let's note that buttons can be converted into stickers and vice versa.

But in this problem, she is only trading stickers for buttons, not buttons for stickers. So, perhaps we don't have to worry about converting buttons back into stickers.

Wait, the problem says:

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, and trades the rest 50% for small buttons.

So, she is only converting stickers into buttons, not buttons into stickers.

Therefore, the buttons are only being obtained through these trades, and the original stickers are being converted.

Therefore, the buttons can be large or small, and we need to calculate the total number of buttons she has.

So, perhaps I can model this as follows.

Let me start with her initial stock:

- Small stickers (SS): 30

- Large stickers (LS): 40

She will trade some SS and LS into buttons.

First trade: 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.

So, 90% of 30 SS is 27 SS.

She trades these 27 SS into large buttons.

Since each SS is worth 1 SB, she gets 27 SB.

Therefore, after this trade:

- SS: 30 - 27 = 3 SS

- LS: 40 (unchanged)

- B_l: 0 (since she's only trading for buttons, not large stickers)

- B_s: 27

Second trade: She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, and the rest for small buttons.

So, she has 40 LS. 50% of that is 20 LS, and 50% is 20 LS.

So, she trades 20 LS for large buttons, and 20 LS for small buttons.

Now, trading 20 LS for large buttons: Each LS can be traded for 1 LB or 3 SB.

But she's trading for large buttons here, so she gets 20 LB.

Similarly, for the other 20 LS, she's trading for small buttons, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 SB.

Therefore, after the second trade:

- LS: 40 - 20 (traded for LB) - 20 (traded for SB) = 0 LS

- B_l: 20

- B_s: 27 (from first trade) + 60 (from second trade) = 87

So, now, let's tally up her buttons:

- Large buttons: 20

- Small buttons: 87

Additionally, she still has 3 SS.

But wait, buttons are all that matter, right? Or do we count the remaining stickers as well?

Wait, the problem says she is trading for buttons, so I think she ends up with buttons, not the original stickers. So, perhaps the 3 SS are no longer in her possession? Or are they converted into buttons as well?

Wait, the problem says she starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers, and she trades some of them for buttons. So, after the trades, she will have buttons instead of the stickers she traded.

But she still has the stickers that were not traded.

So, in this case, after the first trade, she has 3 SS left, which were not traded. Then, in the second trade, she trades 20 LS for buttons, but those LS are gone. She also trades 20 LS for small buttons, so those are also gone.

Therefore, she still has 3 SS, 0 LS, 20 LB, and 87 SB.

But wait, but in the problem, it's asking how many buttons does she have by the end.

So, buttons are large buttons and small buttons. So, 20 + 87 = 107 buttons.

But hold on, the 3 SS she has left. Are those considered buttons? Or are they still considered stickers?

The problem says she is trading for buttons, so I think she converts her stickers into buttons. So, she would have only buttons, not stickers, at the end.

But wait, she had 3 SS left, which weren't traded. So, are those converted into buttons as well?

Wait, the problem says "she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons", so she converts that 27 SS into 27 SB.

Similarly, she trades 20 LS into LB and 20 LS into SB.

Therefore, the 3 SS are not traded, so she still has them.

But buttons are her only stickers after the trades? Or is the problem considering that she can convert her remaining stickers into buttons?

Wait, the problem says she is trading for buttons, but it doesn't specify that she can't have both.

Wait, let's read the problem again:

"Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers."

"Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?"

So, the problem says she is trading for buttons, so she is converting her stickers into buttons.

Therefore, the remaining small stickers, which are not traded, would be converted into buttons as well.

Because otherwise, she would still have some stickers, but the problem says she is trading her stickers for buttons.

So, perhaps she converts all her remaining stickers into buttons as well.

So, the 3 SS would be traded for 3 SB.

Therefore, in that case, she would have:

From first trade: 27 SB

From second trade: 60 SB

From remaining SS: 3 SB

Total SB: 27 + 60 + 3 = 90 SB

From the second trade: 20 LB

Total buttons: 20 LB + 90 SB = 110 buttons.

Wait, but let me check if that's the correct interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that she only trades the specified percentages, and that the remaining stickers are still considered her stickers, so she doesn't have buttons for them.

But the problem says she is trading for buttons, so it's unclear whether she keeps her remaining stickers or converts them as well.

Wait, but buttons are the only thing she ends up with, because she started with stickers and traded them for buttons.

Therefore, I think she converts all her remaining stickers into buttons as well.

So, the 3 SS are converted into 3 SB.

So, total buttons:

- From first trade: 27 SB

- From second trade: 60 SB

- From remaining SS: 3 SB

Total small buttons: 27 + 60 + 3 = 90

- From second trade: 20 LB

So, total buttons: 90 + 20 = 110.

Alternatively, maybe she doesn't convert the remaining 3 SS into buttons, so she only has 20 LB and 87 SB, totaling 107 buttons.

But the problem says she starts with 30 SS and 40 LS, and she trades some of them for buttons, so she still has some stickers left. Unless it's implied that she converts all her stickers into buttons.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of value.

Each small sticker is worth 1 SB.

Each large sticker is worth 3 SB.

Each large button is worth 3 SB.

So, the total value of her initial collection is:

30 SS * 1 SB + 40 LS * 3 SB = 30 + 120 = 150 SB.

After the trades, she should still have a total value of 150 SB in buttons.

So, if we calculate the total buttons, we can convert them back to SB to check.

So, let's compute the total buttons in terms of SB.

She has 20 LB and 87 SB.

Each LB is worth 3 SB, so 20 LB * 3 SB = 60 SB.

Therefore, total buttons in SB: 60 + 87 = 147 SB.

But she started with 150 SB, so she's missing 3 SB.

Wait, so if we consider that she converts all her remaining stickers into buttons, then she would have 3 SS converted to 3 SB, making the total SB 150.

But if she doesn't, she's short by 3 SB.

Alternatively, if she converts the remaining 3 SS into buttons, she would have 3 SB, so total buttons would be 20 LB + 87 SB + 3 SB = 20 LB + 90 SB, which is 20*3 + 90 = 60 + 90 = 150 SB.

Therefore, perhaps the problem expects that she converts all her remaining stickers into buttons, so the total buttons are 110.

But in the initial calculation, I thought 20 LB and 87 SB, which is 107, but that would be 107 buttons, but 107*3 + 87? Wait, no, that's not the way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only counting the buttons she has, regardless of type, so 20 LB and 87 SB, which is 107 buttons.

But in terms of value, it's 147 SB, which is less than the original 150 SB.

So, if she doesn't convert the remaining 3 SS, she's missing 3 SB, but if she does, she has 150 SB.

But the problem says she trades for buttons, so she's converting her stickers into buttons, so I think she should convert all her remaining stickers into buttons.

Therefore, the total number of buttons is 20 LB + 87 SB + 3 SB = 20 + 90 = 110 buttons.

Wait, but buttons are either large or small, so 20 large buttons and 90 small buttons, which are separate.

So, the total number of buttons is 20 + 90 = 110.

But wait, is that the correct way to count? Because 20 LB and 90 SB are separate, so yes, total buttons are 110.

But let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that buttons can be converted back, but in this case, she is only trading for buttons, so the total number of buttons is the sum of large and small buttons.

So, 20 large buttons and 90 small buttons: 110 buttons in total.

But let's confirm the value.

20 LB = 20 * 3 SB = 60 SB

90 SB = 90 SB

Total: 60 + 90 = 150 SB, which matches the initial value.

Therefore, 110 buttons, each of which is either large or small, but in terms of value, they sum up to 150 SB.

Therefore, the answer should be 110 buttons.

But let me check my calculations again step by step.

1. Starting with 30 SS and 40 LS.

2. First trade: 90% of 30 SS = 27 SS traded for large buttons. So, 27 SB.

   Now, SS = 3, LS = 40, B_l = 0, B_s = 27.

3. Second trade: 50% of 40 LS = 20 LS traded for large buttons (20 LB) and 20 LS traded for small buttons (20 * 3 = 60 SB).

   Now, LS = 0, B_l = 20, B_s = 27 + 60 = 87.

4. Remaining SS = 3, which are untraded. So, she can convert them into small buttons. 3 SS = 3 SB.

   So, B_s = 87 + 3 = 90.

5. Therefore, total buttons:

   - Large buttons: 20

   - Small buttons: 90

   Total buttons: 20 + 90 = 110.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, if she doesn't convert the remaining 3 SS, then total buttons would be 20 LB + 87 SB = 107 buttons, but that would make the total value 60 + 87 = 147 SB, which is less than the initial 150 SB.

Since she's trading for buttons, converting the remaining SS is necessary to maintain the total value.

Therefore, the total number of buttons is 110.

But to make sure, let me represent all steps with equations.

Let me denote:

- SS: small stickers

- LS: large stickers

- B_l: large buttons

- B_s: small buttons

Initial:

SS = 30

LS = 40

B_l = 0

B_s = 0

First trade: 90% of SS = 0.9 * 30 = 27 SS traded.

Each SS is worth 1 SB, so she gets 27 B_s.

So:

SS = 30 - 27 = 3

LS = 40

B_l = 0

B_s = 0 + 27 = 27

Second trade: 50% of LS = 0.5 * 40 = 20 LS traded.

Trading 20 LS into large buttons and 20 LS into small buttons.

Each LS traded for large buttons gives 1 B_l.

Each LS traded for small buttons gives 3 B_s.

So:

LS = 40 - 20 - 20 = 0

B_l = 0 + 20 = 20

B_s = 27 + (20 * 3) = 27 + 60 = 87

Remaining SS = 3, which are untraded. So, she can convert them into small buttons:

SS = 3

B_s = 87 + 3 = 90

Therefore, total buttons:

B_l = 20

B_s = 90

Total buttons = 20 + 90 = 110.

So, that's consistent.

Thus, the answer is 110 buttons.

**Final Answer**
Lorraine has \boxed{110} buttons by the end.
</think>

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers (SS) and 40 large stickers (LS). She trades stickers for buttons in two steps:

1. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
2. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and the rest for small buttons.

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **First Trade:**
   - Lorry trades 90% of her 30 small stickers, which is \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) SS.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button (SB), so she gets 27 SB.
   - Remaining small stickers: \(30 - 27 = 3\) SS.
   - Large stickers remain unchanged: 40 LS.

2. **Second Trade:**
   - Lorry trades 50% of her 40 large stickers, which is \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) LS.
     - She trades 20 LS for large buttons (LB), getting 20 LB.
     - She trades the remaining 20 LS for small buttons, getting \(20 \times 3 = 60\) SB.
   - Remaining large stickers: \(40 - 20 = 20\) LS.

3. **Conversion of Remaining Stickers:**
   - Lorry converts the remaining 3 SS into small buttons, adding 3 SB.
   - Total small buttons: \(27 + 60 + 3 = 90\) SB.
   - Total large buttons: 20 LB.

4. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons: 20
   - Small buttons: 90
   - Total buttons: \(20 + 90 = 110\)

Thus, Lorry has \(\boxed{110}\) buttons by the end.
