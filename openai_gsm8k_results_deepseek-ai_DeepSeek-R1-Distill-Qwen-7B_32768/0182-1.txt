Question:
Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. John ate half the amount Thomas ate. How many more hot dogs did John eat than Luke?

Correct Answer:
Thomas ate 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 hot dogs.
John ate 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 hot dogs.
John ate 3 - 2 = <<3-2=1>>1 more hot dog than Luke.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here about Luke, Thomas, and John eating hot dogs. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm going to write down each part to make sure I understand what's going on.

First, the problem says, "Luke ate 2 hot dogs." That seems straightforward. So, I'll write that down:

- Luke ate = 2 hot dogs.

Next, it says, "Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke." Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. The phrase "three times more" can be a bit tricky. Sometimes it's easy to misinterpret these kinds of problems. Let me think carefully.

When someone says "three times more," does that mean three times as many as the original, or four times as many? Because "more" implies addition. So, if Luke ate 2, and Thomas ate three times more, that should mean 2 plus three times 2, right? Let me calculate that:

Three times as many as Luke would be 3 * 2 = 6. But "three times more" is different. It means you have the original amount plus three times that amount. So, that would be 2 + (3 * 2) = 2 + 6 = 8. Let me confirm that understanding because it's crucial.

So, Thomas ate three times more than Luke. So, yes, if Luke has 2, Thomas has 2 + (3*2) = 8. I think that's correct. Alternatively, sometimes people interpret "three times more" as just three times the original, which would be 6, but in this context, I think it's more likely to mean 8. Let me check with the wording: "three times more hot dogs than Luke." So, "more" suggests addition, right? So, it's the original plus three times that. So, 2 + 6 = 8. Okay, I'm pretty confident now.

So, Thomas ate 8 hot dogs.

- Thomas ate = 8 hot dogs.

Now, the third part says, "John ate half the amount Thomas ate." So, John ate half of what Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate 8, half of 8 is 4. So, John ate 4 hot dogs.

- John ate = (1/2) * Thomas ate = (1/2)*8 = 4 hot dogs.

So, now we have:

- Luke: 2
- Thomas: 8
- John: 4

The question is, "How many more hot dogs did John eat than Luke?" So, I need to find the difference between the number of hot dogs John ate and Luke ate. So, that would be John's amount minus Luke's amount.

Calculating that: 4 - 2 = 2.

So, John ate 2 more hot dogs than Luke.

Wait, let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't skip anything or make an error.

1. Luke: 2 hot dogs. Straightforward.

2. Thomas ate three times more than Luke. So, "three times more" is more than just three times. It's three times the original plus the original. So, 2 + 6 = 8.

3. John ate half of what Thomas ate, which is 8 / 2 = 4.

4. John's total minus Luke's total: 4 - 2 = 2.

Yep, that seems consistent. So, John ate 2 more hot dogs than Luke.

I wonder if there's another way to interpret "three times more." Maybe someone could think it's three times as much as Luke, which would be 6. But in that case, Thomas would have eaten 6, and John would have eaten 3, and then John would have eaten 1 more than Luke. But I don't think that's the correct interpretation here because "three times more" usually implies adding three times the original amount.

But let me just verify that. In common language, if someone says, "I ate three times more cookies than you," they usually mean they ate three times as many as you plus your original amount. So, if you had 2, they had 6 more, making it 8 in total. So, 8 is correct for Thomas. So, John would have 4, so 2 more than Luke.

Therefore, the answer is 2.

**Final Answer**
The number of hot dogs John ate that were more than Luke's is \boxed{2}.
</think>

Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, which means Thomas ate 2 + (3 * 2) = 8 hot dogs. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, which is (1/2) * 8 = 4 hot dogs. Therefore, John ate 4 - 2 = 2 more hot dogs than Luke.

\[
\boxed{2}
