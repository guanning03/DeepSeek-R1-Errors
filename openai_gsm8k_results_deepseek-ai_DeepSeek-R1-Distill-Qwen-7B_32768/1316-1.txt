Question:
Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?

Correct Answer:
There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.
#### 25

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I need to figure out how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand each part correctly.

First, the die is six-sided, which means it has numbers 1 through 6, right? So each face has an equal chance of landing face up, which is 1/6 probability for each number.

Let me tackle the first part: the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. Numbers greater than 3 on a die are 4, 5, and 6. So that's three numbers. So how many favorable outcomes do we have? Three. And the total number of possible outcomes is six. Therefore, the probability should be 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%. Okay, that seems straightforward.

Now, the second part: the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. Hmm, so this is a bit different because it involves two consecutive rolls. I need to figure out the probability of getting an even number on the first roll and then an even number again on the second roll.

First, let me recall that on a six-sided die, the even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. So again, three even numbers out of six. So the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6, which is also 1/2 or 50%.

But since we're dealing with two consecutive rolls, I think we have to consider the probability of both events happening one after the other. So, I remember from probability that when you have independent events, the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.

So, in this case, the first roll and the second roll are independent events because the outcome of the first roll doesn't affect the outcome of the second roll. Therefore, we can multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event.

So, that would be 1/2 for the first roll being even multiplied by 1/2 for the second roll being even. Let me calculate that: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4, which is 25%.

Wait a second, so the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%? Hmm, that seems right. Because each has a 50% chance, and they're independent, so 0.5 * 0.5 is 0.25, which is 25%.

So, now I need to compare these two probabilities: rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%, and rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%. So, the question is asking how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

Hmm, so I think the way to phrase that is to find the difference in their probabilities, but also to express how much more likely one is compared to the other. So, I need to compute the difference between the two probabilities and then express that difference as a percentage of one of them. Wait, actually, the question says "how much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."

Okay, so they want to know how much more likely the first event is compared to the second. So, that would be the difference in their probabilities, but expressed as a percentage relative to the second probability.

So, perhaps I need to calculate the difference in their probabilities and then divide that difference by the probability of the second event to find out how much more likely the first event is.

Let me write that down.

First, let me get both probabilities:

- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 (let's call this P1) is 1/2 or 50%.
- Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row (let's call this P2) is 1/4 or 25%.

So, the difference in probabilities is P1 - P2 = 50% - 25% = 25%.

But the question is asking how much more likely it is that he rolls a number greater than 3 than he rolls two even numbers in a row, expressed as a percentage.

So, I think that means we need to express the difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. So, that would be (P1 - P2) / P2 * 100%.

So, plugging in the numbers, (50% - 25%) / 25% * 100% = 25% / 25% * 100% = 100%.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if P1 is 50% and P2 is 25%, the difference is 25%, which is exactly double P2. So, the increase is 100% of P2.

So, does that mean it's 100% more likely? Hmm, let's think about it.

If something is 100% more likely, that means it's twice as likely, right? So, if P2 is 25%, then something that is 100% more likely would be 25% + (100% of 25%) = 25% + 25% = 50%, which is exactly P1.

So, yes, that makes sense. So, rolling a number greater than 3 is 100% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused whether it's 100% more likely or just the difference. So, in this case, the difference is 25 percentage points, but the question is asking how much more likely in terms of percentage, so it's about the relative increase.

So, I think my initial reasoning is correct.

But let me just make sure. Let's consider another way: if I have two probabilities, P1 and P2, and I want to know how much more likely P1 is compared to P2, it's calculated as ((P1 - P2) / P2) * 100%.

So, plugging in numbers:

P1 = 50%, P2 = 25%

Difference = 25%

So, ((50% - 25%) / 25%) * 100% = (25% / 25%) * 100% = 100%.

Yes, so that's 100% more likely.

Alternatively, sometimes people express it as a ratio. So, P1 / P2 = 50% / 25% = 2. So, P1 is 2 times P2, meaning it's 100% more likely.

So, that seems consistent.

Therefore, I think the answer is that it's 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because 100% seems like a big number.

So, if I have two events:

- Event A: Rolling a number greater than 3. P(A) = 3/6 = 0.5
- Event B: Rolling two even numbers in a row. P(B) = (3/6) * (3/6) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

So, how much more likely is A than B? So, we can compute the ratio of their probabilities.

P(A) / P(B) = 0.5 / 0.25 = 2

So, the probability of A is twice that of B, which means A is 100% more likely than B. Because if something is twice as likely, it's 100% more likely than the original.

So, yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 100%.

But just to be thorough, let me think through an example. Suppose we roll the die multiple times. Let's say we roll it 100 times.

For Event A, we would expect about 50 times (since 50% chance). For Event B, we would expect about 25 times (since 25% chance). So, in 100 trials, Event A happens 50 times, which is 25 more times than Event B. So, 25 more times is a 25% increase over Event B's 25 times? Wait, no.

Wait, hold on. If Event B is 25 times, and Event A is 50 times, then how much more likely is A than B?

It's 25 more times, which is 25% more than 25? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 25 more times is 100% more than 25.

Wait, no, 25 more is 100% more of the original 25. Because 25 is 100% of 25, so 25 more is 100% more, which brings it up to 50.

So, in terms of frequency, A is 100% more frequent than B.

So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, I think my reasoning is sound.

So, summarizing:

- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50%
- Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 25%
- Difference in probabilities: 25%
- To find how much more likely A is than B, compute (P(A) - P(B)) / P(B) * 100% = (50% - 25%) / 25% * 100% = 100%

Therefore, Jerry is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

**Final Answer**
The likelihood is \boxed{100\%} more for rolling a number greater than 3.
</think>

First, we determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, which gives us 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is:

\[
P_1 = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 50\%
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6, giving us 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities:

\[
P_2 = \left(\frac{3}{6}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{6}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 25\%
\]

To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we calculate the difference in their probabilities and express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:

\[
\text{Difference} = P_1 - P_2 = 50\% - 25\% = 25\%
\]

\[
\text{Percentage more likely} = \left(\frac{25\%}{25\%}\right) \times 100\% = 100\%
\]

Thus, the likelihood is \boxed{100\%} more for rolling a number greater than 3.
