Question:
Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, and then started and finished another 500 piece puzzle within an hour.  How many puzzle pieces did Teddy place during that hour?

Correct Answer:
Teddy did 1/2 * 500 pieces = <<500/2=250>>250 pieces.
Teddy completed 250 pieces + 500 pieces = <<250+500=750>>750 pieces.
#### 750

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, and then started and finished another 500 piece puzzle within an hour. How many puzzle pieces did Teddy place during that hour? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. Teddy worked on two puzzles: the first one was a 500-piece puzzle, and he finished half of it. Then, he started another 500-piece puzzle and finished it within an hour. So, the question is asking how many pieces he placed during that specific hour.

Wait, so it's specifically asking about the number of pieces he placed during that one-hour period. That means we need to focus on the second puzzle, the 500-piece one, because he finished that within an hour. The first puzzle, which he had already completed half, doesn't affect the count during that hour because he was working on the second one then.

Let me break it down. First, he did half of a 500-piece puzzle. Half of 500 is 250. So, he placed 250 pieces from the first puzzle. Then, he started another 500-piece puzzle and finished it in an hour. So, he placed all 500 pieces from the second puzzle in that hour. Therefore, the total number of pieces he placed during that hour is 500.

Wait, hold on. The question is a bit ambiguous. It says he finished half of a 500-piece puzzle and then started and finished another 500-piece puzzle within an hour. So, is the time frame from when he finished the first puzzle to when he finished the second one? Or is it that he worked on both puzzles, with the first one completed before starting the second one which he finished in an hour?

I think the key here is that he started and finished the second puzzle within an hour. So, the hour is the duration during which he worked on the second puzzle. Therefore, the number of pieces he placed during that hour is the total number of pieces in the second puzzle, which is 500.

But let me double-check. The first sentence says he finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, so that's 250 pieces. Then, he started another 500-piece puzzle and finished it within an hour. So, the time in question is the hour he spent on the second puzzle. So, during that hour, he placed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle. Therefore, the answer should be 500.

Alternatively, if we consider the total time he spent before the hour, he finished half of the first puzzle, but that might not be relevant here because the question is specifically about the number of pieces placed during that one-hour period.

Wait, is there any chance that the time he spent on the first puzzle affects the rate at which he worked on the second? For example, if he spent some time on the first puzzle before moving on to the second, does that mean he was slower or faster? But the problem doesn't give us any information about how long he spent on the first puzzle or his rate of working. It only tells us that he finished half of the first puzzle and then started and finished the second within an hour.

So, since we don't have any information about his prior work on the first puzzle or his speed, we can't infer anything about the second puzzle's time. So, we can assume that the second puzzle was completed in that one hour, so he placed all 500 pieces during that time.

But another way to think about it: Maybe he worked on both puzzles simultaneously? But that seems unlikely because you can't work on two puzzles at the same time unless you have multiple people. The problem says Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle and then started another 500-piece puzzle within an hour. So, he completed the first puzzle, then worked on the second one. So, he was working on the second puzzle during that hour.

So, in that hour, he placed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

Wait, hold on, no. Wait, if he finished half of the first puzzle, that took some time, and then he started the second puzzle and finished it within the same hour. So, the entire hour was spent on the second puzzle. So, he placed 500 pieces during that hour.

Alternatively, could it be that he finished half the first puzzle, which took, say, 30 minutes, and then started the second puzzle, finishing it in the remaining 30 minutes, so in that remaining 30 minutes, he only placed 250 pieces? But wait, the problem says he started and finished another 500-piece puzzle within an hour. So, "within an hour" â€“ that could mean he started it at some point within the hour and finished it before the hour ended.

Wait, but without more information, we can't really break it down into minutes. So, maybe the key is that he finished the second puzzle within an hour, so the entire 500 pieces were placed during that hour.

Also, the problem is a bit ambiguous in English, but I think the intended interpretation is that in the time he was working on the second puzzle, which was within an hour, he completed all 500 pieces. Therefore, the answer is 500.

Wait, but if he had already worked on the first puzzle, perhaps the time he spent on the second puzzle was less than an hour? But again, without knowing how much time he spent on the first puzzle, we can't know. So, the safest assumption is that he spent the entire hour on the second puzzle, so he placed all 500 pieces during that hour.

Therefore, the answer should be 500.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{500}
</think>

Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500-piece puzzle within an hour. The question is asking how many puzzle pieces he placed during that hour. 

Since he finished the second puzzle within an hour, we consider the number of pieces he placed during that specific hour. The second puzzle is a 500-piece puzzle, and he completed it within the hour. Therefore, the number of pieces he placed during that hour is 500.

\[
\boxed{500}
