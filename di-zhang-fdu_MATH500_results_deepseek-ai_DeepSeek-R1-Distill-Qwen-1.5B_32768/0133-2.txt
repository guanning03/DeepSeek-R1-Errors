Question:
For what values of $x$ is it true that $x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10$? Express your answer in interval notation.

Correct Answer:
Re-arranging, $x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0$. The left-hand quadratic factors as $x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0$. Thus, $x-7$ and $x+2$ have opposite signs, so $-2 \le x \le 7$ and $\boxed{x \in [-2,7]}$.

Gold:
x\in[-2,7]

Wrong Prediction:
[-2,7]

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I've got this inequality to solve: \( x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10 \). Hmm, okay. I remember that when dealing with quadratic inequalities, it's helpful to bring all terms to one side so that the other side is zero. That way, I can factor or use the quadratic formula if needed. Let me try that.

First, I'll subtract 10 from both sides to get:

\( x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \le 0 \)

Simplifying the left side:

\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0 \)

Okay, now I have a quadratic inequality: \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0 \). I need to find the values of x for which this inequality holds true. I recall that to solve quadratic inequalities, it's important to find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation and then determine the intervals where the quadratic expression is less than or equal to zero.

So, let me set the quadratic expression equal to zero:

\( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \)

To solve this, I can use the quadratic formula, which is:

\( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \)

In this equation, the coefficients are:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = -5 \)
- \( c = -14 \)

Plugging these into the quadratic formula:

\( x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(-14)}}{2(1)} \)

Simplifying inside the square root:

First, \( (-5)^2 = 25 \)

Then, \( 4ac = 4*1*(-14) = -56 \). But since it's subtracting that, it becomes \( 25 - (-56) \) which is \( 25 + 56 = 81 \).

So, the square root part is \( \sqrt{81} = 9 \)

Now, putting it all together:

\( x = \frac{5 \pm 9}{2} \)

So, we have two solutions:

1. \( x = \frac{5 + 9}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \)
2. \( x = \frac{5 - 9}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \)

Therefore, the roots are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). These roots divide the number line into three intervals:

1. \( (-\infty, -2) \)
2. \( (-2, 7) \)
3. \( (7, \infty) \)

Since the quadratic opens upwards (because the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive), the graph of the quadratic will be a parabola opening upwards. This means that the quadratic expression \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) will be below or equal to zero between its two roots.

So, the expression is less than or equal to zero between \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 7 \). Therefore, the solution to the inequality \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0 \) is the interval \( [-2, 7] \).

Wait, let me double-check that. If I pick a test point in each interval, does the quadratic expression satisfy the inequality?

1. Let's pick \( x = -3 \) in the interval \( (-\infty, -2) \):
   Plugging into \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \):
   \( (-3)^2 - 5*(-3) - 14 = 9 + 15 - 14 = 10 \)
   Which is greater than 0, so the inequality doesn't hold here.

2. Let's pick \( x = 0 \) in the interval \( (-2, 7) \):
   Plugging into \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \):
   \( 0 - 0 - 14 = -14 \)
   Which is less than 0, so the inequality holds here.

3. Let's pick \( x = 8 \) in the interval \( (7, \infty) \):
   Plugging into \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \):
   \( 64 - 40 - 14 = 10 \)
   Which is greater than 0, so the inequality doesn't hold here.

Okay, so that confirms that the solution is between \( -2 \) and \( 7 \), inclusive. So, writing that in interval notation, it's \( [-2, 7] \).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the quadratic formula. Let me recalculate the discriminant:

\( b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(-14) = 25 + 56 = 81 \)

Yes, that's correct. Square root of 81 is 9. So, \( x = (5 Â± 9)/2 \), so x is 7 and -2. That's correct.

And since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, so it's below zero between the roots. So yes, the solution is \( [-2, 7] \).

I think that's solid. So, the answer is \( [-2, 7] \).

**Final Answer**
The values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality are \boxed{[-2, 7]}.
</think>

To solve the inequality \( x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10 \), we first bring all terms to one side:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \le 0 \]
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0 \]

Next, we solve the corresponding quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = -14 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(-14)}}{2(1)} \]
\[ x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 56}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{5 \pm 9}{2} \]

This gives the roots:

\[ x = \frac{5 + 9}{2} = 7 \]
\[ x = \frac{5 - 9}{2} = -2 \]

The roots are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). These roots divide the number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -2) \), \( (-2, 7) \), and \( (7, \infty) \). Since the quadratic expression opens upwards (as the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive), it is negative or zero between its roots.

Thus, the solution to the inequality \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0 \) is the interval \( [-2, 7] \).

\[
\boxed{[-2, 7]}
\]
