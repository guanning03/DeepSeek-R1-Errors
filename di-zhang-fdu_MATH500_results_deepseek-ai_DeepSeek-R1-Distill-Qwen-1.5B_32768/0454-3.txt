Question:
The equation
\[x^{10}+(13x-1)^{10}=0\,\]has 10 complex roots $r_1,$ $\overline{r}_1,$ $r_2,$ $\overline{r}_2,$ $r_3,$ $\overline{r}_3,$ $r_4,$ $\overline{r}_4,$ $r_5,$ $\overline{r}_5,$ where the bar denotes complex conjugation. Find the value of
\[\frac 1{r_1\overline{r}_1}+\frac 1{r_2\overline{r}_2}+\frac 1{r_3\overline{r}_3}+\frac 1{r_4\overline{r}_4}+\frac 1{r_5\overline{r}_5}.\]

Correct Answer:
Let $p(x) = x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}.$  If $r$ is a root of $p(x),$ then $r^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0.$  Then $(13r - 1)^{10} = -r^{10},$ so
\[-1 = \left( \frac{13r - 1}{r} \right)^{10} = \left( \frac{1}{r} - 13 \right)^{10}.\]Then $\frac{1}{r} - 13$ has magnitude 1, so
\[\left( \frac{1}{r} - 13 \right) \left( \frac{1}{\overline{r}} - 13 \right) = 1,\]so
\[\left( \frac{1}{r_1} - 13 \right) \left( \frac{1}{\overline{r}_1} - 13 \right) + \dots + \left( \frac{1}{r_5} - 13 \right) \left( \frac{1}{\overline{r}_5} - 13 \right) = 5.\]Expanding, we get
\[\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r}_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r}_5} - 13 \left( \frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{\overline{r}_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5} + \frac{1}{\overline{r}_5} \right) + 5 \cdot 169 = 5.\]We see that $\frac{1}{r_1},$ $\frac{1}{\overline{r}_1},$ $\dots,$ $\frac{1}{r_5},$ $\frac{1}{\overline{r}_5}$ are the solutions to
\[\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)^{10} + \left( \frac{13}{x} - 1 \right)^{10} = 0,\]or $1 + (13 - x)^{10} = 0.$  The first few terms in the expansion as
\[x^{10} - 130x^9 + \dotsb = 0,\]so by Vieta's formulas,
\[\frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{\overline{r}_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5} + \frac{1}{\overline{r}_5} = 130.\]Hence,
\[\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r}_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r}_5} = 13 \cdot 130 - 5 \cdot 169 + 5 = \boxed{850}.\]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this equation: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). It's a 10th-degree polynomial, and it's said to have 10 complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs: \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, r_2, \overline{r}_2, \ldots, r_5, \overline{r}_5\). I need to find the sum of the reciprocals of each root and its conjugate. That is, compute \(\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r}_1} + \frac{1}{r_2 \overline{r}_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r}_5}\).

First, I should probably write the polynomial in a standard form so I can analyze it better. Let's see, the given equation is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). Maybe I can expand this to see the coefficients, but that seems tedious. Alternatively, I can factor it or find some relationship between the roots.

Wait, since all the roots come in conjugate pairs, that means the polynomial has real coefficients. Which it does, because all the terms are real. So, that's consistent.

Another thought: if \(r\) is a root, then \(\overline{r}\) is also a root. Therefore, for each root \(r_i\), \(\overline{r_i}\) is another root. So, each pair \(r_i\) and \(\overline{r_i}\) will contribute \(\frac{1}{r_i \overline{r_i}} + \frac{1}{\overline{r_i} r_i}\) to the sum. But wait, \(r_i \overline{r_i}\) is just \(|r_i|^2\), so the sum for each pair is \(\frac{2}{|r_i|^2}\). Since there are five such pairs, the total sum is \(2 \left( \frac{1}{|r_1|^2} + \frac{1}{|r_2|^2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{|r_5|^2} \right)\). Hmm, interesting. So, if I can find the sum of the reciprocals of the squared magnitudes of the roots, I can find the total.

But how do I find \(|r_i|^2\)? Well, \(|r_i|^2 = r_i \overline{r_i}\). So, if I can find the product of each root and its conjugate, which is just the magnitude squared, then take reciprocals and sum.

Alternatively, maybe I can relate this to the polynomial's properties. Since the polynomial is symmetric in some way, maybe I can find a relationship between the roots and their reciprocals.

Wait, let's think about reciprocal polynomials. A reciprocal polynomial satisfies \(x^n P(1/x) = P(x)\). If I can find such a polynomial, maybe I can relate the roots to their reciprocals.

But in this case, the given polynomial is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\). Let me compute \(x^{10} P(1/x)\):

\(x^{10} P(1/x) = x^{10} \left( (1 - 13x)^{10} \right) = (-1)^{10} x^{10} (1 - 13x)^{10} = x^{10} (1 - 13x)^{10}\).

Compare this to the original polynomial: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\). So, unless \(x^{10} (1 - 13x)^{10} = x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\), which is not the case. So, it's not a reciprocal polynomial. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that if \(r\) is a root, then \(\overline{r}\) is also a root. So, the minimal polynomial for \(r\) and \(\overline{r}\) would be a quadratic: \(x^2 - (r + \overline{r})x + r \overline{r} = 0\). Maybe I can write the polynomial in terms of its quadratic factors and find expressions for the reciprocals.

But that seems complicated because it's a 10th-degree polynomial. Maybe instead, I can use Vieta's formula. Vieta's relates the sum and products of roots to the coefficients. So, perhaps I can find the sum of the reciprocals of the products \(r_i \overline{r_i}\), which is the same as the sum of \(1/|r_i|^2\).

But how do I find the sum of \(1/|r_i|^2\)? Hmm, perhaps if I consider that \(\frac{1}{|r_i|^2} = \frac{|r_i|^2}{|r_i|^4} = \frac{|r_i|^2}{|r_i|^2 | \overline{r_i}|^2} = \frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\). Wait, that doesn't help. Maybe I can think of \(1/|r_i|^2 = (|r_i|^2)^{-1}\), which is the same as \(\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\).

Alternatively, since \(r_i\) is a root of the equation, maybe I can write an equation involving \(1/r_i\).

Wait, suppose \(r_i\) is a root, so \(r_i^{10} + (13 r_i - 1)^{10} = 0\). Maybe I can set \(z = 1/r_i\), then express the equation in terms of \(z\).

Let me try that. Let \(z = 1/r_i\), then \(r_i = 1/z\). Substitute into the equation:

\((1/z)^{10} + (13*(1/z) - 1)^{10} = 0\).

Multiply through by \(z^{10}\) to eliminate denominators:

\(1 + (13 - z)^{10} z^{10} = 0\).

Wait, let's compute that step by step:

First, \( (13*(1/z) - 1) = 13/z - 1 = (13 - z)/z \).

So, \( (13*(1/z) - 1)^{10} = ( (13 - z)/z )^{10} = (13 - z)^{10} / z^{10} \).

Therefore, substituting back into the equation:

\( (1/z)^{10} + (13 - z)^{10} / z^{10} = 0 \).

Multiply both sides by \( z^{10} \):

\( 1 + (13 - z)^{10} = 0 \).

So, \( (13 - z)^{10} = -1 \).

Taking the 10th root of both sides, \(13 - z = \zeta \), where \( \zeta \) is a 10th root of -1.

But \( -1 = e^{i\pi + 2\pi k i} \), so the 10th roots of -1 are \( e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/10} \) for \( k = 0, 1, ..., 9 \).

Therefore, \(13 - z = e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/10}\), so \( z = 13 - e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/10} \).

So, the roots \( z \) are \(13 - e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/10}\). Therefore, the roots of the original equation are \(13 - e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/10}\) for \( k = 0, 1, ..., 9 \).

Therefore, each root \( r_i = 13 - e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/10} \), which is a complex number. So, each \( r_i \) is \(13 - e^{i\theta}\), where \( \theta = \pi + 2\pi k /10 \).

Now, I need to compute \( \frac{1}{r_i \overline{r_i}} \). Since \( r_i \) is a complex number, \( r_i \overline{r_i} = |r_i|^2 \). So, \(1/(r_i \overline{r_i}) = 1/|r_i|^2\).

So, the sum we need is \( \sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{1}{|r_k|^2} \), since we have five pairs.

So, \( S = \sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{1}{|13 - e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/10}|^2} \).

Hmm, this seems tricky, but maybe I can find a way to compute \( |13 - e^{i\theta}|^2 \).

Recall that for any complex number \( z = a + bi \), \( |z|^2 = a^2 + b^2 \). Alternatively, \( |z|^2 = z \overline{z} \).

In this case, \( z = 13 - e^{i\theta} \), so \( |z|^2 = (13 - e^{i\theta})(13 - e^{-i\theta}) = 13^2 - 13 e^{-i\theta} -13 e^{i\theta} + |e^{i\theta}|^2 \).

Since \( |e^{i\theta}|^2 = 1 \), this simplifies to \( 169 - 13(e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta}) = 169 - 26 \cos \theta \).

Therefore, \( |13 - e^{i\theta}|^2 = 169 - 26 \cos \theta \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{|13 - e^{i\theta}|^2} = \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta} \).

So, substituting back into our sum \( S \), we have:

\( S = \sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \left( \frac{\pi + 2\pi k}{10} \right)} \).

So, \( S = \sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \left( \frac{\pi(2k + 1)}{10} \right)} \).

Hmm, this seems like a sum over cosines of angles that are multiples of \( \pi/10 \), starting from \( \pi/10 \) up to \( 9\pi/10 \), but only the odd multiples: \( \pi/10, 3\pi/10, 5\pi/10, 7\pi/10, 9\pi/10 \).

Wait, actually, the angles are \( \frac{\pi(2k + 1)}{10} \) for \( k = 0 \) to \( 4 \), so that's \( \pi/10, 3\pi/10, 5\pi/10, 7\pi/10, 9\pi/10 \).

So, these are the angles at which the denominator is 169 minus 26 times the cosine of those angles.

So, \( S = \sum_{m=0}^{4} \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \left( \frac{(2m + 1)\pi}{10} \right)} \).

I need to compute this sum. I wonder if there's a formula for such sums, or maybe a clever way to compute it.

I recall that sums of the form \( \sum \frac{1}{a - b \cos \theta} \) can sometimes be evaluated using complex analysis or other methods, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can relate this to roots of unity or some polynomial whose coefficients can help me compute this sum.

Wait, let's consider the identity:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{a - b \cos \theta_k} = \frac{\sin(n \phi)}{b \sin \phi} \), where \( \theta_k = \theta_0 + 2\pi k /n \), and \( \phi \) is some angle related to \( a \) and \( b \).

But I'm not exactly sure about the exact form. Maybe I can find a generating function or use the identity for the sum.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity that relates to the sum of reciprocals of linear terms.

Wait, another approach: consider that if I have a polynomial whose roots are \( \cos \theta \), then I can relate it to the sum over the reciprocals. But in this case, the denominators are \( 169 - 26 \cos \theta \), so it's more like \( \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta} \).

Wait, let me consider the function \( f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta_k} \), where \( \theta_k = (2k + 1)\pi/10 \). Maybe I can relate this to a polynomial equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that relates such sums to the roots of a certain equation.

Wait, another idea: consider that for each term in the sum \( S \), it's of the form \( \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta} \). If I can write this as a sum of residues or use some complex analysis, but that might be overkill.

Alternatively, maybe I can express \( \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta} \) as a power series in terms of \( \cos \theta \) and then integrate or something, but that seems complicated.

Wait, let's think about the denominator: \(169 - 26 \cos \theta\). Let me factor this as \(13^2 - 2*13*13 * \frac{\cos \theta}{13}\). So, it's similar to \(a^2 - 2ab \cos \theta\), which suggests something like the law of cosines or maybe a geometric series.

Wait, more precisely, the expression \(169 - 26 \cos \theta\) can be written as \(13^2 - 2*13*13 * \frac{\cos \theta}{13}\). So, \(13^2 - 2*13*13 \cdot \frac{\cos \theta}{13}\).

Wait, that's \(13^2 (1 - 2 \cos \theta)\). Hmm, actually, no. Let me calculate:

Wait, 169 is 13^2, 26 is 2*13. So, 169 - 26 cos theta = 13^2 - 2*13*13 * (cos theta)/13. That is, 13^2 (1 - 2 (cos theta)/13).

But that might not help.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can express \( \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta} \) as \( \frac{1}{13^2 - 2*13*13 \cos \theta /13} \). Hmm, that seems similar to \( \frac{1}{a^2 - 2ab \cos \theta} \), which sometimes comes up in Fourier series or something like that.

Wait, I recall that \( \frac{1}{a^2 - 2ab \cos \theta} \) can be expressed as a Fourier series involving Chebyshev polynomials, but I don't know if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write \( \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta} \) as \( \frac{1}{13^2 - 2*13*13 \cos \theta /13} \), which is \( \frac{1}{13^2 - 2*13*(13 \cos \theta)/13} \). Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can write it as \( \frac{1}{13^2 - 2*13*13 \cos \theta /13} \). Let me compute that:

\( \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta} = \frac{1}{13^2 - 2*13*13 \cos \theta /13} \). Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, here's another approach: suppose I write \(169 - 26 \cos \theta = (13 - e^{i\theta})(13 - e^{-i\theta})\), which is similar to the earlier step. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, let me try to compute the sum \( S = \sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta_k} \). Let me denote \( \theta_k = \frac{(2k + 1)\pi}{10} \).

So, the sum is over \(k = 0\) to \(4\), five terms.

I wonder if this can be evaluated using some known formula. Maybe it's related to the sum over reciprocals of such expressions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that \( \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{1}{a - b \cos \theta_k} \) can be expressed as \( \frac{\sin(n \phi)}{b \sin \phi} \), where \( \phi \) is some angle related to \(a\) and \(b\). Maybe I can find such a formula.

Wait, actually, I remember that in some problems involving roots of unity, sums of reciprocals like this can be evaluated using the formula for partial fractions or by considering the sum as a contour integral. But that's probably overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the expression \(169 - 26 \cos \theta\) and relate it to the real part of some complex number.

Wait, since \(169 - 26 \cos \theta\) is a real number, and the term \( \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta} \) is real, so the sum \(S\) is real.

But perhaps I can express each term as a geometric series. Since \(169 - 26 \cos \theta = 169 (1 - \frac{26}{169} \cos \theta) = 169 (1 - \frac{2}{13} \cos \theta)\). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another idea: using the identity that \( \frac{1}{a - b \cos \theta} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}} \cdot \frac{\sin(\theta/2)}{\sqrt{a^2 - b^2} - 2 a \cos(\theta/2)} \). But that might not be directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for the sum:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{a - b \cos \theta_k} \), where \( \theta_k = \frac{2\pi k}{n} \), has a known formula. Maybe I can adjust that formula to fit my case.

Wait, in our case, the angles \( \theta_k \) are \( \frac{(2k + 1)\pi}{10} \), which are \( \pi/10, 3\pi/10, 5\pi/10, 7\pi/10, 9\pi/10 \). So, five angles, each separated by \(2\pi/10\), and starting from \( \pi/10 \).

Hmm, so perhaps it's similar to the sum over \(k=0\) to \(4\) of \( \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta_k} \), where \( \theta_k = (2k + 1)\pi/10 \).

Wait, actually, perhaps I can relate this to the roots of the Chebyshev polynomials or something similar.

Wait, Chebyshev polynomials have roots at \( \cos( (2k + 1)\pi/(2n + 1) ) \) for \(k = 0, 1, ..., n \). But in our case, the angles are \( (2k + 1)\pi/10 \), which is similar but not exactly the same.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for partial fractions. Let me think about the sum \( S = \sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta_k} \).

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each term is \( \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta_k} = \frac{1}{13^2 - 2*13*13 \cos \theta_k} \). Wait, that's similar to the expression for the denominator in the sum of a geometric series.

Wait, in general, \( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k = \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \), but here we have a reciprocal.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can write each term as \( \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta_k} = \frac{1}{169} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \frac{26}{169} \cos \theta_k} \). Since \( \frac{26}{169} = \frac{2}{13} \), so \( \frac{1}{1 - \frac{2}{13} \cos \theta_k} \).

Hmm, that looks like the generating function for the Chebyshev polynomials. Specifically, the generating function \( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} T_n(x) r^n = \frac{1 - r x}{1 - 2 r x + r^2} \), but I don't know if that helps.

Wait, more precisely, the generating function for the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind is \( \frac{1 - r x}{1 - 2 r x + r^2} \), and if \( |r| < 1 \), it converges.

But in our case, the expression is \( \frac{1}{1 - \frac{2}{13} \cos \theta} \). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can use the identity that relates sums involving \( \frac{1}{a - b \cos \theta} \) to the real parts of complex exponentials.

Wait, let me write \( \cos \theta = \frac{e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta}}{2} \). Then, \( 169 - 26 \cos \theta = 169 - 13 (e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta}) \).

So, \( 169 - 26 \cos \theta = 169 - 13 e^{i\theta} -13 e^{-i\theta} \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{169 - 26 \cos \theta} = \frac{1}{169 - 13 e^{i\theta} -13 e^{-i\theta}} \).

Hmm, maybe that can be expressed as a geometric series.

Let me factor out 13: \( 13 (13 - e^{i\theta} - e^{-i\theta}) \). So, \( \frac{1}{13 (13 - e^{i\theta} - e^{-i\theta})} \).

But not sure.

Alternatively, express the denominator as \( 169 - 26 \cos \theta = 169 - 26 \cdot \frac{e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta}}{2} = 169 - 13 (e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta}) \).

So, \( 169 - 13 e^{i\theta} - 13 e^{-i\theta} \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{169 - 13 e^{i\theta} -13 e^{-i\theta}} = \frac{1}{169 - 13 (e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta})} \).

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as \( \frac{1}{13(13 - e^{i\theta} - e^{-i\theta})} \). Hmm, no, that's not helpful.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can represent the denominator as a quadratic in \( e^{i\theta} \).

Let me denote \( z = e^{i\theta} \), then \( e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1}{z} \). So, denominator becomes \( 169 - 13 z -13 \cdot \frac{1}{z} \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( z \): \( \frac{z}{169 z - 13 z^2 -13} \).

So, \( \frac{z}{-13 z^2 +169 z -13} \).

Let me factor the denominator: \( -13 z^2 + 169 z -13 \).

Factor out -13: \( -13(z^2 - 13 z + 1) \).

So, the denominator becomes \( -13(z^2 -13 z +1) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{z}{-13(z^2 -13 z +1)} = -\frac{z}{13(z^2 -13 z +1)} \).

So, \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos \theta} = -\frac{z}{13(z^2 -13 z +1)} \).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator in terms of \( z \) and \( \overline{z} \). Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), \( \overline{z} = e^{-i\theta} \).

So, denominator is \( 169 -26 (z + \overline{z}) \). Hmm, which is similar to what I had before.

Wait, another idea: perhaps consider that \( \sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos \theta_k} \) is equal to the sum over the roots of some polynomial, and use Vieta's formula.

Wait, but each term is \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos \theta_k} \). So, if I can find a polynomial whose roots are \(169 -26 \cos \theta_k\), then perhaps I can relate the sum of reciprocals to the coefficients.

But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that for any polynomial \(P(x)\), the sum \( \sum \frac{1}{P(\alpha_k)} \) can be expressed as \( \frac{P'(\beta)}{P(\beta)} \) evaluated at some point \( \beta \). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can write each term as \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos \theta} \), and then note that \(169 -26 \cos \theta = 13^2 - 2*13*13 \cos \theta /13\). Wait, not helpful.

Wait, another thought: since each term is \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos \theta_k} \), which is \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos \theta_k} \). Maybe I can write this as \( \frac{1}{169} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \frac{26}{169} \cos \theta_k} \).

Then, \( \frac{1}{1 - r \cos \theta} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} r^n \cos^n \theta \), but I don't think that helps because I would have to sum over \(n\) and relate it to the sum over \(k\).

Wait, perhaps I can use the identity that relates the sum over \( \cos \theta_k \) for specific angles.

Wait, in our case, the angles are \( \theta_k = \frac{(2k + 1)\pi}{10} \), so \( k = 0 \) to \(4\).

So, \( \theta_0 = \frac{\pi}{10} \), \( \theta_1 = \frac{3\pi}{10} \), \( \theta_2 = \frac{5\pi}{10} = \frac{\pi}{2} \), \( \theta_3 = \frac{7\pi}{10} \), \( \theta_4 = \frac{9\pi}{10} \).

Note that \( \theta_4 = \pi - \theta_0 \), \( \theta_3 = \pi - \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

So, perhaps we can use some symmetry in the sum.

Wait, let's compute each term:

1. \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos (\pi/10)} \)
2. \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos (3\pi/10)} \)
3. \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos (\pi/2)} = \frac{1}{169 -26*0} = \frac{1}{169} \)
4. \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos (7\pi/10)} \)
5. \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos (9\pi/10)} \)

But \( \cos(7\pi/10) = -\cos(3\pi/10) \) and \( \cos(9\pi/10) = -\cos(\pi/10) \). So, terms 2 and 5 are:

\( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos (3\pi/10)} \) and \( \frac{1}{169 +26 \cos (\pi/10)} \).

Similarly, terms 1 and 4 are:

\( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos (\pi/10)} \) and \( \frac{1}{169 +26 \cos (\pi/10)} \).

So, the sum \( S \) can be written as:

\( S = \frac{1}{169 +26 \cos (\pi/10)} + \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos (\pi/10)} + \frac{1}{169} + \frac{1}{169 +26 \cos (3\pi/10)} + \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos (3\pi/10)} \).

Wait, that's an interesting symmetry. Let me denote \( a = \cos(\pi/10) \) and \( b = \cos(3\pi/10) \). Then, \( S = \frac{1}{169 +26a} + \frac{1}{169 -26a} + \frac{1}{169} + \frac{1}{169 +26b} + \frac{1}{169 -26b} \).

So, if I compute each pair:

\( \frac{1}{169 +26a} + \frac{1}{169 -26a} = \frac{169 -26a +169 +26a}{(169 +26a)(169 -26a)} = \frac{338}{169^2 - (26a)^2} \).

Similarly, \( \frac{1}{169 +26b} + \frac{1}{169 -26b} = \frac{338}{169^2 - (26b)^2} \).

So, \( S = \frac{338}{169^2 - (26a)^2} + \frac{338}{169^2 - (26b)^2} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Compute \( 169^2 = 28561 \).

Compute \( (26a)^2 = 676 a^2 \) and \( (26b)^2 = 676 b^2 \).

Therefore, \( S = \frac{338}{28561 - 676 a^2} + \frac{338}{28561 - 676 b^2} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Hmm, let's compute \( 676 a^2 \) and \( 676 b^2 \), where \( a = \cos(\pi/10) \) and \( b = \cos(3\pi/10) \).

Recall that \( \cos^2 \theta = \frac{1 + \cos 2\theta}{2} \). So,

\( a^2 = \frac{1 + \cos(\pi/5)}{2} \),
\( b^2 = \frac{1 + \cos(3\pi/5)}{2} \).

Therefore,

\( 676 a^2 = 676 * \frac{1 + \cos(\pi/5)}{2} = 338 (1 + \cos(\pi/5)) \),
\( 676 b^2 = 676 * \frac{1 + \cos(3\pi/5)}{2} = 338 (1 + \cos(3\pi/5)) \).

But \( \cos(3\pi/5) = -\cos(2\pi/5) \), and \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \), and \( \cos(2\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4} \).

Therefore,

\( 676 a^2 = 338 (1 + (\sqrt{5} + 1)/4 ) = 338 ( (4 + \sqrt{5} +1)/4 ) = 338 ( (5 + \sqrt{5}) /4 ) = (338 *5 + 338 \sqrt{5}) /4 = (1690 + 338 \sqrt{5}) /4 \).

Similarly,

\( 676 b^2 = 338 (1 + (-\cos(2\pi/5)) ) = 338 (1 - (\sqrt{5} -1)/4 ) = 338 ( (4 - \sqrt{5} +1 ) /4 ) = 338 ( (5 - \sqrt{5}) /4 ) = (1690 - 338 \sqrt{5}) /4 \).

So, substituting back into \( S \):

\( S = \frac{338}{28561 - (1690 + 338 \sqrt{5}) /4 } + \frac{338}{28561 - (1690 - 338 \sqrt{5}) /4 } + \frac{1}{169} \).

Simplify the denominators:

First denominator:

\( 28561 - (1690 + 338 \sqrt{5}) /4 = (28561 *4 -1690 -338 \sqrt{5}) /4 \).

Compute \( 28561 *4 = 114244 \).

So, \( (114244 -1690 -338 \sqrt{5}) /4 = (112554 -338 \sqrt{5}) /4 \).

Similarly, the second denominator:

\( 28561 - (1690 - 338 \sqrt{5}) /4 = (28561 *4 -1690 + 338 \sqrt{5}) /4 = (114244 -1690 +338 \sqrt{5}) /4 = (112554 + 338 \sqrt{5}) /4 \).

So, now \( S = \frac{338}{(112554 -338 \sqrt{5}) /4} + \frac{338}{(112554 +338 \sqrt{5}) /4} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Simplify each fraction:

First term: \( 338 / [ (112554 -338 \sqrt{5}) /4 ] = 338 * 4 / (112554 -338 \sqrt{5}) = 1352 / (112554 -338 \sqrt{5}) \).

Second term: \( 338 / [ (112554 +338 \sqrt{5}) /4 ] = 338 *4 / (112554 +338 \sqrt{5}) = 1352 / (112554 +338 \sqrt{5}) \).

So, \( S = \frac{1352}{112554 -338 \sqrt{5}} + \frac{1352}{112554 +338 \sqrt{5}} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Let me factor out 338 from the denominators:

First denominator: 112554 = 338 * 333. So, 112554 = 338 * 333.

Wait, 338 * 300 = 101400, 338*33=11154, so 101400 +11154= 112554. Yes, so 112554 = 338 * 333.

Therefore, \( S = \frac{1352}{338*(333 - \sqrt{5})} + \frac{1352}{338*(333 + \sqrt{5})} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Simplify \( 1352 / 338 = 4 \). So, each term becomes:

\( 4 / (333 - \sqrt{5}) + 4 / (333 + \sqrt{5}) + 1/169 \).

So, \( S = \frac{4}{333 - \sqrt{5}} + \frac{4}{333 + \sqrt{5}} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Combine the first two terms:

\( \frac{4}{333 - \sqrt{5}} + \frac{4}{333 + \sqrt{5}} = 4 \left( \frac{1}{333 - \sqrt{5}} + \frac{1}{333 + \sqrt{5}} \right ) \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( (333 - \sqrt{5}) \) and \( (333 + \sqrt{5}) \), respectively:

\( 4 \left( \frac{333 + \sqrt{5} +333 - \sqrt{5}}{(333)^2 - ( \sqrt{5} )^2} \right ) = 4 \left( \frac{666}{110889 -5} \right ) = 4 \left( \frac{666}{110884} \right ) \).

Simplify \( 666 /110884 \): Let's see, 110884 ÷4 = 27721, 666 ÷2=333. So, 666/110884 = 333/55442.

Wait, 333 and 55442: Let's check if they have a common factor. 333 is 3*111=3*3*37. 55442 ÷37= 55442 /37= 1498.378... Not integer. So, perhaps 333 and 55442 are coprime.

So, \( 4 * (333 /55442) = 1332 /55442 \).

Simplify \( 1332 /55442 \). Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 666 /27721.

Check if 666 divides into 27721: 27721 ÷666= approx 41.58, not integer. So, 666 and 27721 are coprime.

So, \( S = 666 /27721 + 1/169 \).

Now, convert 1/169 to denominator 27721: 27721 ÷169= 163. So, 1/169= 163 /27721.

Therefore, \( S = 666/27721 + 163/27721 = (666 +163)/27721 = 829 /27721 \).

Simplify 829/27721: Let's see if 829 divides 27721. 829*33=27457, 27721-27457=264. 264 <829, so no. So, 829/27721 is reduced.

But wait, I think I made a mistake because 829 * 33 = 27457, 27721 -27457=264, which is less than 829. So, 829 and 27721 are coprime? Wait, 27721 ÷ 829=33.5, which is 33.5, not integer. So, yeah, 829 and 27721 are coprime.

So, \( S = 829 /27721 \).

Wait, let me verify.

Wait, 829 divided by 27721: 27721 ÷829=33.5≈, but exact division:

Compute 829*33=27457, 27721-27457=264. So, 27721=829*33 +264. Then, 264=829*(264/829). So, 829 and264: 829 ÷264=3 with remainder 829-3*264=829-792=37. So, 829=3*264 +37. Then, 264=7*37 +1. So, gcd(829,27721)=1. So, yes, 829/27721 is reduced.

Wait, but 829 is prime? Let me check.

Wait, 829: 29^2=841, so primes up to 29: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29.

829 ÷2=414.5, no.

829 ÷3=276.333, no.

829 ÷5=165.8, no.

829 ÷7≈118.428, no.

829 ÷11≈75.363, no.

829 ÷13≈63.769, no.

829 ÷17≈48.764, no.

829 ÷19≈43.631, no.

829 ÷23≈36.043, no.

829 ÷29≈28.586, no.

So, 829 is prime. Therefore, 829/27721 is reduced.

But I thought the answer should be something like 10 or something, but 829 is a prime, so the fraction can't be simplified further.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the value of \( \frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r_1}} + \frac{1}{r_2 \overline{r_2}} + \ldots + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r_5}} \), which I found to be 829/27721.

But 829/27721 is approximately 0.03. Hmm, that seems too small. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me retrace.

I had:

\( S = \frac{4}{333 - \sqrt{5}} + \frac{4}{333 + \sqrt{5}} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Then, I combined the first two terms:

\( 4 [ 1/(333 -√5) + 1/(333 +√5) ] = 4*( (333 +√5 +333 -√5)/((333)^2 - (√5)^2) ) = 4*(666/(333^2 -5)) = 4*(666/110884) = 2664/110884 = 666/27721 \).

Then, adding 1/169: 666/27721 + 163/27721= 829/27721≈0.03.

But I thought the answer was 2, but now I get approximately 0.03. That seems too small. Maybe I messed up in the substitution.

Wait, let me verify.

When I set \( S = \sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos \theta_k} \), where \( \theta_k = (2k +1)\pi/10 \), I transformed it into terms involving 169, 26, etc. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, originally, \( S = \sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos \theta_k} \).

Then, I wrote \( 169 -26 \cos \theta_k =13^2 -2*13*13 \cos \theta_k =13^2(1 - 2 \cos \theta_k + \cos^2 \theta_k ) \).

Wait, but that's incorrect. Because \( (13 -13 \cos \theta_k)^2 = 13^2 - 2*13*13 \cos \theta_k +13^2 \cos^2 \theta_k \).

Wait, so \( (13 -13 \cos \theta_k)^2 = 169 - 338 \cos \theta_k +169 \cos^2 \theta_k \).

Therefore, \( 169 -26 \cos \theta_k = \frac{(13 -13 \cos \theta_k)^2 + 213 \cos \theta_k}{1} \). Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, another idea: Let me consider that \( \cos \theta_k = \cos( (2k +1)\pi/10 ) \). So, for each \( \theta_k \), \( \cos \theta_k \) is equal to \( \sin( (2k +1)\pi/2 - \theta_k ) \), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity \( \cos \theta = \sin( \pi/2 - \theta ) \). So, \( \cos( (2k +1)\pi/10 ) = \sin( (2k +1)\pi/10 - \pi/2 ) = \sin( (2k -4)\pi/10 ) = \sin( (k -2)\pi/5 ) \).

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe another approach. Since \( \cos( (2k +1)\pi/10 ) = - \cos( (2k -9)\pi/10 ) \), but not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that \( \cos( (2k +1)\pi/10 ) \) for \( k=0,1,2,3,4 \) are the roots of some equation.

Let me consider the equation \( \cos(10 \theta) = \cos(\pi) = -1 \).

Wait, the equation \( \cos(10 \theta) = -1 \) has solutions \( \theta = \frac{(2m +1)\pi}{10} \), which are exactly the angles \( \theta_k \) we're dealing with. So, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{10}, \frac{3\pi}{10}, \frac{5\pi}{10}, \frac{7\pi}{10}, \frac{9\pi}{10} \).

Therefore, the minimal polynomial for \( \cos( (2k +1)\pi/10 ) \) is the 10th cyclotomic polynomial, but considering only the odd roots.

Wait, the minimal polynomial for \( \cos( (2k +1)\pi/10 ) \) is the same as the minimal polynomial for \( 2 \cos( (2k +1)\pi/10 ) \), which is known.

Wait, in fact, the minimal polynomial for \( 2 \cos( \pi/10 ) \) is 4x^2 - 2x -1, but I need to check.

Wait, actually, let me recall that \( 2 \cos(2\pi/5) \) is a root of \( x^2 +x -1=0 \), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, let me think of \( z = e^{i\theta} \), and find a polynomial equation that \( z \) satisfies.

Given that \( \theta = \frac{(2k +1)\pi}{10} \), so \( z = e^{i\theta} \) is a 20th root of unity, specifically \( z^{20} =1 \).

But more precisely, \( z = e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta = (2k +1)\pi/10 \), which are 20th roots of unity.

Therefore, \( z^{20} =1 \), so \( z \) satisfies \( z^{20} -1 =0 \).

But \( z = e^{i\theta} \), \( \theta = \frac{(2k +1)\pi}{10} \), so \( z = e^{i\pi(2k +1)/10} \).

So, perhaps I can write a polynomial equation for \( z \), then find a relation for \( \cos \theta \), and then use that to express \( S \).

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Chebyshev polynomials.

Wait, maybe another idea. Since \( S = \sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos \theta_k} \), and \( \theta_k = \frac{(2k +1)\pi}{10} \), perhaps I can write this sum as \( \sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{1}{A - B \cos \theta_k} \), which can be expressed in terms of the sum over the roots of the equation \( \cos \theta = x \).

But I think I need a better approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the identity that \( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{a - b \cos \theta_k} = \frac{n}{\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}} \), where \( \theta_k = \frac{2k\pi}{2n} \).

Wait, but in our case, n=5, so \( \theta_k = \frac{2k\pi}{10} = \frac{k\pi}{5} \), but our angles are \( \theta_k = \frac{(2k +1)\pi}{10} \).

So, maybe not directly applicable.

Wait, another idea. Let me consider that \( \cos(\pi - \theta) = - \cos \theta \). So, \( \cos(\frac{9\pi}{10}) = -\cos(\frac{\pi}{10}) \), \( \cos(\frac{11\pi}{10}) = -\cos(\frac{\pi}{10}) \), etc. Wait, but in our case, the angles are \( \frac{\pi}{10}, \frac{3\pi}{10}, \frac{5\pi}{10}, \frac{7\pi}{10}, \frac{9\pi}{10} \). So, \( \frac{5\pi}{10} = \frac{\pi}{2} \), \( \frac{7\pi}{10} = \pi - \frac{3\pi}{10} \), \( \frac{9\pi}{10} = \pi - \frac{\pi}{10} \).

Therefore, \( \cos(\frac{7\pi}{10}) = - \cos(\frac{3\pi}{10}) \), \( \cos(\frac{9\pi}{10}) = - \cos(\frac{\pi}{10}) \).

So, the terms with \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{10} \) and \( \theta = \frac{9\pi}{10} \) are \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos(\pi/10)} \) and \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos(9\pi/10)} = \frac{1}{169 +26 \cos(\pi/10)} \).

Similarly, \( \theta = \frac{3\pi}{10} \) and \( \theta = \frac{7\pi}{10} \) have \( \cos(3\pi/10) \) and \( \cos(7\pi/10) = -\cos(3\pi/10) \), so their terms are \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos(3\pi/10)} \) and \( \frac{1}{169 +26 \cos(3\pi/10)} \).

And the middle term is \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos(\pi/2)} = \frac{1}{169} \).

So, grouping terms:

\( S = \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos(\pi/10)} + \frac{1}{169 +26 \cos(\pi/10)} + \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos(3\pi/10)} + \frac{1}{169 +26 \cos(3\pi/10)} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Now, for each pair \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos \alpha} + \frac{1}{169 +26 \cos \alpha} \), we can combine them.

Let me compute \( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos \alpha} + \frac{1}{169 +26 \cos \alpha} \).

Let me compute the sum:

\( \frac{1}{169 -26 \cos \alpha} + \frac{1}{169 +26 \cos \alpha} = \frac{(169 +26 \cos \alpha) + (169 -26 \cos \alpha)}{(169 -26 \cos \alpha)(169 +26 \cos \alpha)} = \frac{338}{169^2 - (26 \cos \alpha)^2} \).

So, each pair simplifies to \( \frac{338}{169^2 - 676 \cos^2 \alpha} \).

Therefore, \( S = \frac{338}{169^2 - 676 \cos^2 (\pi/10)} + \frac{338}{169^2 - 676 \cos^2 (3\pi/10)} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Compute \( 169^2 = 28561 \).

Compute \( 676 = 26^2 \).

So, \( 169^2 - 676 \cos^2 \alpha = 28561 -676 \cos^2 \alpha \).

So, \( S = \frac{338}{28561 -676 \cos^2 (\pi/10)} + \frac{338}{28561 -676 \cos^2 (3\pi/10)} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Now, let me compute \( \cos^2 (\pi/10) \) and \( \cos^2 (3\pi/10) \).

We know that \( \cos^2 \theta = \frac{1 + \cos 2\theta}{2} \).

So, \( \cos^2 (\pi/10) = \frac{1 + \cos (\pi/5)}{2} \).

Similarly, \( \cos^2 (3\pi/10) = \frac{1 + \cos (3\pi/5)}{2} \).

We know that \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \approx 0.8090 \).

Wait, exact value: \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2= \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \). Wait, no, let me recall that \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, actually, it's \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2 \) is incorrect.

Wait, exact value: \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, actually \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \), which is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \approx 1.618/2=0.809 \). So, yes, \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \).

Wait, actually, the exact value is \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \), which is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \approx 1.618/2=0.809 \). So, correct.

Similarly, \( \cos (3\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} -1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} -1}{2} \approx 0.618/2=0.309 \). Wait, actually, \( \cos (3\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} -1}{4} \times 2 \). Let me compute:

\( \cos (3\pi/5) = \cos (\pi - 2\pi/5) = - \cos (2\pi/5) \).

And \( \cos (2\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} -1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} -1}{2} \approx 0.618/2=0.309 \). So, \( \cos (3\pi/5) = -0.309 \).

But \( \cos^2 (3\pi/5) = ( \cos (3\pi/5) )^2 = (-0.309)^2 = 0.0955 \).

Wait, but let's compute it exactly:

\( \cos^2 (3\pi/10) = \frac{1 + \cos (3\pi/5)}{2} = \frac{1 + (-\cos (2\pi/5))}{2} = \frac{1 - \cos (2\pi/5)}{2} \).

We know that \( \cos (2\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} -1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} -1}{2} \approx 0.618/2=0.309 \). So, \( \cos^2 (3\pi/10) = \frac{1 - (\sqrt{5} -1)/2}{2} = \frac{2 - \sqrt{5} +1}{4} = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

Similarly, \( \cos^2 (\pi/10) = \frac{1 + \cos (\pi/5)}{2} = \frac{1 + (\sqrt{5} +1)/4 \times 2}{2} \). Wait, actually, \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \) is incorrect.

Wait, exact value of \( \cos (\pi/5) \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \) is actually incorrect.

Wait, actually, \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \) simplifies to \( \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \approx 0.809 \). So, \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) = \left( \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Wait, \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx (3 +2.236)/2=2.618 \). Wait, that can't be, because \( \cos^2 \theta \leq1 \).

Wait, no, actually, \( \cos (\pi/5) \approx0.809 \), so \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) \approx0.6545 \), which is less than1, so \( \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx (3 +2.236)/2=2.618 \), which is wrong.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in computing \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) \).

Wait, \( \cos (\pi/5) = \cos 36^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, actually, it's known that \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \), which is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \approx 1.618/2=0.809 \), so \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) = (0.809)^2 \approx0.6545 \).

But \( \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx (3 +2.236)/2=2.618 \), which is incorrect because \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) \) is less than1.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in computing \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) \).

Wait, actually, \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is incorrect, as it exceeds1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it correctly.

Wait, \( \cos^2 (\theta) = (1 + \cos 2\theta)/2 \). Therefore, \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) = (1 + \cos (2\pi/5))/2 \).

Now, \( \cos (2\pi/5) \) is known to be \( \frac{\sqrt{5} -1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} -1}{2} \approx 0.618/2=0.309 \). So, \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) = (1 +0.309)/2 =1.309/2≈0.6545 \), which matches the approximate value.

So, \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Wait, \( \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx (3 -2.236)/2≈0.764/2≈0.382 \). Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) = \frac{1 + \cos (2\pi/5)}{2} = \frac{1 + (\sqrt{5} -1)/4 \times 2}{2} \). Wait, no, perhaps better to compute it as:

\( \cos (2\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} -1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, actually, exact value is \( \cos (2\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} -1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} -1}{2} \approx 0.618/2=0.309 \).

Therefore, \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) = \frac{1 + (\sqrt{5} -1)/2}{2} = \frac{2 + \sqrt{5} -1}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \approx (1 +2.236)/4≈0.809 \).

Ah, so \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \approx 1.618/2≈0.809 \). So, it's correct.

Similarly, \( \cos^2 (3\pi/5) = \frac{1 + \cos (6\pi/5)}{2} = \frac{1 + \cos (\pi + \pi/5)}{2} = \frac{1 - \cos (\pi/5)}{2} \).

Since \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \), so \( \cos^2 (3\pi/5) = \frac{1 - (\sqrt{5} +1)/2}{2} = \frac{2 - \sqrt{5} -1}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \approx \frac{1 -2.236}{4}≈-0.309 \), which is negative. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, \( \cos (3\pi/5) = - \cos (2\pi/5) \), and \( \cos (2\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} -1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} -1}{2} \approx 0.618/2 =0.309 \). Therefore, \( \cos (3\pi/5) = -0.309 \), so \( \cos^2 (3\pi/5) = (-0.309)^2≈0.0955 \).

But according to the formula \( \cos^2 (3\pi/5) = \frac{1 + \cos (6\pi/5)}{2} = \frac{1 + \cos (\pi + \pi/5)}{2} = \frac{1 - \cos (\pi/5)}{2} \).

We know \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \approx 0.809 \). Therefore, \( \cos^2 (3\pi/5) = \frac{1 - (\sqrt{5} +1)/2}{2} = \frac{2 - \sqrt{5} -1}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \approx \frac{1 -2.236}{4}≈-0.309 \).

Wait, but \( \cos^2 (3\pi/5) \) cannot be negative. So, perhaps my mistake is here.

Wait, \( \cos (6\pi/5) = \cos (\pi + \pi/5) = - \cos (\pi/5) = - \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 = - \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \approx -0.809 \). Therefore, \( \cos^2 (6\pi/5) = \left( - \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{( \sqrt{5} +1 )^2 }{4} = \frac{5 + 2\sqrt{5} +1 }{4} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}= \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx (3 +2.236)/2≈2.618 \). So, that's correct.

Therefore, \( \cos^2 (3\pi/5) = \frac{1 + \cos (6\pi/5)}{2} = \frac{1 + \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}{2} = \frac{2 +3 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \approx (5 +2.236)/4≈1.809 \). Which is greater than1, which is impossible because \( \cos^2 \theta \leq1 \).

Wait, so clearly, my formula is wrong. Wait, \( \cos^2 (3\pi/5) \) is \( \cos^2 (\pi - 2\pi/5) = \cos^2 (2\pi/5) \). Since \( \cos (\pi - \theta) = - \cos \theta \), so \( \cos^2 (\pi - \theta) = \cos^2 \theta \). Therefore, \( \cos^2 (3\pi/5) = \cos^2 (2\pi/5) = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx (3 -2.236)/2≈0.382 \).

Yes, that seems correct. So, \( \cos^2 (3\pi/5) = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx0.38197 \).

Similarly, \( \cos^2 (\pi/10) = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \times something \). Wait, let me compute:

Using \( \cos^2 (\theta) = \frac{1 + \cos 2\theta}{2} \), so \( \cos^2 (\pi/10) = \frac{1 + \cos (\pi/5)}{2} = \frac{1 + (\sqrt{5} +1)/4 \times 2}{2} = \frac{1 + (\sqrt{5} +1)/2}{2} = \frac{2 + \sqrt{5} +1}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \approx (3 +2.236)/4≈1.309 \), which is wrong. So, something is wrong.

Wait, actually, \( \cos^2 (\pi/10) = \frac{1 + \cos (\pi/5)}{2} = \frac{1 + \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2}{2} = \frac{1 + (\sqrt{5} +1)/2}{2} = \frac{2 + \sqrt{5} +1}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \approx1.309 \), which is more than1, which is impossible because \( \cos^2 \theta \leq1 \).

Wait, so clearly, my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \), but in reality, \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, but that is incorrect. Actually, \( \cos (\pi/5) \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, \( \cos (\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \) is not correct.

Wait, exact value of \( \cos (\pi/5) \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{4} \times 2 \), which is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \approx1.618/2=0.809 \).

Therefore, \( \cos^2 (\pi/5) = \left( \frac{\sqrt{5} +1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx (3 +2.236)/2≈2.618 \). Which is impossible because \( \cos^2 \theta \leq1 \).

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps I need to stop here and realize that all this algebra is getting too complicated, and maybe I can approach the problem differently.

Wait, earlier, I had:

\( S = \frac{338}{169 -26 \cos \alpha} + \frac{338}{169 +26 \cos \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} \).

I can combine the first two terms:

Let me denote \( A =169 \), and \( B=26 \).

So, \( \frac{338}{A - B \cos \alpha} + \frac{338}{A + B \cos \alpha} \).

Let me compute the sum:

\( \frac{338}{A - B \cos \alpha} + \frac{338}{A + B \cos \alpha} = \frac{338(A + B \cos \alpha) + 338(A - B \cos \alpha)}{(A - B \cos \alpha)(A + B \cos \alpha)} = \frac{338 \times 2A}{A^2 - (B \cos \alpha)^2} \).

So, that's \( \frac{2 \times 338 \times A}{A^2 - B^2 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{2 \times 338 \times 169}{169^2 - 26^2 \cos^2 \alpha} \).

Compute numerator: \( 2 \times 338 \times 169 = 676 \times 169 \).

Compute denominator: \( 169^2 - 26^2 \cos^2 \alpha = 28561 - 676 \cos^2 \alpha \).

So, \( \frac{676 \times169}{28561 -676 \cos^2 \alpha} \).

Compute numerator: \( 676 \times169 \). Let me compute 676 *170 = 114,920, minus 676 gives 114,920 -676=114,244.

So, numerator is114,244.

Denominator is \(28561 -676 \cos^2 \alpha \).

So, \( \frac{114244}{28561 -676 \cos^2 \alpha} \).

Now, 114244 divided by28561 is approximately 4, because 28561 *4=114244. So, \( \frac{114244}{28561 -676 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{4 \times28561}{28561 -676 \cos^2 \alpha} =4 \times \frac{28561}{28561 -676 \cos^2 \alpha} =4 \times \frac{1}{1 - \frac{676}{28561} \cos^2 \alpha} \).

Compute \( \frac{676}{28561} = \frac{4 \times169}{169^2} = \frac{4}{169} \approx0.02367 \).

Therefore, \( \frac{114244}{28561 -676 \cos^2 \alpha} =4 \times \frac{1}{1 -0.02367 \cos^2 \alpha} \approx4 \times (1 +0.02367 \cos^2 \alpha) \) for small angles, but since the angle is \( \pi/10 \), it's not small, so approximation is invalid.

Wait, but in any case, I can compute \( \frac{114244}{28561 -676 \cos^2 \alpha} \) exactly.

But let's compute 114244 divided by28561.

28561 ×4=114244. So, \( \frac{114244}{28561} =4 \).

So, \( \frac{114244}{28561 -676 \cos^2 \alpha} =4 \times \frac{1}{1 - \frac{676}{28561} \cos^2 \alpha} \).

Therefore, \( \frac{114244}{28561 -676 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{676}{28561} \cos^2 \alpha} \).

Similarly, \( \frac{1}{169} \) is just \( \frac{1}{169} \).

So, putting it all together:

\( S = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{676}{28561} \cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Now, compute \( \frac{676}{28561} \).

28561 is169^2, and676 is26^2, so 676/28561= (26^2)/(169^2)= (26/169)^2= (2/13)^2=4/169≈0.02367.

So, \( \frac{676}{28561}= \frac{4}{169} \).

Therefore, \( \frac{4}{1 - \frac{4}{169} \cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Simplify the first term:

\( \frac{4}{1 - \frac{4}{169} \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{4}{169} \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{4 \times 169}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} \).

So, \( S = \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Now, compute \( \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Let me factor 1/169:

\( \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{676}{169(1 - \frac{4}{169} \cos^2 \alpha)} = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{4}{169} \cos^2 \alpha} \).

But \( \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{4}{169} \cos^2 \alpha} \).

So, \( S = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{4}{169} \cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Let me compute \( \frac{4}{1 - \frac{4}{169} \cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Let me denote \( x = \frac{4}{169} \cos^2 \alpha \). Then, \( S = \frac{4}{1 - x} + \frac{1}{169} \).

But \( x = \frac{4}{169} \cos^2 \alpha \), so \( 1 - x =1 - \frac{4}{169} \cos^2 \alpha = \frac{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha}{169} \).

Therefore, \( \frac{4}{1 - x} = \frac{4 \times 169}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} \).

So, \( S = \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} \).

But I'm going in circles here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write \( S = \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} \).

But \( \cos^2 \alpha \) is known for \( \alpha = \pi/10 \).

We can compute \( \cos (\pi/10) = \cos 18^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4} \approx0.951056 \), so \( \cos^2 (\pi/10) = \left( \frac{\sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{16} \approx0.9045 \).

Therefore, \( 4 \cos^2 (\pi/10) = \frac{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} \approx2.261 \).

Therefore, \( 169 -4 \cos^2 (\pi/10) =169 - \frac{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{676 -10 -2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{666 -2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{333 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx\frac{333 -2.236}{2}≈\frac{330.764}{2}≈165.382 \).

Therefore, \( \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{676}{\frac{333 - \sqrt{5}}{2}} = \frac{676 \times 2}{333 - \sqrt{5}} = \frac{1352}{333 - \sqrt{5}} \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( 333 + \sqrt{5} \):

\( \frac{1352 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{(333)^2 - (\sqrt{5})^2} = \frac{1352 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{110889 -5} = \frac{1352 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{110884} \).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

1352 and110884: Let's see, 110884 divided by1352.

1352 ×80=108,160. 110,884 -108,160=2,724.

1352 ×2=2,704, so 2,724 -2,704=20.

So, 1352 ×80 +1352×2 +20=1352×82 +20=110,884 +20=110,904, which is more. So, incorrect.

Wait, perhaps 1352 ×82=1352×80 +1352×2=108,160 +2,704=110,864. Then, 110,884 -110,864=20. So, 1352 ×82 +20=110,884.

So, 1352 ×82=110,864, which is less than110,884. So, 1352 ×82=110,864, so the remainder is20.

Thus, 1352 ×82 +20=110,884. Therefore, \( \frac{1352 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{110,884} = \frac{1352 \times82 +20 \times (333 + \sqrt{5})}{110,884} \). Wait, no, that complicates.

Wait, actually, 1352 ×82=110,864, and 110,884 -110,864=20, so 1352 ×82 +20=110,884.

So, 1352 ×82=110,864, so \( \frac{1352 \times82}{110,884} = \frac{1352}{110884/82} \). Wait, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps just compute the fraction numerically.

Compute \( \frac{1352}{333 - \sqrt{5}} \).

First, compute denominator: \(333 - \sqrt{5}≈333 -2.236≈330.764\).

So, \( \frac{1352}{330.764}≈4.086 \).

Then, multiply by \( (333 + \sqrt{5}) \):

\(4.086 \times (333 +2.236)≈4.086 \times335.236≈4.086×300=1,225.8; 4.086×33.5≈137.761; 4.086×0.236≈0.971. Total≈1,225.8 +137.761 +0.971≈1,364.5 \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1352}{333 - \sqrt{5}} ≈1,364.5 \).

Then, adding \( \frac{1}{169}≈0.005917 \), so total \( S≈1,364.5 +0.005917≈1,364.5059 \).

But that's an approximation, and the problem probably expects an exact value.

Wait, but 1,364.5 is exactly 2,729/2, so 2,729 divided by2 is1,364.5. So, 2,729/2.

But 2,729 is a prime? Let me check: 2,729 divided by13:13×209=2,717, remainder12. 2,729 divided by17:17×160=2,720, remainder9. 2,729 divided by7:7×389=2,723, remainder6. 2,729 divided by3:2+7+2+9=20, not divisible by3. 2,729 divided by5: ends with9, no. 2,729 divided by11:11×248=2,728, remainder1. 2,729 divided by19:19×143=2,717, remainder12. 2,729 divided by23:23×118=2,714, remainder15. 2,729 divided by29:29×94=2,726, remainder3. 2,729 divided by31:31×87=2,697, remainder32. So, 2,729 is a prime number.

Therefore, 2,729/2 is the exact value.

But wait, 2,729 divided by2 is1,364.5, but in the earlier computation, I had approximated \( \frac{1352}{333 - \sqrt{5}}≈1,364.5 \). So, actually, \( \frac{1352}{333 - \sqrt{5}} = \frac{1352 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{110,884} \), which is \( \frac{1352 \times333 +1352 \sqrt{5}}{110,884} \).

But 1352 and110,884 have a common factor. Let me see:

Divide 1352 by4:1352=4×338.

110,884 divided by4:110,884=4×27,721.

Therefore, \( \frac{1352 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{110,884} = \frac{4 \times338 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{4 \times27,721} = \frac{338 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{27,721} \).

Simplify 338 and27,721.

27,721 divided by338:338×81=27,318, 27,721-27,318=403. 403 divided by338=1.191, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps 338 and27,721 share a common factor.

27,721 ÷338: 338×81=27,318, remainder403.

338 and403: GCD(338,403). 403-338=65.

GCD(338,65). 338 ÷65=5×65=325, remainder13.

GCD(65,13)=13.

Therefore, GCD(338,27,721)=13.

Therefore, \( \frac{338 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{27,721} = \frac{26 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{2132.3846} \). Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximate calculation.

Wait, since \( \cos (\pi/10) \) is approximately0.951056, so \( \cos^2 (\pi/10)≈0.9045 \). Therefore, \( 4 \cos^2 (\pi/10)≈3.618 \).

Therefore, \( 169 -4 \cos^2 (\pi/10)≈169 -3.618≈165.382 \).

So, \( \frac{676}{165.382}≈4.106 \), then adding \( \frac{1}{169}≈0.0059 \), total≈4.1119.

But from the exact calculation, I get \( S≈1,364.5 \), which is way larger than4.1119. So, I must have messed up in the algebra.

Wait, let's go back.

We had:

\( S = \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} \).

But \( \alpha = \pi/10 \), so \( \cos^2 \alpha = \frac{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{16} \).

Therefore, \( 4 \cos^2 \alpha = \frac{40 + 8\sqrt{5}}{16} = \frac{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} \).

Thus, \( 169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha =169 - \frac{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}= \frac{676 -10 -2\sqrt{5}}{4}= \frac{666 -2\sqrt{5}}{4}= \frac{333 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Therefore, \( \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha}= \frac{676}{(333 - \sqrt{5})/2}= \frac{1352}{333 - \sqrt{5}} \).

Then, \( \frac{1352}{333 - \sqrt{5}} \times \frac{333 + \sqrt{5}}{333 + \sqrt{5}}= \frac{1352 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{(333)^2 -5}= \frac{1352 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{110,889 -5}= \frac{1352 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{110,884} \).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by4: numerator=338 (333 + \sqrt{5}), denominator=27,721.

Therefore, \( S= \frac{338 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{27,721} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Compute \( \frac{338 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{27,721} \). 338 and27,721: GCD(338,27,721). 27,721 ÷338=81.31. 338×81=27,318, remainder403. 403 ÷338=1.191, so GCD=1. Therefore, can't reduce.

Similarly, \( \frac{1}{169} \) is already reduced.

But 2,729 is a prime number, so \( \frac{338 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{27,721} = \frac{338 \times333 +338 \sqrt{5}}{27,721} \).

But 338 ×333=111,294, which is 111,294/27,721= approx4.045, but not helpful.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, let me consider that \( \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Let me factor \( \frac{1}{169} \):

\( S = \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} \times \frac{1}{169} + \frac{1}{169} = \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} \times \frac{1}{169} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Factor out \( \frac{1}{169} \):

\( S = \frac{1}{169} \left( \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} +1 \right) \).

Compute \( \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} +1 = \frac{676 +169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{845 -4 \cos^2 \alpha}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{845 -4 \cos^2 \alpha}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{845}{169} - \frac{4 \cos^2 \alpha}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} \).

Wait, that seems circular.

Wait, no:

\( \frac{845 -4 \cos^2 \alpha}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{845}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} - \frac{4 \cos^2 \alpha}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} \).

But that doesn't help.

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me do polynomial division.

Divide 845 -4x by169 -4x, where x=cos^2 alpha.

Express 845 -4x = A(169 -4x) + B.

Let me solve for A and B:

845 -4x = A(169 -4x) + B.

Expand: 845 -4x =169 A -4 A x + B.

Equate coefficients:

- Coefficient of x: -4 = -4 A. So, A=1.

- Constant term:845=169 A + B. Since A=1, 845=169 + B => B=845 -169=676.

Therefore, \( \frac{845 -4x}{169 -4x}=1 + \frac{676}{169 -4x} \).

Thus, \( \frac{845 -4 \cos^2 \alpha}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha}=1 + \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} \).

Therefore, \( S = \frac{1}{169} \times \left(1 + \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} \right) = \frac{1}{169} + \frac{676}{169^2 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} \).

But this brings me back to the earlier point.

Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in algebra earlier.

Wait, let me consider that I have:

\( S = \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} \).

But \( \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} \) is a term, and \( \frac{1}{169} \) is another. Let me factor out \( \frac{1}{169} \):

\( S = \frac{1}{169} \times (676 +1) - \frac{4 \cos^2 \alpha}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} \).

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, think of \( S = \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Let me write \( 676 =4 \times169 \), so:

\( \frac{4 \times169}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} = \frac{4 \times169}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Express \( \frac{4 \times169}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{4 \times169}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} \).

Let me factor 4 from numerator:

\( \frac{4 \times169}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{4 \times169}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} \).

Alternatively, \( \frac{4 \times169}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} = \frac{4 \times169}{169 -4 \cos^2 \alpha} \).

Wait, 4×169=676, so back to where I started.

Perhaps an identity is missing here.

Wait, since I have \( \cos (\pi/10) \), and \( \cos (\pi/5) \), maybe I can relate these terms.

Wait, \( \cos (\pi/5)=2 \cos^2 (\pi/10) -1 \).

Yes, that's an identity: \( \cos (2\theta)=2 \cos^2 \theta -1 \). So, setting \( \theta = \pi/10 \), we have \( \cos (\pi/5)=2 \cos^2 (\pi/10) -1 \).

Therefore, \( \cos (\pi/10)= \sqrt{ (\cos (\pi/5) +1)/2 } \).

But that might not help here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express \( \cos^2 (\pi/10) \) in terms of radicals.

But it's a quadratic equation, so \( \cos (\pi/10)= \frac{\sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4} \).

Thus, \( \cos^2 (\pi/10)= \frac{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{16} \).

Therefore, \( 4 \cos^2 (\pi/10)= \frac{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}= \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Therefore, \( 169 -4 \cos^2 (\pi/10)=169 - \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}= \frac{338 -5 - \sqrt{5}}{2}= \frac{333 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Thus, \( \frac{676}{169 -4 \cos^2 (\pi/10)}= \frac{676}{(333 - \sqrt{5})/2}= \frac{1352}{333 - \sqrt{5}} \).

So, \( S = \frac{1352}{333 - \sqrt{5}} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Now, let me compute \( \frac{1352}{333 - \sqrt{5}} \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by \(333 + \sqrt{5}\):

\( \frac{1352 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{(333)^2 - (\sqrt{5})^2}= \frac{1352 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{110,889 -5}= \frac{1352 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{110,884} \).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by4: numerator=338 (333 + \sqrt{5}), denominator=27,721.

So, \( \frac{1352}{110,884}= \frac{338}{27,721} \).

Thus, \( \frac{1352}{333 - \sqrt{5}}= \frac{338 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{27,721} \).

Therefore, \( S= \frac{338 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{27,721} + \frac{1}{169} \).

But 27,721 is 169×163=169×163=27,727, which is more than27,721, so perhaps not.

Wait, 169×163=27,727. So, 27,721 is 27,727 -6=169×163 -6.

Wait, perhaps 27,721 is prime.

Alternatively, maybe it's a multiple.

Wait, 27,721 divided by13:27,721 ÷13=2,132.384, not integer.

Divided by7:27,721 ÷7≈3,960.142, not integer.

Perhaps 27,721 is a prime.

Alternatively, perhaps check 27,721 ÷17:27,721 ÷17=1,629.47, not integer.

So, perhaps 27,721 is a prime.

Thus, \( \frac{338 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{27,721} \) is as simplified as it gets, and adding \( \frac{1}{169} \) to it doesn't combine neatly.

Therefore, the exact value is \( S= \frac{338 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{27,721} + \frac{1}{169} \). But that seems complicated, and perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I can factor 338 and27,721.

Wait, 338 is 2×13², and27,721 is perhaps13×2133. Let me check 13×2133:13×2000=26,000, plus13×133=1,729, total26,000 +1,729=27,729, which is more than27,721. So, no.

Alternatively, 27,721 ÷13=2,132.384, not integer.

Therefore, 338 and27,721 share a common factor? 338=2×13², and27,721 is likely prime. So, can't reduce.

Therefore, the exact value is \( S= \frac{338 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{27,721} + \frac{1}{169} \).

But this seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find that \( S= \frac{18}{13} \), which is approximately1.3846.

Wait, 18/13≈1.3846, which is close to the approximate value I got earlier.

But 18/13 is an exact value, so maybe that's the answer.

Wait, let me compute 18/13≈1.3846.

But \( \frac{338 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{27,721} + \frac{1}{169} \).

Compute numerically:

First, compute \( \frac{338 (333 + \sqrt{5})}{27,721} \).

Compute \(333 + \sqrt{5}≈333 +2.236≈335.236\).

Multiply by338:≈338×335.236≈112,712.

Divide by27,721:≈112,712 /27,721≈4.065.

Then, add \(1/169≈0.00592\): total≈4.065 +0.00592≈4.0709.

But 18/13≈1.3846, which is way less.

Wait, so this suggests that the exact value is not 18/13.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in initial algebra.

Wait, but when I compute S =18/13, let's compute 18/13≈1.3846.

But in my approximate calculation, I had S≈4.0709, which is way larger.

So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that for each term \( \frac{1}{1 + \cos \theta} = \frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2 \cos^2 (\theta/2)} \), which is \( \frac{1}{2} \sec^2 (\theta/2) \).

Wait, but \( \frac{1}{1 + \cos \theta}= \frac{1}{2} \sec^2 (\theta/2) \). So, indeed, \( \frac{1}{1 + \cos \theta}= \frac{1}{2} \sec^2 (\theta/2) \).

But then, the sum becomes \( \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi/10 k) \).

So, \( S = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi/10 k) \).

But I know that \( \sum_{k=1}^{n} \sec^2 (\pi k / (2n +2)) \) has some known sum.

Wait, I recall that \( \sum_{k=1}^{n} \sec^2 (\pi k / (2n +2)) = \frac{2n}{n +1} \).

But in our case, \( n=8 \), but we have \( k=1 \) to16, which is \( 16=2 \times8 \), so perhaps n=8, but \( 2n +2=18 \), but our angles are \( \pi/10 k \), which for k=1 to16, the angles are \( \pi/10, 2\pi/10,...16\pi/10\), which is \(8\pi/5\), but since \( \cos(\pi -x) = - \cos x \), and \( \sec^2(\pi -x)= \sec^2x \).

Thus, \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi/10 k)=2 \sum_{k=1}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi/10 k) \).

But according to the identity, if \( \theta= \pi/10 \), then \( \sum_{k=1}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi/10 k) = \frac{2 \times8}{8 +1}= \frac{16}{9} \).

Therefore, \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi/10 k)=2 \times16/9=32/9 \).

Therefore, \( S= \frac{1}{2} \times32/9=16/9≈1.777... \).

But earlier approximate calculation gave me around4.07, which is way larger than16/9≈1.777. So, there must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the identity is different.

Wait, let me check.

I recall that \( \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \sec^2 (\pi k/(2n)) = \frac{2n -2}{n} \).

In our case, we have \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi/10 k) \). If I set \( \theta= \pi/10 \), then \(2n=10 \Rightarrow n=5 \).

Thus, \( \sum_{k=1}^{9} \sec^2 (\pi/10 k)= \frac{2 \times5 -2}{5}= \frac{8}{5}=1.6 \).

But our sum is from k=1 to16, which is from1 to16, which is beyond9, so perhaps the identity is different.

Wait, another source says that \( \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \sec^2 (\pi k/n) = \frac{2n -2}{n} \).

So, for n=5, \( \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi k/5)=1.6 \). But we have k=1 to16, which is much higher.

Wait, but \( \sec^2 (\pi k/5)= \sec^2 (\pi (k mod5)/5) \), so it's periodic every5 terms.

Thus, \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k/5)=4 \times \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi k /5)=4 \times1.6=6.4 \).

But earlier identity applies only for k=1 to4.

Thus, in our case, the sum is from k=1 to16, which is equivalent to adding 4 full periods.

Thus, \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /5)=4 \times \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi k/5)=4 \times1.6=6.4 \).

But wait, \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /5)= \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi k /5) + \sum_{k=5}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi k /5) + \sum_{k=9}^{12} \sec^2 (\pi k /5) + \sum_{k=13}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /5) \).

But each term after k=5 is equivalent to k'=k-5, so \( \sec^2 (\pi (k -5)/5)= \sec^2 (\pi k /5 - \pi)= - \sec^2 (\pi k /5) \). But since secant is even, \( \sec^2 (\pi (k -5)/5)= \sec^2 (\pi k /5) \). Wait, no.

Wait, \( \sec(\pi (k -5)/5)= \sec(\pi k /5 - \pi)= - \sec(\pi k /5) \). So, \( \sec^2(\pi (k -5)/5)= \sec^2(\pi k /5) \).

Therefore, each term \( \sec^2 (\pi k /5) \) for k=5 to16 is equal to \( \sec^2 (\pi (k -5)/5) \). So, the sum from k=5 to16 is equal to the sum from k=1 to12 of \( \sec^2 (\pi k /5) \).

Wait, but that complicates matters. So, it's not straightforward to apply the identity.

Alternatively, consider that the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \sec^2 (\pi k /5) \) diverges because it's growing with k, so \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /5) \) is a partial sum.

But perhaps, considering periodicity, \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /5)=4 \times \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi k /5) \).

But \( \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi k /5)= \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi k /5) \).

But compute \( \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi k /5) \).

From exact values:

\( \sec^2 (\pi /5)= 4 / (4 - \sqrt{5})= (4 + \sqrt{5}) / (16 - 8\sqrt{5} +5)= but wait, let me compute numerically:

\( \cos (\pi/5)= \sqrt{(5 + \sqrt{5})}/5≈0.8090, so sec^2≈1/0.8090²≈1.538.

Similarly, cos(2π/5)= (sqrt(5) -1)/4≈0.3090, so sec²≈1/0.954≈1.049.

cos(3π/5)= -cos(2π/5)≈-0.3090, so sec²≈1/0.954≈1.049.

cos(4π/5)= -cos(π/5)≈-0.8090, so sec²≈1/0.654≈1.529.

Thus, sum≈1.538 +1.049 +1.049 +1.529≈5.175.

Thus, \( \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi k /5)≈5.175 \).

Thus, \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /5)=4×5.175≈20.7 \).

But earlier approximation of the partial sum was around4.07. So, discrepancy.

Wait, that suggests that my previous assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps it's impossible to find an exact value, but maybe the sum is equal to18/13≈1.3846.

But our approximate value was around16/9≈1.777, about 1.777, which is close to18/13≈1.3846.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, wait, initial problem: sum of \( 1/(1 + \cos \theta ) \) from \( \theta = \pi /10 \) to \( \theta =10\pi /10= \pi \).

So, 10 terms.

Thus, 10 terms, each \( 1/(1 + \cos \theta ) \).

Earlier, I considered it as sum from \( \theta = \pi /10 \) to \(10\pi /10 \), which is 10 terms.

Wait, but if I consider the identity \( \sum_{k=1}^{n} \sec^2 (\pi k/(2n))=2n/(n +1) \). But in our case, n=5, but sum from k=1 to10, which is 2n=10. So, \( \sum_{k=1}^{10} \sec^2 (\pi k /10)= 2*10/(10 +1)=20/11≈1.818 \).

But that's not correct, because when k=10, \( \sec^2 (\pi )=1 \), so the sum is actually 1 + sum_{k=1}^9 sec²(...).

But I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that in the identity, \( \sum_{k=1}^{n} \sec^2 (\pi k/(2n +2))= \frac{2n}{n +1} \).

In our case, we have \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )= \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) \).

Which is equivalent to \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )= 2 \sum_{k=1}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) \).

But according to the identity, for \( \theta = \pi /10 \), \( \sum_{k=1}^{n} \sec^2 (\pi k / (2n))= \frac{2n}{n +1} \).

Wait, for \( \theta= \pi /10 \), \( 2n=10 \Rightarrow n=5 \).

Thus, \( \sum_{k=1}^{5} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=10/6=5/3≈1.6667 \).

But in our case, we have sum from1 to16, which is beyond5.

Thus, we can write \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )= 2 \times \sum_{k=1}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) \).

But \( \sum_{k=1}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )= \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) + \sum_{k=5}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) \).

But \( \sec^2 (\pi (k -5)/10 )= \sec^2 (\pi k /10 - \pi)= - \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) \). So, for k=5 to8, \( \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )= \sec^2 (\pi (k -5)/10 ) \).

Thus, \( \sum_{k=5}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )= \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi (k -5)/10 )= \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) \times (-1)^{k -5} \).

But since \( (-1)^{k -5}= (-1)^{k -5}= (-1)^k \times (-1)^{-5}= (-1)^k \times (-1)^5= (-1)^k \times (-1) \).

Thus, \( \sum_{k=5}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )= - \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) \).

Therefore, \( \sum_{k=1}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )= \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) - \sum_{k=1}^{4} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=0 \).

Wait, that can't be, because we have positive terms. So, that suggests that the identity is not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the identity is for different values.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n \sec^2 (\pi k/(2n))=2n/(n +1) \), but perhaps the identity is for different angles.

Alternatively, let me look up the identity.

Wait, I recall that \( \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \sec^2 (\pi k/n)= \frac{2n -2}{n} \).

But in our case, n=10, so sum from1 to9 is \( \frac{18}{10}=1.8 \). Thus, sum from1 to16 is \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=2 \times \sum_{k=1}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=2 \times (1.8 + \sum_{k=9}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )) \).

But from k=9 to16, each term is \( \sec^2 (\pi (k -9)/10 ) \). So, each term is \( \sec^2 (\pi (k -9)/10 ) \), which is \( \sec^2 (\pi (k -9)/10 )= \sec^2 (\pi (k /10 - 9/10 ))= \sec^2 (\pi (k /10 ) - 9\pi /10 ) \).

But \( \sec^2 (\theta - \pi )= \sec^2 \theta \), so \( \sec^2 (\pi (k /10 ) - 9\pi /10 )= \sec^2 (\pi (k /10 )) \).

Therefore, the terms for k=9 to16 are same as k=1 to8.

Thus, \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=2 \times \sum_{k=1}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=2 \times (1.8 + \sum_{k=9}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )) \).

But \( \sum_{k=9}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )= \sum_{k=1}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi (k -9)/10 )= \sum_{k=1}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi (k /10 - 9/10 ))= \sum_{k=1}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi (k /10 - 1)) \).

But \( \sec^2 (\pi (k /10 -1 ))= \sec^2 (\pi (k /10 ) - \pi )= \sec^2 (\pi (k /10 )) \), since \( \sec^2 (\theta - \pi )= \sec^2 (\theta ) \).

Thus, \( \sum_{k=9}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )= \sum_{k=1}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) \).

Therefore, \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=2 \times \sum_{k=1}^{8} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=2 \times 1.8=3.6 \).

Thus, \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=3.6 \).

Therefore, \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=3.6=18/5 \).

Thus, \( \sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=18/5=3.6 \).

Thus, \( S= \frac{1}{2} \times18/5=9/5=1.8 \).

Wait, that's different from earlier results. So, if S=9/5=1.8, which is a rational number, that's more likely.

Wait, but earlier, we thought that the sum of \( \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) \) for k=1 to16 is 18/5=3.6, and S=1/2 times that is9/5.

But this seems inconsistent because earlier when I computed the partial sums, I had a much larger value.

But according to this identity, it's1.8=9/5.

Wait, let me compute sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=?

But with the identity, for n=10, sum_{k=1}^{10} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=2*10/(10 +1)=20/11≈1.818.

But we have sum_{k=1}^{16}=1.8≈10/5.666.

Wait, but 18/5=3.6 is the sum_{k=1}^{16}, but according to the identity, for n=10, sum_{k=1}^{10}=20/11≈1.818, and sum_{k=1}^{16}=sum_{k=1}^{10} + sum_{k=11}^{16}.

But sum_{k=11}^{16} is sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi (k -10)/10 )= sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi (k -10)/10 )= sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi (k -10)/10 )= sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (-\pi (k -10)/10 )= sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi (k -10)/10 )= sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi (10 -k ) /10 )= sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi (1 -k /10 ))= sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi (1 -k /10 ))= sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi ( (10 -k ) /10 ))= sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi ( (10 -k ) /10 )).

Which is similar to original sum, but reversed. So, it's symmetric, so sum_{k=1}^{16}=2 * sum_{k=1}^{10} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ). But 10 is half of16, so perhaps.

Wait, thus, sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=2 * sum_{k=1}^{10} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=2*(20/11 + sum_{k=11}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )).

But this doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps 16=2*8, so the sum over 16 terms is 2 times the sum over 8 terms.

But from the identity for n=10, sum_{k=1}^{10} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=20/11≈1.818.

Then, sum_{k=1}^{16}= sum_{k=1}^{10} + sum_{k=11}^{16}=20/11 + sum_{k=11}^{16}.

But sum_{k=11}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )= sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi (k -10)/10 )= sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi (k -10)/10 ).

Which is sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi (k -10)/10 ).

But \( \pi (k -10)/10= \pi (k/10 -1 )= \pi ( (k -10)/10 )= same as before.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

But maybe the sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=20/11 + sum_{k=11}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ).

But sum_{k=11}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )= sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi (k -1)/10 ).

Which is sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi (k -1)/10 )= sum_{k=0}^{5} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ).

But \( \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) \) for k=0 is undefined, so perhaps starting from k=1.

Thus, sum_{k=1}^{6} \sec^2 (\pi (k -1)/10 )= sum_{k=0}^{5} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) - \sec^2 (0)= sum_{k=0}^{5} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) - \infty.

Which is undefined.

Thus, the sum_{k=11}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 ) is divergent, which suggests that our initial sum is divergent. But in reality, we have finite terms.

Wait, perhaps this identity is not applicable here because the angles are not co-prime or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec^2 (\pi k /10 )=20/11 + something.

Wait, but we have 8 terms beyond k=10.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum can be expressed as 3.6 as per the identity, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should relate back to the original problem. The problem is to compute the sum of \(1/(1 + \cos \theta_k ) \), where \( \theta_k = \pi /10, 2\pi /10, \dots, 10\pi /10= \pi \).

We have:

\( 1/(1 + \cos \theta_k )= \frac{1 - \sec \theta_k }{\tan^2 \theta_k /2 } \).

But \( \tan^2 \theta_k /2= (1 - \cos \theta_k ) / \sin^2 \theta_k \). So, \( 1/(1 + \cos \theta_k )= 2 \sin^2 (\theta_k /2 ) / (1 - \cos \theta_k ) \).

But \( 1 - \cos \theta_k=2 \sin^2 (\theta_k /2 ) \), so \( 1/(1 + \cos \theta_k )= 2 \sin^2 (\theta_k /2 ) / (2 \sin^2 (\theta_k /2 ))=1/\cos (\theta_k ) \).

Wait, that's the same as before.

So, we have \( S= sum_{k=1}^{16} 1/\cos (\theta_k )= sum_{k=1}^{16} \sec (\theta_k ) \).

But \( \theta_k = \pi /10, 2\pi /10, ..., 10\pi /10 \).

Thus, \( S= sum_{k=1}^{10} \sec (\pi k /10 ) + sum_{k=11}^{16} \sec (\pi k /10 ) \).

But \( \sec (\pi k /10 )=1/\cos (\pi k /10 )=1/\cos (\pi - \pi (10 -k ) /10 )= -1/\cos (\pi (10 -k ) /10 )= -sec (\pi (10 -k ) /10 ).

Thus, \( S= sum_{k=1}^{10} \sec (\pi k /10 ) - sum_{k=1}^{10} \sec (\pi (10 -k ) /10 ) \).

But \( \sec (\pi (10 -k ) /10 )= \sec (\pi - \pi k /10 )= - \sec (\pi k /10 ) \).

Thus, \( S= sum_{k=1}^{10} \sec (\pi k /10 ) - sum_{k=1}^{10} (- \sec (\pi k /10 ))=2 sum_{k=1}^{10} \sec (\pi k /10 ) \).

But \( sum_{k=1}^{10} \sec (\pi k /10 ) \) is an alternating sum. For k=1 to10, the terms are:

1. \( \sec (\pi /10 )≈1.19175170185 \)
2. \( \sec (2\pi /10 )=2 \)
3. \( \sec (3\pi /10 )≈1.7013168015 \)
4. \( \sec (4\pi /10 )≈1.19175170185 \)
5. \( \sec (5\pi /10 )≈2 \)
6. \( \sec (6\pi /10 )≈1.19175170185 \)
7. \( \sec (7\pi /10 )≈1.7013168178 \)
8. \( \sec (8\pi /10 )= \sec (4\pi /5 )=1/\cos (4\pi /5 )=1/(-\cos (\pi /5 ))= -1/\cos (\pi /5 ) \approx -1.19175170185 \)
9. \( \sec (9\pi /10 )= \sec (\pi - \pi /10 )= - \sec (\pi /10 ) \approx -1.19175170185 \)
10. \( \sec (10\pi /10 )= \sec \pi = -1 \)

So, summing these:

1. \(1.19175170185 \)
2. \(2 \)
3. \(1.7013168015 \)
4. \(1.19175170185 \)
5. \(2 \)
6. \(1.19175170185 \)
7. \(1.7013168015 \)
8. \(-1.19175170185 \)
9. \(-1.19175170185 \)
10. \(-1 \)

Compute the sum:

1.19175170185

+ 2 = 3.19175170185

+1.7013168015=4.89306850335

+1.19175170185=6.0848102052

+2=8.0848102052

+1.19175170185=9.27656190705

+1.7013168015=10.9778787086

-1.19175170185=9.78612700675

-1.19175170185=8.594375304875

-1=7.594375304875

But wait, that's approximately 7.594375304875.

Wait, but earlier, through the identity, I thought it's 16/9≈1.777.

But my numerical calculation is giving me about 7.5, which is different.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the identity.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 7.5, but I have to reconcile this.

Wait, let me check the numerical approach.

Wait, earlier, with \( \theta_k = \pi /10 \) to \( 10\pi /10= \pi \), we have 10 terms.

Each term is \(1
