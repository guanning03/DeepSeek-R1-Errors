Question:
Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot "mix and match".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.

Correct Answer:
There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.

Wrong Prediction:
128

Wrong Answer:
To determine the number of different wacky personalities Tom can create for his Mr. Potato Head, I'll analyze each component of the head and the options available for each.

First, there are 3 hairstyles, including the option of being bald. This gives Tom 4 choices for hairstyles.

Next, there are 2 sets of eyebrows. Since Mr. Potato Head can be bald, Tom has 2 options for eyebrows.

There's only 1 pair of googly eyes, so Tom has 1 choice for eyes.

For ears, there are 2 sets available, giving Tom 2 options.

Lips come in 2 sets, so Tom has 2 choices for lips.

Finally, there are 2 pairs of shoes. Tom can choose either pair, providing 2 options for shoes.

Since the bonus pair of clown shoes can be included as an optional choice, we'll treat it separately. Tom has 2 options for shoes, and for each of these, he can choose to add the clown shoes or not.

However, it's important to note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald, which means the bald choice is separate from the other components.

Now, to calculate the total number of different personalities, I'll multiply the number of choices for each component:

- Hairstyle: 4 options
- Eyebrows: 2 options
- Eyes: 1 option
- Ears: 2 options
- Lips: 2 options
- Shoes: 2 options
- Clowns (optional): 2 options

Multiplying these together: 4 × 2 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 128.

Therefore, Tom can create 128 different wacky personalities for his Mr. Potato Head.

To determine the number of different wacky personalities Tom can create for his Mr. Potato Head, we'll analyze each component of the head and the options available for each. 

**Components:**
1. **HeAst:** There are 3 hairstyles, including the option of being bald. So, Tom has **4 choices** (Bald, Hair A, Hair B, Hair C).
2. **Eyebrows:** There are 2 sets of eyebrows. Tom has **2 choices**.
3. **Eyes:** Only 1 pair of googly eyes, so **1 choice**.
4. **Ears:** 2 sets of ears, giving **2 choices**.
5. **Lips:** 2 sets of lips, providing **2 choices**.
6. **Shoes:** 2 pairs of shoes, offering **2 choices**.
7. **Bonus Clowns shoes:** This is an **optional choice**, giving Tom **2 options** (with or without the clown shoes).

**Calculating the Total Number of Personalities:**
Multiply the number of choices for each component:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 128
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{128}
\]
