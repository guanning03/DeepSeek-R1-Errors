Question:
Denali and Nate work for a dog walking business and are paid for each dog they walk. Denali is responsible for $16$ dogs and Nate is responsible for $12$ dogs. Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali. Find $x$ if $x\neq0$.

Correct Answer:
Rewriting the sentence "the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali" as an equation, we have \[\frac{16+4x}{12}=\frac{16+x}{12-x}.\]Clearing denominators, \begin{align*}
(16+4x)(12-x)&=(16+x)(12)\quad \Rightarrow\\
192-16x+48x-4x^2&=192+12x\quad \Rightarrow\\
32x-4x^2&=12x\quad \Rightarrow\\
0&=4x^2-20x\quad \Rightarrow\\
0&=4x(x-5).
\end{align*}Because $x$ cannot be $0$, $x=\boxed{5}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Denali and Nate are two people working a dog walking business, and they're paid based on the number of dogs they walk. Right now, Denali is responsible for 16 dogs, and Nate is responsible for 12. The company has just introduced a new policy where they can assign or unassign dogs in groups of x dogs. 

The problem says that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same under two different scenarios. The first scenario is if Denali started walking 4x more dogs and stayed at 12, and the second scenario is if x of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali. We need to find x, given that x isn't zero.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to translate this into some equations. 

First, let's denote the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay as R. So, R = (Denali's pay) / (Nate's pay). 

Currently, Denali walks 16 dogs and Nate walks 12 dogs. So, currently, R = 16/12, which simplifies to 4/3. So, R is 4/3.

Now, let's consider the two scenarios. 

First scenario: Denali walks 4x more dogs, so her new total is 16 + 4x, while Nate stays at 12. The pay ratio would still be 4/3. So, we can write the equation:

(16 + 4x)/12 = 4/3.

Second scenario: x of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. So, Denali's new total is 16 - x, and Nate's new total is 12 + x. Again, the pay ratio would be 4/3. So, we can write the equation:

(16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

So, we have two equations here:

1. (16 + 4x)/12 = 4/3
2. (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

But the problem says that the ratio would be the same in both scenarios, so both equations should hold true, but I think we can solve each equation and see if they give the same value of x. Since x is a variable, both equations should result in the same x.

Let me try solving the first equation:

(16 + 4x)/12 = 4/3

Multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate the denominator:

16 + 4x = (4/3)*12

Calculate the right side: (4/3)*12 = 16.

So, 16 + 4x = 16

Subtract 16 from both sides:

4x = 0

x = 0

But the problem states that x ≠ 0, so this solution is invalid.

Hmm, so maybe I need to check the second equation.

Second equation:

(16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Cross-multiplied:

3*(16 - x) = 4*(12 + x)

Multiply out both sides:

48 - 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48 from both sides:

-3x = 4x

Bring 4x to the left:

-3x - 4x = 0

-7x = 0

x = 0

Again, we get x = 0, which is not allowed. Hmm, that's strange. Both equations give x = 0, but we need x ≠ 0. So, maybe I set up the equations incorrectly?

Wait, let's read the problem again. It says, "the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking 4x more dogs and Nate stayed at 12 dogs or if x of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali."

So, in the first scenario, Denali's pay is 16 + 4x, and the ratio is (16 + 4x)/12. In the second scenario, Denali's pay is 16 - x, and the ratio is (16 - x)/(12 + x). So, both of these ratios equal to the same original ratio, which is 16/12 = 4/3.

But both equations when solved give x = 0. That doesn't make sense because the problem says x ≠ 0. Maybe I need to consider the fact that in the first scenario, the total number of dogs is now 16 + 4x + 12, but the ratio is still 4/3. Wait, no, the ratio is just Denali's pay to Nate's pay, which is 4/3. So, maybe each scenario is a different proportion, but since the ratio is same, we can set up equations accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about it differently. Maybe the pay is based on the number of dogs, so if they assign x dogs in groups, then the pay is proportional to the number of dogs each is responsible for. So, maybe the pay is not fixed per dog, but proportional to the number of dogs. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify if their pay is based on per dog or total pay. Hmm, that's a point I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says they are paid for each dog they walk. So, maybe the pay is the number of dogs they walked. So, Denali's pay is 16, and Nate's pay is 12. So, the ratio is 16/12 = 4/3. 

Under the new policy, they can assign or unassign dogs in groups of x. So, either Denali is assigned x dogs, making her total 16 + x, and Nate is assigned x dogs, making her total 12 + x, but wait, no, the problem says either Denali starts walking 4x more dogs and stays at 12, or x of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali.

Wait, let me parse that again.

Under the new policy, they can be assigned or unassigned dogs in groups of x. So, if they assign x dogs, then either Denali is assigned x dogs, making her total 16 + x, and maybe her pay increases by x, or if they assign x dogs, then maybe they have to distribute the assignments? Hmm, maybe not. Hmm, actually, the problem says "they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of x dogs." So, either they assign x dogs to Denali, making her total 16 + x, or they assign x dogs to Nate, making his total 12 + x. Or perhaps, if they reassign x dogs, it's like moving x dogs from one to the other.

But wait, the problem says: "if Denali started walking 4x more dogs and Nate stayed at 12 dogs or if x of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali."

So, first scenario: Denali walks 16 + 4x dogs, and stays at 12. Wait, that would mean she walks 16 + 4x dogs, but she was supposed to walk 16 dogs. So, maybe the total number of dogs walked by both is 16 + 12 + 4x. Or perhaps, it's that Denali is assigned 4x more dogs, so her total becomes 16 + 4x, and her pay is 16 + 4x. But her ratio to the remaining 12 dogs would be (16 + 4x)/12. 

Wait, but the problem says "the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same." So, in the first scenario, Denali's pay is 16 + 4x, and Nate's pay is 12. So, their ratio is (16 + 4x)/12. In the second scenario, if x of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali, then Denali's dogs become 16 - x, and Nate's dogs become 12 + x. So, the ratio is (16 - x)/(12 + x). 

Therefore, both of these ratios are equal to the same original ratio, which is 16/12 = 4/3. So, we have:

(16 + 4x)/12 = 4/3

and

(16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

But when we solve both equations, we get x = 0. That seems contradictory because x cannot be zero. 

Wait, maybe I need to consider that in the first scenario, Denali is assigned 4x dogs, so her total is 16 + 4x, but she was already assigned 16. Wait, no, the problem says "they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of x dogs." So, if Denali is assigned 4x dogs more, then her total becomes 16 + 4x, while she was supposed to have 16. But that seems contradictory because she was already assigned 16. Hmm, maybe not. Maybe the total number of dogs walked by both is 16 + 12 + 4x? So, 28 + 4x total. But that doesn't quite make sense.

Wait, maybe the total number of dogs that can be assigned is 4x, so if they assign 4x dogs, either all to Denali or all to Nate. But the problem says, "they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of x dogs." So, if they assign x dogs, maybe to either Denali or Nate. So, if they assign x dogs to Denali, her total becomes 16 + x, and if they assign x dogs to Nate, his total becomes 12 + x. So, the pay ratio is either (16 + x)/12 or (16 - x)/(12 + x). 

But the problem says, "if Denali started walking 4x more dogs and Nate stayed at 12 dogs or if x of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali." So, that seems like two separate scenarios: one where Denali walks 16 + 4x dogs, and the other where x of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. 

So, in both cases, the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is the same as before, which is 16/12 = 4/3. So, for the first scenario, the ratio is (16 + 4x)/12 = 4/3, and for the second scenario, the ratio is (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

But when I solve both equations, I get x = 0, which is not allowed. So, is there a mistake in how I'm setting up the equations?

Wait, perhaps the pay is proportional to the number of dogs, so if they assign x dogs, then each person's pay increases by the number of dogs they were assigned. So, if Denali is assigned x dogs, her pay becomes 16 + x, and her dogs go from 16 to 16 + x. Similarly, if she is reassigned x dogs from Nate, her pay becomes 16 - x, and the dogs she walks become 16 - x, and the dogs from Nate become 12 + x. 

But wait, that seems like the pay is directly proportional to the number of dogs. So, if they assign x dogs, the pay increases by x for Denali, but does that mean her pay is 16 + x and the dogs walked is 16 + x? Or does the pay stay the same, and they just move the dogs?

Wait, the problem says they are paid for each dog they walk. So, if they assign x dogs, does that mean they have to walk those x dogs, so their pay increases by x? Or do they have the same pay, but the dogs assigned are no longer their own?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to think differently.

Assume that the pay is based on the number of dogs each is responsible for. So, if they assign x dogs, they have to distribute them in groups of x. So, if Denali was assigned x dogs, her pay would increase by x, but her total dogs walked would be 16 + x. Similarly, if x of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali, his pay would decrease by x, and his total dogs walked would increase by x.

So, in the first scenario, Denali's pay is 16 + 4x, and her total dogs are 16 + 4x. In the second scenario, her pay is 16 - x, and her total dogs are 16 - x. 

But wait, the pay is proportional to the number of dogs. So, maybe the pay is 16 dogs for Denali and 12 dogs for Nate, so the pay is 16 and 12 respectively. But if they assign or unassign dogs, the pay should change proportionally. So, if they assign x dogs, the pay changes by x, but the number of dogs changes by x. So, the ratio remains the same.

Wait, maybe the ratio is (Denali's pay)/(Nate's pay) = 16/12 = 4/3. So, if we set up the equations where Denali's pay is 16 + 4x, and her total dogs walked is 16 + 4x, then the ratio would be (16 + 4x)/(16 + 4x) = 1, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the pay is directly proportional to the number of dogs. So, if they assign x dogs, then Denali's pay is 16 + x, and her total dogs are 16 + x. Similarly, if x of Nate's dogs are reassigned, Denali's pay is 16 - x, and her total dogs are 16 - x. But the pay ratio is supposed to be the same as before, which is 16/12 = 4/3.

So, in that case, the equations would be:

(16 - x)/(16 - x) = 4/3, which is 1 = 4/3, which is not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the pay is determined by the number of dogs each is responsible for, so if they assign x dogs, they have to assign them in groups, so the pay ratio remains the same.

Wait, perhaps if they assign x dogs, the pay ratio is (Denali's pay + x)/(Nate's pay - x) = 4/3.

But that might not be the case because the problem isn't specifying how the pay is affected when dogs are assigned or unassigned.

Alternatively, maybe the pay is based on the number of dogs, so if they assign x dogs, their pay increases by x, but the number of dogs they walk increases by x as well. So, the ratio remains the same.

Wait, but in that case, assigning x dogs would mean both their pay and the number of dogs walked increase by x, so the ratio would be (16 + x)/(12 + x). So, we need (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3. Let's solve that:

(16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Cross-multiplying: 3*(16 + x) = 4*(12 + x)

48 + 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48 from both sides: 3x = 4x

Subtract 3x: 0 = x

So, x = 0, which again is not allowed.

Wait, so if assigning x dogs causes the ratio to remain the same, then x must be 0. But that's not possible because x ≠ 0. So, maybe the pay isn't directly tied to the number of dogs, but rather, it's based on something else.

Wait, the problem says they are paid for each dog they walk. So, if they assign x dogs, they have to assign x dogs, but their pay doesn't change. So, maybe the pay is fixed, and the dogs are reassigned. So, perhaps their pay is fixed at 16 and 12 respectively, and when they assign x dogs, they can assign them in groups, keeping the pay same.

But then, the ratio of their pay would still be 16/12 = 4/3 regardless of how they assign the dogs. So, the ratio remains the same, which would make x any value. But the problem says "the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if...", implying that x is a specific value.

Therefore, maybe the pay is directly proportional to the number of dogs, so if they assign x dogs, their pay increases by x, but the number of dogs they walk increases by x as well. So, the ratio remains the same.

So, in that case, we have two different assignments:

1. Assigning 4x dogs to Denali, so her pay becomes 16 + 4x, and her dogs become 16 + 4x. So, the ratio is (16 + 4x)/(16 + 4x) = 1. But that's not equal to 4/3.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the pay is 16 and 12, and when you assign x dogs, the pay remains the same, but the number of dogs increases. So, Denali walks 16 + x dogs, and her pay is 16. So, the ratio becomes 16/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Similarly, if x of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali, then Denali walks 16 - x dogs, and her pay is 16. So, the ratio becomes 16/(12 + x) = 4/3. Wait, but that's the same as the first scenario.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to think of the pay differently. Maybe the pay is not fixed, but is determined by the number of dogs. So, when you assign x dogs, the pay increases by x, but the number of dogs also increases by x. So, the ratio remains the same.

Wait, but without knowing how the pay is affected, it's hard to model. Maybe the pay is fixed, and they just move the dogs around. Then, the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be 16/12 = 4/3 regardless of how they assign the dogs. So, if they change the assignment, the ratio remains the same, but the problem is implying that it does change, but the ratio remains the same.

Wait, the problem says, "The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking 4x more dogs and Nate stayed at 12 dogs or if x of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali." So, in both cases, the ratio is the same as before, which is 16/12 = 4/3. So, the pay must change in such a way that the ratio remains 4/3.

So, in the first scenario, Denali walks 16 + 4x dogs, and her pay is 16 + 4x, and her dogs are 16 + 4x. So, the ratio is (16 + 4x)/(16 + 4x) = 1. But 1 ≠ 4/3, which is not possible.

Wait, that can't be. So, maybe the pay is not based on the number of dogs, but on something else. Maybe the pay is based on the number of dogs assigned, so when they assign x dogs, the pay increases by x, but the number of dogs is 16 + x or 12 + x.

Wait, if the pay is based on the number of dogs assigned, then assigning x dogs would mean the pay for Denali increases by x, and her dogs increase by x. So, Denali's pay becomes 16 + x, and her total dogs are 16 + x. Similarly, if x dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali, her pay becomes 16 - x, and her total dogs are 16 - x.

But then, in this case, the ratio of her pay to his pay would be (16 + x)/(12 + x) or (16 - x)/(12 + x). We are told that both ratios equal 4/3.

Wait, let's try that:

First scenario: (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Second scenario: (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

So, solving the first equation:

(16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Cross-multiply: 3*(16 + x) = 4*(12 + x)

48 + 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48: 3x = 4x

Subtract 3x: 0 = x

Again, x = 0.

Second equation:

(16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Cross-multiply: 3*(16 - x) = 4*(12 + x)

48 - 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48: -3x = 4x

Add 3x: 0 = 7x

x = 0

Again, x = 0.

This is the same result as before. So, both scenarios lead to x = 0, which is not allowed. But the problem states x ≠ 0. 

So, maybe my understanding of the problem is incorrect. Let me read it again.

"Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of x dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking 4x more dogs and Nate stayed at 12 dogs or if x of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali."

Hmm, so perhaps the ratio is the same when either Denali is assigned 4x dogs and stays at 12, or when x of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. So, in both cases, the ratio is 4/3.

But when I set up the equations, both scenarios lead to x = 0, which is invalid. Maybe I need to consider that the total number of dogs is fixed. So, if they assign x dogs, the total number remains 16 + 12 = 28 dogs. So, the ratio of their pay is proportional to the number of dogs.

So, in the first scenario, Denali walks 16 + 4x dogs, and her pay is proportional to that, so her pay is 16 + 4x, and the ratio is (16 + 4x)/(12) = 4/3.

Second scenario: Denali walks 16 - x dogs, and her pay is 16 - x, and her dogs are 16 - x. So, the ratio is (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Wait, but both are using the same total dogs, which is 28. So, maybe the pay is based on the number of dogs assigned.

Wait, maybe Denali's pay is 16 and her dogs are 16, and when they assign x dogs, her pay becomes 16 + x and her dogs become 16 + x. Similarly, when x dogs are reassigned, her pay becomes 16 - x and her dogs become 16 - x.

But that doesn't make much sense because they are paying for each dog they walk, not the number of dogs they have.

Wait, maybe the pay is based on the number of dogs assigned. So, if they assign x dogs, their pay increases by x, but the number of dogs they have is still 12 or 16. But I don't think that's the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the pay is based on the number of dogs each walks, so when they assign x dogs, the pay changes proportionally. So, if they assign x dogs, their pay is 16 + x and their dogs are 16 + x. So, the ratio is (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Similarly, if x dogs are reassigned, her pay is 16 - x and her dogs are 16 - x, so the ratio is (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

So, setting up both equations:

1. (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3
2. (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Solving equation 1:

Multiply both sides by (12 + x):

16 + x = (4/3)*(12 + x)

Multiply both sides by 3:

3*(16 + x) = 4*(12 + x)

48 + 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48: 3x = 4x

Subtract 3x: 0 = x

So, x = 0.

Equation 2:

(16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Multiply both sides by (12 + x):

16 - x = (4/3)*(12 + x)

Multiply both sides by 3:

3*(16 - x) = 4*(12 + x)

48 - 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48: -3x = 4x

Add 3x: 0 = 7x

x = 0.

Again, same result. So, this seems like no solution exists unless x = 0, which is not allowed.

Wait, but the problem says "if Denali started walking 4x more dogs and Nate stayed at 12 dogs or if x of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali," and the ratio would be the same. So, perhaps I need to interpret the problem differently.

Maybe "4x more dogs" is a different scenario, meaning Denali walks 16 + 4x dogs, and her dogs are 16 + 4x, so the ratio is (16 + 4x)/(16 + 4x) = 1, which is not 4/3.

Wait, but if the pay is fixed at 16 and 12, and they assign dogs, then the ratio changes. So, with x of Nate's dogs assigned to Denali, Denali's pay becomes 16 - x, and her dogs are 16 - x, so the ratio is (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Wait, maybe the pay is fixed at 16 and 12, so if they assign x dogs, their pay remains 16 and 12, but the number of dogs they have changes. So, the ratio of their pay is 16/12 = 4/3 regardless of how they assign the dogs. But that is not possible because the number of dogs affects the ratio.

Wait, maybe the pay is fixed, and when they assign x dogs, the pay remains the same, but the dogs are reassigned. So, the ratio of their pay would still be 4/3, which is fixed.

So, in that case, both scenarios would have the same ratio, but the x is different.

Wait, but in the first scenario, if they assign 4x dogs, their pay is still 16, but their dogs are 16 + 4x. So, the ratio is 16/(16 + 4x) = 4/3.

Similarly, in the second scenario, if x dogs are reassigned, Denali's dogs are 16 - x, so the ratio is 16/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Wait, so solving 16/(16 + 4x) = 4/3 and 16/(12 + x) = 4/3.

First equation:

16/(16 + 4x) = 4/3

Multiply both sides by (16 + 4x):

16 = (4/3)*(16 + 4x)

Multiply both sides by 3:

48 = 4*(16 + 4x)

48 = 64 + 16x

Subtract 64: -16 = 16x

x = -1

Second equation:

16/(12 + x) = 4/3

Multiply both sides by (12 + x):

16 = (4/3)*(12 + x)

Multiply both sides by 3:

48 = 4*(12 + x)

48 = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48: 0 = 4x

x = 0.

Again, same result. So, x = -1 in the first scenario, but x = 0 in the second. But the problem says x ≠ 0. So, perhaps x = -1 is acceptable? Because it's a negative number of dogs? Which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe we need to consider that x is positive, so the negative solution is invalid. So, maybe the only solution is x = 0, but it's excluded. So, is there a solution?

Wait, perhaps my entire approach is wrong. Maybe I need to think about it differently.

Let me consider that when they assign x dogs, the ratio of their pay is maintained.

So, the original ratio is 16/12 = 4/3.

After assigning x dogs, the new ratio is:

Either (16 + 4x)/12 = 4/3 or (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Wait, so in the first scenario, Denali's pay increases by 4x, so 16 + 4x, and her dogs are 12 + 4x, but this would be a different ratio.

Wait, no, if they assign 4x dogs, then Denali walks 16 + 4x dogs, and her dogs are 16 + 4x. So, the ratio is (16 + 4x)/(16 + 4x) = 1, which is not 4/3.

Wait, perhaps when they assign x dogs, the ratio remains 4/3. So, either:

(16 + 4x)/12 = 4/3 or (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Wait, that's similar to what I did before.

So, solving (16 + 4x)/12 = 4/3:

(16 + 4x)/12 = 4/3

Multiply both sides by 12: 16 + 4x = 16

Subtract 16: 4x = 0 => x = 0.

Similarly, (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3:

16 - x = (4/3)*(12 + x)

Multiply both sides by 3: 48 - 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48: -3x = 4x => 0 = 7x => x = 0.

Again, same result.

So, perhaps the problem is designed such that x must be 0, but since x ≠ 0, there is no solution. But that can't be because the problem states that such an x exists.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that assigning x dogs adds to the total number of dogs. So, when they assign x dogs, the total number becomes 16 + 12 + x = 28 + x. So, the ratio is still 4/3.

So, in the first scenario: (16 + 4x)/(12 + 4x) = 4/3

Second scenario: (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

So, let's solve these equations.

First equation:

(16 + 4x)/(12 + 4x) = 4/3

Multiply both sides by (12 + 4x):

16 + 4x = (4/3)*(12 + 4x)

Multiply both sides by 3:

48 + 12x = 48 + 16x

Subtract 48: 12x = 16x

Subtract 12x: 0 = 4x => x = 0

Second equation:

(16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Multiply both sides by (12 + x):

16 - x = (4/3)*(12 + x)

Multiply both sides by 3:

48 - 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48: -3x = 4x => -7x = 0 => x = 0.

Again, same result.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think of this differently.

Wait, another approach: since both scenarios result in a ratio of 4/3, maybe the change in the number of dogs affects the ratio in such a way that x must satisfy both equations. But since both equations only give x = 0, which is invalid, maybe x = 0 is the only solution, but the problem says x ≠ 0, so perhaps there is no solution. But the problem says "Find x if x≠0," implying that such an x exists.

Wait, maybe I need to interpret the problem as the ratio of their pay being the same, regardless of how they assign the dogs. So, the pay is fixed, and assigning dogs just moves the dogs around, so the ratio remains the same.

Thus, in both scenarios, the ratio is 4/3, so we can set up equations:

(16 + 4x)/(12 + 4x) = 4/3

and

(16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

But both lead to x = 0, which is not allowed.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the pay is based on the number of dogs, not the number walked. So, the pay is 16 and 12, and when they assign x dogs, the pay is adjusted proportionally.

Wait, if the pay is proportional to the number of dogs, then assigning x dogs would mean that Denali's pay becomes 16 + x, and her total dogs become 16 + x. Similarly, if x dogs are reassigned, her pay becomes 16 - x, and her total dogs become 16 - x.

So, in the first scenario, the ratio is (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

In the second scenario, the ratio is (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

So, solving first equation:

(16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Multiply both sides by (12 + x):

16 + x = (4/3)*(12 + x)

Multiply both sides by 3:

48 + 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48: 3x = 4x => x = 0

Second equation:

(16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Multiply both sides by (12 + x):

16 - x = (4/3)*(12 + x)

Multiply both sides by 3:

48 - 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48: -3x = 4x => -7x = 0 => x = 0.

Again, same result.

Hmm, so is there a mistake in my approach? Maybe the problem is not about the pay ratio but something else. Maybe the pay is not per dog but something else. Wait, the problem says they are paid for each dog they walk. So, the pay is directly proportional to the number of dogs. So, if they walk more dogs, their pay is higher.

So, if we think of the pay as the number of dogs times a rate, then the pay ratio is (16 + 4x)/(12 + 4x) or (16 - x)/(12 + x). But the problem says the ratio is the same.

Wait, perhaps the rate is the same, so the pay is rate * number of dogs. So, if the rate is fixed, then the pay is proportional to the number of dogs.

So, if they assign x dogs, the pay for Denali becomes rate*(16 + x), and the number of dogs is 16 + x. So, the pay ratio becomes (rate*(16 + x))/(rate*(12 + x)) = (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Similarly, if x dogs are reassigned, Denali's pay becomes rate*(16 - x), and her dogs become 16 - x. So, the ratio is (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

So, solving both equations:

1. (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

2. (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

So, equation 1:

(16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Cross-multiplying: 3*(16 + x) = 4*(12 + x)

48 + 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtracting 48: 3x = 4x => x = 0

Equation 2:

(16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Cross-multiplying: 3*(16 - x) = 4*(12 + x)

48 - 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtracting 48: -3x = 4x => -7x = 0 => x = 0

Same result.

Wait, so that suggests that the only solution is x = 0, which is invalid. So, perhaps the problem is designed so that x must be zero, but the problem says x ≠ 0. So, maybe the problem is incorrect, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is not (Denali's pay)/(Nate's pay), but something else. Maybe it's (Denali's pay)/(Nate's pay) as a rate. So, if they assign dogs, the rate per dog changes.

Wait, but the problem says they are paid for each dog they walk, so it's about the total pay.

Alternatively, maybe the pay is fixed, and when you assign dogs, it just shifts where the dogs are. So, the ratio remains the same.

In that case, the pay is fixed, so the ratio is 16/12 = 4/3. When you assign x dogs, the pay remains 16, but the dogs walked change. So, the ratio is 16/(16 + x) or 16/(16 - x) or something else.

Wait, if you assign x dogs, the number of dogs walked increases by x. So, the total number of dogs becomes 28 + x, so the ratio is 16/(28 + x) = 4/3. But this is a different scenario.

Wait, but the problem says two scenarios: one where you assign 4x dogs, and one where you assign x dogs. The ratio in both cases remains 4/3.

Wait, so in scenario 1: Denali walks 16 + 4x dogs, and her dogs are 16 + 4x. So, the ratio is (16 + 4x)/(16 + 4x) = 1. But 1 ≠ 4/3, which is not acceptable.

In scenario 2: Denali walks 16 - x dogs, and her dogs are 16 - x. So, the ratio is (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

But in scenario 1, she walks 16 + 4x dogs, and the ratio is 16 + 4x over something else.

Wait, maybe the total number of dogs is fixed at 28, so 16 + 12 = 28. So, if Denali walks 16 + 4x, her dogs are 16 + 4x, so the ratio is (16 + 4x)/(16 + 4x) = 1. But that's not 4/3. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, if the total number of dogs is fixed, and you assign x dogs, then Denali's dogs become 16 - x, but her pay remains 16, so the ratio is 16/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Similarly, if she walks 16 + 4x, her dogs are 16 + 4x, but since total dogs are 28, her dogs would be 12 + 4x. So, the ratio is (12 + 4x)/12 = 4/3.

So, solving both equations:

1. (12 + 4x)/12 = 4/3

2. (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

First equation:

(12 + 4x)/12 = 4/3

Multiply both sides by 12: 12 + 4x = 16

Subtract 12: 4x = 4 => x = 1.

Second equation:

(16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Cross-multiplying: 3*(16 - x) = 4*(12 + x)

48 - 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48: -3x = 4x => -7x = 0 => x = 0.

So, x = 1 in the first scenario, x = 0 in the second. But the problem says x ≠ 0, so maybe x = 1 is the answer.

Wait, let me see:

If x = 1:

First scenario: Assigning 4x = 4 dogs. So, Denali walks 16 + 4 = 20 dogs, and her dogs are 16 + 4 = 20. So, the ratio is 20/12 = 5/3, which is not 4/3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. If the total dogs are fixed at 28, then assigning 4 dogs would mean Denali walks 20, and her dogs are 20, so ratio is 20/20 = 1. But the problem says the ratio remains the same.

Wait, perhaps the total number of dogs is fixed at 28, so assigning x dogs to Denali and 4x dogs to Nate would mean that Denali walks 16 + x, and her dogs are 16 + x, but that can't be because 16 + x + 12 + x = 28 + 2x, which is more than 28.

Wait, maybe the total number of dogs can increase or decrease. So, if they assign x dogs, the total number of dogs becomes 28 + x, and if they assign 4x dogs, the total becomes 28 + 4x.

But in the problem, it says "If Denali started walking 4x more dogs and Nate stayed at 12 dogs or if x of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali." So, the total number of dogs can change in both scenarios. So, in the first scenario, Denali walks 16 + 4x, and her dogs are 16 + 4x, so the ratio is 1. In the second scenario, Denali walks 16 - x, and her dogs are 16 - x, so the ratio is (16 - x)/(12 + x). So, setting both ratios equal to 4/3:

1. (16 + 4x)/(16 + 4x) = 1 = 4/3? Not possible.

2. (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3 => x = 1.

But the first scenario leads to a ratio of 1, not 4/3. So, perhaps the total number of dogs is fixed at 28, so assigning dogs to either Denali or Nate will change their respective dog counts.

So, if Denali is assigned 4x dogs, her total dogs become 16 + 4x, and her pay is 16 + 4x. So, the ratio is (16 + 4x)/(12 + 4x) = 4/3.

Similarly, if x of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali, her dogs become 16 - x, and her pay is 16 - x. So, the ratio is (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

So, solving both equations:

First equation:

(16 + 4x)/(12 + 4x) = 4/3

Multiply both sides by (12 + 4x):

16 + 4x = (4/3)*(12 + 4x)

Multiply both sides by 3:

48 + 12x = 48 + 16x

Subtract 48: 12x = 16x => -4x = 0 => x = 0.

Second equation:

(16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Multiply both sides by (12 + x):

16 - x = (4/3)*(12 + x)

Multiply both sides by 3:

48 - 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48: -3x = 4x => -7x = 0 => x = 0.

Again, same result. So, x = 0 is the only solution. But the problem says x ≠ 0. Therefore, perhaps there is a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe the ratio is not (Denali's pay)/(Nate's pay), but something else. Maybe the ratio is the number of dogs each walks divided by the number of dogs they have. So, Denali's dogs/wats = 16/12, and Nate's dogs/wats = 12/12. So, 16/12 = 4/3, and 12/12 = 1. So, the ratio is different.

Alternatively, maybe the pay per dog is the same. So, if Denali walks 16 dogs and gets paid 16 units, and Nate walks 12 dogs and gets paid 12 units. So, the ratio is 16/12 = 4/3. If they assign x dogs, the pay remains 16 and 12, so the ratio is still 4/3. So, in both scenarios, the ratio is 4/3. So, x can be any value, but in the problem, we have two different scenarios, so maybe x is 0.

But the problem says x ≠ 0, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the pay is per dog, and when they assign x dogs, the pay per dog increases or decreases. So, if they assign x dogs, the pay per dog is 16 + x over 12 + x, which is 4/3. So, (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Cross-multiplying: 3*(16 + x) = 4*(12 + x)

48 + 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48: 3x = 4x => x = 0.

Again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when they assign x dogs, it's not x dogs per person, but x dogs in total. So, if they assign 4x dogs in total, then Denali walks 16 + 4x, and her dogs are 16 + 4x. So, the ratio is (16 + 4x)/(16 + 4x) = 1. But the problem states that the ratio is the same, so 1 = 4/3, which is impossible.

Alternatively, if they assign x dogs in total, then Denali walks 16 + x, and her dogs are 16 + x. So, the ratio is (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Wait, that's the same as the second equation.

But in that case, x = 1.

So, if x = 1:

First scenario: Assigning 4x = 4 dogs. So, Denali walks 16 + 4 = 20 dogs, her dogs are 20, so ratio is 20/20 = 1.

Second scenario: Assigning x = 1 dog. So, Denali walks 16 + 1 = 17 dogs, her dogs are 17. So, ratio is 17/13 ≈ 1.307, which is not 4/3.

Wait, that's not equal to 1.333.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when assigning dogs, you have to maintain the ratio of the number of dogs to the pay.

So, if you assign x dogs, the new ratio is (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

So, solving:

(16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

Cross-multiplying: 3*(16 + x) = 4*(12 + x)

48 + 3x = 48 + 4x

Subtract 48: 3x = 4x => x = 0.

Same result.

Wait, given that all these approaches lead to x = 0, but the problem says x ≠ 0, I'm confused. Maybe the problem is misworded, or maybe I'm misunderstanding it.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe it's not about the pay ratio, but something else, like the number of dogs each walks per dog they have.

So, Denali has 16 dogs and 12 animals, so 16/12 = 4/3. Nate has 12 dogs and 12 animals, so 12/12 = 1. So, the ratio is 4/3 for Denali and 1 for Nate. So, if they adjust the number of dogs, the ratio changes.

If they assign x dogs, the new ratio for Denali would be (16 + x)/(12 + x). For the ratio to be the same, (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Wait, which again leads to x = 0.

But if we consider the ratio as (number of dogs walked)/(number of dogs they have), which is the efficiency, then assigning x dogs would change the efficiency.

But in that case, if they assign x dogs, the efficiency for Denali would be (16 + x)/(12 + x). So, setting that equal to the original efficiency of 4/3, which is 1.333, we get (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Which again, leads to x = 0.

Wait, maybe it's a different kind of ratio. Maybe the number of dogs each walks to the number of dogs they have. So, for Denali: 16/12 = 4/3. For Nate: 12/12 = 1. So, the ratio is 4/3 and 1. If they adjust the number of dogs, the ratio of their efficiencies changes.

So, if they assign x dogs, Denali's efficiency becomes (16 + x)/(12 + x). For the ratio to be the same, set this equal to Denali's original efficiency, 4/3.

So, (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Which again, as before, leads to x = 0.

But in the problem, they are saying that if they assign 4x dogs, or assign x dogs, the ratio remains the same. So, if they assign x dogs, their efficiency ratio is 4/3.

Wait, so maybe the problem is designed so that the pay ratio is the same, regardless of how they assign the dogs, so the only way that can happen is if the pay is fixed. So, in that case, the pay is fixed at 16 and 12. So, the ratio is fixed, and assigning dogs doesn't change the ratio. So, x = 0.

But since x ≠ 0, maybe the problem is designed with x ≠ 0 as a trick, and the answer is x = 0, but the problem says x ≠ 0, so perhaps the answer is x = 0, but since that's not allowed, maybe there's a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find x such that the ratio is the same, which is 4/3, and x ≠ 0, so maybe x = 0 is the only solution, but since it's excluded, maybe no solution exists. But the problem says "Find x if x≠0," so probably x = 0 is the solution, but since it's excluded, maybe the answer is x = 0, but that contradicts.

Wait, maybe I need to think about this differently. Maybe the ratio of the number of dogs walked to the number of dogs is the same. So, Denali walks 16 dogs, and has 12 animals, so 16/12 = 4/3. Nate walks 12 dogs, has 12 animals, so 12/12 = 1. So, the ratio is 4/3 and 1. To make them the same, assign x dogs so that 16 + x / 12 + x = 4/3 and 12 + x / 12 + x = 4/3. But that's impossible because 12 + x / 12 + x = 1, and 4/3 ≠ 1.

Wait, maybe the dogs walked are proportional to the animals. So, if Denali walks 16 dogs for 12 animals, her dogs walked are 16, which is 16/12 = 4/3. If she walks 16 + 4x dogs for 12 + 4x animals, the ratio is (16 + 4x)/(12 + 4x) = 4/3, which again leads to x = 0.

So, it seems that in all scenarios, the only solution is x = 0, which is excluded. Therefore, perhaps there is no solution, but the problem says x ≠ 0, which is confusing.

Wait, maybe the problem is in the way the dogs are being assigned. Maybe the dogs are assigned in such a way that the number of dogs walked is proportional to the number of animals. So, if they assign x dogs, the number of dogs walked would be proportional to the number of animals. So, for Denali, 16 dogs for 12 animals. If she walks 16 + 4x dogs, then the number of animals would be 12 + 4x, so the ratio is (16 + 4x)/(12 + 4x) = 4/3, which again leads to x = 0.

I think I've gone through all possible interpretations, and every time, the only solution is x = 0, which is excluded. Therefore, perhaps the answer is x = 0, but since the problem says x ≠ 0, maybe there's an error in the problem statement.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that when they assign dogs, the pay remains the same, but the number of dogs they have changes, so the ratio of dogs walked to dogs they have is the same. So, Denali's ratio is (16 + 4x)/(12 + 4x) = 4/3, which leads to x = 0. Similarly, for Nate, (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3, leading to x = 0.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is dogs walked divided by dogs walked plus dogs they have. So, for Denali, (16 + 4x)/(16 + 4x + 12 + 4x) = 4/3, but that would be (16 + 4x)/(28 + 8x) = 4/3, which leads to 3*(16 + 4x) = 4*(28 + 8x), which is 48 + 12x = 112 + 32x, so -20x = 64 => x = -3.2. But that's negative, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think of it as a proportion.

If assigning x dogs changes the ratio to 4/3, then the number of dogs walked divided by the number of dogs they have is 4/3. So, for Denali, (16 + 4x)/(12 + 4x) = 4/3.

Solving:

3*(16 + 4x) = 4*(12 + 4x)
48 + 12x = 48 + 16x
Subtract 48: 12x = 16x
Subtract 12x: 0 = 4x
So, x = 0.

Similarly, for Nate, (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

3*(16 - x) = 4*(12 + x)
48 - 3x = 48 + 4x
Subtract 48: -3x = 4x
Subtract -3x: 0 = 7x
So, x = 0.

Therefore, the only solution is x = 0, which is excluded. So, perhaps there is no such x, but the problem says x ≠ 0.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that x must be non-zero, but the equations only have x = 0 as a solution, which is invalid, so there is no solution.

But the problem says "Find x if x≠0," so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I need to model it differently. Maybe the ratio of the number of dogs walked to the number of dogs they have is the same. So, for Denali, (16 + 4x)/(12 + 4x) = 4/3, and for Nate, (12 + x)/(12 + x) = 1, which is not 4/3. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, unless the ratio is the number of dogs walked divided by the number of dogs they have, which is a fixed proportion. So, Denali has 12 animals, 16 dogs, so 16/12 = 4/3. If she walks 16 + 4x dogs, then her number of animals is 12 + 4x, so the ratio is (16 + 4x)/(12 + 4x) = 4/3. So, same as before.

Same for Nate: (12 + x)/(12 + x) = 1, which is not 4/3, so that's not the same ratio.

Wait, maybe they have to maintain the same proportion. So, if Denali's ratio is 4/3, then for her, (16 + 4x)/(12 + 4x) = 4/3. For Nate, (12 + x)/(12 + x) = 1. So, unless the ratios are equal, which would require 1 = 4/3, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is designed such that when they assign x dogs, the ratio remains the same, but in both scenarios, so the only way that can happen is if x = 0.

So, given all this, I think the only solution is x = 0, but since the problem says x ≠ 0, perhaps there is no solution. But since it's a math problem, I need to provide an answer. Maybe x = 0, but since it's excluded, perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the number of dogs they can walk is proportional to the animals they have. So, if they have 12 animals, they can walk 12 dogs. If they have 16 animals, they can walk 16 dogs. So, if they assign x dogs, their number of dogs they can walk is proportional to their animals.

So, Denali has 12 animals, so she can walk 12 dogs. If she walks 16 dogs, then the number of animals walked is 12*(16/12) = 16. Similarly, for Nate, he can walk 12 dogs for 12 animals. If he walks 16 dogs, he can walk 16 dogs for 16 animals. So, if they assign x dogs, Denali walks 12 + x dogs, and her number of animals walked is (12 + x)*(12/16) = (12 + x)*(3/4). Similarly, Nate walks 12 + x dogs, his number of animals walked is (12 + x)*(12/16) = same as Denali. So, their ratios would be the same.

Wait, but this is getting too convoluted. Perhaps the problem is designed so that when they assign dogs, the number of dogs they can walk is proportional to their animals, so the ratio remains 4/3. So, Denali walks 16 dogs for 12 animals, so for 16 dogs, her number of animals walked is 16*(12/16) = 12. So, her dogs walked is 16, animals walked is 12. So, ratio is 16/12 = 4/3.

Similarly, if she walks 16 + 4x dogs, her number of animals walked would be (16 + 4x)*(12/16) = (16 + 4x)*(3/4) = 12 + 3x.

Similarly, for Nate, walks 12 + x dogs, his number of animals walked is (12 + x)*(12/16) = (12 + x)*(3/4) = 9 + (3x)/4.

So, the ratio of dogs walked to animals walked is (16 + 4x)/(12) for Denali and (12 + x)/(12 + x) = 1 for Nate. Wait, that's not 4/3.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Given that all approaches lead to x = 0, and the problem says x ≠ 0, perhaps there is no solution. But the problem says "Find x if x≠0," so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as the total number of dogs and animals is fixed at 28. So, assigning x dogs to either Denali or Nate changes the number of dogs they have, but the total number of dogs is fixed.

So, if they assign x dogs, the new total number of dogs is 28 + x.

If assigning x dogs to Denali, her dogs walk 16 + x, and her animals walked are 12 + x.

So, the ratio is (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Similarly, assigning x dogs to Nate, his dogs walk 16 - x, and his animals walked are 12 + x.

So, the ratio is (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

So, solving both equations:

1. (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

2. (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3

But solving both leads to x = 0 in each case. So, again, x = 0 is the only solution, which is invalid.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when they assign x dogs, the number of dogs they have doesn't change, so assigning x dogs to either Denali or Nate changes the number of animals they have, but in a way that the ratio remains the same.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. I think I have to conclude that x = 0 is the only solution, which contradicts the problem's condition. Therefore, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it.

Wait, another idea: maybe the number of dogs they can walk is proportional to their number of dogs, not proportional to their animals. So, if they have 12 dogs, they can walk 12 dogs. If they have 16 dogs, they can walk 16 dogs, regardless of the number of animals. So, if they assign x dogs, their number of dogs walked is equal to their number of dogs.

So, Denali starts with 16 dogs and walks 16, so her dogs walked are 16. If she walks 16 + 4x dogs, her dogs walked are 16 + 4x. So, the ratio is (16 + 4x)/16 = 4/3. So, 16 + 4x = (4/3)*16 => 16 + 4x = 21.333... => 4x = 5.333... => x ≈ 1.333. But not an integer. So, x ≈ 4/3.

Similarly, Nate starts with 12 dogs and walks 12. If he walks 12 + x dogs, his dogs walked are 12 + x. Ratio is (12 + x)/12 = 4/3 => 12 + x = 16 => x = 4.

So, if x = 4, then:

First scenario: Assigning 4x = 16 dogs. So, Denali walks 16 + 16 = 32 dogs, her dogs walked are 16, so ratio is 32/16 = 2. But 2 ≠ 4/3.

Second scenario: Assigning x = 4 dogs. So, Denali walks 16 + 4 = 20 dogs, her dogs walked are 20. Ratio is 20/20 = 1. 1 ≠ 4/3.

Wait, that doesn't work either. So, perhaps the problem is not about the number of dogs walked, but about the pay.

Wait, if the pay is 16 and 12, and when they assign x dogs, the pay ratio remains the same, which is 4/3, then:

In the first scenario: Assigning 4x dogs, so Denali walks 16 + 4x, her pay is 16 + 4x, her dogs walked is 16 + 4x. So, the ratio is (16 + 4x)/(16 + 4x) = 1, but the problem says it's 4/3, so 1 = 4/3, impossible.

In the second scenario: Assigning x dogs, Denali walks 16 - x, her dogs walked is 16 - x. So, ratio is (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3 => 3*(16 - x) = 4*(12 + x) => 48 - 3x = 48 + 4x => -7x = 0 => x = 0.

So, the only solution is x = 0, which is invalid. Therefore, perhaps the problem has no solution, but the problem states x ≠ 0, so maybe it's a trick question.

Wait, another idea: maybe the problem is about the number of animals they have, not the number of dogs they can walk. So, if they assign x dogs, the number of animals they can walk is proportional. So, Denali can walk 12 dogs, 12 animals. So, if she walks 16 dogs, her number of animals walked is (16/12)*12 = 16. So, her dogs walked is 16, her animals walked is 16, so the ratio is 16/16 = 1. Similarly, for Nate, walking 16 dogs, his number of animals walked is (16/12)*12 = 16, so ratio is 16/16 = 1.

So, in both cases, the ratio is 1, which is not 4/3. So, that doesn't help.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when they assign x dogs, the number of dogs they can walk is proportional to the number of animals. So, Denali can walk 16 dogs for 12 animals, so the ratio is 16/12 = 4/3. If she walks 16 + 4x dogs for 12 animals, the ratio is (16 + 4x)/12 = 4/3. So, (16 + 4x)/12 = 4/3 => (16 + 4x) = 16 => 4x = 0 => x = 0.

Similarly, for Nate, (16 - x)/12 = 4/3 => 16 - x = 16 => -x = 0 => x = 0.

So, again, x = 0 is the only solution, which is invalid.

I think I've exhausted all possible interpretations, and each time, the only solution is x = 0, which is excluded. Therefore, perhaps the problem is designed with x = 0 in mind, but since x ≠ 0, there is no solution. But since it's a math problem, I need to provide an answer. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, I think I need to consider that when they assign x dogs, the number of dogs they have changes, so the pay per dog changes. So, if they assign x dogs, the pay per dog is 16 + x divided by the new number of dogs they have, which is 12 + x. So, the ratio is (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

So, solving:

3*(16 + x) = 4*(12 + x)

48 + 3x = 48 + 4x

3x = 4x => x = 0.

Same result.

Wait, given all this, I think the answer is x = 0, but since it's excluded, there is no solution. But the problem says x ≠ 0, so perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I need to consider that when they assign x dogs, the pay is adjusted proportionally, not equally. So, the pay per dog changes.

But in that case, the ratio would be different.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when they assign x dogs, the pay is adjusted so that the ratio remains the same, meaning that the pay is divided so that the ratio of dogs walked to animals is 4/3.

So, if they assign x dogs, the pay is adjusted so that (dogs walked)/(animals walked) = 4/3.

So, for Denali, who walks 16 + 4x dogs and has 12 + 4x animals, the ratio is (16 + 4x)/(12 + 4x) = 4/3.

Which gives x = 0.

Similarly, for Nate, (16 - x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Which gives x = 0.

Therefore, the only solution is x = 0, which is excluded. So, perhaps there is no solution, but since the problem says x ≠ 0, I need to conclude that x = 0.

But wait, since x = 0 is invalid, maybe I need to think differently. Maybe the problem is that when they assign x dogs, the pay per dog is adjusted so that the ratio remains the same, which is 4/3.

So, for Denali, (16 + x)/(12 + x) = 4/3.

Which again, leads to x = 0.

Alternatively, maybe the pay per animal is adjusted. So, if they assign x dogs, the pay per animal is adjusted so that the ratio remains 4/3.

So, Denali's pay per animal is (16 + x)/12 = 4/3. So, (16 + x)/12 = 4/3.

Multiply both sides by 12:

16 + x = 16 => x = 0.

Similarly, for Nate, (16 - x)/12 = 4/3 => same result, x = 0.

Therefore, again, x = 0.

I think I've tried all possible approaches, and the only solution is x = 0, which is excluded. Therefore, perhaps the problem is designed incorrectly, or I'm misunderstanding it.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
</think>

Denali works in 16 dogs, and Nate works in 12 dogs. The problem states that under the same policy, they are paid the same dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is the same as the ratio of their dogs, which is 4:3.

1. **Initial Ratio Calculation:**
   - Denali's pay: 16
   - Nate's pay: 12
   - Ratio: \(\frac{16}{12} = \frac{4}{3}\)

2. **Assigning \(x\) of Nate's dogs:**
   - Denali's new pay: \(16 + x\)
   - Nate's new pay: \(12 + x\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{16 + x}{12 + x}\)

3. **Setting the Ratios Equal:**
   - \(\frac{16 + x}{12 + x} = \frac{4}{3}\)
   - Cross-multiplying: \(3(16 + x) = 4(12 + x)\)
   - Simplifying: \(48 + 3x = 48 + 4x\)
   - Solving: \(3x = 4x \implies x = 0\)

4. **Assigning \(4x\) of Denali's dogs:**
   - Denali's new pay: \(16 + 4x\)
   - Nate's new pay: \(12 + 4x\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{16 + 4x}{12 + 4x}\)

5. **Setting the Ratios Equal:**
   - \(\frac{16 + 4x}{12 + 4x} = \frac{4}{3}\)
   - Cross-multiplying: \(3(16 + 4x) = 4(12 + 4x)\)
   - Simplifying: \(48 + 12x = 48 + 16x\)
   - Solving: \(12x = 16x \implies x = 0\)

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Both scenarios lead to \(x = 0\), which is invalid since \(x \neq 0\).

After considering all possible scenarios and solving the equations, the only solution is \(x = 0\), which is excluded. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
