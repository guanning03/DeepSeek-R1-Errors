Question:
Find the roots of $(x - 3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.$

Correct Answer:
Let $a = x - 3$ and $b = x - 7.$  Then we can write the given equation as
\[a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3.\]Expanding, we get $a^3 + b^3 = a^3 + 3a^2 b + 3ab^2 + b^3,$ so $3a^2 b + 3ab^2 = 0,$ which factors as
\[3ab(a + b) = 0.\]Thus, $a = 0,$ $b = 0,$ or $a + b = 0.$  Then $x - 3 = 0,$ $x - 7 = 0,$ or $2x - 10 = 0.$  This gives us the roots $\boxed{3, 5, 7}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this equation to solve: \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it somehow. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that sometimes equations with cubes can be tricky, but maybe there's a way to factor or expand the terms. Let me try expanding each of the cubes on both sides.

Starting with the left side: \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3\). I know the formula for expanding a cube is \((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\). Since both terms on the left have similar structures, maybe expanding them will help.

So, expanding \((x - 3)^3\):
- First term: \(x^3\)
- Second term: \(3x^2(-3) = -9x^2\)
- Third term: \(3x(-3)^2 = 3x*9 = 27x\)
- Fourth term: \((-3)^3 = -27\)

So, \((x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\).

Similarly, expanding \((x - 7)^3\):
- First term: \(x^3\)
- Second term: \(3x^2(-7) = -21x^2\)
- Third term: \(3x(-7)^2 = 3x*49 = 147x\)
- Fourth term: \((-7)^3 = -343\)

Thus, \((x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343\).

Now, adding these two expanded expressions together:

\[
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343)
\]

Combine like terms:

- \(x^3 + x^3 = 2x^3\)
- \(-9x^2 -21x^2 = -30x^2\)
- \(27x + 147x = 174x\)
- \(-27 -343 = -370\)

So the left side simplifies to \(2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370\).

Now, let me expand the right side: \((2x - 10)^3\).

Using the same cube expansion formula:
- First term: \((2x)^3 = 8x^3\)
- Second term: \(3*(2x)^2*(-10) = 3*4x^2*(-10) = -120x^2\)
- Third term: \(3*(2x)*(-10)^2 = 6x*100 = 600x\)
- Fourth term: \((-10)^3 = -1000\)

So, \((2x - 10)^3 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000\).

Now, let's rewrite the original equation with the expanded forms:

Left side: \(2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370\)

Right side: \(8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000\)

Bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:

\(2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 - (8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000) = 0\)

Distribute the negative sign:

\(2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 -8x^3 + 120x^2 -600x +1000 = 0\)

Combine like terms:

- \(2x^3 -8x^3 = -6x^3\)
- \(-30x^2 + 120x^2 = 90x^2\)
- \(174x -600x = -426x\)
- \(-370 + 1000 = 630\)

So the equation simplifies to:

\(-6x^3 + 90x^2 -426x +630 = 0\)

Hmm, that's a cubic equation. Maybe I can factor out a common factor first to simplify things. Let me see:

All coefficients are divisible by -6? Let's check:

-6x^3 ÷ -6 = x^3
90x^2 ÷ -6 = -15x^2
-426x ÷ -6 = 71x
630 ÷ -6 = -105

Wait, but factoring out -6 would give:

-6(x^3 -15x^2 +71x -105) = 0

But if I set it equal to zero and multiply both sides by -1, I get:

6(x^3 -15x^2 +71x -105) = 0

So, the equation is equivalent to:

x^3 -15x^2 +71x -105 = 0

Hmm, maybe I can factor this cubic equation. Let me try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (105) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (1). So possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±15, ±21, ±35, ±105.

Let me test x=3:

\(3^3 -15*(3)^2 +71*3 -105 = 27 - 135 + 213 -105\)

Calculate step by step:

27 -135 = -108

-108 +213 = 105

105 -105 = 0

Oh! So x=3 is a root. That means (x -3) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.

Let me use synthetic division with root 3.

Coefficients: 1 (x^3), -15 (x^2), 71 (x), -105 (constant)

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by 3 = 3. Add to next coefficient: -15 +3 = -12

Multiply -12 by 3 = -36. Add to 71: 71 -36 = 35

Multiply 35 by 3 = 105. Add to -105: -105 +105 =0

So, the cubic factors as (x -3)(x^2 -12x +35). Now, let's factor the quadratic:

x^2 -12x +35. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add to -12.

Factors of 35: 1&35, 5&7.

5 and 7 add to 12. Since the middle term is -12x, both numbers should be negative: -5 and -7.

Thus, x^2 -12x +35 factors as (x -5)(x -7).

Therefore, the cubic equation factors to:

(x -3)(x -5)(x -7) =0

So, the solutions are x=3, x=5, x=7.

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me verify if these solutions satisfy the original equation because sometimes when we cube both sides or manipulate equations, extraneous solutions can appear.

Let me plug x=3 into the original equation:

Left side: (3 -3)^3 + (3 -7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = 0 -64 = -64

Right side: (2*3 -10)^3 = (6 -10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64

So, both sides are equal. Good.

Now, x=5:

Left side: (5 -3)^3 + (5 -7)^3 = (2)^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 -8 =0

Right side: (2*5 -10)^3 = (10 -10)^3 =0^3=0

Equal again, so x=5 is a solution.

x=7:

Left side: (7 -3)^3 + (7 -7)^3 = (4)^3 +0 =64 +0=64

Right side: (2*7 -10)^3=(14 -10)^3=4^3=64

Equal as well. So all three solutions are valid.

But wait, just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other roots. Since the cubic equation factors to (x -3)(x -5)(x -7), these are the only roots, so these are all the solutions.

Therefore, the roots of the equation are x=3, x=5, and x=7.

**Final Answer**
The roots are \boxed{3}, \boxed{5}, and \boxed{7}.
</think>

To solve the equation \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\), we start by expanding each term.

First, we expand \((x - 3)^3\) and \((x - 7)^3\):

\[
(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27
\]
\[
(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343
\]

Adding these expansions together:

\[
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343)
\]
\[
= 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370
\]

Next, we expand \((2x - 10)^3\):

\[
(2x - 10)^3 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000
\]

We rewrite the original equation with the expanded forms:

\[
2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000
\]

Bringing all terms to one side:

\[
2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 - 8x^3 + 120x^2 - 600x + 1000 = 0
\]
\[
-6x^3 + 90x^2 - 426x + 630 = 0
\]

Factoring out \(-6\):

\[
-6(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105) = 0
\]

We solve the cubic equation \(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0\) using the Rational Root Theorem. Testing possible roots, we find \(x = 3\) is a root. Using synthetic division, we factor the cubic:

\[
(x - 3)(x^2 - 12x + 35) = 0
\]

Factoring the quadratic:

\[
(x - 3)(x - 5)(x - 7) = 0
\]

Thus, the solutions are \(x = 3\), \(x = 5\), and \(x = 7\). Verifying these solutions in the original equation confirms they are correct.

The roots are \(\boxed{3}\), \(\boxed{5}\), and \(\boxed{7}\).
