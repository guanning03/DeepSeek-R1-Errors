Question:
A figure skater is facing north when she begins to spin to her right. She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?

Correct Answer:
Each full circle is 360 degrees.  Dividing 360 into 2250 gives a quotient of 6 with a remainder of 90.  So, she spins 90 degrees to her right past north, which leaves her facing $\boxed{\text{east}}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, there's this figure skater who's facing north at the start. She starts spinning to her right, and she spins 2250 degrees. I need to find out which direction she's facing after that. Hmm, okay, let me break it down step by step.

First, when a figure skater spins to her right, she's rotating clockwise, right? So, her initial direction is north, and she's spinning in the clockwise direction. Now, she spins 2250 degrees. I need to figure out how this affects her final direction.

I remember that a full rotation is 360 degrees. So, if she spins 360 degrees, she'd end up facing the same direction she started. So, if she does multiple full rotations, she still ends up facing north. But here, she's only spinning 2250 degrees. That's more than one full rotation. Let me calculate how many full rotations she does and then the remaining degrees.

So, 2250 divided by 360. Let me do that division. 2250 รท 360. Hmm, 360 times 6 is 2160. So, 2250 minus 2160 is 90. So, 2250 degrees is equal to 6 full rotations and 90 extra degrees. That means she does 6 full spins (which bring her back to the starting point) and then spins an additional 90 degrees to her right.

So, starting from north, if she spins 90 degrees to her right, where would she end up? Let me visualize that. If she's facing north and spins right 90 degrees, that should be east, right? Because spinning right from north is east. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again.

When you spin to your right, your facing direction changes clockwise. So, north is the starting point. If you spin right 90 degrees, you turn towards the right side of north, which is east. Yeah, that seems right. So, after 2250 degrees, she's spun 6 full circles and then 90 degrees more to the right, which brings her to east.

Wait a second, hold on. Let me double-check. 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25. So, that's 6 full rotations and a quarter rotation. Hmm, 2250 degrees is 6 and 1/4 rotations. So, a quarter rotation from north facing right is east? So, 90 degrees to the right from north is indeed east.

But hold on, is a quarter rotation 90 degrees? Yes, because 360 divided by 4 is 90. So, 1/4 of a full rotation is 90 degrees. So, if she's spinning right, a quarter turn would be 90 degrees to the right, which is east. So, from north, spinning right 2250 degrees is the same as spinning right 90 degrees, which is east.

Wait, so is the answer east? Hmm, but I thought maybe it was south or west, but no, 90 degrees to the right from north is east. Hmm. Let me think if I made any mistakes.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the direction of rotation. If she's spinning to her right, then from north, spinning right 90 degrees is east. So, 2250 degrees is 6 full spins (back to original direction) plus 90 degrees right, which is east. So, she ends up east.

Alternatively, if she had spun left instead, each 90 degrees left would take her to south, then west, then north. But since she's spinning right, it's not left. So, 90 degrees right from north is east, correct.

Wait, but 2250 degrees is a lot. Let me calculate the total degrees she spins in terms of modulus 360. Because after every 360 degrees, she's back to the same spot. So, 2250 mod 360. Let's compute that.

2250 divided by 360 is 6 with a remainder. Let's compute 360 times 6 is 2160. 2250 minus 2160 is 90. So, 2250 mod 360 is 90 degrees. So, she's actually rotated 90 degrees to her right. So, starting from north, spinning 90 degrees right is east.

Wait, so yes, that's consistent. So, she ends up east. So, is that the answer? North, south, east, or west? East.

But hold on, another thought: when she's spinning to her right, does that mean she's rotating clockwise, which would be the same as 90 degrees to the right? So, yes, 90 degrees clockwise from north is east.

Alternatively, if she had spun to her left, it would be 90 degrees counter-clockwise, which would be west. So, in this case, she's spinning to her right, so 90 degrees clockwise, which is east.

Therefore, I think the answer is east.

Wait, but the question says she's facing north when she starts, and she spins 2250 degrees to her right. So, she ends up facing east. So, is she facing east?

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of positive and negative rotations. If she's spinning to the right, that is considered a positive rotation, but sometimes, in some contexts, it's considered negative. But in standard mathematical terms, positive rotation is counterclockwise, so if she's spinning to the right, that's clockwise, which is positive in some systems but negative in others. But in most cases, when you say spinning to your right, you might be referring to positive rotation.

Wait, but in terms of the coordinate system, if we consider north as positive y-axis and east as positive x-axis, then a positive rotation (counterclockwise) would be counter to the direction she's facing. So, if she's facing north and spins to the right, that would be a positive rotation, which is counter-clockwise, but I thought positive rotation was counterclockwise. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let's clarify. In standard mathematical terms, positive angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. But when we talk about someone spinning, we usually consider positive rotation as counterclockwise, and negative as clockwise. So, if someone is facing north and spins to their right, that is clockwise, which would be a negative rotation.

So, in that case, starting from north, a clockwise rotation of 2250 degrees. So, 2250 degrees clockwise is equivalent to a negative 2250 degrees counterclockwise.

So, 2250 degrees clockwise is the same as -2250 degrees in standard position.

But 2250 degrees clockwise is the same as 2250 degrees minus full rotations. So, as before, 2250 divided by 360 is 6 with a remainder of 90. So, 2250 degrees clockwise is equivalent to 90 degrees clockwise, which is the same as 90 degrees negative in standard position.

So, starting from north, a 90 degrees negative rotation (clockwise) would bring her to east. So, yes, same result.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of positive rotations, 2250 degrees clockwise is equivalent to 2250 - 6*360 = 2250 - 2160 = 90 degrees. So, 90 degrees clockwise is the same as 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Wait, no, 90 degrees clockwise is actually equivalent to 270 degrees counter-clockwise. Wait, no.

Wait, maybe I confused myself. Let me think clearly.

In standard position, angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. So, if I have a positive rotation, it's counterclockwise, negative is clockwise.

So, if she spins 2250 degrees clockwise, that's equivalent to a negative 2250 degrees. So, -2250 degrees is the same as 360 * 6 - 2250 = 2160 - 2250 = -90 degrees? Wait, no, that's not the right way.

Wait, no, let me think again. The total rotation is 2250 degrees clockwise. So, to convert that to standard position (counterclockwise), we can subtract it from 360 degrees. But since it's more than 360, we can divide it by 360 to get how many full rotations. 2250 divided by 360 is 6 with a remainder of 90. So, 2250 degrees clockwise is equal to 6 full rotations plus 90 degrees clockwise. So, 6 full rotations bring her back to the same position, and then 90 degrees more clockwise is the same as 90 degrees clockwise, which is 90 degrees in the clockwise direction.

Alternatively, 90 degrees clockwise is 270 degrees counter-clockwise. So, starting from north, 270 degrees counter-clockwise is west? Wait, no, 270 counter-clockwise from north is west? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, if you start at north and rotate 270 degrees counter-clockwise, that would bring you to west? Let me think. North is 0 degrees. Rotating 90 degrees counter-clockwise is east, 180 is south, 270 is west. Yeah, that's correct. So, 270 degrees counter-clockwise is west. So, 2250 degrees clockwise is 90 degrees clockwise, which is 270 degrees counter-clockwise, which is west.

Wait, hold on, now I'm getting confused. If 2250 degrees clockwise is 90 degrees clockwise, which is 270 degrees counter-clockwise, which is west. But earlier, I thought she ended up at east.

Wait, now I'm really confused. Which is correct? East or west?

Wait, no, hold on. If I rotate 2250 degrees clockwise, that's 6 full rotations (back to original) plus 90 degrees clockwise. So, starting from north, 90 degrees clockwise is east. So, she ends up facing east.

But wait, if I think about 2250 degrees counter-clockwise, which is 2250 mod 360, which is 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Starting from north, 90 degrees counter-clockwise is west. So, 2250 degrees counter-clockwise is west, but 2250 degrees clockwise is east. So, which is it?

Wait, the key is whether the rotation is positive or negative. In standard mathematics, positive is counterclockwise, negative is clockwise. So, if she's spinning to her right, which is clockwise, that's a positive rotation? Or negative?

Wait, no. If you spin to the right, that's a positive rotation if you consider the direction you're facing. Because if you're facing north and spin to your right, that's a positive rotation, which is clockwise. So, in that case, 2250 degrees is a positive rotation of 2250 degrees clockwise.

But in standard position, that would be equivalent to 90 degrees clockwise, which is east.

Alternatively, if you consider the rotation as negative, meaning clockwise is negative, then 2250 degrees clockwise is -2250 degrees in standard position. But -2250 degrees is the same as -2250 + 6*360 = -2250 + 2160 = -90 degrees.

So, -90 degrees is equivalent to 270 degrees counter-clockwise, which is west.

So, now I'm really confused because it depends on whether positive is clockwise or counter-clockwise.

Wait, so perhaps the key is in the direction she's spinning. If she's spinning to her right, is that a positive rotation or negative rotation?

In standard terms, positive rotation is counterclockwise, so if she's facing north and spins to her right, that is clockwise, which is a negative rotation. So, in that case, 2250 degrees clockwise is -2250 degrees.

But 2250 degrees clockwise is equal to 2250 - 6*360 = 2250 - 2160 = 90 degrees clockwise, which is -90 degrees.

So, starting from north, -90 degrees is 90 degrees clockwise, which is east.

Therefore, she ends up facing east.

Wait, so that's consistent. So, depending on whether positive is clockwise or counter-clockwise, the answer is different.

Wait, but in the mathematical system, positive is counterclockwise, so if she's spinning to her right, that is clockwise, so it's a negative rotation.

But since 2250 degrees clockwise is equivalent to -90 degrees, starting from north, that would be 90 degrees clockwise, which is east.

Alternatively, if positive is counterclockwise, then 2250 degrees clockwise is 2250 - 2160 = 90 degrees, so 90 degrees counter-clockwise is west.

Wait, so the confusion is arising because of the definition of positive rotation. In the problem statement, it says she spins to her right, so we need to figure out whether that is a positive or negative rotation.

Wait, in standard terms, positive rotation is counterclockwise, negative is clockwise. So, if she's spinning to her right, that would be a clockwise rotation, which is negative, so -2250 degrees.

But 2250 degrees clockwise is equal to -90 degrees. So, starting from north, that's 90 degrees clockwise, which is east.

Alternatively, if positive is counterclockwise, 2250 degrees clockwise is 2250 - 2160 = 90 degrees counter-clockwise, which is west.

Wait, now I'm really confused because the answer depends on the definition of positive rotation.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the problem's wording. It says "spinning to her right." So, in the context of a figure skater, when she spins to her right, that is a positive rotation, which is counterclockwise. So, is that correct?

Wait, actually, no. In standard terms, positive rotation is counterclockwise, but when you spin to the right, it's a positive rotation because your body is rotating in the direction you are facing. So, if you're facing north and spin to your right, that's counterclockwise, which is positive.

Wait, that might make more sense. So, spinning to your right is a positive rotation.

So, if she's spinning to her right, that is a positive rotation, which is counterclockwise.

So, in that case, 2250 degrees counterclockwise is the same as 2250 degrees.

But 2250 degrees counterclockwise is equivalent to 2250 mod 360, which is 90 degrees.

So, starting from north, 90 degrees counterclockwise is east. So, that would make her end up facing east.

Wait, that seems to make sense.

So, if positive rotation is counterclockwise, which is what standard mathematics says, and spinning to your right is a positive rotation, then 2250 degrees counterclockwise is equivalent to 90 degrees counterclockwise, which is east.

Alternatively, if positive rotation is clockwise, which is what I initially thought, but that would be conflicting with the skater's right spin.

Wait, no, in the mathematical system, positive is counterclockwise, so I think the correct answer is east.

But let me try to reconcile this.

If she's spinning to her right, which is a positive rotation, then 2250 degrees counterclockwise is 90 degrees counterclockwise, which is east.

Alternatively, if we consider that spinning to the right is a positive rotation, which is counterclockwise, that's correct.

Wait, but in standard terms, positive rotation is counterclockwise, so if she's spinning to her right, which is counterclockwise, so that's positive.

So, 2250 degrees counterclockwise is 90 degrees counterclockwise, which is east.

Alternatively, in some contexts, people define positive rotation as clockwise, so that would be negative degrees. So, spinning to the right is a positive rotation in that case, but that's conflicting with our initial thought.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because of the direction of rotation.

Wait, let me think of the figure skating scenario.

When a skater spins to her right, she's turning her body to the right, which is counterclockwise, relative to her body, but when we consider the global coordinate system, her right is actually to her left.

Wait, no, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the direction she's facing. So, starting from north, if she spins 90 degrees to her right, that is, counterclockwise, she would face east. If she spins 90 degrees to her left, that's clockwise, she would face west.

But in this case, she's spinning to her right, which is a positive rotation, so counterclockwise, which is 90 degrees, leading her to face east.

Alternatively, if she's spinning to her right, it's a positive rotation, which is counterclockwise, so 90 degrees counterclockwise is east.

Therefore, the answer is east.

But hold on, just to make sure, maybe I should draw it out.

Imagine the skater starts facing north. She spins 2250 degrees to her right. So, each 90 degrees is a direction change.

Starting at north:

1. Spin 90 degrees right: east
2. Spin another 90 degrees right: south
3. Spin another 90 degrees right: west
4. Spin another 90 degrees right: north
5. Spin another 90 degrees right: east
6. Spin another 90 degrees right: south
7. Repeat.

So, 2250 degrees is 6 full spins (doing north->east->south->west->north->east->south->west->north->east->south->west->north) and then an additional 90 degrees.

Wait, each full spin is 360, which cycles her back to north. So, 2250 divided by 360 is 6 with a remainder of 90. So, she does 6 full spins and 90 degrees more.

So, starting from north, after 90 degrees right, she is facing east. So, yes, the answer is east.

Therefore, I think east is the correct answer.

But just to make sure, let me verify with another method.

Another way to think about it is to calculate the total degrees in terms of modulus. So, 2250 mod 360 is 90, as we had before. So, she ends up facing 90 degrees to her right, which is east.

Alternatively, using modular arithmetic, starting angle is 0 degrees north, and each 90 degrees right is adding 90 degrees to the angle, but since it's a full circle, we can add 90 degrees each time.

But since 2250 is a multiple, we can just compute 2250 mod 360, which is 90, so 90 degrees to the right from north is east.

So, yes, that's consistent.

Therefore, the skater ends up facing east when she finishes her spin.

**Final Answer**
The skater is facing \boxed{E} when she finishes her spin.
</think>

The figure skater starts facing north and spins 2250 degrees to her right. To determine her final direction, we need to calculate the effective rotation after accounting for full circles.

1. A full rotation is 360 degrees. We calculate how many full rotations 2250 degrees is:
   \[
   2250 \div 360 = 6 \text{ full rotations with a remainder}
   \]
   \[
   2250 - (6 \times 360) = 2250 - 2160 = 90 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, 2250 degrees is equivalent to 6 full rotations plus an additional 90 degrees.

2. Starting from north, a full rotation (360 degrees) brings her back to the same direction. Therefore, after 6 full rotations, she is still facing north. The remaining 90 degrees is a quarter rotation.

3. A spin to the right (clockwise) is a positive rotation in standard terms, which is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation from north. Clockwise from north:
   - 90 degrees clockwise from north is east.

Thus, the skater ends up facing east.

\[
\boxed{E}
\]
