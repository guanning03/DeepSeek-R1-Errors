Question:
An equiangular octagon has four sides of length $1$ and four sides of length $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, arranged so that no two consecutive sides have the same length. What is the area of the octagon?

Correct Answer:
The octagon can be partitioned into five squares and four half squares, each with side length $\sqrt{2}/2$, so its area is \[
\displaystyle\left(5+4 \cdot \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\displaystyle\right)^{2}= \boxed{\frac{7}{2}}.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem about an equiangular octagon. It's supposed to have four sides of length 1 and four sides of length √2/2, arranged so that no two consecutive sides have the same length. I need to find its area. Hmm, okay.

First of all, let me recall what an equiangular octagon is. It's an eight-sided polygon where all the internal angles are equal. For a regular octagon, both the sides and angles are equal, but in this case, it's only equiangular, meaning the sides can be different lengths, but all the angles are the same. So, it's not regular, but it's still equiangular.

Since it's equiangular, each internal angle should be the same. Let me figure out what that angle is. The formula for the internal angle of a regular polygon is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. So for an octagon, n=8. So ((8-2)*180)/8 = (6*180)/8 = 1080/8 = 135 degrees. So each internal angle is 135 degrees.

Alright, so all internal angles are 135 degrees. Now, the sides alternate between lengths 1 and √2/2, but since no two consecutive sides can have the same length, it must alternate between 1 and √2/2 around the octagon.

So, the octagon has sides: 1, √2/2, 1, √2/2, 1, √2/2, 1, √2/2, and back to 1. So the sides go 1, √2/2, 1, √2/2, etc.

Now, to find the area. Hmm, since it's equiangular, but sides are of two different lengths, I might need to use coordinate geometry or maybe some trigonometry.

I think a good approach is to place the octagon on a coordinate system, starting at a point, and then using vectors or coordinates to find the positions of all the vertices, and then apply the shoelace formula to calculate the area. But that might be complicated, especially since the sides are of different lengths and the angles are all 135 degrees. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, another thought. Since it's equiangular, we can model the sides as vectors in the plane, each turning 45 degrees from the previous one because the external angle is 45 degrees (since internal angle is 135, so external is 180-135=45). So, each side can be represented as a vector, with length 1 or √2/2, each turned 45 degrees from the last.

So, if I model each side as a vector in the complex plane, adding them up should bring me back to the starting point, which is the condition for a polygon. So, the sum of all vectors should be zero.

Therefore, if I denote each side as vectors, each turning 45 degrees, the sum should equal zero. So, I can model each side's direction as a complex number, with magnitude 1 or √2/2, and angles 0°, 45°, 90°, etc., alternating.

Wait, but since the sides alternate between 1 and √2/2, we can assign each side a direction. Let me think.

Let me assign the first side as length 1, along the x-axis. So, the first vector is (1, 0). Then, the next side is length √2/2, but in a direction 45 degrees from the previous one. Wait, no, the external angle is 45 degrees, which means the direction of each consecutive side is 45 degrees from the previous.

So, if the first side is along the x-axis, the next side is at 45 degrees, then the next is 90 degrees, and so on.

Wait, but it alternates? Hmm, the problem says that no two consecutive sides have the same length, but it doesn't specify the order of lengths. It just says four sides of length 1 and four sides of length √2/2, arranged so that no two consecutive sides have the same length.

So, the arrangement must be 1, √2/2, 1, √2/2, etc. So, sides alternate between 1 and √2/2, not necessarily starting with 1.

Wait, but since it's a polygon, the sides must be arranged in a cyclic manner. So, if we start with 1, then the next is √2/2, then 1, then √2/2, etc., until we come back to the starting point. So, the sides alternate between 1 and √2/2, each time turning 45 degrees.

Therefore, the direction of each side alternates by 45 degrees. So, starting with 1 along 0°, then √2/2 at 45°, then 1 at 90°, then √2/2 at 135°, and so on.

So, in total, the direction of each side is 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°, and back to 0°, for eight sides.

But since it's a polygon, the sum of all vectors should be zero. So, if I model each side as a complex number, each with magnitude 1 or √2/2, direction 0°, 45°, 90°, etc., the sum of these vectors must be zero.

So, let's denote each vector as a complex number. Let me assign each vector as follows:

v1 = 1 * e^{i0°} = 1 + 0i

v2 = √2/2 * e^{i45°} = √2/2 (cos45° + i sin45°) = √2/2 (√2/2 + i√2/2) = (√2 * √2)/4 + i (√2 * √2)/4 = 0.5 + 0.5i

v3 = 1 * e^{i90°} = 0 + 1i

v4 = √2/2 * e^{i135°} = √2/2 (cos135° + i sin135°) = √2/2 (-√2/2 + i√2/2) = (-0.5) + 0.5i

v5 = 1 * e^{i180°} = -1 + 0i

v6 = √2/2 * e^{i225°} = √2/2 (cos225° + i sin225°) = √2/2 (-√2/2 - i√2/2) = (-0.5) - 0.5i

v7 = 1 * e^{i270°} = 0 - 1i

v8 = √2/2 * e^{i315°} = √2/2 (cos315° + i sin315°) = √2/2 (√2/2 - i√2/2) = 0.5 - 0.5i

Now, let me write down all these vectors and sum them up:

v1: 1 + 0i

v2: 0.5 + 0.5i

v3: 0 + 1i

v4: -0.5 + 0.5i

v5: -1 + 0i

v6: -0.5 - 0.5i

v7: 0 - 1i

v8: 0.5 - 0.5i

Now, let's sum the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.

Real parts:

v1: 1

v2: 0.5

v3: 0

v4: -0.5

v5: -1

v6: -0.5

v7: 0

v8: 0.5

Sum of real parts: 1 + 0.5 + 0 - 0.5 - 1 - 0.5 + 0 + 0.5

Let me compute step by step:

1 + 0.5 = 1.5

1.5 + 0 = 1.5

1.5 - 0.5 = 1.0

1.0 - 1 = 0.0

0.0 - 0.5 = -0.5

-0.5 + 0 = -0.5

-0.5 + 0.5 = 0.0

So, the sum of real parts is 0.

Imaginary parts:

v1: 0

v2: 0.5

v3: 1

v4: 0.5

v5: 0

v6: -0.5

v7: -1

v8: -0.5

Sum of imaginary parts: 0 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 + 0 - 0.5 - 1 - 0.5

Compute step by step:

0 + 0.5 = 0.5

0.5 + 1 = 1.5

1.5 + 0.5 = 2.0

2.0 + 0 = 2.0

2.0 - 0.5 = 1.5

1.5 - 1 = 0.5

0.5 - 0.5 = 0.0

So, the sum of imaginary parts is 0.

Therefore, the total sum is 0 + 0i, which confirms that the polygon closes correctly.

But wait, that was for a specific arrangement of sides: starting with 1, then √2/2, etc. The problem states that it's arranged such that no two consecutive sides have the same length, which is satisfied here (alternating 1 and √2/2). So, that seems okay.

But does this arrangement correspond to a non-intersecting octagon? I think so, but since all sides are positive and angles are less than 180°, it should be convex.

Wait, but actually, in a regular octagon, all sides and angles are equal, but here it's not regular. However, since the sides are of two different lengths, the octagon might not be convex. But in this case, all the internal angles are 135°, which is less than 180°, so it should still be convex.

So, now that I know that, maybe I can proceed to calculate the coordinates of each vertex by adding up the vectors step by step.

Let me assign coordinates to each vertex by starting at (0,0) and then adding each vector in sequence.

Let me denote the starting point as point A0(0,0). Then, the first vector is v1 = (1, 0), so point A1 is A0 + v1 = (1, 0).

Next, vector v2 is (√2/2, √2/2), so point A2 is A1 + v2 = (1 + √2/2, 0 + √2/2).

Vector v3 is (0, 1), so point A3 is A2 + v3 = (1 + √2/2, √2/2 + 1).

Vector v4 is (-√2/2, √2/2), so point A4 is A3 + v4 = (1 + √2/2 - √2/2, √2/2 + 1 + √2/2) = (1, 1 + √2).

Vector v5 is (-1, 0), so point A5 is A4 + v5 = (1 - 1, 1 + √2 + 0) = (0, 1 + √2).

Vector v6 is (-√2/2, -√2/2), so point A6 is A5 + v6 = (0 - √2/2, 1 + √2 - √2/2) = (-√2/2, 1 + √2/2).

Vector v7 is (0, -1), so point A7 is A6 + v7 = (-√2/2, 1 + √2/2 - 1) = (-√2/2, √2/2).

Vector v8 is (√2/2, -√2/2), so point A8 is A7 + v8 = (-√2/2 + √2/2, √2/2 - √2/2) = (0, 0), which brings us back to the starting point, as expected.

So, the coordinates of the vertices are:

A0: (0, 0)

A1: (1, 0)

A2: (1 + √2/2, √2/2)

A3: (1 + √2/2, √2/2 + 1)

A4: (1, 1 + √2)

A5: (0, 1 + √2)

A6: (-√2/2, 1 + √2/2)

A7: (-√2/2, √2/2)

A8: (0, 0)

Okay, so now that we have all the coordinates, we can use the shoelace formula to find the area.

The shoelace formula is given by:

Area = 1/2 |sum_{i=0 to n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|

Where (x_n, y_n) is (x_0, y_0), so it wraps around.

So, let me list all the coordinates in order:

A0: (0, 0)

A1: (1, 0)

A2: (1 + √2/2, √2/2)

A3: (1 + √2/2, √2/2 + 1)

A4: (1, 1 + √2)

A5: (0, 1 + √2)

A6: (-√2/2, 1 + √2/2)

A7: (-√2/2, √2/2)

A8: (0, 0)

So, to apply shoelace, I need to compute each x_i * y_{i+1} and x_{i+1} * y_i for i from 0 to 7, then sum them and take the absolute value.

Let me make a table for this:

i | x_i    | y_i    | x_{i+1} | y_{i+1} | x_i y_{i+1} | x_{i+1} y_i
---|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------
0 | 0      | 0      | 1      | 0      | 0*0=0        | 1*0=0
1 | 1      | 0      | 1 + √2/2 | √2/2 | 1*(√2/2) ≈ 0.7071 | (1 + √2/2)*0 = 0
2 | 1 + √2/2 | √2/2 | 1 + √2/2 | √2/2 +1 | (1 + √2/2)*(√2/2 +1) | (1 + √2/2)*(√2/2)
3 | 1        | 1 + √2  | 1        | 1 + √2 | 1*(1 + √2) ≈ 2.4142 | 1*(1 + √2)
4 | 1        | 1 + √2  | 0        | 1 + √2 | 1*(1 + √2) ≈ 2.4142 | 0*(1 + √2) = 0
5 | 0        | 1 + √2  | -√2/2  | 1 + √2/2 | 0*(1 + √2/2) = 0 | (-√2/2)*(1 + √2)
6 | -√2/2  | 1 + √2/2 | -√2/2  | √2/2   | (-√2/2)*(√2/2) = (-2)/4 = -0.5 | (-√2/2)*(1 + √2)
7 | -√2/2  | √2/2   | 0        | 0        | (-√2/2)*0 = 0     | 0*(√2/2) = 0
8 | 0        | 0      | 0        | 0      | 0*0 = 0       | 0*0 = 0

Wait, I need to compute these step by step.

Wait, actually, it's better to do it step by step without approximating, maybe using exact expressions.

Let me compute each term exactly.

Starting with i=0:

x0=0, y0=0

x1=1, y1=0

x0 y1 = 0*0 = 0

x1 y0 = 1*0 = 0

Difference: 0 - 0 = 0

i=1:

x1=1, y1=0

x2 = 1 + √2/2, y2 = √2/2

x1 y2 = 1*(√2/2) = √2/2

x2 y1 = (1 + √2/2)*0 = 0

Difference: √2/2 - 0 = √2/2

i=2:

x2=1 + √2/2, y2=√2/2

x3=1 + √2/2, y3=√2/2 +1

x2 y3 = (1 + √2/2)*(√2/2 +1)

Let me compute that:

Multiply (1 + √2/2)(1 + √2/2) = (1 + √2/2)^2 = 1 + √2 + (√2)^2/4 = 1 + √2 + 2/4 = 1 + √2 + 0.5 = 1.5 + √2

But wait, that's incorrect because it's (1 + √2/2)(1 + √2/2) is (1 + √2/2)^2, which is indeed 1 + √2 + (√2/2)^2 = 1 + √2 + 0.5 = 1.5 + √2.

Wait, but in reality, x2 y3 is (1 + √2/2)*(√2/2 +1). Hmm, actually, it's (1 + √2/2)*(1 + √2/2) = (1 + √2/2)^2 = 1 + √2 + (√2/2)^2 = 1 + √2 + 0.5 = 1.5 + √2.

But wait, that's the same as (1 + √2/2)^2, so yes, that term is 1.5 + √2.

But wait, in reality, x2 is 1 + √2/2, and y3 is √2/2 + 1, which is the same as (1 + √2/2), so their product is (1 + √2/2)^2 = 1 + √2 + 0.5 = 1.5 + √2.

So, x2 y3 = 1.5 + √2.

x3 y2 = (1 + √2/2)*(√2/2) = (1)*(√2/2) + (√2/2)*(√2/2) = √2/2 + (2/4) = √2/2 + 0.5

Difference: (1.5 + √2) - (√2/2 + 0.5) = 1.5 - 0.5 + √2 - √2/2 = 1 + √2/2

i=3:

x3=1 + √2/2, y3=√2/2 +1

x4=1, y4=1 + √2

x3 y4 = (1 + √2/2)*(1 + √2) = Let's compute:

Multiply (1 + √2/2)(1 + √2) = 1*(1) + 1*(√2) + (√2/2)*1 + (√2/2)*(√2)

= 1 + √2 + √2/2 + (2)/2

= 1 + √2 + √2/2 +1

= 2 + (3√2)/2

x4 y3 = (1)*(√2/2 +1) = √2/2 +1

Difference: (2 + (3√2)/2) - (√2/2 +1) = (2 -1) + (3√2/2 - √2/2) = 1 + √2

i=4:

x4=1, y4=1 + √2

x5=0, y5=1 + √2

x4 y5 = 1*(1 + √2) = 1 + √2

x5 y4 = 0*(1 + √2) = 0

Difference: 1 + √2 - 0 = 1 + √2

i=5:

x5=0, y5=1 + √2

x6= -√2/2, y6=1 + √2/2

x5 y6 = 0*(1 + √2/2) = 0

x6 y5 = (-√2/2)*(1 + √2) = (-√2/2)*(1) + (-√2/2)*(√2) = -√2/2 - (√2*√2)/2 = -√2/2 - 2/2 = -√2/2 -1

Difference: 0 - (-√2/2 -1) = √2/2 +1

i=6:

x6= -√2/2, y6=1 + √2/2

x7= -√2/2, y7=√2/2

x6 y7 = (-√2/2)*(√2/2) = (-2)/4 = -0.5

x7 y6 = (-√2/2)*(1 + √2/2) = (-√2/2)*1 + (-√2/2)*(√2/2) = -√2/2 - (2)/4 = -√2/2 - 0.5

Difference: (-0.5) - (-√2/2 - 0.5) = (-0.5) + √2/2 +0.5 = √2/2

i=7:

x7= -√2/2, y7=√2/2

x8=0, y8=0

x7 y8 = (-√2/2)*0 = 0

x8 y7 = 0*(√2/2) = 0

Difference: 0 - 0 = 0

Now, let me list all the differences:

i=0: 0

i=1: √2/2

i=2: 1 + √2/2

i=3: 1 + √2

i=4: 1 + √2

i=5: √2/2 +1

i=6: √2/2

i=7: 0

So, adding them up:

0 + √2/2 + (1 + √2/2) + (1 + √2) + (1 + √2) + (√2/2 +1) + √2/2 + 0

Let me compute step by step:

Start with 0.

Add √2/2: total is √2/2

Add 1 + √2/2: total becomes √2/2 +1 + √2/2 = 1 + √2

Add 1 + √2: total becomes 1 + √2 +1 + √2 = 2 + 2√2

Add 1 + √2: total becomes 2 + 2√2 +1 + √2 = 3 + 3√2

Add √2/2 +1: total becomes 3 + 3√2 +√2/2 +1 = 4 + (7√2)/2

Add √2/2: total becomes 4 + (7√2)/2 + √2/2 = 4 + (8√2)/2 = 4 +4√2

So, the sum of x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i is 4 +4√2

Therefore, the area is (1/2)*|4 +4√2| = (1/2)*(4 +4√2) = 2 +2√2

So, the area is 2 + 2√2.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just verify if I did the shoelace correctly because it's easy to make a mistake in the calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the octagon as a combination of simpler shapes. Since the octagon is equiangular, with sides of two different lengths, and we've arranged them in an alternating pattern, perhaps it's a combination of rectangles and squares or something similar.

But given that I have the coordinates, and by shoelace formula, I computed the area as 2 + 2√2. Let me see if that makes sense.

Wait, another way to think about it: an equiangular octagon with sides 1 and √2/2. Maybe it's a modification of a square or something.

But, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it by dividing the octagon into triangles or other shapes.

But given that I've already used the shoelace formula by coordinates, and arrived at 2 + 2√2, which is approximately 2 + 2.828 ≈ 4.828. Let me see if that seems reasonable.

Given that the sides are of length 1 and ~0.707, the octagon is somewhat stretched or compressed, but an area of about 4.8 seems plausible.

Wait, but let me just check my shoelace steps again because it's easy to make a mistake.

So, the coordinates are:

A0: (0,0)

A1: (1,0)

A2: (1 + √2/2, √2/2)

A3: (1 + √2/2, √2/2 +1)

A4: (1, 1 + √2)

A5: (0, 1 + √2)

A6: (-√2/2, 1 + √2/2)

A7: (-√2/2, √2/2)

A8: (0,0)

So, for each i, I computed x_i y_{i+1} and x_{i+1} y_i, subtracted, and summed.

I think I might have messed up the sign somewhere. Let me re-examine the shoelace formula.

The shoelace formula is:

Area = 1/2 |sum_{i=0 to n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|

So, for each edge, we take the x_i times y_{i+1} minus x_{i+1} times y_i, sum them up, take absolute value, and divide by 2.

So, in my earlier calculation, I think I correctly computed each x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i, and summed them. So, the sum was 4 +4√2, so area is 2 +2√2.

Hmm, seems correct.

Wait, but let me check the coordinates again because sometimes I might have miscalculated the y-values.

Let me go through each step again.

Starting at A0(0,0).

A1: A0 + v1 = (1,0). Correct.

A2: A1 + v2 = (1 + √2/2, 0 + √2/2). Correct.

A3: A2 + v3 = (1 + √2/2 + 0, √2/2 +1) = (1 + √2/2, √2/2 +1). Correct.

A4: A3 + v4 = (1 + √2/2 +1, √2/2 +1 + √2/2) = (2 + √2/2, 1 + √2). Wait, hold on, is that correct?

Wait, v4 is 1, √2/2, but it's in the direction of 135°, so adding that to A3.

A3 is (1 + √2/2, √2/2 +1)

Adding v4: x increases by 1, y increases by √2/2.

So, A4 is (1 + √2/2 +1, √2/2 +1 + √2/2) = (2 + √2/2, 1 + √2). Correct.

A5: A4 + v5 = (2 + √2/2 + (-1), 1 + √2 + 0) = (1 + √2/2, 1 + √2). Correct.

A6: A5 + v6 = (1 + √2/2 + (-√2/2), 1 + √2 + (-√2/2)) = (1, 1 + √2/2). Correct.

A7: A6 + v7 = (1 + 0, 1 + √2/2 + (-√2/2)) = (1,1). Wait, that can't be right because v7 is 0, -1. Wait, no, v7 is a vector of length √2/2 at 270°, which is (0, -√2/2). So, A6 is (1,1 + √2/2), adding v7: (1 +0, 1 + √2/2 - √2/2) = (1,1). Wait, that contradicts because earlier, after adding v7, I thought A7 was (-√2/2, √2/2). Wait, no, that was my mistake.

Wait, A6 is (1,1 + √2/2). Adding v7, which is (0, -√2/2):

A7: (1 + 0, 1 + √2/2 - √2/2) = (1,1). Correct.

Then, adding v8: A7 + v8 = (1 +0,1 - √2/2) = (1, 1 - √2/2). But wait, that's different from my earlier coordinate.

Wait, I think I made an error in the coordinate of A7.

Wait, let me recast this.

After A6: (1,1 + √2/2)

Adding v7: (0, -√2/2), so A7 is (1 +0,1 + √2/2 - √2/2) = (1,1). Correct.

Then, adding v8: (0, -√2/2), so A8 is (1 +0,1 - √2/2) = (1,1 - √2/2). But in my earlier coordinates, I had A7 as (-√2/2, √2/2). Wait, that was a mistake.

So, in fact, A7 is (1,1). Then, A8 is (1,1 - √2/2). But A8 is supposed to be (0,0). Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, no, in my initial calculation, I thought A8 was (0,0). But according to this, it's (1,1 - √2/2). But that's inconsistent.

Wait, hold on, let me check my earlier steps.

Wait, actually, v8 is (√2/2, -√2/2). So, adding to A7: (1,1) + (√2/2, -√2/2) = (1 + √2/2,1 - √2/2). So, A8 should be (1 + √2/2,1 - √2/2). But that's not (0,0). So, it's inconsistent.

Wait, that's a problem. So, where did I go wrong?

Wait, in my initial calculation, I thought of v8 as (√2/2, -√2/2). But when I added that to A7, which was (-√2/2, √2/2), I got (0,0). But according to this, it should be (1 + √2/2,1 - √2/2). So, which one is correct?

Wait, let me check my step-by-step addition earlier.

From A7: (-√2/2, √2/2)

Adding v8: (√2/2, -√2/2)

So, x: -√2/2 + √2/2 = 0

y: √2/2 - √2/2 = 0

So, A8 is (0,0). But according to my later coordinate calculation, I thought A8 was (1,1 - √2/2). So, which is correct?

Wait, this is a crucial point. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my coordinate assignments earlier.

Wait, I thought that to close the octagon, A8 should be (0,0), but according to the shoelace formula, the coordinates of A7 should be (-√2/2, √2/2), and adding v8 gives (0,0). So, perhaps my initial shoelace calculation was wrong because I misapplied the direction of the sides.

Wait, so if I actually compute each coordinate step by step, perhaps I can find the correct coordinates.

Let me start again:

A0: (0,0)

v1: (1,0), so A1: (1,0)

v2: (√2/2, √2/2), so A2: (1 + √2/2, √2/2)

v3: (0,1), so A3: (1 + √2/2, √2/2 +1)

v4: (-√2/2, √2/2), so A4: (1 + √2/2 - √2/2, √2/2 +1 + √2/2) = (1, 1 + √2)

v5: (-1,0), so A5: (1 -1,1 + √2) = (0,1 + √2)

v6: (-√2/2, -√2/2), so A6: (0 - √2/2,1 + √2 - √2/2) = (-√2/2,1 + √2/2)

v7: (0,-1), so A7: (-√2/2,1 + √2/2 -1) = (-√2/2, √2/2)

v8: (√2/2, -√2/2), so A8: (-√2/2 + √2/2, √2/2 - √2/2) = (0,0)

So, A8 is (0,0), correct.

Therefore, my earlier step-by-step was correct, but in my initial shoelace calculation, I must have made an error in adding v8. So, in the shoelace formula, A8 is (0,0), which is correct.

Wait, let me recast the shoelace coordinates correctly:

A0: (0,0)

A1: (1,0)

A2: (1 + √2/2, √2/2)

A3: (1 + √2/2, √2/2 +1)

A4: (1,1 + √2)

A5: (0,1 + √2)

A6: (-√2/2,1 + √2/2)

A7: (-√2/2, √2/2)

A8: (0,0)

So, the shoelace coordinates are as follows:

0: (0,0)

1: (1,0)

2: (1 + √2/2, √2/2)

3: (1 + √2/2, √2/2 +1)

4: (1,1 + √2)

5: (0,1 + √2)

6: (-√2/2,1 + √2/2)

7: (-√2/2, √2/2)

8: (0,0)

So, now, let me recompute each term x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i.

i=0:

x0=0, y0=0

x1=1, y1=0

Term: 0*0 -1*0=0

i=1:

x1=1, y1=0

x2=1 + √2/2, y2=√2/2

Term:1*√2/2 - (1 + √2/2)*0= √2/2

i=2:

x2=1 + √2/2, y2=√2/2

x3=1 + √2/2, y3=√2/2 +1

Term: (1 + √2/2)*(√2/2 +1) - (1 + √2/2)*√2/2

Let me compute:

First part: (1 + √2/2)*(√2/2 +1) = (1)(√2/2) + (1)(1) + (√2/2)(√2/2) + (√2/2)(1)

= √2/2 +1 + (2)/4 + √2/2

= √2/2 +1 + 0.5 + √2/2

=1 + √2/2 +0.5 + √2/2

=1.5 + √2

Second part: (1 + √2/2)*√2/2 = √2/2 + (√2/2)(√2/2) = √2/2 + (2)/4 = √2/2 +0.5

So, Term: (1.5 + √2) - (√2/2 +0.5) = 1.5 -0.5 + √2 -√2/2 =1 + √2/2

i=3:

x3=1 + √2/2, y3=√2/2 +1

x4=1, y4=1 + √2

Term: (1 + √2/2)*(1 + √2) -1*(√2/2 +1)

Compute:

First part: (1 + √2/2)*(1 + √2) =1*(1) +1*√2 + (√2/2)*1 + (√2/2)*√2

=1 + √2 + √2/2 + (2)/2

=1 + √2 + √2/2 +1

=2 + (3√2)/2

Second part:1*(√2/2 +1) = √2/2 +1

So, Term: (2 + (3√2)/2) - (√2/2 +1) =2 -1 + (3√2)/2 -√2/2 =1 + √2

i=4:

x4=1, y4=1 + √2

x5=0, y5=1 + √2

Term:1*(1 + √2) -0*(1 + √2)=1 + √2 -0=1 + √2

i=5:

x5=0, y5=1 + √2

x6=-√2/2, y6=1 + √2/2

Term:0*(1 + √2/2) - (-√2/2)*(1 + √2)=0 + (√2/2)*(1 + √2)=√2/2 + (√2/2)(√2)=√2/2 +1

i=6:

x6=-√2/2, y6=1 + √2/2

x7=-√2/2, y7=√2/2

Term: (-√2/2)*(√2/2) - (-√2/2)*(1 + √2/2)= (-2)/4 - (-√2/2 - (√2/2)^2)= (-0.5) - (-√2/2 - 0.5)= -0.5 +√2/2 +0.5= √2/2

i=7:

x7=-√2/2, y7=√2/2

x8=0, y8=0

Term: (-√2/2)*0 -0*(√2/2)=0 -0=0

So, summing all terms:

i=0: 0

i=1: √2/2

i=2:1 + √2/2

i=3:1 + √2

i=4:1 + √2

i=5:√2/2 +1

i=6:√2/2

i=7:0

Adding these:

Start with 0.

Add √2/2: total √2/2

Add 1 + √2/2: total 1 + √2

Add 1 + √2: total 2 + 2√2

Add 1 + √2: total 3 + 3√2

Add √2/2 +1: total 4 + 4√2/2 =4 + 2√2

Add √2/2: total 4 + 2√2 + √2/2 =4 + (5√2)/2

Add 0: remains 4 + (5√2)/2

Wait, that's different from before. So, previously, I had 4 +4√2, but now it's 4 + (5√2)/2. So, which is correct?

Wait, let me recast the terms:

i=0: 0

i=1: √2/2 ≈0.707

i=2:1 + √2/2≈1.707

i=3:1 + √2≈2.414

i=4:1 + √2≈2.414

i=5:√2/2 +1≈1.707

i=6:√2/2≈0.707

i=7:0

Total sum: 0 +0.707 +1.707 +2.414 +2.414 +1.707 +0.707≈0.707 +1.707=2.414; 2.414 +2.414=4.828; 4.828 +1.707=6.535; 6.535 +0.707≈7.242

Wait, 4 + (5√2)/2≈4 +3.535≈7.535, which is close to my approximate calculation of 7.242. Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the shoelace formula.

Wait, the shoelace formula is 1/2 |sum(x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|, so in my latest coordinate calculation, the sum is 4 + (5√2)/2≈4 +3.535≈7.535, so the area is half of that, which is approximately 3.7675.

But in the previous calculation, I had total sum of 4 +4√2≈4 +5.656≈9.656, so area≈4.828.

There's a huge discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let's see. If the shoelace formula is 1/2 |sum(x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|, and in my latest coordinate calculation, I have the sum as 4 + (5√2)/2, so the area is (4 + (5√2)/2)/2 =2 + (5√2)/4≈2 +1.767≈3.767.

Alternatively, my initial coordinate step-by-step was wrong because I thought A8 was (0,0), but actually, when I added v8, which is (√2/2, -√2/2), to A7 which was (-√2/2, √2/2), I got (0,0). So, A8 is indeed (0,0).

Wait, but according to the shoelace formula, the coordinates are:

A0: (0,0)

A1: (1,0)

A2: (1 + √2/2, √2/2)

A3: (1 + √2/2, √2/2 +1)

A4: (1,1 + √2)

A5: (0,1 + √2)

A6: (-√2/2,1 + √2/2)

A7: (-√2/2, √2/2)

A8: (0,0)

So, when I applied the shoelace formula, I got a sum of 4 + (5√2)/2, which is approximately 7.535, leading to an area of approximately 3.767. But in my initial calculation, I thought it was 2 + 2√2≈4.828.

Wait, that means I must have made a mistake in the shoelace computation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the terms.

Wait, let me recast the entire shoelace calculation, more carefully.

Compute x_i y_{i+1} for each i:

i=0: x0=0, y1=0: 0*0=0

i=1: x1=1, y2=√2/2:1*√2/2=√2/2

i=2: x2=1 + √2/2, y3=√2/2 +1: (1 + √2/2)(√2/2 +1)

Let me compute this:

(1)(√2/2) +1*1 + (√2/2)(√2/2) + (√2/2)(1)

= √2/2 +1 + (2)/4 + √2/2

= √2/2 +1 + 0.5 + √2/2

=1 + √2 +0.5 =1.5 + √2

i=3: x3=1 + √2/2, y4=1 + √2: (1 + √2/2)(1 + √2)

=1*(1) +1*√2 + (√2/2)*1 + (√2/2)(√2)

=1 + √2 + √2/2 + (2)/2

=1 + √2 + √2/2 +1

=2 + (3√2)/2

i=4: x4=1, y5=1 + √2:1*(1 + √2)=1 + √2

i=5: x5=0, y6=1 + √2/2:0*(1 + √2/2)=0

i=6: x6=-√2/2, y7=√2/2: (-√2/2)(√2/2)= - (√2 * √2)/(2*2)= -2/4= -0.5

i=7: x7=-√2/2, y8=0: (-√2/2)*0=0

Now, sum these up:

i=0:0

i=1:√2/2≈0.707

i=2:1.5 +√2≈1.5 +1.414≈2.914

i=3:2 + (3√2)/2≈2 +2.121≈4.121

i=4:1 +√2≈1 +1.414≈2.414

i=5:0

i=6:-0.5

i=7:0

Adding them:

Start with 0.

+0.707:0.707

+2.914:3.621

+4.121:7.742

+2.414:10.156

+0:10.156

-0.5:9.656

+0:9.656

So, total sum≈9.656

Then, area is 1/2 * |9.656|≈4.828, which matches the previous result.

Wait, so earlier, when I thought the sum was 4 +4√2, that was wrong because I incorrectly associated the terms.

Wait, in my initial step-by-step, I had:

i=0:0

i=1:√2/2≈0.707

i=2:1 +√2/2≈1.707

i=3:1 +√2≈2.414

i=4:1 +√2≈2.414

i=5:√2/2 +1≈1.707

i=6:√2/2≈0.707

i=7:0

Adding these:

0.707 +1.707=2.414

2.414 +2.414=4.828

4.828 +1.707=6.535

6.535 +0.707≈7.242

Wait, that was wrong because I didn't include all terms.

Wait, no, in reality, the shoelace formula requires multiplying each x_i by the next y, so the terms are:

0, √2/2,1.5 +√2,2 + (3√2)/2,1 +√2,0, -0.5,0

So, adding them:

0 + √2/2 +1.5 +√2 +2 + (3√2)/2 +1 +√2 +0 -0.5 +0

Let me convert all to decimals for clarity:

√2 ≈1.414

√2/2≈0.707

(3√2)/2≈2.121

So,

0 +0.707 +1.5 +1.414 +2 +2.121 +1 +1.414 +0 -0.5 +0

Calculating step by step:

Start at 0.

+0.707≈0.707

+1.5≈2.207

+1.414≈3.621

+2≈5.621

+2.121≈7.742

+1≈8.742

+1.414≈10.156

-0.5≈9.656

So, total≈9.656

Thus, area≈1/2*9.656≈4.828

So, approximately 4.828, which is 2 +2√2≈2 +2.828≈4.828. So, correct.

So, initially, I had a miscalculation in the shoelace formula when I was adding the terms incorrectly. The correct sum is 9.656, leading to area≈4.828, which is 2 +2√2.

Therefore, the area of the octagon is 2 +2√2.

So, that's my conclusion.

**Final Answer**
The area of the octagon is \boxed{2 + 2\sqrt{2}}.
</think>

To find the area of an equiangular octagon with four sides of length \(1\) and four sides of length \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), we start by noting that the internal angles are all \(135^\circ\) and the sides alternate between \(1\) and \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\). 

We place the octagon on a coordinate system starting from \(A_0(0,0)\) and follow the directions of the sides. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Determine the direction vectors for each side:**
   - The directions alternate between \(0^\circ\), \(45^\circ\), \(90^\circ\), \(135^\circ\), etc., with each vector rotated \(45^\circ\) from the previous one.

2. **Calculate the coordinates of each vertex:**
   - Using the direction vectors and side lengths, we compute the coordinates of each vertex step by step:
     - \(A_0(0,0)\)
     - \(A_1(1,0)\)
     - \(A_2(1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\)
     - \(A_3(1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + 1)\)
     - \(A_4(1, 1 + \sqrt{2})\)
     - \(A_5(0, 1 + \sqrt{2})\)
     - \(A_6(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\)
     - \(A_7(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\)
     - \(A_8(0,0)\)

3. **Apply the shoelace formula to find the area:**
   - Using the coordinates of the vertices, we apply the shoelace formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=0}^{7} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) \right|
     \]
   - Calculating each term and summing them up, we find the total sum to be approximately \(9.656\).

4. **Compute the area:**
   - The area is half of the absolute value of this sum:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.656 = 4.828
     \]
   - Recognizing that this value is approximately \(2 + 2\sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the area of the octagon is \(\boxed{2 + 2\sqrt{2}}\).
