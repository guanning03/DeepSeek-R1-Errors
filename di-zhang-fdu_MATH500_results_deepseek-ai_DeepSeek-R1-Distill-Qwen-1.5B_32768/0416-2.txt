Question:
What is the smallest number which is one less than twice its reciprocal?

Correct Answer:
The question is asking us to find the smallest value of $x$ such that $x = 2\cdot\frac{1}{x} - 1$. We multiply through by $x$ to clear the fraction, then rearrange terms: $x^2 + x - 2 = 0$. This can be factored as $(x + 2)(x - 1) = 0$. We could also use the quadratic formula to find $x$: $$x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-2)}}{2}.$$ Either way, we find that $x = 1$ or $x = -2$. Since we want the smallest value of $x$, our answer is $\boxed{-2}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: "What is the smallest number which is one less than twice its reciprocal?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I need to translate the words into a mathematical equation. The problem is asking for a number that is one less than twice its reciprocal. Let's break that down. 

Let me denote the number as \( x \). The reciprocal of \( x \) would be \( \frac{1}{x} \). Now, twice its reciprocal would be \( 2 \times \frac{1}{x} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{2}{x} \). 

The problem says this reciprocal is one less than the number itself. So, the number \( x \) is equal to \( \frac{2}{x} - 1 \). Putting it all together, the equation is:

\[ x = \frac{2}{x} - 1 \]

Alright, now I have an equation with \( x \) in both the numerator and the denominator. I need to solve for \( x \) to find the number. Let's try to rearrange this equation.

First, I can multiply both sides by \( x \) to eliminate the fraction. That way, I can get rid of the denominator and make the equation easier to handle. 

Multiplying both sides by \( x \):

\[ x \times x = x \times \left( \frac{2}{x} - 1 \right) \]

Simplifying both sides:

Left side: \( x^2 \)

Right side: \( x \times \frac{2}{x} - x \times 1 = 2 - x \)

So, now the equation is:

\[ x^2 = 2 - x \]

Hmm, let me rearrange this so that all the terms are on one side, making it a standard quadratic equation. I can bring \( x \) to the left side by adding \( x \) to both sides:

\[ x^2 + x = 2 \]

Subtracting 2 from both sides to set the equation to zero:

\[ x^2 + x - 2 = 0 \]

Alright, now we have a quadratic equation in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). To solve for \( x \), I can use the quadratic formula, factoring, or completing the square. Let me see if this quadratic factors easily.

Looking at the coefficients: 1, 1, -2. I need two numbers that multiply to -2 and add up to 1. Hmm, factors of -2 are (-1 and 2), because (-1) * 2 = -2 and (-1) + 2 = 1. Perfect!

So, factoring the quadratic:

\[ (x - 1)(x + 2) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives me the possible solutions:

1. \( x - 1 = 0 \) => \( x = 1 \)
2. \( x + 2 = 0 \) => \( x = -2 \)

So, the solutions are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2 \). 

Now, the problem asks for the smallest number. Let's compare these two. 1 is smaller than -2, so 1 is the smaller number.

Wait a second, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me plug both solutions back into the original equation to verify.

First, checking \( x = 1 \):

Left side: \( x = 1 \)
Right side: \( \frac{2}{x} - 1 = \frac{2}{1} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
So, both sides are equal. That checks out.

Now, checking \( x = -2 \):

Left side: \( x = -2 \)
Right side: \( \frac{2}{x} - 1 = \frac{2}{-2} - 1 = -1 - 1 = -2 \)
Again, both sides are equal. That also checks out.

So both solutions are valid. But since we're looking for the smallest number, 1 is smaller than -2, so 1 is the answer.

But just to be thorough, let me visualize the problem. Imagine a number line. The solution \( x = 1 \) is to the right of 0, while \( x = -2 \) is to the left. Since 1 is closer to 0, it's considered smaller. 

Also, considering the original problem: "one less than twice its reciprocal." If we take \( x = 1 \), twice its reciprocal is 2*(1) = 2, and one less than that is 1, which is consistent. For \( x = -2 \), twice its reciprocal is 2*( -1/2 ) = -1, and one less than that is -2, which also matches.

Therefore, both numbers satisfy the equation, but 1 is the smaller one.

Just to ensure that there are no other solutions, let me consider the steps again. Starting from the equation \( x = \frac{2}{x} - 1 \), we multiplied both sides by \( x \) to get rid of the denominator, which is a standard method. Then, we moved all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation, which I successfully factored.

Quadratic equations generally have two solutions, unless there's a repeated root or no real roots. In this case, we definitely have two real solutions, so we can't have missed anything.

So, to recap:

1. Translated the problem into the equation \( x = \frac{2}{x} - 1 \).
2. Multiplied both sides by \( x \) to eliminate the denominator: \( x^2 = 2 - x \).
3. Rearranged to form a quadratic equation: \( x^2 + x - 2 = 0 \).
4. Factored the quadratic: \( (x - 1)(x + 2) = 0 \).
5. Found the solutions \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2 \).
6. Verified both solutions by plugging them back into the original equation.
7. Determined that 1 is the smallest number.

Therefore, after carefully going through the problem step by step and verifying each part, I'm confident that the smallest number satisfying the condition is 1.

**Final Answer**
The smallest number is \boxed{1}.
</think>

Let \( x \) be the number we are looking for. The problem states that this number is one less than twice its reciprocal. We can translate this into the equation:

\[ x = \frac{2}{x} - 1 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by \( x \):

\[ x \cdot x = x \left( \frac{2}{x} - 1 \right) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x^2 = 2 - x \]

Next, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[ x^2 + x - 2 = 0 \]

We factor the quadratic equation:

\[ (x - 1)(x + 2) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:

1. \( x - 1 = 0 \) implies \( x = 1 \)
2. \( x + 2 = 0 \) implies \( x = -2 \)

We verify both solutions by substituting them back into the original equation and find that both are valid. Since we are looking for the smallest number, 1 is smaller than -2.

Thus, the smallest number is \boxed{1}.
