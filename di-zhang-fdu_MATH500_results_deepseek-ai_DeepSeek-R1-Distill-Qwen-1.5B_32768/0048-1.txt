Correct Answer:
Triangle $AFD$ must have a total angle measure of $180^\circ$. We know that the other two angles have measures of $2x$ and $2y$, so angle $AFD$ must have a measure of $180-2x-2y=180-(2x+2y)$ degrees. We now look at quadrilateral $ABCD$, whose interior angle measures must sum to $360^\circ$. Therefore, we have that $110^\circ +100^\circ +3y+3x=360^\circ$, so $3x+3y=150^\circ$. We want to find $2x+2y$, so we multiply both sides of the equation by $2/3$ to get that $2x+2y=100^\circ$. We can now substitute in $100^\circ$ for $2x+2y$ to find that the measure of angle $AFD$ is $180-(2x+2y)=180-100=\boxed{80}$ degrees.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I need to figure out the degree measure of angle AFD in quadrilateral ABCD. The problem mentions that angles BAD and CDA are trisected, and there are some labels with angles x and y. Also, there are some given angles of 110 degrees and 100 degrees labeled on the figure.

First, let me try to visualize the Asymptote code provided. It defines points A, B, C, D with coordinates A at (0,0), B at (2,4), C at (7,4), and D at (7,-2). So, quadrilateral ABCD has points A at the origin, B somewhere in the first quadrant, C further right on the x-axis, and D below C on the vertical line x=7.

Drawing A to B, then B to C, then C to D, and D back to A. So the quadrilateral is a trapezoid? Wait, actually, AB is from (0,0) to (2,4), BC is from (2,4) to (7,4), CD is from (7,4) to (7,-2), and DA is from (7,-2) back to (0,0). So, the sides AB and CD are not parallel, but BC and DA are horizontal lines? Wait, BC is horizontal from (2,4) to (7,4), and DA is from (7,-2) to (0,0), which is a diagonal.

So, quadrilateral ABCD is a trapezoid? No, because only BC is horizontal, and DA is not. So, it's a general quadrilateral.

In the Asymptote code, points E and F are marked with labels. E is at (4.5 - 0.2, 1 - 0.2), which is roughly (4.3, 0.8), so near the midpoint of A(0,0) to B(2,4). F is at (5, 3), which is somewhere in the middle of the quadrilateral.

The figure has some angles labeled: x, x, x near the bottom and some other angles labeled y near the top. Also, two given angles: 110 degrees at (2.5, 3.5) and 100 degrees at (6.5 - 0.2, 3.5). So, these are probably angles at points E and F.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, labels for x and y are placed near the sides, but the actual points E and F are drawn. So, E is connected to A and D, and F is connected to A and D as well. So, lines AE and AD, AF and AD. So, points E and F are on sides AB and AD, respectively?

Wait, no, the Asymptote code draws A--E--D and A--F--D. So, E is on AB, and F is on AD.

Wait, E is at (4.5 - 0.2, 1 - 0.2), so x is about 4.3, y is about 0.8. So, E is somewhere along AB, closer to B. Similarly, F is at (5,3), which is somewhere in the middle.

So, lines AE and AF are drawn, and they intersect the sides BD and CD? Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, it draws A--E--D and A--F--D, so E is on AB, F is on AD, and they connect to D.

So, angle AFD is the angle at point F between lines AF and FD. So, I need to find the measure of that angle.

Given that angles BAD and CDA are trisected, so angle BAD is split into three equal angles by lines AE and AF, and similarly, angle CDA is split into three equal angles by lines, perhaps, from D? Wait, no. The Asymptote code only trisects angle BAD and angle CDA, but it doesn't specify where the trisection lines are drawn from.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, it draws A--E--D and A--F--D, so E is on AB, F is on AD. So, the trisection of angle BAD is done by drawing lines from A to E and A to F. Similarly, the trisection of angle CDA is done by drawing lines from D to E and D to F? Wait, no. Wait, AF is drawn from A to F, which is on AD, so AF is just a line from A to F on AD. Similarly, AE is from A to E on AB.

Wait, perhaps the trisection is done on angle BAD by drawing lines from A, and on angle ADC by drawing lines from D? Hmm, that might not make sense because the Asymptote code only draws A--E--D and A--F--D, so lines from A to E and A to F.

Wait, perhaps angle BAD is trisected, so angles BAD is divided into three equal parts, each of measure x, so angle BAD = 3x. Similarly, angle CDA is trisected, so angle CDA is divided into three equal parts, each of measure y, so angle CDA = 3y.

Given that, the Asymptote code has x's labeled near the bottom, so maybe x is the angle between BA and AE, and between AE and AF? Similarly, y's are labeled near the top, perhaps between AF and AD, or something like that.

Wait, let me try to parse the Asymptote code.

The Asymptote code labels x and y near the bottom and top. The code says:

label("$x$", (1, 1.5), S); label("$x$", (2, 1), S+W); label("$x$", (2, -1), N+N+N+W);

So, three x's, each labeled near the sides. Similarly, labels for y are:

label("$y$", (5.5+.3, .5-.3), S); label("$y$", (6.5+.3, 0)); label("$y$", (5+.5, -1.5+.3));

So, three y's as well, one near the middle, one at the top, and one near the bottom.

Then, the given angles are 110 degrees at (2.5, 3.5) and 100 degrees at (6.5 - 0.2, 3.5). So, 110 degrees is near point B, and 100 degrees is near point C.

Wait, maybe these angles are the angles at points E and F, which are the intersection points of the trisectors. So, perhaps angle AED is 110 degrees, and angle AFD is 100 degrees.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing A--E--D and A--F--D, so E is on AB, F is on AD, so lines AE and AF are drawn. So, angle AED is at E, between AE and ED, and angle AFD is at F, between AF and FD.

Given that, the angles labeled 110 and 100 are likely angles AED and AFD, which are at points E and F, respectively.

So, perhaps angle AED is 110 degrees, and angle AFD is 100 degrees, but we need to verify that.

Alternatively, maybe the angles are the angles between the trisection lines.

Wait, the Asymptote code says "trisected as shown," so the trisection lines are drawn such that angles BAD and CDA are each trisected into three equal parts. So, angle BAD is 3x, angle CDA is 3y, and these are each trisected into x and y.

Given that, the figure is drawn with the trisection lines, and labels for x and y are placed near the sides, and the given angles are 110 and 100.

Given that, I think the 110 degrees is at point E, which is on AB, between E and D, and the 100 degrees is at point F, which is on AD, between F and D.

So, the angles at E and F are 110 and 100 degrees, respectively. So, angle AED = 110 degrees, angle AFD = 100 degrees, which are the angles we need to find.

Wait, but the question is asking for the measure of angle AFD. So, is it 100 degrees? But I think we need to verify.

Alternatively, perhaps angle AFD is formed by the trisection lines, so maybe it's 1/3 of angle CDA?

Wait, let me try to think step by step.

First, quadrilateral ABCD. We have points A, B, C, D with coordinates given. So, if I can calculate the coordinates, perhaps I can compute the angles.

But maybe it's better to think about the angles at A and D.

Given that angles BAD and CDA are trisected, so each trisected angle is angle BAD = 3x, angle CDA = 3y.

Given that, and the given angles of 110 and 100 degrees, which are labeled near the sides, perhaps 110 degrees is the angle between BA and AE, and 100 degrees is the angle between AF and AD.

Wait, but from the Asymptote code, the given angles are at (2.5, 3.5) and (6.5 - 0.2, 3.5). So, (2.5, 3.5) is above point B, which is at (2,4), and (6.5 - 0.2, 3.5) is near point C, which is at (7,4). So, these are points above B and C, but within the figure.

Wait, perhaps these are angles at points E and F, the intersection points of the trisection lines.

So, the Asymptote code draws A--E--D and A--F--D, so E is on AB and F is on AD.

So, angle AED is at E, between AE and ED, and angle AFD is at F, between AF and FD.

Given that, 110 degrees is at E and 100 degrees is at F.

So, we need to find the measure of angle AFD, which is at F between AF and FD.

So, perhaps angle AFD is 100 degrees, but let's verify.

Alternatively, maybe angle AFD is part of a triangle.

Wait, let me think about triangle AFD. If I can find some information about triangle AFD, perhaps using the Law of Sines or something.

But for that, I need more information about the sides or angles.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the angles are trisected.

Given that, angle BAD is trisected into three equal angles, each of measure x, so angle BAD = 3x. Similarly, angle CDA is trisected into three equal angles, each of measure y, so angle CDA = 3y.

Given that, perhaps we can find angles at A and D, and then find the rest of the angles.

Wait, in quadrilateral ABCD, the sum of internal angles is (4-2)*180 = 360 degrees. So, angle BAD + angle ABC + angle CDA + angle ADC = 360.

Wait, no, angle at A is angle BAD, angle at B is angle ABC, angle at C is angle BCD, and angle at D is angle CDA.

Wait, so we have angle BAD = 3x, angle CDA = 3y, angle ABC and angle BCD are unknown.

But in the Asymptote code, angle BAD is at point A, between BA and DA. Similarly, angle CDA is at point D, between CD and DA.

Given that, angle BAD is 3x, angle CDA is 3y, angle AED is 110 degrees, and angle AFD is 100 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the angles at E and F are 110 and 100 degrees, which are angles between the trisection lines.

So, angle AED is 110 degrees, which is at point E, between AE and ED.

Similarly, angle AFD is 100 degrees, which is at point F, between AF and FD.

So, perhaps using triangle AED, we can find some angles.

Wait, triangle AED has angle at E of 110 degrees, sides AE, ED, and AD.

Similarly, triangle AFD has angle at F of 100 degrees, sides AF, FD, and AD.

Wait, but without knowing the lengths, it's hard to calculate.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider the trisection of angles BAD and CDA.

So, angle BAD = 3x, and angle CDA = 3y.

If we can find the values of x and y, then we can find the measures of the angles at A and D.

But how?

Wait, in the Asymptote code, the angles x and y are labeled near the sides, so perhaps at the sides AB and AD, near the trisection points.

Wait, perhaps the angles x and y are the angles between the trisection lines and the sides.

So, if angle BAD is trisected into three angles of x each, then angle BAD = 3x.

Similarly, angle CDA is trisected into three angles of y each, so angle CDA = 3y.

Given that, and the given angles of 110 and 100 degrees, which are labeled at the top and bottom of the figure, perhaps these are the angles at points E and F, which are the intersections of the trisection lines.

Wait, let me think about triangle AED. At point E, the angle is 110 degrees. In triangle AED, the other angles would be at A and D.

Wait, angle at A is angle EAD, which is part of angle BAD, which is 3x. Similarly, angle at D is angle ED A, which is part of angle CDA, which is 3y.

So, in triangle AED, we have angle AED = 110 degrees, angle EAD = x (since it's the first trisection), and angle EDA = y (since it's the first trisection).

Therefore, in triangle AED, angles at A and D are x and y, respectively, and angle at E is 110 degrees.

So, the sum of angles in triangle AED is 180, so:

x + y + 110 = 180

Therefore, x + y = 70 degrees.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100 degrees, at point F, which is on AD.

Wait, no, point F is on AD, so in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100 degrees.

But in triangle AFD, the angles at A and D would be?

Wait, in triangle AFD, angle at A is angle FAD, which is part of angle BAD, which is 3x, and angle at D is angle FDA, which is part of angle CDA, which is 3y.

But wait, triangle AFD is formed by points A, F, D, so angle at A is angle FAD, angle at D is angle FDA, and angle at F is angle AFD = 100 degrees.

So, in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100 degrees, angle at A is x (since F is on AD, which is being trisected into x angles), and angle at D is y (since D is being trisected into y angles).

Therefore, in triangle AFD, angles are x, y, and 100 degrees.

So, x + y + 100 = 180

Thus, x + y = 80 degrees.

Wait, but earlier, from triangle AED, we had x + y = 70 degrees.

But now, from triangle AFD, x + y = 80 degrees.

This is a contradiction. So, that suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the angles x and y are at different points. Maybe x is at point B and y is at point C?

Wait, in the Asymptote code, the labels for x and y are on the sides, so near the bottom and top.

Wait, perhaps the angles x and y are the angles between the trisection lines and the sides.

Wait, maybe angle BAD is split into three angles, each of x, so angle BAD = 3x.

Similarly, angle CDA is split into three angles, each of y, so angle CDA = 3y.

Given that, in triangle AED, angle at E is 110 degrees, which is the angle between AE and ED.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100 degrees, which is the angle between AF and FD.

But in triangle AED, angles at A and D are x and y, so x + y = 180 - 110 = 70.

In triangle AFD, angles at A and D are x and y, so x + y = 180 - 100 = 80.

This is a contradiction, which means my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the angles x and y are not the angles at points A and D in the triangles, but the angles at points B and C?

Wait, in the Asymptote code, the labels x and y are placed near the sides, so near point B and C, but perhaps it's at the base.

Wait, maybe angle x is at point B and angle y is at point C.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, the label for x is at (1,1.5), which is near the base on the left side, and y labels are near the base on the right side. So, maybe angle x is at point B, and angle y is at point C.

Similarly, the labels for y are at (5.5+.3, .5-.3) which is near the top, and (6.5+.3, 0), which is near the bottom on the right side.

Wait, perhaps angle x is at point B, and angle y is at point C.

So, angle ABC is split into three angles, each of x, so angle ABC = 3x.

Similarly, angle BCD is split into three angles, each of y, so angle BCD = 3y.

Given that, in triangle ABD, which is triangle ABD, angle at B is 3x, angle at D is 3y, and angle at A is something else.

Wait, no, actually, angle ABC is 3x, and angle BCD is 3y.

Wait, quadrilateral ABCD, so sum of angles is 360.

So, angle at A + angle at B + angle at C + angle at D = 360.

But angle at A is angle BAD = 3x, angle at B is angle ABC = 3x, angle at C is angle BCD = 3y, and angle at D is angle CDA = 3y.

Wait, that can't be, because angle at A and angle at B are both 3x, which would make angle BAD and angle ABC both 3x, which is not necessarily wrong, but in quadrilateral ABCD, the sum would be 3x + 3x + 3y + 3y = 6x + 6y = 360, so x + y = 30.

But that's a different result.

Wait, perhaps angle at A is angle BAD = 3x, angle at B is angle ABC = 3x, angle at C is angle BCD = 3y, angle at D is angle CDA = 3y.

But in that case, 3x + 3x + 3y + 3y = 6x + 6y = 360, so x + y = 30.

But in the Asymptote code, angles x and y are labeled at different sides, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps angle x is at point B and angle y is at point C, but not necessarily the angles of the triangles.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Law of Sines in triangles AED and AFD.

Given that, in triangle AED, angle at E is 110 degrees, angle at A is x, and angle at D is y.

So, by Law of Sines, AE / sin(y) = ED / sin(x) = AD / sin(110).

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100 degrees, angle at A is x, angle at D is y.

So, AF / sin(y) = FD / sin(x) = AD / sin(100).

So, from triangle AED: AE = AD * sin(y) / sin(110)

From triangle AFD: AF = AD * sin(y) / sin(100)

Therefore, AF / AE = [AD * sin(y) / sin(100)] / [AD * sin(y) / sin(110)] = sin(110) / sin(100)

So, AF / AE = sin(110)/sin(100)

But from the Asymptote code, AF and AE are trisectors.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, E is on AB, F is on AD, so AE and AF are trisectors.

Thus, in triangle ABD, with angle BAD = 3x, and trisectors AE and AF.

Wait, no, actually, point E is on AB, so AE is a segment from A to E on AB, so AE is a trisection segment.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of AE to EB is 1:2, since it's a trisection.

Similarly, AF is a trisection on AD.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, E is at (4.3, 0.8), and F is at (5,3). So, if AB is from (0,0) to (2,4), which is a length of sqrt(20). So, E is closer to B.

Wait, maybe the ratio of AE to EB is 2:1, meaning AE is twice as long as EB.

Similarly, AF is somewhere on AD, but since AD is from (7,-2) to (0,0), which is length sqrt(7^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(53). So, AF is a trisection point.

So, if AF is a trisection point, then AF is 1/3 of AD, or 2/3.

But in the Asymptote code, AF is drawn from (5,3) to (0,0), so it's a line that goes from (5,3) to (0,0). So, the length from A to F is sqrt(5^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(34), and from F to D is sqrt((7-5)^2 + (-2 - 3)^2) = sqrt(4 + 25) = sqrt(29). So, the ratio AF:FD is sqrt(34):sqrt(29). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps since angle BAD is trisected, and the angle is 3x, then AE is the first trisection, so angle BAE = x, and angle EAD = x.

Similarly, AF is the second trisection, so angle FAD = x, and angle FAC = x.

Wait, that might not make sense.

Wait, if angle BAD is trisected, so angle BAE = angle EAD = angle FAD = x.

Similarly, angle CDA is trisected, so angle CDF = angle FDB = angle GDA = y.

Wait, maybe the points where the trisection lines meet the sides are at certain ratios.

Wait, since angle BAD is trisected, point E is on AB such that angle BAE = angle EAD = x.

Similarly, point F is on AD such that angle CAF = angle FAD = x.

Wait, no, that might not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the trisection lines are drawn from A to E and A to F, dividing angle BAD and angle CDA into three equal angles.

So, angle BAD is split into three angles of x each, so angle BAE = x, angle EAD = x.

Similarly, angle CDA is split into three angles of y each, so angle CAF = y, angle FAD = y.

Wait, so maybe AF is a trisection line from A to F on AD, dividing angle CDA into y and 2y.

Similarly, AE is a trisection line from A to E on AB, dividing angle BAD into x and 2x.

But in the Asymptote code, AF is drawn from A to F on AD, so if angle CDA is 3y, then angle FAD = y.

Similarly, angle BAD is 3x, so angle BAE = x, angle EAD = x.

So, in triangle AED, angle at A is x, angle at D is y, angle at E is 110 degrees.

Therefore, x + y = 70 degrees.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at A is x, angle at D is y, angle at F is 100 degrees.

Therefore, x + y = 80 degrees.

Wait, but x + y cannot be both 70 and 80. That's a contradiction.

Therefore, my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the angles at E and F are not angles in the triangles AED and AFD, but angles at E and F in the quadrilateral.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, E and F are on AB and AD, so E is on AB and F is on AD, so in the quadrilateral, the lines AE and AF are drawn, so point E is on AB and point F is on AD.

So, in the quadrilateral ABCD, the lines AE and AF are drawn from A, so AE is a trisection line from A, dividing angle BAD into three angles of x each.

Similarly, AF is another trisection line from A, dividing angle CDA into three angles of y each.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, only two trisection lines are drawn, from A to E and A to F.

So, with this, perhaps the angles at E and F are 110 and 100 degrees.

Wait, angle at E is 110 degrees, which is between AE and ED, and angle at F is 100 degrees, which is between AF and FD.

So, in triangle AED, angle at E is 110 degrees, angle at A is x, angle at D is y.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100 degrees, angle at A is x, angle at D is y.

Therefore, in triangle AED: x + y + 110 = 180 => x + y = 70.

In triangle AFD: x + y + 100 = 180 => x + y = 80.

Which is a problem because x + y cannot be both 70 and 80.

Therefore, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps angle AED is not in triangle AED, but in triangle AEB or something else.

Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, E is on AB, so triangle AED is formed by points A, E, D.

Wait, perhaps the angles at E and F are not in the triangles AED and AFD, but in other triangles.

Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, lines are drawn from A to E and A to F, so triangles AED and AFD are formed.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the angles at E and F in the quadrilateral.

Wait, angle AED is 110 degrees, which is at point E, between AE and ED.

Similarly, angle AFD is 100 degrees, which is at point F, between AF and FD.

So, in the quadrilateral, we have two angles at E and F, which are 110 and 100 degrees.

But in triangles AED and AFD, angles at E and F are 110 and 100 degrees, respectively.

So, in triangle AED, angles at A, E, D are x, 110, y.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angles at A, F, D are x, 100, y.

Wait, so in triangle AED: x + y + 110 = 180 => x + y = 70.

In triangle AFD: x + y + 100 = 180 => x + y = 80.

Again, contradiction.

Hmm, so perhaps the angles at E and F are not in the triangles AED and AFD, but in other triangles.

Wait, maybe the angles are in triangles AEB and AFD.

Wait, but point E is on AB, so triangle AEB is part of the quadrilateral.

Wait, angle at E is 110 degrees, which is between AE and ED.

So, in triangle AED, angle at E is 110 degrees.

Similarly, angle at F is 100 degrees, between AF and FD.

In triangle AFD, angle at F is 100 degrees.

So, given that, perhaps the Law of Sines can be applied.

In triangle AED: AE / sin(y) = ED / sin(x) = AD / sin(110)

Similarly, in triangle AFD: AF / sin(y) = FD / sin(x) = AD / sin(100)

Therefore, from triangle AED: AE = AD * sin(y) / sin(110)

From triangle AFD: AF = AD * sin(y) / sin(100)

Therefore, AF / AE = [AD * sin(y) / sin(100)] / [AD * sin(y) / sin(110)] = sin(110) / sin(100)

So, AF / AE = sin(110)/sin(100)

But from the Asymptote code, AF and AE are the lengths from A to F and A to E, so their ratio can be found.

Given the coordinates:

Point A is at (0,0), E is at (4.3, 0.8), and F is at (5, 3).

So, AE is the distance from (0,0) to (4.3, 0.8):

AE = sqrt(4.3^2 + 0.8^2) ≈ sqrt(18.49 + 0.64) ≈ sqrt(19.13) ≈ 4.374

Similarly, AF is the distance from (0,0) to (5,3):

AF = sqrt(5^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(25 + 9) = sqrt(34) ≈ 5.830

So, AF / AE ≈ 5.830 / 4.374 ≈ 1.333

Similarly, sin(110)/sin(100):

sin(110) ≈ sin(70) ≈ 0.9397

sin(100) ≈ sin(80) ≈ 0.9848

Therefore, sin(110)/sin(100) ≈ 0.9397 / 0.9848 ≈ 0.954

But AF / AE ≈ 1.333, which is not equal to 0.954. So, this is inconsistent.

Therefore, my previous conclusion that AF / AE = sin(110)/sin(100) is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the triangles AED and AFD are not similar or something.

Wait, actually, maybe the Law of Sines is not directly applicable here because the triangles are not necessarily similar.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the Law of Sines in triangles AEB and AFD.

Wait, point E is on AB, so triangle AEB is part of the quadrilateral.

Similarly, point F is on AD, so triangle AFD is part of the quadrilateral.

Wait, but from the Asymptote code, AF and AE are lines from A to E and F, so maybe the triangles AEB and AFD are different.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the angles at E and F in the quadrilateral.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, angle AED is 110 degrees, which is at point E, and angle AFD is 100 degrees, at point F.

So, in the quadrilateral, we have two angles at E and F, 110 and 100 degrees, and need to find angle AFD.

Wait, but angle AFD is already given as 100 degrees, so maybe that's the answer.

But that can't be, because the question is asking for the degree measure of angle AFD, which is at point F.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, angle AFD is labeled near point F, which is on AD.

Wait, perhaps the angle AFD is the angle between AF and FD, which is at point F, so that angle is 100 degrees, as labeled.

Therefore, is the answer 100 degrees?

But that seems too straightforward, and I might be missing something.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the labels are placed near the sides, but the given angles are 110 and 100, which are at different positions.

Wait, perhaps angle AFD is the angle at F between AF and FD, which is 100 degrees, as labeled.

But then, the problem is asking for the degree measure of angle AFD, which is 100 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, the angle at F is labeled near point (5.5 - 0.2, 0), which is on the right side, but in the figure, point F is on AD, which is the right side.

Wait, perhaps the angle at F is 100 degrees, as labeled.

Therefore, perhaps the answer is 100 degrees.

But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach.

Wait, another thought: Since angles BAD and CDA are trisected, and angle BAD is 3x, angle CDA is 3y.

We can find x and y using the given angles at E and F.

Given that, in triangle AED, angle at E is 110 degrees, which is angle between AE and ED.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100 degrees.

So, in triangle AED, angle at E is 110 degrees, angle at A is x, angle at D is y.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100 degrees, angle at A is x, angle at D is y.

But from triangle AED: x + y + 110 = 180 => x + y = 70.

From triangle AFD: x + y + 100 = 180 => x + y = 80.

Which is a problem, as x + y cannot be both 70 and 80.

Wait, unless I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps in triangle AED, the angles are not x, y, 110.

Wait, perhaps angle at A is not x, but another angle.

Wait, if angle BAD is trisected, then angle BAE = angle EAD = x, so angle EAD = x, which is part of triangle AED.

Similarly, angle CDA is trisected, so angle CDF = angle FAD = y.

Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, AF is a trisection line from A to F on AD, so angle FAD is y.

Wait, in triangle AED, angle at A is x, angle at D is y, angle at E is 110.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at A is x, angle at D is y, angle at F is 100.

Therefore, x + y = 70 and x + y = 80, which is impossible.

Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the given angles at E and F are not in triangles AED and AFD.

Wait, perhaps they are in triangles AEB and AFD.

Wait, in triangle AEB, angle at E is 110 degrees.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100 degrees.

Wait, but in triangle AEB, the angles would be at A, E, and B.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, the angles would be at A, F, and D.

So, if angle AEB is 110 degrees, then in triangle AEB, angle at E is 110, angle at A is something, angle at B is something.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100, angle at A is something, angle at D is something.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the angle AED is 110, which is in triangle AED, not AEB.

Similarly, angle AFD is 100, in triangle AFD.

Therefore, perhaps the given angles are in triangles AED and AFD.

Wait, but as we saw, x + y = 70 and x + y = 80, which is impossible.

Therefore, maybe the angles at E and F are not in the triangles AED and AFD, but in other triangles.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles at E and F are external angles.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, the angle at E is 110 degrees, which is at point E on AB.

So, in triangle AED, angle at E is 110 degrees.

Similarly, angle at F is 100 degrees, at point F on AD.

But in triangle AED, angle at E is 110, and in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100.

But unless the triangles are not AED and AFD, but some other triangles.

Wait, perhaps the angle at E is part of triangle AEB, and the angle at F is part of triangle AFD.

Wait, angle AEB is 110 degrees.

Similarly, angle AFD is 100 degrees.

But how does that help?

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Law of Sines in the entire quadrilateral.

Wait, but I need more information.

Wait, given that, maybe the problem is more about the external angles.

Wait, perhaps the angles at E and F are external angles to the trisection lines.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of angles in the quadrilateral is 360.

But without knowing all the angles, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the trisection lines divide the angles into three equal parts, and use the angle bisector theorem or something.

Wait, but the problem says "trisected as shown," so perhaps the lines are trisectors.

Wait, let's think about point E: it's on AB, and AE is a trisection line from A, so angle BAE is x.

Similarly, angle EAD is x.

Similarly, point F is on AD, and AF is another trisection line from A, so angle FAD is y.

So, in triangle AED, angle at A is x, angle at D is y, angle at E is 110.

So, x + y = 70.

In triangle AFD, angle at A is x, angle at D is y, angle at F is 100.

So, x + y = 80.

But, again, x + y cannot be both 70 and 80.

Therefore, perhaps the problem is that I'm misapplying the angles.

Wait, perhaps angle AED is not in triangle AED, but in another triangle.

Wait, maybe angle AED is in triangle AEB?

Wait, no, because E is on AB.

Wait, perhaps angle AED is in triangle AEB.

Wait, but E is on AB, so AEB is part of the quadrilateral.

Wait, maybe the angle at E is in triangle AEB.

Wait, in triangle AEB, angle at E is 110 degrees.

So, angle AEB = 110 degrees.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100 degrees.

So, in triangle AEB, angle at E is 110 degrees, angle at A is something, angle at B is something.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100 degrees, angle at A is something, angle at D is something.

But I don't know enough about triangle AEB or AFD.

Wait, perhaps using the Law of Sines in triangle AEB.

In triangle AEB, angle at E is 110 degrees, angle at A is the same as angle BAE, which is x.

Wait, no, in triangle AEB, angle at A is angle BAE, which is x.

Angle at E is 110 degrees.

Therefore, in triangle AEB, angles are x, 110, and angle at B.

So, angle at B is 180 - x - 110 = 70 - x.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100 degrees, angle at A is x, angle at D is y.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, angles are x, 100, y.

So, angle at D is y.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, angle at D is y, which is part of angle ADC in the quadrilateral.

Similarly, in triangle AEB, angle at B is 70 - x.

But in the quadrilateral, angle at B is 3x, as it's trisected into three angles of x each.

Wait, so angle at B is 3x, but from triangle AEB, angle at B is 70 - x.

Therefore, 3x = 70 - x.

Therefore, 3x + x = 70

4x = 70

x = 17.5 degrees.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angles at A is x, at F is 100, at D is y.

So, in triangle AFD, sum of angles is x + 100 + y = 180

So, y = 80 - x = 80 - 17.5 = 62.5 degrees.

Therefore, in triangle AEB, angle at E is 110 degrees, angle at A is x = 17.5, angle at B is 70 - x = 52.5 degrees.

Now, in triangle AED, angles at E is 110, at A is x = 17.5, at D is y = 62.5.

So, x + y = 17.5 + 62.5 = 80, but in triangle AED, angle at E is 110, so sum would be 17.5 + 62.5 + 110 = 190, which is more than 180, which is impossible.

Wait, so that can't be.

Wait, so in triangle AED, angles should add up to 180, but 17.5 + 62.5 + 110 = 190, which is too much.

Therefore, something is wrong.

Wait, maybe my assumption is wrong.

Wait, if angle AEB is 110, then in triangle AEB, angle at E is 110, angle at A is x, angle at B is 70 - x.

Similarly, in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100, angle at A is x, angle at D is y.

But in quadrilateral ABCD, angle at B is 3x, which is equal to angle ABE + angle EBC, but in triangle AEB, angle at B is 70 - x.

Wait, so maybe 3x = 70 - x

So, 4x = 70

x = 17.5

So, angle BAD is 3x = 52.5 degrees.

Similarly, angle at D is 3y, since it's trisected into y each.

So, angle ADC is 3y, which is equal to angle ADF + angle FDC.

Wait, in triangle AFD, angle at D is y, which is part of angle ADC.

But angle ADC is 3y, so perhaps angle ADF is y, angle FDC is 2y.

Wait, if in triangle AFD, angle at D is y, then angle ADC is 3y.

But from triangle AED, angle at D is y, which is part of angle ADC.

So, in triangle AED, angle at D is y, which is the same as angle ADF in triangle AFD.

So, angle ADC is 3y.

But from triangle AFD, angle at D is y, which is part of angle ADC.

But in triangle AFD, angle at D is y, and angle at A is x = 17.5, angle at F is 100.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, angles: 17.5, 100, y, which add up to 180.

So, 17.5 + 100 + y = 180 => y = 62.5

Therefore, in quadrilateral ABCD, angle ADC is 3y = 3*62.5 = 187.5 degrees.

But that's impossible, as quadrilateral angles can't exceed 180.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, so perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps angle AFD is not in triangle AFD.

Wait, perhaps angle AFD is 100 degrees, as given.

Therefore, the answer is 100 degrees.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps angle AFD is equal to angle FAD, which is x.

But x is 17.5, so 17.5 degrees.

But the problem says angle AFD is labeled near point F, so it's probably the angle at F, which is 100 degrees.

Therefore, I'm torn between 100 and 17.5, but considering the given angles, 100 seems more plausible.

Wait, but in triangle AFD, angle at F is 100, as labeled.

So, angle AFD is 100 degrees.

Therefore, I think the answer is 100 degrees.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{100}
</think>

To determine the degree measure of angle \(AFD\), we start by analyzing the given quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The coordinates of the points are \(A(0,0)\), \(B(2,4)\), \(C(7,4)\), and \(D(7,-2)\). The angles \(\angle BAD\) and \(\angle CDA\) are trisected.

Given:
- Angle \(\angle BAD\) is trisected by lines \(AE\) and \(AF\), so each trisected angle is \(x\).
- Angle \(\angle CDA\) is trisected by lines \(DE\) and \(DF\), so each trisected angle is \(y\).
- The angle \(\angle AED\) is 110 degrees, and the angle \(\angle AFD\) is 100 degrees.

We need to find the measure of angle \(\angle AFD\).

First, we consider the angles at points \(E\) and \(F\). Since \(\angle AED\) is 110 degrees and \(\angle AFD\) is 100 degrees, we need to relate these angles to the trisection of the angles at \(A\) and \(D\).

We use the Law of Sines in triangles \(AED\) and \(AFD\). However, due to the complexity of the quadrilateral and the given angles, we simplify by noting that the angle \(\angle AFD\) is already given as 100 degrees.

Thus, the degree measure of angle \(AFD\) is \(\boxed{100}\).
