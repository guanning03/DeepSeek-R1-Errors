Question:
A figure skater is facing north when she begins to spin to her right. She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?

Correct Answer:
Each full circle is 360 degrees.  Dividing 360 into 2250 gives a quotient of 6 with a remainder of 90.  So, she spins 90 degrees to her right past north, which leaves her facing $\boxed{\text{east}}$.

Okay, so I have this problem about a figure skater spinning, and I need to figure out which direction she's facing after spinning 2250 degrees to the right. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that when someone spins, they're basically rotating their body around an axis, which in this case is probably their body's own axis. Since she's facing north initially, that's our starting point. Now, spinning to the rightâ€”wait, I need to clarify: does "spinning to the right" mean she's rotating clockwise or counterclockwise? I think in the context of movement, when someone says they're spinning to the right, it typically means a clockwise rotation. But sometimes, depending on the perspective, it might be the other way. Hmm, maybe I should confirm that. Let me think. If you're facing north and you spin to your right, you're rotating clockwise. Yeah, I think that's right. So, 2250 degrees of clockwise rotation.

Now, to figure out where she ends up, I need to figure out how many full rotations she makes and how much extra angle is left. Since a full rotation is 360 degrees, I can divide 2250 by 360 to see how many full turns she makes and what the remainder is.

Let me calculate that: 2250 divided by 360. Let's see, 360 goes into 2250 how many times? Well, 360 times 6 is 2160, and 2250 minus 2160 is 90. So 2250 is 6 full rotations (which bring her back to the starting position, facing north) plus an additional 90 degrees. So, she's spun 6 full circles, which doesn't change her direction, and then she spins an extra 90 degrees.

Wait, but spinning 90 degrees clockwise from north. Let me think about the directions. If she starts facing north, spinning 90 degrees clockwise would make her face east, right? Because clockwise from north is east. But hold on, 90 degrees is a quarter turn, so that's the first quadrant. So, yes, from north, 90 degrees clockwise is east. Wait, but is that correct? Let me visualize the compass directions.

North is at 0 degrees. If I spin 90 degrees clockwise, I'm facing east. 180 degrees clockwise from north is south. 270 degrees is west, and 360 degrees is back to north. So, 90 degrees is east, 180 south, 270 west, and 360 brings her back. So, 90 degrees clockwise from north is east. Therefore, after spinning 2250 degrees, which is 6 full turns plus 90 degrees, she ends up facing east.

But wait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Is 90 degrees clockwise from north east? Yes, because if you're facing north and turn right (clockwise), you face east. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, sometimes people get confused between clockwise and counterclockwise. Let me think. If she were spinning counterclockwise, starting from north, 90 degrees counterclockwise would bring her to west. But in this case, she's spinning to the right, which is clockwise, so east is the correct direction.

Wait, but another way to think about it is to note that each 90-degree turn is a direction change. So, starting at north, a 90-degree turn right would be east, another 90-degree turn right would be south, another 90 would be west, and another 90 would be back to north. So, 90 degrees is east, 180 is south, 270 is west, 360 is north. So, 90 degrees is indeed east.

Alternatively, to do this mathematically, I can think of the total rotation in terms of modulo 360. So, 2250 mod 360. Let me compute that.

360 times 6 is 2160, as I had earlier. 2250 minus 2160 is 90, so 2250 mod 360 is 90. So, she's effectively spun 90 degrees. Since it's a positive angle (counterclockwise), but wait, no, she is spinning clockwise, which is a negative angle in standard position. Hmm, does that matter?

Wait, actually, when we talk about angles in rotation, we usually consider counterclockwise as positive. But when someone says they're spinning to the right, which is clockwise, that might be considered as a negative angle. So, perhaps it's important to clarify whether the rotation is clockwise or counterclockwise.

But in this problem, it just says she spins 2250 degrees to the right. So perhaps we can take that at face value as a clockwise rotation, even if it's a large number. So, 90 degrees clockwise from north is east.

Alternatively, if I consider the rotation as a negative angle, -2250 degrees, then we can compute that modulo 360. But 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25, so 0.25 of a full rotation. 0.25 of 360 is 90 degrees. So, -90 degrees is equivalent to 270 degrees counterclockwise, which would bring her to west. Wait, that's different. So, which is it?

Hmm, I think the confusion arises because of the direction of rotation. If the skater is spinning to the right, which is clockwise, that's a positive rotation, but if we're measuring angles, we have to keep in mind the direction.

Wait, let's clarify. In mathematics, a positive angle is counterclockwise, negative is clockwise. So, if she's spinning to the right, that is a clockwise rotation, which would be a negative angle in standard terms. So, 2250 degrees clockwise is equivalent to -2250 degrees.

But since angles are periodic with 360 degrees, we can find the equivalent angle by modding out by 360. So, -2250 mod 360. Let's compute that.

First, 2250 divided by 360: 360*6=2160, 2250-2160=90. So 2250 is 90 degrees more than 6 full circles. So, -2250 degrees is equivalent to -90 degrees, which is the same as 270 degrees counterclockwise. So, 270 degrees counterclockwise from north is west.

Wait, so is it east or west? Hmm, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion.

Wait, so if I take 2250 degrees to the right, which is a clockwise rotation, that's 90 degrees, so east. But if I take 2250 degrees to the right, which is a clockwise rotation, but in terms of angle, it's negative. So, mod 360, it's -90, which is 270 counterclockwise, which is west.

But now I'm confused because depending on whether the rotation is considered as positive or negative, the result changes.

Wait, so perhaps I need to think of it as a positive rotation since she's spinning to the right, which is clockwise. So, 2250 degrees clockwise is 90 degrees, east.

But then why, when considering negative angles, it's 270 degrees counterclockwise, which is west.

So, which is it? Is the rotation considered as positive or negative?

Wait, perhaps the key is to note whether the rotation is clockwise or counterclockwise. The problem says she spins 2250 degrees to the right. So, that should mean a clockwise rotation, which is positive. Therefore, 2250 degrees clockwise is 90 degrees, which is east.

Alternatively, in the standard mathematical coordinate system, angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis (east), so clockwise would be a negative angle. So, if we take the rotation as positive (clockwise), 90 degrees is east. If it's negative, 270 counterclockwise is west.

So, which interpretation is correct?

I think in this context, since the skater is spinning to the right, it's a clockwise rotation, so positive 90 degrees. Therefore, east.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem says she spins 2250 degrees to the right, regardless of the coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a net rotation. So, spinning 2250 degrees to the right is a net rotation of 2250 degrees clockwise. Since 360 degrees is a full circle, 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25. So, 6 full circles bring her back, and 0.25 of a circle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, 2250 degrees clockwise is effectively 90 degrees clockwise from north, which is east.

Alternatively, if we think of it as a positive rotation, 2250 degrees is the same as 2250 mod 360, which is 90 degrees, so east.

Alternatively, if we think of it as a negative rotation, 2250 is equivalent to -90 degrees, which is 270 counterclockwise, which is west.

But which is it? Is it 90 degrees clockwise or 90 degrees counterclockwise?

Wait, maybe the confusion comes from the direction of rotation. If she's spinning to the right, that is a clockwise rotation, so positive 90 degrees. If she were spinning to the left, that would be counterclockwise, which is negative 90 degrees, or 270 degrees.

Therefore, the answer is east.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different convention. Maybe in some contexts, spinning to the right is considered a negative rotation. Hmm, I'm not sure. But in the absence of specific information, I think it's safer to assume that spinning to the right is a positive rotation, which is clockwise.

Therefore, 2250 degrees clockwise is 90 degrees, so east.

Wait, let me verify that.

Starting at north, 90 degrees clockwise: east.

180 degrees clockwise: south.

270 degrees clockwise: west.

360 degrees: back to north.

So, 90 degrees is east, 270 is west.

So, 90 degrees is east, so 2250 degrees is 90 degrees, so east.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of the unit circle. If the initial direction is north, which is 0 degrees in standard position, then a positive rotation (counterclockwise) by 90 degrees would be 90 degrees, which is east. A negative rotation (clockwise) by 90 degrees would be -90 degrees, which is equivalent to 270 degrees, which is west.

So, depending on the direction of rotation, positive or negative, she ends up facing east or west.

Therefore, since the problem states she is spinning to the right, which is clockwise, it should be east.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says she is facing north and then spins to the right. So, it's 2250 degrees, so regardless of direction, the net rotation is 90 degrees clockwise, which is east.

Therefore, the answer is east.

Wait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute 2250 divided by 360.

2250 divided by 360: 360*6 is 2160, 2250-2160=90, so 6 full rotations, plus 90 degrees.

Therefore, 2250 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees. Since she's spinning to the right, that's a clockwise rotation, so 90 degrees clockwise from north is east.

Therefore, she ends up facing east.

Alternatively, if it's a positive angle, but the problem says she's spinning to the right, so if we take that as a positive rotation, then 2250 degrees is 90 degrees clockwise.

Wait, but 2250 degrees is a lot, but 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25, so that's 6 full circles, 90 degrees. So, 90 degrees clockwise is east.

Therefore, the answer is east.

Wait, but let me also consider that sometimes, in some contexts, spinning to the right is considered a positive angle, but that might not be the case here. It's more about the direction of rotation.

Wait, another way to think about it is to use the concept of direction. If you're facing north and turn right (clockwise), you end up facing east. If you turn left (counterclockwise), you end up facing west.

So, given that she turns to the right, which is clockwise, she ends up facing east.

Alternatively, if you think about the unit circle, each 90-degree turn is a quarter turn, so a quarter turn clockwise from north is east, a half turn is south, three quarters is west, and full turn is back to north.

So, 90 degrees: east.

Therefore, 2250 degrees is 6 full turns plus 90 degrees, so she ends up facing east.

Therefore, the answer is east.

But wait, now I'm recalling that sometimes, in some contexts, especially in navigation, a right turn is counterclockwise, but in this case, it's a figure skater. So, I think in this case, it's a standard rotation, so we have to take the direction specified: spinning to the right. So, right is clockwise.

Therefore, I think east is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the total degrees modulo 360 and then find the direction.

2250 divided by 360 is 6 with a remainder of 90. So, 6 full circles, 90 degrees.

So, 90 degrees clockwise from north is east.

Therefore, she is facing east when she finishes her spin.

Wait, but I just want to make sure that I didn't make any mistake in the angle.

So, starting at north, 90 degrees clockwise: east.

180 degrees: south.

270 degrees: west.

So, 90 is east, 270 is west.

Thus, 90 degrees is east.

Therefore, the answer is east.

I think that's solid. So, the skater ends up facing east after spinning 2250 degrees to the right.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{E}
</think>

The figure skater starts facing north and spins 2250 degrees to the right. To determine her final direction, we need to convert the total rotation into an equivalent angle within a 360-degree circle.

First, we calculate the remainder when 2250 is divided by 360:
\[
2250 \div 360 = 6 \text{ remainder } 90
\]
This means 2250 degrees is equivalent to 6 full rotations (360 degrees each) plus an additional 90 degrees. Since 6 full rotations bring her back to the starting position, we only need to consider the remaining 90 degrees.

Next, we determine the direction she faces after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from north. Clockwise from north is east. Therefore, after spinning 2250 degrees to the right, she is facing east.

\[
\boxed{E}
\]
