Question:
Find all solutions to
\[\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
Since $\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} x$ for all $x,$ we can write
\[\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} x \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]Let $\theta = \tan^{-1} x,$ so $x = \tan \theta.$  Also, $\sin 2 \theta = \frac{1}{3},$ so
\[2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \frac{1}{3}.\]Construct a right triangle with legs 1 and $x.$  Then the angle opposite the side length $x$ be $\theta.$

[asy]
unitsize(1 cm);

pair A, B, C;

A = (2,1.8);
B = (0,0);
C = (2,0);

draw(A--B--C--cycle);
draw(rightanglemark(A,C,B,8));

label("$\theta$", B + (0.7,0.3));
label("$1$", (B + C)/2, S);
label("$x$", (A + C)/2, E);
label("$\sqrt{x^2 + 1}$", (A + B)/2, NW);
[/asy]

Also, the hypotenuse will be $\sqrt{x^2 + 1},$ so $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}$ and $\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}.$  Hence,
\[2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = \frac{1}{3},\]or
\[\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}.\]This gives us $x^2 + 1 = 6x,$ or $x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula, the roots are $x = \boxed{3 \pm 2 \sqrt{2}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, I've got this trigonometry problem here: Find all solutions to

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Hmm, okay. So, I need to find all real numbers x such that when I take the inverse tangent of x and add it to the inverse cotangent of 1/x, then take the sine of that sum, it equals 1/3. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's recall some trigonometric identities and properties that might help here. I remember that inverse trigonometric functions can sometimes be combined or simplified using identities or by substitution. Also, sine of a sum formula might be useful here. Let me write that down.

The sine of a sum formula is:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
\]

So, if I let A = tan^{-1}(x) and B = cot^{-1}(1/x), then the left-hand side of the equation becomes:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
\]

Therefore, the equation becomes:

\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Now, let me figure out what sin A, cos B, cos A, and sin B are in terms of x.

Starting with A = tan^{-1}(x). Let's consider a right triangle where the opposite side is x and the adjacent side is 1, because tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent. So, in this case, A is the angle whose tangent is x/1, so A = tan^{-1}(x). Then, the hypotenuse of this triangle would be sqrt(1 + x^2). Therefore, sin A would be opposite/hypotenuse = x / sqrt(1 + x^2), and cos A would be adjacent/hypotenuse = 1 / sqrt(1 + x^2).

So, that gives me:

\[
\sin A = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}, \quad \cos A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}.
\]

Now, moving on to B = cot^{-1}(1/x). Hmm, cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, so cot^{-1}(y) is the angle whose cotangent is y. So, B = cot^{-1}(1/x). Maybe it's easier to think in terms of tan, since cot is the reciprocal. Let me recall that cot^{-1}(y) = tan^{-1}(1/y), provided that y is positive. So, cot^{-1}(1/x) is the same as tan^{-1}(x). Wait, is that correct?

Let me check. If cot(theta) = 1/x, then tan(theta) = x, which would mean that theta = tan^{-1}(x). So, yes, cot^{-1}(1/x) = tan^{-1}(x). Therefore, B is equal to tan^{-1}(x), which is the same as A. So, A = B.

Wait, that seems interesting. So, both A and B are equal to tan^{-1}(x). So, in the expression sin(A + B), it becomes sin(2A). So, substituting back, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin(2A) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

So, substituting A = tan^{-1}(x):

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Hmm, okay, so now if I can express sin(2 tan^{-1}(x)) in terms of x, then I can set that equal to 1/3 and solve for x.

I remember that sin(2 theta) = 2 sin theta cos theta. So, if I let theta = tan^{-1}(x), then:

\[
\sin(2 theta) = 2 \sin theta \cos theta.
\]

But we already have expressions for sin theta and cos theta in terms of x. From earlier, sin theta = x / sqrt(1 + x^2) and cos theta = 1 / sqrt(1 + x^2). Therefore,

\[
\sin(2 theta) = 2 * (x / sqrt(1 + x^2)) * (1 / sqrt(1 + x^2)) = 2x / (1 + x^2).
\]

Therefore, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Now, I can solve this equation for x. Let me write that out:

\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Cross-multiplying to eliminate the denominators:

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Bringing all terms to one side:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

Now, this is a quadratic equation in standard form. Let me use the quadratic formula to solve for x. The quadratic formula is:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]

where a = 1, b = -6, and c = 1. Plugging in these values:

\[
x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4*1*1}}{2*1} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2}.
\]

Simplify sqrt(32): sqrt(32) = sqrt(16*2) = 4*sqrt(2). So,

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator terms by 2:

\[
x = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

So, the solutions are x = 3 + 2√2 and x = 3 - 2√2.

But wait, let me double-check if these solutions are valid. Because sometimes when dealing with inverse trigonometric functions, the range might restrict the values of x.

First, let's consider the domain of the original equation. The expressions inside the inverse functions are:

- tan^{-1}(x): the domain is all real numbers, so x can be any real number.
- cot^{-1}(1/x): the domain is also all real numbers except x=0, because cot(theta) is undefined at theta=0. Wait, actually, cot(theta) is defined for all real numbers except multiples of pi, but since we have cot^{-1}(1/x), 1/x is a real number except when x=0. So, x cannot be zero. Therefore, we must have x ≠ 0.

But in our solutions, x = 3 + 2√2 ≈ 3 + 2.828 ≈ 5.828, and x = 3 - 2√2 ≈ 3 - 2.828 ≈ 0.172. Neither of these are zero, so both solutions are valid.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure that when we take cot^{-1}(1/x), it's actually equal to tan^{-1}(x) as we previously reasoned. Because sometimes, inverse functions can have different ranges, but in this case, I think it's okay because both A and B are in the principal value branches.

Let me think about the ranges. The range of tan^{-1}(x) is (-π/2, π/2), but actually, more precisely, it's usually defined as (-π/2, π/2). But cot^{-1}(y) is usually defined as (0, π). Wait, no, actually, I think cot^{-1}(y) is defined as (0, π) for real y, excluding zero, but actually, cot^{-1}(y) has a range of (0, π). But tan^{-1}(x) is in (-π/2, π/2). So, when we have cot^{-1}(1/x), is it in (0, π) or (-π/2, π/2)?

Wait, let's be precise. The principal value of cot^{-1}(y) is (0, π). So, even though cot^{-1}(1/x) is in (0, π). But tan^{-1}(x) is in (-π/2, π/2). So, does tan^{-1}(x) equal to cot^{-1}(1/x)? Let's test with a specific value.

Let me take x = 1. Then, tan^{-1}(1) = π/4, and cot^{-1}(1/1) = cot^{-1}(1) = π/4. So, they are equal. Similarly, take x = sqrt(3). tan^{-1}(sqrt(3)) = π/3, and cot^{-1}(1/sqrt(3)) = π/3. So, they are equal.

Another example: x = 2. tan^{-1}(2) ≈ 1.107 radians, cot^{-1}(1/2) ≈ 1.107 radians. So, they are equal. Hmm, so it seems that for x > 0, tan^{-1}(x) = cot^{-1}(1/x). But wait, what about x negative?

Let me take x = -1. tan^{-1}(-1) = -π/4, and cot^{-1}(1/(-1)) = cot^{-1}(-1). But cot^{-1}(-1) is π - π/4 = 3π/4. So, tan^{-1}(-1) = -π/4, and cot^{-1}(-1) = 3π/4. So, they are not equal. Therefore, in the case where x is negative, these two expressions are actually negatives of each other.

Wait, that complicates things a bit. So, in the problem, the equation is sin(A + B) where A = tan^{-1}(x) and B = cot^{-1}(1/x). When x is positive, A and B are both in (0, π/2), so their sum is in (0, π). When x is negative, A is in (-π/2, 0), and B is in (0, π), so their sum is in (0 - π/2, π - π/2) = (-π/2, π/2). Wait, but sine is an odd function, so sin(A + B) would be sin(A + B) = -sin(|A + B|). So, perhaps I need to be cautious about the signs.

Wait, but in the original equation, we have sin(A + B) = 1/3, which is positive. So, sin(A + B) must be positive. Therefore, the angle A + B must be in (0, π), or in (2π - π, 2π), but since A and B are both between -π/2 and π/2 or between 0 and π, their sum is between -π and π. Hmm, this might get complicated.

But in our original derivation, we assumed that A = B when x is positive, but when x is negative, A = -B', where B' is the positive angle. So, in that case, A + B would be -B' + B. But depending on the exact value, it might still be positive or negative.

Wait, but in the original equation, we have sin(A + B) = 1/3, which is positive. So, A + B must be in (0, π) or (2π - π, 2π) but since A + B is in (-π, π), the only possibilities are (0, π) and (2π - π, 2π), but in the context of the principal values, perhaps we only consider (0, π). Hmm.

Wait, actually, perhaps it's better to consider that in the original problem, A and B are such that A = tan^{-1}(x) and B = cot^{-1}(1/x). If x is positive, then A and B are in (0, π/2), so A + B is in (0, π). If x is negative, then A is in (-π/2, 0) and B is in (0, π), so A + B is in (-π/2, π). So, sin(A + B) could be positive or negative depending on the value of A + B.

But in our case, sin(A + B) = 1/3, which is positive. Therefore, A + B must be in (0, π). So, when x is negative, we have to make sure that A + B is in (0, π). Let me check.

Take x = -1, as before. A = tan^{-1}(-1) = -π/4, B = cot^{-1}(1/(-1)) = cot^{-1}(-1) = 3π/4. So, A + B = -π/4 + 3π/4 = π/2, which is still in (0, π). So, sin(π/2) = 1, which is not 1/3, so that doesn't satisfy the equation.

Wait, so when x is negative, A + B can be in (0, π), but sin(A + B) might not necessarily be 1/3. So, in the case when x is negative, does A + B result in a positive sine value?

Let me test another negative x, say x = -2. A = tan^{-1}(-2) ≈ -1.107, and B = cot^{-1}(1/(-2)) = cot^{-1}(-0.5). Cot^{-1}(-0.5) is equal to π - cot^{-1}(0.5) ≈ π - 0.4636 ≈ 2.677 radians. So, A + B ≈ -1.107 + 2.677 ≈ 1.57 radians, which is π/2. So, sin(π/2) = 1 again. Hmm, same as before.

Wait, so for x negative, whether A + B is positive or not depends on the specific value of x. Maybe in some cases, A + B is in (0, π), and in others, it might be in (-π, 0). Let me check another x.

Take x = -sqrt(3). Then, A = tan^{-1}(-sqrt(3)) = -π/3, and B = cot^{-1}(1/(-sqrt(3))) = cot^{-1}(-1/sqrt(3)) = π - cot^{-1}(1/sqrt(3)) ≈ π - 0.6155 ≈ 2.525 radians. So, A + B ≈ -π/3 + 2.525 ≈ -1.047 + 2.525 ≈ 1.478 radians, which is still in (0, π). So, sin(1.478) ≈ 0.996, which is close to 1, but not 1/3.

Wait, so is it possible that for some negative x, A + B is in (0, π), but sin(A + B) can be 1/3? Let me think.

Suppose x is negative. Let x = -k, where k > 0. Then, A = tan^{-1}(-k) = -tan^{-1}(k), and B = cot^{-1}(1/(-k)) = cot^{-1}(-1/k) = π - cot^{-1}(1/k). Therefore, A + B = -tan^{-1}(k) + π - cot^{-1}(1/k). Let me compute this:

A + B = π - tan^{-1}(k) - cot^{-1}(1/k).

But cot^{-1}(1/k) is equal to tan^{-1}(k). Because cot^{-1}(y) = tan^{-1}(1/y). So, cot^{-1}(1/k) = tan^{-1}(k). Therefore,

A + B = π - tan^{-1}(k) - tan^{-1}(k) = π - 2 tan^{-1}(k).

Thus, sin(A + B) = sin(π - 2 tan^{-1}(k)) = sin(2 tan^{-1}(k)) because sin(π - theta) = sin(theta). So, sin(A + B) = sin(2 tan^{-1}(k)).

But from earlier, we had sin(2 tan^{-1}(k)) = 2k / (1 + k^2). Therefore, sin(A + B) = 2k / (1 + k^2). So, in the case when x is negative, sin(A + B) = 2|x| / (1 + x^2). Therefore, when x is negative, sin(A + B) = 2k / (1 + k^2) = 2|x| / (1 + x^2).

Wait, so the equation sin(A + B) = 1/3 becomes:

If x > 0: 2x / (1 + x^2) = 1/3
If x < 0: 2|x| / (1 + x^2) = 1/3

But in both cases, whether x is positive or negative, the equation reduces to 2|x| / (1 + x^2) = 1/3, because |x| is just k, and x is positive or negative.

Therefore, the solutions for x can be both positive and negative, but only if 2|x| / (1 + x^2) = 1/3.

But in our earlier quadratic equation, we found x = 3 ± 2√2, which are both positive (since 3 + 2√2 ≈ 5.828 and 3 - 2√2 ≈ 0.172). So, x cannot be negative because 3 - 2√2 is still positive. Therefore, our only solutions are x = 3 + 2√2 and x = 3 - 2√2, as previously found.

Wait, but hold on. When x is negative, even though sin(A + B) = 2|x| / (1 + x^2), which is the same as 2|x| / (1 + x^2), but we have to ensure that A + B is in (0, π), because sin is positive. So, when x is negative, we must have A + B in (0, π) as well.

But in the case when x is negative, as we saw earlier, A + B = π - 2 tan^{-1}(k), where k = |x|. Then, sin(A + B) = sin(2 tan^{-1}(k)) = 2k / (1 + k^2) = 1/3.

So, 2k / (1 + k^2) = 1/3. Let's solve this equation for k:

2k = (1 + k^2) / 3

Multiply both sides by 3:

6k = 1 + k^2

Bring all terms to one side:

k^2 - 6k + 1 = 0

Which is the same quadratic equation as before. So, the solutions for k are:

k = [6 ± sqrt(36 - 4)] / 2 = [6 ± sqrt(32)] / 2 = [6 ± 4√2] / 2 = 3 ± 2√2.

Therefore, k = 3 + 2√2 or k = 3 - 2√2.

But since k = |x| and x is negative, then x = -k. Therefore, the solutions for x would be x = - (3 + 2√2) or x = - (3 - 2√2).

Wait, but 3 - 2√2 is approximately 0.172, which is positive. So, x would be negative, so x = - (3 - 2√2) = 2√2 - 3.

But 2√2 is approximately 2.828, so 2√2 - 3 ≈ -0.172.

Therefore, the solutions are x = 3 + 2√2 and x = 2√2 - 3.

Wait, hold on. So, in the case when x is negative, the solution is x = -k, where k = 3 ± 2√2. So, 3 + 2√2 is positive, so k = 3 + 2√2, so x = - (3 + 2√2). Similarly, k = 3 - 2√2 is positive, so x = - (3 - 2√2) = -3 + 2√2, which is approximately -0.172.

Therefore, the solutions are x = 3 + 2√2 and x = -3 + 2√2.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure that x = - (3 + 2√2) is a solution. Let me test x = - (3 + 2√2):

Compute tan^{-1}(x) and cot^{-1}(1/x).

First, x = - (3 + 2√2). So, A = tan^{-1}(- (3 + 2√2)) = - tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2). Let me compute tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2). Let me note that 3 + 2√2 is equal to (1 + √2)^2, since (1 + √2)^2 = 1 + 2√2 + 2 = 3 + 2√2. So, 3 + 2√2 = (1 + √2)^2, so tan^{-1}((1 + √2)^2). Hmm, what angle has tangent equal to (1 + √2)^2? Let me recall that tan(π/8) = √2 - 1, and tan(3π/8) = √2 + 1. Let me compute tan(3π/8):

tan(3π/8) = tan(67.5 degrees) = √2 + 1 ≈ 2.414. But (1 + √2)^2 = (1 + 2.414)^2 ≈ (3.414)^2 ≈ 11.657, which is way larger than tan(3π/8). Wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me compute (1 + √2)^2.

(1 + √2)^2 = 1 + 2√2 + 2 = 3 + 2√2. So, tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2) is an angle whose tangent is 3 + 2√2. Let me denote θ = tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2). Then, tan(theta) = 3 + 2√2. What is tan(theta)?

Wait, tan(theta) = 3 + 2√2. Let me consider that 3 + 2√2 can be expressed as (sqrt(2) + 1)^2 because:

(sqrt(2) + 1)^2 = 2 + 2√2 + 1 = 3 + 2√2. So, tan(theta) = (sqrt(2) + 1)^2. Therefore, theta = 2 * tan^{-1}(sqrt(2) + 1). Wait, because tan(2 phi) = 2 tan phi / (1 - tan^2 phi). Let me test phi = tan^{-1}(sqrt(2) + 1). Then, tan(phi) = sqrt(2) + 1. Then,

tan(2 phi) = 2 tan(phi) / (1 - tan^2(phi)) = 2 (sqrt(2) + 1) / (1 - (3 + 2 sqrt(2))) = 2 (sqrt(2) + 1) / (-2 - 2 sqrt(2)).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by -1:

= -2 (sqrt(2) + 1) / (2 + 2 sqrt(2)) = -2 (sqrt(2) + 1) / [2(1 + sqrt(2))] = -1.

Therefore, tan(2 phi) = -1. Therefore, 2 phi = 3π/4 or 7π/4. But since phi is in (0, π/2), 2 phi is in (0, π), so 2 phi = 3π/4, so phi = 3π/8.

Therefore, tan^{-1}(sqrt(2) + 1) = 3π/8. So, tan(theta) = (sqrt(2) + 1)^2 = tan(2 * 3π/8) = tan(3π/4). But tan(3π/4) = -1. But theta is in (0, π/2), so tan(theta) is positive, but tan(3π/4) is -1. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in signs. Let me re-examine.

If tan(phi) = sqrt(2) + 1, then phi is in the first quadrant, and 2 phi would be 3π/4, which is in the second quadrant. So, tan(2 phi) = tan(3π/4) = -1. But tan(theta) = (sqrt(2) + 1)^2, which is (sqrt(2) + 1)^2 = (sqrt(2) + 1)^2, which is positive, as sqrt(2) + 1 is positive, so (sqrt(2) + 1)^2 is positive. Therefore, tan(theta) = (sqrt(2) + 1)^2, which is positive, and tan(2 phi) = -1, but tan(theta) is positive. Therefore, 2 phi can't be 3π/4 because tan(3π/4) is negative. Therefore, perhaps 2 phi is actually 3π/4, but tan(theta) is positive, so maybe theta is in the third or first quadrant? Wait, no, because theta is tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2), which is in the first quadrant, between 0 and π/2.

Wait, perhaps I need a different approach. Let me compute tan(theta) = 3 + 2√2.

Let me compute tan(theta) = 3 + 2√2, so let's find theta.

Alternatively, since 3 + 2√2 is approximately 3 + 2.828 ≈ 5.828, which is a large tangent value, so theta is close to π/2.

But perhaps, rather than going into that, let me consider the original substitution. When x = - (3 + 2√2), then A = tan^{-1}(- (3 + 2√2)) = - tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2). Let me denote phi = tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2). Then, A = -phi.

Similarly, B = cot^{-1}(1/x) = cot^{-1}(1/(- (3 + 2√2))) = cot^{-1}(-1/(3 + 2√2)).

But cot^{-1}(y) is equal to tan^{-1}(1/y) for y positive, but for y negative, it's equal to π - tan^{-1}(1/y). So, let me compute 1/x for x = - (3 + 2√2): 1/x = -1/(3 + 2√2). Let me rationalize that:

1/x = -1/(3 + 2√2) * (3 - 2√2)/(3 - 2√2) = -(3 - 2√2)/(9 - 8) = -(3 - 2√2)/1 = -3 + 2√2.

So, B = cot^{-1}(1/x) = cot^{-1}(-3 + 2√2). Now, let me compute cot^{-1}(-3 + 2√2). Since cot^{-1}(y) is equal to tan^{-1}(1/y) for y positive, but for y negative, it's equal to π - tan^{-1}(1/y).

So, cot^{-1}(-3 + 2√2) = π - tan^{-1}(1/(-3 + 2√2)).

Compute 1/(-3 + 2√2): Let me rationalize:

1/(-3 + 2√2) = [1/(-3 + 2√2)] * [(-3 - 2√2)/(-3 - 2√2)] = (-3 - 2√2)/[9 - 8] = (-3 - 2√2)/1 = -3 - 2√2.

So, tan^{-1}(1/(-3 + 2√2)) = tan^{-1}(-3 - 2√2).

But -3 - 2√2 is a negative value. So, tan^{-1}(-3 - 2√2) is equal to -tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2), since tan is odd.

Therefore, cot^{-1}(-3 + 2√2) = π - [ - tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2) ] = π + tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2).

Therefore, B = π + tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2).

So, putting it all together, A = - tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2), and B = π + tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2). Therefore, A + B = - tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2) + π + tan^{-1}(3 + 2√2) = π.

So, sin(A + B) = sin(π) = 0, which is not 1/3. Wait, that's a problem.

So, if x = - (3 + 2√2), then sin(A + B) = 0, which is not equal to 1/3. Therefore, x = - (3 + 2√2) is not a solution. Therefore, the only valid solutions are the positive ones, x = 3 + 2√2 and x = 3 - 2√2.

Wait, but hold on. Earlier, when I considered the general case, sin(2 tan^{-1}(k)) = 2k/(1 + k^2) for positive k, but when k is negative, we have sin(2 tan^{-1}(k)) = -2k/(1 + k^2). Because tan^{-1}(k) is in (-π/2, π/2), so 2 tan^{-1}(k) is in (-pi, pi), so sin(2 tan^{-1}(k)) = 2k/(1 + k^2) if 2 tan^{-1}(k) is in (-pi, 0), and sin(2 tan^{-1}(k)) = -2k/(1 + k^2) if 2 tan^{-1}(k) is in (0, pi). Hmm, so in our case, when x is negative, we have:

If x = -k, then A + B = π - 2 tan^{-1}(k). So, depending on the value of k, this angle could be in (0, pi) or (-pi, 0). Let me think.

If k = 3 - 2√2 ≈ 0.172, which is positive, so A + B = π - 2 tan^{-1}(0.172). tan^{-1}(0.172) is approximately 0.17 radians. So, A + B ≈ π - 2*0.17 ≈ 3.14 - 0.34 ≈ 2.80 radians, which is in (0, pi). Therefore, sin(A + B) = sin(2.80) ≈ sin(160 degrees) ≈ 0.275, which is not 1/3. So, sin(A + B) ≈ 0.275, which is not 1/3.

Wait, so in this case, sin(A + B) = 2k/(1 + k^2) with k = 0.172, which is approximately 0.172, so 2k/(1 + k^2) ≈ 0.344 / 1.029 ≈ 0.333, which is approximately 1/3. So, that works.

Wait, but when I plug in x = -k, where k = 3 - 2√2, A + B = π - 2 tan^{-1}(k). So, sin(A + B) = sin(π - 2 tan^{-1}(k)) = sin(2 tan^{-1}(k)).

But if k is positive, 2 tan^{-1}(k) is positive, so sin(2 tan^{-1}(k)) = 2k/(1 + k^2). So, in this case, sin(A + B) = 2k/(1 + k^2) = 1/3.

Therefore, even though x is negative, sin(A + B) is still positive, equal to 1/3, as desired.

Wait, so perhaps my earlier conclusion was wrong. Let me re-examine:

If x is negative, x = -k, then A = tan^{-1}(-k) = -tan^{-1}(k), and B = cot^{-1}(1/x) = cot^{-1}(-1/k) = π - cot^{-1}(1/k) = π - tan^{-1}(k).

Therefore, A + B = -tan^{-1}(k) + π - tan^{-1}(k) = π - 2 tan^{-1}(k).

So, sin(A + B) = sin(π - 2 tan^{-1}(k)) = sin(2 tan^{-1}(k)).

So, regardless of the sign of x, sin(A + B) = 2k/(1 + k^2), which is equal to 1/3.

But wait, in the case when x is negative, k = |x|, so 2k/(1 + k^2) = 1/3.

Therefore, 2k = (1 + k^2)/3, which leads to 6k = 1 + k^2, which is the same quadratic equation as before: k^2 - 6k + 1 = 0, giving k = 3 ± 2√2.

Therefore, since k is |x|, x can be either 3 + 2√2 or 3 - 2√2. But 3 - 2√2 is positive, so x = 3 + 2√2 and x = 3 - 2√2 are both valid, regardless of x being positive or negative. But wait, hold on. If x is negative, and k = |x| = 3 - 2√2, then x = - (3 - 2√2) ≈ -0.172, which is a valid solution, but we saw that when x = -0.172, sin(A + B) ≈ 0.275, which is approximately 1/3, but in decimal terms, is 0.275 equal to 1/3? No, 1/3 is approximately 0.333. Therefore, perhaps my earlier approximation is off because when x is negative, sin(A + B) is 2k/(1 + k^2), which is 1/3, but when I plug in x = - (3 - 2√2), I get a different value.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute sin(A + B) when x is negative. Let me take x = - (3 - 2√2) ≈ -0.172.

So, A = tan^{-1}(-0.172) ≈ -0.172 radians, and B = cot^{-1}(1/(-0.172)) ≈ cot^{-1}(-5.814). Cot^{-1}(-5.814) is equal to π - cot^{-1}(5.814).

Compute cot^{-1}(5.814). Since cot^{-1}(y) is equal to tan^{-1}(1/y) for positive y, so cot^{-1}(5.814) = tan^{-1}(1/5.814) ≈ tan^{-1}(0.172) ≈ 0.17 radians. Therefore, cot^{-1}(-5.814) = π - 0.17 ≈ 2.97 radians.

Therefore, A + B ≈ -0.172 + 2.97 ≈ 2.798 radians, which is approximately 160 degrees, as before. So, sin(2.798) ≈ sin(160°) ≈ 0.275, which is not 1/3.

Wait, so that suggests that when x is negative, sin(A + B) is approximately 0.275, which is not 1/3, so x = - (3 - 2√2) is not a solution. But according to our earlier algebra, we have sin(A + B) = 2k/(1 + k^2) = 1/3, so with k = 3 - 2√2, which is positive, so 2k/(1 + k^2) = 1/3, so sin(A + B) = 1/3.

But in reality, plugging x = - (3 - 2√2) into the original equation, sin(A + B) is not equal to 1/3, but approximately 0.275.

Wait, that suggests that perhaps x = - (3 - 2√2) is not a solution, but according to our previous algebra, it should be. So, where is the mistake?

Wait, hold on, let's recast:

We have x = -k, k = |x|, so k = 3 - 2√2.

Then, A = tan^{-1}(-k) = - tan^{-1}(k).

B = cot^{-1}(1/x) = cot^{-1}(-1/k) = π - cot^{-1}(1/k) = π - tan^{-1}(k).

Therefore, A + B = - tan^{-1}(k) + π - tan^{-1}(k) = π - 2 tan^{-1}(k).

Therefore, sin(A + B) = sin(π - 2 tan^{-1}(k)) = sin(2 tan^{-1}(k)).

But sin(2 tan^{-1}(k)) = 2k/(1 + k^2).

But k = 3 - 2√2, so 2k/(1 + k^2) = 2*(3 - 2√2)/(1 + (3 - 2√2)^2).

Compute denominator: (3 - 2√2)^2 = 9 - 12√2 + 8 = 17 - 12√2.

Therefore, 1 + (3 - 2√2)^2 = 1 + 17 - 12√2 = 18 - 12√2.

Thus, 2k/(1 + k^2) = 2*(3 - 2√2)/(18 - 12√2).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (18 + 12√2) to rationalize:

= [2*(3 - 2√2)*(18 + 12√2)] / [(18 - 12√2)(18 + 12√2)].

Compute denominator: 18^2 - (12√2)^2 = 324 - 288 = 36.

Compute numerator:

First, compute (3 - 2√2)(18 + 12√2):

= 3*18 + 3*12√2 - 2√2*18 - 2√2*12√2

= 54 + 36√2 - 36√2 - 48

= (54 - 48) + (36√2 - 36√2)

= 6 + 0

= 6.

Therefore, numerator = 2*6 = 12.

Thus, 12 / 36 = 1/3.

Therefore, sin(A + B) = 1/3, which is correct. Therefore, x = - (3 - 2√2) is a solution.

But when I plug in x = - (3 - 2√2) into the original equation numerically, I get sin(A + B) ≈ 0.275, which is approximately 1/3, but not exactly. However, due to the approximations in decimal calculations, perhaps it's accurate enough.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, let me compute sin(π - 2 tan^{-1}(k)) where k = 3 - 2√2.

Compute tan^{-1}(k): k = 3 - 2√2 ≈ 3 - 2.828 ≈ 0.172 radians.

So, tan^{-1}(0.172) ≈ 0.172 radians.

Therefore, 2 tan^{-1}(k) ≈ 2*0.172 ≈ 0.344 radians.

Therefore, π - 0.344 ≈ 2.7976 radians.

sin(2.7976) ≈ sin(160 degrees) ≈ 0.275637.

Which is approximately 1/3 (≈ 0.3333). But it's not exactly 1/3, but very close. The exact value is 1/3, so perhaps due to the approximations in the decimal, it's close but not exactly 1/3. But in reality, it's exactly 1/3 because we derived it algebraically.

Wait, but how? Let me think.

When I computed sin(2 tan^{-1}(k)) with k = 3 - 2√2, I got 1/3 exactly. Because when I rationalized it, it's exact. So, perhaps the decimal approximations are causing confusion.

Therefore, x = - (3 - 2√2) is a valid solution, same as x = 3 + 2√2. So, the solutions are x = 3 + 2√2 and x = 3 - 2√2.

But wait, when I plug x = 3 - 2√2 into the original equation:

Compute A = tan^{-1}(3 - 2√2) ≈ tan^{-1}(0.172) ≈ 0.172 radians.

Compute B = cot^{-1}(1/(3 - 2√2)) = cot^{-1}(1/(3 - 2√2)).

Compute 1/(3 - 2√2): rationalize to get (3 + 2√2)/1 = 3 + 2√2.

Thus, cot^{-1}(3 + 2√2) = tan^{-1}(1/(3 + 2√2)).

Compute 1/(3 + 2√2): rationalize to get (3 - 2√2)/1 = 3 - 2√2.

Therefore, cot^{-1}(3 + 2√2) = tan^{-1}(3 - 2√2) ≈ tan^{-1}(0.172) ≈ 0.172 radians.

Therefore, A + B ≈ 0.172 + 0.172 ≈ 0.344 radians.

sin(0.344) ≈ 0.333, which is approximately 1/3, but not exactly. Wait, 0.344 radians is approximately 19.7 degrees, so sin(19.7 degrees) ≈ 0.342, which is close to 1/3.

But exact value is 2k/(1 + k^2) = 1/3, so sin(A + B) = 1/3 exactly.

Wait, but in this case, A = tan^{-1}(k) and B = tan^{-1}(1/k), so A + B = tan^{-1}(k) + tan^{-1}(1/k) = π/2.

Wait, hold on! Earlier, I thought that tan^{-1}(k) + cot^{-1}(1/k) is π/2, but in reality, tan^{-1}(k) + cot^{-1}(1/k) = π/2 only when k > 0. However, for k < 0, it's π - π/2 = π/2.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier conclusion. Let me test it with a specific example. Let me take k = 1. tan^{-1}(1) + cot^{-1}(1) = π/4 + π/4 = π/2. So, that works.

Take k = 2. tan^{-1}(2) + cot^{-1}(1/2) ≈ 1.107 + 1.107 ≈ 2.214 radians, which is approximately 126.87 degrees, which is not π/2. Wait, that contradicts.

Wait, no, wait, π/2 is 1.5708 radians. But tan^{-1}(2) ≈ 1.107 radians, cot^{-1}(1/2) ≈ 1.107 radians, so adding them gives ≈ 2.214 radians, which is about 126.87 degrees. So, that's not π/2. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong. So, actually, tan^{-1}(k) + cot^{-1}(1/k) is not necessarily π/2 for k < 0.

Therefore, when k is negative, A + B = tan^{-1}(k) + cot^{-1}(1/x) = tan^{-1}(k) + cot^{-1}(-1/k) = tan^{-1}(k) - cot^{-1}(1/k) = tan^{-1}(k) - (π/2 - tan^{-1}(1/k)) = tan^{-1}(k) + tan^{-1}(1/k) - π/2.

Wait, so A + B = π/2 - π/2 = 0? Wait, that can't be, because A + B is in (0, π) for positive x and in (π, 2π) for negative x. Wait, no.

Wait, let's take x = - (3 - 2√2) ≈ -0.172. Then, A = tan^{-1}(-0.172) ≈ -0.172 radians, and B = cot^{-1}(1/(-0.172)) ≈ cot^{-1}(-5.814) ≈ π - cot^{-1}(5.814) ≈ π - 1.373 ≈ 1.768 radians.

Therefore, A + B ≈ -0.172 + 1.768 ≈ 1.596 radians, which is approximately 91.8 degrees. So, sin(1.596) ≈ sin(91.8°) ≈ 0.999, which is close to 1, but not 1/3. Wait, that contradicts.

Wait, hold on, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should approach this problem differently.

Let me consider the original equation:

sin(tan^{-1}(x) + cot^{-1}(1/x)) = 1/3.

Let me denote θ = tan^{-1}(x), so cot^{-1}(1/x) = tan^{-1}(x) as we saw earlier. So, θ = tan^{-1}(x), and cot^{-1}(1/x) = tan^{-1}(x). Therefore, the equation becomes sin(2θ) = 1/3.

Therefore, sin(2θ) = 1/3, which implies 2θ = sin^{-1}(1/3), so θ = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3). Since θ = tan^{-1}(x), then x = tan(θ) = tan( (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3) ).

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the identity for sin(2θ) = 1/3, so 2θ = sin^{-1}(1/3). Therefore, θ = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3). So, x = tan(theta) = tan( (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3) ).

Alternatively, using the identity for tan(theta/2):

tan(theta/2) = sin(theta) / (1 + cos(theta)).

But maybe it's better to express x in terms of sin^{-1}(1/3).

Let me set φ = sin^{-1}(1/3). So, sin(phi) = 1/3, and phi is in [-π/2, π/2]. Then, tan(theta) = x = tan(phi/2).

Because theta = (1/2) phi.

So, tan(theta) = tan(phi/2). So, x = tan(phi/2).

We can compute tan(phi/2) using the double-angle formula.

We know that tan(phi) = 1/3, so using the identity:

tan(phi) = 2 tan(phi/2) / (1 - tan^2(phi/2)).

Let me let t = tan(phi/2). Then:

1/3 = 2t / (1 - t^2).

Multiply both sides by (1 - t^2):

(1/3)(1 - t^2) = 2t.

Multiply both sides by 3:

1 - t^2 = 6t.

Rearrange:

t^2 + 6t - 1 = 0.

Solve for t:

t = [-6 ± sqrt(36 + 4)] / 2 = [-6 ± sqrt(40)] / 2 = [-6 ± 2 sqrt(10)] / 2 = -3 ± sqrt(10).

Since phi is in [-π/2, π/2], and phi = sin^{-1}(1/3) is in [0, π/2], so phi/2 is in [0, π/4], so tan(phi/2) is positive. Therefore, t = tan(phi/2) must be positive, so t = -3 + sqrt(10).

Compute sqrt(10) ≈ 3.162, so -3 + 3.162 ≈ 0.162, which is positive.

Therefore, x = tan(phi/2) = -3 + sqrt(10).

Wait, but wait. sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 0.162, so x = sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 0.162. But earlier, when I set x = 3 - 2√2, which is approximately 0.172, and x = 3 + 2√2, which is approximately 5.828, I found that x = 3 - 2√2 is a solution.

But according to this approach, x = sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 0.162 is the solution. There seems to be a discrepancy.

Wait, so which one is correct? Let me compute.

Compute x = sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 3.162 - 3 ≈ 0.162.

Compute sin(tan^{-1}(0.162) + cot^{-1}(1/0.162)).

Compute tan^{-1}(0.162) ≈ 0.162 radians.

Compute cot^{-1}(1/0.162) = cot^{-1}(6.164). Since cot^{-1}(y) = tan^{-1}(1/y). So, cot^{-1}(6.164) = tan^{-1}(1/6.164) ≈ tan^{-1}(0.162) ≈ 0.162 radians.

Therefore, A + B ≈ 0.162 + 0.162 ≈ 0.324 radians.

sin(0.324) ≈ 0.313, which is close to 1/3 ≈ 0.333, but not exactly.

Wait, so this suggests that my previous approach via double angle was wrong. Because here, x = sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 0.162, but sin(2 theta) ≈ 0.313, which is close to 1/3.

But according to the equation sin(2 theta) = 1/3, theta should be (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3). Let me compute sin^{-1}(1/3) ≈ 0.3398 radians. Then theta ≈ 0.1699 radians. Then, tan(theta) ≈ 0.173, which is close to 0.162, but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps the exact solution is x = tan(phi/2), where phi is sin^{-1}(1/3). But according to the algebra, x = -3 + sqrt(10) ≈ 0.162, but according to the double angle formula, it's x = sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 0.162, but when plugged in, it gives sin(2 theta) ≈ 0.313, which is not exactly 1/3.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the double angle formula approach.

Wait, let's clarify.

We had:

sin(2 theta) = 1/3, where theta = tan^{-1}(x).

So, 2 theta = sin^{-1}(1/3), so theta = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3).

Therefore, x = tan(theta) = tan( (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3) ).

Using the identity tan(theta/2) = sin(theta)/(1 + cos(theta)).

Let me compute sin(theta) and cos(theta):

Given theta = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3), so sin(theta) = sin(phi/2), where phi = sin^{-1}(1/3).

So, sin(phi) = 1/3, cos(phi) = sqrt(1 - (1/3)^2) = sqrt(8/9) = 2 sqrt(2)/3.

Therefore, sin(theta) = sin(phi/2) = sqrt( (1 - cos(phi))/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - 2 sqrt(2)/3 ) / 2 ) = sqrt( (3 - 2 sqrt(2))/6 ).

Similarly, cos(theta) = cos(phi/2) = sqrt( (1 + cos(phi))/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + 2 sqrt(2)/3 ) / 2 ) = sqrt( (3 + 2 sqrt(2))/6 ).

Therefore, tan(theta) = sin(theta)/cos(theta) = sqrt( (3 - 2 sqrt(2))/6 ) / sqrt( (3 + 2 sqrt(2))/6 ) = sqrt( (3 - 2 sqrt(2))/(3 + 2 sqrt(2)) ).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (3 - 2 sqrt(2)):

= sqrt( (3 - 2 sqrt(2))^2 / (9 - 8) ) = sqrt( (9 - 12 sqrt(2) + 8) / 1 ) = sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)).

Wait, 17 - 12 sqrt(2) ≈ 17 - 16.97 ≈ 0.03, so sqrt(0.03) ≈ 0.173.

Therefore, x = tan(theta) ≈ 0.173, which is close to our numerical approximation earlier.

But in exact terms, sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)) is the exact value.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)).

Let me suppose sqrt(a - b sqrt(c)) = sqrt(d) - sqrt(e). Let me square both sides:

a - b sqrt(c) = d + e - 2 sqrt(d e).

Therefore, equate:

a = d + e

b sqrt(c) = 2 sqrt(d e)

Let me set a = 17, b = 12, c = 2.

Therefore:

17 = d + e

12 sqrt(2) = 2 sqrt(d e) => 6 sqrt(2) = sqrt(d e) => d e = 72.

So, we have d + e = 17, d e = 72.

Find integers d and e such that d + e = 17 and d e = 72.

Looking for factors of 72 that add up to 17.

Factors of 72:

1 and 72

2 and 36

3 and 24

4 and 18

6 and 12

8 and 9

Looking for two numbers that add up to 17.

Looking at 8 and 9: 8 + 9 = 17, 8*9=72. Perfect.

Therefore, sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)) = sqrt(9) - sqrt(8) = 3 - 2 sqrt(2).

Therefore, x = tan(theta) = sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)) = 3 - 2 sqrt(2).

But 3 - 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 3 - 2.828 ≈ 0.172, which is the positive solution we found earlier.

But in the double angle approach, I thought x = sqrt(10) - 3, which is approximately 0.162, but actually, tan(theta) = sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)) = 3 - 2 sqrt(2), which is approximately 0.172, which is different.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake earlier when solving the quadratic equation. Let me go back.

I had the equation:

tan(2 phi) = 2x/(1 + x^2) = 1/3.

So, 2 phi = sin^{-1}(1/3).

Therefore, phi = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3).

But when I tried to compute tan(phi), I used the identity tan(phi) = 2 tan(phi/2) / (1 - tan^2(phi/2)), which is correct. Then, solving for tan(phi/2), I got x = -3 + sqrt(10). But sqrt(10) - 3 is approximately 0.162, which is different from 3 - 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 0.172.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 3.162 - 3 ≈ 0.162.

But 3 - 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 0.172.

So, they are close but not the same.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, if I compute x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 0.172, which is a solution to the quadratic equation k^2 - 6k + 1 = 0, so 2k/(1 + k^2) = 1/3. Therefore, sin(2 theta) = 1/3, which is correct.

But when I computed x = tan(phi/2) using the double angle formula, I thought I got sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)) ≈ 0.173, which is close to 3 - 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 0.172.

Wait, but sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)) is equal to 3 - 2 sqrt(2). Let me check:

(3 - 2 sqrt(2))^2 = 9 - 12 sqrt(2) + 8 = 17 - 12 sqrt(2). Yes, exactly.

Therefore, sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)) = 3 - 2 sqrt(2). So, that suggests that x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2).

But according to the double angle approach, I had x = sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 0.162, which is different.

Wait, perhaps when I solved for t earlier, I had t = -3 ± sqrt(10). So, t = sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 0.162.

But that's not equal to 3 - 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 0.172.

So, which one is correct? Maybe both are correct, but when plugging in, due to the periodicity, both are solutions.

Wait, but in reality, theta is in the range where tan(theta) is positive, so theta is in (0, π/2), so phi = sin^{-1}(1/3) is in (0, π/2), so phi/2 is in (0, π/4), so tan(phi/2) is positive, so x is positive. So, x must be positive, so both solutions 3 + 2 sqrt(2) and 3 - 2 sqrt(2) are positive, but 3 - 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 0.172 is the correct one, as 3 + 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 5.828.

Wait, but when I computed x = sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 0.162, and plugging into the original equation, sin(2 theta) ≈ 0.313, which is not 1/3. So, this suggests that x = sqrt(10) - 3 is not a solution.

Wait, but according to the quadratic equation, it's a solution. So, perhaps my mistake is in the substitution.

Wait, when I set theta = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3), and then computed x = tan(theta), I used the identity tan(theta/2) = sin(theta)/(1 + cos(theta)), which is correct. Then, by solving, I got x = sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)) = 3 - 2 sqrt(2). Therefore, x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2) is a solution.

Therefore, perhaps my double angle approach was wrong because I confused the double angle for tan(phi) where phi = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3), but that is not the same as theta = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3).

Wait, no, theta = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3), so x = tan(theta) = tan(phi/2) where phi = sin^{-1}(1/3). Therefore, using the identity, x = sqrt( (3 - 2 sqrt(2))/(3 + 2 sqrt(2)) ). Which simplifies to sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)) = 3 - 2 sqrt(2). Therefore, x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2) is the solution.

Therefore, the previous approach using double angle was flawed because I treated x as tan(phi/2), where phi = sin^{-1}(1/3), but actually, the correct x is tan(phi/2) where phi = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3). So, I think the correct value is x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2).

But then, why did I get x = sqrt(10) - 3 from the quadratic equation? Because when I set k = 3 - 2 sqrt(2), then 2k/(1 + k^2) = 1/3. So, sin(2 theta) = 1/3 is satisfied. Therefore, x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2) is a solution.

But when I use tan(phi/2) where phi = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3), I get x = sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)) = 3 - 2 sqrt(2). So, it's consistent.

But when I computed x = sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 0.162, and plugged it into the original equation, I got sin(2 theta) ≈ 0.313, which is not 1/3. Therefore, this suggests that x = sqrt(10) - 3 is not a solution, which contradicts the earlier algebra.

Wait, perhaps my initial substitution was wrong because I set theta = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3), but in reality, theta is (1/2) phi, where phi = sin^{-1}(1/3). So, no, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a computational mistake in the double angle formula.

Let me compute 2 theta:

theta = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3).

So, 2 theta = sin^{-1}(1/3).

Therefore, sin(2 theta) = 1/3.

Therefore, if I compute sin(theta) and cos(theta), and then compute sin(2 theta) = 2 sin theta cos theta, I should get 1/3.

Let me compute sin(theta) and cos(theta) where theta = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3).

Let me denote phi = sin^{-1}(1/3), so theta = phi/2.

Therefore, sin(phi) = 1/3, cos(phi) = sqrt(8/9) = 2 sqrt(2)/3.

Therefore, sin(theta) = sin(phi/2) = sqrt( (1 - cos(phi))/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - 2 sqrt(2)/3 ) / 2 ) = sqrt( (3 - 2 sqrt(2))/6 ).

Similarly, cos(theta) = cos(phi/2) = sqrt( (1 + cos(phi))/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + 2 sqrt(2)/3 ) / 2 ) = sqrt( (3 + 2 sqrt(2))/6 ).

Therefore, sin(2 theta) = 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) = 2 * sqrt( (3 - 2 sqrt(2))/6 ) * sqrt( (3 + 2 sqrt(2))/6 ) = 2 sqrt( (9 - 8)/36 ) = 2 * sqrt(1/36) = 2 * (1/6) = 1/3.

Therefore, sin(2 theta) = 1/3, which is correct.

Therefore, x = tan(theta) = [sqrt( (3 - 2 sqrt(2))/6 )] / [sqrt( (3 + 2 sqrt(2))/6 )] = sqrt( (3 - 2 sqrt(2))/(3 + 2 sqrt(2)) ) = sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)).

But sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)) can be simplified as 3 - 2 sqrt(2), as I showed earlier.

Therefore, x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2).

Therefore, my earlier mistake was in the substitution, but the algebra is correct.

Thus, the solutions are x = 3 + 2 sqrt(2) and x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2).

But when I plug x = sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 0.162 into the original equation, I got sin(2 theta) ≈ 0.313, which is close to 1/3, but not exactly.

But why is that? Is there a calculation error?

Wait, let's compute tan(theta) where theta = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3).

Compute sin^{-1}(1/3) ≈ 0.3398 radians.

Therefore, theta ≈ 0.1699 radians.

Compute tan(theta) ≈ 0.173, which is approximately 3 - 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 3 - 2.828 ≈ 0.172.

But sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 0.162 is different. So, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the identity. Let me re-examine.

We have theta = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3), so 2 theta = sin^{-1}(1/3).

Therefore, sin(2 theta) = 1/3.

Therefore, sin(theta) = sin(phi/2) where phi = sin^{-1}(1/3), which is 1/3.

But theta = phi/2, so tan(theta) = tan(phi/2).

Using the identity:

tan(phi/2) = sin(phi)/(1 + cos(phi)).

Which is:

= (1/3) / (1 + sqrt(1 - (1/3)^2 )) = (1/3) / (1 + sqrt(8/9)) = (1/3) / (1 + 2 sqrt(2)/3) = (1/3) / ( (3 + 2 sqrt(2))/3 ) = 1 / (3 + 2 sqrt(2)).

Rationalizing:

1 / (3 + 2 sqrt(2)) * (3 - 2 sqrt(2))/(3 - 2 sqrt(2)) = (3 - 2 sqrt(2))/(9 - 8) = 3 - 2 sqrt(2).

Therefore, tan(theta) = 3 - 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 0.172, which is correct.

Thus, x = tan(theta) = 3 - 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 0.172 is the solution.

Therefore, the earlier approach where I set x = sqrt(10) - 3 was incorrect because it didn't consider that theta = (1/2) sin^{-1}(1/3), not just sqrt(10) - 3.

Therefore, the correct solutions are x = 3 + 2 sqrt(2) and x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2).

But when I plug x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2) into the original equation, I get sin(2 theta) = 1/3, which is correct.

When I plug x = sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 0.162 into the original equation, I get sin(2 theta) ≈ 0.313, which is not exactly 1/3, but close. But actually, 3 - 2 sqrt(2) is exactly equal to sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)) ≈ 0.173. So, perhaps my calculator is off.

Wait, let me compute 3 - 2 sqrt(2):

sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142, so 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 2.8284.

Therefore, 3 - 2.8284 ≈ 0.1716.

But sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)):

Compute 12 sqrt(2) ≈ 16.9706.

17 - 16.9706 ≈ 0.0294.

sqrt(0.0294) ≈ 0.1715.

Which is approximately 0.1716, which is the same as 3 - 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 0.1716.

So, my earlier confusion was due to an incorrect calculation of sqrt(17 - 12 sqrt(2)). It is equal to 3 - 2 sqrt(2), which is approximately 0.1716.

Therefore, x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2) is the exact solution.

Therefore, the solutions are x = 3 + 2 sqrt(2) and x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2).

But wait, when I plug x = sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 0.162 into the original equation, I get sin(2 theta) ≈ 0.313, which is not exactly 1/3. So, it's incorrect.

Therefore, only x = 3 + 2 sqrt(2) and x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2) are valid solutions.

Wait, but let me check with x = sqrt(10) - 3.

Wait, sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623, so sqrt(10) - 3 ≈ 0.1623. Then, A = tan^{-1}(0.1623) ≈ 0.1623 radians.

B = cot^{-1}(1/0.1623) ≈ cot^{-1}(6.164) ≈ π - 1.427 ≈ 1.714 radians.

Therefore, A + B ≈ 0.1623 + 1.714 ≈ 1.876 radians.

Compute sin(1.876). 1.876 radians is approximately 107 degrees.

sin(107 degrees) ≈ 0.956, which is not 1/3. Therefore, this is not a solution.

Therefore, only x = 3 + 2 sqrt(2) and x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2) are solutions.

Therefore, the solutions are x = 3 + 2 sqrt(2) and x = 3 - 2 sqrt(2).

Therefore, the final answer is x = 3 ± 2 sqrt(2).

**Final Answer**
The solutions are \boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}} and \boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}.

To find all solutions to the equation:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

we start by using the identity for the sum of arctangent and arccotangent functions. We know that:

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}
\]

for any \( x \neq 0 \). However, we need to consider the periodicity and the quadrant where \( x \) lies.

Let \( A = \tan^{-1}(x) \) and \( B = \cot^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \). Then, we have:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Since \( A + B = \frac{\pi}{2} \) for \( x > 0 \), we get:

\[
\sin\left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1 \neq \frac{1}{3}
\]

For \( x < 0 \), we need to consider the periodicity and the fact that \( A + B \) can be in a different interval. We use the identity:

\[
\sin(2 \theta) = \frac{2 \tan(\theta)}{1 + \tan^2(\theta)}
\]

where \( \theta = \tan^{-1}(x) \). Let \( \theta = \tan^{-1}(x) \), then:

\[
\sin(2 \theta) = \frac{2x}{1 + x^2}
\]

We set this equal to \( \frac{1}{3} \):

\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
6x = 1 + x^2 \implies x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]

Thus, the solutions are \( x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \) and \( x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2} \).

Verifying these solutions, we find that both satisfy the original equation. Therefore, the solutions are:

\[
\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}
\]
