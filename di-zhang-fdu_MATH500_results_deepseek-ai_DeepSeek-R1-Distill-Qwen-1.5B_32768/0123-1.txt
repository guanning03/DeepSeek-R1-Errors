Question:
Let $ABCD$ be a regular tetrahedron with side length 2. The plane parallel to edges $AB$ and $CD$ and lying halfway between them cuts $ABCD$ into two pieces. Find the surface area of one of these pieces.

Correct Answer:
The plane intersects each face of the tetrahedron in a midline of the face; by symmetry it follows that the intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron is a square of side length 1. The surface area of each piece is half the total surface area of the tetrahedron plus the area of the square, that is, $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 4\cdot \frac{2^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}+1=\boxed{1+2\sqrt{3}}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I've got this problem here involving a regular tetrahedron, which is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each one an equilateral triangle. The side length is 2 units. The question is about cutting this tetrahedron with a plane that's parallel to edges AB and CD and lies halfway between them. This cut divides the tetrahedron into two pieces, and I need to find the surface area of one of these pieces.

First, let me visualize a regular tetrahedron. Since all edges are equal, each edge is 2 units long. Now, edges AB and CD are skew lines in the tetrahedron, meaning they don't intersect and aren't parallel. So, the plane we're talking about is parallel to both AB and CD but in the middle of them. Since the plane is halfway between AB and CD, it must be cutting the tetrahedron at a height that's exactly halfway from AB to CD.

I remember that in a regular tetrahedron, all the faces are equilateral triangles, and all the edges are equal. So, the height from any vertex to the opposite face can be calculated. Maybe I can use that to figure out where the plane is cutting.

Hold on, maybe I should recall the formula for the height of a regular tetrahedron. The height (which is the perpendicular distance from a vertex to the opposite face) can be found using the formula:

Height = √(2/3) * edge length.

So, with edge length 2, the height is √(2/3)*2, which simplifies to 2√(2/3). Let me compute that:

√(2/3) is approximately 0.816, so 2*0.816 is about 1.632. But maybe it's better to keep it in exact terms: 2√(2)/√(3) = 2√6 / 3. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let's compute it step by step.

√(2/3) is equal to √6 / 3 because √(2/3) = √2 / √3 = (√2 * √3) / (√3 * √3) = √6 / 3. So, the height is 2*(√6)/3, which is (2√6)/3.

So, the total height of the tetrahedron is (2√6)/3.

Since the plane is cutting the tetrahedron halfway between AB and CD, that means it's cutting at half the height from AB and also from CD. So, the distance from the plane to each of these edges is half of (2√6)/3, which is (√6)/3.

Okay, so the plane is (√6)/3 units away from both AB and CD.

Now, I need to understand the shape that results from this cut. Since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, the intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron will create a quadrilateral. But wait, in a regular tetrahedron, all faces are triangles, so cutting with a plane can create a triangle or a quadrilateral?

Wait, no, in a tetrahedron, any plane that cuts through four edges will create a quadrilateral, but in this case, since the plane is parallel to two edges, AB and CD, which are themselves skew, the intersection will form a parallelogram. Hmm, maybe. Let me think.

Actually, in a regular tetrahedron, all the edges are symmetric, so if you have a plane cutting through four edges, and the plane is parallel to two of them, it's possible that the intersection is a parallelogram.

Wait, but in this case, the plane is cutting through the tetrahedron, and it's halfway between AB and CD. So, it must be cutting through other edges as well.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron and compute the intersection.

Since it's a regular tetrahedron, it's symmetric, so I can place it in a coordinate system in such a way that the calculations are easier.

Let me recall that a regular tetrahedron can be embedded in 3D space with vertices at (1,1,1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1), and (1,-1,-1), scaled appropriately so that the edge lengths are 2.

Wait, let me verify that. The distance between (1,1,1) and (-1,-1,1) is √[(-2)^2 + (-2)^2 + 0^2] = √(4 + 4) = √8 = 2√2. But in our case, edge length is 2, so maybe I need to scale those coordinates down.

Alternatively, maybe using a different coordinate system where the base is on the xy-plane, and the apex is along the z-axis.

Let me think: Let me place vertex A at (0,0,0), vertex B at (2,0,0), vertex C somewhere in the xy-plane, and vertex D somewhere above.

Wait, but to find coordinates for a regular tetrahedron, perhaps I can use known coordinates.

Wait, I remember that one possible coordinate system for a regular tetrahedron is:

A = (1,1,1)

B = (1,-1,-1)

C = (-1,1,-1)

D = (-1,-1,1)

But let me compute the distances between these points to confirm.

Distance between A and B: √[(1-1)^2 + (1 - (-1))^2 + (1 - (-1))^2] = √[0 + 4 + 4] = √8 = 2√2.

Hmm, but we want edge length 2, so maybe I need to scale these coordinates down by a factor of √2.

Wait, if I scale each coordinate by 1/√2, then the distances will become 2.

So, adjusted coordinates:

A = (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2)

B = (1/√2, -1/√2, -1/√2)

C = (-1/√2, 1/√2, -1/√2)

D = (-1/√2, -1/√2, 1/√2)

Let me verify the distance between A and B:

√[(1/√2 - 1/√2)^2 + (1/√2 - (-1/√2))^2 + (1/√2 - (-1/√2))^2]

Simplify:

√[0 + (2/√2)^2 + (2/√2)^2] = √[0 + (2√2)^2 + (2√2)^2] Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, (1/√2 - (-1/√2)) is (2/√2) which is √2. So, squared is 2.

Similarly, the same for the y and z components. So, distance AB is √[0 + 2 + 2] = √4 = 2. Perfect.

So, this coordinate system works with edge length 2.

So, let's assign coordinates:

A: (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2)

B: (1/√2, -1/√2, -1/√2)

C: (-1/√2, 1/√2, -1/√2)

D: (-1/√2, -1/√2, 1/√2)

Okay, so edges AB and CD.

First, let me find the coordinates of edges AB and CD.

Edge AB is from A to B.

A: (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2)

B: (1/√2, -1/√2, -1/√2)

Similarly, edge CD is from C to D.

C: (-1/√2, 1/√2, -1/√2)

D: (-1/√2, -1/√2, 1/√2)

So, AB is from (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2) to (1/√2, -1/√2, -1/√2)

Similarly, CD is from (-1/√2, 1/√2, -1/√2) to (-1/√2, -1/√2, 1/√2)

Now, the plane is parallel to both AB and CD and lies halfway between them.

Wait, so to find the equation of this plane, I need to find a plane that's parallel to both AB and CD and located midway between them.

But since AB and CD are skew lines, the plane must be parallel to both but not necessarily parallel to the lines themselves.

Alternatively, since the plane is parallel to both AB and CD, it must be parallel to the direction vectors of AB and CD.

So, perhaps I can find the direction vectors of AB and CD, and then define the plane accordingly.

First, let's compute the direction vector of AB.

Vector AB = B - A = (1/√2 - 1/√2, -1/√2 - 1/√2, -1/√2 - 1/√2) = (0, -2/√2, -2/√2) = (0, -√2, -√2)

Similarly, direction vector of CD.

Vector CD = D - C = (-1/√2 - (-1/√2), -1/√2 - 1/√2, 1/√2 - (-1/√2)) = (0, -2/√2, 2/√2) = (0, -√2, √2)

So, direction vectors are:

AB: (0, -√2, -√2)

CD: (0, -√2, √2)

So, the plane is parallel to both these vectors.

Wait, but a plane can't be parallel to two different directions unless those directions are in the plane's own direction.

Wait, no, actually, the plane's normal vector is perpendicular to both direction vectors.

So, to find the normal vector of the plane, I can take the cross product of vectors AB and CD.

Let me compute that.

Vector AB: (0, -√2, -√2)

Vector CD: (0, -√2, √2)

Cross product AB × CD is determinant:

|i    j     k|
|0  -√2  -√2|
|0  -√2   √2|

Calculates to:

i * [(-√2)(√2) - (-√2)(-√2)] - j * [0*√2 - 0*(-√2)] + k * [0*(-√2) - 0*(-√2)]

Simplify:

i * [(-√2 * √2) - (√2 * √2)] - j * [0 - 0] + k * [0 - 0]

Compute the i component:

(-√2 * √2) = -2

(-√2 * -√2) = +2

So, -2 - 2 = -4

So, i component is -4i

j component: the determinant with a negative sign, which is - [0 - 0] = 0

k component: 0 - 0 = 0

Thus, AB × CD = (-4, 0, 0)

So, the normal vector of the plane is (-4, 0, 0), which simplifies to (-1, 0, 0). So, the plane is parallel to the x-axis.

But wait, is that correct? Because both AB and CD have the same x-component for their direction vectors, so the direction vectors are along the y-z plane, and their cross product is along the x-axis, meaning the plane is parallel to the x-axis.

So, the plane is parallel to the x-axis and is somewhere in the middle between AB and CD.

Now, the distance between the lines AB and CD is needed to find the position of the plane.

Wait, the distance between two skew lines can be found using the formula:

Distance = |(b - a) ⋅ (n)| / |n|

Where n is the cross product of their direction vectors, and a and b are points on each line.

Wait, but in our case, the plane is halfway between AB and CD, so perhaps the distance from each line to the plane is equal.

So, let me compute the distance between AB and CD.

Take a point on AB, say A: (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2)

And a point on CD, say C: (-1/√2, 1/√2, -1/√2)

Wait, but actually, to compute the distance between the lines AB and CD, we can use the formula:

Distance = |(C - A) ⋅ (AB × CD)| / |AB × CD|

Where C - A is the vector connecting points A and C.

So, vector AC = C - A = (-1/√2 - 1/√2, 1/√2 - 1/√2, -1/√2 - 1/√2) = (-2/√2, 0, -2/√2) = (-√2, 0, -√2)

Then, the cross product AB × CD is (-4, 0, 0)

So, the dot product (AC) ⋅ (AB × CD) = (-√2)(-4) + (0)(0) + (-√2)(0) = 4√2 + 0 + 0 = 4√2

The magnitude of AB × CD is |(-4, 0, 0)| = 4

Thus, distance between AB and CD is |4√2| / 4 = √2

So, the distance between AB and CD is √2. Therefore, the plane is halfway between them, so the distance from each line to the plane is √2 / 2 = (√2)/2.

Therefore, the plane is located at a distance of (√2)/2 from both AB and CD.

So, now, to find the equation of the plane.

We know the normal vector is (-1, 0, 0). So, the plane equation is:

-1(x - x0) + 0(y - y0) + 0(z - z0) = 0

But to find x0, y0, z0, we can use the fact that the plane is at a distance (√2)/2 from both AB and CD.

Alternatively, since the plane is parallel to the x-axis, and the distance from AB and CD is √2 / 2, we can find the plane by moving along the x-axis by that distance.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to parametrize the plane.

Given that the plane is parallel to the x-axis, its equation can be written as x = k, where k is some constant.

Wait, but if it's parallel to the x-axis, then yes, x would be constant.

But let's see, the plane is halfway between AB and CD, so we can compute k such that the distance from AB to the plane is (√2)/2.

But wait, the distance between the lines AB and CD is √2, so half way is √2 / 2.

So, the plane is at x = midpoint between the x-coordinates of AB and CD.

Wait, hold on, actually, in our coordinate system, AB goes from (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2) to (1/√2, -1/√2, -1/√2). So, the x-coordinate of both AB and CD lines is 1/√2.

Similarly, point C is (-1/√2, 1/√2, -1/√2), so the x-coordinate is -1/√2.

Wait, so the lines AB and CD are both at x = 1/√2 and x = -1/√2. So, the distance between them is 2/√2 = √2, which matches our previous computation.

Therefore, the plane is halfway between x = 1/√2 and x = -1/√2, which is at x = 0.

So, the plane equation is x = 0.

Therefore, the plane is the y-z plane passing through the origin.

So, now, we can figure out where the plane x=0 intersects the tetrahedron.

The tetrahedron has four faces:

1. Face ABC
2. Face ABD
3. Face ACD
4. Face BCD

Wait, but actually, in our coordinate system, the base is face BCD, and the apex is A.

Wait, no, actually, hold on, let me clarify the faces.

Wait, in our coordinate system, the tetrahedron is defined with vertices A, B, C, D.

Looking back:

A: (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2)

B: (1/√2, -1/√2, -1/√2)

C: (-1/√2, 1/√2, -1/√2)

D: (-1/√2, -1/√2, 1/√2)

So, the four faces are:

1. Face ABC: connects A, B, C

2. Face ABD: connects A, B, D

3. Face ACD: connects A, C, D

4. Face BCD: connects B, C, D

So, the plane x=0 intersects the tetrahedron.

We need to find which edges are intersected by this plane.

Looking at each edge:

Edge AB: from (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2) to (1/√2, -1/√2, -1/√2). The midpoint of AB is (1/√2, 0, 0). So, the plane x=0 does not intersect AB.

Edge AC: from (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2) to (-1/√2, 1/√2, -1/√2). The midpoint is (0, 1/√2, 0). So, the plane x=0 intersects AC at (0, 1/√2, 0).

Edge AD: from (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2) to (-1/√2, -1/√2, 1/√2). The midpoint is (0, 0, 1/√2). So, the plane x=0 intersects AD at (0, 0, 1/√2).

Edge BC: from (1/√2, -1/√2, -1/√2) to (-1/√2, 1/√2, -1/√2). The midpoint is (0, 0, -1/√2). So, the plane x=0 intersects BC at (0, 0, -1/√2).

Edge BD: from (1/√2, -1/√2, -1/√2) to (-1/√2, -1/√2, 1/√2). The midpoint is (0, -1/√2, 0). So, the plane x=0 intersects BD at (0, -1/√2, 0).

Edge CD: from (-1/√2, 1/√2, -1/√2) to (-1/√2, -1/√2, 1/√2). The midpoint is (-1/√2, 0, 0). So, the plane x=0 does not intersect CD.

Therefore, the plane x=0 intersects the tetrahedron along four edges: AC, AD, BC, and BD.

Thus, the intersection is a quadrilateral connecting points:

- Intersection on AC: (0, 1/√2, 0)

- Intersection on AD: (0, 0, 1/√2)

- Intersection on BC: (0, 0, -1/√2)

- Intersection on BD: (0, -1/√2, 0)

So, the four points are (0, 1/√2, 0), (0, 0, 1/√2), (0, 0, -1/√2), and (0, -1/√2, 0).

Wait, but these four points form a square in the y-z plane. Because each point has x=0, and the y and z coordinates vary between ±1/√2.

So, connecting (0, 1/√2, 0) to (0, 0, 1/√2), then to (0, 0, -1/√2), then to (0, -1/√2, 0), and back to (0, 1/√2, 0). So, it's a square in the y-z plane with side length √[(1/√2)^2 + (1/√2)^2] = √(1/2 + 1/2) = √1 = 1.

Wait, is that right? Because the distance between (1/√2, 0, 0) and (0, 1/√2, 0) is √[(1/√2)^2 + (1/√2)^2] = √(1/2 + 1/2) = 1. So, yes, each side is 1 unit in the y-z plane.

But wait, actually, the side length is the distance between two adjacent intersection points. For example, from (0, 1/√2, 0) to (0, 0, 1/√2) is √[(0)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (1/√2)^2] = √[0 + 1/2 + 1/2] = √1 = 1.

So, the intersection is a square with side length 1, lying in the y-z plane at x=0.

Therefore, the piece we're supposed to find is that square, but actually, no. Wait, the plane cuts off a portion of the tetrahedron, which is a polyhedron with five faces: the square face and four triangular faces.

Wait, no, actually, the intersection is a quadrilateral, so the resulting piece is a four-sided figure, but since it's a plane cutting through four edges, it's a four-faced polyhedron, so a tetrahedron.

Wait, no, hold on. The original tetrahedron has four triangular faces. When we cut it with a plane, the resulting piece will have the intersection as a quadrilateral, and the other face will be a triangle.

Wait, let me think: the original tetrahedron has four triangular faces. When we cut it with a plane, the intersection is a quadrilateral, so the resulting piece will have the quadrilateral as one face, and the rest of the original faces, but only part of them.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a new polyhedron with five faces: the quadrilateral intersection and the three original faces.

Wait, no, actually, in a tetrahedron, cutting with a plane can only create a new face which is the intersection polygon, which in this case is a quadrilateral. The original three faces are still present, but only parts of them.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the resulting piece as a four-sided pyramid or something else.

Wait, no, actually, in this case, the plane cuts through four edges, so the resulting piece is a four-faced polyhedron, specifically a quadrilateral-based pyramid.

Wait, but in a regular tetrahedron, everything is symmetric, so the resulting piece is a regular quadrilateral-based pyramid.

Wait, but a regular pyramid would have a regular base and triangular sides, but in this case, the base is a square. So, it's a square-based pyramid.

Wait, but in a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal, but cutting it with a plane that is parallel to two edges might not produce a square base.

Wait, but in our coordinate system, the intersection is indeed a square, as we saw, with points at (0, 1/√2, 0), (0, 0, 1/√2), (0, 0, -1/√2), and (0, -1/√2, 0). So, that square lies in the y-z plane, centered at the origin, with sides of length 1.

So, the resulting piece is a square-based pyramid with a square base and four triangular faces.

Wait, but in reality, the base is a square, and each triangular face is a triangle connecting the apex (which is point A or D) to the base.

Wait, actually, in this case, the apex is not a single point, but the cutting plane intersects the tetrahedron in a square, so perhaps the resulting piece is a square bipyramid, but no, wait.

Wait, maybe not. Actually, the portion that's cut off is a square pyramid, and the remaining part is a frustum-like shape, but since it's a tetrahedron, it's just a smaller tetrahedron and the frustum-like shape.

Wait, no, in reality, the plane cuts through four edges, creating a quadrilateral face and splitting the original tetrahedron into two parts: one is a smaller tetrahedron and the other is a frustum.

Wait, no, actually, in a tetrahedron, cutting with a plane can result in two polyhedrons, each with a face that is the intersection polygon. So, in this case, the intersection is a square, so one piece is a square pyramid, and the other is a more complex polyhedron.

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute the surface area directly.

Wait, the problem says "the surface area of one of these pieces." So, depending on which piece we take, the surface area could be different.

Wait, perhaps the piece that includes the original vertices A and D, or the other.

Wait, in our coordinate system, the original vertices are A, B, C, D.

The plane cuts through AC, AD, BC, and BD.

So, the two pieces would be:

1. The piece containing vertices A, D, (0,1/√2,0), (0,0,1/√2), (0,0,-1/√2), and (0,-1/√2,0). Wait, no, actually, the intersection is a square, so the piece would consist of the four triangular faces connecting the square to the original vertices.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the two pieces as follows:

- One piece is the set of points on one side of the plane x=0.

- The other piece is the set of points on the other side of the plane x=0.

Given that, the piece containing A and D would include the square face (the intersection) and the original faces that are on the same side as A and D.

Wait, but A and D are on the positive and negative sides of the y-z plane, respectively. Since the plane x=0 is the y-z plane, so A is at (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2), which is in the positive x, positive y, positive z side, and D is at (-1/√2, -1/√2, 1/√2), which is in the negative x, negative y, positive z side.

So, the piece containing A and D would include the square face on the y-z plane and the two triangular faces connecting to A and D.

Wait, actually, no. The plane x=0 cuts through four edges, so the piece containing A and D would be bounded by the square face and the two triangular faces connecting A to the square and D to the square.

Similarly, the other piece would contain the square face and the other two triangular faces.

Wait, but in our case, the plane x=0 cuts through the tetrahedron, so the two pieces are:

1. One piece is a square pyramid with base the square intersection and apex at A.

2. The other piece is the remaining part of the tetrahedron, which is a smaller tetrahedron with base as the square intersection and apex at D.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, actually, if you have a plane cutting through a tetrahedron, the two resulting pieces are not pyramids with apex at A or D, but rather, each piece has a base which is the intersection polygon and the other faces which are parts of the original tetrahedron.

But in our case, the intersection is a square, so each piece is a square-based polyhedron.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the two pieces:

1. The piece containing vertex A: It includes the square face and the two triangular faces connecting A to the square. So, it's a square pyramid.

2. The piece containing vertex D: It includes the square face and the two triangular faces connecting D to the square. So, it's another square pyramid.

But wait, in a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal, so maybe these two pyramids are congruent.

But in reality, vertex A and vertex D are not symmetric with respect to the y-z plane because one is above and one is below. So, their resulting pieces may not be congruent.

Wait, but in our case, the plane is x=0, which is symmetric with respect to the y and z axes. So, maybe the two pieces are congruent.

Wait, but in the coordinate system, the tetrahedron is symmetric, so cutting it with a plane through the y-z plane should result in two congruent pieces.

Therefore, each piece is a square pyramid, with base area equal to the area of the square, and lateral faces equal.

Wait, but the problem says "the surface area of one of these pieces." So, maybe I need to compute the surface area.

Each piece is a square pyramid, so its surface area is the area of the square base plus the areas of the four triangular faces.

But wait, in reality, the square is internal, so when we cut the tetrahedron, the two pieces will have the square as one face and the three original triangular faces for one piece, and the other triangular faces for the other piece.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, each original face of the tetrahedron is a triangle. When we cut the tetrahedron with plane x=0, each original triangular face is divided into smaller polygons.

So, for the piece containing A, it will have:

- The square face from the intersection.

- The three triangular faces that connect to A: but wait, A is connected to B, C, D, so of those, only AC, AD, and AB are intersected, so the piece will have triangular faces:

- Triangle A-C-(0,1/√2,0)

- Triangle A-D-(0,0,1/√2)

- Triangle A-B-(0,0,-1/√2)

Similarly, the other piece will have:

- The square face.

- The three triangular faces connecting to D: Triangle D-B-(0,1/√2,0), D-C-(0,0,-1/√2), D-A-(0,-1/√2,0)

Wait, but in reality, each original triangular face is split by the cutting plane.

So, for each original face, we get a smaller triangle and a quadrilateral.

Wait, for example, face ABD is a triangle with vertices A, B, D. The cutting plane intersects edges AB and AD at points (0,1/√2,0) and (0,0,1/√2). So, the intersection with face ABD is a smaller triangle with vertices (0,1/√2,0), (0,0,1/√2), and a point on edge BD.

Wait, actually, no. Since the cutting plane intersects edges AB at (0,1/√2,0) and edge AD at (0,0,1/√2), the intersection within face ABD is a triangle with vertices (0,1/√2,0), (0,0,1/√2), and the intersection point on edge BD.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the plane x=0 intersects edges AC, AD, BC, and BD. So, on edge BD, which goes from (1/√2, -1/√2, -1/√2) to (-1/√2, -1/√2, 1/√2), the intersection is at (0, -1/√2, 0).

So, on face ABD, the intersection points are (0,1/√2,0) on AB, (0,0,1/√2) on AD, and (0, -1/√2,0) on BD.

So, the intersection within face ABD is a triangle with vertices (0,1/√2,0), (0,0,1/√2), and (0, -1/√2,0). So, that's a triangle.

Similarly, on face ACD, the plane intersects edges AC and AD at (0,1/√2,0) and (0,0,1/√2), and edge CD is not intersected.

Wait, no, in face ACD, edges AC and AD are intersected, while edge CD is not.

Similarly, on face ABC, edges AC and AB are intersected.

Wait, so each original face is divided into a smaller triangle and a quadrilateral.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me recast this.

Each original triangular face is being intersected by the plane in a line, but each triangular face only has three edges, so the intersection with the plane can only be a line segment, but in our case, the plane intersects two edges per face.

Wait, for face ABD: edges AB and AD are intersected, so the intersection is a line segment from (0,1/√2,0) to (0,0,1/√2). Similarly, in face ABC: edges AB and AC are intersected, so intersection is a line segment from (0,1/√2,0) to (0,0,1/√2). Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the plane intersects AC at (0,1/√2,0) and AD at (0,0,1/√2). Wait, but in face ABC, edge AC is being intersected at (0,1/√2,0), and edge AB at (0,1/√2,0). Wait, no, actually, in face ABC, edge AB is between A and B, which is in the positive x direction, so the plane x=0 does not intersect AB. But in face ABD, edge AB is intersected at (0,1/√2,0). Similarly, face ACD, edge AC is intersected at (0,1/√2,0) and edge AD is intersected at (0,0,1/√2). Wait, no, in face ACD, edge AC is intersected at (0,1/√2,0) and edge AD is intersected at (0,0,1/√2). So, the intersection within face ACD is a triangle with vertices (0,1/√2,0), (0,0,1/√2), and another point on edge CD, but edge CD is not intersected. Wait, no, in face ACD, edge CD is not intersected, so the intersection is only along the edges AC and AD.

Wait, maybe each original face is being split into a triangle and a quadrilateral? No, in reality, each face is intersected by the plane along a line, but since the plane cuts through two edges per face, it's actually creating a quadrilateral.

Wait, no, a plane cutting through a convex polyhedron can only intersect each face along a line segment, so for each face, we have a line segment on it.

Wait, but in our case, each original face is intersected by the plane along a line segment, so each face is split into two parts: a quadrilateral and a triangle.

Wait, perhaps, but it's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the surface area directly by figuring out the areas of the faces of the resulting piece.

Since the piece is a square pyramid with a square base of side length √2 (since the intersection is a square with side length 1 in the y-z plane, but scaled by the scaling factor).

Wait, actually, in the coordinate system, the square is centered at the origin, with sides parallel to the y and z axes, each side length 1, going from -1/√2 to 1/√2 in both y and z.

So, the area of the square base is (1)^2 = 1.

Now, each triangular face of the square pyramid has a base of length 1 and a height that we need to compute.

Wait, but in reality, the triangular faces are not just any triangles, they are isosceles triangles with a base of 1 and two other sides.

Wait, actually, in the square pyramid, the lateral faces are triangles with a base of 1 and two equal sides.

Wait, let me think about the apex of the pyramid. The apex is point A, which is at (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2). The base is the square in the y-z plane.

So, the apex is above the center of the square, which is at (0,0,0). So, the distance from the apex to each base vertex can be computed.

For example, the distance from A to (0,1/√2,0) is sqrt[(1/√2 - 0)^2 + (1/√2 - 1/√2)^2 + (1/√2 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(1/2) + 0 + (1/2)] = sqrt(1) = 1.

Similarly, the distance from A to (0,0,1/√2) is also 1.

So, each triangular face is an isosceles triangle with base length 1 and two equal sides of length 1.

Therefore, each triangular face is an equilateral triangle with sides of length 1.

Therefore, the area of each triangular face is (sqrt(3)/4) * (1)^2 = sqrt(3)/4.

Since there are four triangular faces, the total lateral surface area is 4*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3).

Adding the base area of the square, which is 1, the total surface area is 1 + sqrt(3).

But wait, wait, hold on. The problem is about the surface area of one of these pieces. If the surface area includes both the base and the sides, then it's 1 + sqrt(3). However, in reality, the base is internal, so depending on which piece we're considering, the surface area might not include it.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's asking for the surface area of one of these pieces. So, if it's the smaller piece, it's the square pyramid with base area 1 and lateral faces each of area sqrt(3)/4, so total surface area is 1 + sqrt(3). If it's the larger piece, it's the remaining part, which would have a larger surface area.

Wait, but in reality, when you cut the tetrahedron with a plane, the resulting two pieces are both polyhedrons, each with the same surface area.

Wait, no, not necessarily. Wait, the original tetrahedron has four triangular faces, each of area sqrt(3)/4, so total surface area is 4*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3).

After cutting, one piece has a square base (area 1) and four triangular faces (each area sqrt(3)/4), total surface area 1 + sqrt(3).

The other piece would have the four original triangular faces minus the areas covered by the intersecting parts.

Wait, but in reality, each piece would have the square base (if any) and the triangular faces.

Wait, actually, in the case of the square pyramid, the base is internal, so its surface area is only the four triangular faces.

Wait, but the problem says "surface area of one of these pieces." Depending on whether it's the smaller or larger piece, the surface area would be different.

But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe we need to compute both and see which one is intended.

Wait, but in the way the problem is phrased, it says "one of these pieces," so perhaps it's referring to one, not both, but maybe either is acceptable.

Wait, but let's think again: when you cut a tetrahedron with a plane, the two resulting pieces are both polyhedrons, each with a square base (for the smaller piece) and four triangular faces (for the larger piece). So, which one is larger? The smaller piece is the square pyramid, and the larger piece is the remaining part.

But in reality, the larger piece is a polyhedron with a square base and four triangular faces, but the base is actually not part of the original surface.

Wait, no, the larger piece doesn't have a square base, as the base is internal.

Wait, no, in the cutting, the plane divides the original tetrahedron into two parts. Each part is a polyhedron with one face being the original face of the tetrahedron, but also including the new face created by the plane.

Wait, perhaps the larger piece is a pentahedron with five faces: the three original faces of the tetrahedron that aren't intersected, plus the two new triangular faces created by the intersection.

Wait, actually, no. Let me think:

Each original face is a triangle. When the plane cuts through it, it creates a new edge and a new face.

So, for each original face, we have a triangle split into a smaller triangle and a quadrilateral.

But the quadrilateral is then split into two triangles by another plane? Wait, no, only one plane is cutting through.

Wait, perhaps each original face is divided into a triangle and a quadrilateral, and the quadrilateral is split into two triangles by the cutting plane.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the surface areas separately.

First, let me compute the surface area of the smaller piece.

If the smaller piece is a square pyramid with base area 1 and four triangular faces each of area sqrt(3)/4, then total surface area is 1 + sqrt(3).

Alternatively, if the larger piece is the remaining part, its surface area would consist of the original three triangular faces minus the areas of the small triangles, plus the new triangular face created by the intersection.

Wait, but the larger piece is a polyhedron with four original triangular faces and four new triangular faces? Wait, no.

Wait, no, each original face is split into a triangle and a quadrilateral by the plane. So, the quadrilateral is split into two triangles by another plane? But we only have one plane cutting through.

Wait, no, in reality, each original face is intersected by the cutting plane in a line segment. So, each original face is split into a triangle and a quadrilateral. But the quadrilateral is part of the larger piece, so the larger piece would have the three original triangular faces and the two new triangular faces from the intersection.

Wait, but each original face is intersected by the plane in a line, so each original face is divided into a smaller triangle and a quadrilateral. So, each original face contributes one triangle to the larger piece.

Wait, no, each original face is split into a triangle and a quadrilateral, but the quadrilateral is in the larger piece, so the larger piece has three original triangular faces and two new triangular faces from the intersection.

Therefore, the surface area of the larger piece is the sum of the three original triangular faces minus the areas of the small triangles plus the two new triangular faces.

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the surface area of the smaller piece, which is the square pyramid with base area 1 and four triangular faces each of area sqrt(3)/4, giving a total surface area of 1 + sqrt(3).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the larger piece, but the question says "one of these pieces," so perhaps it's expecting the surface area of the smaller piece.

But let me check.

Wait, the problem says, "the surface area of one of these pieces." So, either could be possible, but perhaps the smaller one, as it's the piece containing the original vertices A and D.

Wait, but in the coordinate system, the square base is in the middle, so the smaller piece is the square pyramid with base area 1, and the larger piece is the rest.

But which one is intended? The problem doesn't specify, but in the tetrahedron, cutting with a plane parallel to two edges would result in two pieces, each with the same surface area, but one is a square-based pyramid and the other is a more complex polyhedron.

Wait, but in reality, the two pieces have the same surface area.

Wait, no, when you cut a solid, the surface area of the two pieces is equal to the original surface area plus twice the area of the cutting surface. But in this case, the cutting surface is a plane, which has zero area. So, the total surface area of both pieces combined is equal to the original surface area.

But the original surface area is sqrt(3), so each piece would have sqrt(3)/2?

Wait, no, that can't be, because in our coordinate system, the original tetrahedron has four triangular faces, each of area sqrt(3)/4, so total surface area is sqrt(3).

When we cut it, each piece will have some of the original faces and some of the new faces. So, the sum of their surface areas will be sqrt(3). But if we need the surface area of one of the pieces, it's possible that each piece has half of the original surface area plus some of the new faces.

Wait, but no, because the cutting plane doesn't add any new surface area, it just creates internal surfaces.

Wait, actually, the surface area of each piece is equal to the original surface area plus twice the area of the cutting surface. But since the cutting surface is a plane, it has zero area, so each piece's surface area is equal to the original surface area. Wait, but that seems contradictory.

Wait, no, actually, the original surface area is split between the two pieces, but each piece gains the area of the cutting surface. However, since the cutting surface is just a plane, which has zero area, the total surface area of both pieces remains equal to the original surface area. But that can't be, because the original surface area is just the four triangular faces, and when cut, each piece has some of those faces and some new faces.

Wait, perhaps the key is that each piece has the same surface area as the original, but I think that's not correct.

Wait, actually, the original surface area is sqrt(3). When you cut the tetrahedron with the plane, each piece will have some of the original faces and some of the new faces created by the plane. But since the plane is internal, the new faces are internal for both pieces.

Wait, so actually, each piece's surface area is equal to the area of the original faces intersected by the plane plus the area of the new faces created by the plane.

But since the plane is just a straight cut, the area of the new faces is zero, as it's a 1D surface.

Wait, so perhaps the surface area is just the area of the original faces intersected by the plane.

But in reality, each piece will have some of the original faces, but not all.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that each piece will have one of the original faces, and the rest of their faces are the new triangles formed by the intersection.

Wait, but in reality, the intersection is a square, so each piece will have a square base and four triangular faces.

Wait, but in this case, each piece is a square pyramid.

Wait, but in our coordinate system, the smaller piece is a square pyramid with base area 1, and the larger piece is a square pyramid with base area ... Wait, no, the larger piece would have a larger base.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the ratio.

Wait, the cutting plane is at x=0, which is halfway between x=1/√2 and x=-1/√2. So, the distance from the plane to the base of the tetrahedron is half the height.

Since the height of the tetrahedron is sqrt(2)/2, the distance from the plane to A and D is sqrt(2)/4.

Wait, so the square base of the pyramid has side length 1, and the apex is at A, which is at a distance sqrt(2)/2 from the base.

Wait, the height of the pyramid is sqrt(2)/4.

Wait, but the lateral faces are triangles with base 1 and height. Wait, the slant height is not necessarily the same as the height.

Wait, in a square pyramid, the lateral faces are congruent isosceles triangles. The slant height can be computed using the Pythagorean theorem.

Wait, the distance from the center of the base to a midpoint of a side is 1/2 (since the base is from -1/√2 to 1/√2 in y and z, so the center is at (0,0,0)). So, the distance from the center to a base edge is 1/√2 * 1/2 = 1/(2√2).

Wait, no, actually, the distance from the center to a side is half the side length, which is 1/2.

Wait, in a square base, the distance from the center to the middle of a side is half the side length, which is 1/2.

Wait, but the slant height is the distance from the apex to the midpoint of a base edge.

So, apex is at (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2), and midpoint of a base edge is, say, (0,1/√2,0). The distance between these points is sqrt[(1/√2 - 0)^2 + (1/√2 - 1/√2)^2 + (1/√2 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(1/2) + 0 + (1/2)] = sqrt(1) = 1.

So, the slant height is 1, meaning each of the triangular faces has a base of length 1 and a height of 1.

Therefore, the area of each triangular face is (1 * 1)/2 = 1/2.

Since there are four triangular faces, the total lateral surface area is 4*(1/2) = 2.

Adding the base area of 1, the total surface area is 1 + 2 = 3.

Wait, so the surface area of the smaller piece is 3.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in reality, each triangular face is congruent, but in the coordinate system, we saw that the distance from apex to each base vertex is 1, but the distance from apex to the midpoint of a base edge is also 1.

So, each triangular face is an equilateral triangle with sides of length 1, so each has area (sqrt(3)/4)*1^2 = sqrt(3)/4.

Therefore, four triangular faces have area 4*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3).

Plus the base area of 1, total surface area is 1 + sqrt(3).

But in the other approach, by considering the slant height, we get each triangular face area as 1/2, and total lateral surface area is 2, plus the base area 1, total 3.

But which is correct?

Wait, let's compute the slant height correctly.

In a square pyramid, the slant height is the distance from the apex to the midpoint of a base edge.

Given the base edge length is 1, the distance from the center to the midpoint of a base edge is 1/2 (since each side is length 1, and the midpoint is at distance 1/2 from the center along each axis).

But in our case, the apex is at (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2) and the midpoint of a base edge is at (0,1/√2,0). So, the distance between these points is sqrt[(1/√2)^2 + (1/√2 - 1/√2)^2 + (1/√2 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(1/2) + 0 + (1/2)] = sqrt(1) = 1.

Therefore, the slant height is 1.

Therefore, the area of each triangular face is (base * slant height)/2 = (1 * 1)/2 = 1/2.

Since there are four triangular faces, the total lateral surface area is 4*(1/2) = 2.

Adding the base area of 1, the total surface area is 3.

Therefore, the surface area of the smaller piece is 3.

But in our coordinate system, when we compute the square base and the four triangular faces of the square pyramid, the total surface area is 1 + sqrt(3) ≈ 1 + 1.732 ≈ 2.732. Which is less than 3.

So, this is a contradiction.

Wait, that suggests an error in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the pyramid is not a square pyramid but a different kind of pyramid.

Wait, in our coordinate system, the intersection is a square, but the apex is at A, which is not directly above the center of the square. So, the pyramid is not a regular square pyramid, but an irregular one.

Therefore, the faces are not congruent.

Thus, the slant heights are not equal, so the areas of the triangular faces are not equal.

Therefore, the previous approach of computing each triangular face area as 1/2 is incorrect because the triangular faces are not congruent.

Therefore, I need a different method.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the area of each triangular face directly.

So, let's consider one of the triangular faces, say, connecting (0,1/√2,0), (0,0,1/√2), and (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2).

So, the triangle has vertices at (0,1/√2,0), (0,0,1/√2), and (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2).

To find its area, I can compute the lengths of its sides.

First, compute the distance between (0,1/√2,0) and (0,0,1/√2):

sqrt[(0 - 0)^2 + (1/√2 - 0)^2 + (0 - 1/√2)^2] = sqrt[0 + 1/2 + 1/2] = sqrt(1) = 1.

Second, compute the distance between (0,1/√2,0) and (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2):

sqrt[(1/√2 - 0)^2 + (1/√2 - 1/√2)^2 + (1/√2 - 0)^2] = sqrt[1/2 + 0 + 1/2] = sqrt(1) = 1.

Third, compute the distance between (0,0,1/√2) and (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2):

sqrt[(1/√2 - 0)^2 + (1/√2 - 0)^2 + (1/√2 - 1/√2)^2] = sqrt[1/2 + 1/2 + 0] = sqrt(1) = 1.

Wait, so all sides are length 1, so the triangle is equilateral with sides of length 1.

Therefore, the area of each triangular face is (sqrt(3)/4)*1^2 = sqrt(3)/4.

Since there are four such triangular faces, the total lateral surface area is 4*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3).

Adding the base area, which is 1, the total surface area is 1 + sqrt(3).

Therefore, the surface area of the smaller piece is 1 + sqrt(3).

But I initially thought it might be 3, but that seems incorrect because the slant heights are not equal.

Wait, but in reality, the triangular faces are equilateral triangles with sides of length 1, so their areas are sqrt(3)/4 each, totaling sqrt(3), plus the base area of 1.

Therefore, the total surface area is 1 + sqrt(3).

Thus, the answer is 1 + sqrt(3).

Alternatively, since the problem is in a regular tetrahedron with edge length 2, perhaps there is a scaling factor involved.

Wait, the edge length in our coordinate system is 2, as the distance between A and B is 2.

In our coordinate system, the square base has side length 1, which is half of the edge length. So, the scaling factor is 1/2.

Therefore, the areas scale by (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Therefore, the surface area of the smaller piece is 1 + sqrt(3), but scaled by 1/4.

Wait, but that would be 1/4 + sqrt(3)/4, which isn't the case.

Wait, no, in reality, the surface area isn't scaled by the square of the linear dimensions because the base is not a square in the same orientation.

Wait, perhaps 1 + sqrt(3) is correct in our coordinate system, but we need to relate it to the original tetrahedron.

Wait, in our coordinate system, the original tetrahedron has edge length 2, and the smaller piece has a square base of side length 1, and four triangular faces each of area sqrt(3)/4.

Therefore, the total surface area is 1 + sqrt(3).

But wait, the original tetrahedron has four equilateral triangular faces, each of area (sqrt(3)/4)*(2)^2 = sqrt(3).

Therefore, the total surface area is 4*sqrt(3).

The smaller piece's surface area is 1 + sqrt(3).

So, the ratio is (1 + sqrt(3)) / (4*sqrt(3)).

But the problem is just asking for the surface area of the piece, so if in our coordinate system, it's 1 + sqrt(3), then that's the answer.

But in the problem statement, the edge length is 2, so we need to check if our calculation is consistent.

Wait, in our coordinate system, the edge length is 2, and the surface area is 1 + sqrt(3).

But in reality, the surface area of a regular tetrahedron with edge length a is sqrt(3)*a^2.

So, for a=2, it is sqrt(3)*4 ≈ 6.928.

In our coordinate system, the surface area is 1 + sqrt(3) ≈ 2.732, which is less than the original, which makes sense.

But now, when we cut it, the surface area of the smaller piece is 1 + sqrt(3), and the other piece's surface area is sqrt(3)*4 - (1 + sqrt(3)) = 4*sqrt(3) - 1 - sqrt(3) = 3*sqrt(3) - 1.

But 3*sqrt(3) - 1 ≈ 5.196 - 1 = 4.196, which is more than the original 6.928 minus 2.732 ≈ 4.196, so it's consistent.

Therefore, the surface area of the smaller piece is 1 + sqrt(3), which is approximately 2.732.

Therefore, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The surface area of one of these pieces is \boxed{1 + \sqrt{3}}.
</think>

Given a regular tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with side length 2, we need to find the surface area of one of the pieces created by a plane parallel to edges \(AB\) and \(CD\) and lying halfway between them.

1. **Understanding the Tetrahedron and Plane**:
   - A regular tetrahedron has four equilateral triangular faces.
   - The plane is parallel to edges \(AB\) and \(CD\) and lies halfway between them.
   - The distance from the plane to each of these edges is \(\sqrt{2}/4\).

2. **Finding the Intersection**:
   - The intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron forms a square.
   - The coordinates of the intersection points are found to be \((0, 1/\sqrt{2}, 0)\), \((0, 0, 1/\sqrt{2})\), \((0, 0, -1/\sqrt{2})\), and \((0, -1/\sqrt{2}, 0)\).

3. **Surface Area Calculation**:
   - The intersection forms a square with side length 1.
   - The area of the square base is 1.
   - Each triangular face of the square pyramid is an equilateral triangle with side length 1.
   - The area of each equilateral triangle is \(\sqrt{3}/4\).
   - There are four triangular faces, so the total lateral surface area is \(4 \times \sqrt{3}/4 = \sqrt{3}\).

4. **Total Surface Area**:
   - Adding the area of the square base and the lateral faces, the total surface area is \(1 + \sqrt{3}\).

Thus, the surface area of one of these pieces is \(\boxed{1 + \sqrt{3}}\).
