Question:
Bob and Alice each have a bag that contains one ball of each of the colors,  blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob then randomly selects one ball from his bag and  puts it into Alice's bag. What is the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same?

Correct Answer:
After Alice puts the ball into Bob's bag, his bag will contain six balls: two of one color and one of each of the other colors. After Bob selects a ball and places it into Alice's bag, the two bags will have the same contents if and only if Bob picked one of the two balls in his bag that are the same color. Because there are six balls in the bag when Bob makes his selection, the probability of selecting one of the same colored pair is $2/6=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure out the chance that after Alice and Bob do their stuff, both bags have the same set of balls. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the setup. Bob and Alice each have a bag with one ball of each color: blue, green, orange, red, and violet. That means each bag initially has five different colored balls. So, each bag has five unique colors, right?

Now, the process is as follows: Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Then, Bob randomly selects one ball from his new bag (which now has one extra ball, from Alice) and puts it back into Alice's bag. We need to find the probability that after this process, both bags have the same contents. That means, after these two operations, both bags should have the same five colors, just maybe in a different order or something? Wait, actually, more precisely, they should have the same exact set of balls. So, if Bob adds a ball to Alice's bag, and then Alice removes a ball from her own bag and puts it into Bob's, the result should be that both bags end up with all five colors, but just possibly in a different order or maybe one of them is missing a color? Hmm, wait, no, because each bag starts with five colors, and each operation only adds one and removes one, so they should still each have five colors. So, the only way the bags could be the same is if they have the exact same set of balls, which implies that they must have ended up with the same five colors, but in different bags.

Wait, but hold on, because initially, both bags have the same five colors. Then Alice adds a ball to Bob's bag, so Bob's bag now has six balls, and Alice's bag has five balls. Then Bob removes one ball from his bag and adds it to Alice's bag. So now, Bob's bag has five balls again, and Alice's bag also has five balls.

So, for the bags to end up the same, both must have the same five colors. So, the key here is that the operation must have caused Alice and Bob to end up with the exact same set of five colors.

Therefore, the process is: Alice takes one of Bob's five balls, adds it to Bob's, making Bob's bag have six balls, and then Bob takes one of his six balls and adds it back to Alice's bag. So, the two operations are:

1. Alice removes a ball from her bag (which initially was blue, green, orange, red, violet) and adds it to Bob's bag.
2. Bob removes a ball from his bag (which now has six balls) and adds it back to Alice's bag.

We need to calculate the probability that after these two operations, Alice and Bob have the exact same set of five balls.

Hmm, okay. So, let me think about how this can happen. For both bags to have the same set of five balls, the ball that Alice moved into Bob's bag must have been moved back by Bob. So, if Alice takes a specific color, say blue, and then Bob takes blue from his six balls and puts it back into Alice's bag, then both bags would have the remaining four colors, meaning the other four colors plus blue—the other four colors are green, orange, red, violet. So, actually, that would mean both bags have green, orange, red, violet, and blue. So, in this case, they are the same.

Wait, but hold on. If Alice moves a color, and then Bob moves that same color back, then both bags will have the same set. So, the only way for the bags to end up the same is if Alice moves a color and Bob moves back that same color. So, the probability is the probability that Alice moves a color, and then Bob moves that same color. Since Alice picks one color out of five, and then Bob picks one color out of six (since he has six balls now), the probability is 1/5 (for Alice) multiplied by 1/6 (for Bob), which is 1/30. But wait, is that the only scenario?

Wait, hold on, no. Because Bob could move any color from his six, which include the color that Alice moved in. So, if Alice moves a color, say blue, then Bob has a 1/6 chance of moving blue and 5/6 chance of moving one of the other four colors. So, the probability that Bob moves the same color Alice moved is 1/6, so the total probability is 1/5 * 1/6 = 1/30.

But wait, is that the only case? Let me think again.

Suppose Alice moves a color, say blue, and puts it into Bob's bag. So, Bob's bag now has six balls: blue, green, orange, red, violet, and the one from Alice. Then, Bob selects a ball at random from his bag to put back into Alice's bag. So, the chance that he selects blue is 1/6, and the chance he selects any other is 5/6. So, only if he selects blue, the two bags will be the same. So, in this case, the probability is 1/5 (Alice picks blue) multiplied by 1/6 (Bob picks blue), which is 1/30.

But wait, hold on, is this the only way for the bags to be the same? Because if Alice picks any color, say green, then Bob has to pick green to have the same bag.

Wait, but there are five colors, so for each color that Alice picks, the probability that Bob picks the same color is 1/6, so the total probability is 5*(1/5)*(1/6) = 1/6.

Wait, wait, no, that can't be. Wait, if Alice picks any color, say color C, then the probability that Bob picks color C is 1/6, so for each color, it's 1/5 * 1/6. Since there are five colors, the total probability is 5*(1/5)*(1/6) = 1/6.

Wait, so is the total probability 1/6? Hmm, that seems too high, but let me think.

Alternatively, maybe it's 1/5 * 1/6, because Alice picks one color (1/5), then Bob has to pick the same color (1/6). So, 1/5 * 1/6 = 1/30, which is approximately 0.0333.

But I thought earlier, 1/5 * 1/6 is 1/30, but if we have five colors, and for each color, the probability is 1/30, so 5*(1/30) is 1/6. Hmm, so which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I need to think more carefully. Let me model this step by step.

First, Alice picks a color from her bag (which has five distinct colors). The probability that she picks any specific color is 1/5.

Suppose she picks color C. Now, Bob's bag has six balls: color C and the other four colors from Alice's bag. So, Bob now has six balls, one of which is color C.

Then, Bob selects a ball at random to put back into Alice's bag. The chance that he selects color C is 1/6, and the chance he selects any other color is 5/6. So, the probability that Bob selects color C is 1/6.

Therefore, for each color that Alice could pick, the probability that Bob picks the same color back is 1/6.

Since Alice could pick any one of the five colors, the total probability is 5*(1/5)*(1/6) = 1/6.

Hence, the probability that the two bags end up the same is 1/6.

Wait, so that contradicts my first thought of 1/30. So, which one is correct? Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that each color is equally likely. Wait, but in the first step, Alice is equally likely to pick any of the five colors, so 1/5 per color. Then, given that she picks a particular color, the probability that Bob picks it back is 1/6, so 1/5 * 1/6 = 1/30 per color, and since there are five colors, 5*(1/30) = 1/6.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider all possible operations.

Let me model this as a two-step process. First, Alice removes a ball from her bag (5 choices) and adds it to Bob's bag. Then, Bob removes a ball from his bag (6 choices) and adds it back to Alice's bag.

So, the total number of possible outcomes is 5 (Alice's choices) multiplied by 6 (Bob's choices) multiplied by 5 (Alice's original choices) multiplied by 4 (Bob's choices after Alice's move). Wait, no, that seems complicated.

Wait, actually, the process is: Alice has 5 balls, picks one (5 choices). Bob has 5 balls, picks one (5 choices). So, the total number of possible operations is 5*5=25. But actually, each operation is dependent because Alice's choice affects Bob's bag, so the number of possible operations is 5 (Alice's choices) times 6 (Bob's choices after adding Alice's ball). So, that's 30 possible operations.

Wait, perhaps that's a better way to think about it. So, the total number of possible ways the process can happen is 5*6=30, because Alice can choose any of five, and then Bob can choose any of six.

Now, how many of those 30 operations result in both bags having the same set of balls?

Well, for the bags to end up the same, the color that Alice moved must be moved back by Bob. So, if Alice moves color C, Bob must move color C as well. So, for each color C, the number of operations where Alice moves C and Bob moves C is 1 (Alice's choice) * 1 (Bob's choice) = 1. Since there are five colors, the total number of such operations is 5.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 5, and the total number of possible operations is 30, so the probability is 5/30 = 1/6.

So, that's consistent with the previous reasoning.

But wait, let me think again. So, when Alice moves a color, say blue, Bob now has six balls: blue, green, orange, red, violet, and whatever was in Alice's bag. Then, Bob selects one of those six. The chance that he selects blue is 1/6, so the number of favorable operations is 1 (Alice picks blue) * 1 (Bob picks blue) = 1.

Similarly, for green, it's 1, and so on. So, 5 favorable operations in total.

Hence, 5/30=1/6. So, that seems correct.

Wait, but another way to think about it is: After Alice moves a ball to Bob's bag, Bob has six balls, including the one Alice moved in. So, the chance that Bob picks the same color is 1/6, regardless of which color Alice moved in. So, since Alice has five choices, each with equal probability, the probability that Bob picks the same color is 1/6, so total probability is 5*(1/5)*(1/6)=1/6.

So, yes, that seems to make sense.

But let me think of another approach to verify. Maybe using permutations.

Wait, perhaps not permutations, but the probability that after these two operations, the two bags are identical.

Wait, so the initial state is both bags have the same set of five colors.

After Alice moves a ball, Bob's bag has six balls, including Alice's. Then Bob moves a ball back. So, the only way for the bags to be the same is if the ball that Alice moved is moved back by Bob. So, the chance is 1/5 for Alice's color, times 1/6 for Bob's color.

Wait, but no, because if you have five colors, the chance that Bob picks the same color Alice moved is 1/6, so 1/5 * 1/6 = 1/30 for each color. So, five colors, each with 1/30, so total is 5*(1/30)=1/6.

Yes, same as before.

Wait, so the probability is 1/6.

But wait, I'm a little confused because I initially thought of 1/30, but then realized that for each color, it's 1/30, and since there are five colors, it's 1/6.

Alternatively, another way: Let me think of the process as a function.

First, Alice picks a color C from her bag. Then, Bob picks a color D from his bag (including C). Then, the probability that D=C is 1/6, so the probability that after these two operations, both bags are the same is 1/6.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about this as a two-step process and compute the probability step by step.

First, the probability that Alice picks any color is 1/5.

Then, given that, the probability that Bob picks the same color back is 1/6.

Therefore, the total probability is 1/5 * 1/6 = 1/30 per color.

But since there are five colors, the total probability is 5*(1/30)=1/6.

Yes, that seems consistent.

So, I think the answer is 1/6.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose Alice picks a color, say blue. Then Bob has six balls: blue, green, orange, red, violet, and blue again. So, Bob's bag has two blue balls now. Then, Bob picks a ball at random, and the chance he picks blue is 2/6 = 1/3. So, in that case, the probability that Bob picks blue is 1/3, so the probability that the bags end up the same is 1/5 * 1/3 = 1/15.

But wait, that's only if Alice picked blue. Similarly, if Alice picked green, Bob's bag would have two green balls, so the probability that he picks green is 2/6=1/3, so same probability. So, for each color, the probability that the two bags end up the same is 1/5 * 1/3=1/15.

Since there are five colors, the total probability is 5*(1/15)=1/3.

Wait, now this is conflicting with the previous result of 1/6.

Hmm, so which is correct? Is it 1/6 or 1/3?

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me figure out why there's a discrepancy.

In the first approach, I considered that after Alice moves a color, Bob has six balls, including the one Alice moved in, so the chance he moves the same color is 1/6.

But in reality, if Alice moves a color, say blue, then Bob's bag now has two blue balls. So, when Bob selects a ball, the probability he selects blue is 2/6=1/3.

Therefore, the probability that the final bags are the same is 1/5 (Alice's choice) multiplied by 1/3 (Bob's choice) = 1/15 per color.

Therefore, total probability is 5*(1/15)=1/3.

Wait, so which is it? 1/6 or 1/3?

Wait, so maybe my initial approach was wrong because I didn't account for Bob's bag having duplicates.

Wait, so perhaps the correct way is to model it as:

1. Alice picks a color C (1/5 chance).

2. Bob now has six balls: C and the four others.

3. Bob then selects a ball at random to put back into Alice's bag.

   a. If Bob selects C, then Bob's bag has four other balls, and Alice's bag has the other four balls plus C. So, the two bags would still have all five colors.

   b. If Bob selects one of the other four balls, then Bob's bag will have five unique colors, and Alice's bag will have five unique colors as well. So, in this case, the two bags are not the same.

Wait, hold on, that contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, no. Wait, if Alice moves a color, say blue, and Bob then selects blue, then Bob's bag will have four other colors, so the total in Bob's bag is four colors plus blue, which is five. Similarly, Alice's bag will have the other four colors plus blue.

Wait, but hold on, no, because Alice started with five colors, added one, then Bob moved one back. So, Alice's bag is five: blue plus four others. Bob's bag is five: blue plus four others. So, actually, if Bob moves blue back, both bags have the same five colors. So, that's the case.

But if Bob moves one of the other colors, say green, then Bob's bag becomes green, orange, red, violet, blue, and Alice's bag becomes green, orange, red, violet, and the other four colors, which was blue. Wait, no, Alice's bag would have green, orange, red, violet, and the four colors that were in Bob's bag except blue. Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to model this step by step.

Let me denote Alice's original bag as A = {blue, green, orange, red, violet}.

Bob's original bag as B = {blue, green, orange, red, violet}.

Step 1: Alice picks a color from A, say color C.

So, now A has C and the other four colors. Let's denote A1 = A - {C} ∪ {C} = {C, green, orange, red, violet}.

Wait, no, it's the same. Wait, actually, A is still the same set, just with one color replaced by C.

Wait, hold on, no, Alice is moving one ball from her original bag to Bob's. So, if she moves blue, her bag becomes {green, orange, red, violet, blue}, and Bob's bag becomes {blue, green, orange, red, violet}.

Then, Bob picks a ball from his bag: if he picks blue, he puts it back into Alice's bag. Then, Alice's bag becomes {blue, green, orange, red, violet}, and Bob's bag becomes {blue, green, orange, red, violet}. So, the two bags are the same.

If Bob picks, say, green, then he puts it back into Alice's bag. Then, Alice's bag becomes {blue, green, orange, red, violet}, and Bob's bag becomes {blue, green, orange, red, green}, which is actually duplicates. Wait, no, hold on. Bob's bag after removing green would be {blue, orange, red, violet}, so Bob's bag is {blue, orange, red, violet}, and Alice's bag is {blue, green, orange, red, violet}, which are not the same. So, in this case, the bags are not the same.

Wait, so if Alice moves a color and Bob moves it back, the two bags are the same. If Bob moves a different color, the two bags are not the same.

Wait, so in that case, the probability that the two bags are the same is equal to the probability that Bob selects the same color that Alice moved. So, if Alice moves a color, say blue, the probability that Bob selects blue is 1/5, because Bob's bag has five balls. Wait, no, Bob's bag has six balls because he added one from Alice's.

Wait, no, hold on. Let me re-examine.

Wait, after Alice moves a color C from her bag, Bob's bag has six balls: C and the other four original colors. So, Bob's bag is five unique colors, but one of them is C, which was moved from Alice's bag.

Then, Bob selects a ball at random to put back into Alice's bag. So, the probability that he selects C is 1/6, and the probability that he selects any other color is 5/6.

If he selects C, then both bags will have the same five colors, because Alice's bag had C, and Bob's bag had C, and then he puts C back. So, the result is that both bags have the same five colors.

If he selects a different color, say D, then Alice's bag will have C and the other four colors, and Bob's bag will have D and the other four colors. So, the two bags are not the same.

Therefore, the probability that the two bags are the same is equal to the probability that Bob selects the color that Alice moved, which is 1/6.

Since Alice can move any of the five colors with equal probability, the total probability is 5*(1/5)*(1/6) = 1/6.

Hence, the probability is 1/6.

Wait, that seems to make sense now.

So, to recap: Alice moves a color, which is one of five, each with probability 1/5. Then, Bob has six balls, one of which is the color Alice moved. The probability that Bob selects that color is 1/6. Hence, the total probability is 5*(1/5)*(1/6) = 1/6.

Therefore, the answer is 1/6.

But just to confirm, let's think of all possible cases.

Case 1: Alice moves blue.

Bob's bag has six balls: blue, green, orange, red, violet, and blue.

Bob selects blue with probability 1/6. Then, both bags have {blue, green, orange, red, violet}, same as before.

Case 2: Alice moves green.

Bob's bag has six balls: green, blue, orange, red, violet, green.

Bob selects green with probability 1/6, resulting in both bags being {green, blue, orange, red, violet}.

Similarly, for orange, red, and violet, same thing.

So, for each color, the probability that Bob selects that color is 1/6, so for five colors, it's 5*(1/6)/5 = 1/6.

Therefore, 1/6 is correct.

Alternatively, another way: The process is equivalent to Alice adding a color to Bob's bag, then Bob adding the same color back. So, the probability that they end up with the same set is equal to the probability that the color Alice added was also the color Bob added back, which is 1/6.

But actually, since Alice added a color, the chance that Bob added the same color back is 1/6. So, that's another way to see it.

So, yeah, after all that, I think the probability is 1/6.

**Final Answer**
The probability that the contents of the two bags are the same is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.
</think>

Bob and Alice each have a bag containing one ball of each color: blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Then, Bob randomly selects one ball from his bag and puts it back into Alice's bag. We need to find the probability that after this process, both bags have the same contents.

1. **Initial Setup**: Both bags start with the same five colors: blue, green, orange, red, and violet.
2. **Alice's Move**: Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag. The probability of selecting any specific color is \( \frac{1}{5} \).
3. **Bob's Response**: Bob now has six balls (including the one Alice moved). The probability that Bob selects the same color that Alice moved is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
4. **Probability Calculation**: For each color that Alice moves, the probability that Bob selects that same color is \( \frac{1}{6} \). Since there are five colors, the total probability is \( 5 \times \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{6} \).

Thus, the probability that the contents of the two bags are the same is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}\).
