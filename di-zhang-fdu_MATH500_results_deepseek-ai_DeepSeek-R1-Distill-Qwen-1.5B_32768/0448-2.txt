Question:
$\textbf{Juan's Old Stamping Grounds}$

Juan organizes the stamps in his collection by country and by the decade in which they were issued. The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each. (Brazil and Peru are South American countries and France and Spain are in Europe.) [asy]

[/asy] What was the average price, in cents, of his $70\text{'s}$ stamps? Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a cent.

Correct Answer:
The $\text{70's}$ stamps cost:

$\bullet$  Brazil, $12(\$ 0.06) = \$ 0.72;$

$\bullet$  Peru, $6(\$ 0.04) = \$ 0.24;$

$\bullet$  France, $12(\$ 0.06) = \$ 0.72;$

$\bullet$  Spain, $13(\$ 0.05) = \$ 0.65.$

The total is $\$2.33$ for the $43$ stamps and the average price is $\frac{\$ 2.33}{43} \approx \$0.054 = \boxed{5.4 \text{ cents}}.$

Wrong Prediction:

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to find the average price of Juan's 70s stamps. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The question mentions that Juan organizes his stamps by country and by the decade they were issued. The prices he paid were: Brazil and France in the 50s at 6 cents each, Peru and Spain in the 40s at 4 cents each, and the 60s at 7 cents each for France and Spain as well? Wait, no, let me check the problem again.

Wait, no, the prices he paid were: Brazil and France at 6 cents each, Peru and Spain at 4 cents each. Then the decades are labeled 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. The Asymptote figure is provided, but since I can't see it, I need to rely on the description.

So, in the 50s, the prices are Brazil and France at 6 cents each. So that would be two stamps, each costing 6 cents, so total 12 cents for the 50s.

Similarly, in the 40s, Peru and Spain are at 4 cents each. So that's two stamps, each 4 cents, so total 8 cents for the 40s.

In the 60s, the prices are France and Spain at 7 cents each. So that would be two stamps, each 7 cents, totaling 14 cents.

In the 70s, labels show 12, 12, 6, 13. Wait, hold on, the asy code shows labels for 70s as 12, 12, 6, 13. Hmm, so the 70s have four decades: 70s? Wait, no, wait, the decades are labeled 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. So each decade is labeled 5,6,7,8,9.

So, the 70s would be the decade labeled 7. In the Asymptote code, it's labeled as 70s, and the labels for the decades are:

- 50s: (13.5,4.5), label "50s"
- 60s: (10.5,4.5), label "60s"
- 70s: (13.5,4.5), label "70s"
Wait, hold on, in the Asymptote code, labels are:

label(scale(0.8)*"50s", (7.5,4.5));

label(scale(0.8)*"6", (7.5,0.5));

label(scale(0.8)*"7", (10.5,3.5));

label(scale(0.8)*"4", (10.5,2.5));

label(scale(0.8)*"4", (10.5,1.5));

label(scale(0.8)*"9", (10.5,0.5));

Similarly for 60s and 70s. So the labels seem to be:

- 50s: from y=5 to y=0, with labels 50s at (7.5,4.5) which is the top of the 50s line.

- 60s: similar at (10.5,4.5), labels 6,7,4,4,9.

Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's better to just think in terms of the Asymptote code.

From the Asymptote code, I can see that the years are labeled as 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s. Each decade is represented by a horizontal line, and the labels are placed between the lines.

But in the asy code, the label for 50s is at (7.5,4.5), and the numbers are 50s at the top, 4 at the bottom. Wait, actually, the Asymptote code labels "50s" at (7.5,4.5), "6" at (7.5,3.5), "7" at (10.5,3.5), "4" at (10.5,2.5), "4" at (10.5,1.5), and "9" at (10.5,0.5). So it's arranged vertically.

Similarly, there's another label for "60s" at (10.5,4.5), with "6" at (10.5,3.5), "7" at (10.5,2.5), "4" at (10.5,1.5), and "9" at (10.5,0.5). The same pattern continues for the 70s, 80s, and 90s.

So, each decade is represented as a horizontal line with a label above it, and the numbers decrease from top to bottom. So for 50s, the top label is 50s, and then 4, then 7, then 4, then 9 at the bottom.

Therefore, in the 50s decade, the prices are Brazil and France at 6 cents each. So two stamps at 6 cents each.

In the 40s, Peru and Spain are at 4 cents each. So two stamps at 4 cents each.

In the 60s, France and Spain are at 7 cents each. So two stamps at 7 cents each.

In the 70s, the Asymptote code has labels 12,12,6,13. Wait, hold on, the 70s labels are at (13.5,4.5), with "70s" at the top, and then numbers decreasing: 12,12,6,13 at the bottom.

Wait, but hold on, this is confusing because the 70s are in the middle of the Asymptote figure. So maybe each decade is a horizontal line with a label, and the numbers are arranged vertically.

So, if I'm looking at the 70s, the top label is "70s", and then the next is 12, then 12, then 6, then 13 at the bottom.

Wait, but that would be five numbers? Wait, no, each decade is just a single label. So in the 70s, the labels are 12,12,6,13. Maybe that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the asy code is adding multiple labels for each decade. For example, in the 50s, the labels are 50s at the top, then 4,7,4,9 at the bottom.

Similarly, in the 60s, the labels are 60s at the top, then 7,4,4,9.

In the 70s, the labels are 70s at the top, then 12,12,6,13.

Wait, but 12,12,6,13 is four numbers, but the 70s is supposed to be a single decade. So that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe the asy code is just illustrative and not to scale. Maybe each label is for a specific decade, and the numbers are just in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the Asymptote code is not an exact representation but just a sketch. So maybe I can just focus on the problem description.

Ah, the problem says: "Juan organizes the stamps in his collection by country and by the decade in which they were issued. The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each." So it's a bit unclear.

Wait, actually, let me read the problem again:

"Juan's Old Stamping Grounds" problem:

- Brazil and France: 6 cents each
- Peru: 4 cents each
- Spain: 5 cents each

Wait, so in terms of countries, Brazil and France are both in Europe, and Peru and Spain are in South America. So in terms of the Asymptote code, maybe the countries correspond to different decades.

Looking back, the Asymptote code labels the decades as 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s. Each label has the decade number at the top, and then the prices for each country's stamps in that decade.

Wait, so if I think of each decade, say 50s, the prices are:

- Brazil and France: 6 cents each
- Peru: 4 cents each
- Spain: 5 cents each

But wait, in the 50s, the prices are described as Brazil and France at 6 cents each, Peru and Spain at 4 cents each. So that would be two stamps at 6 cents, two stamps at 4 cents, and two stamps at 5 cents. But wait, the problem says "price he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each." Hmm, so that's only three countries, but in the 50s, there are four countries: Brazil, France, Peru, Spain.

Wait, now this is confusing. Maybe in the 50s, the prices are Brazil and France at 6 cents, Peru at 4 cents, and Spain at 5 cents. So in the 50s, the total price would be 6 + 6 + 4 + 5 = 21 cents. But the problem didn't specify how many stamps he has in each country, so maybe I need to figure that out.

Wait, actually, the problem says: "Juan's Old Stamping Grounds" and the prices he paid were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each. So in total, he bought some number of Brazil stamps at 6 cents, some number of France stamps at 6 cents, some number of Peru stamps at 4 cents, and some number of Spain stamps at 5 cents.

But the problem also mentions organizing by country and by the decade. So, he organized by country and by the decade. So, perhaps, he has stamps from different countries, grouped by decade.

Wait, maybe in each decade, he has stamps from different countries, but the problem is only giving me the prices per country.

Wait, I think the problem is saying that in each decade, he has stamps from some countries, at some prices. So for example, in the 50s, he has Brazil and France stamps, each at 6 cents, so two stamps, 6 cents each. Peru and Spain are in the 40s, so in the 60s, maybe the same?

Wait, no, the 60s are labeled at the top as "60s", and the prices for each country's stamps in the 60s.

Wait, the problem says: "prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each." So, he bought some number of Brazil stamps at 6 cents, some number of France stamps at 6 cents, some number of Peru stamps at 4 cents, and some number of Spain stamps at 5 cents.

But how many? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's not necessary. But wait, the problem also mentions that he organized the stamps by country and by decade. So, perhaps, for each country, he has stamps in each decade.

Wait, maybe the stamps are grouped by country and by decade, so for each country, he has multiple decades worth of stamps.

But the problem is asking for the average price of his 70s stamps. So, maybe he has some number of 70s stamps, each of which is from a country, and each from a decade. So, for example, a 70s Brazil stamp would be from the 70s decade, and it's from Brazil.

Wait, but then how do the prices get assigned? The prices from the problem are per country, so in each decade, the prices are per country.

Wait, maybe I need to think of the problem as being organized by decade, with each decade having stamps from different countries. So, for instance, in the 50s, he has Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain stamps, each with their respective prices. But the problem mentions that he organized by country and by decade, so perhaps for each country, he has multiple decades worth of stamps.

Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that in each decade, he has some stamps from different countries, priced accordingly. So, for example, in the 50s, he has Brazil and France stamps, each at 6 cents, and Peru and Spain stamps, each at 4 cents and 5 cents respectively. So in the 50s, he has two Brazil stamps, two France stamps, one Peru stamp, and one Spain stamp.

Similarly, in the 60s, he has two Brazil stamps, two France stamps, one Peru stamp, and one Spain stamp. But wait, no, in the 60s, the problem says Peru and Spain are at 7 cents each. So in the 60s, he has two Brazil stamps at 6 cents, two France stamps at 6 cents, one Peru stamp at 7 cents, and one Spain stamp at 7 cents.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how many stamps he has in each country. So, maybe it's better to think that in each decade, he has at least one stamp from each country, but the number isn't specified.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the average price of his 70s stamps. So, perhaps, we can assume that in the 70s, he has some number of each country's stamps, each priced at a certain amount. So, if the 70s have Brazil and France stamps, each at 6 cents, Peru and Spain stamps, each at 12 cents and 12 cents, and 6 cents. Wait, the Asymptote code labels for 70s are 12,12,6,13. So perhaps the 70s have four countries' stamps, each with different prices.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to parse the problem again.

Juan organizes the stamps in his collection by country and by the decade. So, he's grouped his stamps by country (Brazil, France, Peru, Spain) and by the decade (50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s). The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each.

So, in the 50s, he has Brazil and France stamps at 6 cents each, and Spain and Peru at 5 and 4 cents each. Wait, no, the problem says "prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each." So he paid 6 cents for each of Brazil and France, 4 cents for Peru, and 5 cents for Spain.

But since he organized by country and by decade, each country's stamps are grouped by decade. So, for example, in the 50s, he has some number of Brazil stamps, each at 6 cents, and some number of France stamps at 6 cents. Similarly, in the 60s, he has some number of Peru stamps at 4 cents, and some number of Spain stamps at 5 cents. But in the 70s, the problem labels have 12,12,6,13. So perhaps in the 70s, he has four countries' stamps, each with different prices?

Wait, maybe the problem is that in the 70s, the labels are 70s, 12,12,6,13. So, perhaps in the 70s, the price for each country is as follows:

- Brazil: 12 cents
- France: 12 cents
- Peru: 6 cents
- Spain: 13 cents

But that would be four countries in one decade. Wait, but the problem mentions only four countries: Brazil, France, Peru, Spain. So, perhaps in each decade, he has stamps from two countries, each at a certain price.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I need to think in terms of the Asymptote code and the labels.

In the Asymptote code, the 50s is labeled at (7.5,4.5), with "50s" at the top, and then the numbers decreasing: 4, 7, 4, 9 at the bottom.

Similarly, for 60s, the labels are 6 at the top, then 7,4,4,9.

In the 70s, the labels are 70s at the top, and then 12,12,6,13 at the bottom.

Wait, so in the 70s, the labels are 12,12,6,13. So perhaps in the 70s decade, the prices are:

- Brazil: 12 cents
- France: 12 cents
- Peru: 6 cents
- Spain: 13 cents

But then, since the problem only mentions four countries, perhaps the other two countries (I guess Brazil and France) have different prices?

Wait, no, the problem says "prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each." So, in total, it's four countries, and each has two stamps, so total 8 stamps.

Wait, but then in the 50s, it's four countries, each with two stamps, so 8 stamps, each at 6,4,7,5 cents. Wait, but the problem says "prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each." So, in total, he paid for 8 stamps: two from Brazil at 6 cents, two from France at 6 cents, one from Peru at 4 cents, and one from Spain at 5 cents.

But when he organized by decade, maybe the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, he had different numbers of each country's stamps.

But the problem is specifically asking for the average price of his 70s stamps. So, to find the average price, I need to figure out how many 70s stamps he has, and what their prices are, then compute the average.

So, in the 70s decade, according to the Asymptote code labels, the prices are 12,12,6,13. So perhaps:

- Brazil: 12 cents
- France: 12 cents
- Peru: 6 cents
- Spain: 13 cents

So, in the 70s, he has four countries, each with different prices. So, for each country, he has one or more stamps.

But since the problem doesn't specify how many stamps he has from each country, perhaps it's assumed that he has one stamp from each country in the 70s, so four stamps, each with different prices.

But in that case, the average would be (12 + 12 + 6 + 13) / 4 = (43) / 4 = 10.75 cents. Rounded to the nearest tenth is 10.8 cents.

But wait, the problem didn't specify that he has one stamp from each country in each decade. Instead, it just mentions the prices per country.

Wait, the problem says "Juan's Old Stamping Grounds" so maybe the total number of stamps in each decade is given? Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify the total number of stamps in each decade.

Wait, going back to the problem statement: "Juan's Old Stamping Grounds" problem.

- "prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each."

Wait, perhaps the original problem in Spanish: "Juan's Old Stamping Grounds" with the same data.

Wait, maybe the problem is in Spanish, but the translation says that in each country, the prices are as given, and he organized by decade.

Wait, perhaps the prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each.

So, for each country, he has stamps at those prices.

But, again, without knowing how many stamps he has from each country, it's tricky. But since the problem is about 70s stamps, and the Asymptote code labels for 70s are 12,12,6,13, perhaps in the 70s, he has four countries' stamps, each with different prices.

But again, without knowing how many stamps he has from each country, how can we compute the average?

Wait, maybe the problem is that in each decade, he has an equal number of each country's stamps.

Wait, but let me think. If in the 70s, the labels are 12,12,6,13, perhaps he has two 12s, one 6, and one 13.

Wait, but without specific information, maybe it's better to assume that in each decade, he has two stamps from each country, so for 70s, four countries, two each, so total 8 stamps, each with a price.

But the problem is asking for the average price of his 70s stamps, so if in the 70s, he has, say, 8 stamps, each from a different country, with prices 12,12,6,13, then the average would be (12 +12 +6 +13)/4 = 43/4 = 10.75.

But the problem didn't specify how many stamps he has in each decade. So perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in each decade, the number of stamps is the number of countries represented in that decade. For example, in the 50s, there are four countries, so he has four stamps, each from a different country, but two of them at 6 cents each, and two at 4 and 5 cents each. Wait, no.

Wait, the problem says "the prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each." So, in total, he paid for 8 stamps: two from Brazil, two from France, one from Peru, and one from Spain.

Therefore, in each decade, the number of stamps would be four, each from a different country? Or each country has two stamps?

Wait, no, because in the 50s, the labels are Brazil, France, Peru, Spain with respective prices 6,6,4,5. So, in the 50s, he has two Brazil stamps at 6, two France stamps at 6, one Peru stamp at 4, and one Spain stamp at 5. So, in total, 6 stamps.

Wait, but the problem says "the prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each." So, 6 stamps in total: two from Brazil, two from France, one from Peru, one from Spain.

But it's unclear how these are distributed over the decades. So, in the 50s, he has two Brazil stamps, two France stamps, one Peru stamp, and one Spain stamp.

Similarly, in the 60s, he has two Brazil stamps, two France stamps, one Peru stamp, and one Spain stamp.

In the 70s, according to the Asymptote code, labels are 70s at the top, with 12,12,6,13 at the bottom. So, perhaps in the 70s, he has four countries, each with different prices.

But again, without knowing how many stamps he has from each country, it's difficult to compute the average.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that in each decade, the number of stamps is equal to the number of countries. So, for each decade, he has as many stamps as the number of countries. So, for 50s, four countries, so four stamps; 60s, four countries, so four stamps; 70s, four countries, so four stamps; etc.

But in the problem statement, it says "the prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each." So, in total, he paid for 8 stamps (two from Brazil, two from France, one from Peru, one from Spain). So, that suggests that the total number of stamps he has is 8.

But if he's organized by decade, in the 50s, how many stamps does he have? Maybe 8 stamps divided equally over the decades. But he has 8 stamps, so each decade would have 1.6 stamps? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in each decade, he has two stamps from each country, so in the 50s, he has 2*4=8 stamps. Similarly, in the 60s, 2*4=8 stamps, etc. But that seems like a lot.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Since the problem is asking for the average price of his 70s stamps, and the 70s are labeled as 70s, 12,12,6,13, maybe each country has one 70s stamp, so four stamps in total, each with different prices.

Thus, to compute the average, it's (12 +12 +6 +13)/4 = 43/4 = 10.75, which is 10.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation because the problem didn't specify how many stamps he has from each country. If he has two from each country in the 70s, then the average would be higher.

Wait, maybe since the problem is asking about the average price of his 70s stamps, and given that the prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were as given, the average would be based on the four different prices he has in the 70s.

Alternatively, maybe the Asymptote code labels for the 70s are indicating that in the 70s, he has four countries, each with a certain number of stamps. So, for each country, he has one or more stamps.

But since the problem is in the 70s, and the Asymptote code is showing the labels, maybe each label is a different country in the 70s. So, in the 70s, he has four different countries, each with a certain number of stamps.

But without knowing how many stamps he has from each country, it's impossible to compute the exact average.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in each decade, the number of countries is equal to the number of digits in the decade. For example, 50s is one digit, so he has one country? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe think of the decades as each being a decade, so 50s,60s,70s, etc. Each decade is a single group, and in each group, he has one country's stamps.

Wait, but the problem says "organized by country and by the decade," so perhaps each country has multiple decades worth of stamps.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to approach it differently.

Given that the problem is from the Asymptote code, which labels the decades as 50s,60s,70s,80s,90s, with prices for each country, and in the 70s, the labels are 12,12,6,13.

So, in the 70s, he has four countries, each with a different number of stamps, each with a different price. So, the four countries are Brazil, France, Peru, Spain, each with their own number of stamps in the 70s.

Given that, and the problem is asking for the average price of his 70s stamps, which would be the total price of all 70s stamps divided by the number of 70s stamps.

But since we don't know how many stamps he has from each country in the 70s, I can't compute the exact total price.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is expecting us to assume that in the 70s, he has four different countries, each represented by one stamp, so four stamps in total, each with the given prices. So, in that case, the average would be (12 +12 +6 +13)/4 = 43/4 = 10.75.

Therefore, rounded to the nearest tenth, it would be 10.8 cents.

Alternatively, if he has more stamps from each country, the average would be higher, but without specific numbers, it's impossible to know.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each." So, he paid 6,6,4,5 cents for each of these countries. So, 8 stamps in total. So, in each decade, how many stamps does he have?

Wait, since he has 8 stamps in total, and he organized them by decade, perhaps each decade has two stamps? So, 50s: two stamps, 60s: two stamps, 70s: two stamps, etc. But the problem is asking about the 70s stamps, so two stamps.

But if he has two stamps in the 70s, each with different prices, 12,12,6,13. Wait, but that's four countries, each with one stamp. So, if he has two stamps in the 70s, each from two different countries, but that would require two stamps from two countries, each with different prices.

Wait, perhaps in the 70s, he has two countries, each with two stamps. So, two countries, each with two stamps, so four stamps total. Each country has two stamps.

But if he has two countries, each with two stamps, each with different prices, so two countries, each with two stamps, so total four stamps. So, in the 70s, he has four stamps, each from two different countries, each with two stamps.

But the problem is asking for the average price of his 70s stamps, so if in the 70s, he has four stamps, each from a different country, each with different prices: 12,12,6,13. So, the average would be (12 +12 +6 +13)/4 = 43/4 = 10.75, which is 10.8.

Alternatively, maybe in the 70s, he has two countries, each with two stamps, each with two different prices. So, two countries, each with two stamps, each with different prices.

Wait, but the problem labels for the 70s are 12,12,6,13. So, four different prices. So, perhaps in the 70s, he has four different countries, each with one or more stamps, each with a different price.

But since the problem is not specifying how many stamps he has from each country, it's impossible to compute the exact average.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is in the 70s, and the Asymptote code labels for 70s are 12,12,6,13, perhaps each of these is a different country's price in the 70s. So, for each country, he has one 70s stamp, so four countries, each with one 70s stamp, so four stamps in total.

Therefore, the average price would be (12 +12 +6 +13)/4 = 43/4 = 10.75, rounded to 10.8 cents.

But I'm not entirely sure because the problem didn't specify the number of stamps per country. But given the labels in the Asymptote code, it's likely that each label corresponds to a different country in the 70s, so four countries, each with one 70s stamp.

Therefore, I think the answer is 10.8 cents.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{10.8}

Juan's stamps are organized by country and by the decade. The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France at 6 cents each, Peru at 4 cents each, and Spain at 5 cents each. 

To find the average price of his 70s stamps, we need to consider the prices labeled on the Asymptote code for the 70s decade. The labels for the 70s are 12, 12, 6, and 13 cents. These labels correspond to different countries: Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain.

Assuming that each label corresponds to a different country in the 70s decade, we have four different countries each with a different price. Therefore, the average price of the 70s stamps is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average price} = \frac{12 + 12 + 6 + 13}{4} = \frac{43}{4} = 10.75
\]

Rounding 10.75 to the nearest tenth gives 10.8 cents.

\[
\boxed{10.8}
\]
