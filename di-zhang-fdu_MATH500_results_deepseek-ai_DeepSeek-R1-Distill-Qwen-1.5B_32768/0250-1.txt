Question:
The function $f$ satisfies the functional equation
\[f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1\]for all real numbers $x$ and $y.$  If $f(1) = 1,$ then find all integers $n$ such that $f(n) = n.$  Enter all such integers, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
Setting $x = y = 0,$ we get
\[2f(0) = f(0) - 1,\]so $f(0) = -1.$

Setting $y = 1,$ we get
\[f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1,\]so
\[f(x + 1) - f(x) = x + 2.\]Thus,
\begin{align*}
f(2) - f(1) &= 1 + 2, \\
f(3) - f(2) &= 2 + 2, \\
f(4) - f(3) &= 3 + 2, \\
&\dots, \\
f(n) - f(n - 1) &= (n - 1) + 2.
\end{align*}Adding all the equations, we get
\[f(n) - f(1) = 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + (n - 1) + 2(n - 1) = \frac{(n - 1)n}{2} + 2n - 2 = \frac{n^2 + 3n - 4}{2},\]so
\[f(n) = \frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2}\]for all positive integers $n.$

Setting $x = -n$ and $y = n,$ where $n$ is a positive integer, we get
\[f(-n) + f(n) = f(0) + n^2 - 1.\]Then
\[f(-n) = n^2 - f(n) + f(0) - 1 = n^2 - \frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2} - 2 = \frac{n^2 - 3n - 2}{2}.\]Thus, the formula
\[f(n) = \frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2}\]holds for all integers $n.$

We want to solve $f(n) = n,$ or
\[\frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2} = n.\]Then $n^2 + 3n - 2 = 2n,$ or $n^2 + n - 2 = 0.$  This factors as $(n - 1)(n + 2) = 0,$ so the solutions are $n = \boxed{1,-2}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this functional equation problem here. It says that for a function \( f \), the equation \( f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 \) holds for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \). Also, we know that \( f(1) = 1 \). The task is to find all integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \).

Alright, let me start by understanding what kind of function this could be. Functional equations often require us to make educated guesses about the form of the function based on the given conditions. The equation resembles Cauchy's functional equation, which is \( f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) \), but with some extra terms here. So, maybe we can manipulate the given equation to resemble Cauchy's.

First, let's write down the given equation again:

\[ f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 \]

Hmm, if I rearrange this equation to get \( f(x + y) \) in terms of \( f(x) \) and \( f(y) \), that might help. Let's try moving \( xy + 1 \) to the left side:

\[ f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + xy + 1 \]

Wait, actually, let me check that again. If I subtract \( f(x) + f(y) \) from both sides, I get:

\[ 0 = f(x + y) - f(x) - f(y) - xy - 1 \]
\[ f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + xy + 1 \]

Yes, that looks correct. So, \( f(x + y) \) is equal to \( f(x) + f(y) + xy + 1 \). Hmm, that seems a bit more complicated than Cauchy's, but maybe we can find a way to express \( f(x) \) in terms of something additive or multiplicative.

Another approach is to consider if the function is a quadratic function. Quadratic functions often come into play in functional equations because of the \( xy \) term. Let me assume that \( f(x) \) is a quadratic function and see if that works. Let's suppose:

\[ f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \]

Where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants that we need to determine. Let's plug this into our functional equation and see if we can find the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

First, compute \( f(x) + f(y) \):

\[ f(x) + f(y) = ax^2 + bx + c + ay^2 + by + c \]
\[ = a(x^2 + y^2) + b(x + y) + 2c \]

Next, compute \( f(x + y) \):

\[ f(x + y) = a(x + y)^2 + b(x + y) + c \]
\[ = a(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) + b(x + y) + c \]
\[ = a x^2 + 2a xy + a y^2 + b x + b y + c \]

Now, according to the functional equation:

\[ f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 \]

Substituting the expressions we found:

Left-hand side (LHS): \( a(x^2 + y^2) + b(x + y) + 2c \)

Right-hand side (RHS): \( [a x^2 + 2a xy + a y^2 + b x + b y + c] - xy - 1 \)
Simplify RHS:
\( a x^2 + 2a xy + a y^2 + b x + b y + c - xy - 1 \)
Group like terms:
\( a x^2 + a y^2 + (2a - 1)xy + b x + b y + (c - 1) \)

So, setting LHS equal to RHS:

\[ a(x^2 + y^2) + b(x + y) + 2c = a x^2 + a y^2 + (2a - 1)xy + b x + b y + (c - 1) \]

Now, let's subtract RHS from both sides to bring everything to the left:

\[ a(x^2 + y^2) + b(x + y) + 2c - [a x^2 + a y^2 + (2a - 1)xy + b x + b y + (c - 1)] = 0 \]

Simplify term by term:

- \( a x^2 - a x^2 = 0 \)
- \( a y^2 - a y^2 = 0 \)
- \( b x - b x = 0 \)
- \( b y - b y = 0 \)
- \( 2c - (c - 1) = 2c - c + 1 = c + 1 \)
- \( -(2a - 1)xy = -2a xy + xy \)

So, putting it all together:

\[ (-2a + 1)xy + c + 1 = 0 \]

This equation must hold for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \). For the equation \( (-2a + 1)xy + (c + 1) = 0 \) to hold for all \( x \) and \( y \), the coefficients of like terms must be zero.

So, we have two equations:

1. Coefficient of \( xy \): \( -2a + 1 = 0 \)
2. Constant term: \( c + 1 = 0 \)

Solve the first equation for \( a \):

\( -2a + 1 = 0 \)
\( -2a = -1 \)
\( a = \frac{1}{2} \)

Then, solve the second equation for \( c \):

\( c + 1 = 0 \)
\( c = -1 \)

So, we have \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( c = -1 \). The value of \( b \) is still unknown. Let's see if we can find \( b \).

Wait, hold on. In our earlier substitution, we assumed \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \). We found \( a \) and \( c \), but \( b \) remains arbitrary? But we also have the condition \( f(1) = 1 \).

Let me use that condition to find \( b \). Since \( f(1) = 1 \), plugging \( x = 1 \) into \( f(x) \):

\( f(1) = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = a + b + c \)
We know \( a = \frac{1}{2} \), \( c = -1 \), and \( f(1) = 1 \):

So,

\( \frac{1}{2} + b - 1 = 1 \)
Simplify:

\( -\frac{1}{2} + b = 1 \)
\( b = 1 + \frac{1}{2} \)
\( b = \frac{3}{2} \)

So, \( b = \frac{3}{2} \). Therefore, our function is:

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 \]

Wait, let me verify if this function satisfies the original functional equation.

Compute \( f(x) + f(y) \):

\( \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}y - 1 \)
Simplify:
\( \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}(x + y) - 2 \)

Compute \( f(x + y) - xy - 1 \):

\( \frac{1}{2}(x + y)^2 + \frac{3}{2}(x + y) - 1 - xy - 1 \)
Expand \( (x + y)^2 \):
\( \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}(x + y) - 1 - xy - 1 \)
Simplify term by term:
\( \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + xy + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y - 1 - xy - 1 \)
Combine like terms:
- \( \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{2}y^2 \) remains
- \( xy - xy = 0 \)
- \( \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y \) remains
- \( -1 - 1 = -2 \)

So, \( f(x + y) - xy - 1 = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y - 2 \)

Compare with \( f(x) + f(y) \):

\( \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}(x + y) - 2 \)

Yes, they are equal. So, our function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 \) satisfies the functional equation.

Now, we need to find all integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \).

So, set \( f(n) = n \):

\[ \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{3}{2}n - 1 = n \]

Let's solve for \( n \):

First, subtract \( n \) from both sides:

\[ \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{3}{2}n - 1 - n = 0 \]

Simplify the terms:

\( \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \left( \frac{3}{2} - 1 \right) n - 1 = 0 \)
\( \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{1}{2}n - 1 = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fractions:

\( n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \)

Now, solve the quadratic equation \( n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \).

Using the quadratic formula:

\( n = \frac{ -1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8} }{2} = \frac{ -1 \pm 3 }{2} \)

So, the solutions are:

1. \( n = \frac{ -1 + 3 }{2 } = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)
2. \( n = \frac{ -1 - 3 }{2 } = \frac{ -4 }{2 } = -2 \)

So, the integer solutions are \( n = 1 \) and \( n = -2 \).

But wait, hold on, let me verify the solutions because sometimes when we manipulate equations, especially with quadratics, we might introduce extraneous solutions or miss some.

Let's plug \( n = 1 \) into \( f(n) \):

\( f(1) = \frac{1}{2}(1)^2 + \frac{3}{2}(1) - 1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{2} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \). That works.

Now, plug \( n = -2 \):

\( f(-2) = \frac{1}{2}(-2)^2 + \frac{3}{2}(-2) - 1 = \frac{1}{2}(4) + \frac{3}{2}(-2) - 1 = 2 - 3 - 1 = -2 \). That also works.

So both \( n = 1 \) and \( n = -2 \) satisfy \( f(n) = n \).

But wait, let me make sure that these are the only integer solutions. Let's think about the quadratic equation \( n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \). It factors as \( (n + 2)(n - 1) = 0 \), so the solutions are indeed \( n = -2 \) and \( n = 1 \). There are no other integer solutions because the quadratic has degree 2, so it can have at most two real roots, which are integers here.

Therefore, the integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \) are \( 1 \) and \( -2 \).

**Final Answer**
The integers are \boxed{-2} and \boxed{1}.

Wait, hold on, the problem says "find all integers \( n \)" and to enter all such integers separated by commas. So, the final answer should be both -2 and 1 in a single box. However, in the instructions, it says to put the final answer within \boxed{}.

So, maybe I should combine them into one box. So, the integers are -2 and 1, so the answer is \boxed{-2, 1}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-2, 1}

Given the functional equation:
\[ f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 \]
for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), and knowing that \( f(1) = 1 \), we need to find all integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \).

First, we rearrange the given functional equation to express \( f(x + y) \):
\[ f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + xy + 1 \]

We assume \( f(x) \) is a quadratic function of the form:
\[ f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \]

Substituting this into the functional equation and simplifying, we find that:
- The coefficient of \( xy \) gives \( -2a + 1 = 0 \), leading to \( a = \frac{1}{2} \).
- The constant term gives \( c + 1 = 0 \), leading to \( c = -1 \).

Using the condition \( f(1) = 1 \), we find:
\[ \frac{1}{2} + b - 1 = 1 \]
which gives \( b = \frac{3}{2} \).

Thus, the function is:
\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 \]

To find integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \), we solve:
\[ \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{3}{2}n - 1 = n \]
which simplifies to:
\[ n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \]

Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
\[ n = \frac{-1 \pm 3}{2} \]
leading to the solutions \( n = 1 \) and \( n = -2 \).

Thus, the integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \) are:
\[
\boxed{-2, 1}
\]
