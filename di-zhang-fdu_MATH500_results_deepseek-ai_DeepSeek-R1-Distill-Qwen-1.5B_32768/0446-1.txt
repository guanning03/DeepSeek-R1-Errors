Question:
Rectangle $ABCD$ has center $O$ and $AB/AD=k$. A point is randomly chosen from the interior of rectangle $ABCD$. What is the probability that it is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices?  [asy]
size(200);
draw((-250,100)--(250,100)--(250,-100)--(-250,-100)--cycle);
dot((0,0));
label("$O$",(0,0),N);
label("$A$",(-250,100),NW); label("$B$",(250,100),NE); label("$C$",(250,-100),SE); label("$D$",(-250,-100),SW);[/asy]

Correct Answer:
The original rectangle may be subdivided into four smaller congruent rectangles, all sharing $O$ as a vertex. Each of these rectangles is analogous, so we can consider our random point $P$ to be without loss of generality in the smaller rectangle with $A$ as a vertex. All points in this smaller rectangle are closer to $A$ than they are to $B$, $C$, or $D$, so we just need to determine the probability that $OP<AP$. [asy]
size(100);
draw((0,0)--(0,100)--(-250,100)--(-250,0)--cycle);
label("$A$",(-250,100),NW); label("$O$",(0,0),SE);
draw((-105,100)--(-145,0));
fill((-105,100)--(-145,0)--(0,0)--(0,100)--cycle, gray(.7));
[/asy] Since a $180^\circ$ rotation about the center of the smaller rectangle takes $O$ to $A$, it takes the shaded region to the unshaded region. Therefore, exactly half the area is shaded, and the overall probability is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$, independent of $k$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O. The ratio of AB to AD is k, and I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay.

First, let's try to visualize the rectangle. Since it's centered at O, which is at the origin in the Asymptote code, it must be symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis. So, AB and AD must be the lengths of the sides, with AB being the length and AD being the width. The ratio AB/AD is k, so AB = k * AD.

Let me assign some coordinates to make this clearer. Let's assume the rectangle has dimensions AB = 2a and AD = 2b, so that the center O is at (0,0). Then, the rectangle will extend from (-a, -b) to (a, b). That way, AB is the horizontal side with length 2a, and AD is the vertical side with length 2b.

So, the rectangle has vertices at A=(-a, b), B=(a, b), C=(a, -b), and D=(-a, -b). The center O is at (0,0).

Now, the problem is to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Since the point is chosen randomly, the probability will be the area of the region where the distance to O is less than the distance to any vertex, divided by the total area of the rectangle.

So, mathematically, the probability P is equal to (Area of region where distance to O < distance to any vertex) divided by (Area of rectangle ABCD).

Okay, so I need to find the area where a point (x, y) satisfies the condition that the distance from (x, y) to O is less than the distance from (x, y) to each of the four vertices A, B, C, D.

Let me recall the distance formula. The distance from a point (x, y) to O is sqrt(x² + y²). The distance to vertex A is sqrt((x + a)² + (y - b)²), to vertex B is sqrt((x - a)² + (y - b)²), to vertex C is sqrt((x - a)² + (y + b)²), and to vertex D is sqrt((x + a)² + (y + b)²).

So, the condition is that sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x ± a)² + (y ± b)²), for all four combinations of signs. Since all four inequalities must be satisfied, I need to find the region where all four are true.

Wait, but is that the correct approach? Because for a point to be closer to O than to any vertex, it must be closer to O than to each vertex individually. So, actually, I need to find the intersection of the regions where sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + a)² + (y - b)²), sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x - a)² + (y - b)²), sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x - a)² + (y + b)²), and sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + a)² + (y + b)²).

But maybe it's easier to find the region where the distance to O is less than the distance to each vertex, but perhaps there is symmetry here. Let me think about each vertex.

Let me consider the four inequalities one by one.

1. Distance to O < Distance to A:
sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + a)² + (y - b)²)
Squaring both sides: x² + y² < (x + a)² + (y - b)²
Expanding the right-hand side: x² + 2ax + a² + y² - 2by + b²
Subtracting x² + y² from both sides: 0 < 2ax + a² - 2by + b²
Simplify: 2ax + a² - 2by + b² > 0

Similarly, let's do the same for the other vertices.

2. Distance to O < Distance to B:
sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x - a)² + (y - b)²)
Squaring both sides: x² + y² < (x - a)² + (y - b)²
Expanding: x² - 2ax + a² + y² - 2by + b²
Subtract x² + y²: 0 < -2ax + a² - 2by + b²
Simplify: -2ax + a² - 2by + b² > 0

3. Distance to O < Distance to C:
sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x - a)² + (y + b)²)
Squaring: x² + y² < (x - a)² + (y + b)²
Expanding: x² - 2ax + a² + y² + 2by + b²
Subtract x² + y²: 0 < -2ax + a² + 2by + b²
Simplify: -2ax + a² + 2by + b² > 0

4. Distance to O < Distance to D:
sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + a)² + (y + b)²)
Squaring: x² + y² < (x + a)² + (y + b)²
Expanding: x² + 2ax + a² + y² + 2by + b²
Subtract x² + y²: 0 < 2ax + a² + 2by + b²
Simplify: 2ax + a² + 2by + b² > 0

So, now I have four inequalities:

1. 2ax + a² - 2by + b² > 0
2. -2ax + a² - 2by + b² > 0
3. -2ax + a² + 2by + b² > 0
4. 2ax + a² + 2by + b² > 0

These four inequalities define regions in the plane where the point (x, y) is closer to O than to each vertex. The intersection of these regions is the set of points that satisfy all four conditions, meaning they are closer to O than to any vertex.

Therefore, to find the area, I need to find the region where all four inequalities are satisfied.

But solving these inequalities seems a bit complicated, so maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, I recall that the set of points equidistant to O and a vertex is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining O and that vertex. So, the region closer to O than to a vertex is on one side of the bisector, and closer to the vertex than the other side.

So, perhaps I can find the equations of these bisectors and then find the intersection of the regions.

Let's try that.

First, the bisector between O(0,0) and A(-a, b). The midpoint between O and A is (-a/2, b/2), and the slope of OA is (b - 0)/(-a - 0) = -b/a. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector will have a slope of a/b.

So, the equation of the bisector is y - b/2 = (a/b)(x + a/2).

Simplify: y = (a/b)x + (a/b)(a/2) + b/2 = (a/b)x + a²/(2b) + b/2.

Similarly, for vertex B(a, b), the midpoint is (a/2, b/2), and the slope of OB is (b - 0)/(a - 0) = b/a. So, the perpendicular bisector has slope -a/b.

Equation: y - b/2 = (-a/b)(x - a/2)

Simplify: y = (-a/b)x + (a/b)(a/2) + b/2 = (-a/b)x + a²/(2b) + b/2.

Similarly, for vertex C(a, -b), midpoint is (a/2, -b/2), slope of OC is (-b)/a, so perpendicular bisector slope is a/b.

Equation: y + b/2 = (a/b)(x - a/2)

Simplify: y = (a/b)x - (a/b)(a/2) - b/2 = (a/b)x - a²/(2b) - b/2.

Similarly, for vertex D(-a, b), midpoint is (-a/2, b/2), slope of OD is (b - 0)/(-a - 0) = -b/a, so perpendicular bisector slope is a/b.

Equation: y - b/2 = (a/b)(x + a/2)

Simplify: y = (a/b)x + (a/b)(a/2) + b/2 = (a/b)x + a²/(2b) + b/2.

Wait, so the four bisectors are:

1. y = (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)
2. y = (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)
3. y = (a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)
4. y = (-a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)

Wait, hold on. Let me recast the equations:

For vertex A: y = (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)

For vertex B: y = (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)

For vertex C: y = (a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)

For vertex D: y = (-a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)

Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check.

For vertex A(-a, b):

Midpoint: (-a/2, b/2)

Slope of OA: (b - 0)/(-a - 0) = -b/a

Perpendicular bisector slope: a/b

Equation: y - b/2 = (a/b)(x + a/2)

So, y = (a/b)x + (a²)/(2b) + b/2

Similarly for vertex B(a, b):

Midpoint: (a/2, b/2)

Slope of OB: b/a

Perpendicular bisector slope: -a/b

Equation: y - b/2 = (-a/b)(x - a/2)

Which is y = (-a/b)x + (a²)/(2b) + b/2

Vertex C(a, -b):

Midpoint: (a/2, -b/2)

Slope of OC: (-b)/a

Perpendicular bisector slope: a/b

Equation: y + b/2 = (a/b)(x - a/2)

So, y = (a/b)x - (a²)/(2b) - b/2

Vertex D(-a, b):

Midpoint: (-a/2, b/2)

Slope of OD: (b - 0)/(-a - 0) = -b/a

Perpendicular bisector slope: a/b

Equation: y - b/2 = (a/b)(x + a/2)

Which is y = (a/b)x + (a²)/(2b) + b/2

So, that seems consistent.

So, the four bisectors are:

1. y = (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)
2. y = (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)
3. y = (a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)
4. y = (-a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)

So, these four lines divide the plane into regions.

Each region corresponds to being closer to a particular vertex or the center.

So, the region where a point is closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions defined by:

1. y < (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b) (closer to A)
2. y < (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b) (closer to B)
3. y < (a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b) (closer to C)
4. y < (-a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b) (closer to D)

Wait, no. Actually, each inequality corresponds to being closer to O than to that vertex. So, for example, the region closer to O than to A is y < (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b), and similarly for the others.

Therefore, the region we're interested in is the intersection of all four regions: y < (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b), y < (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b), y < (a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b), and y < (-a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b).

So, this region is the intersection of the four half-planes defined by these four lines.

Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but maybe there's a pattern here.

Alternatively, perhaps the region is a polygon where all four inequalities are satisfied.

Alternatively, given the symmetry of the rectangle and the problem, maybe the region is a smaller rectangle or another polygon.

But perhaps it's easier to find the intersection points of these bisectors to find the vertices of the region.

So, to find the boundaries of the region, I need to find the intersection points of each pair of bisectors.

So, let's find where each bisector intersects with the others.

First, find the intersection of bisectors 1 and 2.

Bisector 1: y = (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)

Bisector 2: y = (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)

Set them equal:

(a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b) = (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)

Subtract (a² + b²)/(2b) from both sides:

(a/b)x = (-a/b)x

Bring terms together:

(a/b)x + (a/b)x = 0

(2a/b)x = 0

So, x = 0

Then, plugging back into one of the equations, say bisector 1:

y = (a/b)(0) + (a² + b²)/(2b) = (a² + b²)/(2b)

So, intersection point is (0, (a² + b²)/(2b))

Similarly, find intersection of bisector 1 and bisector 3.

Bisector 1: y = (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)

Bisector 3: y = (a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)

Set them equal:

(a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b) = (a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)

Subtract (a/b)x:

(a² + b²)/(2b) = - (a² + b²)/(2b)

Multiply both sides by 2b:

(a² + b²) = - (a² + b²)

Which implies 2(a² + b²) = 0 => a² + b² = 0

But a and b are positive lengths, so this is impossible. Therefore, these two bisectors are parallel? Wait, let's check the slopes.

Bisectors 1 and 3 both have slope a/b, so they are parallel. Similarly, bisectors 2 and 4 are parallel with slope -a/b.

Therefore, in the plane, the four bisectors form a diamond shape, each pair of opposite bisectors being parallel and equidistant from the center O.

So, the region closer to O is the intersection of the four half-planes, which is the area bounded by these four bisectors. This should be a convex polygon, perhaps a quadrilateral or a hexagon.

Wait, but considering the rectangle, the region might be a smaller rectangle or another quadrilateral.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a rotated rectangle or another shape.

Wait, maybe I can find all the intersection points of these bisectors within the rectangle.

So, let's find all the intersection points of the bisectors within the rectangle.

We already found the intersection of bisectors 1 and 2 at (0, (a² + b²)/(2b)).

Similarly, let's find the intersection of bisectors 1 and 4.

Bisector 1: y = (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)

Bisector 4: y = (-a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)

Set them equal:

(a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b) = (-a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)

Bring all terms to one side:

(a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b) + (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b) = 0

(2a/b)x + (a² + b²)/b = 0

Multiply both sides by b:

2a x + a² + b² = 0

So, 2a x = - (a² + b²)

x = - (a² + b²)/(2a)

Plugging back into bisector 1:

y = (a/b)( - (a² + b²)/(2a) ) + (a² + b²)/(2b) = - (a² + b²)/(2b) + (a² + b²)/(2b) = 0

So, intersection point is ( - (a² + b²)/(2a), 0 )

Similarly, find intersection of bisectors 2 and 3.

Bisector 2: y = (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)

Bisector 3: y = (a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)

Set equal:

(-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b) = (a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)

Bring terms together:

(-a/b)x - (a/b)x = - (a² + b²)/(2b) - (a² + b²)/(2b)

(-2a/b)x = - (a² + b²)/b

Multiply both sides by b:

-2a x = - (a² + b²)

Divide both sides by -2a:

x = (a² + b²)/(2a)

Then, substituting back into bisector 2:

y = (-a/b)( (a² + b²)/(2a) ) + (a² + b²)/(2b) = - (a² + b²)/(2b) + (a² + b²)/(2b) = 0

So, intersection point is ( (a² + b²)/(2a), 0 )

Similarly, let's find the intersection of bisectors 1 and 3.

Wait, but earlier we saw that they are parallel, so they don't intersect unless extended. Similarly, bisectors 2 and 4 are parallel.

So, in the rectangle, the region bounded by these bisectors would form a polygon with vertices at the intersection points of the bisectors with the rectangle's sides.

So, the four bisectors intersect the sides of the rectangle at four points:

1. Bisector 1: y = (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b). Let's find where this intersects the top and bottom sides of the rectangle y = b and y = -b.

Set y = b:

b = (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)

Multiply both sides by 2b:

2b² = 2a x + a² + b²

So, 2b² - b² = 2a x + a²

b² = 2a x + a²

2a x = b² - a²

x = (b² - a²)/(2a)

Similarly, set y = -b:

- b = (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)

Multiply both sides by 2b:

-2b² = 2a x + a² + b²

-2b² - b² = 2a x + a²

-3b² = 2a x + a²

2a x = -3b² - a²

x = (-3b² - a²)/(2a)

But since in the rectangle, x ranges from -a to a, we need to check if these x-values are within [-a, a].

Let me compute (b² - a²)/(2a):

If b² > a², then x is positive, which is within the rectangle.

If b² < a², x is negative, which is also within the rectangle.

Similarly, for x = (-3b² - a²)/(2a), since both terms are negative, x is negative, which is within the rectangle.

So, these intersection points are valid.

Therefore, bisector 1 intersects the top side at ( (b² - a²)/(2a), b ) and the bottom side at ( (-3b² - a²)/(2a), -b ).

Similarly, bisector 2: y = (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b). Let's find its intersections with the top and bottom sides.

Set y = b:

b = (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)

Multiply both sides by 2b:

2b² = -2a x + a² + b²

2b² - b² = -2a x + a²

b² = -2a x + a²

2a x = a² - b²

x = (a² - b²)/(2a)

Similarly, set y = -b:

- b = (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b)

Multiply both sides by 2b:

-2b² = -2a x + a² + b²

-2b² - b² = -2a x + a²

-3b² = -2a x + a²

2a x = a² + 3b²

x = (a² + 3b²)/(2a)

So, bisector 2 intersects top side at ( (a² - b²)/(2a), b ) and bottom side at ( (a² + 3b²)/(2a), -b )

Similarly, bisector 3: y = (a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b). Let's find intersections with top and bottom sides.

Set y = b:

b = (a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)

Multiply both sides by 2b:

2b² = 2a x - a² - b²

2b² + a² + b² = 2a x

3b² + a² = 2a x

x = (3b² + a²)/(2a)

Set y = -b:

- b = (a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)

Multiply both sides by 2b:

-2b² = 2a x - a² - b²

-2b² + b² = 2a x - a²

- b² = 2a x - a²

2a x = a² - b²

x = (a² - b²)/(2a)

So, bisector 3 intersects top side at ( (3b² + a²)/(2a), b ) and bottom side at ( (a² - b²)/(2a), -b )

Similarly, bisector 4: y = (-a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b). Let's find intersections with top and bottom sides.

Set y = b:

b = (-a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)

Multiply both sides by 2b:

2b² = -2a x - a² - b²

2b² + a² + b² = -2a x

3b² + a² = -2a x

x = - (3b² + a²)/(2a)

Set y = -b:

- b = (-a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b)

Multiply both sides by 2b:

-2b² = -2a x - a² - b²

-2b² + b² = -2a x - a²

- b² = -2a x - a²

2a x = -a² + b²

x = ( -a² + b² ) / (2a )

So, bisector 4 intersects top side at ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a), b ) and bottom side at ( (b² - a²)/(2a), -b )

So, putting all these intersection points together, within the rectangle, the region where a point is closer to O than to any vertex is bounded by these lines.

Wait, but since we have four bisectors, each pair of which is parallel, the region defined by all four inequalities is a convex polygon with four vertices, each at the intersection of two bisectors with the rectangle's sides.

Therefore, the region is a convex quadrilateral with four vertices:

1. Intersection of bisector 1 and top side: ( (b² - a²)/(2a), b )
2. Intersection of bisector 2 and top side: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), b )
3. Intersection of bisector 3 and bottom side: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), -b )
4. Intersection of bisector 4 and bottom side: ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a), -b )

Wait, but actually, in the rectangle, the region closer to O is a polygon with these four vertices.

Wait, let me think again. Each bisector is cutting through the rectangle, but perhaps the region is a hexagon. Alternatively, maybe it's a quadrilateral.

Wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, the rectangle is drawn from (-250,100) to (250,100) to (250,-100) to (-250,-100), so it's a rectangle centered at O with width 500 and height 200.

But in our general problem, the rectangle has AB = 2a and AD = 2b, so the width is 2a and height is 2b.

So, in the Asymptote code, the rectangle is from (-250,100) to (250,100) to (250,-100) to (-250,-100). So, in that case, a=250 and b=100, so the rectangle is 500 units wide and 200 units tall.

But in our problem, the rectangle is arbitrary, so I think we need to generalize.

But in any case, going back, the region closer to O is a quadrilateral with four vertices:

1. ( (b² - a²)/(2a), b )
2. ( (a² - b²)/(2a), b )
3. ( (a² - b²)/(2a), -b )
4. ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a), -b )

But wait, actually, these points might not all be correct. Wait, let me compute each coordinate:

1. Intersection of bisector 1 and top side: x = (b² - a²)/(2a), y = b

2. Intersection of bisector 2 and top side: x = (a² - b²)/(2a), y = b

3. Intersection of bisector 3 and bottom side: x = (a² - b²)/(2a), y = -b

4. Intersection of bisector 4 and bottom side: x = - (3b² + a²)/(2a), y = -b

Wait, but hold on, are these four points the vertices of the region? Or is the region a pentagon or something else?

Wait, perhaps the region is a convex polygon with four vertices, each at one of these intersection points.

But let me think about the shape.

From the rectangle, if we have these four intersection points, it's possible that the region is a quadrilateral, but perhaps it's a hexagon if the bisectors intersect the sides more than once.

But in reality, each bisector only intersects the top and bottom sides once each, so in the rectangle, we have four points, which could form a quadrilateral.

Wait, but if I plot these four points:

1. ( (b² - a²)/(2a), b )
2. ( (a² - b²)/(2a), b )
3. ( (a² - b²)/(2a), -b )
4. ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a), -b )

Wait, points 1 and 2 have the same y-coordinate and lie on the top side. Similarly, points 3 and 4 have the same y-coordinate and lie on the bottom side.

So, connecting these points, the region is a quadrilateral symmetric about both axes.

But let me see if the lines between these points are straight.

Wait, the region is bounded above by the bisector 1 and 3, and below by bisector 2 and 4.

Wait, no, actually, the region is the intersection of the half-planes defined by the four bisectors.

So, it's bounded above by the bisectors 1 and 3 (which are two parallel lines) and below by the bisectors 2 and 4 (which are also two parallel lines). But since they're parallel, the region is actually a parallelogram.

Wait, is that right?

Wait, if you have two parallel lines above and two parallel lines below, their intersection is a parallelogram.

So, in our case, the region closer to O is a parallelogram with vertices at:

1. Intersection of bisector 1 and bisector 2: (0, (a² + b²)/(2b))

2. Intersection of bisector 1 and bisector 3: ( (b² - a²)/(2a), b )

3. Intersection of bisector 2 and bisector 4: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), -b )

4. Intersection of bisector 3 and bisector 4: ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a), -b )

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the intersection of bisector 1 and bisector 3 is a point, and similarly for the others.

Wait, perhaps my initial conclusion is wrong, and the region is actually a quadrilateral with four vertices at the four intersection points.

Alternatively, perhaps the region is a hexagon.

Wait, let me try to plot these points.

Take a specific case where a = b, so the rectangle is a square.

In this case, a = b, so let's see:

1. ( (a² - a²)/(2a), a ) = (0, a )

2. ( (a² - a²)/(2a), -a ) = (0, -a )

3. ( (a² - a²)/(2a), -a ) = (0, -a )

4. ( - (3a² + a²)/(2a), -a ) = ( -4a/2, -a ) = (-2a, -a )

Wait, but in this case, points 1 and 2 are both at (0, a) and (0, -a). But that can't be, unless I made a mistake.

Wait, no, if a = b, then in bisector 1: y = (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b) becomes y = x + (a² + a²)/(2a) = x + a

Similarly, bisector 3: y = (a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b) becomes y = x - a

Similarly, bisector 2: y = (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2b) becomes y = -x + a

Bisector 4: y = (-a/b)x - (a² + b²)/(2b) becomes y = -x - a

So, in the case of a = b, the four bisectors are:

1. y = x + a

2. y = -x + a

3. y = x - a

4. y = -x - a

These are four lines intersecting in the center at O(0,0), and forming a diamond.

Wait, so in this case, the region closer to O is the intersection of the four half-planes defined by these lines.

Which would be a square rotated by 45 degrees, inscribed within the original rectangle.

But in the specific case when a = b, the intersection would be a square.

Wait, but in this case, the intersection region is a square with vertices at (a, 0), (0, a), (-a, 0), and (0, -a). But in our rectangle, which is from (-a, -a) to (a, a), the intersection region is a square of side length sqrt(2) a.

Wait, but in this case, the area closer to O would be the area of the square, which is 2a².

But the area of the whole rectangle is 4a², so the probability would be 2a² / 4a² = 1/2.

But let me verify.

Wait, in the specific case of a = b, the intersection region closer to O is a square centered at O, with side length sqrt(2) a, so area 2a², which is half of the rectangle's area (4a²). So, in that case, the probability is 1/2.

But wait, in the case when a ≠ b, does this still hold? Let me try with specific numbers.

Let me take a = 2, b = 1.

So, a rectangle of width 4 and height 2.

So, the four bisectors are:

1. y = (2/1)x + (4 + 1)/2 = 2x + 2.5

2. y = (-2/1)x + (4 + 1)/2 = -2x + 2.5

3. y = (2/1)x - (4 + 1)/2 = 2x - 2.5

4. y = (-2/1)x - (4 + 1)/2 = -2x - 2.5

So, bisector 1: y = 2x + 2.5

Bisector 2: y = -2x + 2.5

Bisector 3: y = 2x - 2.5

Bisector 4: y = -2x - 2.5

Now, find the intersection points within the rectangle.

For bisector 1 and bisector 2:

Set 2x + 2.5 = -2x + 2.5 => 4x = 0 => x = 0, y = 2.5

But in the rectangle, y = 2.5 is outside the rectangle (since the height is 2). So, this intersection is outside.

Similarly, for bisector 1 and bisector 3:

Set 2x + 2.5 = 2x - 2.5 => 2.5 = -2.5, which is impossible. So, no intersection.

For bisector 1 and bisector 4:

Set 2x + 2.5 = -2x - 2.5 => 4x = -5 => x = -1.25

Then y = 2*(-1.25) + 2.5 = -2.5 + 2.5 = 0

So, intersection point is (-1.25, 0)

Similarly, bisector 2 and bisector 3:

Set -2x + 2.5 = 2x - 2.5 => -4x = -5 => x = 1.25

Then y = -2*(1.25) + 2.5 = -2.5 + 2.5 = 0

So, intersection point is (1.25, 0)

Bisector 2 and bisector 4:

Set -2x + 2.5 = -2x - 2.5 => 2.5 = -2.5, impossible.

Bisector 3 and bisector 4:

Set 2x - 2.5 = -2x - 2.5 => 4x = 0 => x = 0

Then y = -2.5

So, intersection point is (0, -2.5)

So, within the rectangle, the bisectors intersect the top side at:

Bisector 1 intersects top side y = 2 at x = (2² - 1²)/(2*2) = (4 - 1)/4 = 3/4, so (3/4, 2)

Bisector 2 intersects top side y = 2 at x = (1² - 2²)/(2*2) = (1 - 4)/4 = -3/4, so (-3/4, 2)

Similarly, bisector 3 intersects bottom side y = -1 at x = (1² - 2²)/(2*2) = (1 - 4)/4 = -3/4, so (-3/4, -1)

Bisector 4 intersects bottom side y = -1 at x = (2² - 1²)/(2*2) = (4 - 1)/4 = 3/4, so (3/4, -1)

So, the four intersection points within the rectangle are:

1. (3/4, 2)

2. (-3/4, 2)

3. (-3/4, -1)

4. (3/4, -1)

So, these are the four vertices of the region where a point is closer to O than to any vertex.

Now, let's plot these points:

(3/4, 2), (-3/4, 2), (-3/4, -1), (3/4, -1)

Connecting these points, we get a quadrilateral symmetric about both axes.

To find the area of this quadrilateral, we can use the shoelace formula.

Coordinates in order: Let's take (3/4, 2), (3/4, -1), (-3/4, -1), (-3/4, 2), and back to (3/4, 2).

Wait, actually, the quadrilateral is a rectangle? Because all sides are vertical and horizontal.

Wait, no, because the sides are not axis-aligned. Let me compute the sides.

Wait, actually, connecting (3/4, 2) to (3/4, -1) is a vertical line segment, but that can't be, because the other sides would be slanting.

Wait, no, actually, no. Because in the rectangle, the region is bounded by the bisectors, which are lines.

Wait, perhaps the shape is a trapezoid.

Wait, let me compute the area using the shoelace formula.

Shoelace formula: For coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ..., (xn,yn), area is |1/2 * sum_{i=1 to n} (xi*yi+1 - xi+1*yi)|

So, let's list the coordinates in order:

1. (3/4, 2)

2. (3/4, -1)

3. (-3/4, -1)

4. (-3/4, 2)

Back to (3/4, 2)

Compute the sum:

(3/4)*(-1) + (3/4)*(-1) + (-3/4)*(2) + (-3/4)*(2) - [ (2)*(3/4) + (-1)*(-3/4) + (-1)*(-3/4) + (2)*(3/4) ]

Wait, hold on, perhaps better to compute term by term.

Compute each term xi*yi+1 - xi+1*yi:

Between (3/4, 2) and (3/4, -1):

(3/4)*(-1) - (3/4)*(2) = (-3/4) - (6/4) = -9/4

Between (3/4, -1) and (-3/4, -1):

(3/4)*(-1) - (-3/4)*(-1) = (-3/4) - (3/4) = -6/4 = -3/2

Between (-3/4, -1) and (-3/4, 2):

(-3/4)*(2) - (-3/4)*(-1) = (-6/4) - (3/4) = -9/4

Between (-3/4, 2) and (3/4, 2):

(-3/4)*(2) - (3/4)*(2) = (-6/4) - (6/4) = -12/4 = -3

So, total sum is (-9/4) + (-3/2) + (-9/4) + (-3) = (-9/4 - 6/4 - 9/4 - 12/4) = (-36/4) = -9

Take absolute value and multiply by 1/2: | -9 | * 1/2 = 9/2

So, area is 9/2.

Wait, but in our case, the rectangle's area is 4a*2b = 8ab, but in this specific case with a=2, b=1, area is 8*2*1 = 16.

Wait, but our shoelace formula gave us 9/2, which is 4.5. But the rectangle is 16, so the area closer to O is 4.5, which is 9/2.

Wait, but 9/2 is 4.5, and the area of the rectangle is 16. So, the probability is 4.5 / 16 = 9/32.

But in the specific case when a = b, the area closer to O was 2a², which for a=2 is 8, and the total area is 16, so probability is 8/16 = 1/2.

So, in the case when a = b, the probability is 1/2, and in the case when a ≠ b, specifically a=2, b=1, the probability is 9/32.

Therefore, the probability is not 1/2 unless a = b.

So, in the general case, the area closer to O is a quadrilateral with four vertices as found above.

So, to find the area of this quadrilateral, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry or find a general formula.

Alternatively, maybe the area can be found by subtracting the areas of the four corner regions from the total area of the rectangle.

Wait, in the specific case when a = 2, b = 1, the area closer to O was 9/2, which is 4.5, and the total area is 16, so 4.5 is less than half.

Wait, so perhaps in the general case, the area closer to O is a function of a and b.

Wait, but perhaps I can find a general formula.

Given that, let me try to find the coordinates of the four vertices of the region closer to O.

From the previous general case, the four vertices are:

1. ( (b² - a²)/(2a), b )

2. ( (a² - b²)/(2a), b )

3. ( (a² - b²)/(2a), -b )

4. ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a), -b )

So, in general, the four vertices are:

V1: ( (b² - a²)/(2a), b )

V2: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), b )

V3: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), -b )

V4: ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a), -b )

So, these points form a quadrilateral.

Now, to compute the area of this quadrilateral, we can use the shoelace formula.

So, first, let's list the coordinates in order:

V1: ( (b² - a²)/(2a), b )

V2: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), b )

V3: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), -b )

V4: ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a), -b )

And back to V1.

So, let's compute the shoelace sum.

Compute each term xi*yi+1 - xi+1*yi:

Between V1 and V2:

x1 = (b² - a²)/(2a), y1 = b

x2 = (a² - b²)/(2a), y2 = b

Term1 = x1*y2 - x2*y1 = (b² - a²)/(2a)*b - (a² - b²)/(2a)*b

Simplify:

= [ (b³ - a² b) - (a² b - b³) ] / (2a)

= (b³ - a² b - a² b + b³) / (2a)

= (2b³ - 2a² b) / (2a)

= (b³ - a² b)/a

Similarly, between V2 and V3:

x2 = (a² - b²)/(2a), y2 = b

x3 = (a² - b²)/(2a), y3 = -b

Term2 = x2*y3 - x3*y2 = (a² - b²)/(2a)*(-b) - (a² - b²)/(2a)*b

Simplify:

= - [ (a² - b²) b ] / (2a) - [ (a² - b²) b ] / (2a )

= -2*(a² - b²)*b / (2a )

= - (a² - b²)*b / a

Between V3 and V4:

x3 = (a² - b²)/(2a), y3 = -b

x4 = - (3b² + a²)/(2a), y4 = -b

Term3 = x3*y4 - x4*y3 = (a² - b²)/(2a)*(-b) - ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a))*(-b )

Simplify:

= - (a² - b²) b / (2a ) - (3b² + a²) b / (2a )

= [ - (a² - b²) b - (3b² + a²) b ] / (2a )

= [ -a² b + b³ - 3b³ - a² b ] / (2a )

= [ -2a² b - 2b³ ] / (2a )

= - (a² b + b³ ) / a

Between V4 and V1:

x4 = - (3b² + a²)/(2a), y4 = -b

x1 = (b² - a²)/(2a), y1 = b

Term4 = x4*y1 - x1*y4 = - (3b² + a²)/(2a)*b - (b² - a²)/(2a)*(-b )

Simplify:

= - (3b² + a²) b / (2a ) + (b² - a²) b / (2a )

= [ -3b³ - a² b + b³ - a² b ] / (2a )

= [ -2b³ - 2a² b ] / (2a )

= - (b³ + a² b ) / a

So, now, sum up all terms:

Term1 + Term2 + Term3 + Term4 =

[ (b³ - a² b)/a ] + [ - (a² - b²) b / a ] + [ - (a² b + b³ ) / a ] + [ - (a² b + b³ ) / a ]

Simplify each term:

Term1: (b³ - a² b)/a

Term2: - (a² - b²) b / a = (-a² b + b³)/a

Term3: - (a² b + b³)/a

Term4: - (a² b + b³)/a

So, combining all:

= [ (b³ - a² b ) + (-a² b + b³ ) + (-a² b - b³ ) + (-a² b - b³ ) ] / a

Compute numerator:

b³ - a² b - a² b + b³ - a² b - b³ - a² b - b³

Combine like terms:

b³ + b³ - b³ - b³ = 0

- a² b - a² b - a² b - a² b = -4a² b

So, numerator is -4a² b

Thus, shoelace sum is (-4a² b ) / a = -4a b

Take absolute value and multiply by 1/2:

Area = | -4a b | * 1/2 = 2a b

So, the area closer to O is 2a b. Therefore, the probability is 2a b divided by the area of the rectangle, which is 2a * 2b = 4a b.

Therefore, probability is (2a b) / (4a b) = 1/2.

Wait, but in the specific case when a = 2, b = 1, the area closer to O was 9/2, but according to this, it should be 2a b = 4. But 4 is not equal to 9/2.

Wait, that suggests an error in my calculation.

Wait, no, in the specific case when a = 2, b = 1, the rectangle is 4 units in width and 2 units in height, so area 8. The area computed by shoelace was 4.5, which is less than 8.

But according to the general formula, area closer to O is 2a b = 4, but in reality, in the specific case, it's 4.5, which is 9/2, not 4. So, the formula must be incorrect.

Wait, so perhaps my general approach is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the shoelace formula.

Wait, let me check the shoelace computation again.

Wait, wait, the four points in order are:

V1: ( (b² - a²)/(2a), b )

V2: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), b )

V3: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), -b )

V4: ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a), -b )

So, listing them in order:

V1, V2, V3, V4, V1.

Compute each term:

1. x1*y2 - x2*y1:

= ( (b² - a²)/(2a) )*b - ( (a² - b²)/(2a) )*b

= [ (b³ - a² b) - (a² b - b³) ] / (2a )

= (b³ - a² b - a² b + b³ ) / (2a )

= (2b³ - 2a² b) / (2a )

= (b³ - a² b)/a

2. x2*y3 - x3*y2:

= ( (a² - b²)/(2a) )*(-b) - ( (a² - b²)/(2a) )*b

= [ - (a² - b²) b - (a² - b²) b ] / (2a )

= [ -2(a² - b²)b ] / (2a )

= - (a² - b²) b / a

3. x3*y4 - x4*y3:

= ( (a² - b²)/(2a) )*(-b) - ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a) )*(-b )

= [ - (a² - b²) b - (3b² + a²) b ] / (2a )

= [ -a² b + b³ - 3b³ - a² b ] / (2a )

= [ -2a² b - 2b³ ] / (2a )

= - (a² b + b³ ) / a

4. x4*y1 - x1*y4:

= ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a) )*b - ( (b² - a²)/(2a) )*(-b )

= [ - (3b² + a²) b + (b² - a²) b ] / (2a )

= [ -3b³ - a² b + b³ - a² b ] / (2a )

= [ -2b³ - 2a² b ] / (2a )

= - (b³ + a² b ) / a

So, all four terms:

1. (b³ - a² b)/a

2. - (a² - b²) b / a

3. - (a² b + b³ ) / a

4. - (b³ + a² b ) / a

Now, adding them together:

= [ (b³ - a² b) + (-a² b + b³) + (-a² b - b³) + (-b³ - a² b) ] / a

Compute numerator:

b³ - a² b - a² b + b³ - a² b - b³ - b³ - a² b

= (b³ + b³ - b³ - b³) + (-a² b - a² b - a² b - a² b )

= 0 + (-4a² b )

Thus, numerator is -4a² b, so total sum is (-4a² b ) / a = -4a b.

So, the shoelace sum is -4a b, and the area is | -4a b | / 2 = 2a b.

But in the specific case a = 2, b = 1, this would be 2*2*1 = 4. However, when I computed via coordinates, I got 4.5. So, discrepancy.

Wait, but actually, in my specific case, the shoelace formula is giving me 4, but the actual area closer to O was 4.5. So, that means I must have made a mistake in the coordinates.

Wait, no, let me check the coordinates.

Wait, in the specific case, a = 2, b = 1. So, the rectangle has vertices at (±2, ±1). The bisectors are lines:

1. y = (2/1)x + (4 + 1)/2 = 2x + 2.5

2. y = (-2/1)x + (4 + 1)/2 = -2x + 2.5

3. y = (2/1)x - (4 + 1)/2 = 2x - 2.5

4. y = (-2/1)x - (4 + 1)/2 = -2x - 2.5

So, the four bisectors.

Now, let's find the intersection points of these bisectors with the rectangle.

First, the bisector 1: y = 2x + 2.5

It intersects the top side y = 1 at x = (1 - 2.5)/2 = (-1.5)/2 = -0.75. So, point (-0.75, 1)

Similarly, bisector 3: y = 2x - 2.5

It intersects the bottom side y = -1 at x = ( -1 + 2.5 ) / 2 = 1.5 / 2 = 0.75. So, point (0.75, -1)

Similarly, bisector 2: y = -2x + 2.5

It intersects the top side y = 1 at x = (1 - 2.5)/(-2) = (-1.5)/(-2) = 0.75. So, point (0.75, 1)

Bisector 4: y = -2x - 2.5

It intersects the bottom side y = -1 at x = ( -1 + 2.5 ) / (-2) = 1.5 / (-2) = -0.75. So, point (-0.75, -1)

So, the four intersection points within the rectangle are:

1. (-0.75, 1)

2. (0.75, 1)

3. (0.75, -1)

4. (-0.75, -1)

Therefore, the region is a rectangle with vertices at (-0.75, 1), (0.75, 1), (0.75, -1), (-0.75, -1). So, it's a rectangle with length 1.5 (from -0.75 to 0.75) and height 2.

Wait, but in reality, the region is also bounded by the bisectors 1 and 3, which are the lines y = 2x + 2.5 and y = 2x - 2.5, which are not horizontal or vertical. Wait, so the region is a diamond shape (rotated square) inside the rectangle.

Wait, but according to my previous calculation using the shoelace formula, the area is 2a b = 2*2*1 = 4, but in reality, in the specific case, it's 4.5.

Wait, but in the specific case, the area is a rectangle with length 1.5 (from -0.75 to 0.75) and height 2, so area is 1.5 * 2 = 3.

Wait, but wait, in reality, the region is a quadrilateral, which in this specific case, the shoelace formula gave me 4.5, but the actual area is 3.

Wait, so there must be a mistake in my general formula.

Wait, perhaps the shoelace formula is not correctly applied because the four points I found are just four points, but the region is not a convex quadrilateral.

Wait, no, in the specific case, the four intersection points are the four vertices of the region. So, in the specific case, the region is a convex quadrilateral with vertices at (-0.75, 1), (0.75, 1), (0.75, -1), (-0.75, -1).

Wait, but in reality, connecting these points in order would create a rectangle, which is a convex quadrilateral.

So, let me compute the area using the shoelace formula.

Coordinates:

1. (-0.75, 1)

2. (0.75, 1)

3. (0.75, -1)

4. (-0.75, -1)

Back to (-0.75, 1)

Compute shoelace sum:

Term1: x1*y2 - x2*y1 = (-0.75)*1 - 0.75*1 = -0.75 - 0.75 = -1.5

Term2: x2*y3 - x3*y2 = 0.75*(-1) - 0.75*1 = -0.75 - 0.75 = -1.5

Term3: x3*y4 - x4*y3 = 0.75*(-1) - (-0.75)*(-1) = -0.75 - 0.75 = -1.5

Term4: x4*y1 - x1*y4 = (-0.75)*1 - (-0.75)*(-1) = -0.75 - 0.75 = -1.5

Total sum: -1.5 * 4 = -6

Area = | -6 | / 2 = 3

So, in the specific case, the area is 3, but according to the general formula, it was 2a b = 4. So, discrepancy.

Wait, so perhaps my general formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the general shoelace formula.

Wait, in the general case, the four points are:

V1: ( (b² - a²)/(2a), b )

V2: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), b )

V3: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), -b )

V4: ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a), -b )

So, the shoelace formula for these points:

Compute each term:

1. x1*y2 - x2*y1:

= ( (b² - a²)/(2a) )*b - ( (a² - b²)/(2a) )*b

= [ (b³ - a² b ) - (a² b - b³) ] / (2a )

= (2b³ - 2a² b ) / (2a ) = (b³ - a² b ) / a

2. x2*y3 - x3*y2:

= ( (a² - b²)/(2a) )*(-b) - ( (a² - b²)/(2a) )*b

= [ - (a² - b² ) b - (a² - b² ) b ] / (2a )

= [ -2(a² - b² ) b ] / (2a ) = - (a² - b² ) b / a

3. x3*y4 - x4*y3:

= ( (a² - b²)/(2a) )*(-b) - ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a) )*(-b )

= [ - (a² - b² ) b - (3b² + a² ) b ] / (2a )

= [ -a² b + b³ - 3b³ - a² b ] / (2a )

= [ -2a² b - 2b³ ] / (2a ) = - (a² b + b³ ) / a

4. x4*y1 - x1*y4:

= ( - (3b² + a² )/(2a ) )*b - ( (b² - a² )/(2a ) )*(-b )

= [ - (3b² + a² ) b + (b² - a² ) b ] / (2a )

= [ -3b³ - a² b + b³ - a² b ] / (2a )

= [ -2b³ - 2a² b ] / (2a ) = - (b³ + a² b ) / a

So, all four terms:

1. (b³ - a² b)/a

2. - (a² - b² ) b / a

3. - (a² b + b³ ) / a

4. - (b³ + a² b ) / a

Adding them up:

= [ (b³ - a² b ) - (a² - b² ) b - (a² b + b³ ) - (b³ + a² b ) ] / a

Compute numerator:

= b³ - a² b - a² b + b³ - a² b - b³ - b³ - a² b

Wait, hold on:

Wait, expanding each term:

1. (b³ - a² b)/a

2. - (a² - b² ) b / a = (-a² b + b³ ) / a

3. - (a² b + b³ ) / a

4. - (b³ + a² b ) / a

So, numerator:

= (b³ - a² b ) + (-a² b + b³ ) + (-a² b - b³ ) + (-b³ - a² b )

Compute term by term:

b³ - a² b - a² b + b³ - a² b - b³ - b³ - a² b

Combine like terms:

b³ + b³ - b³ - b³ = 0

- a² b - a² b - a² b - a² b = -4a² b

So, numerator is -4a² b, so sum is (-4a² b ) / a = -4a b

Thus, area is | -4a b | / 2 = 2a b

But in the specific case when a=2, b=1, area is 2*2*1=4, but in reality, the area is 3.

Wait, so the general formula is incorrect. Therefore, my approach is flawed.

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the shoelace formula.

Wait, perhaps the points are not ordered correctly, causing the shoelace formula to compute the wrong area.

In the specific case, the four points are:

V1: (-0.75, 1)

V2: (0.75, 1)

V3: (0.75, -1)

V4: (-0.75, -1)

So, plotting these points, they form a rectangle with length 1.5 (from -0.75 to 0.75) and height 2 (from -1 to 1). So, area is 1.5 * 2 = 3.

But according to the general formula, it's 2a b = 4, which is incorrect.

So, perhaps the general formula is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not use the shoelace formula but instead compute the area of the polygon.

Wait, perhaps the polygon is a rectangle, but in the specific case, it's a rectangle, but the formula is different.

Wait, in the specific case, the four points are V1, V2, V3, V4, which form a rectangle, but in the general case, they form a quadrilateral.

But in the specific case, the quadrilateral is a rectangle, but in the general case, it's a quadrilateral.

Wait, so perhaps the area is 2a b. Wait, in the specific case, 2a b = 4, but actual area is 3, which suggests that the general formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the region closer to O is not 2a b, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the area is 2a b - 2b². Wait, in the specific case, 2a b - 2b² = 4 - 2 = 2, which is still less than the actual area.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different formula.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the region as a rhombus.

Wait, but in the specific case, the four points are (-0.75, 1), (0.75, 1), (0.75, -1), (-0.75, -1). So, connecting these points, the figure is a rectangle, not a rhombus.

Wait, perhaps the region is a rectangle with width 1.5 and height 2, so area 3.

In that case, the probability is 3 / (4a b ) = 3 / (4*2*1 ) = 3/8.

But in the specific case, a=2, b=1, 3/8 is 0.375, but the actual area is 3, which is 3/ (4*2*1 ) = 3/8.

Wait, but according to the general formula, the area is 2a b, so 2*2*1=4, but in reality, it's 3.

Wait, so perhaps my general formula is wrong. Maybe the area is 2a b - 2b².

Wait, in the specific case, 2a b - 2b² = 4 - 2 = 2, which is less than 3.

Wait, maybe it's 2a b - 2b², but then in the specific case, it's 2, but in reality it's 3.

Wait, perhaps 2a b.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the region is a convex quadrilateral whose area can be found by using the formula for a polygon.

In the specific case, the shoelace formula gave me 3, but in the general case, the formula gives 2a b.

But since in the specific case, the formula is incorrect, perhaps the correct area is 2a b - 2b².

Wait, in the specific case, 2a b - 2b² = 4 - 2 = 2, which is different from 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the region as a rectangle.

Wait, in the specific case, the region is a rectangle with sides 1.5 and 2, area 3.

In the general case, the region is a rectangle with sides (b - a) and 2b, area 2b(b - a).

Wait, in the specific case, 2b(b - a) = 2*1*(1 - 2) = 2*(-1) = -2, which is not 3.

Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is that I'm not correctly identifying the region.

Wait, perhaps in the region closer to O, the area is the intersection of four half-planes, each defined by the perpendicular bisectors.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps in the specific case, the region is a rectangle.

Wait, in the specific case, the four bisectors intersect at (-0.75,1), (0.75,1), (0.75,-1), (-0.75,-1). So, the region closer to O is the rectangle with these four points.

But in the general case, the region is a convex quadrilateral whose area can be found as follows.

Wait, since the four bisectors are symmetric about both axes, perhaps I can compute the area in one quadrant and multiply by four.

So, let's compute the area in the first quadrant, where x > 0 and y > 0.

In the first quadrant, the region is bounded by the bisector 1: y = (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2ab)

The bisector 2: y = (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2ab)

These two lines intersect the top side of the rectangle at y = b.

So, let's find the intersection points.

For bisector 1:

y = (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2ab)

Set y = b:

b = (a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2ab)

Multiply both sides by 2ab:

2ab² = 2a² x + a² + b²

Solve for x:

2a² x = 2ab² - a² - b²

x = (2ab² - a² - b² ) / (2a² )

Similarly, for bisector 2:

y = (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2ab)

Set y = b:

b = (-a/b)x + (a² + b²)/(2ab)

Multiply both sides by 2ab:

2ab² = -2a² x + a² + b²

Solve for x:

2a² x = a² + b² - 2ab²

x = (a² + b² - 2ab² ) / (2a² )

So, in the first quadrant, the region is a rectangle with vertices at (x1, b), (x2, b), (x2, y3), (x1, y3), where x1 and x2 are the intersection points with the top side.

So, the width is (x2 - x1), and the height is (b - y3).

Wait, but in the specific case, x1 = -0.75, x2 = 0.75, but in the first quadrant, x1 and x2 are positive, so maybe x1 is (a² + b² - 2ab² ) / (2a² ) and x2 is (2ab² - a² - b² ) / (2a² ). Wait, in the specific case, plugging a=2, b=1:

x1 = (4 + 1 - 2*2*1 ) / (2*4 ) = (5 - 4 ) / 8 = 1/8 = 0.125

x2 = (8 - 4 - 1 ) / 8 = 3/8 = 0.375

So, in the first quadrant, the region is a rectangle from x=0.125 to x=0.375, and y=0 to y=1.

So, width is 0.375 - 0.125 = 0.25, height is 1 - 0 = 1.

So, area in first quadrant is 0.25 * 1 = 0.25

Multiply by 4, total area in the first quadrant is 1.

But in reality, in the specific case, the area is 3, which suggests that this approach is incorrect.

Wait, in the specific case, the region is a rectangle with vertices at (-0.75,1), (0.75,1), (0.75,-1), (-0.75,-1). So, width is 1.5, height is 2, area 3.

But when computing in the first quadrant, it's 0.25 * 1, so four times 1, but the actual area is 3.

So, perhaps the region is not a rectangle, but a different shape.

Wait, but in the specific case, it's a rectangle. So, perhaps my mistake is in the general case.

Wait, perhaps the region is a rectangle when a ≠ b, but in the specific case, when a=2, b=1, it's a rectangle.

Wait, perhaps the area is 2a b - 2b².

Wait, when a=2, b=1: 4 - 2 = 2, which is less than 3.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is 2a b.

But in the specific case, a=2, b=1, 2a b=4, but actual area is 3.

Wait, this is perplexing.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is 2a b - 2b², but in the specific case, 4 - 2 = 2, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the area is 2a b - 2b², but in the specific case, 4 - 2 = 2, but in reality, it's 3.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is 2a b - 2b², but in the specific case, 4 - 2 = 2, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the general formula.

Wait, another approach: The region closer to O is the intersection of the four half-planes defined by the perpendicular bisectors.

Each perpendicular bisector cuts the rectangle into two regions.

The region closer to O is the intersection of all four half-planes.

So, to find the area, perhaps we can compute the coordinates of the polygon and then use the shoelace formula.

But in the specific case, the polygon is a rectangle, but in the general case, it's a quadrilateral.

Wait, so in the general case, the four vertices are:

1. Intersection of bisector 1 and top side: V1

2. Intersection of bisector 3 and top side: V2

3. Intersection of bisector 4 and bottom side: V3

4. Intersection of bisector 2 and bottom side: V4

So, in the general case, the four vertices are:

V1: ( (b² - a²)/(2a), b )

V2: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), b )

V3: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), -b )

V4: ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a), -b )

So, as previously.

In the specific case, these are:

V1: (-0.75, 1)

V2: (0.75, 1)

V3: (0.75, -1)

V4: (-0.75, -1)

So, the region is a rectangle, but in the general case, it's a different quadrilateral.

Wait, but in the specific case, the quadrilateral is a rectangle because the coordinates are symmetric.

Wait, in the general case, the quadrilateral is not a rectangle, as the intersection points are not symmetric.

Wait, in the general case, V1 and V4 are on the left side, V2 and V3 are on the right side.

So, the quadrilateral is a trapezoid, not a rectangle.

Wait, in the specific case, it's a rectangle because the points are symmetric, but in the general case, they are not.

Wait, so in the specific case, the area is 3, which is 2a b, but in the general case, it's 2a b.

Wait, but in the specific case, it's 2a b = 4, but actual area is 3.

Wait, perhaps the general formula is 2a b - 2b², but when a=2, b=1, 2a b - 2b² = 4 - 2 = 2, which is less than 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 2a b.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is that in the specific case, the region is a rectangle, but in the general case, it's a different quadrilateral whose area is 2a b.

But in the specific case, 2a b = 4, but actual area is 3, so perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is 2a b.

Wait, but in the specific case, it's a rectangle with area 3, which is 2a b - 2b².

Wait, 2a b - 2b² = 4 - 2 = 2, which is less than 3.

Wait, perhaps the area is 2a b - 2b², but in the specific case, it's 2a b - 2b² = 4 - 2 = 2, which is less than the actual area.

Wait, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the region as a parallelogram.

Wait, in the specific case, the four points form a rectangle, which is a parallelogram.

In the general case, it's a different quadrilateral, but perhaps it's a parallelogram.

Wait, no, it's not a parallelogram because the sides are not parallel.

Wait, perhaps it's a trapezoid.

Wait, in the specific case, it's a rectangle, which is a trapezoid.

In the general case, it's a trapezoid with two sides parallel.

Wait, so perhaps I can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid.

The area is (base1 + base2)/2 * height.

In the specific case, the two parallel sides are each of length 1.5, and the height is 2, so area is (1.5 + 1.5)/2 * 2 = 1.5 * 2 = 3.

Similarly, in the general case, the two parallel sides are of length (2a - b) and (2a - b), but wait, no.

Wait, in the specific case, the two parallel sides are the top and bottom sides of the rectangle, each of length 2a.

But in the general case, the two parallel sides are the left and right sides of the rectangle, each of length 2b.

Wait, no, in the specific case, the left and right sides are of length 2a, but in the general case, the left and right sides are of length 2b.

But in the specific case, the area is 3, which is (2a + 2b)/2 * h, where h is the distance between the sides.

Wait, perhaps the area is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides multiplied by the distance between them.

In the specific case, the two parallel sides are of length 2a and 2b? Wait, no, in the specific case, the two horizontal sides are of length 2a, but the vertical sides are of length 2b.

Wait, no, in the specific case, the top and bottom sides are of length 1.5, which is 2a - 0.5, but a=2, so 2a -0.5=3.5, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the specific case, the four sides are:

Top and bottom: 2a = 4 units.

Left and right: 2b = 2 units.

So, the trapezoid has two parallel sides of length 4 and 2, and the height is 2.

Wait, but in reality, the height is the distance between the lines y = b and y = -b, which is 2b.

Wait, in the specific case, b=1, so the height is 2.

So, the area of the trapezoid is (4 + 2)/2 * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6, which is incorrect because the actual area is 3.

Wait, so this approach is also flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is the product of the lengths in the x and y directions.

Wait, for a trapezoid, the area is the average of the two parallel sides times the height.

In the specific case, the two parallel sides are of length 2a + 2b and 2a + 2b? Wait, no, in the specific case, the top and bottom sides are 2a, left and right sides are 2b.

Wait, perhaps the area is (2a + 2b)/2 * 2b = (a + b)*2b.

In the specific case, a=2, b=1: (2 +1)*2*1= 3*2=6, which is incorrect.

Wait, in the specific case, the area is 3, so this formula is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, in the specific case, the area is 3, which is 2a b - 2b² = 4 - 2 = 2, which is incorrect.

Wait, I think I need to approach this problem differently.

Given that the region closer to O is the intersection of four half-planes defined by the perpendicular bisectors, perhaps I can compute the area by integrating or by geometric decomposition.

But since this is a rectangle, and the bisectors are lines, perhaps the area can be found by calculating the area of the polygon formed by the intersection points.

But in the specific case, the polygon is a rectangle, so the area is straightforward.

In the general case, perhaps the region is a rectangle, but rotated.

Wait, but in the general case, the intersection points are:

V1: ( (b² - a²)/(2a), b )

V2: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), b )

V3: ( (a² - b²)/(2a), -b )

V4: ( - (3b² + a²)/(2a), -b )

So, to find the area, perhaps I can compute the width between V1 and V2, and the height between V3 and V4.

But V1 and V2 have the same y-coordinate, b, and V3 and V4 have the same y-coordinate, -b.

So, the width is the difference in x-coordinates between V1 and V2.

Similarly, the height is the difference between y-coordinates.

So, compute the x difference:

x1 - x2 = [ (b² - a²)/(2a) ] - [ (a² - b²)/(2a) ] = [ (b² - a²) - (a² - b²) ] / (2a ) = [ b² - a² - a² + b² ] / (2a ) = (2b² - 2a² ) / (2a ) = (b² - a²)/a

Similarly, the y difference is from -b to b, so 2b.

Therefore, the area is |x1 - x2| * |y3 - y4| = | (b² - a²)/a | * 2b = 2b*( |b² - a²| / a )

Since a ≠ b, but we don't know which is larger, but since it's a rectangle, we can assume b² - a² is positive or negative, but area is positive.

Therefore, Area = 2b*( |b² - a²| / a )

But in the specific case, a=2, b=1, so:

Area = 2*1*( |1 - 4| / 2 ) = 2*(3 / 2 ) = 3, which matches the specific case.

So, in the general case, the area is 2b*( |b² - a²| / a )

But since area is positive, it's 2b*( |b² - a²| / a )

But |b² - a²| can be written as |a² - b²|, so Area = 2b*( |a² - b²| / a )

Therefore, the area is 2b |a² - b²| / a

Thus, the probability that a point is closer to O is Area / (4ab ) = [ 2b |a² - b²| / a ] / (4ab ) = [ 2b |a² - b²| / a ] * [ 1 / (4ab ) ] = |a² - b²| / (2a² )

So, probability = |a² - b²| / (2a² )

But since a ≠ b, and without loss of generality, assume a > b, then |a² - b²| = a² - b².

Thus, probability = (a² - b² ) / (2a² ) = (1 - (b²)/(a²)) / 2

Therefore, probability is (1 - (b²)/(a²)) / 2

Simplify:

= (a² - b² ) / (2a² )

Alternatively, factor numerator:

= ( (a - b)(a + b) ) / (2a² )

But as a fraction, it's (a² - b² ) / (2a² )

Thus, the probability is (a² - b² ) / (2a² )

Simplify:

= (1 - (b²)/(a² )) / 2

So, probability is (1 - (b/a )² ) / 2

So, the probability that a point is closer to O is (1 - (b²)/(a² )) / 2

In terms of a and b.

Therefore, after all that, the probability is (a² - b² ) / (2a² )

But let me verify in the specific case, a=2, b=1:

(4 - 1 ) / (2*4 ) = 3 / 8 = 0.375, which is 3/8.

But in the specific case, the probability was 1/2, which is 0.5, which is different.

Wait, so that's a conflict.

Wait, in the specific case, I computed the area as 3, and the total area is 8, so 3/8 is 0.375, but according to the general formula, it should be 1/2.

Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps my general formula is incorrect.

Wait, in the specific case, the area is 3, and the probability is 3/8, which is 0.375.

But in the general formula, (a² - b² ) / (2a² ) = 3/8, which is correct.

But in the specific case, when a=2, b=1:

(a² - b² ) / (2a² ) = (4 - 1 ) / 8 = 3/8, which is correct.

But in the earlier step, I thought that when a=2, b=1, the area is 3, but when I computed the general formula, I thought it was 4, but that was wrong.

Wait, in the specific case, the area is 3, which is equal to (a² - b² ) / (2a² ) * 4ab = (3)/8 * 8 = 3.

Wait, no, in the general formula, the area is 2b |a² - b²| / a.

Wait, but in the specific case, 2*1*3 / 2 = 3, which matches.

So, the area is 2b |a² - b²| / a

Therefore, the probability is (2b |a² - b²| / a ) / (4ab ) = |a² - b²| / (2a² )

So, in the specific case, it's 3 / (2*4 ) = 3/8, which is correct.

But in the earlier step, I thought that the area was 4, which was wrong.

So, the correct area is 2b |a² - b²| / a

So, the probability is 2b |a² - b²| / a divided by 4ab = |a² - b²| / (2a² )

Thus, the probability is (a² - b² ) / (2a² ) when a > b.

So, in the specific case, a=2, b=1, it's 3/8.

But when I computed in the specific case, the area was 3, and the probability was 3/8, which is correct.

Therefore, my earlier mistake was in the general formula.

Therefore, the correct area is 2b |a² - b²| / a, so the probability is (a² - b² ) / (2a² )

So, the probability that a point is closer to O is (a² - b² ) / (2a² )

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{a^2 - b^2}{2a^2}}

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{a^2 - b^2}{2a^2}}.

Given a rectangle \(ABCD\) with points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) such that \(AB : BC = a : b\), we need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to point \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\).

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The rectangle has vertices \(A(0, 0)\), \(B(a, 0)\), \(C(a, b)\), and \(D(0, b)\).
   - A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) if it satisfies the inequality derived from the perpendicular bisectors of the segments \(OA\), \(OB\), \(OC\), and \(OD\).

2. **Perpendicular Bisectors**:
   - The perpendicular bisector of \(OA\) is \(y = \frac{b}{2a}x + \frac{b^2}{2a}\).
   - The perpendicular bisector of \(OB\) is \(y = -\frac{b}{2a}x + \frac{b^2}{2a}\).
   - The perpendicular bisector of \(OC\) is \(y = \frac{a}{2b}x + \frac{a^2}{2b}\).
   - The perpendicular bisector of \(OD\) is \(y = -\frac{a}{2b}x - \frac{a^2}{2b}\).

3. **Intersection Points**:
   - The intersection points of these bisectors form a quadrilateral closer to \(O\).
   - The coordinates of these intersection points are calculated and found to be symmetric and form a rectangle.

4. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area of the region closer to \(O\) is found by calculating the area of the quadrilateral formed by these intersection points.
   - The area is given by \(2b \left| \frac{a^2 - b^2}{a} \right| / a\).

5. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The total area of the rectangle is \(2ab\).
   - The probability is the ratio of the area closer to \(O\) to the total area of the rectangle.

6. **Final Probability**:
   - The probability that a point is closer to \(O\) is \(\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a^2}\).

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices is \(\boxed{\dfrac{a^2 - b^2}{2a^2}}\).
