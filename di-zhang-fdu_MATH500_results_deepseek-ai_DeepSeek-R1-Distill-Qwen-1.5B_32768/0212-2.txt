Question:
Find all solutions to
\[\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
Since $\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} x$ for all $x,$ we can write
\[\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} x \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]Let $\theta = \tan^{-1} x,$ so $x = \tan \theta.$  Also, $\sin 2 \theta = \frac{1}{3},$ so
\[2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \frac{1}{3}.\]Construct a right triangle with legs 1 and $x.$  Then the angle opposite the side length $x$ be $\theta.$

label("$x$", (A + C)/2, E);

[/asy]

Also, the hypotenuse will be $\sqrt{x^2 + 1},$ so $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}$ and $\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}.$  Hence,
\[2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = \frac{1}{3},\]or
\[\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}.\]This gives us $x^2 + 1 = 6x,$ or $x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula, the roots are $x = \boxed{3 \pm 2 \sqrt{2}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this equation to solve: \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). Hmm, that looks a bit complex, but let me try breaking it down step by step.

First off, I know that \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}(y)\) are inverse trigonometric functions. Maybe I can simplify the expression inside the sine function by using some trigonometric identities or properties of inverse functions.

Let me denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). That means \(\tan(\theta) = x\). Similarly, let me set \(\phi = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), which implies that \(\cot(\phi) = \frac{1}{x}\). So, \(\tan(\phi) = x\) as well, because \(\cot(\phi) = \frac{1}{\tan(\phi)}\), right? Wait, no, actually, \(\cot(\phi) = \frac{1}{\tan(\phi)}\), so if \(\cot(\phi) = \frac{1}{x}\), then \(\tan(\phi) = x\). So, both \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) have the same tangent value, which is \(x\). That might be helpful.

So, the expression inside the sine becomes \(\theta + \phi\). Since both \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) have the same tangent, maybe I can express them in terms of sine and cosine to find a relationship.

Let me recall that if \(\tan(\theta) = x\), then I can represent this as a right triangle where the opposite side is \(x\) and the adjacent side is 1. So, the hypotenuse would be \(\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\). Therefore, \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\).

Similarly, since \(\phi\) is such that \(\tan(\phi) = x\), it's another triangle with opposite side \(x\), adjacent side 1, hypotenuse \(\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\). Therefore, \(\sin(\phi) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos(\phi) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\).

Wait a second, that means \(\sin(\theta) = \sin(\phi)\). That's interesting. So, both angles \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) have the same sine value. But since \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\phi = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), I wonder if they are related in some way.

Actually, I recall that \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\). Let me check that. If \(\tan(\theta) = x\), then \(\cot(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta) = \tan(\theta) = x\). So, \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta = \cot^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\). But in my problem, the second term is \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), not \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). Hmm, so maybe I need to adjust that.

Let me think. If \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is the same as \(\tan^{-1}(x)\)? Wait, let's see. Let me use the identity \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)\). So, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Oh, that's right! So, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). That means both \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) are equal to \(\tan^{-1}(x)\). Wait, that can't be, because \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\phi = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so their sum would be \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\). But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The question is \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). So, if I let \(\alpha = \tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\beta = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), then I need to find \(\sin(\alpha + \beta)\).

Earlier, I thought that \(\beta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so \(\alpha + \beta = 2 \tan^{-1}(x)\). Is that correct? Let me verify.

Let me take a specific value for \(x\) to test. Suppose \(x = 1\). Then, \(\tan^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}\), and \(\cot^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}\) as well. So, \(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{2}\). So, \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1\), which is not \(\frac{1}{3}\). So, that doesn't work.

Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me try another approach. Perhaps \(\beta = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \alpha\). Let me check that.

Since \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(y)\). So, if \(y = \frac{1}{x}\), then \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). But \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(x)\), because \(\tan^{-1}(y) = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)\). So, \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, \(\beta = \frac{\pi}{2} - \cot^{-1}(x)\).

So, \(\alpha + \beta = \tan^{-1}(x) + \frac{\pi}{2} - \cot^{-1}(x)\). Hmm, how does that simplify? Let me write it as \(\frac{\pi}{2} + \tan^{-1}(x) - \cot^{-1}(x)\).

But earlier, I thought \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\), so \(\tan^{-1}(x) - \cot^{-1}(x) = 0\). Therefore, \(\alpha + \beta = \frac{\pi}{2}\). Wait, that can't be right because in the case \(x = 1\), \(\alpha + \beta = \frac{\pi}{2} + 0 = \frac{\pi}{2}\). But \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1\), but the equation is supposed to be \(\frac{1}{3}\).

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in that reasoning. Let me go back. If \(y = \frac{1}{x}\), then \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(y)\). So, substituting, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). Now, \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is equal to \(\cot^{-1}(x)\), as I thought before, because \(\tan^{-1}(y) = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)\). Therefore, \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \cot^{-1}(x)\). So, putting it all together:

\(\alpha + \beta = \tan^{-1}(x) + \frac{\pi}{2} - \cot^{-1}(x)\).

But since \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\), we can substitute that into the equation:

\(\alpha + \beta = \frac{\pi}{2} - \cot^{-1}(x) + \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(x)\).

Wait, that seems more complicated. Maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express both \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) in terms of sine and cosine and then compute the sum.

Let me denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so \(\tan(\theta) = x\). Then, \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\).

Similarly, \(\phi = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), which implies \(\cot(\phi) = \frac{1}{x}\). Therefore, \(\tan(\phi) = x\), so \(\sin(\phi) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos(\phi) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\).

Wait, so both \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\sin(\phi)\) are equal to \(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\). That means that \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) have the same sine value. But since \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\phi = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), are they related in another way?

Wait a second, let's think about the angle addition formula for sine. If I have \(\sin(\alpha + \beta)\), it's equal to \(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta\). So, in this case, the expression is \(\sin(\theta + \phi) = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \cos \theta \sin \phi\).

From above, we know \(\sin \theta = \sin \phi = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\), and \(\cos \theta = \cos \phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\). So, substituting these into the formula, we get:

\(\sin(\theta + \phi) = \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\right)\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\right)\).

Simplifying this, both terms are equal, so:

\(\sin(\theta + \phi) = 2 \times \frac{x}{(x^2 + 1)}\).

So, \(\sin(\theta + \phi) = \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1}\).

But the original equation is \(\sin(\theta + \phi) = \frac{1}{3}\). Therefore, we have:

\(\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}\).

Now, let's solve this equation for \(x\).

Multiply both sides by \(3(x^2 + 1)\):

\(6x = x^2 + 1\).

Bring all terms to one side:

\(x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0\).

Now, we have a quadratic equation \(x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0\). Let's solve this using the quadratic formula:

\(x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4 \times 1 \times 1}}{2}\).

Compute the discriminant:

\(36 - 4 = 32\).

Therefore,

\(x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2}\).

Simplify \(\sqrt{32}\):

\(\sqrt{32} = \sqrt{16 \times 2} = 4 \sqrt{2}\).

So,

\(x = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

Simplify the fraction:

\(x = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\).

Therefore, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

But wait, let me check if these solutions are valid. The original equation involves inverse trigonometric functions, so we need to ensure that the arguments are within the domain where these functions are defined.

Specifically, \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is defined for all real numbers \(x\), and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is also defined for all real numbers \(x \neq 0\). So, as long as \(x \neq 0\), both functions are defined. So, our solutions \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) are both non-zero, so they are valid.

Wait, but let's compute \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Since \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142\), so \(2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.8284\). Therefore, \(3 - 2.8284 \approx 0.1716\), which is positive. So, \(x\) is positive in both cases, so no issues with the inverse functions.

Let me just verify the solutions by plugging them back into the original equation.

First, let's take \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\).

Compute \(\tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\). Hmm, that's a specific value. Let me compute \(\sin(\tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2}) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}\right))\).

But from earlier, we already know that \(\sin(\theta + \phi) = \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1}\). So, substituting \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\):

Compute \(\frac{2(3 + 2\sqrt{2})}{(3 + 2\sqrt{2})^2 + 1}\).

First, compute the denominator:

\((3 + 2\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 + 12\sqrt{2} + 8 = 17 + 12\sqrt{2}\).

Adding 1 gives \(18 + 12\sqrt{2}\).

So, the numerator is \(6 + 4\sqrt{2}\).

Therefore,

\(\frac{6 + 4\sqrt{2}}{18 + 12\sqrt{2}}\).

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \(2(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\).

Denominator: \(6(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\).

So, it simplifies to \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\), which matches the equation. So, \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is a valid solution.

Now, let's check \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

Compute \(\frac{2(3 - 2\sqrt{2})}{(3 - 2\sqrt{2})^2 + 1}\).

First, compute the denominator:

\((3 - 2\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 - 12\sqrt{2} + 8 = 17 - 12\sqrt{2}\).

Adding 1 gives \(18 - 12\sqrt{2}\).

So, the numerator is \(6 - 4\sqrt{2}\).

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\(\frac{6 - 4\sqrt{2}}{18 - 12\sqrt{2}}\).

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \(2(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\).

Denominator: \(6(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\).

So, it simplifies to \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\), which again matches the equation. So, \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) is also a valid solution.

Therefore, both solutions are correct.

So, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

**Final Answer**
The solutions are \(\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}, \boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}\).
</think>

Given the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by denoting \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\phi = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). We know that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(\cot(\phi) = \frac{1}{x}\), which implies \(\tan(\phi) = x\). 

Using the identity \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(y)\), we find that \(\phi = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). Since \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(x)\), we have \(\phi = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(x)\).

Thus, the expression inside the sine function becomes:
\[
\theta + \phi = \tan^{-1}(x) + \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right)
\]
Since \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\), we find that:
\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}
\]
However, this was incorrect earlier. Instead, we use the identity \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) and simplify using the sine addition formula. 

We find that:
\[
\sin(\theta + \phi) = \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1}
\]
Given the equation \(\sin(\theta + \phi) = \frac{1}{3}\), we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Solving this, we get:
\[
6x = x^2 + 1 \implies x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]
Using the quadratic formula, we find the solutions:
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]
Both solutions are valid as they are non-zero and within the domain of the inverse trigonometric functions.

Thus, the solutions are \(\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}, \boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}\).
