Question:
Let $a$ be a positive real number such that all the roots of
\[x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0\]are real.  Find the smallest possible value of $a.$

Correct Answer:
Note that $x = -1$ is always a root of $x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0,$ so we can factor out $x + 1,$ to get
\[(x + 1) (x^2 + (a - 1) x + 1) = 0.\]The quadratic factor has real roots if and only if its discriminant is nonnegative:
\[(a - 1)^2 - 4 \ge 0.\]This reduces to $a^2 - 2a - 3 \ge 0,$ which factors as $(a + 1)(a - 3) \ge 0.$  The smallest positive value that satisfies this inequality is $\boxed{3}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest possible value of a positive real number \( a \) such that all the roots of the cubic equation \( x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0 \) are real. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that for a cubic equation \( x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \), the conditions for all roots to be real can sometimes be determined using calculus, specifically by looking at the derivatives. But since this equation is given with coefficients in terms of \( a \), maybe there's a different approach. Alternatively, I might try to factor the polynomial or use Vieta's formulas to find some relationships between the roots.

Let me write down the equation again:

\( x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 = 0 \).

I notice that the coefficients of \( x^3 \) and the constant term are both 1, and the coefficients of \( x^2 \) and \( x \) are both \( a \). That seems symmetrical in a way. Maybe it can be factored into something simpler?

Let me try factoring by grouping. Let's group the first two terms and the last two terms:

\( (x^3 + a x^2) + (a x + 1) = 0 \).

Factor out \( x^2 \) from the first group and 1 from the second group:

\( x^2(x + a) + 1(a x + 1) = 0 \).

Hmm, that doesn't seem to lead anywhere immediately. Maybe there's another way to factor it.

Wait, I notice that the equation is palindromic. A palindromic polynomial has the coefficients symmetric, meaning \( a_n = a_0 \), \( a_{n-1} = a_1 \), etc. In this case, the polynomial is \( x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 \), so yes, the coefficients are symmetric. For a cubic polynomial, palindromic polynomials can sometimes be factored by dividing by \( x + 1 \) or something like that. Let me try that.

Let me perform polynomial division or use substitution to factor it. Let me try substituting \( x = -1 \) into the equation to see if it's a root:

\( (-1)^3 + a (-1)^2 + a (-1) + 1 = -1 + a - a + 1 = 0 \).

Oh, wow, \( x = -1 \) is a root. That means \( (x + 1) \) is a factor. Great! So I can factor the cubic as \( (x + 1)(something) = 0 \).

Let me perform the division to find the quadratic factor. Let's divide \( x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 \) by \( x + 1 \).

Using polynomial long division:

Divide \( x^3 \) by \( x \) to get \( x^2 \). Multiply \( x + 1 \) by \( x^2 \) to get \( x^3 + x^2 \). Subtract this from the original polynomial:

\( (x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1) - (x^3 + x^2) = (a - 1)x^2 + a x + 1 \).

Now, divide \( (a - 1)x^2 \) by \( x \) to get \( (a - 1)x \). Multiply \( x + 1 \) by \( (a - 1)x \) to get \( (a - 1)x^2 + (a - 1)x \). Subtract this from the current polynomial:

\( [(a - 1)x^2 + a x + 1] - [(a - 1)x^2 + (a - 1)x] = [a x - (a - 1)x] + 1 = (2 - a)x + 1 \).

Next, divide \( (2 - a)x \) by \( x \) to get \( (2 - a) \). Multiply \( x + 1 \) by \( (2 - a) \) to get \( (2 - a)x + (2 - a) \). Subtract this from the current polynomial:

\( [(2 - a)x + 1] - [(2 - a)x + (2 - a)] = 1 - (2 - a) = (a - 1) \).

Wait, so after division, we have:

\( \frac{x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1}{x + 1} = x^2 + (a - 1)x + (2 - a) \) with a remainder of \( (a - 1) \).

But since \( x = -1 \) is a root, the remainder should be zero. So \( a - 1 = 0 \), which implies \( a = 1 \). Interesting, so \( a \) must be 1 for \( x = -1 \) to be a root, and hence \( x + 1 \) is a factor. That makes sense.

So, factoring gives:

\( (x + 1)(x^2 + (1 - 1)x + (2 - 1)) = (x + 1)(x^2 + 0x + 1) = (x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \).

Therefore, the cubic factors as \( (x + 1)(x^2 + 1) = 0 \). So, the roots are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = \pm i \). Wait, but the problem states that all roots are real. But in this case, we have complex roots \( \pm i \). Hmm, that's not good because we were supposed to have all roots real.

So, if \( a = 1 \), the equation doesn't satisfy the condition that all roots are real. So, that means \( a \) can't be 1. Hmm, so maybe \( a \) has to be different.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in my factoring. Let me double-check. I said that \( x = -1 \) is a root, so we can factor \( (x + 1) \). Let me perform the division again to confirm.

Divide \( x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 \) by \( x + 1 \):

1. \( x^3 ÷ x = x^2 \). Multiply \( x + 1 \) by \( x^2 \): \( x^3 + x^2 \).
2. Subtract from original: \( (x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1) - (x^3 + x^2) = (a - 1)x^2 + a x + 1 \).
3. \( (a - 1)x^2 ÷ x = (a - 1)x \). Multiply \( x + 1 \) by \( (a - 1)x \): \( (a - 1)x^2 + (a - 1)x \).
4. Subtract: \( [(a - 1)x^2 + a x + 1] - [(a - 1)x^2 + (a - 1)x] = (a x - (a - 1)x) + 1 = (2 - a)x + 1 \).
5. \( (2 - a)x ÷ x = (2 - a) \). Multiply \( x + 1 \) by \( (2 - a) \): \( (2 - a)x + (2 - a) \).
6. Subtract: \( [(2 - a)x + 1] - [(2 - a)x + (2 - a)] = 1 - (2 - a) = (a - 1) \).

So, the division gives \( x^2 + (a - 1)x + (2 - a) \) with a remainder of \( a - 1 \). So, for \( x = -1 \) to be a root, the remainder must be zero, which requires \( a - 1 = 0 \), so \( a = 1 \). So, that seems correct. Therefore, the only value of \( a \) for which \( x = -1 \) is a root is \( a = 1 \), but at \( a = 1 \), the other roots become complex. So, to have all roots real, we need to avoid \( a = 1 \).

Hmm, so perhaps we need to consider other roots? Maybe the cubic doesn't factor into a linear term and a quadratic term with real coefficients? Or maybe it's always factoring into a linear term and a quadratic term, but the quadratic term has complex roots? So, perhaps, in order for all roots to be real, the quadratic factor must also have real roots.

So, if I write the cubic as \( (x + 1)(x^2 + (a - 1)x + (2 - a)) = 0 \), then for all roots to be real, the quadratic \( x^2 + (a - 1)x + (2 - a) \) must have real roots. That would require its discriminant to be non-negative.

Recall that for a quadratic \( x^2 + bx + c \), the discriminant is \( D = b^2 - 4ac \). If \( D \geq 0 \), the quadratic has real roots.

In this case, the quadratic is \( x^2 + (a - 1)x + (2 - a) \), so \( b = (a - 1) \), and \( c = (2 - a) \).

So, discriminant \( D = (a - 1)^2 - 4(1)(2 - a) \).

Let me compute that:

\( D = (a^2 - 2a + 1) - 4(2 - a) = a^2 - 2a + 1 - 8 + 4a = a^2 + 2a - 7 \).

For the quadratic to have real roots, \( D \geq 0 \), so:

\( a^2 + 2a - 7 \geq 0 \).

Let me solve the inequality \( a^2 + 2a - 7 \geq 0 \).

First, find the roots of the equation \( a^2 + 2a - 7 = 0 \).

Using the quadratic formula:

\( a = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(1)(-7)}}{2(1)} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 28}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm 2\sqrt{2} \).

So, the roots are \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \) and \( a = -1 - 2\sqrt{2} \).

Since \( a \) is a positive real number, we can ignore the negative root \( a = -1 - 2\sqrt{2} \) because it's negative. So, the critical point is \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx -1 + 2.828 \approx 1.828 \).

Now, the quadratic \( a^2 + 2a - 7 \) is a parabola opening upwards. So, it's positive outside the interval between its roots. Since the smaller root is negative, the inequality \( a^2 + 2a - 7 \geq 0 \) holds when \( a \leq -1 - 2\sqrt{2} \) or \( a \geq -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \).

But since \( a \) is positive, we only consider \( a \geq -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \), which is approximately 1.828.

Therefore, for \( a \geq -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx 1.828 \), the quadratic has real roots, which would make all roots of the original cubic real. However, we need the smallest possible value of \( a \) such that all roots are real. So, the minimal \( a \) is \( -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \).

Wait a second, let me just verify if that's correct. So, if \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \), then the discriminant is zero, meaning the quadratic has a repeated real root, so all roots of the original cubic are real. And if \( a \) is smaller than that, say between 0 and \( -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \), the discriminant is negative, which would make the quadratic have complex roots, leading to the original cubic having complex roots as well.

Therefore, the minimal positive \( a \) is \( -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \). Let me compute that value:

\( -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx -1 + 2.828 \approx 1.828 \).

So, that's the minimal \( a \). Let me just check if that indeed works. Let me substitute \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \) back into the quadratic:

Quadratic becomes \( x^2 + (a - 1)x + (2 - a) \).

Compute \( a - 1 = (-1 + 2\sqrt{2}) - 1 = -2 + 2\sqrt{2} \).

And \( 2 - a = 2 - (-1 + 2\sqrt{2}) = 3 - 2\sqrt{2} \).

So, the quadratic is \( x^2 + (-2 + 2\sqrt{2})x + (3 - 2\sqrt{2}) \).

Compute the discriminant: \( D = (-2 + 2\sqrt{2})^2 - 4(1)(3 - 2\sqrt{2}) \).

First, \( (-2 + 2\sqrt{2})^2 = (-2)^2 + (2\sqrt{2})^2 + 2*(-2)*(2\sqrt{2}) = 4 + 8 - 8\sqrt{2} = 12 - 8\sqrt{2} \).

Then, \( 4*(3 - 2\sqrt{2}) = 12 - 8\sqrt{2} \).

So, D = (12 - 8√2) - (12 - 8√2) = 0. So, the discriminant is zero, which means the quadratic has a double root, so the original cubic has a triple root or two double roots. Wait, but it's a cubic, so if the quadratic has a double root, then the cubic has a double root and a single root, both real. So, yes, in that case, all roots are real.

Therefore, the minimal \( a \) is indeed \( -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \).

Wait, but let me double-check my factoring. When \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \), does the cubic factor into \( (x + 1)(x - r)^2 \) where \( r \) is a repeated root?

Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach to confirm. Let's try Vieta's formulas.

Given the cubic equation \( x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 = 0 \), the sum of roots is \( -a \), the sum of products of roots two at a time is \( a \), and the product of roots is \( -1 \).

Let me denote the roots as \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \). Since all roots are real, then:

1. \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -a \).
2. \( r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + r_2 r_3 = a \).
3. \( r_1 r_2 r_3 = -1 \).

Since we have a triple root at \( x = -1 \) when \( a = 1 \), but that doesn't satisfy the condition of all roots being real. So, maybe the polynomial has a multiple real root and another distinct real root. Or perhaps all roots are real but not necessarily all equal.

Wait, when \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \), the quadratic has a double root, so the cubic would have two distinct real roots, one of which is a double root? Or is it all three roots real but with one of them being a double root?

Wait, actually, in this case, since the quadratic factor is \( (x^2 + (a - 1)x + (2 - a)) \) with discriminant zero, so that quadratic has a double root. Therefore, the cubic would have a double root and another distinct real root. So, all roots are real, but one is a double root.

Therefore, in that case, it's acceptable because the problem says "all the roots are real," regardless of multiplicity. So, that should be okay.

Hence, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the minimal \( a \) is \( -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \). Let me compute that value as a decimal to make sure it's positive.

As I did before, \( -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx -1 + 2.828 \approx 1.828 \), which is positive, as required.

Just to make sure, let me try \( a = 1.828 \) and see if the cubic has all real roots.

Compute the cubic: \( x^3 + 1.828 x^2 + 1.828 x + 1 = 0 \).

Let me try to find the roots numerically.

First, I know that \( x = -1 \) is a root when \( a = 1 \), but for \( a = 1.828 \), it's not a root.

Let me use the rational root theorem to test possible roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 1 over factors of 1, so \( \pm1 \). Let me test \( x = -1 \):

\( (-1)^3 + 1.828*(-1)^2 + 1.828*(-1) + 1 = -1 + 1.828 - 1.828 + 1 = 0 \).

Wait, that's zero! So, \( x = -1 \) is still a root for \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx 1.828 \). Interesting, so even though I set \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx 1.828 \), \( x = -1 \) is still a root.

Wait, but when I calculated earlier, substituting \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \) into the quadratic gave it a double root, but the original cubic still has \( x = -1 \) as a root. Hmm, so maybe in this case, \( x = -1 \) is a root of multiplicity 1 and the quadratic factor has a double root, but that double root is not \( x = -1 \), but another value.

Wait, let me compute the roots when \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \).

We have \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \). Then, the quadratic factor is \( x^2 + (a - 1)x + (2 - a) \).

Compute \( a - 1 = (-1 + 2\sqrt{2}) - 1 = -2 + 2\sqrt{2} \).

And \( 2 - a = 2 - (-1 + 2\sqrt{2}) = 3 - 2\sqrt{2} \).

So, quadratic is \( x^2 + (-2 + 2\sqrt{2})x + (3 - 2\sqrt{2}) \).

Let me compute the roots of this quadratic:

Using quadratic formula:

\( x = \frac{2 - 2\sqrt{2} \pm \sqrt{(-2 + 2\sqrt{2})^2 - 4*1*(3 - 2\sqrt{2})}}{2} \).

Wait, but earlier we saw that discriminant is zero, so the roots are:

\( x = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{2 - 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 - \sqrt{2} \).

So, the quadratic factor has a double root at \( x = 1 - \sqrt{2} \).

But what is \( 1 - \sqrt{2} \) approximately? \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \), so \( 1 - 1.414 \approx -0.414 \). So, the double root is at approximately \( x = -0.414 \).

So, the cubic equation \( x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 = 0 \) has roots \( x = -1 \), \( x = 1 - \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = 1 - \sqrt{2} \). So, all roots are real, one is a double root at \( x \approx -0.414 \), and another at \( x = -1 \).

Therefore, at \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx 1.828 \), all roots are real, with one being a double root. So, that's the minimal \( a \).

Wait, but earlier I thought that \( a \) had to be at least approximately 1.828, but when I set \( a = 1 \), the cubic didn't have all real roots. So, the minimal \( a \) is exactly \( -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \).

Wait, let me make sure that for \( a < -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \), the cubic has complex roots. Since the discriminant of the quadratic is positive when \( a > -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \) and negative otherwise. So, for \( a \) less than that, the quadratic has complex roots, meaning the cubic has one real root and two complex roots.

Hence, the minimal \( a \) is \( -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \), which is approximately 1.828.

Therefore, I think I'm confident that the minimal \( a \) is \( -1 + 2\sqrt{2} \).

**Final Answer**
The smallest possible value of \( a \) is \(\boxed{-1 + 2\sqrt{2}}\).
</think>

To find the smallest possible value of \( a \) such that all the roots of the cubic equation \( x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0 \) are real, we start by factoring the polynomial. 

First, we note that \( x = -1 \) is a root because:
\[ (-1)^3 + a(-1)^2 + a(-1) + 1 = -1 + a - a + 1 = 0. \]

We can factor the cubic polynomial as:
\[ (x + 1)(x^2 + (a - 1)x + (2 - a)) = 0. \]

For all roots to be real, the quadratic factor \( x^2 + (a - 1)x + (2 - a) \) must have real roots. The discriminant of this quadratic must be non-negative:
\[ (a - 1)^2 - 4(2 - a) \geq 0. \]

Simplifying the discriminant:
\[ (a - 1)^2 - 4(2 - a) = a^2 - 2a + 1 - 8 + 4a = a^2 + 2a - 7. \]

We solve the inequality:
\[ a^2 + 2a - 7 \geq 0. \]

The roots of the equation \( a^2 + 2a - 7 = 0 \) are found using the quadratic formula:
\[ a = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 28}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm 2\sqrt{2}. \]

Since \( a \) is a positive real number, we consider the positive root:
\[ a = -1 + 2\sqrt{2}. \]

Thus, the smallest possible value of \( a \) is:
\[ \boxed{-1 + 2\sqrt{2}}. \]
