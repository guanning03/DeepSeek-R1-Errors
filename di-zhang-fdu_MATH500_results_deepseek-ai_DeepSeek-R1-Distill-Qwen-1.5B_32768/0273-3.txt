Question:
A figure skater is facing north when she begins to spin to her right. She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?

Correct Answer:
Each full circle is 360 degrees.  Dividing 360 into 2250 gives a quotient of 6 with a remainder of 90.  So, she spins 90 degrees to her right past north, which leaves her facing $\boxed{\text{east}}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem here about a figure skater spinning and I need to figure out which direction she'll be facing after spinning 2250 degrees. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First, I know that when something spins, each full rotation is 360 degrees. So, if the skater spins 360 degrees, she would end up facing the same direction she started. That makes sense because a full circle brings you back to where you started.

Now, the skater starts facing north and begins spinning to her right. Hmm, wait, so she's spinning clockwise? Because when you spin to your right, that's the direction of clockwise rotation. Yeah, that sounds right. So, starting from north, spinning to the right would make her face east, then south, then west, and back to north after 360 degrees.

But wait, she's spinning 2250 degrees. That's a lot more than one full rotation. I need to figure out where she ends up after 2250 degrees. Since 360 degrees is a full rotation, maybe I can divide 2250 by 360 to see how many full rotations she does and then find the remaining degrees.

Let me do that division: 2250 divided by 360. Hmm, let me calculate that. 360 times 6 is 2160, right? Because 360 times 5 is 1800, and 360 more is 2160. So, 360 times 6 is 2160. Then, 2250 minus 2160 is 90 degrees. So, 2250 degrees is equal to 6 full rotations plus 90 degrees. Since a full rotation brings her back to the starting point, the 6 full rotations don't matter. So, she only has to worry about the remaining 90 degrees.

So, she starts facing north. She spins 90 degrees to the right. Let me visualize that. Starting at north, if you spin right 90 degrees, that should face her west, right? Because right from north is west. Wait, no, hold on. If you're facing north and you spin to the right (clockwise), your right hand is pointing towards the east, but when you spin to your right, you're actually turning clockwise, so starting at north, spinning right 90 degrees would face her west? Let me double-check.

Wait, if you start facing north and spin right (clockwise), your direction would change as follows: 90 degrees to the right (clockwise) from north is west. Then, another 90 degrees would be south, then another 90 is east, and another 90 is back to north. So, yeah, 90 degrees from north is west. So, after 2250 degrees, which is 6 full rotations plus 90 degrees, she ends up facing west.

But wait, is that right? Let me think again. 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25. So, 6 full rotations and a quarter of a rotation. A quarter rotation is 90 degrees. So, she does a full 6 times which brings her back to the starting point, and then a quarter turn. So, from north, a quarter turn clockwise is west. So, yes, she ends up facing west.

Wait, hold on again. Maybe I should think about it another way. If I take 2250 degrees, and divide by 360, that gives me 6.25. So, 6.25 rotations. So, 6 is a whole number, so 6 full spins, and 0.25 spin, which is a quarter turn. So, a quarter turn clockwise would be west from north.

Alternatively, if she spins counterclockwise, but the problem says she's spinning to her right, which is a clockwise rotation. So, it's 90 degrees. So, from north, spinning 90 degrees to the right is west.

Wait, but let me also think about whether direction is important. If she spins 2250 degrees to the right, that is 6 full rotations plus 90 degrees. Since each full rotation doesn't change the direction, only the 90 degrees does. So, starting at north, after a 90 degrees turn to the right, she is facing west. So, yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the number of degrees she spins in terms of how many times she goes around, but in the direction.

But wait, another thought: if she spins 2250 degrees to her right, does that mean she's turning 2250 degrees clockwise? I think so. So, 2250 degrees clockwise is the same as 2250 mod 360, right? Because spinning 360 degrees is the same as not spinning at all.

So, let me compute 2250 divided by 360.

360 times 6 is 2160. So, 2250 minus 2160 is 90. So, 2250 degrees is 6 full rotations plus 90 degrees. So, 6 full rotations bring her back to the starting direction, and then 90 degrees more. So, 90 degrees clockwise from north is west. So, the direction is west.

Wait, but another way to think about it: starting at north, each 90 degrees is a cardinal direction. So, 0 degrees is north, 90 is east, 180 is south, 270 is west. So, 2250 degrees is 90 degrees past 6 full rotations. So, 90 degrees is east, but since it's 2250, it's 90 degrees past. So, 90 degrees from north is east, but since it's 2250, it's 90 degrees, so that's east, but wait, no.

Wait, 2250 degrees is 6 full rotations (which don't change the direction) plus 90 degrees. So, after 6 full rotations, she is back at north, and then 90 degrees more.

So, starting facing north, after 90 degrees clockwise, she is facing west. So, yes, the direction is west.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about how many times she spins around. So, 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25. So, 6 full rotations and a quarter rotation.

A quarter rotation is 90 degrees. So, starting at north, a quarter rotation clockwise is west. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, if we think in terms of fractions of the circle. 360 degrees is a full circle. 2250 degrees is equal to 6 and 1/4 circles.

So, 6 full circles bring her back to starting point, and 1/4 circle is 90 degrees, which is a quarter turn. So, starting at north, a quarter turn clockwise is west.

But just to make sure, let me think about a simpler case. If she spins 90 degrees, she's facing west. If she spins 180 degrees, she's facing south. 270 degrees is west again, no, wait, 270 degrees would be 360 - 90, so that's 270 degrees, which is south. Wait, hold on, 270 degrees from north is south. Wait, no, 90 degrees is east, 180 is south, 270 is west? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, 0 degrees is north, 90 is east, 180 is south, 270 is west. So, 270 degrees is west. So, 90 degrees is east, 180 is south, 270 is west.

So, if she spins 90 degrees, she's facing east. 180 is south, 270 is west.

So, 270 degrees from north is west. So, 90 degrees is east, 270 is west. So, 2250 degrees is 6 full rotations plus 90, which is east, but wait, 2250 is 6.25 rotations.

Wait, 2250 is 6.25 rotations. So, 6.25 rotations is 6 full rotations (back to north) plus 0.25 rotation, which is 90 degrees. So, 0.25 rotation is a quarter turn, which is 90 degrees.

So, 0.25 rotation is a quarter turn. So, a quarter turn clockwise from north is west.

Wait, but now I'm confused because 270 degrees is west, but 90 is east, 225 is east again? Wait, no, 225 degrees is 225/360 = 0.625 of a rotation, so 0.625 * 360 = 225 degrees. So, from north, 225 degrees would be 225/4 = 56.25, which is 56.25 degrees? Wait, no, 225 degrees is 225 degrees, which is 56.25 degrees past 180, which is south? Wait, no.

Wait, 225 degrees is 180 + 45, so that's 45 degrees past 180 degrees, which is south. So, 180 is south, 225 is 45 degrees past south, which is southwest. Wait, no, no, 180 is south, and 225 is 45 degrees past that, which is southwest.

Wait, no, 225 is east? Wait, no. Let me think. 0 degrees is north, 90 east, 180 south, 270 west.

So, 0: north

90: east

180: south

270: west

360: north

So, each 90 degrees is a cardinal direction.

So, 225 degrees is 225/360 = 0.625 of a circle. 0.625 * 90 = 56.25 degrees. So, 56.25 degrees past 180, which is south. So, that would be 180 + 56.25 = 236.25 degrees, which is southwest.

Wait, but 225 degrees from north is 225 degrees, which is 225/360 = 0.625 of a circle, which is 56.25 degrees past 180, which is south, so that's 180 + 56.25 = 236.25 degrees. So, southwest.

But in our problem, we have 2250 degrees. So, 2250 is 6 full rotations plus 90 degrees. So, starting at north, 90 degrees clockwise is west. So, 2250 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees, so west.

But wait, earlier I thought 225 degrees is 225, but if 0 to 90 is east, then 90 is east, 180 is south, 270 is west, 360 is north, etc. So, 225 degrees is 225/360 = 0.625 of a circle, which is a bit more than halfway around. So, 180 is south, 225 is 45 degrees past south, which is southwest.

Wait, but 2250 degrees is much more than 225 degrees. So, 2250 is 6 full rotations plus 90 degrees. So, each full rotation brings her back to the starting point, so 2250 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees. So, 90 degrees clockwise from north is west.

So, perhaps I was confused because I thought 225 was 225, but in reality, 2250 is 6 full rotations plus 90.

So, to figure this out, perhaps another way: 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25, which is 6 full circles and a quarter. So, 0.25 circles is 90 degrees. So, from north, 90 degrees is west.

Alternatively, 0.25 is a quarter turn. So, a quarter turn clockwise from north is west. So, yeah, the direction is west.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought about 225 degrees, that was 225, which is 225/360 = 0.625. So, 0.625 of a circle, which is 270 degrees. So, 270 degrees is west.

Wait, so 270 is west, but 225 is 225, which is 225 degrees. Wait, that's a different number.

So, 225 degrees is 225/360 = 0.625, which is 270 degrees? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, 225 degrees is 225/360 = 0.625, which is 0.625 * 360 = 225. So, 225 degrees is 225 degrees. So, 225/4 is 56.25, so that's 56.25 degrees from 180, which is south. So, 180 + 56.25 is 236.25, which is southwest.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think of it as fractions of the circle.

So, 2250 degrees is 6 full rotations (360 * 6 = 2160) plus 90 degrees. So, starting at north, 2250 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees. So, 90 degrees from north is west.

So, the answer should be west.

Alternatively, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using modular arithmetic.

So, 2250 divided by 360 is 6 with a remainder of 90. So, 2250 = 6*360 + 90. So, 90 degrees beyond full rotations. So, starting at north, 90 degrees clockwise is west.

So, yeah, it's west.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent the rotation as a function. So, if you spin theta degrees to the right, your direction is (north + theta degrees clockwise). So, starting at north, spinning theta degrees clockwise is equivalent to (0 + theta) degrees in standard position.

But in standard position, 0 is north, 90 is east, 180 is south, 270 is west, etc. So, to convert theta degrees to standard position, we can use the formula:

Standard position = (theta mod 360) degrees.

But if theta is to the right, it's a clockwise rotation, which is equivalent to subtracting from 0.

Wait, actually, in standard position, 0 is north, 90 is east, 180 is south, 270 is west. So, a clockwise rotation is equivalent to subtracting from the standard position.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to model the direction as a coordinate system. Let me think.

In the standard coordinate system, 0 degrees is along the positive x-axis (east). But in our case, 0 degrees is north. So, maybe it's better to adjust the coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of direction as angles from north, east, south, west. So, north is 0, east is 1, south is 2, west is 3.

Then, each 90-degree rotation clockwise would correspond to subtracting from the angle. So, starting at north (0), a 90-degree rotation is 0 - 1 = -1, which is equivalent to 3 in modulo 4. So, 3 corresponds to west.

Similarly, 180 degrees would be 0 - 2 = -2, which is 2 modulo 4, which is south.

225 degrees would be 0 - 3 = -3, which is 1 modulo 4, which is east.

Wait, so 225 degrees is east? But earlier, I thought 225 degrees was 225 degrees from north, which is 225 degrees in the standard coordinate system, but in our case, 225 degrees clockwise would be different.

Wait, maybe my initial approach is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of angles. Let me represent north as 0 degrees, east as 90 degrees, south as 180 degrees, west as 270 degrees.

So, in this system, a full circle is 360 degrees, so 0 is north, 90 is east, 180 is south, 270 is west.

Now, if she spins 2250 degrees to the right (clockwise), that would be equivalent to subtracting from the angle.

So, 2250 degrees. But since 360 is a full rotation, we can subtract multiples of 360 to get an equivalent angle between 0 and 360.

So, 2250 divided by 360 is 6 with a remainder of 90, so 2250 = 6*360 + 90.

So, 90 degrees in this system is east. So, starting at north (0), spinning 90 degrees to the right is east. So, 2250 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees, which is east. So, the answer would be east.

Wait, now I'm really confused because earlier, I thought it was west, but now it's east.

Wait, let me check with another method. If she spins 360 degrees, she's facing the same direction, so 0 degrees. 720 degrees is also 0, and so on.

So, 2250 degrees. So, 2250 divided by 360 is 6 with a remainder of 90. So, 90 degrees is east.

So, if starting at north, 90 degrees to the right is east. So, 2250 degrees is east.

Wait, that conflicts with my earlier conclusion.

Wait, maybe I was wrong the first time.

Wait, let's confirm with a step-by-step.

Starting direction: north.

She spins 3 times 360 degrees (720 degrees) brings her back to north.

Then, she spins another 900 degrees. Wait, 900 is 2.5 rotations, but since 900 is 2*360 + 180, so 180 degrees. So, starting at north, 180 degrees to the right is west.

But 900 is 2.5 rotations, which is 900, but 900 is 2.5 * 360, which is 900. So, 2.5 rotations is 900. So, that's 2 full rotations (back to north) plus 90 degrees, which is east.

Wait, so starting at north, 900 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees, which is east.

So, 900 = 2*360 + 90, so 90 degrees east.

Wait, so 900 is east. So, 2250 is 6*360 + 90, which is 90 degrees, which is east.

But earlier, I thought 2250 was 90 degrees, so east.

Wait, but in my first approach, I thought 2250 is 90 degrees, which is west.

But in the coordinate system where north is 0, east is 90, south is 180, west is 270, 2250 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees, which is east.

Wait, so perhaps the answer is east.

But in the other approach, when I thought 2250 is 90 degrees, which is west, that seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify: is north 0 or 90 in this system? Because depending on the convention, it can change things.

Wait, in the standard coordinate system, 0 degrees is along the positive x-axis (east), 90 degrees is north, 180 degrees is west, 270 degrees is south. So, in that case, 0 is east, 90 is north, 180 is west, 270 is south.

So, if north is 90 degrees, then 2250 degrees is 2250 mod 360 = 90. So, 90 degrees is north.

Wait, so in this system, 90 degrees is north, so 2250 degrees is north.

Wait, this is confusing because different sources use different conventions.

Wait, maybe the key is that when you spin to the right, it's a clockwise rotation, which is different from the standard mathematical coordinate system.

In standard math, 0 degrees is east, 90 is north, 180 is west, 270 is south. So, in that case, a right spin is clockwise, which is the opposite of standard rotation.

In standard rotation, 0 is east, 90 is north, 180 is west, 270 is south. If you spin clockwise, it's like going into the negative y-axis direction.

So, perhaps in standard math, a right spin is equivalent to a negative angle.

So, in standard coordinate system, 0 is east, positive angles go counterclockwise, negative angles go clockwise.

So, if she spins 2250 degrees to the right, which is clockwise, that would be equivalent to -2250 degrees.

But since angles are periodic modulo 360, -2250 degrees is equivalent to -2250 + 7*360 = -2250 + 2520 = 270 degrees.

So, 270 degrees in standard coordinate system is south. So, starting at north, 270 degrees clockwise is south. So, that would be south.

Wait, so that's different from 90 degrees.

Wait, so which one is correct? Depending on the coordinate system.

Wait, let's be precise.

In the standard coordinate system, 0 degrees is east, positive angles go counterclockwise, negative angles go clockwise.

A right spin is clockwise, so 2250 degrees clockwise is equivalent to -2250 degrees.

Convert -2250 degrees to a positive angle by adding 7*360 (since 2250 / 360 = 6.25, so 7*360 is 2520). So, -2250 + 2520 = 270 degrees.

So, 270 degrees in standard coordinate system is south, so starting at north, spinning 2250 degrees clockwise is south.

Wait, so that's a different conclusion.

Wait, earlier, when I thought of 2250 as 90 degrees, which is east, but if I think in standard math, 2250 is 270.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should think about 1 rotation being 360 degrees. So, 2250 degrees is 6 full rotations plus 90. So, 90 degrees. So, starting at north, 90 degrees clockwise is west.

But in standard coordinate system, 90 degrees clockwise is west, which is 270 in standard math.

Wait, that's not matching. So, conflicting conclusions.

Wait, maybe the key is that 90 degrees to the right is west, but in standard math, 90 degrees is north.

Wait, no, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the direction she's facing.

Wait, in standard coordinate system, 0 is east, 90 is north, 180 is west, 270 is south.

So, starting at north (90 degrees). If she spins 90 degrees to the right (clockwise), that would be 90 + 90 = 180, which is west.

So, 90 degrees right is west.

Similarly, 180 degrees right is 270, which is south.

So, 90 right is west, 180 right is south, 270 right is east.

So, 2250 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees right.

So, starting at north, 90 degrees right is west.

So, in standard coordinate system, that would be west.

Therefore, the answer is west.

But in the earlier approach, when using modulo 360, if we consider 0 as east, 90 as north, 180 as west, 270 as south, then 2250 mod 360 is 90, so 90 is north.

But that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the problem is defined such that north is 0, east is 90, south is 180, west is 270.

So, in that case, 2250 degrees is 90 degrees, which is east.

Wait, so depending on the mapping of 0 to north, the answer can be east or west.

Wait, maybe the problem defines east as 0, so 0 is east, 90 is north, 180 is west, 270 is south.

So, perhaps in their system, 2250 degrees is 2250 mod 360 = 2250 - 6*360 = 2250 - 2160 = 90, which is north.

So, 2250 is 90, which is north.

But in this case, the answer is north.

But that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify the problem.

Wait, the problem says: "A figure skater is facing north when she begins to spin to her right. She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?"

So, the key is, what is the definition of right spin? Is right spin clockwise or counter-clockwise.

In common usage, "to your right" is usually counter-clockwise, which is 90, 180, etc., which is standard math.

But in the problem, it's not specified, so it's ambiguous.

Wait, but in the problem, it's just a figure skater spinning to her right, which is a common term in the context.

So, in standard terms, "to your right" is counter-clockwise, which is 90, 180, etc., which is the standard math coordinate system.

So, in standard math, the figure skater is spinning 90, 180, etc., which is counter-clockwise.

So, in that case, 2250 degrees counter-clockwise.

But in standard math, 0 is east, 90 is north, 180 is west, 270 is south.

So, if she starts at north (90), and spins 2250 degrees counter-clockwise.

So, in standard math, counter-clockwise is positive angles.

So, starting at 90 (north), adding 2250 degrees counter-clockwise (positive angles), but 2250 is a large angle.

But since 360 is a full rotation, 2250 mod 360 is 2250 - 6*360 = 2250 - 2160 = 90.

So, 2250 degrees counter-clockwise is 90 degrees, which is north.

Wait, that can't be. 2250 mod 360 is 90, so 90 degrees counter-clockwise from north is east.

Wait, no.

Wait, in standard math, 0 degrees is east, so adding 90 degrees counter-clockwise is north, which is 90.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in standard math, 0 is east, so 90 degrees counter-clockwise is north.

Wait, let me get this straight.

In standard math, 0 is east, 90 is north, 180 is west, 270 is south.

So, if you spin counter-clockwise (which is the direction of positive angles), starting at north (90), one rotation is 360, so 360 is back to north.

Wait, no, 360 is a full circle, same as 0.

Wait, no, in standard math, 0 is east, 90 is north, 180 is west, 270 is south, 360 is east again.

So, if you spin counter-clockwise, adding angles.

So, starting at north (90), adding 2250 degrees counter-clockwise.

But since 360 is a full circle, 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25, so that's 6 full rotations (back to east) plus 2250 - 6*360 = 2250 - 2160 = 90.

So, 2250 degrees counter-clockwise is equivalent to 90 degrees counter-clockwise from east.

So, 0 degrees is east, adding 90 counter-clockwise (which is 90 degrees counter-clockwise) brings you to north.

So, 2250 degrees counter-clockwise is north.

Wait, so if the skater is spinning counter-clockwise (to her right), which is 90 degrees counter-clockwise, 2250 is 90 counter-clockwise, which is north.

But in standard coordinate system, north is 90, which is consistent.

Wait, so in that case, starting at north, spinning 2250 degrees counter-clockwise is north.

Wait, but earlier, in my first approach, if I think of 2250 as 90 degrees, which is west, but if I think of it as 90 degrees counter-clockwise, which is north.

So, which is it?

Wait, perhaps the confusion is because the term "to your right" can be ambiguous. If it's a right-handed coordinate system, where to your right is counter-clockwise, then 2250 degrees counter-clockwise is north.

But if the coordinate system is such that to your right is clockwise, then 2250 degrees clockwise is west.

So, which is it?

Wait, in the problem statement, it just says "to her right," so it's ambiguous.

But in common terms, "to your right" is counter-clockwise, which is positive in standard math, so 90, 180, etc.

So, in that case, 2250 degrees counter-clockwise is north.

Wait, but in standard math, 90 counter-clockwise is north, so 90 counter-clockwise is north, and 2250 is 90 counter-clockwise, so that's north.

Wait, no, 90 counter-clockwise is north.

Wait, 0 is east, 90 counter-clockwise is north.

So, 90 counter-clockwise is north.

So, 2250 is 6 full rotations plus 90, so it's 90 counter-clockwise from east, which is north.

So, starting at north, spinning counter-clockwise 90 is north? Wait, no.

Wait, no, spinning counter-clockwise from north.

Wait, starting at north (90 degrees), spinning 90 degrees counter-clockwise would bring you back to north? No, wait.

Wait, no, starting at north, spinning counter-clockwise 90 degrees would bring you to east.

Wait, hold on.

In standard math, 0 is east, so starting at north (90), spinning counter-clockwise 90 degrees is 90 + 90 = 180, which is west.

Wait, so 90 counter-clockwise is west.

Wait, this is really confusing.

Wait, maybe I should just draw a diagram.

Imagine the coordinate system where 0 is east, 90 is north, 180 is west, 270 is south.

Starting at north (90), spinning counter-clockwise (positive direction) 90 degrees: 90 + 90 = 180, which is west.

So, 90 counter-clockwise is west.

Similarly, 180 counter-clockwise is 270, which is south.

Wait, so 90 counter-clockwise is west, 180 is south, 270 is east, and 360 is back to east.

Wait, no, 360 is back to east.

Wait, 0 is east, 90 is north, 180 is west, 270 is south, 360 is east again.

So, 90 counter-clockwise from north is west, 180 counter-clockwise is south, 270 counter-clockwise is east, 360 counter-clockwise is north.

Wait, so 90 counter-clockwise is west, 180 is south, 270 is east, 360 is north.

So, if she spins 90 counter-clockwise, she's facing west.

Similarly, 180 counter-clockwise is south, 270 is east, 360 is north.

So, if she spins 2250 degrees counter-clockwise.

First, 2250 divided by 360 is 6 with a remainder of 90.

So, 2250 is 6 full rotations plus 90. So, 90 counter-clockwise from north is west.

Therefore, her direction is west.

Wait, so in that case, the answer is west.

But in the other approach, where we considered 2250 as 90 degrees clockwise, which is east, but in standard coordinate system, 90 degrees clockwise is east, but in that case, we had to flip the coordinate system.

Wait, seems like this is the key point.

So, to resolve this, perhaps the answer is west.

So, let me recap:

1. If "to your right" is counter-clockwise (positive angle), then 2250 degrees counter-clockwise.

2. 2250 divided by 360 is 6 with remainder 90.

3. 90 counter-clockwise from north (90) is west.

Alternatively, if we consider 2250 as 90 degrees clockwise, but in standard coordinate system, 90 degrees clockwise is east, which is different.

Therefore, it's important to know what direction is considered to be right.

In common terms, "to your right" is counter-clockwise, which is the positive direction in standard math.

Therefore, the answer is west.

So, putting it all together.

Starting direction: north.

Spinning 2250 degrees counter-clockwise.

2250 / 360 = 6 with remainder 90.

Therefore, 90 counter-clockwise from north is west.

So, she's facing west when she finishes.

**Final Answer**
She is facing \boxed{B} direction when she finishes her spin.

Wait, but in my earlier thinking, I concluded west, which is option B.

So, the final answer is west.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
</think>

A figure skater starts facing north and begins spinning to her right, which is equivalent to a counter-clockwise rotation. She spins 2250 degrees. 

1. **Convert the total rotation to full circles and remaining degrees**:
   - 2250 degrees divided by 360 gives 6 full rotations with a remainder of 90 degrees.
   - Therefore, 2250 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees beyond full rotations.

2. **Determine the direction after 90 degrees counter-clockwise**:
   - Starting from north (0 degrees in standard math notation where 90 degrees is north), a counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees brings her to the west direction.

Thus, after spinning 2250 degrees counter-clockwise, she is facing west.

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
