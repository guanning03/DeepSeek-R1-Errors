Question:
The polynomial $x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1$ is a factor of $x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r.$  Enter the ordered triple $(p,q,r).$

Correct Answer:
Let $\alpha$ be a root of $x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 = 0,$ so $\alpha^3 = 3 \alpha^2 - 4 \alpha + 1.$  Then
\[\alpha^4 = 3 \alpha^3 - 4 \alpha^2 + \alpha = 3 (3 \alpha^2 - 4 \alpha + 1) - 4 \alpha^2 + \alpha = 5 \alpha^2 - 11 \alpha + 3.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
\alpha^6 &= (3 \alpha^2 - 4 \alpha + 1)^2 \\
&= 9 \alpha^4 - 24 \alpha^3 + 22 \alpha^2 - 8 \alpha + 1 \\
&= 9 (5 \alpha^2 - 11 \alpha + 3) - 24 (3 \alpha^2 - 4 \alpha + 1) + 22 \alpha^2 - 8 \alpha + 1 \\
&= -5 \alpha^2 - 11 \alpha + 4,
\end{align*}and
\begin{align*}
\alpha^9 &= \alpha^3 \cdot \alpha^6 \\
&= (3 \alpha^2 - 4 \alpha + 1)(-5 \alpha^2 - 11 \alpha + 4) \\
&= -15 \alpha^4 - 13 \alpha^3 + 51 \alpha^2 - 27 \alpha + 4 \\
&= -15 (5 \alpha^2 - 11 \alpha + 3) - 13 (3 \alpha^2 - 4 \alpha + 1) + 51 \alpha^2 - 27 \alpha + 4 \\
&= -63 \alpha^2 + 190 \alpha - 54.
\end{align*}Then
\begin{align*}
\alpha^9 + p \alpha^6 + q \alpha^3 + r &= (-63 \alpha^2 + 190 \alpha - 54) + p (-5 \alpha^2 - 11 \alpha + 4) + q (3 \alpha^2 - 4 \alpha + 1) + r \\
&= (-5p + 3q - 63) \alpha^2 + (-11p - 4q + 190) \alpha + (4p + q + r - 54).
\end{align*}We want this to reduce to 0, so we set
\begin{align*}
-5p + 3q &= 63, \\
11p + 4q &= 190, \\
4p + q + r &= 54.
\end{align*}Solving, we find $(p,q,r) = \boxed{(6,31,-1)}.$   For these values, $\alpha^9 + p \alpha^6 + q \alpha^3 + r$ reduces to 0 for any root $\alpha$ of $x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1,$ so $x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r$ will be divisible by $x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1.$

Gold:
(6,31,-1)

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I need to figure out the ordered triple (p, q, r) such that the polynomial \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \) is a factor of \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \). Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

First, if \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \) is a factor of \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \), then when I divide \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \) by \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \), there should be no remainder. That means \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \) can be written as \( (x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1)(something) \). So, I need to figure out what that "something" is, which will give me the values of p, q, and r.

I remember that when you have a polynomial that's a factor, you can find it by polynomial division, but that might be tedious here since both polynomials are of high degree. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, the polynomial \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \) is a cubic, and when you multiply it by another polynomial, the result will be a higher degree. Since \( x^9 \) is the highest term in the given polynomial, we can expect that the other polynomial must be of degree 6 because 9 - 3 = 6. So, the other factor is a 6th-degree polynomial. Let me denote that as \( x^6 + a x^5 + b x^4 + c x^3 + d x^2 + e x + f \). So, the product will be:

\( (x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1)(x^6 + a x^5 + b x^4 + c x^3 + d x^2 + e x + f) \)

And this should equal \( x^9 + p x^6 + q x^3 + r \). So, let me multiply those out step by step.

First, let's multiply \( x^3 \) with each term in the 6th-degree polynomial:

\( x^3 * x^6 = x^9 \)

\( x^3 * a x^5 = a x^8 \)

\( x^3 * b x^4 = b x^7 \)

\( x^3 * c x^3 = c x^6 \)

\( x^3 * d x^2 = d x^5 \)

\( x^3 * e x = e x^4 \)

\( x^3 * f = f x^3 \)

Next, multiply -3x^2 with each term:

\( -3x^2 * x^6 = -3x^8 \)

\( -3x^2 * a x^5 = -3a x^7 \)

\( -3x^2 * b x^4 = -3b x^6 \)

\( -3x^2 * c x^3 = -3c x^5 \)

\( -3x^2 * d x^2 = -3d x^4 \)

\( -3x^2 * e x = -3e x^3 \)

\( -3x^2 * f = -3f x^2 \)

Then, multiply +4x with each term:

\( 4x * x^6 = 4x^7 \)

\( 4x * a x^5 = 4a x^6 \)

\( 4x * b x^4 = 4b x^5 \)

\( 4x * c x^3 = 4c x^4 \)

\( 4x * d x^2 = 4d x^3 \)

\( 4x * e x = 4e x^2 \)

\( 4x * f = 4f x \)

Lastly, multiply -1 with each term:

\( -1 * x^6 = -x^6 \)

\( -1 * a x^5 = -a x^5 \)

\( -1 * b x^4 = -b x^4 \)

\( -1 * c x^3 = -c x^3 \)

\( -1 * d x^2 = -d x^2 \)

\( -1 * e x = -e x \)

\( -1 * f = -f \)

Now, let's collect all the terms by degree:

- The x^9 term: 1x^9
- The x^8 terms: (a - 3) x^8
- The x^7 terms: (b - 3a + 4) x^7
- The x^6 terms: (c - 3b + 4a - 1) x^6
- The x^5 terms: (d - 3c + 4b - a) x^5
- The x^4 terms: (e - 3d + 4c - b) x^4
- The x^3 terms: (f - 3e + 4d - c) x^3
- The x^2 terms: (-3f - d - e) x^2
- The x terms: (4f - e) x
- The constant term: -f

But we know that the product is equal to \( x^9 + p x^6 + q x^3 + r \), which means all the coefficients for the x^8, x^7, x^5, x^4, x^2, and x terms must be zero. So, let's set up equations based on the coefficients:

1. Coefficient of x^8: \( a - 3 = 0 \) => \( a = 3 \)
2. Coefficient of x^7: \( b - 3a + 4 = 0 \). Since a = 3, substitute: \( b - 9 + 4 = 0 \) => \( b = 5 \)
3. Coefficient of x^5: \( d - 3c + 4b - a = 0 \). Plugging in a = 3, b = 5: \( d - 3c + 20 - 3 = 0 \) => \( d - 3c + 17 = 0 \). Let's note this as equation (3).
4. Coefficient of x^4: \( e - 3d + 4c - b = 0 \). Substitute b = 5: \( e - 3d + 4c - 5 = 0 \). Equation (4).
5. Coefficient of x^2: \( -3f - d - e = 0 \). Equation (5).
6. Coefficient of x: \( 4f - e = 0 \). Equation (6).
7. Constant term: \( -f = r \). So, \( r = -f \). Equation (7).

Now, let's try to solve these equations step by step.

From equation (1): a = 3.

From equation (2): b = 5.

From equation (6): 4f - e = 0 => e = 4f.

From equation (5): -3f - d - e = 0. Substitute e = 4f: -3f - d - 4f = 0 => -7f - d = 0 => d = -7f.

From equation (4): e - 3d + 4c -5 =0. Substitute e =4f and d = -7f: 4f -3(-7f) +4c -5 =0 => 4f +21f +4c -5=0 => 25f +4c -5=0 => 4c = -25f +5 => c = (-25f +5)/4.

From equation (3): d -3c +17=0. Substitute d=-7f and c=(-25f +5)/4:

-7f -3*(-25f +5)/4 +17=0.

Let me compute this step by step:

First, multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate denominator:

-28f -3*(-25f +5) + 68 =0

Compute term by term:

-28f +75f -15 +68=0

Combine like terms:

(75f -28f) + (-15 +68)=0 => 47f +53=0 => 47f = -53 => f = -53/47.

Hmm, f is a fraction. Let me see if that makes sense. Let me write f = -53/47.

Then, e =4f =4*(-53/47)= -212/47.

d = -7f = -7*(-53/47)= 371/47.

c = (-25f +5)/4 = (-25*(-53/47) +5)/4 = (1325/47 +5)/4 = (1325/47 +235/47)/4 = (1560/47)/4 = 1560/188 = 390/47.

So, c=390/47.

Now, let's go back to equation (7): r = -f = -(-53/47)=53/47.

So, now we have:

a=3, b=5, c=390/47, d=371/47, e=-212/47, f=-53/47, r=53/47.

Therefore, the 6th-degree polynomial is:

\( x^6 + 3x^5 +5x^4 + (390/47)x^3 + (371/47)x^2 + (-212/47)x -53/47 \).

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but perhaps it's okay.

But wait, r is 53/47. Let me check if that's correct. Let's see, from equation (7), yes.

But maybe I made a mistake in calculations? Let me double-check.

Let me retrace:

From equation (3): d -3c +17=0.

d = -7f, c=(-25f +5)/4.

So, substituting:

-7f -3*(-25f +5)/4 +17=0.

Multiply all terms by 4:

-28f -3*(-25f +5) +68=0.

Which is:

-28f +75f -15 +68=0.

So, 47f +53=0 => f= -53/47.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, e=4f= -212/47, d=-7f=371/47.

c=(-25f +5)/4= (-25*(-53/47) +5)/4= (1325/47 +235/47)/4= (1560/47)/4= 390/47.

Thus, c=390/47.

Then, equation (4): e -3d +4c -5=0.

Substituting:

-212/47 -3*(371/47) +4*(390/47) -5=0.

Compute each term:

-212/47 -1113/47 +1560/47 -5=0.

Now, combine the fractions:

(-212 -1113 +1560)/47 -5= (235)/47 -5=5 -5=0.

Yes, that works.

Equation (5): -3f -d -e=0.

Plug f=-53/47, d=371/47, e=-212/47.

-3*(-53/47) -371/47 -(-212/47)= 159/47 -371/47 +212/47= (159 -371 +212)/47= (0)/47=0. Correct.

So, all equations are satisfied.

Alright, so now, to find p, q, r.

Looking back at the product:

\( x^9 + p x^6 + q x^3 + r \).

From our expansion, the only terms apart from x^9, x^6, x^3, and constant are the coefficients of x^8, x^7, etc., which are zero, which we've already accounted for.

But in the expansion, the x^6 term comes from the middle terms:

Wait, in the expansion, the coefficients of x^6 come from:

c x^6 + d x^5 + e x^4 + f x^3 + ... Hmm, no, wait, in the multiplication, x^3 * c x^3 = c x^6, so c x^6, and also, x^6 * something else?

Wait, no, in the multiplication, the coefficient of x^6 is c (from x^3 * c x^3) plus something else? Wait, no:

Wait, when we multiplied x^3 with the 6th-degree polynomial, we had terms like c x^6, but also, in the multiplication of -3x^2 with the 6th-degree polynomial, we had -3c x^5 and other terms. Similarly, 4x * 6th-degree polynomial gives 4c x^4, etc.

Wait, actually, the coefficients of x^6 in the product is c x^6 (from x^3 * c x^3) plus the x^6 from somewhere else? But wait, x^6 is only a term in the 6th-degree polynomial, but when we multiply x^3 (a cubic term) by the 6th-degree polynomial, the x^6 term comes only from x^3 * c x^3.

So, the coefficient of x^6 is just c. So, the coefficient p is c, which is 390/47.

Similarly, the coefficient of x^3 is from:

x^3 * f x^3 = f x^6, but no, wait, f is a coefficient in the 6th-degree polynomial. Wait, no, in the multiplication, the x^3 term in the 6th-degree polynomial multiplied by x^3 gives f x^6. But in the product, x^9 + p x^6 + q x^3 + r, the x^6 coefficient is p. So, p is f? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no, hold on: the x^3 * f x^3 = f x^6, which is part of the product. So, that would contribute to the x^6 term, so p is equal to f.

But wait, in the product, the x^6 term is p, so p = f.

But from our calculation, f = -53/47. So, p = -53/47.

Wait, but hold on, let me think again. The x^6 term in the product comes from two sources: x^3 * c x^3 = c x^6, and also, from -3x^2 * d x^4 = -3d x^6. Wait, but in our previous step, we only accounted for x^3 * c x^3. So, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no, in the multiplication, x^3 * c x^3 is c x^6, which is the only term contributing to x^6. The other terms, like -3x^2 * d x^4 is -3d x^6, but wait, how does that happen? Wait, no, no, when you multiply two polynomials, the x^6 term can only come from multiplying an x^k term from the first polynomial with an x^{6 - k} term from the second polynomial.

Wait, no, sorry, in this case, the first polynomial is x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x -1, and the second is a 6th-degree polynomial.

So, the x^6 term in the product comes from:

x^3 * c x^3 = c x^6

-3x^2 * d x^4 = -3d x^6

4x * e x^5 = 4e x^6

-1 * f x^3 = -f x^3

Wait, but the last term is -f x^3, which is in the 6th-degree polynomial? Wait, no, the 6th-degree polynomial is multiplied by x^3, so the term is f x^3. So, when we multiply -1 * f x^3, we get -f x^3, which is in the 6th-degree polynomial.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the second polynomial is 6th-degree, which is multiplied by x^3, so each term in the 6th-degree polynomial is multiplied by x^3.

So, the x^6 term in the product is:

x^3 * c x^3 = c x^6

-3x^2 * d x^4 = -3d x^6

4x * e x^5 = 4e x^6

-1 * f x^3 = -f x^3

Wait, so only the first three terms contribute to x^6, and the last term contributes to x^3.

Therefore, the coefficient of x^6 is c - 3d + 4e.

Wait, that's different than what I thought before. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. The x^6 coefficient is c - 3d + 4e.

Similarly, the coefficient of x^3 is f - 3e + 4d - c.

Wait, hold on, let's recast this.

Wait, maybe I should have thought about the expansion more carefully.

Let me write the product as:

\( (x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1)(x^6 + a x^5 + b x^4 + c x^3 + d x^2 + e x + f) \)

So, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial.

So, for the x^6 term:

- x^3 * c x^3 = c x^6

- -3x^2 * d x^4 = -3d x^6

- 4x * e x^5 = 4e x^6

- -1 * term? Wait, no, the second polynomial is only up to x^6, so when you multiply -1 by f x^3, you get -f x^3. So, that doesn't contribute to x^6.

So, the coefficient for x^6 is c - 3d + 4e.

Similarly, for x^3 term:

- x^3 * f x^3 = f x^6 (but that's x^6, not x^3, so doesn't contribute)

Wait, no, x^3 * f x^3 is f x^6, which is the x^6 term, not x^3.

Wait, so to get x^3 term in the product, we need to multiply:

- x^3 * d x^2 = d x^5 (doesn't contribute to x^3)

Wait, no, hold on. Let me list all the possible terms that can result in x^3.

Wait, actually, for the product to have x^3 term, the exponents from the two polynomials must add up to 3.

So, x^3 (from first poly) multiplied by x^0 (constant term of second poly). Similarly, -3x^2 multiplied by x^1, 4x multiplied by x^2, and -1 multiplied by x^3.

But wait, the second poly is degree 6, so x^0 is the constant term f, x^1 is e, x^2 is d, x^3 is c, x^4 is b, x^5 is a, x^6 is 1.

So, the x^3 term in the product is:

x^3 * f (from x^3 * f x^0)

-3x^2 * e (from -3x^2 * e x^1 = -3e x^3)

4x * d (from 4x * d x^2 = 4d x^3)

-1 * c (from -1 * c x^3 = -c x^3)

So, the coefficient of x^3 is f - 3e + 4d - c.

Therefore, in the product, the x^3 term is (f - 3e + 4d - c) x^3.

So, in the given polynomial, the x^3 term is q x^3, so q = f - 3e + 4d - c.

Similarly, the x^9 term is 1 x^9, as expected.

And the x^6 term is (c - 3d + 4e) x^6.

And in the given polynomial, the x^6 term is p x^6.

So, to recap:

- The coefficient of x^9 is 1, which is correct.

- The coefficient of x^6 is c - 3d + 4e = p.

- The coefficient of x^3 is f - 3e + 4d - c = q.

- The constant term is -f = r.

So, now, with all that, we can write equations for p, q, r.

From our earlier calculations:

From equation (3): d -3c +17=0.

We know d=371/47, c=390/47.

So, substitute:

371/47 - 3*(390/47) +17 = 0

Compute:

371/47 - 1170/47 + 17 = (371 - 1170)/47 +17 = (-799)/47 +17.

Convert 17 to 799/47? Wait, 17 is 799/47? Wait, 17*47=799. Yes, 17 is 799/47.

So, (-799 +799)/47=0. So, equation (3) is satisfied.

Similarly, let's compute p: p= c - 3d +4e.

c=390/47, d=371/47, e=-212/47.

So, p= (390/47) - 3*(371/47) +4*(-212/47).

Compute numerator:

390 - 1113 -848 = 390 - 1113 is -723, then -723 -848 is -1571.

So, p= (-1571)/47.

Wait, -1571 divided by 47. Let me compute:

47*33=1551, 47*34=1598. So, -1571= -1551 -20. So, -1571/47= -34 -20/47= -34.425 approximately. But we can write it as a fraction: -1571/47.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me see if that fraction reduces. Let's check if 47 divides 1571.

47*33=1551, 1571-1551=20, so 1571=47*33 +20, so no, 47 doesn't divide 1571. So, p= -1571/47.

Similarly, let's compute q= f -3e +4d -c.

Given f=-53/47, e=-212/47, d=371/47, c=390/47.

So, q= (-53/47) -3*(-212/47) +4*(371/47) -390/47.

Compute numerator:

-53 + 636 + 1484 -390.

Compute step by step:

-53 +636=583, 583 +1484=2067, 2067 -390=1677.

So, q=1677/47.

Again, check if 47 divides 1677.

47*35=1645, 1677-1645=32, so 1677=47*35 +32. So, it doesn't divide evenly. So, q=1677/47.

And finally, r=-f=53/47.

So, to recap:

p= -1571/47

q=1677/47

r=53/47

But these are fractions. Hmm, is that correct? The problem says the polynomial is a factor, so it should be exact. But maybe it's okay. Let me check if I made any calculation mistakes.

Wait, let's verify the equations again.

We have:

1. a=3

2. b=5

3. c=( -25f +5 )/4, with f=-53/47, so c=( -25*(-53/47) +5 )/4= (1325/47 +235/47)/4=1560/47 /4= 390/47. Correct.

4. d=-7f= -7*(-53/47)=371/47. Correct.

5. e=4f=4*(-53/47)= -212/47. Correct.

6. From equation (5): -3f -d -e=0. Plugging in f=-53/47, d=371/47, e=-212/47.

Compute: -3*(-53/47) -371/47 -(-212/47)= 159/47 -371/47 +212/47= (159 -371 +212)/47=0. Correct.

7. From equation (4): e -3d +4c -5=0.

Compute: -212/47 -3*(371/47) +4*(390/47) -5.

= -212/47 -1113/47 +1560/47 -5.

Convert 5 to 235/47: -212 -1113 +1560 -235 over 47.

Compute numerator: (-212 -1113) + (1560 -235)= (-1325) + (1325)=0. Correct.

8. From equation (3): d -3c +17=0.

Compute 371/47 -3*(390/47) +17= 371/47 -1170/47 +17= (-799)/47 +17= -17 +17=0. Correct.

So, all equations are satisfied. So, the coefficients are correct.

Therefore, the ordered triple is (p, q, r)= (-1571/47, 1677/47, 53/47).

But the problem says "Enter the ordered triple (p, q, r)." It doesn't specify whether it needs to be in fractions or decimals. But since it's a competition problem, fractions are usually acceptable.

But let me see if these fractions can be simplified further or if there's a miscalculation.

Wait, 53/47 is already in simplest form. 1677 divided by 47: 47*35=1645, 1677-1645=32, so 1677/47=35 +32/47.

Similarly, 1571/47: 47*33=1551, 1571-1551=20, so 1571/47=33 +20/47.

So, they are mixed numbers, but as improper fractions, they are fine.

So, maybe we can write this as:

p= -1571/47, q=1677/47, r=53/47.

But let me check if I can write these as integers. Let me see:

Wait, 1677 divided by 47: 47*35=1645, 1677-1645=32. So, 35 and 32/47.

Similarly, 1571 divided by47: 47*33=1551, 1571-1551=20. So, 33 and20/47.

But 53/47 is already reduced.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that f= -53/47.

Wait, let's verify equation (7): r= -f. So, if f= -53/47, then r=53/47. Correct.

So, I think that's correct. So, the ordered triple is (p, q, r)= (-1571/47, 1677/47, 53/47).

But let me see if these can be simplified further.

Looking at p= -1571/47. 1571 divided by47: 47*33=1551, 1571-1551=20. So, no, it can't be reduced.

Similarly, q=1677/47: 47*35=1645, 1677-1645=32. So, no, can't reduce.

r=53/47: 53 is prime, so can't reduce.

Therefore, the ordered triple is (-1571/47, 1677/47, 53/47). Hmm, but the problem might expect integer values. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, is there another approach? Maybe factor the given polynomial and see if the factor is a multiple of the given cubic.

Wait, given that the factor is a cubic, and the given polynomial is degree 9, which is 3*3, so perhaps it's (x^3 -3x^2 +4x -1)^3 or something.

But (x^3 -3x^2 +4x -1)^3 would be degree 9, but let me compute its expansion to see.

But that might be too time-consuming.

Alternatively, maybe factor the given cubic into linear factors and see if any of them are factors of the 9th-degree polynomial.

Let me try to factor x^3 -3x^2 +4x -1.

Using rational root theorem, possible roots are x=1, x=-1.

Test x=1: 1 -3 +4 -1=1, not zero.

Test x=-1: -1 -3 -4 -1=-9, not zero.

So, it doesn't have rational roots. So, it is irreducible over rationals. Therefore, it cannot be factored into lower-degree polynomials with integer coefficients. Thus, it must be factored as a product of three linear terms with irrational or complex roots.

But this complicates things, so factoring the 9th-degree polynomial into three cubics with one of them being x^3 -3x^2 +4x -1 is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the 9th-degree polynomial is equal to (x^3 -3x^2 +4x -1)^k multiplied by something.

But without knowing k, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe the given cubic is a factor of the 9th-degree polynomial, so the 9th-degree polynomial can be written as (x^3 -3x^2 +4x -1)*(something). But without knowing something, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps, instead of doing the long multiplication, I can use polynomial division.

But that might be too tedious.

Alternatively, maybe the 9th-degree polynomial is equal to (x^3 -3x^2 +4x -1)*(x^6 + a x^5 + b x^4 + c x^3 + d x^2 + e x + f), and we can set up equations based on the coefficients.

But that's essentially what I did before. So, maybe I have to accept that p, q, r are fractions as above.

But to check, perhaps I can plug in x=1 into the given cubic and into the 9th-degree polynomial, and see if it's zero.

Given cubic: 1 -3 +4 -1=1, so not zero.

So, x=1 is not a root of the cubic.

But if the cubic is a factor of the 9th-degree polynomial, it must have all roots of the cubic as roots of the 9th-degree polynomial.

But since the cubic doesn't have rational roots, maybe the 9th-degree polynomial can be written as (x^3 -3x^2 +4x -1)*(something), but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps if I consider the given cubic as a factor, then the 9th-degree polynomial is equal to (x^3 -3x^2 +4x -1)*(x^6 + a x^5 + b x^4 + c x^3 + d x^2 + e x + f), which is the same as before. So, yes, the coefficients p, q, r are as above.

Therefore, the ordered triple is (-1571/47, 1677/47, 53/47). But wait, 1571 is a prime? Let me check: 1571 divided by 47 is 33.4, as above, and 1571 is 47*33 +20, which is 1551 +20=1571.

Wait, 1571 is a prime? Let's check.

Check divisibility by primes up to sqrt(1571)≈39.6.

Divide 1571 by 2: no, it's odd.

By 3: 1+5+7+1=14, not divisible by 3.

By 5: ends with 1, no.

By 7: 1571 /7≈224.428, 7*224=1568, 1571-1568=3, not divisible.

By 11: 1-5+7-1=2, not divisible.

By 13: 1571 /13≈120.846, 13*120=1560, 1571-1560=11, not divisible.

By 17: 17*92=1564, 1571-1564=7, not divisible.

By 19: 19*82=1558, 1571-1558=13, not divisible.

By 23: 23*68=1564, 1571-1564=7, not divisible.

By 29:29*54=1566, 1571-1566=5, not divisible.

By 31:31*50=1550, 1571-1550=21, not divisible.

By 37:37*42=1554, 1571-1554=17, not divisible.

So, 1571 is a prime number. Therefore, the fraction can't be reduced further.

So, the ordered triple is (p, q, r)= (-1571/47, 1677/47, 53/47).

Alternatively, to confirm, let me compute p, q, r numerically:

Compute p= -1571/47≈-33.4255.

q=1677/47≈35.6808.

r=53/47≈1.1277.

So, p≈-33.4255, q≈35.6808, r≈1.1277.

But perhaps in the problem statement, they might expect integer coefficients, but given that the cubic is irreducible, I think fractional coefficients are acceptable.

Therefore, after thorough calculation, the ordered triple (p, q, r) is:

\( \left( -\dfrac{1571}{47}, \dfrac{1677}{47}, \dfrac{53}{47} \right) \).

**Final Answer**
The ordered triple is \boxed{\left( -\dfrac{1571}{47}, \dfrac{1677}{47}, \dfrac{53}{47} \right)}.

Given the polynomial \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \) is a factor of \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \). We need to find the ordered triple \( (p, q, r) \).

First, we recognize that if \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \) is a factor of the given polynomial, then the given polynomial can be written as the product of \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \) and another 6th-degree polynomial \( x^6 + ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f \).

We multiply these polynomials and equate the coefficients of the resulting polynomial to the given polynomial \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \).

The product of the polynomials is:
\[ (x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1)(x^6 + ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f) \]

By expanding and comparing coefficients, we derive the following system of equations:
1. \( a - 3 = 0 \) which gives \( a = 3 \)
2. \( b - 3a + 4 = 0 \) which gives \( b = 5 \)
3. \( c - 3b + 4a - 17 = 0 \) which gives \( c = \frac{390}{47} \)
4. \( e - 3c + 4b - a = 0 \) which gives \( d = -\frac{7f}{4} \)
5. \( -3f - d - e = 0 \) which gives \( f = -\frac{53}{47} \)
6. \( -3e - d - e = 0 \) which gives \( e = \frac{4f}{3} \)
7. \( -f = r \) which gives \( r = \frac{53}{47} \)

Solving these equations, we find:
- \( f = -\frac{53}{47} \)
- \( e = \frac{4f}{3} = \frac{371}{47} \)
- \( d = -\frac{7f}{4} = \frac{371}{47} \)
- \( c = \frac{390}{47} \)

Finally, we calculate the coefficients \( p \) and \( q \) using the derived values of \( c \) and \( e \):
- \( p = c - 3d + 4e = \frac{390}{47} - 3 \left( \frac{371}{47} \right) + 4 \left( \frac{371}{47} \right) = -\frac{1571}{47} \)
- \( q = f - 3e + 4d - c = -\frac{53}{47} - 3 \left( \frac{371}{47} \right) + 4 \left( \frac{390}{47} \right) - \frac{390}{47} = \frac{1677}{47} \)

Thus, the ordered triple is:
\[ \boxed{\left( -\dfrac{1571}{47}, \dfrac{1677}{47}, \dfrac{53}{47} \right)} \]
