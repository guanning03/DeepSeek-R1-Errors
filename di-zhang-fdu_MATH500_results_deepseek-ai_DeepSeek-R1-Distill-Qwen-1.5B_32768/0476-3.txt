Question:
Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE.

Correct Answer:
There are two E's, two L's, and seven total letters, so the answer is $\dfrac{7!}{2! \times 2!} = \boxed{1260}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I need to figure out how many ways there are to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE. Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling some basic principles of permutations and combinations. 

First off, I know that the number of ways to arrange n distinct objects is n factorial, which is n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1. But wait, in this case, the word ELLIPSE isn't made up of all distinct letters. Let me check the letters in ELLIPSE.

Breaking down the word ELLIPSE:
- E appears twice,
- L appears once,
- I appears once,
- P appears once,
- S appears once.

So, the letters are E, L, I, P, S, and E. Hmm, so there are 6 letters in total, but with the letter E repeating twice. That means not all letters are unique, so the total number of arrangements isn't simply 6! But since there are duplicates, I need to adjust for that.

I remember that when there are repeated elements in a permutation, we divide by the factorial of the number of repeats for each repeated element. So, in this case, since E is repeated twice, we'll divide by 2!. That formula, as I recall, is called the multiset permutation formula.

So, the formula should be 6! divided by 2! because of the duplicate E's. Let me write that down:

Number of arrangements = 6! / 2!

Let me compute that. 6! is 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, which is 720. Then, 2! is 2 × 1 = 2. So, 720 divided by 2 is 360. So, does that mean there are 360 distinct arrangements?

Wait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The word ELLIPSE has 6 letters, but with E appearing twice, so we have two E's. So, the formula is indeed 6! divided by 2!, which is 720 / 2 = 360.

But let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the positions one by one and calculating the number of choices at each step. But that might get complicated because of the repeated letter.

Alternatively, I can think of it as arranging the letters where the two E's are indistinct. So, if I were to arrange all 6 letters, the number of unique arrangements would be the total permutations minus the duplicates. But I think the formula I used earlier is more straightforward.

Wait another thought: If all letters were unique, it would be 6! = 720. But since we have two E's, each arrangement where the E's are swapped will be identical. So, each distinct arrangement is counted twice in the 720 total. Therefore, to get the unique count, we divide by 2. That's why it's 720 / 2 = 360.

Alternatively, to visualize it, imagine choosing positions for the E's first. There are 6 positions, and we need to choose 2 of them for the E's. The number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 6 is given by the combination formula C(6,2). Once the positions for E's are chosen, the remaining 4 positions can be filled by the other letters without any repetition, which is 4! ways.

So, the total number of arrangements would be C(6,2) × 4!.

Calculating that, C(6,2) is 15, and 4! is 24. So, 15 × 24 = 360. That matches the previous result. So, that's a good check.

Another way to think about it: If I list out all the letters, but considering E as identical, the number of unique permutations is 6! / 2!.

So, whether I use the combination method or the permutation formula with repetition, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 360 is indeed the correct number of arrangements.

Wait, just to be thorough, let me try to manually compute this, although it might take some time.

Starting with the first letter, how many choices do I have? The first letter can be any of E, L, I, P, S, or E. But since E is repeated, maybe I should consider treating the two E's as identical.

Wait, this might get too complicated because of the overlapping possibilities. Maybe sticking with the formula is better.

Alternatively, if I were to list all permutations, but that would be impractical because there are 6 letters, leading to 6! = 720 permutations, but with duplicates, so many duplicates. But since I know the formula gives 360, and multiple methods lead to the same answer, I think that's the way to go.

Wait, perhaps another way: Suppose we arrange all 6 letters without considering the repetition, which is 720. Then, since E is repeated twice, each arrangement where the two E's are swapped is essentially the same. So, each unique arrangement is counted twice in the total. Therefore, to get the unique count, we divide by 2, which is 720 / 2 = 360. So, that's another way to see it.

Alternatively, if I were to assign letters to positions one by one, considering that the first two positions can be occupied by E's, but that seems messy. I think the formula is the most straightforward.

So, to sum up, the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE is 360.

**Final Answer**
The number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE is \boxed{360}.
</think>

To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE, we start by noting that the word consists of 6 letters, with the letter E appearing twice and the other letters appearing once. 

The formula for permutations of a multiset, which accounts for repeated elements, is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{k_1! \cdot k_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot k_m!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items, and \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m \) are the frequencies of the distinct items. In this case, \( n = 6 \) (since there are 6 letters) and \( k_1 = 2 \) (since E appears twice).

Thus, the number of distinct arrangements is:

\[
\frac{6!}{2!}
\]

Calculating this, we have:

\[
6! = 720
\]
\[
2! = 2
\]
\[
\frac{720}{2} = 360
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE is \boxed{360}.
