Correct Answer:
Since $\overline{OH}$ and $\overline{NH}$ are tangent to radii of the circle at $O$ and $N$, we have $\angle O =\angle N = 90^\circ$.  The sum of the measures of the interior angles of quadrilateral $JOHN$ is $360^\circ$, so $\angle J + \angle H = 360^\circ - \angle O - \angle N = \boxed{180^\circ}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem about circle \( J \). It says that \( HO \) and \( HN \) are tangent to the circle at points \( O \) and \( N \), respectively. I need to find the sum of the measures of angle \( J \) and angle \( H \). 

First, let me try to visualize this. There's a circle with center \( J \). From point \( H \), which is outside the circle, two tangent lines are drawn: one touches the circle at \( O \) and the other at \( N \). So, \( HO \) and \( HN \) are tangent to the circle. The figure also draws the circle, points \( O \) and \( N \), and connects them to form triangle \( JON \).

Wait, in the Asymptote code, they mention drawing a circle with center \( J \), points \( O \) and \( N \), and lines connecting \( J \) to \( O \), \( N \), \( H \), and so on. Maybe I should sketch this in my mind or on paper to better understand the setup.

So, points \( O \) and \( N \) are points of tangency from \( H \). That means \( HO \) and \( HN \) are tangent lines to the circle \( J \). From what I remember, the tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. So, \( JO \) is perpendicular to \( HO \), and \( JN \) is perpendicular to \( HN \). That gives me two right angles at \( O \) and \( N \).

Let me note that down:

- \( \angle HOJ = 90^\circ \)
- \( \angle HNJ = 90^\circ \)

So, quadrilateral \( HOJN \) has two right angles at \( O \) and \( N \). But what else do I know about this quadrilateral? Since \( HO \) and \( HN \) are both tangent from point \( H \) to the circle, they should be equal in length. That is, \( HO = HN \). So, triangle \( HON \) is an isosceles triangle with \( HO = HN \).

Wait a second, but triangle \( HON \) is inside the circle, right? But actually, triangle \( J \) is the center, so maybe I should think about triangle \( J \) something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider triangle \( J \) connected to points \( O \) and \( N \). So, triangle \( JO \) and triangle \( JN \) are both radii of the circle. So, \( JO = JN \), making triangle \( JON \) an isosceles triangle as well.

So, if I can figure out the measure of angle \( J \) in triangle \( JON \), and also the measure of angle \( H \), then I can add them together.

But before that, let me think about the positions of points \( O \) and \( N \). Since \( HO \) and \( HN \) are tangents from \( H \) to the circle, point \( H \) lies outside the circle, and \( O \) and \( N \) are the points where the tangents touch the circle.

I remember that the length of a tangent from a point outside the circle is equal. So, \( HO = HN \). That tells me that triangle \( HON \) is isosceles with \( HO = HN \). So, angles opposite those sides should be equal.

But wait, in triangle \( HON \), sides \( HO \) and \( HN \) are equal, so angles \( \angle HON \) and \( \angle HON \) (Wait, no, triangle \( HON \) is different. Let me clarify.)

Actually, in triangle \( HON \), sides \( HO \) and \( HN \) are equal, so the base angles are equal. The base angles are \( \angle HON \) and \( \angle HON \). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, triangle \( HON \) has vertices at \( H \), \( O \), and \( N \). So, sides are \( HO \), \( ON \), and \( HN \). Since \( HO = HN \), the triangle is isosceles with equal sides \( HO \) and \( HN \). Therefore, the angles opposite those sides are equal. The sides opposite angles at \( O \) and \( N \) are \( HN \) and \( HO \), so those angles are equal. Therefore, \( \angle HON \) at point \( O \) and \( \angle HNO \) at point \( N \) are equal.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to think about the overall figure.

Since \( HO \) and \( HN \) are tangent lines from \( H \) to circle \( J \), and \( JO \) and \( JN \) are radii perpendicular to the tangent lines at the points of contact, so \( \angle HOJ = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle HN J = 90^\circ \).

Therefore, quadrilateral \( HOJN \) has two right angles at \( O \) and \( N \). So, that quadrilateral is a kite because \( JO = JN \) (radii) and \( HO = HN \) (tangents from a common external point). A kite has two pairs of adjacent sides equal. So, in this case, sides \( JO \) and \( JN \) are equal, and sides \( HO \) and \( HN \) are equal.

Furthermore, the diagonals of a kite are perpendicular. So, the diagonals \( HJ \) and \( ON \) are perpendicular. Wait, is that correct? Or is it \( JH \) and \( ON \)? Let me think.

Wait, the diagonals of a kite are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So, in quadrilateral \( HOJN \), the diagonals would be \( HJ \) connecting \( H \) and \( J \), and \( ON \) connecting \( O \) and \( N \). So, yes, \( HJ \) and \( ON \) are the diagonals and are perpendicular.

Therefore, \( HJ \perp ON \).

So, if I can figure out the measure of angle \( J \) in triangle \( JON \), which is the central angle subtended by arc \( ON \). Then, I can relate it to the inscribed angles at points \( O \) and \( N \).

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the central angle. Since the central angle is \( \angle J \), and the inscribed angles subtended by the same arc are equal. Hmm, but in this case, the points \( O \) and \( N \) are points of tangency, which may not necessarily be on the same circle.

Wait, actually, points \( O \) and \( N \) lie on the original circle, so the arc \( ON \) is a part of circle \( J \). Therefore, the central angle \( \angle J \) is equal to the measure of arc \( ON \). So, if we can find the measure of arc \( ON \), we can find angle \( J \).

But how can we find the measure of arc \( ON \)?

Well, since \( HO \) and \( HN \) are tangents from point \( H \) to circle \( J \), the angle between the two tangents can be found using the formula for the angle between two tangents from an external point.

I recall that the angle between two tangents from an external point is equal to the difference between 180 degrees and the measure of the central angle subtended by the points of tangency. The formula is:

\( \angle H = 180^\circ - 2 \times \angle J \)

Wait, no, actually, the angle between two tangents from an external point is equal to the difference between 180 degrees and the central angle. Let me recall correctly.

If \( \theta \) is the angle between the two tangents from an external point \( H \), then \( \theta = 180^\circ - 2 \times \angle J \), where \( \angle J \) is the central angle subtended by arc \( ON \).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe it's \( \angle H = 2 \times \angle J \). Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right because if I have two tangents, the angle between them should be related to the central angle.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the angle \( \angle H \) in terms of the central angle.

Let me denote \( \angle J \) as \( \alpha \). Then, since quadrilateral \( HOJN \) is a kite with two right angles at \( O \) and \( N \), the other two angles at \( H \) and \( J \) must add up to 180 degrees, because in a quadrilateral, the sum of internal angles is 360 degrees. So, \( 90^\circ + 90^\circ + \angle H + \angle J = 360^\circ \), which simplifies to \( 180^\circ + \angle H + \angle J = 360^\circ \), hence \( \angle H + \angle J = 180^\circ \).

Wait, that's a useful relationship. So, \( \angle H + \angle J = 180^\circ \). Therefore, if I can find either \( \angle H \) or \( \angle J \), I can find the other.

But how can I find \( \angle H \)? Let me think about triangle \( HON \). Since \( HO = HN \), triangle \( HON \) is isosceles with base angles at \( O \) and \( N \) equal. Let me denote each base angle as \( \beta \). Therefore, \( \angle HON = \angle HNO = \beta \).

But wait, in quadrilateral \( HOJN \), angles at \( O \) and \( N \) are \( 90^\circ \). So, the sum of all angles in quadrilateral \( HOJN \) is 360 degrees. Therefore:

\( 90^\circ + 90^\circ + \angle H + \angle J = 360^\circ \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 180^\circ + \angle H + \angle J = 360^\circ \)

So,

\( \angle H + \angle J = 180^\circ \)

So, that gives me one equation: \( \angle H + \angle J = 180^\circ \).

But how else can I relate \( \angle H \) and \( \angle J \)?

Perhaps, if I can find the measure of angle \( H \) in terms of \( \angle J \).

Let me think about triangle \( JHO \). In triangle \( JHO \), we have sides \( JO \) and \( JH \), and side \( HO \). But I know that \( JO \) is a radius, \( HO \) is a tangent, and \( JH \) is the line from center to external point.

Wait, in triangle \( JHO \), we can use trigonometry if we know the lengths of some sides or angles.

But maybe I need to find the measure of angle \( H \) in triangle \( HON \). Since triangle \( HON \) is isosceles with sides \( HO = HN \), and angles \( \angle HON = \angle HNO = \beta \), then the apex angle at \( H \) is \( 180^\circ - 2\beta \).

But how does this relate to the larger figure?

Wait, perhaps I can consider the triangle \( JHO \). In triangle \( JHO \), we have side \( JO \), side \( JH \), and side \( HO \). But I don't know the lengths, so maybe I can use some trigonometric relationships.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the triangle \( HJN \). Wait, but points \( O \) and \( N \) are points of tangency, so maybe I can relate the angles at \( J \) to the angles at \( O \) and \( N \).

Wait, perhaps I can think about the angle between \( HJ \) and \( JO \). Since \( HO \) is tangent to the circle at \( O \), and \( J \) is the center, so \( JO \) is the radius. The radius is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of contact, so \( \angle HOJ = 90^\circ \).

Similarly, \( \angle HN J = 90^\circ \).

Therefore, in triangle \( JOH \), we have a right triangle at \( O \). So, triangle \( JOH \) is right-angled at \( O \), with sides \( JO \), \( HO \), and \( JH \).

So, in triangle \( JOH \), \( \angle HOJ = 90^\circ \), \( \angle JOH \) is the angle at \( J \), which is angle \( J \) in the problem. \( \angle OHJ \) is the angle at \( H \), which is part of the angle \( H \) in the problem.

Wait, in triangle \( JOH \), the sum of angles is 180 degrees:

\( 90^\circ + \angle JOH + \angle OHJ = 180^\circ \)

So,

\( \angle JOH + \angle OHJ = 90^\circ \)

But \( \angle JOH \) is equal to angle \( J \) in triangle \( JON \), which is the same as angle \( J \) in the problem. Wait, no, in triangle \( JOH \), angle \( J \) is the same as angle \( J \) in the problem because both are angles at point \( J \). So, \( \angle JOH = \angle J \).

Therefore, in triangle \( JOH \):

\( \angle JOH + \angle OHJ = 90^\circ \)

So,

\( \angle J + \angle OHJ = 90^\circ \)

Therefore,

\( \angle OHJ = 90^\circ - \angle J \)

But \( \angle OHJ \) is part of angle \( H \) in the problem. So, angle \( H \) is equal to \( \angle OHJ \) because point \( O \) is on the same line as \( H \). Wait, actually, \( H \) is a single point, so angle \( H \) is the angle between lines \( HO \) and \( HN \). But perhaps, since \( HO \) and \( HN \) are both tangents, and point \( O \) and \( N \) are points on the circle.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the angle at \( H \) in terms of the angles in triangle \( JOH \).

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider triangle \( JHN \). But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can think about the properties of the circle and tangents. Since \( HO \) and \( HN \) are tangents, and \( J \) is the center, the line \( JH \) is the line from the center to the external point \( H \). In circle geometry, the angle between a tangent and a secant is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc. But in this case, \( JH \) is not a secant, it's a line from the center to the external point.

Wait, actually, another theorem: The angle between a tangent and a line from the external point to the center is equal to the angle subtended by the chord at the center. Wait, is that a thing?

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider triangle \( JOH \) and triangle \( JHN \). Since \( HO \) and \( HN \) are both tangents, perhaps they are congruent, and triangles \( JOH \) and \( JHN \) are congruent.

Wait, let's see. \( HO \) and \( HN \) are both tangents from \( H \) to circle \( J \), so they are congruent. Also, \( JO \) and \( JN \) are radii, so they are congruent. Therefore, triangles \( JOH \) and \( JHN \) are congruent by SSS (side-side-side) because \( JO = JN \), \( HO = HN \), and \( JH \) is common to both triangles.

Therefore, triangles \( JOH \) and \( JHN \) are congruent. Therefore, angles \( \angle JOH \) and \( \angle JHN \) are equal.

Wait, but earlier, I had that \( \angle JOH = \angle J \), so \( \angle JHN = \angle J \).

But in triangle \( JHN \), the sum of angles is 180 degrees:

\( \angle JHN + \angle HN J + \angle HJN = 180^\circ \)

But \( \angle JHN = \angle J \), \( \angle HN J = 90^\circ \), and \( \angle HJN \) is part of angle \( H \) in the problem.

Wait, but \( \angle HJN \) is equal to \( \angle OHJ \), which we found earlier was \( 90^\circ - \angle J \).

So, in triangle \( JHN \):

\( \angle J + 90^\circ + (90^\circ - \angle J) = 180^\circ \)

Simplify:

\( \angle J + 90^\circ + 90^\circ - \angle J = 180^\circ \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 180^\circ = 180^\circ \)

Hmm, that doesn't give me any new information. It's just confirming the triangle sum.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me think again about quadrilateral \( HOJN \). It's a kite with two right angles at \( O \) and \( N \), and it's inscribed in a circle? Wait, no, quadrilateral \( HOJN \) is not necessarily cyclic because \( H \) is an external point. So, it's not a cyclic quadrilateral.

Wait, but in this case, it's a kite with two right angles. So, perhaps I can use properties of kites.

In a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular, which we already established. So, \( HJ \perp ON \).

Therefore, the diagonals \( HJ \) and \( ON \) intersect at 90 degrees.

If I denote the point of intersection as \( M \), then \( HJ \) and \( ON \) intersect at \( M \) at 90 degrees.

But I don't know where \( M \) is, so maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the measure of angle \( H \) in terms of the central angle.

Wait, let me recall that the angle between two tangents from an external point is equal to the difference between 180 degrees and the measure of the central angle subtended by the points of tangency.

So, formula-wise, \( \angle H = 180^\circ - 2 \times \angle J \).

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify.

Yes, I think that's correct. Because the angle between two tangents is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. But in this case, since both tangents are from the same external point, the angle between them is equal to the difference between 180 degrees and the central angle.

Wait, actually, when you have two tangents from an external point, the angle between them is equal to the difference between 180 degrees and the central angle.

Wait, let's think about it. The two tangents make two arcs on the circle: the minor arc and the major arc. The angle between the tangents is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

But in this case, since the circle is only intersected by the two tangents at points \( O \) and \( N \), the two arcs are the minor arc \( ON \) and the major arc \( ON \). The measure of the angle between the tangents is half the difference between the measures of the intercepted arcs.

So, \( \angle H = \frac{1}{2} (\text{measure of major arc } ON - \text{measure of minor arc } ON) \).

But in a circle, the sum of the measures of major arc \( ON \) and minor arc \( ON \) is 360 degrees. So, if I denote the measure of minor arc \( ON \) as \( \alpha \), then the major arc \( ON \) is \( 360^\circ - \alpha \).

Therefore, the angle \( H \) is:

\( \angle H = \frac{1}{2} \left( (360^\circ - \alpha) - \alpha \right) = \frac{1}{2} (360^\circ - 2\alpha ) = 180^\circ - \alpha \)

But \( \alpha \) is the measure of minor arc \( ON \), which is equal to \( 2 \times \angle J \). Because in a circle, the central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

Therefore, \( \alpha = 2 \times \angle J \).

Substituting back:

\( \angle H = 180^\circ - (2 \times \angle J) \)

So, \( \angle H = 180^\circ - 2 \times \angle J \).

But from the quadrilateral \( HOJN \), we had that \( \angle H + \angle J = 180^\circ \).

So,

\( \angle H + \angle J = 180^\circ \)

But according to the tangent-angle relationship, \( \angle H = 180^\circ - 2 \times \angle J \)

Therefore,

\( 180^\circ - 2 \times \angle J + \angle J = 180^\circ \)

Simplify:

\( 180^\circ - \angle J = 180^\circ \)

Therefore,

\( - \angle J = 0 \)

Which implies \( \angle J = 0^\circ \)

Wait, that can't be right because angle \( J \) is an angle of a circle, so it can't be zero. I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me go back.

So, I said that \( \angle H = 180^\circ - 2 \times \angle J \).

But actually, the formula is \( \angle H = \frac{1}{2} (\text{measure of major arc } ON - \text{measure of minor arc } ON) \).

But if the minor arc \( ON \) is \( \alpha \), then major arc \( ON \) is \( 360^\circ - \alpha \). So,

\( \angle H = \frac{1}{2} ((360^\circ - \alpha) - \alpha ) = \frac{1}{2} (360^\circ - 2\alpha ) = 180^\circ - \alpha \)

But \( \alpha = 2 \times \angle J \), so substituting:

\( \angle H = 180^\circ - 2 \times \angle J \)

But from the quadrilateral, we had:

\( \angle H + \angle J = 180^\circ \)

So, substituting \( \angle H = 180^\circ - 2 \times \angle J \) into this:

\( (180^\circ - 2 \times \angle J) + \angle J = 180^\circ \)

Simplify:

\( 180^\circ - \angle J = 180^\circ \)

Which gives \( - \angle J = 0 \), so \( \angle J = 0^\circ \). Hmm, that can't be.

Wait, so maybe my formula is incorrect.

I think I might have confused the angle between the tangents with the central angle. Let me double-check.

I found a source that says: The measure of an angle formed by two tangents to a circle is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

So, \( \angle H = \frac{1}{2} (\text{measure of major arc } ON - \text{measure of minor arc } ON ) \)

But in this case, the intercepted arcs are the major arc \( ON \) and the minor arc \( ON \). Therefore, if \( \alpha \) is the measure of minor arc \( ON \), then major arc \( ON \) is \( 360^\circ - \alpha \).

So, \( \angle H = \frac{1}{2} ( (360^\circ - \alpha ) - \alpha ) = \frac{1}{2} (360^\circ - 2\alpha ) = 180^\circ - \alpha \)

But \( \alpha \) is the central angle \( \angle J \), so \( \angle H = 180^\circ - \angle J \)

So, from the quadrilateral \( HOJN \), we have:

\( \angle H + \angle J = 180^\circ \)

But if \( \angle H = 180^\circ - \angle J \), then substituting:

\( (180^\circ - \angle J ) + \angle J = 180^\circ \)

Which reduces to \( 180^\circ = 180^\circ \). So, it doesn't give any new information. It's an identity.

Wait, so maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps consider triangle \( HJN \).

We have triangle \( JHN \), with sides \( JH \), \( JN \), and \( HN \). Wait, but \( JN = JO \), and \( JH \) is the distance from center \( J \) to external point \( H \). So, triangle \( JHN \) is congruent to triangle \( JOH \) as we thought earlier.

So, in triangle \( JHN \), we have \( \angle JHN = \angle J \), \( \angle HN J = 90^\circ \), and \( \angle HJN = 90^\circ - \angle J \). Therefore, the sum is \( \angle J + 90^\circ + (90^\circ - \angle J ) = 180^\circ \), which is correct.

But again, that doesn't help us find \( \angle H \).

Wait, let's think about the angle between \( HJ \) and \( JH \). Wait, no, \( HJ \) is the line from center to external point, and \( JH \) is just the same line.

Wait, perhaps I need to use coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the points to compute angles.

Let me place point \( J \) at the origin (0,0). Let me assume that circle \( J \) has radius \( r \). Without loss of generality, let me set \( r = 1 \) for simplicity.

Let me place point \( H \) somewhere. Since the tangents from \( H \) touch the circle at \( O \) and \( N \), which are points on the circle. Let me assume that \( O \) is at (1,0), so point \( O \) is at (1,0). Then, point \( N \) is somewhere else on the circle.

Since \( HO \) is tangent at \( O \), and \( HJ \) is the line from the center to \( H \), which is at some point (x,y). Since \( HO \) is tangent at \( O \), the line \( HO \) is perpendicular to \( JO \). Since \( JO \) is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (1,0), then the tangent at \( O \) is vertical. Therefore, the tangent line \( HO \) is vertical, so \( H \) must be somewhere along the vertical line passing through \( O \).

Wait, but if \( HO \) is tangent at \( O \), and \( JO \) is horizontal, then the tangent is vertical. Therefore, point \( H \) lies somewhere along the vertical line x = 1.

But wait, if \( HO \) is vertical, then \( H \) must be at (1, k) for some k.

Similarly, the other tangent \( HN \) is tangent at \( N \). Since the circle is symmetric, if \( O \) is at (1,0), then \( N \) could be at (-1,0), but that's the other end of the diameter. But if \( H \) is at (1,k), then the tangent at \( N \) would have to be perpendicular to \( JN \). Let me see.

Wait, if \( H \) is at (1,k), then the tangent line \( HN \) at \( N \) must satisfy that the radius \( JN \) is perpendicular to \( HN \). So, if \( N \) is at (cos θ, sin θ), then \( JN \) has a slope of \( \tan \theta \), so the tangent at \( N \) must have a slope of \( - \cot \theta \). But since \( HN \) is the tangent line, and \( H \) is at (1,k), the slope of \( HN \) is \( (sin θ - k)/(cos θ - 1) \).

But this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to consider specific coordinates.

Let me assume \( O \) is at (1,0). Then, since \( HO \) is tangent at \( O \), \( H \) must lie somewhere along the vertical line x = 1.

Let me denote \( H \) as (1, h), where h is some positive value.

Then, the tangent line \( HO \) is the vertical line x = 1, so its slope is undefined. The tangent line at \( N \) is the other tangent from \( H \), which must have a slope.

Since \( N \) is a point on the circle, let's denote it as (cos θ, sin θ).

The slope of \( JN \) is \( (sin θ - 0)/(cos θ - 0) = tan θ \). Therefore, the slope of tangent \( HN \) is \( -cot θ \), because it's perpendicular.

So, the equation of tangent \( HN \) is:

\( y - k = m (x - k) \)

Wait, no, it's better to write the equation using point-slope form.

Since \( H \) is at (1, h), and the slope of \( HN \) is \( -cot θ \), the equation of line \( HN \) is:

\( y - h = -cot θ (x - 1) \)

But this line must be tangent to the circle at point \( N \), which is (cos θ, sin θ). Therefore, substituting \( N \) into the equation of line \( HN \):

\( sin θ - h = -cot θ (cos θ - 1) \)

Simplify:

\( sin θ - h = -cot θ (cos θ - 1) \)

But \( cot θ = \frac{cos θ}{sin θ} \), so:

\( sin θ - h = - \frac{cos θ}{sin θ} (cos θ - 1) \)

Multiply both sides by \( sin θ \):

\( sin^2 θ - h sin θ = -cos θ (cos θ - 1) \)

Simplify the right-hand side:

\( -cos^2 θ + cos θ \)

Therefore, the equation becomes:

\( sin^2 θ - h sin θ = -cos^2 θ + cos θ \)

Bring all terms to the left side:

\( sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ - h sin θ - cos θ = 0 \)

But \( sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ = 1 \), so:

\( 1 - h sin θ - cos θ = 0 \)

Therefore,

\( 1 = h sin θ + cos θ \)

So,

\( h sin θ + cos θ = 1 \)

This is the equation we have.

Additionally, since \( HN \) is tangent to the circle at \( N \), the distance from \( H \) to \( N \) must be equal to the length of the tangent from \( H \) to the circle, which is \( \sqrt{ (1 - cos θ)^2 + (h - sin θ)^2 } \).

But we also know that the length of the tangent from \( H \) to the circle is \( \sqrt{ (distance \ from \ H \ to \ J )^2 - r^2 } \). Since \( J \) is at (0,0), and \( H \) is at (1,h), so \( JH = \sqrt{1 + h^2} \). Since the radius \( r = 1 \), the length of the tangent is \( \sqrt{1 + h^2 - 1} = \sqrt{h^2} = |h| \).

Therefore, the length of the tangent \( HN \) is \( |h| \). So,

\( \sqrt{ (1 - cos θ)^2 + (h - sin θ)^2 } = |h| \)

Square both sides:

\( (1 - cos θ)^2 + (h - sin θ)^2 = h^2 \)

Expand:

\( 1 - 2 cos θ + cos^2 θ + h^2 - 2 h sin θ + sin^2 θ = h^2 \)

Simplify:

\( 1 - 2 cos θ + (cos^2 θ + sin^2 θ) + h^2 - 2 h sin θ = h^2 \)

Since \( cos^2 θ + sin^2 θ = 1 \):

\( 1 - 2 cos θ + 1 + h^2 - 2 h sin θ = h^2 \)

Combine like terms:

\( 2 - 2 cos θ - 2 h sin θ = 0 \)

Divide both sides by 2:

\( 1 - cos θ - h sin θ = 0 \)

But from earlier, we had:

\( 1 = h sin θ + cos θ \)

Which is the same as \( 1 - h sin θ - cos θ = 0 \). So, this is consistent.

Therefore, we have the equation \( 1 = h sin θ + cos θ \), which is the same as \( h sin θ = 1 - cos θ \). Therefore, \( h = \frac{1 - cos θ}{sin θ} \)

Simplify \( h \):

\( h = \frac{1 - cos θ}{sin θ} = \frac{2 sin^2 (θ/2)}{2 sin (θ/2) cos (θ/2)} = \frac{sin (θ/2)}{cos (θ/2)} = tan (θ/2) \)

So, \( h = tan (θ/2) \)

Therefore, point \( H \) is at (1, tan(θ/2)).

Now, let me see if I can find angle \( H \).

Point \( H \) is at (1, h) where \( h = tan (θ/2) \).

Point \( O \) is at (1,0), point \( N \) is at (cos θ, sin θ).

Therefore, angle \( H \) is the angle between lines \( HO \) and \( HN \). Since \( HO \) is vertical, the angle \( H \) is the angle between the vertical line and line \( HN \).

So, to find angle \( H \), we can compute the angle between the vertical line (slope infinite) and line \( HN \).

The slope of line \( HN \) is \( -cot θ \), as we found earlier.

The angle between a vertical line and another line with slope \( m \) is \( 90^\circ - \arctan |m| \). But since we're dealing with angles between lines, the angle between a vertical line and another line is equal to the complement of the angle that the other line makes with the x-axis.

Wait, more precisely, the angle between a vertical line (90 degrees from the x-axis) and another line with slope \( m \) is \( |90^\circ - \arctan m| \).

But since \( m = -cot θ \), which is \( - \frac{cos θ}{sin θ} \). So, \( \arctan m = \arctan (-cot θ ) = - \arctan (cot θ ) \).

But \( \arctan (cot θ ) = \arctan (tan (90^\circ - θ )) = 90^\circ - θ \).

Therefore, \( \arctan m = - (90^\circ - θ ) = θ - 90^\circ \).

So, the angle between the vertical line and line \( HN \) is:

\( |90^\circ - (θ - 90^\circ)| = |90^\circ - θ + 90^\circ| = |180^\circ - θ| \)

But since \( θ \) is an angle between 0 and 180 degrees, because it's a point on the unit circle.

Therefore, angle \( H \) is \( 180^\circ - θ \).

But from earlier, we have \( h = tan (θ/2) \). So, \( h = tan (θ/2) \). Therefore, \( θ = 2 \arctan h \).

Therefore, angle \( H = 180^\circ - θ = 180^\circ - 2 \arctan h \).

But in triangle \( JHN \), which is congruent to triangle \( JOH \), we have angles:

- \( \angle JHN = 90^\circ - \angle J \)
- \( \angle HN J = 90^\circ \)
- \( \angle HJN = 90^\circ - \angle J \)

So, angle \( H = 180^\circ - 2 \times \angle J \), as before.

But we also have angle \( H = 180^\circ - θ \), and \( θ = 2 \arctan h \). So,

\( 180^\circ - θ = 180^\circ - 2 \arctan h \)

Therefore,

\( 180^\circ - 2 \arctan h = 180^\circ - 2 \angle J \)

Thus,

\( 2 \arctan h = 2 \angle J \)

Therefore,

\( \arctan h = \angle J \)

So, \( \angle J = \arctan h \)

Alternatively, \( h = \tan \angle J \)

But earlier, we had \( h = tan (θ/2) \), so \( \tan \angle J = tan (θ/2 ) \), which implies \( \angle J = θ/2 \)

Therefore,

\( \angle J = θ / 2 \)

But from the previous equation, \( h = tan (θ/2 ) \). So, it all checks out.

But how does this help us? Maybe I need another equation.

Wait, let's go back to triangle \( JHN \). It's a triangle with sides \( JH \), \( JN \), and \( HN \). Since \( JN = JH \) (they are both radii of the circle), triangle \( JHN \) is isoceles.

In triangle \( JHN \), angles at \( J \) and \( N \) are equal. Wait, no, sides \( JH = JN \), so the angles opposite them are equal. Therefore, angles at \( H \) and \( N \) are equal.

But earlier, in triangle \( JHN \), angle at \( H \) is \( 180^\circ - 2 \times \angle J \), and angles at \( J \) and \( N \) are equal.

Therefore, in triangle \( JHN \):

\( \angle H = 180^\circ - 2 \angle J \)

\( \angle J = \angle N \)

And since the sum is 180:

\( (180^\circ - 2 \angle J ) + \angle J + \angle J = 180^\circ \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 180^\circ - 2 \angle J + 2 \angle J = 180^\circ \)

So, again, 180 = 180. So, no new information.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute angle \( H \) using coordinates.

Point \( H \) is at (1, h), point \( O \) is at (1,0), point \( N \) is at (cos θ, sin θ).

So, the angle at \( H \) is the angle between lines \( HO \) and \( HN \).

Since \( HO \) is vertical, the angle between \( HO \) and \( HN \) is the angle between the vertical line and line \( HN \).

As we found earlier, this angle is \( 180^\circ - θ \).

But we also have that angle \( H = 180^\circ - 2 \angle J \).

Therefore,

\( 180^\circ - 2 \angle J = 180^\circ - θ \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2 \angle J = θ \)

Therefore,

\( \angle J = \frac{θ}{2} \)

Which is consistent with our earlier result.

Wait, but how does that help? We need another equation.

Wait, perhaps in triangle \( JHN \), since it's isoceles, with sides \( JH = JN \), the base angles are equal.

So, angles at \( H \) and \( N \) are equal, each being \( \phi \). Therefore,

\( \phi = \angle H = \angle N = 180^\circ - 2 \angle J \)

But we also know that in triangle \( JHN \), the sum of angles is 180:

\( \angle J + 2 \phi = 180^\circ \)

But \( \phi = 180^\circ - 2 \angle J \), so:

\( \angle J + 2(180^\circ - 2 \angle J ) = 180^\circ \)

Simplify:

\( \angle J + 360^\circ - 4 \angle J = 180^\circ \)

Which is:

\( -3 \angle J + 360^\circ = 180^\circ \)

So,

\( -3 \angle J = -180^\circ \)

Thus,

\( \angle J = 60^\circ \)

Ah! There we go. So, angle \( J \) is 60 degrees. Then, angle \( H \) is \( 180^\circ - θ \).

But we also have that \( h = \tan (θ/2 ) \), and \( h = \tan (angle J ) = \tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3} \).

Therefore,

\( h = \sqrt{3} \)

So, point \( H \) is at (1, \( \sqrt{3} \)).

Then, to find \( θ \), since \( h = tan (θ/2 ) \), and \( h = \sqrt{3} \), we have:

\( \sqrt{3} = tan (θ/2 ) \)

Therefore,

\( θ/2 = 60^\circ \)

Thus,

\( θ = 120^\circ \)

Therefore, point \( N \) is at (cos 120°, sin 120°) = (-1/2, \( \sqrt{3}/2 \)).

So, coordinates:

- \( J \) at (0,0)
- \( H \) at (1, \( \sqrt{3} \))
- \( O \) at (1,0)
- \( N \) at (-1/2, \( \sqrt{3}/2 \))

Now, we can compute angle \( H \). Since angle \( H \) is the angle at point \( H \), which is (1, \( \sqrt{3} \)).

To compute angle \( H \), we can compute the angle between vectors \( HO \) and \( HN \).

First, vector \( HO \) is from \( H \) to \( O \): \( (1 - 1, 0 - \sqrt{3}) = (0, -\sqrt{3}) \)

Vector \( HN \) is from \( H \) to \( N \): \( (-1/2 - 1, \sqrt{3}/2 - \sqrt{3}) = (-3/2, -\sqrt{3}/2 ) \)

So, vectors:

- \( \vec{HO} = (0, -\sqrt{3}) \)
- \( \vec{HN} = (-3/2, -\sqrt{3}/2 ) \)

To find the angle between these two vectors, we can use the dot product formula:

\( \cos \phi = \frac{ \vec{HO} \cdot \vec{HN} }{ | \vec{HO} | | \vec{HN} | } \)

Compute the dot product:

\( \vec{HO} \cdot \vec{HN} = (0)(-3/2) + (-\sqrt{3})(- \sqrt{3}/2 ) = 0 + (3/2 ) = 3/2 \)

Compute the magnitudes:

\( | \vec{HO} | = \sqrt{0^2 + (-\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{3} \)

\( | \vec{HN} | = \sqrt{ (-3/2)^2 + (-\sqrt{3}/2 )^2 } = \sqrt{ 9/4 + 3/4 } = \sqrt{12/4} = \sqrt{3} \)

Therefore,

\( \cos \phi = \frac{ 3/2 }{ \sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3} } = \frac{ 3/2 }{ 3 } = \frac{1}{2} \)

Thus, \( \phi = \arccos ( 1/2 ) = 60^\circ \)

Therefore, angle \( H = 60^\circ \)

Therefore, angle \( J = 60^\circ \), angle \( H = 60^\circ \). So, their sum is \( 60^\circ + 60^\circ = 120^\circ \).

Wait, but earlier, we thought angle \( J = 60^\circ \) and angle \( H = 180^\circ - 2 \times 60^\circ = 60^\circ \). So, that makes sense.

But wait, let me verify once more.

If angle \( J = 60^\circ \), then the central angle \( ON = 60^\circ \), so the arc \( ON \) is 60 degrees.

Then, angle \( H \) is 60 degrees.

Therefore, the sum of angles \( J \) and \( H \) is 120 degrees.

Wait, but I thought earlier that angle \( H \) was 180 - 2 angle \( J \), which would be 60. But according to the coordinates, angle \( H \) is 60 degrees, so 60 + 60 = 120.

Alternatively, in triangle \( JHN \), which is isoceles with sides \( JH = JN \), angles at \( H \) and \( N \) are 60 degrees each, so angle \( J \) is 60 degrees. So, that checks out.

Therefore, the answer is 120 degrees.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{120}
</think>

Given a circle \( J \) with center \( J \), and points \( O \) and \( N \) on the circle, we know that \( HO \) and \( HN \) are tangents to the circle at points \( O \) and \( N \) respectively. We need to find the sum of the measures of \( \angle J \) and \( \angle H \).

1. **Tangents and Right Angles**:
   - Since \( HO \) and \( HN \) are tangents from point \( H \), they are equal in length.
   - The radius \( JO \) is perpendicular to the tangent \( HO \) at \( O \), so \( \angle HOJ = 90^\circ \).
   - Similarly, the radius \( JN \) is perpendicular to the tangent \( HN \) at \( N \), so \( \angle HN J = 90^\circ \).

2. **Isosceles Triangle**:
   - Triangle \( JOH \) is isosceles with \( JO = JH \) (radii of the circle).
   - The angle at \( J \) in triangle \( JOH \) is \( \angle J \).

3. **Angle Relationships**:
   - The sum of angles in triangle \( JON \) is \( 180^\circ \). Since \( \angle JOH = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle HJN = 90^\circ \), the remaining angle \( \angle J \) is \( 180^\circ - 2 \times \angle J \).
   - However, we need to consider the angle between the tangents \( HJ \) and \( JH \).

4. **Using Coordinates and Vectors**:
   - Placing the circle at the origin, we find the coordinates of points \( O \), \( N \), and \( H \).
   - Using vector analysis, we find the angle between vectors \( HO \) and \( HN \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Through detailed vector analysis and recognizing the properties of the circle and tangents, we find that the angle \( H \) is \( 60^\circ \).
   - The angle \( J \) is also \( 60^\circ \) because the central angle \( ON \) is \( 60^\circ \).

Thus, the sum of the measures of \( \angle J \) and \( \angle H \) is \( 60^\circ + 60^\circ = 120^\circ \).
