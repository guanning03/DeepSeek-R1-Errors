Question:
Find all solutions to
\[\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
Since $\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} x$ for all $x,$ we can write
\[\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} x \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]Let $\theta = \tan^{-1} x,$ so $x = \tan \theta.$  Also, $\sin 2 \theta = \frac{1}{3},$ so
\[2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \frac{1}{3}.\]Construct a right triangle with legs 1 and $x.$  Then the angle opposite the side length $x$ be $\theta.$

[/asy]

Also, the hypotenuse will be $\sqrt{x^2 + 1},$ so $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}$ and $\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}.$  Hence,
\[2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = \frac{1}{3},\]or
\[\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}.\]This gives us $x^2 + 1 = 6x,$ or $x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula, the roots are $x = \boxed{3 \pm 2 \sqrt{2}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this equation: \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). I need to find all the solutions for \(x\). Hmm, this looks a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) are inverse trigonometric functions. Maybe I can use some identities or substitutions to simplify this expression. Let me recall that \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) is the same as \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), right? So, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Yes, because if \(\theta = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), then \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{x}\), which means \(\tan(\theta) = x\), so \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). So, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). That means the original expression inside the sine function can be rewritten as:

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) = 2 \tan^{-1}(x)
\]

So the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Okay, that's simpler. Now, I need to find \(x\) such that \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\). Maybe I can use a double-angle identity for sine. Let me recall that:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta
\]

So, if I let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(2\theta = 2 \tan^{-1}(x)\), and the equation becomes:

\[
2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

But \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so I can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\). Let me draw a right triangle where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then, the opposite side is \(x\), and the adjacent side is 1. Therefore, the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\). So:

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}, \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}
\]

Substituting back into the equation:

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Simplify the left side:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

So:

\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let me solve for \(x\). Multiply both sides by \(1 + x^2\):

\[
2x = \frac{1}{3}(1 + x^2)
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
6x = 1 + x^2
\]

Bring all terms to one side:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]

Now, this is a quadratic equation. Let me use the quadratic formula to solve for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2}
\]

Simplify \(\sqrt{32}\):

\[
\sqrt{32} = \sqrt{16 \times 2} = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

So:

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]

So the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Wait, but I need to check if these solutions are valid because we're dealing with inverse trigonometric functions. Let me think about the domains and ranges.

First, \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is defined for all real numbers, so \(x\) can be any real number. But \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is defined when \(\frac{1}{x}\) is defined, so \(x \neq 0\). So \(x\) can't be zero. But our solutions \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) are both non-zero, so that's fine.

Also, the expression inside the sine function, \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\), must be within the range where sine is defined, which is all real numbers, so it's okay.

Wait, but let me double-check if there are any restrictions. Since \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) can take any real value, and we're doubling it, the argument inside sine is just fine.

Wait, but when I used the double-angle identity, I assumed that \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Let me make sure that \(\theta\) is within the principal value range of arctangent, which is \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). But since \(x\) is positive in both solutions, \(\theta\) will be between 0 and \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), which is within the principal value range. So, that seems fine.

Alternatively, I could also think about using another approach, perhaps using the identity for \(\sin(A + B)\). Let me try that.

Let me denote \(A = \tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(B = \cot^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\). Then, the original equation is \(\sin(A + B) = \frac{1}{3}\).

But earlier, I found that \(A = B\), so \(A + B = 2A\), so \(\sin(2A) = \frac{1}{3}\), which is the same as before. So, no difference there.

Alternatively, if I didn't notice that \(A = B\), I could have expanded \(\sin(A + B)\) using the sine addition formula:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]

So, substituting \(A = \tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(B = \cot^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\):

First, compute \(\sin A\), \(\cos A\), \(\sin B\), and \(\cos B\).

Earlier, I had:

\[
\sin A = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}, \quad \cos A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}
\]

Similarly, since \(B = \cot^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\), which is the same as \(\tan^{-1}(x)\), so \(B = A\). Therefore, \(\sin B = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\) and \(\cos B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\). So, substituting into the sine addition formula:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \right)\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \right)\left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1 + x^2}
\]

So, same result as before. So, it's consistent.

Therefore, solving \(\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}\) gives quadratic equation \(x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0\), with solutions \(x = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\).

Wait, but I should check if these solutions are valid in the original equation because sometimes, especially with inverse trigonometric functions, domain restrictions can come into play.

Let me check \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). Since \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is positive, \(\tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\) is defined and in the first quadrant. Similarly, \(\cot^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{3 + 2\sqrt{2}} \right)\) is also defined because \(\frac{1}{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}\) is positive, so the arccotangent is defined. So, this solution seems valid.

Now, \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Let's compute \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Since \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\), so \(2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828\). So, \(3 - 2.828 \approx 0.172\), which is positive. Therefore, \(\tan^{-1}(0.172)\) is defined, and \(\cot^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{0.172} \right)\) is also defined. So, this solution is valid too.

Therefore, both solutions are valid.

But just to be thorough, let me plug the solutions back into the original equation to verify.

First, let's take \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\).

Compute \(\tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\). Let's denote this angle as \(\alpha = \tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\). Then, \(\cot^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{3 + 2\sqrt{2}} \right) = \tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\) as we established earlier. So, the expression inside sine is \(2\alpha\). Therefore, \(\sin(2\alpha) = \frac{1}{3}\).

From the identity, \(\sin(2\alpha) = 2 \sin \alpha \cos \alpha\). We have:

\[
\sin \alpha = \frac{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{1 + (3 + 2\sqrt{2})^2}}
\]

Let me compute the denominator:

\[
1 + (3 + 2\sqrt{2})^2 = 1 + 9 + 12\sqrt{2} + 8 = 18 + 12\sqrt{2}
\]

So,

\[
\sin \alpha = \frac{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{18 + 12\sqrt{2}}}
\]

Similarly, \(\cos \alpha = \frac{1}{\sqrt{18 + 12\sqrt{2}}}\)

Then, \(\sin(2\alpha) = 2 \cdot \frac{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{18 + 12\sqrt{2}}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{18 + 12\sqrt{2}}}\)

Simplify:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}{18 + 12\sqrt{2}}
\]

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\)

Denominator: \(6(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\)

So,

\[
2 \cdot \frac{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}{6(3 + 2\sqrt{2})} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Which matches the right side, so \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is a valid solution.

Now, let's check \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

Similarly, let \(\alpha = \tan^{-1}(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\). Then, \(\cot^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{3 - 2\sqrt{2}} \right) = \tan^{-1}(3 - 2\sqrt{2}) = \alpha\). So, the expression inside the sine is \(2\alpha\).

Compute \(\sin(2\alpha)\):

\[
\sin(2\alpha) = 2 \sin \alpha \cos \alpha
\]

Compute \(\sin \alpha = \frac{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{1 + (3 - 2\sqrt{2})^2}}\)

Compute denominator:

\[
1 + (3 - 2\sqrt{2})^2 = 1 + 9 - 12\sqrt{2} + 8 = 18 - 12\sqrt{2}
\]

So,

\[
\sin \alpha = \frac{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{18 - 12\sqrt{2}}}
\]

Similarly, \(\cos \alpha = \frac{1}{\sqrt{18 - 12\sqrt{2}}}\)

Then,

\[
\sin(2\alpha) = 2 \cdot \frac{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{18 - 12\sqrt{2}}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{18 - 12\sqrt{2}}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}{18 - 12\sqrt{2}}
\]

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\)

Denominator: \(6(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\)

So,

\[
2 \cdot \frac{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}{6(3 - 2\sqrt{2})} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Which again matches the right side, so \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) is also a valid solution.

Therefore, both solutions are indeed valid.

Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. The key was recognizing that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is equal to \(\tan^{-1}(x)\), which simplifies the problem a lot. Then, using the double-angle identity for sine, I was able to form a quadratic equation and solve for \(x\). Both solutions check out when plugging back into the original equation.

I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the solutions are \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

**Final Answer**
The solutions are \(\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}, \boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}\).
</think>

First, we recognize that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the given equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Using the double-angle identity for sine, we let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta
\]

We know that \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\). Substituting these into the equation gives:

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(1 + x^2\):

\[
2x = \frac{1}{3}(1 + x^2)
\]

Multiplying both sides by 3:

\[
6x = 1 + x^2
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]

Both solutions \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) are valid as they satisfy the original equation and do not cause any domain issues.

Thus, the solutions are:

\[
\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}, \boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}
\]
