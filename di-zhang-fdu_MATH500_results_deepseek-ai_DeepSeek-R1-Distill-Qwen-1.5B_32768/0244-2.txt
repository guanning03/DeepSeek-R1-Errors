Question:
In the land of Ink, the money system is unique. One Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets, and 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. In Trinkets, what is the value of 56 Drinkets?

Correct Answer:
Multiply  \[
3\text{ Blinkets}=7\text{ Drinkets}
\] by 8 to find that 24 Blinkets are equivalent to 56 Drinkets.  Multiply  \[
1\text{ Trinkets}=4\text{ Blinkets}
\] by 6 to find that $\boxed{6}$ Trinkets are equivalent to 24 Blinkets (which in turn are equivalent to 56 Drinkets, as we just found).

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll establish the relationships between the different money units. One Trinket is equivalent to 4 Blinkets, and 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets.

Next, I'll convert Drinkets to Blinkets by dividing 7 Drinkets by 3, which gives me approximately 2.3333 Blinkets per Drinket.

Then, I'll multiply this value by the number of Drinkets, which is 56, to convert them directly into Blinkets. This calculation results in approximately 133.3333 Blinkets.

Finally, I'll convert Blinkets into Trinkets by dividing the total number of Blinkets by 4, leading to approximately 33.3333 Trinkets.
