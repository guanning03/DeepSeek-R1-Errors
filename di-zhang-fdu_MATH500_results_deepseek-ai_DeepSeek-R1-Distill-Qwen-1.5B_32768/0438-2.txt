Question:
If $re^{i \theta}$ is a root of
\[z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 = 0,\]where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi,$ then find the sum of all possible values of $\theta.$

Correct Answer:
The given equation can be written as
\[\frac{z^9 + 1}{z + 1} = 0.\]Then $z^9 + 1 = 0,$ or $z^9 = -1.$  Since $z = e^{i \theta},$
\[e^{9i \theta} = -1.\]This means $9 \theta = \pi + 2 \pi k$ for some integer $k.$  Since $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi,$ the possible values of $k$ are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.   (We omit $k = 4,$ because if $k = 4,$ then $\theta = \pi,$ so $z = -1,$ which makes $z + 1 = 0.$)  Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $\theta$ is
\[\frac{\pi}{9} + \frac{3 \pi}{9} + \frac{5 \pi}{9} + \frac{7 \pi}{9} + \frac{11 \pi}{9} + \frac{13 \pi}{9} + \frac{15 \pi}{9} + \frac{17 \pi}{9} = \boxed{8 \pi}.\]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of all possible values of θ for which re^(iθ) is a root of the given polynomial:

z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 = 0.

And they tell me that r > 0 and 0 ≤ θ < 2π. So, essentially, I need to find all the roots of this polynomial in polar form and then sum up all their arguments θ. 

First, let me write down the polynomial again to make sure I have it right:

z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1.

Hmm, that looks kind of symmetric. The coefficients are alternating, starting with z^8 and ending with 1. So, the coefficients are +1, -1, +1, -1, and so on, up to z^8. That seems like a pattern. Maybe I can factor this polynomial somehow?

I remember that for polynomials with alternating coefficients, sometimes they can be expressed as a geometric series or related to complex roots of unity. Let me think about that.

Wait, the polynomial is z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - ... + 1. If I factor out a z^8, it would be z^8(1 - (1/z) + (1/z^2) - ... + (1/z^8)). Hmm, that looks like a finite geometric series. Maybe I can write it as z^8 times the sum from k=0 to 8 of (-1)^k / z^k.

But actually, the entire expression is a geometric series with ratio -1/z. So, the sum would be (1 - (-1/z)^9)/(1 - (-1/z)).

Wait, let me check that. The sum from k=0 to n of ar^k is (1 - r^{n+1})/(1 - r). Here, a=1, r = -1/z, and n=8. So, the sum is (1 - (-1/z)^9)/(1 - (-1/z)).

Simplifying the numerator: 1 - (-1)^9 / z^9 = 1 + 1/z^9, since (-1)^9 is -1.

Denominator: 1 - (-1/z) = 1 + 1/z.

So, the entire expression is (1 + 1/z^9)/(1 + 1/z) = (1 + 1/z^9) * (z/z + 1) / z.

Wait, let me do that step by step. Multiply numerator and denominator by z^9 to eliminate denominators:

Numerator: (1 + 1/z^9) * z^9 = z^9 + 1.

Denominator: (1 + 1/z) * z^9 = z^9 + z^8.

So, the sum becomes (z^9 + 1)/(z^9 + z^8) = (z^9 + 1)/[z^8(z + 1)].

Therefore, the original polynomial can be written as z^8 times that sum, right? Wait, let me make sure.

Wait, the original polynomial is z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - ... +1, which we factored as z^8 times the sum from k=0 to 8 of (-1)^k / z^k. So, that's equal to (z^9 + 1)/(z^8(z + 1)).

So, the equation becomes:

(z^9 + 1)/(z^8(z + 1)) = 1.

Wait, no, actually, the original polynomial is equal to z^8 times the sum which equals z^8 * [(z^9 + 1)/(z^8(z + 1))] = (z^9 + 1)/(z + 1).

So, our original equation is z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - ... +1 = 0, which simplifies to (z^9 + 1)/(z + 1) = 0.

Therefore, (z^9 + 1) = 0, since z + 1 ≠ 0 (unless z = -1, but let's check that case separately). So, z^9 = -1.

Thus, the roots are the 9th roots of -1. So, z^9 = -1.

But -1 can be written in polar form as e^{iπ}, so the roots are e^{i(π + 2πk)/9} for k = 0, 1, ..., 8.

Therefore, the roots are e^{i(π/9 + 2πk/9)} for k=0 to 8.

Alternatively, we can write them as e^{i(2πk + π)/9} for k=0 to 8.

So, each root is at an angle of (2k + 1)π/9 radians.

Therefore, the roots are:

For k=0: π/9

k=1: 3π/9 = π/3

k=2: 5π/9

k=3: 7π/9

k=4: 9π/9 = π

k=5: 11π/9

k=6: 13π/9

k=7: 15π/9 = 5π/3

k=8: 17π/9

So, all the roots are at angles of π/9, π/3, 5π/9, 7π/9, π, 11π/9, 13π/9, 5π/3, 17π/9.

Wait, but hold on, let me make sure. Since k goes from 0 to 8, and each time we add 2π/9, starting from π/9.

Yes, that seems right.

So, the question is asking for the sum of all possible values of θ. So, we need to sum up all these angles: π/9, π/3, 5π/9, 7π/9, π, 11π/9, 13π/9, 5π/3, 17π/9.

Let me compute each of these and then add them up.

First, let's list them:

1. π/9 ≈ 20 degrees

2. π/3 ≈ 60 degrees

3. 5π/9 ≈ 100 degrees

4. 7π/9 ≈ 140 degrees

5. π ≈ 180 degrees

6. 11π/9 ≈ 220 degrees

7. 13π/9 ≈ 260 degrees

8. 5π/3 ≈ 300 degrees

9. 17π/9 ≈ 340 degrees

But since we're dealing with radians, better to keep them as fractions of π.

So, let's compute the sum:

Sum = π/9 + π/3 + 5π/9 + 7π/9 + π + 11π/9 + 13π/9 + 5π/3 + 17π/9.

First, let me convert all terms to ninths to make it easier:

π/9 = 1π/9

π/3 = 3π/9

5π/9 = 5π/9

7π/9 = 7π/9

π = 9π/9

11π/9 = 11π/9

13π/9 = 13π/9

5π/3 = 15π/9

17π/9 = 17π/9

So, now, let's list them as ninths:

1π/9, 3π/9, 5π/9, 7π/9, 9π/9, 11π/9, 13π/9, 15π/9, 17π/9.

Now, let's add the numerators:

1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17.

Let me compute this step by step:

1 + 3 = 4

4 + 5 = 9

9 + 7 = 16

16 + 9 = 25

25 + 11 = 36

36 + 13 = 49

49 + 15 = 64

64 + 17 = 81

So, the total numerator is 81, and denominator is 9.

Thus, Sum = 81π/9 = 9π.

Wait, so the sum of all θ is 9π.

Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.

Wait, but hold on, in the original polynomial, when we factored out, we assumed that z + 1 ≠ 0. So, we have to check if z = -1 is a root.

Let me test z = -1 in the original equation:

z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1.

Plugging in z = -1:

(-1)^8 - (-1)^7 + (-1)^6 - (-1)^5 + (-1)^4 - (-1)^3 + (-1)^2 - (-1) + 1.

Compute each term:

1 - (-1) + 1 - (-1) + 1 - (-1) + 1 - (-1) + 1.

Which simplifies to:

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9.

Which is not zero. So, z = -1 is not a root, so our earlier factoring is valid. Therefore, all the roots are the 9th roots of -1, which are equally spaced around the unit circle, at angles (2k + 1)π/9 for k from 0 to 8, as we found.

Therefore, the sum of all θ is 9π, as calculated above.

Wait, but 9π is almost 3 full circles, but since θ is between 0 and 2π, 9π is equivalent to π, because 9π = 4*2π + π. But wait, no, in the interval [0, 2π), 9π is more than 2π, right? 9π is 4 full circles plus π, but since θ is modulo 2π, π is the same as 13π in [0, 2π). Wait, but the sum is 9π, which is more than 2π.

Wait, but the question says θ is between 0 and 2π, so adding up all the θs, which are each in [0, 2π), but the sum might be more than 2π. So, 9π is the correct sum.

But let me just verify my calculation. The sum of all θs is 9π, which is a bit surprising because when I thought about the roots, they are symmetrically placed, so their angles add up to an integer multiple of π. So, 9π is 4.5 rotations, but since we're just adding angles, it's fine.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum in another way.

Wait, another approach: the polynomial is z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1.

I know that if I write this as (z^9 + 1)/(z + 1) = 0, which implies z^9 = -1, as I did before.

So, the roots are the 9th roots of -1, which are e^{i(π + 2πk)/9}, k=0,1,...,8.

Therefore, each root has angle (π + 2πk)/9, which is π/9 + 2πk/9.

So, the angles are: π/9, 3π/9, 5π/9, 7π/9, 9π/9, 11π/9, 13π/9, 15π/9, 17π/9.

So, in terms of θ, these are θ values from k=0 to 8: π/9, π/3, 5π/9, 7π/9, π, 11π/9, 13π/9, 5π/3, 17π/9.

So, adding all these up, as we did, gives 81π/9 = 9π.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that the roots are symmetric about the real axis, so their angles come in pairs that add up to π. For example, π/9 and 17π/9 add up to (π/9 + 17π/9) = 18π/9 = 2π. Similarly, π/3 and 13π/9 add up to 14π/9, which is more than π. Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of pairing.

Wait, actually, the roots are symmetric with respect to the real axis.

So, each root at angle θ has a conjugate root at angle -θ. So, when you add θ and -θ, you get 0, but in our case, all the roots are not symmetric in that way because they are all at angles of (2k + 1)π/9, which are all in the upper half-plane? Wait, no, because we have both positive and negative angles.

Wait, actually, each root is at angle (2k + 1)π/9, which for k from 0 to 4 gives angles between π/9 and 9π/9 (π), and for k from 5 to 8 gives angles from 11π/9 to 17π/9, which are in the lower half-plane.

But in any case, since the roots are symmetric about the real axis, their angles come in pairs that add up to π.

Wait, let me think: For each root at angle θ, its conjugate is at angle -θ. So, if θ is in the upper half-plane, -θ is in the lower half-plane. But in our case, the roots are at angles (2k + 1)π/9, which are all in the upper half-plane except for k=4, where θ=π.

So, actually, except for the root at θ=π, all other roots come in conjugate pairs.

Therefore, for each pair, their angles add up to π. For example, θ and π - θ.

Wait, let's see:

Take k=0: π/9 and k=8: 17π/9. π/9 + 17π/9 = 18π/9 = 2π. So, they add up to 2π.

Similarly, k=1: π/3 and k=7: 5π/3. π/3 + 5π/3 = 6π/3 = 2π.

k=2: 5π/9 and k=6: 13π/9. 5π/9 + 13π/9 = 18π/9 = 2π.

k=3: 7π/9 and k=5: 11π/9. 7π/9 + 11π/9 = 18π/9 = 2π.

And k=4: π and nothing else because k=4 is paired with k=4 itself.

Wait, no, actually, each pair is between k and 8 - k.

Wait, for k=0 and k=8, they are paired.

Similarly, k=1 and k=7, etc.

So, the sum of each pair is 2π, except for the middle term when k=4, which is π. So, the total sum is (4 pairs) * 2π + π = 4*2π + π = 8π + π = 9π.

Wait, that's the same result as before.

Therefore, the sum of all θ is 9π.

So, the answer is 9π.

But wait, the question says to put the answer inside a box, using \boxed{}, so I should write it as \boxed{9\pi}.

But just to make sure, let me consider the symmetry again. Since the polynomial is palindromic, it's reciprocal, meaning that if z is a root, then 1/z is also a root. But in our case, the roots are on the unit circle because z^9 = -1 implies |z| = 1.

So, the polynomial is reciprocal, so the roots come in pairs z and 1/z, which are conjugates since they lie on the unit circle.

Therefore, each pair z and 1/z, so their angles are θ and -θ.

So, when you add θ and -θ, you get 0.

But in our case, the roots are at angles π/9, π/3, 5π/9, 7π/9, π, 11π/9, 13π/9, 5π/3, 17π/9.

Wait, but 5π/3 is equal to π/3, but in terms of angle, it's 5π/3, which is equivalent to -π/3. Similarly, 7π/9 is just 7π/9.

But perhaps not. Wait, actually, 5π/3 is 2π - π/3, so it's equivalent to -π/3, but in terms of angle, it's 5π/3.

Wait, but in terms of adding up all angles, it's just 5π/3, not -π/3.

Wait, but in our earlier approach, when we add all the angles, including the ones above π, they sum up to 9π.

But perhaps I should think of the sum in terms of their positions around the circle.

Alternatively, maybe consider that the roots are the 9th roots of -1, so they are the same as the 9th roots of 1 multiplied by e^{iπ}, so they are e^{i(π + 2πk)/9} for k=0,...,8.

Therefore, each root is at an angle of π/9 + 2πk/9.

Thus, the sum of all angles θ is Sum_{k=0}^8 [π/9 + 2πk/9] = 9*(π/9) + (2π/9)*Sum_{k=0}^8 k = π + (2π/9)*(36) = π + 8π = 9π.

So, that's another way to compute it.

Therefore, I feel confident that the sum is 9π.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{9\pi}
</think>

Given the polynomial:

\[z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 = 0,\]

we need to find the sum of all possible values of \(\theta\) for which \(re^{i \theta}\) is a root, where \(r > 0\) and \(0 \le \theta < 2 \pi\).

First, we recognize the polynomial as a geometric series with alternating coefficients. We factor it as:

\[
z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 = 0.
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{z^9 + 1}{z + 1} = 0.
\]

The roots of this polynomial are the 9th roots of \(-1\), which are given by:

\[
z = e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/9} \quad \text{for} \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 8.
\]

These roots are:

\[
e^{i\pi/9}, e^{i3\pi/9}, e^{i5\pi/9}, e^{i7\pi/9}, e^{i9\pi/9}, e^{i11\pi/9}, e^{i13\pi/9}, e^{i15\pi/9}, e^{i17\pi/9}.
\]

The angles \(\theta\) are:

\[
\frac{\pi}{9}, \frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{5\pi}{9}, \frac{7\pi}{9}, \pi, \frac{11\pi}{9}, \frac{13\pi}{9}, \frac{5\pi}{3}, \frac{17\pi}{9}.
\]

Summing these angles:

\[
\frac{\pi}{9} + \frac{\pi}{3} + \frac{5\pi}{9} + \frac{7\pi}{9} + \pi + \frac{11\pi}{9} + \frac{13\pi}{9} + \frac{5\pi}{3} + \frac{17\pi}{9}.
\]

Converting all terms to ninths:

\[
\frac{1\pi}{9} + \frac{3\pi}{9} + \frac{5\pi}{9} + \frac{7\pi}{9} + \frac{9\pi}{9} + \frac{11\pi}{9} + \frac{13\pi}{9} + \frac{15\pi}{9} + \frac{17\pi}{9}.
\]

Adding the numerators:

\[
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 = 81.
\]

Thus, the sum is:

\[
\frac{81\pi}{9} = 9\pi.
\]

The sum of all possible values of \(\theta\) is:

\[
\boxed{9\pi}
\]
