Question:
The complex numbers $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$, and $\alpha_4$ are the four distinct roots of the equation $x^4+2x^3+2=0$. Determine the unordered set \[
\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}.
\]

Correct Answer:
Employing the elementary symmetric polynomials ($s_1 = \alpha_1+\alpha_2+\alpha_3+\alpha_4 = -2$, $s_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0$, $s_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\alpha_1 + \alpha_4\alpha_1\alpha_2 = 0$, and $s_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2$) we consider the polynomial \[
P(x) = (x-(\alpha_1\alpha_2+\alpha_3\alpha_4))(x-(\alpha_1\alpha_3+\alpha_2\alpha_4))(x-(\alpha_1\alpha_4+\alpha_2\alpha_3))
\]Because $P$ is symmetric with respect to $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4$, we can express the coefficients of its expanded form in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials.  We compute \begin{eqnarray*}
P(x) & = & x^3 - s_2x^2 + (s_3s_1-4s_4)x + (-s_3^2-s_4s_1^2+s_4s_2) \\
& = & x^3 - 8x - 8 \\
& = & (x+2)(x^2-2x-4)
\end{eqnarray*}The roots of $P(x)$ are $-2$ and $1 \pm \sqrt{5}$, so the answer is $\boxed{\{1\pm\sqrt{5},-2\}}.$

$\textbf{Remarks:}$ It is easy to find the coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ by expansion, and the constant term can be computed without the complete expansion and decomposition of $(\alpha_1\alpha_2+\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3+\alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4+\alpha_2\alpha_3)$ by noting that the only nonzero 6th degree expressions in $s_1, s_2, s_3,$ and $s_4$ are $s_1^6$ and $s_4s_1^2$. The general polynomial $P$ constructed here is called the cubic resolvent and arises in Galois theory.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out this problem where I have four distinct roots of a quartic equation, and I have to compute three specific expressions involving pairs of these roots and then determine the unordered set of those expressions. Let me write down the problem again to make sure I have it clear:

The complex numbers α₁, α₂, α₃, and α₄ are the four distinct roots of the equation x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0. I need to determine the unordered set {α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, α₁α₄ + α₂α₃}.

Alright, so first, I remember that for a quartic equation, the roots can be related through Vieta's formulas. Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Since this is a quartic, x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0, the coefficients will give me information about the sums and products of the roots.

Let me recall Vieta's formulas for a quartic equation: given a quartic equation x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d = 0, the sums and products of the roots can be expressed as:

- The sum of the roots α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -a.
- The sum of the products of the roots two at a time: α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = b.
- The sum of the products three at a time: α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = -c.
- The product of all four roots: α₁α₂α₃α₄ = d.

In our case, the equation is x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0. Comparing this with the general quartic equation, I can see that:

- a = 2
- b = 0 (since there is no x² term)
- c = 0 (since there is no x term)
- d = 2

So applying Vieta's formulas:

1. α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -a = -2
2. α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = b = 0
3. α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = -c = 0
4. α₁α₂α₃α₄ = d = 2

So now I have these relationships. The problem is asking for the unordered set {α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, α₁α₄ + α₂α₃}. Let me denote these expressions as S₁, S₂, and S₃ respectively.

So:

- S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄
- S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄
- S₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃

I need to find the values of S₁, S₂, and S₃ and then determine the unordered set {S₁, S₂, S₃}.

Hmm, I notice that these expressions S₁, S₂, S₃ are related to the second symmetric sum of the roots. Let me think about how to express these in terms of Vieta's formulas.

Since we have the sum of all products of two roots, which is 0, maybe I can find a way to express S₁, S₂, and S₃ in terms of that sum.

Let me denote P = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0.

So S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = P = 0. Therefore, if I can find another relation that connects these S's, I can solve for them.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the products of the roots taken three at a time. From Vieta's formula, we have α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0.

Let me denote this sum as Q = 0.

So Q = α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0.

I wonder if I can relate this to the S's. Let's see.

If I consider each S, for example, S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄.

Notice that S₁ is equal to (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄). Similarly, S₂ = (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄), and S₃ = (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃).

So, each S is a sum of two products of the roots. Perhaps if I can express S₁, S₂, S₃ in terms of the known sums from Vieta's formulas, I can find their values.

Let me try to express S₁ in terms of other expressions.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the product of two roots. For example, consider (α₁ + α₃)(α₂ + α₄). Let me compute this:

(α₁ + α₃)(α₂ + α₄) = α₁α₂ + α₁α₄ + α₃α₂ + α₃α₄ = S₁ + S₃.

Similarly, (α₁ + α₂)(α₃ + α₄) = S₂ + S₃.

And (α₁ + α₄)(α₂ + α₃) = S₁ + S₂.

Wait, but without knowing the individual sums, it's a bit tricky. Maybe I can relate these products to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2, so maybe pairing them differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the square of the sum of the roots:

(α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄)² = α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄² + 2(S₁ + S₂ + S₃).

We know that (α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄)² = (-2)² = 4.

So 4 = (α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄²) + 2*0, since S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0. Therefore, α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄² = 4.

Hmm, so that's another value. Maybe I can find the sum of squares.

But I don't see an immediate connection to S₁, S₂, S₃. Maybe I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the identity for the product of two sums. Let me think.

Wait, another idea: consider the expression (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)² + (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)² + (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃)².

I recall that for such expressions, there is an identity that says that the sum of squares is equal to the sum of the squares of the products.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)³ or something, but that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe I can consider the relation between S₁, S₂, S₃, and the other symmetric sums.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the expression of S₁ in terms of the roots.

Wait, here's another idea: if I can pair the roots into two pairs and consider the products of each pair, then S₁ is the sum of these two products.

So, suppose I pair α₁ with α₂ and α₃ with α₄, then S₁ is the sum of their products. Similarly for the other S's.

Since the roots are roots of the equation x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0, let me denote each root as a variable and find a relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use symmetric functions or some substitution.

Wait, maybe I can consider a substitution to reduce the quartic equation to a quadratic.

Let me see: since we have x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0, perhaps substituting y = x + k for some k might help.

Let me try to perform a substitution to make it a depressed quartic.

Let me set y = x + a, where a is a constant to be determined. Then x = y - a.

Substituting into the equation:

(y - a)⁴ + 2(y - a)³ + 2 = 0.

Expanding this might allow me to choose a such that the cubic term cancels out.

Let me compute each term:

First, (y - a)⁴: Let's expand it.

(y - a)⁴ = y⁴ - 4a y³ + 6a² y² - 4a³ y + a⁴.

Then, 2(y - a)³ = 2(y³ - 3a y² + 3a² y - a³) = 2y³ - 6a y² + 6a² y - 2a³.

Adding these together with the constant term 2:

(y⁴ - 4a y³ + 6a² y² - 4a³ y + a⁴) + (2y³ - 6a y² + 6a² y - 2a³) + 2 = 0.

Combine like terms:

y⁴ + (-4a + 2) y³ + (6a² - 6a) y² + (-4a³ + 6a²) y + (a⁴ - 2a³ + 2) = 0.

We want to choose a such that the coefficient of y³ is zero. So set:

-4a + 2 = 0 => -4a + 2 = 0 => a = 2/4 = 1/2.

So choosing a = 1/2, we can eliminate the y³ term.

Let me compute the coefficients with a = 1/2:

1. y⁴ term: 1
2. y³ term: 0
3. y² term: 6*(1/2)² - 6*(1/2) = 6*(1/4) - 3 = 3/2 - 3 = -3/2
4. y term: -4*(1/2)³ + 6*(1/2)² = -4*(1/8) + 6*(1/4) = -0.5 + 1.5 = 1
5. Constant term: (1/2)⁴ - 2*(1/2)³ + 2 = 1/16 - 2*(1/8) + 2 = 1/16 - 1/4 + 2 = (1 - 4 + 32)/16 = 29/16.

So after substitution, the equation becomes:

y⁴ - (3/2)y² + y + 29/16 = 0.

Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but perhaps we can make another substitution to eliminate the y term as well. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let me denote z = y² + b y + c, but that might not be helpful.

Wait, perhaps instead of substitution, I can use the fact that the quartic can be factored into quadratics.

Let me try to factor x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 as (x² + a x + b)(x² + c x + d).

Expanding this:

(x² + a x + b)(x² + c x + d) = x⁴ + (a + c)x³ + (ac + b + d)x² + (ad + bc)x + b d.

Set this equal to x⁴ + 2x³ + 0x² + 0x + 2.

So, by equating coefficients:

1. Coefficient of x⁴: 1 = 1, which is fine.
2. Coefficient of x³: a + c = 2
3. Coefficient of x²: a c + b + d = 0
4. Coefficient of x: a d + b c = 0
5. Constant term: b d = 2

So I have the system of equations:

1. a + c = 2
2. a c + b + d = 0
3. a d + b c = 0
4. b d = 2

I need to solve for a, b, c, d.

Let me consider that this is a system of equations. Maybe I can assume that b and d are rational numbers since the coefficients are integers. Let me try to find such b and d.

From equation 4: b d = 2. So possible integer pairs (b, d) are (1,2), (2,1), (-1,-2), (-2,-1).

Let me test these possibilities.

Case 1: b = 1, d = 2.

Then, equation 3: a*2 + 1*c = 0 => 2a + c = 0.

From equation 1: a + c = 2.

So, we have:

2a + c = 0

a + c = 2

Subtracting the second equation from the first: (2a + c) - (a + c) = 0 - 2 => a = -2.

Then, from a + c = 2: -2 + c = 2 => c = 4.

Now, check equation 2: a c + b + d = (-2)(4) + 1 + 2 = -8 + 1 + 2 = -5 ≠ 0.

So this case doesn't work.

Case 2: b = 2, d = 1.

Equation 3: a*1 + 2*c = 0 => a + 2c = 0.

Equation 1: a + c = 2.

So,

a + c = 2

a + 2c = 0

Subtracting the first equation from the second: (a + 2c) - (a + c) = 0 - 2 => c = -2.

Then, from equation 1: a + (-2) = 2 => a = 4.

Check equation 2: a c + b + d = 4*(-2) + 2 + 1 = -8 + 3 = -5 ≠ 0.

Again, doesn't work.

Case 3: b = -1, d = -2.

Equation 3: a*(-2) + (-1)*c = 0 => -2a - c = 0 => c = -2a.

Equation 1: a + c = 2 => a + (-2a) = 2 => -a = 2 => a = -2.

Then, c = -2*(-2) = 4.

Check equation 2: a c + b + d = (-2)(4) + (-1) + (-2) = -8 -1 -2 = -11 ≠ 0.

Not good.

Case 4: b = -2, d = -1.

Equation 3: a*(-1) + (-2)*c = 0 => -a -2c = 0 => a = -2c.

Equation 1: a + c = 2 => (-2c) + c = 2 => -c = 2 => c = -2.

Then, a = -2*(-2) = 4.

Check equation 2: a c + b + d = 4*(-2) + (-2) + (-1) = -8 -2 -1 = -11 ≠ 0.

Hmm, none of these cases worked. Maybe the quartic doesn't factor into quadratics with integer coefficients. Perhaps I need to consider that it factors into quadratics with non-integer coefficients or maybe with complex coefficients. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that it's a biquadratic equation but it's not because of the constant term.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can let z = x + 1/2, as I did earlier, but ended up with a messy equation. Maybe I can try another substitution or use the original equation to relate S₁, S₂, S₃.

Wait, another idea: consider that S₁, S₂, S₃ are the sums of products of roots two at a time, but in specific groupings. Let me think about the sum S₁ + S₂ + S₃, which we know is zero, as per Vieta.

But perhaps I can compute S₁² + S₂² + S₃² and relate that to other symmetric sums.

Let me compute S₁² + S₂² + S₃².

S₁² = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)² = α₁²α₂² + α₃²α₄² + 2α₁α₂α₃α₄.

Similarly for S₂² and S₃².

So S₁² + S₂² + S₃² = (α₁²α₂² + α₃²α₄² + 2α₁α₂α₃α₄) + (α₁²α₃² + α₂²α₄² + 2α₁α₂α₃α₄) + (α₁²α₄² + α₂²α₃² + 2α₁α₂α₃α₄).

So grouping terms:

= [α₁²α₂² + α₁²α₃² + α₁²α₄² + α₂²α₃² + α₂²α₄² + α₃²α₄²] + 6α₁α₂α₃α₄.

Now, note that α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄ are roots of x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0. So, each α_i satisfies α_i⁴ + 2α_i³ + 2 = 0, which implies α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2.

Therefore, α_i² * α_j² can be expressed as (α_i * α_j)^2, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps express α₁²α₂² in terms of lower powers.

Wait, since each root satisfies α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2, so α_i² * α_i² = α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2. So, α_i² * α_j² = α_i² * α_j². Hmm, but unless there's some relation between the roots, I don't see an immediate way to express this.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute each term:

We have:

S₁² + S₂² + S₃² = [α₁²α₂² + α₁²α₃² + α₁²α₄² + α₂²α₃² + α₂²α₄² + α₃²α₄²] + 6α₁α₂α₃α₄.

So, first, let's compute the sum of α_i²α_j² for i < j.

Let me denote P = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0.

So, P = 0.

Then, the sum of α_i²α_j² can be expressed in terms of P and the squares of the products.

Wait, recall that (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄)² = α₁²α₂² + α₁²α₃² + α₁²α₄² + α₂²α₃² + α₂²α₄² + α₃²α₄² + 2(α₁α₂α₁α₃ + α₁α₂α₁α₄ + α₁α₂α₂α₃ + ...).

So, (P)^2 = sum_{i < j} α_i²α_j² + 2 sum_{i < j < k < l} α_iα_jα_kα_l.

Given that P = 0, so 0 = sum_{i < j} α_i²α_j² + 2 sum_{i < j < k < l} α_iα_jα_kα_l.

Therefore, sum_{i < j} α_i²α_j² = -2 sum_{i < j < k < l} α_iα_jα_kα_l.

But from Vieta's formula, the product of all four roots is α₁α₂α₃α₄ = d = 2. So, what about sum_{i < j < k < l} α_iα_jα_kα_l?

In four variables, the sum over all quadruples is the same as the sum over all products of three variables, but in our case, we have α₁α₂α₃α₄, which is just the product of all four.

Wait, actually, in four variables, the sum over all products of three variables is equal to the sum of the products of three roots, which is equal to (sum_{i=1}^4 α_i)(sum_{i=1}^4 α_i - α_i) - (sum α_i)^2.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute it directly.

Wait, for four variables, the sum over all products of three is equal to:

(α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄)(α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄) - 3α₁α₂α₃α₄.

From Vieta, we have:

(α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄)(sum α_iα_j) - 3α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 0 * 0 - 3*2 = -6.

So, sum_{i < j < k} α_iα_jα_kα_l = -6.

Wait, but hold on, in four variables, the sum over all quadruples is one term, which is α₁α₂α₃α₄, but in our case, the sum over all products of three variables is -6.

Wait, perhaps my earlier statement is incorrect. Let me check.

Wait, in four variables, the sum over all products of three variables is equal to:

(α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄)(α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄) - 3α₁α₂α₃α₄.

Which is 0 * 0 - 3*(2) = -6.

Therefore, sum_{i < j < k} α_iα_jα_k = -6.

But in our case, we have sum_{i < j < k < l} α_iα_jα_kα_l, which for four variables, is just the product α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2. So, the term is just 2.

Hence, going back, sum_{i < j} α_i²α_j² = -2 * (sum_{i < j < k < l} α_iα_jα_kα_l) = -2 * 2 = -4.

Therefore, going back to S₁² + S₂² + S₃²:

= (-4) + 6*(2) = -4 + 12 = 8.

So, S₁² + S₂² + S₃² = 8.

Wait, but I don't know if that helps me directly, because I still don't know the individual values of S₁, S₂, S₃.

Wait, but I can also compute the square of the sum S₁ + S₂ + S₃, which is S₁² + S₂² + S₃² + 2(S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃).

But we know S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0, so (S₁ + S₂ + S₃)^2 = 0 = S₁² + S₂² + S₃² + 2(S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃).

So, 0 = 8 + 2(S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃).

Therefore, S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ = -4.

Hmm, so now I have two equations:

1. S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0
2. S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ = -4

This is a system of equations involving S₁, S₂, S₃. So maybe I can think of them as roots of a cubic equation.

Let me denote S₁, S₂, S₃ as roots of the cubic equation x³ - (S₁ + S₂ + S₃)x² + (S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃)x - S₁S₂S₃ = 0.

Given that S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0 and S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ = -4, then the cubic equation becomes:

x³ + (-4)x - S₁S₂S₃ = 0.

So, x³ - 4x - c = 0, where c = S₁S₂S₃.

So, c = S₁S₂S₃.

So, if I can find c, I can write the cubic equation, and then perhaps find S₁, S₂, S₃.

So, let me compute c = S₁S₂S₃.

Wait, S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, S₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃.

So, S₁S₂S₃ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃).

This seems complicated, but maybe there is a way to express this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute S₁S₂S₃ in terms of the known symmetric sums.

Wait, let me recall that S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, S₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃.

So, S₁S₂S₃ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃).

Let me denote this as (A + B)(C + D)(E + F), where:

A = α₁α₂, B = α₃α₄,

C = α₁α₃, D = α₂α₄,

E = α₁α₄, F = α₂α₃.

So, the product is (A + B)(C + D)(E + F).

Expanding this would be tedious, but perhaps we can find a way to express it in terms of known symmetric sums.

Wait, let me note that the product S₁S₂S₃ is equal to (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃).

This expression is symmetric in the roots, so perhaps it can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric sums.

Wait, let me compute this product step by step.

First, compute (A + B)(C + D):

= AC + AD + BC + BD.

Similarly, then multiply by (E + F):

= (AC + AD + BC + BD)(E + F).

= ACE + ACF + ADE + ADF + BCE + BCF + BDE + BDF.

So, 8 terms. Each term is a product of three roots.

But let's try to express this in terms of symmetric sums.

Given that α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2,

α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0,

α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0,

α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2.

Hmm, so we can perhaps compute ACE, etc., using these.

But this seems complicated. Maybe instead of expanding, I can find a better way.

Wait, another idea: perhaps consider that S₁, S₂, S₃ can be expressed in terms of the roots in a way that allows me to relate them to the known symmetric sums.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the system of equations:

S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0,

S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ = -4,

and S₁S₂S₃ = c.

If I can find c, then I can form the cubic equation, which might have rational roots. Let me attempt that.

Wait, perhaps I can compute S₁S₂S₃ by considering the product of the two expressions (S₁ + S₂ + S₃) and (S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃) but I don't think that directly helps.

Wait, maybe I can use the relations to find c.

Wait, let me recall that S₁, S₂, S₃ are the two-term products, each grouping two roots. So, each S is a sum of two two-term products. So, perhaps each S is related to the sum of two terms.

Alternatively, perhaps using the original substitution.

Wait, I think I can use the original quartic equation to find expressions for S₁, S₂, S₃.

Wait, let's consider that α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄ satisfy the quartic, so perhaps I can write equations for each S in terms of the roots.

Alternatively, maybe I can note that S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, which can be expressed as (α₁ + α₃)(α₂ + α₄) - α₁α₃ - α₂α₄. Hmm, but that's recursive.

Wait, perhaps if I consider (α₁ + α₃)(α₂ + α₄) = α₁α₂ + α₁α₄ + α₃α₂ + α₃α₄ = S₁ + α₁α₄ + α₃α₂.

But that doesn't directly relate to S₂ or S₃.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that S₁, S₂, S₃ can be expressed as (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄) = S₁, and then relate them to other symmetric sums.

Wait, perhaps another approach: use the original quartic to find relationships between the roots.

Since each root satisfies x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0, then for each root α, we have α⁴ = -2α³ - 2.

So, maybe I can express higher-degree terms in terms of lower-degree terms.

Wait, perhaps I can compute S₁², S₂², S₃² in terms of lower-degree terms.

But earlier, I found that S₁² + S₂² + S₃² = 8.

Wait, but let me also compute S₁²S₂² + S₁²S₃² + S₂²S₃².

But that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ = -4, which we already have.

Wait, perhaps I can compute S₁S₂S₃.

Let me think differently: since S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, S₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃.

Let me denote S₁, S₂, S₃ as variables, and try to find their product.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0,

and S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ = -4,

and S₁S₂S₃ = c.

Then, perhaps the cubic equation is x³ - 4x - c = 0.

But without knowing c, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute c as follows:

Note that S₁S₂S₃ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃).

Let me denote each term as (A + B)(C + D)(E + F), but as before, it's complicated.

Wait, let me note that in the quartic, we have α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2,

and the other symmetric sums.

Wait, perhaps using Newton's identities, which relate power sums to symmetric sums.

But I don't know if that's the best way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that S₁, S₂, S₃ can be expressed in terms of the roots, but it's not clear.

Wait, another idea: since S₁, S₂, S₃ are the two-term products, perhaps I can find expressions for them in terms of the roots and then group them.

Wait, let me think of S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄.

Similarly, S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄,

S₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃.

So, if I can compute S₁S₂S₃, perhaps I can find a relationship.

Wait, S₁S₂S₃ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃).

Let me compute this product step by step.

First, compute (A + B)(C + D), where:

A = α₁α₂,

B = α₃α₄,

C = α₁α₃,

D = α₂α₄.

So, (A + B)(C + D) = AC + AD + BC + BD.

Then, multiply by (E + F), where E = α₁α₄, F = α₂α₃.

So, the product is:

(AC + AD + BC + BD)(E + F) = ACE + ACF + ADE + ADF + BCE + BCF + BDE + BDF.

So, 8 terms.

Each term is a product of three roots.

Now, since α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄ are roots of x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0, we can write down expressions for α_i², α_i³, etc., in terms of lower powers.

Specifically, from the original equation:

Each α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2.

Thus, α_i² * α_j² = α_i² * α_j². But I don't know if that helps.

Wait, but for example, α_i² * α_j² can be written as (α_i * α_j) * (α_i * α_j). But unless I can relate this to something else, it's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each term ACE, ACF, etc., using the fact that α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2.

But let's see.

First, compute ACE = α₁α₂α₁α₃α₁α₄ = α₁³α₂α₃α₄.

Similarly, ACF = α₁α₂α₁α₃α₂α₄ = α₁²α₂²α₃α₄.

Wait, but that seems messy.

Wait, maybe it's better to express each term in terms of the symmetric sums.

Wait, for example, ACE = α₁³α₂α₃α₄ = α₁² * α₁α₂α₃α₄.

Since α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2, then ACE = α₁² * 2. Similarly, ACF = α₁²α₂²α₃α₄.

But α₂²α₃α₄ = α₂ * (α₂α₃α₄). From the quartic, α₂α₃α₄ = (α₂α₃α₄) = (α₁α₂α₃α₄)/α₁ = 2/α₁.

Wait, so α₂α₃α₄ = 2/α₁.

Thus, ACF = α₁² * (α₂α₃α₄) = α₁² * (2 / α₁) = 2α₁.

Similarly, BCE = α₂α₁α₃α₂α₄ = α₂² * α₁α₃α₄. Similarly, α₁α₃α₄ = 2 / α₂.

Thus, BCE = α₂² * (2 / α₂) = 2α₂.

Similarly, BDE = α₃α₂α₄α₁α₃ = α₃² * (α₁α₂α₄). α₁α₂α₄ = 2 / α₃.

Thus, BDE = α₃² * (2 / α₃) = 2α₃.

Similarly, BDF = α₂α₃α₄α₁α₄ = α₂α₃α₄². α₂α₃α₄ = 2 / α₁. So, α₄² = something.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me tabulate each term:

ACE = α₁³α₂α₃α₄ = α₁² * α₂α₃α₄ = α₁² * (2 / α₁) = 2α₁.

Similarly,

ACF = α₁²α₂²α₃α₄ = α₁² * (α₂α₃α₄) = α₁² * (2 / α₁) = 2α₁.

Wait, wait, that seems inconsistent.

Wait, α₁²α₂²α₃α₄ = α₁² * (α₂²α₃α₄). Since α₂²α₃α₄ = (α₂α₃α₄) * α₂ = (2 / α₁) * α₂.

So, ACF = α₁² * (2 / α₁) * α₂ = 2α₁α₂.

Similarly, other terms:

BCD = α₂α₃α₄α₁α₃ = α₁α₃²α₂α₄. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should make a list.

Let me write down each term:

1. ACE = α₁³α₂α₃α₄ = α₁² * (α₂α₃α₄) = α₁² * (2 / α₁) = 2α₁.

2. ACF = α₁²α₂²α₃α₄ = α₁² * (α₂²α₃α₄) = α₁² * (α₂ * (α₂α₃α₄)) = α₁² * (α₂ * (2 / α₁)) = 2α₁α₂.

3. ADE = α₁α₂α₃²α₄. Similarly, α₃²α₄ = (α₃ * α₃)α₄. But α₃α₄ = something, but I don't know. Wait, from quartic, α₃α₄ = (x⁴ + 2x³ + 2)/α₁. Wait, no, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should use the known symmetric sums.

Wait, in the quartic, we have:

α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2,

α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0,

α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0,

α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2.

So, perhaps I can compute ACF, BCE, etc., using these.

Wait, ACF = α₁²α₂²α₃α₄.

We can write this as α₁α₂ * α₁α₂α₃α₄.

But α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2, so ACF = α₁α₂ * 2.

Similarly, if I can find α₁α₂, that might help.

Wait, but let me think about ACF.

Wait, ACF = α₁²α₂²α₃α₄.

But from the quartic, α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0.

So, α₁α₂ = - (α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄).

But that doesn't directly help.

Wait, but maybe I can write α₁α₂ in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute ACF using known symmetric sums.

Wait, ACF = α₁²α₂²α₃α₄.

Which is (α₁α₂)^2 * α₃α₄.

But from the quartic, α₃α₄ = 2 - (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄).

Wait, that seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that α_iα_jα_kα_l can be expressed in terms of the products of pairs, but I don't see a direct relation.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the expression S₁S₂S₃ in terms of the known symmetric sums.

Wait, let me note that S₁S₂S₃ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃).

Let me denote each term as follows:

A = α₁α₂,

B = α₃α₄,

C = α₁α₃,

D = α₂α₄,

E = α₁α₄,

F = α₂α₃.

So, S₁ = A + B, S₂ = C + D, S₃ = E + F.

So, S₁S₂S₃ = (A + B)(C + D)(E + F).

Expanding this, as before, the product is ACE + ACF + ADE + ADF + BCE + BCF + BDE + BDF.

So, 8 terms.

Let me compute each term:

1. ACE = α₁α₂α₁α₃α₁α₄ = α₁³α₂α₃α₄.

But α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2, so ACE = α₁³ * (2 / α₁) = 2α₁².

2. ACF = α₁α₂α₁α₃α₂α₄ = α₁²α₂²α₃α₄.

Which is α₁² * (α₂²α₃α₄).

From the quartic, α₂²α₃α₄ can be written as α₂ * (α₂α₃α₄). From the quartic, α₂α₃α₄ = (α₁α₂α₃α₄)/α₁ = 2 / α₁.

Thus, ACF = α₁² * (2 / α₁) = 2α₁.

3. ADE = α₁α₂α₁α₃α₄α₂ = α₁²α₂²α₃α₄.

Wait, similar to ACF, this is also α₁² * (α₂²α₃α₄) = 2α₁.

Wait, but that seems same as ACF.

Wait, actually, ADE = α₁α₂ * α₁α₃α₄ * α₂ = α₁²α₂²α₃α₄, which is same as ACF.

So, ADE = ACF = 2α₁.

4. ADF = α₁α₂α₁α₃α₄α₃ = α₁²α₂α₃²α₄.

Similarly, factor this as α₁² * α₂ * (α₃²α₄).

From the quartic, α₃²α₄ = (α₃ * α₃)α₄.

But α₃α₄ = 2 / α₁, so α₃²α₄ = (2 / α₁) * α₃.

Thus, ADF = α₁² * (2 / α₁) * α₃ = 2α₁α₃.

5. BCE = α₃α₄α₁α₂α₃α₄ = α₁α₂α₃²α₄.

Wait, this is similar to ADF, which we've already computed as 2α₁α₃.

So, BCE = 2α₁α₃.

6. BCF = α₃α₄α₂α₃α₄α₄ = α₂α₃²α₄².

But this seems more complicated. Let's compute it as:

α₂α₃²α₄² = α₂α₃α₄ * α₃α₄.

From quartic, α₃α₄ = 2 / α₁, so:

BCF = α₂ * (2 / α₁) * (2 / α₁) = (4α₂) / α₁².

7. BDE = α₂α₄α₁α₃α₁α₄ = α₁²α₂α₃α₄.

Which is α₁² * (α₂α₃α₄) = α₁² * (2 / α₁) = 2α₁.

8. BDF = α₂α₄α₁α₃α₂α₄ = α₂²α₃α₄².

Which is (α₂α₃α₄)² / α₃ = (2 / α₁)² / α₃ = 4 / (α₁²α₃).

So, putting it all together, S₁S₂S₃ = ACE + ACF + ADE + ADF + BCE + BCF + BDE + BDF = 2α₁ + 2α₁ + 2α₁ + 2α₁ + 2α₁α₃ + (4α₂)/α₁² + 2α₁ + 4 / (α₁²α₃).

Wait, that seems too complicated. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recompute:

After computing all terms:

1. ACE = 2α₁²,

2. ACF = 2α₁,

3. ADE = 2α₁,

4. ADF = 2α₁α₃,

5. BCE = 2α₁α₃,

6. BCF = (4α₂)/α₁²,

7. BDE = 2α₁,

8. BDF = 4 / (α₁²α₃).

Wait, so:

ACE = 2α₁²,

ACF = 2α₁,

ADE = 2α₁,

ADF = 2α₁α₃,

BCE = 2α₁α₃,

BCF = 4α₂ / α₁²,

BDE = 2α₁,

BDF = 4 / (α₁²α₃).

So, total S₁S₂S₃ = 2α₁² + 2α₁ + 2α₁ + 2α₁α₃ + 2α₁α₃ + 4α₂ / α₁² + 2α₁ + 4 / (α₁²α₃).

Simplify:

- α₁² terms: 2α₁².

- α₁ terms: 2α₁ + 2α₁ + 2α₁ + 2α₁ = 8α₁.

- α₁α₃ terms: 2α₁α₃ + 2α₁α₃ = 4α₁α₃.

- α₂ / α₁² terms: 4α₂ / α₁².

- 1 / (α₁²α₃) terms: 4 / (α₁²α₃).

So, S₁S₂S₃ = 2α₁² + 8α₁ + 4α₁α₃ + 4α₂ / α₁² + 4 / (α₁²α₃).

This seems very complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that S₁, S₂, S₃ can be expressed as products of the roots, so maybe I can write S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄ = (α₁ + α₃)(α₂ + α₄) - α₁α₃ - α₂α₄.

But from the quartic, (α₁ + α₃) and (α₂ + α₄) are roots of a quadratic equation.

Wait, let me consider that.

If I pair the roots α₁ and α₃, α₂ and α₄, then perhaps the sum α₁ + α₃ and α₂ + α₄ is a root of a quadratic equation.

Similarly, the product (α₁ + α₃)(α₂ + α₄) is equal to α₁α₂ + α₁α₄ + α₃α₂ + α₃α₄.

Wait, which is S₁ + S₂. Hmm, maybe not directly helpful.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute (α₁ + α₃)(α₂ + α₄) = α₁α₂ + α₁α₄ + α₃α₂ + α₃α₄ = S₁ + S₂.

Similarly, (α₂ + α₄)(α₁ + α₃) = same thing.

Hmm, but since (α₁ + α₃) and (α₂ + α₄) are two roots of the quadratic equation x² - (sum)x + product = 0.

But I don't know if that helps.

Wait, but perhaps, since (α₁ + α₃) and (α₂ + α₄) are roots of a quadratic equation, their product is equal to the constant term.

Wait, but without knowing the actual sum or product, it's not helpful.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can use the fact that S₁, S₂, S₃ are the two-term products and relate them to the original quartic's coefficients.

Wait, perhaps I can note that S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, so S₁ - α₁α₂ = α₃α₄.

Similarly, S₂ - α₁α₃ = α₂α₄, and S₃ - α₁α₄ = α₂α₃.

But I don't know if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can compute S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0.

So, S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0.

So, S₁ + S₂ = -S₃.

Similarly, S₁ + S₃ = -S₂, and S₂ + S₃ = -S₁.

But I don't know if that helps directly.

Wait, but if I consider S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, and S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, then perhaps I can write S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0 as:

(α₁α₂ + α₃α₄) + (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄) + (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) = 0.

Which is the same as:

α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0.

Which is consistent with Vieta's first symmetric sum.

Wait, but that doesn't help in computing S₁S₂S₃.

Wait, perhaps I can think of S₁, S₂, S₃ as the two-term products, so they are related to the elementary symmetric sums.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that S₁, S₂, S₃ are the coefficients of a cubic polynomial whose roots are the two-term products.

Wait, but I don't know.

Wait, another thought: perhaps note that S₁S₂S₃ is equal to the determinant of a certain matrix or relates to the resultant.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of S₁S₂S₃ as the product of (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃).

Let me consider expanding this product step by step.

First, compute (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄).

= α₁α₂α₁α₃ + α₁α₂α₂α₄ + α₃α₄α₁α₃ + α₃α₄α₂α₄.

Simplify:

= α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄².

Now, multiply this by (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃):

= [α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄²] * (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃).

Let me denote each term:

1. α₁²α₂α₃ * α₁α₄ = α₁³α₂α₃α₄.

2. α₁²α₂α₃ * α₂α₃ = α₁²α₂²α₃².

3. α₁α₂²α₄ * α₁α₄ = α₁²α₂²α₄².

4. α₁α₂²α₄ * α₂α₃ = α₁α₂³α₃α₄.

5. α₁α₃²α₄ * α₁α₄ = α₁²α₃²α₄².

6. α₁α₃²α₄ * α₂α₃ = α₁α₂α₃³α₄.

7. α₂α₃α₄² * α₁α₄ = α₁α₂α₃α₄³.

8. α₂α₃α₄² * α₂α₃ = α₂²α₃²α₄².

So, the product is:

α₁³α₂α₃α₄ + α₁²α₂²α₃² + α₁²α₂²α₄² + α₁α₂³α₃α₄ + α₁²α₃²α₄² + α₁α₂α₃³α₄ + α₁α₂α₃α₄³ + α₂²α₃²α₄².

Now, let's compute each term using the known symmetric sums:

1. α₁³α₂α₃α₄ = α₁² * α₁α₂α₃α₄ = α₁² * 2 = 2α₁².

2. α₁²α₂²α₃² = (α₁α₂α₃α₄)² / α₄ = (2)² / α₄ = 4 / α₄.

3. α₁²α₂²α₄² = (α₁α₂α₄)² / α₃ = (α₁α₂α₄)² / α₃.

But α₁α₂α₄ = (α₁α₂α₄) = (α₁α₂α₃α₄)/α₃ = 2 / α₃.

Thus, α₁²α₂²α₄² = (2 / α₃)² = 4 / α₃².

4. α₁α₂³α₃α₄ = α₁α₂α₃α₄ * α₂² = 2 * α₂².

5. α₁²α₃²α₄² = (α₁α₃α₄)² / α₂ = (α₁α₃α₄)² / α₂.

But α₁α₃α₄ = (α₁α₃α₄) = (α₁α₂α₃α₄)/α₂ = 2 / α₂.

Thus, α₁²α₃²α₄² = (2 / α₂)² = 4 / α₂².

6. α₁α₂α₃³α₄ = α₂α₃α₄ * α₁α₃² = (α₂α₃α₄) * α₁α₃² = (α₁α₂α₃α₄) * α₃ = 2α₃.

7. α₁α₂α₃α₄³ = (α₁α₂α₃α₄)^2 / α₃ = (2)^2 / α₃ = 4 / α₃.

8. α₂²α₃²α₄² = (α₂α₃α₄)^2 = (2 / α₁)^2 = 4 / α₁².

So, putting it all together, S₁S₂S₃ becomes:

2α₁² + [4 / α₄] + [4 / α₃²] + [2α₂²] + [4 / α₂²] + [2α₃] + [4 / α₃] + [4 / α₁²].

Hmm, this seems really complicated. Maybe it's not the right path.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that S₁, S₂, S₃ are the two-term products, so perhaps I can find their squares or products through symmetric sums.

Wait, another idea: since S₁, S₂, S₃ are the two-term products, perhaps I can write down the cubic equation whose roots are S₁, S₂, S₃.

Let me denote this cubic as x³ - (S₁ + S₂ + S₃)x² + (S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃)x - S₁S₂S₃ = 0.

We know that S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0, so the equation becomes:

x³ + (S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃)x - S₁S₂S₃ = 0.

But without knowing S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ or S₁S₂S₃, I can't solve this cubic. So, I need another approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can note that S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, S₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃.

Then, perhaps I can compute S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ as we did earlier, which was equal to -4.

So, S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ = -4.

But from Vieta's formulas, the sum S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0, and the sum S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ = -4.

So, the cubic equation is x³ - (0)x² + (-4)x - (S₁S₂S₃) = x³ - 4x - (S₁S₂S₃) = 0.

Thus, x³ - 4x - c = 0, where c = S₁S₂S₃.

But without knowing c, I can't solve this cubic equation.

Wait, but maybe I can compute c by another method.

Wait, perhaps if I consider the product (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) = S₁S₂S₃.

Let me consider expanding this product:

(α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃).

Let me denote each term as follows:

Let me expand two at a time first.

First, compute (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄):

= α₁α₂α₁α₃ + α₁α₂α₂α₄ + α₃α₄α₁α₃ + α₃α₄α₂α₄.

= α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄².

Now, multiply this by (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃):

= [α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄²] * (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃).

Let me compute each term:

1. α₁²α₂α₃ * α₁α₄ = α₁³α₂α₃α₄.

2. α₁²α₂α₃ * α₂α₃ = α₁²α₂²α₃².

3. α₁α₂²α₄ * α₁α₄ = α₁²α₂²α₄².

4. α₁α₂²α₄ * α₂α₃ = α₁α₂³α₃α₄.

5. α₁α₃²α₄ * α₁α₄ = α₁²α₃²α₄².

6. α₁α₃²α₄ * α₂α₃ = α₁α₂α₃³α₄.

7. α₂α₃α₄² * α₁α₄ = α₁α₂α₃α₄³.

8. α₂α₃α₄² * α₂α₃ = α₂²α₃²α₄².

So, the product is:

α₁³α₂α₃α₄ + α₁²α₂²α₃² + α₁²α₂²α₄² + α₁α₂³α₃α₄ + α₁²α₃²α₄² + α₁α₂α₃³α₄ + α₁α₂α₃α₄³ + α₂²α₃²α₄².

Now, let me substitute the known symmetric sums.

We know that α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2, so:

1. α₁³α₂α₃α₄ = α₁² * α₁α₂α₃α₄ = α₁² * 2 = 2α₁².

2. α₁²α₂²α₃² = (α₁α₂α₃α₄)² / α₄ = (2)^2 / α₄ = 4 / α₄.

3. α₁²α₂²α₄² = (α₁α₂α₄)^2 / α₃. But α₁α₂α₄ = (α₁α₂α₃α₄)/α₃ = 2 / α₃, so squared is 4 / α₃².

4. α₁α₂³α₃α₄ = α₂α₃α₄ * α₁α₂² = 2 * α₂².

5. α₁²α₃²α₄² = (α₁α₃α₄)^2 / α₂. But α₁α₃α₄ = 2 / α₂, so squared is 4 / α₂².

6. α₁α₂α₃³α₄ = α₂α₃α₄ * α₁α₃² = 2 * α₃².

7. α₁α₂α₃α₄³ = (α₁α₂α₃α₄)^2 / α₄ = (2)^2 / α₄ = 4 / α₄.

8. α₂²α₃²α₄² = (α₂α₃α₄)^2 = (2 / α₁)^2 = 4 / α₁².

So, substituting back:

1. 2α₁²,

2. 4 / α₄,

3. 4 / α₃²,

4. 2α₂²,

5. 4 / α₂²,

6. 2α₃²,

7. 4 / α₄,

8. 4 / α₁².

Therefore, the product is:

2α₁² + 4 / α₄ + 4 / α₃² + 2α₂² + 4 / α₂² + 2α₃² + 4 / α₄ + 4 / α₁².

Combine like terms:

- α₁² terms: 2α₁² + 4 / α₁².

- α₂² terms: 2α₂² + 4 / α₂².

- α₃² terms: 2α₃² + 4 / α₃².

- α₄ terms: 4 / α₄ + 4 / α₄ = 8 / α₄.

Thus, S₁S₂S₃ = 2α₁² + 4 / α₁² + 2α₂² + 4 / α₂² + 2α₃² + 4 / α₃² + 8 / α₄.

Hmm, this is still complicated, but maybe I can denote each term as 2α_i² + 4 / α_i².

So, S₁S₂S₃ = 2(α₁² + α₂² + α₃²) + 4(1/α₁² + 1/α₂² + 1/α₃²) + 8/α₄.

But I don't know α₁² + α₂² + α₃² or 1/α₁² + 1/α₂² + 1/α₃².

Wait, perhaps I can relate these sums to the known symmetric sums.

We know that α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2,

and α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0,

and α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0,

and α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2.

Let me compute α₁² + α₂² + α₃².

We know that α₁² + α₂² + α₃² = (α₁ + α₂ + α₃)^2 - 2(α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₂α₃).

From Vieta's, α₁ + α₂ + α₃ can be found if we know two roots, but since the quartic is quartic, I don't know the sum of three roots. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it in terms of known sums.

Wait, from Vieta, the sum of all roots is -2, so α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2.

Let me denote S₁ = α₁ + α₂ + α₃ and T₃ = α₄.

Then, S₁ + T₃ = -2.

Similarly, I can compute S₁² + S₂² + ... for the three roots.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute α₁² + α₂² + α₃² by noting that:

α₁² + α₂² + α₃² = (α₁ + α₂ + α₃)^2 - 2(α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₂α₃).

But I don't know α₁ + α₂ + α₃ or α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₂α₃.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute these using Vieta's.

Wait, but without knowing the sum of three roots, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the quartic is related to the cubic equation whose roots are the sums of pairs of roots.

Wait, but maybe it's better to use the relationships between symmetric sums.

Let me denote:

Let me denote p = α₁ + α₂ + α₃,

q = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₂α₃,

r = α₁α₂α₃.

But I don't know p, q, r.

But we know that:

Sum of roots: p + α₄ = -2.

Sum of products two at a time: q + r = 0.

Sum of products three at a time: r(α₁ + α₂ + α₃) = 0.

Wait, from the quartic, the sum of products three at a time is -2α₄.

Wait, earlier, we had:

α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = -2α₄.

So, r + rα₄ = -2α₄.

Thus, r(1 + α₄) = -2α₄.

But r = α₁α₂α₃, and if I can express this in terms of known quantities.

Wait, but I don't know α₄, but I know that all roots are related through Vieta.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that p + α₄ = -2, so α₄ = -2 - p.

Similarly, from the sum of products two at a time: q + r = 0, so q = -r.

From the sum of products three at a time: r(1 + α₄) = -2α₄.

Substituting α₄ = -2 - p, we have:

r(1 + (-2 - p)) = -2*(-2 - p).

Simplify:

r(-1 - p) = 4 + 2p.

But r = α₁α₂α₃.

Wait, from the product of all roots: α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2, so rα₄ = 2.

But α₄ = -2 - p, so r*(-2 - p) = 2.

Thus, r = 2 / (-2 - p).

Now, from the equation above:

r*(-1 - p) = 4 + 2p.

Substituting r = 2 / (-2 - p):

(2 / (-2 - p)) * (-1 - p) = 4 + 2p.

Simplify the left side:

2*(-1 - p) / (-2 - p) = [ -2(1 + p) ] / (- (2 + p)) ) = [ -2(1 + p) ] / (- (2 + p)) ) = [ 2(1 + p) ] / (2 + p).

Thus:

2(1 + p)/(2 + p) = 4 + 2p.

Multiply both sides by (2 + p):

2(1 + p) = (4 + 2p)(2 + p).

Expand the right side:

4*2 + 4p + 2p*2 + 2p*p = 8 + 4p + 4p + 2p² = 8 + 8p + 2p².

Left side: 2 + 2p.

So:

2 + 2p = 8 + 8p + 2p².

Bring all terms to one side:

2p² + 8p + 8 - 2 - 2p = 0.

Simplify:

2p² + 6p + 6 = 0.

Divide by 2:

p² + 3p + 3 = 0.

Wait, that's a quadratic equation in p. Let me solve it:

p = [ -3 ± sqrt(9 - 12) ] / 2 = [ -3 ± sqrt(-3) ] / 2.

But p is a sum of roots, which are complex numbers, so p is a complex number.

But does this make sense?

Wait, but p is a sum of roots, so it's a complex number, and this is acceptable.

But wait, does this mean that the quartic doesn't have all real roots? Because p is complex, so maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check the steps again.

We had:

r = 2 / (-2 - p).

Then, from the equation:

(2 / (-2 - p)) * (-1 - p) = 4 + 2p.

Simplify numerator:

2*(-1 - p) = -2 - 2p.

Denominator: -2 - p.

Thus, ( -2 - 2p ) / ( -2 - p ) = [ -2(1 + p) ] / [ - (2 + p) ) ] = 2(1 + p)/(2 + p).

Thus, 2(1 + p)/(2 + p) = 4 + 2p.

Multiply both sides by (2 + p):

2(1 + p) = (4 + 2p)(2 + p).

Expand RHS:

4*2 + 4p + 2p*2 + 2p² = 8 + 4p + 4p + 2p² = 8 + 8p + 2p².

So, 2 + 2p = 8 + 8p + 2p².

Bring all terms to left:

2p² + 8p + 8 - 2 - 2p = 0 → 2p² + 6p + 6 = 0 → p² + 3p + 3 = 0.

Hmm, same result. So p = [ -3 ± sqrt(9 - 12) ] / 2 = [ -3 ± i√3 ] / 2.

So, p is a complex number, which is fine.

Thus, p = [ -3 + i√3 ] / 2 or [ -3 - i√3 ] / 2.

So, now, from Vieta's, α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2.

Thus, α₄ = -2 - p.

So, if p = [ -3 + i√3 ] / 2, then α₄ = -2 - [ -3 + i√3 ] / 2 = (-4 + 3 - i√3)/2 = (-1 - i√3)/2.

Similarly, if p = [ -3 - i√3 ] / 2, then α₄ = (-1 + i√3)/2.

So, now, let me consider p = [ -3 + i√3 ] / 2.

Thus, p = α₁ + α₂ + α₃ = [ -3 + i√3 ] / 2.

Then, r = 2 / (-2 - p) = 2 / (-2 - [ -3 + i√3 ] / 2 ) = 2 / ( (-4 + 3 - i√3)/2 ) = 2 / ( (-1 - i√3)/2 ) = 2 * (2 / (-1 - i√3)) = 4 / (-1 - i√3).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

4*(-1 + i√3)/[ (-1)^2 + (√3)^2 ] = 4*(-1 + i√3)/(1 + 3) = 4*(-1 + i√3)/4 = -1 + i√3.

Thus, r = -1 + i√3.

Thus, the product of the first three roots α₁α₂α₃ = r = -1 + i√3.

Similarly, since α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2, then α₄ = 2 / r = 2 / (-1 + i√3).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (-1 - i√3):

2*(-1 - i√3)/[ (-1)^2 + (√3)^2 ] = 2*(-1 - i√3)/(1 + 3) = ( -2 - 2i√3 )/4 = (-1 - i√3)/2.

Which matches our earlier result for α₄.

So, now, I have p = [ -3 + i√3 ] / 2,

r = -1 + i√3,

α₄ = (-1 - i√3)/2.

Now, let's try to compute S₁S₂S₃.

Earlier, we found that:

S₁S₂S₃ = 2(α₁² + α₂² + α₃²) + 4(1/α₁² + 1/α₂² + 1/α₃²) + 8/α₄.

But we need expressions for these terms.

First, let me compute α₁² + α₂² + α₃².

From earlier, α₁² + α₂² + α₃² = (α₁ + α₂ + α₃)^2 - 2(α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₂α₃) = p² - 2q.

But we know q = -r = 1 - i√3.

Thus, α₁² + α₂² + α₃² = p² - 2(1 - i√3).

Compute p²:

p = [ -3 + i√3 ] / 2,

p² = [ (-3)^2 + (i√3)^2 + 2*(-3)(i√3) ] / 4 = [ 9 - 3 - 6i√3 ] / 4 = (6 - 6i√3)/4 = (3 - 3i√3)/2.

Thus, α₁² + α₂² + α₃² = (3 - 3i√3)/2 - 2*(1 - i√3) = (3 - 3i√3)/2 - 2 + 2i√3.

Convert 2 to 4/2:

= (3 - 3i√3 - 4 + 4i√3)/2 = (-1 + i√3)/2.

Thus, α₁² + α₂² + α₃² = (-1 + i√3)/2.

Next, compute 1/α₁² + 1/α₂² + 1/α₃².

Let me denote this sum as T = 1/α₁² + 1/α₂² + 1/α₃².

We can compute T as:

T = (α₂²α₃² + α₁²α₃² + α₁²α₂²) / (α₁α₂α₃)^2.

We know that α₁α₂α₃ = r = -1 + i√3.

Thus, (α₁α₂α₃)^2 = (-1 + i√3)^2 = 1 - 2i√3 - 3 = (-2 - 2i√3).

We need to compute α₂²α₃² + α₁²α₃² + α₁²α₂².

Note that α₁²α₂²α₃² = (α₁α₂α₃)^2 = [ (-1 + i√3) ]^2 = (-1)^2 + (i√3)^2 + 2*(-1)(i√3) = 1 - 3 - 2i√3 = (-2 - 2i√3).

Thus, α₂²α₃² + α₁²α₃² + α₁²α₂² = (α₁α₂α₃)^2 / α₁α₂α₃ = [ (-2 - 2i√3) ] / r.

Wait, no, actually, α₂²α₃² + α₁²α₃² + α₁²α₂² = (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₂α₃)^2 - 2α₁α₂α₃(α₁ + α₂ + α₃).

But α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₂α₃ = q = 1 - i√3.

And α₁ + α₂ + α₃ = p = (-3 + i√3)/2.

Thus, (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₂α₃)^2 = (1 - i√3)^2 = 1 - 2i√3 - 3 = (-2 - 2i√3).

2α₁α₂α₃(α₁ + α₂ + α₃) = 2r p = 2*(-1 + i√3)*[ (-3 + i√3)/2 ].

Compute this:

= (-1 + i√3)*(-3 + i√3) = (-1)(-3) + (-1)(i√3) + (i√3)*(-3) + (i√3)(i√3).

= 3 - i√3 - 3i√3 + (i²)(3).

= 3 - i√3 - 3i√3 - 3.

= (3 - 3) + (-i√3 - 3i√3).

= 0 - 4i√3.

Thus, 2α₁α₂α₃(α₁ + α₂ + α₃) = (-4i√3).

Therefore, α₂²α₃² + α₁²α₃² + α₁²α₂² = (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₂α₃)^2 - 2α₁α₂α₃(α₁ + α₂ + α₃) = (-2 - 2i√3) - (-4i√3) = (-2 - 2i√3) + 4i√3 = -2 + 2i√3.

Thus, T = (α₂²α₃² + α₁²α₃² + α₁²α₂²) / (α₁α₂α₃)^2 = (-2 + 2i√3) / (-2 - 2i√3).

Simplify this:

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: -2 + 2i√3 = -2(1 - i√3).

Denominator: -2 - 2i√3 = -2(1 + i√3).

Thus, T = [ -2(1 - i√3) ] / [ -2(1 + i√3) ] = (1 - i√3)/(1 + i√3).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i√3):

= [ (1 - i√3)^2 ] / [1 + 3] = [ 1 - 2i√3 - 3 ] / 4 = [ -2 - 2i√3 ] / 4 = (-1 - i√3)/2.

Thus, T = 1/α₁² + 1/α₂² + 1/α₃² = (-1 - i√3)/2.

Now, compute 8/α₄. Since α₄ = (-1 - i√3)/2,

8/α₄ = 8 / [ (-1 - i√3)/2 ] = 8 * [ 2 / (-1 - i√3) ] = 16 / (-1 - i√3).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (-1 + i√3):

= 16*(-1 + i√3) / [ (-1)^2 + (√3)^2 ] = 16*(-1 + i√3)/4 = 4*(-1 + i√3) = -4 + 4i√3.

Thus, 8/α₄ = -4 + 4i√3.

Now, putting it all together:

S₁S₂S₃ = 2*(α₁² + α₂² + α₃²) + 4*T + 8/α₄

= 2*(-1 + i√3)/2 + 4*(-1 - i√3)/2 + (-4 + 4i√3).

Simplify each term:

First term: 2*( (-1 + i√3)/2 ) = (-1 + i√3).

Second term: 4*(-1 - i√3)/2 = 2*(-1 - i√3) = -2 - 2i√3.

Third term: -4 + 4i√3.

Add them together:

(-1 + i√3) + (-2 - 2i√3) + (-4 + 4i√3)

= (-1 -2 -4) + (i√3 - 2i√3 + 4i√3)

= (-7) + (3i√3).

Thus, S₁S₂S₃ = -7 + 3i√3.

But this is a complex number, which doesn't seem right because the problem states that each term is a real number.

Wait, but S₁S₂S₃ is supposed to be a real number, but I'm getting a complex number. That suggests a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me check the computations again.

Wait, when I computed 2*(α₁² + α₂² + α₃²):

α₁² + α₂² + α₃² = (-1 + i√3)/2,

so 2*( -1 + i√3 ) / 2 = (-1 + i√3).

That's correct.

Next, 4*(1/α₁² + 1/α₂² + 1/α₃²):

1/α₁² + 1/α₂² + 1/α₃² = (-1 - i√3)/2,

so 4*(-1 - i√3)/2 = 2*(-1 - i√3) = (-2 - 2i√3).

That's correct.

Next, 8/α₄:

α₄ = (-1 - i√3)/2,

so 8/α₄ = 8 / [ (-1 - i√3)/2 ] = 16 / (-1 - i√3).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (-1 + i√3):

16*(-1 + i√3)/[ (-1)^2 + (√3)^2 ] = 16*(-1 + i√3)/4 = -4 + 4i√3.

Wait, that's correct.

So, adding together:

(-1 + i√3) + (-2 - 2i√3) + (-4 + 4i√3)

= (-1 - 2 - 4) + (i√3 - 2i√3 + 4i√3)

= (-7) + (3i√3).

Hmm, so S₁S₂S₃ = -7 + 3i√3.

But this is a problem because the product of three complex numbers shouldn't be real. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of S₁S₂S₃.

Wait, let me go back to the expansion:

S₁S₂S₃ = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄.

Which we expressed as:

2α₁² + [4 / α₄] + 4 / α₃² + 2α₂² + [4 / α₂²] + 2α₃² + 4 / α₄ + 4 / α₁² + 4 / α₃² + 4 / α₄ + 4 / α₁² + 4 / α₂² + 8 / α₄.

Wait, but in the earlier step, I think I missed some terms.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, since the quartic is symmetric, perhaps I can consider the product (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄) and try to relate it to the coefficients.

But I'm stuck here because I keep getting a complex number for the product, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the roots are complex. Perhaps there are real roots, but I made a mistake in assuming all roots are complex.

Wait, let me check the discriminant of the quartic equation. The discriminant of a quartic equation ax⁴ + bx³ + cx² + dx + e is complicated, but if it's positive, all roots are real; if negative, there are pairs of complex conjugates.

But calculating the discriminant of quartic is quite involved. Alternatively, since the problem states that each term is a real number, maybe all roots are real.

Wait, but the quartic equation x⁴ + 2x³ + 2x² + 2x + 1 = 0 has a negative discriminant, so it has two pairs of complex conjugate roots.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the terms S₁, S₂, S₃ are real numbers, so each two-term product is real. That could imply some symmetries in the roots.

Wait, but if the roots are complex conjugates, then α₁α₂ = conjugate(α₁α₂), so S₁ = 0.

Wait, but that would make S₁ = 0, which would make S₁S₂S₃ = 0, but that's not the case because earlier I found S₁S₂S₃ = -7 + 3i√3, which is complex.

So, that suggests that the roots are real, but then the discriminant should be positive, which is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. The problem says each term is a real number, so perhaps S₁, S₂, S₃ are real, but since S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₂α₃, which is a sum of products of complex conjugate pairs, it can be real.

Wait, but if the roots are complex conjugates, then α₁α₂ is real, since α₁ and α₂ are complex conjugates.

Wait, let me take an example. Suppose α and β are complex conjugates, so α = p + qi, β = p - qi.

Then, αβ = p² + q², which is real.

Similarly, if α and γ are complex conjugates, then αγ = real.

So, if the quartic equation has two pairs of complex conjugate roots, then S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₂α₃ would be real, as each term is real.

But in our case, S₁S₂S₃ is complex, which contradicts the problem statement that each term is a real number. So, perhaps the roots are real, but that would mean the discriminant is positive, which is conflicting.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps the roots are real, so S₁, S₂, S₃ are real, but their product is real.

Wait, let me check the quartic again. The equation is x⁴ + 2x³ + 2x² + 2x + 1 = 0.

Let me test x = -1:

(-1)^4 + 2*(-1)^3 + 2*(-1)^2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 1 - 2 + 2 - 2 + 1 = 0. So, x = -1 is a real root.

Thus, the quartic can be factored as (x + 1)(x³ + x² + x + 1).

Now, let's factor x³ + x² + x + 1.

Factor by grouping: (x³ + x²) + (x + 1) = x²(x + 1) + 1(x + 1) = (x + 1)(x² + 1).

Thus, the quartic factors as (x + 1)(x + 1)(x² + 1) = (x + 1)^2(x² + 1).

Thus, the roots are x = -1 (double root) and x = i, x = -i.

So, the quartic has two real roots (-1, -1) and two complex roots (i, -i). Wait, but that would make the quartic have a double root at x = -1.

Wait, but wait, x = -1 is a root, and x = i and x = -i are also roots.

So, the quartic is (x + 1)^2(x - i)(x + i).

Thus, the roots are:

α₁ = -1,

α₂ = -1,

α₃ = i,

α₄ = -i.

But then, compute S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄.

So, S₁ = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(i) + (-1)(-i) + (-1)(i) + (-1)(-i) + (i)(-i).

Compute each term:

(-1)(-1) = 1,

(-1)(i) = -i,

(-1)(-i) = i,

(-1)(i) = -i,

(-1)(-i) = i,

(i)(-i) = -i² = 1.

Thus, S₁ = 1 + (-i) + i + (-i) + i + 1.

Combine like terms:

1 + 1 = 2,

(-i + i) = 0,

(-i + i) = 0.

Thus, S₁ = 2.

Similarly, S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄.

Compute each term:

(-1)(i) = -i,

(-1)(-i) = i,

(-1)(i) = -i,

(-1)(-i) = i,

(i)(-i) = 1.

Thus, S₂ = (-i) + i + (-i) + i + 1.

Combine:

(-i + i) = 0,

(-i + i) = 0,

and 1.

Thus, S₂ = 1.

Similarly, S₃ = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄.

Wait, but this is the same as S₁, which is 2.

Wait, that seems odd, but in our earlier computation, S₁ was 2, and S₂ was 1, but in the quartic, the roots are -1, -1, i, -i.

But in this case, S₁ = 2, S₂ = 1, S₃ = 2.

Thus, S₁S₂S₃ = 2*1*2 = 4.

But that seems like a possible answer, but I'm not sure if this is the only solution.

Wait, but the quartic has a double root at x = -1, which complicates things, but since the problem states that each term is a real number, perhaps this is the intended solution.

Thus, S₁ = 2, S₂ = 1, S₃ = 2, so S₁S₂S₃ = 4.

But earlier, when I considered complex roots, I got a complex product, which didn't make sense, but in reality, the quartic only has two real roots and two complex roots, so S₁, S₂, S₃ are real.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's said that each term is a real number, so S₁, S₂, S₃ are real.

Thus, from the quartic factoring, we get S₁ = 2, S₂ = 1, S₃ = 2, so the product is 4.

Hence, the possible values of S₁S₂S₃ are 4.

Thus, the final answer is 4.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{4}
</think>

Given the quartic equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0\), we need to find the possible values of \(S_1S_2S_3\), where \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\).

First, we note that the roots of the quartic equation are \(-1\) (a double root) and \(i\) and \(-i\). 

We denote the roots as \(\alpha_1 = -1\), \(\alpha_2 = -1\), \(\alpha_3 = i\), and \(\alpha_4 = -i\).

Next, we compute the products \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\):

1. \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\)
   \[
   S_1 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(i) + (-1)(-i) + (-1)(i) + (-1)(-i) + (i)(-i)
   \]
   \[
   S_1 = 1 - i + i - i + i + 1 = 2
   \]

2. \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\)
   \[
   S_2 = (-1)(i) + (-1)(-i) + (-1)(i) + (-1)(-i) + (i)(-i)
   \]
   \[
   S_2 = -i + i - i + i + 1 = 1
   \]

3. \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\)
   \[
   S_3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(i) + (-1)(-i) + (-1)(i) + (-1)(-i) + (i)(-i)
   \]
   \[
   S_3 = 1 - i + i - i + i + 1 = 2
   \]

Thus, the product \(S_1S_2S_3\) is:
\[
S_1S_2S_3 = 2 \times 1 \times 2 = 4
\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{4}\).
