Question:
The solutions of the equation $z^4+4z^3i-6z^2-4zi-i=0$ are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane.  The area of this polygon can be expressed in the form $p^{a/b},$ where $a,$ $b,$ $p$ are positive integers, $p$ is prime, and $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime.  Find $a + b + p.$

Correct Answer:
By the Binomial Theorem,
\begin{align*}
(z + i)^4 &= z^4 + 4z^3 i + 6z^2 i^2 + 4zi^3 + 1 \\
&= z^4 + 4iz^3 - 6z^2 - 4iz + 1.
\end{align*}So, if $z^4 + 4z^3 i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0,$ then
\[(z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4iz^3 - 6z^2 - 4iz + 1 = 1 + i.\]Let $w = z + i,$ so $w^4 = 1 + i.$  (If we plot the solutions $w$ in the complex plane, we obtain the same area as from the solutions $z$ in the complex plane, because the substitution $w = z + i$ simply translates the polygon.)

If $w^4 = 1 + i,$ then
\[(wi)^4 = w^4 i^4 = w^4 = 1 + i.\]Thus, if $w$ is a solution, then so are $iw,$ $i^2 w = -w,$ and $i^3 w = -iw,$ which form a square in the complex plane.

From the equation $w^4 = 1 + i,$ $|w^4| = |1 + i|.$  Then $|w|^4 = \sqrt{2},$ so $|w| = 2^{1/8}.$  Therefore, the side length of the square is
\[|w - iw| = |w||1 - i| = 2^{1/8} \sqrt{2} = 2^{5/8},\]so the area of the square is $(2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{5/4}.$  The final answer is $5 + 4 + 2 = \boxed{11}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this equation: \( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \). I need to find the solutions, which are the vertices of a convex polygon, and then compute the area of that polygon. The area should be expressible in the form \( p^{a/b} \), where \( p \) is prime, \( a \) and \( b \) are relatively prime positive integers, and then find \( a + b + p \).

First, I need to solve this quartic equation. Quartic equations can be tricky, but maybe I can factor it or find some pattern. Let me write it again:

\( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6z^2 - 4i z - i = 0 \)

Hmm, the coefficients have a pattern: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. It looks similar to the expansion of \( (z + i)^4 \), but let me check.

\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4i z^3 + 6z^2 + 4i z + i^2 \)
Wait, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:
\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4i z^3 + 6z^2 + 4i z - 1 \)

Comparing with the given equation:
The given equation has \( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6z^2 - 4i z - i = 0 \). So, if I take \( (z + i)^4 \) and subtract \( 12z^2 + 8i z + (1 + i) \), that might not help.

Wait, maybe I can factor it as a product of quadratics or something similar. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be rewritten by substituting \( w = z + k \), for some constant \( k \), to simplify the equation.

But before that, let me check if it's a perfect square or something similar. Let me see:

Suppose the equation factors as \( (z^2 + a z + b)(z^2 + c z + d) \). Let me attempt to factor it.

Multiplying out:
\( (z^2 + a z + b)(z^2 + c z + d) = z^4 + (a + c) z^3 + (ac + b + d) z^2 + (ad + bc) z + bd \)

Set this equal to the given equation:
\( z^4 + 0 z^3 + (-6) z^2 + (-4i) z + (-i) = 0 \)

So, equating coefficients:

1. Coefficient of \( z^4 \): 1 = 1, which is fine.
2. Coefficient of \( z^3 \): \( a + c = 0 \)
3. Coefficient of \( z^2 \): \( ac + b + d = -6 \)
4. Coefficient of \( z \): \( ad + bc = -4i \)
5. Constant term: \( bd = -i \)

From equation 2: \( c = -a \).

From equation 5: \( b d = -i \). So, possible pairs for \( b \) and \( d \) are (1, -i), (-1, i), (i, 1), (-i, -1). Let me try each possibility.

First, try \( b = 1 \), \( d = -i \):

Then, from equation 4: \( a (-i) + (-a) (1) = -4i \)
Simplify: \( -a i - a = -4i \)
Factor out \( -a \): \( -a(i + 1) = -4i \)
Multiply both sides by -1: \( a(i + 1) = 4i \)
Thus, \( a = \frac{4i}{i + 1} \). Multiply numerator and denominator by \( -i + 1 \):

\( a = \frac{4i (-i + 1)}{(i + 1)(-i + 1)} = \frac{4i (1 - i)}{1 + 1} = \frac{4i(1 - i)}{2} = 2i(1 - i) = 2i - 2i^2 = 2i + 2 \)

So, \( a = 2 + 2i \), \( c = -a = -2 - 2i \).

Now, check equation 3: \( a c + b + d = (2 + 2i)(-2 - 2i) + 1 + (-i) \)

Compute \( (2 + 2i)(-2 - 2i) \):
= \( -4 -4i -4i -4i^2 = -4 -8i + 4 = 0 -8i \)
Thus, \( a c + b + d = (-8i) + 1 -i = 1 -9i \)

But equation 3 is supposed to be -6, so 1 -9i â‰  -6. Thus, this choice of b and d doesn't work.

Next, try \( b = -1 \), \( d = i \):

From equation 4: \( a (i) + (-a)(-1) = -4i \)
Simplify: \( ai + a = -4i \)
Factor out a: \( a(i + 1) = -4i \)
Thus, \( a = \frac{-4i}{i + 1} \). Again, multiply numerator and denominator by \( -i + 1 \):

\( a = \frac{-4i (-i + 1)}{(i + 1)(-i + 1)} = \frac{-4i(1 - i)}{2} = (-4i)(1 - i)/2 = (-2i)(1 - i) = -2i + 2i^2 = -2i - 2 \)

So, \( a = -2 - 2i \), \( c = -a = 2 + 2i \)

Check equation 3: \( a c + b + d = (-2 - 2i)(2 + 2i) + (-1) + i \)

Compute \( (-2 - 2i)(2 + 2i) \):
= \( -4 -4i -4i -4i^2 = -4 -8i + 4 = 0 -8i \)
Thus, \( a c + b + d = (-8i) -1 + i = -1 -7i \)

But equation 3 should be -6, so again not matching.

Next, try \( b = i \), \( d = -1 \):

From equation 4: \( a (-1) + (-a)(i) = -4i \)
Simplify: \( -a - a i = -4i \)
Factor out \( -a \): \( -a(1 + i) = -4i \)
Multiply both sides by -1: \( a(1 + i) = 4i \)
Thus, \( a = \frac{4i}{1 + i} \). Multiply numerator and denominator by \( 1 - i \):

\( a = \frac{4i(1 - i)}{(1 + i)(1 - i)} = \frac{4i - 4i^2}{1 + 1} = \frac{4i + 4}{2} = 2i + 2 \)

So, \( a = 2 + 2i \), \( c = -2 - 2i \)

Check equation 3: \( a c + b + d = (2 + 2i)(-2 - 2i) + i + (-1) \)
Compute \( (2 + 2i)(-2 - 2i) = -4 -4i -4i -4i^2 = -4 -8i +4 = 0 -8i \)
Thus, \( a c + b + d = (-8i) + i -1 = -1 -7i \)
Which is not equal to -6. So, this doesn't work.

Next, try \( b = -i \), \( d = 1 \):

From equation 4: \( a(1) + (-a)(-i) = -4i \)
Simplify: \( a + a i = -4i \)
Factor out a: \( a(1 + i) = -4i \)
Thus, \( a = \frac{-4i}{1 + i} \). Multiply numerator and denominator by \( 1 - i \):

\( a = \frac{-4i(1 - i)}{(1 + i)(1 - i)} = \frac{-4i + 4i^2}{2} = \frac{-4i -4}{2} = -2i -2 \)

So, \( a = -2 - 2i \), \( c = 2 + 2i \)

Check equation 3: \( a c + b + d = (-2 - 2i)(2 + 2i) + (-i) + 1 \)
Compute \( (-2 - 2i)(2 + 2i) = -4 -4i -4i -4i^2 = -4 -8i +4 = 0 -8i \)
Thus, \( a c + b + d = (-8i) -i +1 = 1 -9i \)
Which is not equal to -6. So, this also doesn't work.

Hmm, so none of the possible choices for \( b \) and \( d \) work when I assume it factors into quadratics with coefficients 1 or -1. Maybe b and d are not 1, -1, i, -i.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartic can be written as a product of two quadratics with different constants. Let me try to see if the equation can be rewritten as a quadratic in \( z^2 \) or something else.

Wait, another idea: maybe the equation is related to a known expansion. Let me consider substitution. Let me set \( w = z + i \). Let me try substituting \( z = w - i \). Maybe this can simplify the equation.

So, substitute \( z = w - i \) into the equation:

First, compute each term:

\( z = w - i \)

\( z^4 = (w - i)^4 \)

\( z^3 = (w - i)^3 \)

\( z^2 = (w - i)^2 \)

\( z = w - i \)

So, let me compute each term step by step.

First, compute \( z^4 \):

\( (w - i)^4 = w^4 - 4i w^3 - 6 w^2 - 4i w + 1 \)

Wait, let me do it step by step:

\( (w - i)^1 = w - i \)

\( (w - i)^2 = w^2 - 2i w + (-i)^2 = w^2 - 2i w -1 \)

\( (w - i)^3 = (w - i)(w^2 - 2i w -1) = w^3 - 2i w^2 - w - i w^2 + 2i^2 w + i \)
Simplify:
= \( w^3 - 2i w^2 - w - i w^2 - 2 w + i \)
= \( w^3 - (2i + i) w^2 - (1 + 2) w + i \)
= \( w^3 - 3i w^2 - 3w + i \)

Similarly, \( (w - i)^4 = (w - i)(w^3 - 3i w^2 - 3w + i) \)
= \( w^4 - 3i w^3 - 3w^2 + i w - i w^3 + 3i^2 w^2 + 3i w - i^2 \)
Simplify:
= \( w^4 - 3i w^3 - 3w^2 + i w - i w^3 - 3 w^2 + 3 w + 1 \)
Combine like terms:
- \( w^4 \)
- \( (-3i - i) w^3 = -4i w^3 \)
- \( (-3w^2 - 3w^2) = -6w^2 \)
- \( (i w + 3 w) = (i + 3) w \)
- \( +1 \)
So, \( (w - i)^4 = w^4 -4i w^3 -6 w^2 + (i + 3) w +1 \)

Now, compute \( z^3 \):

Earlier, we found \( (w - i)^3 = w^3 - 3i w^2 - 3w + i \)

Compute \( z^2 \):

Earlier, \( (w - i)^2 = w^2 - 2i w -1 \)

Compute \( z \):

\( z = w - i \)

Now, plug all into the original equation:

\( z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i = 0 \)

Substitute:

\( [w^4 -4i w^3 -6 w^2 + (i + 3) w +1] + 4i [w^3 - 3i w^2 - 3w + i] -6 [w^2 - 2i w -1] -4i [w - i] -i = 0 \)

Let me compute each term:

1. \( z^4 = w^4 -4i w^3 -6 w^2 + (i + 3) w +1 \)
2. \( 4i z^3 = 4i (w^3 - 3i w^2 -3w + i) = 4i w^3 -12 i^2 w^2 -12i w +4i^2 \)
Simplify: \( 4i w^3 +12 w^2 -12i w -4 \)
3. \( -6 z^2 = -6 (w^2 -2i w -1) = -6 w^2 +12i w +6 \)
4. \( -4i z = -4i (w -i) = -4i w +4i^2 = -4i w -4 \)
5. \( -i \)

Now, combine all these terms:

1. \( w^4 -4i w^3 -6 w^2 + (i + 3) w +1 \)
2. \( +4i w^3 +12 w^2 -12i w -4 \)
3. \( -6 w^2 +12i w +6 \)
4. \( -4i w -4 \)
5. \( -i \)

Let me add them term by term.

Start with \( w^4 \): only term 1 has \( w^4 \), so coefficient 1.

Next, \( w^3 \): term 1 has -4i w^3, term 2 has +4i w^3. So, -4i +4i = 0. So, \( w^3 \) terms cancel.

Next, \( w^2 \): term1 has -6 w^2, term2 has +12 w^2, term3 has -6 w^2. So, -6 +12 -6 = 0. So, \( w^2 \) terms cancel.

Next, \( w \): term1 has (i +3) w, term2 has -12i w, term3 has +12i w, term4 has -4i w.

Compute:

(i +3) w -12i w +12i w -4i w

Simplify:

First, (i +3) w

Then, -12i w +12i w cancels out.

Then, -4i w

So, total: (i +3 -4i) w = (-3i +3) w

So, coefficient is (3 - 3i) w.

Next, constants:

term1 has +1, term2 has -4, term3 has +6, term4 has -4, term5 has -i.

Compute:

1 -4 +6 -4 -i = (1 -4) + (6 -4) -i = (-3 +2) -i = (-1 -i)

So, overall, after substitution, the equation becomes:

\( w^4 + (3 - 3i) w + (-1 -i) = 0 \)

So, \( w^4 + (3 - 3i) w -1 -i = 0 \)

Hmm, that's a quartic in w. Let me see if I can factor this. Maybe it's a quadratic in \( w^2 \), but the coefficients are complex. Alternatively, perhaps it can be factored as a product of quadratics.

Let me try assuming it factors as \( (w^2 + a w + b)(w^2 + c w + d) \). Let's compute:

\( (w^2 + a w + b)(w^2 + c w + d) = w^4 + (a + c)w^3 + (ac + b + d)w^2 + (ad + bc)w + b d \)

Set equal to \( w^4 + 0 w^3 + 0 w^2 + (3 - 3i)w + (-1 -i) \). So, coefficients:

1. \( a + c = 0 \)
2. \( a c + b + d = 0 \)
3. \( a d + b c = 3 - 3i \)
4. \( b d = -1 -i \)

Again, let me try possible factorizations. Let me look for factors where \( b d = -1 -i \). The options for \( b \) and \( d \) are similar to the previous problem.

Possible pairs for \( b \) and \( d \): (1, -1 -i), (-1, 1 + i), (i, -1 -i), (-i, 1 + i), etc.

Let me try \( b = 1 \), \( d = -1 -i \):

From equation 1: \( a + c = 0 \)

From equation 2: \( a c + 1 + (-1 -i) = a c -i = 0 \implies a c = i \)

From equation 3: \( a d + b c = a(-1 -i) + c(1) = -a -a i + c = 3 -3i \)

But since \( c = -a \), substitute:

= \( -a -a i -a = -2a -a i = 3 -3i \)

So, equate real and imaginary parts:

Real: -2a = 3 => a = -3/2

Imaginary: -a = -3 => a = 3

Wait, that's a contradiction: a can't be both -3/2 and 2. So, this pair doesn't work.

Next, try \( b = -1 \), \( d = 1 + i \):

From equation 1: \( a + c = 0 \implies c = -a \)

From equation 2: \( a c + (-1) + (1 + i) = a c + i = 0 \implies a c = -i \)

From equation 3: \( a d + b c = a(1 + i) + (-1)(-a) = a(1 + i) + a = a(2 + i) = 3 -3i \)

Thus, \( a = (3 -3i)/(2 + i) \). Multiply numerator and denominator by \( 2 - i \):

\( a = [ (3 -3i)(2 - i) ] / (4 +1 ) = [6 -3i -6i +3i^2] /5 = [6 -9i -3]/5 = (3 -9i)/5 \)

Thus, \( a = (3 -9i)/5 \), which is complex. Then, \( c = -a = (-3 +9i)/5 \)

Check equation 2: \( a c = (3 -9i)/5 * (-3 +9i)/5 = [ -9 +27i +27i -81i^2 ] /25 = [ -9 +54i +81 ] /25 = (72 +54i)/25 \). But equation 2 requires \( a c = -i \). Clearly, (72 +54i)/25 â‰  -i. So, no good.

Next, try \( b = i \), \( d = -1 -i \):

From equation 1: \( a + c = 0 \implies c = -a \)

From equation 2: \( a c + i + (-1 -i) = a c -1 = 0 \implies a c =1 \)

From equation 3: \( a d + b c = a(-1 -i) + i(-a) = -a -a i -a i = -a -2a i = 3 -3i \)

Thus, \( -a -2a i = 3 -3i \). Let me write this as:

\( -a(1 + 2i) = 3 -3i \implies a = (3 -3i)/(-1 -2i) \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( -1 +2i \):

\( a = [ (3 -3i)(-1 +2i) ] / (1 +4 ) = [ -3 +6i +3i -6i^2 ] /5 = [ -3 +9i +6 ] /5 = (3 +9i)/5 \)

Thus, \( a = (3 +9i)/5 \), \( c = -a = (-3 -9i)/5 \)

Check equation 2: \( a c = (3 +9i)/5 * (-3 -9i)/5 = [ -9 -27i -27i -81i^2 ] /25 = [ -9 -54i +81 ] /25 = (72 -54i)/25 \). Which is not equal to 1. So, nope.

Next, try \( b = -i \), \( d =1 + i \):

From equation 1: \( a + c =0 \implies c = -a \)

From equation 2: \( a c + (-i) + (1 + i) = a c +1 =0 \implies a c = -1 \)

From equation 3: \( a d + b c = a(1 +i) + (-i)(-a ) = a(1 +i ) + a i = a(1 + 2i ) =3 -3i \)

Thus, \( a = (3 -3i)/(1 +2i ) \). Multiply numerator and denominator by \(1 -2i \):

\( a = [ (3 -3i)(1 -2i) ] /5 = [3 -6i -3i +6i^2 ] /5 = [3 -9i -6 ] /5 = (-3 -9i)/5 \)

Thus, \( a = (-3 -9i)/5 \), \( c = 3/5 +9i/5 \)

Check equation 2: \( a c = (-3 -9i)/5 * (3 +9i)/5 = [ -9 -27i +27i +81i^2 ] /25 = [ -9 +81(-1) ] /25 = (72)/25 \). But equation 2 requires \( a c = -1 \). Doesn't work.

So, none of these pairs work either. Hmm, maybe this quartic is irreducible over the reals or complex numbers. But perhaps I should consider a substitution.

Wait, another idea: the original quartic equation seems to resemble the expansion of \( (z + i)^4 \), but with some coefficients modified. Let me compute \( (z + i)^4 \) again:

\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z +1 \)

Wait, hold on, that is exactly the same as the given equation! So, the original equation is equal to \( (z + i)^4 -2i =0 \). Therefore, the solutions are the 4th roots of \(2i\).

So, equation: \( (z + i)^4 = 2i \)

Thus, the solutions are \( z + i = \sqrt[4]{2i} \). So, to find the roots, I need to compute the 4th roots of \(2i\).

Let me compute \(2i\) in polar form: modulus is 2, argument is \( \pi/2 \) (since it's along the positive imaginary axis). Therefore, the 4th roots will have modulus \( (2)^{1/4} = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \), which is \(2^{1/4}\), and arguments \( \frac{\pi/2 + 2k\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{8} + \frac{k\pi}{2} \) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, 3\).

So, the four roots are:

\( z + i = 2^{1/4} \left( \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{8} + \frac{k\pi}{2} \right ) + i \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{8} + \frac{k\pi}{2} \right ) \right ) \) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, 3\)

Therefore, the solutions \( z \) are:

\( z = -i + 2^{1/4} \left( \cos \theta_k + i \sin \theta_k \right ) \), where \( \theta_k = \frac{\pi}{8} + \frac{k\pi}{2} \)

So, each root is a point in the complex plane. To find the area of the convex polygon formed by these roots, I need to figure out the shape.

Since it's a square, if the roots are equally spaced on a circle of radius \(2^{1/4}\). So, the four roots lie on a circle, each separated by 90 degrees. Therefore, the convex hull is a square inscribed in the circle.

But wait, is that the case? Let me compute the roots explicitly.

Compute each root:

For \(k=0\):

\( \theta = \pi/8 \)

\( z = -i + 2^{1/4} ( \cos \pi/8 + i \sin \pi/8 ) \)

Similarly, for \(k=1\):

\( \theta = \pi/8 + \pi/2 = 5\pi/8 \)

\( z = -i + 2^{1/4} ( \cos 5\pi/8 + i \sin 5\pi/8 ) \)

For \(k=2\):

\( \theta = \pi/8 + \pi = 9\pi/8 \)

\( z = -i + 2^{1/4} ( \cos 9\pi/8 + i \sin 9\pi/8 ) \)

For \(k=3\):

\( \theta = \pi/8 + 3\pi/2 = 13\pi/8 \)

\( z = -i + 2^{1/4} ( \cos 13\pi/8 + i \sin 13\pi/8 ) \)

So, each root is a point with coordinates:

Real part: \( -\text{Im}(i) + 2^{1/4} \cos \theta_k = -1 + 2^{1/4} \cos \theta_k \)

Imaginary part: \( -1 + 2^{1/4} \sin \theta_k \)

So, the four points in the complex plane are:

1. \( (-1 + 2^{1/4} \cos \pi/8, -1 + 2^{1/4} \sin \pi/8 ) \)
2. \( (-1 + 2^{1/4} \cos 5\pi/8, -1 + 2^{1/4} \sin 5\pi/8 ) \)
3. \( (-1 + 2^{1/4} \cos 9\pi/8, -1 + 2^{1/4} \sin 9\pi/8 ) \)
4. \( (-1 + 2^{1/4} \cos 13\pi/8, -1 + 2^{1/4} \sin 13\pi/8 ) \)

Wait, actually, no: the root \( z = -i + 2^{1/4} (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta ) \) can be written as \( (-1 + 2^{1/4} \sin \theta ) + i (-1 + 2^{1/4} \cos \theta ) \). Wait, is that correct? Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Given \( z = -i + 2^{1/4} (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta ) \), so:

Real part: \( -1 + 2^{1/4} \cos \theta \)

Imaginary part: \( -1 + 2^{1/4} \sin \theta \)

Yes, correct. So, each root is a point with coordinates:

\( ( -1 + 2^{1/4} \cos \theta, -1 + 2^{1/4} \sin \theta ) \), where \( \theta = \pi/8, 5\pi/8, 9\pi/8, 13\pi/8 \)

So, these points are equally spaced around a circle of radius \(2^{1/4}\) centered at \( (-1, -1) \).

Wait, no. The center is not (-1, -1). Let me think. The center is actually at \( -i \), which is (0, -1). Because \( z = -i + 2^{1/4} e^{i\theta} \). So, the center is at (0, -1), and the radius is \(2^{1/4}\).

So, the four points are on a circle of radius \(2^{1/4}\) centered at (0, -1). The convex hull is a square, but since the center is not at the origin, the square is rotated.

To find the area, I can compute the area of the square. Since it's a square inscribed in a circle of radius \( r = 2^{1/4} \), the diagonal of the square is \( 2r = 2^{1/2} \). The side length of the square is \( \frac{2r}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} r \). Thus, the area is \( ( \sqrt{2} r )^2 = 2 r^2 \).

Wait, let me verify:

If a square is inscribed in a circle of radius \( R \), then the diagonal is \( 2R \). The side length \( s \) of the square satisfies \( s \sqrt{2} = 2R \), so \( s = \sqrt{2} R \). Therefore, the area is \( s^2 = 2 R^2 \).

Yes, so in this case, \( R = 2^{1/4} \), so \( R^2 = \sqrt{2} \). Therefore, area is \( 2 * \sqrt{2} = 2^{3/2} \).

But wait, hold on. The center is at (0, -1), but does that affect the area? Since the area is determined by the distances between the points, which are on a circle of radius \(2^{1/4}\), the area should be the same regardless of the center. So, the area should be \( 2^{3/2} \), which can be expressed as \( 2^{1/2 + 1} = 2^{3/2} \). So, \( a =3 \), \( b=2 \), \( p=2 \), so \( a + b + p = 3 + 2 + 2 =7 \).

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe the center is at (0, -1), so the points are at:

For each \( \theta \), \( (-1 + 2^{1/4} \cos \theta, -1 + 2^{1/4} \sin \theta ) \). So, the square is centered at (0, -1), but the side length is dependent on the radius.

Wait, but if the square is inscribed in a circle of radius \(2^{1/4}\), the distance from the center to each vertex is \(2^{1/4}\). So, if all four points are each at distance \(2^{1/4}\) from (0, -1), but the side length of the square can be found by the chord length between two adjacent points.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the distance between two adjacent points.

Take two points, say for \(k=0\) and \(k=1\):

Point 1: \( (-1 + a \cos \theta_0, -1 + a \sin \theta_0 ) \)
Point 2: \( (-1 + a \cos \theta_1, -1 + a \sin \theta_1 ) \)
where \( a =2^{1/4} \), \( \theta_0 = \pi/8 \), \( \theta_1 = 5\pi/8 \)

The distance squared between them is:

\( (a \cos \theta_1 - a \cos \theta_0 )^2 + (a \sin \theta_1 - a \sin \theta_0 )^2 \)

= \( a^2 [ (\cos \theta_1 - \cos \theta_0 )^2 + (\sin \theta_1 - \sin \theta_0 )^2 ] \)

= \( a^2 [ 2 - 2 (\cos \theta_1 \cos \theta_0 + \sin \theta_1 \sin \theta_0 ) ] \)

= \( a^2 [ 2 - 2 \cos( \theta_1 - \theta_0 ) ] \)

Since \( \theta_1 - \theta_0 = 5\pi/8 - \pi/8 = 4\pi/8 = \pi/2 \), so:

= \( a^2 [ 2 - 2 \cos( \pi/2 ) ] = a^2 [ 2 - 0 ] = 2 a^2 \)

Thus, distance squared is \( 2 a^2 \), so distance is \( a \sqrt{2} \).

Since \( a =2^{1/4} \), the side length is \( 2^{1/4} \times \sqrt{2} = 2^{1/4 + 1/2} = 2^{3/4} \).

Therefore, the side length is \(2^{3/4}\), so the area is \( (2^{3/4})^2 = 2^{3/2} \). So, yes, the area is \(2^{3/2}\), which is \(8^{1/2}\), but \(2^{3/2}\) is fine.

Expressed as \( p^{a/b} \), let me write \(2^{3/2} = p^{a/b}\). Since \(p\) is prime, 2 is prime. So, \( p=2 \), \( a=3 \), \( b=2 \). Thus, \(a + b + p = 3 + 2 + 2 =7\).

Therefore, the answer is 7.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{7}

The equation given is \( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \). We need to find the solutions and determine the area of the convex polygon formed by these vertices in the complex plane.

First, we recognize that the equation can be rewritten as \((z + i)^4 = 2i\). This is because the given polynomial is the expansion of \((z + i)^4\) with some coefficients adjusted. 

The solutions to this equation are the 4th roots of \(2i\). The modulus of \(2i\) is 2, and its argument is \(\pi/2\). Therefore, the 4th roots have a modulus of \(2^{1/4}\) and arguments \(\frac{\pi/2 + 2k\pi}{4}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, 3\).

The four roots are:
- \( z = -i + 2^{1/4} (\cos \theta_k + i \sin \theta_k ) \) where \(\theta_k = \frac{\pi}{8} + \frac{k\pi}{2}\).

These roots form a square centered at \((0, -1)\) with radius \(2^{1/4}\). The distance between any two adjacent vertices (side length of the square) is \(2^{3/4}\). The area of the square is calculated as \((2^{3/4})^2 = 2^{3/2}\).

Expressing this area as \(p^{a/b}\), we have \(2^{3/2}\) where \(p = 2\), \(a = 3\), and \(b = 2\). Therefore, \(a + b + p = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
