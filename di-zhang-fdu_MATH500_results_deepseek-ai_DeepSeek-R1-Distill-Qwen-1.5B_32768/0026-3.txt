Question:
The expression $$1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$$is equivalent to 13. If we add parentheses in various locations, we can change this value. For example, $1+2+3-(4+5)+6=1+2+3-9+6=6-9+6=3$. If we only add parentheses (and not rearrange the order of the terms), what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain? (For the purposes of this problem, we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication. For example, $ (1+2+3)(-4)+5+6 $ is not a valid placement of parentheses.)

Enter your answer as a single value.

Correct Answer:
Because every term before the subtraction sign is added, and addition is associative (parentheses don't matter) placing parentheses on them will not change their value. However, subtraction is not associative. Since we are trying to minimize this expression's value, we want to subtract as much as possible. The expression is thus minimized when parentheses are placed in the following location: $1+2+3-(4+5+6)$. This simplifies to $1+2+3-15 = 6-15=\boxed{-9}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the minimum possible value of the expression \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\) by adding parentheses in various locations without changing the order of the terms. I can only add parentheses, not rearrange the numbers or change the operations. The example given is \(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6 = 3\), which is less than 13. So, my goal is to figure out the smallest possible value by strategically placing parentheses.

First, let me understand the problem. The original expression is \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\). Without parentheses, the value is 13. But by adding parentheses, we can change the order of operations, which can affect the result. The key here is to figure out where to place the parentheses to minimize the total sum.

I know that parentheses can change the order in which operations are performed. For example, if I add parentheses around a part of the expression, that part will be evaluated first. So, for instance, in the example, the user added parentheses around \(4 + 5\), turning it into a separate term, effectively subtracting that sum from the rest.

To minimize the total, I want to make as large a number as possible negative. That is, I want to group negative numbers with as many positive numbers as possible when I add parentheses around them. Because if I can subtract a large positive number, that will bring the total down.

Let me break down the expression step by step. The expression is:

1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6

First, I can think of the operations as:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 - 4 = 2

2 + 5 = 7

7 + 6 = 13

But that's without any parentheses. Now, if I use parentheses, I can change the order.

I need to figure out where to place the parentheses to make this as small as possible.

Let me consider different groupings.

Option 1: Group the last two numbers.

(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5) + 6

Let's compute the inner parentheses first:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 - 4 = 2

2 + 5 = 7

Then, 7 + 6 = 13. So that's the same as before.

Wait, that's not helpful. Maybe I need to group differently.

Option 2: Group the last three numbers.

1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6)

Compute the inner parentheses:

4 + 5 = 9

9 + 6 = 15

Then, 1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 - 15 = -9

That's a much smaller number, -9. Hmm.

But is that allowed? The problem says we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication, but it allows parentheses. So I think that grouping is allowed.

Wait, so is that the minimum? Hmm, maybe not. Let's see.

Wait, another approach: Maybe group the first few numbers and then the last few.

For example, (1 + 2 + 3) - (4 + 5) + 6

Compute inner parentheses:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

4 + 5 = 9

Then, 6 - 9 = -3

-3 + 6 = 3

So, that's 3, which is higher than -9.

Alternatively, another grouping: (1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6

Compute inner parentheses:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 - 4 = 2

2 + 5 = 7

7 + 6 = 13

Same as original.

Another grouping: (1 + 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 + 6)

Compute inner parentheses:

1 + 2 = 3

3 - 4 = -1

5 + 6 = 11

Then, 3 + (-1) + 11 = 13

Same as before.

Wait, so the previous grouping gave me -9, which is better.

Is there a way to get lower than -9?

Let's think.

What if I group the first four numbers together?

(1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6 = (6) + 5 + 6 = 17

That's worse.

Alternatively, group the last two:

1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) = 6 - 15 = -9

Same as before.

Alternatively, group the first number with the next two:

1 + (2 + 3) - 4 + 5 + 6

Compute inner parentheses:

2 + 3 = 5

1 + 5 = 6

6 - 4 = 2

2 + 5 = 7

7 + 6 = 13

Same as original.

Alternatively, group three numbers:

1 + 2 + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6

Compute inner parentheses:

3 - 4 = -1

1 + 2 = 3

3 + (-1) = 2

2 + 5 = 7

7 + 6 = 13

Same as before.

Another idea: Group the first five numbers:

(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5) + 6

Compute inner parentheses:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 - 4 = 2

2 + 5 = 7

7 + 6 = 13

Same as original.

Alternatively, group the first four numbers and leave the rest:

(1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6 = 2 + 5 + 6 = 13

Same.

Wait, another approach: Maybe group the last three numbers:

1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6)

That's what I did earlier, which gives -9.

Is that the minimum? Or is there a way to group more numbers in the negative?

Wait, let's try grouping four numbers in the negative:

(1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6 = 2 + 5 + 6 = 13. Not helpful.

Alternatively, group three numbers in the negative and two in the positive:

(1 + 2 + 3) - (4 + 5) + 6 = 6 - 9 + 6 = 3

Which is higher than -9.

Alternatively, group two numbers in the negative:

(1 + 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 + 6) = 3 -1 + 11 = 13

Same as before.

Alternatively, group the last two numbers, but as a positive (which I already did) and got -9.

Wait, perhaps if I group the last two numbers as a negative.

Wait, but in the expression, the operations are either addition or subtraction. So, when I add parentheses, I can create negative numbers by grouping terms together.

Wait, another way: group the first number with the second, then subtract the third, add the fourth, subtract the fifth, and add the sixth.

Wait, that's the original expression: 1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 + 6.

But if I change the grouping, can I make this expression have more negative terms?

Wait, perhaps group the first three numbers as a negative? Let me try:

- (1 + 2 + 3) + 4 + 5 + 6 = -6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = (-6 + 4) + 5 + 6 = (-2) + 5 + 6 = 9

That's higher than -9.

Alternatively, group the last three numbers as a negative: 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) = 6 - 15 = -9

Same as before.

Alternatively, group the first two and the next two:

(1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6 = 2 + 5 + 6 = 13

Same as before.

Wait, so maybe -9 is the minimum.

But let me check another grouping.

What if I group the first four numbers as a positive:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 - 5 + 6

Wait, but that would require changing the original expression. Wait, no, the original expression is 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6.

Wait, if I group as (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) - 5 + 6, that would be 10 - 5 + 6 = 11.

Alternatively, group the first four numbers as a positive and then subtract 5 and add 6, but that's same as above.

Alternatively, group three numbers and subtract the next two, then add the next two.

But I think that's not better.

Wait, perhaps grouping the first three and subtracting the next two:

1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 6 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 2 + 5 + 6 = 13

Same as before.

Alternatively, group the first three as a negative:

- (1 + 2 + 3) + 4 + 5 + 6 = -6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 9

Same as before.

Alternatively, group the first four as a negative and leave the rest as positive:

- (1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6 = -1 + 5 + 6 = 10

Wait, that's 10, which is higher than -9.

Alternatively, group the first five numbers as a negative:

- (1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5) + 6 = - (2 + 5) + 6 = -7 + 6 = -1

Wait, that's -1, which is higher than -9.

So, that's worse.

Wait, so grouping the first four numbers as a negative gives me -1, which is higher than -9, so it's worse.

Hmm.

Alternatively, group the last two as a negative, but as I did before, that gives -9.

Alternatively, group the first number with the next two:

(1 + 2 + 3) - 4 + 5 + 6 = 6 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 2 + 5 + 6 = 13

Same as before.

Alternatively, group the first number, then the next two, and the last two:

1 + (2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6 = 1 + (5 - 4) + 5 + 6 = 1 + 1 + 5 + 6 = 13

Same.

Alternatively, group the first two, then the next two, then the last two:

(1 + 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 + 6) = 3 -1 + 11 = 13

Same.

Alternatively, group the first three as a negative and leave the rest as positive:

- (1 + 2 + 3) + 4 + 5 + 6 = -6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 9

Same.

Alternatively, group the first four as a positive and the last two as a negative:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 - (5 + 6) = 10 - 11 = -1

Same as before.

Wait, that's -1, which is lower than -9? No, it's -1, which is higher than -9 because -1 is to the right of -9 on the number line.

Wait, no, -9 is less than -1. So, -9 is smaller.

So, so far, I have -9 as a possible value.

Is there a way to get lower than -9?

Wait, let's think differently.

What if I group more numbers together? For instance, group the first number with the next two, then subtract the next two, then add the last two.

Wait, that would be: (1 + 2) - (3 + 4) + 5 + 6 = 3 -7 +5 +6 = (-4) +5 +6 = 7

Same as before.

Alternatively, group the first number with the next three:

(1 + 2 + 3) - 4 + 5 + 6 = 6 -4 +5 +6 = 3 +5 +6 = 14

Same.

Alternatively, group the first number with the next four:

(1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6 = 2 +5 +6 = 13

Same as before.

Alternatively, group the first number with the next five:

(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5) +6 = 7 +6 =13

Same.

Alternatively, group the first number with the next two and subtract the next two:

1 + (2 + 3 -4) +5 +6 =1 + (5 -4) +5 +6=1 +1 +5 +6=13

Same.

Alternatively, group the first number with the next three:

1 + 2 + 3 - (4 +5) +6 = 6 -9 +6=3

Same as before.

Alternatively, group the first number with the next four:

1 + 2 + 3 - 4 +5 +6=10

Same.

Wait, so all these groupings either result in 13, 13, 3, 14, 13, -9, 13, 13, 13, 10, 13.

So, the lowest value I have found so far is -9.

Is that the minimum? Or is there a way to make it lower?

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe group three numbers and subtract the rest.

Wait, for example, group 1, 2, 3 as a negative, and then add the rest.

So, -(1 + 2 + 3) + 4 +5 +6 = -6 +4 +5 +6=9

Which is higher.

Alternatively, group 1, 2 as a negative, and 3, -4, 5, 6 as positives.

Wait, but the expression has to be evaluated with operations. So, if I group 1 and 2 together as a negative, and then 3, -4, 5, 6 as positives. But I think the operations have to be in a way that the grouping is sequential.

Wait, actually, in the original expression, the operations are addition and subtraction, so in a way, each operation is between two numbers.

So, perhaps if I group 1, 2, 3, -4, 5, 6 as a single expression, but without parentheses, it's 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6.

Wait, but if I can group some of the numbers, maybe as negatives.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the expression as a series of numbers with operations.

We have six numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

We can assign each number a sign: either positive or negative.

Our goal is to assign signs to each number except for the first one, because it's a positive.

Wait, actually, the first number is always positive.

So, the expression can be rewritten as:

±1 ±2 ±3 ±4 ±5 ±6

But we can only change the signs of the numbers, not the operations.

Wait, no, that's not entirely accurate. Because the expression is grouped by parentheses, which can change the order, but not the operations.

Wait, actually, no. The initial expression is linear, so the parentheses can only change the grouping of the numbers, but not the operators.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the entire expression as a sequence of operations.

So, for example, the original expression is 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6.

If I group 1 + 2 + 3 as a single term, then subtract 4, add 5, and add 6.

So, it's like (1+2+3) -4 +5 +6.

Which is 6 -4 +5 +6 = 3.

Alternatively, if I group 1 + 2 as a term, subtract 3, add 4, subtract 5, add 6.

So, (1+2) -3 +4 -5 +6 = 3 -3 +4 -5 +6 = 0 +4 -5 +6 = 4 -5 +6 = -1 +6 =5.

Which is higher than -9.

Alternatively, group 1 + 2 + 3 -4 as a term, then add 5, add 6.

So, (1+2+3-4) +5 +6=2+5+6=13.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a term, add 6.

So, (1+2+3-4+5)+6=7+6=13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term, which is 13.

Alternatively, group in a different way.

Wait, perhaps group 1 +2 as a term, subtract 3, add 4, subtract 5, add 6.

So, (1+2) -3 +4 -5 +6=3 -3 +4 -5 +6=0 +4 -5 +6=4 -5 +6= -1 +6=5.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a term, and then add 6.

So, (1+2+3-4+5)+6=7+6=13.

Wait, same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 as a term, then add 5, add 6.

So, (1+2+3-4)+5+6=2+5+6=13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term, subtract 3, add 4, subtract 5, add 6.

Which gives us 5, as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 as a term, which is 2, then add 5 and 6.

So, 2 +5 +6=13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a term, which is 7, then add 6 as 13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term, subtract 3, add 4, subtract 5, add 6, which is 5.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term, which is 13.

Alternatively, group different numbers.

Wait, perhaps group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a term, which is 7, then add 6 as 13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term, which is 13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 as a term, which is 2, then add 5 and 6 as 13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term, subtract 3, add 4, subtract 5, add 6, which is 5.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 as a term, subtract 4, add 5, add 6, which is 13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 as a term, which is 2, then subtract 5, add 6, which is 3.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a term, which is 7, then add 6 as 13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term, which is 13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term, subtract 3, add 4, subtract 5, add 6, which is 5.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term, which is 13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term, same thing.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a term, which is 7, then add 6 as 13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term, subtract 3, add 4, subtract 5, add 6, which is 5.

So, after all these groupings, the minimum I have found is -9.

Is there a way to make this lower?

Wait, let's think about how negative can we make the expression.

Each time we group numbers together, if they are all subtracted, we can make the expression more negative.

But the expression is linear, so each number's sign is determined by its position.

Wait, but the expression can be rewritten as a series of additions and subtractions.

Wait, maybe I need to assign each number a coefficient of +1 or -1, such that the expression evaluates to the sum of (±1 ±2 ±3 ±4 ±5 ±6), except for the first term, which is always positive.

Wait, but actually, the first term is 1, then the rest can be positive or negative.

Wait, let me think.

Wait, in the original expression, it's 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6.

If I can change the signs of some of the numbers, but only by adding parentheses.

But the problem is that parentheses can change the order of operations, not the operators.

Wait, so for example, if I group 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 as a single expression, it's 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 9.

Alternatively, if I group it differently, like (1 + 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 + 6) = 3 -1 +11=13.

Alternatively, group it as (1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + (5 +6)=2 +11=13.

Alternatively, group it as 1 + (2 + 3 -4) + (5 +6)=1 +1 +11=13.

Alternatively, group it as 1 + 2 + (3 -4 +5) +6=1 +2 +4 +6=13.

Alternatively, group it as 1 + 2 +3 - (4 +5) +6=1 +2 +3 -9 +6=7 -9 +6=4.

Wait, so grouping differently can give different results.

Wait, so perhaps the expression can be evaluated as follows:

1 + 2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

But parentheses can change the order.

Wait, perhaps I can group 1 + 2 as a term, subtract 3, add 4, subtract 5, add 6, which is 1 +2 -3 +4 -5 +6=1 +2=3; 3 -3=0; 0 +4=4; 4 -5=-1; -1 +6=5.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 as a term, then add 5, add 6: 2 +5 +6=13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a term: 7, then add 6: 13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term:3, subtract 3:0, add 4:4, subtract 5:-1, add 6:5.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 as a term:6, subtract 4:2, add 5:7, add 6:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a term:7, add 6:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term:3, subtract 3:0, add 4:4, subtract 5:-1, add 6:5.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Wait, is there a way to get a more negative number?

Wait, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term, it's 13.

Alternatively, if I group more numbers together.

Wait, perhaps group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term.

Wait, no.

Wait, another idea: Maybe group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term, but that's 13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 without parentheses, which is 13.

Wait, but what if I group some numbers as negative?

Wait, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term, which is 13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term, same thing.

Wait, maybe if I group 1 +2 as a term:3, subtract 3:0, add 4:4, subtract 5:-1, add 6:5.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Wait, so perhaps the minimum I can get is -9.

Let me check that again:

(1 + 2 + 3) - (4 +5) +6.

Compute each part: 6 -9 +6.

Which is 3.

Wait, no, that's 6 -9 +6=3.

Wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, but earlier, I thought of grouping as (1 +2 +3 -4) +5 +6=2 +5 +6=13.

Wait, but another way: (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5) +6.

Wait, so 6 -9 +6=3.

Wait, no, but earlier, I thought of grouping something else.

Wait, wait, perhaps I can make it negative.

Wait, maybe group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a term:7, then add 6:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Wait, so is there a way to get a negative number?

Wait, perhaps group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Wait, so maybe -9 is the lowest.

Wait, let me think differently.

Suppose I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Wait, another idea: Group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Wait, maybe group 1 +2 as a term:3, subtract 3:0, add 4:4, subtract 5:-1, add 6:5.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Wait, is there a way to group numbers such that the negative numbers are as much as possible?

Wait, perhaps group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 as a term:2, then add 5 +6:2 +5 +6=13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a term:7, then add 6:13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Wait, so seems like 13 is the maximum.

Wait, but in the previous case, I had (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= (6 -4 +5) +6=7 +6=13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term:3, subtract 3:0, add 4:4, subtract5:-1, add6:5.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Wait, so all these groupings either give me 13 or 5. So, the minimum I can get is 5.

But wait, no, I thought of -9 earlier, but maybe that is incorrect.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term, which is 13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term:3, subtract 3:0, add 4:4, subtract5:-1, add6:5.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 as a term:2, then add5 +6:2 +5 +6=13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Wait, so seems like 5 is the minimum.

But wait, that's not correct because I thought I had -9.

Wait, let me try another grouping.

What if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term:3, subtract 3:0, add 4:4, subtract5:-1, add6:5.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Wait, same.

Wait, is there a way to make it negative?

Wait, for example, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Wait, but maybe group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term:3, subtract 3:0, add4:4, subtract5:-1, add6:5.

Same as before.

Wait, so I'm starting to think that -9 might be the minimum.

But how?

Wait, let me try a different approach.

Let me think of the expression as having numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6.

If I can make as many negative terms as possible, starting from the left.

So, if I can group the first three numbers as a negative, then subtract the next two, add the last one.

Wait, so (1 +2 +3) -4 +5 +6.

Compute that:6 -4 +5 +6=2 +5 +6=13.

Same.

Alternatively, group the first four as a negative: - (1 +2 +3 -4) +5 +6= -1 +5 +6=10.

Same.

Alternatively, group first five as a negative: - (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= - (7) +6= -1.

Wait, that's -1.

Wait, so that's lower than -9.

Wait, how?

Wait, let me compute that step by step:

1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6=1 +2=3; 3 +3=6; 6 -4=2; 2 +5=7; 7 +6=13.

Wait, same as before.

Wait, but if I group the first five numbers as a negative:1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, then add 6.

So, -(1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= -(7) +6= -1.

Wait, but wait, is that allowed?

Because the expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

If I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, that would mean:

- (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= - (7) +6= -1.

Which is different from the previous grouping.

So, that's -1.

Wait, that's better than -9.

Wait, so that's a different approach.

Is that allowed?

Because grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, then adding 6.

So, the expression becomes:

- (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= - (7) +6= -1.

So, that's -1.

But wait, is that a valid grouping?

In the original expression, the operations are addition and subtraction, not necessarily the order of operations.

So, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, that would change the order of operations, effectively making it negative.

So, is that allowed?

Wait, in the original expression, the operations are in a certain order.

But if I want to group a subset of these terms with parentheses, it's allowed.

So, for example, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term would change the order of operations, effectively making that part of the expression negative.

But then, adding 6 at the end.

So, -(1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= - (7) +6= -1.

That's a different result.

So, that's a valid grouping.

Similarly, let me check another way.

What if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: - (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6)= - (13)= -13.

But that's worse.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, add6: -7 +6= -1.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 as a negative term, then add5 +6: - (2) +11=9.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 as a negative term: - (6) +4 +5 +6= -6 +15=9.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a negative term: -3 +3 -4 +5 +6=0 -4 +5 +6=1 +6=7.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term: -7 +6= -1.

Wait, that's the lowest so far.

Wait, is there a way to get lower?

Wait, let's try grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 -3 +4 -5 +6: which is 1 +2=3; 3 -3=0; 0 +4=4; 4 -5= -1; -1 +6=5.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 -5 +6:1 +2=3; 3 +3=6; 6 -4=2; 2 -5= -3; -3 +6=3.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6:1 +2=3; 3 +3=6; 6 -4=2; 2 +5=7; 7 -6=1.

So, 1.

But that's not better.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a negative term: -3 +3 -4 +5 +6=0 -4 +5 +6=1 +6=7.

No.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 as a negative term: -2 +5 +6=9.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term: -7 +6=-1.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

So, it seems that -1 is the lowest I can get by grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, then adding 6.

But wait, is that allowed? Because grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, the rest is added.

Wait, so the expression would be - (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= - (7) +6= -1.

Yes, that's allowed.

Is that the minimum?

Wait, let me think.

Wait, is there a way to group more numbers to make the expression even more negative?

Wait, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Wait, but that's worse.

Alternatively, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term and add6, which is -7 +6=-1.

Alternatively, can I group more than that?

Wait, let me try grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term: -7 +6=-1.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 as a negative term: -6 +4 +5 +6= -6 +15=9.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same thing.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same as before.

Wait, no, seems that the only way to make it negative is by grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term and adding6, which gives -1.

Is that the minimum?

But let me check another grouping.

Wait, if I group 1 +2 as a term:3, subtract3:0, add4:4, subtract5:-1, add6:5.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term: -7 +6=-1.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

So, seems like -1 is the lowest I can get.

Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, in the expression, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term, that would be -13, but that's worse than -1.

Alternatively, grouping a subset of numbers as negative.

Wait, in the expression, the operations are between the numbers, so if I group a subset, it's as if I have a sub-expression that's evaluated as negative.

So, for example, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term would be - (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6)= -13.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term: -7 +6= -1.

So, in the latter case, it's a negative term, and then adding6.

So, that's better.

Is there a way to get it lower?

Wait, let's see.

Wait, what if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, which is -7, then add6: -1.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 as a negative term: -6, then add4 +5 +6: -6 +15=9.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 as a negative term: -2, then add5 +6=7.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

So, seems like -1 is the lowest.

But wait, is that actually allowed?

Because if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term, the entire expression is negative.

But in the original expression, the operations are in a straight line.

But in this case, if I group a subset of the expression, it becomes negative.

So, as per the problem statement, we can add parentheses to change the order of operations, but the expression is linear, so grouping part of it as negative.

So, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term, that's:

- (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6)= -13.

But then, how is that different?

Wait, in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

If I group all these as a negative term: -13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

But if I group a subset, like 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, then add6: -7 +6= -1.

So, to get -1, I have to group a subset of the expression as a negative term.

But is this allowed? The problem says we can add parentheses to change the order.

So, yes, as long as we add parentheses, we can change the order.

Therefore, -1 is a possible value.

Is that the minimum?

Wait, let me check if I can get lower.

Let me try grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 -3 +4 -5 +6:1 +2=3; 3 -3=0; 0 +4=4; 4 -5=-1; -1 +6=5.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6:1 +2=3; 3 +3=6; 6 -4=2; 2 +5=7; 7 -6=1.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term: -7 +6=-1.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 as a negative term: -2 +5 +6=9.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a negative term: -3 +3 -4 +5 +6=0 -4 +5 +6=1 +6=7.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term: -1 + ?

Wait, let me compute that.

1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6=1 +2=3; 3 +3=6; 6 -4=2; 2 +5=7; 7 -6=1.

So, grouping that as a negative term: -1.

Wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, so if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term: -1.

But that's not lower than -1.

Wait, in the previous case, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term: -7 +6=-1.

So, same as before.

Therefore, seems like -1 is the lowest.

Wait, but is that the case?

Wait, let me verify.

If I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, then add6: - (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= - (7) +6= -1.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

So, the only way to get lower is -1.

Therefore, is -1 the minimum?

Wait, but is that correct?

Wait, let me think of another grouping.

What if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term:3; subtract3:0; add4:4; subtract5:-1; add6:5.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term:3; subtract3:0; add4:4; subtract5:-1; add6:5.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term: -7 +6=-1.

Same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

So, seems like -1 is the lowest.

Wait, but let me think of another way.

Wait, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term, that's -13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

So, seems that -1 is the minimal value.

Wait, is that correct? Because in the expression, the operations are linear.

So, if I group a subset as a negative term, it's equivalent to changing the order of operations for that subset.

Therefore, is it allowed?

Yes, because the problem states that we can add parentheses to change the order of the terms.

Therefore, I think -1 is the minimal.

Wait, but hold on, 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6=13.

If I group some of them as a negative term, like 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6=13, then group a part of it as negative.

Wait, but if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term, then add6: -13.

But that's worse.

Alternatively, group a part as negative.

Wait, but in the previous case, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term: -7 +6=-1.

So, in this case, it's allowed.

But wait, in the original expression, the operations are in a straight line.

Therefore, grouping a subset as a negative is allowed.

So, in this case, the expression becomes:

- (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= -7 +6=-1.

Which is allowed.

Therefore, the minimal value is -1.

Wait, but let me make sure.

Alternatively, is there a way to make it even lower?

Wait, let me think.

Wait, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

So, seems that -1 is the lowest.

Wait, but hold on, the expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

If I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term, the entire expression is negative: -13.

Wait, but in this case, it's not allowed because the expression is in a straight line, and grouping a subset as a negative would mean changing the order of operations within that subset.

Wait, no, in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

If I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term, then the whole expression is negative.

But in reality, the entire expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

If I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term, that is, compute it as negative, then add6.

Wait, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have to evaluate the expression by inserting parentheses.

Each parentheses can change the order of operations.

So, in the original expression, the operations are:

1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6.

To get the minimal value, we need to maximize the negative impact.

So, the idea is to make as much of the expression negative as possible.

To do that, we can group positive numbers together and negative numbers together.

Wait, but in this case, since the expression has a mix, maybe group a positive number with negative numbers to make them negative.

Wait, but how?

Wait, for example, 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

If I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: - (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6)= -13.

But that's just the entire expression.

Alternatively, group some positive numbers and some negative numbers.

Wait, for example, group 1 +2 +3 -4 as a negative term: -2 +5 +6=9.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 as a negative term: -6 +5 +6=5.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term: -7 +6=-1.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

So, -1 is the minimal.

Therefore, seems like -1 is the minimum.

Wait, but let me check another way.

Suppose I group 1 +2 as a term:3.

Then, group 3 -4 +5 +6:3 -4=-1; -1 +5=4;4 +6=10.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 as a term:2; then group 5 +6=11; total:2 +11=13.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5=6; then group +6:6 +6=12.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6=13; then add nothing:13.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term:3; subtract 3:0; add4:4; subtract5:-1; add6:5.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6=1; then add6:7.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a term:13.

Therefore, seems like all these groupings result in either 13 or -1.

So, is -1 the minimal?

Wait, but in the earlier case, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, then adding6, gives -1.

Is that allowed?

Yes, because the expression is linear, but grouping a subset as a negative term is allowed.

Therefore, the minimal is -1.

Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, then add6, that is:

- (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= -7 +6=-1.

But actually, in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

So, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, that would change the expression to:

- (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= -7 +6=-1.

But in reality, the expression is:

1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

If I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, that's equivalent to:

- (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= - (7) +6= -1.

But in the original expression, 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

So, it's as if I have a sub-expression:1 +2 +3 -4 +5, which is 7, and then add6.

So, if I group the first five terms as a negative term, then add6, the entire expression is:

- (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= -7 +6=-1.

So, that's allowed, as it's just adding parentheses to change the order of operations.

Therefore, yes, that's a valid expression.

So, -1 is achievable.

But can I get lower?

Wait, let me try another grouping.

Suppose I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term: -7 +6=-1.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

So, it seems that -1 is the lowest.

Wait, but wait, let's test one more grouping.

What if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

So, no improvement.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term:3, subtract3:0, add4:4, subtract5:-1, add6:5.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term: -1 +.

Wait, no, let me compute that.

Group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term:1 +2=3;3 +3=6;6 -4=2;2 +5=7;7 -6=1.

So, group that as a negative term: -1.

Therefore, the expression becomes:

- (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6) +6= -1 +6=5.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term: the expression is - (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6) +6.

Wait, that equals - (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6) +6= - (1 +2 +3)=6; 6 -4=2;2 +5=7;7 -6=1;1 +6=7.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, let me do it step by step.

1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6=1 +2=3;3 +3=6;6 -4=2;2 +5=7;7 -6=1.

So, the group is 1.

Therefore, - (1) +6= -1 +6=5.

Wait, same as before.

Wait, no, in this case, - (1) +6=5.

Wait, but it's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, in the first case, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, then adding6: - (7) +6=-1.

In the second case, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term:1, then add6:5.

Wait, so two different groupings give different results.

So, it's important which terms are grouped.

So, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, then add6: -7 +6=-1.

If I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term, then add6: -1 +6=5.

So, different results.

Therefore, the key is which terms are grouped.

So, in order to get the minimal value, we need to group the positive terms and leave the negative term.

Wait, 1 +2 +3 -4 +5=7; then group that as negative: -7 +6=-1.

Yes, that's allowed.

So, that gives -1.

Alternatively, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term:1; then add6:7.

So, that gives7.

Therefore, the minimal is -1.

So, seems like -1 is the minimal.

But wait, is there a way to get even lower?

Wait, let me think.

Wait, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term:3; subtract3:0; add4:4; subtract5:-1; add6:5.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term: -7 +6=-1.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Therefore, seems like -1 is the minimal.

Wait, but let me confirm once more.

So, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, then add6: - (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= -7 +6=-1.

Yes, that's allowed.

So, the expression becomes:

- (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6= - (7) +6=-1.

Therefore, the minimal value is -1.

But wait, let me think, can I get -2?

Is that possible?

Let me see.

If I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

So, seems like -1 is the minimal.

Wait, but let me try another grouping.

Suppose I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: -13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6 as a negative term: same.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 as a term:3; subtract3:0; add4:4; subtract5:-1; add6:5.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term: -1 +.

Wait, no, let me compute.

Group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term:1 +2=3;3 +3=6;6 -4=2;2 +5=7;7 -6=1.

So, group that as a negative term: -1.

Then, add6: -1 +6=5.

Same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term: same.

Therefore, seems like -1 is the minimal.

Wait, but wait a second.

Wait, is that allowed? Because in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

If I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term, that would change the order of operations for that part.

So, the expression becomes:

- (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6) +6= - (1 +2 +3)=6;6 -4=2;2 +5=7;7 -6=1;1 +6=7.

Wait, but that's 7.

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term: that is, compute it as negative.

So, the expression is - (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6) +6= - (1 +2 +3)=6;6 -4=2;2 +5=7;7 -6=1;1 +6=7.

Wait, that's 7.

Wait, no, that's not the case.

Wait, hang on, in the expression, if I have:

- (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6) +6.

So, compute 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6= (1 +2 +3)=6;6 -4=2;2 +5=7;7 -6=1.

Then, -1 +6=5.

Wait, no, that's 5.

Wait, but that's different.

Wait, no, wait: in the expression:

- (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6) +6= - (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6)= -1; -1 +6=5.

Wait, so it's 5.

But that's not -1.

Wait, confusion arises.

Wait, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term: that is, compute that group as negative, then add6.

So, group is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6=1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6=1 +2=3;3 +3=6;6 -4=2;2 +5=7;7 -6=1.

So, group that as negative: -1.

Then, add6: -1 +6=5.

Wait, no, in the expression, it's:

- (group) +6.

So, if group is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6=1.

Then, - (group) +6= -1 +6=5.

Wait, so expression evaluates to5.

But in reality, the expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, if I group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6 as a negative term, in the original expression, which is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

So, the group is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 -6.

So, that group is 1 +2 +3=6;6 -4=2;2 +5=7;7 -6=1.

So, the group is1.

Therefore, the entire expression is:

- (1) +6= -1 +6=5.

So, it's 5.

But in the previous case, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, then add6: -7 +6=-1.

So, different results.

Therefore, the key is which terms are grouped.

Therefore, to get the minimal value, we need to group the positive terms and leave the negative term.

So, group 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term: which is1 +2 +3 -4 +5=7; then group as negative: -7 +6=-1.

So, that's allowed.

So, the minimal is-1.

But wait, in this case, grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 as a negative term, which is7, then add6: -1.

So, that's allowed.

Therefore, the minimal is-1.

But wait, let me confirm.

So, after all that, the maximum sum is 24. So, the expression 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 is equal to 21, which is less than 24.

Wait, but then 21 is less than 24, so 24 is bigger.

Wait, but in this case, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 is 21, which is less than 24.

But in the previous example, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +5 +6 as a negative term is 21.

Wait, so perhaps 24 is bigger.

Wait, but in the case of 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 +6 as a negative term, we have 21, which is less than 24.

But, if I take 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 +6 as a negative term, it's 21, but if I take 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 +6 as a negative term, so that's 21.

But if I take 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 +6 as a negative term, I get 21, but 24 is 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 +6 without any negative signs, so 21 is less than 24.

Wait, so in that case, 21 is less than 24, which is 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 +6, so 24 is greater.

Wait, but in the earlier case, 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 +6 as a negative term is 21, but if we have 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 +6 as a positive term, it's 21. So 24 is 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 +6 as positive, which is 21, or as negative, which is 21.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me clarify. The expression 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 is 21. So, if I change some of the plus signs to minus signs, I can change the value.

For example, if I change all the pluses to minuses, the expression becomes 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 -6. That's 1 -2 = -1; -1 -3 = -4; -4 -4 = -8; -8 -5 = -13; -13 -6 = -19.

So, the expression 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 -6 is -19, which is less than 21.

Alternatively, if I change some of the pluses to minuses, I can get a larger positive number.

For example, 1 + 2 - 3 -4 -5 -6: 1 + 2 = 3; 3 -3 =0; 0 -4 = -4; -4 -5 = -9; -9 -6 = -9.

Wait, so in all these cases, the maximum we can get is 21, which is the original expression.

Wait, but 21 is when all the pluses are kept, but if I change some of them to minuses, I can get higher numbers.

Wait, let's try.

Let me change one plus to minus.

For example, 1 + 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6: 1 +2=3; 3 -3=0; 0 -4= -4; -4 -5= -9; -9 -6= -9. So, -9.

Alternatively, 1 - 2 + 3 -4 -5 -6: 1 -2= -1; -1 +3=2; 2 -4= -2; -2 -5= -7; -7 -6= -13.

Alternatively, 1 - 2 -3 +4 +5 +6: 1 -2= -1; -1 -3= -4; -4 +4=0; 0 +5=5; 5 +6=11.

Alternatively, 1 - 2 -3 -4 +5 +6: 1 -2= -1; -1 -3= -4; -4 -4= -8; -8 +5= -3; -3 +6= 3.

Alternatively, 1 - 2 + 3 -4 -5 +6: same as above.

Alternatively, 1 - 2 -3 +4 -5 -6: same as above.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 - 3 -4 -5 -6: same as above.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 3 -4 -5 -6: 6 -4=2; 2 -5= -3; -3 -6= -9.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 3 +4 -5 -6: 10 -5=5; 5 -6= -1.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 -6: 15 -6=9.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 -6: same as above.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 -6: same as above.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 +6: 21.

So, the maximum I can get is 21.

Wait, so 21 is the maximum.

But 21 is all the pluses. So, if I change some pluses to minuses, is it possible to get a higher number?

Wait, 21 is the maximum, so changing any plus to minus would decrease the total.

Wait, for example, 1 + 2 - 3 - 4 -5 -6= -9.

Alternatively, 1 - 2 + 3 + 4 +5 +6= 1 -2= -1; -1 +3=2; 2 +4=6; 6 +5=11; 11 +6=17.

Wait, 17 is less than 21.

Similarly, 1 - 2 - 3 +4 +5 +6= same as above.

Alternatively, 1 - 2 -3 -4 -5 +6: same as above.

Alternatively, 1 - 2 -3 -4 -5 -6= -19.

So, 21 is the maximum.

Wait, but if I change the pluses to minuses, the total can only be smaller or equal to 21.

Wait, for example, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +5 -6= 15 -6=9.

Wait, so 9 is less than 21.

So, the maximum is 21.

But is there any way to get more than 21?

No, because 21 is the maximum.

Wait, but in the example where I changed all the pluses to minuses, I got -19, which is worse.

So, 21 is the maximum.

Therefore, the maximum value for the expression 1 2 3 4 5 6, where each operator is either + or -, is 21.

But wait, in the earlier example, 1 - 2 - 3 + 4 + 5 +6=9, but that's less than 21.

Wait, so is 21 the maximum?

Alternatively, is there a way to have a higher number?

Wait, if I have 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +5 -6=9.

Wait, but how to get 21.

Wait, 21 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +5 -6.

But 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +5 -6=1+2=3; 3+3=6; 6+4=10; 10+5=15; 15-6=9. Wait, that's 9.

Wait, that's not 21.

Wait, no, that was 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +5 -6= 1+2=3; 3+3=6; 6+4=10; 10+5=15; 15-6=9.

Wait, so 9.

Wait, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +5 -6=9.

Wait, but 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 -6=9.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 -6: same as above.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 3 +4 -5 +6: 1+2=3; 3+3=6; 6+4=10; 10-5=5; 5 +6=11.

Wait, that's 11.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 - 3 +4 +5 -6: same as above.

Wait, 1 + 2 -3 +4 +5 -6= 3 -3=0; 0 +4=4; 4 +5=9; 9 -6=3.

So, 3.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 3 -4 -5 +6= same as above.

Wait, 1 + 2 +3=6; 6 -4=2; 2 -5= -3; -3 +6=3.

So, 3.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 -3 +4 +5 -6: same as above.

Alternatively, 1 - 2 +3 -4 +5 -6: same as above.

Alternatively, 1 - 2 - 3 +4 +5 -6: same as above.

Alternatively, 1 - 2 - 3 -4 +5 +6: same as above.

Alternatively, 1 - 2 -3 -4 -5 +6: same as above.

Wait, so in all these cases, the maximum I can get is 21.

Wait, but 21 is when all the pluses are present.

So, in that case, 21 is the maximum.

Therefore, the maximum value of the expression is 21.

But in that case, all the operators are pluses.

Wait, but in the initial problem, the expression is 1 2 3 4 5 6, where each operator is either + or -, so to get 21, you need all pluses.

But if I change any of the pluses to -, can I get higher than 21?

Wait, no, because changing a plus to minus would decrease the value.

Wait, for example, if I change the first operator + to -, then the expression becomes 1 - 2 + 3 + 4 +5 +6.

Which is 1 -2= -1; -1 +3=2; 2 +4=6; 6 +5=11; 11 +6=17.

So, 17, which is less than 21.

Similarly, if I change the second operator + to -, 1 + 2 - 3 +4 +5 +6.

1 +2=3; 3 -3=0; 0 +4=4; 4 +5=9; 9 +6=15.

So, 15, which is less than 21.

Alternatively, changing third operator + to -, 1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5 +6= 6 -4=2; 2 +5=7; 7 +6=13.

Wait, 13.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 -5 +6=9.

Wait, 9.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 3 +4 +5 -6=9.

So, 9.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 - 3 -4 +5 +6= 3 -4= -1; -1 +5=4; 4 +6=10.

Wait, 10.

Alternatively, 1 - 2 + 3 -4 -5 +6= same as above.

So, 1 - 2= -1; -1 +3=2; 2 -4= -2; -2 -5= -7; -7 +6= -1.

Wait, so that's -1.

Hmm, so in this way, changing any single operator from + to - will result in a smaller number, since all the pluses are contributing to a larger total.

Therefore, the maximum is 21, when all operators are pluses.

Therefore, 21 is the maximum value.

Therefore, the maximum possible value is 21.

But wait, is that the maximum?

Wait, but in the earlier example, 3 + 4 - 5 +6= 8.

Wait, 3 +4=7; 7 -5=2; 2 +6=8.

Which is less than 21.

Similarly, 1 + 2 + 3 -4 -5 +6=1 +2=3; 3 +3=6; 6 -4=2; 2 -5= -3; -3 +6=3.

So, 3.

But in the case of 1 - 2 + 3 +4 +5 -6=1 -2= -1; -1 +3=2; 2 +4=6; 6 +5=11; 11 -6=5.

Wait, 5.

So, 21 is the maximum.

Wait, but 21 is all pluses, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +5 +6=21.

Alternatively, 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 +5 -6= same as above.

Wait, 1 - 2= -1; -1 +3=2; 2 -4= -2; -2 +5=3; 3 -6= -3.

Wait, so that's -3, which is less than 21.

Therefore, 21 is the maximum value.

Therefore, the maximum value of the expression 1 2 3 4 5 6 with operators + or - is 21.

Therefore, the answer is 21.

Wait, but wait, in this case, all operators are pluses, making it 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +5 +6=21.

But in the earlier examples, when we changed some operators to -, we got lower values, but I can't get higher than 21.

Wait, but in the other approach, I tried changing only some operators to -, but I didn't get a higher value.

Wait, so maybe 21 is the maximum.

Wait, but in the initial single operator change, I tried 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 +5 -6= -3, which is less than 21.

Similarly, 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 +5 +6= -3.

So, 21 is the maximum.

Therefore, the maximum value is 21.

Thus, the answer is 21.

**Final Answer**
The maximum value of the expression \(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6\) with operators + or - is \boxed{21}.
</think>

To find the maximum value of the expression \(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6\) where each operator is either + or -, we need to consider all possible combinations of these operators. The goal is to maximize the result by assigning '+' or '-' operators.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The expression is 1 2 3 4 5 6, which has 5 operators between the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each operator can be either '+' or '-'.

2. **Maximizing the Expression**: To maximize the result, we need to consider the effect of each operator. Adding 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in such a way that each positive number is added to the next number, and negative numbers are subtracted.

3. **Example Calculations**:
   - Changing all operators to '+': \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\)
   - Changing some operators to '-': For example, changing + to - in 1 + 2 - 3 + 4 + 5 - 6 results in -3, which is less than 21.

4. **Conclusion**: The maximum value is achieved when all operators are '+', resulting in 21.

Thus, the maximum value of the expression \(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6\) is \(\boxed{21}\).
