Question:
Evaluate
\[\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4).\]

Correct Answer:
From the angle addition and subtraction formulas,
\begin{align*}
\sin (x + y) &= \sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y, \\
\sin (x - y) &= \sin x \cos y - \cos x \sin y,
\end{align*}so
\begin{align*}
\sin (x + y) \sin (x - y) &= (\sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y)(\sin x \cos y - \cos x \sin y) \\
&= \sin^2 x \cos^2 y + \sin x \cos x \sin y \cos y - \sin x \cos x \sin y \cos y - \cos^2 x \sin^2 y \\
&= \sin^2 x (1 - \sin^2 y) - (1 - \sin^2 x) \sin^2 y \\
&= \sin^2 x - \sin^2 x \sin^2 y - \sin^2 y + \sin^2 x \sin^2 y \\
&= \sin^2 x - \sin^2 y.
\end{align*}Taking $x = \arcsin 0.5$ and $y = \arcsin 0.4,$ we get
\begin{align*}
\sin (\arcsin 0.5 + \arcsin 0.4) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4) &= \sin^2 (\arcsin 0.5) - \sin^2 (\arcsin 0.4) \\
&= 0.5^2 - 0.4^2 \\
&= 0.09 = \boxed{\frac{9}{100}}.
\end{align*}

Gold:

Wrong Prediction:

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this trigonometric expression to evaluate: \[\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4).\] Hmm, that's a bit intimidating at first glance, but let's break it down step by step. I remember there are some trigonometric identities that might help here, like the sine of sum and difference formulas. Maybe I can apply those.

First, let me recall the sine addition and subtraction formulas. The sine of a sum is \(\sin(a + b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b\), and the sine of a difference is \(\sin(a - b) = \sin a \cos b - \cos a \sin b\). So, if I let \(a = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(b = \arcsin 0.5\), then I can express both parts of the original expression using these identities.

So, the first part is \(\sin(a + b)\), which using the addition formula becomes \(\sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b\). The second part is \(\sin(a - b)\), which using the subtraction formula becomes \(\sin a \cos b - \cos a \sin b\). If I multiply these two expressions together, let's write it out:

\[
[\sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b] \cdot [\sin a \cos b - \cos a \sin b]
\]

Hmm, that looks like a difference of squares setup. So, if I let \(X = \sin a \cos b\) and \(Y = \cos a \sin b\), then the expression becomes \((X + Y)(X - Y)\), which equals \(X^2 - Y^2\). Let me compute that:

First, compute \(X^2\):
\[
X^2 = (\sin a \cos b)^2 = \sin^2 a \cos^2 b
\]

Next, compute \(Y^2\):
\[
Y^2 = (\cos a \sin b)^2 = \cos^2 a \sin^2 b
\]

So, putting it all together:
\[
\sin^2 a \cos^2 b - \cos^2 a \sin^2 b
\]

Alright, so our original expression simplifies to \(\sin^2 a \cos^2 b - \cos^2 a \sin^2 b\). Now, let's think about what each of these terms represents. Remember that \(a = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(b = \arcsin 0.5\). So, \(\sin a = 0.4\) and \(\sin b = 0.5\). That might help.

But to find \(\cos a\) and \(\cos b\), we can use the Pythagorean identity: \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta}\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are arcsin values, they are within the range \([- \pi/2, \pi/2]\), so the cosine will be non-negative. Therefore:

For \(a = \arcsin 0.4\):
\[
\cos a = \sqrt{1 - (0.4)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
Wait, 84 is 4*21, so sqrt(84) is 2*sqrt(21). So, yeah, \(\cos a = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, for \(b = \arcsin 0.5\):
\[
\cos b = \sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

So, now we can compute each term.

First, compute \(\sin^2 a \cos^2 b\):
\[
\sin^2 a = (0.4)^2 = 0.16
\]
\[
\cos^2 b = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}
\]
So, \(\sin^2 a \cos^2 b = 0.16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 0.16 \times 0.75 = 0.12\)

Next, compute \(\cos^2 a \sin^2 b\):
\[
\cos^2 a = \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{21}{25}
\]
\[
\sin^2 b = (0.5)^2 = 0.25
\]
So, \(\cos^2 a \sin^2 b = \frac{21}{25} \times 0.25 = \frac{21}{25} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{21}{100} = 0.21\)

Now, subtracting the two:
\[
0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09
\]

Hmm, so the original expression simplifies down to \(-0.09\). But let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me check each step again.

Starting with \(a = \arcsin 0.4\), so \(\sin a = 0.4\), and \(\cos a = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84}\). Wait, is 0.84 equal to 21/25? Let me check: 21 divided by 25 is 0.84, yes. So, that's correct.

Then, for \(b = \arcsin 0.5\), \(\sin b = 0.5\), so \(\cos b = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75}\), which is \(\sqrt{3}/2\), correct.

Calculating \(\sin^2 a \cos^2 b\): 0.16 * 0.75. Let's compute 0.16 * 0.75:

0.16 * 0.75 = (16/100) * (75/100) = (16 * 75) / 10000 = 1200 / 10000 = 0.12, correct.

Similarly, \(\cos^2 a \sin^2 b = (21/25) * (1/4)\). That is 21/25 * 1/4 = 21/100 = 0.21, correct.

So, 0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09. So, that's -9/100, which is -0.09. So, the expression simplifies to -0.09.

But wait, is that possible? Because sine of something is negative? Let me think about the original expression.

We have two sine terms multiplied together. Let me consider the angles involved. \(a = \arcsin 0.4\) is an angle in the first quadrant, since arcsin returns values between -π/2 and π/2, but 0.4 is positive, so it's between 0 and π/2. Similarly, \(b = \arcsin 0.5\) is also in the first quadrant. So, \(a + b\) is the sum of two angles in the first quadrant, so \(a + b\) is between 0 and π. Similarly, \(a - b\) is between 0 and π/2, since arcsin 0.4 is less than arcsin 0.5.

So, \(\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5\) could be between 0 and π, but depending on the exact values, the sine could be positive or negative. Similarly, \(\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4\) is between 0 and π/2, so sine is positive.

But if the final result is negative, that suggests that the product is negative. But let's verify. Let me compute the numerical values:

First, compute \(a = \arcsin 0.4\). Let me find that in radians.

I know that \(\arcsin 0.4\) is approximately 0.4115 radians. Similarly, \(\arcsin 0.5\) is π/6, approximately 0.5236 radians.

So, \(a + b ≈ 0.4115 + 0.5236 ≈ 0.9351\) radians. The sine of that is positive since it's in the first quadrant. So, \(\sin(a + b)\) is positive.

On the other hand, \(a - b ≈ 0.4115 - 0.5236 ≈ -0.1121\) radians. The sine of a negative angle is negative, so \(\sin(a - b)\) is negative.

Therefore, the product is positive times negative, which is negative. So, the result is negative, which is consistent with our earlier calculation of -0.09. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of another identity. Wait, another approach: use the formula for \(\sin(A + B)\) and \(\sin(A - B)\) but perhaps relate it differently.

Alternatively, let me consider using the formula for sine of sum and difference to express the entire expression as a product of sines and cosines, but we did that already.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of \(\sin(\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5)\) as \(\sin(\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5)\), which is just another way of writing \(\sin(\arcsin x)\), but that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, another thought: maybe use the formula for \(\sin(A + B)\) and \(\sin(A - B)\) and then multiply them together, which is what we did. Alternatively, perhaps I can combine the two sine terms into a single sine or cosine function, but I don't think that's simpler.

Wait, but in our initial approach, we ended up with -0.09, which is -9/100. But let me verify the steps again.

We had:

- \(\sin(a + b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b\)
- \(\sin(a - b) = \sin a \cos b - \cos a \sin b\)
- Multiplying these gives \(\sin^2 a \cos^2 b - \cos^2 a \sin^2 b\)
- Then, substituting the values, we got -0.09

But let me compute each step numerically:

First, \(\sin a = 0.4\), \(\cos a = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} ≈ 0.9165\)

\(\sin b = 0.5\), \(\cos b = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} ≈ 0.8660\)

Compute \(\sin^2 a = 0.16\), \(\cos^2 b = 0.75\), so \(\sin^2 a \cos^2 b = 0.16 * 0.75 = 0.12\)

Compute \(\cos^2 a = 0.84\), \(\sin^2 b = 0.25\), so \(\cos^2 a \sin^2 b = 0.84 * 0.25 = 0.21\)

Subtracting: 0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09

So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the product is indeed -0.09.

But just to make sure, perhaps I can compute the numerical value of the original expression directly.

Compute each sine term:

First, compute \(\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5\). Let's denote this as angle C.

Compute \(\arcsin 0.4 ≈ 0.4115\) radians, \(\arcsin 0.5 = \pi/6 ≈ 0.5236\) radians. So, angle C ≈ 0.4115 + 0.5236 ≈ 0.9351 radians.

Compute \(\sin(0.9351)\). Since 0.9351 radians is approximately 53.5 degrees, and \(\sin(0.9351) ≈ 0.8058\).

Next, compute \(\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4 ≈ 0.5236 - 0.4115 ≈ 0.1121\) radians.

Compute \(\sin(0.1121)\). 0.1121 radians is approximately 6.42 degrees, and \(\sin(0.1121) ≈ 0.1118\).

Then, multiply these two results: 0.8058 * 0.1118 ≈ 0.0904.

But wait, that's positive. But earlier we got -0.09. Hmm, this discrepancy is concerning.

Wait, but hold on, perhaps my approximate calculations are off because the exact value is -0.09, but my approximate calculation gave me 0.09. That suggests that maybe I did something wrong in the initial approach.

Wait, no, let's think again. The product is \(\sin(\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) * \sin(\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\). But the first sine is positive, and the second sine is positive because the angle is positive, but in reality, the angle \(\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4\) is positive, but the angle \(\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5\) is also positive. However, in the initial approach, I got a negative value, but when I compute numerically, I get positive 0.09. So, which one is correct?

Wait, let's compute \(\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5\). If both arcsin are positive, their sum is positive. So, \(\sin(\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5)\) is positive. Then, \(\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4\) is positive as well, because 0.5 > 0.4, so the difference is positive. Therefore, both sines are positive, so their product should be positive.

But earlier, using the algebraic approach, we got a negative value. So, that suggests that an error was made in the algebraic manipulation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me go back to the initial steps.

We have:

\[
\sin(a + b) \cdot \sin(a - b) = [\sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b] \cdot [\sin a \cos b - \cos a \sin b] = \sin^2 a \cos^2 b - \cos^2 a \sin^2 b
\]

But wait, is that correct? Because the product of (X + Y)(X - Y) is X^2 - Y^2, so yes, that is correct.

Therefore, substituting the values:

\[
\sin^2 a \cos^2 b - \cos^2 a \sin^2 b
\]

But is this equal to \(\sin^2 a \cos^2 b - \cos^2 a \sin^2 b\), which is what we have.

But when I compute this, I get -0.09, but when I compute numerically, I get a positive 0.09.

So, this suggests that either the algebraic manipulation is incorrect, or the numerical computation is incorrect.

Wait, let me compute the numerical value of \(\sin(a + b)\) and \(\sin(a - b)\) separately.

Compute \(\arcsin 0.4 ≈ 0.4115\), \(\arcsin 0.5 = 0.5236\).

Compute \(a + b ≈ 0.4115 + 0.5236 ≈ 0.9351\) radians.

Compute \(\sin(0.9351)\). Let me compute this more accurately. Using calculator, \(\sin(0.9351)\) is approximately 0.8058.

Compute \(a - b ≈ 0.4115 - 0.5236 ≈ -0.1121\) radians.

Compute \(\sin(-0.1121)\) is approximately -0.1118.

Therefore, the product is 0.8058 * (-0.1118) ≈ -0.0904.

Wait, that's approximately -0.09, which matches the algebraic result.

But when I computed \(\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4\) as 0.1121, but in reality, since \(\arcsin 0.4 ≈ 0.4115\), and \(\arcsin 0.5 = 0.5236\), so \(0.5236 - 0.4115 = 0.1121\). So, the angle is positive, but it's still small, so \(\sin(0.1121) ≈ 0.1118\), which is positive. So, the first sine is positive, the second sine is positive, so the product should be positive. But according to the algebraic approach, it's negative.

Wait, that's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebraic approach. Let's go back.

Wait, the original expression is:

\[
\sin (a + b) \cdot \sin (a - b)
\]

But I used the identity \(\sin(a + b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b\) and \(\sin(a - b) = \sin a \cos b - \cos a \sin b\), so multiplying them gives:

\[
(\sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b)(\sin a \cos b - \cos a \sin b) = (\sin a \cos b)^2 - (\cos a \sin b)^2 = \sin^2 a \cos^2 b - \cos^2 a \sin^2 b
\]

So, that seems correct. Then, substituting the known values:

\[
\sin^2 a = (0.4)^2 = 0.16
\]
\[
\cos^2 b = (\sqrt{3}/2)^2 = 0.75
\]
\[
\cos^2 a = (21/25) = 0.84
\]
\[
\sin^2 b = (0.5)^2 = 0.25
\]

So, \(\sin^2 a \cos^2 b = 0.16 * 0.75 = 0.12\), and \(\cos^2 a \sin^2 b = 0.84 * 0.25 = 0.21\). So, the expression is 0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09.

But when I compute the original expression numerically, it's approximately -0.09, which is consistent. So, why did I get a positive 0.09 when I computed it the other way?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the numerical value. Let me compute it again.

Compute \(\arcsin 0.4 ≈ 0.4115\) radians.

Compute \(\arcsin 0.5 = 0.5236\) radians.

Compute \(a + b ≈ 0.4115 + 0.5236 ≈ 0.9351\) radians.

Compute \(\sin(0.9351)\): let me use calculator for more precise value.

Using calculator, \(\sin(0.9351)\) ≈ 0.8058.

Compute \(a - b ≈ 0.4115 - 0.5236 ≈ -0.1121\) radians.

Compute \(\sin(-0.1121)\): \(\sin(-x) = -\sin x\), so it's approximately -0.1118.

Multiply 0.8058 * (-0.1118) ≈ -0.0904.

So, approximately -0.09, which is the same as our algebraic result.

Therefore, my initial numerical calculation was incorrect because I thought \(\sin(a - b)\) was positive, but actually, \(a - b\) is negative, so \(\sin(a - b)\) is negative.

Therefore, the product is indeed negative, approximately -0.09.

But the question asks for the exact value, not a decimal approximation.

Earlier, we had:

\[
\sin^2 a \cos^2 b - \cos^2 a \sin^2 b = 0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09
\]

But let me express this in fractions instead of decimals to see if it simplifies to a fraction.

Compute \(\sin^2 a \cos^2 b\):

\(\sin^2 a = (0.4)^2 = (2/5)^2 = 4/25\)

\(\cos^2 b = ( \sqrt{3}/2 )^2 = 3/4\)

So, \(\sin^2 a \cos^2 b = (4/25)(3/4) = (12)/100 = 3/25\)

Similarly, \(\cos^2 a = (21/25)\), \(\sin^2 b = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\)

So, \(\cos^2 a \sin^2 b = (21/25)(1/4) = 21/100\)

Therefore, subtracting:

\(3/25 - 21/100\)

Convert to common denominator:

3/25 = 12/100

So, 12/100 - 21/100 = (-9)/100

So, the exact value is -9/100, which is -0.09.

Therefore, the exact value is -9/100.

So, to confirm, the original expression simplifies to -9/100.

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{-\dfrac{9}{100}}\).

Wait, but hold on, just to be sure, perhaps I can think of another identity or a way to verify this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for \(\sin(A + B) \sin(A - B)\).

Wait, I know that \(\sin(A + B) \sin(A - B) = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B\). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me check:

Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) \sin(A - B)\), let me expand both terms:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B
\]
Multiplying them:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B) = (\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]
Which is:
\[
\sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B
\]
But I also know that \(\sin^2 A - \sin^2 B = \sin(A + B)\sin(A - B)\), so yes, that's another identity.

So, indeed, \(\sin(A + B)\sin(A - B) = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B\).

Therefore, in our case, \(\sin(a + b)\sin(a - b) = \sin^2 a - \sin^2 b\).

Given that, let's compute \(\sin^2 a - \sin^2 b\):

We have \(\sin a = 0.4\), so \(\sin^2 a = 0.16\)

\(\sin b = 0.5\), so \(\sin^2 b = 0.25\)

Therefore, \(\sin^2 a - \sin^2 b = 0.16 - 0.25 = -0.09 = -9/100\).

So, that's another way to see it, and it confirms the result.

Therefore, the exact value is indeed -9/100.

Wait, but just to be 100% sure, let me compute \(\sin^2 a - \sin^2 b\) using fractions:

\(\sin a = 2/5\), so \(\sin^2 a = 4/25\)

\(\sin b = 1/2\), so \(\sin^2 b = 1/4\)

Therefore, \(\sin^2 a - \sin^2 b = 4/25 - 1/4\)

Convert to common denominator, which is 100:

4/25 = 16/100

1/4 = 25/100

So, 16/100 - 25/100 = -9/100.

Therefore, -9/100 is the exact value.

So, that's consistent.

Therefore, the answer is \(-\dfrac{9}{100}\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-\dfrac{9}{100}}
</think>

To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we can use trigonometric identities and properties of inverse trigonometric functions.

First, let \(a = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(b = \arcsin 0.5\). We need to evaluate the expression:

\[
\sin (a + b) \cdot \sin (a - b)
\]

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we know:

\[
\sin (a + b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b
\]
\[
\sin (a - b) = \sin a \cos b - \cos a \sin b
\]

Multiplying these two expressions together, we get:

\[
[\sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b] \cdot [\sin a \cos b - \cos a \sin b] = (\sin a \cos b)^2 - (\cos a \sin b)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\sin^2 a \cos^2 b - \cos^2 a \sin^2 b
\]

We know the values of \(\sin a\), \(\cos a\), \(\sin b\), and \(\cos b\):

- \(\sin a = 0.4\), so \(\cos a = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\)
- \(\sin b = 0.5\), so \(\cos b = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\)

Calculating each term:

- \(\sin^2 a = (0.4)^2 = 0.16\)
- \(\cos^2 b = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\)
- \(\cos^2 a = \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{21}{25}\)
- \(\sin^2 b = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\)

Substituting these values into the expression:

\[
\sin^2 a \cos^2 b - \cos^2 a \sin^2 b = 0.16 \cdot \frac{3}{4} - \frac{21}{25} \cdot 0.25
\]

Calculating each part:

- \(0.16 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = 0.12\)
- \(\frac{21}{25} \cdot 0.25 = 0.21\)

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09
\]

Expressing this as a fraction, we get:

\[
-0.09 = -\frac{9}{100}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{-\dfrac{9}{100}}
\]
