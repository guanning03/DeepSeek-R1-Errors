Question:
Let $\mathbf{a},$ $\mathbf{b},$ $\mathbf{c}$ be three vectors such that
\[\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.\]Compute $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}).$

Correct Answer:
Expanding, we get
\begin{align*}
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) &= 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} \\
&= 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{0} \\
&= 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ - 7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} - 2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ - 7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \\
&= \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}.
\end{align*}

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem here with three vectors a, b, and c. The question gives me their cross products with each other: a × b is (6, -7, 3), a × c is (4, 7, 2), and b × c is (1, -7, 18). I need to compute (2b - a) × (3c + a). Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that cross products have some distributive properties. So maybe I can expand the expression using the distributive property of cross products. Let me recall that (u + v) × (w + x) = u × w + u × x + v × w + v × x. So applying that here, let's see.

Let me denote u = 2b and v = -a, and w = 3c and x = a. So, expanding (2b - a) × (3c + a) should be:

(2b) × (3c) + (2b) × a + (-a) × (3c) + (-a) × a.

Simplify each term one by one.

First term: (2b) × (3c). I know that scalar multiplication can be moved outside, so this is 2*3*(b × c). Since b × c is given as (1, -7, 18), this would be 6*(1, -7, 18) = (6, -42, 108).

Second term: (2b) × a. Again, scalar can be moved outside: 2*(b × a). Hmm, I remember that b × a = - (a × b). So, that's 2*(- (a × b)) = -2*(6, -7, 3) = (-12, 14, -6).

Third term: (-a) × (3c). Let me see, scalar can be moved outside: (-1)*(a × 3c). Wait, 3c is 3 times c, so a × 3c is 3*(a × c) = 3*(4, 7, 2) = (12, 21, 6). Then, multiplied by -1, that becomes (-12, -21, -6).

Fourth term: (-a) × a. Hmm, cross product of a vector with itself is zero. So, this term is zero.

Putting it all together:

First term: (6, -42, 108)

Second term: (-12, 14, -6)

Third term: (-12, -21, -6)

Fourth term: 0

Now, adding these together. Let's do component-wise.

First component: 6 + (-12) + (-12) + 0 = 6 - 12 -12 = 6 -24 = -18

Second component: -42 + 14 + (-21) + 0 = -42 +14 -21 = (-42 +14) = -28; -28 -21 = -49

Third component: 108 + (-6) + (-6) + 0 = 108 -6 -6 = 108 -12 = 96

So, the result is (-18, -49, 96). Wait, let me double-check that.

Wait, first term is (6, -42, 108). Second term is (-12, 14, -6). Third term is (-12, -21, -6). Let me add them.

First component: 6 - 12 -12. 6 -12 is -6, minus 12 is -18. That's correct.

Second component: -42 +14 is -28, then minus 21 is -49. Correct.

Third component: 108 -6 is 102, minus 6 is 96. Correct.

So yeah, that seems right.

But let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I used the distributive property, moved the scalars outside, recognized that b × a is just negative of a × b, and then each cross product was computed step by step. Then I added them up component-wise.

Is there a chance I messed up the scalar multiplication or the cross product of b × a? Let me verify.

Given that a × b is (6, -7, 3). So b × a should be - (a × b) which is (-6, 7, -3). Then 2*(b × a) is 2*(-6,7,-3) = (-12,14,-6). That's correct.

Similarly, a × c is (4,7,2). So (-a) × c is - (a × c) which is (-4, -7, -2). Then times 3, so 3*(-4, -7, -2) = (-12, -21, -6). Correct.

Wait, hold on, in the third term, I think I made a miscalculation. Let me see:

Third term is (-a) × (3c). So, as per the cross product properties, that's equal to 3*(-a × c). So, if a × c is (4,7,2), then -a × c is (-4, -7, -2). Then, multiplying by 3, we get (-12, -21, -6). Yes, that's correct.

So, yes, that part is correct.

And the first term was 6*(1, -7, 18) which is (6, -42, 108). Correct.

Second term: 2*(b × a) which is 2*(- (a × b)) = 2*(-6,7,-3) = (-12,14,-6). Correct.

Third term: 3*(-a × c) = 3*(-4, -7, -2) = (-12, -21, -6). Correct.

So, overall, the addition was:

(6, -42, 108) + (-12,14,-6) + (-12,-21,-6) + (0) =

Compute each component:

First: 6 -12 -12 = -18

Second: -42 +14 -21 = (-42 +14)= -28; -28 -21= -49

Third: 108 -6 -6 = 108 -12 =96

So the final vector is (-18, -49, 96). Hmm, is that correct? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the cross product in terms of determinants or properties. Wait, but I think the initial method is solid.

Alternatively, just to be thorough, let me write down each cross product step again.

First, (2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b×3c + 2b×a -a×3c -a×a.

Which is 6b×c + 2(b×a) -3(a×c) -0.

So, substituting the given cross products:

6*(1, -7, 18) + 2*(- (a×b)) -3*(4,7,2).

Compute each term:

6*(1, -7, 18) = (6, -42, 108)

2*(- (a×b)) = 2*(-6,7,-3) = (-12,14,-6)

-3*(4,7,2) = (-12,-21,-6)

Add them up:

First component: 6 -12 -12 = -18

Second component: -42 +14 -21 = -49

Third component:108 -6 -6=96

Same result. So that seems consistent.

So, is there any other way to verify? Maybe compute the cross products differently, but I think this is correct.

Alternatively, if I try to find a × b, but I don't have that, unless I can compute it.

Wait, do I have enough information to compute a × b? Hmm, let me think.

We know that a × c and b × c are given, and a × b is given.

Wait, perhaps not, but maybe we can get a × b from other relations.

Wait, but I don't have the cross products with a or b in another way, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the scalar triple product or something else, but I think the method I used is correct.

Alternatively, think about the properties of cross products.

But, perhaps not necessary, since the expansion method worked.

So, I think I can be confident that the result is (-18, -49, 96). So, boxed, it's \boxed{(-18, -49, 96)}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{(-18, -49, 96)}
</think>

To compute \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we use the distributive property of cross products. Expanding the expression, we get:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}
\]

Simplifying each term:

1. \((2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 (1, -7, 18) = (6, -42, 108)\)
2. \((2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = 2 (- (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})) = 2 (-6, 7, -3) = (-12, 14, -6)\)
3. \((- \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = -3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 (4, 7, 2) = (-12, -21, -6)\)
4. \((- \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 0\)

Adding these results component-wise:

- First component: \(6 - 12 - 12 = -18\)
- Second component: \(-42 + 14 - 21 = -49\)
- Third component: \(108 - 6 - 6 = 96\)

Thus, the final result is:

\[
\boxed{(-18, -49, 96)}
\]
