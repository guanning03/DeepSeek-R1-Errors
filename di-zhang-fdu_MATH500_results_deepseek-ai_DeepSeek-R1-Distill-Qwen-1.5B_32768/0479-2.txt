Question:
The graphs of $x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72 = 0$ and $x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 16y - 46 = 0$ intersect at four points.  Compute the sum of the distances from these four points to the point $(-3,2).$

Correct Answer:
Adding the equations, we get
\[2x^2 + 12x - 8y + 26 = 0,\]or $x^2 + 6x - 4y + 13 = 0.$  We can write this equation as
\[(x + 3)^2 = 4(y - 1).\]This is the equation of the parabola with focus $(-3,2)$ and directrix $y = 0.$

[asy]
unitsize(1 cm);

real parab (real x) {
  return ((x^2 + 6*x + 13)/4);
}

pair P = (-0.5,parab(-0.5));

draw(graph(parab,-6,0));
draw((-3,2)--P--(-0.5,0));

dot((-3,2));
dot((-3,1));
draw((-6,0)--(0,0),dashed);
[/asy]

By definition of a parabola, for any point $P$ on the parabola, the distance from $P$ to the focus is equal to the distance from $P$ to the $y$-axis, which is the $y$-coordinate of the point.

Subtracting the given equations, we get $2y^2 - 40y + 118 = 0,$ or $y^2 - 20y + 59 = 0.$  Let $y_1$ and $y_2$ be the roots of this quadratic.  Then the $y$-coordinate of each point of intersection must be either $y_1$ or $y_2.$

Note that the equation $x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24xy + 72 = 0$ represents a circle, so it intersects the line $y = y_1$ in at most two points, and the line $y = y_2$ is at most two points.  Therefore, the $y$-coordinates of the four points of intersection must be $y_1,$ $y_1,$ $y_2,$ $y_2,$ and their sum is $2y_1 + 2y_2.$

By Vieta's formulas, $y_1 + y_2 = 20,$ so $2y_1 + 2y_2 = \boxed{40}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to solve this problem where two graphs intersect at four points, and I have to find the sum of the distances from these four points to the point (-3, 2). The equations given are:

1. \( x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72 = 0 \)
2. \( x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 16y - 46 = 0 \)

Hmm, both equations are quadratic, so they're likely circles or hyperbolas. Let me see. The first equation has both \(x^2\) and \(y^2\) with positive coefficients, so maybe a circle. The second equation also has \(x^2\) and \(y^2\) with opposite signs, so that's a hyperbola. So, one is a circle and the other is a hyperbola, and they intersect at four points. Got it.

The question is asking for the sum of the distances from these four points to (-3, 2). That seems a bit tricky, but maybe there's a clever way to do it without finding each point individually. Let me think.

First, maybe I should rewrite both equations in standard form by completing the squares. That might help me understand their positions and maybe find a relationship between them.

Starting with the first equation: \( x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72 = 0 \).

Let me group the x terms and y terms:

\( (x^2 + 6x) + (y^2 - 24y) = -72 \)

Now, complete the square for the x terms and y terms.

For x: \( x^2 + 6x \), take half of 6, which is 3, square it, 9. So, add and subtract 9.

For y: \( y^2 - 24y \), take half of -24, which is -12, square it, 144. So, add and subtract 144.

So, the equation becomes:

\( (x^2 + 6x + 9 - 9) + (y^2 - 24y + 144 - 144) = -72 \)

Simplify:

\( (x + 3)^2 - 9 + (y - 12)^2 - 144 = -72 \)

Combine constants:

\( (x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 - 153 = -72 \)

Bring the -153 to the right:

\( (x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 = 81 \)

Okay, so the first circle has center at (-3, 12) and radius 9.

Now, let's work on the second equation: \( x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 16y - 46 = 0 \).

Hmm, this is a hyperbola. Let me rearrange it to standard form. Let's group x terms and y terms:

\( (x^2 + 6x) - (y^2 - 16y) = 46 \)

Wait, because it's minus \( y^2 \), so it's minus (y^2 -16y). Okay, so let me complete the squares.

For x: \( x^2 + 6x \). Half of 6 is 3, square is 9. Add and subtract 9.

For y: \( -(y^2 - 16y) \). Let me factor out the negative first: \( -[(y^2 - 16y + 64) - 64] \). So, that's \( -[(y - 8)^2 - 64] \). Distribute the negative: \( -(y - 8)^2 + 64 \).

So, putting it all together:

\( (x^2 + 6x + 9 - 9) - (y^2 - 16y + 64 - 64) = 46 \)

Wait, let me make sure. The original equation is \( x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 16y - 46 = 0 \). So, moving things around:

\( x^2 + 6x - y^2 + 16y = 46 \)

Which becomes, after completing the squares:

\( (x^2 + 6x + 9) - (y^2 - 16y + 64) = 46 + 9 - 64 \)

Wait, let me step back. Maybe I should handle both x and y terms.

Original equation: \( x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 16y - 46 = 0 \)

Group x and y terms:

\( (x^2 + 6x) - (y^2 - 16y) = 46 \)

Now, complete the squares:

For x: \( x^2 + 6x \); add 9, so \( (x + 3)^2 \)

For y: \( - (y^2 - 16y) \); factor out negative: \( - [ (y^2 - 16y + 64) - 64 ] = - (y - 8)^2 + 64 \)

So, putting back into the equation:

\( (x + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 + 64 = 46 \)

Wait, because the original equation is \( (x + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 + 64 = 46 \)

So, move constants to the right:

\( (x + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 = 46 - 64 \)

Which is:

\( (x + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 = -18 \)

Hmm, that's a hyperbola centered at (-3, 8). The standard form is \( \frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1 \), so here, it would be:

\( \frac{(x + 3)^2}{18} - \frac{(y - 8)^2}{18} = -1 \)

Which can be rewritten as:

\( \frac{(y - 8)^2}{18} - \frac{(x + 3)^2}{18} = 1 \)

So, it's a hyperbola centered at (-3, 8) with a vertical transverse axis, a = sqrt(18) = 3*sqrt(2), and b = 3*sqrt(2).

Got it. So, first circle: center (-3, 12), radius 9. Second hyperbola: center (-3, 8), a vertical transverse axis, transverse axis length 2a = 6*sqrt(2), conjugate axis length 2b = 6*sqrt(2). Hmm.

Now, the problem is that these two graphs intersect at four points. So, I need to find these four points and then compute the sum of their distances to (-3, 2).

Hmm, computing four points might be tedious, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, the four points lie on both the circle and the hyperbola. So, maybe I can parametrize the solutions or find some symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the equations of the lines connecting (-3, 2) to each intersection point and then relate their distances.

But that might not be straightforward either.

Wait, another idea: Since both equations are quadratic, the sum of distances from points on them to a fixed point can sometimes be connected through properties of the equations.

But I don't recall a specific theorem about this. Maybe I need to think geometrically.

Wait, perhaps there's a reflection property or something with the circle and hyperbola.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates. Let me try to solve the two equations simultaneously to find the four points.

So, I have:

1. \( (x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 = 81 \) (Circle)
2. \( (x + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 = -18 \) (Hyperbola)

Maybe I can subtract the hyperbola equation from the circle equation to eliminate \( (x + 3)^2 \).

Let me do that:

From equation 1: \( (x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 = 81 \)

From equation 2: \( (x + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 = -18 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

[ (x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 ] - [ (x + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 ] = 81 - (-18)

Simplify:

\( (y - 12)^2 - (y - 8)^2 = 99 \)

Let me compute this:

Expand both squares:

\( (y^2 - 24y + 144) - (y^2 - 16y + 64) = 99 \)

Simplify:

\( y^2 - 24y + 144 - y^2 + 16y - 64 = 99 \)

Combine like terms:

(-24y + 16y) + (144 - 64) = 99

-8y + 80 = 99

So, -8y = 99 - 80 = 19

Thus, y = -19/8

Hmm, y is -19/8. That seems a bit odd, but maybe it's correct. Let me check my steps.

Wait, in the subtraction step:

When I subtract equation 2 from equation 1, it's [equation1] - [equation2], which is:

\( (x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 - (x + 3)^2 + (y - 8)^2 = 81 - (-18) \)

Wait, no, actually, equation 1 minus equation 2 would be:

\( (x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 - (x + 3)^2 + (y - 8)^2 = 81 + 18 \)

Wait, no, no. Wait, when subtracting equations:

Equation1 - Equation2 = 0 - (-18) = 18? Wait, no, 81 - (-18) is 99.

Wait, no, equation1 is 81, equation2 is -18. So, equation1 - equation2 is 81 - (-18) = 99. So that's correct.

So, that gives me -8y + 80 = 99, so y = (99 - 80)/(-8) = 19/(-8) = -19/8.

Okay, so y is -19/8. So that's fixed.

Now, substitute y = -19/8 into one of the original equations to find x.

Let me use equation2: \( (x + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 = -18 \)

Substitute y = -19/8:

\( (x + 3)^2 - ( (-19/8) - 8 )^2 = -18 \)

Simplify:

First, compute (-19/8 - 8):

Convert 8 to 64/8, so -19/8 - 64/8 = (-19 - 64)/8 = -83/8

So, the equation becomes:

\( (x + 3)^2 - ( -83/8 )^2 = -18 \)

Compute ( -83/8 )^2: (83)^2 / (8)^2 = 6889 / 64

So, equation is:

\( (x + 3)^2 - 6889/64 = -18 \)

Bring 6889/64 to the right:

\( (x + 3)^2 = -18 + 6889/64 \)

Convert -18 to -1152/64:

So, \( (x + 3)^2 = (-1152/64) + (6889/64) = (6889 - 1152)/64 = 5737/64 \)

So, \( (x + 3)^2 = 5737/64 \)

Take square roots:

\( x + 3 = \pm \sqrt{5737}/8 \)

Compute sqrt(5737). Hmm, 5737 is 5737. Let me see if it's a perfect square.

Wait, 5737 divided by 16 is 358.5625. Hmm, not a perfect square.

Wait, perhaps 5737 is prime? Let me check.

Wait, 5737 divided by 13 is 441.307..., not an integer. 5737 divided by 7 is 819.571..., not integer. Maybe sqrt is irrational.

So, x + 3 = ± sqrt(5737)/8, so x = -3 ± sqrt(5737)/8.

Therefore, the four intersection points are:

1. \( x = -3 + \sqrt{5737}/8 \), \( y = -19/8 \)

2. \( x = -3 - \sqrt{5737}/8 \), \( y = -19/8 \)

3. Wait, hold on. Wait, in equation2, when we solved, we got y = -19/8, but equation1 gave us x in terms of sqrt(5737). But equation1 is a circle, which should intersect the hyperbola at four points, so perhaps both x solutions correspond to two points each? Or maybe I missed something.

Wait, no. When I subtracted the equations, I found y = -19/8, and then found x in terms of sqrt, so that would give two points with y = -19/8 and x = some value. But that can't be, because the circle and the hyperbola should intersect at four points.

Wait, no, hold on. When subtracting equation2 from equation1, I got y = -19/8. So, that is a single y value. So, that suggests that both intersection points lie on the same horizontal line y = -19/8.

But a circle and a hyperbola can intersect at four points, but if they intersect on a horizontal line, are there two points? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, actually, the intersection points of the circle and hyperbola can lie on a horizontal line if that line is intersected by both. So, perhaps for each x, there's a corresponding y, but in this case, since we found y = -19/8, which is a single y value, but the circle and hyperbola might have two points with that y and two points with other y values.

Wait, but in the subtraction step, I got y = -19/8, so maybe that's just one y value for which both equations hold. But in reality, the circle and hyperbola can intersect at four points, so perhaps the other solutions come from another equation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in subtracting the equations. Let me double-check.

Equation1: (x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 = 81

Equation2: (x + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 = -18

Subtract equation2 from equation1:

[ (x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 ] - [ (x + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 ] = 81 - (-18)

Simplify:

(y - 12)^2 - (y - 8)^2 = 99

Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, no: When subtracting equations, it's equation1 - equation2, which is:

[ (x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 ] - [ (x + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 ] = 81 - (-18)

Which is:

(y - 12)^2 - (y - 8)^2 = 99

Which is correct. Then expanding:

(y^2 - 24y + 144) - (y^2 - 16y + 64) = 99

Simplify:

-8y + 80 = 99 => -8y = 19 => y = -19/8

So, that seems correct. So, y is fixed at -19/8, so that suggests that all intersection points lie on the line y = -19/8. But that can't be, because a circle and hyperbola can intersect at four points, not on a straight line.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption? Let me see: The two curves are the circle and the hyperbola. The circle is centered at (-3, 12) with radius 9, and the hyperbola is centered at (-3, 8) with a vertical transverse axis.

So, both have the same x-coordinate for their centers, which is -3. So, both are symmetric with respect to the line x = -3. Hmm.

But the line y = -19/8 is a horizontal line. So, if I have a circle and a hyperbola both centered at (-3, something), and a horizontal line y = k. So, perhaps the horizontal line cuts through both, giving two points for each?

Wait, but if a horizontal line intersects a circle, it can have two points, and if it intersects a hyperbola, it can have two points as well. So, in total, four points.

So, that makes sense. So, the intersection is two points on the horizontal line y = -19/8, and maybe two other points? But in reality, for a circle and hyperbola, maybe all four intersection points lie on that horizontal line. Wait, but a circle and a hyperbola can intersect at four points, two of which could be on a horizontal line.

Wait, but in this case, when we subtracted the equations, we got y = -19/8. So, that suggests that all four points lie on that horizontal line. So, perhaps both curves are symmetric with respect to that line.

But that seems odd because the circle is centered at (-3, 12), and the hyperbola is centered at (-3, 8). The two centers are vertically aligned. So, perhaps the horizontal line y = -19/8 is a common chord for both the circle and the hyperbola.

Wait, that would make sense. So, the circle and hyperbola intersect at four points lying on the horizontal line y = -19/8. So, each of these four points is on that line, so y = -19/8.

So, that would mean, instead of getting two x-values, we have two x-values and one y-value, so four points in total.

But that seems a bit strange because a horizontal line can intersect a circle at two points and a hyperbola at two points, so four points in total.

So, that seems consistent.

So, in that case, the four points are:

1. ( x1, -19/8 )

2. ( x2, -19/8 )

3. ( x3, -19/8 )

4. ( x4, -19/8 )

But wait, actually, no. Wait, if we have a horizontal line intersecting both a circle and a hyperbola, each intersection can have two points, but if the line is common, then perhaps all four intersection points lie on that line. So, each intersection contributes two points, but maybe in reality, the line is intersected twice by each curve, so four points.

Wait, but in reality, a circle and a hyperbola can't intersect in four points unless they are arranged in a special way.

Wait, perhaps the hyperbola and the circle intersect at four points, two above and two below the center? But in this case, our centers are at (-3, 12) and (-3, 8). So, the horizontal line y = -19/8 is way below both centers.

So, perhaps both the circle and the hyperbola intersect the horizontal line y = -19/8 at two points each, so four points in total.

But in that case, each intersection point would have the same y-coordinate, -19/8, but different x-coordinates.

So, that suggests that the four points are symmetric with respect to the center line x = -3.

Hmm, that makes sense because both the circle and hyperbola are symmetric about x = -3. So, their intersections should also be symmetric about x = -3.

Therefore, each pair of points would be mirror images across x = -3.

So, for example, one point is at x = a, y = -19/8, and the other is at x = -6 - a, y = -19/8, where a is some value.

So, that would make sense.

Therefore, the four points are:

1. (a, -19/8 )

2. (-6 - a, -19/8 )

3. (b, -19/8 )

4. (-6 - b, -19/8 )

But actually, since the hyperbola and the circle are symmetric about x = -3, which is the vertical line x = -3, so each intersection with the horizontal line y = -19/8 would be symmetric across x = -3.

So, if one point is at x = h, then the other would be at x = -6 - h.

Therefore, the four points would be (h, k), (-6 - h, k), (m, k), (-6 - m, k), where k = -19/8.

But since we only have a horizontal line, each pair is symmetric.

But in reality, the four points are in two pairs: (h, k) and (-6 - h, k), and similarly for the other pair.

But perhaps the points are arranged as (h, k), (-6 - h, k), (m, k), (-6 - m, k). So, four points.

But in any case, since all four points lie on the horizontal line y = -19/8, their distances to the point (-3, 2) can be computed as the vertical distance from each point to (-3, 2), since the horizontal distance will be the same.

Wait, is that true? Wait, no. Wait, the distance from a point to another is the Euclidean distance, not just vertical.

But in this case, all points lie on y = -19/8, which is a horizontal line. So, the distance from each point (a, -19/8) to (-3, 2) is sqrt( (a + 3)^2 + ( (-19/8 - 2) )^2 ).

But wait, 2 is 16/8, so -19/8 - 16/8 = -35/8.

So, the distance is sqrt( (a + 3)^2 + ( -35/8 )^2 )

But since all four points lie on this line, each of their distances to (-3, 2) can be written as sqrt( (a + 3)^2 + ( -35/8 )^2 )

But since the sum of the distances is four times this value? Wait, no, because each point contributes a distance.

Wait, actually, no, each point is a separate point, so their distances are separate. So, the sum would be the sum of each individual distance.

But if all four points lie on the same horizontal line, but symmetrically placed around x = -3, then perhaps the two points on one side are reflections of the two points on the other side.

But wait, let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the distances can be related to the properties of the curves.

Wait, another idea: The sum of the distances from a point to the two curves. But the problem is not about the sum of the distances from the point to each curve, but the sum of the distances from the four intersection points to the point.

But maybe we can relate this to the properties of the circle and hyperbola.

Wait, the four points lie on both curves, so perhaps their coordinates can be used to compute their distances to (-3, 2).

But given that the four points lie on y = -19/8, perhaps their distances can be expressed in terms of their x-coordinates, and since the sum is required, maybe we can find a way to compute the total sum without explicitly finding each coordinate.

Wait, let's see.

Given that all four points lie on y = -19/8, and the point (-3, 2), so the vertical distance between (-3, 2) and each point is | -19/8 - 2 | = | -19/8 - 16/8 | = | -35/8 | = 35/8.

But the horizontal distance from each point to (-3, 2) is | x - (-3) | = | x + 3 |.

Therefore, the distance from each point (x, -19/8) to (-3, 2) is sqrt( (x + 3)^2 + (35/8)^2 )

But since all four points are on this horizontal line, each point contributes sqrt( (x + 3)^2 + (35/8)^2 ) to the total sum.

But that's four terms, each with sqrt( (x + 3)^2 + (35/8)^2 ). That seems complicated.

Wait, unless there's a way to combine these terms or find a relationship.

But perhaps there is a smarter way.

Wait, let's consider that all four points lie on y = -19/8. So, if we denote each x-coordinate as h, then the distance from each point (h, -19/8) to (-3, 2) is sqrt( (h + 3)^2 + ( (-19/8) - 2 )^2 ) = sqrt( (h + 3)^2 + ( (-35/8) )^2 )

So, sqrt( (h + 3)^2 + (35/8)^2 )

But since (h + 3) is the horizontal distance, and (35/8) is the vertical difference.

Now, note that the four points are symmetric around x = -3, so if one point is at h, another is at -6 - h, because of the symmetry.

So, suppose the four points are at x = a, x = -6 - a, x = b, x = -6 - b.

So, their distances to (-3, 2) are sqrt( (a + 3)^2 + (35/8)^2 ), sqrt( (-6 - a + 3)^2 + (35/8)^2 ), sqrt( (b + 3)^2 + (35/8)^2 ), and sqrt( (-6 - b + 3)^2 + (35/8)^2 )

Simplify each term:

First term: sqrt( (a + 3)^2 + (35/8)^2 )

Second term: sqrt( (-3 - a)^2 + (35/8)^2 ) = sqrt( (a + 3)^2 + (35/8)^2 )

Third term: sqrt( (b + 3)^2 + (35/8)^2 )

Fourth term: sqrt( (-3 - b)^2 + (35/8)^2 ) = sqrt( (b + 3)^2 + (35/8)^2 )

So, the second and fourth terms are equal to the first and third terms, respectively.

Therefore, the total sum is 2 * [ sqrt( (a + 3)^2 + (35/8)^2 ) + sqrt( (b + 3)^2 + (35/8)^2 ) ]

But that still seems complicated unless I can find a relationship between a and b.

Wait, but we have more information. The four points lie on both the circle and the hyperbola. So, we can use that to find a relationship between a and b.

But perhaps it's better to consider that all four points lie on both equations, so maybe we can find the product of their distances to (-3, 2), or something else.

Wait, but maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, another idea: Since all four points lie on the horizontal line y = -19/8, and the circle is centered at (-3, 12), the distance from the center of the circle to the line y = -19/8 is |12 - (-19/8)| = |12 + 19/8| = |96/8 + 19/8| = |115/8| = 115/8. So, 14.375 units.

Similarly, the radius of the circle is 9 units. So, the distance from the center to the line is 115/8, which is less than 9? Wait, 115/8 is 14.375, which is greater than 9. So, the line y = -19/8 is outside the circle, meaning the circle and the hyperbola intersect the line at four points.

Wait, but in any case, the distance from the center to the line is 115/8, which is greater than the radius 9, so the line y = -19/8 doesn't intersect the circle? But we know that it does, because we found four intersection points.

Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the distance from the center to the line is 115/8, which is 14.375, which is greater than the radius 9, so the line y = -19/8 doesn't intersect the circle. But we know that it does, because the two curves intersect at four points.

Wait, that can't be. There must be a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let's recalculate the distance from (-3, 12) to the line y = -19/8.

The line y = -19/8 is horizontal, so the distance from a point (x, y) to this line is |y - (-19/8)| = |y + 19/8|.

So, for the center (-3, 12), the distance is |12 + 19/8| = |96/8 + 19/8| = |115/8| = 115/8, which is approximately 14.375. Which is indeed greater than the radius 9. So, the line y = -19/8 is outside the circle, so it should not intersect the circle, but we found four intersection points. Contradiction.

Wait, that suggests that my previous reasoning was wrong. So, if the line y = -19/8 is outside the circle, how can it intersect the circle?

But from the equations, when we subtracted, we got y = -19/8, meaning that all four intersection points lie on that line, but if the line is outside the circle, how come four points lie on it?

Wait, perhaps because the hyperbola also intersects the line outside the circle. But a hyperbola is not a closed curve, so it can intersect a line outside in four points.

But in reality, for a hyperbola, a line can intersect it in two points, but if the line is outside, it can still intersect in two points on either side.

Wait, no, for hyperbola, depending on the line, it can have two points, one point, or none.

Wait, in this case, the hyperbola is centered at (-3, 8), opening upwards and downwards, and the line y = -19/8 is quite far below it. So, perhaps the hyperbola doesn't intersect the line y = -19/8 at all.

But in the problem statement, it says the graphs intersect at four points, so that must be the case.

Wait, so perhaps my mistake was that I incorrectly subtracted the equations, leading to a line y = -19/8, which is outside the circle, but the hyperbola also intersects that line.

Wait, but that seems impossible because if the line is outside the circle, it shouldn't intersect the circle.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in another way.

Wait, actually, the circle and hyperbola can intersect in four points even if the line is outside the circle. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, but in reality, for the circle, if the line is outside, it can't intersect the circle. So, in that case, the four points must come from the hyperbola.

Wait, but the hyperbola is symmetric, so perhaps it does intersect the line y = -19/8 at four points.

Wait, but earlier, we thought that the line y = -19/8 is outside the circle, but because the hyperbola can extend to infinity, perhaps the hyperbola does intersect the line.

Wait, let me think. The hyperbola is centered at (-3, 8) opening upwards and downwards. So, it extends to infinity in both vertical directions.

Therefore, the line y = -19/8 is below the center of the hyperbola, so it must intersect the hyperbola in four points.

Therefore, in that case, the four points are two from the circle and two from the hyperbola? Wait, but the circle is centered above the line y = -19/8, so maybe the circle and the hyperbola both intersect the line y = -19/8, giving four points in total.

Therefore, the line y = -19/8 intersects the circle and the hyperbola, each in two points.

Wait, but in reality, the circle is centered above the line, so maybe the circle intersects the line in two points, and the hyperbola also intersects the line in two points, making four intersection points.

But in that case, the four points are on the line y = -19/8, with two from the circle and two from the hyperbola.

But wait, that would mean that the four points lie on the line y = -19/8, two from the circle and two from the hyperbola.

But in that case, the vertical distance from each point to (-3, 2) is the same: | -19/8 - 2 | = 35/8. So, each point is at vertical distance 35/8 from (-3, 2). So, if all four points are on y = -19/8, then their distance to (-3, 2) is the same for each point.

Therefore, the sum of the distances is 4 times that distance, which is 4 * (35/8) = 140/8 = 17.5, which is 35/2.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.

Wait, so if all four points are on the line y = -19/8, and each point is at a vertical distance of 35/8 from (-3, 2), then the sum is 4 * 35/8 = 35/2.

But is that correct? Because in reality, each point is on that line, but the distance is the same for each point.

Wait, yes, because each point is at the same vertical distance from (-3, 2), so their distances are equal.

Therefore, the sum is 4 times that distance, which is 35/2.

Wait, is that possible?

Wait, let me think again. The line y = -19/8 is 35/8 units away from y = 2, right?

Because 2 is 16/8, so 35/8 - 16/8 = 19/8. Wait, no, the distance is the absolute difference in y-coordinates.

So, the vertical distance is | -19/8 - 2 | = | -19/8 - 16/8 | = | -35/8 | = 35/8. So, that's correct.

Since all four points lie on that line, each is 35/8 units away from (-3, 2). Therefore, the sum is 4*(35/8) = 35/2.

Therefore, the answer is 35/2, which is 17.5, but as a fraction, 35/2.

But wait, let me make sure that all four points are indeed on that line. The hyperbola and the circle both intersect that line, so each gives two points.

But in reality, the hyperbola and the circle both intersect that line, so their four intersection points are on y = -19/8, so each point is at 35/8 away vertically from (-3, 2). So, their distances are all the same, so the sum is 4*(35/8) = 35/2.

Therefore, the answer is 35/2, which is 17.5.

Wait, but the problem is to compute the sum, so 35/2 is 17.5. But in the problem statement, it's likely to write it as a fraction, so 35/2.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again.

Given that the four intersection points lie on y = -19/8, and each is at a vertical distance of 35/8 from (-3, 2), so the distance is 35/8.

Therefore, sum is 4*(35/8) = 35/2.

Hence, the answer is 35/2.

Wait, let me just make sure that the four points are not at different distances, but I don't think so because all four are on the same horizontal line, so their distances to (-3, 2) are all the same.

Therefore, I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{35}{2}}
</think>

To solve the problem of finding the sum of the distances from the four intersection points of the given graphs to the point \((-3, 2)\), we start by analyzing the equations of the circle and the hyperbola.

1. The equation of the circle is:
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72 = 0
   \]
   Completing the square, we rewrite it as:
   \[
   (x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 = 81
   \]
   This is a circle centered at \((-3, 12)\) with radius 9.

2. The equation of the hyperbola is:
   \[
   x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 16y - 46 = 0
   \]
   Completing the square, we rewrite it as:
   \[
   (x + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 = -18
   \]
   This is a hyperbola centered at \((-3, 8)\) opening upwards and downwards.

Next, we find the intersection points of these two graphs by solving the system of equations. Subtracting the equations, we find that the intersection points lie on the horizontal line \(y = -\frac{19}{8}\).

The four intersection points are on this horizontal line, and each point's distance to the point \((-3, 2)\) is calculated as follows:
- The vertical distance from each point \((x, -\frac{19}{8})\) to \((-3, 2)\) is \(| -\frac{19}{8} - 2 | = \frac{35}{8}\).
- Since all four points are on the same horizontal line, their distances to \((-3, 2)\) are the same.

Thus, the sum of the distances from these four points to \((-3, 2)\) is:
\[
4 \times \frac{35}{8} = \frac{140}{8} = \frac{35}{2}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{35}{2}}
\]
