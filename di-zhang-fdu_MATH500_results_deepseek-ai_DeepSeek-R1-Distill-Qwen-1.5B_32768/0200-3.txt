Question:
In how many ways can 8 people be seated around a square table with 2 people on a side?  (Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.)

Correct Answer:
There are $8!$ ways to place the people around the table, but this counts each valid arrangement 4 times (if you move each person 2, 4, or 6 places clockwise you get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\dfrac{8!}{4} = \boxed{10080}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to figure out how many ways 8 people can be seated around a square table where each side has 2 people. The catch is that two configurations are considered the same if one can be rotated to look like the other. Hmm, sounds like a permutation problem with some rotational symmetry to consider. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I know that when arranging people around a circular table, the number of distinct arrangements is usually (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. But in this case, it's a square table, so it's a bit different because it has sides and corners. Each side has 2 people, which means each side is like a pair of adjacent seats.

Wait, so does that mean each side is a pair of seats, and each person can be on either side? So for a square table, we have four sides, each with two seats. So in total, there are 8 seats. Each side has two seats, and each seat is adjacent to two others on the same side and two others at the corners.

But the table is square, so we can fix one person's position to account for rotations. I think fixing a position can help eliminate the rotational symmetry from messing up the count. So if I fix one person's seat, say person A at the top right corner, then the table's rotations can be accounted for by fixing person A's position.

But actually, since it's a square table, fixing a position might not be enough because the table can still be rotated in different ways. Wait, no, actually, if I fix person A at a specific seat, the rest of the seats can be arranged in a linear fashion relative to that fixed point. So maybe fixing one person's seat is sufficient to account for rotational symmetry.

But let me think again. In a circular table with 8 seats, the number of distinct arrangements considering rotations is (8-1)! = 7! = 5040. But in this case, the table is square, so it's not a circular table but a polygonal one. Each side has two seats, which adds some structure to the problem.

So perhaps I need to model this as arranging people around the square table with the adjacency constraints. Each side has two seats, so each side is a pair of adjacent seats. Thus, each side is a pair, and the table is a square, so the sides are connected at the corners.

This seems a bit like arranging people around a cube, but in two dimensions. Hmm, maybe it's similar to arranging people around a circular table but with the additional constraint of fixed sides.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this problem as arranging people around the square table by considering the four sides and the two seats on each side as separate entities.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of this as arranging people in a circle, but with the table being a square. So, in a circular table with 8 seats, the number of distinct arrangements is 7! because of rotations. But since it's a square table, we have more symmetries. The square has 4 sides, so the group of rotations is the cyclic group of order 4, meaning that the number of distinct arrangements is 7! divided by 4.

But I'm not sure if that's correct because the square has both rotational and reflectional symmetries. Wait, so the dihedral group, which includes both rotations and reflections, has order 8. So if I fix one person's position, the number of distinct arrangements is 7! divided by 8.

Wait, let me recall Burnside's lemma. It says that the number of distinct arrangements is equal to the average number of fixed points of the group actions. So perhaps I can apply Burnside's lemma here.

But before diving into Burnside's lemma, let me think if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for circular permutations with symmetries.

But perhaps another way is to consider the square table as a graph, with four nodes for each corner and four nodes for each side's two seats. Wait, no, actually, each side has two seats, so it's more like a cycle with eight nodes, each connected to two others, but in a square, each node is connected to two others on the same side and two others at the corners.

Hmm, maybe that's overcomplicating it. Let me try to think in terms of fixing one person's seat to account for rotational symmetry.

So, fix person A at a specific seat, say the top right corner. Then, the remaining 7 seats can be arranged in 7! ways. But since the table is square, rotating the entire table 90 degrees would result in a different configuration. So, how many rotational symmetries does the square table have? It should have four rotational symmetries: 0째, 90째, 180째, and 270째. So, the number of distinct arrangements is 7! divided by 4.

Wait, so the number of distinct seating arrangements is 7! / 4. Is that correct? Let me check.

If I fix person A's seat, then the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways. The square table has four rotational symmetries, so each arrangement is counted four times in the 7! count. Therefore, to get the number of distinct arrangements, we divide 7! by 4.

So, 7! is 5040, and 5040 divided by 4 is 1260. So, is the answer 1260? Wait, but is that it? Or is there more to it?

Wait, no. Because the square table has reflectional symmetries as well. So, in Burnside's lemma, we consider all symmetries, including reflections. So, the dihedral group has 8 elements: 4 rotations and 4 reflections.

So, if I use Burnside's lemma, I need to compute the number of arrangements fixed by each symmetry and then average them.

But since I fixed person A's seat, does that affect the reflection symmetries? Hmm, maybe not necessarily. Let me think.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as a circular table with 8 seats, but with additional constraints because each side has two seats. So, in other words, each side is a pair of adjacent seats, which are connected via a corner.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this problem as arranging people around the square table where each side is a pair of adjacent seats, so it's like arranging people around a square where each side is a pair, and each pair is adjacent.

This seems similar to arranging people around a circular table where each side is a pair, but since it's a square, the table is cyclic but also has sides.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of this as a graph with eight nodes arranged in a square, each node representing a seat, and edges connecting adjacent seats. Then, arranging people is equivalent to labeling the nodes with people, considering rotations and reflections as equivalent.

But since the table is square, the automorphism group is the dihedral group of order 8.

But in this case, we have eight seats, each with two people, so it's a bit different.

Wait, maybe it's better to model each side as a pair of seats, so each side is two seats. So, each side has two seats, and the four sides make up the entire table.

Therefore, each seat is part of a side and a corner. Wait, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to model the square table as a circle with eight seats, each side having two adjacent seats, and then considering the rotational and reflectional symmetries.

Wait, perhaps I can fix two people at opposite corners and then arrange the rest. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can model this problem as arranging people around a square table where each side is two seats. So, each side is like a pair of adjacent seats, and the square table has four sides, each with two seats.

So, in terms of graph theory, the square table can be thought of as a cycle graph with eight nodes, each connected to two others. Then, arranging people is like labeling the nodes with people, considering rotations and reflections as equivalent.

In that case, the number of distinct labelings would be (8-1)! / 2, which is 7!/2 = 2520 / 2 = 1260. Wait, but that's just the same number as before.

Wait, but in circular permutation, the formula is (n-1)! / 2 for dihedral group, which includes rotations and reflections. So, for n=8, it's 7!/2 = 1260.

But in my problem, the square table is more structured because each side has two seats, so maybe it's different.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the number is different because the square imposes more constraints. So, maybe the number is higher or lower than 1260.

Wait, let me think again. If the table is circular, with 8 seats, then the number of distinct arrangements is 7! / 2 = 2520, because of rotations and reflections. But in this case, the square imposes additional constraints because each side has two seats, which are adjacent on the table.

So, does that mean that the number is higher because of the more constraints? Or lower?

Wait, actually, if the table is more constrained, meaning that some arrangements that are rotationally symmetric in the circular case might not be in the square case, so the number might be higher.

Wait, actually, no, because in the square case, the table is more constrained in the sense that the sides are fixed in a way that only rotations by 90 degrees are symmetries, not all rotations.

So, perhaps the number is higher because you have more symmetries.

Wait, but I'm confused because I thought that the dihedral group is the same for square and circular table.

Wait, no, the dihedral group for a square is the same as for a circular table with 8 seats, because the square can be inscribed in a circle, right? So, the dihedral group is the same.

Therefore, the number of symmetries is 8, so the number of distinct arrangements would be 7! / 8 = 5040 / 8 = 630.

But wait, that's different from the earlier result of 1260.

Wait, so which one is correct? Is it 630 or 1260?

Wait, perhaps I need to reconcile these two approaches.

In the first approach, I fixed a person's seat and considered the remaining 7 seats, leading to 7! / 4 = 1260.

In the second approach, using Burnside's lemma with the dihedral group of order 8, giving 7! / 8 = 630.

Which is correct?

Hmm. Maybe I need to think about what exactly the problem is asking. It says "In how many ways can 8 people be seated around a square table with 2 people on a side?" So, each side has 2 people, meaning that each side is a pair of adjacent seats.

Therefore, the problem is not just about circular permutations but about linear arrangements with the added constraint of the square structure.

In circular permutations, the number is (n-1)! because of rotational symmetry, but in this case, the square imposes more constraints because each side is a pair.

Wait, so perhaps the problem is similar to arranging people around a circular table where each side has two adjacent seats, but since it's a square, each side is connected to another side.

Therefore, it's more like arranging people in a cycle where the adjacency is constrained to the sides.

Wait, but since the square has four sides, each with two seats, it's not a circular table but a square table, so it's a bit different.

Wait, perhaps the number of distinct arrangements is (8-1)! / 4, which is 7! / 4 = 1260, as I thought earlier.

Alternatively, using Burnside's lemma, if I fix one seat, then the number of distinct arrangements is 7! / 8 = 630.

Wait, but I think the key here is that in the square table, each side is a pair, so the square has four sides, each with two seats, and each seat is part of two sides.

Therefore, perhaps the problem is similar to arranging people in a cycle where each pair of adjacent seats is part of a side.

In that case, the number of distinct arrangements would be (n-1)! / 4, accounting for the four sides.

Wait, but I might be overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, think of the square table as a cycle with four sides, each side having two seats. So, each side is adjacent to two others.

Therefore, the number of distinct seating arrangements would be similar to arranging people around a cycle where each side has two seats.

In such a case, the number of arrangements is (n-1)! / 2, because of the cycle, but since each side is two seats, perhaps it's different.

Wait, actually, no, because each side is two seats, so the problem is more constrained.

Wait, perhaps I can model this problem as arranging people around a square table where each side is a pair.

So, maybe each side is a pair, so it's like a circular arrangement where each pair is adjacent.

Wait, but a circular arrangement requires the first and last elements to also be adjacent, but in this case, it's a square, so the first and last elements (seats) are not adjacent.

Wait, that might complicate things.

Wait, let me try to model this as a graph. The square table has four sides, each side is a pair of seats. So, each side is an edge connecting two seats. The four sides form a cycle, so it's a 4-cycle graph where each edge is a pair of seats.

So, arranging people around this square table is like a permutation on the four sides, each side having two seats.

Wait, but each side is a pair, so each pair must have two people. So, perhaps the number of ways to arrange the people is similar to arranging them in a square where each side has two people.

But since each side is a pair of seats, the problem is similar to arranging people in a cycle where each edge has two seats, and each pair is adjacent.

Wait, in such a case, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! / 2, since it's a cycle with n edges, each of length 2.

Wait, but in our case, n=8, so it's (8-1)! / 2 = 7! / 2 = 2520 / 2 = 1260.

But that's the same number as before when I fixed a person's seat and divided by 4.

Wait, so which is correct? 1260 or 630?

Wait, perhaps I need to think about it differently.

If I model the square table as a cycle with four sides, each side being a pair of seats, then arranging people around it is similar to arranging people in a cycle where each edge has two seats.

In that case, the number of distinct arrangements would be (n-1)! / 2, which is 1260, same as before.

Alternatively, using Burnside's lemma, if I consider the dihedral group of order 8, so 4 rotations and 4 reflections, then the number of distinct arrangements is (number of fixed arrangements by each symmetry) divided by 8.

So, let me compute the fixed arrangements for each symmetry.

First, identity rotation: fixes all arrangements, so 7! = 5040.

Rotations by 90째, 180째, and 270째: for a rotation to fix an arrangement, each side must have the same pair of people. But since each side has two people, this would require that all sides are the same, which is only possible if all people are the same, which they are not. So, no fixed arrangements for these rotations.

Wait, no, actually, for a rotation by 90째, each person must be rotated to the next person, so the arrangement must be such that the pairs are rotated. So, each side must have the same pair. But since the pairs are fixed on the sides, this would only be possible if all four pairs are the same, which is not the case. So, no fixed arrangements for 90째 and 270째 rotations.

For a rotation by 180째, each person must be swapped with the person opposite them. So, each pair of opposite seats must have the same pair of people. But since it's a square table, each seat is connected to another seat via a side. So, for each side, the two seats must be occupied by the same pair. So, the arrangement is determined by four pairs of people, each pair sitting on a side.

But wait, the table has eight seats, each side has two seats. So, each side must have a pair of people, and since it's a square, each pair is opposite each other.

Wait, but each pair is on the same side, so each pair is adjacent on the table.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each side must have two people, so each side is a pair. So, for a rotation by 180째, each seat must be swapped with the seat opposite it, so the pairs must be the same. So, if seat 1 is paired with seat 5, seat 2 with seat 6, seat 3 with seat 7, seat 4 with seat 8. So, each pair must be the same. But since each side has two seats, it's like the four pairs are on the sides.

Wait, but for a square table, each side is two seats, so the four sides correspond to the four pairs. So, if we rotate by 180째, each seat is swapped with the seat opposite, so each pair must be the same. Therefore, the number of fixed arrangements under 180째 rotation is equal to the number of ways to arrange the four pairs, each pair being two identical people, but since all people are distinct, the number of fixed arrangements is the number of ways to arrange the four pairs, which is 4! = 24.

But wait, no, because each pair is two people, so the number of distinct arrangements is 4! because each pair is indistinct in terms of their positions, but since all people are distinct, each pair can be arranged in 2! ways, but since the pairs are fixed on the sides, perhaps it's more complex.

Wait, actually, in this case, since the table is fixed under rotation, the arrangement must be invariant under 180째 rotation, so each person must be swapped with the person opposite them. Therefore, the pairs must be the same on opposite sides.

Wait, but the pairs are on the sides, so each side is a pair, and if you rotate by 180째, each pair is swapped with itself.

Wait, no, each pair is on a side, which is opposite another side. So, for a rotation by 180째, each seat is swapped with the seat opposite. So, the pairs on each side must be the same as the pairs on their opposite sides. Therefore, the number of fixed arrangements is the number of ways to arrange the four pairs, each pair being two people, but since all people are distinct, it's equivalent to arranging the four pairs, which is 4! = 24.

But wait, since each pair has two people, and there are four pairs, the number of distinct arrangements would be 4! * (2!)^4 divided by the symmetries. Wait, no, because each pair is fixed on a side, so the pairs are distinguishable by their location.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the four pairs as distinct, so the number of fixed arrangements under 180째 rotation is (4)! = 24.

But actually, each pair is on a side, which is fixed under 180째 rotation. So, the number of distinct arrangements fixed by 180째 is equal to the number of ways to assign people to the four pairs, which is 4! * (2!)^4, but since the pairs are fixed on the sides, it's 4! * (2!)^4 / (2^4) because each pair can be arranged in 2! ways, but since the pairs are on fixed sides, perhaps it's different.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I need to think about it differently.

If I have four pairs, each pair is on a side, and under 180째 rotation, each side swaps with the opposite side. So, for the arrangement to be fixed, each pair must be the same on both sides it's swapped with. But since each pair is on a side, and the sides are opposite each other, so each pair is fixed as a whole.

Therefore, the number of fixed arrangements under 180째 rotation is equal to the number of ways to arrange the four pairs, which is 4! = 24, since each pair is fixed on a side and must be the same on both sides.

Therefore, fixed arrangements under 180째 rotation: 24.

Similarly, for the identity rotation, fixed arrangements: 7! = 5040.

For the 90째 and 270째 rotations, fixed arrangements: 0, as discussed earlier.

For the 180째 rotation, fixed arrangements: 24.

Now, reflections: A reflection can be over an axis that passes through two opposite sides or an axis that passes through two opposite corners.

In the case of the square table, there are two types of reflections: those that pass through two opposite sides (flipping the table along a vertical or horizontal axis) and those that pass through two opposite corners (flipping the table along a diagonal).

For each reflection, to find the number of fixed arrangements, we need arrangements that are symmetric with respect to that reflection.

For reflections that pass through two opposite sides, the pairs on each side must be mirrored. Similarly, for reflections that pass through two opposite corners, each pair must be symmetric with respect to the reflection axis.

Let's compute the number of fixed arrangements for each reflection.

First, for reflections through two opposite sides:

Each such reflection fixes the two sides along the axis, so the pairs on these sides are fixed, meaning that the two seats on each side must be occupied by the same pair. But since each side has two seats, and the pairs are on the sides, the number of fixed arrangements is the number of ways to arrange the four pairs, each pair on a side, which is 4! = 24.

Similarly, for reflections through two opposite corners, each reflection axis goes through two corners, so each reflection swaps the two pairs on the sides adjacent to that corner. Therefore, for each reflection, the number of fixed arrangements is the number of ways to assign people to the pairs, which is 4! = 24.

But wait, in this case, each reflection through a corner swaps the pairs on the sides. So, for the arrangement to be fixed under this reflection, the pairs on the sides must be symmetric with respect to the reflection axis.

Therefore, the number of fixed arrangements is equal to the number of ways to assign the four pairs to the four sides, considering the reflection. Hmm, but since the reflection swaps two sides, the pairs on those sides must be equal.

Wait, so for a reflection through a corner, each reflection swaps two pairs of seats. Therefore, the pairs on those sides must be equal, so the number of fixed arrangements is the number of ways to arrange the four pairs in the four sides, considering that two sides are swapped.

Wait, but since we have four pairs, and two sides are swapped, the number of fixed arrangements is 4! / 2 = 12.

Wait, because swapping two sides doesn't change the arrangement, so we have to divide by 2.

Wait, but actually, each reflection swaps two pairs of seats. Therefore, the pairs on those two sides must be equal, so the number of fixed arrangements is equal to the number of ways to assign the four pairs to the four sides, considering that two sides are swapped.

So, if we fix one side to a specific pair, the adjacent side can be any pair, and so on, but since two sides are swapped, we have to divide by 2 to account for the overcounting.

Therefore, the number of fixed arrangements for each reflection through a corner is 4! / 2 = 12.

Similarly, for reflections through sides, each reflection swaps two pairs, so the number of fixed arrangements is also 12.

Therefore, for each reflection through a side: 24 fixed arrangements.

For each reflection through a corner: 12 fixed arrangements.

There are two reflections of each type.

So, total fixed arrangements under reflections:

For side reflections: 2 (reflections) * 24 = 48.

For corner reflections: 2 (reflections) * 12 = 24.

So, total fixed arrangements under all symmetries: 5040 (identity) + 0 (90째) + 0 (270째) + 24 (180째) + 48 (side reflections) + 24 (corner reflections) = 5040 + 24 + 24 + 48 = 5040 + 96 = 5136.

Then, by Burnside's lemma, the number of distinct arrangements is the average number of fixed arrangements divided by the order of the group, which is 8.

So, number of distinct arrangements = 5136 / 8 = 642.

Wait, but that's not matching the earlier numbers. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, so using Burnside's lemma, the number is 642. But earlier, using fixing one person's seat and dividing by 4, I got 1260, and using considering the dihedral group of order 8, I got 630.

Wait, 642 is closer to 630 or 1260?

Wait, 642 is actually 630 + 12, so it's approximately 630.

But 1260 is 2 times 630.

Wait, so perhaps 630 is the correct answer, and 1260 is incorrect.

Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Burnside's lemma calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the fixed arrangements.

For the identity rotation, fixed arrangements: 7! = 5040.

For 90째 and 270째 rotations: fixed arrangements: 0.

For 180째 rotation: fixed arrangements: 24.

For reflections through sides: fixed arrangements: 24 each, two reflections, so 48.

For reflections through corners: fixed arrangements: 12 each, two reflections, so 24.

Total fixed arrangements: 5040 + 0 + 0 + 24 + 48 + 24 = 5040 + 96 = 5136.

Divide by 8: 5136 / 8 = 642.

So, according to Burnside's lemma, the number is 642.

But then, 642 is different from 1260 and 630.

Wait, but in the first approach, fixing one person's seat, and dividing by 4, I got 1260.

In the second approach, Burnside's lemma, I got 642.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the first approach, I fixed one seat, leading to 7! / 4 = 1260, treating the four rotations as equal. But in reality, the square has more symmetries, so perhaps I should be accounting for all eight symmetries.

Wait, but in the Burnside's lemma approach, we considered all eight symmetries, so 642 seems more accurate.

Wait, but let me think again.

In the Burnside's lemma approach, I considered the dihedral group of order 8, which includes four rotations and four reflections.

So, the calculation is as follows:

- Identity: fixes all arrangements, 7! = 5040.

- Rotation by 90째 and 270째: no fixed arrangements, as the pairs must rotate to themselves, which isn't possible.

- Rotation by 180째: fixed arrangements: 24.

- Reflections over sides: each reflection fixes 24 arrangements, so two reflections give 48.

- Reflections over corners: each reflection fixes 12 arrangements, so two reflections give 24.

Total fixed arrangements: 5040 + 0 + 0 + 24 + 48 + 24 = 5136.

Average: 5136 / 8 = 642.

Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 642.

But earlier, fixing one seat and dividing by 4 gave 1260, which is different.

Wait, so why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the problem is with the square table. In the square table, the pairs are adjacent, but they are not just adjacent in the circular sense, but they are adjacent in the square sense.

Therefore, the problem is similar to arranging people around a circular table with two people per side, which is a different structure than a circular table with adjacent pairs.

Therefore, in this case, the number of symmetries is different, and Burnside's lemma is the correct approach.

So, according to Burnside's lemma, the number is 642.

Wait, but let me confirm this with a different approach.

Perhaps I can model this problem as arranging people around the square table such that each side has two people, considering the rotations and reflections.

In that case, the number of distinct arrangements is equal to the number of orbits under the action of the dihedral group on the seating arrangements.

So, using Burnside's lemma, the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed arrangements, which we calculated as 642.

Therefore, the answer should be 642.

But wait, wait, actually, the problem is that the number 642 is correct, but in the initial approach, when I fixed one seat, I considered only rotational symmetry, which is insufficient because the square has more symmetries.

Thus, 642 is the correct number.

Wait, but let me think of a smaller case. Suppose we have a square table with four seats, each side having one person. So, it's a square with one person on each side. How many distinct arrangements are there?

In this case, the number should be (4-1)! / 2 = 3! / 2 = 3.

But let's compute it with Burnside's lemma.

Total symmetries: 8.

Identity: fixes all 4! = 24 arrangements.

90째 rotation: fixed arrangements: 0, since each person must rotate to the next seat, which would require that all people are the same, which they are not.

270째 rotation: same as 90째.

180째 rotation: fixed arrangements: 2 (since each pair must be fixed, so two pairs, each pair can be arranged in 2! ways, so 2! * 2! = 4).

Reflections: two reflections (over sides and over corners). Each reflection fixes 2 arrangements: for reflections over sides, each reflection swaps two pairs, so the number is (4!)/2 = 12.

Wait, no, for a square, the reflection over a side swaps two pairs, so the fixed arrangements would be 4! / 2 = 12.

Similarly, reflection over a corner swaps two pairs, so fixed arrangements: 12.

So, total fixed arrangements: 24 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 12 + 12 = 52.

Average: 52 / 8 = 6.5, which is not integer. That can't be right.

Wait, so that approach is flawed.

Wait, maybe in the four-seat square, we can compute it manually.

Four seats around a square, each side with one person. So, people A, B, C, D.

Total arrangements without considering symmetry: 4! = 24.

Number of distinct arrangements considering rotations and reflections.

Using Burnside's lemma:

Group has 8 elements: identity, three rotations (90째, 180째, 270째), and four reflections.

Compute fixed arrangements:

- Identity: 24.

- Rotation 90째: no fixed arrangements, as all people must be same after rotation, which they are not.

- Rotation 180째: fixed arrangements: the arrangement is same after 180째 rotation, so each pair must be same. So, the number of fixed arrangements is the number of ways to arrange two pairs of people: 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6.

Wait, no, actually, in this case, the pairs are fixed on the square, so each pair is on a side, and the arrangement must be symmetric under 180째 rotation.

So, the number of fixed arrangements is the number of ways to assign the four people into two pairs, each pair assigned to a side.

So, the number is 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6.

Wait, but each pair is assigned to a side, so the number of distinct arrangements is 6.

But in this case, the total fixed arrangements for 180째 rotation: 6.

Similarly, for rotation 270째, same as 90째, fixed arrangements: 0.

For reflections: Each reflection swaps two pairs, so the fixed arrangements are the same as the number of fixed arrangements under 180째, which is 6, but since each reflection is a different axis, perhaps each reflection fixes 6 arrangements.

Wait, no, for reflections over sides, each reflection swaps two pairs, so the fixed arrangements are 6, same as reflections over corners.

So, fixed arrangements under each reflection: 6.

Therefore, total fixed arrangements:

- Identity: 24.

- 90째 and 270째: 0 each.

- 180째: 6.

- Each reflection: 6 each.

So, total fixed arrangements: 24 + 0 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 48.

Average fixed arrangements per group element: 48 / 8 = 6.

Therefore, number of distinct arrangements: 6.

But 4! / 8 = 6, which is correct.

Wait, so in this case, Burnside's lemma gives 6, which is correct.

But in our problem, it's a square table with eight people, so it's a different case.

But let me think again about the Burnside's lemma in this smaller case.

So, the key is that in the square table, each side is adjacent, so the pairs can't be just any two people, but have to stay on the sides.

Therefore, the number of fixed arrangements under rotation is non-trivial, as it's not just a simple rotation.

Therefore, in the original problem, the number is 642, as computed earlier.

Wait, but I can see that in the four-seat table, the answer is 6, which is (4-1)! / 2 = 3! / 2 = 3, but that was a different problem.

Wait, but in the four-seat table, if we have four seats around a square, each side having one person, then the number of distinct arrangements considering rotations and reflections is 6, as above.

But in our original problem, with eight seats around a square table, each side having two people, the number is 642.

So, 642 is the correct answer.

Wait, but why did Burnside's lemma give 642? Because in that case, each reflection and rotation affects the fixed arrangements differently.

Wait, in the four-seat table, the number of fixed arrangements under 180째 rotation is 6, which is equal to 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6.

Similarly, in the eight-seat square table, the number of fixed arrangements under 180째 rotation is 24, as computed earlier.

Similarly, the number under reflections is different.

Therefore, the calculation seems correct.

Therefore, the number of distinct seating arrangements is 642.

Wait, but in the first approach, when we fixed one person's seat, we divided by 4, getting 1260, which is higher than the Burnside's lemma result.

Therefore, I think the answer should be 642.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Burnside's lemma.

Wait, let me check the fixed arrangements again.

For the 180째 rotation: fixed arrangements: 24.

For each reflection through a side: 24.

For each reflection through a corner: 12.

Wait, 5040 + 0 + 0 + 24 + 48 + 24 = 5136.

5136 / 8 = 642.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, another approach is to model the square table as a graph where each side is an edge connecting two vertices (seats), and each vertex is connected to two edges.

Wait, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the problem as arranging the eight people into the eight seats, considering that each side has two people.

Since each side is a pair, it's similar to arranging four pairs around the square.

In that case, the number of distinct arrangements is equal to the number of ways to arrange four pairs around the square, considering rotations and reflections.

Therefore, the number is (4-1)! * (2!)^4 / 2.

Wait, but why divided by 2?

Because the square can be rotated and flipped, so we divide by the number of symmetries.

Wait, no, the formula is (number of ways to arrange pairs) * (number of pair arrangements) / (number of symmetries).

Wait, perhaps it's (4-1)! * (2!)^4 / 2.

So, 6 * 16 / 2 = 6 * 8 = 48.

Wait, that's not matching 642.

Wait, maybe that approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, the number is (number of ways to arrange four pairs) * (number of ways to arrange people in each pair) / (number of symmetries).

But the number of ways to arrange four pairs is 4! / 2^4, since each pair can be arranged in 2! ways.

But since the square can be rotated and flipped, the number of symmetries is 8.

Therefore, number of distinct arrangements is (4! / 2^4) * (2!)^4 / 8.

Which simplifies to (24 / 16) * 16 / 8 = (1.5) * 2 = 3.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, that approach is flawed because the formula isn't directly applicable.

Alternatively, maybe it's (4! / 8) * (2!)^4.

Which is (24 / 8) * 16 = 3 * 16 = 48.

But that's also wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that Burnside's lemma gives 642, which is the correct answer, and the other approaches are incorrect.

Therefore, I should go with 642.

Wait, but in the Burnside's lemma approach, the number is 642, but in the four-seat table, it's 6.

So, that seems to be consistent.

Thus, the answer is 642.

But wait, just to make sure, let me compute 7! / (4 * 2) = 5040 / 8 = 630.

Wait, that's different from 642.

Wait, so 630 vs 642.

Hmm, now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps in the Burnside's lemma, I have to consider that the square table is fixed, so the number of symmetries is 8, but maybe the number of fixed arrangements is different.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, in the four-seat table, the answer is 6, which is 4! / (4 * 2) = 6.

Similarly, in the eight-seat square table, it's 8! / (8 * 2) = 5040 / 8 = 630.

But in the Burnside's lemma approach, I have 642.

Wait, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps 8! / (8 * 2) is not correct, because in the four-seat table, the rotation is 90째, and the number of fixed arrangements is zero, whereas in the eight-seat table, the number of fixed arrangements under a rotation is non-zero.

Therefore, perhaps 8! / (8 * 2) is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fixed arrangements under rotations and reflections.

Therefore, Burnside's lemma is the correct approach, and the number is 642.

Hence, the answer is 642.

Wait, but let me check online, but since I can't, I need to think.

Wait, another way: the number of distinct arrangements around a square table with four sides, each side having two people, is equal to (number of ways to arrange eight people) divided by the number of symmetries, but adjusted for fixed arrangements.

But in our case, it's similar to arranging people around the square, which is a different structure than a circular table.

So, given that, I think Burnside's lemma is the proper approach, giving 642.

Therefore, the answer is 642.

Wait, but the problem is in the original statement: "In how many ways can 8 people be seated around a square table with 2 people on a side?"

It's a square table, so each side has two seats, meaning each side is adjacent to two seats, which are on either end.

So, each side is a pair, which is on the two seats.

Therefore, the problem is equivalent to arranging eight people around a square table where each side has two people, and the table has four sides.

So, in that case, the number of distinct arrangements is 642.

Therefore, the answer is 642.

Wait, but the original problem in the first approach was that, fixing a person's seat, you get 7! / 4 = 1260, but Burnside's lemma gives 642, which is different.

So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the confusion is whether the square table is considered as a circular table with four sides, each of which has two seats.

In that case, the number of distinct arrangements is 642.

But in the first approach, it's treating each side as a pair, so the number of distinct arrangements is similar to arranging four pairs around a circle, but with four sides, each side containing two people.

Wait, but in that case, the number of arrangements is (4-1)! * (2!)^4 / 2.

Wait, that gives 6 * 16 / 2 = 48.

But that's way lower than 642.

Wait, so I'm stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I should accept that Burnside's lemma gives 642, which is the correct answer.

Therefore, the answer is 642.

But, to make sure, let me think of another approach.

Suppose I fix one seat on one corner. Then, the two seats adjacent to it (on the sides) are fixed with two people.

Then, for the remaining six seats, I have to arrange the remaining six people.

But, since the table is square, the opposite sides are symmetric.

So, perhaps, after fixing one seat, we can arrange the remaining six seats in a line.

But, no, because it's a square, so the arrangement is cyclic.

Wait, perhaps the number of distinct arrangements is (8-1)! / 8 = 7! / 8 = 5040 / 8 = 630.

But that's similar to the initial approach.

But in Burnside's lemma, it's 642.

Therefore, which is correct?

Wait, now I'm really confused.

Wait, let me think of it as arranging the eight people around the square table, with each side having two people.

So, for each side, it's like placing two people on that side.

So, the number of ways is equal to the number of ways to partition the eight people into four pairs, each pair being assigned to a side, and then arranging each pair on their respective side.

But then, the number of such arrangements is 4! * (2!)^4 / 8.

Because:

- 4! ways to assign the four pairs to the four sides.

- (2!)^4 ways to arrange each pair on their respective side.

- Divided by 8 for rotational symmetry.

So, 24 * 16 / 8 = 24 * 2 = 48.

But that's way lower than 642.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 4! * (2!)^4 * 8 / 8 = 24 * 16 = 384.

But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, in the four-seat table, the number of distinct seating arrangements is 6, which is 4! / (4 * 2) = 6.

Similarly, in the eight-seat square table, the number of distinct arrangements is 8! / (8 * 2) = 5040 / 8 = 630.

But in Burnside's lemma, it's 642.

Therefore, perhaps 630 is correct, and 642 is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the four-seat table, the number is 6, but in the eight-seat square table, the number is 630, which is 8! / (8 * 2) = 630.

But why does Burnside's lemma give 642?

Wait, perhaps because I didn't account for something in the Burnside's lemma approach.

Wait, in the Burnside's lemma, I considered the dihedral group of order 8, which includes four rotations and four reflections.

But when I calculated the fixed arrangements, I considered that for each reflection, fixed arrangements were 12, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps for the reflections through corners, the fixed arrangements are less.

Wait, for a reflection through a corner, say, top-left corner, swapping two pairs.

So, for each reflection, the number of fixed arrangements is the number of ways to arrange the people so that the pairs are symmetric.

But perhaps for reflections through corners, the fixed arrangements are 12, as calculated.

But for reflections through sides, the fixed arrangements are 24.

But in that case, total fixed arrangements: 5040 + 0 + 0 + 24 + 48 + 24 = 5136.

Divide by 8: 5136 / 8 = 642.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in the Burnside's lemma approach, I didn't account for the fact that in the square, the sides are adjacent, so the pairs can't be just any two people, but must be on the sides.

Therefore, the number of fixed arrangements under reflections through sides is 24, which is same as if it's a circular table.

But for reflections through corners, the fixed arrangements are different.

Wait, maybe it's 12.

Wait, if I fix a corner, then the reflection swaps two pairs, so the number of fixed arrangements is the number of ways to arrange the four people in the swapped pairs, which is 4! / 2 = 12.

Therefore, for each reflection through a corner, fixed arrangements: 12.

Therefore, total fixed arrangements: 5040 + 0 + 0 + 24 + 48 + 24 = 5136.

Which is 5136 / 8 = 642.

Therefore, the answer is 642.

But I'm not sure, because in the four-seat table, the Burnside's lemma gives 6, which is correct, but in the eight-seat square table, it's 642.

But in the four-seat table, the number is 6, which is 4! / (4 * 2) = 6, so perhaps the formula is correct.

Therefore, I think the answer is 642.

But earlier, I was thinking that 8! / 8 = 630, which is 5040 / 8 = 630.

But 630 is not equal to 642, so perhaps 630 is incorrect.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is 642.

Wait, but now, I'm really confused because I'm getting two different answers.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the number of fixed arrangements under rotations and reflections is different.

Wait, in the four-seat table, it's 6, which is 4! / (4 * 2).

Similarly, in the square table, perhaps it's 8! / (8 * 2) = 630.

But in Burnside's lemma, I got 642.

Wait, perhaps 642 is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me think of the square table as a graph.

Each seat is a node, and edges connect adjacent seats. But that might not help.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the answer is 642, as per Burnside's lemma.

Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 642.

Hence, I will go with that.

**Final Answer**
The number of ways is \boxed{642}.
</think>

To determine the number of ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we need to consider the symmetries of the square table, which include rotations and reflections. This problem can be approached using Burnside's lemma, which helps count the number of distinct arrangements under group actions (rotations and reflections).

1. **Identify the group actions**: The symmetries of a square table form the dihedral group of order 8, which includes 4 rotations (0째, 90째, 180째, 270째) and 4 reflections (over sides and over corners).

2. **Calculate fixed arrangements for each symmetry**:
   - **Identity rotation (0째)**: Fixes all arrangements. The number of fixed arrangements is \(8! = 40320\).
   - **90째 and 270째 rotations**: No fixed arrangements because rotating the table 90째 or 270째 would require all people to be the same, which they are not.
   - **180째 rotation**: Fixes arrangements where each pair of opposite seats must be the same. The number of fixed arrangements is \(4! = 24\).
   - **Reflections over sides (2 reflections)**: Each reflection swaps two pairs of seats. The number of fixed arrangements is \(\frac{4!}{2} = 12\).
   - **Reflections over corners (2 reflections)**: Each reflection swaps two pairs of seats. The number of fixed arrangements is \(\frac{4!}{2} = 12\).

3. **Sum the fixed arrangements**:
   - Identity: \(40320\)
   - 90째 and 270째 rotations: \(0\)
   - 180째 rotation: \(24\)
   - Reflections over sides: \(12 + 12 = 24\)
   - Reflections over corners: \(12 + 12 = 24\)

   Total fixed arrangements: \(40320 + 0 + 24 + 24 + 24 = 40440\).

4. **Apply Burnside's lemma**: The number of distinct arrangements is the average number of fixed arrangements divided by the order of the group (8).

   \[
   \text{Number of distinct arrangements} = \frac{40440}{8} = 5055
   \]

However, upon re-evaluation, it was realized that the correct approach using Burnside's lemma should consider the number of ways to arrange the people such that each side has two people, which is a different problem structure. The correct approach using Burnside's lemma gives the number of distinct arrangements as \(642\).

\[
\boxed{642}
\]
