Question:
Find the sum of all complex solutions of the equation
\[\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\]

Correct Answer:
We can add 4 to both sides to get
\[\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + 1 + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + 1 + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + 1 + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} + 1 = 2010x.\]This simplifies to
\[\frac{x^2}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x.\]We see that $x = 0$ is a solution (which does not affect our sum).  Otherwise, we can divide both sides by $x$:
\[\frac{x}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{x}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{x}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{x}{x^2 - 4} = 2010.\]Clearing the denominators, we get
\begin{align*}
&x(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + x(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + x(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + x(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) \\
&\quad = 2010(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4).
\end{align*}This expands to
\[4x^7 + \dotsb = 2010x^8 + \dotsb,\]where only terms that have degree 7 or greater are shown.  Then
\[2010x^8 - 4x^7 + \dotsb = 0,\]so by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $\frac{4}{2010} = \boxed{\frac{2}{1005}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

And I need to find the sum of all complex solutions. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I notice that the denominators are in the form \(x^2 - k\), where \(k\) is from 1 to 4. So, maybe I can rewrite each term as something else or find a common denominator. But before jumping into that, let me see if I can simplify the equation somehow.

Looking at the left-hand side (LHS), it's a sum of four fractions, each with a linear coefficient in the numerator and a quadratic denominator. The right-hand side (RHS) is a linear function, \(2010x - 4\). Since the LHS is a sum of rational functions and the RHS is linear, this might be a bit complicated. But perhaps I can make a substitution to simplify things.

Let me set \(y = x^2\). Then, each term in the LHS becomes something like \(\frac{k}{y - k}\). So, substituting, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{y - 1} + \frac{2}{y - 2} + \frac{3}{y - 3} + \frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Hmm, but now we have both \(y\) and \(x\) in the equation. Since \(y = x^2\), maybe I can express \(x\) in terms of \(y\). However, that might complicate things because \(x\) is a square root of \(y\), which introduces square roots into the equation. That might not be helpful directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can bring all terms to one side and set the equation to zero. Let's try that.

Starting from the original equation:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.
\]

Let me denote this as \(f(x) = 0\). So, \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4\).

Since it's a complex equation, the solutions might include both real and complex numbers. But I need the sum of all complex solutions. Let me recall that for a polynomial equation, the sum of all roots is given by -b/a, where the polynomial is written as \(ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \dots\). But here, the equation isn't a polynomial because of the denominators. So, maybe I can manipulate it to get a polynomial.

To do that, I'll need to find a common denominator for all the terms in the LHS. Let's see, the denominators are \(x^2 - 1\), \(x^2 - 2\), \(x^2 - 3\), \(x^2 - 4\). So, the common denominator would be the product of all these terms, which is:

\[
(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)
\]

That seems pretty complicated, but let's proceed.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by this common denominator:

\[
(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} \right) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) \cdot (2010x - 4)
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:

For each term, when multiplied by the common denominator, the denominator cancels out:

\[
1 \cdot (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)
\]

So, the equation becomes:

\[
1 \cdot (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)(2010x - 4)
\]

Now, let's denote \(y = x^2\). Then, the equation becomes:

Left-hand side (LHS):

\[
1 \cdot (y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4) + 2 \cdot (y - 1)(y - 3)(y - 4) + 3 \cdot (y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 4) + 4 \cdot (y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)
\]

Right-hand side (RHS):

\[
(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4)(2010x - 4)
\]

Hmm, but \(x\) is still present on the RHS. Since we set \(y = x^2\), which is \(x^2\), \(x\) can be either \(\sqrt{y}\) or \(-\sqrt{y}\). That complicates things because \(x\) isn't just \(y\); it's more complicated.

Wait, maybe I can express \(x\) in terms of \(y\). If \(y = x^2\), then \(x = \sqrt{y}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{y}\), but since we're dealing with complex numbers, I think we can write \(x\) as \( \pm \sqrt{y} \). Hmm, but in the RHS of the equation, we have \(2010x - 4\). So, if \(x\) is expressed as \( \sqrt{y} \) or \(-\sqrt{y} \), then the RHS becomes \(2010\sqrt{y} - 4\) or \(-2010\sqrt{y} - 4\).

But now, the equation becomes:

\[
\text{LHS}(y) = \text{RHS}(y, x) = (y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4)(2010x - 4)
\]

But \(x\) is either \(\sqrt{y}\) or \(-\sqrt{y}\), so this seems messy. Maybe I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of substituting \(y = x^2\), I can instead consider that the equation is a rational function in \(x^2\). Maybe I can perform partial fraction decomposition or find a way to combine terms.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the equation can be rewritten as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{x^2 - k} = 2010x - 4
\]

So, let me think about this. Maybe I can write each term as \(\frac{k}{x^2 - k} = \frac{k}{(x - \sqrt{k})(x + \sqrt{k})}\). But I don't know if that's helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the function \(f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{x^2 - k} - 2010x + 4\), and I need to find the sum of all roots of \(f(x) = 0\).

In general, for a function \(f(x)\), the sum of its roots is given by the negative of the coefficient of \(x^{n-1}\) divided by the coefficient of \(x^n\), provided that \(f(x)\) is a polynomial. But here, \(f(x)\) isn't a polynomial because of the denominators. Hmm, so that approach might not work directly.

But perhaps, if I can rewrite the equation in terms of a polynomial equation, then I can use Vieta's formula to find the sum of roots.

Let me try that. Let's multiply both sides by the common denominator, which is \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\). As I did earlier, this gives:

\[
1 \cdot (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)(2010x - 4)
\]

So, expanding the left side and the right side, and then bringing everything to one side, we get a polynomial equation in \(x^2\). Let me denote \(y = x^2\) for simplicity. Then, the equation becomes:

Left-hand side (LHS):

\[
1 \cdot (y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4) + 2 \cdot (y - 1)(y - 3)(y - 4) + 3 \cdot (y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 4) + 4 \cdot (y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)
\]

Right-hand side (RHS):

\[
(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4)(2010x - 4)
\]

But since \(y = x^2\), \(x = \sqrt{y}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{y}\). So, plugging this back into the RHS, we have:

RHS = \[
(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4)(2010\sqrt{y} - 4) \quad \text{or} \quad (y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4)(-2010\sqrt{y} - 4)
\]

Wait, but this seems complicated because of the square roots. Maybe instead of trying to express in terms of \(y\), I can consider that the equation is a rational function in \(x\), and perhaps I can analyze its behavior or find some symmetry.

Wait, let me think about the equation:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{x^2 - k} = 2010x - 4
\]

If I set \(x = \sqrt{y}\), then \(x^2 = y\), so we have:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{y - k} = 2010\sqrt{y} - 4
\]

But this seems to link \(y\) and \(\sqrt{y}\), which complicates things because \(y\) is \(x^2\).

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the function \(f(x)\) as a combination of terms and try to find its roots. Since the equation is \(f(x) = 0\), where:

\[
f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{x^2 - k} - 2010x + 4
\]

I can consider this as a function that has poles at \(x = \pm 1, \pm \sqrt{2}, \pm \sqrt{3}, \pm 2\). So, the function is undefined at these points. Then, we can think about the behavior of \(f(x)\) around these poles.

But Vieta's formula only applies to polynomial equations, so perhaps I need a different approach.

Wait, another idea. Maybe I can write the equation in terms of \(x^2\). Let me see.

Let me denote \(z = x^2\), then \(x = \sqrt{z}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{z}\). Then, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{z - 1} + \frac{2}{z - 2} + \frac{3}{z - 3} + \frac{4}{z - 4} = 2010\sqrt{z} - 4
\]

Hmm, but now we have both \(z\) and \(\sqrt{z}\). Maybe if I consider squaring both sides, but that could introduce extraneous solutions. Alternatively, maybe I can consider substituting \(t = \sqrt{z}\), so \(z = t^2\), which would give:

\[
\frac{1}{t^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{t^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{t^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{t^2 - 4} = 2010t - 4
\]

Wait, but that's similar to the original equation but now in terms of \(t\). Hmm, not sure if this is helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the original equation, when multiplied by the common denominator, becomes a polynomial equation in \(x^2\). Let me see.

Earlier, I had:

\[
LHS = (y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4) + 2(y - 1)(y - 3)(y - 4) + 3(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 4) + 4(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)
\]

And RHS is \((y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4)(2010x - 4)\).

So, if I expand both sides, I can get a polynomial equation in \(y\) and \(x\). But this seems too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the equation is a rational function in \(x\), so perhaps I can perform partial fractions or find a substitution that can make it a polynomial.

Wait, another idea: Let me define \(u = x^2\). Then, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{u - 1} + \frac{2}{u - 2} + \frac{3}{u - 3} + \frac{4}{u - 4} = 2010x - 4
\]

But \(u = x^2\), which is \(x^2\), so \(x = \sqrt{u}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{u}\). So, substituting back, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{u - 1} + \frac{2}{u - 2} + \frac{3}{u - 3} + \frac{4}{u - 4} = 2010\sqrt{u} - 4 \quad \text{or} \quad 2010(-\sqrt{u}) - 4
\]

But this seems messy because now we have both \(\sqrt{u}\) and \(u\) in the equation. Maybe I can use substitution for \(\sqrt{u}\). Let me set \(v = \sqrt{u}\), so \(u = v^2\), and \(x = v\) or \(x = -v\). Then, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{v^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{v^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{v^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{v^2 - 4} = 2010v - 4 \quad \text{or} \quad 2010(-v) - 4
\]

But this is similar to the original equation, just with \(v\) instead of \(x\). Hmm, so perhaps I can define \(g(v) = \frac{1}{v^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{v^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{v^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{v^2 - 4} - 2010v + 4 = 0\), and \(h(v) = \frac{1}{v^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{v^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{v^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{v^2 - 4} + 2010v + 4 = 0\).

So, the original equation is \(g(v) = 0\) or \(h(v) = 0\). But these are two separate equations. Hmm, perhaps I can find the roots of \(g(v)\) and \(h(v)\) separately and then combine them.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that \(g(v) = -h(-v)\), but let me check:

Compute \(g(-v)\):

\[
g(-v) = \frac{1}{(-v)^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{(-v)^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{(-v)^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{(-v)^2 - 4} - 2010(-v) + 4
\]

Simplify:

\[
g(-v) = \frac{1}{v^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{v^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{v^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{v^2 - 4} + 2010v + 4
\]

Which is equal to \(h(v)\). So, \(g(-v) = h(v)\). So, if \(v\) is a root of \(g(v) = 0\), then \(-v\) is a root of \(g(-v) = h(v) = 0\). But this might not directly help.

Wait, but in our original equation, we have two cases: \(2010x - 4\) equals either \(2010v - 4\) or \(-2010v - 4\). So, perhaps if I consider \(g(v) = 0\) and \(g(-v) + 4 = 0\), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since \(g(-v) = h(v)\), maybe I can relate the roots of \(g(v) = 0\) and \(h(v) = 0\). But I'm not sure. Maybe this is getting too convoluted.

Let me step back. The equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4
\]

I need to find all complex solutions, and their sum.

I recall that for equations of the form \(f(x) = 0\), the sum of all roots is related to the coefficients of the polynomial, but in this case, it's not a polynomial because of the denominators. So, perhaps that approach isn't directly applicable.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I can write the equation in terms of \(x^2\), and then make a substitution.

Let me define \(y = x^2\), then the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{y - 1} + \frac{2}{y - 2} + \frac{3}{y - 3} + \frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4
\]

But \(x = \sqrt{y}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{y}\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{y - 1} + \frac{2}{y - 2} + \frac{3}{y - 3} + \frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010\sqrt{y} - 4 \quad \text{or} \quad -2010\sqrt{y} - 4
\]

So, for each \(y\), there can be two solutions for \(x\): \(\sqrt{y}\) and \(-\sqrt{y}\), unless \(\sqrt{y}\) is real or something. Hmm, so perhaps the solutions for \(y\) would correspond to the roots of the equation, each giving two \(x\) solutions.

But this seems similar to what I thought earlier. Maybe I can consider that for each \(y\), which is \(x^2\), the equation relates to \(x\), but again, it's not a polynomial.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the function \(f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{x^2 - k} - 2010x + 4\). Then, the roots are the solutions to \(f(x) = 0\). So, perhaps I can consider the function \(f(x)\) and analyze its properties.

Since \(f(x)\) is a rational function, it's defined everywhere except at \(x = \pm 1, \pm \sqrt{2}, \pm \sqrt{3}, \pm 2\). The function has vertical asymptotes at these points. Now, the sum of the roots of \(f(x) = 0\) is the sum of all \(x\) such that \(f(x) = 0\).

But again, since \(f(x)\) isn't a polynomial, Vieta's formula doesn't apply directly. So, maybe I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the equation as a function of \(x^2\). Let me define \(y = x^2\), so that:

\[
f(y) = \frac{1}{y - 1} + \frac{2}{y - 2} + \frac{3}{y - 3} + \frac{4}{y - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0
\]

But again, this introduces \(x\) in the equation, which is a function of \(y\). So, unless I can express \(x\) in terms of \(y\), which complicates things, I can't directly apply Vieta's formula.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each solution \(x\) gives a solution \(y = x^2\), so maybe I can relate the roots of \(f(x) = 0\) to the roots of some polynomial equation in \(y\). But since \(f(x)\) is not a polynomial, that might not help.

Wait, another idea. Let me consider the original equation again:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4
\]

Let me denote \(x^2 = t\), so \(x = \sqrt{t}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{t}\). Then, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{t - 1} + \frac{2}{t - 2} + \frac{3}{t - 3} + \frac{4}{t - 4} = 2010\sqrt{t} - 4 \quad \text{or} \quad -2010\sqrt{t} - 4
\]

So, for each \(t\), there are two solutions for \(x\), except when \(\sqrt{t}\) is real, i.e., when \(t \geq 0\).

But perhaps if I can define a function \(g(t) = f(x)\), where \(f(x)\) is the original equation, then maybe I can find the sum of all roots \(t\) such that \(g(t) = 0\), and then relate back to \(x\).

But again, this seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of symmetric sums or something. Since the equation is in terms of \(x^2\), perhaps I can consider the sum of the roots in terms of \(x^2\).

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each solution \(x\) will satisfy a certain equation, and maybe sum over all such \(x\).

Wait, let me think about the function \(f(x)\) again:

\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4
\]

I can think of this function as \(f(x) = 0\), and I need to find all complex \(x\) such that this holds.

But in complex analysis, the sum of all roots of a polynomial is given by the negative coefficient of \(x^{n-1}\) divided by the leading coefficient. However, since \(f(x)\) isn't a polynomial, that doesn't apply here.

Wait, perhaps I can make an observation about the function's behavior. Let me consider that the function \(f(x)\) is analytic except at its poles \(x = \pm 1, \pm \sqrt{2}, \pm \sqrt{3}, \pm 2\). The sum of all complex solutions is related to the number of solutions and their residues, but I don't recall such a theorem.

Wait, another thought: Maybe consider a substitution where I set \(x = \sqrt{y}\), so \(y = x^2\), and then write the equation in terms of \(y\), but then we have both \(y\) and \(\sqrt{y}\), which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can consider multiplying both sides by \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\), which I tried earlier, but perhaps I can find a way to express the resulting equation as a polynomial.

Let me try that.

Multiplying both sides by \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\), we have:

\[
\left( \sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{x^2 - k} \right) \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) = (2010x - 4) \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)
\]

Let me denote the left-hand side as \(LHS\) and the right-hand side as \(RHS\).

So, expanding \(LHS\):

Each term in the sum is \(\frac{k}{x^2 - k} \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\).

So, for each \(k\), the term is:

\[
\frac{k}{x^2 - k} \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) = k \times \frac{(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)}{x^2 - k}
\]

So, \(LHS = \sum_{k=1}^4 k \times \frac{(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)}{x^2 - k}\)

Similarly, \(RHS = (2010x - 4) \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\)

So, bringing everything to one side:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 k \times \frac{(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)}{x^2 - k} - (2010x - 4) \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) = 0
\]

Factor out \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\):

\[
(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) \left( \sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{x^2 - k} - (2010x - 4) \right) = 0
\]

So, either \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) = 0\) or the sum inside the parentheses equals zero.

But \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) = 0\) implies \(x^2 = 1, 2, 3, 4\), so \(x = \pm 1, \pm \sqrt{2}, \pm \sqrt{3}, \pm 2\). These are the poles of the original equation, so they are not solutions to \(f(x) = 0\).

Therefore, the solutions to \(f(x) = 0\) must satisfy the equation:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{x^2 - k} - (2010x - 4) = 0
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{x^2 - k} = 2010x - 4
\]

But we can write this as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{x^2 - k} - 2010x + 4 = 0
\]

So, in this form, the equation is a rational function in \(x^2\), but not a polynomial.

Wait, if I let \(y = x^2\), then:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{y - k} - 2010x + 4 = 0
\]

But \(x = \sqrt{y}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{y}\), so:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{y - k} - 2010\sqrt{y} + 4 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{y - k} + 2010\sqrt{y} + 4 = 0
\]

So, each equation corresponds to \(x = \sqrt{y}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{y}\). So, for each \(y\), there are two \(x\)s, except when \(y = 0\), which would give \(x = 0\), but \(x = 0\) isn't a solution because plugging into the original equation would give undefined terms.

So, perhaps I can think of \(y\) as a variable and consider both equations:

1. \(\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{y - k} - 2010\sqrt{y} + 4 = 0\)
2. \(\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{y - k} + 2010\sqrt{y} + 4 = 0\)

But this seems to complicate things further because now I have two separate equations in terms of \(y\) and \(\sqrt{y}\). Maybe I can consider that \(y\) is a variable, and thus, for each \(y\), there are two \(x\)s.

But I'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I can consider the sum of all roots in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial when we express the equation in terms of \(y\). But since the equation is non-polynomial, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Wait, let me think about the function \(f(x)\). It's equal to zero, so the sum of all roots is equal to the negative coefficient of \(x^{n-1}\) in the polynomial, if it were a polynomial. But since it isn't a polynomial, this doesn't apply.

Wait, but maybe I can make a substitution such that I can express this as a polynomial. Let me think.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can consider that for each solution \(x\), it's paired with \(-x\). So, if \(x\) is a solution, then \(-x\) is also a solution. Then, the sum of all solutions would be the sum of all \(x\) and \(-x\), which would cancel out unless there are solutions where \(x = 0\), but in this case, \(x = 0\) is not a solution because plugging into the original equation gives undefined terms.

Wait, but if \(x\) is a solution, then \(-x\) is also a solution, so their sum is zero. But then, what about the rest of the solutions?

Wait, but maybe I can consider that the equation is symmetric in some way. Let me see:

The equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4
\]

Not symmetric, because the left side is in terms of \(x^2\), while the right side is linear in \(x\). So, it's not symmetric.

Wait, but maybe if I consider that for each solution \(x\), there is a corresponding solution \(-x\), then the sum of all solutions would be zero, except for solutions where \(x = 0\), which we've already established isn't a solution. But wait, that might not necessarily be true because the equation is not symmetric, so it's possible that some solutions come in pairs that don't cancel each other.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the function \(f(x)\) and see if it's an odd function or has some symmetry.

Let me check if \(f(-x) = -f(x)\). Let's compute \(f(-x)\):

\[
f(-x) = \frac{1}{(-x)^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{(-x)^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{(-x)^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{(-x)^2 - 4} - 2010(-x) + 4
\]

Simplify:

\[
f(-x) = \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} + 2010x + 4
\]

Compare this to the original \(f(x)\):

\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4
\]

So, \(f(-x) = f(x) + 4020x\). Therefore, \(f(-x) \neq -f(x)\), so the function is not odd. Therefore, the solutions don't necessarily come in pairs that sum to zero.

Hmm, that complicates things. So, my earlier thought about pairing solutions \(x\) and \(-x\) was incorrect because the function isn't odd.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can consider that the equation can be transformed into a polynomial by multiplying through by the appropriate denominators. But as I tried earlier, this leads to a high-degree polynomial, which might not be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is given by the negative coefficient of \(x^{n-1}\) divided by the leading coefficient. But since this isn't a polynomial, maybe I can think of the sum of all roots as the sum over all solutions, regardless of whether they come from different equations.

Wait, but in the original equation, the solutions are not necessarily roots of a polynomial, so the sum of all roots isn't directly given by Vieta's formula.

Wait, perhaps another angle: Let me consider that \(x^2\) is a variable, say \(y\), and then the equation in terms of \(y\) is a rational function equal to a linear function in \(\sqrt{y}\). So, perhaps we can set \(z = \sqrt{y}\), and then the equation becomes:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{z^2 - k} = 2010z - 4 \quad \text{or} \quad \sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{z^2 - k} = -2010z - 4
\]

But I still have \(z\) and \(\sqrt{y}\) related, which isn't helpful.

Wait, maybe I can think about the original equation as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{x^2 - k} = 2010x - 4
\]

Which can be written as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{x^2 - k} - 2010x + 4 = 0
\]

But I don't see how to make this a polynomial.

Wait, another idea: Maybe consider that the left side is a rational function, and the right side is linear in \(x\), so perhaps I can find the sum of the solutions by considering the equation as a rational function equation.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the equation as \(f(x) = 0\), where \(f(x)\) is a rational function. Then, the solutions are the roots of the equation \(f(x) = 0\). To find the sum of all roots, I can consider the equation as \(f(x) = 0\), and then use the formula for the sum of roots of a rational function, but I think that's not a standard concept.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of partial fractions or residues, but that seems too advanced.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the sum of all roots is equal to the negative coefficient of the term with the highest power of \(x\) divided by the coefficient of \(x^{n}\), but this is only for polynomials.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let me consider that the equation can be thought of as a function \(f(x)\), and I need to find all \(x\) where \(f(x) = 0\). Then, the sum of all roots is equal to the sum over all such \(x\).

But again, without knowing the exact roots, this is difficult. Unless I can find a clever substitution or transformation.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can consider the function \(f(x)\) as a combination of multiple functions, each of which has a known sum of roots. For example, if I can split the equation into two separate equations, each of which is a rational function, then perhaps I can find the sum of roots for each equation and add them up.

Wait, let me try that.

From the original equation:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4
\]

Let me denote:

\[
A = \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} = \text{terms without } x
\]
\[
B = \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = \text{other terms without } x
\]

Then, the equation becomes:

\[
A + B = 2010x - 4
\]

But this still doesn't help because \(A\) and \(B\) are both functions of \(x^2\), and it's unclear how this splits into separate equations.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that \(A\) and \(B\) are each functions of \(x^2\), so for each \(x\), \(A\) and \(B\) have specific values, but I still can't separate \(x\) from \(x^2\).

Wait, another thought: Maybe I can consider that each term \(\frac{k}{x^2 - k}\) can be written as \(\frac{k}{(x - \sqrt{k})(x + \sqrt{k})}\). But I don't see how that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the function \(f(x)\) as a sum of terms each of which is a rational function, but again, it's not a polynomial.

Wait, maybe I can think about the function \(f(x)\) as a function with poles at \(x = \pm1, \pm\sqrt{2}, \pm\sqrt{3}, \pm2\), and try to analyze its behavior around these poles. But that seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the function \(f(x)\) as being of the form \(P(x)/Q(x)\), where \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) are polynomials. Then, the equation \(P(x)/Q(x) = 2010x - 4\) would imply that \(P(x) = (2010x - 4) Q(x)\), leading to a polynomial equation. But in our case, \(f(x)\) is not a ratio of two polynomials because of the denominators, so this might not apply.

Wait, unless I consider the denominators as part of the polynomial. So, if I let \(f(x)\) be the left-hand side:

\[
f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{x^2 - k} - 2010x + 4
\]

Then, \(f(x)\) would have poles at \(x = \pm1, \pm\sqrt{2}, \pm\sqrt{3}, \pm2\), so it's not a polynomial. Therefore, it's not possible to express \(f(x)\) as a ratio of two polynomials, so Vieta's formula doesn't apply.

Hmm, this is getting quite complicated. Maybe I need to step back and think differently.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to find all roots, maybe I can consider that for each \(x\), there are corresponding \(y = x^2\), and perhaps the sum of \(x\) and \(-x\) can be found, but I don't know.

Wait, another idea: Let me consider that each solution \(x\) satisfies the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4
\]

Let me denote \(y = x^2\), so \(x = \sqrt{y}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{y}\). Then, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{y - 1} + \frac{2}{y - 2} + \frac{3}{y - 3} + \frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010\sqrt{y} - 4 \quad \text{or} \quad -2010\sqrt{y} - 4
\]

So, for each \(y\), there are two \(x\)s. So, maybe I can consider that the sum of all \(x\)s is equal to the sum over all \(y\)s of \(2\sqrt{y} + 2(-\sqrt{y}) = 0\). But this is only true if for each \(y\), the two \(x\)s cancel each other out, which is not the case because \(x = \sqrt{y}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{y}\) are distinct roots unless \(y = 0\).

Wait, but if I consider both solutions for each \(y\), the sum would be zero, but in reality, each \(y\) corresponds to two \(x\)s, so unless the function is odd, which it's not, their sum isn't zero.

Wait, but maybe if I sum over all \(x\)s, each pair contributes a sum of zero, but that's only if the function is odd. But the function isn't odd, so this reasoning is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the function \(f(x)\) as having a certain symmetry. If I denote \(f(x)\) as:

\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4
\]

Then, \(f(-x)\) is:

\[
f(-x) = \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} + 2010x + 4
\]

Which is equal to \(f(x) + 4020x\). So, \(f(-x) = f(x) + 4020x\). Therefore, \(f(-x) - f(x) = 4020x\).

Now, if I consider \(f(x)\) as a function and think about the sum of its roots, perhaps I can consider the integral of its derivative over some interval, but that seems too vague.

Wait, another angle: Maybe consider the sum of all solutions as the negative coefficient of \(x^{n-1}\) in a polynomial obtained by multiplying both sides by the necessary factors. But since it's not a polynomial, this might not work.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to find the roots explicitly, I can consider that the sum of all roots is equal to the sum of all \(x\)s, each of which satisfies the equation. But without knowing the exact structure, it's difficult.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that if \(x\) is a root, then so is \(-x\), but as we saw earlier, that's not the case because \(f(x)\) isn't odd. So, perhaps the sum isn't zero. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the function \(f(x)\) has a certain number of roots, and perhaps the sum can be found by considering the residues or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can consider that each term in the original equation is a rational function, so maybe the sum of all roots is equal to the sum of the roots of the equation when multiplied by the denominators. But as I tried before, that leads to a high-degree polynomial, which is difficult to handle.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the original equation as:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4
\]

Let me multiply both sides by \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\), which is the common denominator. Then, we have:

\[
1 \cdot (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4 \cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = (2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)
\]

This results in a polynomial of degree 8 on the left-hand side (each term is degree 6 multiplied by 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively) and on the right-hand side, we have a degree 8 polynomial as well.

So, moving everything to the left-hand side, we get:

\[
(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) - (2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) = 0
\]

This is a polynomial equation of degree 8. The sum of all roots of this polynomial can be found by Vieta's formula, which is equal to the negative coefficient of \(x^7\) divided by the coefficient of \(x^8\).

So, let me compute the coefficient of \(x^8\) and the coefficient of \(x^7\) in this polynomial.

First, the coefficient of \(x^8\) in the left-hand side:

Each term on the left is a product of three quadratic terms, which is degree 6. When multiplied by 1, 2, 3, or 4, the highest degree is 6. However, when multiplied by the right-hand side, which is degree 8, the overall product would be degree 14, but since we have a common denominator, I think I made a mistake.

Wait, no, the left-hand side is the sum of four degree 6 polynomials, each multiplied by 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, each term is of degree 6. Therefore, the entire left-hand side is a degree 6 polynomial.

Wait, that's right. Each term on the left is a degree 6 polynomial, so the sum is a degree 6 polynomial. Therefore, when we subtract the right-hand side, which is also a degree 8 polynomial, the resulting polynomial is of degree 8.

Therefore, the degree 8 term is only present on the right-hand side. Let me compute it.

Wait, the right-hand side is \((2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\). So, when expanded, this is a degree 8 polynomial.

Let me compute its leading term:

- \(2010x \times x^2 \times x^2 \times x^2 \times x^2 = 2010x \times x^{10} = 2010x^{11}\)

Wait, but that's a degree 11 term. Wait, no, hold on: The right-hand side is \((2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\). The product \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\) is a degree 8 polynomial, so when multiplied by \(2010x\), it becomes a degree 9 polynomial. Then, subtracting \(4(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\), which is also degree 8, results in a degree 9 polynomial.

Wait, so the left-hand side is a degree 6 polynomial, the right-hand side is a degree 9 polynomial. Therefore, the entire equation is a degree 9 polynomial, so the highest degree term is on the right-hand side.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

\[
-(2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = 0
\]

Which is a degree 9 polynomial. Therefore, to find the sum of all roots, I need to compute the sum of roots of this degree 9 polynomial.

Using Vieta's formula, the sum of all roots is equal to minus the coefficient of \(x^8\) divided by the coefficient of \(x^9\).

So, let's compute the coefficient of \(x^9\) and \(x^8\).

First, the coefficient of \(x^9\):

It comes from the term \(-(2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\). The leading term of this product is \(-2010x \times x^2 \times x^2 \times x^2 \times x^2 = -2010x^{11}\). But wait, no, the polynomial is \(-(2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\), so the leading term is \(-2010x \times x^{10} = -2010x^{11}\).

But wait, the entire expression is a single term, so the coefficient of \(x^{11}\) is \(-2010\), and there are no higher degree terms because the rest of the terms are of lower degree.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The term \(-(2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\) expands to:

- The leading term: \(-2010x \times x^2 \times x^2 \times x^2 \times x^2 = -2010x^{11}\)
- The next term: \(-2010x \times (-4) \times x^2 \times x^2 \times x^2 = 8040x^{10}\)
- And so on, but for our purpose, we only need the coefficient of \(x^9\).

So, to find the coefficient of \(x^9\), we need to compute the coefficient of \(x^9\) in the expansion.

Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the coefficient of \(x^9\) directly from the expansion.

The expansion of \(-(2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\) can be considered as \(-2010x \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 4 \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\).

So, to find the coefficient of \(x^9\), we need to compute:

- The coefficient of \(x^9\) in \(-2010x \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\)
- Plus the coefficient of \(x^9\) in \(4 \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\)

First, let's compute the coefficient of \(x^9\) in \(-2010x \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\).

The polynomial \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\) is a quartic in \(x^2\), so when multiplied out, it will have terms up to \(x^8\). The coefficient of \(x^9\) in \(-2010x \times \text{polynomial}\) is equal to \(-2010\) times the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\).

Similarly, the coefficient of \(x^9\) in \(4 \times \text{polynomial}\) is 4 times the coefficient of \(x^9\) in \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\).

Therefore, let's compute the coefficients:

First, compute the coefficient of \(x^8\) in \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\). Let me denote this as \(C_8\).

When expanding \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\), the coefficient of \(x^8\) is 1. Wait, let's verify:

Each \(x^2\) term multiplied together gives \(x^8\). The coefficient is the sum of all possible products of the constants, which are \(-1 \times -2 \times -3 \times -4\). But wait, the coefficient of \(x^8\) is 1, because each term is \(x^2\), so it's just 1. Wait, no, actually, each \(x^2\) is multiplied together, so the coefficient is 1, not considering the constants.

Wait, actually, no. Let's think of it as:

\[
(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) = x^8 - (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)x^6 + (1 \times 2 + 1 \times 3 + 1 \times 4 + 2 \times 3 + 2 \times 4 + 3 \times 4)x^4 - (1 \times 2 \times 3 + 1 \times 2 \times 4 + 1 \times 3 \times 4 + 2 \times 3 \times 4)x^2 + (1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4)
\]

So, coefficient of \(x^8\) is 1.

Coefficient of \(x^6\) is \(-(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = -10\).

Coefficient of \(x^4\) is \(1 \times 2 + 1 \times 3 + 1 \times 4 + 2 \times 3 + 2 \times 4 + 3 \times 4 = 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 35\).

Coefficient of \(x^2\) is \(-(1 \times 2 \times 3 + 1 \times 2 \times 4 + 1 \times 3 \times 4 + 2 \times 3 \times 4) = -(6 + 8 + 12 + 24) = -50\).

Constant term is \(1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \(x^8\) is 1.

So, the coefficient of \(x^9\) in \(-2010x \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\) is \(-2010 \times 1 = -2010\).

Now, compute the coefficient of \(x^9\) in \(4 \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\).

The coefficient of \(x^9\) in \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\) is 0 because it's a polynomial of degree 8. So, multiplying by 4, the coefficient remains 0.

Therefore, the total coefficient of \(x^9\) in the entire expression is \(-2010 + 0 = -2010\).

Next, compute the coefficient of \(x^8\). This will come from two parts:

1. The coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(-2010x \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\), which we already found as \(-2010 \times 1 = -2010\).

2. The coefficient of \(x^8\) in \(4 \times (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\). Let's compute this.

The coefficient of \(x^8\) in the product \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\) is 1, as we found earlier. So, when multiplied by 4, the coefficient remains 4.

Therefore, the total coefficient of \(x^8\) is \(-2010 + 4 = -2006\).

Thus, the coefficient of \(x^9\) is \(-2010\), and the coefficient of \(x^8\) is \(-2006\).

So, the sum of all roots of the polynomial is equal to \(-\frac{\text{coefficient of } x^8}{\text{coefficient of } x^9} = -\frac{-2006}{-2010} = -\frac{2006}{2010}\).

Simplify this fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 2:

\[
-\frac{1003}{1005}
\]

So, the sum of all roots is \(-\frac{1003}{1005}\).

But wait, before finalizing, let me double-check my calculations because this is a critical step.

So, the coefficient of \(x^9\) is \(-2010\), and the coefficient of \(x^8\) is \(-2006\). So, the sum is:

\[
-\frac{-2006}{-2010} = -\frac{2006}{2010} = -\frac{1003}{1005}
\]

Yes, that's correct. So, the sum of all roots is \(-1003/1005\).

Let me just confirm that this is the sum of all roots, including the poles at \(x = \pm1, \pm\sqrt{2}, \pm\sqrt{3}, \pm2\). But since the polynomial includes these poles as removable singularities, the sum of all roots would indeed include them.

Wait, but in our case, the polynomial we obtained is of degree 9, so it has 9 roots (counting multiplicities). However, the original equation is undefined at \(x = \pm1, \pm\sqrt{2}, \pm\sqrt{3}, \pm2\), so those points are not roots of the equation, but the polynomial we constructed has roots at all other points.

Therefore, the sum of all roots is indeed \(-1003/1005\).

So, after all that computation, the sum of all complex solutions is \(-1003/1005\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-\dfrac{1003}{1005}}
</think>

To find the sum of all complex solutions of the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4,
\]

we start by noting that the equation is a rational function equation. We multiply both sides by the common denominator \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\) to clear the fractions:

\[
(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = (2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4).
\]

This results in a polynomial equation of degree 9. Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of all roots of a polynomial is given by the negative coefficient of the term of degree one less than the leading term, divided by the coefficient of the leading term.

After expanding and simplifying, we find the coefficients of \(x^9\) and \(x^8\) in the polynomial:

- The coefficient of \(x^9\) is \(-2010\).
- The coefficient of \(x^8\) is \(-2006\).

Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of all roots is:

\[
-\frac{-2006}{-2010} = -\frac{2006}{2010} = -\frac{1003}{1005}.
\]

Thus, the sum of all complex solutions is:

\[
\boxed{-\dfrac{1003}{1005}}
\]
