Question:
Find all the integer roots of
\[x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0.\]Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
By the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots are all the divisors of 14 (including negative divisors), which are $-14,$ $-7,$ $-2,$ $-1,$ $1,$ $2,$ $7,$ and $14.$  Checking, we find that the only integer roots are $\boxed{-2,1}.$

Gold:
-2,1

Wrong Prediction:
1,-2

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to find all the integer roots of the polynomial equation:

\[x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0.\]

Hmm, integer roots. That means I should look for values of x that are whole numbers (including negatives) that satisfy this equation. I remember that the Rational Root Theorem can help in this case. Let me recall what that theorem says.

The Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, p/q, of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients must have p as a factor of the constant term and q as a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term is -14, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots are the factors of -14 divided by the factors of 1.

Since the leading coefficient is 1, the denominator q can only be ±1. Therefore, the possible rational roots simplify to just the factors of -14, which are ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14. That gives me a list of possible integer roots: 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14.

Now, I need to test each of these values to see if they satisfy the equation. Let me start with the smaller numbers because they might be easier.

First, let me try x = 1:

Plugging into the equation: 1^4 + 5*1^3 + 9*1^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14. Let's compute that step by step.

1 + 5 is 6; 6 + 9 is 15; 15 - 1 is 14; 14 - 14 is 0. So, when x=1, the polynomial equals 0. That means x=1 is a root!

Great, so x=1 is definitely a root. Now, since x=1 is a root, I can perform polynomial division or synthetic division to factor out (x - 1) from the original polynomial. Maybe synthetic division is quicker.

Let me set up synthetic division with root 1.

The coefficients of the polynomial are: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).

Set up the synthetic division:

1 | 1   5   9   -1   -14

Start by bringing down the 1.

Multiply 1 by 1: 1, add to next coefficient: 5 + 1 = 6.

Multiply 6 by 1: 6, add to next coefficient: 9 + 6 = 15.

Multiply 15 by 1: 15, add to next coefficient: -1 + 15 = 14.

Multiply 14 by 1: 14, add to the last coefficient: -14 + 14 = 0.

So, the result is 1   6   15   14   0, meaning the polynomial factors into (x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14).

Alright, now I need to factor the cubic polynomial: x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14.

Again, let's apply the Rational Root Theorem to this cubic. The possible rational roots are factors of 14 divided by factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.

Let me test these one by one.

First, x = -1:

(-1)^3 + 6*(-1)^2 + 15*(-1) + 14 = -1 + 6 -15 + 14. Let's compute:

-1 + 6 is 5; 5 -15 is -10; -10 +14 is 4. Not zero.

Next, x = -2:

(-2)^3 + 6*(-2)^2 + 15*(-2) + 14 = -8 + 24 -30 +14. Compute:

-8 +24 is 16; 16 -30 is -14; -14 +14 is 0. So, x = -2 is a root!

Alright, so x=-2 is a root. Therefore, I can factor out (x + 2) from the cubic. Let's perform synthetic division again.

Set up synthetic division with root -2 on the cubic coefficients: 1, 6, 15, 14.

-2 | 1   6   15   14

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by -2: -2, add to next coefficient: 6 + (-2) = 4.

Multiply 4 by -2: -8, add to next coefficient: 15 + (-8) =7.

Multiply 7 by -2: -14, add to last coefficient: 14 + (-14) =0.

So, the result is 1   4   7   0, meaning the cubic factors into (x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7).

Therefore, the original quartic polynomial factors into:

(x - 1)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7).

Now, I need to check if the quadratic factor can be factored further or if it has any integer roots. The quadratic is x^2 + 4x + 7.

Let me compute its discriminant to see if it has real roots: b² - 4ac = 16 - 28 = -12. Since the discriminant is negative, this quadratic doesn't have real roots, let alone integer ones. Therefore, the only integer roots of the original equation are x=1 and x=-2.

Wait, let me just double-check. Sometimes, when factoring or synthetic division, I might have made a mistake.

First, let's confirm x=1 is a root:

1 + 5 + 9 -1 -14 = 1 +5=6, 6+9=15, 15-1=14, 14-14=0. Correct.

Then, x=-2:

(-2)^4 is 16, 5*(-2)^3 is 5*(-8)=-40, 9*(-2)^2 is 9*4=36, -x is 2, and -14.

So, 16 -40 +36 +2 -14. Let's compute: 16 -40 = -24, -24 +36=12, 12 +2=14, 14-14=0. Correct.

So, both roots check out.

Now, let's make sure that the quadratic doesn't factor into integers. The quadratic is x² +4x +7. The discriminant is 16 -28 = -12 <0, so no real roots, so no integer roots.

Therefore, the integer roots are x=1 and x=-2.

I don't think I missed any other integer roots because the quadratic can't have integer roots and the other possible roots were tested and didn't work. So, the integer roots are 1 and -2.

**Final Answer**
The integer roots are \boxed{1} and \boxed{-2}.

Wait, hold on, the question says "Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas." So, do I need to put them inside a single box separated by commas? Let me check the instructions again.

"The question: Find all the integer roots... Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas."

So, the answer should be "1, -2". But in the format, it's to be boxed. So, maybe write \boxed{1, -2}.

But in the initial prompt, the user says "Please enter all the integer roots, separated by commas." So, I can present them as 1 and -2 inside a single box.

Yes, so the final answer should be \boxed{1, -2}.

**Final Answer**
The integer roots are \boxed{1} and \boxed{-2}.

Wait, hold on, looking back at the initial instructions, they say "Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas. Please...". So, in the think process, I have written "the integer roots are 1 and -2." Then, in the final answer, I need to put them inside a single box separated by commas. So, I should do \boxed{1, -2}.

Wait, but in the previous message, the assistant wrote "the integer roots are 1 and -2" and then in the final answer wrote \boxed{1, -2}.

But in the initial problem, the user instruction is "Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas." So, I think the correct way is to have a single box with 1 and -2 separated by commas.

Hence, the final answer is \boxed{1, -2}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1, -2}

To find all the integer roots of the polynomial equation:

\[x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0,\]

we use the Rational Root Theorem, which tells us that any rational root \( \frac{p}{q} \) must have \( p \) as a factor of the constant term (-14) and \( q \) as a factor of the leading coefficient (1). Thus, the possible rational roots are the factors of -14, which are ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.

Testing these values, we find that:

- \( x = 1 \) satisfies the equation, so \( x = 1 \) is a root.
- Using synthetic division on the polynomial with root 1, we factor out \( (x - 1) \), resulting in the cubic polynomial \( x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14 \).
- Testing the cubic polynomial, we find that \( x = -2 \) is a root, so \( x = -2 \) is a root.
- Using synthetic division again on the cubic polynomial with root -2, we factor out \( (x + 2) \), resulting in the quadratic polynomial \( x^2 + 4x + 7 \).
- The quadratic polynomial \( x^2 + 4x + 7 \) has a negative discriminant (16 - 28 = -12), indicating no real roots.

Thus, the integer roots of the original polynomial are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2 \).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1, -2}
\]
