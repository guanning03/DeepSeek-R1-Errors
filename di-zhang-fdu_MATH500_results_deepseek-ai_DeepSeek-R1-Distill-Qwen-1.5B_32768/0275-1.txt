Question:
Given
\[\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 7 \\ -1 & -2 \end{pmatrix},\]compute $\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40}.$

Correct Answer:
Note that
\[\mathbf{A}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 7 \\ -1 & -3 \end{pmatrix}\]and
\[\mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} = -\mathbf{I}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40} &= (\mathbf{A}^3)^9 + (\mathbf{A}^3)^{10} \mathbf{A} + (\mathbf{A}^3)^{13} \mathbf{A} \\
&= (-\mathbf{I})^9 + (-\mathbf{I})^{10} \mathbf{A} + (-\mathbf{I})^{13} \mathbf{A} \\
&= -\mathbf{I} + \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{A} \\
&= -\mathbf{I} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}}.
\end{align*}

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this matrix problem to solve. The matrix is:

\[
\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 7 \\ -1 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

And I need to compute \(\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40}\). Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating because raising a matrix to the 27th, 31st, and 40th power directly seems really complicated. I remember that for matrices, especially when they are diagonalizable, we can use eigenvalues and eigenvectors to simplify exponentiation. But first, let me see if this matrix is diagonalizable or not.

To check if matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) is diagonalizable, I need to find its eigenvalues and see if there are enough linearly independent eigenvectors. The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = 0
\]

So, let's compute that determinant.

First, subtract \(\lambda\) along the diagonal:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 - \lambda & 7 \\ -1 & -2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix}
\]

The determinant is \((3 - \lambda)(-2 - \lambda) - (7)(-1)\). Let me compute this step by step.

First, expand \((3 - \lambda)(-2 - \lambda)\):

Multiply 3 by (-2 - λ): 3*(-2) + 3*(-λ) = -6 - 3λ

Multiply -λ by (-2 - λ): -λ*(-2) + (-λ)*(-λ) = 2λ + λ²

So, altogether:

(-6 - 3λ) + 2λ + λ² = λ² - λ - 6

Now, subtract the product of the off-diagonal elements, which is 7*(-1) = -7. So, the determinant is:

λ² - λ - 6 - (-7) = λ² - λ - 6 + 7 = λ² - λ + 1

So, the characteristic equation is:

λ² - λ + 1 = 0

Let me solve this quadratic equation. Using the quadratic formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

So, the eigenvalues are complex: \(\lambda = \frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These are complex conjugates, which is good because complex eigenvalues often come in conjugate pairs.

Since the eigenvalues are complex and distinct, the matrix is diagonalizable, but it will require complex eigenvectors. Hmm, but computing with complex numbers might be cumbersome, especially for exponentiating the matrix. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, complex eigenvalues can be associated with rotation and scaling. Let me recall that if a matrix has eigenvalues \( \lambda = re^{i\theta} \), then the matrix can be expressed in terms of Euler's formula, which relates to rotation and scaling. So, perhaps we can diagonalize the matrix using complex eigenvalues and then express higher powers in terms of their magnitudes and angles.

Let me write the eigenvalues in polar form. The magnitude \( r \) is:

\[
r = \sqrt{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{1} = 1
\]

So, the magnitude is 1, meaning the eigenvalues lie on the unit circle, so each has a magnitude of 1 and some angle. What's the angle θ? Since the real part is 1/2 and the imaginary part is \( \sqrt{3}/2 \), that corresponds to an angle of 60 degrees or \( \pi/3 \) radians.

So, each eigenvalue can be written as \( e^{i\pi/3} \) and \( e^{-i\pi/3} \). That's helpful because if I can diagonalize the matrix using these eigenvalues, then taking powers will just involve raising the eigenvalues to those powers.

But how does this help me compute \( \mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40} \)?

Well, if I can diagonalize \( \mathbf{A} \) as \( \mathbf{PDP^{-1}} \), where \( D \) is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, then \( \mathbf{A}^n = \mathbf{P} D^n \mathbf{P}^{-1} \). But dealing with complex matrices might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can write \( \mathbf{A} \) in terms of its real and imaginary parts or find a real matrix that represents the same transformation.

Wait, another approach: maybe I can find a real matrix \( \mathbf{B} \) such that \( \mathbf{B}^2 = \mathbf{A} \), and then express \( \mathbf{A}^n \) in terms of \( \mathbf{B}^n \). But I'm not sure if that would help here. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the powers of \( \mathbf{A} \) can be expressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials or something similar, given that the eigenvalues are on the unit circle.

Wait, I've heard of using Chebyshev polynomials when dealing with matrices on the unit circle. Let me recall. If a matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has eigenvalues on the unit circle, then the powers of \( \mathbf{A} \) can be expressed as polynomials in \( \mathbf{A} \) with coefficients related to the cosine of the angle, which resembles Chebyshev polynomials. Maybe that's the way to go.

But I'm not too familiar with the exact process. Maybe I should proceed step by step.

First, let's note that since \( \mathbf{A} \) is diagonalizable over complex numbers, we can express \( \mathbf{A} \) as \( \mathbf{PDP^{-1}} \), where \( D \) is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_1 \) and \( \lambda_2 \), which are the eigenvalues we found earlier.

But since \( \lambda_1 \) and \( \lambda_2 \) are complex conjugates, \( \mathbf{P} \) can be chosen to be a real matrix because the eigenvectors corresponding to complex conjugate eigenvalues are also complex conjugates, and we can take real combinations to form a real matrix.

So, suppose \( \mathbf{P} \) is a real matrix, then \( \mathbf{A} \) can be written as \( \mathbf{P} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{P}^{-1} \), which is real. Then, \( \mathbf{A}^n = \mathbf{P} \mathbf{D}^n \mathbf{P}^{-1} \). Since \( \lambda_1 \) and \( \lambda_2 \) are complex conjugates, \( \mathbf{D}^n \) will also have eigenvalues \( \lambda_1^n \) and \( \lambda_2^n \), which are also complex conjugates.

But in any case, since \( \mathbf{A}^n \) can be expressed in terms of \( \lambda_1^n \) and \( \lambda_2^n \), and because \( |\lambda_1| = |\lambda_2| = 1 \), the powers might simplify in some way.

Wait, actually, if \( \lambda = e^{i\theta} \), then \( \lambda^n = e^{i n \theta} \), which is a rotation by \( n\theta \). So, each \( \mathbf{A}^n \) is a rotation by \( n\theta \). But I don't know \( \theta \) here. Let me calculate \( \theta \).

Given that the eigenvalues are \( e^{i\pi/3} \) and \( e^{-i\pi/3} \), so \( \theta = \pi/3 \). Therefore, each \( \mathbf{A}^n \) is a rotation matrix with angle \( n\pi/3 \).

Wait, so if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a rotation matrix, then \( \mathbf{A}^n \) is also a rotation matrix with angle \( n\pi/3 \). Is that correct?

Wait, let me think. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a rotation matrix, then adding angles would correspond to multiplying rotation matrices. So, if \( \mathbf{A} \) corresponds to rotation by \( \pi/3 \), then \( \mathbf{A}^n \) would correspond to rotation by \( n\pi/3 \). But is \( \mathbf{A} \) actually a rotation matrix?

Wait, let's check if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a rotation matrix. A rotation matrix has the form:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

But in our case, \( \mathbf{A} \) is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 7 \\ -1 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Let me see if this is a rotation matrix. Let me see if it's orthogonal, since rotation matrices are orthogonal. So, compute \( \mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A} \) and see if it's the identity matrix.

Compute \( \mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A} \):

First row of \( \mathbf{A}^T \) is [3, -1], and the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are [3, -1] and [7, -2].

So, first element: 3*3 + (-1)*(-1) = 9 + 1 = 10

Second element: 3*7 + (-1)*(-2) = 21 + 2 = 23

Third element: (-1)*3 + (-2)*(-1) = -3 + 2 = -1

Fourth element: (-1)*7 + (-2)*(-2) = -7 + 4 = -3

So, \( \mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} 10 & 23 \\ -1 & -3 \end{pmatrix} \), which is not the identity matrix. Therefore, \( \mathbf{A} \) is not a rotation matrix. Hmm, so my initial thought was wrong.

But wait, maybe it's a reflection or something else. Let me check if \( \mathbf{A} \) is symmetric or skew-symmetric. A skew-symmetric matrix satisfies \( \mathbf{A}^T = -\mathbf{A} \). Let's see:

\( \mathbf{A}^T = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\ 7 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = -\mathbf{A} \). Oh! Wait, \( \mathbf{A} \) is skew-symmetric.

Yes, because \( \mathbf{A}^T = -\mathbf{A} \). So, \( \mathbf{A} \) is skew-symmetric. That's a good observation. Skew-symmetric matrices have some nice properties, especially regarding their eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a skew-symmetric matrix are either zero or purely imaginary. In our case, we found eigenvalues \( e^{i\pi/3} \) and \( e^{-i\pi/3} \), which are complex conjugates on the unit circle, so that makes sense.

Now, for skew-symmetric matrices, if they are real and of odd dimension, they have a non-zero eigenvalue. But since our matrix is 2x2, and complex eigenvalues come in pairs, which they do here, so that's consistent.

But how does this help me with exponentiating the matrix? Hmm.

I remember that for a skew-symmetric matrix \( \mathbf{A} \), we can write \( \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{B}^T \mathbf{B} \) where \( \mathbf{B} \) is an upper triangular matrix. Wait, that's the polar decomposition. Let me recall.

Yes, any real matrix can be decomposed into \( \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{P} \), where \( \mathbf{U} \) is orthogonal and \( \mathbf{P} \) is positive semi-definite. For skew-symmetric matrices, \( \mathbf{P} \) is actually a symmetric positive definite matrix.

But I'm not sure if that directly helps me compute \( \mathbf{A}^n \).

Wait, but if \( \mathbf{A} \) is skew-symmetric, then \( \mathbf{A}^n \) for even \( n \) is a symmetric matrix, and for odd \( n \), it's skew-symmetric. Hmm, but in our case, we need \( \mathbf{A}^{27} \), \( \mathbf{A}^{31} \), and \( \mathbf{A}^{40} \). All of these exponents are even except 31. So, 27 and 31 are odd, 40 is even.

But I don't know if that helps me. Maybe I should think about the powers of \( \mathbf{A} \).

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. That theorem states that a matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. So, if I can find the characteristic equation of \( \mathbf{A} \), then I can express higher powers of \( \mathbf{A} \) in terms of lower powers, which might help in simplifying the expression.

So, let's compute the characteristic equation. Earlier, I found the characteristic equation as \( \lambda^2 - \lambda + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem tells us that:

\[
\mathbf{A}^2 - \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I} = \mathbf{0}
\]

Which means:

\[
\mathbf{A}^2 = \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}
\]

So, we can express \( \mathbf{A}^2 \) in terms of \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( \mathbf{I} \). Maybe we can use this recurrence relation to find a pattern for \( \mathbf{A}^n \).

Let me try to compute \( \mathbf{A}^3 \):

\[
\mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^2 = \mathbf{A} ( \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I} ) = \mathbf{A}^2 - \mathbf{A} = ( \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I} ) - \mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{I}
\]

Interesting, \( \mathbf{A}^3 = -\mathbf{I} \). Let me compute \( \mathbf{A}^4 \) to see if a pattern emerges.

\[
\mathbf{A}^4 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{A} (-\mathbf{I}) = -\mathbf{A}
\]

Then, \( \mathbf{A}^5 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^4 = \mathbf{A} (-\mathbf{A}) = -\mathbf{A}^2 = -(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) = -\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I} \)

Continuing:

\( \mathbf{A}^6 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^5 = \mathbf{A} (-\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I}) = -\mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{A} = -( \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I} ) + \mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I} + \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I} \)

So, \( \mathbf{A}^6 = \mathbf{I} \). Hmm, so the powers of \( \mathbf{A} \) cycle every 6 exponents. That is, \( \mathbf{A}^6 = \mathbf{I} \), which would make \( \mathbf{A}^7 = \mathbf{A} \), \( \mathbf{A}^8 = \mathbf{A}^2 \), and so on.

Let me verify this:

We already have:

\( \mathbf{A}^1 = \mathbf{A} \)

\( \mathbf{A}^2 = \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I} \)

\( \mathbf{A}^3 = -\mathbf{I} \)

\( \mathbf{A}^4 = -\mathbf{A} \)

\( \mathbf{A}^5 = -\mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{I} = -(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) + \mathbf{I} = -\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I} + \mathbf{I} = -\mathbf{A} + 2\mathbf{I} \)

Wait, hold on, earlier I thought \( \mathbf{A}^5 = -\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I} \), but now I have \( \mathbf{A}^5 = -\mathbf{A} + 2\mathbf{I} \). That seems inconsistent.

Wait, let's recalculate \( \mathbf{A}^5 \):

We had:

\( \mathbf{A}^3 = -\mathbf{I} \)

\( \mathbf{A}^4 = -\mathbf{A} \)

So, \( \mathbf{A}^5 = \mathbf{A}^4 \cdot \mathbf{A} = (-\mathbf{A}) \cdot \mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{A}^2 \)

But \( \mathbf{A}^2 = \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I} \), so:

\( \mathbf{A}^5 = -(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) = -\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I} \)

So that's consistent. Then \( \mathbf{A}^6 = \mathbf{A}^5 \cdot \mathbf{A} = (-\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I}) \cdot \mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{A} = -(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) + \mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I} + \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I} \)

So, \( \mathbf{A}^6 = \mathbf{I} \). Then \( \mathbf{A}^7 = \mathbf{A}^6 \cdot \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I} \cdot \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A} \), \( \mathbf{A}^8 = \mathbf{A}^7 \cdot \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}^2 \), and so on.

So, indeed, the powers cycle every 6 exponents. So, \( \mathbf{A}^{6k} = \mathbf{I} \), \( \mathbf{A}^{6k+1} = \mathbf{A} \), \( \mathbf{A}^{6k+2} = \mathbf{A}^2 \), etc.

Given that, let's compute \( \mathbf{A}^{27} \), \( \mathbf{A}^{31} \), and \( \mathbf{A}^{40} \).

First, compute 27 divided by 6:

27 ÷ 6 = 4 with a remainder of 3.

So, 27 = 6*4 + 3.

Therefore, \( \mathbf{A}^{27} = (\mathbf{A}^6)^4 \cdot \mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{I}^4 \cdot \mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{I} \cdot \mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{A}^3 \).

But earlier, we found \( \mathbf{A}^3 = -\mathbf{I} \). Therefore, \( \mathbf{A}^{27} = -\mathbf{I} \).

Next, compute 31 divided by 6:

31 ÷ 6 = 5 with a remainder of 1.

So, 31 = 6*5 + 1.

Therefore, \( \mathbf{A}^{31} = (\mathbf{A}^6)^5 \cdot \mathbf{A}^1 = \mathbf{I}^5 \cdot \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I} \cdot \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A} \).

Then, compute 40 divided by 6:

40 ÷ 6 = 6 with a remainder of 4.

So, 40 = 6*6 + 4.

Therefore, \( \mathbf{A}^{40} = (\mathbf{A}^6)^6 \cdot \mathbf{A}^4 = \mathbf{I}^6 \cdot \mathbf{A}^4 = \mathbf{I} \cdot \mathbf{A}^4 = \mathbf{A}^4 \).

From earlier, \( \mathbf{A}^4 = -\mathbf{A} \). Therefore, \( \mathbf{A}^{40} = -\mathbf{A} \).

So, putting it all together:

\( \mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40} = (-\mathbf{I}) + \mathbf{A} + (-\mathbf{A}) \)

Simplify:

\( (-\mathbf{I}) + \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{I} + 0 = -\mathbf{I} \)

Wait, that's nice! The \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( -\mathbf{A} \) cancel each other out, leaving just \( -\mathbf{I} \).

But let me double-check my steps because sometimes with these exponent cycles, it's easy to make a mistake.

First, computing \( \mathbf{A}^3 \):

\( \mathbf{A}^2 = \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I} \)

\( \mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{A} \cdot (\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) = \mathbf{A}^2 - \mathbf{A} = (\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) - \mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{I} \). Correct.

\( \mathbf{A}^4 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{A} (-\mathbf{I}) = -\mathbf{A} \). Correct.

\( \mathbf{A}^5 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^4 = \mathbf{A} (-\mathbf{A}) = -\mathbf{A}^2 = -(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) = -\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I} \). Correct.

\( \mathbf{A}^6 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^5 = \mathbf{A} (-\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I}) = -\mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{A} = -(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) + \mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I} + \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I} \). Correct.

So, the cycle is indeed every 6 powers.

Therefore, \( \mathbf{A}^{27} = \mathbf{A}^{6*4 + 3} = (\mathbf{A}^6)^4 \cdot \mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{I}^4 \cdot (-\mathbf{I}) = -\mathbf{I} \)

Similarly, \( \mathbf{A}^{31} = \mathbf{A}^{6*5 + 1} = (\mathbf{A}^6)^5 \cdot \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}^5 \cdot \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A} \)

And \( \mathbf{A}^{40} = \mathbf{A}^{6*6 + 4} = (\mathbf{A}^6)^6 \cdot \mathbf{A}^4 = \mathbf{I}^6 \cdot (-\mathbf{A}) = -\mathbf{A} \)

So, \( \mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40} = (-\mathbf{I}) + \mathbf{A} + (-\mathbf{A}) = -\mathbf{I} \)

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the final result is \( -\mathbf{I} \), which is a matrix with -1 on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere.

But just to make sure, let me compute each power step by step using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.

We know \( \mathbf{A}^2 = \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I} \), so:

\( \mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^2 = \mathbf{A} (\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) = \mathbf{A}^2 - \mathbf{A} = (\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) - \mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{I} \). Correct.

\( \mathbf{A}^4 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{A} (-\mathbf{I}) = -\mathbf{A} \). Correct.

\( \mathbf{A}^5 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^4 = \mathbf{A} (-\mathbf{A}) = -\mathbf{A}^2 = -(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) = -\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I} \). Correct.

\( \mathbf{A}^6 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^5 = \mathbf{A} (-\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I}) = -\mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{A} = -(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) + \mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I} + \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I} \). Correct.

Therefore, it's consistent. So, the exponents cycle every 6.

Thus, the computations seem correct. Therefore, the sum \( \mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40} = -\mathbf{I} \).

Wait, but let me compute \( \mathbf{A}^{40} \) another way to be thorough.

\( \mathbf{A}^{40} = (\mathbf{A}^6)^6 \cdot \mathbf{A}^4 = \mathbf{I}^6 \cdot (-\mathbf{A}) = -\mathbf{A} \). Correct.

Alternatively, since \( \mathbf{A}^6 = \mathbf{I} \), \( \mathbf{A}^{6k} = \mathbf{I} \). So, \( \mathbf{A}^{40} = \mathbf{A}^{6*6 + 4} = (\mathbf{A}^6)^6 \cdot \mathbf{A}^4 = \mathbf{I}^6 \cdot (-\mathbf{A}) = -\mathbf{A} \). Correct.

So, everything seems consistent.

Therefore, the final result is \( -\mathbf{I} \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-\mathbf{I}}
</think>

To solve the problem of computing \(\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40}\) for the matrix \(\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 7 \\ -1 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the properties of the matrix and its powers.

First, we find the eigenvalues of \(\mathbf{A}\) by solving the characteristic equation:
\[
\det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = 0
\]
This gives us the characteristic equation:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda + 1 = 0
\]
The roots of this equation are:
\[
\lambda = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
These eigenvalues are complex conjugates and lie on the unit circle, indicating that \(\mathbf{A}\) is a skew-symmetric matrix.

Using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we know that \(\mathbf{A}\) satisfies its characteristic polynomial:
\[
\mathbf{A}^2 = \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}
\]
We can use this recurrence relation to compute higher powers of \(\mathbf{A}\):
\[
\mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^2 = \mathbf{A} (\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) = -\mathbf{I}
\]
\[
\mathbf{A}^4 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^3 = -\mathbf{A}
\]
\[
\mathbf{A}^5 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^4 = -\mathbf{A}^2 = -(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{I}) = -\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I}
\]
\[
\mathbf{A}^6 = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A}^5 = \mathbf{A} (-\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I}) = \mathbf{I}
\]
We observe that the powers of \(\mathbf{A}\) cycle every 6 exponents. Therefore:
- \( \mathbf{A}^{27} = -\mathbf{I} \)
- \( \mathbf{A}^{31} = \mathbf{A} \)
- \( \mathbf{A}^{40} = -\mathbf{A} \)

Adding these together:
\[
\mathbf{A}^{27} + \mathbf{A}^{31} + \mathbf{A}^{40} = -\mathbf{I} + \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{I}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-\mathbf{I}}
\]
