Question:
Let
\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = p_1(x) p_2(x) \dotsm p_k(x),\]where each non-constant polynomial $p_i(x)$ is monic with integer coefficients, and cannot be factored further over the integers.  Compute $p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \dots + p_k(1).$

Correct Answer:
First, we can factor $x^8 + 3x^4 - 4$ as $(x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4).$  Then
\[x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) = (x^2 + 1)(x - 1)(x + 1),\]and by Sophie Germain,
\[x^4 + 4 = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 - 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2).\]Thus, the full factorization is
\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^2 + 1)(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2).\]Evaluating each factor at $x = 1,$ we get $2 + 0 + 2 + 5 + 1 = \boxed{10}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this polynomial: \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\). The problem says I need to factor it into monic polynomials with integer coefficients, none of which can be factored further over the integers. Then, I have to compute the sum of each of these polynomials evaluated at 1. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that factoring polynomials is a crucial part of algebra. For polynomials of higher degree, sometimes we can factor them by recognizing patterns or using substitution methods. Let me see if this polynomial can be simplified or factored in a way that makes it easier.

Looking at \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\), I notice that it resembles a quadratic in terms of \(x^4\). Let me make a substitution to make this clearer. Let \(y = x^4\). Then, the equation becomes \(y^2 + 3y - 4\). Hmm, that looks like a quadratic equation, which I can factor if possible.

Factoring \(y^2 + 3y - 4\), I need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Let's see, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, the factored form is \((y + 4)(y - 1)\).

Substituting back \(y = x^4\), we get \((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\). Okay, so now the original polynomial is factored into two parts: \(x^4 + 4\) and \(x^4 - 1\). But wait, these are still quartic polynomials, which are degree 4. I need to see if these can be factored further.

Starting with \(x^4 - 1\), that's a difference of squares because \(x^4 = (x^2)^2\) and 1 is \(1^2\). So, \(x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\). But \(x^2 - 1\) is also a difference of squares: \(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\). So, putting it all together, \(x^4 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\). 

So, we have \(x^4 - 1\) factored into linear terms and a quadratic. But since the problem specifies that each polynomial \(p_i(x)\) is monic with integer coefficients and cannot be factored further over the integers, \(x^2 + 1\) is irreducible over the integers, so we can't factor it further. Therefore, \(x^4 - 1\) factors into three polynomials: \((x - 1)\), \((x + 1)\), and \((x^2 + 1)\). Each of these is monic, has integer coefficients, and is irreducible over the integers. So, that's our second factorization.

Now, moving on to \(x^4 + 4\). This is a biquadratic polynomial. I remember that sometimes quartic polynomials can be factored using sum and difference of squares or other identities. However, \(x^4 + 4\) doesn't immediately look like a standard form that factors neatly. Wait, maybe it can be factored as a product of quadratics?

Yes, I recall that \(x^4 + 4\) can be factored using the Sophie Germain identity, which states that \(x^4 + 4y^4 = (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2)\). If we let \(y^4 = 1\), then \(4y^4 = 4\), so \(x^4 + 4y^4 = x^4 + 4\). So, in this case, \(y = 1\), so we have:

\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\).

Let me verify that. Multiply \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\):

First, \(x^2 * x^2 = x^4\).

Then, \(x^2 * (-2x) = -2x^3\).

Then, \(x^2 * 2 = 2x^2\).

Next, \(2x * x^2 = 2x^3\).

Then, \(2x * (-2x) = -4x^2\).

Then, \(2x * 2 = 4x\).

Next, \(2 * x^2 = 2x^2\).

Then, \(2 * (-2x) = -4x\).

Finally, \(2 * 2 = 4\).

Now, add all these terms together:

\(x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x + 2x^2 - 4x + 4\).

Combine like terms:

- \(x^4\)
- \(-2x^3 + 2x^3 = 0\)
- \(2x^2 - 4x^2 + 2x^2 = 0\)
- \(4x - 4x = 0\)
- \(+4\)

So, the result is \(x^4 + 4\), which matches. Great, so \(x^4 + 4\) factors into \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\).

Now, are these quadratics further reducible over the integers? Let's check. For a quadratic \(ax^2 + bx + c\), discriminant is \(b^2 - 4ac\). If discriminant is a perfect square, it factors; otherwise, it's irreducible.

For \(x^2 + 2x + 2\), discriminant is \(4 - 8 = -4\). Negative discriminant, so it doesn't factor into real linear factors, let alone integer ones.

Similarly, for \(x^2 - 2x + 2\), discriminant is \(4 - 8 = -4\). Same result. So, these quadratics are irreducible over the integers. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4\) cannot be factored further into non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients.

So, putting it all together, the original polynomial \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\) factors as:

\[(x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\]

Which further factors into:

\[(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 - 1)(x + 1)(x - 1)\]

So, each of these factors is monic, has integer coefficients, and is irreducible over the integers. Therefore, the factorization is complete.

So, the factors are:

1. \(x^2 + 2x + 2\)
2. \(x^2 - 2x + 2\)
3. \(x^2 - 1\)
4. \(x + 1\)
5. \(x - 1\)

Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me count: starting from \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\), which breaks down into \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 - 1)(x - 1)(x + 1)\). So, total of 5 factors.

But let me make sure that each of these cannot be factored further. \(x^2 + 2x + 2\) is irreducible, as we saw, same with \(x^2 - 2x + 2\). Then, \(x^2 - 1\) is further factored into \((x - 1)(x + 1)\), which are linear and hence irreducible. So, all the factors are indeed irreducible over the integers. So, that's the complete factorization.

So, the monic, irreducible polynomials are:

1. \(x^2 + 2x + 2\)
2. \(x^2 - 2x + 2\)
3. \(x^2 - 1\)
4. \(x + 1\)
5. \(x - 1\)

Now, the problem says to compute \(p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \dots + p_k(1)\). So, I need to evaluate each of these polynomials at 1 and sum the results.

Let me compute each polynomial at 1:

1. Evaluate \(x^2 + 2x + 2\) at 1:

\(1^2 + 2(1) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\).

2. Evaluate \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) at 1:

\(1^2 - 2(1) + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1\).

3. Evaluate \(x^2 - 1\) at 1:

\(1^2 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0\).

4. Evaluate \(x + 1\) at 1:

\(1 + 1 = 2\).

5. Evaluate \(x - 1\) at 1:

\(1 - 1 = 0\).

So, adding these up:

5 (from first polynomial) + 1 (from second) + 0 (from third) + 2 (from fourth) + 0 (from fifth) = 5 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 8.

Wait, so the sum is 8. Is that correct? Let me double-check each evaluation just to be sure.

First polynomial: \(x^2 + 2x + 2\) at 1:

\(1 + 2 + 2 = 5\). Correct.

Second polynomial: \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) at 1:

\(1 - 2 + 2 = 1\). Correct.

Third polynomial: \(x^2 - 1\) at 1:

\(1 - 1 = 0\). Correct.

Fourth polynomial: \(x + 1\) at 1:

\(1 + 1 = 2\). Correct.

Fifth polynomial: \(x - 1\) at 1:

\(1 - 1 = 0\). Correct.

Adding them up: 5 + 1 is 6, plus 0 is 6, plus 2 is 8, plus 0 is 8. So, 8 is the total.

But just to make sure, let me think if there's another possible way to factor the original polynomial. Maybe I missed a factorization earlier?

Original polynomial: \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\). I factored it as \((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\). Let me confirm that this is indeed correct.

Multiply \((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\):

\(x^4 * x^4 = x^8\),

\(x^4 * (-1) = -x^4\),

\(4 * x^4 = 4x^4\),

\(4 * (-1) = -4\).

So, combining terms: \(x^8 - x^4 + 4x^4 - 4\) which simplifies to \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\). Correct. So, that factorization is correct.

Is there another way to factor \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\)? Maybe by grouping or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps considering the original polynomial as a quadratic in \(x^4\), but we already did that.

Alternatively, maybe thinking of it as \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^8 - 4) + 3x^4\). Then, \(x^8 - 4\) is a difference of squares: \((x^4)^2 - (2)^2 = (x^4 - 2)(x^4 + 2)\). Then, the polynomial becomes \((x^4 - 2)(x^4 + 2) + 3x^4\). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps trying to factor as a product of four quadratics. But I think the initial approach was correct. The key was to factor the quartic into quadratics, and then each of those into linear factors.

So, I think the factorization into five polynomials is correct, and the evaluations at 1 sum up to 8.

Just to recap:

- Factored \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\) as \((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\).
- Factored each quartic into quadratics and linear factors.
- Evaluated each factor at 1 and summed the results.

All steps seem solid, so I think the answer is 8.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{8}
</think>

We start with the polynomial \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\). To factor this, we recognize it as a quadratic in terms of \(x^4\). Let \(y = x^4\), then the polynomial becomes \(y^2 + 3y - 4\), which factors as \((y + 4)(y - 1)\). Substituting back \(y = x^4\), we get \((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\).

Next, we factor each quartic polynomial further. The polynomial \(x^4 - 1\) is a difference of squares and factors as \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\). The term \(x^2 - 1\) further factors into \((x - 1)(x + 1)\). Thus, \(x^4 - 1\) factors into \((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\).

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 4\), we use the Sophie Germain identity, which factors it into \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\).

Now, we have the complete factorization:
\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 - 1)(x - 1)(x + 1).\]

Each factor is monic with integer coefficients and cannot be factored further over the integers. We evaluate each polynomial at \(x = 1\):

1. \((x^2 + 2x + 2)\) evaluated at 1: \(1^2 + 2(1) + 2 = 5\).
2. \((x^2 - 2x + 2)\) evaluated at 1: \(1^2 - 2(1) + 2 = 1\).
3. \((x^2 - 1)\) evaluated at 1: \(1^2 - 1 = 0\).
4. \((x + 1)\) evaluated at 1: \(1 + 1 = 2\).
5. \((x - 1)\) evaluated at 1: \(1 - 1 = 0\).

Summing these results: \(5 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 8\).

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{8}\).
