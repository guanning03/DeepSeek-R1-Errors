Question:
Five points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $O$ lie on a flat field.  $A$ is directly north of $O$, $B$ is directly west of $O$, $C$ is directly south of $O$, and $D$ is directly east of $O$. The  distance between $C$ and $D$ is 140 m.  A hot-air balloon is positioned in the air at $H$ directly above $O$. The balloon is held in place by four ropes $HA$, $HB$, $HC$, and $HD$.  Rope $HC$ has length 150 m and rope $HD$ has length 130 m. [asy]

To reduce the total length of rope used, rope $HC$ and rope $HD$ are to be replaced by a single rope $HP$ where $P$ is a point on the straight line between $C$ and $D$. (The balloon remains at the same position $H$ above $O$ as described above.)  Determine the greatest length of rope that can be saved.

Correct Answer:
To save the most rope, we must have $HP$ having minimum length.
For $HP$ to have minimum length, $HP$ must be perpendicular to $CD$. [asy]
pair C, D, H, P;
H=(90,120);
C=(0,0);
D=(140,0);
P=(90,0);

label("130", (D+H)/2, NE);
[/asy] (Among other things, we can see from this diagram that sliding $P$ away from the perpendicular position does make $HP$ longer.)
In the diagram, $HC=150$, $HD=130$ and $CD=140$.
Let $HP=x$ and $PD=a$.  Then $CP=140-a$.
By the Pythagorean Theorem in $\triangle HPC$, $x^2 + (140-a)^2 = 150^2$.
By the Pythagorean Theorem in $\triangle HPD$, $x^2+a^2 = 130^2$.
Subtracting the second equation from the first, we obtain \begin{align*}
(140-a)^2 - a^2 & = 150^2 - 130^2 \\
(19600 - 280a+a^2)-a^2 & = 5600 \\
19600 -280a & = 5600 \\
280a & = 14000 \\
a & = 50
\end{align*} Therefore, $x^2 + 90^2 = 150^2$ or $x^2 = 150^2 - 90^2 = 22500 - 8100 = 14400$ so $x =120$.
So the shortest possible rope that we can use is 120 m, which saves $130+150-120 = \boxed{160}$ m of rope.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have five points on a flat field: A, B, C, D, and O. A is directly north of O, B is directly west of O, C is directly south of O, and D is directly east of O. They form a sort of compass directions from O. Then, there's a hot-air balloon at point H directly above O. The balloon is held up by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. 

Right now, the distance between C and D is 140 meters. The balloon is at H, which is straight above O. So, O is the origin, and H is at (0, y) if we consider O as (0,0). The balloon is held by four ropes, so HA, HB, HC, HD. 

Now, the problem says that rope HC and HD are to be replaced by a single rope HP, where P is a point somewhere on the line between C and D. The balloon remains at the same position H above O. We need to determine the greatest length of rope that can be saved by replacing HC and HD with HP. 

So, essentially, we're supposed to find the position P on CD such that the total length of HP is as short as possible, which would minimize the loss in rope length. Because if we can minimize the length of HP, then we can save the maximum possible length by replacing HC and HD with HP.

First, let me try to visualize the setup. Since A is north of O, B is west, C is south, D is east. So, if I imagine O at the origin, then A is at (0, a), B is at (-b, 0), C is at (0, -c), and D is at (d, 0). But in the Asymptote code, they have O at (0,0), A at (1,1), which is northeast, but in the problem, A is directly north. Similarly, D is at (1.5, -0.3), which is southeast, but in the problem, D is directly east. So, perhaps the coordinates are scaled differently. Maybe I shouldn't rely on the Asymptote coordinates but just on the directions.

But for the problem, O is the origin, and H is at (0, h) for some height h. Then, HA is the rope from H to A, which is directly north of O, so A is at (0, h + HA). Similarly, B is directly west, so B is at (-b, h + HB), C is directly south, so C is at (0, h + HC), and D is directly east, so D is at (d, h + HD).

But the problem says that the distance between C and D is 140 m. Since C is directly south of O and D is directly east of O, the distance between C and D is the straight line distance between (0, h + HC) and (d, h + HD). So, the Euclidean distance between C and D is sqrt(d^2 + (h + HD - (h + HC))^2) = sqrt(d^2 + (HD - HC)^2) = 140 m.

Wait, that's an important point. So, the distance between C and D is sqrt(d^2 + (HD - HC)^2) = 140. So, if we can compute HC and HD, we can find d.

But wait, actually, the problem doesn't give us the lengths of HA, HB, HC, HD except for HC and HD. Wait, no, actually, it does give us HC = 150 m, HD = 130 m. So, we can use that.

Wait, let me check. The problem says: "The distance between C and D is 140 m. A hot-air balloon is positioned in the air at H directly above O. The balloon is held in place by four ropes HA, HB, HC, and HD. Rope HC has length 150 m and rope HD has length 130 m." So, we know that HC = 150 m, HD = 130 m. But we don't know HA, HB, or the height h.

But we can find d, because the distance between C and D is 140 m. So, let's write that down.

C is at (0, h + 150), and D is at (d, h + 130). So, the distance between C and D is sqrt[(d - 0)^2 + ((h + 130) - (h + 150))^2] = sqrt[d^2 + (-20)^2] = sqrt(d^2 + 400) = 140 m.

So, sqrt(d^2 + 400) = 140. Squaring both sides: d^2 + 400 = 19600. Therefore, d^2 = 19600 - 400 = 19200. So, d = sqrt(19200). Let's compute that. 19200 is 192 * 100, so sqrt(19200) = sqrt(192)*10. sqrt(192) is sqrt(64*3) = 8*sqrt(3). So, d = 8*sqrt(3)*10 = 80*sqrt(3). So, d = 80√3 meters.

So, the distance between C and D is 80√3 meters. So, that's the straight-line distance between C and D.

Now, we need to replace ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line between C and D. So, P is somewhere along the line segment CD.

We need to find the position P such that the length of HP is minimized, which will allow us to save the maximum possible length.

So, essentially, we have to find the point P on CD such that the distance from H to P is minimized. The maximum length that can be saved is the difference between the total length of HC + HD and the minimal length of HP.

So, the total length of HC + HD is 150 + 130 = 280 m. The minimal length of HP is the minimal distance from H to any point P on CD. The maximum length saved is 280 - minimal length.

Therefore, our task is to compute the minimal distance from H to CD.

Wait, but H is a fixed point above O, and CD is a straight line. The minimal distance from H to CD is equal to the distance from H to the line CD.

So, if we can compute the distance from H to CD, which is a straight line, then that will give us the minimal HP length. Therefore, the maximum length saved is 280 - distance from H to CD.

So, now, let's compute the distance from H to CD.

First, let's find the equation of the line CD. Points C and D are on the line CD.

Point C is at (0, h + 150). Point D is at (80√3, h + 130). So, the coordinates of C are (0, h + 150), and D are (80√3, h + 130).

So, let's compute the equation of line CD.

First, let's find the slope of CD. The slope m is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = [(h + 130) - (h + 150)] / (80√3 - 0) = (-20) / (80√3) = -1/(4√3).

So, the slope m is -1/(4√3). Therefore, the equation of line CD can be written as:

y - y1 = m(x - x1)

Let's take point C as (0, h + 150). So,

y - (h + 150) = (-1/(4√3))(x - 0)

So, y = (-1/(4√3))x + h + 150.

So, the equation of CD is y = (-1/(4√3))x + h + 150.

Now, the distance from point H to line CD is given by the formula:

Distance = |Ax + By + C| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2)

Where Ax + By + C is the equation of the line in standard form.

First, let's write the equation of CD in standard form.

From y = (-1/(4√3))x + h + 150, we can rearrange:

(1/(4√3))x + y - (h + 150) = 0

So, standard form is (1/(4√3))x + y - (h + 150) = 0

Thus, A = 1/(4√3), B = 1, C = -(h + 150)

So, the distance from H to CD is:

|(1/(4√3)) * 0 + 1 * h + 150 - (h + 150)| / sqrt( (1/(4√3))^2 + 1^2 )

Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, the standard form is (1/(4√3))x + 1*y - (h + 150) = 0, so A = 1/(4√3), B = 1, C = -(h + 150). Wait, so in the distance formula, it's |A*x0 + B*y0 + C| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2). Here, x0 is the x-coordinate of H, which is 0, since H is at (0, h). Similarly, y0 is h.

So, let me plug in x0 = 0, y0 = h.

So, the distance is |(1/(4√3))*0 + 1*h - (h + 150)| / sqrt( (1/(4√3))^2 + 1^2 )

Simplify numerator:

|(0 + h - h - 150)| = |-150| = 150

Denominator:

sqrt( (1/(16*3)) + 1 ) = sqrt(1/48 + 1) = sqrt(49/48) = 7/(4√3)

So, the distance is 150 / (7/(4√3)) = 150 * (4√3)/7 = (600√3)/7

So, the minimal distance from H to CD is 600√3 / 7 meters.

Therefore, the minimal length of HP is 600√3 / 7 meters.

So, the total length of HC + HD is 280 m. The minimal length of HP is 600√3 / 7 m.

Compute 600√3 / 7:

First, compute √3 ≈ 1.732, so 600 * 1.732 ≈ 1039.2, then divide by 7: ≈ 148.457 meters.

So, approximately 148.457 m. 

Therefore, the total length saved is 280 - 148.457 ≈ 131.543 m.

But since we need an exact value, not an approximation, let's compute 600√3 / 7 and then subtract from 280.

So, 280 is 280/1. Let's write both with denominator 7:

280 = 1960/7

So, 1960/7 - 600√3 /7 = (1960 - 600√3)/7

So, the exact value is (1960 - 600√3)/7 meters.

Simplify that, we can factor 20: 20*(98 - 30√3)/7 = 20*(98/7 - 30√3/7) = 20*(14 - (30√3)/7) = 280 - (600√3)/7, which is the same as before.

But perhaps the question expects the answer in terms of exact value, so (1960 - 600√3)/7 meters. Alternatively, we can factor 20: 20*(98 - 30√3)/7, but that may not be necessary.

Alternatively, let's compute 1960 - 600√3.

Since √3 ≈ 1.732, 600√3 ≈ 1039.2, so 1960 - 1039.2 = 920.8, so 920.8 /7 ≈ 131.543. So, approximately 131.543 meters.

But since the problem is in exact terms, we can leave it as (1960 - 600√3)/7, which can be written as (1960/7) - (600√3)/7, which is 280 - (600√3)/7.

Alternatively, 280 - (600/7)√3.

But 600 divided by 7 is approximately 85.714. So, 280 - 85.714√3. But I think leaving it in the exact form is better.

So, the maximum length of rope that can be saved is 280 - (600√3)/7 meters.

But let me verify the calculations because sometimes in these geometry problems, mistakes can happen.

First, I found the equation of CD correctly. The slope between C and D was correct: (h +130 - h -150)/(80√3 -0) = (-20)/(80√3) = -1/(4√3). So, slope is correct.

Then, equation of CD is y = (-1/(4√3))x + h +150.

Then, distance from H(0, h) to CD: the standard formula is |A*x0 + B*y0 + C| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2). So, from the equation (1/(4√3))x + y - (h +150) = 0, A is 1/(4√3), B is 1, C is -(h +150).

So, plugging in H(0, h): |0 + h - (h +150)| / sqrt( (1/(4√3))^2 + 1 )

Which is | -150 | / sqrt(1/(48) + 1 ) = 150 / sqrt(49/48) = 150 / (7/(4√3)) = 150 * (4√3)/7 = 600√3 /7. So that seems correct.

Therefore, minimal HP is 600√3 /7, so total saved is 280 - 600√3 /7. 

Expressed as (1960 - 600√3)/7, which is approximately 131.543 m.

But perhaps we can write it as a fraction without the denominator: 280 - (600√3)/7. Alternatively, factor 20: 20*(14 - 3√3*10)/7, but that complicates it. So, perhaps it's best to leave it as (1960 - 600√3)/7.

Wait, let me compute 1960 divided by 7: 1960 /7 = 280. So, 280 - (600√3)/7. So, that is the exact value.

So, final answer is 280 - (600√3)/7. But let me check if that can be simplified more.

Wait, 600 and 7 are coprime, so that's as simplified as it gets.

Alternatively, factor 600: 600 = 60*10, but that doesn't help much.

Alternatively, we can write it as 280 - (600/7)√3. But 600/7 is approximately 85.714.

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in a particular form. Maybe we need to rationalize or something else.

Wait, or perhaps the answer is 280 - (600√3)/7, which is 280 minus that. Alternatively, we can write it as (1960 - 600√3)/7, which is the same.

Alternatively, if we factor 20, as I did before, we get 20*(98 - 30√3)/7, which is 20*(14 - (30√3)/7). But that doesn't really help.

Alternatively, we can factor 10: 10*(196 - 60√3)/7, but that's not helpful either.

Alternatively, we can write it as 280 - (600/7)√3. So, either way, it's the same. So, the exact value is 280 - (600√3)/7, which is approximately 131.543 meters.

So, to present the answer, we can either write it as 280 - (600√3)/7 or as (1960 - 600√3)/7. Both are correct.

Since the problem mentions "greatest length of rope that can be saved," it's likely that they prefer an exact value, so probably (1960 - 600√3)/7. Alternatively, they might want it in a simplified radical form.

Alternatively, we can factor 20: 20*(98 - 30√3)/7 = 20*(14 - (30√3)/7). But that doesn't really help. Alternatively, just leave it as 280 - (600√3)/7.

Alternatively, since 600/7 is approximately 85.714, so 280 - 85.714 is approximately 194.286 meters, but that's an approximate value, not exact.

So, probably, exact form is better.

Therefore, the greatest length of rope that can be saved is (1960 - 600√3)/7 meters, which simplifies to 280 - (600√3)/7 meters.

Alternatively, if I divide numerator and denominator by something, but I don't think it's necessary.

Wait, perhaps I can write 1960 - 600√3 as 20*(98 - 30√3), but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe 600√3 /7 is the same as 600√3 /7. So, perhaps the answer is 280 - (600√3)/7 meters.

So, in a box, I can write \boxed{\dfrac{1960 - 600\sqrt{3}}{7}} or \boxed{280 - \dfrac{600\sqrt{3}}{7}}.

But I think the first form is better because it shows the exact value without decimal approximation.

Alternatively, to write it as a single fraction: (1960 - 600√3)/7.

So, yeah, I think that's the most precise exact form.

**Final Answer**
The greatest length of rope that can be saved is \boxed{\dfrac{1960 - 600\sqrt{3}}{7}} meters.

Given five points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(O\) on a flat field, where \(A\) is directly north of \(O\), \(B\) is directly west of \(O\), \(C\) is directly south of \(O\), and \(D\) is directly east of \(O\). The distance between \(C\) and \(D\) is 140 meters. A hot-air balloon is positioned at \(H\) directly above \(O\), with ropes \(HA\), \(HB\), \(HC\), and \(HD\). The lengths of \(HC\) and \(HD\) are 150 meters and 130 meters, respectively. We need to determine the greatest length of rope that can be saved by replacing \(HC\) and \(HD\) with a single rope \(HP\) where \(P\) is a point on the line segment \(CD\).

1. **Coordinates and Distance Calculation**:
   - \(C\) is at \((0, h + 150)\) and \(D\) is at \((d, h + 130)\).
   - The distance between \(C\) and \(D\) is given by \(\sqrt{d^2 + (130 - 150)^2} = 140\).
   - Solving for \(d\), we get \(d = 80\sqrt{3}\).

2. **Equation of Line \(CD\)**:
   - The slope of \(CD\) is \(-1/(4\sqrt{3})\).
   - The equation of line \(CD\) is \(y = (-1/(4\sqrt{3}))x + h + 150\).

3. **Distance from \(H\) to \(CD\)**:
   - Using the distance formula from a point to a line, the distance from \(H(0, h)\) to the line \(CD\) is calculated.
   - The distance is found to be \(600\sqrt{3}/7\) meters.

4. **Total Length of \(HC\) and \(HD\)**:
   - The total length of \(HC + HD\) is 280 meters.
   - The minimal length of \(HP\) is 600√3 / 7 meters.

5. **Greatest Length of Rope Saved**:
   - The greatest length of rope that can be saved is the difference between the total length of \(HC + HD\) and the minimal length of \(HP\).
   - This difference is \(280 - 600\sqrt{3}/7\).

Thus, the greatest length of rope that can be saved is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1960 - 600\sqrt{3}}{7}}\) meters.
