Question:
A sequence $(a_n)$ is defined as follows:
\[a_{i + 1} = \frac{1}{1 - a_i}\]for $i \ge 1.$  If $a_3 = a_1,$ compute $(a_9)^9.$

Correct Answer:
First, if $a_3 = a_1,$ then
\[a_1 = a_3 = a_5 = a_7 = a_9,\]so $(a_9)^9 = (a_1)^9.$

We have that
\begin{align*}
a_2 &= \frac{1}{1 - a_1}, \\
a_3 &= \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1 - a_1}{1 - a_1 - 1} = \frac{1 - a_1}{-a_1}.
\end{align*}Then
\[\frac{1 - a_1}{-a_1} = a_1,\]so $1 - a_1 = -a_1^2.$  Then $a_1^2 - a_1 + 1 = 0.$  Multiplying both sides by $a_1 + 1,$ we get
\[(a_1 + 1)(a_1 ^2 - a_1 + 1) = 0,\]so $a_1^3 + 1 = 0.$  Then $a_1^3 = -1,$ so $a_1^9 = (-1)^3 = \boxed{-1}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here where a sequence is defined by the recurrence relation \( a_{i + 1} = \frac{1}{1 - a_i} \) for \( i \geq 1 \). It also says that \( a_3 = a_1 \), and I need to compute \( (a_9)^9 \). Hmm, let me see how to approach this.

First, I know that the sequence is defined recursively, meaning each term depends on the previous one. The formula given is \( a_{i + 1} = \frac{1}{1 - a_i} \). So, starting from \( a_1 \), each subsequent term is defined by that fraction.

Given that \( a_3 = a_1 \), maybe I can express \( a_3 \) in terms of \( a_1 \) and set it equal to \( a_1 \), which would give me an equation to solve for \( a_1 \). That seems like a good plan.

Let me write out the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern.

We know:
- \( a_1 \) is just \( a_1 \).
- \( a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - a_1} \).
- \( a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} \).

Substituting \( a_2 \) into the expression for \( a_3 \):
\[ a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - a_1}} \]

Let me simplify that. The denominator is \( 1 - \frac{1}{1 - a_1} \). Let me find a common denominator for the terms in the denominator:

\[ 1 - \frac{1}{1 - a_1} = \frac{(1 - a_1) - 1}{1 - a_1} = \frac{-a_1}{1 - a_1} \]

So, substituting back into the expression for \( a_3 \):
\[ a_3 = \frac{1}{\frac{-a_1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1 - a_1}{-a_1} = -\frac{1 - a_1}{a_1} \]

But we are given that \( a_3 = a_1 \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ a_1 = -\frac{1 - a_1}{a_1} \]

Let me solve for \( a_1 \). Multiply both sides by \( a_1 \) to eliminate the denominator:
\[ a_1^2 = - (1 - a_1) \]
\[ a_1^2 = -1 + a_1 \]
Bring all terms to one side:
\[ a_1^2 - a_1 + 1 = 0 \]

Wait a minute, that's a quadratic equation:
\[ a_1^2 - a_1 + 1 = 0 \]

Let me compute the discriminant to see if there are real solutions:
Discriminant \( D = (-1)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 1 = 1 - 4 = -3 \)

Hmm, discriminant is negative, so there are no real solutions. That's odd. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Let me go back and check.

I had:
\( a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} \)
\( a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - a_1} \)
So,
\( a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - a_1}} \)

Simplify denominator:
\( 1 - \frac{1}{1 - a_1} = \frac{(1 - a_1) - 1}{1 - a_1} = \frac{-a_1}{1 - a_1} \)

Therefore,
\( a_3 = \frac{1}{\frac{-a_1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1 - a_1}{-a_1} = -\frac{1 - a_1}{a_1} \)

So that seems correct. So, \( a_3 = -\frac{1 - a_1}{a_1} \).

Set equal to \( a_1 \):
\[ a_1 = -\frac{1 - a_1}{a_1} \]
Multiply both sides by \( a_1 \):
\[ a_1^2 = -1 + a_1 \]
Bring all terms to the left:
\[ a_1^2 - a_1 + 1 = 0 \]

Quadratic equation with discriminant -3. Hmm, so no real solutions? That's strange because the problem is asking for a real number.

Wait, maybe the sequence is complex? The problem didn't specify, but since it's asking for \( (a_9)^9 \), which is a real number, perhaps \( a_1 \) is complex? Or maybe I made an error earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not have assumed it's real. Maybe I should consider complex numbers.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it just says "a sequence \( (a_n) \)", so I think unless specified, it's okay to assume complex numbers.

So, let's proceed with complex numbers.

Solutions to \( a_1^2 - a_1 + 1 = 0 \) are:

\( a_1 = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2} \)

So, \( a_1 = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) or \( a_1 = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \)

These are the primitive cube roots of unity, right? Because \( \omega = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) and \( \omega^2 = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Wait, no, actually, \( \omega = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) and \( \omega^2 = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \). So, these are the cube roots of 1 except for 1 itself.

So, these are roots of the equation \( x^2 - x + 1 = 0 \).

But wait, if \( a_1 \) is one of these roots, then let's see what happens with the sequence.

Let me denote \( a_1 = \omega \), where \( \omega^3 = 1 \) and \( \omega \neq 1 \). Then, let's see what happens with the sequence.

Given \( a_{i + 1} = \frac{1}{1 - a_i} \)

So, compute \( a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - a_1} \). Since \( a_1 = \omega \), then:

\( a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - \omega} \)

But \( 1 - \omega = 1 - \left( \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) = \frac{2 - 1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \)

Thus,
\( a_2 = \frac{1}{\frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{2}{1 - i\sqrt{3}} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

\( \frac{2(1 + i\sqrt{3})}{(1)^2 - (i\sqrt{3})^2} = \frac{2(1 + i\sqrt{3})}{1 - (-3)} = \frac{2(1 + i\sqrt{3})}{4} = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \)

Which is equal to \( \omega \). Interesting, \( a_2 = \omega = a_1 \). Wait, so \( a_2 = a_1 \)?

Wait, that canâ€™t be right because if \( a_1 = \omega \), then \( a_2 = \omega \).

But then, \( a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \frac{1}{1 - \omega} \), which is \( \frac{1}{\frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}} \), which we calculated earlier to be \( \omega \) again. So, \( a_3 = \omega \). So, \( a_3 = a_1 \) as given. So, the sequence is periodic with period 2?

Wait, hold on: If \( a_1 = \omega \), then \( a_2 = \omega \), \( a_3 = \omega \), etc. So, all terms are equal to \( \omega \). But let me check:

But wait, if \( a_1 = \omega \), then \( a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - \omega} \), which we calculated as \( \omega \). So, \( a_2 = \omega = a_1 \). Therefore, \( a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \frac{1}{1 - \omega} = \omega \), same as before. So, all terms are \( \omega \), so the sequence is constant.

But that would mean the period is 1, but the problem says \( a_3 = a_1 \). So, if it's constant, then all terms are equal, so certainly \( a_3 = a_1 \). So, that is a possible solution.

But then, why did we get a quadratic equation? Because in the quadratic, we had two roots, but the sequence is constant, so both roots satisfy the condition.

Wait, so both roots are possible solutions for \( a_1 \). So, then, since the sequence is constant, \( a_9 = \omega \), so \( (a_9)^9 = \omega^9 \). But \( \omega^3 = 1 \), so \( \omega^9 = (\omega^3)^3 = 1^3 = 1 \). So, is the answer 1?

Wait, but let me check. Let me compute \( \omega^9 \).

Since \( \omega^3 = 1 \), \( \omega^9 = (\omega^3)^3 = 1^3 = 1 \). So, \( (a_9)^9 = 1 \).

But hold on, let me verify this because sometimes if the sequence is periodic, it might have a higher period. But in this case, since \( a_1 = \omega \), \( a_2 = \omega \), so it's constant. So, the period is 1, so \( a_9 = a_1 = \omega \).

But wait, let me think again.

The problem says \( a_3 = a_1 \). If \( a_1 \) is \( \omega \), then \( a_2 = \omega \), \( a_3 = \omega \), so yes, \( a_3 = a_1 \). So, that's consistent. So, the sequence is constant for all n.

Therefore, \( a_9 = \omega \), so \( (a_9)^9 = \omega^9 = 1 \).

But let me check with the other root, \( \omega' = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \). So, if \( a_1 = \omega' \), then \( a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - \omega'} \).

Compute \( 1 - \omega' = 1 - \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{2 - 1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} = \omega \).

So, \( a_2 = \frac{1}{\omega} \). But \( \omega \) is the other root, so \( a_2 = \omega' \) again? Wait, no:

Wait, \( \omega = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \), and \( \omega' = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \). So, \( 1/\omega = \omega' \), because \( \omega \times \omega' = \frac{(1 + i\sqrt{3})(1 - i\sqrt{3})}{4} = \frac{1 + 3}{4} = 1 \). So, indeed, \( 1/\omega = \omega' \).

So, \( a_2 = 1/(1 - a_1) = 1/\omega = \omega' \). Then, \( a_3 = 1/(1 - a_2) = 1/(1 - \omega') \). Compute \( 1 - \omega' = 1 - \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{2 - 1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} = \omega \). So, \( a_3 = 1/\omega = \omega' \). So, \( a_3 = \omega' \neq a_1 = \omega \). Therefore, if \( a_1 = \omega' \), then \( a_3 = \omega' \), which is not equal to \( a_1 \).

But in the problem, it's given that \( a_3 = a_1 \). So, if \( a_1 = \omega' \), then \( a_3 = \omega' \neq a_1 \), which is a contradiction. Therefore, \( a_1 \) cannot be \( \omega' \), only \( \omega \) is acceptable.

So, therefore, \( a_1 = \omega = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \), and the sequence is constant with all terms equal to \( \omega \), so \( a_9 = \omega \). Therefore, \( (a_9)^9 = \omega^9 = 1 \).

Hence, the answer is 1.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute \( \omega^9 \).

Since \( \omega^3 = 1 \), \( \omega^9 = (\omega^3)^3 = 1^3 = 1 \). So, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, \( \omega^1 = \omega \), \( \omega^2 = \omega^2 \), \( \omega^3 = 1 \), \( \omega^4 = \omega \), \( \omega^5 = \omega^2 \), \( \omega^6 = 1 \), \( \omega^7 = \omega \), \( \omega^8 = \omega^2 \), \( \omega^9 = 1 \). So, yes, \( \omega^9 = 1 \).

Therefore, \( (a_9)^9 = 1 \).

But just to be thorough, let me compute the first few terms with \( a_1 = \omega \) and see if the sequence cycles with period 1, meaning all terms equal to \( \omega \).

Compute \( a_1 = \omega \).

Then, \( a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - a_1} = \frac{1}{1 - \omega} \). As before, \( 1 - \omega = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \), so \( a_2 = \frac{2}{1 - i\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2(1 + i\sqrt{3})}{(1)^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2} = \frac{2(1 + i\sqrt{3})}{4} = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} = \omega \).

Similarly, \( a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \frac{1}{1 - \omega} = \omega \), same as before.

Thus, indeed, the sequence is constant with all terms equal to \( \omega \). So, \( a_9 = \omega \), and \( \omega^9 = 1 \).

Alternatively, if the problem is expecting a real number, but in the complex plane, \( \omega^9 = 1 \). So, the answer should be 1.

Therefore, I think the answer is 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
</think>

Given the sequence \((a_n)\) defined by the recurrence relation:
\[ a_{i + 1} = \frac{1}{1 - a_i} \]
for \(i \geq 1\), and the condition \(a_3 = a_1\), we need to compute \((a_9)^9\).

First, we express \(a_3\) in terms of \(a_1\):
\[ a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} \]
where \(a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - a_1}\). Substituting \(a_2\) into the expression for \(a_3\):
\[ a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1 - a_1}{-a_1} = -\frac{1 - a_1}{a_1} \]

Given \(a_3 = a_1\), we set up the equation:
\[ a_1 = -\frac{1 - a_1}{a_1} \]
Multiplying both sides by \(a_1\):
\[ a_1^2 = - (1 - a_1) \]
Simplifying:
\[ a_1^2 + a_1 - 1 = 0 \]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[ a_1 = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

However, since the problem involves complex numbers, we consider the roots of unity. The roots are \(\omega = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and \(\omega' = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}\), which are the primitive cube roots of unity. These satisfy \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \((\omega')^3 = 1\).

Given \(a_1 = \omega\), we find:
\[ a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - \omega} = \omega \]
\[ a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \omega \]

Thus, the sequence is constant with all terms equal to \(\omega\). Therefore, \(a_9 = \omega\).

To find \((a_9)^9\):
\[ (\omega)^9 = (\omega^3)^3 = 1^3 = 1 \]

Hence, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]
