Question:
What is the domain of the function $f(x) = \frac{2-x}{\log(2-\log(x-2))}$, where $\log$ is the base $10$ logarithm function? Express your answer in interval notation.

Correct Answer:
The inner logarithm is only defined if $x - 2 > 0$, so $x > 2$. Furthermore, the outer logarithm is only defined if $2 - \log(x-2) > 0$, which implies that $2 > \log(x-2)$, so that $100 > x-2$. Thus, $x < 102$. Finally, it must also be true that $\log(2-\log(x-2)) \neq 0$, so that $2 - \log(x-2) \neq 1$. Equivalently, $\log(x-2) \neq 1$, so $x \neq 12$. Thus, the answer is $x \in \boxed{(2,12) \cup (12,102)}$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to find the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2 - x}{\log(2 - \log(x - 2))} \). Hmm, okay, let me recall what the domain of a function means. It's all the real numbers x for which the function is defined. So, in this case, since it's a rational function, I need to make sure that the denominator isn't zero and that the arguments inside the logarithms are positive. 

Alright, let me start by breaking down the function. The function has two main parts: the numerator \( 2 - x \) and the denominator \( \log(2 - \log(x - 2)) \). 

First, the numerator \( 2 - x \) is a linear function. It's defined for all real numbers because there are no restrictions on x from here. So, the only restrictions come from the denominator. 

Next, looking at the denominator, which is a logarithm: \( \log(2 - \log(x - 2)) \). For the logarithm to be defined, its argument must be positive. So, \( 2 - \log(x - 2) > 0 \). Let me write that down:

\( 2 - \log(x - 2) > 0 \)

Hmm, so I can rewrite this inequality to solve for \( \log(x - 2) \):

\( 2 > \log(x - 2) \)

Which is the same as:

\( \log(x - 2) < 2 \)

Alright, since the logarithm here is base 10, I know that \( \log(a) < b \) implies that \( a < 10^b \) when \( a > 0 \). But wait, is \( x - 2 \) necessarily positive? Let me check.

Looking back at the original function, the denominator has \( \log(x - 2) \). So, \( x - 2 \) must be positive. Therefore, \( x > 2 \). So, \( x - 2 > 0 \), which is required for the inner logarithm. 

So, \( x > 2 \) is one condition. Now, going back to the inequality \( \log(x - 2) < 2 \), I can solve for x:

\( x - 2 < 10^2 \) since \( \log_{10}(x - 2) < 2 \) implies \( x - 2 < 100 \).

So, \( x < 102 \).

Wait, so putting that together with the earlier condition \( x > 2 \), we have \( 2 < x < 102 \). But that's just the condition for the logarithm in the denominator. 

But remember, it's not just \( \log(x - 2) \); it's \( \log(2 - \log(x - 2)) \). So, the argument of this logarithm must also be positive. So, I need:

\( 2 - \log(x - 2) > 0 \)

Which again gives \( \log(x - 2) < 2 \), so \( x < 102 \), as before. But also, we need to make sure that \( 2 - \log(x - 2) \) is not zero because the denominator can't be zero. So, \( 2 - \log(x - 2) \neq 0 \) which implies \( \log(x - 2) \neq 2 \). But \( \log(x - 2) = 2 \) implies \( x - 2 = 10^2 = 100 \), so \( x = 102 \). So, \( x \neq 102 \). 

So, now, combining all these conditions:

1. \( x > 2 \)
2. \( x < 102 \)
3. \( x \neq 102 \)

Therefore, the domain is \( (2, 102) \). Wait, but hold on, is that all? Let me double-check.

Wait, in the denominator, we have \( \log(2 - \log(x - 2)) \). So, we must have \( 2 - \log(x - 2) > 0 \), which we already solved as \( x < 102 \). Also, \( \log(x - 2) \) must be defined, so \( x - 2 > 0 \) which is \( x > 2 \). So, together, \( 2 < x < 102 \).

But wait, is there anything else? Let me think. The numerator is just \( 2 - x \), which doesn't impose any restrictions since it's linear. So, the only restrictions come from the denominator. 

But hold on, let me check if \( 2 - x \) can be zero. If \( 2 - x = 0 \), then x = 2, but x = 2 is not allowed because \( \log(x - 2) \) becomes \( \log(0) \), which is undefined. So, we don't have to worry about the numerator being zero in the domain.

Wait, but just to be thorough, is there a possibility that the denominator might be zero at any point in \( (2, 102) \)? Let's check. Let me see if \( 2 - \log(x - 2) = 0 \) for any x in \( (2, 102) \). That would happen when \( \log(x - 2) = 2 \), which as we saw earlier implies \( x = 102 \). But \( x = 102 \) is not in \( (2, 102) \), so in reality, \( 2 - \log(x - 2) \) is never zero in the domain \( (2, 102) \). Therefore, we don't have to exclude any points in the interval \( (2, 102) \).

So, the domain is \( (2, 102) \). Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about if the inner logarithm could affect the domain more.

Wait, the inner logarithm is \( \log(x - 2) \), which is defined for \( x - 2 > 0 \), so \( x > 2 \). Then, the outer logarithm is \( \log(2 - \log(x - 2)) \), which is defined when \( 2 - \log(x - 2) > 0 \). So, that's the same as \( \log(x - 2) < 2 \), which as we solved earlier, gives \( x < 102 \). So, yeah, combining these, we have \( 2 < x < 102 \).

Is there any other point where the denominator could be undefined? The denominator is only undefined if the argument is zero or negative. We already handled the argument being zero by excluding \( x = 102 \), and the argument being negative would require \( 2 - \log(x - 2) < 0 \), which is \( \log(x - 2) > 2 \), so \( x - 2 > 100 \), so \( x > 102 \). But \( x > 102 \) is outside our interval, so we don't have to worry about that either.

Therefore, the only restrictions are \( 2 < x < 102 \), so the domain is \( (2, 102) \).

Wait, but hold on, the original function is \( \frac{2 - x}{\log(2 - \log(x - 2))} \). So, is there a possibility that \( \log(2 - \log(x - 2)) \) could be negative, making the denominator negative? Because if the denominator is negative, the function would be negative over negative, which would be positive. But in terms of domain, it's still just where the denominator is defined and not zero. So, even if the denominator is negative, as long as it's not zero, it's fine.

But wait, for the logarithm, as long as \( 2 - \log(x - 2) \) is positive, the logarithm is defined. So, as long as \( 2 - \log(x - 2) > 0 \), which is \( x < 102 \), weâ€™re good. So, even if \( 2 - \log(x - 2) \) is negative, the denominator is undefined. So, the domain is only where \( 2 - \log(x - 2) > 0 \), which is \( x < 102 \), and \( x > 2 \).

So, yeah, the domain is \( (2, 102) \). But wait, hold on, another thought: the numerator is \( 2 - x \). So, if \( x = 2 \), the numerator is zero. But in the denominator, when \( x = 2 \), \( \log(x - 2) = \log(0) \), which is undefined. So, x can't be 2. So, the domain is open at 2.

But wait, another thing: when we have \( \log(x - 2) \), the base 10 logarithm, is that okay for x values less than 2? Well, the logarithm is defined only for positive arguments, so if x - 2 is positive, which is x > 2. So, x > 2 is necessary.

So, combining all these, I think the domain is \( (2, 102) \). But let me just verify with some test points.

Let me pick x = 3. Then, \( x - 2 = 1 \), so \( \log(x - 2) = 0 \). Then, \( 2 - \log(x - 2) = 2 - 0 = 2 \), which is positive, so denominator is defined, and the function is \( (2 - 3)/\log(2) = (-1)/\log(2) \), which is defined.

Now, x = 50. Then, \( x - 2 = 48 \), \( \log(48) \approx 1.6812 \), so \( 2 - 1.6812 = 0.3188 \), which is positive. So, denominator is \( \log(0.3188) \), which is undefined because 0.3188 is less than 1, so \( \log(0.3188) \) is negative. So, denominator is negative, but it's defined because the argument is positive. Wait, no, wait, actually, 2 - log(x - 2) is positive here, so it's okay. The denominator is defined, but negative.

But is that allowed? The function can have negative values as long as the denominator is defined. So, yes, x=50 is in the domain.

Wait, but if the denominator is negative, the function would be negative, but as long as it's defined, it's okay. So, x=50 is in the domain.

Wait, but let me pick x=101. Then, \( x - 2 = 99 \), \( \log(99) \approx 1.9956 \), so \( 2 - 1.9956 = 0.0044 \), which is positive. So, denominator is \( \log(0.0044) \), which is negative because 0.0044 is less than 1. So, denominator is negative, but it's still defined.

Wait, but the problem is, if the denominator is negative, it's just negative, but as long as it's defined, it's okay. So, x=101 is in the domain.

Wait, but hold on, if I pick x=102, then \( x - 2 = 100 \), \( \log(100) = 2 \), so \( 2 - 2 = 0 \), which makes the denominator undefined. So, x cannot be 102.

But, wait, is there another value of x where \( 2 - \log(x - 2) \) equals zero? As we saw earlier, that occurs at x=102. So, x=102 is excluded.

But 102 is the upper limit, so x approaches 102 from the left, but doesn't include 102.

Similarly, when x approaches 2 from the right, \( x - 2 \) approaches 0 from the right, so \( \log(x - 2) \) approaches negative infinity. So, \( 2 - \log(x - 2) \) approaches positive infinity, so the denominator approaches infinity as x approaches 2 from the right. So, the denominator is defined approaching infinity, but as x approaches 2, the function approaches negative infinity because numerator is approaching 0 and denominator is approaching positive infinity.

But in terms of the domain, x=2 is excluded because denominator is undefined there, and x=102 is excluded because denominator is undefined there.

So, the domain is all real numbers between 2 and 102, not including 2 and 102. So, in interval notation, that's \( (2, 102) \).

Wait, but let me just think again: is there any other point where the denominator could be zero? For example, suppose if \( 2 - \log(x - 2) = 0 \), which we saw only happens at x=102. So, that's the only point where the denominator is zero, which is excluded. So, the domain is everything between 2 and 102, not including those endpoints.

Wait, but in my earlier test, I saw that at x=50, the denominator is negative but still defined. So, functions can have negative denominators and still be defined as long as the denominator is not zero. So, x=50 is fine.

So, yeah, putting it all together, the domain is (2, 102).

Wait, but just to make sure, let me consider a point like x=100. Then, \( x - 2 = 98 \), \( \log(98) \approx 1.9912 \), so \( 2 - 1.9912 = 0.0088 \), positive. So, denominator is \( \log(0.0088) \approx \log(0.0088) \approx -2.056 \). So, the denominator is negative, but it's defined. So, the function is defined at x=100.

Wait, but what about x=101? As I did before, \( x - 2 = 99 \), \( \log(99) \approx 1.9956 \), so \( 2 - 1.9956 = 0.0044 \), positive. So, denominator is \( \log(0.0044) \approx -2.35 \), still defined.

Wait, is there any x where \( 2 - \log(x - 2) \) is negative? Let's see. If \( 2 - \log(x - 2) < 0 \), then \( \log(x - 2) > 2 \), which implies \( x - 2 > 10^2 = 100 \), so \( x > 102 \). So, for x > 102, denominator is negative, but still defined.

But in our domain, we have x < 102, so denominator stays positive. So, in the interval (2, 102), denominator is positive, but can be very small (approaching zero as x approaches 102 from the left) or larger (approaching infinity as x approaches 2 from the right). So, the function is defined throughout that interval.

Wait, but could the numerator cause any issues? The numerator is \( 2 - x \). At x=2, numerator is 0, but x=2 is not in the domain. For x > 2, numerator is negative, denominator is positive (since 2 - log(x - 2) is positive in the domain), so the function is negative in (2, 102). So, no undefined behavior except for the denominator.

Therefore, the domain is (2, 102). So, in interval notation, that's \( (2, 102) \).

Wait, but another thought: let me check if \( 2 - x \) is ever zero in the domain. At x=2, which is not in the domain, so not a problem. So, all right.

Wait, just to make sure, let me think about if there's any other way the function could be undefined.

Wait, the only undefined point in the function is when the denominator is zero, which is at x=102. So, that's the only point excluded from the domain. So, the domain is (2, 102). 

So, yeah, I think that's it. The domain is (2, 102). So, in interval notation, that's \( (2, 102) \).

**Final Answer**
The domain of the function is \boxed{(2, 102)}.
</think>

To find the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2 - x}{\log(2 - \log(x - 2))} \), we need to ensure that the function is defined and the denominator is not zero. 

1. The denominator is \( \log(2 - \log(x - 2)) \). For the logarithm to be defined, its argument must be positive:
   \[
   2 - \log(x - 2) > 0
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \log(x - 2) < 2
   \]
   Converting this to exponential form, we get:
   \[
   x - 2 < 10^2 \implies x - 2 < 100 \implies x < 102
   \]

2. Additionally, the argument inside the logarithm must be positive, so \( x - 2 > 0 \implies x > 2 \).

3. We also need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. This happens when:
   \[
   2 - \log(x - 2) = 0 \implies \log(x - 2) = 2 \implies x - 2 = 10^2 \implies x = 102
   \]
   Since \( x = 102 \) is not in the interval \( (2, 102) \), it is excluded.

Combining these conditions, we get the domain as \( 2 < x < 102 \).

Thus, the domain of the function is \(\boxed{(2, 102)}\).
