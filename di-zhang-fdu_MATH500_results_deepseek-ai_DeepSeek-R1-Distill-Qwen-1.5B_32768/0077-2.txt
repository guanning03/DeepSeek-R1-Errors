Question:
What is the shortest distance that can be travelled if you start at any point, $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$, and visit the other three points once?

[asy]
pair A,B,C, D;
A = (-3,3); B = (3,0); C = (0, -4); D = (0,0);
draw(D--B--C--cycle); draw(D--A--B--cycle);draw(D--A--C--cycle);
label("$A$", A, NW);label("$B$", B, E); label("$C$", C, S);label("$D$", D, NE);
label("3", D--B, S); label("6", A--B, NE); label("6", A--C, SW); label("4", D--C, NW+N);
label("5", A--D, SE+NE); label("5", C--B, E);
[/asy]

Correct Answer:
To visit all four points, we notice that we must travel along at least three different segments. The sum of the shortest three segments is $3+4+5=12$, but we quickly notice that it is impossible to start at one point and visit the other three points by traveling on a path with length $12$ ($DB$, $BC$, and $CD$ do not let us visit point $A$, and it is not possible to travel on $AD$, $CD$, and $BD$ in a continuous path). We now look for a path with length $13$ and notice that traveling from point $A$ to $D$ to $B$ to $C$ works. Alternatively, $B$ to $D$ to $C$ to $A$ also works. Both paths have length $\boxed{13}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. It involves four points labeled A, B, C, and D. The goal is to figure out the shortest distance someone can travel if they start at any of these points, go to each of the other three points exactly once. Hmm, okay. So, this sounds like a traveling salesman problem, where you want to find the shortest route that visits each city (or point, in this case) exactly once without retracing any steps. But since it's only four points, maybe I can visualize it or even sketch it out.

First, let me try to understand the figure they provided. It's an Asymptote code, which I know is a type of diagram used in mathematics, often for geometry. The points are labeled A, B, C, D. The connections are as follows:

- D is connected to B, A, and C.
- B is connected to D, A, and C.
- C is connected to D, B, and A.
- A is connected to D, B, and C.

Wait, so all four points are connected to each other? Because D is connected to B, A, and C; B is connected to D, A, and C; same with C and A. So, actually, the figure is a complete graph with four nodes: a triangle formed by points B, C, and D, and another triangle connected to A through D. Let me confirm that.

Looking at the Asymptote code:

- draw(D--B--C--cycle); So, D connected to B connected to C connected back to D. That makes triangle DBC.

- draw(D--A--B--cycle); So, D connected to A connected to B connected back to D. That makes triangle DAB.

- draw(D--A--C--cycle); So, D connected to A connected to C connected back to D. That makes triangle DAC.

And then the labels are given: 3, 6, 6, 4, 5, 5 on the respective edges. Let me make sure I get the distances right.

From the Asymptote code:

- label("3", D--B, S); So, the distance from D to B is 3 units.

- label("6", A--B, NE); So, A to B is 6 units.

- label("6", A--C, SW); So, A to C is 6 units.

- label("4", D--C, NW+N); So, D to C is 4 units.

- label("5", A--D, SE+NE); So, A to D is 5 units.

- label("5", C--B, E); So, C to B is 5 units.

Alright, so summarizing the edges and their lengths:

- AB = 6

- AC = 6

- AD = 5

- BC = 5

- BD = 3

- CD = 4

So, now I can perhaps sketch this out mentally or maybe on paper. Let me note down all the edges:

Points: A, B, C, D.

Edges:

AB = 6

AC = 6

AD = 5

BC = 5

BD = 3

CD = 4

So, the distances are as above. Now, the problem is to find the shortest distance that starts at any point, visits the other three points once, and returns to the starting point? Wait, no. Wait, actually, let me read the question again.

"What is the shortest distance that can be travelled if you start at any point, A, B, C, or D, and visit the other three points once."

Hmm. So, does it mean that we can start at any point, go to the other three, and then stop? Or is it a round trip? The wording is a bit ambiguous, but in typical problems like this, it's usually a round trip, meaning you start at a point, visit the other three, and return home. But the question says "visit the other three points once," so maybe it's just a closed path visiting each once, starting at any point.

Wait, actually, the exact wording is: "start at any point, A, B, C, or D, and visit the other three points once." So, that could mean starting at one point, then going to three others, but not necessarily returning. Hmm. But in the Asymptote code, all points are connected to all others, so perhaps it's a round trip.

Wait, but if it's a round trip, then we need to find the shortest possible cycle that goes through all four points, starting and ending at the same point. That is, the shortest Hamiltonian cycle.

But Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. So, that's exactly what we need.

So, the problem reduces to finding the shortest Hamiltonian cycle in this graph.

Given that, let's note the edges and their lengths:

AB = 6

AC = 6

AD = 5

BC = 5

BD = 3

CD = 4

So, let's see. To find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle, we need to consider all possible cycles that visit each of the four points exactly once and return to the start.

Since it's a complete graph, all possible cycles can be considered, but with four nodes, the number of possible cycles is (4-1)! / 2 = 3. So, 6 possible cycles, considering direction.

But since the graph is undirected, each cycle can be traversed in two directions, so we can double-check.

Wait, actually, for four points, the number of distinct cycles is (4-1)! / 2 = 3, but since each cycle can be traversed in two directions, the total number of unique cycles is 3 * 2 = 6.

But maybe it's better to list all possible routes.

Alternatively, we can calculate the total distance for each possible permutation of the starting point and compute the distances.

But perhaps to make it manageable, since it's only four points, we can fix a starting point and compute the shortest cycle, then check all starting points.

Let me fix point A as the starting point and compute the shortest cycle.

So, starting at A, the possible permutations of visiting B, C, D are:

1. A -> B -> C -> D -> A

2. A -> B -> D -> C -> A

3. A -> C -> B -> D -> A

4. A -> C -> D -> B -> A

5. A -> D -> B -> C -> A

6. A -> D -> C -> B -> A

But since in a cycle, the starting point is arbitrary, perhaps we can fix A and compute the shortest path, then multiply by 4 for starting at each point.

Wait, no. Actually, if we fix A, we can compute the shortest path starting at A, visiting B, C, D, and returning to A. Then, multiply by 4 if the graph is symmetric, but in this case, it's not necessarily symmetric, so we have to compute for each starting point.

But since the graph is symmetric, we can compute the shortest cycle once and then multiply it by the number of starting points? Wait, no, because each starting point would have a different total distance, unless the graph is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total distance for each possible cycle.

But maybe an easier way is to note that the minimal Hamiltonian cycle will involve the shortest possible connections.

Looking at the edges, the shortest edges are BD = 3, CD = 4, AC = 6, but wait, AC is 6. Wait, no, wait: AC is 6, but BD is 3, which is the shortest edge. So, perhaps starting at A, going to D is 5, then D to C is 4, then C to B is 5, then B to A is 6. So, total distance: 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20. Hmm, but that seems long.

Alternatively, starting at A, go to B (6), then B to C (5), then C to D (4), then D to A (5). Total: 6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20. Hmm, same.

Alternatively, starting at A, go to D (5), D to C (4), C to B (5), B to A (6). Total: 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20. Same.

Alternatively, starting at A, go to B (6), B to D (3), D to C (4), C to A (6). Total: 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 19. Wait, that's shorter.

Wait, so that's 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 19. Is that correct? Let me check: A to B is 6, B to D is 3, D to C is 4, C to A is 6. Yes, that adds up to 19.

Wait, is that the shortest? Let me see if there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, starting at A, go to D (5), D to C (4), C to B (5), B to A (6). Total: 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20.

Alternatively, A to B (6), B to D (3), D to A (5), A to C (6). Total: 6 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 20.

Alternatively, A to C (6), C to D (4), D to B (3), B to A (6). Total: 6 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 19. Hmm, same as before.

Wait, so starting at A, the minimal cycle is 19.

Similarly, if we start at B, what's the minimal cycle? Let's see.

Starting at B, going to A (6), A to D (5), D to C (4), C to B (5). Total: 6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20.

Alternatively, starting at B, go to D (3), D to A (5), A to C (6), C to B (5). Total: 3 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 19.

Alternatively, B to C (5), C to D (4), D to A (5), A to B (6). Total: 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20.

Alternatively, B to A (6), A to C (6), C to D (4), D to B (3). Total: 6 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 19.

So, starting at B, the minimal cycle is 19 as well.

Similarly, starting at C:

C to D (4), D to B (3), B to A (6), A to C (6). Total: 4 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 19.

Alternatively, C to D (4), D to A (5), A to B (6), B to C (5). Total: 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 20.

Alternatively, C to B (5), B to A (6), A to D (5), D to C (4). Total: 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 20.

Alternatively, C to A (6), A to D (5), D to B (3), B to C (5). Total: 6 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 19.

So, starting at C, the minimal cycle is 19.

Similarly, starting at D:

D to C (4), C to B (5), B to A (6), A to D (5). Total: 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 20.

Alternatively, D to A (5), A to B (6), B to C (5), C to D (4). Total: 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 20.

Alternatively, D to A (5), A to C (6), C to B (5), B to D (3). Total: 5 + 6 + 5 + 3 = 19.

Alternatively, D to B (3), B to A (6), A to C (6), C to D (4). Total: 3 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 19.

So, starting at D, minimal cycle is 19.

Thus, regardless of the starting point, the minimal cycle is 19. So, the answer is 19.

Wait, but let me verify if 19 is indeed the minimal.

Is there a cycle that can be shorter?

Let me think. If we start at A, as above, the minimal cycle was 19. Is there a way to have a cycle with less than 19?

For example, if we go A -> D -> C -> B -> A, that's 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20, which is longer.

Or A -> B -> D -> C -> A: 6 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 18? Wait, hold on: 6 + 3 is 9, 9 + 4 is 13, 13 + 5 is 18. Wait, 18? But that seems shorter.

Wait, hold on, I must have miscalculated earlier.

Wait, starting at A: A -> B (6), B -> D (3), D -> C (4), C -> A (6). Total: 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 19.

Wait, but A -> B (6), B -> D (3), D -> C (4), C -> A (6). So, 6 + 3 is 9, 9 + 4 is 13, 13 + 6 is 19. So that's correct.

Wait, but if I rearrange: A -> D (5), D -> C (4), C -> B (5), B -> A (6). So, 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20. So, 20 is longer.

Alternatively, A -> D (5), D -> B (3), B -> C (5), C -> A (6). So, 5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 19.

Wait, so 19 is the minimal.

But in the previous calculation, I thought of A -> B -> D -> C -> A: 6 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 18, but that can't be because from C to A is 6, not 5. Wait, hold on, from C to A is 6, so that would make it 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 19.

Wait, so is there a cycle that can be 18? Let me see.

If I have A -> B (6), B -> C (5), C -> D (4), D -> A (5). So, 6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20.

Alternatively, A -> C (6), C -> D (4), D -> B (3), B -> A (6). That's 6 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 19.

Alternatively, A -> D (5), D -> B (3), B -> A (6), but wait, that's a triangle, but we need to include C as well.

Wait, perhaps A -> D (5), D -> C (4), C -> B (5), B -> A (6). That adds up to 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20.

Wait, is there a way to have a cycle that goes through three edges that are shorter? Let me see.

Wait, the edges have lengths 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6. So, the shortest edges are 3, 4, 5. So, perhaps combining the shortest edges in some way.

Wait, is there a cycle that uses edges of length 3, 4, 5, and another 5? Like, 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 17? But that would require four edges, each of which is used once. But in a cycle, you can't have four edges with four unique edges because the graph is a complete graph, but in reality, the connections are limited.

Wait, but in the current graph, the edges are:

AB = 6

AC = 6

AD = 5

BC = 5

BD = 3

CD = 4

So, the edges are only 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6. So, no edge with a length less than 3.

Wait, but 3 is the shortest edge.

So, the minimal cycle would have to include the 3-length edge, which is BD.

So, starting at A, going to D (5), then to B (3), then to C (4), then to A (6). So, 5 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 18.

Wait, is that possible? Wait, from A to D is 5, D to B is 3, B to C is 5, and C to A is 6. So, that would be 5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 19. Wait, that's still 19.

Wait, but hold on, is there a way to go from B to C via another path? No, because the direct edge is 5.

Wait, maybe another route: A -> B (6), B -> D (3), D -> C (4), C -> A (6). That's 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 19.

Alternatively, A -> C (6), C -> D (4), D -> B (3), B -> A (6). That's 6 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 19.

Wait, so is 19 the minimal?

Wait, but what if we go A -> D (5), D -> C (4), C -> B (5), B -> A (6). That's 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20.

Alternatively, A -> D (5), D -> C (4), C -> A (6), A -> B (6). That's 5 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 21.

No, that's longer.

Alternatively, A -> D (5), D -> A (5), but that's a triangle, but we need to include B and C.

Wait, so it's not possible to have a cycle with only three edges.

Alternatively, is there a cycle that goes through four edges but with a total of 17? But the edges are only 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6. So, 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 17. But is that possible?

Wait, is there a cycle that uses BD (3), CD (4), AC (6), and AB (6). So, 3 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 19. Wait, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, BD (3), BC (5), CA (6), AB (6). So, 3 + 5 + 6 + 6 = 20.

Alternatively, BD (3), DC (4), CB (5), BA (6). So, 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18. Wait, but from C to B is 5, and B to A is 6, but is that a cycle?

Wait, starting at B, going to D (3), D to C (4), C to B (5), B to A (6). So, that's 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18. But is that a cycle? Wait, from C to B is 5, which is an edge, but from A back to B is 6. So, does that form a cycle?

Yes, it does. So, starting at B, going to D, D to C, C to B, B to A, and back to B.

Wait, but that's five segments: BD, DC, CB, BA, and then back to B. Wait, but that is a cycle, right? So, that's a cycle that starts at B, goes to D, D to C, C to B, B to A, and then back to B. But that's five edges, but the cycle must visit each point exactly once, except for the starting point, which is visited twice.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's specified as "visit the other three points once." So, does that mean that starting at B, you go to D, D to C, C to A, and then A back to B? Is that allowed?

Wait, no, because if you go from C to A, then from A back to B, that's another edge, but in that case, you have a cycle that starts at B, goes to D, D to C, C to A, A to B. So, that's four edges, each visited once, except for B, which is visited twice.

But the problem states "visit the other three points once." So, perhaps starting at B, the cycle is B -> D -> C -> A -> B. So, that's four edges: BD, DC, CA, AB.

But wait, CA is 6, AB is 6. So, the total distance would be 3 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 19. Wait, but hold on, that seems to be the same as the previous cycles.

Wait, but if you do that, you have BD (3), DC (4), CA (6), AB (6). So, 19. Alternatively, BD (3), DC (4), CB (5), BA (6). That's 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18. But does that form a cycle?

From B to D (3), D to C (4), C to B (5), B to A (6). That's a cycle: B -> D -> C -> B -> A -> B. Wait, but that's not correct because you can't have B -> A and then A -> B again. Wait, no, you have B -> A, but if you've already visited A, you can't go back.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in graph theory, a cycle must return to the starting point without repeating any edge. So, for a cycle starting at B, the path must go through all other points once each, and return to B.

So, a cycle must have four edges, each connecting a unique vertex, except for the starting/ending point.

So, starting at B, the cycle would have to go through A, C, D without repeating any edges.

So, the cycle can't include BD (3), DC (4), CB (5), BA (6) because BA is the same as AB, but that would require starting and ending at B, but in that case, you'd have to traverse BA, which is the same as AB, but in that case, the cycle would be B -> A -> C -> D -> B, which is four edges: BA (6), AC (6), CD (4), DB (3). So, total distance is 6 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 19.

Similarly, starting at B, the cycle could be B -> C -> D -> A -> B. So, BC (5), CD (4), DA (5), AB (6). Total: 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20.

Alternatively, B -> A -> C -> D -> B: BA (6), AC (6), CD (4), DB (3). Total: 6 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 19.

Alternatively, B -> A -> D -> C -> B: BA (6), AD (5), DC (4), CB (5). Total: 6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20.

So, in this case, the minimal cycle is 19.

Therefore, whether starting at A, B, C, or D, the minimal cycle is 19. So, the answer should be 19.

But let me double-check if there's a cycle that can have a shorter distance.

Wait, let's see. The minimal edges are BD (3), CD (4), BC (5), AC (6), AD (5), AB (6). So, is there a way to have a cycle that uses BD (3), CD (4), and then two other edges that sum to 15, making total 18? But 15 is an odd number, and the edges are integers, so maybe 18 is even.

Wait, 18 is even, but is there a way to have a cycle with total distance 18?

Wait, to have a cycle with total distance 18, we need four edges that sum to 18. The edges available are 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6.

So, 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18.

Is there a cycle that uses BD (3), DC (4), CB (5), and BA (6). But that would be 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18. But is that a cycle?

From B to D (3), D to C (4), C to B (5), and B to A (6). So, starting at B, going to D, D to C, C to B, and then B to A. But that's five segments, but in the cycle, you have to return to B without repeating edges.

Wait, but in a cycle, you can't have repeated edges. So, if we have edges BD, DC, CB, BA, that's four edges, each used once, and it's a cycle. So, starting at B, going to D, D to C, C to B, and B to A. Wait, but from C to B is 5, and B to A is 6, but does that form a cycle? Let me see.

Wait, starting at B, going to D (3), D to C (4), C to B (5), and then B to A (6). So, the cycle is B -> D -> C -> B -> A -> B. Wait, but that's not a cycle because you end at A, not B. So, that's not a valid cycle.

Alternatively, you need to return to B from A, but that would be BA, which is 6, which is already used in BC.

Wait, hold on, maybe it's impossible to have a cycle with four edges that sum to 18 without repeating edges or without being able to start and end at the same point.

Alternatively, perhaps using BD (3), DC (4), CB (5), and BA (6). But as above, that would require going from B to A after C, which is not possible because from C, the only edge back is CB (5), and BA is 6. But then, you can't go from C to B and then to A without repeating edges.

Wait, maybe it's not possible. So, perhaps 18 is not achievable.

Wait, another idea: Maybe not all edges have to be used. For example, maybe we can have a cycle that uses three edges and skips one, but that doesn't make sense because in a cycle, you need to visit each point exactly once, except for the starting point, which is visited twice.

So, in a cycle, you can't skip any points. So, you must traverse all four points, which means four edges. So, four edges, each used once.

Thus, the minimal sum would be 19.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps using the triangle inequality. The minimal cycle should be less than or equal to the sum of the three smallest edges. The three smallest edges are 3 (BD), 4 (CD), and 5 (AD or AC). So, 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. But that can't be, because you can't have a cycle with just those.

Wait, that's not applicable because the cycle must include all four points.

Wait, another idea: Maybe using the triangle inequality for quadrilaterals? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal spanning tree is different.

Wait, actually, the minimal spanning tree is the minimal set of edges that connect all the vertices without forming a cycle. For four points, the MST would have three edges. But since we're dealing with a cycle, we need to find the minimal cycle.

But in this case, the minimal spanning tree would have three edges, but the minimal cycle is going to be longer.

Wait, the minimal spanning tree for these four points would be the three shortest edges: BD (3), CD (4), and AC (6). So, the total is 3 + 4 + 6 = 13. But that's just the MST, not necessarily the minimal cycle.

So, perhaps the minimal cycle is the MST plus the shortest edge not in the MST.

Wait, in this case, the MST is 3, 4, 6. The remaining edge is AD (5). So, the minimal cycle would be the MST plus the shortest edge not in the MST, which is 5. So, 13 + 5 = 18.

But wait, that doesn't make sense, because 18 is longer than the 19 we found earlier.

Wait, no, the minimal cycle should be the MST plus the minimal edge that connects two components. But in this case, the graph is connected, so the minimal cycle is the MST plus the minimal edge not in the MST.

Wait, but I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the minimal cycle should be the minimal sum of four edges that form a cycle. So, that would be equal to the sum of the three shortest edges plus the shortest edge connecting the two endpoints of the shortest edge.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cycle is 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 17, but that would require edges BD (3), DC (4), CB (5), BA (6). But as above, that doesn't form a cycle because it would require going from C to B and then B to A without connecting back to the starting point.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the traveling salesman problem.

Given four cities, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

So, in this case, the minimal TSP tour is 19, as we've already found.

Therefore, I think 19 is the correct answer.

But to make sure, let me think of another approach.

Let me try to calculate the total distance of all possible cycles and find the minimal one.

But that would be tedious, but perhaps manageable.

First, all possible cycles:

1. A -> B -> C -> D -> A: 6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20

2. A -> B -> D -> C -> A: 6 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 18

Wait, hold on, 6 (A-B) + 3 (B-D) + 4 (D-C) + 5 (C-A) = 18.

Wait, is that a valid cycle? Starting at A, going to B (6), B to D (3), D to C (4), C to A (5). So, 6 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 18.

But wait, isn't that a cycle? Because you start at A, go to B, D, C, A. So, yes, that's a valid cycle. So, that's 18.

But earlier, I thought that starting at A, going to D (5), D to C (4), C to B (5), B to A (6). That's 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20.

Alternatively, starting at A, going to D (5), D to B (3), B to C (5), C to A (6). That's 5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 19.

Wait, so this gives me two different cycles, one with 18 and another with 19.

Wait, so is 18 correct?

Wait, let's check.

Starting at A: A -> B -> D -> C -> A.

Distance: AB = 6, BD = 3, DC = 4, CA = 5. So, 6 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 18.

Wait, this seems a valid cycle.

But wait, is D connected to C? Yes, CD = 4. C connected to A? Yes, CA = 5.

So, this is a cycle of four edges: AB, BD, DC, CA. So, 6 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 18.

Wait, but is that a cycle? From A to B, then B to D, then D to C, then C to A. So, starting at A, going to B, then D, then C, then back to A. So, yes, that's a cycle.

So, distance is 6 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 18.

Wait, but wait, in this cycle, you go from C to A, which is 5, which is a longer edge, but it's necessary to connect back to A.

So, that seems shorter than the previous cycles.

Wait, but is that actually a cycle? Because starting at A, you go to B, then to D, then to C, then back to A. So, that's a closed loop, right? So, that's a valid cycle.

So, in that case, the minimal cycle is 18.

Wait, but hold on, let me confirm that. Because when I first considered starting at A, I thought of going to D, then to C, then to B, then back to A. That's 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20.

But now, starting at A, going to B, then D, then C, then back to A is a cycle with 18.

But in that case, why didn't I get that before?

Because earlier, I considered the cycle A -> D -> C -> B -> A, which is 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20.

But if you have A -> B -> D -> C -> A, that's 6 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 18.

So, is that a shorter cycle?

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it says draw(D--B--C--cycle); which is triangle D-B-C, and draw(D--A--B--cycle); which is triangle D-A-B, and draw(D--A--C--cycle); which is triangle D-A-C.

So, perhaps, to visualize, the figure is a triangle D-B-C, and another triangle connected to D: D-A-B and D-A-C.

So, perhaps, the connecting triangles share the edge D-B and D-A.

So, in this figure, the connections are:

- D connected to A, B, C.

- A connected to D, B, C.

- B connected to D, A, C.

- C connected to D, A, B.

So, the figure is a complete graph with four nodes, where D is connected to A, B, C.

A is connected to D, B, C.

B is connected to D, A, C.

C is connected to D, A, B.

So, if you think of this as a graph, you can have multiple paths.

So, to get back to the problem, the minimal cycle is 18, as above.

But wait, let's make sure.

Wait, is 18 actually the minimal?

Wait, the edges are 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6.

So, the minimal cycle should use the four smallest edges.

Wait, the four smallest edges are BD (3), DC (4), CA (5), and AB (6). But wait, AB is 6, which is the same as AC (6). So, using BD (3), DC (4), CA (5), and AB (6). Wait, but AB is 6, which is already used in AC.

Wait, no, in the cycle, you can't reuse edges.

Wait, in the cycle A -> B -> D -> C -> A, you are using edges AB (6), BD (3), DC (4), and CA (5). So, all edges are unique.

So, that's a valid cycle with edges 6, 3, 4, 5, summing to 18.

So, that's the minimal cycle.

Wait, but in that case, why did I get confused earlier?

Because I thought of starting at A and going to D, but if you can start at A and go to B first, then to D, then to C, then back to A, that's also a cycle.

So, 18 is indeed the minimal cycle.

So, why did I think of 19 earlier? Because I was considering starting at A and going to D, which is 5, then to C (4), then to B (5), then back to A (6). So, that's 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20.

But since there's a shorter cycle that starts at A, goes to B, then to D, then to C, then back to A, that's 18, which is shorter.

Therefore, 18 is indeed the minimal cycle.

So, that means the answer is 18.

But wait, let me check if there's a cycle with even shorter total distance.

Suppose we try to find a cycle that uses BD (3), DC (4), CB (5), and AB (6). So, 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18.

But wait, in that case, starting at B, going to D (3), D to C (4), C to B (5), and B to A (6). So, that's a cycle: B -> D -> C -> B -> A -> B. Wait, no, that would not be a cycle because you end at A, not B.

Alternatively, starting at B, go to D (3), D to C (4), C to A (6), A to B (5). Wait, but CA is 5? Wait, CA is 6. Wait, no, AC is 6.

Wait, starting at B, go to D (3), D to C (4), C to A (6), A to B (6). That's 3 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 19.

Alternatively, starting at B, go to D (3), D to C (4), C to B (5), B to A (6). So, 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18.

But in this case, starting at B, going to D, D to C, C to B, and then B to A.

But in this cycle, you have a loop: B -> D -> C -> B -> A -> B. But that's not a closed cycle because you end at A, not B.

Wait, in graph theory, a cycle must return to the starting vertex, which is B in this case.

So, that's a problem because after C, you go to B, which is the starting point, but you haven't returned to B yet. So, you have to go from B to A and then A back to B.

Wait, so that's not a cycle.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

In graph theory, a cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no repeated vertices except the starting/ending one.

So, starting at B, the cycle must be B -> D -> C -> B -> A -> B. But that's not a simple cycle because you can't have B -> A -> B.

Wait, no, in the cycle, you have to go through all other points once. So, starting at B, the cycle must go through A, C, D, and return to B. So, the path is B -> D -> C -> A -> B.

Which is four edges: BD (3), DC (4), CA (6), AB (6). So, total distance: 3 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 19.

Alternatively, B -> D -> C -> B -> A -> B. Wait, but that's five segments, but you can't have a cycle with five segments because it would have to return to B.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible to have a cycle that includes all four points with four edges.

Wait, no, in graph theory, a cycle must include all vertices, but in a graph with four vertices, a cycle must have at least three edges, forming a triangle.

But in this case, the graph is complete, so you can have a cycle with four edges.

Wait, but in our case, the cycle must include all four points, so four edges.

But in the case of starting at B, going to D, D to C, C to B, and then back to B, that's a cycle with four edges, but in reality, that's not a triangle.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the cycle.

Wait, no, in graph theory, a cycle is a closed path without repeating edges. So, a cycle with four edges would be a square, but in our case, the graph is such that you can have a square with four edges.

Wait, but in our graph, the connections are:

- A connected to D, B, C.

- B connected to A, D, C.

- C connected to A, B, D.

- D connected to A, B, C.

So, the graph is a complete graph on four vertices, with each vertex connected to the other three.

Thus, a cycle in this graph can be a triangle plus an additional edge, but in four vertices, the cycle must be a quadrilateral.

Wait, but a quadrilateral in a complete graph with four vertices is a four-node cycle, each node connected to the next, forming a square.

But in our case, the edges are:

- A connected to D, B, C.

- B connected to A, D, C.

- C connected to A, B, D.

- D connected to A, B, C.

So, to form a quadrilateral, say A -> B -> C -> D -> A.

But in our graph, is that possible?

From A to B: yes, AB = 6.

From B to C: yes, BC = 5.

From C to D: yes, CD = 4.

From D to A: yes, DA = 5.

So, that's a quadrilateral: A-B-C-D-A, which is 6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20.

Alternatively, another quadrilateral: A-D-B-C-A.

From A to D: 5.

From D to B: 3.

From B to C: 5.

From C to A: 6.

So, total distance: 5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 19.

So, that's a shorter cycle.

Wait, so starting at A, going to D (5), then to B (3), then to C (5), then back to A (6). That's a cycle with edges 5, 3, 5, 6, which sum to 19.

Alternatively, starting at A, D, B, C, A.

So, that's a cycle with 5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 19.

Alternatively, starting at A, D, C, B, A. So, edges 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20.

So, in that case, the minimal quadrilateral cycle is 19.

So, the minimal cycle is 19.

But earlier, I thought of starting at A, going to B, D, C, A, which is 6 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 18, but that's not a quadrilateral, because it's not a cycle that returns to A after four edges.

Wait, in that case, starting at A, going to B, D, C, A is actually a quadrilateral, but it's a cycle with four edges: A-B (6), B-D (3), D-C (4), C-A (5). So, that's a quadrilateral with edges 6, 3, 4, 5, which sum to 18.

Wait, but is that a cycle? Because in the quadrilateral A-B-D-C-A, you have four edges, each connecting consecutive points, and it's a cycle.

But in the Asymptote code, the figure was drawn as:

draw(D--B--C--cycle); // triangle D-B-C

draw(D--A--B--cycle); // triangle D-A-B

draw(D--A--C--cycle); // triangle D-A-C

So, the figure includes triangles D-B-C, D-A-B, and D-A-C.

So, in this figure, point D is connected to A, B, C.

So, perhaps, the quadrilateral A-B-D-C-A is formed by the two triangles D-B-C and D-A-B. So, starting at A, going to D, then to B, then to C, then back to A.

But in that case, the edges are AB (6), BD (3), DC (4), and CA (5). Wait, but CA is 5, but in the triangles, D-A is 5.

Wait, but CA is 6? Wait, no, the edges are:

From D to A: 5.

From A to B: 6.

From B to C: 5.

From C to D: 4.

So, the quadrilateral A-B-D-C-A is formed by the edges AB (6), BD (3), DC (4), and CA (5). So, yes, that's a valid quadrilateral cycle, with total distance 6 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 18.

Therefore, that's a cycle that doesn't go through all four points in a single quadrilateral, but through two triangles.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn as D-B-C, D-A-B, and D-A-C. So, the figure is a combination of those triangles, but when you traverse A-B-D-C-A, you are actually going through the outer edge of the figure, which is the triangle D-B-C and D-A-B.

But in that case, the cycle A-B-D-C-A is indeed a quadrilateral cycle that uses the two triangles.

So, in that case, the minimal cycle is 18.

But wait, another thought: Is there a cycle that uses the triangle D-A-B (edges DA=5, AB=6, BD=3) and triangle D-A-C (edges DA=5, AC=6, DC=4). So, if you go from A to D (5), then to B (3), then to C (5), then to A (6). So, that's the quadrilateral A-B-D-C-A, with edges 5, 3, 5, 6, totaling 19.

Alternatively, going from A to D (5), then to C (4), then to B (5), then to A (6). That's another quadrilateral: A-D-C-B-A, with edges 5, 4, 5, 6, total 19.

So, both of these cycles have total distance 19.

But the quadrilateral A-B-D-C-A has total distance 18, which is shorter.

Therefore, the minimal cycle is 18.

Wait, but hold on, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn as D-B-C, D-A-B, and D-A-C.

So, the figure is a combination of these three triangles, but the minimal cycle is the quadrilateral A-B-D-C-A, which is 18.

So, in conclusion, the minimal cycle is 18.

But let's verify that there isn't a cycle with a shorter total distance.

Suppose we try to find a cycle that uses BD (3), DC (4), CB (5), and AB (6). That's 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18.

But is that a cycle?

Starting at B, going to D (3), D to C (4), C to B (5), and B to A (6). So, that's a cycle: B-D-C-B-A.

But that's not a simple cycle because you can't have cycles that repeat vertices except the starting one.

Wait, no, in graph theory, a cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating any edges.

So, in this case, the cycle would have to start at B, go to D, D to C, C to B, and then B to A, and then A back to B. But that's not a simple cycle because you would have to go from A back to B, which is an edge.

Wait, but in terms of the graph, the cycle is B-D-C-B-A.

But that would require an edge from A back to B, which is 6.

But in the graph, that would be a cycle with edges BD (3), DC (4), CB (5), and BA (6). So, 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18.

But in graph terms, that's a cycle of four edges, which is a quadrilateral.

Wait, but in the figure, the edges are D-B, D-C, A-D, A-B, A-C, B-C.

So, the edges BD, DC, CB, BA, AD, AC.

So, the cycle B-D-C-B-A would correspond to edges BD (3), DC (4), CB (5), BA (6). So, these edges are present.

So, the cycle is B-D-C-B-A, which is a cycle that starts and ends at B, visiting D, C, A, and returning to B.

Wait, but in graph terms, that's a cycle with four edges, which is a quadrilateral. So, in that case, it's a valid cycle.

Therefore, the minimal cycle is 18.

So, in conclusion, the minimal cycle is 18.

But wait, in that case, why did I think of 19 earlier? Because I was considering starting at A, going to D, then to B, then to C, then back to A. But that's not a quadrilateral cycle; it's a cycle that goes through the triangles.

Wait, no, actually, that's a quadrilateral cycle as well.

Wait, the cycle is B-D-C-B-A, which is a quadrilateral.

But in that case, starting at B, moving to D, D to C, C back to B, and then B to A.

So, that's a cycle of four edges: BD, DC, CB, BA.

But in the figure, CB is 5, BA is 6, DC is 4, BD is 3.

So, total is 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18.

So, that's a valid cycle.

But now, I'm confused because I thought earlier that starting at A, going to D, then to B, then to C, then back to A, that's a cycle.

But that's actually a cycle that goes through all four points, but it's not a quadrilateral.

Wait, no, starting at A, going to D (5), D to B (3), B to C (5), C to A (6). So, that's a cycle with edges 5, 3, 5, 6, totaling 19.

But I just found another cycle that goes through all four points with total distance 18.

Therefore, the minimal cycle is 18.

Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, in graph theory, any cycle that includes all four points must have at least four edges. So, to include all four points, the minimal cycle is 18.

But in the Asymptote code, the drawing is as follows:

- D-B-C

- D-A-B

- D-A-C

So, the figure is a combination of these three triangles.

Therefore, the minimal cycle is the quadrilateral B-D-C-B-A, which is 18.

So, that's the minimal cycle.

Therefore, the answer is 18.

But wait, let me check.

Let me list all the possible cycles:

1. A-B-C-D-A: 6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20

2. A-B-D-C-A: 6 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 18

3. A-D-B-C-A: 5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 19

4. A-D-C-B-A: 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20

5. B-D-C-A-B: 3 + 5 + 6 + 6 = 20

6. B-D-A-C-B: 3 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 19

7. C-D-B-A-C: 4 + 3 + 6 + 5 = 18

8. C-D-A-B-C: 4 + 5 + 6 + 6 = 21

9. D-A-B-C-D: 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 20

10. D-A-C-B-D: 5 + 6 + 5 + 3 = 19

So, among all these cycles, the minimal total distance is 18, achieved by cycles 2 and 7: A-B-D-C-A and C-D-B-A-C.

Therefore, the minimal distance is 18.

Wait, so the answer is 18.

But wait, in that case, the Asymptote code's figure is a combination of the triangles, but the minimal cycle is indeed 18, which is the quadrilateral cycle.

So, my initial thought of 19 was incorrect because I didn't consider that a cycle can be a quadrilateral, not necessarily a triangle.

Therefore, the minimal cycle is 18.

But hold on, I think the answer is 18, but in the problem statement, it's asking for the shortest distance that can be travelled if you start at any point, visit the other three points once, and return to the starting point.

So, the minimal cycle is 18, which is achieved by the quadrilateral cycle.

Therefore, the answer is 18.

But wait, in my first calculation, I thought of 19, but upon further consideration, the quadrilateral cycle is 18.

So, to confirm, the minimal cycle is 18.

But let me cross-verify with the distances:

Quadrilateral A-B-D-C-A: AB=6, BD=3, DC=4, CA=5. Total=6+3+4+5=18.

Alternatively, quadrilateral C-D-B-A-C: CD=4, DB=3, BA=6, AC=5. Total=4+3+6+5=18.

So, both of these quadrilaterals have total distance 18.

Therefore, 18 is indeed the minimal cycle.

So, the answer is 18.

But wait, let me check the initial distance.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, the edges are:

- D-B:3

- D-C:4

- A-D:5

- B-C:5

- A-B:6

- A-C:6

So, the edges are as I listed earlier.

So, the distances are correct.

Therefore, the minimal cycle is 18.

So, the answer is 18.

But hold on, in the problem statement, it's mentioned that the points are labeled A, B, C, D and the distances are given. So, the answer is 18.

But to make sure, let me recount:

Quadrilateral A-B-D-C-A: AB=6, BD=3, DC=4, CA=5. So, 6+3+4+5=18.

Alternatively, quadrilateral C-D-B-A-C: CD=4, DB=3, BA=6, AC=5. 4+3+6+5=18.

So, both are 18.

Therefore, the minimal cycle is 18.

But now, I'm confused because I thought of 19, but upon further analysis, 18 is achievable.

Therefore, the answer is 18.

So, why did I have 19 earlier? Because I was considering a triangle, but the minimal cycle is a quadrilateral.

Therefore, the minimal distance is 18.

But wait, let me check another quadrilateral: A-D-C-B-A.

Wait, that's 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20.

Alternatively, starting at A, going to D, D to A, but that's a triangle.

Wait, no, that's not a quadrilateral.

So, the minimal quadrilateral cycle is 18.

Therefore, the minimal distance is 18.

But wait, to make sure, let's consider all possible cycles:

1. A-B-C-D-A: 6+5+4+5=20

2. A-B-D-C-A:6+3+4+5=18

3. A-D-B-C-A:5+3+5+6=19

4. A-D-C-B-A:5+4+5+6=20

5. B-D-C-A-B:3+5+6+6=20

6. B-D-A-C-B:3+5+5+6=19

7. C-D-B-A-C:4+3+6+5=18

8. C-D-A-B-C:4+5+6+6=21

9. D-A-B-C-D:5+6+5+4=20

10. D-A-C-B-D:5+6+5+3=19

So, among these, the minimal total is 18, achieved by cycles 2 and 7.

Therefore, the minimal cycle is 18.

Therefore, the answer is 18.

But wait, but in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with triangles, but the minimal cycle is a quadrilateral.

Therefore, the answer is 18.

But in the problem statement, it's to find the shortest distance that can be traveled if you start at any point, visit the other three points once, and return to the starting point.

So, the minimal cycle is 18.

But to cross-verify, let me think of the graph structure.

The graph is complete, with four nodes, each connected to the others with given distances.

So, the minimal cycle is 18, as found.

Therefore, the final answer is 18.

**Final Answer**
The shortest distance is \boxed{18}.
</think>

To solve the problem of finding the shortest distance that can be traveled if you start at any point, visit the other three points once, and return to the starting point, we need to consider the given distances between the points A, B, C, and D.

The distances are:
- AB = 6
- AC = 6
- AD = 5
- BC = 5
- BD = 3
- CD = 4

We need to find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle (a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex). 

After analyzing all possible cycles, we find that the minimal cycle is a quadrilateral cycle that uses the edges BD (3), DC (4), CB (5), and BA (6). This cycle has a total distance of 6 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 18.

Thus, the shortest distance that can be traveled is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\]
