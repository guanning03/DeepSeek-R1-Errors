Question:
How many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of $629_{10}$? For example, $121_{3}$ and $413_{5}$ would have one digit in common.

Correct Answer:
First, let us convert $629_{10}$ to each of the two bases. To convert to base 7, we realize $7^{4}>629_{10}>7^{3}$. So, we can tell that $629_{10}$ in base seven will have four digits. $7^{3}=343$, which can go into 629 only one time at most, leaving $629-1\cdot343 = 286$ for the next three digits. $7^{2}=49$ goes into 286 five times at most, leaving us with $286-5\cdot49 = 41$. Then, $7^{1}=7$ goes into 41 five times at most, leaving $41-5\cdot7 = 6$ for the ones digit. All together, the base seven equivalent of $629_{10}$ is $1556_{7}$.

To convert to base 8, we realize similarly that $8^{4}>629_{10}>8^{3}$. So, we can tell that $629_{10}$ in base eight will have four digits. $8^{3}=512$, which can go into 629 only one time at most, leaving $629-1\cdot512 = 117$ for the next three digits. $8^{2}=64$ goes into 117 one time at most, leaving us with $117-1\cdot64 = 53$. Then, $8^{1}=8$ goes into 53 six times at most, leaving $53-6\cdot8 = 5$ for the ones digit. All together, the base eight equivalent of $629_{10}$ is $1165_{8}$.

Finally, comparing $1556_{7}$ and $1165_{8}$, we find that digits 1, 5, and 6 are present in both numbers.  Thus, there are $\boxed{3}$ digits in common.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem: I need to figure out how many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the number 629 in base 10. The example given is that 121 in base 3 and 413 in base 5 have one digit in common. Hmm, interesting.

Let me start by recalling how to convert a base 10 number to base 7 and base 8. I think the process involves dividing the number by the base repeatedly and keeping track of the remainders. Those remainders become the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit. Yeah, that sounds right. So, I need to convert 629 from base 10 to base 7 and base 8.

First, let me tackle base 7. I'll divide 629 by 7 and note the remainder. Then I'll take the quotient and divide by 7 again, repeating this until the quotient is zero. The remainders, read in reverse order, will give me the base 7 representation.

Starting with 629 divided by 7. Let me compute that. 7 goes into 629 how many times? 7*80 is 560, right? So 7*89 is 623, which is just 6 less than 629. So the first remainder is 6. Then, take the quotient, which is 89, and divide that by 7. 7*12 is 84, so 7*12 is 84. 89 - 84 is 5. So the next remainder is 5. Now, take the quotient, which is 12, and divide that by 7. 7*1 is 7, so the remainder is 5 again. Then, take the quotient, which is 1, and divide by 7. 7 goes into 1 zero times, so the remainder is 1. Then, since the quotient is zero, we stop.

Now, reading the remainders from last to first, the base 7 representation is 1 5 5 6. So, 629 in base 7 is 1556₇.

Wait, let me check that. 1*7³ + 5*7² + 5*7 + 6. That's 1*343 + 5*49 + 5*7 + 6. 343 + 245 is 588, plus 35 is 623, plus 6 is 629. Yep, that seems correct.

Now, moving on to base 8. I'll do the same process. Divide 629 by 8, get the remainder, then take the quotient and divide by 8, and so on.

629 divided by 8. 8*70 is 560, so 629 - 560 is 69. So the first remainder is 69? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, actually, when we divide, the remainder must be less than the base. So 629 divided by 8 is 78 with a remainder. Let me compute 8*78 is 624, and 629 - 624 is 5. So the first remainder is 5. Then, the quotient is 78. Now, 78 divided by 8 is 9 with a remainder. 8*9 is 72, so the remainder is 6. Then, the quotient is 9. 9 divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 1. Then, the quotient is 1, which divided by 8 is 0 with a remainder of 1. So, the remainders are 5, 6, 1, 1.

Reading them in reverse order, the base 8 representation is 1 1 6 5. So, 629 in base 8 is 1165₈.

Let me verify that. 1*8³ + 1*8² + 6*8 + 5. 512 + 64 is 576, plus 48 is 624, plus 5 is 629. Yep, that's correct.

So now, I have 629 in base 7 as 1556 and in base 8 as 1165.

Now, the question is asking how many of the same digits are found in both representations? So, let's compare the digits digit by digit.

First, note that 1556 and 1165 are both four-digit numbers. So, the digits are:

Base 7: 1, 5, 5, 6

Base 8: 1, 1, 6, 5

So, let's align them:

Base 7: 1 | 5 | 5 | 6

Base 8: 1 | 1 | 6 | 5

Now, we need to compare each corresponding digit.

First digit: 1 in base 7 vs. 1 in base 8. That's the same digit. So that's one match.

Second digit: 5 in base 7 vs. 1 in base 8. Not the same.

Third digit: 5 in base 7 vs. 6 in base 8. Not the same.

Fourth digit: 6 in base 7 vs. 5 in base 8. Not the same.

So, only the first digit is the same. So, how many digits are in common? Just one.

Wait, hold on, the example given was about 121 in base 3 and 413 in base 5. Let me check how that worked.

121 in base 3 is 1*9 + 2*3 + 1 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16.

413 in base 5 is 4*25 + 1*5 + 3 = 100 + 5 + 3 = 108.

Then, comparing their digits: 1, 2, 1 vs. 4, 1, 3. So, the first digit 1 is same, second digit 2 vs. 1, third digit 1 vs. 3. So, only one digit in common.

Wait, so in the example, both numbers have two digits, but only one digit in common.

So, in the given problem, both numbers have four digits. In base 7, we have 1,5,5,6. In base 8, we have 1,1,6,5.

So, how many digits are the same? Let me list them:

- First digit: 1 in both, so that's one.

- Second digit: 5 vs. 1: different.

- Third digit: 5 vs. 6: different.

- Fourth digit: 6 vs. 5: different.

So, only one digit is the same. So, the answer is 1.

Wait, but hold on, let me make sure that there are no other digits that I might have missed.

Wait, the base 7 is 1556, which is four digits: 1,5,5,6.

Base 8 is 1165, which is four digits: 1,1,6,5.

So, let's write them out:

Base7: 1 (thousands place), 5 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 6 (units)

Base8: 1 (thousands), 1 (hundreds), 6 (tens), 5 (units)

So, digits:

- Thousands: 1 vs 1: same.

- Hundreds: 5 vs 1: different.

- Tens: 5 vs 6: different.

- Units: 6 vs 5: different.

So, only one digit is same. Therefore, the answer is 1.

But just to make sure, let me cross-verify my base conversions.

Base 7: 1556.

Compute 1*7^3 + 5*7^2 + 5*7 + 6.

7^3 = 343, 5*49 = 245, 5*7=35, 6. So 343 + 245 is 588, 588 + 35 is 623, 623 + 6 is 629. Correct.

Base8: 1165.

Compute 1*8^3 + 1*8^2 + 6*8 + 5.

8^3 = 512, 1*512 is 512.

8^2 = 64, 1*64 is 64.

6*8 is 48, 5. So 512 + 64 is 576, plus 48 is 624, plus 5 is 629. Correct.

So, the base 7 and base 8 representations are accurate.

Comparing each digit:

Base7: 1, 5, 5, 6

Base8: 1, 1, 6, 5

So, first digit is 1 in both. The next digits are 5 vs 1, 5 vs 6, and 6 vs 5. So, only the first digit is common.

Hence, the number of same digits is 1.

Wait, but in the example given, both numbers have two digits, and only one digit is same. So, the answer is 1.

Is that correct? It seems so.

Therefore, the number of same digits is 1.

**Final Answer**
The number of same digits is \boxed{1}.
</think>

To determine how many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7 and base 8.

**Base 7 Conversion:**
1. Divide 629 by 7: quotient 89, remainder 6.
2. Divide 89 by 7: quotient 12, remainder 5.
3. Divide 12 by 7: quotient 1, remainder 5.
4. Divide 1 by 7: quotient 0, remainder 1.

Thus, \(629_{10}\) in base 7 is \(1556_7\).

**Base 8 Conversion:**
1. Divide 629 by 8: quotient 78, remainder 5.
2. Divide 78 by 8: quotient 9, remainder 6.
3. Divide 9 by 8: quotient 1, remainder 1.
4. Divide 1 by 8: quotient 0, remainder 1.

Thus, \(629_{10}\) in base 8 is \(1165_8\).

Next, we compare the digits of \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\):

- Base 7: 1, 5, 5, 6
- Base 8: 1, 1, 6, 5

Comparing each corresponding digit:
- First digit: 1 (same)
- Second digit: 5 vs 1 (different)
- Third digit: 5 vs 6 (different)
- Fourth digit: 6 vs 5 (different)

Only the first digit is the same. Therefore, the number of same digits is \(\boxed{1}\).
