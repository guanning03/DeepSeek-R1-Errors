Question:
The Greek army contained two types of soldiers: the upper class and the lower class soldiers. If there were a total of 5 upper class soldiers, and 10 lower class soldiers in a certain part of Athens, and the battle of Thermopylae demands a force of 4 upper class soldiers and 8 lower class soldiers, how many different battalions can be sent?

Correct Answer:
There are $\binom{5}{4}$ different ways to choose 4 from 5 upper class soldiers. For each of these, there are $\binom{10}{8}$ ways to choose 8 lower class soldiers. The number of different battalions, then, is $\binom{5}{4}\cdot \binom{10}{8} = \boxed{225}$.

Gold:
225

Wrong Prediction:
32768

Wrong Answer:
To determine the number of different battalions that can be sent, I'll start by identifying the number of choices available for each class of soldiers.

First, for the upper class soldiers, there are 5 available. Since each soldier can be included or excluded from the battalion, there are 2 choices for each of the 5 soldiers.

Next, for the lower class soldiers, there are 10 available. Similarly, each soldier can be included or excluded, giving 2 choices for each of the 10 soldiers.

To find the total number of different battalions, I'll multiply the number of choices for each class. This involves calculating 2^5 for the upper class and 2^10 for the lower class, then multiplying these two results together.

Finally, by performing the multiplication, I'll obtain the total number of possible battalions that can be formed.

To determine the number of different battalions that can be sent, we'll consider the choices available for each class of soldiers and use the multiplication principle of counting.

**Step 1: Determine the number of choices for each class.**

- **Upper Class Soldiers:**
  - Total available: 5 soldiers.
  - Each soldier can either be included or excluded from the battalion.
  - **Number of choices:** \( 2^5 = 32 \)

- **Lower Class Soldiers:**
  - Total available: 10 soldiers.
  - Each soldier can either be included or excluded from the battalion.
  - **Number of choices:** \( 2^{10} = 1024 \)

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of different battalions.**

- **Total battalions:** Multiply the number of choices for each class.
  \[
  2^5 \times 2^{10} = 32 \times 1024 = 32768
  \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{32768}
\]
