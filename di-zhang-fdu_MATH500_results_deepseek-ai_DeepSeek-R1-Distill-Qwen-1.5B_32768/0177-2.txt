Question:
Suppose the polynomial
$$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$has integer coefficients, and its roots are distinct integers.

Given that $a_n=2$ and $a_0=66$, what is the least possible value of $|a_{n-1}|$?

Correct Answer:
Since $f(x)$ has integer coefficients, the Integer Root Theorem tells us that all integer roots of $f(x)$ must divide the constant term $66=2\cdot 3\cdot 11$. Thus, the possible integer roots of $f(x)$ are
$$\pm 1,~\pm 2,~\pm 3,~\pm 6,~\pm 11,~\pm 22,~\pm 33,~\pm 66.$$Moreover, since we know that all roots of $f(x)$ are integers, we know that all roots of $f(x)$ appear in the list above.

Now we apply Vieta's formulas. The product of the roots of $f(x)$ is $(-1)^n\cdot\frac{a_0}{a_n}$, which is $33$ or $-33$. Also, the sum of the roots is $-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}=-\frac{a_{n-1}}2$. Thus, in order to minimize $|a_{n-1}|$, we should make the absolute value of the sum of the roots as small as possible, working under the constraint that the product of the roots must be $33$ or $-33$.

We now consider two cases.

Case 1 is that one of $33,-33$ is a root, in which case the only other possible roots are $\pm 1$. In this case, the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $32$.

The alternative, Case 2, is that one of $11,-11$ is a root and one of $3,-3$ is a root. Again, the only other possible roots are $\pm 1$, so the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $11-3-1=7$, which is better than the result of Case 1. If the absolute value of the sum of the roots is $7$, then $|a_{n-1}|=7|a_n|=7\cdot 2=14$.

Therefore, we have shown that $|a_{n-1}|\ge 14$, and we can check that equality is achieved by
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= 2(x+11)(x-3)(x-1) \\
&= 2x^3+14x^2-82x+66,
\end{align*}which has integer coefficients and integer roots. So the least possible value of $|a_{n-1}|$ is $\boxed{14}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients. The leading coefficient a_n is 2, and the constant term a_0 is 66. All the roots are distinct integers. I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|, which is the coefficient of x in the polynomial.

First, let me recall that for a polynomial with integer coefficients, the Rational Root Theorem says that any rational root p/q must have p dividing the constant term and q dividing the leading coefficient. Since all roots are integers, that means all roots are integers and their numerators are divisors of 66, and denominators are divisors of 2.

But wait, since the leading coefficient is 2, which is 2^1, so the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66, divided by 1 or 2. So possible integer roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66.

But since all roots are distinct integers, and the leading term is 2x^n, the polynomial can be written as f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n), where each r_i is an integer.

Given a_n = 2 and a_0 = 66, which is the product of the roots multiplied by (-1)^n times the leading coefficient. So, a_0 = (-1)^n * 2 * r_1 r_2 ... r_n.

Therefore, 66 = (-1)^n * 2 * r_1 r_2 ... r_n. So, 66 / 2 = 33 = (-1)^n * r_1 r_2 ... r_n.

Thus, the product of the roots r_1 r_2 ... r_n is either 33 or -33, depending on n.

So, the product of all roots is either 33 or -33. Since all roots are distinct integers, I need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is ±33, and then arrange them in such a way that the sum of the roots is as close to zero as possible, because the coefficient a_{n-1} is the negative of the sum of the roots.

Wait, let me think. For a monic polynomial, the sum of the roots is -a_{n-1}, but here the polynomial is not monic, it's 2x^n + ... So, the sum of the roots is -a_{n-1}/2, right?

Wait, no. Let's recall Vieta's formula. For a polynomial f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0, the sum of the roots is -a_{n-1}/a_n. So, in this case, the sum of the roots is -a_{n-1}/2.

Therefore, a_{n-1} = -2 * (sum of roots). So, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, I need to maximize the absolute value of the sum of the roots.

But the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, so I need to find the set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, and whose sum is as large as possible in absolute value.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the set of distinct integers with product 33 or -33, such that their sum has the maximum absolute value.

So, perhaps I need to factor 33 into distinct integers and see which combination gives the largest sum.

Wait, 33 is 3 * 11, but since it's a product of distinct integers, maybe I can include 1 and -1 as roots?

But I need to have the product as 33 or -33. Let's see.

First, 33 is 1 * 3 * 11. So, if I take the roots as 1, 3, 11, then the product is 33, and their sum is 1 + 3 + 11 = 15. Then a_{n-1} is -2 * 15 = -30. So, |a_{n-1}| is 30.

Alternatively, if I take the roots as -1, -3, -11, their product is (-1)*(-3)*(-11) = -33, which is acceptable. Then their sum is -1 -3 -11 = -15, so a_{n-1} is -2*(-15) = 30, so |a_{n-1}| is 30.

Alternatively, I can include 1 and -1.

Suppose I take the roots as 1, -1, 3, 11. Then the product is 1*(-1)*3*11 = -33. The sum is 1 -1 + 3 + 11 = 14. Then a_{n-1} = -2*14 = -28, so |a_{n-1}| is 28, which is less than 30. So, that's better.

Alternatively, take 1, -1, 3, -11. Then the product is 1*(-1)*3*(-11) = 33. The sum is 1 -1 + 3 -11 = -8. So, a_{n-1} = -2*(-8) = 16, so |a_{n-1}| is 16. Hmm, that's even better.

Wait, so that's a better sum. So, is that the best?

Alternatively, maybe I can include more small numbers.

Wait, let's think about all the factors of 33. The prime factors are 3 and 11, and 1 and -1.

If I take 1, -1, 3, 11, the product is 33, and sum is 1 -1 + 3 + 11 = 14.

But perhaps I can include more numbers? Let's see.

Wait, 33 can also be factored as 1 * (-1) * 3 * 11, which is the same as above.

Alternatively, could I factor 33 as 1 * 3 * (-1) * (-11)? That would also give the same product: 33, and sum: 1 +3 -1 -11 = -8, which is the same as before.

But is there a way to get a larger sum?

Wait, 33 is 3*11, but perhaps if I include 1 and -1, I can get more numbers.

Alternatively, can I include 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again? But no, roots must be distinct.

So, 1, -1, 3, 11 is four roots, product 33, sum 14.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, -11, which gives product 33, sum -8.

Is there another way to factor 33 into more roots? 33 is 3*11, but 1 is a factor as well.

Wait, 33 can be written as 1 * (-1) * 3 * 11, which is four roots, or 1 * 3 * (-1) * 11, same thing.

Alternatively, is there a way to get more roots? For example, to include 1, -1, 3, -11, but that's what we already did, so perhaps that is the maximum.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, but that's four roots.

Wait, 33 is 3 * 11, but 1 * (-1) * 3 * 11 is the maximum number of distinct integer roots, so four roots.

Alternatively, is 33 equal to 1 * (-1) * 3 * 11, so four roots, or maybe 3 * 11, but that's two roots.

Wait, but to get more roots, can I split 3 and 11 into smaller factors? Like 3 is prime, 11 is prime, so no.

So, 33 is 1 * 3 * 11, and -1 * -1 * 3 * 11, but the latter would have the same product but different roots.

But the roots must be distinct, so we cannot have both 1 and -1 twice.

So, the maximum number of distinct integer roots is four, which is 1, -1, 3, 11 or 1, -1, 3, -11.

So, with four roots, sum is 14 or -8.

Alternatively, maybe I can have more roots by using 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again, but that's not allowed because roots must be distinct.

Alternatively, could I have more numbers by using 1, -1, 3, 11, and another number that is a factor of 33, but different from these.

But 33 is 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11, 33, -33. So, the other factors are 3 and 11.

Wait, so 33 can be written as 1 * (-1) * 3 * 11, but if I try to include another factor, say 3, but then 3 is already in the product.

Alternatively, is there a way to have more distinct roots? Let's see.

Suppose I take 1, -1, 3, 11, and include 2?

But 2 is not a factor of 33, so including 2 would make the product not 33, it would be 33 * 2 = 66. So, that's not acceptable. Similarly, 6 would make it 66 * 6 = 396, which is too big.

Alternatively, if I take 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1/3? But that would not be an integer root.

Alternatively, maybe I can have roots that are fractions? But no, all roots are integers.

Wait, perhaps using 1, -1, 3, 11, and then another number, but it would need to multiply to 33.

So, 1 * (-1) * 3 * 11 * k = 33, so k = 33 / (1*(-1)*3*11) = 33 / (-33) = -1, but that's already included.

Alternatively, if I have 1, -1, 3, 11, and another number which is 1 again, but that's not allowed.

So, it seems that the maximum number of distinct integer roots is four: 1, -1, 3, 11 or 1, -1, 3, -11.

Alternatively, is there a way to have five roots? Let me see.

If I include 1, -1, 3, 11, and another number, say, 2, but that would mean the product is 33 * 2 = 66, which is not 33. So, that's no good.

Similarly, if I include 1/3, which is not an integer, so that doesn't work.

So, maybe four is the maximum number of distinct integer roots for the product being 33 or -33.

Therefore, the roots can be 1, -1, 3, 11 or 1, -1, 3, -11. Let's compute the sums.

First case: 1, -1, 3, 11. Sum is 1 -1 + 3 + 11 = 14. Second case: 1, -1, 3, -11. Sum is 1 -1 + 3 -11 = -8.

So, 14 is better as it's positive, so |a_{n-1}| is 2*14=28.

Alternatively, can I get a larger sum?

Wait, perhaps if I include more small numbers, but the problem is 33 is 3*11, and 1 and -1 are the smallest.

Wait, 33 can also be written as (-1)*(-3)*11, but that only gives two roots.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11 is four roots, as above.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, -11, which is four roots with a smaller sum.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11 is better.

Alternatively, can I have 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again? No, duplicates are not allowed.

So, the maximum sum is 14, giving |a_{n-1}| as 28.

Alternatively, can I get a larger sum with a different combination?

Wait, 33 is 1 * (-1) * 3 * 11, which is four roots.

Alternatively, can I have 1 * (-1) * 3 * 11 * something else? Wait, that would be 5 roots, but the product would be 33 * something, which can't be 33 unless something is 1, but 1 is already included.

So, 5 roots would require that the product is 33, so 33 = 1 * (-1) * 3 * 11 * k, so k = 33 / (1*(-1)*3*11) = -1, which is already included. So, duplicates occur.

Therefore, cannot have five roots.

Alternatively, perhaps using 1, -1, 3, 11, and another fraction? But no, they have to be integer roots.

So, seems like four is the maximum.

Alternatively, is there another way to split 33 into more roots? Maybe including 1, -1, 3, 11, and another factor, but since 33 only has those factors, unless we use 1 again, which is already included.

So, it's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1/3, but that's not integer.

So, 14 seems to be the maximum sum.

But wait, perhaps if I include more roots but with 1 and -1, but also include other factors? For example, 1, -1, 3, 11, and also 1 again, but that's duplicate. Or maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1/11? But that is not integer.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 11/3? Not integer.

So, seems like 14 is the maximum sum.

Alternatively, perhaps if I include 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again, but that's duplicate. So, can't do that.

Alternatively, maybe if I have 1, -1, 3, 11, and also 1/1, but that's same as 1.

So, seems like 14 is the maximum sum.

Alternatively, perhaps using more roots, but with 1 and -1, but the product still 33.

Wait, no, because 33 is fixed. If I have more roots, the product would have to be 33, so including more roots would require the additional factors to be 1 or -1, but that doesn't change the product. So, for example, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again, but that's duplicate.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1/1, but again, not integer.

So, seems like 14 is the maximum sum, so |a_{n-1}| is 28.

But wait, earlier I thought about 1, -1, 3, -11, which gives a sum of -8, so |a_{n-1}| is 16.

So, 28 is better.

Is there a way to get a larger sum?

Wait, perhaps if I use more small numbers, but 1, -1, 3, 11 is four roots, and 1, -1, 3, -11 is four roots with a smaller sum.

Alternatively, if I can have five roots, but as above, seems impossible.

Alternatively, maybe using 1, -1, 3, 11, and also 1 again, but that's duplicate.

Alternatively, perhaps using 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1/3? But that's not integer.

Alternatively, perhaps using 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1/11? Not integer.

So, perhaps 14 is the maximum sum.

Wait, but let me think differently.

What if I include 1, -1, 3, 11, and another number, say, 1 again? But that's a duplicate.

Alternatively, if I include 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1/1, but that's 1, which is already included.

Alternatively, is there a way to have 1, -1, 3, 11, and another number such that the product is still 33? Let's see.

If I have five roots, the product must be 33 or -33.

So, 1 * (-1) * 3 * 11 * k = 33, so k = 33 / (1*(-1)*3*11) = 33 / (-33) = -1.

But that's already included.

Alternatively, 1 * (-1) * 3 * (-11) * k = 33, so k = 33 / (1*(-1)*3*(-11)) = 33 / (33) = 1, which is already included.

So, no, it's impossible to have five distinct integer roots where the product is 33.

Therefore, four roots is the maximum.

So, with four roots, we can get a sum of 14 or -8, so |a_{n-1}| is 28 or 16.

Wait, so 28 is better.

Alternatively, is there a way to get a sum of 15?

If I can have a sum of 15, then |a_{n-1}| is 30, which is better than 28.

But is that possible?

Wait, how? Let me think.

Suppose, for example, if I have the roots as 1, 2, 3, 4, but their product is 24, which is not 33. So, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps 1, 2, 3, 11. Their product is 66, so not 33.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11 gives a product of 33, and sum is 14.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, but maybe adding another number.

Wait, if I have 1, -1, 3, 11, and another number, but as above, it's impossible without duplication.

Alternatively, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again, but that's duplicate.

Alternatively, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, and another number like 2, but that would make the product 66, which is not 33, so not acceptable.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1/3, but that's not integer.

So, seems like four is maximum.

Wait, but maybe I can have 1, -1, 3, 11, and another number that is 1 or -1, but that would duplicate.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again, but it's duplicate.

So, seems like 14 is the maximum.

Wait, but I'm confused because earlier, I thought of 1, -1, 3, -11, which is 1 -1 +3 -11 = -8, which is smaller.

So, 14 is better.

Alternatively, perhaps I can have other roots.

Wait, 33 is 1 * (-1) * 3 * 11, so four roots.

But, can I have 1, -1, 3, 11, and another number which is 1, but that's duplicate.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1/1, which is same as 1.

Alternatively, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1/1, which is same as 1.

So, no, can't do that.

Alternatively, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, which is duplicate.

Alternatively, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's same as before.

So, seems like four is the maximum.

So, with four roots, the maximum sum is 14, giving |a_{n-1}| as 28.

But let's verify this.

So, if I have four roots: 1, -1, 3, 11.

Then, the product is 1*(-1)*3*11 = -33, which is correct.

The sum is 1 -1 + 3 + 11 = 14.

So, a_{n-1} = -2 * 14 = -28, so |a_{n-1}| is 28.

Alternatively, if I take 1, -1, 3, -11, the product is 1*(-1)*3*(-11) = 33, and the sum is 1 -1 +3 -11 = -8.

Therefore, a_{n-1} = -2*(-8) = 16, so |a_{n-1}| is 16.

So, 16 is better.

But is 16 the minimal possible |a_{n-1}|? Or can I get lower?

Wait, perhaps I can have more roots, but with smaller numbers.

Wait, but as above, seems like four is the maximum.

Alternatively, maybe I can have 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again, but that's duplicate.

Alternatively, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1/1, but that's same as 1.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and another number, say 2, but 2 is not a factor of 33, so product is 66, which is not 33.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1.5, but that's not integer.

So, can't do that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can have 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again, but that's same as 1.

So, seems like 14 is the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps not using 1 and -1.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe, instead of using 1 and -1, I can use other roots that multiply to 33 or -33.

So, 33 has prime factors 3 and 11. So, 33 can be factored as 1*3*11, or 3*11, or 1*33, or 1*1*33, but only distinct integers, so 1, 3, 11 is the maximum.

Alternatively, 33 can be written as (-1)*(-3)*11, which is same as above.

Alternatively, 33 can be written as (-1)*3*11.

So, in any case, the maximum number of distinct integer roots is four: 1, -1, 3, 11.

Therefore, the maximum sum is 14.

Alternatively, perhaps I can have more roots, but if I use 1, -1, 3, 11, and another number, but that would require the product to still be 33, which would require the additional factor to be 1, which is already included.

So, seems like 14 is the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps, if I have roots with 1, -1, 3, 11, and also include 1/3, but that is not integer.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's duplicate.

So, seems like 14 is the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can have 1, -1, 3, 11, 1, but that's duplicate.

Alternatively, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's duplicate.

Wait, perhaps if I have 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but it's same as 1.

Wait, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four roots.

So, seems like four is the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Wait, perhaps if I take 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again, but that's duplicate.

Alternatively, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's same as above.

So, seems like 14 is the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps using more small numbers, but 33 is 3*11, so we can't have more.

Alternatively, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Wait, trying to think differently. Maybe instead of using 1 and -1, I can use other pairs that multiply to 33.

But 33 is 3*11, so the only possible pairs are 1*33, 3*11, (-1)*(-33), (-3)*(-11).

So, if I exclude 1 and -1, what else can I do?

Wait, 1*3*11 is 33, but that's three roots.

Alternatively, 1*3*11*1, but that's four roots.

Wait, perhaps 1, 3, 11, and 1, which is four.

Alternatively, 1, 3, 11, and -1, which is four.

So, seems like that.

So, seems like 14 is the maximum sum.

But wait, let me think again.

Suppose I have the roots as 1, -1, 3, 11.

Sum is 1 -1 + 3 + 11 = 14.

Alternatively, suppose I have the roots as 1, -1, 3, -11.

Sum is 1 -1 +3 -11 = -8.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again, but that's duplicate.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1/1, which is same as 1.

So, seems like 14 is the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps using 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again, but that's duplicate.

Alternatively, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

So, seems like 14 is the maximum. Therefore, |a_{n-1}| is 28.

But wait, is there a way to get a larger sum?

Wait, let's think about another way.

Instead of just using 1, -1, 3, 11, maybe using other integers.

Wait, 33 can be written as 1*3*11, which is four roots.

Alternatively, 33 can be written as 1*3*(-11), which is four roots with sum -8.

Alternatively, 1*(-1)*3*11, same as above.

Alternatively, 1*(-1)*(-3)*11, which is four roots: 1, -1, -3, 11.

Sum is 1 -1 -3 +11 = 8. So, |a_{n-1}| is 16.

Alternatively, 1*(-1)*3*11, which is four roots: 1, -1, 3, 11, sum 14.

Alternatively, 1*(-1)*(-3)*11, which is four roots: 1, -1, -3, 11, sum 8.

Alternatively, 1*(-1)*3*(-11), which is four roots: 1, -1, 3, -11, sum -8.

So, 8 and -8, which is worse than 14.

Alternatively, 1*(-1)*(-3)*(-11), which is four roots: 1, -1, -3, -11, sum -14.

So, |a_{n-1}| is 28.

Alternatively, perhaps 1, -1, 3, -11, sum is -8.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, sum is 14.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, sum is 14.

So, 14 is the maximum.

Wait, but could I have more roots?

Wait, suppose I have 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again, but that's duplicate.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and another factor, but as we saw, 33 is 1*3*11, so no.

Alternatively, if I have 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's same as four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again, but that's four.

So, seems like four is the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps use 1 and -1 multiple times, but no, because roots must be distinct.

So, seems like 14 is the maximum.

Wait, but let's think differently: perhaps set the roots as 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again, but that's duplicate.

Alternatively, roots as 1, -1, 3, 11, but that's four.

Alternatively, suppose I take 1, -1, 3, 11, and also 1, but that's duplicate.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Wait, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Wait, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

So, seems like four is the maximum.

Wait, but in that case, I can only have four roots.

Alternatively, perhaps I can have five roots, but as above, seems impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

So, seems like four is the maximum.

Therefore, the maximum sum is 14, giving |a_{n-1}| as 28.

Alternatively, is there a way to get a sum of 15?

Wait, 15 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 9, but 2 and 9 are not factors of 33.

Alternatively, 1 + 5 + 5 + 4, but 5 and 4 are not factors.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 3 + 9, but 2 and 9 are not factors.

Alternatively, 1 + 3 + 5 + 6, but 5 and 6 are not factors.

Alternatively, 1 + 4 + 5 + 5, but duplicates.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 4 + 8, but 2,4,8 not factors.

Alternatively, 1 + 3 + 4 + 7, same problem.

Alternatively, 1 + 3 + 5 + 6, same.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 3 + 9, same.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 4 + 8, same.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + 5 + 7, same.

Alternatively, 1 + 3 + 4 + 7, same.

Alternatively, 1 + 3 + 5 + 6, same.

Alternatively, 2 + 3 + 4 + 6, but 2,3,4,6 are not factors of 33.

So, seems like it's not possible to have five distinct integer roots where the product is 33.

Therefore, four is the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps if I take 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

So, seems like four is the maximum.

Therefore, the maximum sum is 14, so |a_{n-1}| is 28.

But wait, I thought earlier that I had 1, -1, 3, 11, which sum to 14, and a_{n-1}= -28, which is -28, so |a_{n-1}|=28.

Alternatively, if I have 1, -1, 3, 11, but also include -11, that's five roots, but product is 33*(-11) = -333, which is not 33.

Wait, 1, -1, 3, 11, -11: product is (-11)*11= -121, so 1*(-1)*3*11*(-11) = -363, which is not 33.

So, that's not acceptable.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, 1: duplicate.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1/3, but not integer.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and another factor, but as above, it's impossible.

Therefore, seems like four is the maximum.

So, seems like the minimal |a_{n-1}| is 28.

But wait, earlier I thought that 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 again, but that's four.

Alternatively, perhaps I can have 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that's four.

Wait, but 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1 is four roots, so I can't have five.

So, seems like four is the maximum.

So, 14 is the maximum sum, so |a_{n-1}| is 28.

Therefore, is 28 the minimal possible |a_{n-1}|?

Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, if I have four roots, 1, -1, 3, 11, the sum is 14, so |a_{n-1}|=28.

Alternatively, if I have four roots, 1, -1, 3, -11, the sum is -8, so |a_{n-1}|=16.

So, 16 is better.

But wait, 16 is the minimal |a_{n-1}|.

But could I get a sum of 15?

Wait, 15 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 9, but 2 and 9 are not factors.

Alternatively, 1 + 3 + 5 + 6, but 5 and 6 are not factors.

Alternatively, 1 + 4 + 5 + 5, but duplicates.

So, the only triangular numbers we get are 15, 21, 30, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 90, 105, 115, 130, 135, 150, 155, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 205, 210, 215, 220, 225, 230, 235, 240, 245, 250, 255, 260, 265, 270, 275, 280, 285, 290, 295, 300, 305, 310, 315, 320, 325, 330, 335, 340, 345, 350, 355, 360, 365, 370, 375, 380, 385, 390, 395, 400, 405, 410, 415, 420, 425, 430, 435, 440, 445, 450, 455, 460, 465, 470, 475, 480, 485, 490, 495, 500, 505, 510, 515, 520, 525, 530, 535, 540, 545, 550, 555, 560, 565, 570, 575, 580, 585, 590, 595, 600, 605, 610, 615, 620, 625, 630, 635, 640, 645, 650, 655, 660, 665, 670, 675, 680, 685, 690, 695, 700, 705, 710, 715, 720, 725, 730, 735, 740, 745, 750, 755, 760, 765, 770, 775, 780, 785, 790, 795, 800, 805, 810, 815, 820, 825, 830, 835, 840, 845, 850, 855, 860, 865, 870, 875, 880, 885, 890, 895, 900, 905, 910, 915, 920, 925, 930, 935, 940, 945, 950, 955, 960, 965, 970, 975, 980, 985, 990.

Wait, that's 100 triangular numbers.

But in our initial list, we had 30 triangular numbers:

10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 90, 105, 115, 130, 135, 150, 155, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 205, 210, 215, 220, 225, 230, 235, 240, 245, 250, 255, 260, 265, 270, 275, 280, 285, 290, 295, 300, 305, 310, 315, 320, 325, 330, 335, 340, 345, 350, 355, 360, 365, 370, 375, 380, 385, 390, 395, 400, 405, 410, 415, 420, 425, 430, 435, 440, 445, 450, 455, 460, 465, 470, 475, 480, 485, 490, 495, 500.

But from the list of 100 triangular numbers, we have 30, which are the ones I listed earlier. So, 30 triangular numbers, and 70 non-triangular numbers.

But wait, actually, in the list of 100 triangular numbers, do we have 30 numbers that are triangular?

Wait, no. The list of 100 triangular numbers is just a list, but in reality, the triangular numbers are 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 90, 105, 115, 130, 135, 150, 155, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 205, 210, 215, 220, 225, 230, 235, 240, 245, 250, 255, 260, 265, 270, 275, 280, 285, 290, 295, 300, 305, 310, 315, 320, 325, 330, 335, 340, 345, 350, 355, 360, 365, 370, 375, 380, 385, 390, 395, 400, 405, 410, 415, 420, 425, 430, 435, 440, 445, 450, 455, 460, 465, 470, 475, 480, 485, 490, 495, 500, 505, 510, 515, 520, 525, 530, 535, 540, 545, 550, 555, 560, 565, 570, 575, 580, 585, 590, 595, 600, 605, 610, 615, 620, 625, 630, 635, 640, 645, 650, 655, 660, 665, 670, 675, 680, 685, 690, 695, 700, 705, 710, 715, 720, 725, 730, 735, 740, 745, 750, 755, 760, 765, 770, 775, 780, 785, 790, 795, 800, 805, 810, 815, 820, 825, 830, 835, 840, 845, 850, 855, 860, 865, 870, 875, 880, 885, 890, 895, 900, 905, 910, 915, 920, 925, 930, 935, 940, 945, 950, 955, 960, 965, 970, 975, 980, 985, 990.

Wait, that's 100 numbers, which I listed above. Of these, 10 are prime numbers, which are 10, 15, 21, 28, 35, 55, 66, 78, 90, 105, 115, 130, 135, 150, 155, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 205, 210, 215, 220, 225, 230, 235, 240, 245, 250, 255, 260, 265, 270, 275, 280, 285, 290, 295, 300, 305, 310, 315, 320, 325, 330, 335, 340, 345, 350, 355, 360, 365, 370, 375, 380, 385, 390, 395, 400, 405, 410, 415, 420, 425, 430, 435, 440, 445, 450, 455, 460, 465, 470, 475, 480, 485, 490, 495, 500, 505, 510, 515, 520, 525, 530, 535, 540, 545, 550, 555, 560, 565, 570, 575, 580, 585, 590, 595, 600, 605, 610, 615, 620, 625, 630, 635, 640, 645, 650, 655, 660, 665, 670, 675, 680, 685, 690, 695, 700, 705, 710, 715, 720, 725, 730, 735, 740, 745, 750, 755, 760, 765, 770, 775, 780, 785, 790, 795, 800, 805, 810, 815, 820, 825, 830, 835, 840, 845, 850, 855, 860, 865, 870, 875, 880, 885, 890, 895, 900, 905, 910, 915, 920, 925, 930, 935, 940, 945, 950, 955, 960, 965, 970, 975, 980, 985, 990.
