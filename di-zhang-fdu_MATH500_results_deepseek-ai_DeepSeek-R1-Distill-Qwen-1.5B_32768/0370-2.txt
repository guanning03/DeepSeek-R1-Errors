Question:
Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 5 such that
\[p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1}\]for $n = 2,$ 3, 4, $\dots,$ 7.  Find $p(8).$

Correct Answer:
Let $q(x) = (x^2 - 1) p(x) - x.$  Then $q(x)$ has degree 7, and $q(n) = 0$ for $n = 2$, 3, 4, $\dots,$ 7, so
\[q(x) = (ax + b)(x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7)\]for some constants $a$ and $b.$

We know that $q(1) = (1^2 - 1)p(1) - 1 = -1.$  Setting $x = 1$ in the equation above, we get
\[q(1) = 720(a + b),\]so $a + b = -\frac{1}{720}.$

We also know that $q(-1) = ((-1)^2 - 1)p(-1) + 1 = 1.$  Setting $x = -1$ in the equation above, we get
\[q(-1) = 20160(-a + b),\]so $-a + b = \frac{1}{20160}.$  Solving for $a$ and $b,$ we find $a = -\frac{29}{40320}$ and $b = -\frac{3}{4480}.$  Hence,
\begin{align*}
q(x) &= \left( -\frac{29}{40320} x - \frac{3}{4480} \right) (x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7) \\
&= -\frac{(29x + 27)(x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7)}{40320}.
\end{align*}In particular,
\[q(8) = -\frac{(29 \cdot 8 + 27)(6)(5) \dotsm (1)}{40320} = -\frac{37}{8},\]so
\[p(8) = \frac{q(8) + 8}{8^2 - 1} = \boxed{\frac{3}{56}}.\]

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find p(8), where p(x) is a polynomial of degree 5. The catch is that p(n) equals n divided by (n squared minus 1) for n = 2, 3, 4, all the way up to 7. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that a polynomial of degree 5 is determined uniquely by its behavior at 6 distinct points. Here, p(n) is given for n = 2 through 7, which is 6 points. So that seems perfect. If I can construct a polynomial that passes through all these points, I can then use it to find p(8).

But wait, p(x) is a degree 5 polynomial, and if I have 6 points, that should uniquely define it, right? So maybe I can use interpolation here. But interpolation with a degree 5 polynomial might be tedious. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this problem without having to find the entire polynomial.

Let me think about the form of p(x). The expression n/(n² - 1) can be simplified. Let's see, n/(n² - 1) is equal to 1/(n - 1) + 1/(n + 1). Wait, let me check that:

1/(n - 1) + 1/(n + 1) = [ (n + 1) + (n - 1) ] / (n² - 1) = (2n) / (n² - 1). Hmm, that's not quite n/(n² - 1). So that doesn't work. Maybe another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can express n/(n² - 1) as a quadratic over a linear? Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as a combination of partial fractions. Let's try that.

Wait, n/(n² - 1) can be written as (A)/(n - 1) + (B)/(n + 1). Let's solve for A and B.

So, n = A(n + 1) + B(n - 1). Let's expand:

n = A n + A + B n - B.

Gather like terms:

n = (A + B)n + (A - B).

Therefore, we can set up the equations:

A + B = 1 (coefficient of n on both sides)
A - B = 0 (constant term)

So, from the second equation, A = B. Plugging into the first equation: A + A = 1 => 2A = 1 => A = 1/2. Therefore, B = 1/2 as well.

So, n/(n² - 1) = (1/2)/(n - 1) + (1/2)/(n + 1). That's good! So, p(n) = 1/(2(n - 1)) + 1/(2(n + 1)).

Wait, so p(n) is equal to the average of 1/(n - 1) and 1/(n + 1). That might be useful. So, p(n) is kind of an average of these two functions. Hmm, interesting.

But how does that help me? Maybe if I can think about another polynomial that relates to this. Let me consider the function q(n) = (n² - 1)p(n) - n. Then, for n = 2, 3, 4, ..., 7, q(n) = 0. Because p(n) = n/(n² - 1), so (n² - 1)p(n) = n. Therefore, q(n) = 0 for n = 2, 3, 4, ..., 7.

So q(n) is a polynomial that has roots at n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. That means q(n) is divisible by (n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)(n - 6)(n - 7). Let me confirm the degree. q(n) is equal to (n² - 1)p(n) - n, which is a degree 5 polynomial times degree 2, so degree 7, minus n, so the degree is still 7. So, q(n) is a degree 7 polynomial with roots at n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

Therefore, q(n) can be written as c(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)(n - 6)(n - 7), where c is a constant coefficient.

So, we have q(n) = c(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)(n - 6)(n - 7). Now, to find the constant c, we can plug in another value of n where we know q(n). But wait, in our initial setup, we only know q(n) at n = 2 through 7. So, we need another value. But since p(x) is a degree 5 polynomial, and q(n) is constructed as (n² - 1)p(n) - n, which is a degree 7 polynomial, we can use a value of n outside of 2-7 to find c.

Let me choose n = 1 or n = 0 or n = -1, but let's see: n = 1 would give q(1) = (1 - 2)(1 - 3)(1 - 4)(1 - 5)(1 - 6)(1 - 7) * c. That would be (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6) * c. Let me compute that:

(-1)(-2) = 2

2*(-3) = -6

-6*(-4) = 24

24*(-5) = -120

-120*(-6) = 720

So, 720 * c. But what is q(1)? Since q(n) = (n² - 1)p(n) - n, so when n = 1, q(1) = (1 - 1)p(1) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1. Therefore:

720c = -1 => c = -1 / 720.

So, q(n) = (-1/720)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)(n - 6)(n - 7).

Now, our goal is to find p(8). Let's recall that p(n) = [n + (n² -1)q(n)] / (n² - 1). Wait, no. Wait, actually, let's go back.

Wait, q(n) = (n² - 1)p(n) - n. So, rearranged, we have:

(n² - 1)p(n) = q(n) + n.

Therefore, p(n) = [q(n) + n] / (n² - 1).

So, for n = 8, p(8) = [q(8) + 8] / (8² - 1) = [q(8) + 8] / 63.

Therefore, I need to compute q(8). But q(n) is given by c(n - 2)(n - 3)...(n - 7). So, q(8) = (-1/720)(8 - 2)(8 - 3)(8 - 4)(8 - 5)(8 - 6)(8 - 7).

Compute each term:

(8 - 2) = 6

(8 - 3) = 5

(8 - 4) = 4

(8 - 5) = 3

(8 - 6) = 2

(8 - 7) = 1

So, q(8) = (-1/720)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) = (-1/720)(720) = -1.

Therefore, p(8) = [ -1 + 8 ] / 63 = (7)/63 = 1/9.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, q(8) = (-1/720)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) = (-1/720)(720) = -1. So, then p(8) = (-1 + 8)/63 = 7/63 = 1/9.

So, p(8) is 1/9. Is that correct? Let me check my steps.

First, I defined q(n) = (n² -1)p(n) - n, which is a degree 7 polynomial with roots at 2 through 7, so q(n) = c(n - 2)...(n -7).

Computed q(1) as -1, which led to c = -1/720. Then, q(8) was computed as (-1/720)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) = -1. Therefore, p(8) = (-1 + 8)/63 = 7/63 = 1/9.

Seems consistent. Maybe I can verify using another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using polynomial interpolation. Let me think about the structure of p(x). Since p(x) is a degree 5 polynomial, and we know its value at 6 points, we can set up a system of equations. But that would be a lot of work. Alternatively, maybe using the concept of Lagrange interpolation.

The Lagrange interpolation formula for p(x) is:

p(x) = sum_{k=2}^7 [ y_k * L_k(x) ]

where L_k(x) is the Lagrange basis polynomial, which satisfies L_k(n) = 1 if k = n and 0 otherwise.

But that would involve computing 6 basis polynomials each of degree 5, which is a lot. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, since we have q(n) = (n² - 1)p(n) - n, which is a degree 7 polynomial, and we found q(n) = c(n - 2)...(n -7). So, we can write p(n) = [q(n) + n]/(n² -1). Therefore, p(8) = [q(8) + 8]/(64 -1) = [q(8) +8]/63. Since q(8) = -1, this gives 7/63 = 1/9. So that seems consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps thinking about the function f(n) = n/(n² -1). We can write f(n) = 1/(2(n -1)) + 1/(2(n +1)). So, it's a sum of two simple rational functions.

Therefore, p(n) is equal to this sum, but p(n) is a polynomial. Hmm, so how can a polynomial equal a sum of two rational functions? Because at integer points, p(n) is equal to that sum. So, p(x) interpolates f(x) at x = 2,3,4,5,6,7.

But wait, f(x) = n/(n² -1) is a rational function, and p(x) is a polynomial. So, p(x) is the polynomial that agrees with f(x) at those integer points. So, for each integer x in 2 through 7, p(x) equals f(x). So, p(x) is the unique degree 5 polynomial that interpolates f(x) at those points.

So, another way to think about this is that p(x) is the interpolating polynomial of degree 5 that goes through those points. So, in that case, I can use the method of finite differences or some form of interpolation.

But maybe there's another trick here. Since p(x) is a polynomial that equals f(x) at those points, perhaps I can write a system of equations based on the values of p(x) at x=2 through x=7, but since p(x) is degree 5, it's a system of 6 equations with 6 unknowns.

But that seems tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can write p(x) in terms of the Lagrange basis polynomials.

Wait, actually, since p(x) is a degree 5 polynomial, and we have 6 points, we can express p(x) as p(x) = sum_{k=2}^7 y_k * L_k(x), where L_k(x) is the Lagrange basis polynomial.

But given that, maybe I can write p(x) = sum_{k=2}^7 [ y_k * L_k(x) ].

But without knowing the y_k values, which are p(2), p(3), ..., p(7), which are equal to 2/(4 -1) = 2/3, 3/8, 4/15, 5/24, 6/35, 7/48.

Wait, let me compute those:

p(2) = 2/(4 -1) = 2/3
p(3) = 3/(9 -1) = 3/8
p(4) = 4/(16 -1) = 4/15
p(5) = 5/(25 -1) = 5/24
p(6) = 6/(36 -1) = 6/35
p(7) = 7/(49 -1) = 7/48

So, p(2) = 2/3, p(3)=3/8, p(4)=4/15, p(5)=5/24, p(6)=6/35, p(7)=7/48.

So, if I can write p(x) as a combination of Lagrange basis polynomials, then evaluate at x=8.

Alternatively, let me think about another approach. Since p(x) is a degree 5 polynomial, and q(n) = (n² -1)p(n) - n, which is a degree 7 polynomial, with roots at n=2,3,4,5,6,7, we can write q(n) as c(n -2)(n -3)...(n -7).

Earlier, I found c = -1/720.

So, q(n) = (-1/720)(n -2)(n -3)...(n -7).

Therefore, p(n) = [q(n) + n]/(n² -1) = [ (-1/720)(n -2)...(n -7) + n ] / (n² -1).

Therefore, p(8) = [ (-1/720)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) + 8 ] / (64 -1) = [ -1 + 8 ] / 63 = 7/63 = 1/9.

So, this seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the difference between p(x) and another function. Let me define f(x) = n/(n² -1). Then, p(n) = f(n) for n=2,3,4,5,6,7. So, p(x) interpolates f(x) at those points.

But since f(x) is a rational function, and p(x) is a polynomial, perhaps p(x) is the unique degree 5 polynomial that interpolates f(x) at these integer points.

But I don't know if that helps me compute p(8). Maybe another way is to consider the structure of the problem.

Wait, the function f(x) = n/(n² -1) can be written as (1/(2(n -1)) + 1/(2(n +1))), as I did earlier. So, f(n) = [1/(2(n -1)) + 1/(2(n +1))].

So, p(n) = [1/(2(n -1)) + 1/(2(n +1))]. So, p(n) is the average of 1/(n-1) and 1/(n+1). So, if I can write p(n) as such, maybe I can relate it to some telescoping series or something.

But how does that help me find p(8)? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps considering the function r(n) = 1/(n -1). Then, p(n) = (r(n) + r(n +2))/2.

But p(x) is a polynomial, so perhaps r(n) is a polynomial? But r(n) is 1/(n -1), which is not a polynomial. So, that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe considering that p(x) is equal to the average of two terms involving 1/(x -1) and 1/(x +1). So, p(x) = [1/(2(x -1)) + 1/(2(x +1))]. But this is a rational function, not a polynomial. So, perhaps this approach is not useful.

Alternatively, maybe considering that p(x) is equal to [ (x +1) + (x -1) ] / [2(x² -1)] = (2x)/[2(x² -1)] = x/(x² -1). Wait, that's just f(x). So, p(x) is actually equal to f(x). But that can't be, because p(x) is a degree 5 polynomial, while f(x) is a rational function. So, that seems conflicting.

Wait, no, hold on. If p(x) is equal to f(x) at x=2,3,4,5,6,7, but f(x) is not a polynomial. So, that suggests that p(x) is a polynomial that agrees with f(x) at those points, but f(x) is not a polynomial.

So, in that case, p(x) is the unique interpolating polynomial of degree 5 that goes through those 6 points. So, we can use the method of finite differences or Lagrange interpolation to find p(x), but that might be time-consuming.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the method of undetermined coefficients. Let me try to write p(x) as a general polynomial of degree 5 and set up equations.

Let p(x) = ax⁵ + bx⁴ + cx³ + dx² + ex + f.

Then, for x = 2,3,4,5,6,7, we have p(x) = x/(x² -1). So, let's write equations:

For x=2: 32a + 16b + 8c + 4d + 2e + f = 2/(4 -1) = 2/3.

Similarly, for x=3: 243a + 81b + 27c + 9d + 3e + f = 3/8.

For x=4: 1024a + 256b + 64c + 16d + 4e + f = 4/15.

For x=5: 3125a + 625b + 125c + 25d + 5e + f = 5/24.

For x=6: 7776a + 1296b + 216c + 36d + 6e + f = 6/35.

For x=7: 16807a + 2401b + 343c + 49d + 7e + f = 7/48.

So, we have a system of 6 equations with 6 unknowns (a, b, c, d, e, f). Solving this system would give us the coefficients of p(x), and then we can compute p(8).

But solving a system of 6 equations by hand is quite tedious. Maybe I can use some clever methods or notice a pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that p(x) is a degree 5 polynomial, so it's uniquely determined by 6 points. So, perhaps I can use the method of finite differences or something.

But perhaps another approach is to note that p(x) satisfies p(n) = n/(n² -1) for n=2 through 7. Therefore, p(n) - n/(n² -1) = 0 for n=2 through 7.

So, that is, p(n) - [1/(2(n -1)) + 1/(2(n +1))] = 0 for n=2 through 7.

Therefore, p(n) - [1/(2(n -1)) + 1/(2(n +1))] is a polynomial that has roots at n=2 through 7. Thus, it's divisible by (n -2)(n -3)...(n -7). So, p(n) - [1/(2(n -1)) + 1/(2(n +1))] = k(n -2)(n -3)...(n -7) for some constant k.

Therefore, p(n) = k(n -2)(n -3)...(n -7) + [1/(2(n -1)) + 1/(2(n +1))].

But p(n) must be a polynomial, so the term [1/(2(n -1)) + 1/(2(n +1))] must be a polynomial. But that's not possible because as a function, it's a rational function with poles at n=1 and n=-1. Therefore, the only way p(n) is a polynomial is if k is zero, but then p(n) would equal [1/(2(n -1)) + 1/(2(n +1))], which is a rational function, not a polynomial. Therefore, this approach must be wrong.

Wait, that suggests that perhaps p(x) - [1/(2(n -1)) + 1/(2(n +1))] is not a polynomial, which is conflicting with the initial assumption. So, maybe my mistake was somewhere.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption that q(n) = (n² -1)p(n) - n is a polynomial with roots at n=2 through 7 is correct, but then how come p(n) can be expressed as a polynomial? Let me think again.

Wait, q(n) is defined as (n² -1)p(n) - n. So, q(n) is a polynomial of degree 7, as (n² -1)p(n) is degree 7, and n is degree 1, so q(n) is degree 7. Then, q(n) has roots at n=2 through 7, so q(n) = c(n -2)...(n -7). So, that part is correct.

Then, when we plug in n=1, q(1) = (1 -1)p(1) -1 = -1, which gives c = -1/720. So, q(n) is correctly determined.

Therefore, q(n) is a degree 7 polynomial, so p(n) is a degree 5 polynomial. So, p(n) = [q(n) +n]/(n² -1). So, for n=2 through 7, p(n) is equal to [q(n) +n]/(n² -1). So, when we plug in n=8, p(8) = [q(8) +8]/(64 -1).

But q(8) is c*(8 -2)(8 -3)...(8 -7) = (-1/720)*(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) = (-1/720)*(720) = -1. So, p(8) = (-1 +8)/63 = 7/63 = 1/9.

Therefore, p(8) is 1/9. So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. So, q(8) = (-1/720)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1). Let's compute 6*5 = 30, 30*4 = 120, 120*3=360, 360*2=720, 720*1=720. So, 720. So, q(8) = (-1/720)*720 = -1. So, correct.

Therefore, p(8) = (-1 +8)/63 = 7/63 = 1/9.

So, yes, that seems solid. Therefore, the answer is 1/9.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{9}}
</think>

Given a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree 5 such that \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, \ldots, 7 \), we need to find \( p(8) \).

First, we define \( q(n) = (n^2 - 1)p(n) - n \). This polynomial \( q(n) \) has roots at \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), so it can be written as \( q(n) = c(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)(n - 6)(n - 7) \) where \( c \) is a constant.

To find \( c \), we use the fact that \( q(1) = -1 \) because \( p(1) \) is not defined by the given values. Substituting \( n = 1 \) into \( q(n) \):

\[
q(1) = (-1)^2 - 1 = 0
\]

\[
q(1) = c(1 - 2)(1 - 3)(1 - 4)(1 - 5)(1 - 6)(1 - 7) = c(-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6) = c(-720)
\]

Since \( q(1) = -1 \), we have:

\[
-720c = -1 \implies c = \frac{1}{720}
\]

However, upon re-evaluation, it should be:

\[
q(1) = c(-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6) = c(-720) = -1 \implies c = \frac{1}{720}
\]

Thus, \( q(n) = \frac{1}{720}(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)(n - 6)(n - 7) \).

Next, we evaluate \( q(8) \):

\[
q(8) = \frac{1}{720}(8 - 2)(8 - 3)(8 - 4)(8 - 5)(8 - 6)(8 - 7) = \frac{1}{720}(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) = \frac{720}{720} = -1
\]

Finally, we find \( p(8) \):

\[
p(8) = \frac{q(8) + 8}{8^2 - 1} = \frac{-1 + 8}{63} = \frac{7}{63} = \frac{1}{9}
\]

Thus, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{9}}
\]
