Question:
Let $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ be positive real numbers.  Find the minimum value of
\[\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc}.\]

Correct Answer:
By AM-GM,
\[a + b \ge 2 \sqrt{ab},\]so $(a + b)^2 \ge 4ab.$

Also by AM-GM,
\[(a + 2c) + (b + 2c) \ge 2 \sqrt{(a + 2c)(b + 2c)},\]so $(a + b + 4c)^2 \ge 4(a + 2c)(b + 2c).$

Hence,
\begin{align*}
(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2 &\ge 4ab + 4(a + 2c)(b + 2c) \\
&= 8ab + 8ac + 8bc + 16c^2 \\
&= 8(ab + ac + bc + 2c^2).
\end{align*}By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
ab + ac + bc + 2c^2 &= \frac{ab}{2} + \frac{ab}{2} + ac + bc + 2c^2 \\
&\ge 5 \sqrt[5]{\frac{ab}{2} \cdot \frac{ab}{2} \cdot ac \cdot bc \cdot 2c^2} \\
&= 5 \sqrt[5]{\frac{a^3 b^3 c^4}{2}}.
\end{align*}Also by AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
a + b + c &= \frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2} + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{b}{2} + c \\
&\ge 5 \sqrt[5]{\frac{a}{2} \cdot \frac{a}{2} \cdot \frac{b}{2} \cdot \frac{b}{2} \cdot c} \\
&= 5 \sqrt[5]{\frac{a^2 b^2 c}{16}}.
\end{align*}Hence,
\begin{align*}
\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc} &\ge 8 \cdot \frac{5 \sqrt[5]{\frac{a^2 b^2 c}{16}} \cdot 5 \sqrt[5]{\frac{a^3 b^3 c^4}{2}}}{abc} \\
&= 100.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $a = b = 2$ and $c = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{100}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum value of the expression:

\[
\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc}
\]

where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive real numbers. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's parse the expression. The numerator is \((a + b + c)\) multiplied by the sum of two squares: \((a + b)^2\) and \((a + b + 4c)^2\). The denominator is the product \(abc\). So, the entire expression is a ratio of these two quantities.

My goal is to find the minimum value of this expression. Since all variables are positive, I can apply some optimization techniques, maybe using calculus or inequalities like AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz. Let me see which approach might be more straightforward here.

Looking at the numerator, it's a bit complicated, but perhaps I can simplify it by introducing some substitutions. Let me try letting \(x = a + b\) and \(y = c\). Then, the numerator becomes \((x + y)\) times the sum of \(x^2\) and \((x + 4y)^2\). That might make things a bit simpler.

So, substituting, the numerator is:

\[
(x + y)(x^2 + (x + 4y)^2)
\]

Let me compute that:

First, expand \((x + 4y)^2\):

\[
(x + 4y)^2 = x^2 + 8xy + 16y^2
\]

So, the numerator becomes:

\[
(x + y)(x^2 + x^2 + 8xy + 16y^2) = (x + y)(2x^2 + 8xy + 16y^2)
\]

Let me factor out a 2 from the second parenthesis:

\[
(x + y) \times 2(x^2 + 4xy + 8y^2) = 2(x + y)(x^2 + 4xy + 8y^2)
\]

So, now the expression is:

\[
\frac{2(x + y)(x^2 + 4xy + 8y^2)}{abc}
\]

But remember that \(x = a + b\) and \(y = c\), so \(abc = (a + b)c y = x y^2\). Wait, no: \(abc = (a + b) \times c \times y\), but actually \(c = y\), so it's \(abc = (a + b)y \times y = x y^2\). Wait, let's see:

\(a + b = x\), \(c = y\), so \(abc = x \times y \times y = x y^2\). Yes, that's correct.

So, our expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2(x + y)(x^2 + 4xy + 8y^2)}{x y^2}
\]

Let me write that as:

\[
2 \times \frac{(x + y)(x^2 + 4xy + 8y^2)}{x y^2}
\]

Now, perhaps I can split this fraction into two parts:

\[
2 \times \left( \frac{x + y}{x} \times \frac{x^2 + 4xy + 8y^2}{y^2} \right )
\]

Let me compute each part separately.

First, \(\frac{x + y}{x} = 1 + \frac{y}{x}\). Let me denote \(k = \frac{y}{x}\), which is a positive real number since \(x\) and \(y\) are positive. So, \(k > 0\).

Similarly, let me look at the second fraction: \(\frac{x^2 + 4xy + 8y^2}{y^2}\). Let's factor out \(y^2\):

\[
\frac{x^2}{y^2} + \frac{4x}{y} + 8 = \left( \frac{x}{y} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{x}{y} \right) + 8
\]

Again, let me denote \(k = \frac{x}{y}\), so \(x = k y\). Since \(k = \frac{y}{x}\), we have \(k = \frac{1}{k}\), so \(k^2 = \frac{1}{k}\). Thus, \(k^2 = \frac{1}{k}\) implies that \(k^3 = 1\), so \(k = 1\). Wait, that's interesting. So, \(k = 1\).

Wait, hold on. If \(k = \frac{y}{x}\), and \(k = \frac{x}{y}\), then \(\frac{y}{x} = \frac{x}{y}\), which implies \(k^2 = 1\), so \(k = 1\) since \(k > 0\).

Hmm, that's a key point. So, \(k = 1\), which implies \(\frac{y}{x} = 1\), so \(y = x\), meaning \(c = a + b\).

So, we have \(c = a + b\). That's a useful relationship. So, now we can substitute \(y = x = a + b\), so \(c = a + b\).

So, going back to our expression:

\[
2 \times \left( \frac{x + y}{x} \times \frac{x^2 + 4xy + 8y^2}{y^2} \right ) = 2 \times \left( (1 + k) \times \left( k^2 + 4k + 8 \right ) \right )
\]

But since \(k = 1\), substitute \(k = 1\):

\[
2 \times (1 + 1) \times (1 + 4 + 8) = 2 \times 2 \times 13 = 52
\]

Wait, hold on. But that seems too straightforward. If \(k = 1\), then each term inside the brackets becomes \(2 \times (1 + 1) \times (1 + 4 + 8)\), which is 2*2*13=52. But that would mean the expression is 52, but is that the minimal value?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here because the substitution might have constrained variables too much, or maybe the initial substitution wasn't the best approach.

Wait, let's double-check. I set \(x = a + b\), \(y = c\), then \(abc = x y c\), but \(c = y\), so \(abc = x y^2\). Then, the expression is:

\[
\frac{2(x + y)(x^2 + 4xy + 8y^2)}{x y^2}
\]

Then, I let \(k = \frac{y}{x}\), so \(y = k x\), and then \(\frac{x + y}{x} = 1 + k\), and \(\frac{x^2 + 4xy + 8y^2}{y^2} = \left( \frac{x}{y} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{x}{y} \right) + 8 = k^{-2} + 4 k^{-1} + 8\). But if \(k = \frac{y}{x}\), then \(\frac{x}{y} = 1/k\). So, yes, that's correct.

But then, we set \(k = \frac{y}{x}\) and \(k = \frac{x}{y}\), which implies \(k = 1\). So, that suggests that \(k = 1\), so \(y = x\), meaning \(c = a + b\). So, substituting back, let's see.

But perhaps another approach is better. Maybe instead of substituting \(x = a + b\) and \(y = c\), I can use AM-GM or some other inequality on the numerator and denominator.

Looking back at the original expression:

\[
\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc}
\]

Let me denote \(s = a + b\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{(s + c)(s^2 + (s + 4c)^2)}{abc}
\]

And since \(s = a + b\), \(abc = a b c\). But \(s = a + b\), so \(a\) and \(b\) are variables such that \(a + b = s\). Maybe I can fix \(s\) and express \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of \(s\), but that might get complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution variables \(p = a + b\), \(q = ab\), but then I have three variables. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe set \(a = tb\), so that \(a\) and \(b\) are in terms of \(t\), a positive real number. Then, \(a = tb\), so \(a + b = tb + b = b(t + 1)\), which is \(s = b(t + 1)\). Let's see if that helps.

So, substituting \(a = tb\), then:

- \(s = a + b = tb + b = b(t + 1)\), so \(b = s/(t + 1)\), \(a = t s/(t + 1)\).

Then, \(abc = a b c = (t s/(t + 1)) \times (s/(t + 1)) \times c = t s^2 c / (t + 1)^2\).

Now, the numerator:

\[
(s + c)[s^2 + (s + 4c)^2]
\]

Let me compute each part:

Compute \(s^2 + (s + 4c)^2\):

\[
s^2 + (s + 4c)^2 = s^2 + s^2 + 8sc + 16c^2 = 2s^2 + 8sc + 16c^2
\]

So, the numerator is:

\[
(s + c)(2s^2 + 8sc + 16c^2) = (s + c) \times 2(s^2 + 4sc + 8c^2)
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{2(s + c)(s^2 + 4sc + 8c^2)}{t s^2 c / (t + 1)^2}
\]

Simplify denominator:

\[
\frac{2(s + c)(s^2 + 4sc + 8c^2)(t + 1)^2}{t s^2 c}
\]

So, the entire expression is:

\[
2 \times \frac{(s + c)(s^2 + 4sc + 8c^2)(t + 1)^2}{t s^2 c}
\]

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe I should instead fix \(c\) and express \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of \(c\). Let me try that.

Let me set \(c = k\), a positive real number. Then, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{(a + b + k)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4k)^2]}{a b k}
\]

Let me denote \(s = a + b\), so \(s > 0\). Then, the expression is:

\[
\frac{(s + k)(s^2 + (s + 4k)^2)}{a b k}
\]

But \(a\) and \(b\) are positive real numbers such that \(a + b = s\). So, \(a\) and \(b\) are variables with \(a + b = s\), and we can express \(ab\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\): \(ab \leq (s/2)^2\) by AM-GM inequality.

But in order to find the minimum of the expression, maybe I can fix \(s\) and find the optimal \(a\) and \(b\) that minimize the expression for fixed \(s\), then minimize over \(s\).

Alternatively, perhaps consider fixing \(k\) and \(s\) and then optimizing over \(a\) and \(b\). But this might get too involved.

Wait, perhaps if I think of \(a\) and \(b\) as variables, and \(s = a + b\), then \(ab\) is a function of \(s\) as well, with maximum when \(a = b = s/2\). So, perhaps for fixed \(s\) and \(k\), the minimum of the expression occurs when \(a = b = s/2\). Let me test that.

So, assuming \(a = b = s/2\), then \(ab = (s/2)^2 = s^2 / 4\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{(s + k)[s^2 + (s + 4k)^2]}{s^2 k / 4} = \frac{4(s + k)(s^2 + (s + 4k)^2)}{s^2 k}
\]

So, if I can minimize this expression over \(s\) and \(k\), that might help.

Let me denote \(t = s\), so \(t > 0\), \(k > 0\). Then, the expression is:

\[
\frac{4(t + k)(t^2 + (t + 4k)^2)}{t^2 k}
\]

Let me compute the numerator:

First, compute \( (t + 4k)^2 = t^2 + 8tk + 16k^2 \).

So, \(t^2 + (t + 4k)^2 = t^2 + t^2 + 8tk + 16k^2 = 2t^2 + 8tk + 16k^2\).

Therefore, the numerator is:

\[
4(t + k)(2t^2 + 8tk + 16k^2) = 4(t + k) \times 2(t^2 + 4tk + 8k^2) = 8(t + k)(t^2 + 4tk + 8k^2)
\]

So, the expression is:

\[
\frac{8(t + k)(t^2 + 4tk + 8k^2)}{t^2 k}
\]

Let me divide each term in the numerator by \(t^2 k\):

First, \(8(t + k)\) divided by \(t^2 k\) is \(8(t + k)/(t^2 k)\).

Then, \((t^2 + 4tk + 8k^2)\) divided by \(t^2 k\) is \((1 + 4k/t + 8k^2/t^2)/k\).

Wait, maybe not. Let me express it as:

\[
\frac{8(t + k)(t^2 + 4tk + 8k^2)}{t^2 k} = 8 \times \frac{(t + k)}{t^2 k} \times (t^2 + 4tk + 8k^2)
\]

Let me compute each part:

First, \(\frac{t + k}{t^2 k} = \frac{1}{t k} + \frac{1}{t^2 k}\).

Second, \(t^2 + 4tk + 8k^2\) can be written as \(t^2 + 4tk + 8k^2\).

So, multiplying everything together, it's a bit messy, but perhaps I can set \(t = k\) to simplify.

Wait, if \(t = k\), then the expression becomes:

Compute:

\[
8 \times \frac{(k + k)}{k^2 k} \times (k^2 + 4k^2 + 8k^2) = 8 \times \frac{2k}{k^3} \times (13k^2) = 8 \times \frac{2}{k^2} \times 13k^2 = 8 \times 2 \times 13 = 208
\]

Hmm, that gives me 208, but earlier substitution with \(k = 1\) gave me 52, which was less. So, perhaps setting \(t = k\) isn't the right approach.

Wait, but why did setting \(t = k\) lead to a higher value? Maybe that's not the minimal point.

Alternatively, maybe I should set \(t = 2k\) or some multiple. Let me try \(t = 2k\). So, \(t = 2k\), then:

Compute:

First, \(\frac{t + k}{t^2 k} = \frac{2k + k}{(4k^2) k} = \frac{3k}{4k^3} = \frac{3}{4k^2}\).

Second, \(t^2 + 4tk + 8k^2 = 4k^2 + 8k^2 + 8k^2 = 20k^2\).

So, the expression becomes:

\[
8 \times \frac{3}{4k^2} \times 20k^2 = 8 \times \frac{3}{4k^2} \times 20k^2 = 8 \times 15 = 120
\]

Still higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need a different approach. Let's consider calculus optimization.

So, going back to the expression:

\[
f(t, k) = \frac{8(t + k)(t^2 + 4tk + 8k^2)}{t^2 k}
\]

We can try to find the minimum of this function in terms of \(t\) and \(k\). Let me denote \(u = t/k\), so \(t = u k\), where \(u > 0\).

Substituting \(t = u k\) into \(f(t, k)\):

First, \(t + k = u k + k = k(u + 1)\).

\(t^2 = (u k)^2 = u^2 k^2\).

\(t^2 + 4tk + 8k^2 = u^2 k^2 + 4 u k^2 + 8k^2 = k^2(u^2 + 4u + 8)\).

So, the numerator becomes:

\[
8(t + k)(t^2 + 4tk + 8k^2) = 8 \times k(u + 1) \times k^2(u^2 + 4u + 8) = 8 k^3 (u + 1)(u^2 + 4u + 8)
\]

Denominator is \(t^2 k = u^2 k^2 \times k = u^2 k^3\).

So, the expression becomes:

\[
f(u) = \frac{8 k^3 (u + 1)(u^2 + 4u + 8)}{u^2 k^3} = \frac{8 (u + 1)(u^2 + 4u + 8)}{u^2}
\]

So, \(f(u)\) is now a function of \(u\) only:

\[
f(u) = 8 \times \frac{(u + 1)(u^2 + 4u + 8)}{u^2}
\]

Now, we can simplify this further:

Let me compute \((u + 1)(u^2 + 4u + 8)\):

Multiply term by term:

- \(u \times u^2 = u^3\)
- \(u \times 4u = 4u^2\)
- \(u \times 8 = 8u\)
- \(1 \times u^2 = u^2\)
- \(1 \times 4u = 4u\)
- \(1 \times 8 = 8\)

So, adding all together:

\(u^3 + 4u^2 + 8u + u^2 + 4u + 8 = u^3 + 5u^2 + 12u + 8\)

So, \(f(u)\) is:

\[
f(u) = 8 \times \frac{u^3 + 5u^2 + 12u + 8}{u^2} = 8 \times \left( u + 5 + \frac{12}{u} + \frac{8}{u^2} \right )
\]

So, \(f(u) = 8u + 40 + \frac{96}{u} + \frac{64}{u^2}\).

Now, we can consider this as a function of \(u > 0\), and find its minimum.

To find the minimum, take the derivative of \(f(u)\) with respect to \(u\) and set it to zero.

Compute \(f'(u)\):

\[
f'(u) = 8 - \frac{96}{u^2} - \frac{128}{u^3}
\]

Set \(f'(u) = 0\):

\[
8 - \frac{96}{u^2} - \frac{128}{u^3} = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by \(u^3\) to eliminate denominators:

\[
8u^3 - 96u - 128 = 0
\]

Simplify by dividing both sides by 8:

\[
u^3 - 12u - 16 = 0
\]

Now, we have the cubic equation \(u^3 - 12u - 16 = 0\). Let's try to find its real roots.

Using the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are factors of 16 over factors of 1: ±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±16.

Let me test \(u = 4\):

\(4^3 - 12*4 - 16 = 64 - 48 - 16 = 0\). Perfect, so \(u = 4\) is a root.

Therefore, we can factor the cubic as \((u - 4)(u^2 + 4u + 4) = 0\). Wait, let me perform polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide \(u^3 - 12u - 16\) by \(u - 4\):

Using synthetic division:

4 | 1  0  -12  -16

Multiply 4 down:

Bring down 1.

1

Multiply 1 by 4: 4. Add to next coefficient: 0 + 4 = 4.

Multiply 4 by 4: 16. Add to next coefficient: -12 + 16 = 4.

Multiply 4 by 4: 16. Add to last coefficient: -16 + 16 = 0.

So, the cubic factors as:

\[
(u - 4)(u^2 + 4u + 4) = 0
\]

So, the roots are \(u = 4\) and the roots of \(u^2 + 4u + 4 = 0\), which are \(u = -2\) (double root). Since \(u > 0\), the only valid critical point is \(u = 4\).

So, the critical point is at \(u = 4\). Now, we need to verify if this is a minimum.

Compute the second derivative \(f''(u)\):

First, \(f'(u) = 8 - \frac{96}{u^2} - \frac{128}{u^3}\).

So,

\[
f''(u) = \frac{192}{u^3} + \frac{384}{u^4}
\]

Since \(u > 0\), both terms are positive, so \(f''(u) > 0\). Therefore, the critical point at \(u = 4\) is a local minimum. Since the function tends to infinity as \(u\) approaches 0 or infinity, this must be the global minimum.

Therefore, the minimum of \(f(u)\) occurs at \(u = 4\). So, plug \(u = 4\) back into \(f(u)\):

\[
f(4) = 8 \times \frac{(4 + 1)(16 + 16 + 8)}{16} = 8 \times \frac{5 \times 40}{16} = 8 \times \frac{200}{16} = 8 \times 12.5 = 100
\]

Wait, that can't be right because earlier when I set \(k = 1\), the expression was 52, which is less than 100.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, I think I messed up somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, when \(u = 4\), \(t = u k = 4k\), but actually, in our substitution, \(t = a + b = u k\), but earlier, we set \(t = s = a + b\), and \(k = c\). So, \(t = u k\), and \(k = c\). Wait, but I think in the substitution above, I set \(t = a + b\), \(k = c\), and \(u = t / k\), so \(t = u k\). So, in that case, when \(u = 4\), \(t = 4k\). Hmm, so \(s = a + b = 4k\). So, \(a + b = 4c\).

So, then, when I computed \(f(4)\), it's 100, which seems a higher value than earlier.

Wait, but when I substituted \(t = k = 1\), I got 52, which is less than 100, so that suggests that 100 is higher, so 52 is the minimal. So, perhaps the minimal value is 52.

But wait, this seems conflicting. Because when I fixed \(t = k\), I got 52, but when I let \(u = t / k\), I get 100 as a critical point, which is higher. So, that suggests that the minimal occurs at \(t = k\), but that is not necessarily the case.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when I set \(t = k\), that gave me \(f(t, k) = 8(t + t)(t^2 + 4t^2 + 8t^2) / t^2 t = 8*2t*(13t^2)/t^3 = 8*2*13 = 208\). Then, when I set \(t = u k\), I had \(f(u) = 8(u + 1)(u^2 + 4u + 8)/u^2\), which when \(u = 4\) gives \(f(4) = 8*5*40/16 = 8*12.5 = 100\). So, why is this discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps because when I fixed \(t = k\), I assumed \(a = b = s/2\), but in reality, that might not be the optimal point.

Wait, perhaps the minimal occurs when \(a = b\), but not necessarily when \(t = k\). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider using the method of Lagrange multipliers here. Let me try that.

We need to minimize the function:

\[
f(a, b, c) = \frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{a b c}
\]

subject to \(a, b, c > 0\).

To use Lagrange multipliers, we can set up the function:

\[
\mathcal{L}(a, b, c, \lambda) = \frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{a b c} - \lambda (a + b + c - 1)
\]

Wait, but Lagrange multipliers for optimization with multiple variables usually set up the gradient equal to zero.

But maybe instead, I can take logarithms to simplify the optimization.

Let me denote \(f(a, b, c) = \frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{a b c}\). Let me take the natural logarithm to turn the product into a sum, which might make differentiation easier.

Let me define:

\[
\ln f(a, b, c) = \ln(a + b + c) + \ln[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2] - \ln(a) - \ln(b) - \ln(c)
\]

Now, take partial derivatives with respect to \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), set them to zero.

First, partial derivative with respect to \(a\):

\[
\frac{\partial \ln f}{\partial a} = \frac{1}{a + b + c} + \frac{2(a + b) + 2(a + b + 4c)}{ (a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2 } - \frac{1}{a}
\]

Similarly, partial derivative with respect to \(b\):

\[
\frac{\partial \ln f}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{a + b + c} + \frac{2(a + b) + 2(a + b + 4c)}{ (a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2 } - \frac{1}{b}
\]

Partial derivative with respect to \(c\):

\[
\frac{\partial \ln f}{\partial c} = \frac{1}{a + b + c} + \frac{2(a + b + 4c) \times 4}{ (a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2 } - \frac{1}{c}
\]

Set all three partial derivatives to zero.

So, we have the system of equations:

1. \(\frac{1}{a + b + c} + \frac{2(a + b) + 2(a + b + 4c)}{ (a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2 } - \frac{1}{a} = 0\)

2. \(\frac{1}{a + b + c} + \frac{2(a + b) + 2(a + b + 4c)}{ (a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2 } - \frac{1}{b} = 0\)

3. \(\frac{1}{a + b + c} + \frac{8(a + b + 4c)}{ (a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2 } - \frac{1}{c} = 0\)

Now, observe that equations 1 and 2 are identical. So, equations 1 and 2 give the same condition, so we only need to consider two equations.

Let me denote:

Let \(S = a + b\), \(C = c\). Then, \(a + b + c = S + C\).

Let \(D = S\), so \(D = a + b\), \(C = c\).

Then, equation 3 becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{D + C} + \frac{8(D + 4C)}{D^2 + (D + 4C)^2} - \frac{1}{C} = 0
\]

Similarly, equation 1 becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{D + C} + \frac{2D + 2(D + 4C)}{D^2 + (D + 4C)^2} - \frac{1}{D} = 0
\]

Simplify equation 1:

First, numerator of the fraction: \(2D + 2(D + 4C) = 2D + 2D + 8C = 4D + 8C\).

So, equation 1 becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{D + C} + \frac{4D + 8C}{D^2 + (D + 4C)^2} - \frac{1}{D} = 0
\]

Similarly, equation 3:

\[
\frac{1}{D + C} + \frac{8(D + 4C)}{D^2 + (D + 4C)^2} - \frac{1}{C} = 0
\]

Let me denote \(T = D + 4C\), so \(T = a + b + 4c\). Then, equation 1 becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{D + C} + \frac{4D + 8C}{D^2 + T^2} - \frac{1}{D} = 0
\]

Equation 3 becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{D + C} + \frac{8T}{D^2 + T^2} - \frac{1}{C} = 0
\]

Let me also denote \(U = D + C\), so \(U = a + b + c\).

So, equation 1 is:

\[
\frac{1}{U} + \frac{4(D + 2C)}{D^2 + T^2} - \frac{1}{D} = 0
\]

Equation 3 is:

\[
\frac{1}{U} + \frac{8T}{D^2 + T^2} - \frac{1}{C} = 0
\]

This is getting complicated. Let me see if I can find a relationship between \(D\) and \(C\).

Let me suppose that \(D = k C\), where \(k\) is a positive constant. Then, \(D = k C\), and \(T = D + 4C = (k + 4) C\).

So, substituting into equation 1:

First, compute equation 1:

\[
\frac{1}{U} + \frac{4D + 8C}{D^2 + T^2} - \frac{1}{D} = 0
\]

Substitute \(D = k C\), \(T = (k + 4) C\):

\[
\frac{1}{(k C + C)} + \frac{4(k C) + 8C}{(k C)^2 + [(k + 4) C]^2} - \frac{1}{k C} = 0
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{C(k + 1)} + \frac{4k C + 8C}{C^2(k^2 + (k + 4)^2)} - \frac{1}{k C} = 0
\]

Factor out \(C\) in the numerator:

\[
\frac{1}{C(k + 1)} + \frac{C(4k + 8)}{C^2(k^2 + (k + 4)^2)} - \frac{1}{k C} = 0
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{C(k + 1)} + \frac{4k + 8}{C(k^2 + (k + 4)^2)} - \frac{1}{k C} = 0
\]

Factor out \(1/C\):

\[
\frac{1}{C} \left[ \frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{4k + 8}{k^2 + (k + 4)^2} - \frac{1}{k} \right] = 0
\]

Since \(C > 0\), the term inside the brackets must be zero:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{4k + 8}{k^2 + (k + 4)^2} - \frac{1}{k} = 0
\]

Similarly, let's handle equation 3:

\[
\frac{1}{U} + \frac{8T}{D^2 + T^2} - \frac{1}{C} = 0
\]

Substitute \(D = k C\), \(T = (k + 4) C\):

\[
\frac{1}{(k C + C)} + \frac{8(k + 4) C}{(k C)^2 + [(k + 4) C]^2} - \frac{1}{C} = 0
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{C(k + 1)} + \frac{8(k + 4) C}{C^2(k^2 + (k + 4)^2)} - \frac{1}{C} = 0
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{C(k + 1)} + \frac{8(k + 4)}{C(k^2 + (k + 4)^2)} - \frac{1}{C} = 0
\]

Factor out \(1/C\):

\[
\frac{1}{C} \left[ \frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{8(k + 4)}{k^2 + (k + 4)^2} - 1 \right] = 0
\]

Again, since \(C > 0\), the term inside the brackets must be zero:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{8(k + 4)}{k^2 + (k + 4)^2} - 1 = 0
\]

So now, I have two equations in terms of \(k\):

1. \(\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{4k + 8}{k^2 + (k + 4)^2} - \frac{1}{k} = 0\)

2. \(\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{8(k + 4)}{k^2 + (k + 4)^2} - 1 = 0\)

Let me denote \(M = k^2 + (k + 4)^2\). Then, equation 1 becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{4k + 8}{M} - \frac{1}{k} = 0
\]

Equation 2 becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{8(k + 4)}{M} - 1 = 0
\]

Let me write both equations:

Equation 1:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} - \frac{1}{k} + \frac{4k + 8}{M} = 0
\]

Equation 2:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{8(k + 4)}{M} = 1
\]

Let me compute \(\frac{1}{k + 1} - \frac{1}{k}\):

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} - \frac{1}{k} = \frac{k - (k + 1)}{k(k + 1)} = \frac{-1}{k(k + 1)}
\]

So, equation 1 becomes:

\[
-\frac{1}{k(k + 1)} + \frac{4k + 8}{M} = 0 \implies \frac{4k + 8}{M} = \frac{1}{k(k + 1)}
\]

Similarly, equation 2 is:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{8(k + 4)}{M} = 1
\]

Let me denote \(N = \frac{4k + 8}{M}\). Then, from equation 1, \(N = \frac{1}{k(k + 1)}\).

So, substitute \(N\) into equation 2:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} + N = 1 \implies \frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{1}{k(k + 1)} = 1
\]

Combine the terms:

\[
\frac{k + 1 + 1}{k(k + 1)} = 1 \implies \frac{k + 2}{k(k + 1)} = 1
\]

So,

\[
k + 2 = k(k + 1) \implies k + 2 = k^2 + k \implies k^2 + k - k - 2 = 0 \implies k^2 - 2 = 0
\]

Thus, \(k^2 = 2 \implies k = \sqrt{2}\) or \(k = -\sqrt{2}\). Since \(k > 0\), \(k = \sqrt{2}\).

So, \(k = \sqrt{2}\). Now, let's compute \(M\):

\(M = k^2 + (k + 4)^2 = 2 + ( \sqrt{2} + 4 )^2 = 2 + (4 + \sqrt{2})^2\).

Compute \((4 + \sqrt{2})^2 = 16 + 8\sqrt{2} + 2 = 18 + 8\sqrt{2}\).

So, \(M = 2 + 18 + 8\sqrt{2} = 20 + 8\sqrt{2}\).

Now, from equation 1, \(N = \frac{1}{k(k + 1)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{2} + 1)}\).

Let me compute \(N\):

\[
N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{2} + 1)} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2(\sqrt{2} + 1)} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2} + 2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2(\sqrt{2} + 1)} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} + 1}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt{2} - 1\):

\[
N = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{2} - 1)}{(\sqrt{2} + 1)(\sqrt{2} - 1)} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2 - 1} = \frac{1}{2} (2 - \sqrt{2}) = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can keep it as is.

But let's see, we can compute \(M = 20 + 8\sqrt{2}\). So, \(M = 20 + 8\sqrt{2}\).

From equation 1:

\[
\frac{4k + 8}{M} = \frac{1}{k(k + 1)}
\]

Compute \(4k + 8 = 4\sqrt{2} + 8\).

Compute \(k(k + 1) = \sqrt{2}(\sqrt{2} + 1) = 2 + \sqrt{2}\).

So,

\[
\frac{4\sqrt{2} + 8}{20 + 8\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{2}}
\]

Let me rationalize the left-hand side:

Multiply numerator and denominator by \(2 - \sqrt{2}\):

\[
\frac{(4\sqrt{2} + 8)(2 - \sqrt{2})}{(20 + 8\sqrt{2})(2 - \sqrt{2})}
\]

Compute denominator:

\( (20 + 8\sqrt{2})(2 - \sqrt{2}) = 20*2 + 20*(-\sqrt{2}) + 8\sqrt{2}*2 + 8\sqrt{2}(-\sqrt{2}) \)
= \(40 - 20\sqrt{2} + 16\sqrt{2} - 16\)
= \( (40 - 16) + (-20\sqrt{2} + 16\sqrt{2}) \)
= \(24 - 4\sqrt{2}\)

Compute numerator:

\( (4\sqrt{2} + 8)(2 - \sqrt{2}) = 4\sqrt{2}*2 + 4\sqrt{2}*(-\sqrt{2}) + 8*2 + 8*(-\sqrt{2}) \)
= \(8\sqrt{2} - 8 + 16 - 8\sqrt{2}\)
= \( (8\sqrt{2} - 8\sqrt{2}) + (-8 + 16) \)
= \(0 + 8 = 8\)

So, left-hand side is \(8 / (24 - 4\sqrt{2})\). Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 8

Denominator: 4*(6 - sqrt(2))

So,

Left-hand side: \(8 / [4(6 - \sqrt{2})] = 2 / (6 - \sqrt{2})\)

Multiply numerator and denominator by \(6 + \sqrt{2}\):

\(2(6 + \sqrt{2}) / [ (6 - \sqrt{2})(6 + \sqrt{2}) ] = (12 + 2\sqrt{2}) / (36 - 2) = (12 + 2\sqrt{2}) / 34 = (6 + \sqrt{2}) / 17\)

So, left-hand side is \((6 + \sqrt{2}) / 17\). The right-hand side is \(1 / (2 + \sqrt{2})\). Let's compute that:

Multiply numerator and denominator by \(2 - \sqrt{2}\):

\(1*(2 - \sqrt{2}) / [ (2 + \sqrt{2})(2 - \sqrt{2}) ] = (2 - \sqrt{2}) / (4 - 2) = (2 - \sqrt{2}) / 2 = 1 - (\sqrt{2}/2)\).

Wait, but earlier computation shows that left-hand side is \((6 + \sqrt{2}) / 17\), which is approximately (6 + 1.414)/17 ≈ 7.414/17 ≈ 0.436.

The right-hand side is \(1 - \sqrt{2}/2 ≈ 1 - 0.707 ≈ 0.293\). These are not equal. That suggests something went wrong. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution or calculation. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, actually, when I set \(D = k C\), \(T = (k + 4) C\), and then plugged into equation 1 and 2, perhaps there was an error in substitution.

But before, when I set \(k = \sqrt{2}\), then \(D = \sqrt{2} C\), \(T = (\sqrt{2} + 4) C\).

Then, equation 1 was:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{4k + 8}{k^2 + (k + 4)^2} - \frac{1}{k} = 0
\]

Compute each term:

First term: \(1/(k + 1) = 1/(\sqrt{2} + 1)\).

Second term: \(4k + 8 = 4\sqrt{2} + 8\).

Denominator: \(k^2 + (k + 4)^2 = 2 + (sqrt(2) + 4)^2 = 2 + (4 + 2sqrt(2) + 2) = 2 + 6 + 2sqrt(2) = 8 + 2sqrt(2)\).

Third term: 1/k = 1/sqrt(2).

So, equation 1 becomes:

1/(sqrt(2) + 1) + (4sqrt(2) + 8)/(8 + 2sqrt(2)) - 1/sqrt(2) = 0.

Let me compute each term numerically:

First term: 1/(1.414 + 1) ≈ 1/2.414 ≈ 0.414.

Second term: (5.656 + 8)/(8 + 2.828) ≈ 13.656 / 10.828 ≈ 1.264.

Third term: 1/1.414 ≈ 0.707.

So, equation 1: 0.414 + 1.264 - 0.707 ≈ 0.414 + 1.264 = 1.678 - 0.707 ≈ 0.971 ≈ 0.971 ≠ 0.

Hmm, that's not zero. So, maybe my assumption that \(k = \sqrt{2}\) is incorrect.

Wait, but earlier, when I solved equation 1 and 2, I ended up with \(k^2 = 2\), so perhaps that's the correct value, but the discrepancy in the equation suggests an error in substitution or calculations.

Wait, let me check the substitution again.

From equation 1:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{4k + 8}{k^2 + (k + 4)^2} - \frac{1}{k} = 0
\]

Equation 2:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{8(k + 4)}{k^2 + (k + 4)^2} - 1 = 0
\]

Let me denote \(S = k^2 + (k + 4)^2 = 2k^2 + 8k + 16\).

Then, equation 1 becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{4k + 8}{S} - \frac{1}{k} = 0
\]

Equation 2 becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{8(k + 4)}{S} - 1 = 0
\]

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

Equation 2 - Equation 1:

\[
\left[ \frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{8(k + 4)}{S} - 1 \right] - \left[ \frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{4k + 8}{S} - \frac{1}{k} \right] = 0
\]

Simplify:

\[
\left( \frac{8(k + 4)}{S} - \frac{4k + 8}{S} \right) - 1 + \frac{1}{k} = 0
\]

Factor out \(1/S\):

\[
\frac{8(k + 4) - (4k + 8)}{S} - 1 + \frac{1}{k} = 0
\]

Compute numerator:

\(8(k + 4) - (4k + 8) = 8k + 32 - 4k - 8 = 4k + 24\).

So,

\[
\frac{4k + 24}{S} - 1 + \frac{1}{k} = 0
\]

Substitute \(S = 2k^2 + 8k + 16\):

\[
\frac{4k + 24}{2k^2 + 8k + 16} - 1 + \frac{1}{k} = 0
\]

Simplify fractions:

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 4k + 24 = 4(k + 6)

Denominator: 2k^2 + 8k + 16 = 2(k^2 + 4k + 8)

So,

\[
\frac{4(k + 6)}{2(k^2 + 4k + 8)} - 1 + \frac{1}{k} = 0 \implies \frac{2(k + 6)}{k^2 + 4k + 8} - 1 + \frac{1}{k} = 0
\]

Compute:

\[
\frac{2k + 12}{k^2 + 4k + 8} - 1 + \frac{1}{k} = 0
\]

Combine terms:

\[
\frac{2k + 12}{k^2 + 4k + 8} + \frac{1}{k} - 1 = 0
\]

Bring all terms to a common denominator. Let me compute:

Let me denote \(A = k^2 + 4k + 8\), \(B = k\).

So, equation becomes:

\[
\frac{2k + 12}{A} + \frac{1}{B} - 1 = 0
\]

Multiply through by \(AB\):

\[
(2k + 12)B + A - AB = 0
\]

Substitute \(A = k^2 + 4k + 8\) and \(B = k\):

\[
(2k + 12)k + (k^2 + 4k + 8) - k(k^2 + 4k + 8) = 0
\]

Compute each term:

First term: \( (2k + 12)k = 2k^2 + 12k \)

Second term: \(k^2 + 4k + 8\)

Third term: \(-k(k^2 + 4k + 8) = -k^3 - 4k^2 - 8k\)

Combine all terms:

2k^2 + 12k + k^2 + 4k + 8 - k^3 - 4k^2 - 8k = 0

Combine like terms:

- \(k^3\): -k^3

- \(k^2\): 2k^2 + k^2 -4k^2 = (-1)k^2

- \(k\): 12k + 4k -8k = 8k

- Constants: +8

So, the equation becomes:

\[
- k^3 - k^2 + 8k + 8 = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[
k^3 + k^2 - 8k - 8 = 0
\]

Now, we have a cubic equation:

\(k^3 + k^2 - 8k - 8 = 0\)

Let me try to factor this:

Try rational roots using Rational Root Theorem: possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±8.

Test \(k=1\):

1 + 1 - 8 -8 = -14 ≠ 0

Test \(k = -1\):

-1 + 1 + 8 -8 = 0. Yes! \(k = -1\) is a root.

So, factor as (k + 1)(k^2 + 0k -8) = 0.

Thus, \(k = -1\) or \(k^2 -8 = 0 \implies k = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}\), or \(k = -2\sqrt{2}\). Since \(k > 0\), \(k = 2\sqrt{2}\).

So, \(k = 2\sqrt{2}\).

But earlier, when I set \(k = \sqrt{2}\), I got a discrepancy. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.

Wait, so in the Lagrange multiplier method, we end up with \(k = 2\sqrt{2}\).

Let me verify whether \(k = 2\sqrt{2}\) satisfies the earlier equations.

From equation 1:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{4k + 8}{k^2 + (k + 4)^2} - \frac{1}{k} = 0
\]

Compute each term with \(k = 2\sqrt{2}\):

First term: \(1/(2\sqrt{2} + 1)\). Let me compute this:

Approximately, \(2\sqrt{2} ≈ 2.828\), so \(2.828 + 1 = 3.828\), so \(1/3.828 ≈ 0.261\).

Second term: \(4k + 8 = 4*2.828 + 8 ≈ 11.313 + 8 = 19.313\).

Denominator: \(k^2 + (k + 4)^2 = (8) + (2.828 + 4)^2 = 8 + (6.828)^2 ≈ 8 + 46.613 ≈ 54.613\).

So, second term: \(19.313 / 54.613 ≈ 0.354\).

Third term: \(1/k = 1/(2.828) ≈ 0.353\).

So, equation 1: 0.261 + 0.354 - 0.353 ≈ 0.261 + 0.001 ≈ 0.262 ≈ 0.262 ≈ 0. So, approximately holds.

Similarly, equation 2:

\[
\frac{1}{k + 1} + \frac{8(k + 4)}{k^2 + (k + 4)^2} - 1 = 0
\]

Compute each term:

First term: same as above, ≈ 0.261.

Second term: \(8(k + 4) = 8*(2.828 + 4) = 8*6.828 ≈ 54.624\).

Denominator: same as above, ≈ 54.613.

So, second term ≈ 54.624 / 54.613 ≈ 1.0002.

Third term: 1.

So, equation 2: 0.261 + 1.0002 - 1 ≈ 0.261 + 0.0002 ≈ 0.2612 ≈ 0.261 ≈ 0. So, approximately holds.

Therefore, \(k = 2\sqrt{2}\) satisfies both equations.

So, \(k = 2\sqrt{2}\). So, going back to our substitution.

We had \(D = k C\), \(T = (k + 4) C\).

So, \(D = 2\sqrt{2} C\), \(T = (2\sqrt{2} + 4) C\).

Also, \(S = D + 4C = 2\sqrt{2} C + 4C = C(2\sqrt{2} + 4)\).

And \(A = S + C = C(2\sqrt{2} + 4) + C = C(2\sqrt{2} + 5)\).

So, we can now express all variables in terms of \(C\):

\(S = C(2\sqrt{2} + 4)\)

\(D = 2\sqrt{2} C\)

\(T = (2\sqrt{2} + 4) C\)

So, \(a + b = S = C(2\sqrt{2} + 4)\)

\(c = C\)

\(d = T - c = (2\sqrt{2} + 4)C - C = 2\sqrt{2} C\)

So, \(c = C\), \(d = 2\sqrt{2} C\), \(a + b = C(2\sqrt{2} + 4)\).

Now, we can express \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of \(C\). Let me denote \(a = p C\), \(b = (2\sqrt{2} + 4 - p) C\), where \(0 < p < 2\sqrt{2} + 4\).

But perhaps it's better to express the original expression in terms of \(C\).

Recall that the expression we're trying to minimize is:

\[
\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{a b c}
\]

Substituting \(a + b = C(2\sqrt{2} + 4)\), \(c = C\), \(a + b + 4c = C(2\sqrt{2} + 4) + 4C = C(2\sqrt{2} + 8)\).

So,

Numerator: \((C(2\sqrt{2} + 4))[ (C(2\sqrt{2} + 4))^2 + (C(2\sqrt{2} + 8))^2 ]\)

Denominator: \(a b c = p C * (2\sqrt{2} + 4 - p) C * C = p(2\sqrt{2} + 4 - p) C^3\)

So, the expression is:

\[
\frac{C(2\sqrt{2} + 4)[ (C(2\sqrt{2} + 4))^2 + (C(2\sqrt{2} + 8))^2 ]}{p(2\sqrt{2} + 4 - p) C^3}
\]

Simplify:

Factor out \(C^3\) in numerator and denominator:

\[
\frac{(2\sqrt{2} + 4)[ (2\sqrt{2} + 4)^2 + (2\sqrt{2} + 8)^2 ]}{p(2\sqrt{2} + 4 - p) C^2}
\]

Wait, no. Wait, the numerator has \(C(2\sqrt{2} + 4)\) multiplied by the sum of squares inside, which are each multiplied by \(C^2\) and \(C^2\). So, the numerator is \(C(2\sqrt{2} + 4) * [C^2(2\sqrt{2} + 4)^2 + C^2(2\sqrt{2} + 8)^2] = C^3(2\sqrt{2} + 4)[(2\sqrt{2} + 4)^2 + (2\sqrt{2} + 8)^2]\).

Denominator is \(p(2\sqrt{2} + 4 - p) C^3\).

So, expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{(2\sqrt{2} + 4)[(2\sqrt{2} + 4)^2 + (2\sqrt{2} + 8)^2]}{p(2\sqrt{2} + 4 - p)}
\]

Let me compute the constants:

Compute \(2\sqrt{2} + 4 ≈ 2.828 + 4 = 6.828\).

Compute \(2\sqrt{2} + 8 ≈ 2.828 + 8 = 10.828\).

Compute \((2\sqrt{2} + 4)^2 ≈ (6.828)^2 ≈ 46.613\).

Compute \((2\sqrt{2} + 8)^2 ≈ (10.828)^2 ≈ 117.22\).

So, the numerator inside the brackets is \(46.613 + 117.22 ≈ 163.833\).

So, the expression is approximately:

\[
\frac{6.828 * 163.833}{p(6.828 - p)} ≈ \frac{1117.2}{p(6.828 - p)}
\]

So, to minimize this, we need to maximize the denominator \(p(6.828 - p)\), since the numerator is fixed.

The function \(f(p) = p(6.828 - p)\) is a quadratic function opening downward with maximum at \(p = 3.414\).

So, maximum occurs at \(p = 3.414\), which is \(2\sqrt{2}\), since \(2\sqrt{2} ≈ 2.828\). Wait, 3.414 is approximately \( \sqrt{11.657}\), but wait, exact value?

Wait, 3.414 is approximately \(2.378^2\), but actually, let me compute \(2\sqrt{2} ≈ 2.828\), so 2.828 is \(2\sqrt{2}\), so 3.414 is approximately \(2\sqrt{2} + 0.586\), which is not a standard value.

Wait, hold on. The exact value is when \(p = (6.828)/2 = 3.414\). But 3.414 is approximately \(2\sqrt{2} + 0.586\), but exactly, \(3.414\) is \(2\sqrt{2} + 0.586\), which is not a standard multiple of \(\sqrt{2}\).

Wait, but actually, 3.414 is approximately \( (2 + \sqrt{2})^2 \). Wait, \(2 + \sqrt{2} ≈ 3.414\), so \( (2 + \sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + 4\sqrt{2} + 2 = 6 + 4\sqrt{2} ≈ 6 + 5.656 ≈ 11.656\), which is not 3.414. So, perhaps 3.414 is just a number.

Wait, but let me compute \(f(p) = p(6.828 - p)\). At \(p = 3.414\), \(f(p) = 3.414 * (6.828 - 3.414) = 3.414 * 3.414 ≈ 11.657\).

If I take \(p = 2\sqrt{2} ≈ 2.828\), then \(f(p) = 2.828 * (6.828 - 2.828) = 2.828 * 4 = 11.313\).

So, \(f(p)\) is maximized at \(p = 3.414\), where it is approximately 11.657.

Thus, the minimal value of the expression is approximately:

\[
\frac{1117.2}{11.657} ≈ 96
\]

Wait, 1117.2 / 11.657 ≈ 96.

Wait, 11.657 * 96 ≈ 1117.2, yes.

So, the minimal value is approximately 96. Let me check whether 96 is indeed the exact value.

Wait, let me compute \(11.657\) is approximately \( (2 + \sqrt{2})^2 ≈ 11.657\). So, \(11.657 = (2 + \sqrt{2})^2\).

Wait, \( (2 + \sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + 4\sqrt{2} + 2 = 6 + 4\sqrt{2} ≈ 6 + 5.656 ≈ 11.656\). So, 11.657 is exactly \(6 + 4\sqrt{2}\).

So, \(f(p) = (2 + \sqrt{2})^2 = 6 + 4\sqrt{2}\).

So, the minimal value is:

\[
\frac{(2\sqrt{2} + 4)[(2\sqrt{2} + 4)^2 + (2\sqrt{2} + 8)^2]}{6 + 4\sqrt{2}} = \frac{11.657}{6 + 4\sqrt{2}} \times \text{something}
\]

Wait, no. Wait, earlier, the expression is:

\[
\frac{1117.2}{11.657} ≈ 96
\]

But 1117.2 / 11.657 is approximately 96. So, is 96 the exact value?

Wait, let me compute it symbolically.

We have:

Numerator: \((2\sqrt{2} + 4)[(2\sqrt{2} + 4)^2 + (2\sqrt{2} + 8)^2]\)

Denominator: \(6 + 4\sqrt{2}\)

Compute each term:

First, compute \((2\sqrt{2} + 4)^2 = (2\sqrt{2})^2 + 2*(2\sqrt{2})*4 + 4^2 = 8 + 16\sqrt{2} + 16 = 24 + 16\sqrt{2}\)

Compute \((2\sqrt{2} + 8)^2 = (2\sqrt{2})^2 + 2*(2\sqrt{2})*8 + 8^2 = 8 + 32\sqrt{2} + 64 = 72 + 32\sqrt{2}\)

So, numerator:

\[
(2\sqrt{2} + 4)(24 + 16\sqrt{2} + 72 + 32\sqrt{2}) = (2\sqrt{2} + 4)(96 + 48\sqrt{2})
\]

Simplify:

Factor out 48 from the second term:

\[
(2\sqrt{2} + 4) * 48(2 + \sqrt{2}) = 48(2\sqrt{2} + 4)(2 + \sqrt{2})
\]

Compute \((2\sqrt{2} + 4)(2 + \sqrt{2})\):

\[
2\sqrt{2} * 2 + 2\sqrt{2} * \sqrt{2} + 4 * 2 + 4 * \sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2} + 4 + 8 + 4\sqrt{2} = (4\sqrt{2} + 4\sqrt{2}) + (4 + 8) = 8\sqrt{2} + 12
\]

So, the numerator becomes:

\[
48(8\sqrt{2} + 12) = 48*12 + 48*8\sqrt{2} = 576 + 384\sqrt{2}
\]

Denominator is \(6 + 4\sqrt{2}\).

So, expression:

\[
\frac{576 + 384\sqrt{2}}{6 + 4\sqrt{2}}
\]

Factor numerator and denominator:

Factor numerator: 576 + 384√2 = 48*(12 + 8√2) = 48*(8√2 + 12). Wait, 48*(8√2 + 12) is same as 48*4*(2√2 + 3) = 192*(2√2 + 3). Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Wait, let me rationalize the denominator.

Multiply numerator and denominator by \(6 - 4\sqrt{2}\):

So,

Numerator: \((576 + 384\sqrt{2})(6 - 4\sqrt{2})\)

Denominator: \((6 + 4\sqrt{2})(6 - 4\sqrt{2}) = 36 - 32 = 4\).

Compute numerator:

First, expand:

576*6 + 576*(-4√2) + 384√2*6 + 384√2*(-4√2)

Compute each term:

576*6 = 3456

576*(-4√2) = -2304√2

384√2*6 = 2304√2

384√2*(-4√2) = -384*4*(√2)^2 = -384*4*2 = -3072

So, adding all terms:

3456 - 2304√2 + 2304√2 - 3072 = (3456 - 3072) + (-2304√2 + 2304√2) = 384 + 0 = 384

Therefore, numerator is 384.

Denominator is 4, so expression is 384 / 4 = 96.

Wow! So, the exact value is 96. So, regardless of the value of \(k\), it turns out that the minimal value is 96.

Therefore, the minimal value of the given expression is 96.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{96}
</think>

To find the minimum value of the expression:

\[
\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc}
\]

where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive real numbers, we start by simplifying the expression. We introduce substitutions \(x = a + b\) and \(y = a + b + 4c\), transforming the expression into:

\[
\frac{(x + c)(x^2 + y^2)}{abc}
\]

Expressing \(c\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\), we get \(c = \frac{y - x}{4}\). Substituting back, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{(x + \frac{y - x}{4})\left(x^2 + (\frac{y - x}{4} + x)^2\right)}{abc}
\]

Simplifying further, we find that the expression can be rewritten in terms of \(S = a + b + c\) and \(T = a + b + 4c\):

\[
\frac{S(T^2 + S^2)}{S^2 - 4S + 8c}
\]

We then use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the critical points. After several steps of substitution and simplification, we find that the minimum value occurs when \(k = 2\sqrt{2}\). This leads us to the final expression:

\[
\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc}
\]

Through detailed algebraic manipulation and substitution, we find that the minimum value of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{96}
\]
