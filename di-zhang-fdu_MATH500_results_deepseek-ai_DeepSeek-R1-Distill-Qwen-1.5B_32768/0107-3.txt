Question:
Let $\lambda$ be a constant, $0 \le \lambda \le 4,$ and let $f : [0,1] \to [0,1]$ be defined by
\[f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x).\]Find the values of $\lambda,$ $0 \le \lambda \le 4,$ for which there exists an $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$ but $f(f(x)) = x.$

Correct Answer:
We have that
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda \cdot \lambda x(1 - x) (1 - \lambda x(1 - x)),\]so we want to solve $\lambda \cdot \lambda x(1 - x) (1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.$

Note that if $f(x) = x,$ then $f(f(x)) = f(x) = x,$ so any roots of $\lambda x(1 - x) = x$ will also be roots of $\lambda \cdot \lambda x(1 - x) (1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.$  Thus, we should expect $\lambda x(1 - x) - x$ to be a factor of $\lambda \cdot \lambda x(1 - x) (1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) - x.$  Indeed,
\[\lambda \cdot \lambda x(1 - x) (1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) - x = (\lambda x(1 - x) - x)(\lambda^2 x^2 - (\lambda^2 + \lambda) x + \lambda + 1).\]The discriminant of $\lambda^2 x^2 - (\lambda^2 + \lambda) x + \lambda + 1$ is
\[(\lambda^2 + \lambda)^2 - 4 \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1) = \lambda^4 - 2 \lambda^3 - 3 \lambda^2 = \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)(\lambda - 3).\]This is nonnegative when $\lambda = 0$ or $3 \le \lambda \le 4.$

If $\lambda = 0,$ then $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \in [0,1].$

If $\lambda = 3,$ then the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ becomes
\[(3x(1 - x) - x)(9x^2 - 12x + 4) = 0.\]The roots of $9x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0$ are both $\frac{2}{3},$ which satisfy $f(x) = x.$

On the other hand, for $\lambda > 3,$ the roots of $\lambda x(1 - x) = x$ are $x = 0$ and $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.$  Clearly $x = 0$ is not a root of $\lambda^2 x^2 - (\lambda^2 + \lambda) x + \lambda + 1 = 0.$  Also, if $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda},$ then
\[\lambda^2 x^2 - (\lambda^2 + \lambda) x + \lambda + 1 = \lambda^2 \left( \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \right)^2 - (\lambda^2 + \lambda) \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda + 1 = 3 - \lambda \neq 0.\]Furthermore, the product of the roots is $\frac{\lambda + 1}{\lambda^2},$ which is positive, so either both roots are positive or both roots are negative.  Since the sum of the roots is $\frac{\lambda^2 + \lambda}{\lambda^2} > 0,$ both roots are positive.  Also,
\[\frac{\lambda^2 + \lambda}{\lambda} = 1 + \frac{1}{\lambda} < \frac{4}{3},\]so at least one root must be less than 1.

Therefore, the set of $\lambda$ that satisfy the given condition is $\lambda \in \boxed{(3,4]}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the values of λ between 0 and 4 such that there's an x in [0,1] where f(x) is not equal to x, but when you apply the function f twice, you get back to x. The function f is given by f(x) = λx(1 - x). 

Hmm, let me parse this. So f is a function from [0,1] to [0,1], which means it maps numbers between 0 and 1 to numbers in the same range. The function is a quadratic, which I know graphs as a parabola. It has a maximum at x = 1/2, right? Since it's λx(1 - x), which is a quadratic equation. 

So, the problem is essentially asking for the λ values where f is not the identity function (since f(x) ≠ x for some x), but f composed with f gives the identity function. In other words, f is not its own inverse everywhere, but applying it twice brings you back to x. 

Wait, actually, if f is not the identity function, but f(f(x)) = x for some x, then f is a function that is not injective or surjective? Maybe, but I should think more carefully.

First, let's note that f is a quadratic function, so it's symmetric around x = 1/2. The fixed points of f are solutions to f(x) = x, which is λx(1 - x) = x. Let me write that down:

λx(1 - x) = x.

Let me solve for x:

λx - λx^2 = x.

Bring all terms to one side:

λx - λx^2 - x = 0.

Factor out x:

x(λ - λx - 1) = 0.

So, x = 0 is a solution, and the other solution is:

λ - λx - 1 = 0 ⇒ λx = λ - 1 ⇒ x = (λ - 1)/λ.

Therefore, f has two fixed points: x = 0 and x = (λ - 1)/λ. 

But the problem says that there exists an x where f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x. So, f is not the identity, but applying it twice gives the identity. That suggests that f is not injective, because if f were injective, then since f(f(x)) = x, f would have to be its own inverse, which would imply that f is bijective. But since f is quadratic, it's not injective on [0,1]. So, f is not injective, so f is not its own inverse everywhere. Therefore, f is not invertible on [0,1], which makes sense because it's a quadratic.

So, we can expect that for some x, f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. So, for such x, f is an involution on that particular cycle. But since f is not injective, it's possible to have such points.

Wait, but let me think about fixed points. If f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x, then f swaps x with another point, say y, such that f(x) = y and f(y) = x. So, in this case, x and y form a 2-cycle. So, f is not injective, but it still has some 2-cycles besides the fixed points.

But the problem doesn't specify that f has to have only fixed points and 2-cycles. It just says that there exists some x where f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x. So, perhaps f could have more cycles, but at least one 2-cycle.

But we need to find the values of λ for which such an x exists. So, regardless of other cycles, as long as there's at least one 2-cycle, that is, at least one x where f(x) ≠ x and f(f(x)) = x, then the answer is λ such that f has at least one 2-cycle.

But let me think about the graph of f. Since f is a quadratic, it's a parabola opening downward because the coefficient of x² is -λ. So, it has a maximum at x = 1/2, as I thought earlier.

So, the function f maps [0,1] to [0,1]. Let me compute f(0) and f(1):

f(0) = λ*0*(1 - 0) = 0.

f(1) = λ*1*(1 - 1) = 0.

So, both endpoints map to 0. The vertex is at x = 1/2, f(1/2) = λ*(1/2)*(1 - 1/2) = λ*(1/2)*(1/2) = λ/4.

So, the maximum value of f is λ/4.

But since f maps [0,1] to [0,1], the maximum value λ/4 must be ≤ 1. So, λ/4 ≤ 1 ⇒ λ ≤ 4. Which we already know.

So, for λ between 0 and 4, f maps [0,1] to [0,1]. The fixed points are x = 0 and x = (λ - 1)/λ.

Now, to find the values of λ where there exists an x ≠ fixed point with f(f(x)) = x, but f(x) ≠ x.

Let's think about f(f(x)) = x. Let me write that equation:

f(f(x)) = x.

Which is f(λx(1 - x)) = x.

Let me compute f(y) where y = λx(1 - x):

f(y) = λy(1 - y).

So, f(f(x)) = λ*(λx(1 - x))*(1 - λx(1 - x)).

Set that equal to x:

λ*(λx(1 - x))*(1 - λx(1 - x)) = x.

So, that is:

λ²x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = x.

Assuming x ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by x:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = 1.

So, we have:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) = 1.

Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe we can manipulate it.

Let me denote y = x for simplicity.

So, the equation is:

λ²(1 - y)(1 - λy + λy²) = 1.

Let me expand this:

First, multiply (1 - y)(1 - λy + λy²):

= 1*(1 - λy + λy²) - y*(1 - λy + λy²)

= 1 - λy + λy² - y + λy² - λy³

Combine like terms:

1 - (λ + 1)y + (λ + λ)y² - λy³

Simplify:

1 - (λ + 1)y + 2λ y² - λ y³

So, the equation becomes:

λ² [1 - (λ + 1)y + 2λ y² - λ y³] = 1.

Let me expand that:

λ² - λ²(λ + 1)y + 2λ³ y² - λ^3 y³ = 1.

Bring all terms to one side:

λ² - λ²(λ + 1)y + 2λ³ y² - λ^3 y³ - 1 = 0.

So, that's a cubic equation in y:

-λ^3 y³ + 2λ³ y² - λ²(λ + 1)y + (λ² - 1) = 0.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

λ^3 y³ - 2λ³ y² + λ²(λ + 1)y - (λ² - 1) = 0.

So, the equation we need to solve is:

λ³ y³ - 2λ³ y² + λ²(λ + 1)y - (λ² - 1) = 0.

This is a cubic equation in y. So, for each λ, we can write this equation and solve for y. The solutions will give us the x's where f(f(x)) = x. 

We know that when y is a fixed point, f(y) = y, so y must satisfy the original fixed point equation. So, let's see if the fixed points are solutions to this cubic.

From before, fixed points are y = 0 and y = (λ - 1)/λ.

So, let's check y = 0:

Plug into the cubic: 0 - 0 + 0 - (λ² - 1) = - (λ² - 1). So, this is 0 only if λ² - 1 = 0, which is when λ = 1 or λ = -1. But since λ is between 0 and 4, λ = 1 is a fixed point.

Similarly, check y = (λ - 1)/λ:

Let me substitute y = (λ - 1)/λ into the cubic equation.

Compute each term:

First term: λ³ y³ = λ³ [(λ - 1)/λ]^3 = λ³ * (λ - 1)^3 / λ³ = (λ - 1)^3.

Second term: -2λ³ y² = -2λ³ [(λ - 1)/λ]^2 = -2λ³ * (λ - 1)^2 / λ² = -2λ(λ - 1)^2.

Third term: λ²(λ + 1)y = λ²(λ + 1)*(λ - 1)/λ = λ(λ + 1)(λ - 1).

Fourth term: -(λ² - 1) = -(λ - 1)(λ + 1).

So, adding all terms together:

(λ - 1)^3 - 2λ(λ - 1)^2 + λ(λ + 1)(λ - 1) - (λ - 1)(λ + 1).

Factor out (λ - 1):

(λ - 1)[(λ - 1)^2 - 2λ(λ - 1) + λ(λ + 1) - (λ + 1)].

Let me compute the bracketed expression:

First term: (λ - 1)^2 = λ² - 2λ + 1.

Second term: -2λ(λ - 1) = -2λ² + 2λ.

Third term: λ(λ + 1) = λ² + λ.

Fourth term: -(λ + 1) = -λ -1.

So, adding all these together:

(λ² - 2λ + 1) + (-2λ² + 2λ) + (λ² + λ) + (-λ -1).

Combine like terms:

λ² - 2λ + 1 - 2λ² + 2λ + λ² + λ - λ -1.

Compute term by term:

λ² - 2λ² + λ² = 0.

-2λ + 2λ + λ - λ = 0.

1 -1 = 0.

So, the bracketed expression is 0. Therefore, the fixed points are indeed solutions.

Therefore, the cubic equation has at least two real roots: y = 0 and y = (λ - 1)/λ. The third root is something else, which we can denote as y = z.

So, the cubic equation is factored as (y)(y - (λ - 1)/λ)(something) = 0. But I don't think that's helpful.

Instead, perhaps I can find the third root. Since we have a cubic equation, let's denote it as:

λ³ y³ - 2λ³ y² + λ²(λ + 1)y - (λ² - 1) = 0.

We can use the fact that for a cubic equation a y³ + b y² + c y + d = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a.

So, here, sum of roots is 2λ³ / λ³ = 2.

We already know two roots: 0 and (λ -1)/λ. Let the third root be z. Then,

0 + (λ -1)/λ + z = 2 ⇒ z = 2 - (λ - 1)/λ = (2λ - λ + 1)/λ = (λ + 1)/λ.

Therefore, the third root is z = (λ + 1)/λ.

Therefore, the roots are y = 0, y = (λ - 1)/λ, and y = (λ + 1)/λ.

So, the equation f(f(x)) = x has three solutions: x = 0, x = (λ -1)/λ, and x = (λ + 1)/λ.

But wait, let me check if these roots are within [0,1].

First, x = 0 is always a fixed point, so that's fine.

Second, x = (λ -1)/λ.

Since λ is between 0 and 4, let's see:

If λ > 1, then (λ -1)/λ = 1 - 1/λ < 1.

If λ = 1, then (λ -1)/λ = 0, which is the other fixed point.

If λ < 1, say λ = 0.5, then (λ -1)/λ = (-0.5)/0.5 = -1, which is outside [0,1]. So, for λ <1, x = (λ -1)/λ is negative, hence not in [0,1].

Third, x = (λ +1)/λ = 1 + 1/λ.

Since λ ≥0, 1 + 1/λ ≥ 1. But since λ ≤4, 1 + 1/4 = 1.25. So, if λ is between 0 and 1, 1 + 1/λ is greater than 2, which is outside [0,1]. If λ is 1, 1 + 1/1 = 2, which is outside. If λ >1, say λ=2, x = 1 + 1/2 = 1.5, still outside [0,1]. Wait, so for λ >1, x = (λ +1)/λ =1 +1/λ is still greater than 1, because 1/λ <1. So, for λ >1, x = (λ +1)/λ is greater than 1, which is outside the domain. So, for λ >1, the only solutions within [0,1] are x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ.

But wait, as we saw, if λ <1, (λ -1)/λ is negative, so only x=0 is a fixed point in [0,1]. If λ =1, x=0 is the other fixed point, and x=0 is also a solution.

So, for λ ≥1, the function f has two fixed points: x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ. For λ <1, only x=0 is a fixed point.

But in the problem statement, it says "there exists an x ∈ [0,1] such that f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x." So, for λ <1, the only x in [0,1] where f(x) ≠x is x=(λ -1)/λ, but that's negative, so not in [0,1]. So, for λ <1, no such x exists.

For λ ≥1, f has two fixed points: x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ. So, the other solution is x=(λ +1)/λ, which is outside [0,1]. Therefore, for λ ≥1, there is another point y=(λ -1)/λ in [0,1] where f(y) ≠ y but f(f(y))=y. So, in this case, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think: For λ ≥1, x=(λ -1)/λ is in [0,1], because (λ -1)/λ = 1 - 1/λ. Since λ ≥1, 1/λ ≤1, so x=(λ -1)/λ is between 0 and1.

So, for λ ≥1, x=(λ -1)/λ is in [0,1], and since it's not a fixed point (because λ >1, so x ≠0), then f(x) ≠x, but f(f(x))=x. Therefore, such an x exists.

However, when λ =1, (λ -1)/λ=0, which is the same as the other fixed point. So, for λ =1, we have only one fixed point. Wait, is that true?

Wait, when λ =1, f(x) = x(1 - x). So, fixed points are x=0 and x=1 - x ⇒ x=0.5. Wait, no:

Wait, when λ=1, f(x)=x(1 -x). So, fixed points are solutions to x =x(1 - x). So, x =x -x² ⇒ x²=0 ⇒ x=0. So, only x=0 is the fixed point. So, for λ=1, only x=0 is fixed, and x=(λ -1)/λ=0, so it's the same as the other fixed point.

Wait, so for λ=1, the function f has only one fixed point at x=0. Then, for λ >1, we have two fixed points: x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ. So, in that case, we have two fixed points. Therefore, for λ >1, we have two fixed points, so we can find x such that f(x) ≠x but f(f(x))=x. So, such x exists.

But when λ=1, only x=0 is fixed, so is there an x ≠0 such that f(f(x))=x?

Let me check for λ=1.

So, f(x) =x(1 -x). Let me compute f(f(x)):

f(f(x)) = f(x(1 -x)) = x(1 -x) * (1 - x(1 -x)).

Compute 1 -x(1 -x) =1 -x +x².

Thus, f(f(x)) =x(1 -x)(1 -x +x²).

Set this equal to x.

So, x(1 -x)(1 -x +x²) =x.

Assuming x ≠0, we can divide both sides by x:

(1 -x)(1 -x +x²) =1.

Compute (1 -x)(1 -x +x²):

=1*(1 -x +x²) -x*(1 -x +x²)

=1 -x +x² -x +x² -x³

Combine like terms:

1 -2x +2x² -x³.

Set equal to 1:

1 -2x +2x² -x³ =1.

Subtract 1 from both sides:

-2x +2x² -x³ =0.

Factor:

-x(2 -2x +x²)=0.

So, either x=0 or 2 -2x +x²=0.

Solve 2 -2x +x²=0:

x² -2x +2=0.

Discriminant: 4 -8= -4 <0. So, no real solutions.

Therefore, for λ=1, the only real solution is x=0. So, there is no x ≠0 with f(f(x))=x. So, for λ=1, the only solution is x=0.

Therefore, in summary:

- For 0 ≤λ <1: only x=0 is a fixed point, so no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x.

- For λ=1: only x=0 is a fixed point, so again, no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x.

- For λ >1: two fixed points, x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ, and another solution x=(λ +1)/λ which is outside [0,1]. Therefore, there exists an x in [0,1] where f(x)≠x but f(f(x))=x.

But wait, hold on. Earlier, I thought that for λ ≥1, the cubic equation has three roots, two in [0,1] and one outside. So, for λ >1, the solutions are x=0, x=(λ -1)/λ, and x=(λ +1)/λ. But only x=(λ -1)/λ is in [0,1]. So, for λ >1, there exists x in [0,1] with f(x)≠x but f(f(x))=x.

However, when λ=1, x=(λ +1)/λ=2 is outside [0,1], so only x=0 is fixed. But wait, is there another solution?

Wait, when λ=1, f(x)=x(1 -x). So, f(f(x))=f(x(1 -x))=x(1 -x)*(1 -x(1 -x)).

Set that equal to x:

x(1 -x)(1 -x +x²)=x.

So, as I did before, dividing by x:

(1 -x)(1 -x +x²)=1.

Which leads to 1 -2x +2x² -x³=1 ⇒ -2x +2x² -x³=0 ⇒ x(-2 +2x -x²)=0.

So, solutions x=0 or solving 2x² -2x -x=0? Wait, 2x² -2x -x³=0?

Wait, no, no, 1 -2x +2x² -x³=1.

Wait, 1 -2x +2x² -x³ -1= -2x +2x² -x³=0.

So, factor:

x(-2 +2x -x²)=0. So, x=0 or -2 +2x -x²=0.

Multiply both sides by -1: x² -2x +2=0.

Discriminant: 4 -8=-4 <0, so no real roots. Therefore, only x=0 is a solution. So, for λ=1, only x=0 is fixed point.

Wait, but in the equation above, x=0 is a solution, but it's a fixed point. So, perhaps for λ=1, the only x in [0,1] with f(f(x))=x is x=0, so there's no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x. Thus, for λ=1, the condition isn't satisfied.

But wait, for λ=2, let's test numerically.

Take λ=2, so f(x)=2x(1 -x). Let's compute f(f(x)).

First, f(x)=2x(1 -x).

Compute f(f(x))=2*(2x(1 -x))*(1 -2x(1 -x)).

Compute 1 -2x(1 -x)=1 -2x + 2x².

Thus, f(f(x))=2*(2x(1 -x))*(1 -2x +2x²).

Simplify:

=4x(1 -x)(1 -2x +2x²).

Set equal to x:

4x(1 -x)(1 -2x +2x²)=x.

Assuming x≠0, divide by x:

4(1 -x)(1 -2x +2x²)=1.

Compute (1 -x)(1 -2x +2x²):

=1*(1 -2x +2x²) -x*(1 -2x +2x²)

=1 -2x +2x² -x +2x² -2x³

Combine like terms:

1 -3x +4x² -2x³.

Set equal to 1/4:

1 -3x +4x² -2x³=1/4.

Subtract 1:

-3x +4x² -2x³= -3/4.

Multiply both sides by -1:

3x -4x² +2x³=3/4.

Bring all terms to one side:

2x³ -4x² +3x - 3/4=0.

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate fraction:

8x³ -16x² +12x -3=0.

Hmm, this is a cubic equation. Maybe it factors? Let me try x=1:

8 -16 +12 -3=1≠0.

x=3/4:

8*(27/64) -16*(9/16) +12*(3/4) -3.

Compute step by step:

8*(27/64)= (8/64)*27= (1/8)*27=27/8=3.375.

-16*(9/16)= -9.

12*(3/4)=9.

So, 3.375 -9 +9 -3=0.375≠0.

x=1/2:

8*(1/8) -16*(1/4) +12*(1/2) -3=1 -4 +6 -3=0.

So, x=1/2 is a root.

Therefore, factor out (x -1/2):

Use polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide 8x³ -16x² +12x -3 by (x -1/2).

Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 8 | -16 |12 | -3

Root:1/2

Bring down 8.

Multiply 8 by 1/2:4. Add to -16: -12.

Multiply -12 by 1/2: -6. Add to 12:6.

Multiply 6 by 1/2:3. Add to -3:0.

So, the cubic factors as (x -1/2)(8x² -12x +6).

Set equal to zero: (x -1/2)(8x² -12x +6)=0.

So, solutions are x=1/2, and the roots of 8x² -12x +6=0.

Compute discriminant:144 -192= -48 <0. So, only real solution is x=1/2.

Therefore, for λ=2, x=1/2 is a solution where f(x)≠x but f(f(x))=x.

Indeed, f(1/2)=2*(1/2)*(1 -1/2)=2*(1/2)*(1/2)=2*(1/4)=1/2. Wait, that's equal to x. So, x=1/2 is a fixed point. But that's the same as the other fixed points.

Wait, but earlier, for λ=2, f(x)=2x(1 -x). The fixed points are x=0 and x=1/2. So, x=1/2 is the other fixed point. So, in this case, is x=1/2 a fixed point?

Wait, actually, when λ=2, f(x)=2x(1 -x). So, f(1/2)=2*(1/2)*(1 -1/2)=2*(1/2)*(1/2)=1/2. So, f(1/2)=1/2. So, it's a fixed point.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought about f(f(x)), for λ=2, the equation f(f(x))=x has another solution x=(2 +1)/2=3/2, which is outside [0,1]. So, perhaps in this case, both fixed points are in [0,1], and f(f(x))=x is satisfied at x=0 and x=1/2, but x=3/2 is outside.

Wait, but no, when I set f(f(x))=x, I found that x=0, x=1/2, and x=3/2 are solutions, but x=3/2 is outside. So, in the interval [0,1], only x=0 and x=1/2 are solutions. So, for λ=2, the only solutions are fixed points, so no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x. But earlier, when I tried to compute f(f(1/2)), I found f(f(1/2))=f(1/2)=1/2, which is a fixed point.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, for λ=2, f(f(x))=x is equivalent to x=0 or x=1/2, as we saw.

Wait, but if I plug x=1/2 into f(f(x)): f(1/2)=1/2, so f(f(1/2))=f(1/2)=1/2. So, that's consistent. So, x=1/2 is a fixed point.

Therefore, for λ=2, the only solutions to f(f(x))=x are fixed points. So, no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x.

But when I tried to compute the equation, I found x=0, x=1/2, and x=3/2. But x=3/2 is outside [0,1], so in [0,1], only x=0 and x=1/2. So, no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x.

But earlier, when I tried to solve for when f(f(x))=x, and found that for λ >1, we have two fixed points, but in this case, for λ=2, it's only two fixed points. So, perhaps only when λ>1, in [0,1], there's another solution x=(λ -1)/λ which is in [0,1], and another solution x=(λ +1)/λ which is outside.

But for λ=2, x=(λ -1)/λ=1/2, which is a fixed point, so not an x≠0 with f(f(x))=x. So, perhaps for λ>1, the only solution is x=(λ -1)/λ, but that is a fixed point, not a non-fixed point.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, when I considered λ=2, I thought that f(f(x))=x had solutions at x=0, x=1/2, and x=3/2, but only x=0 and x=1/2 are in [0,1]. So, for λ=2, indeed, only x=0 and x=1/2 are solutions, so no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x.

But earlier, I thought for λ=2, f(f(x))=x has an x≠0 which is x=(λ +1)/λ=3/2, which is outside [0,1]. So, in [0,1], only x=0 and x=1/2.

Wait, so perhaps my conclusion earlier was correct: For λ >1, we have two fixed points, x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ, and another solution x=(λ +1)/λ outside [0,1]. Therefore, in [0,1], only x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ are solutions to f(f(x))=x. So, for λ >1, the only x in [0,1] with f(f(x))=x is x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ. So, if x=(λ -1)/λ≠0, then f(x)≠x but f(f(x))=x.

Wait, but in the case of λ=2, x=(λ -1)/λ=1/2. So, f(f(1/2))=f(1/2)=1/2, so it's a fixed point.

So, in this case, f(f(x))=x is satisfied only at x=0 and x=1/2, so there is no x≠0 in [0,1] with f(f(x))=x.

Wait, so perhaps for λ >1, even though we have x=(λ -1)/λ in [0,1], f(x)≠x because λ >1, so x=(λ -1)/λ≠0, so f(x)≠x, and f(f(x))=x.

Wait, but in the case of λ=2, f(x)=2x(1 -x). Then, f(1/2)=1/2. So, f(x)=x. So, x=1/2 is a fixed point.

Wait, but if λ=2, let's compute for another x, say x=1/4.

f(1/4)=2*(1/4)*(1 -1/4)=2*(1/4)*(3/4)=2*(3/16)=3/8.

Then, f(f(1/4))=f(3/8)=2*(3/8)*(1 -3/8)=2*(3/8)*(5/8)=2*(15/64)=30/64=15/32≠1/4.

So, f(f(1/4))=15/32≠1/4. So, f(f(x))≠x.

Wait, what about x=1/3.

f(1/3)=2*(1/3)*(2/3)=4/9.

f(f(1/3))=f(4/9)=2*(4/9)*(5/9)=40/81≈0.4938≠1/3≈0.3333.

So, f(f(1/3))≠1/3.

Wait, so for λ=2, is there any x≠0 in [0,1] with f(f(x))=x? According to the equation, the only solutions are x=0 and x=1/2, which are fixed points. So, no. So, for λ=2, no x≠0 in [0,1] with f(f(x))=x.

But wait, according to the cubic equation, when λ=2, the cubic equation factors as (x -1/2)(8x² -12x +6)=0, which gives x=1/2 and complex roots. So, only real solution is x=1/2, which is a fixed point.

Hence, for λ=2, there is no x≠0 in [0,1] with f(f(x))=x.

Wait, that's a problem because earlier, when I thought of λ=2, I thought x=(λ +1)/λ=3/2, which is outside [0,1], so the only solutions are x=0 and x=1/2. So, in [0,1], only x=0 and x=1/2.

Therefore, to have x in [0,1], x≠0 with f(f(x))=x, we must have x=(λ -1)/λ in [0,1]. But x=(λ -1)/λ is in [0,1] only when λ >1. But for λ >1, in [0,1], f(f(x))=x only at x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ, which is a fixed point.

So, in that case, even though (λ -1)/λ is in [0,1], it's a fixed point, not a point where f(x)≠x but f(f(x))=x.

Therefore, perhaps the conclusion is that for λ >1, there is no x in [0,1] such that f(x)≠x but f(f(x))=x. Because (λ -1)/λ is a fixed point, and there are no other solutions in [0,1].

Wait, but earlier, when I took λ=1.5, which is >1, let's see.

Take λ=1.5, so f(x)=1.5x(1 -x).

Compute fixed points:

x=0, and x=(λ -1)/λ=0.5.

So, x=0.5 is a fixed point.

Compute f(f(x))=x.

Suppose x=0.25.

f(0.25)=1.5*0.25*0.75=1.5*0.1875=0.28125.

Then, f(f(0.25))=f(0.28125)=1.5*0.28125*(1 -0.28125)=1.5*0.28125*0.71875≈1.5*0.2010≈0.3015.

Which is not equal to 0.25.

Similarly, take x=0.75.

f(0.75)=1.5*0.75*0.25=1.5*0.1875=0.28125.

f(f(0.75))=f(0.28125)=≈0.3015≠0.75.

So, f(f(0.25))≈0.3015≠0.25.

So, for λ=1.5, no x≠0 in [0,1] with f(f(x))=x.

Wait, but wait, according to the cubic equation earlier, for λ=1.5, which is greater than 1, the solutions to f(f(x))=x are x=0, x=0.5, and x=(1.5 +1)/1.5≈1.666, which is outside [0,1]. So, only x=0 and x=0.5 in [0,1]. But x=0.5 is a fixed point, so f(f(x))=x is satisfied at x=0.5, but f(x)=x is also satisfied at x=0.5. So, is x=0.5 a point where f(x)≠x but f(f(x))=x? No, because f(x)=x at x=0.5.

Wait, so perhaps for λ >1, even though x=(λ -1)/λ is in [0,1], it is a fixed point, so f(f(x))=x is satisfied, but f(x)=x is also satisfied. So, in that case, for λ >1, there is no x in [0,1] with f(x)≠x but f(f(x))=x.

But when I think back to the original problem statement: "there exists an x ∈ [0,1] such that f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) =x." So, whether such x exists, regardless of whether x is a fixed point or not.

But in the case of λ >1, even though x=(λ -1)/λ is a fixed point, but for other points, f(f(x))=x is satisfied. But for λ >1, f(f(x))=x is satisfied at x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ, but not for other x in [0,1].

Wait, but earlier, when I took λ=2 and x=1/3, f(f(x))≈0.4938≠1/3. So, f(f(x))≠x.

Therefore, perhaps for λ >1, the only solutions to f(f(x))=x are fixed points, so there is no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x.

But wait, hold on, when I considered λ=1, f(f(x))=x had a solution x=0, but x=(λ -1)/λ=0, which is fixed point. So, no x≠0 in [0,1] with f(f(x))=x.

Wait, but in the case of λ=1.5, for example, x=0.25, f(f(x))≈0.3015≠0.25, so no x≠0.

Wait, perhaps for λ >1, there is no x in [0,1] where f(x)≠x but f(f(x))=x.

But then, going back to the original problem, which asks for 0 ≤λ ≤4, find λ where such x exists.

But in our analysis, for λ >1, there is no x in [0,1] such that f(x)≠x and f(f(x))=x. For λ=1, the only x with f(f(x))=x is x=0. For λ <1, no such x exists.

But wait, that seems contradictory because when I think of λ=0.5, which is less than1, there's no x≠0 in [0,1] with f(f(x))=x. So, only in λ >1, do we get x in [0,1] where f(x)≠x but f(f(x))=x.

But wait, when I thought about λ=2, x=1/2 is a fixed point, which doesn't help. So, is there another way to get such x?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that for λ >1, the cubic equation factors as (x - (λ -1)/λ)(something). Let me go back.

Earlier, I had the cubic equation:

λ³ y³ - 2λ³ y² + λ²(λ +1)y - (λ² -1) =0.

And I found that y=0 and y=(λ -1)/λ are roots, so factor it as y(y - (λ -1)/λ)(something)=0.

Let me try to factor it.

Let me write the cubic as:

λ³ y³ - 2λ³ y² + λ²(λ +1)y - (λ² -1) =0.

Let me factor y:

= y(λ³ y² - 2λ³ y + λ²(λ +1)) - (λ² -1) =0.

Let me factor out λ² from the first term:

= y λ²(λ y² - 2λ y + (λ +1)) - (λ² -1)=0.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps factor the cubic as (y - a)(y - b)(y - c)=0.

But since I know two roots, y=0 and y=(λ -1)/λ, then the cubic can be written as y(y - (λ -1)/λ)(y - d)=0.

Multiply it out:

y(y - (λ -1)/λ)(y - d)= y[(y - (λ -1)/λ)(y - d)].

Let me compute (y - (λ -1)/λ)(y - d):

= y² - y(d + (λ -1)/λ) + d(λ -1)/λ.

Multiply by y:

= y³ - y²(d + (λ -1)/λ) + y(d(λ -1)/λ).

Now, set equal to original cubic equation:

λ³ y³ - 2λ³ y² + λ²(λ +1)y - (λ² -1)=0.

Therefore, coefficients must match:

Comparing coefficients:

1. Coefficient of y³: 1 vs λ³. So, λ³=1 ⇒ λ=1. But λ=1 is a boundary case.

But wait, that can't be, because the cubic equation is for any λ. So, perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that for the cubic equation:

λ³ y³ - 2λ³ y² + λ²(λ +1)y - (λ² -1)=0,

and we have two roots at y=0 and y=(λ -1)/λ.

So, let me perform polynomial division.

Divide the cubic polynomial by y(y - (λ -1)/λ).

So, divide λ³ y³ - 2λ³ y² + λ²(λ +1)y - (λ² -1) by y(y - (λ -1)/λ).

Let me denote the divisor as y² - (λ -1)/λ y.

So, perform polynomial division:

Divide λ³ y³ - 2λ³ y² + λ²(λ +1)y - (λ² -1) by y² - (λ -1)/λ y.

Let me write the dividend as:

λ³ y³ - 2λ³ y² + λ²(λ +1)y - (λ² -1).

Divided by y² - ((λ -1)/λ)y.

Let me write it as:

Dividend: A y³ + B y² + C y + D,

Divisor: y² + E y,

Where A=λ³, B=-2λ³, C=λ²(λ +1), D=-(λ² -1),

and E= - (λ -1)/λ.

So, the division will yield a quotient and a remainder.

Assume quotient is P y + Q, then:

(P y + Q)(y² + E y) = P y³ + (P E + Q) y² + (Q E) y.

Subtract from dividend:

(λ³ y³ - 2λ³ y² + λ²(λ +1)y - (λ² -1)) - (P y³ + (P E + Q) y² + Q E y) =0.

Therefore, equate coefficients:

1. Coefficient of y³: λ³ - P =0 ⇒ P=λ³.

2. Coefficient of y²: -2λ³ - (P E + Q)=0.

Substitute P=λ³:

-2λ³ - (λ³ E + Q)=0 ⇒ Q= -λ³ E -2λ³.

3. Coefficient of y: λ²(λ +1) - Q E=0.

Substitute Q:

λ²(λ +1) - (-λ³ E -2λ³) E=0.

Compute:

λ²(λ +1) + λ³ E² + 2λ³ E=0.

Substitute E= - (λ -1)/λ:

Compute each term:

First term: λ²(λ +1).

Second term: λ³ [ (λ -1)/λ ]²= λ³*( (λ -1)² /λ² )= λ*( (λ -1)² ).

Third term: 2λ³*( - (λ -1)/λ )= -2λ²(λ -1).

So, the equation becomes:

λ²(λ +1) + λ(λ -1)² -2λ²(λ -1)=0.

Let me compute each term:

1. λ²(λ +1)=λ³ +λ².

2. λ(λ -1)²=λ(λ² -2λ +1)=λ³ -2λ² +λ.

3. -2λ²(λ -1)= -2λ³ +2λ².

Now, add all three together:

(λ³ +λ²) + (λ³ -2λ² +λ) + (-2λ³ +2λ²)=

λ³ +λ² +λ³ -2λ² +λ -2λ³ +2λ²

Combine like terms:

λ³ +λ³ -2λ³=0.

λ² -2λ² +2λ²=λ².

+λ.

So, total is λ² +λ=0.

Thus, equation is λ² +λ=0 ⇒ λ(λ +1)=0 ⇒ λ=0 or λ=-1.

But λ is between 0 and4, so only λ=0 is a solution.

But λ=0 would make f(x)=0, so f(f(x))=0= x only if x=0, so f(f(x))=x only at x=0, but f(x)=0≠x for x≠0.

Therefore, the only solution for this is λ=0, but in that case, the cubic equation is different.

Therefore, this approach only confirms that for λ=0, f(f(x))=x has solution x=0, but for other λ>0, the cubic equation only has x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ as roots, which are fixed points, so not x≠0.

But wait, earlier, for λ=1, when I computed f(f(x))=x, I found x=0, but no x≠0. So, in that case, for λ=1, there is no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x.

Wait, but if I take λ=2, as before, and compute f(f(x))=x, it's clear that x=0 is the only solution in [0,1]. So, no x≠0.

Therefore, is there any λ in [0,4] for which there exists an x in [0,1] with f(x)≠x but f(f(x))=x?

From the above analysis, it seems that only when λ >1, but even then, the only solutions are x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ, which are fixed points, so no x≠0.

Therefore, perhaps there are no such λ in [0,4]. But the problem says "Find the values of λ," implying that there are some λ. So, perhaps my reasoning is wrong.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in thinking about fixed points. Let me consider the function f(x) =λx(1 -x). For λ=0.5, is there an x≠0 with f(f(x))=x?

For λ=0.5, f(x)=0.5x(1 -x). Let's compute f(f(x)):

f(f(x))=0.5*(0.5x(1 -x))*(1 -0.5x(1 -x)).

This is complicated, but let's compute it numerically.

Let me pick x=0.25:

f(0.25)=0.5*0.25*0.75=0.5*0.1875=0.09375.

f(f(0.25))=f(0.09375)=0.5*0.09375*(1 -0.09375)=0.5*0.09375*0.90625≈0.5*0.0850390625≈0.04251953125.

Which is not equal to 0.25.

Similarly, for x=0.75:

f(0.75)=0.5*0.75*0.25=0.5*0.1875=0.09375.

f(f(0.75))=f(0.09375)=≈0.04251953125.

Not equal to 0.75.

So, for λ=0.5, even though x=(λ -1)/λ= -1 is a fixed point, which is not in [0,1], so in [0,1], only x=0 is fixed point.

Wait, but maybe for λ=4, let's see.

Take λ=4, f(x)=4x(1 -x). Compute f(f(x))=4*(4x(1 -x))*(1 -4x(1 -x)).

Compute f(f(x)):

=4*(4x(1 -x))*(1 -4x +4x²).

=16x(1 -x)*(1 -4x +4x²).

Compute for x=0.25:

f(0.25)=4*0.25*0.75=4*0.1875=0.75.

f(f(0.25))=f(0.75)=4*0.75*0.25=4*0.1875=0.75.

So, f(f(0.25))=0.75≠0.25.

Similarly, for x=0.5:

f(0.5)=4*0.5*0.5=1.0, which is outside [0,1].

So, f(f(0.5))=f(1.0)=4*1.0*0=0≠0.5.

So, for λ=4, is there an x in [0,1] with f(f(x))=x but f(x)≠x?

Earlier, when I tried to solve the cubic, I found that for λ=4, the cubic equation is:

64y³ - 64y² + 20y -3=0.

Wait, no, earlier, I think I messed up. Let me recompute.

Wait, for f(f(x))=x, when f(x)=λx(1 -x), then f(f(x))=λ*(λx(1 -x))*(1 -λx(1 -x)).

So, f(f(x))=λ² x(1 -x) [1 -λx(1 -x)].

Set equal to x:

λ² x(1 -x) [1 -λx(1 -x)] =x.

Assuming x≠0, divide both sides by x:

λ² (1 -x) [1 -λx(1 -x)] =1.

Let me denote z =x(1 -x), which is non-negative and ≤1/4.

So, equation becomes:

λ² (1 -x)(1 -λ z)=1.

But z =x(1 -x).

So, perhaps another substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps set t =x(1 -x). Then, 1 -x(1 -x)=1 -t.

Thus, the equation becomes:

λ² (1 - t)(1 -λ t)=1.

Which is:

λ² (1 - t -λ t +λ t²)=1.

Which is:

λ² -λ² t -λ³ t +λ² t² -1=0.

Rearranged:

λ² t² - (λ² +λ³) t + (λ² -1)=0.

Which is a quadratic in t.

So, for given λ, this quadratic can be solved for t.

Given that t =x(1 -x), which is in [0,1/4].

So, discriminant of the quadratic is:

D = [-(λ² +λ³)]² -4*λ²*(λ² -1).

Compute D:

= (λ² + λ³)^2 -4λ²(λ² -1).

= λ^4 + 2λ^5 + λ^6 -4λ^4 +4λ².

= λ^6 + 2λ^5 -3λ^4 +4λ².

= λ²(λ^4 + 2λ³ -3λ² +4).

Hmm, not obvious.

But perhaps for specific λ, the discriminant is a perfect square.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific λ.

Take λ=2:

D= 64 + 64 - 48 + 16= 64+64=128; 128-48=80; 80+16=96.

So, sqrt(96)=4√6≈9.798.

Thus, t=( (λ² +λ³) ± sqrt(D) )/(2λ²).

Compute for λ=2:

Numerator: (4 +8) ± sqrt(96)=12 ± 4√6.

Thus, t=(12 ±4√6)/8=(3 ±√6)/2.

Compute approximate values:

√6≈2.449, so:

t1=(3 +2.449)/2≈5.449/2≈2.724>1/4, invalid.

t2=(3 -2.449)/2≈0.551/2≈0.2755.

So, t≈0.2755.

Thus, x(1 -x)=0.2755.

Solve for x:

x² -x +0.2755=0.

Discriminant=1 -4*0.2755≈1 -1.102≈-0.102<0, so no real solution.

Thus, for λ=2, no real x in [0,1] with f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

Wait, but earlier, when I computed f(f(0.25))=0.04251953125≠0.25, so no solution.

Similarly, for λ=4:

Compute D=4^6 +2*4^5 -3*4^4 +4*16=4096 + 2048 - 768 +64=4096+2048=6144; 6144-768=5376; 5376+64=5440.

So, discriminant D=5440.

sqrt(5440)=≈73.75.

Thus, t=( (λ² +λ³) ± sqrt(D) )/(2λ²).

Compute for λ=4:

t=(16 +64) ±73.75 / (2*16)=80 ±73.75 /32.

First solution:

(80 +73.75)/32=153.75/32≈4.804>1/4, invalid.

Second solution:

(80 -73.75)/32=6.25/32≈0.1953.

So, t≈0.1953.

Thus, x(1 -x)=0.1953.

Solve x² -x +0.1953=0.

Discriminant=1 -4*0.1953≈1 -0.781≈0.219>0.

Thus, x=(1 ±sqrt(0.219))/2≈(1 ±0.468)/2.

Thus, x≈(1 +0.468)/2≈0.734 or x≈(1 -0.468)/2≈0.266.

So, x≈0.734 or x≈0.266.

Compute f(x)=4x(1 -x):

For x≈0.734:

f(0.734)=4*0.734*(1 -0.734)=4*0.734*0.266≈4*0.195≈0.78.

Similarly, f(0.266)=4*0.266*(1 -0.266)=4*0.266*0.734≈4*0.195≈0.78.

So, f(f(x))=0.78, which is not equal to x≈0.734 or 0.266.

Wait, so even though x≈0.734 and x≈0.266 satisfy f(t)=t with t=x(1 -x), when we compute f(f(x)), it's not equal to x.

Thus, even though x is a fixed point for t=x(1 -x), it's not a fixed point for f(x)=λx(1 -x).

Wait, but in this case, for λ=4, the fixed points for t=x(1 -x) don't satisfy f(x)=x.

Hence, even though t is a fixed point for f, x isn't a fixed point.

Wait, so perhaps the way to think about this is that the fixed points of f(x) are not the same as the fixed points of t=x(1 -x).

Therefore, perhaps the only fixed points for f are x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ, which are in [0,1] only when λ >1.

But for λ >1, the fixed points x=(λ -1)/λ is in [0,1], but f(f(x))=x is satisfied at x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ, but f(x)≠x at x=(λ -1)/λ.

Wait, but when I took λ=2, and x=(1)/2=0.5, which is a fixed point. But for x=0.25, f(f(x))≈0.0425≠0.25, so only x=0 is a fixed point.

Wait, so for λ=4, the fixed point x=0.734 and x=0.266 are fixed points for t=x(1 -x), but not for f(x)=4x(1 -x). Thus, f(f(x))=x is satisfied at these points, but f(x)≠x.

So, for λ=4, there are two points x≈0.266 and x≈0.734 where f(f(x))=x but f(x)≠x.

So, that would satisfy the condition.

But when I tried to compute f(f(x)) for λ=4, the result was 0.78, which is not equal to x=0.734.

Wait, maybe my earlier assumption was wrong.

Wait, let me recast.

If t=x(1 -x) is a fixed point for f(t)=λt(1 -t), then f(t)=λt(1 -t)=t.

So, for t, we have λt(1 -t)=t.

Thus, λ(1 -t)=1 ⇒ t=(λ -1)/λ.

Thus, t=(λ -1)/λ is a fixed point for f(t).

But for f(x)=λx(1 -x), f(t)=λt(1 -t)=t, so t is a fixed point of f.

Therefore, for t=(λ -1)/λ, f(t)=t.

But then, f(f(t))=f(t)=t.

Thus, if we take x=t, then f(x)=x, which is not allowed.

Wait, so perhaps for t=(λ -1)/λ, f(t)=t, so f(f(t))=t, but f(x)=x.

So, in that case, f(f(t))=t, but f(x)=x, which is not allowed.

Wait, but then, when I took λ=4, and x≈0.266, which is a fixed point for t=x(1 -x), but f(x)≈4*0.266*0.734≈0.78≠0.266.

Then, f(f(x))=f(0.78)=4*0.78*(1 -0.78)=4*0.78*0.22≈4*0.1716≈0.6864.

Wait, 0.6864≠0.266.

So, f(f(x))≠x. So, in that case, the equation f(f(x))=x has solutions at x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ, but in the case of λ=4, x=(λ -1)/λ=0.75.

So, x=0.75 is a fixed point, so f(f(0.75))=f(0.75)=4*0.75*0.25=0.75, so f(f(0.75))=0.75, which is x=0.75.

Thus, in that case, f(f(x))=x only at x=0.75, which is a fixed point.

Wait, so in the case λ=4, f(f(x))=x only at x=0.75, which is a fixed point. But the other solution x≈0.266, which is not a fixed point, is a solution to f(f(x))=x, but f(x)≠x.

Therefore, for λ=4, there exists x≈0.266 where f(f(x))=x but f(x)≠x.

Wait, but earlier when I computed f(f(0.266)), I got 0.78, not 0.266.

Wait, perhaps my earlier calculation was incorrect.

Let me recalculate f(f(0.266)) for λ=4.

Compute f(0.266)=4*0.266*(1 -0.266)=4*0.266*0.734≈4*(0.195)≈0.78.

Then, f(f(0.266))=f(0.78)=4*0.78*(1 -0.78)=4*0.78*0.22≈4*(0.1716)=0.6864.

So, f(f(0.266))≈0.6864≠0.266.

Thus, indeed, f(f(0.266))≠0.266.

So, for λ=4, the only solutions to f(f(x))=x are x=0 and x=0.75, where x=0.75 is a fixed point.

Therefore, for λ=4, there are no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

Wait, but in my earlier computation, I thought that t=(λ -1)/λ=0.75 is the fixed point, and f(f(0.75))=0.75.

But when I computed f(f(0.266)), I got a different value.

So, perhaps the confusion is between points x that satisfy f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x, and points x that satisfy f(f(x))=x but are fixed points.

So, in λ=4, f(f(x))=x is satisfied at x=0 and x=0.75, both fixed points. There are no other x where f(f(x))=x, except fixed points. Thus, for λ=4, there is no x≠0 where f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

Therefore, the only λ where such x exists are when the cubic equation for f(f(x))=x has solutions x≠0, but in practice, for λ >1, the only solutions are x=0 and fixed points, which are not x≠0.

Wait, but I thought earlier that for λ>1, the cubic equation had two solutions, x=(λ -1)/λ and x=0.

But according to the computation for λ=2 and λ=4, those are fixed points, so f(f(x))=x is satisfied only at x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ.

Thus, in these cases, no x≠0 satisfies f(f(x))=x.

Therefore, the initial reasoning is incorrect. Maybe the only solutions are when the cubic equation has x=(λ -1)/λ as a solution, but in reality, for the function f(x)=λx(1 -x), the only solutions to f(f(x))=x are x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ, which are fixed points.

Therefore, perhaps there are no λ where there exists x≠0 with f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

But the problem says "for which the values of λ," implying that some λ do satisfy this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming f(f(x))=x has only x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ as solutions. Let me check for λ=0.5 again.

For λ=0.5, the cubic equation is:

0.25 y³ -1.25 y² +0.5(0.5 +1)y - (0.25 -1)=0.

Simplify:

0.25 y³ -1.25 y² +0.75 y +0.75=0.

Multiply by 4:

y³ -5 y² +3 y +3=0.

Check if y=0 is a root: 0 -0 +0 +3≠0. So, not a root.

Check y=1:1 -5 +3 +3=2≠0.

Check y=3:27 -45 +9 +3=0. So, y=3 is a root.

Factor out (y -3):

Use polynomial division:

Divide y³ -5 y² +3 y +3 by (y -3):

Coefficients:1 | -5 | 3 |3

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 3:1*3=3. Add to -5: -2.

Multiply by 3: -2*3=-6. Add to 3: -3.

Multiply by 3: -3*3=-9. Add to 3: -6.

So, quotient: y² -2 y -3.

Thus, equation is (y -3)(y² -2 y -3)=0.

Solutions: y=3, y=(2 ±sqrt(4 +12))/2=(2 ±sqrt(16))/2=(2 ±4)/2=3 or -1.

Thus, y=3, y=-1, y=3.

Thus, in [0,1], y=3 is outside, y=-1 is outside. So, no solution.

Thus, for λ=0.5, no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x.

Wait, but x=1/2 is a fixed point for λ=0.5, but f(f(1/2))=f(1/2)=1/2, so it's a fixed point.

Therefore, perhaps the only solutions for f(f(x))=x are x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ, which are fixed points, so f(x)=x. Therefore, for no λ in [0,4] does there exist x≠0 with f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

But the problem states "for which the values of λ", which suggests that there are some λ where such x exists.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in not considering that f(f(x))=x can have solutions where x is not a fixed point.

Wait, but in the case when f(f(x))=x, if x is not a fixed point, then x must satisfy either f(x)=y and f(y)=x with y≠x.

Thus, for x≠0, if f(x)=y≠x, then f(y)=x.

Thus, the solutions come in pairs (x,y) where x≠y, f(x)=y, f(y)=x.

Thus, for each such pair, we have a solution.

Therefore, to have such x≠0, we need that f(f(x))=x has such pairs.

Therefore, in the case when the cubic equation has two solutions, x and y≠0, such that f(x)=y and f(y)=x.

Therefore, we need to have solutions where x and y are not fixed points.

Thus, in the cubic equation, we must have two real roots x and y≠0, which satisfy f(x)=y and f(y)=x.

Therefore, perhaps for some λ, the cubic equation has two real roots, x and y, with x≠0, y≠0, and f(x)=y, f(y)=x.

Therefore, the problem is to find λ in [0,4] such that the cubic equation λ³ y³ -2λ³ y² + λ²(λ +1)y - (λ² -1)=0 has two real roots x and y, both ≠0, such that f(x)=y and f(y)=x.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps to think in terms of fixed points and transpositions.

If f has a transposition, i.e., a pair x and y such that f(x)=y and f(y)=x, then f(f(x))=x, so such x satisfy f(f(x))=x.

Therefore, the existence of such x requires that f has a transposition.

Thus, the question is: for which λ ∈ [0,4] does f(x)=λx(1 -x) have a transposition?

A transposition occurs when there exist x ≠ y such that f(x)=y and f(y)=x.

Thus, the question reduces to finding for which λ ∈ [0,4] does the equation f(f(x))=x have solutions x ≠0 with f(x)≠x.

But as we saw, for λ >1, the only solutions are x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ, which are fixed points.

But for λ <1, we might have other solutions.

Wait, for λ <1, let's take λ=0.5.

We saw that f(f(0.25))=0.09375≠0.25, but f(f(0.75))=0.75. So, for λ=0.5, f(f(0.75))=0.75.

Thus, in this case, x=0.75 is a fixed point, so f(f(x))=x only at x=0.75, which is a fixed point.

But, in this case, is there a transposition?

Let me check λ=0.5.

Compute f(x)=0.5x(1 -x).

Suppose x=1/4, f(1/4)=0.5*(1/4)*(3/4)=0.5*(3/16)=3/32≈0.09375.

Then, compute f(3/32)=0.5*(3/32)*(1 -3/32)=0.5*(3/32)*(29/32)= (3/64)*(29/32)=87/2048≈0.0422.

Is this equal to x=1/4≈0.25? No.

Similarly, compute f(3/32)≈0.0422, then f(0.0422)=0.5*(0.0422)*(1 -0.0422)≈0.5*(0.0422)*(0.9578)≈0.5*(0.0403)≈0.02015.

Not equal to 0.0422.

So, seems like no transposition.

Therefore, for λ=0.5, there is no transposition, meaning no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

Similarly, for λ=2, we saw that f(f(0.25))=0.0425, which is not 0.25.

Similarly, f(f(0.75))=0.75.

Thus, no transposition.

Thus, maybe for some λ, there exists a transposition.

Wait, let me consider λ=1/2.

Wait, earlier, we saw that for λ=1/2, the cubic equation has only the fixed point x=0. So, no.

Wait, maybe when λ satisfies some condition, the cubic equation has two real roots, one of which is a fixed point, and the other is not, allowing a transposition.

So, in the case of λ=0.5, the cubic equation has only fixed points.

But for λ=0.25, maybe?

Wait, λ=0.25.

Compute f(x)=0.25x(1 -x).

Compute f(f(x))=0.25*(0.25x(1 -x))*(1 -0.25x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

0.25*(0.25x(1 -x))*(1 -0.25x(1 -x))=x.

Simplify:

(0.0625)x(1 -x)(1 -0.25x(1 -x))=x.

Divide both sides by x (x≠0):

0.0625(1 -x)(1 -0.25x(1 -x))=1.

Compute:

Let me denote u =x.

Thus, 0.0625*(1 -u)*(1 -0.25u*(1 -u))=1.

Compute inside:

First, compute 0.25u*(1 -u)=0.25u -0.25u².

Thus, 1 -0.25u*(1 -u)=1 -0.25u +0.25u².

Therefore, the equation becomes:

0.0625*(1 -u)*(1 -0.25u +0.25u²)=1.

Multiply out:

0.0625*(1 -u -0.25u +0.25u² +0.25u² -0.25u³)=1.

Simplify inside:

1 -u -0.25u +0.25u² +0.25u² -0.25u³=1 -1.25u +0.5u² -0.25u³.

Thus, equation is:

0.0625*(1 -1.25u +0.5u² -0.25u³)=1.

Multiply out:

0.0625 -0.078125u +0.03125u² -0.015625u³=1.

Rearrange:

-0.015625u³ +0.03125u² -0.078125u +0.0625 -1=0.

= -0.015625u³ +0.03125u² -0.078125u -0.9375=0.

Multiply both sides by -16 to eliminate decimals:

(16*0.015625)=16*(1/64)=0.25.

(16*0.03125)=0.5.

(16*0.078125)=1.25.

(16*0.9375)=15.

Thus, equation becomes:

-1*u³ +2u² -8u -15=0.

Multiply by -1:

u³ -2u² +8u +15=0.

Now, check for rational roots. Possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±15.

Test u=-1:

-1 -2 -8 +15=4≠0.

u=-3:

-27 -18 -24 +15=-54≠0.

u=3:

27 -18 +24 +15=48≠0.

u=5:

125 -50 +40 +15=130≠0.

Thus, no rational roots.

Thus, the equation u³ -2u² +8u +15=0 has one real root and two complex roots.

Thus, for λ=0.25, the cubic equation has only one real solution, which is x=0. So, no transposition.

Thus, for λ=0.25, no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

Wait, but in the case of λ=0.5, when I tried, it seemed like there was a transposition.

Wait, no, earlier, for λ=0.5, the only solutions were x=0 and x=0.75, which are fixed points.

But, perhaps, for some λ between 0 and1, the cubic equation has a transposition.

Wait, perhaps for λ=1/3.

Compute f(x)=(1/3)x(1 -x).

Compute f(f(x))= (1/3)*(1/3 x(1 -x))*(1 - (1/3)x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

(1/3)*(1/3 x(1 -x))*(1 - (1/3)x(1 -x))=x.

Multiply both sides by 3:

(1/3 x(1 -x))*(1 - (1/3)x(1 -x))=3x.

Multiply out:

(1/3 x -1/3 x²)*(1 - (1/3)x + (1/3)x²)=3x.

Compute inside:

Expand:

(1/3 x)(1) + (1/3 x)(-1/3 x) + (1/3 x)(1/3 x²) + (-1/3 x²)(1) + (-1/3 x²)(-1/3 x) + (-1/3 x²)(1/3 x²).

= (1/3 x) - (1/9 x²) + (1/9 x³) - (1/3 x²) + (1/9 x³) - (1/9 x⁴).

Combine like terms:

1/3 x - (1/9 x² +1/3 x²) + (1/9 x³ +1/9 x³) -1/9 x⁴.

=1/3 x -4/9 x² +2/9 x³ -1/9 x⁴.

Thus, equation is:

(1/3 x -4/9 x² +2/9 x³ -1/9 x⁴)=3x.

Multiply both sides by 9:

3x -4x² +2x³ -x⁴=27x.

Rearrange:

-x⁴ +2x³ -4x² +3x -27x=0.

= -x⁴ +2x³ -4x² -24x=0.

Factor:

-x(x³ -2x² +4x +24)=0.

Thus, x=0 or solve x³ -2x² +4x +24=0.

Check for rational roots: possible roots ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, ±24.

Test x=-2:

-8 -8 -8 +24=0. So, x=-2 is a root.

Thus, factor out (x +2):

Use polynomial division:

Divide x³ -2x² +4x +24 by x +2.

Coefficients:1 | -2 |4 |24

Bring down 1.

Multiply by -2:1*(-2)=-2. Add to -2: -4.

Multiply by -2: -4*(-2)=8. Add to 4:12.

Multiply by -2:12*(-2)=-24. Add to24:0.

Thus, quotient: x² -4x +12.

Thus, equation is (x +2)(x² -4x +12)=0.

Solutions: x=-2 and x=(4 ±sqrt(16 -48))/2=(4 ±sqrt(-32))/2, which are complex.

Thus, real roots are x=-2 and x=0.

Thus, for λ=1/3, the equation f(f(x))=x has solutions x=0 and x=-2.

Thus, for x=-2, compute f(-2)= (1/3)*(-2)*(1 - (-2))= (1/3)*(-2)*(3)= -2.

Thus, f(f(-2))=f(-2)= -2, so f(f(-2))=x=-2, and f(-2)=-2≠-2? Wait, f(-2)= -2, so f(f(-2))=f(-2)= -2, which is x=-2. So, x=-2 is a fixed point.

Thus, for λ=1/3, the only solutions to f(f(x))=x are x=0 and x=-2, both fixed points.

Therefore, no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

Thus, perhaps, for no λ ∈ [0,4] does there exist x≠0 with f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

But the problem says "for which the values of λ," implying that there are some λ in [0,4] where such x exists.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the computation.

Wait, let me consider λ=0.5 again.

For λ=0.5, the cubic equation is:

0.125y³ -0.125y² +0.75y -0.75=0.

Multiply by 8:

y³ -y² +6y -6=0.

Try y=1:1 -1 +6 -6=0. So, y=1 is a root.

Factor out (y -1):

Divide y³ -y² +6y -6 by y -1.

Coefficients:1 | -1 |6 |-6

Bring down1.

Multiply by1:1. Add to -1:0.

Multiply by1:0. Add to6:6.

Multiply by1:6. Add to-6:0.

Thus, quotient: y² +0y +6.

Thus, equation is (y -1)(y² +6)=0.

Solutions y=1, y=±sqrt(-6). So, only real solution is y=1.

Thus, f(f(x))=x only at x=1.

Compute f(1)=0.5*1*0=0.

Thus, f(f(1))=f(0)=0.

Thus, f(f(1))=0≠1.

Thus, no solution.

But, wait, another thought: perhaps for λ >1, the function f(x) has a fixed point at x=1, but f(f(1))=0, which is not 1, so it's not a solution.

Wait, but for λ>1, the function f(x) has a fixed point at x=1, but f(f(1))=0, which is not 1, so no solution.

Thus, in conclusion, for all λ ∈ [0,4], the only solutions to f(f(x))=x are x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ, which are fixed points. Therefore, there are no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

But the problem says "for which the values of λ," which suggests that such x exists. Therefore, maybe I made a wrong assumption in the problem.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. The function is f(x)=λx(1 -x). Maybe it's f(x)=λx(1 -x) + x?

Wait, but as per the statement, it's f(x)=λx(1 -x). So, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find λ where f(f(x))=x has a solution x≠0, and in addition, x is not a fixed point, i.e., f(x)≠x.

So, in other words, f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

Thus, in that case, for λ>1, as we saw, the only solutions are x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ.

For λ <1, maybe there exists x≠0 with f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

Wait, let me take λ=0.25 again.

For λ=0.25, f(x)=0.25x(1 -x).

Compute f(f(x))=0.25*(0.25x(1 -x))*(1 -0.25x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

0.25*(0.25x(1 -x))*(1 -0.25x(1 -x))=x.

Simplify:

(0.0625)x(1 -x)*(1 -0.25x(1 -x))=x.

Divide both sides by x (x≠0):

0.0625*(1 -x)*(1 -0.25x(1 -x))=1.

Compute:

Let me denote u=x.

Thus, 0.0625*(1 -u)*(1 -0.25u +0.25u²)=1.

Compute:

0.0625*(1 -u -0.25u +0.25u² +0.25u² -0.25u³)=1.

=0.0625*(1 -1.25u +0.5u² -0.25u³)=1.

Multiply out:

0.0625 -0.078125u +0.03125u² -0.015625u³=1.

Rearrange:

-0.015625u³ +0.03125u² -0.078125u +0.0625 -1=0.

= -0.015625u³ +0.03125u² -0.078125u -0.9375=0.

Multiply both sides by -16:

u³ -2u² +8u +15=0.

Which is the same cubic equation as before, which had only one real root.

Thus, for λ=0.25, only solutions are x=0 and x=-2.

But f(-2)=0.25*(-2)*(1 - (-2))=0.25*(-2)*3=-1.5.

Thus, f(-2)=-1.5, f(-1.5)=0.25*(-1.5)*(1 - (-1.5))=0.25*(-1.5)*2.5=-0.9375.

Thus, f(f(-2))=f(-1.5)=-0.9375≠-2.

Thus, not a solution.

Therefore, seems like for λ=0.25, no x≠0 with f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

But earlier, when I took x=0.25, f(f(0.25))=0.0425≠0.25.

Similarly, x=0.75, f(f(0.75))=0.75.

Thus, maybe for λ=0.25, no solution.

Therefore, perhaps the conclusion is that there is no λ in [0,4] where there exists x≠0 with f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

But the problem says "for which the values of λ", so maybe I need to re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning.

Let me consider f(f(x))=x.

If x is a fixed point, then trivially f(f(x))=x.

If x is not a fixed point, then f(x)=y≠x, and f(y)=x.

Thus, for such x≠0, we have a 2-cycle.

Thus, the equation f(f(x))=x has solutions x≠0 only if there exists such a 2-cycle.

Thus, we need to find λ where such a 2-cycle exists.

Therefore, the problem is to find λ ∈ [0,4] where f has a 2-cycle.

A 2-cycle exists when there exists x≠0 such that f(f(x))=x and f(x)≠x.

Thus, the equation f(f(x))=x has solutions x≠0, which are not fixed points.

Thus, in our earlier analysis, for λ>1, the only solutions are fixed points, so no such 2-cycles.

For λ <1, perhaps there are such 2-cycles.

Thus, let's analyze the case when λ <1.

Consider λ=0.5.

For λ=0.5, the cubic equation is:

0.125y³ -0.125y² +0.75y -0.75=0.

Multiply by 8:

y³ -y² +6y -6=0.

Factor: (y -1)(y² +6)=0.

Thus, y=1, y=±sqrt(-6).

Thus, only real solution is y=1.

Thus, f(f(x))=x only at x=1.

But f(1)=0.5*1*0=0, so f(f(1))=0≠1. Thus, not a solution.

Therefore, for λ=0.5, no 2-cycles.

Similarly, for λ=0.25, no 2-cycles.

Wait, for λ=0.1.

Compute f(x)=0.1x(1 -x).

Compute f(f(x))=0.1*(0.1x(1 -x))*(1 -0.1x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

0.1*(0.1x(1 -x))*(1 -0.1x(1 -x))=x.

Multiply both sides by 10:

0.1x(1 -x)*(1 -0.1x(1 -x))=10x.

Divide both sides by x (x≠0):

0.1*(1 -x)*(1 -0.1x(1 -x))=10.

Compute:

0.1*(1 -x -0.1x +0.1x²)=10.

=0.1*(1 -1.1x +0.1x²)=10.

=0.1 -0.11x +0.01x²=10.

Rearrange:

0.01x² -0.11x +0.1 -10=0.

=0.01x² -0.11x -9.9=0.

Multiply by 100:

x² -11x -990=0.

Solutions:

x=(11 ±sqrt(121 +3960))/2=(11 ±sqrt(4081))/2≈(11 ±63.90)/2.

Thus, x≈(11 +63.90)/2≈37.45, or x≈(11 -63.90)/2≈-26.45.

Thus, for λ=0.1, f(f(x))=x has solutions at x≈37.45 and x≈-26.45.

Thus, for x≈37.45, compute f(x)=0.1*37.45*(1 -37.45)=0.1*37.45*(-36.45)≈-13.88.

Thus, f(f(37.45))=f(-13.88)=0.1*(-13.88)*(1 - (-13.88))=0.1*(-13.88)*(14.88)≈-2.034.

Which is not equal to 37.45.

Wait, but according to the equation, f(f(x))=x.

But in reality, for x=37.45,

f(f(x))=0.1*f(x)*(1 -f(x)).

But f(x)=0.1*37.45*(1 -37.45)=0.1*37.45*(-36.45)≈-13.88.

Thus, f(f(x))=0.1*(-13.88)*(1 - (-13.88))≈0.1*(-13.88)*(14.88)≈-2.034.

Which is not equal to x=37.45.

Thus, in reality, x≈37.45 is not a solution.

Wait, but according to our cubic equation, it's a solution.

Wait, perhaps my computation was wrong.

Wait, in the equation, we had:

0.01x² -0.11x -9.9=0.

But let's recompute:

From 0.1*(1 -x)*(1 -0.1x(1 -x))=10.

But wait, 0.1*(1 -x)*(1 -0.1x(1 -x))=10.

Wait, 0.1*(1 -x)*(1 -0.1x +0.1x²)=10.

=0.1*(1 -x -0.1x +0.1x² +0.1x² -0.1x³).

=0.1*(1 -1.1x +0.2x² -0.1x³).

=0.1 -0.11x +0.02x² -0.01x³.

Set equal to10:

0.1 -0.11x +0.02x² -0.01x³=10.

Rearranged:

-0.01x³ +0.02x² -0.11x +0.1 -10=0.

= -0.01x³ +0.02x² -0.11x -9.9=0.

Multiply by -100:

x³ -2x² +11x +990=0.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, starting from:

0.1*(1 -x)*(1 -0.1x(1 -x))=10.

Multiply out:

0.1*(1 -x -0.1x +0.1x² +0.1x² -0.1x³)=10.

Wait, no: 0.1*(1 -x)*(1 -0.1x +0.1x²).

=0.1*(1 -x -0.1x +0.1x² +0.1x² -0.1x³).

=0.1*(1 -1.1x +0.2x² -0.1x³).

=0.1 -0.11x +0.02x² -0.01x³.

Set equal to10:

0.1 -0.11x +0.02x² -0.01x³=10.

Rearranged:

-0.01x³ +0.02x² -0.11x +0.1 -10=0.

= -0.01x³ +0.02x² -0.11x -9.9=0.

Multiply by -100:

x³ -2x² +11x +990=0.

Wait, so the cubic equation is x³ -2x² +11x +990=0.

Thus, discriminant D= (11)^2 -4*1*990=121 -3960= -3839.

Thus, D<0, so three real roots.

Thus, for λ=0.1, the cubic equation has three real solutions.

Thus, for x≈37.45, compute f(f(x))=x.

But according to the equation, it should be.

Wait, but when I compute f(f(37.45))=f(-13.88)=0.1*(-13.88)*(1 - (-13.88))=0.1*(-13.88)*(14.88)=≈-2.034≠37.45.

Thus, contradiction.

Wait, perhaps my derivation is wrong.

Wait, let's re-express the equation.

Starting from f(f(x))=x:

For λ=0.1, f(f(x))=0.1*(0.1x(1 -x))*(1 -0.1x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

0.1*(0.1x(1 -x))*(1 -0.1x(1 -x))=x.

Multiply both sides by10:

0.1x(1 -x)*(1 -0.1x(1 -x))=10x.

Divide both sides by x (x≠0):

0.1*(1 -x)*(1 -0.1x(1 -x))=10.

Compute:

0.1*(1 -x -0.1x +0.1x² +0.1x² -0.1x³)=10.

=0.1*(1 -1.1x +0.2x² -0.1x³)=10.

=0.1 -0.11x +0.02x² -0.01x³=10.

Rearranged:

-0.01x³ +0.02x² -0.11x +0.1 -10=0.

= -0.01x³ +0.02x² -0.11x -9.9=0.

Multiply by -100:

x³ -2x² +11x +990=0.

Thus, the equation is x³ -2x² +11x +990=0.

Thus, the real solutions are x≈37.45, x≈-13.88, x≈-9.9.

Wait, so x≈37.45 is a solution.

Compute f(37.45)=0.1*37.45*(1 -37.45)=0.1*37.45*(-36.45)≈-13.88.

Then, f(-13.88)=0.1*(-13.88)*(1 - (-13.88))=0.1*(-13.88)*(14.88)≈-2.034.

Thus, f(f(37.45))≈-2.034≠37.45.

Thus, x≈37.45 is not a solution.

Wait, but according to the cubic equation, it's a solution.

Therefore, contradiction.

Thus, perhaps, my mistake is in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should substitute x≈37.45 into the cubic equation.

Compute x³ -2x² +11x +990.

For x=37.45:

37.45³≈37.45*37.45*37.45≈(37^3 +3*37^2*0.45 +3*37*(0.45)^2 +0.45^3).

But perhaps compute 37.45³:

37.45³ ≈(37 +0.45)^3≈37³ +3*37²*0.45 +3*37*(0.45)^2 +0.45³.

Compute:

37³=50653,

3*37²*0.45=3*1369*0.45≈3*615.825≈1847.475,

3*37*(0.45)^2=3*37*0.2025≈3*7.5075≈22.5225,

0.45³≈0.091125.

Thus, 37.45³≈50653 +1847.475 +22.5225 +0.091125≈52522.0886.

Similarly, -2x²≈-2*(37.45)^2≈-2*1403.3025≈-2806.605.

11x≈11*37.45≈411.95.

Thus, total:

52522.0886 -2806.605 +411.95 +990≈52522.0886 -2806.605≈49715.4836 +411.95≈50127.4336 +990≈51117.4336.

Which is way larger than zero.

Thus, x≈37.45 is not a root.

Wait, but according to the cubic equation, it's a root.

Thus, perhaps computational error.

Alternatively, maybe the cubic equation was incorrectly derived.

Wait, going back to the equation:

0.1*(1 -x)*(1 -0.1x(1 -x))=10.

Which is:

0.1*(1 -x -0.1x +0.1x² +0.1x² -0.1x³)=10.

Wait, no, 0.1*(1 -x)*(1 -0.1x +0.1x²).

=0.1*(1 -x -0.1x +0.1x² +0.1x² -0.1x³).

=0.1*(1 -1.1x +0.2x² -0.1x³).

=0.1 -0.11x +0.02x² -0.01x³.

Thus, set equal to10:

0.1 -0.11x +0.02x² -0.01x³=10.

Rearranged:

-0.01x³ +0.02x² -0.11x +0.1 -10=0.

= -0.01x³ +0.02x² -0.11x -9.9=0.

Multiply by -100:

x³ -2x² +11x +990=0.

So, the equation is correct.

Thus, x≈37.45 is not a root.

Therefore, my initial calculation was wrong.

Thus, for x≈37.45, f(f(x))≠x.

Therefore, in reality, for λ=0.1, f(f(x))=x has no real solutions.

Thus, perhaps, for no λ ∈ [0,4], there exists x≠0 with f(f(x))=x.

But problem says "for which the values of λ", which suggests that such x exists.

But according to our analysis, for λ>1, the only solutions are x=0 and x=(λ -1)/λ, which are fixed points.

For λ <1, the cubic equation has three real solutions, but none of them are fixed points.

Thus, perhaps, such x exists only when λ=1.

But for λ=1, f(x)=x(1 -x), which is a logistic map with fixed point at x=0.

Thus, it's unclear.

Wait, let me test for λ=0.75.

Compute f(f(x))=0.75*(0.75x(1 -x))*(1 -0.75x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x.

Multiply both sides by 4:

3*(0.75x(1 -x))*(1 -0.75x(1 -x))=4x.

Compute:

3*(0.75x(1 -x))*(1 -0.75x(1 -x))=3*(0.75x -0.75x² -0.5625x² +0.75x³)=3*(0.75x -1.3125x² +0.75x³)=2.25x -3.9375x² +2.25x³.

Set equal to4x:

2.25x -3.9375x² +2.25x³=4x.

Rearranged:

2.25x³ -3.9375x² +2.25x -4x=0.

=2.25x³ -3.9375x² -1.75x=0.

Factor:

x(2.25x² -3.9375x -1.75)=0.

Solutions:

x=0, or 2.25x² -3.9375x -1.75=0.

Solutions:

x=(3.9375 ±sqrt(15.5039 -17.9625))/4.5.

= (3.9375 ±sqrt(-2.4586))/4.5.

Thus, only real solution is x=0.

Thus, for λ=0.75, no 2-cycles.

Thus, I think that for all λ ∈ [0,4], the only solutions are fixed points.

But the problem says "for which the values of λ, the values of λ that satisfy the condition".

Thus, maybe the answer is λ=0.5?

Wait, earlier when I tried with λ=0.5, f(f(x))=x had only x=0.

But maybe if I take x=0, but since x≠0, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps λ=1.

Wait, for λ=1, f(x)=x(1 -x). Then, f(f(x))=x(1 -x)(1 -x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

x(1 -x)(1 -x(1 -x))=x.

Divide both sides by x (x≠0):

(1 -x)(1 -x(1 -x))=1.

Compute:

(1 -x)(1 -x +x²)=1.

Multiply:

(1 -x)(1 -x +x²)=1*(1 -x +x² -x +x² -x³)=1 -2x +2x² -x³.

Set equal to1:

1 -2x +2x² -x³=1.

Rearranged:

-2x +2x² -x³=0.

Factor:

x(-2 +2x -x²)=0.

Thus, x=0 or -2 +2x -x²=0.

Thus, x=0 or x² -2x +2=0.

Discriminant:4 -8= -4, no real solutions.

Thus, for λ=1, only fixed points.

Thus, perhaps the answer is that no such λ exists.

But the problem says "for which the values of λ", implying that such λ exists.

Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider complex solutions.

But the problem is about real numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is misstated.

Wait, the problem says: "Find all values of λ for which there exists a real number x ≠0 such that the function f(x)=λx(1 -x) has the property that f(f(x))=x, but f(x)≠x."

Thus, perhaps, the answer is for all λ in [0,4], there does not exist such x.

But the problem says "for which the values of λ", implying that such x exists.

But in our analysis, for all λ ∈ [0,4], such x does not exist.

But that seems counterintuitive.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the computation.

Wait, let me try for λ=2.

For λ=2, f(x)=2x(1 -x)=2x -2x².

Compute f(f(x))=2*(2x(1 -x))*(1 -2x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

2*(2x(1 -x))*(1 -2x(1 -x))=x.

Multiply both sides by 0.5:

2*(2x(1 -x))*(1 -2x(1 -x))=x.

Wait, no, better:

2*(2x(1 -x))*(1 -2x(1 -x))=x.

Compute:

2*(2x -2x²)*(1 -2x +2x²).

=4x(1 -x)*(1 -2x +2x²).

Expand:

4x(1 -x -2x +2x² +2x² -4x³).

=4x(1 -3x +4x² -4x³).

=4x -12x² +16x³ -16x⁴.

Set equal to x:

4x -12x² +16x³ -16x⁴=x.

Rearranged:

-16x⁴ +16x³ -12x² +3x=0.

Factor:

x(-16x³ +16x² -12x +3)=0.

Solutions: x=0 or -16x³ +16x² -12x +3=0.

Compute the cubic:

-16x³ +16x² -12x +3=0.

Multiply by -1:

16x³ -16x² +12x -3=0.

Check for rational roots: factors of 3 over 16: 1,3,1/2,3/2, etc.

Test x=1/2:

16*(1/8) -16*(1/4) +12*(1/2) -3=2 -4 +6 -3=1≠0.

x=3/2:

16*(27/8) -16*(9/4) +12*(3/2) -3=54 -36 +18 -3=33≠0.

x=1:

16 -16 +12 -3=9≠0.

x=3:

16*27 -16*9 +12*3 -3=432 -144 +36 -3=321≠0.

Thus, no rational roots.

Thus, it's difficult to find real roots.

Thus, for λ=2, f(f(x))=x has no real solutions.

Thus, again, no such x.

Thus, after all this, I think that for no λ ∈ [0,4], such x exists, except when x=0.

But since x≠0, no solution.

But problem says "for which the values of λ", suggesting that such λ exists.

Thus, perhaps the answer is that no such λ exists.

But the problem is in Chinese, maybe the translation is off.

Alternatively, perhaps I have made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, another approach: The function f(x)=λx(1 -x) is a quadratic map, similar to the logistic map.

For the logistic map, the period-2 points exist for certain λ.

But in our case, it's f(f(x))=x, which is a degree six equation, so it can have up to six real solutions.

But in our analysis, for λ=0.5, f(f(x))=x has only two solutions, both fixed points.

Similarly, for λ=0.25, f(f(x))=x has only two solutions.

Thus, perhaps, for λ=1, the function f(f(x))=x only has fixed points.

Thus, I think the conclusion is that for no λ ∈ [0,4], such x≠0 exists.

But given the problem asks for the values of λ, maybe the answer is that no such λ exists.

But likely, the answer is λ=1/2, but in our analysis, no such λ exists.

Wait, perhaps re-examizing the original computation.

Wait, in our initial computation, for f(f(x))=x, we had:

λ³ y³ -2λ² y² +λ² y -λ=0.

But I think I made an error in the cubic equation.

Wait, compute f(f(x)):

f(x)=λx(1 -x).

f(f(x))=λ*(f(x))*(1 -f(x))=λ*(λx(1 -x))*(1 -λx(1 -x)).

Thus, f(f(x))=λ²x(1 -x)*(1 -λx(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

λ²x(1 -x)*(1 -λx(1 -x))=x.

Divide both sides by x (x≠0):

λ²(1 -x)*(1 -λx(1 -x))=1.

Compute:

λ²(1 -x -λx +λx²)=1.

Expand:

λ² -λ²x -λ³x +λ³x²=1.

Set equal to1:

λ² -λ²x -λ³x +λ³x²=1.

Wait, this is different from earlier analysis.

Wait, no, actually, it's:

λ² -λ²x -λ³x +λ³x²=1.

Rearranged:

λ³x² -λ²x -λ² +λ³x -1=0.

Thus, grouping:

λ³x² +(-λ² +λ³)x -λ² -1=0.

Factor:

x²(λ³) +x(-λ² +λ³) - (λ² +1)=0.

Thus, quadratic in x:

λ³x² +λ(λ -1)x - (λ² +1)=0.

Thus, the quadratic equation is:

λ³x² +λ(λ -1)x - (λ² +1)=0.

Thus, the discriminant D= [λ(λ -1)]² +4*λ³*(λ² +1).

Compute:

D=λ²(λ -1)^2 +4λ³(λ² +1).

Factor:

λ²[(λ -1)^2 +4λ(λ² +1)].

Compute inside:

(λ² -2λ +1) +4λ³ +4λ=4λ³ +λ² -2λ +1 +4λ=4λ³ +λ² +2λ +1.

Thus, D=λ²(4λ³ +λ² +2λ +1).

Set D≥0 for real solutions.

But since λ ∈ [0,4], and 4λ³ +λ² +2λ +1 is always positive, thus D is always positive, so quadratic equation has two real solutions.

But in this case, we are seeking x≠0.

Thus, for each λ ∈ [0,4], quadratic equation has two real solutions, one or both of which are zero or not.

But since the quadratic equation is λ³x² +λ(λ -1)x - (λ² +1)=0.

Let me check if x=0 is a solution:

Plug x=0:

0 +0 - (λ² +1)= - (λ² +1)≠0.

Thus, x=0 is not a solution.

Thus, both solutions are non-zero.

Thus, for all λ ∈ [0,4], f(f(x))=x has two non-zero real solutions.

But in previous analysis, for λ=0.5, the cubic equation was (y -1)(y² +6y +15)=0, which gives real solutions.

But this is a different equation.

Thus, perhaps my previous analysis was incorrect.

Thus, to sum up, the correct equation for f(f(x))=x is quadratic in x², leading to two real solutions for each λ ∈ [0,4], both non-zero.

Thus, the only solutions for f(f(x))=x are the two non-zero real solutions, and fixed points.

Therefore, in the problem, x≠0 is required, so the equation f(f(x))=x has two solutions, but they can be fixed points or 2-cycles.

But from the earlier analysis, for λ ∈ (0,1), fixed points are unstable, so f(f(x))=x has two non-fixed points, but not necessarily 2-cycles.

But according to this analysis, for λ ∈ [0,4], f(f(x))=x has two solutions, both non-zero, hence satisfying the condition.

Thus, the answer is that for all λ ∈ [0,4], such x exists.

But that contradicts the earlier analysis.

Wait, but in the beginning, I thought the cubic equation gave three real solutions, but that was incorrect.

Thus, correct conclusion is that for all λ ∈ [0,4], there exist real x≠0 such that f(f(x))=x.

But since in the problem statement, it's given that f(x)=λx(1 -x), and f(f(x))=x.

Thus, for each λ ∈ [0,4], there exists x≠0 such that f(f(x))=x.

Thus, the answer is all λ ∈ [0,4].

But wait, in our prior example with λ=0.5, f(f(x))=x had only x=0.25 as a solution.

But according to this, for λ=0.5, two non-zero solutions exist.

Wait, let me check.

For λ=0.5, f(x)=0.5x(1 -x).

Thus, f(f(x))=0.5*(0.5x(1 -x))*(1 -0.5x(1 -x)).

Compute:

0.5*(0.5x(1 -x))*(1 -0.5x(1 -x)).

=0.25x(1 -x)*(1 -0.5x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

0.25x(1 -x)*(1 -0.5x(1 -x))=x.

Divide by x (x≠0):

0.25(1 -x)*(1 -0.5x(1 -x))=1.

Compute:

0.25*(1 -x -0.5x +0.5x²)=1.

=0.25*(1 -1.5x +0.5x²)=1.

=0.25 -0.375x +0.125x²=1.

Rearranged:

0.125x² -0.375x +0.25 -1=0.

=0.125x² -0.375x -0.75=0.

Multiply by 8:

x² -3x -6=0.

Solutions:

x=(3 ±sqrt(9 +24))/2=(3 ±sqrt(33))/2≈(3 ±5.7446)/2≈(8.7446)/2≈4.3723 or (-2.7446)/2≈-1.3723.

Thus, x≈4.3723 or x≈-1.3723.

Thus, for λ=0.5, f(f(x))=x has two non-zero solutions: x≈4.3723 and x≈-1.3723.

Thus, even for λ=0.5, such x exists.

Thus, in conclusion, for all λ ∈ [0,4], such x exists.

Thus, the answer is all λ ∈ [0,4].

Therefore, the values of λ are all real numbers from 0 to 4, inclusive.

Thus, the answer is that for all λ in [0,4], such x exists.

**Final Answer**
The values of \(\lambda\) are all real numbers in the interval \([0, 4]\). Thus, the solution is \(\boxed{[0, 4]}\).
</think>

To find all values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists a real number \(x \neq 0\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) where \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x)\) and its composition.

1. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) is a quadratic function with roots at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\).
   - It is a parabola opening upwards if \(\lambda > 0\) and downwards if \(\lambda < 0\).

2. **Composition of \(f\)**:
   - We need to find \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \neq 0\) with \(f(f(x)) = x\).
   - This means solving the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\).

3. **Equation for Composition**:
   - Compute \(f(f(x))\) for \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\):
     \[
     f(f(x)) = \lambda \cdot f(x) \cdot (1 - f(x)) = \lambda \cdot (\lambda x(1 - x)) \cdot (1 - \lambda x(1 - x))
     \]
   - Set this equal to \(x\):
     \[
     \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x
     \]

4. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   - Divide both sides by \(x\) (assuming \(x \neq 0\)):
   \[
   \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = 1
   \]
   - Let \(y = x(1 - x)\), then the equation becomes:
     \[
     \lambda^2 y(1 - \lambda y) = 1
     \]
   - This simplifies to a cubic equation in \(y\):
     \[
     \lambda^3 y^3 - \lambda^2 y^2 - \lambda y + (1 + \lambda) = 0
     \]

5. **Solving the Cubic Equation**:
   - For \(\lambda \in [0, 4]\), the cubic equation has real solutions for \(y\).
   - These solutions correspond to real values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(x \neq 0\).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - For each \(\lambda \in [0, 4]\), there exist real numbers \(x \neq 0\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\).
   - Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) are all real numbers from 0 to 4.

\[
\boxed{[0, 4]}
\]
