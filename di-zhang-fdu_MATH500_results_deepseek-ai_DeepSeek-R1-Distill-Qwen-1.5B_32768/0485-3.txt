Simplify
\[\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left (\frac {4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right).\]

Correct Answer:
Let $x = \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left (\frac {4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right).$  Then by repeated application of the double angle formula,
\begin{align*}
x \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) &= \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left (\frac {4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \sin \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left (\frac {4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{4} \sin \left (\frac {8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{16} \sin \left( \frac{32 \pi}{15} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{16} \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right),
\end{align*}so $x = \boxed{\frac{1}{16}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to simplify the product of four cosines: \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe I can find a pattern or use some trigonometric identities to simplify this.

First, I remember that products of cosines can sometimes be simplified using product-to-sum formulas. The product-to-sum identities might help here, but I think another approach could be to use multiple-angle formulas or properties of roots of unity. Let me consider both options.

Starting with the product-to-sum approach: The identity for the product of cosines is:

\[
\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A+B) + \cos(A-B)]
\]

But since we're dealing with four cosines, this might get messy quickly. Maybe it's better to look for a telescoping product or use complex exponentials.

Wait, I recall that there's a formula for the product of multiple cosines with angles that are powers of two. Specifically, for angles like \(\theta, 2\theta, 4\theta, 8\theta\), the product can be expressed in terms of sines or cosines of multiple angles. Maybe I can express this product in terms of sine functions.

I remember that:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos(2^k \theta) = \frac{\sin(2^n \theta)}{2^n \sin \theta}
\]

But in our case, the angles are not all powers of two. Let me check: 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. Wait, 16π/15 is equivalent to (16 - 15)π/15 = π/15, so actually, the last term is cos(π/15). So the angles are 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, and 16π/15, which is equal to cos(π/15). So perhaps they can be expressed as powers of 2 times π/15.

So, let me write them as:

2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. Notice that 16 is 2^4, so 16π/15 is 2^4 * π/15. So actually, the angles are 2^0 π/15, 2^1 π/15, 2^2 π/15, 2^4 π/15. Hmm, so not all exponents are from 0 to 3. So maybe this identity isn't directly applicable.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor out something. Let me see:

The product is:

\[
\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{8\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{15}\right)
\]

Wait, because 16π/15 is the same as (16 - 15)π/15 = π/15. So, it's actually cos(π/15). So, the product becomes:

\[
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{8\pi}{15}\right)
\]

So, it's four terms, each double the previous angle, but 8π/15 is not double 4π/15, since 4π/15 * 2 = 8π/15, so actually, that's correct.

So, if I take the product as:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{3} \cos\left(2^k \cdot \frac{\pi}{15}\right)
\]

Except that 8π/15 is 2^3 * π/15, but the last term is 16π/15, which is 2^4 * π/15, but since cosine has a period of 2π, cos(16π/15) = cos(π/15). So, it's the same as cos(π/15). So, that makes the product:

\[
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{8\pi}{15}\right)
\]

Which is exactly the product I thought earlier.

Now, the formula I was thinking about earlier is:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos(2^k \theta) = \frac{\sin(2^n \theta)}{2^n \sin \theta}
\]

But in this case, θ = π/15, and the product is up to k=3, which is four terms. So, n=4.

Wait, but in the formula, the product is from k=0 to n-1, so for n=4, it would be up to 2^3 θ, which is 8π/15, which is exactly our last term. So, maybe this formula can be applied here?

But wait, in the formula, the product is of cos(2^k θ), so in our case, it is exactly cos(2^0 π/15) cos(2^1 π/15) cos(2^2 π/15) cos(2^3 π/15), which is exactly the product we have.

Therefore, according to the formula:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{3} \cos\left(2^k \cdot \frac{\pi}{15}\right) = \frac{\sin\left(2^4 \cdot \frac{\pi}{15}\right)}{2^4 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{15}\right)} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{16\pi}{15}\right)}{16 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{15}\right)}
\]

But wait, in our case, the last term is cos(16π/15) which is equal to cos(π/15) because cosine is periodic with period 2π. So, 16π/15 is equivalent to π/15, as 16π/15 - 15π/15 = π/15. So, actually, the product is:

\[
\frac{\sin(16π/15)}{16 \sin(π/15)} = \frac{\sin(π/15)}{16 \sin(π/15)} = \frac{1}{16}
\]

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify:

16π/15 is equal to 16π/15 - 2π = 16π/15 - 30π/15 = -14π/15. But cosine is even, so cos(-14π/15) = cos(14π/15). But 14π/15 is π - π/15, so cos(14π/15) = -cos(π/15). Hmm, but that contradicts my earlier statement.

Wait, hold on, 16π/15 is equal to π + π/15, so cos(16π/15) = cos(π + π/15) = -cos(π/15). So, that's different from my earlier thought. So, actually, 16π/15 is equal to π + π/15, so cos(16π/15) = -cos(π/15). So, that affects the product.

Wait, so let me correct that. The product is:

\[
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{8\pi}{15}\right) = \frac{\sin(16π/15)}{16 \sin(π/15)} = \frac{\sin(16π/15)}{16 \sin(π/15)}
\]

But sin(16π/15) is sin(π + π/15) = -sin(π/15). Therefore:

\[
\frac{\sin(16π/15)}{16 \sin(π/15)} = \frac{-\sin(π/15)}{16 \sin(π/15)} = -\frac{1}{16}
\]

Wait, so it's negative 1/16? But cosine terms are positive in the first and fourth quadrants, and since all angles here are positive and less than π/2 or π, so all cosines are positive. Therefore, the product should be positive. Hmm, so this suggests that there was a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is for θ between 0 and π/2? Or perhaps I need to adjust the formula because 16π/15 is greater than π.

Wait, the formula \(\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos(2^k \theta) = \frac{\sin(2^n \theta)}{2^n \sin \theta}\) is valid for θ in (0, π/2). If θ is greater than π/2, then 2^n θ could be outside the range, but cosine is still defined.

But in our case, 16π/15 is greater than π. So, perhaps the formula still applies, but we have to consider the periodicity. So, sin(16π/15) = sin(16π/15 - 2π) = sin(-2π/15) = -sin(2π/15). Wait, so sin(16π/15) is equal to sin(-2π/15) because 16π/15 is coterminal with -2π/15.

So, sin(16π/15) = -sin(2π/15). Therefore, going back:

\[
\frac{\sin(16π/15)}{16 \sin(π/15)} = \frac{-\sin(2π/15)}{16 \sin(π/15)} = -\frac{\sin(2π/15)}{16 \sin(π/15)}
\]

But earlier, I thought that sin(16π/15) was equal to -sin(π/15). Let's verify that:

16π/15 is equal to π + π/15, so sin(16π/15) = sin(π + π/15) = -sin(π/15). So, that's correct. Therefore, sin(16π/15) = -sin(π/15). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{-\sin(π/15)}{16 \sin(π/15)} = -\frac{1}{16}
\]

But wait, earlier, I thought that the product is positive because all cosines are positive. So, there must be a mistake here. Let me check.

Wait, the formula is:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos(2^k \theta) = \frac{\sin(2^n \theta)}{2^n \sin \theta}
\]

But in our case, θ = π/15, and 2^n θ = 2^4 * π/15 = 16π/15. So, the formula is indeed valid, but sin(16π/15) = -sin(π/15). So, plugging in, we get:

\[
\frac{\sin(16π/15)}{16 \sin(π/15)} = \frac{-\sin(π/15)}{16 \sin(π/15)} = -\frac{1}{16}
\]

But that's negative, but all cosines are positive. So, the product should be positive. Therefore, perhaps the formula is giving the absolute value? Or perhaps I have a miscalculation.

Wait, actually, in the formula, the product is of cos(2^k θ). Each cosine is positive in the first quadrant, but when θ is such that 2^k θ exceeds π/2, the cosine becomes negative.

Wait, but in our case, θ = π/15, which is approximately 12 degrees. So, 2^0 θ = π/15 ≈ 12°, 2^1 θ = 24°, 2^2 θ = 48°, 2^3 θ = 96°, and 2^4 θ = 192°, which is in the third quadrant, where cosine is negative. So, actually, cos(192°) = cos(180° + 12°) = -cos(12°). So, the last term is negative, but the other terms are positive. So, the product is negative.

But wait, the original product is:

\[
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{8\pi}{15}\right)
\]

Which is a product of four positive terms, so it should be positive. Therefore, the formula must be giving the absolute value, but since each term is positive, perhaps the formula is correct, but I messed up the sign somewhere.

Wait, hold on, 16π/15 is equal to π + π/15, so cos(16π/15) = -cos(π/15). So, in the formula, sin(16π/15) = sin(π + π/15) = -sin(π/15). So, sin(16π/15) is negative, which is why the ratio is negative. But in our case, the product is positive because all cosines are positive. So, perhaps the formula is giving the absolute value?

Wait, no, in the formula, it's exactly equal to sin(16π/15)/(16 sin(π/15)). But sin(16π/15) is negative, so the entire expression is negative. However, our product is positive, so perhaps I should take the absolute value?

But that doesn't seem right because the product is positive. Alternatively, maybe I need to adjust the formula to account for the fact that some terms are negative.

Wait, maybe the formula is not applicable here because 16π/15 is just another angle, but due to the periodicity of cosine, it's equivalent to cos(π/15), which is positive. So, perhaps I need to consider the magnitude instead.

Wait, but in the formula:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos(2^k \theta) = \frac{\sin(2^n \theta)}{2^n \sin \theta}
\]

If θ is such that 2^n θ is in the third quadrant, the formula still applies, but the sine is negative, so the ratio is negative. However, since each term in the product is positive, the product should be positive. So, perhaps the absolute value is required.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, let's compute the product step by step. Let me compute each cosine term numerically to see the sign.

Compute each cosine:

1. cos(π/15): π ≈ 3.1416, π/15 ≈ 0.2094 radians ≈ 12°, cosine is positive.
2. cos(2π/15): ≈ 0.4161 radians ≈ 24°, positive.
3. cos(4π/15): ≈ 0.9135 radians ≈ 53°, positive.
4. cos(8π/15): ≈ 1.758 radians ≈ 100°, which is in the second quadrant, so cosine is negative.

Wait, hold on, 8π/15 is approximately 1.758 radians, which is more than π/2 (≈1.5708) but less than π (≈3.1416). So, 8π/15 is 100 degrees, which is in the second quadrant, so cosine is negative. So, the last term is negative, which makes the product negative. Therefore, the product is negative.

But the original product is all positive terms, so this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that 8π/15 is 2^3 * π/15.

Wait, 2^3 is 8, so 2^3 * π/15 is indeed 8π/15. So, 8π/15 is approximately 100°, which is in the second quadrant. So, cos(8π/15) is negative.

But then, the product is negative. However, if I take the absolute value, it's positive. But it's not clear whether the formula is giving the exact value or an absolute value.

Wait, but in our case, the formula gives a negative value, which is consistent with the product being negative because of the last term.

But the original product is positive. So, perhaps the formula is correct, and the negative sign is part of the formula, but in reality, the product is positive because all terms are positive. Therefore, perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that each term is positive, so the product is positive, so the formula should yield a positive value, but since we're taking the sine of an angle in the third quadrant, the formula gives a negative value, which is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to take the absolute value of the formula.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe instead of using the multiple-angle formula, I can use the identity for the product of cosines in terms of sines.

I recall that:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos\left(2^k \theta\right) = \frac{\sin\left(2^n \theta\right)}{2^n \sin \theta}
\]

But if θ is such that 2^n θ is greater than π, then sin(2^n θ) is negative, but the product of cosines is positive because each term is positive.

Therefore, perhaps the formula is giving the magnitude, and we have to take absolute value.

Alternatively, maybe the formula can be adjusted by considering the absolute value of sin(2^n θ). But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps my mistake is in the formula. Maybe the formula is for θ between 0 and π/2, but in our case, θ is less than π/2 but 2^n θ exceeds π.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we can pair terms.

Let me pair the first term with the last term:

cos(π/15) * cos(16π/15) = cos(π/15) * cos(π + π/15) = cos(π/15) * (-cos(π/15)) = -cos²(π/15)

Similarly, pair the second term with the third term:

cos(2π/15) * cos(8π/15) = cos(2π/15) * cos(8π/15)

Hmm, cos(8π/15) is equal to cos(π - 7π/15) = -cos(7π/15). So, cos(2π/15) * (-cos(7π/15)) = -cos(2π/15)cos(7π/15)

So, now, our product becomes:

- cos²(π/15) * (-cos(2π/15)cos(7π/15)) = cos²(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(7π/15)

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another pairing.

Alternatively, perhaps use product-to-sum identities for multiple angles.

Wait, I can use the identity for the product of cosines:

cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2

So, let me try multiplying cos(π/15) and cos(2π/15):

cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) = [cos(3π/15) + cos(-π/15)] / 2 = [cos(π/5) + cos(π/15)] / 2

Similarly, cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) = [cos(12π/15) + cos(-4π/15)] / 2 = [cos(4π/5) + cos(4π/15)] / 2

So, now, our product becomes:

[cos(π/5) + cos(π/15)] / 2 * [cos(4π/5) + cos(4π/15)] / 2

So, that's equal to [cos(π/5) + cos(π/15)] [cos(4π/5) + cos(4π/15)] / 4

Now, let me compute this:

Multiply the numerators:

cos(π/5) cos(4π/5) + cos(π/5) cos(4π/15) + cos(π/15) cos(4π/5) + cos(π/15) cos(4π/15)

Now, let me evaluate each term:

1. cos(π/5) cos(4π/5): π/5 is 36°, 4π/5 is 144°, so cos(36°)cos(144°). Cos(144°) is equal to -cos(36°). So, cos(36°)*(-cos(36°)) = -cos²(36°)

2. cos(π/5) cos(4π/15): π/5 is 36°, 4π/15 is 48°, so cos(36°)cos(48°). Not sure, need to keep as is.

3. cos(π/15) cos(4π/5): π/15 is 12°, 4π/5 is 144°, so cos(12°)cos(144°) = cos(12°)*(-cos(36°))

4. cos(π/15) cos(4π/15): 12° and 48°, cos(12°)cos(48°)

So, putting it all together:

- cos²(36°) + cos(36°)cos(48°) + (-cos(12°)cos(36°)) + cos(12°)cos(48°)

Simplify term by term:

- cos²(36°) - cos(12°)cos(36°) + cos(36°)cos(48°) + cos(12°)cos(48°)

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I can use another identity for the product of four cosines. I remember that there's an identity for the product of four cosines with angles doubling each time, but I don't remember it exactly.

Alternatively, maybe using complex exponentials. Let me consider that.

Express each cosine as the real part of a complex exponential:

cos θ = (e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ}) / 2

So, the product becomes:

Re(e^{iπ/15} + e^{-iπ/15}) / 2 * Re(e^{i2π/15} + e^{-i2π/15}) / 2 * Re(e^{i4π/15} + e^{-i4π/15}) / 2 * Re(e^{i8π/15} + e^{-i8π/15}) / 2

But multiplying these four terms is complicated, but perhaps we can express it as the real part of the product of e^{i(π/15 + 2π/15 + 4π/15 + 8π/15)} and similar terms.

Wait, maybe let me consider that:

If I have four terms like (cos A)(cos 2A)(cos 4A)(cos 8A), where A = π/15, then perhaps the product is equal to the real part of e^{iA} e^{i2A} e^{i4A} e^{i8A} = e^{i(15A)} = e^{iπ} = -1. But that seems too simplistic, because the product of cosines is not directly related to the real part of the product of exponentials.

Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply cosines, it's not simply the real part of the product of exponentials, but rather it's the real part of the product of (e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ}) / 2.

So, perhaps:

Product_{k=0}^3 cos(2^k A) = Re[(e^{iA} + e^{-iA})(e^{i2A} + e^{-i2A})(e^{i4A} + e^{-i4A})(e^{i8A} + e^{-i8A})] / 16

Because each cosine contributes a factor of (e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ}) / 2, so multiplying four such factors gives the product above.

So, the numerator is the real part of the product:

(e^{iA} + e^{-iA})(e^{i2A} + e^{-i2A})(e^{i4A} + e^{-i4A})(e^{i8A} + e^{-i8A})

Let me compute this product.

Let me denote z = e^{iA}. Then, the product becomes:

(z + z^{-1})(z² + z^{-2})(z⁴ + z^{-4})(z⁸ + z^{-8})

Multiply these terms together.

Note that this is the product over k=0 to 3 of (z^{2^k} + z^{-2^k}).

This product is known to be equal to z^{16} + z^{-16} over the product of z^{2^k} - z^{-2^k} from k=0 to 3. Wait, no, that's not quite.

Wait, actually, there is a formula for the product over k=0 to n-1 of (z^{2^k} + z^{-2^k}) = (z^{2^n} - z^{-2^n}) / (z - 1) or something similar?

Wait, let me recall that:

(z + z^{-1})(z² + z^{-2})(z⁴ + z^{-4})...(z^{2^{n}} + z^{-2^{n}}) = (z^{2^{n+1}} - z^{-2^{n+1}}) / (z - z^{-1})

Wait, not quite. Let me check for small n.

Let me take n=1:

(z + z^{-1}) = (z² - z^{-2}) / (z - z^{-1})? Let's compute:

z² - z^{-2} = z² - 1/z² = (z^4 - 1)/z²

(z - z^{-1}) = (z² - 1)/z

So, (z² - 1)/z divided by (z² - 1)/z² is z. So, yes, (z + z^{-1}) = (z² - z^{-2}) / (z - z^{-1})

Similarly, for n=2:

(z + z^{-1})(z² + z^{-2}) = (z^4 - z^{-4}) / (z - z^{-1})

Wait, let me compute:

Left-hand side: (z + z^{-1})(z² + z^{-2}) = z^3 + z^{-1} + z + z^{-3}

Right-hand side: (z^4 - z^{-4}) / (z - z^{-1}) = (z^4 - 1/z^4) * z / (z² - 1) = (z^5 - z^{-3}) / (z² - 1)

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the formula is different.

Wait, maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that:

Product_{k=0}^{n-1} (z^{2^k} + z^{-2^k}) = (z^{2^n} + 1) / (z + 1) if z is a root of unity or something. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, I can note that:

(z + z^{-1})(z² + z^{-2}) = z^3 + z^{-3} + z + z^{-1}

Which is similar to the previous expansion.

Wait, maybe use induction.

Assume that for n, the product is (z^{2^{n+1}} - z^{-2^{n+1}}) / (z - z^{-1})

Wait, let's test for n=1:

(z + z^{-1}) = (z² - z^{-2}) / (z - z^{-1})

Which we saw earlier is true.

For n=2:

(z + z^{-1})(z² + z^{-2}) = (z³ + z^{-3} + z + z^{-1})

But according to the formula, (z^{4} - z^{-4}) / (z - z^{-1})

Compute numerator: z^4 - z^{-4} = (z^8 - 1)/z^4

Denominator: z - z^{-1} = (z² - 1)/z

So, (z^4 - z^{-4}) / (z - z^{-1}) = (z^8 - 1)/z^4 * z / (z² - 1) = (z^8 - 1)/(z^3(z² - 1)) = (z^8 -1)/(z^5 - z³)

But the left-hand side is z³ + z^{-3} + z + z^{-1} = (z^4 + 1)z^{-1} + (z^4 + 1)z

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps a better idea is to compute the product step by step.

Compute (z + z^{-1})(z² + z^{-2}) = z^3 + z^{-3} + z + z^{-1}

Then, multiply by (z⁴ + z^{-4}):

(z^3 + z^{-3} + z + z^{-1})(z⁴ + z^{-4}) = z^7 + z^{-7} + z^5 + z^{-5} + z^5 + z^{-5} + z + z^{-1}

Wait, that seems messy. Maybe it's not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps better to use logarithms or something, but that might complicate more.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that:

The product is:

Re[ (e^{iA} + e^{-iA})(e^{i2A} + e^{-i2A})(e^{i4A} + e^{-i4A})(e^{i8A} + e^{-i8A}) ] / 16

Let me compute the product:

(e^{iA} + e^{-iA})(e^{i2A} + e^{-i2A})(e^{i4A} + e^{-i4A})(e^{i8A} + e^{-i8A})

Let me denote S = e^{iA} + e^{-iA} = 2 cos A

Similarly, the product becomes S * (S² - 2 cos 2A) * (S^4 - 2 cos 4A) * (S^8 - 2 cos 8A)

Wait, that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the product of sines.

Wait, another thought: if I set A = π/15, then 2A = 2π/15, 4A = 4π/15, 8A = 8π/15. So, the product is:

cos A cos 2A cos 4A cos 8A = [sin(16A)] / [2^4 sin A] = sin(16A)/(16 sin A)

But 16A = 16*(π/15) = 16π/15, which is coterminal with π + π/15, so sin(16A) = -sin(π/15). Therefore:

cos A cos 2A cos 4A cos 8A = (-sin π/15)/(16 sin π/15) = -1/16

But earlier, I thought all cosines are positive, so the product should be positive. So, this suggests that the formula gives a negative result, but the original product is positive. So, perhaps the formula is giving the absolute value, or I need to take the absolute value of the formula.

Wait, but in the formula, it's a product of cosines, which are positive in the first quadrant. So, the formula result is negative because 16π/15 is in the third quadrant where cosine is negative.

But the original product is four positive cosines multiplied together, which should be positive. Therefore, maybe the formula gives the absolute value, but I need to consider that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is not applicable here because the angles exceed π/2.

Wait, another idea: maybe the formula is correct, but the product is equal to the absolute value of the formula result.

Wait, no, because in the formula, each cosine is positive, but the product would still be positive, but the formula gives a negative result.

Wait, maybe I need to take the absolute value of the formula's result. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula counts the absolute values of the cosines, but in reality, the product is positive because it's four positive terms. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed by considering that the product is equal to sin(16A)/(16 sin A), which is -1/16, but because all the angles are in the first and second quadrants, but 16A is in the third quadrant, so the formula gives a negative value, which is consistent with the product being negative because of the last term.

But the original product is positive, so perhaps the formula is giving the magnitude, and we need to take the absolute value.

Alternatively, maybe we can note that:

cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) = |sin(16π/15)/(16 sin π/15)|

But sin(16π/15) is negative, so the absolute value is sin(16π/15)/sin π/15.

Wait, but sin(16π/15) = -sin(π/15), so |sin(16π/15)| = sin(π/15). Therefore, |sin(16π/15)/(16 sin π/15)| = 1/16.

But since the original product is positive, we can say that the product is 1/16.

Wait, but in the previous step, we saw that sin(16π/15) = -sin(π/15). So, sin(16π/15) is negative, so |sin(16π/15)| = sin(π/15). Therefore, |sin(16π/15)/(16 sin π/15)| = 1/16.

But wait, the product is equal to sin(16π/15)/(16 sin π/15) = (-sin π/15)/(16 sin π/15) = -1/16, but the original product is positive, so perhaps we take the absolute value, getting 1/16.

Therefore, the product is 1/16.

Wait, but earlier, we thought that the product is negative because of the last term, but perhaps the product is actually positive, as each term is positive.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think numerically.

Compute each cosine term:

1. cos(π/15) ≈ cos(12°) ≈ 0.9781
2. cos(2π/15) ≈ cos(24°) ≈ 0.9135
3. cos(4π/15) ≈ cos(48°) ≈ 0.6691
4. cos(8π/15) ≈ cos(96°) ≈ -0.1045

So, the product is approximately:

0.9781 * 0.9135 * 0.6691 * (-0.1045) ≈ Let's compute step by step:

First, 0.9781 * 0.9135 ≈ 0.892

Then, 0.892 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.596

Then, 0.596 * (-0.1045) ≈ -0.0621

So, the product is approximately -0.0621. But the formula gives -1/16 ≈ -0.0625

So, that's consistent. Therefore, the product is approximately -0.0625, which is -1/16, but the original product is negative because of the last term.

But in the original problem, all the cosines are positive except the last one, which is negative. So, the product is negative.

But the original problem didn't specify whether the result should be positive or negative.

But in the problem statement, it's written as:

cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) cos(16π/15)

So, all terms except the last one are positive, but the last one is negative. So, the product is negative.

But in the formula, it's equal to sin(16π/15)/(16 sin π/15) = (-sin π/15)/(16 sin π/15) = -1/16.

So, the formula gives -1/16, which matches our numerical computation.

Therefore, the correct value of the product is -1/16.

But wait, in the problem statement, it's written as:

\[\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right).\]

So, the last term is cos(16π/15), which is negative, so the product is negative.

But in the formula, the product is equal to sin(16π/15)/(16 sin π/15). Since sin(16π/15) is negative, the product is negative.

But in the problem, the product is written with the last term cos(16π/15), which is negative, so the whole product is negative.

But in the multiple-angle formula, the product of cosines is equal to sin(16π/15)/(16 sin π/15), which is -1/16.

So, the product is -1/16.

But since the user didn't specify if the answer should be positive or negative, but in mathematical expressions, unless specified, it can be negative.

Wait, but in the initial step, I thought that the product is positive because all the terms are positive, but that's not the case because the last term is negative due to the angle being in the third quadrant.

Therefore, the correct answer is -1/16.

But let me check another source to confirm.

Wait, another way: the product formula is for angles in the first quadrant, but if you have an angle beyond π/2, you can use the identity:

cos A cos(2A) cos(4A) cos(8A) = sin(16A)/(16 sin A)

But if A > π/2, then 16A might be greater than π, but in such case, sin(16A) is negative, so the formula can give a negative result, which is consistent with our calculation.

Therefore, in this case, the product is -1/16.

Hence, the answer is \boxed{-\dfrac{1}{16}}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-\dfrac{1}{16}}
</think>

To simplify the product \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we can use the formula for the product of cosines in terms of sines.

First, we note that the angles are \(\frac{2\pi}{15}\), \(\frac{4\pi}{15}\), \(\frac{8\pi}{15}\), and \(\frac{16\pi}{15}\). The last term, \(\cos \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right)\), is equivalent to \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\) because \(\frac{16\pi}{15} = \pi + \frac{\pi}{15}\), and cosine is negative there, but the product is negative.

Using the formula for the product of cosines, we have:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos\left(2^k \theta\right) = \frac{\sin\left(2^n \theta\right)}{2^n \sin \theta}
\]
Here, we set \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{15}\) and \(n = 4\) because we have four terms. Thus, we need to consider the product:
\[
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{15}\right) \cos\left(\frac{8\pi}{15}\right)
\]
According to the formula, this product is:
\[
\frac{\sin\left(16 \cdot \frac{\pi}{15}\right)}{16 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{15}\right)}
\]
Since \(16 \cdot \frac{\pi}{15} = \frac{16\pi}{15}\), which is coterminal with \(\pi + \frac{\pi}{15}\), we have:
\[
\sin\left(\frac{16\pi}{15}\right) = -\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{15}\right)
\]
Thus, the product becomes:
\[
\frac{-\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{15}\right)}{16 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{15}\right)} = -\frac{1}{16}
\]
Therefore, the product \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\) is \(-\frac{1}{16}\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-\dfrac{1}{16}}
\]
