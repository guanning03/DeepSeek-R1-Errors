Question:
The complex numbers $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$, and $\alpha_4$ are the four distinct roots of the equation $x^4+2x^3+2=0$. Determine the unordered set \[
\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}.
\]

Correct Answer:
Employing the elementary symmetric polynomials ($s_1 = \alpha_1+\alpha_2+\alpha_3+\alpha_4 = -2$, $s_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0$, $s_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\alpha_1 + \alpha_4\alpha_1\alpha_2 = 0$, and $s_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2$) we consider the polynomial \[
P(x) = (x-(\alpha_1\alpha_2+\alpha_3\alpha_4))(x-(\alpha_1\alpha_3+\alpha_2\alpha_4))(x-(\alpha_1\alpha_4+\alpha_2\alpha_3))
\]Because $P$ is symmetric with respect to $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4$, we can express the coefficients of its expanded form in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials.  We compute \begin{eqnarray*}
P(x) & = & x^3 - s_2x^2 + (s_3s_1-4s_4)x + (-s_3^2-s_4s_1^2+s_4s_2) \\
& = & x^3 - 8x - 8 \\
& = & (x+2)(x^2-2x-4)
\end{eqnarray*}The roots of $P(x)$ are $-2$ and $1 \pm \sqrt{5}$, so the answer is $\boxed{\{1\pm\sqrt{5},-2\}}.$

$\textbf{Remarks:}$ It is easy to find the coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ by expansion, and the constant term can be computed without the complete expansion and decomposition of $(\alpha_1\alpha_2+\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3+\alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4+\alpha_2\alpha_3)$ by noting that the only nonzero 6th degree expressions in $s_1, s_2, s_3,$ and $s_4$ are $s_1^6$ and $s_4s_1^2$. The general polynomial $P$ constructed here is called the cubic resolvent and arises in Galois theory.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem about complex numbers. It says that α₁, α₂, α₃, and α₄ are four distinct roots of the equation x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0. I need to find the unordered set {α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, α₁α₄ + α₂α₃}. Hmm, that means I need to compute these three different sums and then see what they are, and make sure they are unordered, meaning I can't tell them apart except by their values.

First off, let me recall that for a quartic equation like this, Vieta's formulas can help me relate the sums and products of roots to the coefficients of the polynomial. Vieta's formulas say that for a quartic equation x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d = 0, the sum of roots is -a, the sum of products of roots two at a time is b, the sum of products three at a time is -c, and the product of all four roots is d. So in this case, our equation is x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0, which means a = 2, b = 0 (since there is no x² term), c = 0 (since there is no x term), and d = 2.

So applying Vieta's formulas:

1. α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2
2. α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0
3. α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0
4. α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2

Now, the problem is asking for the unordered set of three expressions: α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, and α₁α₄ + α₂α₃. Let me denote these as S₁, S₂, and S₃ for simplicity.

So S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄

S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄

S₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃

I need to find these three sums. Maybe I can find some relations between them.

I know that the sum of all the products two at a time is zero. So:

α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0

But that's the sum of all possible pairs. Now, S₁, S₂, S₃ are each the sum of two of these pairs.

Let me see. If I add S₁, S₂, and S₃ together, what do I get?

S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄) + (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄) + (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃)

Let me expand that:

= α₁α₂ + α₃α₄ + α₁α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃

Which is the same as:

= (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄) + (α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄)

Which is equal to (sum of all products except α₃α₄) + (sum of all products except α₁α₂). Wait, but the total sum is zero. So let me denote:

Total sum: α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0

Then, S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = (sum without α₃α₄) + (sum without α₁α₂) = 0

But the total sum is sum without α₁α₂ + sum without α₃α₄ = 0.

Wait, so if I let T = sum without α₁α₂ = α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄

Then, T + sum without α₃α₄ = 0

But sum without α₃α₄ = S₁ + S₂ + S₃ - S₃ = S₁ + S₂

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, hold on. Let me try another approach.

Let me denote that S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄

Similarly, S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄

S₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃

So, if I consider S₁, S₂, S₃, I can note that they are the possible pairings of the roots into two pairs each.

I wonder if these S₁, S₂, S₃ are the roots of a certain cubic equation. That might be a useful approach.

Given that, if I can find a cubic equation whose roots are S₁, S₂, S₃, then I can find the set of these values.

To do that, I can consider the elementary symmetric sums of S₁, S₂, S₃.

Let me denote:

p = S₁ + S₂ + S₃

q = S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃

r = S₁S₂S₃

I need to compute p, q, r.

First, let's compute p = S₁ + S₂ + S₃.

As above, S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄) + (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄) + (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) = sum of all products except α₃α₄.

But wait, the total sum of all products is 0, so the sum of all products except α₃α₄ is equal to α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ = sum of all pairs except α₃α₄. Which is equal to 0 - α₃α₄.

But that seems a bit recursive. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of p = S₁ + S₂ + S₃.

Wait, let me actually compute S₁ + S₂ + S₃.

S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄) + (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄) + (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄

But that's exactly the sum of all products of two roots, which is given as 0.

So p = 0.

Okay, so p = 0.

Now, let's compute q = S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃.

That's going to be a bit more involved. Let's compute each term:

First, let's compute S₁S₂.

S₁S₂ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)

Let me expand this:

= α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄²

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there is a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express S₁S₂ in terms of other symmetric sums.

Alternatively, another idea: Let me consider that S₁, S₂, S₃ are the elementary symmetric functions of degree 2 of some other variables. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the product of the S's is equal to the product of all the roots taken two at a time in some way.

Wait, I know that the product α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2, which is given.

Also, from Vieta's, the sum of the roots is -2, the sum of the products two at a time is 0, sum of products three at a time is 0.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the S's as follows:

Each S is a sum of two products of roots. So perhaps each S is equal to (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄), and so on.

Wait, maybe if I square the sum of the roots or something like that?

Wait, let's try to compute the square of the sum of the roots:

(α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄)² = α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄² + 2(α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄)

We know that the sum of the roots is -2, so the square is 4.

And the sum of the products two at a time is 0, so 2 * 0 = 0.

Therefore, 4 = α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄² + 0 => α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄² = 4.

Hmm, that might be useful later.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the sum of the squares of the S's.

But that might be too involved.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the equation whose roots are S₁, S₂, S₃. Let me denote this equation as x³ + px² + qx + r = 0, but in this case, since p = 0, it would be x³ + qx + r = 0.

If I can find q and r, then I can write down the equation and find the roots.

To find q and r, I need to compute S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ and S₁S₂S₃.

So let's compute q = S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃.

First, let me compute S₁S₂.

S₁S₂ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)

Let me expand this:

= α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄²

Similarly, S₁S₃ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃)

Expanding:

= α₁²α₂α₄ + α₁α₂²α₃ + α₁α₃α₄² + α₂α₃²α₄

And S₂S₃ = (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃)

Expanding:

= α₁²α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₃² + α₁α₂α₄² + α₂²α₃α₄

So, adding all these up:

q = S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃

= [α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄²] + [α₁²α₂α₄ + α₁α₂²α₃ + α₁α₃α₄² + α₂α₃²α₄] + [α₁²α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₃² + α₁α₂α₄² + α₂²α₃α₄]

Now, let's group similar terms:

Looking for the terms with α₁²α₂α₃:

From S₁S₂: 1 term

From S₁S₃: 0

From S₂S₃: 1 term

So total: 2 α₁²α₂α₃

Similarly, for α₁α₂²α₄:

From S₁S₂: 1

From S₁S₃: 1

From S₂S₃: 0

Total: 2 α₁α₂²α₄

Similarly, for α₁α₃²α₄:

From S₁S₂: 1

From S₁S₃: 0

From S₂S₃: 1

Total: 2 α₁α₃²α₄

Similarly, for α₂α₃α₄²:

From S₁S₂: 0

From S₁S₃: 1

From S₂S₃: 1

Total: 2 α₂α₃α₄²

Wait, hold on, that seems the same for each variable.

Wait, but let me see:

Wait, actually, each term is symmetric in the roots, so perhaps we can factor out 2 from each of these.

Thus, q = 2(α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄² + α₁²α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₃² + α₁α₂α₄² + α₂²α₃α₄)

Wait, actually, no, let's re-examine:

Looking back at each term:

From S₁S₂: α₁²α₂α₃, α₁α₂²α₄, α₁α₃²α₄, α₂α₃α₄²

From S₁S₃: α₁²α₂α₄, α₁α₂²α₃, α₁α₃α₄², α₂α₃²α₄

From S₂S₃: α₁²α₃α₄, α₁α₂α₃², α₁α₂α₄², α₂²α₃α₄

So, each of the terms is present twice, except maybe for some.

Wait, actually, no, each term is present twice. For example, α₁²α₂α₃ appears in S₁S₂ once, and in S₂S₃ once. Similarly, α₁α₂²α₄ appears in S₁S₂ once and in S₁S₃ once.

Similarly, each of the other terms is present twice.

So, yes, q = 2(α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄² + α₁²α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₃² + α₁α₂α₄² + α₂²α₃α₄)

So, q = 2[α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄² + α₁²α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₃² + α₁α₂α₄² + α₂²α₃α₄]

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can factor this expression.

Wait, perhaps we can factor α₁α₂α₃α₄ from each term.

Looking at each term, for example, α₁²α₂α₃ = α₁ * α₁α₂α₃α₄.

Similarly, α₁α₂²α₄ = α₂ * α₁α₂α₃α₄, and so on.

Therefore, each term is equal to α₁α₂α₃α₄ multiplied by some factor.

So, let's factor out α₁α₂α₃α₄.

Thus, q = 2[α₁α₂α₃α₄ (α₁ + α₄ + α₂ + α₃) + (α₁α₂ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₁α₂ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄)]

Wait, hold on, let's see.

Wait, in the first part, each term is α₁α₂α₃α₄ multiplied by one of the roots. For example, α₁²α₂α₃ = α₁ * α₁α₂α₃α₄ = α₁ * α₁α₂α₃α₄.

Similarly, α₁α₂²α₄ = α₂ * α₁α₂α₃α₄.

And so on.

So, the first part would be:

α₁α₂α₃α₄ (α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄)

But from Vieta's, we know that α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2.

So, that part is α₁α₂α₃α₄ * (-2).

Then, the second part is the remaining terms:

α₁α₂α₃α₄ (α₂ + α₃) + α₁α₂α₃α₄ (α₁ + α₄) + α₁α₂α₃α₄ (α₂ + α₄) + α₁α₂α₃α₄ (α₃ + α₄)

Wait, let me check.

Wait, no, that's not correct because in the first expansion, each term is α₁²α₂α₃, which is α₁ * α₁α₂α₃α₄, which is α₁ * α₁α₂α₃α₄. Then similarly, α₁α₂²α₄ is α₂ * α₁α₂α₃α₄, etc.

Wait, but in the expansion, the first part is:

α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄² + α₁²α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₃² + α₁α₂α₄² + α₂²α₃α₄

Which can be factored as:

α₁α₂α₃α₄ (α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄) + α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄

Wait, actually, let me think again.

Each term is α₁α₂α₃α₄ multiplied by one of the roots, except the last four terms which are the products of three roots.

Wait, no, actually:

Looking at the first four terms:

α₁²α₂α₃ = α₁ * α₁α₂α₃

α₁α₂²α₄ = α₂ * α₁α₂α₄

α₁α₃²α₄ = α₃ * α₁α₃α₄

α₂α₃α₄² = α₄ * α₂α₃α₄

So, the first four terms can be written as α₁α₂α₃α₄ (α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄)

Then, the next four terms are:

α₁α₂α₃² + α₁α₂α₄² + α₁α₃α₄² + α₂α₃α₄² + α₁²α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₄α₄ + α₂²α₃α₄

Wait, no, that seems messy.

Wait, actually, the remaining terms after the first four are:

α₁α₂α₃² + α₁α₂α₄² + α₁α₃α₄² + α₂α₃α₄² + α₁²α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₄α₄ + α₂²α₃α₄

Wait, but this seems incorrect because when you factor out α₁α₂α₃α₄, the remaining terms should be the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time.

Wait, let me clarify.

The entire expression inside the brackets is:

α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄² + α₁²α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₃² + α₁α₂α₄² + α₂²α₃α₄

Let me factor α₁α₂α₃α₄ from each term:

First term: α₁²α₂α₃ = α₁ * α₁α₂α₃α₄ = α₁ * (α₁α₂α₃α₄)

Second term: α₁α₂²α₄ = α₂ * α₁α₂α₃α₄

Third term: α₁α₃²α₄ = α₃ * α₁α₂α₃α₄

Fourth term: α₂α₃α₄² = α₄ * α₁α₂α₃α₄

Fifth term: α₁²α₃α₄ = α₁ * α₁α₂α₃α₄

Sixth term: α₁α₂α₃² = α₂ * α₁α₂α₃α₄

Seventh term: α₁α₂α₄² = α₃ * α₁α₂α₃α₄

Eighth term: α₂²α₃α₄ = α₄ * α₁α₂α₃α₄

So, each term is a root multiplied by α₁α₂α₃α₄. Therefore, the sum is:

(α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄) * α₁α₂α₃α₄ + (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄) * α₁α₂α₃α₄

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, actually, each term is a single root times α₁α₂α₃α₄, so when we factor that out, we have:

α₁α₂α₃α₄ (α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄) + (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄) * α₁α₂α₃α₄

But the first part is (sum of roots) * α₁α₂α₃α₄, which is (-2) * 2 = -4.

The second part is (sum of products two at a time) * α₁α₂α₃α₄, which is 0 * 2 = 0.

So the entire expression inside the brackets is (-4) + 0 = -4.

Thus, q = 2 * (-4) = -8.

Wait, that's interesting. So q = -8.

Now, moving on to r = S₁S₂S₃.

This seems more complicated. Let's compute r.

r = S₁S₂S₃.

Given:

S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄

S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄

S₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃

So, r = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃)

This seems like a lot, but perhaps we can expand it step by step.

Let me denote:

A = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄

B = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄

C = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃

So, r = A * B * C

First, compute A * B:

A * B = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)

Expanding this:

= α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄²

Then, multiply this by C:

= [α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄²] * (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃)

Expanding each term:

First, α₁²α₂α₃ * α₁α₄ = α₁³α₂α₃α₄

Second, α₁²α₂α₃ * α₂α₃ = α₁²α₂²α₃²

Third, α₁α₂²α₄ * α₁α₄ = α₁²α₂²α₄²

Fourth, α₁α₂²α₄ * α₂α₃ = α₁α₂³α₃α₄

Fifth, α₁α₃²α₄ * α₁α₄ = α₁²α₃²α₄²

Sixth, α₁α₃²α₄ * α₂α₃ = α₁α₂α₃³α₄

Seventh, α₂α₃α₄² * α₁α₄ = α₁α₂α₃α₄³

Eighth, α₂α₃α₄² * α₂α₃ = α₂²α₃²α₄²

So, putting it all together, we have:

r = α₁³α₂α₃α₄ + α₁²α₂²α₃² + α₁²α₂²α₄² + α₁α₂³α₃α₄ + α₁²α₃²α₄² + α₁α₂α₃³α₄ + α₁α₂α₃α₄³ + α₂²α₃²α₄²

Hmm, that's quite a lot. Maybe we can factor this expression.

Looking at each term:

Each term is either a product of α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄ raised to some power, with exponents adding up to 1+1+1+1+1=5, but actually, each exponent is 3 for some variables and 1 for others.

Wait, perhaps we can factor α₁α₂α₃α₄ from each term.

Looking at each term:

α₁³α₂α₃α₄ = α₁² * α₁α₂α₃α₄

α₁²α₂²α₃² = α₁² * (α₂α₃)²

Wait, but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps we can factor α₁α₂α₃α₄ from each term except the last one.

Wait, the last term is α₁α₂α₃α₄³, which can be written as α₁α₂α₃α₄ * α₁α₂α₃α₄.

But that seems like overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach. Since α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄ are roots of the equation, they satisfy x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0.

Therefore, each α_i satisfies α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2.

So, perhaps we can use this relation to reduce higher powers of α_i.

Let me try that. Let's compute each term:

First term: α₁³α₂α₃α₄

= α₁³ * α₂α₃α₄

= α₁³ * (-2 - α₁²) from Vieta's formula, since α₁² + α₂α₁ + α₃α₁ + α₄α₁ = -2, so α₂α₃α₄ = -2 - α₁².

Wait, hold on: Vieta's formula for quartic is x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d = 0.

In our case, a = 2, b = 0, c = 0, d = 2.

So, for any root α_i, α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2.

Similarly, α_i³ = (-2α_i² - 2)/α_i, assuming α_i ≠ 0.

But let's try to see if we can express each term in terms of lower powers.

First, let's compute each term:

1. α₁³α₂α₃α₄

= α₁² * (α₁α₂α₃α₄)

But α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2, from Vieta's formula.

So, this term becomes α₁² * 2 = 2α₁².

2. α₁²α₂²α₃²

= (α₁α₂α₃α₄)^2 = (2)^2 = 4.

3. α₁²α₂²α₄²

= α₁² * (α₂α₄)^2

But (α₂α₄) is part of S₁, which is α₁α₂ + α₃α₄.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps express α₂²α₄² as (α₂α₄)^2.

But from the quartic equation, each root satisfies α_i⁴ = -2α_i³ - 2.

But maybe we can find expressions for α₂α₄.

Wait, α₂α₄: Let's denote this as K.

Similarly, α₁α₃ = M, α₁α₄ = N, α₂α₃ = P.

Wait, since S₁ = M + K, S₂ = N + P, S₃ = L + P, where L = α₁α₄.

Wait, maybe this is not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that the product α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2.

Therefore, α₂α₄ = (2)/α₁α₃.

Hmm, but this may not help directly.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the product α₁²α₂²α₄².

= (α₁α₂α₄)^2

But α₁α₂α₄ can be expressed as:

From Vieta's, we have:

α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2

α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0

α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0

α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2.

So, perhaps we can find α₁α₂α₄ in terms of the known quantities.

But it's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps let me consider the product α₁²α₂²α₄².

Let me note that α₁²α₂²α₄² = (α₁α₂α₄)^2.

But α₁α₂α₄ is equal to (α₁α₂) * α₄.

But α₁α₂ is part of S₂, which is α₁α₃ + α₂α₄.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to now think of the entire product r.

Wait, r is equal to α₁³α₂α₃α₄ + α₁²α₂²α₃² + α₁²α₂²α₄² + α₁α₂³α₃α₄ + α₁²α₃²α₄² + α₁α₂α₃³α₄ + α₁α₂α₃α₄³ + α₂²α₃²α₄².

Wait, that's 8 terms. Let me factor each term.

1. α₁³α₂α₃α₄ = α₁² * α₁α₂α₃α₄ = α₁² * 2 = 2α₁²

2. α₁²α₂²α₃² = (α₁α₂α₃α₄)^2 = 4

3. α₁²α₂²α₄² = α₁² * (α₂α₄)^2

But (α₂α₄) is not directly known, but perhaps we can relate it.

Wait, from Vieta's formula, the sum of products two at a time: α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0.

So, if I denote K = α₂α₄, then the sum α₁α₂ + α₃α₄ + K + α₁α₃ + α₂α₃ = 0.

But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, think of (α₂ + α₄)(α₂α₄) = α₂²α₄ + α₂α₄².

Wait, but that would give me α₂²α₄ + α₂α₄², but in our term we have α₂²α₄², which is different.

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Wait, another approach. Maybe, since all roots satisfy x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0, perhaps we can find expressions for each α_i in terms of trigonometric functions, but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that S₁, S₂, S₃ are symmetric functions, so perhaps their values are the same? Wait, no, that can't be, because the roots are different.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute r = S₁S₂S₃ by using the known symmetric sums.

Wait, another idea: Maybe compute (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) and use the known sums.

Wait, but that seems the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider that S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, S₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃.

So, perhaps S₁, S₂, S₃ are the three products of two roots taken in complementary pairs.

Therefore, they satisfy some relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation whose roots are S₁, S₂, S₃.

Let me denote that equation as x³ + px² + qx + r = 0, where p, q, r are the symmetric sums.

But as we saw before, p = 0, q = -8.

So, the equation would be x³ + 0x² -8x + r = 0 ⇒ x³ -8x + r =0.

If I can find r, then I can write the equation, and the roots would be S₁, S₂, S₃.

But how to find r?

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that if I can find S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃, which is q = -8, and also S₁S₂S₃ = r, which is what we need.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate r to the known sums.

Wait, let's note that:

(S₁ + S₂ + S₃) = 0

(S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃) = -8

And (S₁S₂S₃) = r

So, now, if I can find another symmetric sum, say S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ = -8, and S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0, and then perhaps use Newton's identities or some other method.

Wait, but Newton's identities connect power sums to symmetric sums, but since we have the power sums up to degree 4, perhaps that can help.

Wait, Newton's identities relate the power sums p_k = α₁^k + α₂^k + α₃^k + α₄^k to the elementary symmetric sums.

Given that, perhaps we can compute p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, and then use them to find S₁, S₂, S₃.

But perhaps that's a longer process.

Let me try.

First, p_1 = α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2

p_2 = α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄² = (α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄)^2 - 2(α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄) = (-2)^2 - 2*0 = 4

p_3 = α₁³ + α₂³ + α₃³ + α₄³

We can compute p_3 using the formula:

p_k = (α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄) p_{k-1} - (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄) p_{k-2} + (α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄) p_{k-3} - α₁α₂α₃α₄ p_{k-4}

But for k=3, it's:

p_3 = (-2) p_2 - 0 p_1 + 0 p_0 - 2 p_{-1}

Wait, but p_{-1} is undefined. Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, actually, for k ≥ 1, the formula is:

p_k = (α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄) p_{k-1} - (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄) p_{k-2} + (α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄) p_{k-3} - α₁α₂α₃α₄ p_{k-4}

But for k=3, the formula becomes:

p_3 = (-2) p_2 - 0 p_1 + 0 p_0 - 2 p_{-1}

But p_{-1} is undefined, so perhaps the formula is different. Maybe another way.

Alternatively, since it's a quartic, I can use the recurrence relation:

p_k = -2 p_{k-1} - 0 p_{k-2} + 0 p_{k-3} + 2 p_{k-4}

Wait, let me test this for k=3.

p_3 = -2 p_2 + 0 p_1 + 0 p_0 + 2 p_{-1}

But p_{-1} is undefined. Maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that each α_i satisfies x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0, so α_i^4 = -2α_i³ - 2.

Therefore, for k=4, p_4 = α₁^4 + α₂^4 + α₃^4 + α₄^4 = -2(α₁³ + α₂³ + α₃³ + α₄³) - 8 = -2 p_3 - 8

But we can compute p_3 as well.

Wait, let me compute p_3:

p_3 = α₁³ + α₂³ + α₃³ + α₄³.

But each α_i^3 = (-2α_i² - 2)/α_i, assuming α_i ≠ 0.

So, p_3 = sum_{i=1}^4 [ (-2α_i² - 2)/α_i ] = sum_{i=1}^4 [ -2α_i - 2/α_i ]

= -2 sum_{i=1}^4 α_i - 2 sum_{i=1}^4 1/α_i

We know that sum_{i=1}^4 α_i = -2

And sum_{i=1}^4 1/α_i = (α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄) / (α₁α₂α₃α₄) = 0 / 2 = 0

Therefore, p_3 = -2*(-2) - 2*0 = 4

So, p_3 = 4.

Then, using the recurrence relation for p_k:

p_4 = -2 p_3 - 8 = -2*4 -8 = -8 -8 = -16

Wait, but p_4 is also equal to sum_{i=1}^4 α_i^4, which is equal to -2 p_3 -8 = -2*4 -8 = -8 -8 = -16.

So, p_4 = -16.

Similarly, p_2 is 4, as computed earlier.

So, now, we have p_1 = -2, p_2 = 4, p_3 = 4, p_4 = -16.

Now, perhaps we can use Newton's identities to find S₁, S₂, S₃.

But Newton's identities relate the power sums to the elementary symmetric sums, so maybe we can use them in reverse to express s₁, s₂, s₃ in terms of p₁, p₂, p₃, p₄.

Wait, Newton's identities are:

p_k = s₁ p_{k-1} - s₂ p_{k-2} + s₃ p_{k-3} - s₄ p_{k-4} + ... + (-1)^{k-1} (s₁ p_{k-1} - s₂ p_{k-2} + s₃ p_{k-3} - ... + (-1)^{k-1} s_k p_0)

But for us, since we have p₁, p₂, p₃, p₄, and we need to find s₁, s₂, s₃.

Wait, let me write down the identities for k=2,3,4.

For k=2:

p₂ = s₁ p₁ - 2 s₂

Plug in known values:

4 = s₁*(-2) - 2 s₂

Similarly, for k=3:

p₃ = s₁ p₂ - s₂ p₁ + 3 s₃

Plug in known values:

4 = s₁*4 - s₂*(-2) + 3 s₃

For k=4:

p₄ = s₁ p₃ - s₂ p₂ + s₃ p₁ - 4 s₄

But since s₄ = 0, as we saw earlier.

So, p₄ = s₁*4 - s₂*4 + s₃*(-2)

So, now we have three equations:

1. 4 = -2 s₁ - 2 s₂

2. 4 = 4 s₁ + 2 s₂ + 3 s₃

3. -16 = 4 s₁ - 4 s₂ - 2 s₃

Now, let's write these equations clearly:

Equation 1: -2 s₁ - 2 s₂ = 4 → Divide both sides by -2: s₁ + s₂ = -2

Equation 2: 4 s₁ + 2 s₂ + 3 s₃ = 4

Equation 3: 4 s₁ - 4 s₂ - 2 s₃ = -16

So, from Equation 1: s₁ + s₂ = -2 → s₁ = -2 - s₂

Let me substitute s₁ = -2 - s₂ into Equations 2 and 3.

Equation 2:

4*(-2 - s₂) + 2 s₂ + 3 s₃ = 4

-8 -4 s₂ + 2 s₂ + 3 s₃ = 4

-8 -2 s₂ + 3 s₃ = 4

-2 s₂ + 3 s₃ = 12 → Let's call this Equation 2a.

Equation 3:

4*(-2 - s₂) -4 s₂ -2 s₃ = -16

-8 -4 s₂ -4 s₂ -2 s₃ = -16

-8 -8 s₂ -2 s₃ = -16

-8 s₂ -2 s₃ = -8 → Divide both sides by -2: 4 s₂ + s₃ = 4 → Equation 3a.

Now, we have:

Equation 2a: -2 s₂ + 3 s₃ = 12

Equation 3a: 4 s₂ + s₃ = 4

Let me solve these two equations for s₂ and s₃.

From Equation 3a: s₃ = 4 -4 s₂

Plug into Equation 2a:

-2 s₂ + 3*(4 -4 s₂) =12

-2 s₂ +12 -12 s₂ =12

-14 s₂ +12=12

-14 s₂=0 → s₂=0

Then, from Equation 3a: s₃=4 -4*0=4

So, s₂=0, s₃=4.

Therefore, S₁ = s₁ = -2 - s₂ = -2 -0 = -2.

Thus, the three sums are S₁ = -2, S₂ = 0, S₃ = 4.

Therefore, the set is {-2, 0, 4}.

Let me just verify these results.

Given that, compute S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄ = -2

S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄ = 0

S₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ =4

Let me check if these are consistent.

Also, we can cross-verify using Vieta's.

Alternatively, we can compute S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄ =0.

From the quartic equation, each α_i satisfies x⁴ = -2x³ -2.

So, for α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄, we have:

α₁^4 = -2α₁³ -2

Similarly, α₂^4 = -2α₂³ -2

And so on.

But how can we compute S₂?

Wait, perhaps we can think of symmetric functions. Since S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄.

Is there a way to relate this to other symmetric sums?

Wait, maybe consider that S₂ is the sum over all pairs of roots with one root from the first two and another from the last two.

So, perhaps S₂ is the sum of products of roots two at a time, with one root from the first two and another from the last two.

Alternatively, perhaps think of S₂ as (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄) which is similar to the product (α₁ + α₂)(α₃ + α₄) minus something.

Wait, (α₁ + α₂)(α₃ + α₄) = α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ = S₂ + (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) = S₂ + S₃.

Wait, so (α₁ + α₂)(α₃ + α₄) = S₂ + S₃.

But I don't know the value of (α₁ + α₂)(α₃ + α₄).

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute (α₁ + α₂)(α₃ + α₄) in another way.

Let me denote T = α₁ + α₂, U = α₃ + α₄.

So, T + U = (α₁ + α₂) + (α₃ + α₄) = (α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄) - α₃ - α₄ + (α₃ + α₄) = (-2) - (α₃ + α₄) + (α₃ + α₄) = -2.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, T = α₁ + α₂, U = α₃ + α₄.

Then, T + U = (α₁ + α₂) + (α₃ + α₄) = (α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄) = -2.

But also, (α₁ + α₂)(α₃ + α₄) = S₂ + S₃.

So, T * U = S₂ + S₃ =0 +4=4.

But T + U = -2.

So, T and U are roots of the quadratic equation x² - (T + U)x + T U = x² +2x +4=0.

Wait, discriminant is 4 -16= -12, so T and U are complex numbers.

But can we find T and U? Maybe, but perhaps not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps compute S₂ using another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄.

Let me consider α₁α₃ + α₂α₄.

Let me factor this as α₁α₃ + α₂α₄ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄.

Wait, perhaps think of it as α₁α₃ + α₂α₄ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄.

Wait, considering that.

Alternatively, perhaps express this in terms of known symmetric sums.

Wait, α₁α₃ + α₂α₄ is similar to α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, which is equal to (α₁ + α₂)(α₃ + α₄) - α₁α₄ - α₂α₃.

But we already have that (α₁ + α₂)(α₃ + α₄) =4, so 4 - (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) =4 - S₃ =4 -4=0.

So, that's consistent with S₂=0.

So, that seems okay.

Therefore, the results S₁=-2, S₂=0, S₃=4 are consistent.

Therefore, the set is {-2, 0, 4}.

So, the unordered set is {-2, 0, 4}.

**Final Answer**
The unordered set is \boxed{\{-2, 0, 4\}}.
</think>

Given the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) with roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\), we need to determine the unordered set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\).

Using Vieta's formulas, we know:
1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\)
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\)

We denote:
- \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\)
- \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\)
- \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\)

Using the relationships between the roots and the symmetric sums, we find:
- \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\)
- \(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -8\)
- \(S_1S_2S_3 = r\)

Using Newton's identities and the power sums \(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\) of the roots, we compute:
- \(p_1 = -2\)
- \(p_2 = 4\)
- \(p_3 = 4\)
- \(p_4 = -16\)

Using these power sums, we solve for the symmetric sums \(S_1, S_2, S_3\):
- \(S_1 = -2\)
- \(S_2 = 0\)
- \(S_3 = 4\)

Thus, the unordered set is \(\{-2, 0, 4\}\).

\[
\boxed{\{-2, 0, 4\}}
\]
