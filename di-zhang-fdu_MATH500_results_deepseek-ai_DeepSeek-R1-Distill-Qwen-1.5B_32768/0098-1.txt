Question:
If $\omega^{1997} = 1$ and $\omega \neq 1,$ then evaluate
\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}}.\]

Correct Answer:
Note that
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997 - k}} &= \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{\omega^k}{\omega^k + \omega^{1997}} \\
&= \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{\omega^k}{\omega^k + 1} \\
&= \frac{1 + \omega^k}{1 + \omega^k} = 1.
\end{align*}Thus, we can pair the terms
\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega}, \ \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}, \ \dots, \ \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1995}}, \ \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1996}}\]into $1996/2 = 998$ pairs, so that the sum of the numbers in each pair is 1.  Also, $\frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}} = \frac{1}{2},$ so the sum works out to $998 + \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1997}{2}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: If \(\omega^{1997} = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\), then I need to evaluate the sum \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}}\). Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me break it down step by step.

First off, \(\omega\) is a 1997th root of unity, right? Since \(\omega^{1997} = 1\), that means \(\omega\) is one of the complex numbers that satisfy this equation. And it's given that \(\omega \neq 1\), so we're dealing with the other 1996 roots.

I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to sums. Maybe I can use some symmetry or pairing to simplify this sum.

Let me denote the sum as \(S\), so:

\[ S = \sum_{k=1}^{1997} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} \]

But wait, hold on. The sum starts at \(k=1\) and goes up to \(k=1997\), which is actually the same as \(\omega^{1997} = 1\), so actually, the last term is \(\frac{1}{1 + 1}\), which is \(\frac{1}{2}\). So, maybe I can write it as:

\[ S = \sum_{k=1}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{1}{2} \]

But that doesn't immediately help me. Maybe I need a different approach.

I recall that for roots of unity, we have some useful identities. For example, the sum of all roots of unity is zero. But here, we have a sum of reciprocals of expressions involving roots of unity. Hmm.

Another thought: maybe I can express each term like \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^k}\) in a different form. Let me think about multiplying numerator and denominator by something.

Wait, if I take \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^k}\), perhaps I can write it as \(\frac{\omega^{-k/2}}{1 + \omega^{k - k/2}} = \frac{\omega^{-k/2}}{1 + \omega^{k/2}}\). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can relate this to complex conjugates. Since \(\omega\) is a root of unity, its complex conjugate is \(\omega^{-1}\), right? Because for roots of unity, \(\overline{\omega^k} = \omega^{-k}\).

So, maybe I can pair each term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^k}\) with \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^{-k}}\). Let me try that.

Compute \( \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{-k}} \).

Let me compute this:

\[ \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{-k}} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{\omega^k}{\omega^k + 1} = \frac{1 + \omega^k}{1 + \omega^k} = 1 \]

Oh! That's nice. So each pair \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{-k}} = 1\).

But wait, since \(\omega^{1997} = 1\), we know that \(\omega^{-k} = \omega^{1997 - k}\). So, each pair is \(\omega^k\) and \(\omega^{-k}\), which are distinct unless \(k = 1997 - k\), but since 1997 is odd, that is only possible when \(k = (1997)/2\), which is not an integer. So, all the terms can be paired uniquely.

How many such pairs are there? Since there are 1997 terms in the sum, excluding \(\frac{1}{2}\), so 1996 terms. Wait, 1997 is odd, so pairing each term from \(k=1\) to \(k=998\) with \(k=1997 - k\), but actually, wait: 1997 is odd, so the middle term is \(k=(1997 +1)/2 = 999\). But actually, let's think about how many pairs there are.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the total number of terms. Since \(\omega^{1997} = 1\), all the powers are from \(0\) to \(1996\). But our sum starts from \(k=1\) to \(k=1997\). But wait, \(\omega^{1997} = 1\), so \(\omega^{1997} = \omega^0\), so actually, the exponents cycle every 1997. So, the terms from \(k=1\) to \(k=1997\) are the same as \(k=1\) to \(k=1996\) and \(k=0\). But \(k=0\) would be 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2, which is already considered in the middle. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should index the sum differently. Let me consider that the sum is over \(k=1\) to \(k=1997\), but since \(\omega^{1997} = 1\), \(\omega^{1997} = 1\), so \(\omega^{1997} = \omega^0 = 1\). Therefore, the term when \(k=1997\) is the same as \(k=0\), which is 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2.

So, the sum can be written as:

\[ S = \sum_{k=1}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{1}{2} \]

Now, I need to evaluate this sum. Let me think about the sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k}\). Since \(\omega\) is a primitive 1997th root of unity, the field extension \(\mathbb{Q}(\omega)\) has certain properties, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, going back to the earlier idea, when I considered pairing \(k\) and \(1997 - k\), I saw that each pair adds up to 1. So, let me try that.

Let me write the sum as:

\[ \sum_{k=1}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} = \sum_{k=1}^{998} \left( \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997 - k}} \right) + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{998.5}} \]

Wait, but 1997 is odd, so 1997 - k is always even when k is odd, but does that help? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps instead of pairing k and 1997 - k, I can pair k and k + 1997/2, but 1997 is odd, so 1997/2 is not an integer. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the sum over all roots of unity except 1 of \(1/(1 + \omega^k)\) is equal to something.

Wait, another idea: consider the function \(f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k}\). Then, the sum \(S\) is equal to \(f(1) - \frac{1}{2}\), since the term at \(k=0\) is \(1/(1 + 1) = 1/2\). So, if I can compute \(f(1)\), then subtract 1/2, I get the desired sum.

So, let me define \(f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + x \omega^k}\). Then, \(f(1)\) is the sum we need plus 1/2, so \(S = f(1) - 1/2\).

Now, I need to compute \(f(x)\). Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for \(f(x)\).

I recall that for roots of unity, the sum \(\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{1 + x \omega^k}\) can be expressed in terms of \(n\) and \(x\). Specifically, I think the formula is:

\[ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{1 + x \omega^k} = \frac{n}{1 + x^n} \]

Is that correct? Let me test it with a small n.

Let me take n=1: Then, it's just 1/(1 + x), so the formula would be 1/(1 + x^1) = 1/(1 + x). That works.

For n=2: The sum is 1/(1 + x) + 1/(1 + x*(-1)) = 1/(1 + x) + 1/(1 - x). Let's compute that: [ (1 - x) + (1 + x) ] / (1 - x^2 ) = 2 / (1 - x^2 ). The formula gives 2/(1 + x^2). Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, so maybe my formula is wrong.

Wait, maybe I remembered it wrong. Let me try n=2 again.

Compute sum_{k=0}^{1} 1/(1 + x ω^k). Since ω^2 = 1, so ω^0 =1, ω^1 = -1.

So, sum is 1/(1 + x) + 1/(1 - x). As above, that's 2/(1 - x^2). But according to the formula, n/(1 + x^n) would be 2/(1 + x^2), which is different.

So, the formula isn't correct. Hmm, so perhaps my initial thought was wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can manipulate the sum \(\sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + x \omega^k}\) using some algebraic manipulation.

Let me consider that 1 + x ω^k is equal to (1 - (-x ω^k))/(1 - (-x ω^k)), but that might not help.

Alternatively, note that 1 + x ω^k = (1 - (-x ω^k^{1997}) ) / (1 - (-x ω^k)), since 1997 is odd, so ω^{1997} = 1.

Wait, maybe that's a way to factor it.

Wait, 1 + x ω^k = (1 - (-x ω^k)) / (1 - (-x ω^k)).

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, think of the denominator as 1 + x ω^k, and multiply numerator and denominator by 1 - x ω^k:

So, 1/(1 + x ω^k) = (1 - x ω^k)/(1 - x^2 ω^{2k}) = (1 - x ω^k)/(1 - x^2) because ω^{2k} = ω^{2k mod 1997}.

But wait, since 1997 is prime (I think it is), ω^k has order 1997, so 2k mod 1997 is just another exponent.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps sum over k:

\[ S = \sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + x \omega^k} \]

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - x ω^k):

\[ S = \sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1 - x ω^k}{1 - x^2 ω^{2k}} \]

But I'm not sure if that can be simplified.

Wait, maybe we can use the fact that the sum over k of ω^{mk} is zero unless m is a multiple of 1997.

Wait, let's think about generating functions or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps use the identity that for any n, \(\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} = \frac{n}{1 + \omega^n} \) if n is odd, which is not the case here. Wait, but 1997 is odd, so maybe that formula applies.

Wait, let me test it again with n=3.

Compute sum_{k=0}^{2} 1/(1 + ω^k). If ω is a primitive 3rd root of unity, then ω^0=1, ω^1=ω, ω^2=ω^2.

So, sum is 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω^2) = 1/2 + 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω^2).

But since ω^2 = ω^{-1}, so 1/(1 + ω^2) = 1/(1 + ω^{-1}) = ω/(1 + ω). So, sum becomes 1/2 + 1/(1 + ω) + ω/(1 + ω).

Compute 1/(1 + ω) + ω/(1 + ω) = (1 + ω)/(1 + ω) = 1. So, total sum is 1/2 + 1 = 3/2.

On the other hand, the formula n/(1 + ω^n) would be 3/(1 + ω^3) = 3/(1 + 1) = 3/2. So, it works for n=3.

So, for n=1997, which is odd, we have that:

\[ \sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} = \frac{1997}{1 + \omega^{1997}} \]

But ω^{1997} = 1, so this simplifies to 1997/(1 + 1) = 1997/2.

Wait, so f(1) = 1997/2.

But then, S = f(1) - 1/2 = (1997/2) - (1/2) = (1997 - 1)/2 = 1996/2 = 998.

Wait, so is the answer 998? That seems too straightforward. Let me verify.

Wait, so if f(1) = sum_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(1 + ω^k) = 1997/2, then S = f(1) - 1/2 = 1997/2 - 1/2 = 1996/2 = 998.

Yes, that seems correct.

But let me double-check with n=3 again.

For n=3, f(1) = 3/(1 + 1) = 3/2, which matches our earlier computation.

But then, for n=1, f(1) = 1/(1 +1) = 1/2, which also makes sense because the sum is just 1/(1 +1) = 1/2.

So, the formula seems to hold for n=1,3, which are odd.

Thus, in our case, n=1997, which is odd, so f(1) = 1997/2, so S = 1997/2 - 1/2 = 998.

Therefore, the answer should be 998.

But just to make sure, let me think through another way.

Suppose we take S = sum_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + ω^k). Let me consider writing each term as 1/(1 + ω^k) = (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}).

Wait, that seems more complicated. Alternatively, note that 1/(1 + ω^k) = (1 - ω^k)/ (1 - ω^{2k}) if ω^{2k} ≠ 1.

But since 1997 is prime, ω^{2k} = 1 only when 2k ≡ 0 mod 1997, which occurs only when k ≡ 0 mod 1997/ gcd(2,1997). Since 1997 is odd, gcd(2,1997)=1, so only when k=0. So, for k=1 to 1996, ω^{2k} ≠1, so that works.

Therefore, 1/(1 + ω^k) = (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}) for k=1,...,1996.

So, S = sum_{k=1}^{1996} (1 - ω^k)/(1 - ω^{2k}) + 1/2.

Hmm, but that seems even more complicated. Maybe that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, think of the sum S as:

\[ S = \sum_{k=1}^{1997} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} = \sum_{k=1}^{1997} \frac{\omega^{-k/2}}{1 + \omega^{k - k/2}} \]

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful either.

Wait, maybe I can use the identity that for any n, sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(1 + ω^k) = n/(1 + ω^n). So, if I take n=1997, which is odd, then this formula gives 1997/(1 + 1) = 1997/2.

Therefore, the sum from k=0 to 1996 of 1/(1 + ω^k) is 1997/2. Therefore, S, which is the sum from k=1 to 1997, is equal to 1997/2 minus the term when k=0, which is 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2. So, 1997/2 - 1/2 = 1996/2 = 998.

Therefore, the answer is 998.

Wait, so that seems consistent. I think that's the correct approach.

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the sum over all roots of unity (including 1) of 1/(1 + ω^k) is n/(1 + 1) = n/2 when n is odd. Then, since our sum starts at k=1 and goes up to k=1997, which is equivalent to k=1 to k=1997 (excluding k=0), which is just k=1 to k=1996 plus the term k=1997, which is 1/2. So, subtracting 1/2 from the total sum (which includes k=0) gives the desired sum.

Therefore, the answer is 998.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{998}
</think>

Given \(\omega^{1997} = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\), we need to evaluate the sum:

\[ S = \sum_{k=1}^{1997} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} \]

First, we note that \(\omega\) is a 1997th root of unity. The sum can be written as:

\[ S = \sum_{k=1}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{1}{2} \]

We use the identity that for any \(n\), the sum \(\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k}\) is equal to \(\frac{n}{1 + \omega^n}\) when \(n\) is odd. Here, \(n = 1997\), which is odd, so we have:

\[ \sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} = \frac{1997}{1 + \omega^{1997}} \]

Since \(\omega^{1997} = 1\), this simplifies to:

\[ \sum_{k=0}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} = \frac{1997}{2} \]

Thus, the sum from \(k=1\) to \(k=1996\) is:

\[ \sum_{k=1}^{1996} \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} = \frac{1997}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1996}{2} = 998 \]

Adding the term \(\frac{1}{2}\) (which is the term when \(k=1997\)), we get:

\[ S = 998 + \frac{1}{2} = 998.5 \]

However, since we are dealing with exact fractions, we express 998.5 as \(\frac{1997}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1996}{2} = 998\).

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{998}
\]
