Question:
In the circle with center $Q$, radii $AQ$ and $BQ$ form a right angle. The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, as shown. The radius of the circle with center $Q$ is 14 inches. What is the radius of the smaller semicircle? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Correct Answer:
Let $C$ and $D$ be the centers of the larger and smaller semicircles, respectively, and let $r$ be the radius of the smaller semicircle.  We have $QD=QB-DB=14-r$ and $QC=7$, so we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $QCD$ to obtain  \[
(14-r)^2+7^2=(7+r)^2.
\] After squaring both binomials and subtracting $7^2+r^2$ from both sides simplifies to $196-28r=14r$.  Adding $28r$ to both sides and dividing by 42, we find $r=\boxed{\frac{14}{3}}$ inches.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it step by step. There's a circle with center Q, and radii AQ and BQ form a right angle. So, that means the two radii are perpendicular to each other, right? So, if I imagine the circle, center Q is the center, and from Q, there are two radii, AQ and BQ, which are at 90 degrees to each other. That must mean that points A and B are on the circle, separated by a quarter of the circumference. 

Now, the problem says that there are two smaller regions that are tangent semicircles. Hmm, okay. So, if I have AQ and BQ as radii, and they form a right angle, then the angle at Q is 90 degrees. So, the circle is divided into four equal quadrants by these two radii. Each of those quadrants is a quarter-circle. But wait, the problem mentions two smaller regions that are tangent semicircles. So, maybe the circle is actually divided into two semicircles, but somehow the semicircles are tangent to each other or something.

Wait, maybe the two smaller regions are not the four quadrants but two semicircles? Let me think. If I have AQ and BQ as radii forming a right angle, then maybe the circle is divided into two semicircles, each with a radius of 14 inches. But the problem says there are two smaller regions, so maybe the circle is divided into two regions by a line that's connecting points A and B, creating two regions. But since AQ and BQ form a right angle, that line AB would be the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with legs of length 14 each. So, the length of AB would be 14√2, right? Because in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is sqrt(a² + b²). So, that's 14√2. 

But how does that relate to the two smaller regions being tangent semicircles? Maybe the two semicircles are each tangent to the main circle and to each other? So, perhaps there's a semicircle inside the quarter-circle (the region bounded by AQ and BQ) that's tangent to both AQ and BQ, and also tangent to the other semicircle. 

Wait, perhaps it's similar to the classic problem where you have two circles tangent to each other and tangent to a line, so maybe here it's two semicircles tangent to each other and to the two radii AQ and BQ. So, the two semicircles are each in the corners of the quarter-circle and tangent to each other. 

Let me sketch this mentally. We have a quarter-circle with center Q, radius 14. Inside it, there are two smaller semicircles. Each semicircle is tangent to the sides AQ and BQ, as well as tangent to each other. So, each semicircle is in one of the two opposite quadrants. 

Wait, but the quarter-circle is 90 degrees. So, if there are two smaller regions, perhaps each semicircle is in one of the two smaller quadrants? But a quarter-circle is 90 degrees, which is divided into two smaller regions by a line from the center. So, maybe the two smaller regions are each 45 degrees? Hmm, but the problem says semicircles. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of tangent semicircles. 

Alternatively, perhaps the two smaller semicircles are each tangent to AQ and BQ and also each tangent to the main circle. So, each semicircle is inside the main quarter-circle, tangent to two sides, and also tangent to the main circle. That would make sense. So, each semicircle is in one of the two smaller regions created by the quarter-circle and the line AB, which is the hypotenuse. 

So, if that's the case, then each semicircle touches AQ, BQ, and the main circle. So, to find the radius of the smaller semicircle, let's denote the radius as r. 

Let me try to model this. So, we have a quarter-circle with radius 14, and two semicircles inside, each with radius r. Each semicircle is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle. So, the centers of these semicircles must be at a distance r from AQ and BQ, right? Since the semicircles are tangent to those sides.

Wait, but since AQ and BQ are radii of the main circle, which is centered at Q, the centers of the smaller semicircles must lie somewhere inside the quarter-circle. Let me think about the coordinate system. Let me place point Q at the origin (0,0), point A at (14,0), and point B at (0,14). So, the quarter-circle is in the first quadrant, bounded by the x-axis, y-axis, and the line AB.

Now, the two smaller semicircles are each tangent to the x-axis, y-axis, and the quarter-circle. So, each semicircle is in the corner near A and near B, each tangent to the two sides and also tangent to the main quarter-circle. So, the problem is symmetric, so both semicircles have the same radius r. 

So, let's focus on one of the semicircles, say the one near point A. Its center must lie somewhere along the line y = x, because it's equidistant from both the x-axis and y-axis, and it's tangent to both. Similarly, the other semicircle near B will have its center along the line y = x as well. 

Wait, actually, no. If the semicircle is tangent to both AQ and BQ, which are the x-axis and y-axis, respectively, then the center of the semicircle must be at a distance r from both axes. So, for the semicircle near A, its center is at (r, r). Similarly, the semicircle near B has its center at (14 - r, r), because it needs to be tangent to the y-axis as well.

Wait, hold on. If the semicircle near A is tangent to the x-axis and y-axis, its center is at (r, r). Similarly, the semicircle near B is tangent to the y-axis and x-axis, so its center is at (14 - r, r). 

But now, these two semicircles are also tangent to each other. So, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum of their radii. But wait, the semicircles are tangent, so the distance between centers is equal to the sum of their radii. But in this case, both semicircles have the same radius r, so the distance between their centers should be 2r.

But let's calculate the distance between (r, r) and (14 - r, r). That distance is sqrt[(14 - r - r)^2 + (r - r)^2] = sqrt[(14 - 2r)^2 + 0] = |14 - 2r|. Since both centers are in positive quadrants, it's 14 - 2r.

But since they are externally tangent, the distance between centers should be equal to 2r. So, 14 - 2r = 2r. Therefore, 14 = 4r, so r = 14/4 = 7/2 = 3.5. So, the radius is 3.5 inches, which is 7/2.

Wait, hold on, but wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.

So, we have two semicircles, each with radius r, tangent to both AQ, BQ, and the main quarter-circle. The centers of these semicircles are at (r, r) and (14 - r, r). The distance between centers is sqrt[(14 - 2r)^2 + 0] = 14 - 2r. Since they are externally tangent, the distance between centers is 2r. So, 14 - 2r = 2r, so 14 = 4r, so r = 3.5 or 7/2.

Wait, but hold on, is the distance between centers 14 - 2r? Because the centers are at (r, r) and (14 - r, r). So, the x-coordinate difference is (14 - r) - r = 14 - 2r, and y-coordinate difference is 0. So, yes, the distance is 14 - 2r. Since they are externally tangent, that distance should equal the sum of radii, which is r + r = 2r. So, 14 - 2r = 2r, so 14 = 4r, so r = 14/4 = 7/2. So, 7/2 inches, which is 3.5 inches.

Wait, but 7/2 is 3.5, which is less than 14, so that makes sense.

But let me make sure that the semicircles don't extend beyond the main circle.

So, the main circle has radius 14, and the semicircles have radius 7/2, which is 3.5. So, the distance from the center Q to the center of the semicircle is sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = sqrt(2r^2) = r*sqrt(2). So, the distance from Q to the center of the semicircle is (7/2)*sqrt(2) ≈ 4.95, which is less than 14, so that's fine. So, the semicircles are entirely inside the main circle.

So, the distance between the centers is 14 - 2r, which is 14 - 7 = 7, which is equal to 2r, which is 7, so yes, that works out.

Wait, but I just want to make sure that the semicircles are actually tangent to the main circle. So, the distance from Q to the center of a semicircle is sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = r*sqrt(2) ≈ 4.95, and the radius of the main circle is 14. The distance from Q to the center of the semicircle plus the radius of the semicircle should be equal to the radius of the main circle if they are tangent externally. But in this case, the semicircles are inside the main circle, so maybe the distance from Q to center of semicircle plus radius of semicircle equals radius of main circle.

Wait, let me think. If two circles are tangent externally, the distance between centers is sum of radii. But if two circles are tangent internally, the distance between centers is difference of radii.

In this case, our main circle is the larger circle, and the semicircles are inside it, so they are internally tangent. So, the distance between centers is equal to 14 - r, where r is the radius of the semicircle.

Wait, hold on. So, in our earlier reasoning, we thought of the distance between centers as 14 - 2r, but if it's internally tangent, the distance between centers should be equal to 14 - r.

Wait, so which is it? Let's clarify.

If the semicircle is inside the main circle, and tangent to it, then yes, the distance between centers is equal to 14 - r. But in our case, we have two semicircles, each with radius r, and the distance between their centers is 14 - 2r, as we found earlier.

So, we have 14 - 2r = 14 - r, which would give 14 - 2r = 14 - r, meaning that -2r = -r, so r = 0, which is not possible. So, that can't be right. So, that suggests that my initial reasoning was wrong.

Wait, so perhaps I confused internal and external tangent.

Wait, so if the two semicircles are tangent to each other and also tangent to the main circle, then the distance between centers is 14 - r, because they are internally tangent.

But earlier, I thought that the distance between centers is 14 - 2r because the semicircles are in the corners. But maybe that's incorrect.

Wait, let me think again.

Each semicircle is tangent to the main circle, so the distance from Q to the center of the semicircle plus the semicircle's radius should equal the main circle's radius.

So, if the semicircle is tangent to the main circle, then distance from Q to center of semicircle plus r equals 14.

But in our coordinate system, the center of the semicircle near A is at (r, r). So, the distance from Q to that center is sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = r*sqrt(2). So, we have r*sqrt(2) + r = 14.

So, r(sqrt(2) + 1) = 14, so r = 14 / (sqrt(2) + 1). 

To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(2) - 1):

r = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) / [(sqrt(2) + 1)(sqrt(2) - 1)] = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/(2 - 1) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

So, r = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1). That's approximately 14*(1.4142 - 1) = 14*0.4142 ≈ 5.798, which is about 5.8 inches. But wait, earlier, I thought it was 3.5 inches, which is conflicting.

But wait, maybe I confused internal and external tangents. So, if the semicircles are tangent to the main circle, that would require that the distance from Q to the center of the semicircle plus the radius of the semicircle equals 14.

But in the problem statement, it says, "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." So, perhaps they are tangent to each other and to the main circle. So, yes, the distance from Q to the center of each semicircle is r*sqrt(2), and the distance between centers is 14 - r. So, set 14 - r = r*sqrt(2). So, 14 = r + r*sqrt(2) = r(1 + sqrt(2)). Therefore, r = 14 / (1 + sqrt(2)).

Which is the same as before, so rationalizing, it's 14*(sqrt(2) - 1). So, approximately 14*(0.4142) ≈ 5.798 inches. But that's conflicting with the earlier answer.

Wait, but in my initial approach, I considered the centers of the semicircles to be (r, r) and (14 - r, r), and the distance between them is 14 - 2r, which I set equal to 2r because they are externally tangent. But that led to r = 7/2, which is 3.5, conflicting with the other approach.

So, to resolve this, I need to figure out whether the two semicircles are externally tangent or internally tangent.

Looking back at the problem statement: "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." The regions are inside the quarter-circle, so the semicircles are inside the main circle, and the quarter-circle is divided into two regions by the line AB. So, the two semicircles are inside the quarter-circle, so the distance between their centers is 14 - 2r, but also, the distance from Q to each center is r*sqrt(2), and since the semicircles are tangent to the main circle, the distance from Q to each center plus the radius of the semicircle should be equal to 14.

Therefore, the correct equation is:

sqrt(r^2 + r^2) + r = 14

Which is:

r*sqrt(2) + r = 14

Factor out r:

r(sqrt(2) + 1) = 14

Therefore, r = 14 / (sqrt(2) + 1)

Which, as I did earlier, is 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) = 14*0.4142 ≈ 5.798 inches.

But wait, in my first approach, I thought that the distance between centers was 14 - 2r, which should have been 2r because the semicircles are externally tangent. But actually, that is incorrect because the semicircles are tangent to the main circle, so the distance from Q to center of semicircle plus radius of semicircle equals 14, not the distance between centers.

So, that suggests that the correct radius is 14/(sqrt(2) + 1) ≈ 5.8 inches.

But hold on, that seems large because the quarter-circle is 14 inches, so the semicircles can't be larger than that. Wait, 5.8 is less than 14, so that's okay.

Wait, but let me test: If r is 14/(sqrt(2) + 1), then sqrt(2)*r + r = 14. So, 14/(sqrt(2) + 1)*(sqrt(2) + 1) = 14, which is correct.

So, actually, that seems consistent.

But earlier, when I thought the distance between centers was 14 - 2r, but that was incorrect because the semicircles are tangent to the main circle, not to each other. So, the correct equation is that the distance from Q to center of semicircle plus radius of semicircle = main circle's radius.

So, that gives us r = 14/(sqrt(2) + 1). To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(2) - 1):

r = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/[(sqrt(2) + 1)(sqrt(2) - 1)] = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/(2 - 1) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

So, r = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1). That's approximately 14*(1.4142 - 1) = 14*0.4142 ≈ 5.798 inches.

But the problem asks for the radius of the smaller semicircle. So, is this correct?

Wait, but 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) is approximately 5.798, which is a reasonable number less than 14.

Wait, but in my first approach, I thought the distance between centers was 14 - 2r, but that was wrong because the semicircles are not externally tangent to each other, but each is tangent to the main circle.

So, the correct answer is 14/(sqrt(2) + 1), which is 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

Alternatively, that can be written as 14*sqrt(2) - 14.

But let me see if that's the answer or if I messed up.

Alternatively, maybe the centers of the semicircles are not located at (r, r) and (14 - r, r). Maybe I made a mistake there.

Wait, in the coordinate system, if the semicircle is tangent to both AQ and BQ, which are the x-axis and y-axis, then the center must be at (r, r). So, that seems correct.

So, the distance from Q to center is r*sqrt(2). So, then, the distance from center to main circle is 14 - r*sqrt(2). But since the semicircle is tangent to the main circle, that distance should be equal to the radius of the semicircle, which is r.

Wait, no, that's not the case. Because the distance from Q to center of semicircle is r*sqrt(2), and the distance from center of semicircle to main circle is 14 - r*sqrt(2). But since they are tangent, 14 - r*sqrt(2) should equal r, because the main circle's radius is 14, and the distance from the center of the semicircle to the main circle's center is 14 - r*sqrt(2), and that should equal the radius of the main circle's segment, which is r.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The main circle's radius is 14, and the distance from Q to the center of the semicircle is r*sqrt(2). Since the semicircle is inside the main circle, the distance from Q to the center of the semicircle plus the radius of the semicircle should equal the main circle's radius. So, r*sqrt(2) + r = 14. That's the correct equation.

So, that gives us:

r = 14 / (sqrt(2) + 1) ≈ 5.798 inches.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to rationalize the denominator:

r = 14 / (1 + sqrt(2)) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/[(1 + sqrt(2))(sqrt(2) - 1)] = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/(2 - 1) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

So, r = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

Simplify that:

sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, so sqrt(2) - 1 ≈ 0.4142, so r ≈ 14*0.4142 ≈ 5.798 inches.

So, that seems correct.

But then, let me think again about whether the distance between centers is 14 - 2r or 14 - r.

If the semicircles are tangent to each other, then the distance between centers is 2r, right? But in this case, the semicircles are inside the quarter-circle, so the distance between centers should be equal to 14 - r, because the semicircles are inside the main circle, so the distance from Q to center of semicircle plus radius of semicircle should equal 14.

Wait, now I'm confused again.

Wait, no, if the semicircles are tangent to each other, their centers are separated by 2r, but both centers are at a distance of r*sqrt(2) from Q, so the distance between the centers is sqrt[(14 - 2r)^2 + 0] = 14 - 2r, which equals 2r. So, 14 - 2r = 2r, so 14 = 4r, so r = 14/4 = 7/2 = 3.5 inches.

But that contradicts the fact that the distance from Q to center is r*sqrt(2), which is about 4.95, and the distance from center to main circle is 14 - 4.95 ≈ 9.05, which is way larger than the radius r = 3.5. So, 3.5 is way smaller than 9.05, so that can't be.

Therefore, the correct equation is that the distance from Q to center of semicircle is r*sqrt(2), and the distance from center to main circle is 14 - r*sqrt(2), and since the semicircle is tangent to main circle, 14 - r*sqrt(2) should equal the radius of the main circle's segment, which is r. So, 14 - r*sqrt(2) = r, so 14 = r + r*sqrt(2) = r(1 + sqrt(2)), so r = 14/(1 + sqrt(2)).

So, that's 14*(sqrt(2) - 1), which is approximately 5.798 inches, which is the radius of the smaller semicircle.

Wait, but since the main circle is 14 inches, and the semicircle is 5.798 inches, which is less than 14, so that seems fine.

But then, 5.798 inches is roughly equal to 5.8 inches, so that seems correct.

But wait, 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) is the same as 14*(sqrt(2) - 1). Let me compute 14*(sqrt(2) - 1):

sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142, so sqrt(2) - 1 ≈ 0.4142, so 14*0.4142 ≈ 5.798 inches.

So, 5.798 inches is approximately 5.8 inches.

But, just to confirm, let me compute 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) numerically:

1 + sqrt(2) ≈ 2.4142

14 / 2.4142 ≈ 5.798 inches.

Yes, so that seems correct.

But wait, the problem says the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, so maybe the radius is approximately 5.8 inches, but expressed as a common fraction.

Wait, 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) is an exact value, but maybe can be expressed as 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) inches.

But let me check if the problem expects a fractional answer or a radical. The problem says "express your answer as a common fraction," so perhaps 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) is not a common fraction, but maybe I can rationalize it differently.

Wait, 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) is equal to 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/( (1 + sqrt(2))(sqrt(2) - 1) ) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/1 = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1). So, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, if the problem expects an answer in terms of a fraction, perhaps it's better to rationalize:

14/(1 + sqrt(2)) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/ ( (1 + sqrt(2))(sqrt(2) - 1) ) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/1 = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1). So, 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps they expect the answer in a different form.

But let me think again, is my reasoning correct? Because if I think about the triangle formed by centers of the main circle and the two semicircles, the sides are 14, and the two sides are 14 - r*sqrt(2), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as a right triangle. The centers of the main circle and the two semicircle centers form a triangle. The distance between the centers of the main circle and one semicircle is 14 - r*sqrt(2), and the distance between the centers of the two semicircles is 2r.

Wait, but the triangle is not a right triangle, because the centers of the semicircles are at (r, r) and (14 - r, r), so the distance between them is 14 - 2r, and the distance from main circle center to each is r*sqrt(2). So, it's a triangle with sides r*sqrt(2), r*sqrt(2), and 14 - 2r, with the two equal sides being r*sqrt(2) and the base being 14 - 2r.

But since the two semicircles are tangent to each other, the distance between their centers is 2r, so 14 - 2r = 2r, leading to 14 = 4r, so r = 3.5 inches. But that contradicts the earlier reasoning.

Wait, this is confusing because depending on how you model it, you get different answers.

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that the two semicircles are tangent to each other and tangent to the main circle.

So, each semicircle is tangent to the main circle, so the distance from Q to center of semicircle plus radius is equal to 14. The two semicircles are also tangent to each other, so the distance between their centers is 2r.

So, if I denote the distance from Q to center of semicircle as d, then d + r = 14.

But in this case, the centers of the semicircles are located at (r, r) and (14 - r, r). So, the distance from Q to each center is sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = r*sqrt(2). So, we have:

r*sqrt(2) + r = 14

Which leads to r(sqrt(2) + 1) = 14

Thus, r = 14/(sqrt(2) + 1) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/( (sqrt(2) + 1)(sqrt(2) - 1) ) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/1 = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

So, that's approximately 5.798, which is a valid radius.

But the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." So, why is it called "smaller regions"? Because both semicircles are equal, so perhaps it's referring to the two semicircles, each of radius r, which are tangent to each other and to the main circle.

So, perhaps the answer is 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) inches, which is approximately 5.798 inches.

But the problem says to express it as a common fraction. Hmm, 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) is not a common fraction. So, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps instead of the distance from Q to center being r*sqrt(2), it's something else.

Wait, no, because if a semicircle is tangent to both AQ and BQ, which are the x-axis and y-axis, the center must be at (r, r). So, the distance from Q to center is sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = r*sqrt(2). So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about two semicircles but two circles. Because if it was two circles, then the distance between centers would be 2r, but since it's semicircles, it's different.

Wait, but the problem says semicircles. So, maybe the distance between centers is 2r, and the distance from Q to each center is r*sqrt(2). So, 14 - 2r = sqrt(2)*r, so 14 = r(2 + sqrt(2)), so r = 14/(2 + sqrt(2)).

Simplify that: 14/(2 + sqrt(2)) = 14*(2 - sqrt(2))/[(2 + sqrt(2))(2 - sqrt(2))] = 14*(2 - sqrt(2))/ (4 - 2) = 14*(2 - sqrt(2))/2 = 7*(2 - sqrt(2)) = 14 - 7*sqrt(2).

But 14 - 7*sqrt(2) is approximately 14 - 9.899 ≈ 4.101 inches, which is a different value.

Wait, so now I'm really confused. Depending on whether the distance between centers is 2r (the semicircles being externally tangent) or 14 - 2r (the semicircles being internally tangent), the result is different.

So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous. But the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles," so maybe they are referring to the two smaller regions, each of which is a semicircle. So, each region is a semicircle, tangent to the main circle and to each other.

Therefore, each semicircle is tangent to the main circle and to the other semicircle. So, the distance between centers is 2r, and the distance from Q to each center is r*sqrt(2). So, the distance from Q to each center is r*sqrt(2), so the distance from each center to the main circle is 14 - r*sqrt(2). But since the semicircles are tangent to the main circle, this distance should equal the radius of the semicircles, which is r. So:

14 - r*sqrt(2) = r

Thus, 14 = r + r*sqrt(2) = r(1 + sqrt(2))

Therefore, r = 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/ ( (1 + sqrt(2))(sqrt(2) - 1) ) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/1 = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

So, that's approximately 5.798 inches.

But 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) is approximately 5.798, but 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) is the same as that.

But let's compute 14/(1 + sqrt(2)):

Multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(2) - 1):

14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/ (1 + sqrt(2))(sqrt(2) - 1) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/ (2 - 1) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

So, that's the exact value.

But 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) is equal to 14*sqrt(2) - 14, which is approximately 19.798 - 14 = 5.798 inches.

So, unless the problem expects the answer in the form of 14*(sqrt(2) - 1), or 14/(sqrt(2) + 1), both are correct, but perhaps 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) is the more precise exact form.

But the problem says, "express your answer as a common fraction." Hmm, so 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) is not a common fraction, which is a ratio of two integers. So, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier. Maybe the regions are not semicircles tangent to the main circle, but something else.

Wait, the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." So, maybe each region is a semicircle, and those two semicircles are tangent to each other and tangent to the main circle.

Wait, but in that case, each semicircle is a region, so each is tangent to the main circle, and tangent to the other semicircle.

So, if each semicircle is tangent to the main circle, then the distance from Q to center of semicircle is r*sqrt(2), and the distance from center of semicircle to main circle is 14 - r*sqrt(2), which equals r, because the semicircle is tangent to the main circle.

So, 14 - r*sqrt(2) = r, so 14 = r(1 + sqrt(2)), so r = 14/(1 + sqrt(2)), as before.

But that's an exact value, but it's irrational, so it can't be expressed as a common fraction, which is a rational number. So, that suggests that my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe the two smaller regions are actually two quarter-circles, but the problem says semicircles. Wait, maybe each of the regions is a semicircle, but they are each tangent to the main circle and to the other region.

Wait, perhaps the two semicircles are each tangent to the main circle and each other, but not necessarily tangent to the sides AQ and BQ.

Wait, but the problem says the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, which probably implies they are tangent to each other and to the main circle. So, maybe each of the regions is a semicircle tangent to the main circle and to the other region.

So, in that case, each semicircle is tangent to the main circle and to the other semicircle, so the distance between centers is 2r, and the distance from each center to main circle is 14 - r, which should be equal to the radius of the main circle's segment, which is r.

Wait, so 14 - r = r, so 14 = 2r, so r = 7 inches. But that can't be, because the main circle is only 14 inches in radius, so a semicircle of 7 inches radius is half of that, but the regions are supposed to be smaller.

Wait, that can't be. So, maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the two semicircles are each tangent to the main circle and to the sides AQ and BQ, but not necessarily to each other.

Wait, if each semicircle is tangent to the main circle and the sides AQ and BQ, then the distance from Q to center of semicircle is r*sqrt(2), and the radius of the main circle is 14, so 14 = r*sqrt(2) + r = r(1 + sqrt(2)), so r = 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

So, that brings us back to the same exact result.

But the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles," so perhaps each region is a semicircle, but not necessarily tangent to the main circle.

Wait, but the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles," which probably means they are regions (the areas inside the quarter-circle but outside the semicircles) that are tangent to each other. So, the semicircles are each tangent to the main circle and to each other.

So, in that case, each semicircle is tangent to the main circle and the other semicircle.

So, the distance between centers is 2r, and the distance from each center to the main circle is 14 - r*sqrt(2), which is equal to r, because the semicircles are tangent to the main circle.

So, 14 - r*sqrt(2) = r, which gives r = 14/(1 + sqrt(2)).

So, that's the answer.

But since the problem asks for a common fraction, and 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) is not a common fraction, perhaps I need to rationalize it differently, but that gives 14*(sqrt(2) - 1), which is exact but not a common fraction.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming the semicircles are tangent to the sides AQ and BQ and to each other, but not necessarily to the main circle. So, in that case, each semicircle is tangent to the sides AQ and BQ, which are the radii, and tangent to each other.

So, in that case, the distance from Q to center of semicircle is r*sqrt(2), and the distance from center to the sides AQ and BQ is r, so that's consistent.

But the semicircles are tangent to each other, so the distance between centers is 2r, which is also equal to the distance between centers, which is 2r.

But the centers are located at (r, r) and (14 - r, r), so the distance between centers is 14 - 2r, which equals 2r, so 14 - 2r = 2r, so r = 7, which is too big because the main circle is 14 inches.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the semicircles are not tangent to each other, but each is tangent to the main circle.

Wait, that seems consistent with the earlier reasoning.

So, if the semicircles are each tangent to the main circle, then the distance from Q to center is r*sqrt(2), and the distance from center to main circle is 14 - r*sqrt(2), which is equal to r, so 14 - r*sqrt(2) = r, leading to r = 14/(1 + sqrt(2)).

So, that seems correct. So, the exact answer is 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) inches, which is approximately 5.798 inches, which is a common fraction in terms of sqrt(2).

But since the problem asks for a common fraction, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about two semicircles, but four semicircles, two on each side? Wait, but the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles," so maybe each region is a semicircle, so two semicircles.

Wait, perhaps the regions are not semicircles but quarter-circles. But the problem says semicircles. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the regions are semicircles that are tangent to the main circle and to the two radii AQ and BQ.

But in that case, each semicircle is tangent to the main circle and to the two sides AQ and BQ, so the distance from Q to center is r*sqrt(2), so 14 = r*sqrt(2) + r, so r = 14/(sqrt(2) + 1), same as before.

So, perhaps the answer is 14/(1 + sqrt(2)), or 14*(sqrt(2) - 1), which is approximately 5.798 inches.

But the problem asks to express as a common fraction. 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) is an exact form, but it's irrational. So, perhaps the problem expects the answer in a different form.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the two smaller regions are the regions outside the semicircles but inside the quarter-circle. So, each region is a quarter-circle minus a semicircle.

But that's just the area, not the radius.

Wait, the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles," so perhaps the semicircles are tangent to each other and the main circle, but not necessarily to the sides AQ and BQ.

Wait, but the problem says "AQ and BQ form a right angle," so the original figure is a quarter-circle with AQ and BQ as radii.

Wait, perhaps the two smaller regions are the two semicircles that are tangent to each other and to the main circle, but not necessarily to the sides AQ and BQ.

Wait, in that case, the semicircles would be drawn in the quarter-circle, each tangent to the main circle, and tangent to each other.

So, in that case, the centers of the semicircles are located at (r, r) and (r, 14 - r), or something like that.

Wait, let me think again. Let me denote the two semicircles as S1 and S2.

Each semicircle is tangent to the main circle, so the distance from Q to center of S1 plus radius of S1 equals main circle's radius.

Similarly for S2.

Also, the two semicircles are tangent to each other, so the distance between their centers is 2r.

So, let me denote the centers of S1 and S2 as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

Since S1 is tangent to AQ and BQ, which are the x-axis and y-axis, the center of S1 must be at (r, r). Similarly, S2 must be at (r, 14 - r) or something else.

Wait, if S2 is tangent to AQ and BQ, then it's center is at (r, 14 - r), but then the distance between centers would be sqrt( (r - r)^2 + (14 - r - r)^2 ) = sqrt(0 + (14 - 2r)^2 ) = |14 - 2r|.

But since the semicircles are tangent to each other, this distance must be 2r.

So, |14 - 2r| = 2r.

Since 14 - 2r is positive (because r is less than 7, so 14 - 2r > 0), so 14 - 2r = 2r.

Thus, 14 = 4r, so r = 14/4 = 3.5 inches.

But that's inconsistent with the radii being smaller than the main circle's radius.

Wait, but the main circle is 14 inches, so 3.5 is smaller, that's fine.

But let me check, if r = 3.5 inches, then the centers of S1 and S2 are at (3.5, 3.5) and (3.5, 14 - 3.5) = (3.5, 10.5). The distance between centers is sqrt( (3.5 - 3.5)^2 + (10.5 - 3.5)^2 ) = sqrt(0 + 7^2) = 7 inches, which equals 2r = 7 inches. So, that works.

But then, each S1 and S2 is a semicircle with radius 3.5 inches, so the area is π*(3.5)^2, but the problem is about the radius, which is 3.5 inches.

But the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles," but if the regions are just the semicircles, then each has radius 3.5 inches. But 3.5 is 7/2, which is a common fraction.

So, maybe that's the answer.

Wait, but in the problem, the semicircles are within the quarter-circle, so if the two semicircles are each of radius 3.5, then together they cover the quarter-circle.

But the quarter-circle has area (1/4)*π*(14)^2 = (1/4)*π*196 = 49π.

Each semicircle has area (1/2)*π*(3.5)^2 = (1/2)*π*(12.25) = 6.125π.

So, two semicircles have total area 12.25π, which is less than the quarter-circle area 49π, so that seems okay.

But the problem is about the regions being tangent semicircles, so maybe the two semicircles are the regions? Wait, the regions are the areas inside the quarter-circle but outside the semicircles.

But in that case, those regions would be like lens-shaped areas, but tangent semicircles.

But the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles," so maybe the regions are the semicircles themselves.

But the problem is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, going back to the problem statement: "In the circle with center Q, radii AQ and BQ form a right angle. The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, as shown. The radius of the smaller semicircle is ___________."

So, the two smaller regions are regions within the circle, each bounded by a semicircle and the two radii AQ and BQ.

So, each region is a semicircle, and these two semicircles are tangent to each other and to the sides AQ and BQ.

So, each region is a semicircle, and they are tangent to each other. So, each region is a semicircle, and the two semicircles are tangent to each other.

So, in that case, the distance between centers is 2r, and each center is at (r, r) and (r, 14 - r). So, distance between centers is 14 - 2r, which equals 2r.

So, 14 - 2r = 2r, so 14 = 4r, so r = 14/4 = 3.5 inches.

So, that's the radius.

But the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." So, if each region is a semicircle, and they are tangent to each other, then the radius is 3.5 inches.

But 3.5 is 7/2, which is a common fraction.

But earlier, I thought of 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) which is approximately 5.798 inches, but that was when considering the semicircles are tangent to the main circle.

Wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the two smaller regions are the two semicircles, each tangent to the main circle and to each other, but not necessarily to the sides AQ and BQ.

So, if each semicircle is tangent to the main circle and to each other, then the distance between centers is 2r, and the centers are located such that the distance from Q to each center is r*sqrt(2), so 14 - r*sqrt(2) = r, leading to r = 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) inches.

But the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles," so maybe the regions are the semicircles themselves. So, the regions are the semicircles, and they are tangent.

So, in that case, r = 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) inches.

But 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) is not a common fraction, but perhaps the problem expects the answer in the form of 14*(sqrt(2) - 1), which is equal to 14/(1 + sqrt(2)). So, as a common fraction, 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) is the exact value.

But 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) can be written as (14*sqrt(2) - 14), which is an exact form, but I don't think that's a common fraction.

Wait, maybe the problem is not about two semicircles, but four semicircles, two on each side?

Wait, but the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles," so maybe it's two regions, each a semicircle.

Wait, perhaps the two smaller regions are each a semicircle, and they are tangent to each other and to the sides AQ and BQ.

So, each region is a semicircle, located in the sectors, and they are tangent to each other and to the sides AQ and BQ.

So, in that case, the centers of the semicircles are located at (r, r) and (r, 14 - r), and the distance between centers is 2r, so 14 - 2r = 2r, leading to r = 3.5 inches.

So, that's consistent.

So, perhaps the answer is 3.5 inches, which is 7/2.

But the problem says the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, so maybe each region is a semicircle, and their radii are 3.5 inches. But 3.5 is 7/2, which is a common fraction.

But wait, 3.5 is 7/2, which is 3.5, but 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) is approximately 5.798, which is about 5.8, which is bigger than 3.5.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I've misinterpreted the problem.

Wait, the problem says: "In the circle with center Q, radii AQ and BQ form a right angle. The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, as shown. The radius of the smaller semicircle is ___________."

So, the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles. So, each region is a semicircle, and they are tangent to each other.

Therefore, the two semicircles are each tangent to the main circle and tangent to each other.

Therefore, the distance between centers is 2r, and each center is at (r, r) and (r, 14 - r). So, distance between centers is sqrt( (r - r)^2 + (14 - r - r)^2 ) = sqrt(0 + (14 - 2r)^2 ) = |14 - 2r|.

Since the semicircles are tangent to each other, |14 - 2r| = 2r.

Since 14 - 2r is positive, because r < 7, so 14 - 2r = 2r, so 14 = 4r, so r = 3.5 inches.

So, the radius is 3.5 inches.

Since 3.5 is 7/2, which is a common fraction, 7/2.

But let me check, if r = 3.5 inches, then the centers of the semicircles are at (3.5, 3.5) and (3.5, 14 - 3.5) = (3.5, 10.5).

The distance between centers is sqrt( (3.5 - 3.5)^2 + (10.5 - 3.5)^2 ) = sqrt(0 + 49) = 7 inches.

Which is equal to 2r = 7 inches, so that's correct.

So, each semicircle has a radius of 3.5 inches, which is 7/2 inches, so that's a common fraction.

Therefore, the answer is 7/2 inches.

So, why did I get confused earlier?

Because I thought the two semicircles were tangent to the main circle, but actually, the problem says the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, so each region is a semicircle, and they are tangent to each other. So, the two semicircles are each tangent to the main circle and to each other, with their centers located at (r, r) and (r, 14 - r).

Therefore, the radius is 3.5 inches.

So, the answer is 7/2.

But let me cross-verify.

If each semicircle is tangent to the main circle, then the distance from Q to center of semicircle plus radius is equal to 14.

So, centers are at (r, r), so distance from Q is sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = r*sqrt(2). So, if it's tangent to main circle, then r*sqrt(2) + r = 14, so r = 14/(1 + sqrt(2)) ≈ 5.798 inches.

But that's if the semicircles are tangent to main circle. But the problem says the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, so maybe the regions themselves are the semicircles, so we don't need to consider the main circle.

Therefore, in that case, the two smaller regions, which are the semicircles, have centers at (r, r) and (r, 14 - r), so the distance between centers is 14 - 2r, which equals 2r, so 14 = 4r, so r = 3.5 inches.

Therefore, the answer is 7/2 inches.

But the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles," which probably refers to the two semicircles. So, the regions are each a semicircle, and they are tangent to each other, so the radius is 7/2 inches.

So, in conclusion, the radius is 7/2 inches, which is 3.5 inches.

But 3.5 is 7/2, so the answer is 7/2, which is a common fraction.

I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the smaller semicircle is \boxed{\dfrac{7}{2}} inches.
</think>

In the circle with center \( Q \), radii \( AQ \) and \( BQ \) form a right angle. The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles. We need to find the radius of the smaller semicircle.

1. The problem involves a circle with center \( Q \), radii \( AQ \) and \( BQ \) forming a right angle, creating a quarter-circle with radius 14 inches.
2. The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, meaning each semicircle is tangent to the main circle and to each other.
3. The distance from \( Q \) to the center of each semicircle is \( r\sqrt{2} \), where \( r \) is the radius of the semicircle.
4. The distance between the centers of the two semicircles is \( 14 - 2r \), which equals \( 2r \) because the semicircles are tangent to each other.
5. Setting up the equation: \( 14 - 2r = 2r \) leads to \( 14 = 4r \), so \( r = \frac{14}{4} = \frac{7}{2} \).

Thus, the radius of the smaller semicircle is \(\boxed{\dfrac{7}{2}}\) inches.
