Question:
You have seven bags of gold coins. Each bag has the same number of gold coins. One day, you find a bag of 53 coins. You decide to redistribute the number of coins you have so that all eight bags you hold have the same number of coins. You successfully manage to redistribute all the coins, and you also note that you have more than 200 coins. What is the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins?

Correct Answer:
If there are $b$ gold coins in each of the original 7 bags, then $7b+53$ is divisible by 8. In other words, $7b + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$. Since $53 \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$ and $7 \equiv -1 \pmod{8}$, we have that $-b \equiv -5 \pmod{8}$. Multiplying both sides by $-1$, we get that $b \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$. Now, we want $7b + 53 > 200$, so as a result, $b > \frac{200-53}{7} \implies b > 21$. Therefore, we want an integer greater than 21 which leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 8. The least such integer is 29, so you had $29 \cdot 7 = \boxed{203}$ coins before finding the bag of 53 coins.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem here about eight bags of gold coins. Let me try to understand it step by step.

First, there are seven bags of gold coins, each with the same number of coins. Then, one day, I find another bag that has 53 coins. So, initially, I have eight bags, right? Because seven plus one is eight. But wait, no, actually, the problem says I have seven bags, and then I find another bag, so now I have eight bags in total. Hmm, okay, so initially, I had seven bags, each with the same number of coins. Let me denote the number of coins in each of these seven bags as 'x'. So, initially, I have 7x coins.

Then, I find another bag with 53 coins. So, the total number of coins I have now is 7x + 53. Got that.

Now, I want to redistribute all these coins so that all eight bags I hold have the same number of coins. So, I need to divide the total number of coins into eight equal parts. That means each bag will have (7x + 53)/8 coins. But since each bag must have an integer number of coins, (7x + 53) must be divisible by 8. So, 7x + 53 ≡ 0 mod 8.

That gives me the equation: 7x + 53 ≡ 0 mod 8.

I can simplify this equation to find x. Let me compute 53 mod 8 first. 8 times 6 is 48, so 53 - 48 is 5. Therefore, 53 ≡ 5 mod 8. So, the equation becomes 7x + 5 ≡ 0 mod 8. Subtracting 5 from both sides, I get 7x ≡ -5 mod 8. But since -5 mod 8 is the same as 3 mod 8 (because 8 - 5 = 3), the equation simplifies to 7x ≡ 3 mod 8.

Now, I need to solve for x in this congruence. That is, find x such that 7x leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 8. To solve 7x ≡ 3 mod 8, I can find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 8. The inverse of 7 mod 8 is a number 'a' such that 7a ≡ 1 mod 8. Let's see, 7*7=49, which is 1 mod 8 since 49-48=1. So, the inverse of 7 is 7.

Therefore, multiplying both sides of the equation 7x ≡ 3 mod 8 by 7 gives x ≡ 3*7 mod 8, which is x ≡ 21 mod 8. 21 divided by 8 is 2 with a remainder of 5, so x ≡ 5 mod 8. So, x can be expressed as x = 8k + 5, where k is some integer.

So, x is of the form 8k + 5. Now, I need to find the smallest number of coins I could have had before finding the bag of 53. That is, the minimal total number of coins before adding the 53, which is 7x. So, I need to find the minimal 7x such that 7x + 53 is divisible by 8, and the total coins after redistribution is more than 200.

Wait, hold on, the problem says that after redistributing, I have more than 200 coins. So, 7x + 53 must be divisible by 8, and (7x + 53)/8 > 200. So, let's write that down: (7x + 53)/8 > 200. Multiplying both sides by 8 gives 7x + 53 > 1600. So, 7x > 1600 - 53 = 1547. Therefore, x > 1547/7.

Calculating 1547 divided by 7: 7*221=1547, because 7*200=1400, 7*21=147, so 1400+147=1547. Therefore, x > 221.

But x must also satisfy x = 8k + 5, so x must be at least 222. So, x must be greater than 221, so the smallest integer x is 222, but x must be of the form 8k +5. So, 222 divided by 8 is 27.75, which is not an integer. So, let's find the smallest k such that 8k +5 ≥ 222.

Let me write 8k +5 ≥ 222. Subtract 5: 8k ≥ 217. Divide by 8: k ≥ 217/8. 217 divided by 8 is 27.125. Since k must be an integer, k must be at least 28. Therefore, the smallest x is 8*28 +5 = 224 +5 = 229.

But wait, let me check if x=229 is correct. Let's plug it back into the total coins: 7x +53. 7*229 = 1603. 1603 +53 = 1656. Then, 1656 divided by 8 is 207. So, 207 is the number of coins in each bag after redistribution. Which is more than 200, as required.

But wait, is 207 the number of coins per bag? So, before adding the 53, I had 7x = 7*229 = 1603 coins. Then, adding 53 gives 1656, which is 207 per bag. So, is 1603 the minimal number of coins before adding the 53?

But hold on, maybe 1603 is too low. Because 207 is more than 200, but is there a smaller x that also satisfies the conditions? Let me check.

Wait, earlier, we had x must be congruent to 5 mod 8, and x must be greater than 221. So, the first such x is 229, which gives us 1656 total coins. But is 229 the minimal x? Let me check x=221. 221 is 221 mod 8: 221 divided by 8 is 27*8=216, so 221-216=5, so 221≡5 mod8. So, x=221 satisfies x≡5 mod8.

But 7x +53=7*221 +53=1547 +53=1600. 1600 divided by8 is 200. But the problem says that after redistribution, I have more than 200 coins. So, 200 is not more than 200, so x=221 is invalid.

So, x must be greater than 221. So, the next x is 229, which gives 1656 total coins, which is over 200 per bag.

But wait, let me make sure that x=229 is the minimal x that satisfies x≡5 mod8 and x>221.

So, x=229 is correct, but is there a smaller x between 222 and 229 which is ≡5 mod8? Let's list numbers congruent to 5 mod8 and see:

5, 13, 21, 29, 37, 45, 53, 61, 69, 77, 85, 93, 101, 109, 117, 125, 133, 141, 149, 157, 165, 173, 181, 189, 197, 205, 213, 221, 229,...

So, numbers congruent to 5 mod8 greater than 221 are 229, 237, etc. So, 229 is the first one after 221. So, x=229 is indeed the minimal x.

Therefore, before adding the 53 coins, I had 7x=1603 coins. So, 1603 is the minimal number of coins I could have had.

Wait, but hold on, is 1603 the minimal number? Let me verify that 7x +53 is divisible by8. 7*229=1603; 1603+53=1656; 1656/8=207. So, 207 is more than 200, so that's good. So, 1603 is the minimal number.

But the question is asking for the smallest number of coins I could have had before finding the bag of 53. So, 1603 is the answer? Wait, but 1603 is a large number. Is there a way to have a smaller number?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again: You have seven bags of gold coins. Each bag has the same number of gold coins. One day, you find a bag of 53 coins. You decide to redistribute the number of coins you have so that all eight bags you hold have the same number of coins. You successfully manage to redistribute all the coins, and you also note that you have more than 200 coins. What is the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins?

So, you have seven bags, each with x coins, so 7x. Then, you find a bag with 53 coins, so now you have eight bags, with 7x +53 coins. Then, you redistribute these coins so that each bag has the same number, meaning (7x +53)/8 must be an integer. Also, the total coins after redistribution must be more than 200, so (7x +53)/8 > 200. So, 7x +53 > 1600, so 7x > 1547, so x > 221. So, x must be at least 222.

But x must also satisfy that 7x +53 is divisible by8, meaning 7x +53 ≡0 mod8. So, 7x ≡ -53 mod8. Now, as I did before, 53 mod8 is 5, so 7x ≡ -5 mod8, which is 7x ≡3 mod8. Then, 7 inverse mod8 is 7, because 7*7=49≡1 mod8. So, x≡3*7=21≡5 mod8. So, x=8k +5.

Therefore, x must be 5 mod8, and x>221. So, the minimal x is 229, as above.

Thus, the minimal total coins before adding the 53 is 7*229=1603.

Wait, but 1603 seems a bit high. Maybe I did something wrong in the modulo operation.

Wait, let me check 7x +53 ≡0 mod8. So, 7x +53 ≡7x +5 mod8. So, 7x +5 ≡0 mod8, which is 7x≡-5 mod8, which is 7x≡3 mod8.

So, 7x≡3 mod8. So, x≡3*(7^{-1} mod8). Since 7^{-1}=7, x≡3*7=21≡5 mod8. So, that part is correct.

So, x=8k +5.

Then, x>221, so x=229.

Therefore, 7*229=1603.

Yes, that seems consistent.

But let me think differently. Maybe the problem is that I have eight bags, each with the same number, so the total number of coins must be divisible by8. But the total coins after adding the 53 is 7x +53, which is divisible by8, and that total is also more than 200. So, 7x +53 >200*8=1600.

So, 7x +53 >1600 → 7x>1547 →x>221.

So, x is at least 222, but x must be 5 mod8.

So, x=229 is the minimal x.

So, 7*229=1603.

Is there a smaller x that is 5 mod8 and larger than 221? The next x is 229. So, 229 is the minimal x.

Therefore, the minimal number of coins before adding the 53 is 1603.

But hold on, the problem says that after redistribution, each bag has more than 200 coins. So, (7x +53)/8 >200. So, 7x +53>1600, which is okay.

But is 1603 the minimal number? Let me see, perhaps I can find a smaller x with 7x +53 divisible by8 and total coins after redistribution more than 200.

Wait, but if I take x=229, 7x=1603, which is the smallest x>221 with x=5 mod8, then 7x +53=1656, which is divisible by8, and 1656/8=207>200. So, that works.

But 1603 is the minimal before adding the 53, right? Because x has to be at least 229, so 7x is 1603.

Wait, but let me think of another approach. Maybe instead of using modular arithmetic, I can express the conditions:

Let total coins before adding 53 be 7x.

Total coins after adding 53 is 7x +53.

This total is divisible by8, so 7x +53 ≡0 mod8.

Also, (7x +53)/8 >200.

So, 7x +53 >1600 →7x>1547→x>221.

Thus, x must be at least 222, but x must be 5 mod8.

So, x=229 is the minimal x.

Therefore, the minimal total coins before adding the 53 is 7*229=1603.

So, I think 1603 is the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure that 7x +53 is indeed divisible by8 for x=229.

7*229=1603, 1603 +53=1656.

1656 divided by8: 8*200=1600, 1656-1600=56, 56/8=7. So, 200+7=207.

Yes, 207 is divisible by8? Wait, 207 divided by8 is 25.875, which is not an integer. Wait, 207 is not divisible by8. Wait, that contradicts my earlier reasoning.

Wait, hold on. 7x +53=1656, which is 207*8=1656. So, 207 is the number of coins per bag. So, 207 is the total per bag. So, 207 is indeed an integer, so 1656 is divisible by8. But 207 is not necessarily divisible by8.

Wait, but 207 is 25*8 +7=207. So, 207 is 25*8 +7. So, 207 is not divisible by8, but 1656 is.

So, the confusion is that the number of coins per bag is 207, which is not divisible by8, but the total number of coins is divisible by8.

So, that's okay.

So, going back, so 1656 is divisible by8, so the total coins after redistribution is 207, which is the number of coins per bag.

So, the question is asking for the smallest number of coins I could have had before finding the bag of 53. So, that is, 7x. So, 7x=1603.

But 1603 is correct.

Wait, but let me think, is there a smaller x? If x is less than 229 but still 5 mod8, and greater than 221, then 7x would be less than 1603.

But the next x after 221 that is 5 mod8 is 229, so 7x is 1603.

Therefore, 1603 is the minimal.

Wait, but let me see, suppose x=221, which is 5 mod8. Then, 7x +53=7*221 +53=1547 +53=1600. Then, 1600 divided by8 is 200. But the problem says that after redistribution, I have more than 200 coins. So, 200 is not more than 200. Therefore, x=221 is invalid.

So, x must be at least 229.

Therefore, 7x=1603 is the minimal.

So, I think 1603 is the correct answer.

Wait, but 1603 is quite a large number, but considering that you have 7x coins before adding the 53, which is 7*229=1603, and then adding 53 makes it 1656, which is divisible by8.

Therefore, the minimal number is 1603.

So, I think that is the answer.

**Final Answer**
The smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins is \boxed{1603}.
</think>

You have seven bags of gold coins, each with the same number of coins, denoted as \( x \). Therefore, you initially have \( 7x \) coins. You find another bag with 53 coins, so the total number of coins becomes \( 7x + 53 \). This total must be divisible by 8 after redistribution, meaning \( 7x + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \).

First, we convert 53 modulo 8:
\[ 53 \equiv 5 \pmod{8} \]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ 7x + 5 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ 7x \equiv -5 \pmod{8} \]
Since \(-5 \equiv 3 \pmod{8}\), we have:
\[ 7x \equiv 3 \pmod{8} \]

To solve for \( x \), we find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 8, which is 7 because \( 7 \times 7 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \). Multiplying both sides by 7:
\[ x \equiv 3 \times 7 \pmod{8} \]
\[ x \equiv 21 \pmod{8} \]
\[ x \equiv 5 \pmod{8} \]

Thus, \( x \) can be written as \( x = 8k + 5 \) for some integer \( k \). We need \( 7x + 53 \) to be more than 200 coins after redistribution:
\[ 7x + 53 > 200 \times 8 \]
\[ 7x + 53 > 1600 \]
\[ 7x > 1547 \]
\[ x > 221 \]

The smallest integer \( x \) greater than 221 and congruent to 5 modulo 8 is 229. Therefore:
\[ x = 229 \]

The total number of coins before finding the bag of 53 is:
\[ 7x = 7 \times 229 = 1603 \]

Thus, the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins is \(\boxed{1603}\).
