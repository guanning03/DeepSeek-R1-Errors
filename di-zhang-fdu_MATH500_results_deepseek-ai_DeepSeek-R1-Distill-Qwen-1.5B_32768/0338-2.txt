Correct Answer:
The shaded triangle has a base of length $10\text{ cm}.$ Since the triangle is enclosed in a rectangle of height $3\text{ cm},$ then the height of the triangle is $3\text{ cm}.$ (We know that the enclosing shape is a rectangle, because any figure with four sides, including two pairs of equal opposite sides, and two right angles must be a rectangle.) Therefore, the area of the triangle is $$\frac{1}{2}\times 3 \times 10 = \boxed{15\mbox{ cm}^2}.$$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this diagram with a shaded triangle, and I need to find its area. The diagram is drawn using Asymptote, which I'm somewhat familiar with, but I need to visualize it properly. Let me try to parse the information from the code.

First, the Asymptote code mentions points (0,0) to (2,3) to (10,0) and back to (0,0), forming the shaded triangle. Then, it draws the base from (0,0) to (10,0), which is 10 cm, and the side from (0,0) to (10,3), but wait, that's actually 10 cm in the x-direction and 3 cm in the y-direction. Hmm, maybe it's a rectangle? Let me think.

Wait, no. The code says it's a rectangle from (0,0) to (10,0) to (10,3) to (0,3) and back to (0,0). So that makes a rectangle that's 10 cm wide and 3 cm tall. Then, inside this rectangle, there's a diagonal line from (0,0) to (2,3) to (10,0). So that divides the rectangle into two parts: the shaded triangle and another quadrilateral.

Looking at the labels, they mention 10 cm on the top, 10 cm on the bottom, 3 cm on the left side, and 3 cm on the right side. So the rectangle is 10 cm by 3 cm. The shaded triangle is formed by connecting (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0). So I need to find the area of this triangle.

To find the area of a triangle when you know the coordinates of its vertices, there's a formula called the shoelace formula. Maybe I can use that. Let me recall how it works. The shoelace formula says that if you have a polygon with vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn), then the area is given by:

1/2 * |(x1y2 + x2y3 + ... + xn y1) - (y1x2 + y2x3 + ... + ynx1)|

So in this case, the triangle has vertices at (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0). Let me plug these into the formula.

First, list the coordinates in order: (0,0), (2,3), (10,0), and then back to the first point to complete the cycle. So:

x1 = 0, y1 = 0

x2 = 2, y2 = 3

x3 = 10, y3 = 0

Applying the formula:

Area = 1/2 * |(x1y2 + x2y3 + x3y1) - (y1x2 + y2x3 + y3x1)|

Compute each part step by step.

First part: x1y2 + x2y3 + x3y1

= (0)(3) + (2)(0) + (10)(0)

= 0 + 0 + 0

= 0

Second part: y1x2 + y2x3 + y3x1

= (0)(2) + (3)(10) + (0)(0)

= 0 + 30 + 0

= 30

So the area is 1/2 * |0 - 30| = 1/2 * 30 = 15

So the area of the triangle is 15 square centimeters.

Wait a minute, but let me verify this with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe using base and height?

Looking at the triangle, the base is from (0,0) to (10,0), which is 10 cm. But wait, is that the base? Actually, in the triangle, the base isn't along the entire length of the rectangle. The triangle is connected to the point (2,3), so maybe it's not the full base.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the coordinates to find the lengths of the sides and then use Heron's formula? Let me try that.

First, let's compute the lengths of the sides.

From (0,0) to (2,3): distance is sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13) ≈ 3.605 cm

From (2,3) to (10,0): sqrt((10-2)^2 + (0-3)^2) = sqrt(64 + 9) = sqrt(73) ≈ 8.544 cm

From (10,0) to (0,0): 10 cm

So the sides are sqrt(13), sqrt(73), and 10 cm.

Heron's formula says that the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] where s is the semi-perimeter.

Compute semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(13) + sqrt(73) + 10)/2

That seems complicated. Maybe it's not the best approach.

Alternatively, since I used the shoelace formula earlier and got 15, and it makes sense because the rectangle is 10x3=30, and the triangle is half of that? Wait, no, not exactly.

Wait, the triangle is not half the rectangle. Looking at the rectangle, which is 10x3=30. The triangle is from (0,0) to (2,3) to (10,0). Maybe it's a different proportion.

Alternatively, I can think of the triangle as a trapezoid minus some areas, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another way. If I plot the points, (0,0) is the origin, (10,0) is 10 cm to the right, and (2,3) is somewhere inside. So if I can find the base and the height relative to that base.

Alternatively, using coordinates, another method is to compute the area using vectors or determinants.

The area can also be computed using the determinant method, which is essentially the same as the shoelace formula.

So, the determinant method is:

Area = 1/2 | x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) |

Plugging in the coordinates:

x1 = 0, y1 = 0

x2 = 2, y2 = 3

x3 = 10, y3 = 0

So,

Area = 1/2 | 0*(3 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0) + 10*(0 - 3) |

= 1/2 | 0 + 0 + 10*(-3) |

= 1/2 | -30 | = 1/2 * 30 = 15

Same result. So that seems consistent.

Alternatively, I can think of the triangle as having a base along the x-axis from (0,0) to (10,0), but only up to (2,3). Wait, actually, no. Because the triangle is (0,0)--(2,3)--(10,0)--cycle, so it's a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0). So it's a triangle that is not the entire base.

Wait, but if I consider the triangle as a polygon with vertices (0,0), (2,3), (10,0), (0,0), then using shoelace, the area is 15.

But in the rectangle, the area is 10x3=30, but the triangle is a part of it. So 15 is exactly half of 30, but is that the case?

Wait, is the triangle exactly half the rectangle? Looking at the points, (0,0), (2,3), (10,0). So from (0,0) to (2,3) is a line, and then it goes to (10,0). That seems like the triangle is a quadrilateral? Wait, no, it's a triangle because it's three points.

Wait, actually, in the rectangle, the triangle is occupying the area from (0,0) to (2,3) to (10,0). So, if I imagine the rectangle, the triangle is a portion that doesn't cover the entire rectangle. It's actually a triangle that's attached to the left side of the rectangle.

Wait, but the rectangle is 10 cm wide and 3 cm tall. So, the triangle is a slanted triangle with a base from (0,0) to (10,0), but it's only going up to (2,3). So actually, it's a triangle that is not half of the rectangle, but a different proportion.

Wait, but the area is 15, which is half of 30, which is the area of the rectangle. So is the triangle half the rectangle? Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. If I think about the triangle, it's a triangle that's attached to the left side of the rectangle, but only up to (2,3). So, if I consider the area of the triangle, it's 15, which is half of the rectangle's area. But is that accurate?

Wait, the rectangle is 10 cm wide and 3 cm tall, so area 30. The triangle is a triangle with base 10 cm and height 3 cm? Wait, no, because in the rectangle, the height is 3 cm, but the triangle's height from the base (10 cm) is only 3 cm at point (2,3). So actually, the area of the triangle is (base * height)/2 = (10 * 3)/2 = 15, which is exactly half of the rectangle's area. So that makes sense.

So, the triangle is exactly half of the rectangle, which is 10x3, so area 30. Therefore, the triangle has area 15 cm².

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the triangle as a trapezoid minus some area. For example, if I consider the rectangle, from (0,0) to (10,0) to (10,3) to (0,3) to (0,0). The triangle is the area from (0,0) to (2,3) to (10,0). So, if I subtract the area above the triangle from the rectangle, I can find the triangle's area.

But that might not be straightforward because it's not a simple subtraction. It might be easier to stick with the shoelace formula or the determinant method.

Wait, another thought: Maybe using coordinates, I can integrate to find the area, but that seems overkill.

Alternatively, since I know that the shoelace formula gave me 15, and it's a reliable method, perhaps I should just trust that.

But just to double-check, let's try to visualize the triangle. The triangle has two points on the x-axis: (0,0) and (10,0). The third point is (2,3). So, if I connect (0,0) to (2,3), that's a line that goes up 3 cm over 2 cm, so a slope of 3/2. Then from (2,3) to (10,0), that line goes down 3 cm over 8 cm. So the triangle has a base of 10 cm, but it's not symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by coordinates, which is the same as the shoelace formula, so I think it's solid.

Alternatively, let's see if the triangle is a right triangle. To check, I can compute the slopes of the sides.

From (0,0) to (2,3): slope is (3 - 0)/(2 - 0) = 3/2

From (2,3) to (10,0): slope is (0 - 3)/(10 - 2) = (-3)/8

From (10,0) to (0,0): slope is (0 - 0)/(0 - 10) = 0, which is a horizontal line.

So, since none of the sides are perpendicular, it's not a right triangle. So, the area can't be computed using base*height/2 in a straightforward way without knowing a base and its corresponding height.

But since I can't find a base and height easily, shoelace formula seems the best.

Wait, let's think in terms of vectors. The vectors from (0,0) to (2,3) is (2,3), and from (0,0) to (10,0) is (10,0). The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

Cross product in 2D is |(2)(0) - (3)(10)| = |0 - 30| = 30, so half of that is 15. So yes, that's consistent with the shoelace formula.

So, I think 15 is the correct area.

But just to be thorough, let's think about the triangle as a polygon and try to find its area using other methods.

If I divide the triangle into simpler shapes, like a rectangle and a triangle, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, using coordinates, I can compute the area by dividing the triangle into smaller regions or using the formula for the area of a triangle given three points.

Wait, another approach: Using the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) is 1/2 |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|. As I did before, which gives 15.

Yes, so that's consistent.

Alternatively, using determinants, the area is 1/2 | determinant |, which is the same as the shoelace formula.

So, after all these different methods, I'm pretty confident that the area is 15 cm².

But let me just ensure that I didn't make any calculation mistakes.

Let me write down the points again: (0,0), (2,3), (10,0).

Using shoelace:

List the coordinates in order:

(0,0), (2,3), (10,0), (0,0)

Compute sum1 = (0*3) + (2*0) + (10*0) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

Compute sum2 = (0*2) + (3*10) + (0*0) = 0 + 30 + 0 = 30

Area = 1/2 |sum1 - sum2| = 1/2 |0 - 30| = 1/2 * 30 = 15

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I use vectors, as I did earlier, the cross product method also gives 15.

So, I think that's solid.

But just to make sure, let me think about the coordinates again.

The triangle is formed by (0,0), (2,3), (10,0). So, from (0,0) to (2,3) is a line, then to (10,0), then back to (0,0). So, the triangle is a three-sided figure with one vertex at the origin, one at (2,3), and one at (10,0).

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area using integration. Let's try that.

First, find the equations of the sides.

From (0,0) to (2,3): slope is 3/2, so equation is y = (3/2)x

From (2,3) to (10,0): slope is (-3)/8, so equation is y - 3 = (-3/8)(x - 2). Let's write that in slope-intercept form.

y = (-3/8)x + (6/8) + 3

Simplify:

y = (-3/8)x + (3/4) + 3

Convert 3 to 12/4, so:

y = (-3/8)x + 15/4

From (10,0) to (0,0): that's the x-axis, y=0.

So, to compute the area under the curve from x=0 to x=10, but actually, the triangle is a polygon, so integrating isn't straightforward here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area by integrating the difference between the upper and lower functions.

From x=0 to x=2, the upper function is y = (3/2)x and the lower function is y=0.

From x=2 to x=10, the upper function is y = (-3/8)x + 15/4 and the lower function is y=0.

So, total area is the integral from 0 to 2 of (3/2)x dx plus the integral from 2 to 10 of [(-3/8)x + 15/4] dx.

Compute the first integral:

Integral of (3/2)x dx from 0 to 2 = (3/2)*(x²/2) evaluated from 0 to 2 = (3/4)(4) - 0 = 3

Second integral:

Integral of [(-3/8)x + 15/4] dx from 2 to 10

Compute antiderivative:

(-3/8)*(x²/2) + (15/4)x evaluated from 2 to 10

= (-3/16)x² + (15/4)x from 2 to 10

Compute at x=10:

(-3/16)(100) + (15/4)(10) = (-300/16) + (150/4) = (-75/4) + (75/2) = (-75/4 + 150/4) = 75/4

Compute at x=2:

(-3/16)(4) + (15/4)(2) = (-12/16) + (30/4) = (-3/4) + (15/2) = (-3/4 + 30/4) = 27/4

Subtract the lower limit from the upper limit:

75/4 - 27/4 = 48/4 = 12

So, the total area is first integral (3) + second integral (12) = 15

So, that's another way to compute the area, and it's 15, which matches the previous methods.

Therefore, I can be confident that the area of the shaded triangle is 15 square centimeters.

**Final Answer**
The area of the shaded triangle is \boxed{15} square centimeters.
</think>

To find the area of the shaded triangle with vertices at (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0), we can use the shoelace formula. The formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_1 - y_1x_2 - y_2x_3 - y_3x_1 \right|
\]

Plugging in the coordinates (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| (0 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 0 + 10 \cdot 0) - (0 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot 0) \right|
\]

Simplifying the terms:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 30 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -30 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15
\]

Thus, the area of the shaded triangle is \(\boxed{15}\) square centimeters.
