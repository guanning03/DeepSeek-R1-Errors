Question:
In how many ways can $7$ people sit around a round table if no two of the $3$ people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other? (Seating arrangements which are rotations of each other are treated as the same.)

Correct Answer:
After Pierre sits, we can place Rosa either two seats from Pierre (that is, with one seat between them) or three seats from Pierre. We tackle these two cases separately:

Case 1: Rosa is two seats from Pierre. There are $2$ such seats. For either of these, there are then four empty seats in a row, and one empty seat between Rosa and Pierre. Thomas can sit in either of the middle two of the four empty seats in a row. So, there are $2\cdot 2 = 4$ ways to seat Rosa and Thomas in this case. There are then $4$ seats left, which the others can take in $4! = 24$ ways. So, there are $4\cdot 24 = 96$ seatings in this case.

Case 2: Rosa is three seats from Pierre (that is, there are $2$ seats between them). There are $2$ such seats. Thomas can't sit in either of the $2$ seats directly between them, but after Rosa sits, there are $3$ empty seats in a row still, and Thomas can only sit in the middle seat of these three. Once again, there are $4$ empty seats remaining, and the $4$ remaining people can sit in them in $4! = 24$ ways. So, we have $2\cdot 24 = 48$ seatings in this case.

Putting our two cases together gives a total of $96+48 = \boxed{144}$ seatings.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many ways 7 people can sit around a round table, with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can't sit next to each other. Rotations are considered the same arrangement, so I don't have to worry about overcounting due to circular shifts. Hmm, circular permutations can be a bit tricky, but I think I can handle this.

Let me start by recalling how circular permutations work. For n people around a round table, the number of ways is (n-1)! instead of n! because rotations are considered the same. So, for 7 people, it would be 6! ways. But in this case, there's a restriction: Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can't sit next to each other. So, I can't just use the formula directly.

I think this is a problem that involves the inclusion-exclusion principle. Maybe I need to subtract the number of arrangements where at least two of them are sitting together from the total number of arrangements. But wait, since it's a circular table, the principle might be a bit different. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe I should fix one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry and then arrange the others accordingly. Let me try that.

So, if I fix Pierre's position, then the problem reduces to arranging the other 6 people around the table, considering the restriction that Rosa and Thomas can't be next to Pierre. But wait, no. The restriction is that none of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other. So, all three should not be adjacent to any other of them.

Wait, if I fix Pierre's position, then Rosa and Thomas can't sit next to him. So, their seats are blocked. Let me visualize this. If Pierre is fixed in one spot, then the two seats next to him are off-limits for Rosa and Thomas. So, we have 7 - 1 - 2 = 4 seats left for the other 4 people, including Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.

But wait, no, hold on. If I fix Pierre, then Rosa and Thomas can't sit next to him, so their seats are excluded. So, the remaining seats for the other 4 people are the two seats opposite to Pierre and the two other seats on the other side of Pierre, but excluding the two adjacent to him.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If the table is circular, fixing Pierre's position divides the table into two arcs: one clockwise and one counter-clockwise. Each arc has 3 seats, right? Because Pierre is fixed, so the seats are in pairs of two on either side.

Wait, no, the number of seats is 7, so fixing Pierre's position leaves 6 seats around the table. If Pierre is fixed, then the two seats adjacent to him are off-limits. So, that leaves 6 - 2 = 4 seats. So, the other 4 people can sit in those 4 seats. But actually, no, that's not the case because we have 7 - 1 = 6 people left, which is 6 people, and 4 seats, but the problem is that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas cannot sit next to each other. Wait, but if Pierre is fixed, then Rosa and Thomas can't sit in the seats adjacent to him.

So, let's fix Pierre's position. Then, the two seats next to him are blocked for Rosa and Thomas. So, Rosa and Thomas have to be placed in the remaining 4 seats. But also, we have to ensure that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are not all sitting next to each other. Wait, no, the restriction is only that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other. So, actually, all three should not be adjacent. So, at least one pair among them should be sitting next to each other, but all three can't be adjacent.

Wait, no, the problem says "no two of the 3 people... can sit next to each other." So, that means that any two of them cannot be adjacent. So, all three must be separated by at least one person.

So, in other words, when arranging the 7 people around the table, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must not be next to each other. So, the problem is similar to arranging 7 people around a table with 3 specific people not adjacent to each other.

I think this can be approached using the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let me recall how that works.

The formula for the number of circular arrangements where certain people are not adjacent is:

Total arrangements - arrangements where at least one pair is adjacent + arrangements where at least two pairs are adjacent - ... and so on.

But in this case, since we have three people, the inclusion-exclusion can get a bit complicated. Let me try to structure it.

First, total number of circular arrangements without any restrictions: (7-1)! = 720.

Now, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where at least one pair of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are sitting next to each other.

But since the problem is circular, let's think about it step by step.

Case 1: Exactly one pair of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are sitting together, and the third person is not adjacent to them.

Case 2: All three are sitting together (forming a block).

We need to compute both cases and adjust accordingly.

Wait, but actually, since the problem is about arrangements where no two of them are adjacent, we need to subtract all cases where any two are adjacent.

Wait, perhaps it's better to first compute the number of arrangements where at least one pair is sitting together, then subtract that from the total.

But in circular arrangements, the counts can get a bit tricky because of rotational symmetry and overlapping cases.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion by considering each pair.

Let me define the sets:

Let A be the set of arrangements where Pierre and Rosa are sitting next to each other.

Let B be the set of arrangements where Pierre and Thomas are sitting next to each other.

Let C be the set of arrangements where Rosa and Thomas are sitting next to each other.

We need to find the total number of arrangements minus the number of arrangements where at least one of A, B, or C occurs.

So, the formula is:

Total arrangements - |A ∪ B ∪ C| = Total - (|A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|)

So, let's compute each of these terms.

First, |A|, |B|, |C|: the number of arrangements where a specific pair is sitting together.

Since the table is circular, the number of ways to treat a pair as a single entity is (n-1)! for circular arrangements, but since the pair can be arranged in 2 ways (AB or BA), we have 2*(n-2)!.

But wait, in our case, n=7, but since we have a pair, we can think of them as a single "block." So, the total number of entities to arrange is 6: the block and the other 5 individuals. However, since it's a circular table, the number of arrangements is (6-1)! = 5! = 120. But since the block can be arranged in 2 ways (Pierre next to Rosa or Rosa next to Pierre), we multiply by 2, so |A| = |B| = |C| = 2*5! = 240.

But wait, hold on. Let me verify this because when we fix a pair, it's a bit different.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If we consider a specific pair, say Pierre and Rosa, as a single block, then we have 6 entities to arrange: the block and the other 5 people. Since it's a circular table, the number of ways to arrange these 6 entities is (6-1)! = 120. But since the block itself can be arranged in 2 ways (Pierre next to Rosa or Rosa next to Pierre), the total number is 2*120 = 240. So, |A| = |B| = |C| = 240.

Okay, so each |A|, |B|, |C| is 240.

Now, moving on to |A ∩ B|, |A ∩ C|, |B ∩ C|: the number of arrangements where two pairs are sitting together.

So, for example, |A ∩ B| is the number of arrangements where both Pierre and Rosa are sitting next to each other, and Pierre and Thomas are sitting next to each other. So, all three are sitting together in a block.

Wait, but in a circular table, if all three are sitting together, how many ways are there?

Let me think. If all three are sitting together, we can treat them as a single block. So, the number of entities to arrange is (7 - 3 + 1) = 5: the block and the other 4 individuals.

But since it's a circular table, the number of arrangements is (5 - 1)! = 4! = 24. But since the block can be arranged in different ways, we need to consider the permutations within the block.

Wait, but in this case, the block consists of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas. How many ways can they be arranged within the block? Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are distinct, we can arrange them in 3! = 6 ways.

Therefore, |A ∩ B| = 24 * 6 = 144.

Similarly, |A ∩ C| and |B ∩ C| would also be 144 each.

Wait, let me confirm this. If two pairs are sitting together, that is, all three are sitting together, so yes, the block has 3 people, so 3! arrangements within the block, and (5-1)! arrangements around the table, so 24*6=144.

So, |A ∩ B| = |A ∩ C| = |B ∩ C| = 144.

Now, finally, |A ∩ B ∩ C|: the number of arrangements where all three are sitting together. That's the same as |A ∩ B|, which is 144. Because if all three are together, then all pairs are sitting together. So, |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 144.

So, plugging back into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

So, that's 240 + 240 + 240 - 144 - 144 -144 + 144.

Calculating step by step:

240*3 = 720.

144*3 = 432.

So, 720 - 432 + 144.

720 - 432 = 288.

288 + 144 = 432.

So, |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 432.

Therefore, the number of arrangements where at least one pair is sitting together is 432.

Therefore, the number of arrangements where no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are sitting next to each other is Total arrangements - |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 720 - 432 = 288.

Wait, but hold on a second. Is this correct? Because when we fixed Pierre's position, we adjusted the counts, but in the inclusion-exclusion formula, we considered the general case where all three are around without any restrictions. So, perhaps I need to adjust for the circular nature.

Wait, no, actually, in the inclusion-exclusion formula, we considered all possible pairs, regardless of the total number of people. So, maybe the result is correct.

But let me double-check my calculations.

Total arrangements: (7-1)! = 720.

Each |A|, |B|, |C|: 2*(6-1)! = 2*120 = 240.

Each |A ∩ B|, etc.: 3!*(5-1)! = 6*24 = 144.

So, inclusion-exclusion gives |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 240*3 - 144*3 + 144 = 720 - 432 + 144 = 432.

So, 720 - 432 = 288.

Hmm, so the number of arrangements is 288.

Wait, but let me think again: when we fixed Pierre's position, perhaps we have overcounted or undercounted the arrangements where Pierre is next to others.

Wait, no, because we already considered all the circular arrangements by fixing Pierre's position. So, perhaps the 288 is the correct answer. But let me cross-verify with another method.

Another approach: consider the problem as arranging the 7 people around a table with 3 specific people not adjacent to each other.

In circular arrangements, the number of ways to arrange n people with m specific people not adjacent is:

(n - m)! * C(n - m, m) * something... Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, we can use the gap method. So, first, arrange the other people, then place the Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas in the remaining seats such that they are not adjacent.

Since it's a circular table, let's fix Pierre's position to eliminate rotational symmetry. Then, we have 6 seats left. The other people can be arranged in 6! / 6 = 120 ways (since fixing Pierre's seat, we have 6! / 6 = 120? Wait, no, fixing Pierre's seat, the remaining 6 can be arranged in 6! ways. But since the table is circular, we fix one person, so it's (7-1)! = 720. Wait, no, I think I confused the process.

Wait, no, if we fix Pierre's seat, the problem reduces to arranging the other 6 people. So, the number of ways to arrange the other 6 is 6! = 720. Then, we need to place Rosa and Thomas in such a way that they are not adjacent to Pierre or to each other.

Wait, but if we fix Pierre, then the seats next to him are already blocked for Rosa and Thomas. So, the two seats adjacent to Pierre are off-limits, so Rosa and Thomas have to be placed in the remaining 4 seats.

But wait, but we have 6 other people to arrange, but we have only 4 seats where Rosa and Thomas can be placed. So, that seems impossible because we can't place both Rosa and Thomas in 4 seats when we have 6 people. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

If we fix Pierre's position, the two seats next to him are off-limits. So, the remaining seats are 7 - 1 - 2 = 4 seats. So, the 4 seats are not adjacent to Pierre. Therefore, Rosa and Thomas can be placed in these 4 seats, but we have 4 people to place: Rosa, Thomas, and the other 2 people.

Wait, so we have 4 seats, and 4 people: Rosa, Thomas, and two others. So, we can arrange these 4 people in the 4 seats in 4! ways.

But we need to ensure that Rosa and Thomas are not sitting next to each other. Wait, but in this case, they are not next to each other because the seats are not adjacent. So, all arrangements would satisfy the condition that Rosa and Thomas are not sitting next to each other.

Wait, but in this case, we have 4 seats, 4 people, no restrictions. So, the number of arrangements is 4! = 24.

But wait, that seems low because the total number of arrangements without restrictions is 6! = 720, and we fixed Pierre's position, so the total arrangements are 720. But if we have 24 arrangements where Rosa and Thomas are not sitting next to each other, that seems too low.

Wait, no, because we fixed Pierre's position, but the condition is about Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas not sitting next to each other. So, in this case, since we fixed Pierre, the condition is satisfied because Rosa and Thomas are not adjacent to each other or to Pierre.

Wait, no, actually, the condition is that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other. So, in this arrangement, since we fixed Pierre, and placed Rosa and Thomas in the non-adjacent seats, we are ensuring that Rosa and Thomas are not next to Pierre, but they can be next to each other.

Wait, but the condition is that no two of them can sit next to each other. So, is it sufficient that Rosa and Thomas are not next to each other? Or does it also require that Pierre is not sitting next to either?

Yes, the problem says "no two of the 3 people can sit next to each other." So, all three cannot be adjacent to each other. So, in the arrangement where Rosa and Thomas are not next to each other, but Pierre is next to one of them, that's still allowed? Wait, no, because all three should not be adjacent. So, if Pierre is sitting next to Rosa, then Pierre and Rosa are adjacent, which violates the condition.

Wait, so if we fix Pierre's position, and place Rosa and Thomas in seats that are not adjacent to each other or to each other's neighbors, that would satisfy the condition. But in this case, since we fixed Pierre's seat, and the two seats next to him are forbidden for Rosa and Thomas, then Rosa and Thomas can be placed in the remaining seats, but not adjacent to each other.

Wait, no, because if we fix Pierre's seat, and the two seats next to him are off-limits, then Rosa and Thomas have to be placed in the remaining 4 seats, but the 4 seats are all non-adjacent to each other? Wait, no, the 4 seats are in a straight line? Or are they spread out?

Wait, in a circular table, fixing Pierre's seat, the two seats next to him are off-limits, so the remaining seats are 4 in number. But in a circular table with 7 seats, if Pierre is fixed, the seats are arranged as follows: seat 1: Pierre, seat 2: next to him, seat 3: next to seat 2, seat 4: next to seat 3, seat 5: next to seat 4, seat 6: next to seat 5, seat 7: next to seat 6. So, if Pierre is fixed at seat 1, seats 2 and 7 are off-limits for Rosa and Thomas.

Therefore, the remaining seats available for Rosa and Thomas are seats 3, 4, 5, 6. So, these are four seats, all of which are not adjacent to each other because they are in the middle of the circle. So, in this case, Rosa and Thomas can be placed in these four seats without being adjacent to each other.

Therefore, the number of ways is:

1. Fix Pierre's seat: 1 way.

2. Place Rosa and Thomas in the 4 available seats: 4P2 = 12 ways.

3. Place the remaining 3 people in the remaining 3 seats: 3! = 6 ways.

So, total arrangements: 1 * 12 * 6 = 72.

But wait, that's 72 arrangements. But earlier, using inclusion-exclusion, I got 288. These are conflicting results. Hmm.

Wait, but in the inclusion-exclusion approach, I didn't fix anyone's position. So, maybe that approach was wrong because it didn't consider the circular nature properly.

Wait, let me think again.

In the inclusion-exclusion method, we had:

Total arrangements: 720.

Number of arrangements where at least one pair is sitting together: 432.

Thus, the number of valid arrangements is 720 - 432 = 288.

But in the second method, fixing Pierre's position, we got 72.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, 288 seems too high because 72 is much lower. Hmm, but 288 is the number when we didn't fix any position, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps not. Wait, hold on, in circular permutations, fixing one person's position reduces the count by a factor of n, so 720 /7 = 102.857... which is not integer, so perhaps that approach is not correct.

Wait, no, actually, in circular permutations, fixing one person's position is a valid technique, but the total number is (n-1)!.

Wait, so in the first method, without fixing, the total number is 720, which is correct because it's (7-1)!.

So, maybe the second approach, fixing Pierre's position, is incorrect.

Wait, why? Because when we fix Pierre's position, the constraints are different. In the problem, we need to arrange all 7 people, but with constraints on three specific people. So, perhaps fixing one person doesn't account for rotational symmetry correctly?

Wait, no, fixing one person's position is a standard technique in circular permutations, and it should give the correct count.

Wait, but let's see. If I fix Pierre's position, the remaining 6 people can be arranged in 6! = 720 ways. But in our problem, we have constraints on Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.

Wait, so if we fix Pierre's position, the two seats next to him are off-limits for Rosa and Thomas. Therefore, we have 4 seats left for Rosa and Thomas, and 3 seats for the other people.

Wait, so the number of arrangements would be:

1. Fix Pierre: 1 way.

2. Place Rosa and Thomas in the 4 available seats: P(4,2) = 12 ways.

3. Place the remaining 3 people in the remaining 3 seats: 3! = 6 ways.

So, total arrangements: 1 * 12 * 6 = 72.

But in the inclusion-exclusion method, I got 288. So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the inclusion-exclusion method, I considered all possible arrangements, but when I fixed Pierre's position, I didn't consider all the possible arrangements where Pierre is fixed, but the problem is not necessarily about fixing a person's position. Wait, no, the inclusion-exclusion method should already account for all possible arrangements, considering all rotations as the same.

Wait, but in the second method, we are fixing Pierre's position, so we should not be overcounting.

Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion method is correct, and the second method is undercounting because it doesn't consider all possible arrangements.

Wait, maybe we need to adjust the second method. So, let's see.

If I fix Pierre's position, the number of ways to arrange the remaining 6 people is 6! = 720. But we have constraints on Rosa and Thomas.

So, we need to place Rosa and Thomas in such a way that they are not adjacent to each other or to Pierre.

Wait, but since Pierre is fixed, the seats adjacent to him are off-limits, so Rosa and Thomas have to be placed in the remaining 4 seats.

But in the remaining 4 seats, we have 4 people: Rosa, Thomas, and the other 2 people.

Wait, so the number of ways to arrange these 4 people in 4 seats is 4! = 24. However, we need to ensure that Rosa and Thomas are not sitting next to each other. But since the 4 seats are not adjacent to each other (they are in a straight line if you imagine the circle), so in this case, Rosa and Thomas can be placed anywhere, and since they are not adjacent, this condition is automatically satisfied.

Wait, so is that correct? So, if we fix Pierre's position, the number of arrangements where Rosa and Thomas are not sitting next to each other is 4! = 24, and the other 2 people can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways.

Wait, that would be 24 * 2 = 48.

But wait, no, because in the remaining 4 seats, we have 4 people: Rosa, Thomas, and two others. So, the number of ways to arrange them is 4! = 24, but we don't need to consider arrangements where Rosa and Thomas are adjacent because they are not adjacent in the remaining seats.

Wait, no, actually, the remaining seats are not adjacent to each other, so Rosa and Thomas can be placed anywhere, and the condition is automatically satisfied because they are not adjacent.

So, the number of ways is 4! = 24, and the other two people can be arranged in the remaining two seats in 2! = 2 ways. So, total arrangements: 24 * 2 = 48.

But wait, how does this relate to the previous method? If we fix Pierre's position, the total number of arrangements is 48, but the total circular arrangements is 720, which is much larger. So, 48 is way too low.

Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps the problem is that fixing Pierre's position is not the right way to account for all possible arrangements.

Wait, no, actually, if we fix Pierre's position, we are considering all possible arrangements where Pierre is fixed, but the rest can be arranged in any way. So, the number of arrangements with Pierre fixed is 6! = 720, but this includes arrangements where other people are sitting next to each other. However, in our problem, we need to exclude arrangements where any two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are sitting next to each other.

Wait, but if we fix Pierre's position, then Rosa and Thomas cannot be seated next to him or next to each other. So, in the remaining 4 seats, we have to place Rosa and Thomas such that they are not adjacent to each other or to Pierre.

Wait, but in the remaining 4 seats, which are not adjacent to each other, so placing Rosa and Thomas in these seats automatically satisfies the condition that they are not next to each other.

Therefore, the number of ways to arrange Rosa and Thomas is 4P2 = 12, as we thought earlier, and the other two people can be arranged in the remaining two seats in 2! = 2 ways.

So, total number of arrangements is 12 * 2 = 24.

But wait, that's just the number of arrangements where Pierre is fixed. Since we fixed Pierre's position, the total number of circular arrangements is 720, but in the fixed position, it's 24. But that can't be the case because the total number of arrangements is 720, and we fixed Pierre's position, so the number should be 720.

Wait, I'm confused.

Wait, no, in circular permutations, fixing one position gives (n-1)! arrangements. So, for 7 people, it's 720. But when we fix Pierre's position, the number of arrangements is 6! = 720, which is same as the total number. So, that's correct.

But in this case, when we fix Pierre's position, the number of arrangements where Rosa and Thomas are not sitting next to each other is 4! = 24, which is the number of arrangements with Pierre fixed, Rosa and Thomas not adjacent, and the others arranged.

Wait, but that's only 24, which is much less than 720. So, seems like fixing Pierre's position is not the way to go.

Wait, maybe my initial approach was wrong.

Wait, let me try again.

Total number of circular arrangements: 720.

Number of arrangements where at least one of the pairs (Pierre, Rosa), (Pierre, Thomas), (Rosa, Thomas) is sitting together: 432.

Therefore, number of valid arrangements: 720 - 432 = 288.

But when I fixed Pierre's position, I got 72, which is much lower.

So, why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, maybe because when I fixed Pierre's position, I considered the problem as if it's a straight line, not a circle. So, in that case, the constraints are different.

Wait, in a circular table, fixing one person's position allows us to treat the problem as linear, because the ends are connected. So, perhaps that approach is correct, but in my first method, I didn't account for the circular nature properly.

Wait, in the first method, when I fixed Pierre's position, I considered the two seats next to him as off-limits, but in reality, the circular table's rotational symmetry is already accounted for by fixing one person.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me see the inclusion-exclusion result: 288. Let me see if that makes sense.

If I think of it as 720 total arrangements, subtract the 432 that have at least one pair sitting together, gives 288.

Alternatively, let's compute the number of arrangements where no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are adjacent.

So, perhaps the correct answer is indeed 288.

But let me think about the other approach where I fixed Pierre's position. If I fix Pierre, then Rosa and Thomas have to be placed in the remaining seats, ensuring they are not adjacent to each other or to Pierre.

So, fixing Pierre's position, the two seats next to him are off-limits, so Rosa and Thomas have to be placed in the remaining 4 seats.

But the 4 seats are not adjacent to each other, so placing Rosa and Thomas anywhere in those 4 seats won't result in them being adjacent to each other. Therefore, the number of ways is:

1. Fix Pierre: 1.

2. Place Rosa and Thomas in 4 seats: P(4,2) = 12.

3. Place the other 2 people in the remaining 2 seats: 2! = 2.

So, total arrangements: 1 * 12 * 2 = 24.

Wait, but that's only for one specific arrangement of Pierre's seat? No, no, when we fix Pierre's seat, the total number is 6! = 720, but the number of arrangements where Rosa and Thomas are not adjacent is 24.

But that can't be right because 24 is the number of arrangements with Pierre fixed, but the total circular arrangements is 720.

Wait, perhaps not. Wait, if we fix Pierre's seat, the number of valid arrangements is 24, but the total number of circular arrangements is 720, which is 6 times larger. So, perhaps each circular arrangement is counted 6 times when we fix any of the 7 people.

Therefore, the number of circular arrangements where no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are adjacent is 24 / 6 = 4. But that can't be, because 4 is too small.

Wait, no, that approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as arranging the 7 people around the table with restrictions.

Wait, another approach: treat the problem as placing 7 people around a table, with three specific people not adjacent. So, the total number of arrangements is 720. The number of arrangements where all three are not adjacent is equal to total arrangements minus the arrangements where at least two are adjacent.

Which is the inclusion-exclusion result: 720 - 432 = 288.

So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it directly.

So, to compute the number of circular arrangements where no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are adjacent, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

But let's see:

First, total arrangements: 720.

Number of arrangements where at least one pair is together: 432.

Therefore, arrangements where no two of them are together: 720 - 432 = 288.

So, that's the number of valid arrangements.

Alternatively, another way is to use the formula for circular arrangements with restrictions.

The formula is:

Number of circular arrangements = (n - 1)! - [C(3,1)*2*(n - 2)! - C(3,2)*2!*(n - 3)! + C(3,3)*3!*(n - 4)!]

But wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, actually, in the inclusion-exclusion for circular arrangements, the formula is:

Number of valid arrangements = (n - 1)! - C(3,1)*(n - 2)! + C(3,2)*(n - 3)! - C(3,3)*(n - 4)!.

Wait, but that seems similar to the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Wait, let me see.

Number of circular arrangements where no two of the three are adjacent = total arrangements - arrangements with at least one pair adjacent.

Which is 720 - 432 = 288.

So, that's the answer.

Therefore, I think 288 is the correct answer.

Wait, but I had another approach where I fixed Pierre's seat, and it came out as 24, but that was incorrect, because fixing Pierre's seat treated the problem as a linear arrangement, which it is not.

So, in circular arrangements, fixing one person's position is a standard technique to avoid overcounting due to rotational symmetry.

Therefore, in conclusion, the number of valid arrangements is 288.

**Final Answer**
The number of ways is \boxed{288}.

To determine the number of ways 7 people can sit around a round table such that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

1. **Total number of circular arrangements**: For 7 people, the total number of circular arrangements is \((7-1)! = 720\).

2. **Number of arrangements where at least one pair is sitting together**:
   - **Each specific pair (Pierre, Rosa), (Pierre, Thomas), (Rosa, Thomas)**: Each pair can be treated as a single block. The number of arrangements for each pair is \(2 \times (6-1)! = 2 \times 120 = 240\). Since there are 3 pairs, we initially think it's \(3 \times 240 = 720\), but this counts each arrangement multiple times.
   - **Using inclusion-exclusion principle**:
     - **|A ∪ B ∪ C|**: The number of arrangements where at least one pair is together is calculated as:
       \[
       |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|
       \]
       - Each \(|A|, |B|, |C| = 240\)
       - Each \(|A ∩ B|, |A ∩ C|, |B ∩ C| = 144\)
       - Each \(|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 144\)
       \[
       |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 240 \times 3 - 144 \times 3 + 144 = 720 - 432 + 144 = 432
       \]

3. **Number of valid arrangements**: Subtract the number of arrangements where at least one pair is together from the total arrangements.
   \[
   \text{Number of valid arrangements} = 720 - 432 = 288
   \]

Thus, the number of ways in which 7 people can sit around a round table such that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other is \(\boxed{288}\).
