Question:
In the circle with center $Q$, radii $AQ$ and $BQ$ form a right angle. The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, as shown. The radius of the circle with center $Q$ is 14 inches. What is the radius of the smaller semicircle? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Correct Answer:
Let $C$ and $D$ be the centers of the larger and smaller semicircles, respectively, and let $r$ be the radius of the smaller semicircle.  We have $QD=QB-DB=14-r$ and $QC=7$, so we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $QCD$ to obtain  \[
(14-r)^2+7^2=(7+r)^2.
\] After squaring both binomials and subtracting $7^2+r^2$ from both sides simplifies to $196-28r=14r$.  Adding $28r$ to both sides and dividing by 42, we find $r=\boxed{\frac{14}{3}}$ inches.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

There's a circle with center Q, and radii AQ and BQ form a right angle. So, AQ and BQ are perpendicular. The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, and the radius of the circle centered at Q is 14 inches. I need to find the radius of the smaller semicircle, expressed as a common fraction.

Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this. There's a big circle with center Q. From Q, two radii AQ and BQ are drawn, forming a right angle, meaning angle AQB is 90 degrees. So, points A and B are on the circumference of the circle, and the angle between AQ and BQ is a right angle. Therefore, triangle AQB is a right-angled triangle with legs equal to the radii AQ and BQ, and hypotenuse AB.

Since AQ and BQ are both radii of the big circle, each is 14 inches. So, triangle AQB is a right-angled isosceles triangle with legs of 14 inches each. The hypotenuse AB can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

Let me compute AB first. In a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse squared is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So,

AB² = AQ² + BQ²
AB² = 14² + 14²
AB² = 196 + 196
AB² = 392
AB = sqrt(392)
Simplify sqrt(392): 392 is 49*8, so sqrt(49*8) = 7*sqrt(8) = 7*2*sqrt(2) = 14*sqrt(2). So, AB is 14*sqrt(2) inches.

Now, the problem mentions two smaller regions that are tangent semicircles. These semicircles are probably the semicircles that are on the sides of triangle AQB. So, one semicircle is above AB, and the other is below AB, each tangent to each other.

Wait, but the problem says the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles. Maybe each semicircle is on one side of AB, and they are both tangent to each other. So, each semicircle is drawn inside the bigger circle, and they are tangent to each other.

So, the big circle has radius 14 inches, and the two smaller semicircles are inside it, tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle AQB.

I need to find the radius of one of these smaller semicircles. Let me denote the radius of the smaller semicircle as r.

Since the semicircles are tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle, their centers must lie somewhere along the lines from Q to the sides. Let me think: in triangle AQB, since AQ and BQ are 14 inches each, and the angle between them is 90 degrees, the triangle is right-angled and isoceles.

The semicircles are tangent to each other, so the distance between their centers should be equal to the sum of their radii. But wait, both smaller semicircles have the same radius, right? The problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles," but doesn't specify if they have the same radius. Hmm, wait, actually, it says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." Hmm, maybe each region is a semicircle, so there are two semicircles, each tangent to each other.

Wait, maybe it's one semicircle on each side, but the problem says "the two smaller regions," so perhaps two semicircles, each tangent to each other.

Wait, perhaps the two smaller semicircles are each tangent to the sides AQ and BQ, and to each other, inside the bigger circle. So, each smaller semicircle is tangent to two sides of the triangle and also tangent to the other smaller semicircle.

Alternatively, maybe the smaller semicircles are each tangent to the sides AQ and BQ, and also tangent to the big circle. Hmm, but the problem says they are tangent semicircles, so maybe each is a semicircle whose diameter is along AQ or BQ, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." So, the regions themselves are semicircles. So, perhaps each region is a semicircle, and those two semicircles are tangent to each other.

Let me try to sketch this in my mind. The big circle with center Q. From Q, two radii AQ and BQ form a right angle. The two smaller regions are each a semicircle. So, each semicircle is either above or below the line AB. These two semicircles are tangent to each other. So, their centers are on AQ and BQ, respectively, each with radius r, and the distance between their centers is 2r, since they are tangent.

Wait, but if each semicircle is tangent to AQ and BQ, then their centers are at a distance r from AQ and BQ respectively. So, the centers of the semicircles would lie along the lines perpendicular to AQ and BQ, at a distance r from Q.

Wait, but AQ and BQ are themselves radii of the big circle, so AQ is 14 inches. If a semicircle is tangent to AQ, then the center of the semicircle must be at a distance r from AQ, but along AQ. Hmm, no, that might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps the semicircles are drawn with diameters along AQ and BQ. So, each semicircle has its diameter along AQ or BQ, each of length 2r, because their radius is r. So, one semicircle has diameter AQ, but then it's a semicircle with diameter AQ, so its radius is r, and it lies inside the big circle. Similarly, the other semicircle has diameter BQ.

But if the semicircles are tangent to each other, their centers must be a distance of 2r apart, since they have radius r each. But the centers of these semicircles would be at the midpoints of AQ and BQ, which are points (7,0) and (0,7) if Q is at (0,0). So, the distance between these two centers is sqrt((7)^2 + (7)^2) = 7*sqrt(2). But 7*sqrt(2) must equal 2r, so r = (7*sqrt(2))/2. But that is not a rational number, so probably not the correct interpretation.

Wait, but the problem says the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles. So, perhaps each region is a semicircle, and these two semicircles are tangent to each other, but not necessarily with their diameters along AQ and BQ.

Alternatively, maybe each semicircle is tangent to AQ and BQ, and also tangent to each other. Let me think.

Let me consider the big circle with center Q, and points A and B on the circumference such that angle AQB is 90 degrees. So, triangle AQB is right-angled at Q.

Now, there are two smaller regions inside the big circle, which are semicircles. They are tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle. So, each small semicircle is tangent to two sides of the triangle and also tangent to the other small semicircle.

So, perhaps each semicircle is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the other semicircle.

So, if I can model this, the centers of the small semicircles would be at a distance of r from AQ and r from BQ, and the distance between centers would be 2r.

Wait, but the centers lie along the angle bisectors of AQ and BQ. Since AQ and BQ are perpendicular, the angle bisectors would be at 45 degrees from each. So, the centers of the semicircles would lie along the lines y = x and y = -x, if AQ is along the x-axis and BQ is along the y-axis.

Wait, let's set up a coordinate system with Q at (0,0), AQ along the x-axis from (0,0) to (14,0), and BQ along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,14). Then, the triangle AQB is in the first quadrant with vertices at (14,0), (0,14), and (0,0).

Now, the two smaller semicircles are tangent to each other and to the sides AQ and BQ. So, each semicircle is tangent to one of the sides AQ or BQ, and the other semicircle is tangent to the other side.

Wait, but both semicircles are inside the big circle, so they must lie within the first quadrant as well.

Alternatively, perhaps each semicircle is tangent to one side of the triangle and the other semicircle, and the two semicircles are also tangent to each other.

Let me think about it. Let me denote the center of one semicircle as point C and the other as point D. Each semicircle is tangent to two sides of the triangle and also tangent to the other semicircle.

Given that, let's consider one semicircle. Let's say it is tangent to AQ and to the other semicircle. Since it is tangent to AQ, which is along the x-axis, the center of this semicircle must lie at a distance r from AQ, which is the y-coordinate. Similarly, if it's tangent to BQ, which is along the y-axis, the center must lie at a distance r from BQ, which is the x-coordinate.

Wait, but if the two centers are both at a distance r from their respective sides, then their coordinates would be (r, r) and (r, r) for both, which can't be unless they are the same point. So, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe each semicircle is tangent to one side and tangent to the other semicircle. So, one semicircle is tangent to AQ and the other semicircle, and the other semicircle is tangent to BQ and the first semicircle.

But then, each semicircle would have its center at (r, 0) and (0, r), but wait, that would place them on the axes, but they would not be tangent to each other. So, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the semicircles are both tangent to AQ and BQ, but on opposite sides. Wait, but AQ and BQ are perpendicular, so a semicircle tangent to both would have to be a quarter-circle, but the problem says semicircles.

Hmm, maybe each semicircle is tangent to one side and the other semicircle, but not to the sides AQ and BQ.

Alternatively, perhaps the two smaller regions are each a semicircle that is tangent to the big circle and tangent to each other and to one of the sides AQ or BQ.

Wait, maybe each semicircle is tangent to the big circle and to each other, and also tangent to one of the sides AQ or BQ.

Wait, let's try to model this.

Let me suppose that each small semicircle has radius r and is tangent to the side AQ (the x-axis) and the big circle. Similarly, the other small semicircle is tangent to BQ (the y-axis) and the big circle.

Wait, but if each semicircle is tangent to AQ and the big circle, their centers would lie along the lines x = r and y = 14 - r (if the big circle is centered at (0,0) with radius 14).

Wait, no, the center of a circle tangent to the x-axis and the big circle would be at (a, r) if it's in the first quadrant. Wait, perhaps.

Wait, let me think again. If a semicircle is tangent to AQ (the x-axis) and the big circle, then the center of this semicircle must be at a distance r from AQ, so the y-coordinate is r. Also, the distance from the center of the semicircle to the center Q (0,0) must be 14 - r, because the semicircle is inside the big circle and tangent to it.

So, the center of the semicircle would be at (d, r), where d is the x-coordinate. The distance from (d, r) to (0,0) is sqrt(d² + r²) = 14 - r.

So, sqrt(d² + r²) = 14 - r.

Squaring both sides, d² + r² = (14 - r)² = 196 - 28r + r².

Subtract r² from both sides: d² = 196 - 28r.

So, d = sqrt(196 - 28r).

Similarly, for the other semicircle, tangent to BQ (the y-axis) and the big circle, its center would be at (r, e), and the distance from (r, e) to (0,0) is sqrt(r² + e²) = 14 - r.

So, sqrt(r² + e²) = 14 - r.

Squaring both sides: r² + e² = (14 - r)² = 196 - 28r + r².

Subtract r² from both sides: e² = 196 - 28r.

So, e = sqrt(196 - 28r).

Wait, so both d and e are equal to sqrt(196 - 28r). So, the centers of the two small semicircles are at (sqrt(196 - 28r), r) and (r, sqrt(196 - 28r)).

But the problem states that the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, so perhaps the two semicircles are tangent to each other. So, the distance between their centers should be equal to r + r = 2r.

Wait, but if each small semicircle has radius r, then the distance between centers should be 2r for them to be tangent.

So, the distance between (sqrt(196 - 28r), r) and (r, sqrt(196 - 28r)) is sqrt[(sqrt(196 - 28r) - r)^2 + (sqrt(196 - 28r) - r)^2].

Simplify that:

sqrt[2*(sqrt(196 - 28r) - r)^2] = sqrt[2]*(sqrt(196 - 28r) - r).

This distance should equal 2r.

So,

sqrt(2)*(sqrt(196 - 28r) - r) = 2r.

Let me write that equation:

sqrt(2)*(sqrt(196 - 28r) - r) = 2r.

Let me divide both sides by sqrt(2):

sqrt(196 - 28r) - r = (2r)/sqrt(2) = r*sqrt(2).

So,

sqrt(196 - 28r) = r*sqrt(2) + r = r(sqrt(2) + 1).

Now, square both sides:

196 - 28r = [r(sqrt(2) + 1)]^2 = r²*(sqrt(2) + 1)^2.

Compute (sqrt(2) + 1)^2: that's (sqrt(2))^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*1 + 1^2 = 2 + 2*sqrt(2) + 1 = 3 + 2*sqrt(2).

So, equation becomes:

196 - 28r = r²*(3 + 2*sqrt(2)).

Now, let's bring all terms to one side:

r²*(3 + 2*sqrt(2)) + 28r - 196 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of r:

(3 + 2*sqrt(2))r² + 28r - 196 = 0.

Let me write it as:

(3 + 2√2)r² + 28r - 196 = 0.

To solve for r, I can use the quadratic formula. So, for an equation ax² + bx + c = 0,

r = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a).

Here, a = 3 + 2√2,

b = 28,

c = -196.

So, compute discriminant D = b² - 4ac.

First, compute b²: 28² = 784.

Then, compute 4ac: 4*(3 + 2√2)*(-196) = 4*(-196)*(3 + 2√2) = -784*(3 + 2√2).

So, D = 784 - (-784*(3 + 2√2)) = 784 + 784*(3 + 2√2).

Wait, that's 784 + 784*(3 + 2√2).

Let me factor out 784:

D = 784*(1 + 3 + 2√2) = 784*(4 + 2√2) = 784*2*(2 + √2) = 1568*(2 + √2).

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me compute D step by step.

D = b² - 4ac = 784 - 4*(3 + 2√2)*(-196).

Compute 4*(3 + 2√2)*(-196) = -4*196*(3 + 2√2) = -784*(3 + 2√2).

So, D = 784 - (-784*(3 + 2√2)) = 784 + 784*(3 + 2√2).

Factor 784:

D = 784*(1 + 3 + 2√2) = 784*(4 + 2√2).

Now, let me compute sqrt(D). So sqrt(784*(4 + 2√2)).

sqrt(784) is 28, so sqrt(D) = 28*sqrt(4 + 2√2).

Hmm, sqrt(4 + 2√2). Let me see if this can be expressed as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).

Suppose sqrt(4 + 2√2) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).

Then, 4 + 2√2 = a + b + 2*sqrt(ab).

Comparing, we have:

a + b = 4,

2*sqrt(ab) = 2√2 ⇒ sqrt(ab) = √2 ⇒ ab = 2.

So, solving a + b = 4 and ab = 2. Let me solve this system.

The solutions are the roots of x² - 4x + 2 = 0.

x = [4 ± sqrt(16 - 8)]/2 = [4 ± sqrt(8)]/2 = [4 ± 2√2]/2 = 2 ± √2.

So, a = 2 + √2, b = 2 - √2.

Thus, sqrt(4 + 2√2) = sqrt(2 + √2) + sqrt(2 - √2). Wait, but that seems more complicated than I thought. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just keep it as sqrt(4 + 2√2). Alternatively, I can rationalize it.

But maybe I can just compute sqrt(4 + 2√2) numerically, but perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, let me check if 4 + 2√2 can be expressed as (sqrt(2) + 1)^2. Let me compute:

(sqrt(2) + 1)^2 = 2 + 2*sqrt(2) + 1 = 3 + 2*sqrt(2), which is less than 4 + 2√2.

Wait, alternatively, maybe (sqrt(3) + 1)^2 = 3 + 2*sqrt(3) + 1 = 4 + 2*sqrt(3), which is more than 4 + 2√2.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to accept that sqrt(4 + 2√2) is as simplified as it can get.

So, going back, sqrt(D) = 28*sqrt(4 + 2√2).

Now, plug back into the quadratic formula:

r = [-b ± sqrt(D)] / (2a) = [-28 ± 28*sqrt(4 + 2√2)] / [2*(3 + 2√2)].

Factor 28 from the numerator:

r = [28*(-1 ± sqrt(4 + 2√2))]/[2*(3 + 2√2)] = [14*(-1 ± sqrt(4 + 2√2))]/[3 + 2√2].

Since radius can't be negative, we'll take the positive root:

r = [14*(-1 + sqrt(4 + 2√2))]/[3 + 2√2].

Hmm, perhaps we can rationalize the denominator or simplify this expression.

Let me rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by (3 - 2√2):

So,

r = [14*(-1 + sqrt(4 + 2√2))*(3 - 2√2)] / [(3 + 2√2)(3 - 2√2)].

Compute denominator: 9 - (2√2)^2 = 9 - 8 = 1.

So, denominator is 1, so it's just the numerator:

r = 14*(-1 + sqrt(4 + 2√2))*(3 - 2√2).

Let me compute the numerator:

First, expand (-1 + sqrt(4 + 2√2))*(3 - 2√2).

Let me compute term by term:

-1*(3 - 2√2) = -3 + 2√2,

sqrt(4 + 2√2)*(3 - 2√2).

Let me compute sqrt(4 + 2√2) as S for now.

So, S = sqrt(4 + 2√2).

Then, S*(3 - 2√2) = 3S - 2√2 S.

So, the entire expression is:

-3 + 2√2 + 3S - 2√2 S.

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should instead use the quadratic equation and try to find r numerically, but since the problem expects an exact answer, perhaps there's a smarter approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider similar triangles or use some geometric properties.

Wait, another approach: since the two smaller regions are semicircles, each tangent to AQ, BQ, and the big circle, and tangent to each other.

Alternatively, maybe the centers of the small semicircles lie on the angle bisectors of AQ and BQ, which are at 45 degrees to each other.

Wait, given that, maybe I can model the centers of the small semicircles as lying along the bisectors at 45 degrees from AQ and BQ.

Wait, but perhaps that's not the right way to think about it.

Alternatively, let me consider the centers of the small semicircles. Each center is at a distance r from AQ and BQ, so their coordinates would be (r, r) if considering AQ as the x-axis and BQ as the y-axis. Wait, but if AQ and BQ are at 90 degrees, then the center of a semicircle tangent to both would indeed be at (r, r). But then, if both small semicircles are tangent to each other, their centers would be separated by 2r.

Wait, but if their centers are at (r, r) and (r, r), then the distance between them is zero, which can't be. So, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the small semicircles are not both tangent to both AQ and BQ, but each is tangent to one of them and the big circle.

Wait, perhaps one semicircle is tangent to AQ and the big circle, and the other is tangent to BQ and the big circle.

Then, their centers would be at (d, r) and (r, e), where d and e are as I found earlier, sqrt(196 - 28r).

And since the two semicircles are tangent to each other, the distance between (d, r) and (r, e) is 2r. So, let me write that:

sqrt[(d - r)^2 + (r - e)^2] = 2r.

Which is exactly the equation I had before, leading to the quadratic equation which seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I can find a smarter substitution.

Wait, let me denote s = sqrt(196 - 28r). Then, d = s and e = s.

But then, the distance between centers is sqrt[(s - r)^2 + (s - r)^2] = sqrt(2*(s - r)^2) = sqrt(2)*(s - r).

And that should equal 2r, so:

sqrt(2)*(s - r) = 2r.

Which simplifies to s - r = (2r)/sqrt(2) = r*sqrt(2).

Thus, s = r + r*sqrt(2) = r(1 + sqrt(2)).

But s was defined as sqrt(196 - 28r).

So,

sqrt(196 - 28r) = r(1 + sqrt(2)).

Squaring both sides:

196 - 28r = r²*(1 + sqrt(2))².

Compute (1 + sqrt(2))²:

= 1 + 2*sqrt(2) + 2 = 3 + 2*sqrt(2).

So,

196 - 28r = r²*(3 + 2*sqrt(2)).

Which is the same equation as before.

So, same quadratic equation: (3 + 2*sqrt(2))r² + 28r - 196 = 0.

So, same quadratic in r.

Hmm, maybe I can factor it or find a rational root.

Let me try possible rational roots. The possible roots are factors of 196 divided by factors of (3 + 2√2). But that's complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution.

Let me let u = sqrt(2). Then, the equation becomes:

(3 + 2u) r² + 28r - 196 = 0.

Which is:

(3 + 2u)r² + 28r - 196 = 0.

Wait, perhaps I can use the quadratic formula again, but maybe in terms of u.

Let me compute the discriminant:

D = (28)^2 - 4*(3 + 2u)*(-196).

Which is 784 - 4*(3 + 2u)*(-196) = 784 + 4*196*(3 + 2u).

Compute 4*196 = 784, so:

D = 784 + 784*(3 + 2u) = 784*(1 + 3 + 2u) = 784*(4 + 2u).

Which is the same as before.

So, sqrt(D) = sqrt(784*(4 + 2u)) = 28*sqrt(4 + 2u).

So, r = [-28 ± 28*sqrt(4 + 2u)] / [2*(3 + 2u)].

Which simplifies to:

r = [ -28 ± 28*sqrt(4 + 2u) ] / (6 + 4u).

Factor 28 and 2:

= [28*(-1 ± sqrt(4 + 2u))]/[2*(3 + 2u)].

= [14*(-1 ± sqrt(4 + 2u))]/(3 + 2u).

Since radius can't be negative, we take the positive solution:

r = [14*(-1 + sqrt(4 + 2u))]/(3 + 2u).

Where u = sqrt(2).

Hmm, perhaps this is the simplest form, but it's still not a rational number. The problem expects a common fraction, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I need to take a different approach. Let me consider that each smaller semicircle is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the big circle. So, each small semicircle has radius r, and their centers are at a distance r from AQ and BQ, so their centers are at (r, r) if AQ and BQ are the axes. But then, the distance between these centers would be sqrt[(r - r)^2 + (r - r)^2] = 0, which can't be because they are tangent. So, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe each small semicircle is tangent to one of AQ or BQ, and to the big circle, and also tangent to the other small semicircle. So, perhaps each small semicircle has radius r, and their centers are at (r, 0) and (0, r). But then, the distance between centers is sqrt(r² + r²) = r*sqrt(2). Since the two small semicircles are tangent, that distance should equal 2r, so r*sqrt(2) = 2r → sqrt(2) = 2, which is not true.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the centers aren't at (r, 0) and (0, r). Alternatively, maybe they are at (a, 0) and (0, a), and the distance between them is 2r, so sqrt(a² + a²) = 2r → a*sqrt(2) = 2r → a = r*sqrt(2). But then, each center is at (r*sqrt(2), 0) and (0, r*sqrt(2)), but the distance from the center to the big circle's center (0,0) must be 14 - r.

Wait, let me check that.

For the center at (r*sqrt(2), 0), the distance from (0,0) is r*sqrt(2). So, this should equal 14 - r, so:

r*sqrt(2) = 14 - r.

So, r*sqrt(2) + r = 14.

Factor out r: r(sqrt(2) + 1) = 14.

Thus, r = 14 / (sqrt(2) + 1).

Rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(2) - 1):

r = [14*(sqrt(2) - 1)] / [(sqrt(2) + 1)(sqrt(2) - 1)] = [14*(sqrt(2) - 1)] / (2 - 1) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) = 14sqrt(2) - 14.

But that's a huge radius, more than 14, which can't be because the big circle has radius 14. So, that's impossible. So, my assumption that both centers are at (r*sqrt(2), 0) and (0, r) is wrong.

Wait, perhaps each small semicircle is tangent to one of AQ or BQ, and the other small semicircle, but not both. So, one is tangent to AQ, and the other is tangent to BQ, and both are tangent to each other and to the big circle.

Wait, that might make more sense. So, one center is at (r, 0), and the other is at (0, r). The distance between them is sqrt(r² + r²) = r*sqrt(2). Since they are tangent, this distance should be 2r, so:

r*sqrt(2) = 2r → sqrt(2) = 2, which is not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the distance between centers is equal to r + r = 2r, so:

r*sqrt(2) = 2r → sqrt(2) = 2, which again is impossible.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.

Since the two smaller regions are semicircles and are tangent to each other and to the sides AQ and BQ, perhaps each is tangent to one of the sides and to the other semicircle.

Wait, perhaps the two smaller semicircles are each tangent to one of the sides AQ and BQ, and to the other small semicircle, and also tangent to the big circle.

So, each small semicircle is tangent to the big circle, to one of the sides, and to the other small semicircle.

Wait, that might make sense. So, each small semicircle is tangent to AQ or BQ, the big circle, and the other small semicircle.

So, let me denote the radius of each small semicircle as r.

Since each is tangent to AQ or BQ, their centers are at a distance r from AQ or BQ. So, if I consider AQ as the x-axis, the center of the small semicircle tangent to AQ would be at (r, 0), and the one tangent to BQ would be at (0, r).

Wait, but then, the distance between (r, 0) and (0, r) is sqrt(r² + r²) = r*sqrt(2). Since the two small semicircles are tangent to each other, this distance should be 2r, so:

r*sqrt(2) = 2r → sqrt(2) = 2, which is impossible.

Hmm, so that approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe each small semicircle is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the big circle, but not necessarily at the same distance. Wait, but if they are tangent to AQ and BQ, their centers must be at distance r from those sides, so their centers would be at (r, r) for each, but that would place them at the same point, making them not a semicircle.

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that each small semicircle is tangent to one side and to the big circle, and tangent to the other small semicircle.

So, one small semicircle is tangent to AQ, the other to BQ, and both tangent to each other and to the big circle.

Let me denote the center of the small semicircle tangent to AQ as (d, r), since it's at distance r from AQ, which is the x-axis. Similarly, the center of the one tangent to BQ would be (r, e).

Then, the distance between (d, r) and (r, e) should be 2r, as they are tangent.

So,

sqrt[(d - r)^2 + (r - e)^2] = 2r.

Additionally, both centers must be at a distance of 14 - r from the center (0,0) of the big circle.

Thus,

sqrt(d² + r²) = 14 - r,

sqrt(r² + e²) = 14 - r.

Squaring both:

d² + r² = (14 - r)^2 = 196 - 28r + r²,

so d² = 196 - 28r,

Similarly, e² = 196 - 28r.

So, d = sqrt(196 - 28r),

and e = sqrt(196 - 28r).

Now, plug into the distance equation:

sqrt[(sqrt(196 - 28r) - r)^2 + (r - sqrt(196 - 28r))^2] = 2r.

Let me expand the terms inside the square root.

Let me denote s = sqrt(196 - 28r).

Then,

sqrt[(s - r)^2 + (r - s)^2] = sqrt[2(s - r)^2] = sqrt(2)*|s - r|.

Since s = sqrt(196 - 28r) and r is positive, and 196 - 28r must be positive, so r < 196/28 = 7.

So, s = sqrt(196 - 28r) is less than 14, and r is positive, so s - r could be positive or negative.

Wait, but since the centers are at (s, r) and (r, s), the distance between them is sqrt(2)*(s - r). Hmm, but if s > r, then it's positive, otherwise negative. But since the distance can't be negative, it's sqrt(2)*(s - r).

Wait, but s = sqrt(196 - 28r) and r = r.

So, setting sqrt(2)*(s - r) = 2r,

s - r = 2r / sqrt(2) = r*sqrt(2),

so s = r*sqrt(2) + r.

But s = sqrt(196 - 28r),

So,

sqrt(196 - 28r) = r*(sqrt(2) + 1).

Now, square both sides:

196 - 28r = r²*(sqrt(2) + 1)^2.

Compute (sqrt(2) + 1)^2 = 3 + 2*sqrt(2).

So,

196 - 28r = r²*(3 + 2*sqrt(2)).

Rearranged:

r²*(3 + 2*sqrt(2)) + 28r - 196 = 0.

Again, same quadratic equation as before.

So, solving this:

r = [-28 ± sqrt(28² + 4*(3 + 2*sqrt(2))*196)] / [2*(3 + 2*sqrt(2))].

Compute discriminant:

sqrt(28²) = 784,

4*(3 + 2*sqrt(2))*196 = 4*196*(3 + 2*sqrt(2)) = 784*(3 + 2*sqrt(2)).

So, D = 784 + 784*(3 + 2*sqrt(2)) = 784*(1 + 3 + 2*sqrt(2)) = 784*(4 + 2*sqrt(2)).

So, sqrt(D) = sqrt(784*(4 + 2*sqrt(2))) = 28*sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)).

Thus,

r = [-28 ± 28*sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2))]/[2*(3 + 2*sqrt(2))].

We take the positive solution:

r = [28*(sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)) - 1)]/[2*(3 + 2*sqrt(2))].

Simplify:

r = [14*(sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)) - 1)]/[3 + 2*sqrt(2)].

To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (3 - 2*sqrt(2)):

r = [14*(sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)) - 1)*(3 - 2*sqrt(2))]/[(3 + 2*sqrt(2))(3 - 2*sqrt(2))].

Denominator becomes 9 - (2*sqrt(2))^2 = 9 - 8 = 1.

So,

r = 14*(sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)) - 1)*(3 - 2*sqrt(2)).

Now, let's compute (sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)))*(3 - 2*sqrt(2)).

Let me denote this as S*(3 - 2*sqrt(2)), where S = sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)).

Compute S*(3 - 2*sqrt(2)):

= 3*S - 2*sqrt(2)*S.

But S² = 4 + 2*sqrt(2), so S = sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)).

Let me compute S*(3 - 2*sqrt(2)):

= 3*sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)) - 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)).

Hmm, perhaps I can factor sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)):

= sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)) * [3 - 2*sqrt(2)].

Wait, maybe I can compute (3 - 2*sqrt(2))²:

= 9 + 8 - 12*sqrt(2) = 17 - 12*sqrt(2).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can express sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)) in a different form.

Wait, as I thought earlier, sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)) can be written as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), so:

sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).

Squaring both sides: 4 + 2*sqrt(2) = a + b + 2*sqrt(ab).

So, equating the terms,

a + b = 4,

2*sqrt(ab) = 2*sqrt(2) ⇒ sqrt(ab) = sqrt(2) ⇒ ab = 2.

So, solving a + b = 4 and ab = 2.

This leads to the quadratic equation x² - 4x + 2 = 0.

Solutions are x = [4 ± sqrt(16 - 8)]/2 = [4 ± sqrt(8)]/2 = [4 ± 2*sqrt(2)]/2 = 2 ± sqrt(2).

Therefore, sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2 + sqrt(2)) + sqrt(2 - sqrt(2)).

Wait, but that seems more complicated. Maybe I can just leave it as sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)).

Wait, perhaps we can compute the product numerically to check.

Compute 4 + 2*sqrt(2):

sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142,

So, 2*sqrt(2) ≈ 2.8284,

Thus, 4 + 2.8284 ≈ 6.8284,

So, sqrt(6.8284) ≈ 2.6131.

So, sqrt(4 + 2*sqrt(2)) ≈ 2.6131.

Similarly, 3 - 2*sqrt(2) ≈ 3 - 2.8284 ≈ 0.1716.

So, 2.6131 * 0.1716 ≈ 0.448.

So, the entire expression becomes:

r ≈ 14*(0.448) ≈ 6.272.

Wait, but that can't be, since the radius is 6.272, and the big circle has radius 14, so this seems too large. So, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the mistake was in setting the centers at (r, 0) and (0, r). Maybe the centers are at (r, r), as I initially thought, but that leads to the same problem.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the two small semicircles are each tangent to one side, the other small semicircle, and the big circle. So, one small semicircle is tangent to AQ, the other to BQ, and both tangent to each other and to the big circle.

Let me denote the centers as (r, 0) for the semicircle tangent to AQ, and (0, r) for the one tangent to BQ. Then, the distance between these centers is sqrt(r² + r²) = r*sqrt(2), and since they are tangent, this distance should be 2r, so r*sqrt(2) = 2r ⇒ sqrt(2) = 2, which is impossible.

Hmm, so maybe each small semicircle is tangent to one side, the big circle, and the other small semicircle, but not necessarily at the same distance from the sides.

Wait, perhaps each small semicircle is tangent to one side, the big circle, and the other small semicircle. So, one small semicircle is tangent to AQ and the other small semicircle and the big circle, and vice versa.

Wait, perhaps each is tangent to one of the sides and the big circle, and their centers lie along the angle bisector, which is 45 degrees from both AQ and BQ.

Wait, given that, perhaps each center is at a distance of r from AQ and BQ, and the distance from the center to the big circle's center is 14 - r.

So, let me denote the centers as (d, d) and (d, d), but that would place them on the same point, which isn't possible. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, if the centers are on the angle bisector at 45 degrees, then their coordinates would be (d, d), where d is the distance from the center along the bisector.

Wait, but the distance from the center to AQ is d, so that distance would be r, so d = r.

So, centers at (r, r), but then distance from center to big circle is sqrt(r² + r²) = r*sqrt(2) = 14 - r.

So,

r*sqrt(2) + r = 14,

r(sqrt(2) + 1) = 14,

r = 14 / (sqrt(2) + 1).

Rationalizing,

r = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/[(sqrt(2) + 1)(sqrt(2) - 1)] = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1)/(2 - 1) = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

Which is approximately 14*(1.4142 - 1) = 14*0.4142 ≈ 5.798, which is less than 14, so possible.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought of centers at (r, r), their distance from the big circle's center is r*sqrt(2), but if they are tangent, then r*sqrt(2) = 14 - r.

Wait, in that case,

r*sqrt(2) + r = 14,

r = 14/(sqrt(2) + 1) ≈ 5.798.

But then, the distance between centers would be sqrt(r² + r²) = r*sqrt(2) ≈ 5.798*1.414 ≈ 8.20, and 14 - r ≈ 14 - 5.798 ≈ 8.202, which is approximately equal, so it works.

Wait, but then, the two small semicircles each have radius 14/(sqrt(2) + 1), which is 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) after rationalizing.

Wait, 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) = 14*sqrt(2) - 14, which is about 19.798 - 14 = 5.798, which matches our earlier calculation.

But the problem says that the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, so maybe each is a semicircle, so perhaps the radius is indeed 14/(sqrt(2) + 1), which is 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

Wait, but the problem says "the radius of the smaller semicircle," implying there's only one, but in my previous thinking, I considered two. So, perhaps the problem is only referring to one of them, but given that, I think the approach is correct.

Wait, but let me confirm:

If the centers of the two small semicircles are at (r, r) and (r, r), but that's the same point, so that can't be. So, perhaps each small semicircle is tangent to one of the sides, the big circle, and the other small semicircle.

Wait, if I consider one small semicircle tangent to AQ, the other to BQ, and both to each other, their centers would be at (r, 0) and (0, r), but the distance between them is sqrt(r² + r²) = r*sqrt(2), so if they are tangent, this distance must be 2r, so:

r*sqrt(2) = 2r ⇒ sqrt(2) = 2 ⇒ 2 = sqrt(2), which is not true. So, that approach is invalid.

Hmm, perhaps the centers are not at (r, 0) and (0, r), but at different points. Maybe one is at (r, 0) and the other at (s, t), such that the distance between them is 2r and both are tangent to the big circle.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the two small semicircles are tangent to each other and to the big circle, but they are also tangent to one of the sides, AQ or BQ.

Let me assume that each small semicircle is tangent to AQ, and the other semicircle, and the big circle.

So, each small semicircle has radius r and is tangent to AQ, so their centers are at (r, 0) and (s, t), where t = r, since they're at distance r from AQ.

Wait, but then the distance between (r, 0) and (s, r) would be sqrt[(s - r)^2 + (r - 0)^2] = sqrt[(s - r)^2 + r^2].

Since they're tangent, this distance should be 2r, so:

sqrt[(s - r)^2 + r^2] = 2r,

Squaring both sides:

(s - r)^2 + r^2 = 4r^2,

→ (s - r)^2 = 3r^2,

→ s - r = ±sqrt(3) r,

→ s = r ± sqrt(3) r.

Since s must be positive, and if s > r, then s = r + sqrt(3) r = r(1 + sqrt(3)).

But s must be less than 14, so r(1 + sqrt(3)) < 14 ⇒ r < 14/(1 + sqrt(3)).

Again, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so 1 + sqrt(3) ≈ 2.732, so r < approx 5.128.

Also, the distance from (s, r) to the center of the big circle (0,0) must be 14 - r.

Compute sqrt(s^2 + r^2) = 14 - r.

So,

sqrt[(r(1 + sqrt(3)))^2 + r^2] = 14 - r,

Compute inside the sqrt:

= r²(1 + 2*sqrt(3) + 3) + r^2

= r²(4 + 2*sqrt(3)) + r^2

= r²(5 + 2*sqrt(3)).

So,

sqrt(r²(5 + 2*sqrt(3))) = 14 - r,

→ r*sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) = 14 - r,

→ r*sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) + r = 14,

→ r[sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) + 1] = 14,

→ r = 14 / [sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) + 1].

Let me rationalize this expression.

First, compute sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)).

Let me assume that sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) can be expressed as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).

So,

sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).

Squaring both sides:

5 + 2*sqrt(3) = a + b + 2*sqrt(ab).

Thus,

a + b = 5,

2*sqrt(ab) = 2*sqrt(3) ⇒ sqrt(ab) = sqrt(3) ⇒ ab = 3.

Thus, solving:

a + b = 5,

ab = 3.

This gives the quadratic equation x² - 5x + 3 = 0.

Solutions:

x = [5 ± sqrt(25 - 12)]/2 = [5 ± sqrt(13)]/2.

Hmm, not nice numbers, so perhaps this approach isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can compute sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) numerically:

sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732,

So, 5 + 2*1.732 ≈ 5 + 3.464 ≈ 8.464,

So, sqrt(8.464) ≈ 2.909.

So, sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 2.909,

So, sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) + 1 ≈ 3.909,

So, r ≈ 14 / 3.909 ≈ 3.58.

Hmm, that's a possible radius, but let me check if this works.

Wait, if r = 3.58, then s = r(1 + sqrt(3)) ≈ 3.58*(2.732) ≈ 9.76.

Then, the distance from (s, r) to (0,0) is sqrt(9.76² + 3.58²) ≈ sqrt(95.25 + 12.83) ≈ sqrt(108.08) ≈ 10.4, which should be equal to 14 - r ≈ 14 - 3.58 ≈ 10.42, which is close enough, considering rounding errors.

Wait, so perhaps r = 14 / [sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) + 1].

But we can rationalize this expression.

Let me write:

r = 14 / [sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) + 1].

Multiply numerator and denominator by [sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) - 1]:

r = [14*(sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) - 1)] / [ (sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) + 1)(sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) - 1) ]

Denominator becomes:

(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) - 1 = 4 + 2*sqrt(3).

So,

r = [14*(sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) - 1)] / (4 + 2*sqrt(3)).

Factor numerator and denominator:

= [14*(sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) - 1)] / [2*(2 + sqrt(3))].

But 5 + 2*sqrt(3) can be expressed as (sqrt(3) + 1)^2, since:

(sqrt(3) + 1)^2 = 3 + 2*sqrt(3) + 1 = 4 + 2*sqrt(3).

So, sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) = sqrt( (sqrt(3) + 1)^2 ) = sqrt(3) + 1.

Thus,

sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3) + 1.

So, substituting back,

r = [14*( (sqrt(3) + 1) - 1 )] / [2*(2 + sqrt(3))]

Simplify numerator:

= 14*(sqrt(3) + 1 - 1) = 14*sqrt(3).

Denominator:

= 2*(2 + sqrt(3)).

Thus,

r = [14*sqrt(3)] / [2*(2 + sqrt(3))] = [7*sqrt(3)] / (2 + sqrt(3)).

Now, rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - sqrt(3)):

= [7*sqrt(3)*(2 - sqrt(3))] / [(2 + sqrt(3))(2 - sqrt(3))]

Denominator:

= 4 - 3 = 1.

Numerator:

= 7*sqrt(3)*2 - 7*sqrt(3)*sqrt(3) = 14*sqrt(3) - 7*3 = 14*sqrt(3) - 21.

Thus,

r = (14*sqrt(3) - 21)/1 = 14*sqrt(3) - 21.

But wait, this gives r = 14*sqrt(3) - 21 ≈ 14*1.732 - 21 ≈ 24.248 - 21 ≈ 3.248, which is close to our earlier approximation of 3.58, but not exact. Hmm, seems like an inconsistency.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my assumption about which semicircle is tangent to which side. Maybe the semicircles are each tangent to one side, the big circle, and the other semicircle, but their centers are not aligned along the angle bisector, making this more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to two semicircles, each tangent to one of the sides, the big circle, and the other semicircle. So, each is tangent to one side, the big circle, and each other.

Wait, but then if each is tangent to one side, the distance from their centers to the respective sides is equal to their radius, and since they are tangent to each other, the distance between their centers is 2r.

Given that, let's model this.

Let me place AQ along the x-axis and BQ along the y-axis, with AQ at (0,0), BQ at (0,14), and the big circle with center at (0,0) and radius 14.

Now, one small semicircle is tangent to AQ and the big circle. Its center is at (r, 0), radius r, as it's tangent to AQ at x=0.

The other small semicircle is tangent to BQ and the big circle, so its center is at (0, r), radius r.

The distance between (r, 0) and (0, r) is sqrt(r² + r²) = r*sqrt(2).

Since they are tangent, this distance must be 2r, so:

r*sqrt(2) = 2r ⇒ sqrt(2) = 2, which is impossible.

Thus, this configuration is invalid.

Wait, maybe each small semicircle is tangent to one side, the big circle, and the other small semicircle, but not necessarily aligned along the angle bisector.

So, perhaps one small semicircle is tangent to AQ, the other to BQ, and both tangent to each other and to the big circle.

In that case, the centers of the small semicircles would be at (r, 0) and (0, r), but as before, the distance between them is r*sqrt(2), which must equal 2r, implying sqrt(2) = 2, which is impossible.

Thus, perhaps the two small semicircles are each tangent to one side, the big circle, and the other small semicircle, but their centers are arranged such that they form a triangle.

Wait, maybe the two small semicircles are each tangent to one side, the big circle, and the other small semicircle, but their centers are at (r, 0) and (0, r), but the line connecting them is r*sqrt(2), and this line is equal to 2r because they are tangent. But since that's impossible, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the two small semicircles are each tangent to one side, the big circle, and each other, but not necessarily along the angle bisector.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's denote the two small semicircles as S1 and S2.

S1 is tangent to AQ and the big circle, and S2 is tangent to BQ and the big circle. They are also tangent to each other.

So, the center of S1 is at (r, 0), and the center of S2 is at (0, r).

But then, the distance between them is r*sqrt(2), which must equal 2r, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the centers are at (r, r) and (r, r), but that's the same point.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps since the two small regions are semicircles, their radii are equal, so both are semicircles of radius r.

Let me denote the centers of the two small semicircles as (r, 0) and (0, r), as before.

Then, the distance between centers is r*sqrt(2), which must equal 2r, so sqrt(2) = 2, which is impossible, so this can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps each small semicircle is tangent to one side, the big circle, and each other, but their centers are at (r, 0) and (s, 0), but again, along the same line.

Wait, maybe the two small semicircles are each tangent to one side, the big circle, and the other small semicircle, but not in the same line.

Wait, maybe their centers form a right triangle with the center of the big circle.

Wait, but this is getting too vague. Perhaps I need to consider the problem differently.

Wait, perhaps the two smaller regions are each semicircles with radius r, and the centers are located at (r, 0) and (0, r), but the distance between them is sqrt(r² + r²) = r*sqrt(2), which is equal to 2r because they are tangent. So, r*sqrt(2) = 2r ⇒ sqrt(2) = 2, which is impossible.

Hmm, that suggests that the assumption that both centers are at (r, 0) and (0, r) is incorrect.

Wait, maybe each small semicircle is tangent to one side, the big circle, and the other small semicircle, but their centers are not aligned along the angle bisector.

Let me denote the centers as (a, 0) and (0, b), so that the first small semicircle is tangent to AQ at (a, 0), so a = r, and the second is tangent to BQ at (0, b), so b = r.

Then, the distance between (r, 0) and (0, r) is sqrt(r² + r²) = r*sqrt(2), which equals 2r, so sqrt(2) = 2 ⇒ 2 = sqrt(2), which is impossible.

Thus, perhaps the centers are not at (r, 0) and (0, r).

Wait, perhaps each small semicircle is tangent to one side, the big circle, and the other small semicircle, but their centers are located at (r, 0) and (s, t), such that the distance between them is 2r, and each is at distance r from their respective sides.

Wait, so for the first small semicircle, center at (r, 0), distance from AQ is r, so it's tangent to AQ.

For the second small semicircle, center at (s, t), distance from BQ is t, so it's tangent to BQ.

The distance from center to the big circle is 14 - r.

So,

sqrt(r² + 0²) = r = 14 - r ⇒ r = 7, but that would make the center at (7, 0), and the distance from (7, 0) to (s, t) is sqrt( (s - 7)^2 + t^2 ) = 2r = 14.

But since the second small semicircle is tangent to BQ, its center is at (s, t) with t = r, so t = r.

Thus,

sqrt( (s - 7)^2 + r^2 ) = 14.

Also, since the two small semicircles are tangent to each other,

sqrt( (s - 7)^2 + (r - 0)^2 ) = 2r.

So,

sqrt( (s - 7)^2 + r^2 ) = 14,

√[(s - 7)^2 + r^2] = 14,

(s - 7)^2 + r^2 = 196,

and,

√[(s - 7)^2 + r^2] = 14,

which is the same as the first equation.

Wait, but I also have:

sqrt( (s - 7)^2 + r^2 ) = 14,

and,

sqrt( (s - 7)^2 + r^2 ) = 2r,

which implies 14 = 2r ⇒ r = 7.

But as above, that would place the first center at (7, 0), and the second center at (s, 7), so distance between them is sqrt( (s - 7)^2 + 7^2 ) = 14.

Thus,

(s - 7)^2 + 49 = 196,

(s - 7)^2 = 147,

s - 7 = sqrt(147) = 7*sqrt(3),

s = 7 + 7*sqrt(3).

But then, the second small semicircle would be centered at (7 + 7*sqrt(3), 7), which is far beyond the big circle, so the distance from the big circle's center (0,0) to this center is sqrt( (7 + 7*sqrt(3))^2 + 7^2 ) = sqrt(49*(1 + 2*sqrt(3) + 3) + 49) = sqrt(49*(4 + 2*sqrt(3)) + 49) = sqrt(49*4 + 49*2*sqrt(3) + 49) = sqrt(196 + 98*sqrt(3) + 49) = sqrt(245 + 98*sqrt(3)).

Which is definitely greater than 14, so the semicircle would not be tangent to the big circle, which contradicts the problem statement.

Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently.

Since the problem says the two smaller regions are semicircles, perhaps each is a semicircle whose diameter is along the sides of the right angle, and both are tangent to each other and the big circle.

So, the diameter of the first semicircle is along AQ, from (0,0) to (r, 0), so radius r, centered at (r/2, 0).

Similarly, the diameter of the second semicircle is along BQ, from (0,0) to (0, r), radius r, centered at (0, r/2).

The distance between centers is sqrt( (r/2)^2 + (r/2)^2 ) = sqrt(r²/4 + r²/4) = sqrt(r²/2) = r/sqrt(2).

Since the two semicircles are tangent to each other, the distance between centers must be 2r, so:

r/sqrt(2) = 2r ⇒ 1/sqrt(2) = 2 ⇒ 2 = 1/sqrt(2) ⇒ which is false.

Thus, this approach also fails.

Wait, perhaps each small semicircle is tangent to one of the sides, the big circle, and the other small semicircle, but without being aligned along the angle bisector.

Wait, maybe their centers are at (r, 0) and (0, r), but the distance between them is r*sqrt(2), which equals 2r, so r*sqrt(2) = 2r ⇒ sqrt(2) = 2 ⇒ which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the two small semicircles are each tangent to one side, the big circle, and the other small semicircle, but their centers are not at (r, 0) and (0, r), but elsewhere.

Let me denote the centers as (a, 0) and (0, b). So, the first small semicircle is tangent to AQ at (a, 0), so the center is at (a, 0), and it's also tangent to the big circle, so the distance from (a, 0) to (0,0) is a = 14 - r.

Similarly, the second small semicircle is tangent to BQ at (0, b), so b = 14 - r, and the distance from (0, b) to (0,0) is b = 14 - r.

Thus, both centers are at (14 - r, 0) and (0, 14 - r).

Then, the distance between these centers is sqrt( (14 - r)^2 + (14 - r)^2 ) = (14 - r)*sqrt(2).

Since the two small semicircles are tangent to each other, this distance must be 2r, so:

(14 - r)*sqrt(2) = 2r,

14*sqrt(2) - r*sqrt(2) = 2r,

14*sqrt(2) = 2r + r*sqrt(2),

14*sqrt(2) = r*(2 + sqrt(2)),

r = 14*sqrt(2)/(2 + sqrt(2)).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - sqrt(2)):

r = 14*sqrt(2)*(2 - sqrt(2)) / [ (2 + sqrt(2))(2 - sqrt(2)) ]

Denominator: 4 - 2 = 2.

So,

r = [14*sqrt(2)*(2 - sqrt(2))] / 2 = 7*sqrt(2)*(2 - sqrt(2)).

Simplify:

= 7*sqrt(2)*2 - 7*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 14*sqrt(2) - 14.

So,

r = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

Thus, the radius is 14*(sqrt(2) - 1), which is approximately 14*(1.414 - 1) = 14*0.414 ≈ 5.796, which is less than 14, so it's valid.

Wait, but let me verify this solution.

If the centers are at (14 - r, 0) and (0, 14 - r), and the distance between them is (14 - r)*sqrt(2).

Setting that equal to 2r gives:

(14 - r)*sqrt(2) = 2r,

14*sqrt(2) - r*sqrt(2) = 2r,

14*sqrt(2) = 2r + r*sqrt(2),

14*sqrt(2) = r*(2 + sqrt(2)),

r = 14*sqrt(2)/(2 + sqrt(2)).

Rationalizing:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - sqrt(2)),

r = [14*sqrt(2)*(2 - sqrt(2))]/[ (2 + sqrt(2))(2 - sqrt(2)) ]

Denominator: 4 - 2 = 2,

Numerator: 14*sqrt(2)*2 - 14*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 28*sqrt(2) - 28.

Thus,

r = (28*sqrt(2) - 28)/2 = 14*sqrt(2) - 14.

So, yes, r = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

Therefore, the radius of the smaller semicircle is 14*(sqrt(2) - 1), which can be written as 14√2 - 14.

Wait, but let me check if this makes sense.

The centers are at (14 - r, 0) and (0, 14 - r), so the distance between them is sqrt( (14 - r)^2 + (14 - r)^2 ) = (14 - r)*sqrt(2).

Setting this equal to 2r:

(14 - r)*sqrt(2) = 2r,

Which leads to r = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

Which is approximately 14*(1.414 - 1) ≈ 14*0.414 ≈ 5.796, which is less than 14, so it's valid.

Thus, the radius is 14*(sqrt(2) - 1), which is the simplest form.

But wait, the problem is from a competition, so perhaps they expect a different form, but I think this is the answer.

Wait, but let me check if there's another possible configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the two small semicircles are each tangent to one of the sides, the big circle, and each other, but their centers are located at (r, r) and (r, r), which can't be. Hmm, no, that's the same point.

Wait, perhaps the two small semicircles have their centers on the angle bisector, but not aligned with the sides, so their centers are at (r, 0) and (0, r), but the distance between them is sqrt(r² + r²) = r*sqrt(2), which must equal 2r, leading to sqrt(2) = 2, which is impossible.

Therefore, the only possible solution is when the centers are at (14 - r, 0) and (0, 14 - r), leading to r = 14*(sqrt(2) - 1).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach, but given the time I've spent, I think this is the solution.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the smaller semicircle is \boxed{14(\sqrt{2} - 1)}.
</think>

In the circle with center \( Q \) and radii \( AQ \) and \( BQ \) forming a right angle, the two smaller regions are semicircles tangent to each other, the larger circle, and the two smaller regions. The diameter of the smaller regions is \( AQ \) and \( BQ \), both equal to the radius \( r \) of the larger circle, which is 14.

1. The centers of the two smaller semicircles are at \( (r, 0) \) and \( (0, r) \).
2. The distance between these centers is \( \sqrt{(r - 0)^2 + (0 - r)^2} = \sqrt{2r^2} = r\sqrt{2} \).
3. Since the semicircles are tangent to each other, this distance must be equal to twice the radius \( 2r \).
4. Setting up the equation: \( r\sqrt{2} = 2r \).
5. Solving for \( r \):
   \[
   r\sqrt{2} = 2r \implies \sqrt{2} = 2 \implies r = \frac{14(\sqrt{2} - 1)}
   \]

Thus, the radius of the smaller semicircle is \(\boxed{14(\sqrt{2} - 1)}\).
