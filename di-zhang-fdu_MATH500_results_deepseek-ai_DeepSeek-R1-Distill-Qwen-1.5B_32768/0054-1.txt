Question:
Two numbers, $x$ and $y$ are selected at random from the interval $(0,3)$.  What is the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ exists?

Correct Answer:
If a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ exists, the triangle inequality must be satisfied, which states that $x+y>1$, $1+x>y$, and $1+y>x$.  We can draw a plane with $x$ and $y$ axes and shade in the area where all of these inequalities are satisfied.

draw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3));
draw((0,0)--(0,3));
label("$x$",(3,0),S);
label("$y$",(0,3),W);
fill((1,0)--(3,2)--(3,3)--(2,3)--(0,1)--cycle,gray(.7));
draw((1,-.1)--(1,.1));
draw((2,-.1)--(2,.1));
draw((.1,1)--(-.1,1));
draw((.1,2)--(-.1,2));

draw((1,0)--(0,1));
draw((1,0)--(3,2));
draw((0,1)--(2,3));

[/asy]

The total area of the square is $3^2=9$.  The area of the unshaded region is $2^2+1/2=9/2$.  Thus, the shaded area is $9/2$ and the probability that such a triangle exists is $(9/2)/9=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Gold:
\frac{1}{2}

Wrong Prediction:
\frac{4}{9}

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I've got this problem here: Two numbers, x and y, are selected at random from the interval (0, 3). I need to find the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, x, and y exists. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First off, I remember that for three lengths to form a triangle, they have to satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. That theorem states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, for sides 1, x, and y, this means that:

1. 1 + x > y
2. 1 + y > x
3. x + y > 1

So, all three of these inequalities need to hold true for a triangle to exist with sides 1, x, and y.

Now, x and y are selected randomly from the interval (0, 3). I assume this means that x and y are each uniformly distributed over the interval (0, 3). Since theyâ€™re selected independently, the joint probability distribution is uniform over the square where 0 < x < 3 and 0 < y < 3.

So, the sample space is a square in the coordinate plane with vertices at (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3). The total area of this square is 9, which will be the denominator in my probability calculation.

My goal is to find the area of the region within this square where all three triangle inequalities are satisfied, and then divide that by 9 to get the probability.

Let me rewrite the triangle inequalities:

1. 1 + x > y
2. 1 + y > x
3. x + y > 1

Now, let's analyze each inequality one by one.

Starting with the third inequality, x + y > 1. Since x and y are both at least 0, this inequality will always hold true because the smallest x + y can be is 0, which is not greater than 1. So, this inequality doesn't impose any additional restrictions beyond what's given. Therefore, we can ignore this one for now.

Moving on to the first inequality: 1 + x > y. This can be rewritten as y < 1 + x. Similarly, the second inequality: 1 + y > x can be rewritten as x < 1 + y.

So, we have two inequalities:

- y < 1 + x
- x < 1 + y

These are essentially the reflections of each other across the line y = x in the coordinate plane. So, if I imagine the square (0,3)x(0,3), the lines y = x + 1 and y = x - 1 will form boundaries within the square.

Let me sketch this mentally. The line y = x is the diagonal from (0,0) to (3,3). The line y = x + 1 is a parallel line above it, and y = x - 1 is a line below it. These lines will intersect the square and divide it into regions.

Our goal is to find the area within the square where both y < 1 + x and x < 1 + y hold true. Essentially, this region is the area above both lines y = x + 1 and x = y + 1. Wait, no, actually, it's the area below both lines. Let me think.

No, actually, if we have y < 1 + x and x < 1 + y, these define a region that is the intersection of the areas below y = x + 1 and below x = y + 1. But since these two lines are symmetric with respect to y = x, the region they bound is a band around the diagonal.

But actually, let me clarify: for a given point (x, y), to satisfy both y < 1 + x and x < 1 + y, both inequalities must hold. Let me rearrange them:

From y < 1 + x, we get y - x < 1

From x < 1 + y, we get x - y < 1

So, both y - x and x - y are less than 1 in absolute value. That is, |y - x| < 1. That's another way to write it. So, the region where the difference between y and x is less than 1.

This is interesting because it's the area within the square where the two variables are within 1 unit of each other on the number line. So, when plotting this, it would look like a band around the line y = x, stretching from where y = x - 1 to y = x + 1, but clipped by the boundaries of the square.

So, the region we're interested in is the set of all (x, y) in the square where |x - y| < 1. But since x and y can each vary from 0 to 3, we need to figure out the exact area of this region.

Let me visualize this. The square is from (0,0) to (3,3). The lines y = x + 1 and y = x - 1 will intersect the square at different points.

First, let's find where y = x + 1 intersects the square.

When x = 0, y = 1
When y = 3, x = 2 (since 3 = x + 1 => x = 2)

Similarly, the line y = x - 1:

When x = 1, y = 0
When y = 3, x = 4 (which is outside the square, so this line only intersects the square at (1, 0) and (0, -1), but since y can't be negative, it intersects at (1, 0) and (0, -1) which is outside, so actually, the line only intersects the square at (0, -1), which is invalid, so the line y = x - 1 intersects the square at (1, 0) and (3, 2).

Wait, hold on: Let me compute the intersection points.

For y = x + 1:

- At x = 0, y = 1. So, point (0,1).
- At y = 3, x = 2 (since 3 = x + 1 => x = 2). So, point (2,3).
- So, the line connects (0,1) to (2,3).

For y = x - 1:

- At x = 1, y = 0. So, point (1,0).
- At x = 3, y = 2. So, point (3,2).
- So, the line connects (1,0) to (3,2).

So, these two lines, y = x + 1 and y = x - 1, intersect the square at (0,1), (2,3), (1,0), and (3,2). So, the region where |x - y| < 1 is the area between these two lines within the square.

Therefore, the area we want is the area of the square minus the areas of the two triangles that lie above and below these lines.

But wait, actually, in the square, the region |x - y| < 1 is the area between the two lines, which forms a band around the diagonal. So, the area can be calculated as the area of the square minus the areas of the two triangles that are outside this band.

So, let's compute the area of the two triangles.

First, the triangle above y = x + 1. This triangle has vertices at (0,1), (2,3), and (0,3). Wait, no, hold on. Wait, when y = x + 1 intersects the square at (0,1) and (2,3), so the area above this line is actually a triangle with vertices at (0,1), (2,3), and (0,3). Let's confirm that.

At x = 0, the line y = x + 1 is at (0,1), and the square has a vertical side at x=0 from (0,0) to (0,3). So, above the line y = x + 1 at x=0 is from (0,1) to (0,3). At x=2, the line is at (2,3). So, the region above the line y = x +1 is a triangle with vertices at (0,1), (2,3), and (0,3). That makes sense.

Similarly, the triangle below y = x -1. This triangle has vertices at (1,0), (3,2), and (3,0). Let me check that.

At x = 3, the line y = x -1 is at (3,2). The square has a horizontal line at y=0 from (1,0) to (3,0). So, below the line y =x -1 is a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (3,2), and (3,0). That's correct.

So, each of these triangles has a base and a height.

Let's compute the area of the upper triangle first.

Upper triangle: vertices at (0,1), (2,3), (0,3).

This is a right triangle with base along x=0 from (0,1) to (0,3), which is 2 units long, and height along y=3 from x=0 to x=2, which is 2 units as well. Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, actually, the base can be considered as the horizontal side from (0,1) to (0,3), which is 2 units, and the height is the horizontal distance from x=0 to x=2, which is 2 units. Wait, but that's the same as the base in a right triangle.

Wait, actually, no, the triangle is formed by the points (0,1), (2,3), (0,3). So, it's a right triangle with legs along the y-axis and along x=0. The length along the y-axis is from (0,1) to (0,3), which is 2 units. The length along the x-axis is from (0,3) to (2,3), which is 2 units. So, the triangle is a right triangle with legs of length 2 and 2, so the area is (1/2)*2*2 = 2.

Similarly, the lower triangle: vertices at (1,0), (3,2), (3,0).

This is also a right triangle. The base along y=0 from (1,0) to (3,0) is 2 units, and the height along y=2 from x=3 to x=1 is 2 units. So, the area is again (1/2)*2*2 = 2.

Therefore, the total area outside the band |x - y| < 1 is 2 + 2 = 4.

But wait, hold on a second. The square has an area of 9, and the area outside the band is 4? That can't be right because 4 is much smaller than 9, but let me double-check.

Wait, no, actually, the region |x - y| < 1 is the area between the two lines, so the area outside is the two triangles. So, area of the band is 9 - 4 = 5. Wait, 9 - 4 is 5? That seems correct.

Wait, but let me think again. If the square is 3x3=9, and the two triangles each have area 2, then 2+2=4, so the area between them is 9 - 4=5. Therefore, the area where |x - y| <1 is 5.

Wait, but that seems a bit small. Let me visualize again.

Wait, when I think of the two lines y = x +1 and y = x -1 in the square, the area between them is like a band around the diagonal. The width of the band is 1, since y can be at most 1 unit away from x.

So, the area should be a parallelogram or something. But in a square, it's a quadrilateral.

Wait, but in the square from (0,0) to (3,3), the area between y = x +1 and y = x -1 is actually a hexagon? Or is it a quadrilateral?

Wait, no, in the square, the lines y = x +1 and y = x -1 intersect the square at (0,1), (2,3), (3,2), and (1,0). So, connecting these points, the area between the two lines is a polygon with four sides: from (0,1) to (2,3), then from (2,3) to (3,2), then from (3,2) to (1,0), then from (1,0) back to (0,1). So, that's a four-sided figure.

Wait, let's see:

- From (0,1) to (2,3): that's the line y = x + 1
- From (2,3) to (3,2): that's part of the line y = x -1
- From (3,2) to (1,0): that's the line y = x -1
- From (1,0) back to (0,1): that's the line y = x +1

Wait, actually, that's two triangles and a quadrilateral? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the area by integrating or using geometric formulas.

Wait, maybe using coordinate geometry, I can compute the area between the two lines.

The area between y = x +1 and y = x -1 from x=0 to x=3 is the integral from x=0 to x=2 of (x +1) - (x -1) dx, and from x=2 to x=3, it's the integral from x=2 to x=3 of (x -1) - (x +1) dx.

Wait, let's see:

From x=0 to x=2, the upper boundary is y = x +1 and the lower boundary is y = x -1. So, the vertical distance between them is (x +1) - (x -1) = 2.

Therefore, the area from x=0 to x=2 is 2 * (2 - 0) = 4.

From x=2 to x=3, the upper boundary is y = x -1 and the lower boundary is y = x +1. Wait, but no, at x=2, y = x +1 is 3, and y = x -1 is 1. But at x=3, y = x +1 is 4, which is outside the square, and y = x -1 is 2.

So, from x=2 to x=3, the upper boundary is y = x -1 and the lower boundary is y = x +1, but since y cannot exceed 3, maybe?

Wait, actually, at x=3, y = x -1 is 2, which is less than 3, so the region between y = x -1 and y = x +1 is just from x=2 to x=3, but since y cannot exceed 3, the upper boundary is y=3.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust my approach.

Wait, perhaps the area between y = x +1 and y = x -1 is split into two parts:

1. A trapezoid from x=0 to x=2, where the vertical distance between the lines is 2, and the bases are at y=1 and y=3.

2. A triangle from x=2 to x=3, where the vertical distance between the lines is 2, but the upper boundary is at y=3.

Wait, let's calculate these areas.

First trapezoid: from x=0 to x=2.

At x=0, y = x +1 is 1, y = x -1 is -1 (outside the square). So, starting from x=0 to x=2, the lower boundary is y = x -1, but since y can't be negative, the lower boundary is y=0. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, actually, from x=0 to x=2, the line y = x -1 goes from y=-1 to y=1. But since y cannot be negative, the effective lower boundary is y=0. So, the vertical distance between y = x +1 and y = x -1 is (x +1) - 0 = x +1, because the lower boundary is y=0. Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, no, actually, if the lower boundary is y=0, and the upper boundary is y = x +1, then the vertical distance is (x +1) - 0 = x +1.

Similarly, from x=2 to x=3, the lower boundary is y = x -1, which is from y=1 to y=2, and the upper boundary is still y = x +1, but at x=3, y = x +1 is 4, which is outside the square. So, the upper boundary is y=3.

Therefore, the area from x=2 to x=3 is the integral from x=2 to x=3 of (3 - (x -1)) dx = integral from 2 to 3 of (4 - x) dx.

So, let's compute both areas.

First, from x=0 to x=2: vertical distance is (x +1) - 0 = x +1. So, the area is the integral from 0 to 2 of (x +1) dx.

Which is [ (1/2)x^2 + x ] from 0 to 2.

Calculating:

At x=2: (1/2)(4) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4

At x=0: 0 + 0 = 0

So, the area from 0 to 2 is 4.

Second, from x=2 to x=3: integral of (4 - x) dx.

The integral is 4x - (1/2)x^2 evaluated from 2 to 3.

At x=3: 12 - (9/2) = 12 - 4.5 = 7.5

At x=2: 8 - 2 = 6

So, the area from 2 to 3 is 7.5 - 6 = 1.5

Therefore, total area between the lines is 4 + 1.5 = 5.5.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought that the area outside the band is 4. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, actually, the area between the two lines is 5.5, which is 11/2, and the area outside is 4, so the total area within the square is 9, and 11/2 + 4 = 19/2 = 9.5, which is more than 9. That can't be.

Wait, that suggests that my calculation is wrong because the total area of the square is 9, but if the area between the lines is 5.5 and the area outside is 4, their sum is 9.5, which is more than 9. That's impossible because the square's area is only 9.

So, something is wrong with my calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the integrals.

Let me try another approach: using geometry.

The region between the lines y = x +1 and y = x -1 within the square.

From x=0 to x=2, the area between y = x +1 and y=0.

But wait, no, since y cannot be negative, the lower boundary is y=0.

Wait, no, if y = x -1 is negative, we have to adjust.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the area where both |x - y| <1.

Alternatively, let's consider the square [0,3]x[0,3].

The area where |x - y| <1 is the union of the regions below y = x +1 and above y = x -1.

Wait, in the square, this is the entire square except for the two triangles that lie above y = x +1 and below y = x -1.

But when we calculated the area above y = x +1, it was a triangle with area 2, and the area below y = x -1 was another triangle with area 2.

But 2 + 2 = 4, so the area between them is 9 - 4 = 5.

But earlier, when integrating, I got 5.5, which is conflicting.

Wait, so perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.

Wait, let me try to compute the area where |x - y| <1 using another method.

The area where |x - y| <1 is equal to the area of the square minus the areas of the two triangles.

Wait, so let's find the area above y = x +1 and below y = x -1.

The area above y = x +1 is a triangle with vertices at (0,1), (2,3), and (0,3). As calculated earlier, this has an area of 2.

Similarly, the area below y = x -1 is a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (3,2), and (3,0). This also has an area of 2.

So, the total area outside the band |x - y| <1 is 2 + 2 = 4.

Therefore, the area inside the band is 9 - 4 = 5.

But wait, when I did the integration earlier, I got 5.5. So, something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the integration.

Wait, from x=0 to x=2, the vertical distance between y = x +1 and y=0 is (x +1) - 0 = x +1.

So, the area is integral from 0 to 2 of (x +1) dx.

Which is [ (1/2)x^2 + x ] from 0 to 2.

At x=2: (1/2)(4) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4.

At x=0: 0 + 0 = 0.

So, area from 0 to 2 is 4.

From x=2 to x=3, the vertical distance between y = x -1 and y=3 is 3 - (x -1) = 4 - x.

So, integral from 2 to 3 of (4 - x) dx.

Which is [4x - (1/2)x^2] from 2 to 3.

At x=3: 12 - (9/2) = 12 - 4.5 = 7.5

At x=2: 8 - 2 = 6

So, the area is 7.5 - 6 = 1.5.

Therefore, total area between the lines is 4 + 1.5 = 5.5.

Wait, but according to the earlier method, it's 5, so which one is correct? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the integration, I considered the area above y = x +1 as a triangle, but actually, the region |x - y| <1 includes also the area below y = x -1, but in the integration, when I took the area between y = x +1 and y = x -1, I had to consider that y cannot be negative or exceed 3.

Wait, perhaps my initial thought was wrong. Maybe the area where |x - y| <1 is 5, but the integration is giving me 5.5, which suggests that perhaps the area is 5.5.

Wait, let me verify.

Wait, if I plot the lines y = x +1 and y = x -1 in the square, the region between them is a parallelogram with vertices at (0,1), (2,3), (3,2), and (1,0). So, that's a four-sided figure.

So, to compute the area of this parallelogram, I can use the shoelace formula.

The shoelace formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices is 1/2 |sum over i (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|.

So, let's list the vertices:

(0,1), (2,3), (3,2), (1,0), and back to (0,1).

Compute the sum:

(0*3 + 2*2 + 3*0 + 1*1) - (1*2 + 3*3 + 2*1 + 0*0)

Compute each part:

First part:
0*3 = 0
2*2 = 4
3*0 = 0
1*1 = 1
Total: 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 5

Second part:
1*2 = 2
3*3 = 9
2*1 = 2
0*0 = 0
Total: 2 + 9 + 2 + 0 = 13

So, the area is 1/2 |5 - 13| = 1/2 | -8 | = 4.

So, the area of the parallelogram is 4. That contradicts the previous calculation of 5.5.

Wait, so which one is correct? The shoelace formula gives 4, while the integration approach gave 5.5.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the region |x - y| <1 is not just the parallelogram, but also includes some triangles outside.

Wait, actually, no. The shoelace formula correctly calculates the area of the polygon formed by the intersection of |x - y| <1 and the square.

Wait, but if the shoelace formula gives 4, that must be correct because the area of the parallelogram is 4.

But why does integrating give me 5.5? Hmm, perhaps the integration approach is not considering the entire region.

Wait, perhaps the region |x - y| <1 is not just the parallelogram but also includes some areas beyond that.

Wait, no, if |x - y| <1, that's precisely the region between the two lines y = x +1 and y = x -1, which is a parallelogram.

But according to shoelace formula, it's 4. But when I did the integration, I thought it was 5.5.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the integration.

Wait, let me re-examine the integration.

So, region between y = x +1 and y = x -1.

From x=0 to x=2, the area is between y=0 and y=x +1.

So, integral from 0 to 2 of (x +1) dx = 4.

From x=2 to x=3, the area is between y=x -1 and y=3.

So, integral from 2 to 3 of (3 - (x -1)) dx = integral of (4 -x) dx.

Compute integral:

Integral of 4 dx is 4x, integral of -x dx is -(1/2)x^2.

So, evaluated from 2 to 3:

At x=3: 12 - (9/2) = 12 - 4.5 = 7.5

At x=2: 8 - 2 = 6

So, 7.5 -6 = 1.5.

So, total area is 4 +1.5=5.5.

But the shoelace formula gives 4. So, which one is correct?

Wait, wait, actually, in the square from x=0 to x=2, the area between y =x +1 and y=0 is indeed 4, but the area between y =x +1 and y=x -1 would be the area above y =x -1 and below y =x +1.

But in reality, in the square, above y =x -1 is from y=0 to y=x -1 and y=x +1 from y=1 to y=3.

Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that integrating from x=0 to x=2 is only the area where y =x +1 is above y=0, but the region |x - y| <1 includes also the area where y is below x -1 and above 0.

Wait, but y cannot be less than 0, so the region |x - y| <1 is split into two parts:

1. The area above y =x -1, which is from y =x -1 to y=1, but only when x -1 >=0, so x >=1.

Similarly, the area below y =x +1, which is from y=0 to y=x +1, which is always true since y >=0 and x +1 >=1.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to split the integral into different regions.

Wait, maybe I should split the integration at x=1.

From x=0 to x=1:

The region |x - y| <1 is y <x +1 and y >x -1.

But since y >=0 and y <=3.

For x from 0 to 1:

y must be between max(0, x -1) and min(3, x +1).

At x=0, y must be between 0 and1.

At x=1, y must be between 0 and2.

So, the area from x=0 to x=1 is the integral from 0 to1 of (x +1 -0) dx = integral of x +1 dx = [ (1/2)x^2 +x ] from 0 to1 = (1/2 +1) -0 = 3/2.

From x=1 to x=2:

y must be between x -1 and x +1.

At x=1, y is between 0 and2.

At x=2, y is between1 and3.

So, the area is integral from1 to2 of (x +1 - (x -1)) dx = integral of 2 dx = 2*(2 -1) = 2.

From x=2 to x=3:

y must be between x -1 and3.

At x=2, y is between1 and3.

At x=3, y is between2 and3.

So, the area is integral from2 to3 of (3 - (x -1)) dx = integral of (4 -x) dx.

Compute that as before: [4x - (1/2)x^2] from2 to3.

At x=3: 12 - 4.5=7.5

At x=2: 8 -2=6

So, the area is7.5 -6=1.5.

So, total area is 3/2 +2 +1.5= 3/2 +2=3.5 +1.5=5.

Ah! So, that matches the shoelace formula result of 4? Wait, no. Wait, no, 3/2 is 1.5, plus2 is3.5, plus1.5 is5.

So, the total area is5, which matches the shoelace formula.

Therefore, my initial mistake was that I considered the entire area from x=0 to x=2, but actually, the region |x - y| <1 is split into different parts, and the correct total area is5.

Therefore, the area where |x - y| <1 is5, so the area where |x - y| >=1 is4.

But wait, no. The total area of the square is9, so if the area where |x - y| <1 is5, then the area where |x - y| >=1 is4.

Wait, but that can't be, because the area where |x - y| >=1 is the area outside the band |x - y| <1, which is the region above y =x +1 and below y =x -1.

But when I calculated the area above y =x +1, I thought of it as a triangle with area2, and the area below y =x -1 as another triangle with area2, totaling4. But according to the integration, the area where |x - y| >=1 is4, so the area where |x - y| <1 is5.

Wait, but based on the shoelace formula, the area where |x - y| <1 is5, which is the region between the lines, and the area where |x - y| >=1 is4, which is the two triangles.

So, that makes sense because 5 +4=9.

Therefore, the area where |x - y| <1 is5, and the area where |x - y| >=1 is4.

But wait, the triangle area I calculated earlier was4, but according to the shoelace formula, the area of the parallelogram is4, but the integration gives us the area where |x - y| <1 as5.

Wait, no, hold on. The shoelace formula gives the area of the polygon where |x - y| <1, which is the parallelogram, which is4.

But in reality, the area where |x - y| <1 is the parallelogram, and the area where |x - y| >=1 is the two triangles, which are4.

Wait, but according to the integration, the area where |x - y| <1 is5, which is a contradiction. So, something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the shoelace formula. Let me recheck.

The points are (0,1), (2,3), (3,2), (1,0), and back to (0,1).

Compute shoelace:

Sum1: (0*3) + (2*2) + (3*0) + (1*1) = 0 +4 +0 +1=5

Sum2: (1*2) + (3*3) + (2*1) + (0*0)=2 +9 +2 +0=13

Area=1/2 |5 -13|=1/2*8=4.

Yes, shoelace formula gives4, which is the area of the parallelogram.

But in the integration, I thought the area where |x - y| <1 was5, but according to the shoelace formula, it's4. So, perhaps my initial thought was wrong.

Wait, maybe the area where |x - y| <1 is4, and the area where |x - y| >=1 is5.

But in that case, the triangle areas would be4 and5, but the shoelace formula says4 is the parallelogram.

Wait, perhaps I have the regions confused.

Wait, if |x - y| <1 is the area between the lines, which is the parallelogram, area4.

The area where |x - y| >=1 is the two triangles, area5.

So, that adds up to9, which is correct.

But earlier, when I thought the area where |x - y| <1 was5, that was incorrect. The correct area is4.

So, in the problem statement, the user asks for the probability that a triangle with sides1, x, and y exists. From earlier, that requires |x - y| <1.

Therefore, the area where |x - y| <1 is4, so the probability is4/9.

But wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, the area where |x - y| <1 is4, but in the square, which is9, so the probability is4/9.

But wait, in the shoelace formula, the area between the lines is4, so the area where |x - y| <1 is4, which is the region where the triangle exists.

Therefore, probability is4/9.

But wait, in the earlier integration, when I split the regions, I found the area where |x - y| <1 is5, but that must have been incorrect.

Wait, but according to the shoelace formula, it's4, so the area where |x - y| <1 is4, so probability is4/9.

But I'm confused because the area where |x - y| >=1 is5, which is the two triangles.

Wait, so if I have probability for |x - y| <1 is4/9, and for |x - y| >=1 is5/9, that's correct because4 +5=9.

Therefore, the probability that the triangle exists is4/9.

But wait, this seems counterintuitive because the area where |x - y| >=1 is5, which is larger than the area where |x - y| <1.

Wait, but geometrically, the region |x - y| <1 is a band around the diagonal, which is a large area, whereas the regions where |x - y| >=1 are two triangles, which are smaller.

So, the probability is higher for the triangle to exist when |x - y| is closer to1.

Therefore, the probability is4/9.

But wait, let me think again.

Wait, another way to compute the probability is to compute the area where |x - y| <1, which is4, so probability is4/9.

Alternatively, the area where |x - y| >=1 is5, so probability5/9.

Therefore, the probability that the triangle exists is4/9.

But wait, hold on, the problem is asking for the probability that a triangle exists with sides1, x, and y. So, the triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality, which is |x - y| <1.

Therefore, the area where |x - y| <1 is4, so the probability is4/9.

But wait, in the initial integration, I was confused because I thought the area where |x - y| <1 was5, but that was incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is4/9.

But now, I'm second-guessing because I initially thought the area where |x - y| <1 was5, but that's incorrect.

So, the probability is4/9.

Wait, but let me think about another way.

If I fix x and y, then for each x and y, the condition is |x - y| <1.

So, the probability is the area where |x - y| <1 in the unit square [0,3]x[0,3].

Which is, as calculated,4, so4/9.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, we can model this as a geometric probability problem.

But perhaps I should also think about the unit square approach, but scaled up.

But in this case, scaling doesn't matter because the area scales accordingly.

Wait, so, in conclusion, the area where |x - y| <1 is4, so probability is4/9.

But let me just verify once more.

Compute the area where |x - y| <1.

So, this is the region between the lines y =x +1 and y =x -1.

In the unit square, this is a band around the diagonal.

The area can be found by subtracting the areas of the two triangles from the total area.

Each triangle has an area of2, so total area to subtract is4.

Therefore, area between the lines is9 -4=5.

Wait, that contradicts the shoelace formula.

Wait, hold on, no, that's not correct.

Wait, if |x - y| <1 is the area between the lines, then since the total area is9, and the area outside the band is4, as calculated by the shoelace formula, then the area inside the band is5.

But that's conflicting with the triangle areas.

Wait, I think this is because when I subtracted the areas of the two triangles, which are4, from the total area9, I get5.

But according to the shoelace formula, the area between the lines is4.

Wait, but that can't be, because the shoelace formula is giving4 for the area where |x - y| <1, which is the parallelogram.

So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

The area where |x - y| <1 is the area between the two lines, which is the parallelogram with area4.

Thus, the area outside the parallelogram is5, which is the two triangles.

So, that makes sense because |x - y| <1 is a band around the diagonal, so the area is4, and the rest is5, the triangles.

Therefore, the probability is4/9.

Yes, that makes sense.

Therefore, the probability is4/9.

So, the final answer is4/9, which is approximately0.444.

Hence, the probability that a triangle with sides1, x, and y exists is4/9.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{4}{9}}.
</think>

To determine the probability that a triangle with sides 1, \(x\), and \(y\) exists, we need to satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. This translates to the conditions:

1. \(1 + x > y\)
2. \(1 + y > x\)
3. \(x + y > 1\)

These inequalities can be rewritten as:
1. \(y < 1 + x\)
2. \(y > 1 - x\)
3. \(y > x - 1\)

We need to find the area within the square \([0, 3] \times [0, 3]\) where these inequalities hold. This area is determined by the region where \(|x - y| < 1\).

The region \(|x - y| < 1\) forms a band around the diagonal of the square. This region is a parallelogram with vertices at \((0, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 2)\), and \((1, 0)\). The area of this parallelogram can be calculated using the shoelace formula, which gives an area of 4.

The total area of the square is 9. Therefore, the probability that a triangle with sides 1, \(x\), and \(y\) exists is the ratio of the area where \(|x - y| < 1\) to the total area of the square.

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area where } |x - y| < 1}{\text{Total area of the square}} = \frac{4}{9}
\]

Thus, the probability that a triangle with sides 1, \(x\), and \(y\) exists is \(\boxed{\dfrac{4}{9}}\).
