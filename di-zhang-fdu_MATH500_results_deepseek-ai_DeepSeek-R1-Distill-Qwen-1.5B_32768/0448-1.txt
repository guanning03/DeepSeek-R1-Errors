Question:
$\textbf{Juan's Old Stamping Grounds}$

Juan organizes the stamps in his collection by country and by the decade in which they were issued. The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each. (Brazil and Peru are South American countries and France and Spain are in Europe.) [asy]

[/asy] What was the average price, in cents, of his $70\text{'s}$ stamps? Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a cent.

Correct Answer:
The $\text{70's}$ stamps cost:

$\bullet$  Brazil, $12(\$ 0.06) = \$ 0.72;$

$\bullet$  Peru, $6(\$ 0.04) = \$ 0.24;$

$\bullet$  France, $12(\$ 0.06) = \$ 0.72;$

$\bullet$  Spain, $13(\$ 0.05) = \$ 0.65.$

The total is $\$2.33$ for the $43$ stamps and the average price is $\frac{\$ 2.33}{43} \approx \$0.054 = \boxed{5.4 \text{ cents}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem about Juan's stamp collection. It says he organizes the stamps by country and by the decade they were issued. The prices he paid were: Brazil and France are 6 cents each, Peru is 4 cents each, and Spain is 5 cents each. The stamps are organized by decade, which means grouped by their issuing years (like 50s, 60s, 70s, etc.). 

Looking at the Asymptote figure provided, it seems like there are three decades: 50s, 60s, and 70s. Each decade has their own group of stamps. The problem is specifically asking for the average price of his stamps from the 70s. 

First, I need to figure out how many stamps Juan has in the 70s. The Asymptote code shows that the 70s are labeled on the y-axis at position (13.5,4.5), with labels 12, 12, 6, and 13 at different y-coordinates. Wait, hold on, maybe that's not quite right. Let me parse the Asymptote code again.

The Asymptote code draws a grid from (0,0) to (18,5). It labels the decades at each x-coordinate:

- For the 50s: y=4.5, with labels 50s at (7.5,4.5), and each decade is separated by 6 units on the x-axis. So, the 50s are from x=0 to x=6, 60s from x=6 to x=12, 70s from x=12 to x=18. Wait, no, looking more carefully:

The code draws five lines at x=0,6,9,12,15,18, which are the decades: 0-6, 6-12, 12-18, which are 50s, 60s, and 70s respectively. Then, the labels for the decades are added on top of these. 

Looking at the labels:

- For the 50s: label("50s", (7.5,4.5)), which is at the center of the 50s bar, which spans from x=0 to x=6. The labels inside are 50s at (7.5,4.5), 4 at (7.5,3.5), 8 at (7.5,2.5), 6 at (7.5,1.5), and 3 at (7.5,0.5). So, the numbers inside the 50s bar are 4,8,6,3. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the 50s bar is labeled 50s in the label at (7.5,4.5). 

Wait, perhaps the numbers inside the decades are the counts of stamps for each country in that decade. Let me see: for the 50s, the labels are 4,8,6,3 corresponding to Brazil, France, Spain, and Peru? Or maybe it's the other way around. The code labels Brazil at (3,3.5), France at (3,2.5), Peru at (3,1.5), and Spain at (3,0.5). So, these are the four countries in order: Brazil, France, Peru, Spain. And the numbers inside are 6,7,4,12. Wait, hold on, the Asymptote code has:

- For the 50s, the labels are "50s" at (7.5,4.5). Then, each number is associated with a country: "6" at (7.5,3.5), "7" at (7.5,2.5), "4" at (7.5,1.5), and "3" at (7.5,0.5). So, the numbers inside the 50s bar are 6,7,4,3 corresponding to Brazil, France, Spain, and Peru? That doesn't quite make sense because the counts should be per country, but the numbers are in the order of Brazil, France, Spain, Peru. Wait, no, the labels are "Brazil and France" at (3,3.5), so Brazil is at the top, then France, then Spain, then Peru at the bottom? But the numbers are "6" at the top for Brazil, "7" for France, "4" for Spain, and "12" for Peru? Wait, no, the numbers are at different heights.

Wait, perhaps the numbers are stacked per country in the 50s decade, with Brazil at the top, France below, Spain below France, and Peru at the bottom. So, the numbers are 6,7,4,12? Wait, the 50s bar has labels:

label(scale(0.8)*"50s", (7.5,4.5));

Then, the numbers inside the bar are at (7.5,3.5)=6, (7.5,2.5)=7, (7.5,1.5)=4, (7.5,0.5)=12.

So, in the 50s decade, Brazil is the top at 6, France below at 7, Spain at 4, and Peru at 12. So, the counts for each country in the 50s are 6,7,4,12.

Wait, but looking at the prices, the problem says the prices he paid were Brazil and France at 6 cents each, Peru at 4 cents, and Spain at 5 cents. So, each stamp is priced at these amounts. But the number of stamps per country is given by the numbers in the decades. So, in the 50s, Brazil has 6 stamps, France has 7, Spain has 4, and Peru has 12.

Similarly, the 60s bar: label("60s", (10.5,4.5)). The numbers inside are "7", "4", "4", "9". So, the 60s decade has 7,4,4,9 stamps for Brazil, France, Spain, and Peru. Wait, let me confirm: the Asymptote code labels the 60s as "7", "4", "4", "9" at (10.5,3.5), (10.5,2.5), (10.5,1.5), (10.5,0.5). So, the numbers are 7,4,4,9. So, Brazil has 7, France has 4, Spain has 4, and Peru has 9.

Similarly, the 70s bar: label("70s", (13.5,4.5)). The numbers are "12", "12", "6", "13". So, in the 70s, Brazil has 12, France has 12, Spain has 6, and Peru has 13.

Wait, hold on, so for each decade, the numbers correspond to each country in the order: Brazil, France, Spain, Peru. So, in the 50s, Brazil had 6, France had 7, Spain had 4, Peru had 12. In the 60s, Brazil had 7, France had 4, Spain had 4, Peru had 9. In the 70s, Brazil had 12, France had 12, Spain had 6, Peru had 13.

Wait, but hold on, the Asymptote code labels the 50s as 50s with labels 50s, 4,8,6,3 in the respective positions. So, perhaps the numbers inside the 50s bar are in the order of Brazil, France, Spain, Peru: 6,7,4,3? Or is it 4,8,6,3? Wait, no, the numbers are at different heights. The code says:

label(scale(0.8)*"50s", (7.5,4.5));

Then labels:

label(scale(0.8)*"6", (7.5,3.5));

label(scale(0.8)*"7", (7.5,2.5));

label(scale(0.8)*"4", (7.5,1.5));

label(scale(0.8)*"3", (7.5,0.5));

So, the numbers inside the 50s bar are 6,7,4,3, from top to bottom. So, the top is Brazil with 6, then France with 7, Spain with 4, and Peru with 3.

Similarly, for the 60s bar:

label(scale(0.8)*"60s", (10.5,4.5));

Labels:

label(scale(0.8)*"7", (10.5,3.5));

label(scale(0.8)*"4", (10.5,2.5));

label(scale(0.8)*"4", (10.5,1.5));

label(scale(0.8)*"9", (10.5,0.5));

So, the 60s bar has numbers 7,4,4,9 from top to bottom: Brazil has 7, France has 4, Spain has 4, Peru has 9.

For the 70s bar:

label(scale(0.8)*"70s", (13.5,4.5));

Labels:

label(scale(0.8)*"12", (13.5,3.5));

label(scale(0.8)*"12", (13.5,2.5));

label(scale(0.8)*"6", (13.5,1.5));

label(scale(0.8)*"13", (13.5,0.5));

So, the 70s bar has numbers 12,12,6,13 from top to bottom: Brazil has 12, France has 12, Spain has 6, Peru has 13.

So, summarizing:

- 50s: Brazil=6, France=7, Spain=4, Peru=3
- 60s: Brazil=7, France=4, Spain=4, Peru=9
- 70s: Brazil=12, France=12, Spain=6, Peru=13

So, now, the problem is asking for the average price of his stamps from the 70s. So, we need to compute the average price of the 70s stamps.

First, we need to find the total number of 70s stamps. From the data above, Brazil has 12, France has 12, Spain has 6, and Peru has 13. So, total number of 70s stamps is 12 + 12 + 6 + 13.

Let me compute that:

12 + 12 = 24

24 + 6 = 30

30 + 13 = 43

So, total number of 70s stamps is 43.

Next, we need the total price of these stamps. Since each stamp is priced at 5 cents, the total price is 5 cents multiplied by the number of stamps. So, 5 cents * 43 stamps = 215 cents.

Wait, hold on. Wait, no, actually, the prices are given per stamp, and we're told the prices he paid were: Brazil and France at 6 cents each, Peru at 4 cents, and Spain at 5 cents. So, in the 70s decade, each of these countries' stamps have different prices. So, we can't just assume each stamp is 5 cents; we have to calculate the total price based on the number of stamps and their respective prices.

Wait, let me re-read the problem statement:

"Juan's Old Stamping Grounds: The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each."

So, the prices per stamp are: Brazil and France are 6 cents each, Peru is 4 cents each, and Spain is 5 cents each.

So, the 70s stamps consist of:

- Brazil: 12 stamps at 6 cents each
- France: 12 stamps at 6 cents each
- Spain: 6 stamps at 5 cents each
- Peru: 13 stamps at 4 cents each

Therefore, to find the total price, we need to calculate:

Total price = (Number of Brazil stamps * price of Brazil) + (Number of France stamps * price of France) + (Number of Spain stamps * price of Spain) + (Number of Peru stamps * price of Peru)

So, plugging in the numbers:

Total price = (12 * 6) + (12 * 6) + (6 * 5) + (13 * 4)

Let me compute each term:

12 * 6 = 72

12 * 6 = 72

6 * 5 = 30

13 * 4 = 52

Now, adding them up:

72 + 72 = 144

144 + 30 = 174

174 + 52 = 226

So, the total price for the 70s stamps is 226 cents.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says "the average price, in cents, of his 70s stamps." So, we need to compute the average price per stamp. Which is total price divided by total number of stamps.

But wait, actually, just to make sure: if we want the average price per stamp, it's total price divided by total number of stamps, which is 226 cents divided by 43 stamps. So, 226 / 43.

Let me compute that:

43 goes into 226 how many times? 43*5=215, 43*5=215, subtract that from 226: 226 - 215=11. So, 5 with a remainder of 11. So, 11/43 is approximately 0.2558.

So, total average price is approximately 5.2558 cents per stamp.

But wait, the problem says to round to the nearest tenth of a cent. So, 5.2558 cents. The tenths place is 2, the hundredths is 5, which is exactly 5 tenths, so we round up to 5.3 cents.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 43*5=215, 226-215=11, so 11/43= approx 0.2558. So, 5 + 0.2558=5.2558, which is 5.256 when rounded to three decimal places. But the question asks for the nearest tenth, so 5.3 cents.

But let me just check if I calculated the total price correctly.

Wait, each country's stamps:

- Brazil: 12 stamps * 6 cents = 72 cents

- France: 12 stamps * 6 cents = 72 cents

- Spain: 6 stamps * 5 cents = 30 cents

- Peru: 13 stamps * 4 cents = 52 cents

Adding these up: 72 + 72 = 144; 144 + 30 = 174; 174 + 52 = 226. So, total is 226 cents for 43 stamps.

So, 226 /43=5.2558... So, 5.2558... Rounded to the nearest tenth is 5.3 cents. Because 0.2558 is closer to 0.25 than to 0.30, but wait, actually, no, to the nearest tenth, you look at the hundredth place. The tenths place is 2, the hundredth is 5, so 5.2558 is approximately 5.3 when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Wait, but actually, 0.2558 is 0.256 when rounded to three decimal places. So, 5.256 is 5.3 when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Wait, is that right? Let me confirm:

The number is 5.2558.

The tenths place is 2, the hundredths is 5, which is equal to 5. So, when rounding to the nearest tenth, if the hundredths place is 5 or more, you round up the tenths place by 1.

So, 5.2558 rounds to 5.3.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of 5.2558 as approximately 5.26, which is still closer to 5.3 than to 5.2.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again:

"Juan's Old Stamping Grounds: The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each."

Wait, so the prices he paid were: Brazil and France at 6 cents each, meaning each of those stamps cost him 6 cents? Or is it that each of the countries together have 6 cents per stamp? Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the problem says: "the prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each."

So, it seems that per country, the price is as follows: Brazil is 6 cents, France is 6 cents, Peru is 4 cents, and Spain is 5 cents. So, the 70s decade has:

- Brazil: 12 stamps, each at 6 cents

- France: 12 stamps, each at 6 cents

- Spain: 6 stamps, each at 5 cents

- Peru: 13 stamps, each at 4 cents

So, that's how I interpreted earlier. So, the total price is the sum of each country's stamps multiplied by their respective prices. So, 12*6 +12*6 +6*5 +13*4=72+72+30+52=226.

Total stamps: 12+12+6+13=43. So, 226/43=5.2558... So, 5.2558 rounded to the nearest tenth is 5.3 cents.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the average price per stamp 5.3, or is it the total price?

Wait, no, the average price is total price divided by total number of stamps. So, 226 / 43=5.2558... So, 5.2558 is approximately 5.26 when rounded to two decimal places, which is 5.3 when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the average price per stamp, which is the same thing.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem and the prices are per stamp in each country, so the average price is the arithmetic mean of the prices of the stamps in the 70s decade. Wait, but that would be different.

Wait, the problem says: "What was the average price, in cents, of his 70\text{'s stamps? Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a cent."

So, it's asking for the average price per stamp in the 70s decade. So, average price is total price divided by total number of stamps, which is 226 cents /43 stamps=5.2558... cents per stamp. So, 5.2558... rounded to the nearest tenth is 5.3 cents.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the average price per country, but no, the problem says "average price of his 70s stamps," so it's the average per stamp.

Wait, but hold on, maybe I should think of it as the average of the prices of the stamps in the 70s decade, but that would be an average of 6,6,5,4. So, (6+6+5+4)/4=21/4=5.25. But that's only 5.25, which is 5.3 when rounded. Wait, so that's the same as the previous calculation. So, either way, it's 5.25, which is 5.3 when rounded to the nearest tenth.

So, both ways, I get 5.2558, which is 5.3 when rounded. So, that seems consistent.

But just to make sure, let's compute the average price per stamp.

Total price: 226 cents.

Total stamps: 43.

Average price: 226 /43.

Compute 226 divided by 43.

43*5=215, 226-215=11, so 5 + 11/43.

11 divided by 43 is approximately 0.2558.

So, 5.2558, which is 5.256 when rounded to three decimal places, but we need to round to the nearest tenth, which is one decimal place.

So, looking at the tenths place: 2, hundredths:5, thousandths:5.

So, when rounding to the nearest tenth, if the hundredths place is 5 or more, we round up the tenths place by 1. So, 5.2558 is approximately 5.3 when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Wait, but actually, 5.2558 is approximately 5.26 when rounded to two decimal places, but we need to round to the nearest tenth. So, 5.2558 is approximately 5.3 when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Wait, no, 5.2558 is 5.26 when rounded to two decimal places, but 5.2558 is closer to 5.3 than to 5.2 because the next digit is 5, which is the midpoint. So, 5.2558 is 5.256, which is 5.3 when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Wait, but in reality, 0.2558 is approximately 0.256, so it's 5.256, which is 5.3 when rounded to the nearest tenth. So, yes, 5.3.

Therefore, the average price of the 70s stamps is 5.3 cents.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me recast the problem.

Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the average price per country in the 70s decade, which would be the average of the prices of the four countries: (6 + 6 + 5 + 4)/4 = 21/4 = 5.25, which is 5.3 when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Wait, so that's consistent.

So, either way, 5.3 is the correct answer.

But, just to double-check, let me make sure I didn't miscalculate the total number of stamps or the total price.

Number of 70s stamps:

Brazil:12, France:12, Spain:6, Peru:13. Total=12+12=24, 24+6=30, 30+13=43. Correct.

Total price:

Brazil:12*6=72

France:12*6=72

Spain:6*5=30

Peru:13*4=52

Total price:72+72=144, 144+30=174, 174+52=226. Correct.

226/43=5.2558... Correct.

So, the average price is 5.2558... which is 5.3 when rounded to the nearest tenth. So, the answer is 5.3.

Therefore, I think 5.3 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5.3}
</think>

Juan's collection includes stamps from 50s, 60s, and 70s. The prices of the stamps are as follows: Brazil and France at 6 cents each, Peru at 4 cents each, and Spain at 5 cents each. The number of stamps from each country in the 70s is given by the Asymptote code.

From the Asymptote code, we determine the number of stamps from each country in the 70s:
- Brazil: 12 stamps
- France: 12 stamps
- Spain: 6 stamps
- Peru: 13 stamps

To find the average price of the 70s stamps, we first calculate the total price and the total number of stamps.

1. Calculate the total price:
   - Brazil: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 6 \text{ cents} = 72 \text{ cents}\)
   - France: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 6 \text{ cents} = 72 \text{ cents}\)
   - Spain: \(6 \text{ stamps} \times 5 \text{ cents} = 30 \text{ cents}\)
   - Peru: \(13 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ cents} = 52 \text{ cents}\)

   Adding these together:
   \[
   72 + 72 + 30 + 52 = 226 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of stamps:
   \[
   12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 \text{ stamps}
   \]

3. Calculate the average price per stamp:
   \[
   \frac{226 \text{ cents}}{43 \text{ stamps}} \approx 5.2558 \text{ cents}
   \]

Rounding 5.2558 to the nearest tenth gives 5.3.

Thus, the average price of the 70s stamps is \(\boxed{5.3}\).
