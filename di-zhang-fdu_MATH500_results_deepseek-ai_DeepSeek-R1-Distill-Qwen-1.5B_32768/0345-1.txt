Question:
In the circle with center $Q$, radii $AQ$ and $BQ$ form a right angle. The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, as shown. The radius of the circle with center $Q$ is 14 inches. What is the radius of the smaller semicircle? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Correct Answer:
Let $C$ and $D$ be the centers of the larger and smaller semicircles, respectively, and let $r$ be the radius of the smaller semicircle.  We have $QD=QB-DB=14-r$ and $QC=7$, so we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $QCD$ to obtain  \[
(14-r)^2+7^2=(7+r)^2.
\] After squaring both binomials and subtracting $7^2+r^2$ from both sides simplifies to $196-28r=14r$.  Adding $28r$ to both sides and dividing by 42, we find $r=\boxed{\frac{14}{3}}$ inches.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a circle with center Q, and radii AQ and BQ form a right angle. So, points A and B are on the circle, and the angle between them is 90 degrees. That means triangle ABQ is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at Q.

The circle has a radius of 14 inches, so AQ and BQ are both 14 inches. The two smaller regions mentioned are tangent semicircles, and I need to find the radius of the smaller semicircle. Hmm, the problem mentions "two smaller regions," which are tangent semicircles. So, I imagine there are two semicircles inside the main circle, each tangent to each other and tangent to the main circle.

Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. The main circle has center Q, and points A and B are on the circumference such that angle AQB is 90 degrees. So, AB must be the hypotenuse of the right triangle, which would be 14√2 inches because in a right-angled triangle with legs of 14 each, the hypotenuse is 14√2. But wait, is AB the diameter of the main circle? No, because the radius is 14, so the diameter is 28 inches. But AB is 14√2, which is approximately 19.796 inches, so it's shorter than the diameter. So, AB is a chord of the main circle, not the diameter.

Now, inside this main circle, there are two smaller semicircles that are tangent to each other and tangent to the main circle. I need to find the radius of the smaller semicircle. Let me denote the radius of the smaller semicircle as r. Since the regions are tangent semicircles, they must be tangent to each other and tangent to the main circle.

Let me think about how these semicircles are positioned. If AQ and BQ are radii forming a right angle, then points A and B are each 14 inches from Q. Now, the smaller semicircles must be tangent to AQ and BQ as well, I suppose. So, each smaller semicircle is tangent to two sides of the right angle at A and B.

Wait, but the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." So, maybe each smaller region is a semicircle whose diameter lies along AQ and BQ? Or maybe their arcs are tangent to AQ and BQ.

Wait, the problem says they are tangent semicircles. So, perhaps each is a semicircle whose diameter lies along AQ and BQ? Or maybe the arcs are tangent to AQ and BQ.

Wait, let me think again. If the regions are tangent semicircles, they are probably each with a diameter along AQ and BQ, but that might not fit because AQ and BQ are radii, not diameters.

Alternatively, maybe each semicircle is tangent to one of the radii and the main circle. So, each smaller semicircle touches the main circle and one of the radii AQ or BQ.

Let me try to formalize this. Let's denote the center of the smaller semicircle as point C. Since the semicircle is tangent to AQ, which is a radius, the distance from C to AQ must be equal to the radius r of the semicircle. Similarly, the distance from C to BQ must also be equal to r.

But wait, AQ and BQ are radii forming a right angle at Q. So, AQ and BQ are perpendicular. Therefore, the centers of the smaller semicircles must lie somewhere along the angle bisectors of the right angle at Q. Since the angle is 90 degrees, the bisector is at 45 degrees.

Wait, so if the smaller semicircles are tangent to both AQ and BQ, their centers must lie along the bisector of the right angle, which is the line y = x if we consider Q as the origin.

Let me set up a coordinate system with Q at (0, 0), AQ along the x-axis from (0, 0) to (14, 0), and BQ along the y-axis from (0, 0) to (0, 14). That seems reasonable.

So, the main circle is centered at (0, 0) with radius 14. The two smaller semicircles are tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle. Let me denote the center of the smaller semicircle as (r, r) because it's along the bisector at 45 degrees, so both coordinates are equal.

Wait, but is it a semicircle? If it's a semicircle, then it's either the top half or the bottom half of a circle centered at (r, r). But since it's inside the main circle, and tangent to AQ and BQ, which are along the axes, the semicircle must be in the corner near the origin, touching both axes and the main circle.

But actually, if the semicircle is in the corner, its center would be at (r, r), and the semicircle would be above or below the bisector. But since it's inside the main circle, and tangent to AQ and BQ, which are the x-axis and y-axis, the semicircle must be in the first quadrant, tangent to both axes and the main circle.

So, the center is at (r, r), and the semicircle has radius r. Therefore, the distance from the center (r, r) to the origin must be equal to 14 - r, since the main circle has radius 14, and the smaller semicircle is tangent to it.

Wait, is that correct? The distance from (r, r) to (0, 0) is sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = r*sqrt(2). Since the smaller semicircle is tangent to the main circle, the distance between their centers should be equal to the difference of their radii.

Wait, but the smaller semicircle is inside the main circle, so the distance between centers is 14 - r. So, we have:

sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = 14 - r

Simplify the left side: sqrt(2r^2) = r*sqrt(2)

Therefore:

r*sqrt(2) = 14 - r

Let me solve for r:

r*sqrt(2) + r = 14

Factor out r:

r (sqrt(2) + 1) = 14

Therefore:

r = 14 / (sqrt(2) + 1)

But we can rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(2) - 1):

r = [14 (sqrt(2) - 1)] / [(sqrt(2) + 1)(sqrt(2) - 1)] = [14 (sqrt(2) - 1)] / (2 - 1) = 14 (sqrt(2) - 1)

So, r = 14 (sqrt(2) - 1)

But wait, let me check if that makes sense. If r is 14 (sqrt(2) - 1), which is approximately 14*(1.414 - 1) = 14*(0.414) ≈ 5.796 inches.

Is that the radius of the smaller semicircle? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the smaller semicircle is not in the corner but in the middle. Maybe it's a semicircle that's tangent to both AQ and BQ but in the middle of the main circle.

Wait, the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." If they're tangent to each other and the main circle, perhaps each smaller semicircle is in the corner, but they are also tangent to each other.

Wait, so if there are two smaller semicircles, each in the corner, both tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, and also tangent to each other, then the distance between their centers should be equal to 2r.

Wait, but if they're both at (r, r) and (r, r), but in opposite directions? Wait, no, if they are in the same corner, their centers might be at (r, r) and (r, r), but then the distance between them would be zero, which is not possible.

Alternatively, maybe they are in opposite corners. But since AQ and BQ are in the first quadrant, the semicircles would be in the first quadrant, each touching AQ, BQ, and the main circle.

Wait, but if each is in the corner, their centers are at (r, r), but both in the first quadrant, but then they can't be both in the first quadrant because they would overlap. Hmm, maybe the centers are at (r, 0) and (0, r), but then the semicircles would be along AQ and BQ respectively.

Wait, but the problem says the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles. So, maybe each is a semicircle with diameter along AQ and BQ, but that seems different.

Wait, no, if the semicircles are tangent to AQ and BQ, then their diameters would be along AQ and BQ, but since AQ and BQ are radii, not diameters, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the semicircles are tangent to the main circle and to the other semicircle.

Wait, so we have two semicircles inside the main circle, each tangent to the main circle and tangent to each other, and also tangent to one of the radii AQ and BQ.

So, each semicircle is in the corner, tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, and also tangent to the other semicircle.

So, each smaller semicircle is tangent to two sides of the right angle (AQ and BQ) and the main circle, and also tangent to the other smaller semicircle.

In that case, the centers of the smaller semicircles would be at (r, r), and the distance between their centers should be 2r, because they are tangent.

Wait, but the distance between (r, r) and (r, r) is zero, which is not possible.

Wait, maybe the centers are at (r, 0) and (0, r), but then each semicircle would be tangent to AQ and BQ, but that might not make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the centers are not both (r, r), but one is (r, r) and the other is (r, r) but in different quadrants? Wait, but in our coordinate system, AQ is along the x-axis, and BQ is along the y-axis, so both semicircles would be in the first quadrant.

Wait, perhaps each semicircle is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, and also tangent to each other. So, the first semicircle is in the corner between AQ and the main circle, and the second is in the corner between BQ and the main circle, and they are tangent to each other.

So, in that case, the centers of both semicircles would be at (r, 0) and (0, r), and the distance between them is sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = r*sqrt(2). Since they are tangent to each other, this distance should be equal to 2r, because each has radius r.

So, r*sqrt(2) = 2r => sqrt(2) = 2, which is not true. Therefore, that can't be.

Hmm, that suggests that maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe each smaller semicircle is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, but not necessarily both in the same corner.

Wait, perhaps each smaller semicircle is in the corner but also tangent to the other semicircle. So, if one is at (r, r) and the other is also at (r, r), but then they overlap.

Wait, maybe I need to reconsider.

Let me think of the two smaller semicircles as each tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, and also tangent to each other.

So, each semicircle is in the corner, tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, and also tangent to the other semicircle.

If each semicircle is tangent to AQ and BQ, which are the axes, and the main circle, their centers must lie along the angle bisector, which is the line y = x.

But if the centers are along y = x, then each center is at (r, r). But if they are tangent to each other, the distance between their centers should be 2r.

Wait, but the distance between (r, r) and (r, r) is zero. That doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I need to place the centers at (r, 0) and (0, r), but then each is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, but also tangent to the other semicircle.

Wait, no, if one is at (r, 0) and the other at (0, r), then each is tangent to AQ and BQ respectively, but not necessarily to the main circle.

Wait, but the problem says the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, which probably means that each is tangent to the main circle.

Wait, maybe each smaller semicircle is tangent to the main circle and to each other, and also tangent to one of the radii AQ or BQ.

Wait, let's consider one of them, say the one tangent to AQ and the main circle. Let me denote its center as (r, 0). Then, the distance from (r, 0) to the origin is r, but the main circle has radius 14, so the distance from (r, 0) to the center of the main circle is r, but the main circle has radius 14, so the distance from (r, 0) to the main circle's center should be 14 - r.

Wait, but the distance from (r, 0) to (0, 0) is r, which is less than 14, so the main circle passes through (r, 0). But if (r, 0) is inside the main circle, then the semicircle centered at (r, 0) with radius r cannot be tangent to the main circle.

Wait, perhaps the semicircle is in the other direction. Maybe the center is at (r, 0) and the semicircle is above the x-axis, so it's a semicircle that is in the lower half-plane.

Wait, but if it's tangent to the main circle, which is centered at (0, 0) with radius 14, the distance from (r, 0) to (0, 0) is r, so for the semicircle to be tangent to the main circle, the distance between centers should be equal to 14 - r.

Wait, but the distance between (r, 0) and (0, 0) is r, so 14 - r = r => 14 = 2r => r = 7. But the radius would be 7, which is larger than the main circle's radius, which is impossible because it can't be tangent. So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the semicircle is in the opposite direction. If the center is at (r, 0), but the semicircle is the lower semicircle, then the distance from (r, 0) to the main circle is 14 - r, but the distance is only r, so that doesn't help.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach.

Let me denote the radius of the smaller semicircle as r. Then, since it's tangent to AQ and BQ, which are the x-axis and y-axis, the distance from the center to each axis must be equal to r, so the center of the smaller semicircle is at (r, r). Now, the smaller semicircle is also tangent to the main circle, so the distance between the centers (0, 0) and (r, r) must be equal to 14 - r.

Therefore, sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = 14 - r

Which simplifies to sqrt(2r^2) = 14 - r

So, r*sqrt(2) = 14 - r

Then, bring all terms to one side:

r*sqrt(2) + r = 14

Factor out r:

r (sqrt(2) + 1) = 14

Therefore,

r = 14 / (sqrt(2) + 1)

Which is approximately 14 / 2.414 ≈ 5.796 inches.

But the problem says the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles. So, is this one of them? Or are there two?

Wait, if I have only one smaller semicircle in the corner, but the problem mentions two smaller regions. So, perhaps there is another semicircle in the other corner, but then their centers would be at (r, r), and if they are both tangent to the main circle, their distance apart would be zero, which is not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the two smaller semicircles are tangent to each other and the main circle, but each is in a different corner. But then, how would they be tangent to each other? If their centers are both at (r, r), they can't be tangent unless they are the same point.

Wait, maybe each smaller semicircle is in a different corner but also tangent to the main circle. So, each is in their respective corner, and the two smaller semicircles are also tangent to each other. So, their centers are each at (r, r), but with different radii. Wait, but they would have the same radius if they are both tangent to AQ and BQ.

Wait, if each smaller semicircle is tangent to AQ and BQ, but with different radii, that might not make sense because they would both have to be tangent to both radii, so they'd have the same radius.

Wait, maybe the two smaller semicircles are each tangent to one radius and the main circle, and they're also tangent to each other. So, one is tangent to AQ and the main circle, and the other is tangent to BQ and the main circle, and they're also tangent to each other.

In that case, the centers would be at (r1, 0) and (0, r2), each with radius r1 and r2, respectively. Since they are tangent to each other, the distance between their centers is r1 + r2. Also, each is tangent to the main circle, so the distance from (r1, 0) to (0,0) is r1 = 14 - r1', where r1' is the radius of the main circle, which is 14. So, 14 = r1 + r1' => 14 = r1 + 14, which would imply r1 = 0, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the distance from (r1, 0) to (0, 0) is r1, and this must be equal to 14 - r1, because the smaller semicircle is inside the main circle and tangent to it. So, r1 = 14 - r1, which would mean 2r1 = 14, so r1 = 7. But 7 is larger than the main circle's radius, which is impossible.

Wait, so that approach doesn't work. Maybe the semicircles are not tangent to the main circle, but only to AQ and BQ.

Wait, the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles." So, maybe each is tangent to the main circle and to each other, and also tangent to one of the radii AQ or BQ.

So, each smaller semicircle is tangent to AQ or BQ, the main circle, and the other smaller semicircle.

So, let's denote one smaller semicircle as being tangent to AQ, the main circle, and the other semicircle. Similarly, the other smaller semicircle is tangent to BQ, the main circle, and the first semicircle.

So, each has radius r, and the distance from their centers to the main circle's center is 14 - r.

So, let's denote the center of the first smaller semicircle as (r, 0), and the center of the second as (0, r). The distance between (r, 0) and (0, r) is sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = r*sqrt(2). Since the two smaller semicircles are tangent to each other, this distance must equal 2r.

Therefore,

r*sqrt(2) = 2r

Divide both sides by r (assuming r ≠ 0):

sqrt(2) = 2

But sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, which is not equal to 2. So, this is a contradiction.

Hmm, that suggests that my assumption about the centers being at (r, 0) and (0, r) is wrong. Maybe the centers are not on the axes but somewhere else.

Wait, but if the smaller semicircles are tangent to AQ and BQ, which are the x-axis and y-axis, then their centers must be at (r, 0) and (0, r). But then, as we saw, they can't be tangent to each other.

Alternatively, maybe the smaller semicircles are tangent to AQ and the main circle, and also tangent to each other. So, each has radius r, center at (r, 0), and the distance from (r, 0) to the main circle's center (0, 0) is 14 - r.

So, sqrt(r^2 + 0^2) = 14 - r, which gives r = 14 - r, so r = 7.

But as before, that would place the center at (7, 0), which is 7 units from the origin, and the main circle's radius is 14, so the main circle would pass through (7, 0). But the smaller semicircle is inside the main circle, so the distance from (7, 0) to the main circle's center is 7, which is equal to 14 - 7 = 7, so that works.

But if the semicircle is centered at (7, 0) with radius 7, then it would go from (0, 0) to (14, 0), which is along the x-axis. But it's supposed to be a semicircle, so it's either the upper or lower half. Since it's tangent to the main circle, it must be the lower half. So, the semicircle would be the lower half of the circle centered at (7, 0) with radius 7, which would extend from (0, 0) to (14, 0), curving downward.

But then, how does this semicircle relate to the other smaller semicircle? If we have two such semicircles, one at (7, 0) and one at (0, 7), each with radius 7, but they are both on the x-axis and y-axis respectively, so they can't be tangent to each other.

Alternatively, maybe the two smaller semicircles are both tangent to the main circle and each other, but each is also tangent to one of the radii AQ or BQ.

Wait, let me think of the two smaller semicircles as each tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, and also tangent to each other.

So, each smaller semicircle is tangent to two sides of the right angle and the main circle, and also tangent to the other smaller semicircle.

So, for each smaller semicircle, the center is at (r, r), and the distance from (r, r) to the main circle's center (0, 0) is 14 - r.

So, sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = 14 - r => r*sqrt(2) = 14 - r => r(sqrt(2) + 1) = 14 => r = 14 / (sqrt(2) + 1).

But as before, that gives r ≈ 5.796 inches. However, if we have two such semicircles, each at (r, r) and (r, r), which is the same point, that doesn't make sense because they can't be tangent to each other.

Wait, maybe each smaller semicircle is in a different corner but still tangent to the main circle and each other.

Wait, if they are each tangent to the main circle and to each other, their centers are separated by 2r, as we thought before.

So, if each center is at (r, 0) and (0, r), then the distance between them is r*sqrt(2). So, if they are tangent, r*sqrt(2) = 2r => sqrt(2) = 2, which is not true.

So, that suggests that the semicircles cannot be tangent to each other if they are both tangent to the main circle and AQ, BQ.

Wait, maybe the smaller semicircles are not in the corner but in some other positions.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the two smaller semicircles as each lying in the angle between AQ and the main circle, and similarly for BQ.

Wait, perhaps the two smaller semicircles are each tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, but their centers are not on the angle bisector.

Wait, but if they are tangent to AQ and BQ, their centers must lie on the bisector of the right angle, which is the line y = x.

So, their centers are at (r, r). Now, the distance from (r, r) to the main circle's center (0, 0) is sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = r*sqrt(2). Since the main circle has radius 14, the distance from (r, r) to (0, 0) must be equal to 14 - r because the smaller semicircle is inside the main circle.

So, r*sqrt(2) = 14 - r => r (sqrt(2) + 1) = 14 => r = 14 / (sqrt(2) + 1). Rationalizing the denominator:

r = [14 (sqrt(2) - 1)] / [ (sqrt(2) + 1)(sqrt(2) - 1) ] = [14 (sqrt(2) - 1)] / (2 - 1) = 14 (sqrt(2) - 1) inches.

So, that's approximately 14*(0.414) ≈ 5.796 inches.

But then, how do we get two smaller regions? If each smaller semicircle is in the corner, tangent to AQ, BQ, and the main circle, and all three are tangent to each other, but their centers are all at (r, r), which is the same point, so they can't be tangent.

Wait, maybe the two smaller semicircles are each tangent to the main circle and each other, but not tangent to AQ and BQ. But the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles," and they form a right angle, so they probably are tangent to AQ and BQ.

Alternatively, maybe the two smaller semicircles are each tangent to the main circle and to each other, and also tangent to one of the radii AQ or BQ.

Wait, let's try this. Let me denote one semicircle as being tangent to AQ, the main circle, and the other semicircle. The other semicircle is tangent to BQ, the main circle, and the first semicircle.

So, each has radius r, and the centers are at (r, 0) and (0, r), respectively. The distance between the centers is sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = r*sqrt(2). Since the two smaller semicircles are tangent to each other, this distance must equal 2r.

Therefore,

r*sqrt(2) = 2r => sqrt(2) = 2, which is not true.

This suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe the centers are not at (r, 0) and (0, r), but shifted.

Wait, perhaps the centers are not along the axes but somewhere else.

Wait, maybe the smaller semicircles are not in the corners but on the sides.

Wait, but the problem says they form a right angle, so they must be in the corners.

Wait, maybe the distance between centers is 2r, and each center is at (r, 0) and (0, r). Then, their distance is r*sqrt(2) = 2r => sqrt(2) = 2, which is impossible.

Hmm, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the smaller semicircles as each tangent to the main circle and to one of the radii, but not necessarily to each other.

Wait, the problem says there are two smaller regions that are tangent semicircles, so maybe each is a semicircle that is tangent to the main circle and to one of the radii, but not the other.

So, for example, one smaller semicircle is tangent to AQ and the main circle, and the other is tangent to BQ and the main circle, and these two smaller semicircles are also tangent to each other.

In that case, each smaller semicircle has radius r, and their centers are at (r, 0) and (0, r), respectively. The distance between centers is r*sqrt(2). Since they are tangent, this distance must be equal to 2r, so:

r*sqrt(2) = 2r => sqrt(2) = 2 => which is not true.

Hmm, so that approach doesn't work.

Wait, maybe the smaller semicircles are each tangent to the main circle, and each is tangent to one of the radii, but not each other.

In that case, each smaller semicircle is tangent to AQ or BQ and the main circle, but not to each other.

So, each has radius r, and the center is at (r, 0) or (0, r). The distance from (r, 0) to (0, 0) is r, which should be equal to 14 - r, because the smaller semicircle is inside the main circle.

Therefore, r = 14 - r => r = 7. But 7 is larger than the main circle's radius, which is impossible.

Alternatively, if the smaller semicircle is tangent to AQ and the main circle, then the distance from (r, 0) to (0, 0) is 14 - r, so sqrt(r^2 + 0^2) = 14 - r => r = 14 - r => 2r = 14 => r = 7. Again, impossible.

So, that approach also doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps the smaller semicircles are not tangent to the main circle, but to each other and to AQ and BQ. So, each smaller semicircle is tangent to AQ, BQ, and the other smaller semicircle, but not necessarily to the main circle.

In that case, each smaller semicircle has radius r, and their centers are at (r, 0) and (0, r). The distance between centers is r*sqrt(2). Since they are tangent to each other, this distance must be equal to 2r, so:

r*sqrt(2) = 2r => sqrt(2) = 2 => which is impossible.

Wait, so that doesn't work either.

This is getting confusing. Maybe I need to approach it differently.

Let me consider one smaller semicircle first. Let me denote its radius as r, and its center at (r, 0). It is tangent to AQ (the x-axis) and the main circle. The distance from (r, 0) to (0, 0) is r, which must be equal to 14 - r, so r = 7, which is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the smaller semicircle is tangent to AQ, the main circle, and the other smaller semicircle.

Wait, if it's tangent to AQ, then the distance from center to AQ is r, so the center is at (r, 0). Similarly, if it's tangent to the other smaller semicircle, which is also tangent to AQ, then the center is at (r, 0). But since both smaller semicircles are tangent to each other and to AQ, their centers can't be different. Wait, maybe not both.

Wait, perhaps each smaller semicircle is tangent to AQ or BQ, the main circle, and the other smaller semicircle.

So, one is tangent to AQ and the main circle, and the other is tangent to BQ and the main circle, and both are tangent to each other.

So, the centers are at (r, 0) and (0, r). The distance between them is r*sqrt(2). Since they're tangent, that distance must equal 2r, so:

r*sqrt(2) = 2r => sqrt(2) = 2 => which is not true.

Hmm, again, the same problem.

Wait, maybe the smaller semicircles are each tangent to the main circle and to one of the radii, and each is also tangent to each other.

So, one is tangent to AQ and the main circle, and the other is tangent to BQ and the main circle, and both are tangent to each other.

So, as before, each center is at (r, 0) and (0, r), and the distance between centers is r*sqrt(2). Since they're tangent, this distance must be 2r, so sqrt(2) = 2, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe the smaller semicircles are each tangent to the main circle and to the other smaller semicircle, but not to AQ or BQ. So, each has radius r, the centers are at (a, 0) and (0, a), and the distance between them is sqrt(a^2 + a^2) = a*sqrt(2). Since they are tangent, this distance must be 2r, so a*sqrt(2) = 2r.

Additionally, each smaller semicircle is tangent to the main circle, so the distance from (a, 0) to (0, 0) is a, which must equal 14 - r. Similarly, from (0, a) to (0, 0) is a, which equals 14 - r. So, a = 14 - r.

So, from the distance between centers:

a*sqrt(2) = 2r

But a = 14 - r, so:

(14 - r)*sqrt(2) = 2r

Let me expand this:

14*sqrt(2) - r*sqrt(2) = 2r

Bring all terms to one side:

14*sqrt(2) = 2r + r*sqrt(2)

Factor out r:

14*sqrt(2) = r(2 + sqrt(2))

Therefore,

r = [14*sqrt(2)] / (2 + sqrt(2))

To rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - sqrt(2)):

r = [14*sqrt(2)*(2 - sqrt(2))] / [(2 + sqrt(2))(2 - sqrt(2))] = [14*sqrt(2)*(2 - sqrt(2))] / (4 - 2) = [14*sqrt(2)*(2 - sqrt(2))]/2

Simplify:

r = 7*sqrt(2)*(2 - sqrt(2)) = 7*(2*sqrt(2) - 2) = 14*sqrt(2) - 14

But that would be approximately 14*1.414 - 14 ≈ 19.8 - 14 = 5.8, which is positive, but let's check:

Wait, 14*sqrt(2) ≈ 19.798, so 19.798 - 14 ≈ 5.798 inches, which matches our earlier calculation.

But is this the radius of the smaller semicircle?

Wait, but in this setup, each smaller semicircle is tangent to the main circle and the other smaller semicircle, but not to AQ or BQ. So, maybe each smaller semicircle is in the corner, tangent to AQ or BQ, the main circle, and the other smaller semicircle.

But in that case, the radius would be 14*sqrt(2) - 14, which is approximately 5.796 inches.

But let me see if this makes sense. If each smaller semicircle has radius approximately 5.796 inches, their centers are at (a, 0) and (0, a), where a = 14 - r ≈ 14 - 5.796 ≈ 8.204 inches.

But then, the distance between centers is a*sqrt(2) ≈ 8.204*1.414 ≈ 11.632 inches. The sum of the radii is r + r ≈ 11.592 inches, which is approximately equal but not exactly. The small discrepancy is due to rounding.

But if we use exact values, let's compute:

a = 14 - r = 14 - (14*sqrt(2) - 14) = 14 - 14*sqrt(2) + 14 = 28 - 14*sqrt(2)

Then, a*sqrt(2) = (28 - 14*sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) = 28*sqrt(2) - 14*(sqrt(2))^2 = 28*sqrt(2) - 14*2 = 28*sqrt(2) - 28 = 28(sqrt(2) - 1)

But the sum of radii is r + r = 2r = 2*(14*sqrt(2) - 14) = 28*sqrt(2) - 28

So, the distance between centers is equal to the sum of radii, meaning the smaller semicircles are externally tangent. So, that makes sense.

Therefore, the radius of the smaller semicircle is 14*sqrt(2) - 14 inches.

But we can factor this:

14*(sqrt(2) - 1) inches.

So, the radius is 14*(sqrt(2) - 1). Since the problem asks for the radius expressed as a common fraction, but 14 is 14, which is an integer, so it's already a common fraction.

Wait, but let me check if that makes sense.

Wait, 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) is approximately 14*(1.414 - 1) = 14*0.414 ≈ 5.796 inches, which is consistent with our earlier result.

Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.

So, the radius of the smaller semicircle is 14*(sqrt(2) - 1) inches.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the smaller semicircle is \boxed{14(\sqrt{2} - 1)} inches.
</think>

Given a circle with center \( Q \), radii \( AQ \) and \( BQ \) form a right angle, and the radius of the circle is 14 inches. The two smaller regions formed by these radii are tangent semicircles, and we need to find the radius of the smaller semicircle.

1. The main circle has a radius of 14 inches.
2. The smaller semicircles are tangent to each other, the main circle, and one of the radii \( AQ \) or \( BQ \).
3. The centers of the smaller semicircles are along the angle bisector (line \( y = x \)).
4. Let the radius of the smaller semicircle be \( r \). The distance from the center of the smaller semicircle to the origin (center \( Q \)) is \( 14 - r \).
5. The distance from the center of the smaller semicircle to the origin is also \( \sqrt{r^2 + r^2} = r\sqrt{2} \).
6. Setting these distances equal gives \( r\sqrt{2} = 14 - r \).
7. Solving for \( r \):
   \[
   r\sqrt{2} + r = 14
   \]
   \[
   r(\sqrt{2} + 1) = 14
   \]
   \[
   r = \frac{14}{\sqrt{2} + 1}
   \]
8. Rationalizing the denominator:
   \[
   r = \frac{14(\sqrt{2} - 1)}{(\sqrt{2} + 1)(\sqrt{2} - 1)} = \frac{14(\sqrt{2} - 1)}{1} = 14(\sqrt{2} - 1)
   \]

Thus, the radius of the smaller semicircle is \(\boxed{14(\sqrt{2} - 1)}\) inches.
