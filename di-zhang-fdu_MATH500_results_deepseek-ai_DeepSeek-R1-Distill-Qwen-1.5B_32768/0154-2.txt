Correct Answer:
The measure of each interior angle in a regular $n$-gon is $180(n-2)/n$ degrees.  Therefore, the measure of angle $\angle BAD$ is $180(7-2)/7=\frac{900}7$ degrees and the measure of angle $CAD$ is 90 degrees.  Their difference, $\angle BAC$, measures  \[\frac{900}7-\frac{630}7=\boxed{\frac{270}7\text{ degrees}}.\]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where a square and a regular heptagon are coplanar and share a common side AD. I need to find the degree measure of angle BAC. Hmm, let me try to visualize this. The Asymptote code draws a heptagon and a square sharing side AD. So, both shapes have a side AD in common. 

First, let me recall what a regular heptagon is. A regular heptagon has seven equal sides and seven equal angles. Each interior angle of a regular heptagon can be calculated using the formula for interior angles of regular polygons: \((n-2) \times 180^\circ / n\), where n is the number of sides. So, for a heptagon, that would be \((7-2) \times 180^\circ / 7 = 5 \times 180^\circ / 7 = 900^\circ / 7 ≈ 128.57^\circ\). But I'm not sure if I need the interior angle directly; maybe it's more useful the central angles or something else.

Similarly, a square has four sides, each at 90 degrees. So, each interior angle is 90 degrees. The central angles of a square would also be 90 degrees because all sides and angles are equal.

Since AD is a common side, points A and D must be vertices of both the heptagon and the square. Let me try to figure out how these points are arranged. In the Asymptote code, it seems that the heptagon is drawn with each vertex at 360i/7 + 90 degrees, which is a bit confusing. Wait, the Asymptote code is using the standard polar coordinate system, where dir(theta) gives a point on the unit circle at angle theta degrees. 

Looking at the code:

- For the heptagon: it's drawing lines from dir(360*i/7 + 90) to dir(360*(i+1)/7 + 90) for i from 0 to 7. So, each vertex is 360/7 degrees apart, and each is rotated 90 degrees from the standard position. So, the heptagon is rotated 90 degrees, meaning it starts at 90 degrees, then 180, 270, etc. But in the drawing, it's being drawn as a regular heptagon. Hmm, maybe I shouldn't overcomplicate this.

But the square is also drawn, and it's connected to points A, C, D, F. So, points A, C, D, F are part of both the heptagon and the square. Wait, the square is AD, so points A and D are connected, and then the square continues from D to F to A? Or is it A to C to D to F? Wait, the Asymptote code says draw(A--C--D--F). So, starting at A, then to C, then to D, then to F. Hmm.

So, the square is A, C, D, F. So, sides AC, CD, DF, and FA. And the heptagon is A, B, C, D, E, F, G, right? Because in the Asymptote code, it's drawing lines from A to C to D to F. So, the heptagon is A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and then back to A? Wait, but in the code, it's only drawing A, C, D, F. Hmm, maybe the heptagon is only partially drawn.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The heptagon is drawn with all the sides connected, but in the Asymptote code, it's only drawing lines from A to C to D to F. So, perhaps the heptagon is a star or something? Or maybe it's a different polygon. Hmm, maybe I should focus more on the square and the shared side AD.

So, the square has sides AD, DC, CF, and FA. The heptagon has sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, GA. So, both share the side AD, meaning that points A and D are adjacent vertices in both the square and the heptagon. So, in the square, moving from A to D is one side, and in the heptagon, moving from A to D is also one side.

Since it's a square, the angle at D in the square is 90 degrees, meaning the angle between sides AD and DC is 90 degrees. Similarly, in the heptagon, the internal angle at D is approximately 128.57 degrees, as I calculated earlier.

But wait, in the square, the angle between AD and DC is 90 degrees, while in the heptagon, the angle between AD and the next side is the internal angle. So, maybe I can figure out the position of point B relative to AD?

Looking at the Asymptote code, point B is defined as dir(360*2/7 + 90). So, similarly, each vertex of the heptagon is at 360i/7 + 90 degrees. So, point A is at 360*3/7 + 90, point B is at 360*2/7 + 90, point C is at 360*4/7 + 90, and point F is at 360*5/7 + 90? Wait, no, the code says:

For the heptagon:

- pair A = dir(360*3/7 + 90);

- pair F = dir(360*4/7 + 90);

- pair C = A+dir(90)*(F - A);

- pair D = C + F - A;

- pair B = dir(360*2/7 + 90);

So, point A is at 360*3/7 + 90 degrees, which is (3/7)*51.428... + 90, which is approximately 128.57 + 90 = 218.57 degrees. Similarly, point F is at 360*4/7 + 90 = (4/7)*51.428... + 90 ≈ 205.714 + 90 = 295.714 degrees. Point C is constructed as A + dir(90)*(F - A). So, dir(90) is (0,1), so it's moving from point A upward by the length of vector F - A. Similarly, point D is C + F - A.

Wait, this is getting a bit too detailed. Maybe I should try to find the positions of all points in the coordinate system.

Let me assume that the unit circle is the circumcircle of both polygons. So, all vertices lie on a unit circle. Then, point A is at angle (360*3/7 + 90) degrees. Let's convert that to radians for calculation purposes. 360 degrees is 2π radians. So, 3/7 of 51.428... is 218.57 degrees, which is 218.57 * π / 180 ≈ 3.813 radians.

But maybe it's easier to use complex numbers or vectors to represent the points.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry.

Let me set point A at (0,0) for simplicity, but since it's on the unit circle, maybe it's better to represent it in terms of radians.

Wait, actually, since all points are on the unit circle, let me define the angle of point A as θ_A = (360*3/7 + 90) degrees. Similarly, θ_F = (360*4/7 + 90) degrees, θ_C = θ_A + 90 degrees, θ_D = θ_C + (θ_F - θ_A) degrees, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that in the square, the angle at A is 90 degrees, and in the heptagon, the angle at A is 128.57 degrees. So, the angle between side AD and the square is 90 degrees, while in the heptagon, the angle between side AD and the next side is 128.57 degrees.

But since both share side AD, the angle between side AD and side AB in the heptagon is 128.57 degrees, and the angle between side AD and side DC in the square is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the angle between side AB and side DC is the difference between these two angles. So, 128.57 - 90 = 38.57 degrees. But wait, is that the angle BAC?

Wait, point B is part of the heptagon, so it's adjacent to A in the heptagon. So, point B is at angle θ_B = 360*2/7 + 90. Let me calculate θ_B: 360*(2/7) ≈ 102.857 degrees, plus 90 is 192.857 degrees. Similarly, point C is at θ_C = θ_A + 90 degrees. Wait, θ_A is 360*3/7 + 90, which is 154.285 degrees + 90 = 244.285 degrees. So, θ_C is 244.285 degrees. So, the angle at C is between sides CB and CD.

Wait, I need to find angle BAC, which is the angle at point A between points B and C. So, points B, A, C. So, angle BAC is the angle at A between BA and CA.

Wait, but in the square, BA is one side, and CA is another. So, angle BAC is the angle between BA and CA.

Since BA is part of the square, and CA is part of the heptagon.

So, perhaps I can compute the coordinates of points A, B, and C, then compute the angle between vectors AB and AC.

Yes, that might be a straightforward way.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, let's define the unit circle. All points are on the unit circle, so each point can be represented as (cosθ, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis.

But in the Asymptote code, point A is at angle 360*3/7 + 90 degrees. So, let's convert that to radians or just keep it as degrees for now.

Let me compute θ_A: 360*(3/7) + 90 degrees. 360*(3/7) is approximately 154.2857 degrees, plus 90 is 244.2857 degrees.

Similarly, θ_B is 360*(2/7) + 90 = 102.8571 + 90 = 192.8571 degrees.

θ_C is θ_A + 90 = 244.2857 + 90 = 334.2857 degrees.

θ_D is θ_C + (θ_F - θ_A). θ_F is 360*(4/7) + 90 ≈ 205.7143 + 90 = 295.7143 degrees.

So, θ_D = 334.2857 + (295.7143 - 244.2857) = 334.2857 + 51.4286 ≈ 385.7143 degrees. But since angles are modulo 360, 385.7143 - 360 = 25.7143 degrees.

So, point D is at 25.7143 degrees.

So, points:

A: 244.2857 degrees

B: 192.8571 degrees

C: 334.2857 degrees

D: 25.7143 degrees

F: 295.7143 degrees

So, now, we can represent all these points on the unit circle.

Now, let's compute the coordinates.

Point A: (cos θ_A, sin θ_A)

θ_A = 244.2857 degrees. Let's compute cos(244.2857) and sin(244.2857). 

244.2857 degrees is in the third quadrant. The reference angle is 244.2857 - 180 = 64.2857 degrees.

cos(244.2857) = -cos(64.2857) ≈ -0.4384

sin(244.2857) = -sin(64.2857) ≈ -0.90097

So, point A is approximately (-0.4384, -0.90097)

Similarly, point B is at θ_B = 192.8571 degrees.

192.8571 degrees is in the third quadrant. Reference angle: 192.8571 - 180 = 12.8571 degrees.

cos(192.8571) ≈ -cos(12.8571) ≈ -0.9755

sin(192.8571) ≈ -sin(12.8571) ≈ -0.2210

So, point B is approximately (-0.9755, -0.2210)

Point C is at θ_C = 334.2857 degrees.

334.2857 degrees is in the fourth quadrant. Reference angle: 360 - 334.2857 = 25.7143 degrees.

cos(334.2857) ≈ cos(25.7143) ≈ 0.9010

sin(334.2857) ≈ -sin(25.7143) ≈ -0.4384

So, point C is approximately (0.9010, -0.4384)

Point D is at θ_D = 25.7143 degrees.

cos(25.7143) ≈ 0.9010

sin(25.7143) ≈ 0.4384

So, point D is approximately (0.9010, 0.4384)

Now, we can compute vectors AB and AC.

Vector AB is from A to B: B - A = (-0.9755 - (-0.4384), -0.2210 - (-0.90097)) = (-0.9755 + 0.4384, -0.2210 + 0.90097) = (-0.5371, 0.67997)

Vector AC is from A to C: C - A = (0.9010 - (-0.4384), -0.4384 - (-0.90097)) = (0.9010 + 0.4384, -0.4384 + 0.90097) = (1.3394, 0.46257)

Now, to find angle BAC, which is the angle between vectors AB and AC at point A. The formula for the angle between two vectors u and v is:

cosφ = (u • v) / (|u| |v|)

First, compute the dot product of AB and AC.

AB • AC = (-0.5371)(1.3394) + (0.67997)(0.46257)

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-0.5371)(1.3394) ≈ -0.5371 * 1.3394 ≈ -0.720

Second term: (0.67997)(0.46257) ≈ 0.67997 * 0.46257 ≈ 0.315

So, total dot product ≈ -0.720 + 0.315 ≈ -0.405

Now, compute |AB| and |AC|.

|AB| = sqrt((-0.5371)^2 + (0.67997)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.2884 + 0.4624) ≈ sqrt(0.7508) ≈ 0.8665

|AC| = sqrt((1.3394)^2 + (0.46257)^2) ≈ sqrt(1.7934 + 0.2139) ≈ sqrt(2.0073) ≈ 1.417

So, cosφ ≈ (-0.405) / (0.8665 * 1.417) ≈ (-0.405) / (1.228) ≈ -0.329

Therefore, φ ≈ arccos(-0.329) ≈ 110 degrees (since cos(110°) ≈ -0.342, which is close to -0.329)

But wait, let me check the calculation more accurately.

First, the dot product: (-0.5371)(1.3394) + (0.67997)(0.46257)

Compute each term:

-0.5371 * 1.3394: Let's calculate 0.5371 * 1.3394 first.

0.5371 * 1 = 0.5371

0.5371 * 0.3394 ≈ 0.1817

Total ≈ 0.5371 + 0.1817 ≈ 0.7188

So, with the negative sign, it's -0.7188

Next term: 0.67997 * 0.46257

0.67997 * 0.4 = 0.271988

0.67997 * 0.06257 ≈ 0.04253

Total ≈ 0.271988 + 0.04253 ≈ 0.3145

So, total dot product ≈ -0.7188 + 0.3145 ≈ -0.4043

|AB|: sqrt((-0.5371)^2 + (0.67997)^2) = sqrt(0.288 + 0.4648) = sqrt(0.7528) ≈ 0.8676

|AC|: sqrt((1.3394)^2 + (0.46257)^2) = sqrt(1.793 + 0.2128) = sqrt(2.0058) ≈ 1.4165

So, cosφ ≈ (-0.4043)/(0.8676 * 1.4165) ≈ (-0.4043)/(1.228) ≈ -0.329

So, arccos(-0.329) is approximately 110 degrees. Let me check: cos(110°) ≈ cos(180° - 70°) = -cos(70°) ≈ -0.3420, which is a bit less than -0.329. So, the angle is slightly more than 110 degrees.

Wait, cos(110°) ≈ -0.3420

cos(112°): 180 - 68 = 112, cos(112°) ≈ -0.3746

cos(111°): cos(111°) ≈ -0.3584

cos(110.5°): Let's approximate. Maybe it's around 110.5°, which would give cos ≈ -0.329.

Yes, because cos(110°) ≈ -0.3420, so as the angle increases from 110° to 112°, cos decreases from -0.3420 to -0.3746. So, at -0.329, it's somewhere between 110° and 112°, but maybe 110.5°.

But the problem asks for the exact measure. Hmm, maybe my approximate calculations are leading me astray. Perhaps I should find a better method.

Alternatively, maybe I can use exact coordinates and compute the angle using trigonometric identities.

Wait, maybe instead of using approximate decimal values, I can use exact expressions.

Let me recall that θ_A = 244.2857°, which is 244 + 7/18 degrees. Wait, 360*3/7 is exactly 154.285714°, so θ_A is 154 + 2/7 degrees. Similarly, θ_B is 192 + 6/7 degrees, θ_C is 334 + 2/7 degrees, θ_D is 25 + 5/7 degrees.

Wait, 360 is 360°, so 360*(3/7) = 154 + 2/7°, since 360/7 ≈ 51.42857°, so 3*360/7 = 154 + 2/7°, right? 2/7 of a degree is about 0.2857°, which is about 17.14 minutes. So, θ_A is 154°17.14'

Similarly, θ_B is 192 + 6/7°, which is 192° + ~8.57°, which is 192°54'

θ_C is 334 + 2/7°, so 334°17.14'

θ_D is 25 + 5/7°, which is 25°42.857'

So, perhaps expressing these angles as fractions:

θ_A = 244 + 2/7°

θ_B = 192 + 6/7°

θ_C = 334 + 2/7°

θ_D = 25 + 5/7°

So, now, point A is at (cos(244 + 2/7°), sin(244 + 2/7°))

Similarly, point B is at (cos(192 + 6/7°), sin(192 + 6/7°))

Point C is at (cos(334 + 2/7°), sin(334 + 2/7°))

I need to compute vectors AB and AC.

Vector AB = B - A

Vector AC = C - A

Then compute the angle between AB and AC.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the angle between two vectors:

tanφ = |(u x v)| / (u • v)

Where u x v is the magnitude of the cross product.

But maybe it's more straightforward to compute the coordinates exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps using complex numbers.

Let me consider all points on the unit circle as complex numbers. Let me represent point A as e^{iθ_A}, point B as e^{iθ_B}, and point C as e^{iθ_C}. Then, vectors AB and AC can be represented as (B - A) and (C - A), respectively.

The angle between vectors AB and AC is given by the argument of (AB / AC), which is the difference in their arguments.

Alternatively, since AB and AC are vectors from A, the angle between them is the argument of (B - A) in the complex plane relative to A. Wait, maybe not exactly, because in the complex plane, the angle between vectors AB and AC is the argument of (B - A) divided by (C - A), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the direction of vectors AB and AC. Vector AB is B - A, and vector AC is C - A. So, the angle between them is the angle from AB to AC, which can be found using the cross product and dot product.

So, the angle φ satisfies:

cosφ = (AB • AC) / (|AB| |AC|)

We can compute this using exact trigonometric expressions.

Let me denote θ_A = 244 + 2/7°, θ_B = 192 + 6/7°, θ_C = 334 + 2/7°, θ_D = 25 + 5/7°, but perhaps in radians.

Wait, maybe it's better to convert everything to radians for computation.

Let me compute:

First, θ_A: 244.2857° = 244 + 2/7°, which in radians is (244 + 2/7) * π / 180

Similarly, θ_B = 192 + 6/7° = (192 + 6/7) * π / 180

θ_C = 334 + 2/7° = (334 + 2/7) * π / 180

θ_D = 25 + 5/7° = (25 + 5/7) * π / 180

So, let me compute these angles in radians:

Compute θ_A:

244 + 2/7 = 244.2857142857

Multiply by π/180: 244.2857142857 * π / 180 ≈ 244.2857142857 * 0.0174532925 ≈ 4.2703 radians

Similarly, θ_B: 192 + 6/7 ≈ 192.8571428571

192.8571428571 * π / 180 ≈ 192.8571428571 * 0.0174532925 ≈ 3.3785 radians

θ_C: 334 + 2/7 ≈ 334.2857142857

334.2857142857 * π / 180 ≈ 334.2857142857 * 0.0174532925 ≈ 5.836 radians

θ_D: 25 + 5/7 ≈ 25.7142857143

25.7142857143 * π / 180 ≈ 25.7142857143 * 0.0174532925 ≈ 0.4488 radians

Now, compute vectors AB and AC.

Vector AB = B - A: (cosθ_B - cosθ_A, sinθ_B - sinθ_A)

Vector AC = C - A: (cosθ_C - cosθ_A, sinθ_C - sinθ_A)

Compute each component:

First, compute AB_x = cosθ_B - cosθ_A

Compute AB_y = sinθ_B - sinθ_A

Similarly for AC.

But computing cosθ and sinθ for these angles might be cumbersome. Maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can help.

Alternatively, perhaps using complex numbers, we can compute the angle.

Wait, another approach: Since points A, B, C, D are on the unit circle, and we have their angles, perhaps we can compute the angle between vectors AB and AC by using the formula:

tanφ = |(AB_x * AC_y - AB_y * AC_x)| / (AB_x * AC_x + AB_y * AC_y)

But that seems complicated. Maybe it's better to compute the angle using the dot product formula.

But perhaps, instead of using degrees, I can convert everything to radians and compute the exact value.

But I think it's going to be too tedious without a calculator.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the angle between two chords in a circle can be calculated using the arcs between their endpoints.

But since points A and C are separated by some arc, and point B is another point on the circle, the angle BAC is related to the arcs.

Wait, in the circle, the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at the circumference.

But in this case, we're dealing with angle BAC, which is not necessarily at the center.

Wait, perhaps we can find the arcs from A to B, A to C, and the arc from B to C, and then relate them.

Wait, but angle BAC is the angle at A between points B and C. So, in the circle, the angle at A is related to the arc BC.

Wait, yes! In a circle, the angle formed by two chords at a point is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

So, angle BAC is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs BC and DA.

Wait, let me confirm: In circle geometry, the angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

Wait, no, actually, it's half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

Wait, more precisely, if two chords intersect at a point on the circumference, the angle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.

But in this case, angle BAC is at point A, so the angle is equal to half the measure of the arc BC that doesn't contain A.

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall: The measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circumference is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

So, in this case, angle BAC intercepts arc BC. But wait, arc BC is one of the arcs, but in the circle, the angle at A is half the measure of arc BC.

But hold on, point A is not on the circumference opposite to arc BC, but it's on the circumference as well.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the arcs.

Wait, in this case, angle BAC intercepts arc BC. But arc BC is 334.2857° - 192.8571° = 141.4286°, which is 141.4286°. So, the angle at A would be half of that, which is 70.7143°, but that seems too small, as earlier computation suggested ~110°.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong.

Wait, the angle at A is formed by points B, A, C. So, it's intercepting arc BC that does not contain A. So, if the circle is divided by points A, B, C, D, then arc BC is 141.4286°, but arc BCD is 334.2857° - 25.7143° = 328.5714°, which is a large arc.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the arcs intercepted by the angle.

But actually, the angle at A is formed by chords AB and AC. So, the intercepted arcs are arc BC and arc BDC.

Wait, but in the formula, the angle is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

So, angle BAC = 1/2 (arc BC - arc BDC)

Where arc BC is the minor arc BC, and arc BDC is the major arc BC.

So, arc BC is 334.2857° - 192.8571° = 141.4286°, and arc BDC is 360° - 141.4286° = 218.5714°.

So, angle BAC = 1/2 (141.4286° - 218.5714°) = 1/2 (-77°) = -38.5°, but since angle can't be negative, it's 38.5°, but that conflicts with our earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I got the arcs wrong.

Wait, angle at A is formed by chords AB and AC, so the intercepted arcs are arc BC and arc BDC.

But arc BC is 141.4286°, and arc BDC is 360° - 141.4286° = 218.5714°, so angle BAC = 1/2 (arc BDC - arc BC) = 1/2 (218.5714 - 141.4286) = 1/2 (77°) = 38.5°. So, angle BAC is 38.5°, which is 77/2°, so 38.5°.

But that contradicts our earlier calculation of approximately 110°. Hmm, where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I confused the intercepted arcs. Maybe it's the other way around. The angle at A is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite, which is arc BC.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps the formula is angle = 1/2 (measure of the intercepted arc). Wait, if the angle is at the circumference, then yes, it's half the intercepted arc.

But in this case, angle BAC is at point A, and it's intercepting arc BC. So, angle BAC should be half of arc BC.

But arc BC is 141.4286°, so angle BAC is 70.7143°, which is about 70.71°, but my earlier coordinate calculation gave ~110°. So, which is correct?

Wait, let me verify with coordinates.

Earlier, I found the angle to be approximately 110°, but according to this arc formula, it's 70.71°. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the arc formula.

Wait, perhaps the angle is equal to half the sum of the intercepted arcs, not the difference.

Wait, let me recall: The measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circumference is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.

So, angle BAC should be half of arc BC. So, 141.4286° / 2 = 70.7143°, which is approximately 70.71°, which is 70°43'.

But in the coordinate system, I found angle BAC to be about 110°, so which is correct? Hmm, perhaps my coordinate system approach was flawed.

Wait, perhaps my coordinates were computed incorrectly.

Wait, let me re-examine the coordinates.

Point A: 244.2857°, which is 244 + 2/7°.

Point B: 192 + 6/7°.

Point C: 334 + 2/7°.

So, in terms of radians, θ_A ≈ 4.2703, θ_B ≈ 3.3785, θ_C ≈ 5.836.

Compute vectors AB and AC.

Vector AB = B - A:

x-coordinate: cos(3.3785) - cos(4.2703)

cos(3.3785) ≈ cos(192.857°) ≈ cos(180° + 12.857°) ≈ -cos(12.857°) ≈ -0.9763

cos(4.2703) ≈ cos(244.2857°) ≈ cos(180° + 64.2857°) ≈ -cos(64.2857°) ≈ -0.4384

So, x-coordinate: -0.9763 - (-0.4384) ≈ -0.5379

y-coordinate: sin(3.3785) - sin(4.2703)

sin(3.3785) ≈ sin(192.857°) ≈ -sin(12.857°) ≈ -0.2210

sin(4.2703) ≈ sin(244.2857°) ≈ -sin(64.2857°) ≈ -0.90097

So, y-coordinate: -0.2210 - (-0.90097) ≈ 0.67997

So, vector AB ≈ (-0.5379, 0.67997)

Similarly, vector AC = C - A:

x-coordinate: cos(5.836) - cos(4.2703)

cos(5.836) ≈ cos(334.2857°) ≈ cos(360 - 25.7143°) ≈ cos(25.7143°) ≈ 0.9010

cos(4.2703) ≈ -0.4384

So, x-coordinate: 0.9010 - (-0.4384) ≈ 1.3394

y-coordinate: sin(5.836) - sin(4.2703)

sin(5.836) ≈ sin(334.2857°) ≈ -sin(25.7143°) ≈ -0.4384

sin(4.2703) ≈ -0.90097

So, y-coordinate: -0.4384 - (-0.90097) ≈ 0.46257

So, vector AC ≈ (1.3394, 0.46257)

Now, let's compute the angle between vectors AB and AC.

Dot product: (-0.5379)(1.3394) + (0.67997)(0.46257) ≈ (-0.720) + (0.315) ≈ -0.405

|AB| ≈ sqrt((-0.5379)^2 + (0.67997)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.289 + 0.462) ≈ sqrt(0.751) ≈ 0.8665

|AC| ≈ sqrt((1.3394)^2 + (0.46257)^2) ≈ sqrt(1.793 + 0.2128) ≈ sqrt(2.0058) ≈ 1.4165

So, cosφ ≈ -0.405 / (0.8665 * 1.4165) ≈ -0.405 / 1.228 ≈ -0.329

So, φ ≈ arccos(-0.329) ≈ 110°, which matches my initial calculation.

But according to the arc formula, it should be 70.71°, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I got the intercepted arcs wrong.

Wait, since angle BAC intercepts arc BC, which is 141.4286°, so 141.4286 / 2 ≈ 70.7143°, which is 70°43'.

But in the coordinate system approach, I get 110°, which is 180° - 70.7143°, so perhaps it's the other arc.

Wait, the angle at A is formed by two chords: AB and AC. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite to the angle.

But in this case, angle BAC is formed by chords AB and AC, so the intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite to angle BAC, which is arc BC.

Wait, but in the formula, the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circumference is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.

So, angle BAC should be half of arc BC.

But arc BC is 141.4286°, so angle BAC should be 70.7143°, but in coordinates, it's 110°, which is 180° - 70.7143°, which suggests that the angle is actually the reflex angle, but in reality, the angle between two vectors is the smaller angle between them, which is 70.7143°, but in my coordinate system, I computed it as 110°, which is the obtuse angle.

Wait, perhaps the formula is that the angle between two vectors is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me refer back to the formula.

When two chords intersect at a point on the circumference, the measure of the angle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.

So, angle BAC is formed by chords AB and AC, so the intercepted arc is arc BC.

Therefore, angle BAC should be half of arc BC, which is 70.7143°, but my coordinate calculation gave 110°, which is 180° - 70.7143°.

But that can't be, because the angle between two vectors is the smallest angle between them.

Wait, perhaps the angle I calculated is the angle between the vectors, but in reality, the angle at point A is 110°, which is the angle between the vectors.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the internal and external angles.

Wait, maybe the intercepted arc is the major arc BC, which is 328.5714°, so half of that is 164.2857°, but that's not matching.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that angle BAC is the angle between AB and AC, which can be computed as 180° - angle between BA and CA.

Wait, but BA and CA are vectors in opposite directions, so the angle between BA and CA is 180° - angle BAC.

Wait, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps it's better to accept that the coordinate approach is more accurate because it's based on actual vectors.

So, since the coordinate calculation gave me angle BAC ≈ 110°, which is approximately 110°, which is 110°, but the exact value is 110°, which is 110°, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, in the coordinate system, vectors AB and AC are:

AB: (-0.5379, 0.67997)

AC: (1.3394, 0.46257)

Dot product: (-0.5379)(1.3394) + (0.67997)(0.46257) = (-0.720) + (0.315) = -0.405

|AB| ≈ 0.8665

|AC| ≈ 1.4165

cosφ = -0.405 / (0.8665 * 1.4165) ≈ -0.405 / 1.228 ≈ -0.329

Thus, φ ≈ arccos(-0.329) ≈ 110°, as before.

But according to the arc formula, angle BAC should be 70.7143°, which is 70°43'.

But 70.7143° is about 70°43', which is 70°43', but in the coordinate system, it's 110°.

Wait, perhaps the angle BAC is actually the angle between BA and CA, which would be 180° - 110° = 70°, but that's not the case.

Wait, no, angle BAC is the angle at A between AB and AC, so it's 110°, which is the angle between vectors AB and AC, not the angle between BA and CA.

Wait, perhaps the angle between vectors AB and AC is 110°, which is the internal angle at A.

But when I calculated it via coordinates, it's 110°, but via arc formula, it's 70.7143°, which is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the intercepted arcs.

Wait, let me think again: when two chords intersect at a point on the circumference, the measure of the angle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.

So, angle BAC is formed by chords AB and AC. The intercepted arc is arc BC.

So, angle BAC = (1/2) * arc BC.

But arc BC is 141.4286°, so angle BAC = 70.7143°, which is approximately 70.71°.

But in coordinate system, it's 110°, which is the external angle.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for angles formed by two intersecting chords inside the circle, not on the circumference.

Wait, no, in this case, angle BAC is on the circumference.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if the intercepted arc is the minor or major arc.

Wait, in the formula, the measure of the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. If the angle is formed by two chords intersecting on the circumference, the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite the angle, which is the arc that is not containing the angle.

Wait, in this case, angle BAC is at point A, so the intercepted arc is the arc that does not contain point A. Since point A is at 244.2857°, the arc that does not contain A is arc BC.

Wait, but arc BC is 141.4286°, so angle BAC = 1/2 * 141.4286° = 70.7143°, which is 70°43'.

But in coordinates, the angle is 110°, which is the reflex angle.

Wait, perhaps I need to realize that the angle between the vectors is the smaller angle, which is 70.7143°, but the angle in the diagram is the reflex angle, which is 259.2857°, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me think of the circle. The angle at A, between points B and C, is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

So, angle BAC intercepts arc BC, which is 141.4286°, so angle BAC is half that, 70.7143°.

But in the coordinate system, the angle is 110°, which is the angle between the vectors AB and AC, which is the external angle.

Wait, so perhaps the internal angle is 70.7143°, and the external angle is 110°, which is the reflex angle.

But in the problem, it asks for the degree measure of angle BAC, which is the internal angle, so 70.7143°, which is 70°43'.

But in the problem, the square and regular heptagon share a common side AD, so perhaps the arc BC is not just 141.4286°, but is it?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the arc BC.

Wait, point B is at 192.8571°, point C is at 334.2857°, so the arc from B to C is 334.2857 - 192.8571 = 141.4286°, which is minor arc BC.

But perhaps the major arc BC is 360 - 141.4286 = 218.5714°, so the angle at A is half of the major arc, which is 109.2857°, which is approximately 109.2857°, but that's still not 70.7143°.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to step back.

The problem is asking for angle BAC, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BC, so it should be half the measure of arc BC.

If the circle is divided into arcs by the points A, B, C, D, then arc BC is 141.4286°, so angle BAC is 70.7143°, which is 70.7143°, which is 70°43'.

But in my coordinate system, I calculated it as 110°, which is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I need to realize that angle BAC is the angle between the vectors AB and AC, which is 110°, but in the circle, the inscribed angle is 70.7143°, so I need to reconcile this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the angle BAC is not the internal angle, but the external angle, which is 110°, but that's not the case because inscribed angles are always less than 180°.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the angle between vectors AB and AC, which is 110°, but since the inscribed angle is the smaller angle, it's 70.7143°, which is the angle that the problem is asking for.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the degree measure of angle BAC," so it's the internal angle, which is 70.7143°, which is 70°43', which is 70 + 43/60 ≈ 70.7143°.

But in the problem statement, it says that the square and heptagon share a common side AD, so perhaps the arc BC is 141.4286°, so angle BAC is 70.7143°, which is 70°43'.

But 70.7143° is a fraction, but the problem says to express it as a common fraction.

So, 70.7143° is approximately 70 and 5/7°, because 5/7 ≈ 0.7143.

So, 70° + 5/7° = 70 5/7°, which is 70 5/7°, which is 5/7°.

So, the exact measure is 70 5/7°, which as a fraction is 70 5/7 = (70 * 7 + 5)/7 = 495/7°, but 495 divided by 7 is 70.7142857, which is 70 5/7°.

Wait, but 70 5/7° is equal to 505/7°, but 505 divided by 7 is 72.1428°, which is not 70.7143°, so that's incorrect.

Wait, wait, 70.7143° is equal to 70 + 0.7143°, and 0.7143° is equal to 5/7°, so 70 5/7°, which is 70.7142857°, which is 505/7°, but 505/7 is approximately 72.1428°, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, 0.7143° is 5/7°, so 70.7143° is 70 5/7°, which is 505/7°, but that's wrong because 505 divided by 7 is 72.1428°, which is not 70.7143°.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, 0.7143° is approximately 5/7°, which is correct because 5 divided by 7 is approximately 0.7142857.

So, 70.7143° is 70 5/7°, which is 70.7142857°, which is a common fraction: 505/7°, but that's incorrect because 505 divided by 7 is 72.1428°.

Wait, no, 70 5/7° is 70 + 5/7°, which is 70 + (5/7)°, which is 70.7142857°, which is equal to 505/7°, but that's incorrect because 505 divided by 7 is 72.142857°, which is not 70.7142857°.

Wait, perhaps I should express 70 5/7° as a common fraction.

70 5/7° is equal to (70 * 7 + 5)/7 = (490 + 5)/7 = 495/7°, which is approximately 70.7142857°, which is correct.

So, 495/7°, but 495 divided by 7 is 70.7142857°, which is 70 5/7°.

So, 495/7 is the exact value, but it's better to write it as 70 5/7°, which is a common fraction.

But wait, 70 5/7° is 70.7142857°, which is approximately 70.7143°, which is 70°43', which is 70 degrees and 43 minutes.

But the problem asks for a common fraction, so 495/7°, but that's not a common fraction in the sense of a single fraction, but 70 5/7° is a mixed number, which is acceptable.

Alternatively, 495/7° is an improper fraction, but it's not necessary to simplify it further.

Therefore, the exact measure of angle BAC is 70 5/7°, which is 495/7°, which is a common fraction.

So, the answer is 495/7°, which simplifies to 70 5/7°, but as a common fraction, 495/7 is acceptable.

Wait, but 495 divided by 7 is 70.7142857°, which is equal to 70°43', so 70 5/7°, which is 495/7°, correct.

But I think the problem expects the answer as a fraction, so 495/7°, or 70 5/7°.

But perhaps it's better to write it as 70 5/7°, as it's a mixed number, which is more understandable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach, where angle BAC is calculated using the properties of the square and heptagon, leading to a different measure.

Wait, perhaps since the square has angles of 90°, and the heptagon has angles of 128.5714°, maybe the angle BAC is formed by two specific sides.

Wait, but in any case, the coordinate approach gave me 110°, which conflicts with the arc formula.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the angle is 110°, but according to the intercepted arc, it's 70.7143°, but the angle in the diagram is the reflex angle, which is 259.2857°, but angle BAC is the internal angle, so 70.7143°, which is 70 5/7°, which is 495/7°, so 495/7°, which is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to accept that the answer is 110°, but that conflicts with the arc formula.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the intercepted arcs.

Wait, let me try another approach.

Since the square and heptagon share a common side AD, and point A is common to both, then AD is a side of both polygons.

In a square, each side is at 90°, so if AD is a side, then the angle at A in the square is 90°, but in the heptagon, each internal angle is 128.5714°, so the angle at A in the heptagon is 128.5714°, but since it's a regular heptagon, all internal angles are equal.

Wait, so the angle at A in the square is 90°, and in the heptagon, it's 128.5714°, but since it's the same point A, the angle between the square and heptagon is 90°, but the internal angle of the heptagon is 128.5714°, so the angle between the two polygons at A is 128.5714° - 90° = 38.5714°, which is 38.5714°, which is 38°34'.

Wait, but this is the angle between the side of the heptagon and the side of the square, but angle BAC is the angle at A between BA and CA.

Wait, so, if the angle between AD and AB is 90°, and the angle between AD and AC is 128.5714°, then the angle at A between BA and CA is 128.5714° - 90° = 38.5714°, which is 38°34'.

But 38.5714° is 38°34', which is 38 3/8°, which is not matching with the coordinate result of 110°, which is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the angle between BA and CA as the external angle.

Wait, in the square, at point A, the angle between AD and AB is 90°, and in the heptagon, the angle between AD and AC is 128.5714°, so the angle between BA and CA is the difference between these angles, which is 128.5714° - 90° = 38.5714°, which is 38°34'.

But that is a small angle, not 110°, which conflicts with the coordinate system result.

Wait, perhaps the angle BAC is the external angle, so 360° - 38.5714° = 321.4286°, which is still not 110°.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should consider that the angle BAC is 110°, as calculated via coordinates, which is 110°, and 110° is equal to 70.7143° plus 40°, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's better to conclude that the angle BAC is 110°, which is 110°, as calculated via coordinates, despite the arc formula suggesting otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption that angle BAC intercepts arc BC is incorrect, and instead, the angle BAC intercepts the other arc, the major arc BC, which is 218.5714°, so half of that is 109.2857°, which is approximately 109.2857°, which is 109°17', which is still not matching.

Wait, but 109.2857° is 109°17', which is not a common fraction either.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, if points A, B, C, D are on the circle, then angle BAC is an inscribed angle subtended by arc BC, which is 141.4286°, so angle BAC is 70.7143°, which is 70°43', which is 495/7°, a common fraction.

Therefore, despite the coordinate system suggesting 110°, the inscribed angle theorem tells us that angle BAC is half the measure of arc BC, which is 141.4286°, so 70.7143°, which is 70 5/7°, or 495/7°, which is approximately 70.7143°.

Therefore, the answer is 495/7°, which can be expressed as a common fraction, so 495/7°, which is equal to 70 5/7°, which is 70.7142857°.

Wait, perhaps I should rationalize the steps:

1. The circle is divided into a square and a regular heptagon sharing side AD.

2. The central angles for the square are 90°, and for the heptagon are approximately 51.4286°.

3. Point A is at 244.2857°, point B at 192.8571°, point C at 334.2857°, point D at 25.7143°.

4. The measure of angle BAC is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BC, which is 141.4286°, so angle BAC is half that, 70.7143°, which is 70 5/7°, or 495/7°.

Therefore, the answer is 495/7°, which simplifies to 70 5/7°, which is approximately 70.7143°.

But since the problem asks for a common fraction, 495/7° is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects 110°, but according to the arc formula, it's 70.7143°, which is 70 5/7°, so 495/7°, which is the exact value.

Thus, the degree measure of angle BAC is 495/7°, which is 70 5/7°, so that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The degree measure of angle \( BAC \) is \boxed{\dfrac{495}{7}} degrees.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find the degree measure of angle \( BAC \) where a square and a regular heptagon share a common side \( \overline{AD} \). 

1. **Understanding the Polygons**:
   - A square has all sides equal and each internal angle is 90 degrees.
   - A regular heptagon has all sides equal and each internal angle is approximately 128.5714 degrees.

2. **Central Angles**:
   - The square contributes a central angle of 90 degrees.
   - The heptagon contributes a central angle of approximately 51.4286 degrees.

3. **Positioning Points on the Unit Circle**:
   - Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) are placed on the unit circle.
   - Point \( A \) is at 244.2857°.
   - Point \( B \) is at 192.8571°.
   - Point \( C \) is at 334.2857°.
   - Point \( D \) is at 25.7143°.

4. **Calculating Vectors**:
   - Vector \( \overrightarrow{AB} \) from \( A \) to \( B \).
   - Vector \( \overrightarrow{AC} \) from \( A \) to \( C \).

5. **Using the Dot Product**:
   - The angle \( \angle BAC \) is calculated using the dot product formula.
   - The cosine of the angle is found to be approximately -0.329, leading to an angle of approximately 110 degrees.

6. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**:
   - The angle \( \angle BAC \) is formed by the inscribed angles subtended by arc \( BC \).
   - The measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc \( BC \).

7. **Intercepted Arc Calculation**:
   - The arc \( BC \) is 141.4286°, so the inscribed angle \( \angle BAC \) is half of this, which is 70.7143°.

8. **Conversion to Common Fraction**:
   - 70.7143° is approximately 70 5/7°, which is the common fraction \( \frac{495}{7} \).

Thus, the degree measure of angle \( BAC \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{495}{7}}\) degrees.
