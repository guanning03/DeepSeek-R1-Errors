Question:
Let $z$ be a complex number such that $|z| = 1.$  Find the maximum value of
\[|1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2|.\]

Correct Answer:
Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.  Since $|z| = 1,$ $x^2 + y^2 = 1.$  Then
\begin{align*}
|1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| &= |1 + x + yi| + |1 - x - yi + x^2 + 2xyi - y^2| \\
&= |(1 + x) + yi| + |(1 - x + x^2 - 1 + x^2) + (-y + 2xy)i| \\
&= |(1 + x) + yi| + |(-x + 2x^2) + (-y + 2xy)i| \\
&= \sqrt{(1 + x)^2 + y^2} + \sqrt{(-x + 2x^2)^2 + (-y + 2xy)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{(1 + x)^2 + y^2} + \sqrt{(-x + 2x^2)^2 + y^2 (1 - 2x)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{(1 + x)^2 + 1 - x^2} + \sqrt{(-x + 2x^2)^2 + (1 - x^2) (1 - 2x)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{2 + 2x} + \sqrt{1 - 4x + 4x^2} \\
&= \sqrt{2 + 2x} + |1 - 2x|.
\end{align*}Let $u = \sqrt{2 + 2x}.$  Then $u^2 = 2 + 2x,$ so
\[\sqrt{2 + 2x} + |1 - 2x| = u + |3 - u^2|.\]Since $-1 \le x \le 1,$ $0 \le u \le 2.$

If $0 \le u \le \sqrt{3},$ then
\[u + |3 - u^2| = u + 3 - u^2 = \frac{13}{4} - \left( u - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \le \frac{13}{4}.\]Equality occurs when $u = \frac{1}{2},$ or $x = -\frac{7}{8}.$

If $\sqrt{3} \le u \le 2,$ then
\[u + u^2 - 3 = \left( u + \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{13}{4} \le \left( 2 + \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{13}{4} = 3 < \frac{13}{4}.\]Therefore, the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{13}{4}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem here: Let \( z \) be a complex number such that \( |z| = 1 \). I need to find the maximum value of \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that since \( |z| = 1 \), \( z \) lies on the unit circle in the complex plane. That means I can represent \( z \) as \( e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). So, let me write that down:

\( z = e^{i\theta} \).

Okay, now I need to compute \( |1 + z| \) and \( |1 - z + z^2| \). Let me tackle each term separately.

Starting with \( |1 + z| \). If \( z = e^{i\theta} \), then \( 1 + z = 1 + e^{i\theta} \). I remember that the modulus of a complex number \( a + ib \) is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). So, maybe I can express \( 1 + e^{i\theta} \) in terms of sine and cosine.

Expressing \( e^{i\theta} \) as \( \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), so:

\( 1 + z = 1 + \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \).

So, the modulus squared would be:

\( |1 + z|^2 = (1 + \cos\theta)^2 + (\sin\theta)^2 \).

Let me expand that:

\( (1 + 2\cos\theta + \cos^2\theta) + \sin^2\theta \).

Simplify using the identity \( \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1 \):

\( 1 + 2\cos\theta + 1 = 2 + 2\cos\theta \).

So, \( |1 + z| = \sqrt{2 + 2\cos\theta} \).

I can factor out a 2:

\( \sqrt{2(1 + \cos\theta)} \).

And I recall that \( 1 + \cos\theta = 2\cos^2(\theta/2) \). So:

\( |1 + z| = \sqrt{2 \times 2\cos^2(\theta/2)} = \sqrt{4\cos^2(\theta/2)} = 2|\cos(\theta/2)| \).

Since \( |z| = 1 \), \( \theta \) can range from 0 to \( 2\pi \), so \( \cos(\theta/2) \) can be positive or negative depending on \( \theta \). But since we have the modulus, it's non-negative, so \( |1 + z| = 2|\cos(\theta/2)| \).

Alright, that takes care of the first term. Now, moving on to the second term: \( |1 - z + z^2| \).

Again, since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), let's substitute that in:

\( 1 - z + z^2 = 1 - e^{i\theta} + e^{i2\theta} \).

Hmm, maybe I can express this in terms of sine and cosine as well. Let me write \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{i2\theta} = \cos2\theta + i\sin2\theta \).

So, substituting these in:

\( 1 - (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (\cos2\theta + i\sin2\theta) \).

Let me group the real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 1 - \cos\theta + \cos2\theta \).

Imaginary part: \( -\sin\theta + \sin2\theta \).

So, the complex number is \( (1 - \cos\theta + \cos2\theta) + i(-\sin\theta + \sin2\theta) \).

To find the modulus, I need to compute the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

So, \( |1 - z + z^2|^2 = (1 - \cos\theta + \cos2\theta)^2 + (-\sin\theta + \sin2\theta)^2 \).

Let me compute each part separately.

First, let's compute \( (1 - \cos\theta + \cos2\theta)^2 \).

Expanding this:

\( (1)^2 + (-\cos\theta)^2 + (\cos2\theta)^2 + 2 \times 1 \times (-\cos\theta) + 2 \times 1 \times \cos2\theta + 2 \times (-\cos\theta) \times \cos2\theta \).

Which is:

\( 1 + \cos^2\theta + \cos^22\theta - 2\cos\theta + 2\cos2\theta - 2\cos\theta \cos2\theta \).

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to expand it.

Alternatively, I can use the identity \( \cos2\theta = 2\cos^2\theta - 1 \). Let me substitute that into the expression.

So, \( 1 - \cos\theta + 2\cos^2\theta - 1 = -\cos\theta + 2\cos^2\theta \).

So, the real part becomes \( 2\cos^2\theta - \cos\theta \). Squared, that's \( (2\cos^2\theta - \cos\theta)^2 \).

Let me compute that:

\( (2\cos^2\theta - \cos\theta)^2 = 4\cos^4\theta - 4\cos^3\theta + \cos^2\theta \).

Okay, now moving on to the imaginary part squared: \( (-\sin\theta + \sin2\theta)^2 \).

Again, let me expand this:

\( (-\sin\theta)^2 + (\sin2\theta)^2 + 2 \times (-\sin\theta) \times \sin2\theta \).

Which is:

\( \sin^2\theta + \sin^22\theta - 2\sin\theta \sin2\theta \).

Again, perhaps using identities here. Let me recall that \( \sin2\theta = 2\sin\theta \cos\theta \).

So, \( \sin^22\theta = (2\sin\theta \cos\theta)^2 = 4\sin^2\theta \cos^2\theta \).

And \( 2\sin\theta \sin2\theta = 2\sin\theta \times 2\sin\theta \cos\theta = 4\sin^2\theta \cos\theta \).

So, putting it all together:

Imaginary part squared = \( \sin^2\theta + 4\sin^2\theta \cos^2\theta - 4\sin^2\theta \cos\theta \).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I can factor or simplify it differently.

Wait, perhaps I can use more trigonometric identities. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: Instead of expanding, maybe use the fact that modulus squared is equal to the product of the complex number with its conjugate.

So, \( |1 - z + z^2|^2 = (1 - z + z^2)(1 - \overline{z} + \overline{z}^2) \).

Since \( |z| = 1 \), \( \overline{z} = 1/z \), so \( \overline{z} = e^{-i\theta} \).

Therefore,

\( (1 - z + z^2)(1 - e^{-i\theta} + e^{-i2\theta}) \).

But this might be more complicated. Maybe expanding it is better.

Alternatively, perhaps compute real and imaginary parts separately and then add them.

Wait, let me go back and compute both parts step by step.

First, real part squared:

\( (1 - \cos\theta + \cos2\theta)^2 = 1 - 2\cos\theta + \cos^2\theta + 2\cos2\theta - 2\cos\theta \cos2\theta + \cos^22\theta \).

Wait, that seems similar to what I had before. Maybe I can use another identity for \( \cos2\theta \).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just compute the modulus squared as:

\( |1 - z + z^2|^2 = |1 - z + z^2|^2 \).

But maybe another approach is to express \( 1 - z + z^2 \) in terms of \( z \).

Wait, note that \( z^3 - 1 = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) \). Hmm, not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps consider \( 1 - z + z^2 = \frac{z^3 + 1}{z + 1} \) if \( z \neq -1 \). But not sure if that helps either.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe using vectors or geometry.

Since \( z \) is on the unit circle, let me think of \( z \) as a point on the unit circle in the complex plane. Then, \( |1 + z| \) is the distance from \( z \) to \( -1 \) on the real axis, and \( |1 - z + z^2| \) is the distance from \( z \) to some other point. Maybe I can represent this geometrically?

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to just compute the modulus squared for \( |1 - z + z^2| \) and see if it simplifies.

Wait, let me try to compute \( |1 - z + z^2|^2 \) again.

So, \( |1 - z + z^2|^2 = (1 - z + z^2)(1 - \overline{z} + \overline{z}^2) \).

Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), \( \overline{z} = e^{-i\theta} \).

So,

\( (1 - z + z^2)(1 - e^{-i\theta} + e^{-i2\theta}) \).

Let me multiply these two expressions:

First, multiply 1 with each term:

1 * 1 = 1

1 * (-e^{-i\theta}) = -e^{-i\theta}

1 * e^{-i2\theta} = e^{-i2\theta}

Then, multiply -z with each term:

-z * 1 = -z

-z * (-e^{-i\theta}) = z e^{-i\theta}

-z * e^{-i2\theta} = -z e^{-i2\theta}

Then, multiply z^2 with each term:

z^2 * 1 = z^2

z^2 * (-e^{-i\theta}) = -z^2 e^{-i\theta}

z^2 * e^{-i2\theta} = z^2 e^{-i2\theta}

Now, let's group all these terms:

1 - e^{-i\theta} + e^{-i2\theta} - z + z e^{-i\theta} - z e^{-i2\theta} + z^2 - z^2 e^{-i\theta} + z^2 e^{-i2\theta}

Hmm, that's a lot of terms. Maybe I can rearrange them in terms of powers of z and e^{-i\theta}.

Let me see:

Constant term: 1

Terms with z: -z

Terms with z^2: z^2

Terms with e^{-i\theta}: -e^{-i\theta}

Terms with e^{-i2\theta}: e^{-i2\theta}

Terms with z e^{-i\theta}: z e^{-i\theta}

Terms with z^2 e^{-i\theta}: z^2 e^{-i\theta}

Terms with e^{-i2\theta}: -z e^{-i2\theta}

Terms with z^2 e^{-i2\theta}: z^2 e^{-i2\theta}

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can use the fact that \( z^3 = 1 \) when \( z \) is a cube root of unity, but since \( z \) is arbitrary on the unit circle, that might not hold here.

Wait, another idea: Let's express everything in terms of \( \cos\theta \) and \( \sin\theta \).

Since \( z = e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), \( z^2 = e^{i2\theta} = \cos2\theta + i\sin2\theta \), and \( z^3 = e^{i3\theta} = \cos3\theta + i\sin3\theta \).

But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider \( |1 - z + z^2|^2 \) as \( |(1 - z) + z^2|^2 \). Hmm, but I don't see an immediate way to simplify that.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that \( |a + b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2\text{Re}(a \overline{b}) \).

So, let me write \( a = 1 - z \) and \( b = z^2 \).

Then,

\( |a + b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2\text{Re}(a \overline{b}) \).

Compute each term:

First, \( |a|^2 = |1 - z|^2 = (1 - z)(1 - \overline{z}) = 1 - z - \overline{z} + z \overline{z} = 1 - 2\text{Re}(z) + 1 = 2 - 2\cos\theta \).

Because \( z \overline{z} = |z|^2 = 1 \), and \( z + \overline{z} = 2\cos\theta \).

Second, \( |b|^2 = |z^2|^2 = |z|^4 = 1^4 = 1 \).

Third, \( 2\text{Re}(a \overline{b}) = 2\text{Re}((1 - z) \overline{z^2}) \).

Compute \( (1 - z) \overline{z^2} = (1 - z) e^{-i2\theta} \).

Multiply this out:

\( (1 - z) e^{-i2\theta} = e^{-i2\theta} - z e^{-i2\theta} \).

But \( z = e^{i\theta} \), so \( z e^{-i2\theta} = e^{i\theta} e^{-i2\theta} = e^{-i\theta} \).

Therefore, \( (1 - z) e^{-i2\theta} = e^{-i2\theta} - e^{-i\theta} \).

So, \( \text{Re}((1 - z) e^{-i2\theta}) = \text{Re}(e^{-i2\theta} - e^{-i\theta}) = \cos(-2\theta) - \cos\theta = \cos2\theta - \cos\theta \).

Therefore, \( 2\text{Re}(a \overline{b}) = 2(\cos2\theta - \cos\theta) \).

Putting it all together:

\( |1 - z + z^2|^2 = |1 - z|^2 + |z^2|^2 + 2\text{Re}(a \overline{b}) = (2 - 2\cos\theta) + 1 + 2(\cos2\theta - \cos\theta) \).

Simplify this:

\( 2 - 2\cos\theta + 1 + 2\cos2\theta - 2\cos\theta = 3 - 4\cos\theta + 2\cos2\theta \).

So, \( |1 - z + z^2|^2 = 3 - 4\cos\theta + 2\cos2\theta \).

Hmm, okay. So now, let me recap:

We have \( |1 + z| = 2|\cos(\theta/2)| \) and \( |1 - z + z^2|^2 = 3 - 4\cos\theta + 2\cos2\theta \).

Therefore, \( |1 - z + z^2| = \sqrt{3 - 4\cos\theta + 2\cos2\theta} \).

So, the expression we need to maximize is \( 2|\cos(\theta/2)| + \sqrt{3 - 4\cos\theta + 2\cos2\theta} \).

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can simplify \( 3 - 4\cos\theta + 2\cos2\theta \).

Let me see if I can express this in terms of \( \cos(\theta/2) \) as well.

We know that \( \cos2\theta = 2\cos^2\theta - 1 \), so let's substitute that in:

\( 3 - 4\cos\theta + 2(2\cos^2\theta - 1) = 3 - 4\cos\theta + 4\cos^2\theta - 2 \).

Simplify:

\( (3 - 2) + (-4\cos\theta) + 4\cos^2\theta = 1 - 4\cos\theta + 4\cos^2\theta \).

So, \( 3 - 4\cos\theta + 2\cos2\theta = 1 - 4\cos\theta + 4\cos^2\theta = (2\cos\theta - 1)^2 \).

Wait, really? Let's check:

\( (2\cos\theta - 1)^2 = 4\cos^2\theta - 4\cos\theta + 1 \). Yes, exactly. So, \( |1 - z + z^2|^2 = (2\cos\theta - 1)^2 \).

Therefore, \( |1 - z + z^2| = |2\cos\theta - 1| \).

Since modulus is always non-negative, and \( 2\cos\theta - 1 \) can be positive or negative, we take the absolute value.

Thus, \( |1 - z + z^2| = |2\cos\theta - 1| \).

Alright, that's a much simpler expression than I initially thought.

So, putting it all together, the expression we need to maximize is:

\( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| = 2|\cos(\theta/2)| + |2\cos\theta - 1| \).

Hmm, okay, so now we have an expression in terms of \( \theta \). Let me denote \( x = \theta \) for simplicity. So, our expression is \( 2|\cos(x/2)| + |2\cos x - 1| \). We need to find the maximum of this expression for \( x \in [0, 2\pi) \).

This seems a bit tricky, but maybe we can analyze this function. Let me think about how \( 2|\cos(x/2)| \) and \( |2\cos x - 1| \) behave.

First, let me note that \( |\cos(x/2)| \) is always non-negative, and its maximum is 1, occurring at \( x/2 = 0 \) or \( x = 0 \), \( x = 2\pi \), etc. So, \( 2|\cos(x/2)| \) has a maximum value of 2, occurring at \( x = 0, 2\pi, 4\pi, \) etc.

On the other hand, \( |2\cos x - 1| \) is an absolute value function. Let's analyze its behavior.

The expression inside the absolute value is \( 2\cos x - 1 \). Let's find when it's positive and when it's negative.

\( 2\cos x - 1 \geq 0 \) when \( \cos x \geq 1/2 \), which occurs when \( x \in [-\pi/3, \pi/3] \) modulo \( 2\pi \).

Similarly, \( 2\cos x - 1 < 0 \) when \( \cos x < 1/2 \), which occurs when \( x \in (\pi/3, 5\pi/3) \) modulo \( 2\pi \).

Therefore, the expression \( |2\cos x - 1| \) is equal to:

- \( 2\cos x - 1 \) when \( x \in [0, \pi/3] \cup [5\pi/3, 2\pi] \)
- \( 1 - 2\cos x \) when \( x \in [\pi/3, 5\pi/3] \)

So, let's consider these intervals separately.

Now, let me try to analyze the function \( f(x) = 2|\cos(x/2)| + |2\cos x - 1| \).

Since \( |\cos(x/2)| \) is even, the function \( f(x) \) is symmetric around \( x = 0 \). So, it's sufficient to analyze \( x \) in \( [0, \pi] \) and then mirror it.

But maybe it's better to consider the entire interval \( [0, 2\pi] \) and break it down into regions where the expressions inside the absolute values have consistent signs.

So, the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign are at \( x = 0, \pi/3, 2\pi/3, \pi, 4\pi/3, 5\pi/3, 2\pi \).

So, let me divide the interval \( [0, 2\pi] \) into subintervals based on these critical points:

1. \( [0, \pi/3] \)
2. \( [\pi/3, 2\pi/3] \)
3. \( [2\pi/3, \pi] \)
4. \( [\pi, 4\pi/3] \)
5. \( [4\pi/3, 5\pi/3] \)
6. \( [5\pi/3, 2\pi] \)

In each of these intervals, I can write \( f(x) \) without absolute values and then find its maximum.

Let me proceed step by step.

**Interval 1: \( [0, \pi/3] \)**

In this interval, \( \cos x \geq 1/2 \), so \( |2\cos x - 1| = 2\cos x - 1 \).

Also, \( x \in [0, \pi/3] \), so \( x/2 \in [0, \pi/6] \), hence \( \cos(x/2) \geq \sqrt{3}/2 \). Therefore, \( |\cos(x/2)| = \cos(x/2) \).

Thus, \( f(x) = 2\cos(x/2) + 2\cos x - 1 \).

Let me simplify this:

\( f(x) = 2\cos(x/2) + 2\cos x - 1 \).

I can use the double-angle identity for cosine: \( \cos x = 2\cos^2(x/2) - 1 \).

Substituting this in:

\( f(x) = 2\cos(x/2) + 2(2\cos^2(x/2) - 1) - 1 = 2\cos(x/2) + 4\cos^2(x/2) - 2 - 1 \).

Simplify:

\( f(x) = 4\cos^2(x/2) + 2\cos(x/2) - 3 \).

Let me denote \( y = \cos(x/2) \). Then, \( f(x) = 4y^2 + 2y - 3 \).

Since \( x \in [0, \pi/3] \), \( x/2 \in [0, \pi/6] \), so \( \cos(x/2) \in [\sqrt{3}/2, 1] \).

Therefore, \( y \in [\sqrt{3}/2, 1] \).

So, we have a quadratic function in \( y \): \( f(y) = 4y^2 + 2y - 3 \).

To find its maximum on \( y \in [\sqrt{3}/2, 1] \), let's check the endpoints and the vertex.

The vertex of the quadratic is at \( y = -b/(2a) = -2/(8) = -1/4 \). Since the vertex is at \( y = -1/4 \), which is outside our interval \( [\sqrt{3}/2, 1] \), the maximum on this interval will occur at one of the endpoints.

Compute \( f(\sqrt{3}/2) \):

\( 4(\sqrt{3}/2)^2 + 2(\sqrt{3}/2) - 3 = 4(3/4) + \sqrt{3} - 3 = 3 + \sqrt{3} - 3 = \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \).

Compute \( f(1) \):

\( 4(1)^2 + 2(1) - 3 = 4 + 2 - 3 = 3 \).

So, on this interval, the maximum is 3 at \( x = \pi \).

Wait, but hold on, \( x = \pi \) is outside this interval. Wait, no, in this interval, x is up to \( \pi/3 \).

Wait, but in this interval, x is in [0, pi/3], so the maximum is at x = pi/3.

Wait, but when x = pi/3, let's compute f(x):

\( f(pi/3) = 2cos(pi/6) + |2cos(pi/3) -1| = 2*(sqrt(3)/2) + |2*(1/2) -1| = sqrt(3) + |1 -1| = sqrt(3) + 0 = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732 \).

Wait, but earlier, when I computed f(pi/3), the value is sqrt(3), but f(1) is 3, which is higher. But in this interval, x is only up to pi/3, so the maximum in this interval is sqrt(3).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast.

Wait, in this interval, \( x \in [0, pi/3] \), so the maximum can be at x = pi/3 or possibly at some other point? Wait, but I concluded that the maximum is at x = pi/3.

Wait, but if I set the derivative to zero, maybe?

Let me compute f(x) in this interval:

\( f(x) = 4\cos^2(x/2) + 2\cos(x/2) - 3 \).

Compute derivative:

\( f'(x) = 2*4\cos(x/2)*(-sin(x/2))*(1/2) + (-2\sin(x/2))*(1/2) \).

Wait, actually, better to write f(x) as 4y^2 + 2y - 3 where y = cos(x/2).

Then, derivative is 8y*(-sin(x/2))*(1/2) + 2*(-sin(x/2))*(1/2) = (-4y sin(x/2)) - sin(x/2).

Set derivative to zero:

(-4y - 1) sin(x/2) = 0.

Since sin(x/2) is not zero in [0, pi/3], we have -4y -1 = 0 => y = -1/4.

But y = cos(x/2) cannot be -1/4 in [0, pi/3], as cos(x/2) is in [sqrt(3)/2, 1]. Therefore, no critical points inside the interval. Thus, the maximum occurs at x = pi/3, which gives f(x) = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732.

Okay, moving on.

**Interval 2: \( [\pi/3, 2\pi/3] \)**

In this interval, \( \cos x < 1/2 \), so \( |2\cos x -1| = 1 - 2\cos x \).

Also, \( x \in [\pi/3, 2\pi/3] \), so \( x/2 \in [\pi/6, \pi/3] \). Therefore, \( \cos(x/2) \in [\cos(\pi/3), \cos(\pi/6)] = [1/2, sqrt(3)/2] \). So, \( |\cos(x/2)| = \cos(x/2) \).

Thus, \( f(x) = 2\cos(x/2) + 1 - 2\cos x \).

Simplify:

\( f(x) = 2\cos(x/2) + 1 - 2\cos x \).

Again, use the identity \( \cos x = 2\cos^2(x/2) -1 \):

Substitute:

\( f(x) = 2\cos(x/2) + 1 - 2(2\cos^2(x/2) -1) \).

Simplify:

\( f(x) = 2\cos(x/2) + 1 - 4\cos^2(x/2) + 2 \).

Combine like terms:

\( f(x) = -4\cos^2(x/2) + 2\cos(x/2) + 3 \).

Let me denote y = cos(x/2). Then, \( f(x) = -4y^2 + 2y + 3 \).

In this interval, \( x \in [\pi/3, 2\pi/3] \), so \( x/2 \in [\pi/6, \pi/3] \), hence \( y = cos(x/2) \in [sqrt(3)/2, 1/2] \).

So, y is in [sqrt(3)/2, 1/2].

Thus, f(y) = -4y^2 + 2y + 3.

This is a quadratic function opening downward (because the coefficient of y^2 is negative). The vertex is at y = -b/(2a) = -2/(2*(-4)) = 1/4.

But 1/4 is less than both sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866 and 1/2, so the maximum of this quadratic on the interval [sqrt(3)/2, 1/2] will be at one of the endpoints.

Compute f(sqrt(3)/2):

\( -4*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2) + 3 = -4*(3/4) + sqrt(3) + 3 = -3 + sqrt(3) + 3 = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732 \).

Compute f(1/2):

\( -4*(1/2)^2 + 2*(1/2) + 3 = -4*(1/4) + 1 + 3 = -1 + 1 + 3 = 3 \).

Wait, but 3 is higher than sqrt(3). So, the maximum in this interval is 3 at x = 2pi/3.

But hold on, x = 2pi/3 is in [pi/3, 2pi/3], so that's okay.

Wait, but is x = 2pi/3 within the interval? Yes, since 2pi/3 is the upper bound.

So, the maximum in this interval is 3.

Moving on.

**Interval 3: \( [2\pi/3, pi] \)**

In this interval, \( \cos x < 1/2 \), so \( |2cosx -1| = 1 - 2cosx \).

Also, \( x \in [2pi/3, pi] \), so \( x/2 \in [pi/3, pi/2] \). Therefore, \( cos(x/2) \in [0, 1/2] \). So, \( |\cos(x/2)| = cos(x/2) \).

Thus, \( f(x) = 2cos(x/2) + 1 - 2cosx \).

Again, substitute \( cosx = 2cos^2(x/2) -1 \):

\( f(x) = 2cos(x/2) + 1 - 2(2cos^2(x/2) -1) \).

Simplify:

\( f(x) = 2cos(x/2) + 1 - 4cos^2(x/2) + 2 \).

Combine like terms:

\( f(x) = -4cos^2(x/2) + 2cos(x/2) + 3 \).

Let me denote y = cos(x/2). Then, f(y) = -4y^2 + 2y + 3.

In this interval, y = cos(x/2) ∈ [0, 1/2].

Thus, f(y) = -4y^2 + 2y + 3, which is again a quadratic opening downward, with vertex at y = 1/4.

Since y ∈ [0, 1/2], and 1/4 is within [0, 1/2], the maximum is at y =1/4.

Compute f(1/4):

\( -4*(1/4)^2 + 2*(1/4) + 3 = -4*(1/16) + 0.5 + 3 = -0.25 + 0.5 + 3 = 3.25 \).

Wait, 3.25 is higher than 3, so the maximum in this interval is 3.25 at y = 1/4.

Wait, but in this interval, the maximum is at y =1/4, which corresponds to x/2 = arccos(1/4), so x = 2 arccos(1/4).

Let me compute arccos(1/4):

arccos(1/4) ≈ 1.318 radians ≈ 75.522 degrees.

Therefore, x ≈ 2 * 1.318 ≈ 2.636 radians ≈ 150 degrees.

Wait, but 2.636 radians is in [2pi/3 ≈ 2.094, pi ≈ 3.1416], so that's okay.

So, the maximum in this interval is 3.25.

Wait, but 3.25 is 13/4, which is 3.25, so that's higher than previous maximums.

But let me confirm.

Wait, in this interval, f(y) = -4y^2 + 2y + 3.

Vertex at y =1/4, as above, so maximum is 3.25.

So, that's higher than 3.

**Interval 4: [pi, 4pi/3]**

In this interval, \( cosx >= 1/2 \), so \( |2cosx -1| = 2cosx -1 \).

Also, x ∈ [pi, 4pi/3], so x/2 ∈ [pi/2, 2pi/3]. Therefore, cos(x/2) ∈ [-1/2, 0]. So, |cos(x/2)| = |cos(x/2)| = |negative| = positive. So, |cos(x/2)| = |cos(x/2)|, but since x/2 is in [pi/2, 2pi/3], cos(x/2) is negative, so |cos(x/2)| = -cos(x/2).

Therefore, f(x) = 2*(-cos(x/2)) + 2cosx -1.

Simplify:

\( f(x) = -2\cos(x/2) + 2cosx -1 \).

Again, substitute cosx = 2cos^2(x/2) -1:

\( f(x) = -2cos(x/2) + 2(2cos^2(x/2) -1) -1 \).

Simplify:

\( f(x) = -2cos(x/2) + 4cos^2(x/2) -2 -1 \).

Combine like terms:

\( f(x) = 4cos^2(x/2) -2cos(x/2) -3 \).

Let me denote y = cos(x/2). Then, f(y) = 4y^2 -2y -3.

In this interval, x ∈ [pi, 4pi/3], so x/2 ∈ [pi/2, 2pi/3], so y = cos(x/2) ∈ [-1/2, 0]. Therefore, y ∈ [-1/2, 0].

Thus, f(y) = 4y^2 -2y -3.

This is a quadratic function opening upwards (since coefficient of y^2 is positive). The vertex is at y = -b/(2a) = 2/(8) = 1/4. But y is in [-1/2, 0], so the maximum is at the endpoints.

Compute f(-1/2):

\( 4*(-1/2)^2 -2*(-1/2) -3 = 4*(1/4) +1 -3 = 1 +1 -3 = -1 \).

Compute f(0):

\( 4*(0)^2 -2*(0) -3 = -3 \).

So, on this interval, the maximum is at y = -1/2, which is -1, but that's negative, so the maximum is at y = -1/2, which is -1, but since we are looking for maximum, and the function is going from -1 to -3, the maximum is at y = -1/2, which is -1.

Wait, but since we're looking for maximum, which is highest, but in this interval, the function is decreasing from y = -1/2 to y = 0, so the maximum is at y = -1/2, which is -1.

So, the maximum in this interval is -1.

But since we're looking for the maximum of the expression, which is positive, this interval doesn't contribute to a higher value.

**Interval 5: [4pi/3, 5pi/3]**

In this interval, \( cosx < 1/2 \), so \( |2cosx -1| = 1 - 2cosx \).

Also, x ∈ [4pi/3, 5pi/3], so x/2 ∈ [2pi/3, 5pi/6]. Therefore, cos(x/2) ∈ [-sqrt(3)/2, -1/2]. So, |cos(x/2)| = |negative| = positive, so |cos(x/2)| = -cos(x/2).

Thus, f(x) = 2*(-cos(x/2)) + 1 - 2cosx.

Simplify:

\( f(x) = -2cos(x/2) + 1 - 2cosx \).

Again, substitute cosx = 2cos^2(x/2) -1:

\( f(x) = -2cos(x/2) +1 -2(2cos^2(x/2) -1) \).

Simplify:

\( f(x) = -2cos(x/2) +1 -4cos^2(x/2) +2 \).

Combine like terms:

\( f(x) = -4cos^2(x/2) -2cos(x/2) +3 \).

Let me denote y = cos(x/2), then f(y) = -4y^2 -2y +3.

This is a quadratic function opening downward (since the coefficient of y^2 is negative). The vertex is at y = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*(-4)) = -1/4.

But y = cos(x/2) in this interval is ∈ [-sqrt(3)/2, -1/2], so y ∈ [-0.866, -0.5].

Since the vertex is at y = -1/4, which is outside the interval [-0.866, -0.5], so the maximum on this interval occurs at one of the endpoints.

Compute f(-sqrt(3)/2):

But wait, y ∈ [-sqrt(3)/2, -1/2], so:

Compute f(-sqrt(3)/2):

\( -4*(-sqrt(3)/2)^2 -2*(-sqrt(3)/2) +3 = -4*(3/4) + sqrt(3) +3 = -3 + sqrt(3) +3 = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732 \).

Compute f(-1/2):

\( -4*(-1/2)^2 -2*(-1/2) +3 = -4*(1/4) +1 +3 = -1 +1 +3 = 3 \).

Therefore, on this interval, the maximum is 3 at y = -1/2.

So, the maximum in this interval is 3.

**Interval 6: [5pi/3, 2pi]**

In this interval, \( cosx >= 1/2 \), so \( |2cosx -1| = 2cosx -1 \).

Also, x ∈ [5pi/3, 2pi], so x/2 ∈ [5pi/6, pi]. Therefore, cos(x/2) ∈ [-1, -sqrt(3)/2]. So, |cos(x/2)| = |cos(x/2)|, but since cos(x/2) is negative, |cos(x/2)| = -cos(x/2).

Thus, f(x) = 2*(-cos(x/2)) + 2cosx -1.

Simplify:

\( f(x) = -2cos(x/2) + 2cosx -1 \).

Again, substitute cosx = 2cos^2(x/2) -1:

\( f(x) = -2cos(x/2) + 2(2cos^2(x/2) -1) -1 \).

Simplify:

\( f(x) = -2cos(x/2) + 4cos^2(x/2) -2 -1 \).

Combine like terms:

\( f(x) = 4cos^2(x/2) -2cos(x/2) -3 \).

Let me denote y = cos(x/2). Then, f(y) =4y^2 -2y -3.

In this interval, x ∈ [5pi/3, 2pi], so x/2 ∈ [5pi/6, pi]. Therefore, y = cos(x/2) ∈ [-1, -sqrt(3)/2]. So, y ∈ [-1, -sqrt(3)/2].

Thus, f(y) =4y^2 -2y -3, which is a quadratic opening upwards (since coefficient of y^2 is positive). The vertex is at y = -b/(2a) = 2/(8) = 1/4, which is positive, outside the interval [-1, -sqrt(3)/2]. Therefore, the maximum occurs at the endpoints.

Compute f(-1):

\( 4*(-1)^2 -2*(-1) -3 = 4 + 2 -3 = 3 \).

Compute f(-sqrt(3)/2):

\( 4*(-sqrt(3)/2)^2 -2*(-sqrt(3)/2) -3 = 4*(3/4) + sqrt(3) -3 = 3 + sqrt(3) -3 = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732 \).

Therefore, on this interval, the maximum is 3 at y = -1.

So, summarizing all intervals:

- Interval [0, pi/3]: Maximum value is sqrt(3) ≈1.732
- Interval [pi/3, 2pi/3]: Maximum value is 3
- Interval [2pi/3, pi]: Maximum value is 3.25
- Interval [pi, 4pi/3]: Maximum value is -1 (but we're interested in maxima)
- Interval [4pi/3, 5pi/3]: Maximum value is 3
- Interval [5pi/3, 2pi]: Maximum value is 3

Therefore, the overall maximum occurs in Interval 3: [2pi/3, pi], where the maximum is 3.25 or 13/4.

But wait, 3.25 is 13/4. Let me confirm:

- At y =1/4, which corresponds to x = 2 arccos(1/4) ≈ 2 * 1.318 = 2.636 radians ≈ 150 degrees, which is in [2pi/3, pi].

So, f(x) = -4*(1/4)^2 + 2*(1/4) + 3 = -4*(1/16) + 0.5 + 3 = -0.25 + 0.5 + 3 = 3.25.

So, that's correct.

Therefore, the maximum value of the expression is 13/4.

Wait, 13/4 is 3.25, which is higher than 3.

But let me think again. Is this achievable? Because in this interval, x is approaching pi/3 from above, but actually, x is in [2pi/3, pi], which is a different interval.

Wait, no, in the interval [2pi/3, pi], x is in [120 degrees, 180 degrees], so cosx decreases from -1/2 to -1, so |2cosx -1| = 2cosx -1.

But when x approaches pi, cosx approaches -1, so 2cosx -1 approaches -2 -1 = -3, but wait, |2cosx -1| is 2|cosx| -1, but no, because 2cosx -1 is negative in this interval.

Wait, hold on. In [2pi/3, pi], cosx is in [-1/2, -1]. So, 2cosx is in [-1, -2]. Therefore, 2cosx -1 is in [-3, -3], so |2cosx -1| = 3 - 2cosx.

Wait, that's a different expression.

Wait, earlier, I substituted |2cosx -1| as 1 - 2cosx in this interval, but actually, since 2cosx -1 is negative, |2cosx -1| = |negative| = 1 - 2cosx.

Wait, but 1 - 2cosx is positive, since cosx is negative.

Wait, so in this interval, |2cosx -1| = 1 - 2cosx.

Therefore, in this interval, f(x) = 2|cosx| + |2cosx -1|.

Given that |cosx| = -cosx in this interval, because cosx is negative.

So, f(x) = 2*(-cosx) + (1 - 2cosx) = -2cosx +1 -2cosx = 1 -4cosx.

Wait, that's a different expression.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, in the interval [2pi/3, pi], cosx is negative, so |cosx| = -cosx.

Similarly, 2cosx is negative, so |2cosx -1| = |negative -1| = |-something| = positive.

But since 2cosx is negative, 2cosx -1 is definitely negative because 2cosx is less than -1 in this interval (since cosx <= -1/2). So, |2cosx -1| = 1 - 2cosx.

Therefore, f(x) = 2|cosx| + |2cosx -1| = 2*(-cosx) + (1 - 2cosx) = -2cosx +1 -2cosx = 1 -4cosx.

Wait, so f(x) =1 -4cosx.

But in this interval, x ∈ [2pi/3, pi], so cosx ∈ [-1/2, -1].

Therefore, f(x) =1 -4cosx.

Wait, but cosx is in [-1/2, -1], so let's compute f(x):

f(x) =1 -4cosx.

At cosx = -1/2, f(x) =1 -4*(-1/2) =1 +2=3.

At cosx = -1, f(x)=1 -4*(-1)=1 +4=5.

Wait, but this contradicts earlier conclusion.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, earlier, when I substituted, I had:

f(x) =2|cosx| + |2cosx -1|.

But in this interval, |cosx| = -cosx, and |2cosx -1| =1 - 2cosx.

Thus, f(x)=2*(-cosx)+ (1 -2cosx)=1 -4cosx.

But in the previous substitution, I had:

f(x)=2|cosx| + |2cosx -1|, which in this interval, is 1 -4cosx.

But earlier, when I did the substitution, I had:

f(x)=2|cosx| + |2cosx -1| = 2|cosx| + |2cosx -1|.

But in this interval, |2cosx -1| =1 -2cosx, and |cosx| = -cosx, so f(x)=2*(-cosx) +1 -2cosx=1 -4cosx.

But when I computed f(x) earlier, I had a different expression.

Wait, perhaps I messed up earlier substitution.

Wait, going back.

Wait, the expression we're trying to maximize is |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2|.

Expressed in terms of x, where x is theta.

But when I did the substitution, I thought f(x) was 2|cos(x/2)| + |2cosx -1|.

But when x is in [2pi/3, pi], |cos(x/2)| = cos(x/2) because x/2 is in [pi/3, pi/2], so cos(x/2) is positive.

But |2cosx -1| =1 -2cosx because in this interval, cosx is negative, so 2cosx -1 is negative.

Therefore, f(x)=2cos(x/2) + (1 -2cosx).

But cosx = 2cos^2(x/2) -1, so 1 -2cosx = 1 -2*(2cos^2(x/2) -1)=1 -4cos^2(x/2) +2=3 -4cos^2(x/2).

Therefore, f(x)=2cos(x/2) +3 -4cos^2(x/2).

Let me denote y = cos(x/2), so f(y) =2y +3 -4y^2.

Which is a quadratic function in y.

It's easier to compute f(y):

f(y) = -4y^2 +2y +3.

We need to find its maximum for y ∈ [cos(pi/3), cos(2pi/3)] = [0.5, -0.5].

Wait, but wait, x ∈ [2pi/3, pi], so x/2 ∈ [pi/3, pi/2]. Therefore, y =cos(x/2) ∈ [sqrt(3)/2, 1/2], right? Wait, no.

Wait, cos(pi/3) = 0.5, cos(pi/2)=0. So, as x/2 increases from pi/3 to pi/2, y decreases from 0.5 to 0.

Therefore, y ∈ [0, 0.5].

Therefore, f(y) = -4y^2 +2y +3, with y ∈ [0, 0.5].

This is a quadratic function opening downward with vertex at y= 2/(2*(-4))= -1/4, outside the interval.

So, maximum occurs at the endpoints.

Compute f(0):

f(0)= -0 +0 +3=3.

Compute f(0.5):

f(0.5)= -4*(0.25) +2*(0.5) +3= -1 +1 +3=3.

So, in this interval, f(x)=1 -4cosx=1 -4*(-something). Wait, no, as per above, in this interval, f(x)=1 -4cosx.

Wait, but when x is in [2pi/3, pi], cosx is in [-1/2, -1], so 1 -4cosx is 1 -4*(-something), which is 1 +4|cosx|.

But f(x)=1 -4cosx is a linear function in cosx, which is negative.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to not substitute and just analyze f(x)=2|cosx| + |2cosx -1|.

In the interval [2pi/3, pi], |cosx|=-cosx, and |2cosx -1|=1 -2cosx.

Thus, f(x)=-2cosx +1 -2cosx=1 -4cosx.

That's correct.

But since cosx is negative in this interval, 1 -4cosx is 1 - (negative number), which is 1 + positive number, so f(x) is greater than 1.

But when cosx is -1/2, f(x)=1 -4*(-1/2)=1 +2=3.

When cosx=-1, f(x)=1 -4*(-1)=1 +4=5.

But wait, wait, in our earlier analysis, we considered f(x) as 1 -4cosx.

But when x approaches pi, cosx approaches -1, and thus f(x)=1 -4*(-1)=5.

Wait, but earlier, when I did the substitution, I thought that in this interval, f(x)=1 -4cosx, but then I thought that 1 -4cosx was 1 - (negative number), which is 1 + positive number.

But in that case, as x approaches pi, f(x) approaches 5.

But earlier, when I did interval substitution, I thought f(x)= -4cos^2(x/2) +2cos(x/2) +3, which is different.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because I used two different substitutions.

Wait, maybe I should not have confused myself, but just stick to the expression f(x)=2|cosx| + |2cosx -1|.

In the interval [2pi/3, pi], cosx is in [-1/2, -1], so |cosx|=-cosx, and |2cosx -1|=1 -2cosx.

Thus, f(x) = -2cosx +1 -2cosx=1 -4cosx.

Therefore, f(x)=1 -4cosx, which is a linear function in cosx, which is decreasing because the coefficient of cosx is negative.

Wait, but as x increases from 2pi/3 to pi, cosx decreases from -1/2 to -1, so -4cosx increases.

Therefore, f(x)=1 -4cosx is increasing as cosx decreases.

Therefore, the maximum occurs at the left endpoint x=2pi/3, which gives f(x)=1 -4*(-1/2)=1 +2=3, and the minimal occurs at x=pi, giving f(x)=1 -4*(-1)=1 +4=5.

Wait, that makes sense. So, in this interval, f(x) increases from 3 to 5 as x goes from 2pi/3 to pi.

But wait, earlier, in my initial interval analysis, I thought that f(x) had a maximum of 3.25, which is 13/4=3.25, but this analysis shows that in this interval, f(x) can reach up to 5.

Wait, that must mean I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, in the interval [2pi/3, pi], f(x) =1 -4cosx, which is increasing as cosx decreases. So, since cosx is decreasing from -1/2 to -1, f(x) is increasing from 1 -4*(-1/2)=1 +2=3 to 1 -4*(-1)=1 +4=5.

Therefore, in this interval, f(x) ranges from 3 to 5.

But earlier, when I considered the quadratic function f(y)= -4y^2 +2y +3 with y ∈ [0,0.5], I thought the maximum was 3.25, but in reality, since f(x)=1 -4cosx in this interval, which is a linear function, the maximum is at the right endpoint x=pi, which is 5.

Therefore, in this interval, the maximum is 5, achieved at x=pi.

But wait, but earlier, I thought in this interval, the maximum was 3.25, but that must have been a miscalculation.

So, in reality, in interval [2pi/3, pi], f(x) ranges from 3 to 5.

Therefore, the overall maximum is 5, achieved at x=pi.

But let's check the value at x=pi:

z = e^{i pi}= -1.

Compute |1 + z|=|1 -1|=0.

Compute |1 + z + z^2|=|1 -1 +1|=|1|=1.

So, |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2| =0 +1=1.

Wait, that's not 5. So, something is wrong here.

Wait, that can't be. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, if x=pi, then z=-1.

Compute |1 + z|=|1 -1|=0.

Compute |1 + z + z^2|=|1 -1 +1|=|1|=1.

So, total expression is 0 +1=1.

But that contradicts the earlier analysis.

Wait, so where is the mistake?

Wait, when I substituted f(x)=2|cosx| + |2cosx -1|, in the interval [2pi/3, pi], I found that f(x)=1 -4cosx.

But when I plug in x=pi, f(x)=1 -4*(-1)=5, but in reality, |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|=0 +1=1.

So, this suggests that my substitution is flawed.

Wait, perhaps the expression |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2| when z=-1 is |1 -1 +1|=1, which is correct.

But in the expression f(x)=2|cosx| + |2cosx -1|, when x=pi, cosx=-1, so f(x)=2*1 + | -2 -1|=2 +3=5.

But in reality, the expression is 0 +1=1.

So, this suggests that the substitution is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the substitution was wrong.

Wait, let me go back.

We had the expression:

|1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|.

We found that |1 + z|=2|cosx|, which is correct.

Then, |1 + z + z^2|=|2cosx -1|, which is correct.

But wait, in this case, when z=-1, |1 + z + z^2|=|1 -1 +1|=1, but according to the substitution, |2cosx -1|=|2*(-1) -1|=| -2 -1|=3.

But that contradicts.

Wait, perhaps the substitution is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps in the expression, |1 + z + z^2| is not simply |2cosx -1|?

Wait, no, earlier, I thought |1 + z + z^2|=|2cosx -1|, but when I checked, for x=pi/3, z=e^{i pi/3}, |1 + z + z^2|=0, which would require |2cos(pi/3) -1|=|2*(0.5) -1|=|1 -1|=0, which is correct.

Similarly, for x=0, z=1, |1 +1 +1|=3, and |2cos0 -1|=|2*1 -1|=1, which is not equal. So, that substitution was wrong.

Wait, so that was a mistake. So, I think I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, so the error was that in the expression |1 + z + z^2|, when I expressed it in terms of cosx, I used |2cosx -1|, but in reality, the expression is |1 + z + z^2|, which is |1 + e^{i x} + e^{i 2x}|, which is |1 + e^{i x} + e^{i 2x}|, which is |(e^{i 3x} -1)/(e^{i x} -1)|, but that might not help.

Wait, but in reality, when I expressed |1 + z + z^2| as |2cosx -1|, that was incorrect because for z=1, it's 3, which is not equal to |2*1 -1|=1.

Therefore, my substitution was wrong.

Hence, the mistake was in expressing |1 + z + z^2| as |2cosx -1|, which is not correct.

So, that was a wrong substitution, which led to incorrect results.

Therefore, I need to correct that.

So, the problem is that |1 + z + z^2| is not equal to |2cosx -1|, as it's not a simple linear expression.

Therefore, my earlier analysis was flawed.

So, in that case, I need to find a different approach.

Wait, so perhaps instead of trying to substitute, I can compute |1 + z + z^2| as |1 + e^{i x} + e^{i 2x}|.

Which is |1 + e^{i x} + e^{i 2x}|.

We can use the formula for the magnitude of a complex number.

Let me denote S =1 + e^{i x} + e^{i 2x}.

Compute |S|.

Alternatively, perhaps we can represent S as a geometric series.

Since S =1 + e^{i x} + e^{i 2x}, which is a geometric series with ratio e^{i x}, starting from n=0 to n=2, so sum is (1 - e^{i 3x})/(1 - e^{i x}), as I did earlier.

Therefore, S = (1 - e^{i 3x})/(1 - e^{i x}).

But then |S| = |(1 - e^{i 3x})| / |1 - e^{i x}|.

Which is what I had earlier.

So, |S| = |1 - e^{i 3x}| / |1 - e^{i x}|.

Which is equal to sqrt(2 - 2cos3x)/sqrt(2 - 2cosx) = sqrt( (1 - cos3x)/(1 - cosx) ).

But, 1 - cos3x = 2sin^2(3x/2), and 1 - cosx = 2sin^2(x/2). Therefore,

|S| = sqrt( (2sin^2(3x/2))/(2sin^2(x/2)) ) = |sin(3x/2)/sin(x/2)|.

Therefore, |1 + z + z^2| = |sin(3x/2)/sin(x/2)|.

Therefore, the original expression is |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2| = 2|cosx| + |sin(3x/2)/sin(x/2)|.

This is a significant simplification.

Therefore, the expression is f(x) = 2|cosx| + |sin(3x/2)/sin(x/2)|.

Now, sin(3x/2)/sin(x/2) can be simplified using trigonometric identities.

Note that sin(3x/2) = sin(x + x/2) = sinx cos(x/2) + cosx sin(x/2).

Therefore, sin(3x/2)/sin(x/2) = sinx cot(x/2) + cosx.

Therefore, |sin(3x/2)/sin(x/2)| = | sinx cot(x/2) + cosx |.

But cot(x/2) = cos(x/2)/sin(x/2), so:

sinx cot(x/2) + cosx = sinx*(cos(x/2)/sin(x/2)) + cosx.

Simplify sinx = 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2), so:

= 2sin(x/2)cos(x/2)*(cos(x/2)/sin(x/2)) + cosx

= 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx.

So, sin(3x/2)/sin(x/2) = 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx.

Therefore, |sin(3x/2)/sin(x/2)| = |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|.

Thus, f(x)=2|cosx| + |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|.

This is a significant simplification.

So, now, f(x)=2|cosx| + |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|.

Given that, we can represent f(x) as:

f(x)=2|cosx| + |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|.

But since we're dealing with x ∈ [0, 2pi], cosx is positive in [0, pi/2] and [3pi/2, 2pi], and negative in [pi/2, 3pi/2].

Therefore, we can split the analysis into three intervals:

1. [0, pi/2]: cosx is non-negative, so |cosx|=cosx. Also, in this interval, x/2 ∈ [0, pi/4], so cos(x/2) is positive.

2. [pi/2, 3pi/2]: cosx is non-positive, so |cosx|=-cosx. In this interval, x/2 ∈ [pi/4, 3pi/4], so cos(x/2) is non-negative but decreasing from sqrt(2)/2 to -sqrt(2)/2.

3. [3pi/2, 2pi]: cosx is non-negative again, so |cosx|=cosx. In this interval, x/2 ∈ [3pi/4, pi], so cos(x/2) is non-positive, but since we have |cos(x/2)|, but wait, no, |cos(x/2)| is always non-negative.

Wait, actually, 2cos^2(x/2) is always non-negative, so |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx| is equal to |non-negative + cosx|.

But in this interval, x ∈ [3pi/2, 2pi], so x/2 ∈ [3pi/4, pi], so cos(x/2) is negative or zero.

But 2cos^2(x/2) is non-negative, and cosx is non-negative.

So, the expression inside the absolute value is 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx, which is non-negative.

Therefore, in this interval, |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|=2cos^2(x/2) + cosx.

In summary, f(x) can be split into three intervals:

1. [0, pi/2]: f(x)=2cosx + |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|

But in this interval, cos(x/2) is positive, and cosx is positive, so 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx is positive.

Therefore, f(x)=2cosx + 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx=3cosx + 2cos^2(x/2).

2. [pi/2, 3pi/2]: f(x)=2*(-cosx) + |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|

But in this interval, cosx is non-positive, so |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|=2cos^2(x/2) + cosx, since 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx is non-negative.

Therefore, f(x)= -2cosx +2cos^2(x/2) + cosx= -cosx +2cos^2(x/2).

3. [3pi/2, 2pi]: f(x)=2cosx + |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|

In this interval, cosx is non-negative, and cos(x/2) is non-positive.

But 2cos^2(x/2) is non-negative, and cosx is non-negative, so 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx is non-negative.

Thus, |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|=2cos^2(x/2) + cosx.

Therefore, f(x)=2cosx +2cos^2(x/2) + cosx=3cosx +2cos^2(x/2).

Therefore, now, in each interval, we can represent f(x) as:

1. [0, pi/2]: f(x)=3cosx +2cos^2(x/2)

2. [pi/2, 3pi/2]: f(x)= -cosx +2cos^2(x/2)

3. [3pi/2, 2pi]: f(x)=3cosx +2cos^2(x/2)

So, now, let's analyze each interval.

First, interval [0, pi/2]:

f(x)=3cosx +2cos^2(x/2).

Let me write cosx=2cos^2(x/2) -1.

So, f(x)=3*(2cos^2(x/2) -1) +2cos^2(x/2)=6cos^2(x/2) -3 +2cos^2(x/2)=8cos^2(x/2)-3.

Let me denote y = cos(x/2), then f(y)=8y^2 -3.

Since x ∈ [0, pi/2], x/2 ∈ [0, pi/4], so y ∈ [sqrt(2)/2,1], since cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2≈0.707.

Therefore, y ∈ [sqrt(2)/2,1].

Now, f(y)=8y^2 -3.

Since y ∈ [sqrt(2)/2,1], f(y) is increasing in y because it's a quadratic function opening upwards.

Therefore, f(y) is minimized at y=sqrt(2)/2 and maximized at y=1.

Compute f(y) at endpoints:

At y=sqrt(2)/2: f(y)=8*(0.5) -3=4 -3=1.

At y=1: f(y)=8*1 -3=5.

Therefore, in this interval, f(x) ranges from1 to5.

Second, interval [pi/2, 3pi/2]:

f(x)= -cosx +2cos^2(x/2).

Express cosx in terms of x/2:

cosx=2cos^2(x/2) -1.

Therefore, f(x)= - (2cos^2(x/2)-1) +2cos^2(x/2)= -2cos^2(x/2)+1 +2cos^2(x/2)=1.

Wait, that's interesting.

Therefore, in this interval, f(x)=1.

Hence, the expression is constant at1 in this interval.

Third, interval [3pi/2, 2pi]:

f(x)=3cosx +2cos^2(x/2).

Similarly, express cosx=2cos^2(x/2)-1.

Thus, f(x)=3*(2cos^2(x/2)-1) +2cos^2(x/2)=6cos^2(x/2)-3 +2cos^2(x/2)=8cos^2(x/2)-3.

Let y=cos(x/2), then f(y)=8y^2 -3.

Now, x ∈ [3pi/2, 2pi], so x/2 ∈ [3pi/4, pi].

Therefore, cos(x/2) ∈ [-1, sqrt(2)/2].

But since we're dealing with f(y)=8y^2 -3, and y ∈ [-1, sqrt(2)/2].

Wait, but in this interval, y=cos(x/2) is negative in [3pi/4, pi], because x/2 ∈ [3pi/4, pi], cos(x/2) is negative.

But in f(y), we have 8y^2 -3, which is the same for positive and negative y.

Therefore, in this interval, f(y) is a quadratic function in |y|, so it's symmetric.

Therefore, f(y) is increasing in |y|, so it's minimized at the leftmost point y=-1 and maximized at y= sqrt(2)/2.

Compute f(y) at y=-1:

f(-1)=8*(1) -3=5.

Compute f(y) at y= sqrt(2)/2:

f(sqrt(2)/2)=8*(0.5) -3=4 -3=1.

Therefore, in this interval, f(x) ranges from1 to5.

Therefore, in the entire interval [0,2pi], the function f(x)=|1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2| is equal to:

- 1 in [pi/2, 3pi/2],

- 3cosx +2cos^2(x/2) in [0, pi/2] and [3pi/2, 2pi],

- 1 in [pi/2, 3pi/2].

But wait, in [0, pi/2], f(x)=8cos^2(x/2)-3, which ranges from1 to5.

Similarly, in [3pi/2, 2pi], f(x)=8cos^2(x/2)-3, which also ranges from1 to5.

Therefore, the overall maximum of f(x) is5, achieved when cos(x/2)=1 or cos(x/2)=-1.

But let me verify:

At x=0: f(x)=8*(1)^2 -3=5.

At x=pi: f(x)=8*(cos(pi/2))^2 -3=8*0 -3=-3, but that can't be.

Wait, no, in [0, pi/2], x ∈ [0, pi/2], so x/2 ∈ [0, pi/4].

At x=0, cos(x/2)=1, so f(x)=8*1 -3=5.

At x=pi/2, cos(x/2)=cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, so f(x)=8*(0.5) -3=4 -3=1.

Wait, so in [0, pi/2], f(x) ranges from1 to5.

Similarly, in [3pi/2, 2pi], x ∈ [3pi/2, 2pi], x/2 ∈ [3pi/4, pi].

At x=3pi/2, cos(x/2)=cos(3pi/4)=-sqrt(2)/2, so f(x)=8*(0.5) -3=1.

At x=2pi, cos(x/2)=cos(pi)=-1, so f(x)=8*1 -3=5.

So, yes, f(x)=5 at x=0 and x=2pi.

But wait, at x=0, z=1, and |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|=0 +1=1, which contradicts.

Wait, no, wait, earlier substitution gave f(x)= |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|.

But when x=0, z=1, so |1 +1|=2, and |1 +1 +1|=3, so the total is5.

But in my earlier analysis, I thought f(x)=5 in [0, pi/2].

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, hold on, in the interval [0, pi/2], f(x)=8cos^2(x/2)-3.

At x=0, cos(x/2)=1, so f(x)=8*1 -3=5.

But when x=0, z=1, so |1 + z|=2, and |1 + z + z^2|=3, so total is5.

But earlier, when I thought of f(x)=1 in [pi/2, 3pi/2], which is incorrect.

Wait, no, in [pi/2, 3pi/2], f(x)=1, but in reality, in that interval, f(x)=1 is incorrect.

Wait, hold on, no.

Wait, correction: in the interval [0, pi/2], f(x)=8cos^2(x/2)-3, which ranges from1 to5.

Similarly, in [3pi/2, 2pi], f(x)=8cos^2(x/2)-3, which ranges from1 to5.

But at x=0 and x=2pi, f(x)=5.

At x=pi, f(x)=1.

But when x=pi/2, f(x)=1.

Wait, but in the interval [0, pi/2], f(x) can go up to5.

But in reality, when x=0, z=1, and |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|=2 +3=5.

Similarly, when x=pi/2, z=e^{i pi/2}=i, |1 + i| + |1 + i + (-1)|=sqrt(2) +1≈2.414.

Wait, but according to f(x)=8cos^2(x/2)-3, at x=pi/2, f(x)=8*(cos(pi/4))^2 -3=8*(0.5) -3=1, which contradicts.

Wait, this suggests that my substitution was wrong.

Wait, but when x=pi/2, z=i, so |1 + z|=sqrt(2), |1 + z + z^2|=1, so total is sqrt(2)+1≈2.414.

But according to f(x)=8cos^2(x/2)-3, at x=pi/2, it's1.

Hence, my substitution must be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, original f(x)= |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|=2|cosx| + |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|.

But we expressed |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|=2cos^2(x/2) + cosx when in [0, pi/2] and [3pi/2, 2pi], and |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|= |negative + cosx|, which in [pi/2, 3pi/2], cosx is negative, so 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx is negative + negative= negative, so |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|= - (2cos^2(x/2) + cosx).

But earlier, when I did the substitution, I found that |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|=2cos^2(x/2) + cosx, which is incorrect.

Therefore, my mistake was in assuming that |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|=2cos^2(x/2) + cosx in the interval [pi/2, 3pi/2]. Instead, it's |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|=|2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|.

But since in this interval, 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx is negative, it's equal to -(2cos^2(x/2) + cosx).

Therefore, f(x)=2|cosx| + |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|=2|cosx| -2cos^2(x/2) -cosx.

But wait, in the interval [pi/2, 3pi/2], cosx is negative, so |cosx|=-cosx.

So, f(x)= -2cosx -2cos^2(x/2) -cosx= -3cosx -2cos^2(x/2).

But that's for [pi/2, 3pi/2].

Wait, but in this interval, we also have f(x)= -cosx +2cos^2(x/2).

Wait, but in this interval, why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, no, wait, if x ∈ [pi/2, 3pi/2], which is equivalent to x ∈ [pi/2, pi] ∪ [pi, 3pi/2].

In [pi/2, pi], cosx is negative, so |cosx|=-cosx.

In [pi, 3pi/2], cosx is negative, same.

But in this interval, we have f(x)= -2cosx -2cos^2(x/2) -cosx= -3cosx -2cos^2(x/2).

But also, in this interval, from the first analysis, f(x)= -cosx +2cos^2(x/2).

Therefore, -3cosx -2cos^2(x/2)= -cosx +2cos^2(x/2).

Which would imply that -3cosx -2cos^2(x/2)= -cosx +2cos^2(x/2).

But that's not possible unless cosx=0, which isn't the case here.

Therefore, this suggests that my initial substitution is incorrect.

Therefore, my mistake was in the step where I tried to express |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx| without considering the absolute value properly.

Therefore, I need to re-examine the step where I tried to express |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|.

Earlier, I made a mistake in assuming that |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|=2cos^2(x/2) + cosx, but actually, in the interval [pi/2, 3pi/2], 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx is negative, so the absolute value is the negative of that.

Therefore, f(x) in [pi/2, 3pi/2] is not simply -cosx +2cos^2(x/2), but rather something else.

Wait, maybe I should correctly compute |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx| in the interval [pi/2, 3pi/2].

In [pi/2, 3pi/2], x ∈ [pi/2, 3pi/2], so x/2 ∈ [pi/4, 3pi/4].

Thus, cos(x/2) ∈ [-sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2].

Therefore, 2cos^2(x/2)=2*(cos^2(x/2)).

But cos^2(x/2)= (1 + cosx)/2.

Therefore, 2cos^2(x/2)=1 + cosx.

Thus, 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx=1 + cosx + cosx=1 + 2cosx.

Therefore, |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|=|1 + 2cosx|.

But in [pi/2, 3pi/2], cosx ∈ [-1, 0].

Therefore, 1 +2cosx ∈ [1 -2,1 +0]=[-1,1].

Therefore, |1 + 2cosx|.

Thus, f(x)=|1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|=2|cosx| + |1 +2cosx|.

So, in [pi/2, 3pi/2], f(x)=2|cosx| + |1 +2cosx|.

But cosx is negative in [pi/2, 3pi/2], so |cosx|=-cosx.

Therefore, f(x)=-2cosx + |1 +2cosx|.

Now, in [pi/2, 3pi/2], cosx ∈ [-1,0].

Therefore, 1 +2cosx ∈ [1 -2,1 +0]=[-1,1].

Therefore, |1 +2cosx| is:

- If 1 +2cosx ≥0, that is, when cosx ≥ -0.5, then |1 +2cosx|=1 +2cosx.

- If 1 +2cosx <0, that is, when cosx < -0.5, then |1 +2cosx|= -1 -2cosx.

So, let's split [pi/2, 3pi/2] into two subintervals:

1. [pi/2, 2pi/3]: cosx ∈ [-sqrt(3)/2, -0.5].

2. [2pi/3, 3pi/2]: cosx ∈ [-0.5,0].

In the first subinterval, [pi/2, 2pi/3], cosx ∈ [-sqrt(3)/2, -0.5], so 1 +2cosx ∈ [1 +2*(-sqrt(3)/2),1 +2*(-0.5)]= [1 -sqrt(3),0], which is ≤0.

Therefore, |1 +2cosx|=-1 -2cosx.

In the second subinterval, [2pi/3, 3pi/2], cosx ∈ [-0.5,0], so 1 +2cosx ∈ [1 -1,1 +0]=[0,1], which is ≥0.

Therefore, |1 +2cosx|=1 +2cosx.

Therefore, in [pi/2, 2pi/3], f(x)=-2cosx -1 -2cosx= -2cosx -1 -2cosx= -4cosx -1.

In [2pi/3, 3pi/2], f(x)=-2cosx +1 +2cosx=1.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, let's redo:

In [pi/2, 2pi/3], f(x)= -2cosx + |1 +2cosx|.

Since |1 +2cosx|= -1 -2cosx,

f(x)= -2cosx -1 -2cosx= -4cosx -1.

In [2pi/3, 3pi/2], f(x)= -2cosx + |1 +2cosx|.

Since |1 +2cosx|=1 +2cosx,

f(x)= -2cosx +1 +2cosx=1.

Therefore, in [pi/2, 2pi/3], f(x)= -4cosx -1, which is decreasing from f(pi/2)= -4*(-1) -1=4 -1=3 to f(2pi/3)= -4*(-sqrt(3)/2) -1=2sqrt(3) -1≈3.464 -1≈2.464.

In [2pi/3, 3pi/2], f(x)=1.

Therefore, in [pi/2, 3pi/2], f(x) ranges from1 to2.464 at2pi/3, then back to1.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous result.

Wait, let me check x=pi.

At x=pi, cosx=-1, so f(x)= -4*(-1) -1=4 -1=3.

But when x=pi, f(x)=3.

But in [pi/2, 3pi/2], f(x)=1 for all x except at x=pi/2 and 3pi/2, where it's3.

Wait, seems inconsistent.

Wait, no, at x=pi/2, f(x)=3.

At x=pi, f(x)=3.

At x=3pi/2, f(x)=1.

Therefore, in [pi/2, 3pi/2], f(x) ranges from1 to3.

Wait, so perhaps my previous analysis is incorrect.

Wait, let me recompute.

In [pi/2, 2pi/3], f(x)= -4cosx -1.

At x=pi/2: cosx=0, so f(x)= -0 -1= -1, which is impossible.

Wait, no, in [pi/2, 2pi/3], x ∈ [pi/2, 2pi/3], which is in [pi/2, pi].

Wait, cosx is negative here.

Wait, cos(pi/2)=0, cos(pi)= -1, cos(2pi/3)= -0.5.

Therefore, in [pi/2, 2pi/3], cosx ∈ [0, -0.5].

Wait, no, from pi/2 to 2pi/3, x increases from pi/2≈1.57 to2pi/3≈2.09.

In this interval, cosx decreases from0 to -0.5.

So, cosx ∈ [-0.5,0].

Therefore, in [pi/2, 2pi/3], 1 +2cosx ∈ [1 +2*(-0.5),1 +2*0]= [0,1].

Thus, |1 +2cosx|=1 +2cosx when cosx ≥ -0.5.

Therefore, in [pi/2, 2pi/3], f(x)= -2cosx +1 +2cosx=1.

Similarly, in [2pi/3, 3pi/2], cosx ∈ [-0.5,0].

Thus, |1 +2cosx|=1 +2cosx.

Therefore, in [2pi/3, 3pi/2], f(x)= -2cosx +1 +2cosx=1.

Therefore, in [pi/2, 3pi/2], f(x)=1.

But at x=pi, f(x)=3.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, when x=pi, f(x)=3.

But according to the above, f(x)=1.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let's recompute.

f(x)= |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|.

At x=pi, z=e^{i pi}=-1.

So, |1 + (-1)|=0, |1 + (-1) +1|=1.

Thus, f(x)=0 +1=1.

But when x=pi, cosx=-1, so according to f(x)= -2cosx + |1 +2cosx|.

At x=pi, f(x)= -2*(-1) + |1 +2*(-1)|=2 +| -1 |=2 +1=3.

But in the analysis above, I thought f(x)=1.

Wait, no, when x=pi, in [pi/2, 3pi/2], f(x)=1, but according to the actual computation, f(x)=1.

But in reality, at x=pi, f(x)=1.

Wait, this is conflicting.

Wait, let me compute f(x)=|1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2| at x=pi.

z=e^{i pi}= -1.

|1 + z|=|1 -1|=0.

|1 + z + z^2|=|1 -1 +1|=|1|=1.

Therefore, f(x)=0 +1=1.

So, at x=pi, f(x)=1.

But according to the expression f(x)= -2cosx + |1 +2cosx|, at x=pi, f(x)=2 +1=3.

But that's incorrect, since f(x)=1.

Therefore, my mistake is in the substitution.

I think I incorrectly assumed that |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|=2cos^2(x/2) + cosx in the interval [pi/2, 3pi/2], but in reality, in this interval, 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx=1 +2cosx, which is negative.

Therefore, in [pi/2, 3pi/2], f(x)= -2cosx + |1 +2cosx|.

But in [pi/2, 2pi/3], |1 +2cosx|= -1 -2cosx.

In [2pi/3, 3pi/2], |1 +2cosx|=1 +2cosx.

Therefore, in [pi/2, 2pi/3], f(x)= -2cosx -1 -2cosx= -4cosx -1.

In [2pi/3, 3pi/2], f(x)= -2cosx +1 +2cosx=1.

But wait, at x=pi, which is in [2pi/3, 3pi/2], f(x)=1.

But at x=pi, f(x)=1.

But also, at x=pi/2, f(x)=3.

Wait, so in [pi/2, 2pi/3], f(x)= -4cosx -1.

Which is f(pi/2)= -4*0 -1= -1, which is impossible.

Therefore, my substitution is incorrect.

I think the confusion arises because of the incorrect substitution.

I need to correctly compute |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx| in [pi/2, 3pi/2].

In [pi/2, 3pi/2], 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx=1 +2cosx.

Which, as in [pi/2, 3pi/2], 1 +2cosx is in [1 -2,1 +0]=[-1,1].

Therefore, |1 +2cosx| is:

- If 1 +2cosx ≥0, that is, cosx ≥ -0.5, then |1 +2cosx|=1 +2cosx.

- If 1 +2cosx <0, that is, cosx < -0.5, then |1 +2cosx|= -1 -2cosx.

Therefore, in [pi/2, 2pi/3], cosx ∈ [-sqrt(3)/2, -0.5], so 1 +2cosx ∈ [1 -sqrt(3), 0].

Thus, |1 +2cosx|= -1 -2cosx.

In [2pi/3, 3pi/2], cosx ∈ [-0.5,0], so 1 +2cosx ∈ [0,1].

Therefore, |1 +2cosx|=1 +2cosx.

Thus, in [pi/2, 2pi/3], f(x)= -2cosx + (-1 -2cosx)= -4cosx -1.

In [2pi/3, 3pi/2], f(x)= -2cosx + (1 +2cosx)=1.

Therefore, in [pi/2, 2pi/3], f(x)= -4cosx -1, which is a decreasing function from -4*0 -1= -1 to -4*(-sqrt(3)/2) -1=2sqrt(3) -1≈3.464 -1≈2.464.

But since cosx is negative, -4cosx is positive, so f(x) is positive.

Wait, but at x=pi/2, f(x)= -4*0 -1= -1.

But f(x) is in [pi/2, 2pi/3], f(x)= -4cosx -1.

Wait, but f(x) is |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|, which is always non-negative.

Therefore, perhaps my substitution is wrong.

Wait, no, in [pi/2, 2pi/3], 1 + z + z^2=1 + e^{i pi} + e^{i 2pi/3}=1 -1 -0.5 +i sqrt(3)/2= -0.5 +i sqrt(3)/2, which has magnitude1.

Similarly, 1 + z=1 -1=0.

Thus, |1 + z|=0, |1 + z + z^2|=1, so f(x)=1.

But according to the expression, f(x)= -4cosx -1.

At x=pi/2, cosx=0, f(x)= -1, but actual f(x)=1.

Therefore, my substitution is incorrect.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in expressing |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|.

Let me re-examine.

Since in [pi/2, 3pi/2], 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx=1 +2cosx.

But for x ∈ [pi/2, 3pi/2], 1 +2cosx is negative.

Therefore, |1 +2cosx|= -1 -2cosx.

But in [pi/2, 3pi/2], f(x)= |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|=2|cosx| + |1 +2cosx|.

But |1 +2cosx|= -1 -2cosx.

Therefore, f(x)= -2cosx + (-1 -2cosx)= -4cosx -1.

But this result gives f(x)= -4cosx -1, which is negative in [pi/2, 2pi/3], but f(x) must be positive.

Therefore, I must have messed up the substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to take |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|=|1 +2cosx|.

But in [pi/2, 3pi/2], 1 +2cosx is negative, so |1 +2cosx|= -1 -2cosx.

But in [pi/2, 3pi/2], 2cos^2(x/2) + cosx=1 +2cosx.

Therefore, f(x)= |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|=2|cosx| + |1 +2cosx|.

But |1 +2cosx|= -1 -2cosx.

Therefore, f(x)=2|cosx| -1 -2cosx.

But in [pi/2, 3pi/2], cosx is negative.

Therefore, |cosx|= -cosx.

Therefore, f(x)=2*(-cosx) -1 -2cosx= -2cosx -1 -2cosx= -4cosx -1.

But f(x) is positive, so this suggests that -4cosx -1 ≥0.

Which implies cosx ≤ -1/4.

But in [pi/2,3pi/2], cosx is in [-1,0].

Therefore, for cosx ≤ -1/4, which corresponds to x ∈ [pi, 2pi/3], since cos(pi)= -1, cos(2pi/3)= -0.5.

Wait, but in [pi, 2pi/3], which is [pi, 2pi/3]?

Wait, no, [pi, 2pi/3] is not possible since pi >2pi/3.

Wait, in [pi, 3pi/2], cosx decreases from -1 to0.

Therefore, cosx ≤ -1/4 occurs when x ∈ [pi, arccos(-1/4)].

Which is x ∈ [pi, arccos(-0.25)]≈[pi, 1.823].

But [pi,3pi/2] is about [3.1416,4.712], so the overlap is [pi, arccos(-0.25)]≈[3.1416, 1.892], which is impossible.

Wait, no, arccos(-0.25)≈1.823, which is less than pi≈3.1416.

Therefore, in [pi,3pi/2], cosx ≤ -0.25 is only at x=pi, where cosx=-1.

Therefore, in [pi,3pi/2], the condition cosx ≤ -1/4 is only at x=pi.

Therefore, f(x)= -4cosx -1 is positive only at x=pi.

But in other points, it's negative.

Therefore, this suggests that my substitution is wrong.

Therefore, I think I need to abandon this approach.

Given the time I've spent without a clear path, perhaps the maximum occurs at x=0, giving |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|=5.

But in other points, like x=pi, f(x)=1, which is less than5.

Wait, but in my initial analysis, I thought the maximum is5, but in the substitution, I found that f(x) is5 in [0, pi/2], and1 in other intervals.

But when I think of x=0, z=1, |1 + z|=0, |1 + z + z^2|=1, so total is1, but I thought earlier it's5.

Wait, no, at x=0, z=e^{i0}=1, so |1 + z|=2, |1 + z + z^2|=3.

So, total is5, but according to substitution, f(x)=5 only in [0, pi/2].

But when x=pi/2, f(x)=3, which is less than5.

Therefore, the maximum is5.

But wait, when x=0, z=1, which gives |1 +1| + |1 +1 +1|=2 +3=5.

But when x=pi/2, z=-1, which gives |1 -1| + |1 -1 +1|=0 +1=1.

When x=pi, z=-1, which gives |1 -1| + |1 -1 +1|=0 +1=1.

When x=3pi/2, z=i, which gives |1 +i| + |1 +i -1|=sqrt(2) +1≈2.414.

So, the maximum of5 occurs at x=0.

But wait, but x=0 is allowed.

But is x=0 allowed?

Yes, as x is defined as0 ≤x ≤2pi.

Therefore, the maximum is5, achieved atx=0.

But when I thought about the function, I thought maybe the maximum is higher.

But given all the computations, the maximum is5.

Wait, but I thought the maximum is higher, like sqrt(2)+2.

But sqrt(2)+2≈3.414, which is less than5.

Therefore, the maximum is5.

But I thought earlier when I went through the steps, I thought the maximum was5, but when I considered other points, I thought it could be higher.

But according to the function and all the steps,5 is the maximum.

Wait, but when I computed f(x) in [0, pi/2], it went from5 down to1, and in [pi/2, 3pi/2], it went from1 down to1, and in [3pi/2,2pi], it went from1 up to5.

Wait, no, in [3pi/2,2pi], x=2pi, f(x)=1.

But at x=3pi/2, z=i, f(x)=sqrt(2)+1.

But at x=2pi, f(x)=1.

But in between, at x=7pi/4, which is in [3pi/2,2pi], f(x)=1.

So, the maximum is5.

Therefore, the answer is5.

But wait, in the initial problem statement, the expression is |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|, where z=e^{i x}.

But from substitution, f(x)= |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|=2|cosx| + |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|.

So, the maximum is5, achieved when x=0.

Therefore, the answer is5.

But I thought earlier that the maximum was sqrt(2) +2, but that was incorrect.

Wait, but in the initial steps, I thought of the expression as |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|, and thought that maybe the maximum is sqrt(2) +2, but that was incorrect.

Therefore, after a lot of thinking, the maximum is5.

But wait, when x=0, z=1, which is outside the unit circle, but |z| is1, so it's allowed.

So, the final answer is5.

Wait, but when I considered x=pi, z=-1, which is inside the unit circle.

At x=pi, |1 + z|=0, |1 + z + z^2|=1, so sum is1.

But according to the substitution, in [0, pi/2], f(x)=5.

Wait, but according to the analysis, f(x)=5 in [0, pi/2], and1 elsewhere.

So, yes, maximum is5.

Therefore, after all this, the maximum is5.

But in the problem statement, it's given as a competition problem, so maybe the answer is5.

But I think I made a mistake in the substitution step.

Wait, wait, let me think again.

Earlier, I thought that f(x)=|1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|=2|cosx| + |2cos^2(x/2) + cosx|.

But when z is on the unit circle, |1 + z| is between0 and2, and |1 + z + z^2| is between0 and2.

But the maximum of the sum is when both |1 + z| and |1 + z + z^2| are maximized.

But the maximum of |1 + z| is2, achieved at z=-1.

Similarly, the maximum of |1 + z + z^2| is2, achieved at z=-1.

But when z=-1, both are2.

But z=-1 occurs at x=pi.

Therefore, the sum is4.

But when z=1, |1 + z|=2, |1 + z + z^2|=3, sum=5.

So, the maximum is5.

Therefore, the maximum is5, achieved atx=0.

Therefore, the answer is5.

But, wait, but in the initial steps, I thought the maximum was sqrt(2) +2≈3.414.

But that was incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is5.

But, wait, let me check another point.

At x=pi/3, which is30 degrees, cosx=0.5.

f(x)=2|0.5| + |2*(0.5)^2 +0.5|=1 + |0.5 +0.5|=1 +1=2.

So, less than5.

At x=pi/4, cosx≈0.707.

f(x)=2*0.707 + |2*(0.5) +0.707|=1.414 + |1 +0.707|=1.414 +1.707≈3.121.

Still less than5.

At x=pi/6, cosx≈0.866.

f(x)=2*0.866 + |2*(0.75) +0.866|=1.732 + |1.5 +0.866|=1.732 +2.366≈4.1.

Less than5.

At x=0, f(x)=5.

Therefore, yes, the maximum is5, achieved atx=0.

Therefore, the answer is5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5}
</think>

To find the maximum value of the expression \(|1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|\) where \(z = e^{ix}\) and \(0 \leq x \leq 2\pi\), we start by expressing each term in terms of trigonometric functions.

1. Express \(z\) as \(e^{ix} = \cos{x} + i\sin{x}\).
2. Calculate \(|1 + z|\):
   \[
   |1 + z| = \sqrt{(1 + \cos{x})^2 + (\sin{x})^2} = \sqrt{2(1 + \cos{x})} = 2|\cos{x/2}|
   \]
3. Calculate \(|1 + z + z^2|\):
   \[
   |1 + z + z^2| = \sqrt{(1 + \cos{x} + \cos{2x})^2 + (\sin{x} + \sin{2x})^2}
   \]
   Simplifying this expression, we find:
   \[
   |1 + z + z^2| = \sqrt{2(1 + 2\cos{x} + \cos{2x})} = 2|\cos{x/2 + \pi/3}|
   \]

4. Combine the results:
   \[
   |1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2| = 2|\cos{x/2}| + 2|\cos{x/2 + \pi/3}|
   \]

5. Analyze the function \(f(x) = 2|\cos{x/2}| + 2|\cos{x/2 + \pi/3}|\) over the interval \(0 \leq x \leq 2\pi\).

6. Consider key points and intervals:
   - At \(x = 0\), \(f(x) = 5\).
   - At \(x = \pi\), \(f(x) = 1\).
   - At \(x = \pi/2\), \(f(x) = 3\).
   - At \(x = 3\pi/2\), \(f(x) = 1\).

7. Determine the maximum value:
   - The function \(f(x)\) is maximized at \(x = 0\) where \(f(x) = 5\).

Thus, the maximum value of the expression \(|1 + z| + |1 + z + z^2|\) is \(\boxed{5}\).
