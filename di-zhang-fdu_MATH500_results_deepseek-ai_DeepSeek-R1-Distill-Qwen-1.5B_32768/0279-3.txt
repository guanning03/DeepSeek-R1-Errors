Question:
What is the sum of all of the multiples of 7 between 100 and 200?

Correct Answer:
The smallest multiple of 7 between 100 and 200 is 105, and the largest multiple is 196.  Thus, we want to find the sum of the arithmetic series $105 + 112 + \dots + 196$.

The $n^{\text{th}}$ term in this arithmetic sequence is $105 + 7(n - 1) = 7n + 98$.  If $7n + 98 = 196$, then $n = 14$, so the number of terms in this sequence is 14.

The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(105 + 196)/2 \cdot 14 = \boxed{2107}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all the multiples of 7 between 100 and 200. Hmm, let's see. First, I should figure out what the first multiple of 7 is that's greater than or equal to 100. And then, the last multiple of 7 less than or equal to 200. Once I have those two numbers, I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the total sum.

Alright, starting with the first multiple of 7 that's 100 or more. I know that 7 times 14 is 98, which is below 100, so I need to go higher. Let's calculate 7 multiplied by 15: 7*15 is 105. So, 105 is the first multiple of 7 after 100. Got that down.

Next, finding the last multiple of 7 that's 200 or less. Let me divide 200 by 7 to see how many times 7 fits into 200. 200 divided by 7 is approximately 28.571. Hmm, since we can't have a fraction of a multiple, I'll take the integer part, which is 28. So, 7*28 is 196. That's the last multiple of 7 before 200. Perfect.

Now, I need to find the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is 105, the last term is 196, and the common difference is 7. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. But wait, I don't know n yet. I need to figure out how many terms there are between 105 and 196, inclusive, stepping by 7 each time.

To find n, I can use the formula: n = ((an - a1)/d) + 1. Let's plug in the numbers. So, an is 196, a1 is 105, and d is 7. That gives us (196 - 105)/7 + 1. Calculating 196 - 105 is 91. Then, 91 divided by 7 is 13. Adding 1 gives us 14. So, there are 14 terms in this sequence.

Now, plugging back into the sum formula: S = 14/2 * (105 + 196). Let's compute that. 14 divided by 2 is 7. Then, 105 plus 196 is 201. So, 7 multiplied by 201 is... let me do that. 7 times 200 is 1400, and 7 times 1 is 7, so 1400 + 7 is 1407. So, the sum should be 1407.

Wait, let me verify that. Sometimes, when I do arithmetic in my head, I might make a mistake. Let me break it down again. The first term is 105, the last term is 196. The number of terms is 14, so the average of the first and last term is (105 + 196)/2, which is 201/2, which is 100.5. Then, 14 times 100.5 is... 14*100 is 1400, and 14*0.5 is 7, so 1400 + 7 is 1407. Yep, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach it by finding the sum from 1 to 200 and then subtracting the sum from 1 to 104. But that might be more complicated because I have to compute more terms. Let me see.

The sum of the first n multiples of 7 is 7 times the sum of the first n natural numbers. So, sum = 7*(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) = 7*(n(n + 1)/2). But I don't know n. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is probably easier.

But just for thoroughness, let's try this method. First, find the number of multiples of 7 between 1 and 200. As we did earlier, 200 divided by 7 is approximately 28.571, so 28 multiples. Similarly, the number of multiples of 7 between 1 and 104: 104 divided by 7 is approximately 14.857, so 14 multiples. Therefore, the number of multiples between 105 and 196 is 28 - 14 = 14, which matches our earlier count. So, the sum from 1 to 200 is 7*(28*29)/2 = 7*406 = 2842. The sum from 1 to 104 is 7*(14*15)/2 = 7*105 = 735. So, the sum from 105 to 196 is 2842 - 735 = 2107. Wait, that's different from my earlier result of 1407. Hmm, so I must have messed up somewhere.

Hold on, why is there a discrepancy? Let's see. If the first multiple of 7 >=100 is 105, and the last multiple <=200 is 196. So, number of terms is 14. The sum should be 14/2*(105 + 196) = 7*201 = 1407.

But when I subtracted using the formula, I got 2107. That's a big difference. So, clearly, one of my methods is wrong. Let's figure out where.

Probably, the formula where I subtracted the sum from 1 to 104 isn't correct because when I subtract, it's not just subtracting up to 104, but actually, the multiples of 7 below 100. Wait, no, the sum from 1 to 104 is all multiples of 7 up to 104, which is 14 terms. But the sum from 1 to 196 is 28 terms, so if I subtract 7*(14*15)/2 from 7*(28*29)/2, I should get the sum from 105 to 196. Let me compute that.

Sum up to 200: 7*(28*29)/2 = 7*406 = 2842. Sum up to 104: 7*(14*15)/2 = 7*105 = 735. So, 2842 - 735 = 2107. But according to the other method, it's 1407. These can't both be correct. So, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I made an error in calculating the sum up to 104. Let's check that. Sum up to n multiples is 7*(n(n +1)/2). So, for 14 terms, sum is 7*(14*15)/2 = 7*105 = 735. That seems right. Sum up to 28 terms is 7*(28*29)/2 = 7*406 = 2842. So, 2842 - 735 is indeed 2107.

But according to the first method, it's 1407. So, why is there a difference? Oh, wait, perhaps I have an error in the number of terms? Let's check.

First multiple >=100: 105. Let's see how many multiples of 7 are between 100 and 200 inclusive. So, multiples are 105, 112, ..., 196. So, 105 is the first, then 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, 175, 182, 189, 196. Let's count them: 105 is first, 112 is second, 119 third, 126 fourth, 133 fifth, 140 sixth, 147 seventh, 154 eighth, 161 ninth, 168 tenth, 175 eleventh, 182 twelfth, 189 thirteenth, 196 fourteenth. So, 14 terms, which matches the earlier count.

So, if the sum is 1407, but the subtraction method gives 2107, which is 1407*1.5 or something. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So, maybe I messed up which numbers I'm subtracting.

Wait, hold on. The formula I used was the total sum up to the upper limit minus the sum up to the lower limit minus 1. But wait, the first multiple >=100 is 105, and the last multiple <=200 is 196. So, the sum from 105 to 196 is equal to the sum up to 196 minus the sum up to 104.

But wait, 104 is not a multiple of 7, so the sum up to 104 is actually the sum up to the last multiple of 7 before 104, which is 14*7=98. So, actually, the sum up to 104 is not 735, because 14*7=98, so the 14th multiple is 98. Then, 98 +7=105 is the 15th multiple. So, the sum up to 104 is actually the sum up to the 14th multiple, which is 98. So, in that case, sum up to 104 is 735, but that's incorrect because 104 is not a multiple of 7. So, maybe that's why.

Wait, so perhaps the formula is not directly applicable here because 104 is not a multiple of 7. Therefore, the sum up to 104 is not as straightforward. So, maybe the correct way is to calculate the sum up to 196, which is 28 terms, and subtract the sum up to 104, but since 104 isn't a multiple of 7, the sum up to 104 is the sum up to the last multiple of 7 before 104, which is 98. So, the sum up to 104 is the same as the sum up to 98. Since 98 is the 14th multiple, and the sum up to 98 is 7*(14*15)/2 = 7*105 = 735. Therefore, the sum from 105 to 196 is 2842 - 735 = 2107. But wait, that's different from the arithmetic series method which gave me 1407.

So, which one is correct? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sum up to 200. Let's recalculate that.

Sum up to n multiples: 7*(1 + 2 + ... +n) = 7*(n(n+1)/2). So, for n=28, it's 7*(28*29)/2 = 7*406 = 2842. Correct. For n=14, it's 7*(14*15)/2 = 7*105 = 735. Correct. So, 2842 - 735 is indeed 2107. So, why does the arithmetic series method give me 1407?

Wait, in the arithmetic series method, I counted 14 terms, and each term is an average of the first and last term, which is (105 + 196)/2 = 100.5. Then, 14*100.5 is 1407. So, that's correct. But the other method gives me 2107. So, which one is wrong?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I messed up the count of terms. Let me check how many multiples of 7 are between 100 and 200. Let's list them:

Starting from 105, then 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, 175, 182, 189, 196.

That's 14 terms. So, n=14. So, the sum should be 14/2*(105 + 196)=7*201=1407.

But according to the other method, it's 2107. So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula when I subtracted. The sum from 1 to 200 is 2842, and the sum up to 104 is 735, so 2842 - 735 is 2107, but that's incorrect because the sum up to 104 is not the same as the sum up to 98, which is 735. Because 104 is not a multiple of 7, so the sum up to 104 is equal to the sum up to 98 plus 105. So, sum up to 104 is sum up to 98 + 105. Sum up to 98 is 735, so sum up to 104 is 735 + 105 = 840. Therefore, the sum from 105 to 196 is sum up to 196 (2842) minus sum up to 104 (840) = 2842 - 840 = 2002. Hmm, that's different.

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me recast this.

Sum from 105 to 196 is equal to sum from 1 to 196 minus sum from 1 to 104.

But sum from 1 to 196 is 2842.

Sum from 1 to 104: Since 104 isn't a multiple of 7, it's equal to sum from 1 to 98 (which is 735) plus 105. Because 104 = 98 + 6, so 105 is the next multiple. So, sum up to 104 is 735 + 105 = 840.

So, sum from 105 to 196 is 2842 - 840 = 2002.

Wait, but that conflicts with the arithmetic series sum. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. The formula for the sum from a to b is sum up to b minus sum up to a-1. So, if I want the sum from 105 to 196, that's sum up to 196 minus sum up to 104. But since 104 is not a multiple of 7, sum up to 104 is sum up to 98 plus 105.

Sum up to 98 is 735, and 105 is the next multiple, so sum up to 104 is 735 + 105 = 840.

Therefore, sum from 105 to 196 is 2842 - 840 = 2002.

Wait, so 2002 is the correct answer? But then, why does the arithmetic series method give me 1407? There must be a mistake in my arithmetic series method.

Wait, let's recast that. If I have 14 terms, starting at 105 and ending at 196, each term is 7 apart. So, the average term is (105 + 196)/2 = 100.5. Then, 14 terms, so 14*100.5=1407. That's correct. So, why is the other method giving 2002?

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up in calculating the sum up to 104. Let me recalculate that. The sum up to 104 is not 735, because 104 isn't a multiple of 7. So, the sum up to 104 is actually equal to sum up to 98 (which is 735) plus the next multiple of 7 after 98, which is 105. So, 735 + 105 is 840. So, sum up to 104 is 840.

Therefore, sum from 105 to 196 is 2842 - 840 = 2002. But that's conflicting with the arithmetic series sum.

Wait, 2002 vs 1407. Which one is correct? Let me do a smaller example to check.

Suppose I want the sum from 10 to 14 inclusive. So, multiples of 7 between 10 and 14 is 14. So, sum is 14.

Using the formula: first term 14, last term 14, number of terms 1. Sum is 14.

Using the other method: sum up to 14 is 14, sum up to 13 is sum up to 9 (which is 0) + 10, 11, 12, 13. Wait, maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that when subtracting, I need to add back the first multiple which is 105. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, maybe the problem is in the initial count. Let's list the multiples of 7 between 100 and 200.

Starting from 105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, 175, 182, 189, 196. So, 14 terms.

Their sum is 105 + 112 + 119 + 126 + 133 + 140 + 147 + 154 + 161 + 168 + 175 + 182 + 189 + 196.

Let me add them step by step:

105 + 112 = 217

217 + 119 = 336

336 + 126 = 462

462 + 133 = 595

595 + 140 = 735

735 + 147 = 882

882 + 154 = 1036

1036 + 161 = 1197

1197 + 168 = 1365

1365 + 175 = 1540

1540 + 182 = 1722

1722 + 189 = 1911

1911 + 196 = 2107.

Wait, so adding them step by step, I get 2107. But according to the arithmetic series formula, it's 1407. So, which one is correct?

Wait, 2107 is the correct sum because I just added them up. So, maybe my other method is wrong.

Wait, why? I thought it was 2842 - 840 = 2002, but adding the terms step by step, I get 2107. There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, let me see. The formula says sum up to 200 is 2842, sum up to 104 is 840, so 2842 - 840 is 2002. But adding all the terms, we get 2107. So, 2002 vs 2107. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the sum up to 104.

Wait, sum up to 104 is sum up to 98 plus 105. Sum up to 98 is 735, so 735 + 105 = 840. So, sum up to 104 is 840. Then, sum from 105 to 196 is 2842 - 840 = 2002.

But when I added the terms, I got 2107. So, which one is correct? There must be an error in the reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect because 104 is not a multiple of 7, so sum up to 104 is equal to sum up to 98 plus 105, but the formula assumes that the sum up to 104 is equal to sum up to 100 + 101 + ... + 104. But 104 is not a multiple of 7, so the sum up to 104 is actually equal to sum up to 98 plus 105.

Wait, let me verify the formula. The sum up to n is 7*(n(n+1)/2). However, if n isn't a multiple of 7, then the sum up to n is equal to sum up to the previous multiple of 7 plus the next multiple. So, for n=104, the previous multiple is 98, and the next multiple is 105. So, sum up to 104 is 735 + 105 = 840. So, that is correct.

Then, sum from 105 to 196 is 2842 - 840 = 2002. But when I manually added them, I got 2107. So, that suggests that the arithmetic series formula is not giving me the correct result.

Wait, perhaps I added them incorrectly. Let me check the addition again.

Starting with 105: 105

Plus 112: 105 + 112 = 217

Plus 119: 217 + 119 = 336

Plus 126: 336 + 126 = 462

Plus 133: 462 + 133 = 595

Plus 140: 595 + 140 = 735

Plus 147: 735 + 147 = 882

Plus 154: 882 + 154 = 1036

Plus 161: 1036 + 161 = 1197

Plus 168: 1197 + 168 = 1365

Plus 175: 1365 + 175 = 1540

Plus 182: 1540 + 182 = 1722

Plus 189: 1722 + 189 = 1911

Plus 196: 1911 + 196 = 2107

So, adding them step by step gives 2107, but the formula says 2002. So, this is a problem. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect because the number of terms is 14, but the difference between 105 and 196 is 91, which is 13*7, so 14 terms. So, 14 terms, each 7 apart. So, arithmetic series formula should be correct.

Wait, but the step-by-step addition is 2107, whereas the formula says 2002. So, there must be an error in my step-by-step addition.

Wait, let me check each addition:

105 + 112: 105 + 100 + 12 = 205 +12=217. Correct.

217 +119: 217 + 110=327 +9=336. Correct.

336 +126: 336 + 120=456 +6=462. Correct.

462 +133: 462 +130=592 +3=595. Correct.

595 +140: 595 +140=735. Correct.

735 +147: 735 +140=875 +7=882. Correct.

882 +154: 882 +150=1032 +4=1036. Correct.

1036 +161: 1036 +160=1196 +1=1197. Correct.

1197 +168: 1197 +160=1357 +8=1365. Correct.

1365 +175: 1365 +170=1535 +5=1540. Correct.

1540 +182: 1540 +180=1720 +2=1722. Correct.

1722 +189: 1722 +180=1902 +9=1911. Correct.

1911 +196: 1911 +190=2101 +6=2107. Correct.

So, all the additions are correct. So, 2107 is the correct sum.

Therefore, my initial calculation using the arithmetic series formula was wrong, perhaps because it didn't consider the exact number of terms or the starting point.

Wait, let me try again with the arithmetic series formula. The first term is 105, last term is 196, number of terms is 14.

So, sum is 14/2*(105 + 196) = 7*(201) = 1407. But that's conflicting with the step-by-step addition.

Wait, perhaps I need to double-check the number of terms. Let me count them again: 105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, 175, 182, 189, 196. That's 14 terms.

Wait, let me calculate 105 + (n-1)*7 = 196. So, 105 +7(n-1)=196. Subtract 105: 7(n-1)=91. So, n-1=13. So, n=14. Correct.

So, 14 terms. So, the arithmetic series formula is correct. Hmm.

Wait, but when I added them step by step, I got 2107. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, the formula is (first + last)/2 * number of terms. So, (105 + 196)/2 = 201/2 = 100.5. 14*100.5=1407. So, 1407 is correct.

But my manual addition is 2107. So, which is correct? Maybe I made a mistake in the step-by-step addition.

Wait, let me do it again:

105 +112=217

217 +119=336

336 +126=462

462 +133=595

595 +140=735

735 +147=882

882 +154=1036

1036 +161=1197

1197 +168=1365

1365 +175=1540

1540 +182=1722

1722 +189=1911

1911 +196=2107

All right, that's correct. So, the step-by-step addition is correct, and therefore, the arithmetic series formula is wrong. So, why is that?

Wait, maybe I messed up the number of terms. Let me count again: 105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, 175, 182, 189, 196. So, that's 14 terms. So, n=14.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is wrong because the sum from a to b inclusive is (b - a)/d * (a + b). Hmm, that's another way to write it. So, (196 - 105)/7 = 91/7=13. Then, 13*(105 +196)=13*201=2613. That's way too big, so that can't be.

Wait, no, that's not correct because that would be the number of intervals multiplied by the average. But in the formula, it's (last - first)/d * (first + last). So, (196 - 105)/7 =13. So, 13*201=2613. But that's not the sum of the terms, it's the sum of the intervals, which is different.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula. Let me check: The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms)/2*(first term + last term). So, that's correct. So, maybe the issue is in the step-by-step addition? Wait, no, that's correct too. 2107 is the correct sum.

Wait, so why does the arithmetic series formula give me 1407? Because perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms.

Wait, let's check: from 105 to 196, step of 7. The number of terms is ((196 -105)/7) +1 = (91/7)+1=13+1=14. So, n=14. So, 14 terms.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when I subtract the sum up to 104, which is 840, from sum up to 200, which is 2842, I get 2002. But the step-by-step addition is 2107. So, which is correct?

Wait, 2002 vs 2107. Let me check the arithmetic series formula again.

First term:105, last term:196, number of terms:14.

Sum=14/2*(105 +196)=7*201=1407.

Wait, but that's different from the step-by-step addition.

Wait, maybe the problem is that 105 is not a multiple of 7 starting at 100?

Wait, wait, 105 is 15*7, so that's correct. 112 is 16*7, 119 is 17*7, etc. So, all the terms are multiples of 7.

Wait, unless I made a mistake in the step-by-step addition.

Wait, wait, let me try adding the terms in a different way.

105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, 175, 182, 189, 196.

Let me add them in pairs:

105 + 196 = 201

112 + 189 = 201

119 + 188? Wait, 188 isn't a term here.

Wait, no, 112 + 189 = 301

126 + 182 = 308

133 + 175 = 308

140 + 172? Wait, 172 isn't a term.

Wait, 140 + 168 = 308

154 + 161 = 315

161 + 154 = same as above.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, let's pair them as follows:

105 + 196 = 201

112 + 189 = 301

119 + 188? Wait, no, 188 isn't there. Wait, maybe:

112 + 189=301

126 + 182=308

133 + 175=308

140 + 172=312? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this method isn't helping.

Wait, maybe try to add them in another order.

Let me list them:

105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, 175, 182, 189, 196.

Let me add them in order: 105 + 112=217, 217 +119=336, 336 +126=462, 462 +133=595, 595 +140=735, 735 +147=882, 882 +154=1036, 1036 +161=1197, 1197 +168=1365, 1365 +175=1540, 1540 +182=1722, 1722 +189=1911, 1911 +196=2107.

Yes, same result. So, 2107 is correct.

Therefore, the arithmetic series formula must have a mistake. Wait, let me check the formula again.

Wait, the formula is (first + last)/2 * number of terms.

So, first term is 105, last term is 196.

(105 + 196)/2 = 201/2 = 100.5.

Number of terms is 14.

So, 14 * 100.5 = 1407.

Wait, but 1407 doesn't match the step-by-step addition. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but the number of terms is wrong. Wait, let me compute the number of terms again.

From 100 to 200, multiples of 7.

n = ((200 -100)/7) +1 = (100/7) +1≈14.2857+1=15.2857. So, 15 terms? Wait, that can't be. 15 terms would mean up to 105, but 105 is 15th multiple.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, 100/7 is approximately 14.2857, so 15 multiples, starting from 7*15=105. So, number of terms is 15.

Wait, but when I added them, I got 14 terms. So, maybe that's where the confusion is.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the first multiple of 7 >=100 is 105, which is the 15th multiple. So, the number of terms is 15, not 14.

Wait, that can't be. Because 105 is the first multiple, then 112 is second, up to 196, which is 14th multiple.

Wait, 7*15=105, which is the first term. So, the number of terms is 15.

But earlier, I thought it's 14, because 100 to 200. But 105 is included. So, perhaps the number of terms is 15.

Wait, so if n=15, then the sum is (105 + 196)/2 *15= 201/2 *15=100.5*15=1507.5. Wait, that's not an integer, which doesn't make sense because sum is an integer.

Wait, something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the number of terms is 15, but the first multiple is 105, which is 15th term, but 105 is less than 100, so maybe the first multiple >=100 is 112, which is 16th term.

Wait, 7*16=112. So, the first multiple of 7 >=100 is 112, which is 16th term. Then, the last multiple of 7 <=200 is 196, which is 28th term. So, number of terms is 28 -16 +1=13 terms.

Wait, 28 -16 +1=13. So, 13 terms.

Wait, 112,119,...,196. So, let's check: 112 +7=119, +7=126, +7=133, +7=140, +7=147, +7=154, +7=161, +7=168, +7=175, +7=182, +7=189, +7=196. So, 13 terms.

So, if n=13, then sum is (112 +196)/2 *13= (308)/2 *13=154 *13=2002.

Ah! So, the number of terms is 13, not 14. Because 112 is the first multiple of 7 >=100, and 196 is the last multiple of 7 <=200.

So, n=13.

Therefore, the correct number of terms is 13.

Therefore, the sum is (112 +196)/2 *13=154*13=2002.

So, where did I go wrong earlier? I thought the number of terms was 14, but actually, the first term is 112, which is 16th term, so 16th to 28th term, which is 13 terms.

Therefore, the correct sum is 2002.

So, going back, the arithmetic series formula is correct, but I had to adjust the number of terms because the first multiple of 7 >=100 is 112, not 105.

So, in summary, the correct sum is 2002.

But wait, in the first approach, I thought the number of terms was 14, but actually, the number of terms is 13. So, the sum should be 2002.

Wait, but to confirm, let me compute the sum directly as 13 terms:

112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, 175, 182, 189, 196.

Let me add them step by step:

112 +119=231

231 +126=357

357 +133=490

490 +140=630

630 +147=777

777 +154=931

931 +161=1092

1092 +168=1260

1260 +175=1435

1435 +182=1617

1617 +189=1806

1806 +196=2002.

Yes, that's correct. So, the sum is 2002.

Earlier, I thought the number of terms was 14 because I thought 100 was a multiple of 7, but 100 isn't. So, the correct number of terms is 13.

Therefore, the correct sum is 2002.

So, the answer is 2002.

But wait, how did I get confused earlier? Because I thought that the first term is 105, which is a multiple of 7, but 105 is less than 100, so it's not included. Hence, the first multiple is 112, which is 16th term, and the last multiple is 196, which is 28th term, so 13 terms in total.

Therefore, the arithmetic series formula gives 2002, which is correct.

Hence, the sum of all multiples of 7 between 100 and 200 is 2002.

**Final Answer**
The sum of all multiples of 7 between 100 and 200 is \boxed{2002}.
</think>

To find the sum of all multiples of 7 between 100 and 200, we first determine the smallest and largest multiples of 7 in this range. The smallest multiple of 7 greater than or equal to 100 is 112, and the largest multiple of 7 less than or equal to 200 is 196.

Next, we find the number of terms in this sequence. The sequence is an arithmetic series with the first term \(a = 112\), the last term \(l = 196\), and the common difference \(d = 7\). The number of terms \(n\) is calculated as follows:

\[
n = \frac{(l - a)}{d} + 1 = \frac{(196 - 112)}{7} + 1 = \frac{84}{7} + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13
\]

Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series \(S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)\), we find the sum:

\[
S_{13} = \frac{13}{2} \times (112 + 196) = \frac{13}{2} \times 308 = 13 \times 154 = 2002
\]

Thus, the sum of all multiples of 7 between 100 and 200 is \boxed{2002}.
