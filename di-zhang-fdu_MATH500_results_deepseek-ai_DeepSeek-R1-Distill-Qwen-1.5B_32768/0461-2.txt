Correct Answer:
Let $\theta = \angle BAM.$  Then $\angle BDM = 3 \theta.$  Since $\angle BDM$ is external to triangle $ABD,$ $\angle BDM = \angle BAD + \angle ABD.$  Hence, $\angle ABD = \angle BDM - \angle BAD = 2 \theta.$

By the Law of Sines on triangle $ABD,$
\[\frac{BD}{\sin \theta} = \frac{AD}{\sin 2 \theta}.\]Then
\[\frac{BD}{\sin \theta} = \frac{10}{2 \sin \theta \cos \theta} = \frac{5}{\sin \theta \cos \theta},\]so $\cos \theta = \frac{5}{BD}.$

Then
\[AB = \frac{AM}{\cos \theta} = \frac{11}{5/BD} = \frac{11}{5} BD.\]By the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangles $AMB$ and $DMB,$
\begin{align*}
BM^2 + 11^2 &= AB^2, \\
BM^2 + 1^2 &= BD^2.
\end{align*}Subtracting these equations, we get
\[AB^2 - BD^2 = 120.\]Then
\[\frac{121}{25} BD^2 - BD^2 = 120,\]so $BD = \frac{5 \sqrt{5}}{2}.$  Then $AB = \frac{11 \sqrt{5}}{2},$ and $BM = \frac{11}{2}.$  Therefore, the perimeter of triangle $ABC$ is
\[AB + AC + BC = \frac{11}{2} \sqrt{5} + \frac{11}{2} \sqrt{5} + 11 = \boxed{11 \sqrt{5} + 11}.\]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have triangle ABC which is isosceles with AB equal to AC. So, that means triangle ABC has two equal sides, AB and AC, making it an isosceles triangle with base BC. The altitude from A to BC is given as AM, which is 11 units long. So, AM is perpendicular to BC and it splits BC into two equal parts since it's an altitude in an isosceles triangle. 

Then, there's a point D on AM such that AD is 10 units. Since AM is 11, that means DM must be 1 unit because 11 minus 10 is 1. So, D is very close to M, just 1 unit away from M.

The main condition given is that the angle BDC is three times the angle BAC. So, angle at D between points B, D, and C is three times the angle at A between points B, A, and C. 

We need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC. 

Alright, let me try to visualize the triangle. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, let me denote AB = AC = x, and BC = y. So, the sides AB and AC are equal, and BC is the base. The altitude AM splits BC into two equal parts, so BM = MC = y/2. 

Given that AM is 11, which is the altitude, so in triangle ABM, which is a right-angled triangle, we can apply Pythagoras theorem. So, AB squared equals AM squared plus BM squared. That is, x^2 = 11^2 + (y/2)^2. So, x^2 = 121 + (y^2)/4. That's one equation relating x and y.

Now, we have point D on AM such that AD = 10 and DM = 1. So, point D is 10 units above A, which is 1 unit below M. So, M is at 11 units from A, D is at 10 units, so 1 unit away from M. 

Now, the angles: angle BAC is the vertex angle at A, and angle BDC is the angle at D between points B, D, and C. The condition is that angle BDC is three times angle BAC. 

So, let's denote angle BAC as θ. Then, angle BDC is 3θ. 

We need to relate these angles. Since ABC is isosceles, angle BAC is at the top, and angles at B and C are equal. Let me denote angles at B and C as φ each. So, in triangle ABC, angles are θ at A and φ at B and C. 

Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have θ + 2φ = 180. So, φ = (180 - θ)/2. 

Now, angle BDC is 3θ. Let me think about triangle BDC. In triangle BDC, we have points B, D, and C. Since D is on AM, which is the altitude, and M is the midpoint of BC, so D is very close to M, only 1 unit away.

So, in triangle BDC, we can maybe apply the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines. Let me see.

First, let me try to find some lengths or relations.

Let me note coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates can help. Let's place point A at (0, 11), since AM is 11, and M is the midpoint of BC. So, if I set coordinate system with point A at (0,11), then BC is on the x-axis. So, point M is at (0,0), the midpoint of BC. Then, point B is at (-y/2, 0), and point C is at (y/2, 0). 

Point D is on AM, which is the line from A(0,11) to M(0,0). So, D is somewhere along the y-axis. Since AD = 10 and AM = 11, then D is at (0, 11 - 10) = (0,1). So, D is at (0,1). 

So, points:

A: (0,11)

B: (-y/2, 0)

C: (y/2, 0)

M: (0,0)

D: (0,1)

So, now, angle BAC is angle at A between AB and AC. Let me compute angle BAC. In coordinate terms, vector AB is from A to B: (-y/2, -11), and vector AC is (y/2, -11). So, angle BAC is the angle between vectors AB and AC.

Similarly, angle BDC is the angle at D between points B, D, and C. So, in coordinate terms, vectors DB and DC are from D(0,1) to B(-y/2, 0) and to C(y/2, 0). So, vector DB is (-y/2, -1) and vector DC is (y/2, -1). So, angle BDC is the angle between vectors DB and DC.

So, perhaps I can compute these angles using vectors and set up the equation that angle BDC = 3 angle BAC.

First, let me compute angle BAC. 

Vectors AB and AC are (-y/2, -11) and (y/2, -11). The angle between them can be found using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (AB . AC) / (|AB| |AC|)

Compute AB . AC:

(-y/2)(y/2) + (-11)(-11) = (-y²/4) + 121

|AB| = sqrt( (y/2)^2 + 11^2 ) = sqrt( y²/4 + 121 )

Similarly, |AC| is the same as |AB|, so sqrt( y²/4 + 121 )

Thus,

cos(theta) = [ -y²/4 + 121 ] / ( y²/4 + 121 )

Similarly, angle BDC is the angle between vectors DB and DC. Let's compute that.

Vectors DB and DC are (-y/2, -1) and (y/2, -1). The angle between them is angle BDC = 3θ.

Compute the dot product of DB and DC:

(-y/2)(y/2) + (-1)(-1) = (-y²/4) + 1

|DB| = sqrt( (y/2)^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt( y²/4 + 1 )

Similarly, |DC| is the same as |DB|, so sqrt( y²/4 + 1 )

So, cos(angle BDC) = [ (-y²/4) + 1 ] / ( y²/4 + 1 )

But angle BDC is 3θ, so cos(3θ) = [ (-y²/4) + 1 ] / ( y²/4 + 1 )

So, now we have expressions for cos(theta) and cos(3θ). Our goal is to find theta, and then relate it back to y, which will give us y in terms of x, and then we can compute the perimeter.

So, let's write down:

cos(theta) = (121 - y²/4) / (121 + y²/4)

Let me denote y² as some variable, say, let me set k = y². Then, cos(theta) = (121 - k/4) / (121 + k/4)

Similarly, cos(3θ) = (1 - k/4) / (1 + k/4)

So, now, we have an identity: cos(3θ) = 4cos³(theta) - 3cos(theta). 

That's the triple-angle formula. So, we can express cos(3θ) in terms of cos(theta). So, let's write that.

cos(3θ) = 4cos³(theta) - 3cos(theta)

But we also have cos(3θ) = (1 - k/4)/(1 + k/4)

So, substituting, we have:

4cos³(theta) - 3cos(theta) = (1 - k/4)/(1 + k/4)

But cos(theta) is (121 - k/4)/(121 + k/4). Let me denote that as C.

So, let me compute cos(3θ) in terms of C.

First, compute 4C³ - 3C.

C = (121 - k/4)/(121 + k/4)

Let me compute 4C³ - 3C.

But this might get messy. Maybe instead, express everything in terms of k.

Let me substitute C = (121 - k/4)/(121 + k/4). Let me compute 4C³ - 3C.

First, let me compute C:

C = (121 - k/4)/(121 + k/4)

Let me denote C = (a)/(a + b) where a = 121, b = k/4.

So, 4C³ - 3C.

Compute C³:

C³ = (a/(a + b))³ = a³ / (a + b)³

Similarly, 4C³ = 4a³ / (a + b)³

Similarly, 3C = 3a/(a + b)

So, 4C³ - 3C = [4a³ - 3a(a + b)^2] / (a + b)^3

Let me compute the numerator:

4a³ - 3a(a + b)^2 = 4a³ - 3a(a² + 2ab + b²) = 4a³ - 3a³ - 6a²b - 3ab² = (4a³ - 3a³) + (-6a²b - 3ab²) = a³ - 6a²b - 3ab²

So, 4C³ - 3C = (a³ - 6a²b - 3ab²) / (a + b)^3

But a = 121, b = k/4.

So, let's substitute back:

Numerator: 121³ - 6*(121)²*(k/4) - 3*121*(k/4)^2

Denominator: (121 + k/4)^3

So, that's the expression for 4C³ - 3C.

But we know that 4C³ - 3C = (1 - k/4)/(1 + k/4)

So, we have:

(121³ - 6*(121)²*(k/4) - 3*121*(k²/16)) / (121 + k/4)^3 = (1 - k/4)/(1 + k/4)

This equation can be used to solve for k.

But this seems quite complicated. Maybe there is a better approach.

Alternatively, let me define t = k/4, so t = (y²)/4

Then, the equation becomes:

[121³ - 6*(121)^2 * t - 3*121*t²] / (121 + t)^3 = (1 - t)/(1 + t)

So, let me write that:

[121³ - 6*121² t - 3*121 t²] / (121 + t)^3 = (1 - t)/(1 + t)

Let me cross-multiply:

[121³ - 6*121² t - 3*121 t²] * (1 + t) = (1 - t) * (121 + t)^3

This is a polynomial equation in t, which can be solved.

But before going into expanding, perhaps I can factor out 121 from the numerator:

Numerator: 121*(121² - 6*121 t - 3 t²)

Wait, 121³ - 6*121² t - 3*121 t² = 121*(121² - 6*121 t - 3 t²)

But 121² is 14641, 6*121 is 726. So, 14641 - 726t - 3t². Hmm, that doesn't seem to factor neatly.

Alternatively, perhaps 121 is a multiple of something. Wait, 121 is 11², but not sure.

Alternatively, let's denote u = t/121, so t = 121 u.

Then, let's substitute t = 121 u:

Numerator: 121³ - 6*121²*(121 u) - 3*121*(121 u)^2 

= 121³ - 6*121³ u - 3*121³ u²

= 121³ (1 - 6u - 3u²)

Denominator: (121 + t)^3 = (121 + 121 u)^3 = (121(1 + u))^3 = 121³ (1 + u)^3

So, the left-hand side becomes [121³ (1 - 6u - 3u²)] / [121³ (1 + u)^3] = (1 - 6u - 3u²)/(1 + u)^3

Similarly, the right-hand side is (1 - t)/(1 + t) = (1 - 121 u)/(1 + 121 u)

So, the equation simplifies to:

(1 - 6u - 3u²)/(1 + u)^3 = (1 - 121 u)/(1 + 121 u)

Cross-multiplying:

(1 - 6u - 3u²)(1 + 121 u) = (1 - 121 u)(1 + u)^3

This is still a bit complicated, but maybe we can expand both sides.

First, left-hand side:

(1 - 6u - 3u²)(1 + 121u)

Multiply term by term:

1*(1) + 1*(121u) -6u*(1) -6u*(121u) -3u²*(1) -3u²*(121u)

= 1 + 121u -6u -726u² -3u² -363u³

Combine like terms:

Constant term: 1

u terms: 121u -6u = 115u

u² terms: -726u² -3u² = -729u²

u³ terms: -363u³

So, left-hand side: 1 + 115u -729u² -363u³

Now, right-hand side:

(1 - 121u)(1 + u)^3

First, compute (1 + u)^3:

(1 + u)^3 = 1 + 3u + 3u² + u³

So, multiply by (1 - 121u):

1*(1 + 3u + 3u² + u³) -121u*(1 + 3u + 3u² + u³)

= 1 + 3u + 3u² + u³ -121u -363u² -363u³ -121u^4

Combine like terms:

Constant term: 1

u terms: 3u -121u = -118u

u² terms: 3u² -363u² = -360u²

u³ terms: u³ -363u³ = -362u³

u^4 terms: -121u^4

So, right-hand side: 1 - 118u -360u² -362u³ -121u^4

Now, set left-hand side equal to right-hand side:

1 + 115u -729u² -363u³ = 1 - 118u -360u² -362u³ -121u^4

Subtract left-hand side from both sides:

0 = (1 - 118u -360u² -362u³ -121u^4) - (1 + 115u -729u² -363u³)

Compute term by term:

1 - 1 = 0

-118u -115u = -233u

-360u² + 729u² = 369u²

-362u³ + 363u³ = 1u³

-121u^4 remains.

So, we have:

0 = -233u + 369u² + u³ -121u^4

Rewrite in standard form:

121u^4 - u³ -369u² +233u =0

Factor out u:

u(121u³ - u² -369u +233) =0

So, solutions are u=0, and solutions to 121u³ -u² -369u +233=0.

u=0 would mean t=0, which would mean y=0, which is not possible because BC would collapse to a point. So, we can ignore u=0.

Now, we need to solve 121u³ -u² -369u +233=0.

This is a cubic equation. Maybe it can be factored.

Let me try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 233 over factors of 121. So, possible roots are ±1, ±233, ±1/11, ±233/11, etc.

Let me test u=1:

121(1) -1 -369 +233= 121 -1 -369 +233= (121 +233) - (1 + 369)= 354 - 370= -16≠0

u= -1:

121(-1)^3 - (-1)^2 -369*(-1) +233= -121 -1 +369 +233= (-121 -1) + (369 +233)= -122 + 602= 480≠0

u=233/121, which is approximately 1.925, but that seems messy.

Alternatively, maybe u=1/11:

Compute 121*(1/11)^3 - (1/11)^2 -369*(1/11) +233

=121*(1/1331) -1/121 -369/11 +233

=121/1331 -1/121 -369/11 +233

=1/11 -1/121 -369/11 +233

Convert to common denominator 121:

=11/121 -1/121 - (369*11)/121 +233*121/121

= (11 -1 -4059 + 26733)/121

= (10 -4059 +26733)/121

= (26733 -4049)/121

=22684/121≈187.32≠0

Not zero.

How about u=1/2:

121*(1/2)^3 - (1/2)^2 -369*(1/2) +233

=121*(1/8) -1/4 -369/2 +233

=15.125 -0.25 -184.5 +233

≈15.125 -0.25=14.875; 14.875 -184.5= -169.625; -169.625 +233≈63.375≠0

Not zero.

How about u=1/23? Maybe u=1/11, which we tried.

Alternatively, maybe use synthetic division.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since the equation is 121u³ - u² -369u +233=0.

Let me write coefficients:

121 | -1 | -369 | 233

Wait, synthetic division with a possible root. Let me try u=1:

Coefficients: 121, -1, -369, 233

Bring down 121

Multiply by 1: 121

Add to next coefficient: -1 +121=120

Multiply by1:120

Add to next coefficient: -369 +120=-249

Multiply by1: -249

Add to last coefficient: 233 + (-249)= -16≠0

So, not a root.

How about u= -1:

Coefficients: 121, -1, -369, 233

Bring down 121

Multiply by -1: -121

Add to next coefficient: -1 + (-121)= -122

Multiply by -1:122

Add to next coefficient: -369 +122= -247

Multiply by -1:247

Add to last coefficient:233 +247=480≠0

Not a root.

How about u=233/121, which is approximately 1.925.

But that's messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier expansion. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should have kept it as 1 - 6u -3u² over 1 + u³.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when I substituted t = 121u, we ended up with:

(1 - 6u - 3u²)/(1 + u)^3 = (1 - 121u)/(1 + 121u)

Then cross-multiplied:

(1 - 6u - 3u²)(1 + 121u) = (1 - 121u)(1 + u)^3

Wait, let me verify that expansion.

Left-hand side: (1 - 6u - 3u²)(1 + 121u)

=1*(1) +1*(121u) -6u*(1) -6u*(121u) -3u²*(1) -3u²*(121u)

=1 + 121u -6u -726u² -3u² -363u³

=1 + (121u -6u) + (-726u² -3u²) -363u³

=1 + 115u -729u² -363u³

Yes, that's correct.

Right-hand side: (1 - 121u)(1 + u)^3

(1 + u)^3 is 1 + 3u + 3u² + u³

Multiply by (1 -121u):

1*(1 + 3u + 3u² + u³) -121u*(1 + 3u + 3u² + u³)

=1 + 3u + 3u² + u³ -121u -363u² -363u³ -121u^4

=1 + (3u -121u) + (3u² -363u²) + (u³ -363u³) -121u^4

=1 -118u -360u² -362u³ -121u^4

Yes, that's correct.

So, the expansion seems correct. So, moving on.

So, bringing all terms to left-hand side:

1 + 115u -729u² -363u³ -1 +118u +360u² +362u³ +121u^4 =0

Wait, no, wait, the equation was:

1 + 115u -729u² -363u³ = 1 -118u -360u² -362u³ -121u^4

Subtracting RHS from LHS:

(1 -1 + 115u +118u) + (-729u² +360u²) + (-363u³ +362u³) +121u^4=0

So:

0 + 233u -369u² + (-1)u³ +121u^4=0

Which is 121u^4 -u³ -369u² +233u=0

Yes, same as before.

So, 121u^4 -u³ -369u² +233u=0

So, u(121u³ -u² -369u +233)=0

So, we have to solve 121u³ -u² -369u +233=0.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe this is a quadratic in u² or something. But it's a cubic. Maybe factor by grouping.

Let me try:

121u³ -u² -369u +233=0

Group terms as (121u³ -u²) + (-369u +233)=0

Factor out u² from first group: u²(121u -1) - (369u -233)=0

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe factor as (au² + bu + c)(du + e)=0

Let me try to factor 121u³ -u² -369u +233.

Assume (au² + bu + c)(du + e)=121u³ -u² -369u +233

Multiply out:

a d u³ + (a e + b d)u² + (b e + c d)u + c e =121u³ -u² -369u +233

So, equate coefficients:

a d =121

a e + b d = -1

b e + c d= -369

c e=233

We need integers a,b,c,d,e such that these hold.

233 is a prime number, so c e=233. So, possible (c,e)=(1,233),(233,1),(-1,-233),(-233,-1)

Let me try c=1, e=233.

Then, c e=233.

Now, a d=121. 121 is 11², so possible a=11, d=11 or a=1, d=121, etc.

Let me try a=11, d=11.

Then, a e + b d=11*233 + b*11=2563 +11b= -1

So, 11b= -1 -2563= -2564

b= -2564 /11= -233.09... Not integer, so discard.

Try a=11, d=11, e=233.

But same issue.

Try a=1, d=121.

Then, a e + b d=1*233 + b*121=233 +121b= -1

So, 121b= -234

b= -234 /121≈-1.933, not integer.

Try a=121, d=1.

Then, a e + b d=121*233 + b*1=28093 +b= -1

So, b= -28094. Not useful.

Alternatively, c=233, e=1.

Then, a d=121. Let me try a=11, d=11.

Then, a e + b d=11*1 + b*11=11 +11b= -1

So, 11b= -12

b= -12/11, not integer.

a=1, d=121.

a e + b d=1*1 + b*121=1 +121b= -1

121b= -2

b= -2/121, not integer.

Alternatively, perhaps c=-1, e=-233.

Then, a d=121.

a e + b d= a*(-233) + b*d= -233a +b d= -1

b e + c d= b*(-233) + (-1)*d= -233b -d= -369

c e= (-1)*(-233)=233, which is correct.

So, equations:

-233a + b d= -1

-233b -d= -369

a d=121

So, let me take a=1, d=121.

Then,

First equation: -233*1 + b*121= -233 +121b= -1

121b=232

b=232/121≈1.917, not integer.

a=11, d=11.

First equation: -233*11 +11b= -2563 +11b= -1

11b=2562

b=2562/11=233, which is integer.

Second equation: -233b -d= -233*233 -11= -54289 -11= -54300≠-369. Not correct.

a=121, d=1.

First equation: -233*121 +b*1= -28093 +b= -1

b=28092, which is too big.

Alternatively, a= -11, d= -11.

First equation: -233*(-11) +b*(-11)=2563 -11b= -1

-11b= -2564

b=2564/11≈233.09, not integer.

a= -1, d= -121.

First equation: -233*(-1) +b*(-121)=233 -121b= -1

-121b= -234

b=234/121≈1.933, not integer.

Alternatively, c=233, e=1.

Then, a d=121.

a e + b d= a*1 +b d= a +121b= -1

b e + c d= b*1 +233 d= b +233d= -369

So, equations:

a +121b= -1

b +233d= -369

a d=121

Trying a=1, d=121:

First equation:1 +121b= -1 =>121b= -2=> b= -2/121, not integer.

a=11, d=11:

First equation:11 +121b= -1 =>121b= -12 => b= -12/121, not integer.

a=121, d=1:

121 +121b= -1 =>121b= -122 =>b= -122/121≈-1.008, not integer.

a= -1, d= -121:

-1 +121b= -1 =>121b=0 =>b=0

Then, second equation:0 +233d= -369

233d= -369 =>d= -369/233≈-1.583, not integer.

a= -11, d= -11:

-11 +121b= -1 =>121b=10=>b=10/121≈0.0826, not integer.

Not helpful.

So, maybe this cubic is not factorable with integer coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps use rational root theorem again. But since no rational roots are found, perhaps we need to use the cubic formula.

Alternatively, perhaps make substitution.

Let me set t = u + k, to eliminate the cubic term or something.

Wait, the cubic is 121u³ -u² -369u +233=0

Let me write it as 121u³ -369u -u² +233=0

Still, not helpful.

Alternatively, let me try to write it as 121u³ -369u= u² -233

u² -233=121u³ -369u

So, u²=121u³ -369u +233

But I don't think that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps take an approximate solution.

Since this is getting too involved, maybe I can try to find the value numerically.

Let me consider that the cubic equation is 121u³ -u² -369u +233=0

We can try to find approximate roots.

Let me compute f(u)=121u³ -u² -369u +233

Compute f(0)=0 -0 -0 +233=233>0

f(1)=121 -1 -369 +233=121+233=354; 354 -1 -369= -16<0

f(2)=121*8 -4 -738 +233=968 -4 -738 +233=968-738=230; 230 -4=226; 226+233=459>0

f(3)=121*27 -9 -1107 +233=3267 -9 -1107 +233=3267-1107=2160; 2160 -9=2151; 2151+233=2384>0

f(4)=121*64 -16 -1476 +233=7744 -16=7728; 7728 -1476=6252; 6252 +233=6485>0

Wait, but f(1)= -16, f(0)=233, so a root between 0 and1.

Similarly, f(0.1)=121*(0.001) -0.01 -36.9 +233≈0.121 -0.01 -36.9 +233≈0.111 -36.9 +233≈-36.789 +233≈196.211>0

Wait, wait, that can't be.

Wait, f(0.1)=121*(0.1)^3 - (0.1)^2 -369*(0.1) +233=121*(0.001) -0.01 -36.9 +233=0.121 -0.01 -36.9 +233≈0.111 -36.9 +233≈-36.789 +233≈196.211>0

f(0.05)=121*(0.000125) -0.0025 -369*0.05 +233≈0.015125 -0.0025 -18.45 +233≈0.012625 -18.45 +233≈-18.437375 +233≈214.5626>0

f(0.01)=121*(0.000001) -0.0001 -3.69 +233≈0.000121 -0.0001 -3.69 +233≈-3.6999 +233≈229.3001>0

f(0.001)=121*(0.0000001) -0.00001 -0.369 +233≈≈232.631>0

Wait, f(0)=233, f(0.1)=196, f(0.05)=214, f(0.01)=229, f(0.001)=232. So, f(u) is always positive? But wait, f(u) approaches infinity as u approaches infinity, and at u=0, f(u)=233.

Wait, but earlier f(u)=121u³ -u² -369u +233.

Wait, when u is negative.

At u=-1: f(-1)= -121 -1 +369 +233= (-121 -1)+(369 +233)= -122 +602=480>0

u=-2: f(-2)=121*(-8) -4 - (-738)+233= -968 -4 +738 +233= (-968 -4) + (738 +233)= -972 +971≈-1<0

So, f(-2)= -1, f(-1)=480. So, a root between -2 and -1.

But since u=t/121, and t=k/4, and y²=k/4, and y is positive. So, u must be positive, since t is positive. Thus, u>0.

So, u must be positive. But earlier, f(u) seems positive at u=0, and f(0.1)=196, so perhaps there's no root for u>0.

Wait, but then if there are no positive roots, that would mean that our earlier assumption that u is positive is incorrect.

Wait, but u is t/121, and t is y², which is positive, so u is positive.

But if f(u) is always positive for u≥0, then there is no solution? That can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, let's go back.

We had cos(theta)= (121 - y²/4)/(121 + y²/4), and theta=3 theta.

But when we derived the equation, we had to go through several steps, but perhaps made a mistake in the expansion.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider specific triangle properties.

Wait, let's consider triangle ABC, which is isosceles with AB=AC, altitude AM=11, and D on AM with AD=10, so DM=1.

We need angle BDC=3 angle BAC.

Let me denote angle BAC=θ, so angle BDC=3θ.

In triangle ABC, sides AB=AC, let me denote AB=AC=c, BC=2y.

So, in triangle ABC, using the Pythagorean theorem, AM=11, so BM=MC= y.

So, AB²=AM² + BM²=11² + y²=121 + y².

So, AB=AC=√(121 + y²).

Therefore, in triangle ABC, angle BAC=θ, which can be found by trigonometry.

In triangle ABC, tan(theta/2)= BM / AM= y /11.

So, tan(theta/2)= y /11.

So, theta=2 arctan(y/11).

Similarly, in triangle BDC, angle BDC=3 theta.

We need to relate sides of triangle BDC.

In triangle BDC, sides: BD=1, DC= sqrt( (y/2)^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(y²/4 +1).

So, in triangle BDC, sides: BD=1, DC= sqrt(y²/4 +1), BC=2y.

So, by the Law of Sines:

BD / sin(angle BCD) = DC / sin(angle BDC) = BC / sin(angle BDC)

Wait, but angle BCD is equal to angle BAC= theta, because in triangle ABC, angle BAC=theta, and since ABC is isosceles, angles at B and C are equal.

But in triangle BDC, angles at B and C are different.

Wait, perhaps not. Wait, in triangle BDC, angle BDC=3 theta, angle at D. What are the other angles?

In triangle BDC, sum of angles is 180°: angle DBC + angle BCD + angle BDC=180°.

But angle DBC= angle ABC of triangle ABC, which is angle at B.

But in triangle ABC, angles at B and C are equal, each equal to (180° - theta)/2.

So, angle DBC= (180° - theta)/2.

Similarly, angle BCD is equal to angle BAC= theta, since in triangle ABC, angle BAC is at A, but in triangle BDC, angle BCD is an angle at C, which in triangle ABC is equal to angle ABC, which is (180° - theta)/2.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, in triangle ABC, angles at B and C are equal, each equal to (180° - theta)/2.

In triangle BDC, angle at C is angle BCD, which is adjacent to side BC in triangle BDC.

But in triangle ABC, angle at C is angle BCA= angle ACB= (180° - theta)/2.

So, in triangle BDC, angle BCD is the same as angle ACB= (180° - theta)/2.

Similarly, angle at D is angle BDC=3 theta.

Therefore, in triangle BDC, sum of angles:

angle DBC + angle BCD + angle BDC=180°

So, (180° - theta)/2 + (180° - theta)/2 +3 theta=180°

Simplify:

(180° - theta) +3 theta=180°

180° +2 theta=180°

2 theta=0°, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be.

So, something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in assigning angle BCD= angle BAC. Maybe not.

Wait, in triangle ABC, angle BAC= theta. In triangle BDC, angle BCD is not necessarily equal to theta.

Wait, in triangle ABC, angle at C is angle ACB= (180° - theta)/2.

In triangle BDC, angle at C is angle BCD. So, unless points D and A are aligned in a certain way, which they're not, angle BCD is different.

So, perhaps I need another approach.

Alternatively, let's use coordinates.

Let me place point A at (0,11), point M at (0,0), so AM is the y-axis. Then, point B is at (-y/2, 0), point C is at (y/2,0). Point D is at (0,10).

So, point D is at (0,10). Then, points B(-y/2,0), D(0,10), C(y/2,0).

We need to compute angle BDC=3 theta.

First, compute vectors DB and DC.

Vector DB is from D(0,10) to B(-y/2,0): (-y/2, -10)

Vector DC is from D(0,10) to C(y/2,0): (y/2, -10)

Compute angle between vectors DB and DC, which is angle BDC.

Using the dot product:

cos(angle BDC)= (DB . DC)/( |DB| |DC| )

Compute DB . DC= (-y/2)(y/2) + (-10)(-10)= (-y²)/4 +100

|DB|= sqrt( (-y/2)^2 + (-10)^2 )=sqrt(y²/4 +100)

Similarly, |DC|= sqrt( (y/2)^2 + (-10)^2 )=sqrt(y²/4 +100)

So, |DB|=|DC|=sqrt(y²/4 +100)

Thus, cos(angle BDC)= ( (-y²/4 +100 ) ) / ( y²/4 +100 )

Angle BDC= arccos( (100 - y²/4)/(y²/4 +100) )

We are told that angle BDC=3 theta.

But earlier, we have theta= angle BAC.

In triangle ABC, angle BAC=theta, which is the angle at A.

In triangle ABC, tan(theta/2)= BM / AM= y /11

So, tan(theta/2)= y /11

Thus, theta=2 arctan(y/11)

So, 3 theta=6 arctan(y/11)

Thus, angle BDC=6 arctan(y/11)

But angle BDC is also equal to arccos( (100 - y²/4)/(y²/4 +100) )

So, we have:

6 arctan(y/11)= arccos( (100 - y²/4)/(y²/4 +100) )

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can solve for y.

Let me denote phi= arctan(y/11), so that angle BDC=6 phi, and angle BAC=theta=2 phi.

So, we have 6 phi= arccos( (100 - y²/4)/(y²/4 +100) )

But tan(phi)= y /11, so y=11 tan(phi)

Thus, y²=121 tan²(phi)

So, let's substitute y²=121 tan²(phi) into the equation.

So, 6 phi= arccos( (100 - (121 tan²(phi))/4 )/( (121 tan²(phi))/4 +100 ) )

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator:100 - (121 tan²(phi))/4

Denominator: (121 tan²(phi))/4 +100

So, (100 - (121/4) tan²(phi))/(100 + (121/4) tan²(phi))= [ (400 -121 tan²(phi))/4 ] / [ (400 +121 tan²(phi))/4 ]= (400 -121 tan²(phi))/(400 +121 tan²(phi))

Thus, cos(6 phi)= (400 -121 tan²(phi))/(400 +121 tan²(phi))

So, cos(6 phi)= (400 -121 tan²(phi))/(400 +121 tan²(phi))

This seems manageable.

Let me let t= tan(phi). Then, cos(6 phi)= (400 -121 t²)/(400 +121 t²)

But also, cos(6 phi)=cos(6 arctan(t))= expression in terms of t.

I know that cos(6 arctan(t)) can be expressed in terms of t using multiple-angle formulas.

Let me recall that cos(6 arctan(t)) can be written in terms of t.

Alternatively, use the identity:

cos(6 theta)= 32 cos^6(theta) -48 cos^4(theta) +18 cos^2(theta) -1

But that might be too complex. Alternatively, perhaps express cos(6 theta) in terms of cos(theta).

Alternatively, use multiple-angle formulas step by step.

Let me compute step by step:

Let theta= arctan(t). Then, cos(theta)=1/√(1 + t²), sin(theta)=t/√(1 + t²).

cos(2 theta)=2 cos²(theta) -1=2/(1 + t²) -1= (2 -1 -t²)/(1 + t²)= (1 -t²)/(1 + t²)

Similarly, sin(2 theta)=2 t / (1 + t²)

cos(3 theta)=4 cos³(theta) -3 cos(theta)=4/(1 + t²)^(3/2) -3/(√(1 + t²))

Alternatively, cos(3 theta)= (4 t³ -3 t)/(4 t² +3)

Wait, yes, correct.

Similarly, cos(3 theta)= (4 t³ -3 t)/(4 t² +3)

Similarly, cos(6 theta)= 2 cos²(3 theta) -1

So, let me compute cos(3 theta)= (4 t³ -3 t)/(4 t² +3)

Then, cos(6 theta)= 2 [ (4 t³ -3 t)^2 / (4 t² +3)^2 ] -1

Compute numerator:

(4 t³ -3 t)^2=16 t^6 -24 t^4 +9 t²

Denominator:

(4 t² +3)^2=16 t^4 +24 t² +9

Thus,

cos(6 theta)= 2*(16 t^6 -24 t^4 +9 t²)/(16 t^4 +24 t² +9) -1

Compute numerator:

2*(16 t^6 -24 t^4 +9 t²)=32 t^6 -48 t^4 +18 t²

Denominator:

16 t^4 +24 t² +9

Thus,

cos(6 theta)= (32 t^6 -48 t^4 +18 t²)/(16 t^4 +24 t² +9) -1

= (32 t^6 -48 t^4 +18 t² -16 t^4 -24 t² -9)/(16 t^4 +24 t² +9)

Simplify numerator:

32 t^6 -48 t^4 -16 t^4 +18 t² -24 t² -9

=32 t^6 -64 t^4 -6 t² -9

So,

cos(6 theta)= (32 t^6 -64 t^4 -6 t² -9)/(16 t^4 +24 t² +9)

Thus, we have:

cos(6 theta)= (32 t^6 -64 t^4 -6 t² -9)/(16 t^4 +24 t² +9)

But we also have:

cos(6 theta)= (400 -121 t²)/(400 +121 t²)

So,

(32 t^6 -64 t^4 -6 t² -9)/(16 t^4 +24 t² +9)= (400 -121 t²)/(400 +121 t²)

Cross-multiplying:

(32 t^6 -64 t^4 -6 t² -9)(400 +121 t²) = (400 -121 t²)(16 t^4 +24 t² +9)

Compute each side.

Left side:

Multiply term by term:

-9 *121 t²= -1,089 t²

Combine like terms:

t^8: -25,600 t^4 (Wait, actually, only 32 t^6 *121 t² is the only t^8 term.

t^8: -25,600 t^4

t^6:12,800 t^6 -7,104 t^6=5,696 t^6

t^4:-25,600 t^4 -726 t^4= -26,326 t^4

t²:-2,400 t² -1,089 t²= -3,489 t²

Constants:-3,600

So, left side: -25,600 t^4 +5,696 t^6 -26,326 t^4 -3,489 t² -3,600

Wait, no, in left side, t^8 is only -25,600 t^4, which is actually t^8, which is -25,600 t^4.

Wait, in the expansion, we have:

32 t^6 *121 t²=3,872 t^8

-64 t^4 *400= -25,600 t^4

Similarly, other terms.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, no, cross-multiplied:

Left side: (32 t^6 -64 t^4 -6 t² -9)(400 +121 t²)

Multiply each term:

32 t^6*400=12,800 t^6

32 t^6*121 t²=3,872 t^8

-64 t^4*400= -25,600 t^4

-64 t^4*121 t²= -7,104 t^6

-6 t²*400= -2,400 t²

-6 t²*121 t²= -726 t^4

-9*400= -3,600

-9*121 t²= -1,089 t²

So, combining:

t^8:3,872 t^8

t^6:12,800 t^6 -7,104 t^6=5,696 t^6

t^4:-25,600 t^4 -726 t^4= -26,326 t^4

t²:-2,400 t² -1,089 t²= -3,489 t²

Constants:-3,600

So, left side:3,872 t^8 +5,696 t^6 -26,326 t^4 -3,489 t² -3,600

Similarly, right side: (400 -121 t²)(16 t^4 +24 t² +9)

Multiply term by term:

400*16 t^4=6,400 t^4

400*24 t²=9,600 t²

400*9=3,600

-121 t²*16 t^4= -1,936 t^6

-121 t²*24 t²= -2,904 t^4

-121 t²*9= -1,089 t²

Combine like terms:

t^6:-1,936 t^6

t^4:6,400 t^4 -2,904 t^4=3,496 t^4

t²:9,600 t² -1,089 t²=8,511 t²

Constants:3,600

So, right side: -1,936 t^6 +3,496 t^4 +8,511 t² +3,600

Set left side equal to right side:

3,872 t^8 +5,696 t^6 -26,326 t^4 -3,489 t² -3,600 = -1,936 t^6 +3,496 t^4 +8,511 t² +3,600

Bring all terms to left:

3,872 t^8 +5,696 t^6 -26,326 t^4 -3,489 t² -3,600 +1,936 t^6 -3,496 t^4 -8,511 t² -3,600=0

Combine like terms:

t^8:3,872 t^8

t^6:5,696 t^6 +1,936 t^6=7,632 t^6

t^4:-26,326 t^4 -3,496 t^4=-29,822 t^4

t²:-3,489 t² -8,511 t²=-12,000 t²

Constants:-3,600 -3,600=-7,200

So, equation:

3,872 t^8 +7,632 t^6 -29,822 t^4 -12,000 t² -7,200=0

Let me divide both sides by 4 to simplify:

968 t^8 +1,908 t^6 -7,455.5 t^4 -3,000 t² -1,800=0

Wait, it's messy with decimals. Alternatively, maybe factor it.

Alternatively, perhaps factor as quadratic in t^4.

Let me set u= t^4.

Then, equation becomes:

3,872 u² +7,632 u -29,822 u² -12,000 u -7,200=0

Wait, that seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution z= t².

So, t^4= z², t^6= z^3, t^8= z^4.

Equation:

3,872 z^4 +7,632 z^3 -29,822 z² -12,000 z -7,200=0

Still a quartic equation, which is difficult to solve.

Alternatively, maybe try to factor.

Alternatively, perhaps use rational root theorem for quartic.

Possible rational roots are factors of 7,200 over factors of 3,872.

But this is getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution z= t².

Wait, maybe the equation is too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps go back to the problem and think differently.

Given that angle BDC=3 angle BAC.

Wait, in triangle ABC, angle BAC=theta, angle BDC=3 theta.

In triangle BDC, sides BD=1, DC=sqrt(y²/4 +1), BC=2y.

In triangle ABC, sides AB=AC= sqrt(121 + y²), BC=2y.

Perhaps use the Law of Sines in triangle BDC.

In triangle BDC, angle at D is 3 theta, sides BD=1, DC= sqrt(y²/4 +1), BC=2y.

Thus, Law of Sines:

BD / sin(angle BCD)= DC / sin(angle BDC)= BC / sin(angle DBC)

So,

1 / sin(angle BCD)= sqrt(y²/4 +1) / sin(3 theta)= 2y / sin(angle DBC)

But angle DBC= (180° - theta)/2, as we concluded earlier.

Thus,

1 / sin(angle BCD)= sqrt(y²/4 +1) / sin(3 theta)= 2y / sin( (180° - theta)/2 )

Let me denote angle BCD= angle BAC= theta, but wait, in triangle BDC, angle at C is angle BCD, which is different from angle BAC.

Earlier, I thought angle BCD= angle BAC= theta, but that might not be correct.

Wait, in triangle ABC, angle at C is angle ACB= (180° - theta)/2.

In triangle BDC, angle at C is angle BCD.

So, unless points D and A are aligned in a certain way, angle BCD is different.

Wait, unless D is the foot of the altitude from A, but in that case, angle BCD might not be equal to angle BAC.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities in triangle BDC.

Let me denote angle DBC= (180° - theta)/2, angle BDC=3 theta, so angle BCD= 180° - (180° - theta)/2 -3 theta

Compute angle BCD:

= 180° - (90° - theta/2) -3 theta

= 180° -90° + theta/2 -3 theta

=90° - (5 theta)/2

So, angle BCD=90° - (5 theta)/2.

Therefore, in triangle BDC, angles:

angle DBC= (180° - theta)/2

angle BDC=3 theta

angle BCD=90° -5 theta/2

So, summing up:

(180° - theta)/2 +3 theta +90° -5 theta/2=180°, which checks out.

Now, applying Law of Sines:

BD / sin(angle BCD)=1 / sin(90° -5 theta/2)=sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)= BC / sin(angle DBC)=2y / sin( (180° - theta)/2 )

So, we have:

1 / cos(5 theta/2)= sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)=2y / sin( (180° - theta)/2 )

So, first equation:

1 / cos(5 theta/2)= sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)

Second equation:

sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)=2y / sin( (180° - theta)/2 )

Let me focus on the second equation.

sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)=2y / sin( (180° - theta)/2 )

Note that sin( (180° - theta)/2 )= sin(90° - theta/2)=cos(theta/2)

So, equation becomes:

sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)=2y / cos(theta/2)

So, sqrt(y²/4 +1)= [2y sin(3 theta)] / cos(theta/2)

Let me square both sides:

y²/4 +1= [4 y² sin²(3 theta)] / cos²(theta/2)

Similarly, from the first equation:

1 / cos(5 theta/2)= sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)

So, sqrt(y²/4 +1)= sin(3 theta)/cos(5 theta/2)

Thus, from both equations:

sqrt(y²/4 +1)= sin(3 theta)/cos(5 theta/2)= [2y sin(3 theta)] / cos(theta/2)

So,

sin(3 theta)/cos(5 theta/2)=2y / cos(theta/2)

Thus,

sin(3 theta)= 2y cos(5 theta/2) / cos(theta/2)

Let me denote phi= theta/2.

Then, theta=2 phi.

So, equation becomes:

sin(6 phi)= 2y cos(5 phi) / cos(phi)

Hmm, sin(6 phi)= 2y cos(5 phi)/cos(phi)

Perhaps express cos(5 phi)/cos(phi):

cos(5 phi)= 16 cos^5(phi) -20 cos^3(phi) +5 cos(phi)

Thus,

cos(5 phi)/cos(phi)=16 cos^4(phi) -20 cos^2(phi) +5

So,

sin(6 phi)=2y (16 cos^4(phi) -20 cos^2(phi) +5 )

Express sin(6 phi) in terms of cos(phi):

sin(6 phi)=2y [16 cos^4(phi) -20 cos^2(phi) +5 ]

But also, sin(6 phi)= sin(2*3 phi)=2 sin(3 phi) cos(3 phi)=2[3 sin(phi) -4 sin^3(phi)][4 cos^3(phi)-3 sin(phi)]

But that might not help directly.

Alternatively, express sin(6 phi)=2 sin(3 phi) cos(3 phi)=2[3 sin(phi) -4 sin^3(phi)][4 cos^3(phi)-3 sin(phi)]

This seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps express sin(6 phi) in terms of cos(phi):

Let me use the identity sin(6 phi)=2 sin(3 phi) cos(3 phi)=2[3 sin(phi) -4 sin^3(phi)][4 cos^3(phi)-3 sin(phi)]

But it's getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps express sin(6 phi) in terms of cos(phi):

sin(6 phi)=2 sin(3 phi) cos(3 phi)=2[ sqrt(3) sin(2 phi) -1 ] cos(3 phi). Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps use multiple-angle identities.

Let me write sin(6 phi)=2 sin(3 phi) cos(3 phi)=2[3 sin(phi) -4 sin^3(phi)][4 cos^3(phi)-3 sin(phi)]

Expanding:

=2[3 sin(phi)*4 cos^3(phi) -3 sin(phi)*3 sin(phi) -4 sin^3(phi)*4 cos^3(phi) +4 sin^3(phi)*3 sin(phi)]

Wait, no, better to compute term by term:

First, sin(3 phi)=3 sin(phi) -4 sin^3(phi)

cos(3 phi)=4 cos^3(phi)-3 sin^2(phi)

So, sin(6 phi)=2 sin(3 phi) cos(3 phi)=2*(3 sin(phi) -4 sin^3(phi))*(4 cos^3(phi)-3 sin^2(phi))

Multiply:

=2*[3 sin(phi)*4 cos^3(phi) -3 sin(phi)*3 sin^2(phi) -4 sin^3(phi)*4 cos^3(phi) +4 sin^3(phi)*3 sin^2(phi)]

Simplify term by term:

=2*[12 sin(phi) cos^3(phi) -9 sin^3(phi) -16 sin^3(phi) cos^3(phi) +12 sin^5(phi)]

=24 sin(phi) cos^3(phi) -18 sin^3(phi) -32 sin^3(phi) cos^3(phi) +24 sin^5(phi)

So,

sin(6 phi)=24 sin(phi) cos^3(phi) -18 sin^3(phi) -32 sin^3(phi) cos^3(phi) +24 sin^5(phi)

Factor sin(phi) cos(phi):

= sin(phi) cos(phi) [24 cos^2(phi) -18 sin^2(phi) -32 sin^2(phi) cos^2(phi) +24 sin^4(phi)]

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution t= phi.

Alternatively, perhaps try numerical methods.

Given that this is getting too involved, perhaps it's better to consider that y=11, but not sure.

Wait, in the problem, the sides are AB=AC, AM=11, DM=1, BC is the base.

Wait, in a 11-11-1 triangle, but probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that triangle ABC is such that AM=11 is the altitude, and DM=1 is a segment on the altitude.

Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps take a different approach.

Given that angle BDC=3 angle BAC.

In triangle ABC, angle BAC=theta.

In triangle BDC, angle BDC=3 theta.

We have points D on AM, with AD=10, DM=1.

Perhaps using trigonometric identities.

Let me denote angle BAC=theta, so angle BDC=3 theta.

In triangle ABC, using Law of Sines:

AB=AC= c, BC=2y.

So, c= sqrt(121 + y²)

In triangle BDC, sides BD=1, DC= sqrt(y²/4 +1), BC=2y.

Law of Sines:

1 / sin(angle BCD)= sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)=2y / sin(angle DBC)

From earlier, angle BCD=90° -5 theta/2, angle DBC=(180° - theta)/2

So,

1 / cos(5 theta/2)= sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)=2y / cos(theta/2)

From the first ratio:

1 / cos(5 theta/2)= sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)

So,

sqrt(y²/4 +1)= sin(3 theta)/cos(5 theta/2)

From the second ratio:

sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)=2y / cos(theta/2)

So,

sqrt(y²/4 +1)= 2y sin(3 theta)/cos(theta/2)

Therefore,

2y sin(3 theta)/cos(theta/2)= sin(3 theta)/cos(5 theta/2)

Cancel sin(3 theta):

2y / cos(theta/2)=1 / cos(5 theta/2)

Thus,

2y= cos(theta/2)/cos(5 theta/2)

So,

y= [cos(theta/2)]/[2 cos(5 theta/2)]

So, now, express this as:

y= [cos(theta/2)]/[2 cos(5 theta/2)]

But from the Law of Sines in triangle ABC:

c= sqrt(121 + y²)=2R sin(angle BAC)=2R sin(theta)

But perhaps not useful.

Alternatively, maybe express cos(theta/2) and cos(5 theta/2) in terms of multiple angles.

Let me denote phi= theta/2.

Then, theta=2 phi.

So, y= [cos(phi)]/[2 cos(5 phi)]

So, y= [cos(phi)]/[2 cos(5 phi)]

But from triangle ABC, the altitude AM=11, which is also the height.

So, in triangle ABC, area is (1/2)*BC*AM= (1/2)*2y*11=11 y.

Also, area is (1/2)*AB*AC*sin(theta)= (1/2)*c*c sin(theta)= (1/2)(121 + y²) sin(theta)

Thus,

11 y= (1/2)(121 + y²) sin(theta)

So,

sin(theta)= (22 y)/(121 + y²)

But theta=2 phi, so sin(theta)=2 sin(phi) cos(phi)

So,

2 sin(phi) cos(phi)= (22 y)/(121 + y²)

Thus,

sin(phi) cos(phi)=11 y/(121 + y²)

But we have y= [cos(phi)]/[2 cos(5 phi)]

So, let me substitute y= [cos(phi)]/[2 cos(5 phi)] into sin(phi) cos(phi)=11 y/(121 + y²)

Thus,

sin(phi) cos(phi)=11 [cos(phi)/(2 cos(5 phi))]/[121 + [cos(phi)/(2 cos(5 phi))]^2]

Simplify RHS:

=11 [cos(phi)/(2 cos(5 phi))]/[ (121 * 4 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi) ) / (4 cos²(5 phi)) ]

=11 [cos(phi)/(2 cos(5 phi))] * [4 cos²(5 phi)/(121 *4 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi)) ]

=11 [cos(phi)/(2 cos(5 phi))] * [4 cos²(5 phi)/(484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi)) ]

=11 [cos(phi) *4 cos²(5 phi)] / [2 cos(5 phi) * (484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi)) ]

=11 [4 cos^3(phi) cos(5 phi)] / [2 cos(5 phi)(484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi)) ]

Simplify:

=11 [4 cos^3(phi)] / [2 (484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi)) ]

=11 [2 cos^3(phi)] / [484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi) ]

So, we have:

sin(phi) cos(phi)= [22 cos^3(phi)] / [484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi) ]

But sin(phi) cos(phi)= (1/2) sin(2 phi)= (1/2) sin(4 phi)

Wait, no, sin(2 phi)=2 sin(phi) cos(phi), so sin(phi) cos(phi)= (1/2) sin(2 phi)

Thus,

(1/2) sin(2 phi)= [22 cos^3(phi)] / [484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi) ]

So,

sin(2 phi)= [44 cos^3(phi)] / [484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi) ]

But 2 phi=2 theta= angle BAC*2= something.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps express sin(2 phi) in terms of cos(phi).

But 2 phi=2 theta, but theta= angle BAC.

Wait, perhaps too vague.

Alternatively, maybe take specific values.

Wait, since the problem is likely to have integer sides, maybe y is an integer multiple of 11 or something.

Let me try y=11.

If y=11, then BC=22.

Compute y= [cos(phi)]/[2 cos(5 phi)] =>11= [cos(phi)]/[2 cos(5 phi)]

So, 2 cos(5 phi) cos(phi)=11

But cos(5 phi)=16 cos^5(phi)-20 cos^3(phi)+5 cos(phi)

Thus,

2(16 cos^5(phi)-20 cos^3(phi)+5 cos(phi)) cos(phi)=11

=2(16 cos^6(phi)-20 cos^4(phi)+5 cos^2(phi))=11

So,

32 cos^6(phi)-40 cos^4(phi)+10 cos^2(phi)=11

Bring 11 to left:

32 cos^6(phi)-40 cos^4(phi)+10 cos^2(phi)-11=0

Let me set z=cos^2(phi):

Then, equation becomes:

32 z^3 -40 z^2 +10 z -11=0

Try to solve this cubic equation.

Possible rational roots: factors of 11 over factors of32: ±1, ±11, ±1/2, etc.

Test z=1:32 -40 +10 -11= -11≠0

z=11/32≈0.343: too big.

z=11/16≈0.6875: too big.

z=1/2:32*(1/8)-40*(1/4)+10*(1/2)-11=4 -10 +5 -11= -12≠0

z=1/4:32*(1/64)-40*(1/16)+10*(1/4)-11=0.5 -2.5 +2.5 -11= -11≠0

z=11/32: as above.

z=11/32: same as above.

z=1/32: too small.

z=3/4:32*(27/64)-40*(9/16)+10*(3/4)-11=13.5 -22.5 +7.5 -11= -13≠0

z=5/8:32*(125/512)-40*(25/64)+10*(5/8)-11= (40/32)- (100/16)+ (50/8)-11= 1.25 -6.25 +6.25 -11= -11≠0

z=7/8:32*(343/512)-40*(49/64)+10*(7/8)-11=14.125 -30.625 +8.75 -11= -9≠0

z=3/2: Not possible, since z=cos^2(phi) <=1.

So, no rational root.

Alternatively, use substitution.

Let me set w= phi, so equation is 32 cos^6 w -40 cos^4 w +10 cos^2 w -11=0

Alternatively, use substitution t=cos^2 w.

Let me set t=cos^2 w, so equation becomes 32 t^3 -40 t^2 +10 t -11=0

Wait, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution t=cos w.

But equation is 32 t^3 -40 t^2 +10 t -11=0

Looking for real roots.

Compute f(t)=32 t^3 -40 t^2 +10 t -11

f(1)=32 -40 +10 -11=-11

f(1.2)=32*(1.728)-40*(1.44)+10*(1.2)-11≈55.424 -57.6 +12 -11≈-11.176

f(1.3)=32*(2.197)-40*(1.69)+10*(1.3)-11≈69.504 -67.6 +13 -11≈-6.096

f(1.4)=32*(2.744)-40*(1.96)+10*(1.4)-11≈87.808 -78.4 +14 -11≈12.408

So, between t=1.3 and t=1.4, f(t) crosses zero.

So, approximate root t≈1.35

But t=cos^2 w <=1.

Wait, t=1.35>1, which is impossible.

So, no solution in this case.

Thus, y=11 is invalid.

Wait, perhaps try y= something else.

Wait, let me test y= sqrt(11), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that angle BAC=45°, so theta=45°, then angle BDC=135°, but unlikely.

Alternatively, let me consider triangle ABC with AM=11, altitude.

In this case, BC=2y.

In triangle ABC, the altitude is 11, so area is (1/2)*2y*11=11 y.

Also, area is (1/2)*AB^2 sin(theta), where theta= angle BAC.

So, 11 y= (1/2)(121 + y²) sin(theta)

Thus, sin(theta)= (22 y)/(121 + y²)

Also, in triangle BDC, angle BDC=3 theta.

From the ratio earlier:

y= [cos(phi)]/[2 cos(5 phi)], where phi= theta/2

But theta=2 phi.

So, y= [cos(phi)]/[2 cos(5 phi)]

And, sin(theta)=2 sin(phi) cos(phi)= (22 y)/(121 + y²)

Thus,

2 sin(phi) cos(phi)= (22 y)/(121 + y²)

But y= [cos(phi)]/[2 cos(5 phi)], so:

2 sin(phi) cos(phi)= (22 [cos(phi)/(2 cos(5 phi)) ]) / (121 + [cos(phi)/(2 cos(5 phi))]^2 )

Simplify RHS:

= (11 cos(phi)/cos(5 phi)) / (121 + cos²(phi)/(4 cos²(5 phi)) )

= (11 cos(phi)/cos(5 phi)) / [ (484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi)) / (4 cos²(5 phi)) ]

= (11 cos(phi)/cos(5 phi)) * (4 cos²(5 phi)/(484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi)) )

= (44 cos^3(phi) ) / (484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi) )

Thus,

2 sin(phi) cos(phi)= (44 cos^3(phi) ) / (484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi) )

Cancel cos(phi):

2 sin(phi)=44 cos²(phi) / (484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi) )

So,

sin(phi)=22 cos²(phi)/ (484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi) )

But sin(phi)= sqrt(1 - cos²(phi)).

Thus,

sqrt(1 - cos²(phi))=22 cos²(phi)/(484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi) )

Square both sides:

1 - cos²(phi)= (484 cos^4(phi))/(484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi))²

Let me denote z=cos²(phi):

Then,

1 - z= (484 z²)/(484 z² + z)^2

Wait, wait: denominator is (484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi))²= (484 (4 cos^10(phi) -30 cos^8(phi) +15 cos^6(phi)-cos^4(phi)) +z)^2. It's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps express cos(5 phi) in terms of z.

But cos(5 phi)=16 z^5 -20 z^3 +5 z.

Wait, no, cos(5 phi)=16 cos^5(phi)-20 cos^3(phi)+5 cos(phi). So, cos(5 phi)=16 z^{5/2} -20 z^{3/2} +5 sqrt(z). But this is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to assign numerical methods.

Assume that phi is small, say phi≈0.1 radians≈5.7 degrees.

Compute RHS:

22 cos²(phi)/(484 cos²(5 phi) + cos²(phi))≈22*(0.95)^2/(484*(0.85)^2 + (0.95)^2)≈22*0.9025/(484*0.7225 +0.9025)≈19.855/(349.01 +0.9025)≈19.855/350≈0.0567

So, sin(phi)≈0.0567, so phi≈0.0567 radians≈3.25 degrees.

Thus, phi≈3.25°, so theta=2 phi≈6.5°, angle BAC≈6.5°, angle BDC≈19.75°, BC≈2y.

But in triangle ABC, altitude AM=11.

But wait, if angle BAC is 6.5°, then sides AB=AC≈sqrt(121 + y²).

But AM=11 is the altitude, so AM=11= c cos(theta)= sqrt(121 + y²) cos(theta)

So, 11= sqrt(121 + y²) cos(theta)

But theta≈6.5°, cos(theta)=≈0.9945

So, sqrt(121 + y²)=11 /0.9945≈11.06

Thus, 121 + y²≈122.33, so y²≈1.33, y≈1.15.

Then, BC=2y≈2.3.

But in triangle BDC, sides BD=1, DC≈sqrt(y²/4 +1)=sqrt(0.33/4 +1)=sqrt(1.0825)=≈1.04, and BC≈2.3.

Thus, sides 1,1.04,2.3.

But in triangle BDC, angles should satisfy angle BDC=3 theta≈19.75°, angle DBC≈(180 -6.5)/2≈86.75°, angle at C≈76.5°, but in reality, it's 19.75°, which conflicts, so not correct.

Thus, my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps take another approach.

Let me consider triangle ABC with AB=AC, altitude AM=11, D on AM such that AD=10, DM=1, angle BDC=3 angle BAC.

Let me denote angle BAC=theta, so angle BDC=3 theta.

From triangle ABC, angle BAC=theta, so angle at B= (180 - theta)/2.

In triangle BDC, angle BDC=3 theta, angle DBC=(180 - theta)/2, so angle BCD=180 -3 theta - (180 - theta)/2= (180 - 3 theta -90 + theta/2)=90 -5 theta/2.

Thus, angles in triangle BDC:

angle BDC=3 theta, angle DBC=(180 - theta)/2, angle BCD=90 -5 theta/2.

Thus, using Law of Sines:

BD / sin(angle BCD)=DC / sin(angle DBC)=BC / sin(angle BDC)

So,

1 / sin(90 -5 theta/2)= sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin((180 - theta)/2)=2y / sin(3 theta)

From first ratio:

1 / cos(5 theta/2)= sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)

Thus,

sqrt(y²/4 +1)= sin(3 theta)/cos(5 theta/2)

From second ratio:

sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)=2y / sin(theta)

So,

sqrt(y²/4 +1)= 2y sin(3 theta)/ sin(theta)

But sin(3 theta)=3 sin(theta)-4 sin^3(theta)

Thus,

sqrt(y²/4 +1)= 2y (3 sin(theta)-4 sin^3(theta))/ sin(theta)=2y (3 -4 sin²(theta))

Thus,

sqrt(y²/4 +1)=6 y -8 y sin²(theta)

Let me denote s= sin(theta), so sin(theta)=s, cos(theta)=sqrt(1 -s²)

Then,

sqrt(y²/4 +1)=6 y -8 y s²

Square both sides:

y²/4 +1=36 y² - 96 y³ s² +64 y² s^4

Bring all terms to left:

y²/4 +1 -36 y² +96 y³ s² -64 y² s^4=0

Divide by y²:

1/4 + (1/y²) -36 +96 y s² -64 s^4=0

But s²=1 -cos²(theta)=1 - (1 -2 sin²(theta/2))²=1 - [1 -4 sin²(theta/2) +4 sin^4(theta/2)]=4 sin²(theta/2) -4 sin^4(theta/2)

But s= sin(theta)=2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

Thus, s²=4 sin²(theta/2) cos²(theta/2)

s^4=16 sin^4(theta/2) cos^4(theta/2)

Thus,

96 y s²=96 y *4 sin²(theta/2) cos²(theta/2)=384 y sin²(theta/2) cos²(theta/2)

64 s^4=64*16 sin^4(theta/2) cos^4(theta/2)=1024 y^4 sin^4(theta/2) cos^4(theta/2)

Wait, but this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps set t=theta/2, so theta=2t.

Then, sin(theta)=2 sin t cos t

s²=4 sin² t cos² t

s^4=16 sin^4 t cos^4 t

Thus, expression:

y²/4 +1=36 y -96 y*(4 sin² t cos² t) +64 y*(16 sin^4 t cos^4 t)

=36 y -384 y sin² t cos² t +1024 y sin^4 t cos^4 t

Bring all terms to left:

y²/4 +1 -36 y +384 y sin² t cos² t -1024 y sin^4 t cos^4 t=0

This seems even more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps give up and consider that the triangle is such that AB=AC=11, but that doesn't seem.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is 11,11,22? But then angle BAC=180°, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is such that AM=11, DM=1, so AM=AD + DM=10 +1=11, which is given.

Wait, but in triangle ABC, AM is the altitude, so AM=11 is given.

In triangle BDC, angle BDC=3 angle BAC.

Suppose angle BAC= theta, angle BDC=3 theta.

In triangle ABC, sides AB=AC=c, BC=2y, altitude AM=11, so area=(1/2)*2y*11=11 y.

Also, area=(1/2)*c^2 sin(theta)=11 y.

Thus, c^2 sin(theta)=22 y.

But c= sqrt(121 + y²)

Thus, (121 + y²) sin(theta)=22 y

Thus, sin(theta)=22 y/(121 + y²)

Also, in triangle BDC, angle BDC=3 theta, sides BD=1, DC= sqrt(y²/4 +1), BC=2y.

Law of Sines:

1 / sin(angle BCD)= sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)=2y / sin(3 theta)

But angle BCD=90 -5 theta/2.

Thus,

1 / sin(90 -5 theta/2)= sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)

Which gives:

1 / cos(5 theta/2)= sqrt(y²/4 +1)/ sin(3 theta)

Thus,

sqrt(y²/4 +1)= sin(3 theta)/ cos(5 theta/2)

But sin(3 theta)=3 sin(theta)-4 sin^3(theta)

So,

sqrt(y²/4 +1)= (3 sin(theta)-4 sin^3(theta))/ cos(5 theta/2)

But sin(theta)=22 y/(121 + y²)

Thus,

sqrt(y²/4 +1)= [3*(22 y/(121 + y²)) -4*(22 y/(121 + y²))^3 ] / cos(5 theta/2)

This is too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution.

Let me set u= theta/2, so theta=2u, so cos(5 theta/2)=cos(5u)

Then, sin(theta)=sin(2u)=2 sin u cos u

Thus,

sqrt(y²/4 +1)= [3*(2 sin u cos u) -4*(2 sin u cos u)^3 ] / cos(5u)

= [6 sin u cos u -32 sin^3 u cos^3 u ] / cos(5u)

But this is still complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps assign numerical value.

Assume y=11, then sin(theta)=22*11/(121 +121)=242/242=1, so theta=90°, angle BAC=90°, angle BDC=270°, which is impossible.

Thus, y must be less than 11.

Let me try y=7.

Then, sin(theta)=22*7/(121 +49)=154/170≈0.9059

So, theta≈64.7°, angle BAC≈64.7°, angle BDC≈194.1°, which is impossible.

Wait, too big.

Alternatively, try y=5.

sin(theta)=22*5/(121 +25)=110/146≈0.7546

Thus, theta≈48.9°, angle BDC≈146.7°, which is possible.

Compute y=5.

So, BC=2y=10.

Compute y=5.

Thus, BC=10.

Compute z=cos^2(phi)=cos^2(theta/2)=cos^2(24.45°)= approx cos²(24.45°)= approx (0.91)^2≈0.8281.

Thus, z≈0.8281.

So, y= sqrt(z)/ (2 cos(5 phi))= sqrt(0.8281)/ (2 cos(122.25°))≈0.91 / (2*(-0.525))≈0.91 / (-1.05)≈-0.866, which is negative, impossible.

Thus, invalid.

Thus, y=5 invalid.

Wait, y= sqrt(11),≈3.316.

Then, sin(theta)=22*sqrt(11)/(121 +11)=22*3.316/(132)= approx72.95/132≈0.553.

Thus, theta≈33.5°, angle BDC≈100.5°, which is possible.

Compute y= sqrt(11).

Compute y= sqrt(11).

Thus, BC=2 sqrt(11).

Compute z=cos^2(theta/2)=cos^2(2u)=cos²(33.5°)=approx (0.834)^2≈0.695.

Thus, y= sqrt(z)/(2 cos(5u))=sqrt(0.695)/(2 cos(167.5°))≈0.833/(2*(-0.990))≈0.833/(-1.980)≈-0.42, negative, invalid.

Thus, y= sqrt(11) invalid.

Alternatively, take y= sqrt(13)

Then, sin(theta)=22 sqrt(13)/(121 +13)=22*3.6055/134≈79.32/134≈0.592.

Thus, theta≈36.3°, angle BDC≈109.1°, which is possible.

Compute y= sqrt(13).

Then, z=cos^2(theta/2)=cos²(36.3°)=approx(0.807)^2≈0.651

Thus, y= sqrt(z)/(2 cos(5u))=sqrt(0.651)/(2 cos(70.5°))≈0.807/(2*0.348)≈0.807/0.696≈1.15, which is y= sqrt(13)≈3.605, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps take the equation:

sqrt(y²/4 +1)= sin(3 theta)/ cos(5 theta/2)

But sin(3 theta)=3 sin(theta)-4 sin^3(theta)

Let me denote t=theta.

Thus,

sqrt(y²/4 +1)= (3 sin t -4 sin^3 t)/ cos(5t/2)

But sin t=22 y/(121 + y²)

Thus,

sqrt(y²/4 +1)= [3*(22 y/(121 + y²)) -4*(22 y/(121 + y²))^3 ] / cos(5t/2)

But t=2u, so 5t/2=5u.

But also, from sin t=22 y/(121 + y²), we have y= sqrt( (121 + y²) sin² t ) /22.

But this is recursive.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that theta= angle BAC, and angle BDC=3 theta.

Thus, sum of angles in triangle BDC is 180°, so angle DBC=(180 -3 theta)/2.

But in triangle ABC, angle at B is (180 - theta)/2.

Thus, in triangle ABC, angle at B is (180 - theta)/2, and in triangle BDC, angle at B is angle DBC=(180 -3 theta)/2.

But angle at B in triangle ABC is same as angle at B in triangle BDC.

Wait, no, because in triangle ABC, angle at B is angle ABC, which is equal to (180 - theta)/2.

In triangle BDC, angle at B is angle DBC, which is part of angle ABC.

Thus, angle ABC= angle ABD + angle DBC.

Where angle ABD is angle at B in triangle ABD, which is part of angle ABC.

But without knowing where D is on AM, it's difficult.

Wait, in triangle ABC, point D is on AM, which is an altitude.

Thus, in triangle ABD, angle at B is angle ABD, and in triangle DBC, angle at B is angle DBC.

Thus, angle ABC= angle ABD + angle DBC

But from triangle ABC, angle ABC= (180 - theta)/2.

From triangle BDC, angle DBC=(180 -3 theta)/2.

Thus,

angle ABC= angle ABD + (180 -3 theta)/2= (180 - theta)/2

Thus,

angle ABD= (180 - theta)/2 - (180 -3 theta)/2= [180 - theta -180 +3 theta]/2= (2 theta)/2= theta

Thus, angle ABD= theta

But in triangle ABD, angles at A, B, D sum to 180°.

Thus,

angle at A= angle BAD, angle at B= theta, angle at D=180 - angle BAD - theta

But in triangle ABC, angle at A= angle BAD + angle DAC= angle BAD + angle DAC

But without knowing angle DAC, it's still complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps in triangle ABD, angle ABD= theta, angle BAD= phi, angle ADB=180 - theta - phi.

But without more info, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps note that in triangle ABC, angle BAC= theta, angle ABC= (180 - theta)/2.

In triangle BDC, angle BDC=3 theta, angle DBC=(180 -3 theta)/2.

Thus, angle ABC= angle ABD + angle DBC= theta + (180 -3 theta)/2= (2 theta +180 -3 theta)/2= (180 - theta)/2, which is consistent.

Thus, consistent.

But this doesn't give us new info.

Alternatively, maybe use the Law of Sines in triangle ABC and BDC.

But in triangle ABC:

AB=AC=c= sqrt(121 + y²)

BC=2y

In triangle BDC:

BD=1

DC= sqrt(y²/4 +1)

BC=2y

Thus, from Law of Sines:

AB / sin(angle BDC)= AC / sin(angle ABC)= BC / sin(angle BAC)

Thus,

AB / sin(3 theta)= AC / sin((180 - theta)/2)= BC / sin(theta)

But AB=AC=c, BC=2y.

Thus,

c / sin(3 theta)= c / sin((180 - theta)/2)=2y / sin(theta)

Thus,

From first two ratios:

c / sin(3 theta)= c / sin((180 - theta)/2)

Thus,

sin(3 theta)= sin((180 - theta)/2)

Thus,

3 theta= (180 - theta)/2 +360 n or 3 theta= pi - (180 - theta)/2 +360 n

But 3 theta must be between 0 and 540°, for triangle.

But since theta is an angle in triangle, it's less than 180°, so 3 theta <540°.

But likely, it's in the first case:

3 theta= (180 - theta)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

6 theta=180 - theta

7 theta=180

theta=180/7≈25.7°, angle BAC≈25.7°, angle BDC≈77.1°, angle DBC≈(180 -77.1)/2≈51.45°, which is possible.

Thus, theta=180/7≈25.714°, angle BAC=180/7, angle BDC=540/7≈77.14°, angle DBC≈51.428°, angle BDC=3 angle BAC.

Thus, this is consistent.

Thus, angle BAC=180/7°, angle BDC=540/7°, angle DBC≈51.428°, which is 3*25.714≈77.142°, consistent.

Thus, given theta=180/7°, angle BAC=180/7°, which is approx25.714°, then c=AB=AC= sqrt(121 + y²)

From triangle ABC, area=11 y= (1/2)*2y*c sin(theta)= y c sin(theta)

Thus,

11 y= y c sin(theta)

Divide both sides by y:

11= c sin(theta)

Thus,

c=11 / sin(theta)=11 / sin(180/7°)

Compute sin(180/7°)=sin(25.714°)≈0.4384

Thus,

c≈11 /0.4384≈24.93

Thus, c≈24.93, so y= sqrt(c² -121)=sqrt(24.93² -121)=sqrt(621.4 -121)=sqrt(500.4)≈22.39

Thus, y≈22.39

Thus, BC=2y≈44.78

Thus, the sides are AB=AC≈24.93, BC≈44.78, and AM=11.

But in triangle ABC, altitude AM=11, so area=11*22.39≈246.69

Area= (1/2)*2y*c sin(theta)= (1/2)*2y*c sin(180/7°)= y c sin(180/7°)

From earlier, y≈22.39, c≈24.93, sin(180/7°)≈0.4384

Thus, y c sin(theta)=22.39*24.93*0.4384≈22.39*10.81≈242.3

But area=11 y≈11*22.39≈246.69

Thus, there's a discrepancy of≈4.39.

Thus, approximate value is close but not exact.

Thus, with angle BAC=180/7°, angle BDC=540/7°, angle DBC= (180 -540/7)/2= (1260/7 -540/7)/2= (720/7)/2=360/7≈51.428°, this seems consistent.

But the exact value is messy.

Alternatively, perhaps with angle BAC=105°, angle BDC=315°, but that is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps angle BAC=30°, angle BDC=90°, but then in triangle BDC, angle DBC=45°, which is possible.

But in this case, BC=2y, and triangle ABC with angle BAC=30°, altitude AM=11.

Compute sides:

In triangle ABC, angle BAC=30°, AM=11 is the altitude.

Thus, in triangle ABC, area= (1/2)*2y*11=11 y.

Also, area= (1/2)*AB*AC*sin(30°)= (1/2)*c²*(0.5)=c²/4.

Thus, 11 y= c² /4.

Also, in triangle ABC, c²=121 + y².

Thus,

11 y= (121 + y²)/4

Multiply both sides by 4:

44 y=121 + y²

Thus,

y² -44 y +121=0

Solve:

y=(44 ±sqrt(1936 -484))/2=(44 ±sqrt(1452))/2=(44 ±2 sqrt(363))/2=22 ±sqrt(363)

But sqrt(363)=sqrt(121*3)=11 sqrt(3)≈19.052

Thus, y=22 ±19.052

Thus, y≈41.052 or y≈2.948

But in triangle ABC, y must be less than 11, as AM is the altitude.

Thus, y≈2.948

Thus, BC=2y≈5.896

Compute c= sqrt(121 + y²)=sqrt(121 +8.72)=sqrt(129.72)≈11.38

Thus, sides:

AB=AC≈11.38, BC≈5.896, AM=11.

Check in triangle BDC:

BD=1, DC= sqrt(y²/4 +1)=sqrt(8.72/4 +1)=sqrt(2.18 +1)=sqrt(3.18)≈1.784

BC=5.896

Law of Sines:

BD / sin(angle BCD)= DC / sin(angle DBC)= BC / sin(angle BDC)

Thus,

1 / sin(angle BCD)=1.784 / sin(angle DBC)=5.896 / sin(3 theta)

But angle BCD= angle BCD= angle BAC - angle DAC= angle BAC - something.

Alternatively, perhaps compute angle BCD.

In triangle ABC, angle BAC=30°, angle ABC=(180 -30)/2=75°, angle ACB=75°

In triangle BDC, angle BDC=90°, so angle BCD=90°, angle DBC=45°, angle BDC=90°, angle DBC=45°, angle BCD=45°

Thus, angle BCD=45°, angle DBC=45°, angle BDC=90°, which is 3 theta=3*30=90°, consistent.

Thus, theta=30°, angle BAC=30°, angle BDC=90°, angle DBC=45°, angle BCD=45°, which is consistent.

Thus, this is a valid case.

Thus, with angle BAC=30°, angle BDC=90°, angle DBC=45°, angle ABC=75°, which is (180 -30)/2=75°, and BC=5.896, which is 2y≈5.896, so y≈2.948.

Thus, in this case, y= sqrt(363 -121)=sqrt(242)=11 sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)=11*sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)=11.

Wait, no.

Wait, y=22 ±11 sqrt(3). Wait, no.

Wait, from above, y=22 ±11 sqrt(3). But that's not matching.

Wait, in this case, y=22 ±11 sqrt(3). Wait, 11 sqrt(3)=19.052, so 22 -19.052≈2.948, which is the approximate value.

Thus, exact value is y=22 -11 sqrt(3)≈2.948.

Thus, exact value of y=22 -11 sqrt(3).

Thus, BC=2y=44 -22 sqrt(3)

Thus, the sides are AB=AC= sqrt(121 + y²)=sqrt(121 + (22 -11 sqrt(3))²)

Compute (22 -11 sqrt(3))²=22² -2*22*11 sqrt(3) + (11 sqrt(3))²=484 - 484 sqrt(3) + 363=847 -484 sqrt(3)

Thus, AB=AC= sqrt(121 +847 -484 sqrt(3))=sqrt(968 -484 sqrt(3))

Simplify sqrt(968 -484 sqrt(3)).

Factor 4: sqrt(4*(242 -121 sqrt(3)) )=2 sqrt(242 -121 sqrt(3))

But 242=2*121=2*11², 121=11².

Thus, 242 -121 sqrt(3)=121*(2 - sqrt(3))

Thus, sqrt(242 -121 sqrt(3))=11 sqrt(2 - sqrt(3))

Thus, AB=AC=2*11 sqrt(2 - sqrt(3))=22 sqrt(2 - sqrt(3))

Thus, AB=AC=22 sqrt(2 - sqrt(3)), BC=44 -22 sqrt(3)

But compute sqrt(2 - sqrt(3)).

Note that sqrt(2 - sqrt(3))=sqrt( (sqrt(3)/2 )² + (1/2)^2 - 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*(1/2)*cos(15°) )=, but not helpful.

Alternatively, rationalize.

Alternatively, perhaps express sqrt(2 - sqrt(3))=sqrt(a) - sqrt(b)

Let sqrt(2 - sqrt(3))=sqrt(a) - sqrt(b), then square both sides:

2 - sqrt(3)=a + b -2 sqrt(ab)

Thus, equate:

a + b=2

-2 sqrt(ab)= -sqrt(3)=> sqrt(ab)=sqrt(3)/2=>ab=3/4

Thus, a + b=2, ab=3/4.

Thus, quadratic equation: x² -2x + 3/4=0.

Solution:

x=(2 ±sqrt(4 -3))/2= (2 ±1)/2=3/2 or 1/2.

Thus, a=3/2, b=1/2, sqrt(2 - sqrt(3))=sqrt(3/2) - sqrt(1/2)=sqrt(3)/sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2)= (sqrt(3)-1)/sqrt(2)

Thus,

sqrt(2 - sqrt(3))=(sqrt(3)-1)/sqrt(2)

Thus,

AB=AC=22*(sqrt(3)-1)/sqrt(2)=11 sqrt(2)*(sqrt(3)-1)

Thus, AB=AC=11 sqrt(2)(sqrt(3)-1)

Thus, the exact sides are AB=AC=11 sqrt(2)(sqrt(3)-1), BC=44 -22 sqrt(3)

Thus, sides are AB=AC=11 sqrt(2)(sqrt(3)-1), BC=44 -22 sqrt(3), AM=11.

Therefore, the sides of the triangle are AB=AC=11√2(√3−1), BC=44−22√3, and AM=11.

**Final Answer**
The sides of the triangle are $\boxed{11\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{3} - 1)}$, $\boxed{11\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{3} - 1)}$, and $\boxed{44 - 22\sqrt{3}}$.

Given triangle \(ABC\) with an altitude \(AM\) such that \(AM = 11\), and \(D\) is a point on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 1\) and \(\angle BAC = \angle BDC\), we need to find the sides of the triangle \(ABC\).

1. **Identify Key Points and Angles**:
   - \(AM\) is the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\), so \(AM \perp BC\).
   - \(D\) is on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 1\) and \(DM = 10\).
   - \(\angle BAC = \angle BDC = \theta\).

2. **Triangle Properties and Relationships**:
   - In triangle \(ABC\), \(AM = 11\) is the altitude, so \(BC = 2y\).
   - \(BD = 1\) and \(DC = \sqrt{y^2/4 + 1}\).
   - In triangle \(BDC\), using the Law of Sines and the given condition \(\angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC\), we derive the relationships between the sides and angles.

3. **Solving for the Sides**:
   - Using the given condition and trigonometric identities, we find that \(\theta = 30^\circ\).
   - The sides of the triangle are calculated using the relationships derived from the trigonometric identities and the given side lengths.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The sides of the triangle are found to be \(AB = AC = 11\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{3} - 1)\) and \(BC = 44 - 22\sqrt{3}\).

Thus, the sides of the triangle are:

\[
\boxed{11\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{3} - 1)}, \boxed{11\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{3} - 1)}, \text{ and } \boxed{44 - 22\sqrt{3}}
\]
