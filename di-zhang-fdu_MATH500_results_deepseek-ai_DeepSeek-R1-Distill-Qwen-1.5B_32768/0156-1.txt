Correct Answer:
Since $\angle BCA = 40^\circ$ and $\triangle ADC$ is isosceles with $AD=DC,$ we know $\angle DAC=\angle ACD=40^\circ.$

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\circ,$ we have \begin{align*}
\angle ADC &= 180^\circ - \angle DAC - \angle ACD \\
&= 180^\circ - 40^\circ - 40^\circ \\
&= 100^\circ.
\end{align*}Since $\angle ADB$ and $\angle ADC$ are supplementary, we have  \begin{align*}
\angle ADB &= 180^\circ - \angle ADC \\
&= 180^\circ - 100^\circ \\
&= 80^\circ.
\end{align*}Since $\triangle ADB$ is isosceles with $AD=DB,$ we have $\angle BAD = \angle ABD.$ Thus, \begin{align*}
\angle BAD &= \frac{1}{2}(180^\circ - \angle ADB) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}(180^\circ - 80^\circ) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}(100^\circ) \\
&= 50^\circ.
\end{align*}Therefore,  \begin{align*}
\angle BAC &= \angle BAD + \angle DAC \\
&= 50^\circ+40^\circ \\
&= \boxed{90^\circ}.
\end{align*}

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says that in the diagram, AD = BD = CD, and angle BCA is 40 degrees. I need to find the measure of angle BAC. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me try to visualize the diagram based on the Asymptote code. It seems like there are points A, B, C, D with D in the middle between B and C. So, points B, D, and C are colinear, with D exactly halfway between B and C. That means BD = DC. Also, AD = BD, so AD is equal to BD, which is equal to DC. Interesting.

Wait, so AD = BD = DC. That suggests that D is equidistant from A, B, and C. So, D is the circumcenter of triangle ABC? Because the circumcenter is the point equidistant from all three vertices. However, in this case, D is on BC. Hmm, that might not necessarily be the case unless triangle ABC is such that its circumcenter lies on BC.

But maybe I don't need to assume that. Let me think. Maybe I can use triangle properties or some circle theorems here.

Given that AD = BD = CD, so D is equidistant from A, B, and C, but it's on BC. So, D is the intersection of BC and the circumcircle of triangle ABC? Or maybe D is the midpoint of BC because BD = DC? Wait, the problem says BD = CD, so D is the midpoint of BC. So, BD = DC. Also, AD = BD.

So, triangle ABD and triangle ADC have sides AD = BD = DC. Hmm, maybe triangles ABD and ADC are congruent? Let me see. AD is common to both triangles, BD = DC, but the angles might not be equal. Wait, unless angles at D are equal, but I don't know if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider triangle ABD and triangle CBD. Hmm, AD = BD = CD, so AD = BD, BD = CD, so AD = CD. So, AD = CD. So, triangle ACD is isoceles with AD = CD. Therefore, angles opposite those sides are equal. So, angle at C is equal to angle at A in triangle ACD. Wait, but angle at C is already given as 40 degrees. So, angle at A in triangle ACD is also 40 degrees.

Wait, but angle BAC is part of triangle ABC. Maybe I can find angle BAC by relating it to angle BAC in triangle ABC or triangle ACD.

Wait, let me try to think about triangle ABC. Points A, B, and C. We know angle BCA is 40 degrees, which is angle at C. So, in triangle ABC, angle C is 40 degrees.

Also, since D is the midpoint of BC, BD = DC. And AD = BD. So, AD = DC. So, triangle ADC is isoceles with AD = DC, so angle at A in triangle ADC is equal to angle at C in triangle ADC, which is 40 degrees.

Therefore, angle DAC is 40 degrees. So, angle BAC is angle BAD + angle DAC. So, angle BAC = angle BAD + 40 degrees.

But I don't know angle BAD yet. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can consider triangle ABD. Since AD = BD, triangle ABD is isoceles with angles at A and B equal. So, angle ABD = angle BAD.

But angle ABD is adjacent to angle ABC. Wait, but I don't know angle ABC yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines in some triangles.

Let me try to denote some lengths. Let me let BD = DC = x. Then, AD = BD = x as well.

So, in triangle ABD, sides AB, BD, AD. AB is a side of triangle ABC, BD = x, AD = x.

Similarly, in triangle ADC, sides AD = x, DC = x, and AC is another side.

Wait, maybe I can relate the sides of triangle ABC with the sides of triangles ABD and ADC.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABD and triangle CBD can be considered.

Wait, in triangle ABC, D is the midpoint of BC, so BD = DC. Also, AD = BD. So, triangle ABD is isoceles with AD = BD, so angles opposite those sides are equal.

In triangle ABD, angles at A and B are equal. So, angle BAD = angle ABD.

Similarly, in triangle ADC, which is isoceles with AD = DC, angles at A and C are equal. So, angle DAC = angle DCA.

Wait, angle DCA is part of angle BCA, which is 40 degrees. So, angle DCA is part of 40 degrees.

But angle DCA is equal to angle DAC, as triangle ADC is isoceles.

So, angle DAC = angle DCA.

Therefore, angle DAC = angle DCA.

But angle DCA is part of angle BCA, which is 40 degrees. So, angle DCA is equal to angle DAC, and angle BCA is 40 degrees, which is angle DCA + angle BCA?

Wait, no. Wait, angle BCA is angle at C, which is angle DCA. Because D is on BC. So, angle DCA is part of angle BCA. So, angle DCA is equal to angle DAC.

Wait, so angle DCA = angle DAC.

But angle BCA is 40 degrees, which includes angle DCA and angle something else? Wait, no, angle BCA is angle at C, which is adjacent to D as D is on BC.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the points. Let me see: points are labeled as A, B, C, D. The Asymptote code draws (0,0)--(10,0)--(8.2635,9.8481)--cycle, which is triangle ABD. Then, (10,0)--(20,0)--(8.2635,9.8481), which is triangle DBC. So, points are ordered A-B-D-C-A, forming a triangle. So, D is between B and C, so BD = DC.

Therefore, angle BCA is angle at point C, which is 40 degrees. So, angle at C is 40 degrees, which is angle DCA.

Wait, but D is on BC, so angle DCA is angle at C between DC and CA.

So, in triangle ADC, angle at C is angle DCA, which is equal to angle DAC because triangle ADC is isoceles with AD = DC.

So, angle DAC = angle DCA.

But angle DCA is part of angle BCA, which is 40 degrees. So, angle DCA is equal to angle DAC, and angle BCA is 40 degrees. Therefore, angle DCA + angle BCA = angle BCD? Wait, no. Wait, angle BCA is 40 degrees, which is angle DCA. So, that's just 40 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to assign variables.

Let me denote angle BAC as x, which is what we need to find. So, angle BAC = x degrees.

In triangle ABC, the sum of angles is 180 degrees.

So, angle BAC = x, angle ABC = y, angle BCA = 40 degrees. Therefore, x + y + 40 = 180, so x + y = 140.

So, if I can find y, then I can find x.

Alternatively, if I can find another relationship involving x and y.

Since AD = BD = DC, and BD = DC, so AD = DC. So, triangle ADC is isoceles with AD = DC, so angles at A and C are equal.

So, angle DAC = angle DCA.

But angle DCA is part of angle BCA, which is 40 degrees.

Wait, is angle DCA equal to angle BCA? No, because angle BCA is the angle at point C, which is angle DCA, since D is on BC.

Wait, so angle DCA is equal to angle BCA, which is 40 degrees. So, angle DCA = 40 degrees.

But triangle ADC is isoceles with AD = DC, so angle at A (angle DAC) is equal to angle at C (angle DCA). So, angle DAC = 40 degrees.

Therefore, angle BAC = angle BAD + angle DAC.

But angle BAD is part of angle ABC.

Wait, maybe I can find angle BAD in terms of y.

Wait, in triangle ABD, which is isoceles with AD = BD. So, angle ABD = angle BAD.

Let me denote angle ABD = angle BAD = z degrees.

Therefore, angle ABC = angle ABD + angle DBC.

But angle DBC is part of triangle DBC, which is another isoceles triangle with BD = DC.

Wait, triangle DBC: BD = DC, so it's isoceles with base BC? Wait, no, BD = DC, so the sides BD and DC are equal, so the base is BC. Therefore, angles at B and C in triangle DBC are equal.

But angle DBC is at point B, and angle DCB is at point C.

Wait, but in triangle DBC, sides BD = DC, so angles opposite those sides are equal. So, angle at D is angle BDC, and angles at B and C are equal.

But angle at B is angle DBC, angle at C is angle DCB.

Wait, angle DCB is part of angle BCA, which is 40 degrees.

So, angle DCB = angle BCA = 40 degrees, as D is on BC.

Wait, so angle DCB = 40 degrees. Therefore, angle DBC is also 40 degrees, since triangle DBC is isoceles with BD = DC, so angles at B and C are equal.

Therefore, angle DBC = angle DCB = 40 degrees.

Therefore, in triangle ABC, angle ABC = angle ABD + angle DBC = angle ABD + 40 degrees.

But angle ABD is equal to angle BAD, which is z degrees. So, angle ABC = z + 40 degrees.

Earlier, we had that x + y = 140, where x is angle BAC and y is angle ABC.

But angle BAC is x, angle ABC is z + 40, and angle BCA is 40.

Therefore, x + (z + 40) + 40 = 180.

So, x + z + 80 = 180, so x + z = 100.

But we also have that angle DAC = angle DCA = 40 degrees.

So, angle BAC is angle BAD + angle DAC = z + 40.

But angle BAC is x, so x = z + 40.

Therefore, from before, x + z = 100, and x = z + 40.

Substituting x = z + 40 into x + z = 100, we get (z + 40) + z = 100.

So, 2z + 40 = 100.

Subtract 40: 2z = 60.

Divide by 2: z = 30.

Therefore, angle BAD = z = 30 degrees.

Therefore, angle BAC = x = z + 40 = 30 + 40 = 70 degrees.

So, the measure of angle BAC is 70 degrees.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So, angle BAC is 70 degrees, angle ABC is z + 40 = 30 + 40 = 70 degrees? Wait, hold on. Wait, no.

Wait, angle ABC is z + 40, which is 30 + 40 = 70 degrees. But angle BAC is 70 degrees, so angle ABC and angle BAC would both be 70 degrees, which would make angle BCA = 40 degrees, summing up to 180. So, 70 + 70 + 40 = 180. That's correct.

Wait, but hold on, in triangle ABC, sides AB, BC, and AC. If angle BAC is 70 degrees, angle ABC is 70 degrees, then sides opposite to these angles would be equal. So, side BC would be equal to side AC. But does that make sense?

Wait, in triangle ABC, side BC is opposite angle A (70 degrees), and side AC is opposite angle B (70 degrees). So, yes, sides BC and AC would be equal. So, triangle ABC would be isoceles with BC = AC.

But from the Asymptote code, points A, B, D, C are connected in a specific way. Hmm, maybe that's a red herring.

Wait, but in the problem, it's given that AD = BD = CD. So, triangle ABD is isoceles with AD = BD, triangle ADC is isoceles with AD = DC, which we used.

So, I think my reasoning is correct. So, angle BAC is 70 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The measure of $\angle BAC$ is $\boxed{70}$ degrees.
</think>

Given the diagram where \(AD = BD = CD\) and \(\angle BCA = 40^\circ\), we need to find the measure of \(\angle BAC\).

1. **Identify Key Points and Relationships:**
   - Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are such that \(D\) is the midpoint of \(BC\) because \(BD = DC\).
   - \(AD = BD = CD\) implies \(D\) is the circumcenter of \(\triangle ABC\).
   - Triangle \(ADC\) is isosceles with \(AD = DC\), so \(\angle DAC = \angle DCA\).

2. **Analyze Angles:**
   - Since \(\angle BCA = 40^\circ\), which is part of \(\angle DCA\), we have \(\angle DCA = 40^\circ\).
   - Therefore, \(\angle DAC = 40^\circ\) because \(\triangle ADC\) is isosceles.

3. **Sum of Angles in Triangle \(ABC\):**
   - Let \(\angle BAC = x\) and \(\angle ABC = y\).
   - In \(\triangle ABC\), the sum of angles is \(180^\circ\):
     \[
     x + y + 40^\circ = 180^\circ \implies x + y = 140^\circ
     \]

4. **Relate Angles Using Isosceles Triangles:**
   - In \(\triangle ABD\), since \(AD = BD\), \(\angle ABD = \angle BAD\).
   - Let \(\angle ABD = \angle BAD = z\). Then, \(\angle ABC = z + 40^\circ\).
   - In \(\triangle ABC\), \(\angle ABC = z + 40^\circ\).

5. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the sum of angles:
     \[
     x + (z + 40^\circ) = 140^\circ \implies x + z = 100^\circ
     \]
   - Since \(\angle BAC = x\) and \(\angle DAC = 40^\circ\), we have:
     \[
     x = z + 40^\circ
     \]

6. **Solve for \(z\):**
   - Substitute \(x = z + 40^\circ\) into \(x + z = 100^\circ\):
     \[
     (z + 40^\circ) + z = 100^\circ \implies 2z + 40^\circ = 100^\circ \implies 2z = 60^\circ \implies z = 30^\circ
     \]

7. **Find \(\angle BAC\):**
   - Substitute \(z = 30^\circ\) into \(x = z + 40^\circ\):
     \[
     x = 30^\circ + 40^\circ = 70^\circ
     \]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle BAC\) is \(\boxed{70}\) degrees.
