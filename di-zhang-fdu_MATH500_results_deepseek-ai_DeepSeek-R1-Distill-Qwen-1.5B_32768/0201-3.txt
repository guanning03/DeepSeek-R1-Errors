Question:
The asymptotes of a hyperbola are $y = 2x - 3$ and $y = 17 - 2x.$  Also, the hyperbola passes through the point $(4,7).$  Find the distance between the foci of the hyperbola.

Correct Answer:
The intersection of the asymptotes is $(5,7),$ so this is the center of the hyperbola.  Since the slopes of the asymptotes are $\pm 2,$ the equation of the hyperbola can be written in the form
\[(x - 5)^2 - \frac{(y - 7)^2}{4} = d\]for some constant $d.$  Setting $x = 4$ and $y = 7,$ we get $d = 1,$ so the equation is
\[\frac{(x - 5)^2}{1} - \frac{(y - 7)^2}{4} = 1.\]Then $a^2 = 1$ and $b^2 = 4,$ so $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 5,$ which means $c = \sqrt{5}.$  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = \boxed{2 \sqrt{5}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to find the distance between the foci of a hyperbola. The problem gives me the equations of the asymptotes and a point that the hyperbola passes through. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the asymptotes of a hyperbola are the lines that the hyperbola approaches but never touches. For a standard hyperbola, the asymptotes can help determine the equation of the hyperbola. Since the hyperbola is not necessarily aligned with the axes, I might need to consider it in a general form.

Given the asymptotes: y = 2x - 3 and y = 17 - 2x. Let me rewrite them in a standard form. The first one is already in slope-intercept form, so I can write it as y = 2x - 3. The second one is y = -2x + 17. So, the slopes are 2 and -2. Hmm, that suggests that the hyperbola is rotated because the asymptotes have slopes that are negative reciprocals only if it was a rectangular hyperbola, but here they are different. So, it's not a standard horizontal or vertical hyperbola.

I think the general equation of a hyperbola can be written as:

Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey + F = 0

Given that the asymptotes are y = 2x - 3 and y = -2x + 17, I can find the equation of the hyperbola by using the asymptotes. The equation of a hyperbola with given asymptotes can be derived by noting that any point (x, y) on the hyperbola satisfies the equation:

(y - (2x - 3))(y - (-2x + 17)) = k

Where k is a constant. This is because the product of the distances from any point on the hyperbola to each asymptote is constant, equal to the square of the semi-minor axis for hyperbolas.

So, let me compute that product:

(y - 2x + 3)(y + 2x - 17) = k

Let me expand this expression:

First, multiply (y - 2x + 3) and (y + 2x - 17):

= y(y + 2x - 17) - 2x(y + 2x - 17) + 3(y + 2x - 17)

Let's compute each part:

= y² + 2xy - 17y - 2xy - 4x² + 34x + 3y + 6x - 51

Now, combine like terms:

- The y² term: y²

- The xy terms: 2xy - 2xy = 0

- The x² term: -4x²

- The y terms: -17y + 3y = -14y

- The x terms: 34x + 6x = 40x

- The constant term: -51

So, putting it all together:

y² - 4x² - 14y + 40x - 51 = k

Let me rearrange this into the standard form:

-4x² + y² + 40x - 14y - 51 - k = 0

Hmm, to write it in standard form, I need to complete the squares for both x and y.

First, group the x terms and y terms:

(-4x² + 40x) + (y² - 14y) = 51 + k

Factor out the coefficients of the squared terms:

-4(x² - 10x) + (y² - 14y) = 51 + k

Now, complete the square for x² - 10x:

Take half of -10, which is -5, square it, we get 25.

Similarly, for y² - 14y:

Take half of -14, which is -7, square it, we get 49.

So, add these squares inside the equation:

-4(x² - 10x + 25) + (y² - 14y + 49) = 51 + k + 4*25 + 49

Calculate the constants on the right side:

4*25 is 100, 49 is 49, so 100 + 49 = 149.

Thus, the equation becomes:

-4(x - 5)² + (y - 7)² = 51 + k + 149

Simplify the right side:

51 + 149 = 200, so:

-4(x - 5)² + (y - 7)² = 200 + k

Hmm, let me denote 200 + k as another constant, say C.

So, -4(x - 5)² + (y - 7)² = C

But since the standard hyperbola equation is of the form (y - h)²/a² - (x - k)²/b² = 1, I can rearrange this:

(y - 7)² / a² - (x - 5)² / (C/4) = 1

Wait, but the left side is (-4(x -5)^2 + (y -7)^2) = C, so moving everything to one side:

(y - 7)^2 -4(x -5)^2 = C

To write this as (y - 7)^2 / a^2 - (x -5)^2 / b^2 = 1, I need to factor out the coefficients:

Divide both sides by C:

[(y - 7)^2]/(C) - [4(x -5)^2]/(C) = 1

Which simplifies to:

[(y - 7)^2]/(C) - [(x -5)^2]/(C/4) = 1

So, here, a² = C and b² = C/4, so a² = 4b².

But wait, in standard hyperbola, the transverse axis is along the direction with the positive term. So, since it's (y -7)^2, it's along the y-axis, meaning the hyperbola opens up and down.

But in our case, the asymptotes are y = 2x -3 and y = -2x +17, which are not horizontal or vertical lines, so the hyperbola is rotated.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake. Because if the hyperbola is rotated, the standard form with terms in x and y is different. So, perhaps my initial approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the hyperbola is centered at the intersection point of the asymptotes.

Let me find the center by solving the two asymptotes:

Set 2x - 3 = -2x + 17

So, 2x + 2x = 17 + 3

4x = 20

x = 5

Substitute back into one of the equations, say y = 2x -3:

y = 2*5 -3 = 10 -3 =7

So, the center is at (5,7). Okay, that's good.

So, the hyperbola is centered at (5,7). Now, the hyperbola passes through the point (4,7). Let me note that the point (4,7) is on the hyperbola, which is also on the line y = 7, which is one of the asymptotes. Wait, actually, in our earlier equation, (y -7)^2 -4(x -5)^2 = C, plugging in (4,7):

(7 -7)^2 -4*(4 -5)^2 = 0 -4*(1) = -4 = C

So, C = -4.

Therefore, the equation is:

(y -7)^2 -4(x -5)^2 = -4

Divide both sides by -4 to write it in standard form:

[(y -7)^2]/(-4*(-1)) - [(x -5)^2]/(1) =1

Wait, let's do that step carefully.

Starting from (y -7)^2 -4(x -5)^2 = -4

Divide both sides by -4:

[(y -7)^2]/(-4) - [(x -5)^2]/(-1) =1

Which simplifies to:

[(y -7)^2]/(-4) - [(x -5)^2]/(-1) =1

Wait, that can't be right because dividing by a negative number would change the signs. Hold on, let me do it step by step.

From (y -7)^2 -4(x -5)^2 = -4

Divide both sides by -4:

[(y -7)^2]/(-4) + [(x -5)^2]/(1) =1

Wait, that's better.

So, [(y -7)^2]/(-4) + [(x -5)^2]/(1) =1

Wait, but that would mean the equation is [(x -5)^2]/1 - [(y -7)^2]/4 =1, which is a hyperbola opening left and right, but the original asymptotes were sloped, so perhaps this is a hyperbola rotated.

Wait, no, actually, the standard form would have the positive term first if it's opening left and right, but in our case, the hyperbola is rotated because the asymptotes are not aligned with the axes.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider that the hyperbola is rotated, so it's better to use the general equation without assuming a specific orientation.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach is better.

Given that the hyperbola is centered at (5,7), and passes through (4,7). Let me consider the distance between the center (5,7) and the point (4,7). That distance is 1 unit along the x-axis.

Since (4,7) is on the hyperbola and the center is (5,7), which is 1 unit left of (4,7). So, (4,7) is a vertex or somewhere along the hyperbola.

Wait, in a standard hyperbola, the distance from the center to a vertex is 'a' or 'b', depending on the axis. But in this case, since it's rotated, we need to consider the major and minor axes.

Wait, but earlier we derived the equation [(y -7)^2]/(-4) + [(x -5)^2]/(1) =1, but that would mean a^2 =1 and b^2 = -4, which is impossible because b^2 can't be negative. So, that suggests I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Let me go back. So, the hyperbola's equation is:

(y -7)^2 -4(x -5)^2 = -4

Let me rewrite it as:

4(x -5)^2 - (y -7)^2 =4

Divide both sides by 4:

(x -5)^2 - [(y -7)^2]/4 =1

So, now it's in standard form. So, the center is (5,7), the term with x is positive, so it's a hyperbola opening left and right, but with asymptotes y = 2x -3 and y = -2x +17.

So, now, since it's opening left and right, the transverse axis is horizontal.

But earlier, we saw that the asymptotes have slopes 2 and -2, so the relationship between a and b is such that for a horizontal hyperbola, the slopes are ±(a/b). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, for a standard hyperbola, the slopes of the asymptotes are ±(a/b). So, in this case, since the hyperbola is opening left and right, the slopes are ±(a/b). Given the slopes are 2 and -2, so 2 = a/b, so a/b=2, which means a=2b.

So, in standard form, the equation is (x - h)^2 / a^2 - (y - k)^2 / b^2 =1, with asymptotes y = k ± (a/b)(x - h). Which matches the given asymptotes.

So, in our case, h=5, k=7, a=2b.

So, the standard form is (x -5)^2 / (4b^2) - (y -7)^2 / b^2 =1

But earlier, we had (x -5)^2 - [(y -7)^2]/4 =1, so that's equivalent.

Wait, so 1/(4b^2) =1/4, which implies 4b^2=4, so b^2=1, so b=1, and a=2b=2.

So, the standard form is (x -5)^2 /4 - (y -7)^2 /1 =1

So, that's our hyperbola.

Now, the hyperbola passes through the point (4,7). Let me check if that's true.

Plug (4,7) into the equation:

(4 -5)^2 /4 - (7 -7)^2 /1 = (1)/4 - 0 = 1/4 ≠1

Wait, that can't be. So, if I plug (4,7) into the standard form, it's 1/4 -0=1/4, which is not equal to 1. So, perhaps the point (4,7) is not on the hyperbola? But the problem says it does.

Wait, so maybe my earlier assumption that it's (x -5)^2 /4 - (y -7)^2 /1 =1 is wrong because the hyperbola must pass through (4,7), but when plugging (4,7), it doesn't satisfy the equation.

So, my mistake must be in the derivation.

Wait, let me recap:

We started with the asymptotes, wrote the equation as (y -2x +3)(y +2x -17)=k, then expanded to get a quadratic equation, then completed the square to write it in standard form, but perhaps I messed up in the sign when moving terms.

Wait, let me try again.

Starting with (y -2x +3)(y +2x -17) =k

Expanding:

= y^2 + 2xy -17y -2xy -4x² +34x +3y +6x -51

Combine like terms:

y² + (2xy -2xy) + (-4x²) + (-17y +3y) + (34x +6x) -51

Simplify:

y² -4x² -14y +40x -51 =k

So, bringing k to the left:

y² -4x² -14y +40x -51 -k =0

Wait, I think previously I had a negative sign, but maybe I should have:

(y -2x +3)(y +2x -17) = k

So, it's y² +2xy -17y -2xy -4x² +34x +3y +6x -51=k

Which simplifies to y² -4x² -14y +40x -51=k

Then, moving k to the left:

y² -4x² -14y +40x -51 -k=0

So, that's correct.

Then, grouping x and y terms:

-4x² + y² +40x -14y -51 -k=0

Factor out coefficients:

-4(x² -10x) + (y² -14y) =51 +k

Then, complete the square:

For x: x² -10x, take half of -10, which is -5, square it to get 25.

For y: y² -14y, take half of -14, which is -7, square it to get 49.

So, add 25 and 49 inside the equation:

-4(x² -10x +25) + (y² -14y +49) =51 +k +4*25 +49

Calculate the constants:

4*25=100, 49 is 49, so 100+49=149

So, 51 +k +149=200 +k

Thus, the equation becomes:

-4(x -5)^2 + (y -7)^2 =200 +k

So, this is correct.

Then, to write in standard form, divide both sides by (200 +k):

[(y -7)^2]/(200 +k) - [4(x -5)^2]/(200 +k) =1

Which can be written as:

[(y -7)^2]/(200 +k) - [(x -5)^2]/[(200 +k)/4] =1

So, the standard form is [(y -7)^2]/A - [(x -5)^2]/B =1, where A=200 +k and B=(200 +k)/4.

So, for a hyperbola, the relationship between A and B is A = c² and B = b², but actually, in standard form, for horizontal hyperbola, it is A = a² and B = b², with asymptotes slope ±a/b.

Wait, in standard form, the slopes of the asymptotes are ±(a/b). So, in this case, the slopes are ±2, so a/b=2, so a=2b.

But in our case, the standard form is [(y -7)^2]/A - [(x -5)^2]/B =1, so A is a², B is b², and A=4B.

But from the equation, we have A =200 +k and B=(200 +k)/4.

So, A =4B, which is consistent because A =200 +k and B=(200 +k)/4, so A=4B.

Therefore, since a² = A and b² = B, and a=2b, so a²=4b², which matches.

Now, the hyperbola passes through (4,7). So, plug (4,7) into the equation:

[(7 -7)^2]/A - [(4 -5)^2]/B =1

Simplify:

0/A - (1)/B =1

Which is -1/B =1

Thus, -1/B =1 => B = -1

But B is (200 +k)/4, which is equal to -1.

Therefore:

(200 +k)/4 = -1

Multiply both sides by 4:

200 +k = -4

Thus, k = -4 -200 = -204

So, now, A =200 +k =200 -204 = -4

But A is equal to a², which must be positive because it's squared. So, A=-4 is impossible because a² can't be negative.

Wait, so that suggests that my earlier steps have an issue. Because if A=-4, then a²=-4, which is impossible, which implies that my mistake must be in the sign somewhere.

Wait, let me check.

We had (y -7)^2 -4(x -5)^2 = -4

Divide both sides by -4:

[(y -7)^2]/(-4) - [(x -5)^2]/(-1) =1

Which is [(y -7)^2]/(-4) - [(x -5)^2]/(-1) =1

But this would mean that [(y -7)^2]/(-4) is negative, and [(x -5)^2]/(-1) is also negative. So, this is problematic because in standard form, both denominators should be positive.

Wait, perhaps I need to take absolute values? Or maybe I should have considered the equation differently.

Wait, let's go back.

We had (y -7)^2 -4(x -5)^2 = -4

Dividing both sides by -4, we get:

-[(y -7)^2]/4 + (x -5)^2 =1

Which is equivalent to:

(x -5)^2 - [(y -7)^2]/4 =1

So, that's the standard form, which is a hyperbola opening left and right with center at (5,7), a²=1, b²=4, so a=1, b=2.

But in the standard form, the asymptotes should be y = k ± (a/b)(x - h). So, here, a=1, b=2, so slope is ±(1/2). But in our problem, the slopes are 2 and -2.

So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps I have an issue with the direction.

Wait, maybe the hyperbola is opening up and down? Because if a/b=2, then a=2b.

But in our equation, [(y -7)^2]/1 - [(x -5)^2]/4 =1, which is a vertical hyperbola.

Wait, but our asymptotes have slopes ±2, which would mean that for a vertical hyperbola, the slopes are ±(b/a). So, if that's the case, then b/a=2, so b=2a.

But in our equation, it's [(y -7)^2]/1 - [(x -5)^2]/4 =1, so a²=1, b²=4, so b/a=2, which is correct. So, the slopes should be ±(b/a)=±2, which matches.

But then, when we plug in (4,7), which is (h -1, k), so x=4, y=7. So, plugging into the equation:

(7 -7)^2 /1 - (4 -5)^2 /4 = 0 - (1)/4 = -1/4 ≠1

So, that's not equal to 1. Therefore, (4,7) is not on the hyperbola, but the problem says it does.

Wait, that's a problem. So, either I have a mistake in the equation or in the center.

Wait, let's see.

Wait, if the hyperbola passes through (4,7) and is centered at (5,7), with a vertical transverse axis, a²=1, b²=4, so asymptotes are y=7 ± (b/a)(x -5) =7 ± (2)(x -5). So, y=7 +2x -10=2x -3 and y=7 -2x +10=-2x +17. Which are exactly the asymptotes given. So, that's correct.

But then, (4,7) is a point on the hyperbola, but plugging into the equation gives -1/4, not 1. So, that's a contradiction. So, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation of the hyperbola. Let's go back.

Given that the asymptotes are y=2x -3 and y=-2x +17, we can write the equation of the hyperbola as (y - (2x -3))(y - (-2x +17))=k

Which is (y -2x +3)(y +2x -17)=k

Expanding this:

First, multiply y by each term:

y*y = y²

y*(-2x) = -2xy

y*3 =3y

Then, multiply (-2x) by each term:

-2x*y = -2xy

-2x*(-2x)=4x²

-2x*(-17)=34x

Then, multiply 3 by each term:

3*y=3y

3*(-2x)=-6x

3*(-17)=-51

So, adding all terms:

y² -2xy +3y -2xy +4x² +34x +3y -6x -51

Combine like terms:

y² + (-2xy -2xy) + (4x²) + (34x -6x) + (3y +3y) -51

Which is:

y² -4x² +4x² +28x +6y -51

Wait, hold on, 34x -6x is 28x, 4x² -2xy -2xy? Wait, no:

Wait, after expanding, we have y² -2xy +3y -2xy +4x² +34x +3y -6x -51

So, combining like terms:

y²

-2xy -2xy = -4xy

4x²

34x -6x =28x

3y +3y=6y

-51

So, the expanded equation is:

y² -4xy +4x² +28x +6y -51 =k

Wait, so the equation is:

y² -4xy +4x² +28x +6y -51 =k

That's different from what I had before.

Wait, so previously, I had -4x², but now I have +4x².

Wait, so I must have made a mistake in the sign when expanding. So, it's y² -4xy +4x² +28x +6y -51 =k

Then, moving k to the left:

y² -4xy +4x² +28x +6y -51 -k =0

Now, grouping x and y terms:

4x² -4xy + y² +28x +6y -51 -k =0

Hmm, this is a quadratic equation with cross terms.

To write this in standard form, perhaps we can complete the square for x and y, but considering the cross term.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write it as a quadratic form and diagonalize it to eliminate the cross term.

But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, since we know the asymptotes, maybe we can use the method of shifting the coordinate system.

But that seems involved.

Wait, maybe I can factor the equation.

Looking at 4x² -4xy + y², that's (2x - y)^2.

Let me check:

(2x - y)^2 =4x² -4xy + y². Yes, that's correct.

So, the equation becomes:

(2x - y)^2 +28x +6y -51 -k =0

So, (2x - y)^2 +28x +6y =51 +k

Let me set u =2x - y

Then, since u=2x - y, we can express y=2x -u

Plugging into the equation:

u² +28x +6*(2x -u) =51 +k

Simplify:

u² +28x +12x -6u =51 +k

Combine like terms:

u² +40x -6u =51 +k

Now, express x in terms of u and y. But since u=2x -y, we can solve for x:

2x = u + y => x=(u + y)/2

Plugging back into the equation:

u² +40*( (u + y)/2 ) -6u =51 +k

Simplify:

u² +20(u + y) -6u =51 +k

Which is:

u² +20u +20y -6u =51 +k

Combine like terms:

u² +14u +20y =51 +k

Hmm, not sure if this is helpful.

Alternatively, maybe express y in terms of u and x:

From u=2x - y, y=2x - u

Plugging into the equation:

u² +28x +6*(2x -u) =51 +k

Which is:

u² +28x +12x -6u =51 +k

Simplify:

u² +40x -6u =51 +k

But we still have x and u. Maybe it's better to express x in terms of u.

From u=2x - y, and y=2x -u, so substituting into the equation:

u² +28x +6y =51 +k

But y=2x -u, so:

u² +28x +6*(2x -u) =51 +k

Which is:

u² +28x +12x -6u =51 +k

Combine:

u² +40x -6u =51 +k

Now, express x from y=2x -u:

x=(y +u)/2

Wait, but since u=2x - y, perhaps x=(u + y)/2

But I don't know y in terms of u, so maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe another approach. Since the hyperbola passes through (4,7), let's use this point to find k.

So, in the equation:

(2x - y)^2 +28x +6y -51 =k

Plug in x=4, y=7:

(2*4 -7)^2 +28*4 +6*7 -51 =k

Calculate:

(8 -7)^2 =1

28*4=112

6*7=42

So, 1 +112 +42 -51= k

1 +112=113, 113 +42=155, 155 -51=104

Thus, k=104

So, the equation is:

(2x - y)^2 +28x +6y -51 =104

Simplify:

(2x - y)^2 +28x +6y =155

Wait, but earlier, we had:

u² +40x -6u =51 +k

Which with k=104, becomes:

u² +40x -6u =155

But u=2x - y, so plugging back:

(2x - y)^2 +40x -6*(2x - y) =155

Which is:

(2x - y)^2 +40x -12x +6y =155

Simplify:

(2x - y)^2 +28x +6y =155

Which is consistent with what we had earlier.

So, we can write:

(2x - y)^2 +28x +6y =155

But maybe we can express this in terms of (x - h)^2 - (y - k)^2 =1 or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write this as a rotated hyperbola.

Given that it's rotated, perhaps we can write it in terms of a new coordinate system where the axes are not aligned with the original x and y.

Let me try to rotate the coordinate system by an angle θ such that the asymptotes become the coordinate axes.

Given that the original asymptotes are y=2x -3 and y=-2x +17.

The angle θ satisfies tan(2θ) = (m1 - m2)/(1 + m1m2), where m1 and m2 are the slopes of the asymptotes.

Given m1=2, m2=-2.

So, tan(2θ) = (2 - (-2))/(1 + (2)(-2)) =4/(1 -4)=4/(-3)= -4/3

Thus, tan(2θ)= -4/3

So, θ = (1/2) arctan(-4/3)

But arctan(-4/3) is in the fourth quadrant, so θ would be negative or positive depending on the convention.

Let me compute tan(2θ)= -4/3, so 2θ is in the fourth quadrant, so θ is negative.

Alternatively, we can compute θ as half the angle whose tangent is 4/3.

But perhaps to avoid dealing with angles, let me use rotation formulas.

The standard rotation formulas are:

x = x' cosθ - y' sinθ

y = x' sinθ + y' cosθ

But since the asymptotes are y=2x and y=-2x, the angle θ is such that tanθ=2.

Wait, because for the asymptote y=2x, the angle θ satisfies tanθ=2.

Similarly, for the other asymptote y=-2x, tanθ=-2, but since we are rotating the coordinate system, we can take θ such that tanθ=2.

Thus, cosθ=1/√(1 +4)=1/√5, sinθ=2/√5

Therefore, the rotation transformation is:

x = x' cosθ - y' sinθ = (x' - 2y')/√5

y = x' sinθ + y' cosθ = (2x' + y')/√5

Now, substitute these into the asymptotes.

The original asymptotes are y=2x -3 and y=-2x +17.

Let me substitute x and y in terms of x' and y':

For the first asymptote:

y =2x -3

Plug in:

(2x' + y')/√5 =2*( (x' - 2y')/√5 ) -3

Multiply both sides by √5:

2x' + y' =2(x' -2y') -3√5

Simplify RHS:

2x' -4y' -3√5

So, equation:

2x' + y' =2x' -4y' -3√5

Bring all terms to left:

2x' + y' -2x' +4y' +3√5=0

Simplify:

(2x' -2x') + (y' +4y') +3√5=0

So, 5y' +3√5=0

Thus, y' = -3√5 /5

Similarly, for the second asymptote y=-2x +17:

(2x' + y')/√5 = -2*( (x' - 2y')/√5 ) +17

Multiply both sides by √5:

2x' + y' = -2(x' -2y') +17√5

Simplify RHS:

-2x' +4y' +17√5

So, equation:

2x' + y' = -2x' +4y' +17√5

Bring all terms to left:

2x' + y' +2x' -4y' -17√5=0

Simplify:

(2x' +2x') + (y' -4y') -17√5=0

4x' -3y' -17√5=0

But since after rotation, the asymptotes should align with the new axes, which are the x' and y' axes. So, the rotated hyperbola should have its center at the intersection point of the rotated asymptotes, which is now the origin in the rotated system.

Wait, but the original hyperbola passes through (4,7). So, in the rotated system, point (4,7) should be on the hyperbola.

But let's see, since the asymptotes in the rotated system are x'=0 and y'=0, the hyperbola's center in the rotated system is at (0,0).

So, the hyperbola equation in the rotated system is of the form (x')²/a² - (y')²/b²=1

Wait, but in standard form, for a hyperbola rotated by θ, but since we are now having the asymptotes as the new axes, the equation is indeed (x')²/a² - (y')²/b²=1

But we know that the hyperbola passes through (4,7) in the original system. Let's find the corresponding point in the rotated system.

Wait, perhaps it's better to plug the rotated coordinates into the hyperbola equation.

But let me think differently.

Given that the center of the hyperbola is at (5,7), which in the rotated system is at (h,k)=(5 cosθ -7 sinθ, 5 sinθ +7 cosθ). Wait, no, in the rotated system, the center (h,k) is the same, so:

h =5 cosθ -7 sinθ

k=5 sinθ +7 cosθ

But θ is the angle of rotation, which we found earlier, θ is such that tanθ=2, so cosθ=1/√5, sinθ=2/√5

So, h=5*(1/√5) -7*(2/√5)= (5 -14)/√5= (-9)/√5

k=5*(2/√5) +7*(1/√5)= (10 +7)/√5=17/√5

So, the center in the rotated system is at (-9/√5,17/√5). But in the rotated system, the center is at (0,0), so the original center (5,7) is at (-9/√5,17/√5) in the rotated system.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should use the general equation for a hyperbola in rotated coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of rotating, we can use the standard rotated hyperbola equation.

The standard equation for a hyperbola with center at (h,k), rotated by θ is:

[(x cosθ + y sinθ - h)^2]/a² - [( -x sinθ + y cosθ -k)^2]/b² =1

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the distance between foci.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a hyperbola, the distance between the foci is 2c, where c² =a² +b².

So, if I can find a and b, I can find c, and thus the distance between the foci.

Given that the hyperbola is centered at (5,7), and it's a hyperbola with asymptotes y=2x -3 and y=-2x +17.

Given that the asymptotes have slopes ±2, which is a/b=2, so a=2b.

But I need to find a and b.

Wait, but in standard hyperbola, for the slopes, it's ±(a/b). So, if the slopes are 2, then a/b=2, so a=2b.

But also, in the standard hyperbola equation, c² =a² +b², so c=√(a² +b²)=√(4b² +b²)=√(5b²)=b√5

Therefore, the distance between the foci is 2c=2b√5.

So, if I can find b, then I can find the distance.

But how?

Given that the hyperbola passes through (4,7). So, perhaps using this point to find b.

But the problem is that in the standard hyperbola, the center is at (h,k), so the equation is (x -h)^2/a² - (y -k)^2/b²=1, but in this case, since it's rotated, the equation is more complicated.

Wait, perhaps we can use the general equation for a rotated hyperbola.

But to do that, we need more information.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula for the distance from the center to the hyperbola.

Wait, the hyperbola is centered at (5,7), and the asymptotes are y=2x -3 and y=-2x +17.

But we can use the formula for the distance from the center to the asymptotes.

Wait, the distance from a point (h,k) to the line ax + by +c=0 is |ah + bk +c|/√(a² +b²). So, distance from (5,7) to the asymptotes.

Compute distance to y=2x -3.

Rewrite as 2x - y -3=0.

Distance is |2*5 -1*7 -3| /√(4 +1)= |10 -7 -3|/√5= | -0 | /√5=0

Wait, that can't be. If the center lies on the asymptote, then the distance is zero, but the hyperbola doesn't pass through the center.

Wait, actually, the center is not on the asymptote because the two asymptotes are y=2x -3 and y=-2x +17, which intersect at the center.

Wait, yes, the two asymptotes intersect at the center.

So, let's find the intersection point of the asymptotes.

Set 2x -3 = -2x +17

4x=20 => x=5

Then y=2*5 -3=7

So, the center is at (5,7), which is the intersection point of the asymptotes, as expected.

So, the distance from the center to each asymptote is zero because the center lies on the asymptotes.

But the hyperbola passes through the center?

Wait, no, the hyperbola is centered at (5,7), but it doesn't necessarily pass through (5,7). Wait, but the hyperbola passes through (4,7), which is 1 unit left of the center.

Wait, let me see: The hyperbola passes through (4,7). So, it's 1 unit left of the center.

Given that, maybe we can use the definition of a hyperbola: the difference of distances from any point on the hyperbola to the two foci is constant. But since we don't know the foci, that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that the hyperbola passes through (4,7), and the asymptotes.

Wait, I know the asymptotes, and the hyperbola is rotated, so maybe the director circle or something, but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the hyperbola.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should use the general equation of the hyperbola.

Given that it's rotated, the general equation is:

Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey + F =0

But since it's a hyperbola, the discriminant B² -4AC >0.

We know the asymptotes are y=2x -3 and y=-2x +17. So, the asymptotes can be found by setting the equation equal to zero.

So, the asymptotes are solutions to the equation when F=0 is the hyperbola equation.

So, the hyperbola equation is Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey =0

And the asymptotes are given by solving Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey + F=0 for F=0.

So, the asymptotes are solutions to Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey =0.

So, the asymptotes can be found by solving the quadratic equation.

So, to find A, B, C, D, E, we can use the asymptotes.

Let me recall that the equations of the asymptotes can be found by dividing the equation of the hyperbola by the constant term, assuming F=0.

But since F=0, the asymptotes are given by the equation when F=0.

Wait, perhaps better to use the fact that the asymptotes are given by the hyperbola equation when the constant term is zero.

So, for our hyperbola, the equation is:

A(x -5)^2 + B(x -5)(y -7) + C(y -7)^2 + D(x -5) + E(y -7) =0

But this is similar to the earlier approach.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to note that the hyperbola can be written as:

[(y - (2x -3))(y - (-2x +17))] = k

Which is:

(y -2x +3)(y +2x -17) =k

Expanding:

y² -4x² +40x -51 =k

Which is the same equation as before, but only if k= -4 -4x² +40x -51.

But we saw that this leads to a contradiction because plugging (4,7) gives -1/4.

Wait, so perhaps the hyperbola equation is:

(y -2x +3)(y +2x -17) =k

Which is equal to:

(y² -4x² +40x -51) =k

So, y² -4x² +40x -51 -k =0

Which is similar to what we had before.

So, plugging in (4,7):

(7)^2 -4*(4)^2 +40*4 -51 -k=0

49 -64 +160 -51 -k=0

(49 -64)= -15, (160 -51)=109

So, -15 +109 -k=0 =>94 -k=0 =>k=94

Thus, the equation is y² -4x² +40x -51 -94=0 => y² -4x² +40x -145=0

So, y² -4x² +40x -145=0

Let me write this as:

-4x² + y² +40x -145=0

Multiply both sides by -1:

4x² - y² -40x +145=0

Thus, 4x² - y² -40x +145=0

This is a quadratic equation. Let me rearrange:

4x² -40x - y² +145=0

Let me complete the square for x:

4x² -40x =4(x² -10x) =4[(x² -10x +25) -25]=4(x -5)^2 -100

So, substitute back:

4(x -5)^2 -100 - y² +145=0

Which is:

4(x -5)^2 - y² +45=0

Thus,

4(x -5)^2 - y² = -45

Divide both sides by -45:

[(x -5)^2]/(-45/4) - [y²]/(-45)=1

Which is:

[(x -5)^2]/(-45/4) - [y²]/(-45)=1

But since the denominators are negative, we can write them as positive:

[(x -5)^2]/(45/4) - [y²]/45=1

Therefore, the standard form is:

[(x -5)^2]/( (sqrt(45/4))² ) - [y²]/( (sqrt(45))² )=1

So, a²=45/4, b²=45

Thus, a= (3√5)/2, b=3√5

Therefore, the slopes of the asymptotes are ±(b/a)= ±( (3√5)/2 ) / ( (3√5)/2 )= ±1. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, in standard hyperbola, the slopes are ±(b/a). So, in this case, a²=45/4, so a= (3√5)/2, and b²=45, so b=3√5.

Thus, the slopes are ±(b/a)= ±(3√5 / ( (3√5)/2 ))=±2. So, that matches.

So, now, to find the distance between the foci.

For a hyperbola, the distance between the foci is 2c, where c²= a² + b²

Thus, c²=45/4 +45=45/4 +180/4=225/4

Thus, c=15/2

Therefore, distance between foci is 2c=15

So, the distance is 15.

**Final Answer**
The distance between the foci of the hyperbola is \boxed{15}.
</think>

Given the asymptotes of a hyperbola: \( y = 2x - 3 \) and \( y = -2x + 17 \), and the hyperbola passes through the point \( (4, 7) \), we need to find the distance between the foci of the hyperbola.

1. **Find the center of the hyperbola:**
   - The center is the intersection of the asymptotes.
   - Solving the equations \( y = 2x - 3 \) and \( y = -2x + 17 \):
     \[
     2x - 3 = -2x + 17 \implies 4x = 20 \implies x = 5
     \]
     Substituting \( x = 5 \) into \( y = 2x - 3 \):
     \[
     y = 2(5) - 3 = 7
     \]
   - The center is \( (5, 7) \).

2. **Determine the slopes of the asymptotes:**
   - The slopes are \( \pm 2 \), indicating \( \frac{b}{a} = 2 \) or \( a = 2b \).

3. **Form the equation of the hyperbola:**
   - The hyperbola is centered at \( (5, 7) \).
   - The equation is written as:
     \[
     (y - 2x + 3)(y + 2x - 17) = k
     \]
   - Expanding and simplifying:
     \[
     y^2 - 4x^2 + 40x - 51 - k = 0
     \]
   - Using the point \( (4, 7) \) to find \( k \):
     \[
     49 - 64 + 160 - 51 - k = 0 \implies -15 + 109 - k = 0 \implies k = 94
     \]
   - The equation becomes:
     \[
     y^2 - 4x^2 + 40x - 145 = 0
     \]

4. **Rewrite the equation in standard form:**
   - Completing the square for \( x \):
     \[
     4(x - 5)^2 - y^2 = -45
     \]
   - Dividing by -45:
     \[
     \frac{(x - 5)^2}{\frac{45}{4}} - \frac{y^2}{45} = 1
     \]
   - Identifying \( a^2 = \frac{45}{4} \) and \( b^2 = 45 \).

5. **Calculate the distance between the foci:**
   - Using \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \):
     \[
     c^2 = \frac{45}{4} + 45 = \frac{225}{4} \implies c = \frac{15}{2}
     \]
   - The distance between the foci is \( 2c \):
     \[
     2c = 15
     \]

The distance between the foci of the hyperbola is \(\boxed{15}\).
