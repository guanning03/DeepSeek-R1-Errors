Question:
Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers such that $xyz = 2.$  Find the minimum value of
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4.\]

Correct Answer:
By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 &= x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 4z^4 \\
&\ge 4 \sqrt[4]{(x^4)(2y^2)(2y^2)(4z^4)} \\
&= 8xyz \\
&= 16.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $x^4 = 2y^2 = 4z^2.$  Using the condition $xyz = 2,$ we can solve to get $x = y = \sqrt{2}$ and $z = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{16}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the minimum value of the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\) given that \(xyz = 2\). Hmm, let's see how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with optimization problems involving constraints, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be useful. But I also recall that sometimes inequalities like AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality can be helpful in such cases. Maybe I can apply either of these methods here.

Looking at the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\), I notice that it's a sum of different powers of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). The constraint is \(xyz = 2\), which is a product of the variables. So, perhaps I can use the AM-GM inequality to relate these terms.

Let me recall the AM-GM inequality: for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. So, for two numbers, it says \(\frac{a + b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab}\) with equality when \(a = b\). Maybe I can apply this to each term in the expression.

But wait, the expression has three terms: \(x^4\), \(4y^2\), and \(4z^4\). Maybe I can split them into multiple terms so that I can apply AM-GM to three terms. Let me try.

Let me write each term as a sum of several equal terms so that when I apply AM-GM, I can get a relation involving \(xyz\).

Looking at \(x^4\), I can think of it as \(x^4 = x^4\), but that's just one term. Maybe splitting it into four terms each equal to \(\frac{x^4}{4}\). Similarly, \(4y^2\) can be written as four terms of \(y^2\) each. But \(4z^4\) is a bit trickier because it's \(z^4\) times 4, which is an even power.

Wait, maybe I should think of each term as multiple variables multiplied together and then apply AM-GM on those. Let me try to split each term into several variables so that when I take the product, it relates to the constraint \(xyz = 2\).

Alternatively, maybe instead of splitting each term, I can express the entire expression as a sum and then apply AM-GM to that entire sum. Let me consider that.

Suppose I have \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\). If I can express this as a sum of terms that can be related to \(xyz\), perhaps I can apply AM-GM.

Wait, another idea: maybe use multiple variables in AM-GM. For example, if I take the number of variables such that their product is a multiple of \(xyz\). Let me think about the degrees.

The expression has \(x^4\), which is degree 4, \(4y^2\), degree 2, and \(4z^4\), degree 4. The constraint is \(xyz\), degree 3. So, the degrees don't quite line up, but maybe I can balance them somehow.

Alternatively, since the constraint is \(xyz = 2\), perhaps I can express each term in the expression as a product involving \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), scaled appropriately.

Wait, another strategy: Maybe use substitution to express one variable in terms of the others using the constraint, then substitute back into the expression and minimize with two variables. Let me try that.

Given \(xyz = 2\), so \(z = \frac{2}{xy}\). Substitute this into the expression:

\(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4\left(\frac{2}{xy}\right)^4 = x^4 + 4y^2 + 4 \cdot \frac{16}{x^4y^4}\).

Simplify that:

\(x^4 + 4y^2 + \frac{64}{x^4y^4}\).

Hmm, now the expression is in terms of \(x\) and \(y\). Maybe I can set derivatives to zero to find the minimum, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use AM-GM on the three terms \(x^4\), \(4y^2\), and \(\frac{64}{x^4y^4}\).

Wait, but the problem is that these terms are not all the same. Maybe I can adjust the number of terms in each so that they can be treated equally for the AM-GM inequality.

Let me think: To apply AM-GM, I need to have equal weights or equal numbers of terms. So, let's try to split the terms so that each has the same number of terms.

Looking at \(x^4\), let me write it as four terms: \(x^4 = a + a + a + a\). That might help because then I have four \(x^4\) parts.

Similarly, the term \(4y^2\) can be written as four terms of \(y^2/2\) each, but wait, that might not be necessary. Alternatively, I can write \(4y^2\) as \(y^2 + y^2 + y^2 + y^2\).

Similarly, the term \(\frac{64}{x^4y^4}\) can be split into multiple terms. Let's see, if I split it into eight terms, each equal to \(\frac{8}{x^4y^4}\). Hmm, but that might not be helpful.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the exponents in the terms. The exponents of \(x\) and \(y\) in each term are:

1. \(x^4\) has \(x^4\) and no \(y\).
2. \(4y^2\) has no \(x\), \(y^2\), but we can think of it as having a total exponent of 2 in \(y\).
3. \(\frac{64}{x^4y^4}\) has \(x^{-4}\) and \(y^{-4}\).

So, it's a bit tricky because the terms have different exponents.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expression as a sum where each term is a variable raised to a power, and then use the weighted AM-GM inequality.

Let me recall that the weighted AM-GM inequality says that for positive real numbers \(a_i\) and positive weights \(w_i\) such that \(\sum w_i = 1\), we have:

\[
a_1^{w_1}a_2^{w_2}\cdots a_n^{w_n} \leq w_1a_1 + w_2a_2 + \cdots + w_na_n
\]

But I'm not entirely sure how to apply this here because the exponents are different.

Wait, maybe another approach: since we have \(xyz = 2\), perhaps I can take the logarithm of both sides and turn it into a linear equation, but I don't know if that will help with the expression we need to minimize.

Alternatively, I can use substitution to express one variable in terms of the others and then use calculus to find the minimum. Let me try that.

From \(xyz = 2\), we can express \(z = \frac{2}{xy}\). Then substitute into the expression:

\(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 = x^4 + 4y^2 + 4\left(\frac{2}{xy}\right)^4\).

Simplify that:

\(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4 \cdot \frac{16}{x^4y^4} = x^4 + 4y^2 + \frac{64}{x^4y^4}\).

So now, the expression is in terms of \(x\) and \(y\). Let me denote this as \(f(x, y) = x^4 + 4y^2 + \frac{64}{x^4y^4}\).

To find the minimum, I can take partial derivatives with respect to \(x\) and \(y\), set them equal to zero, and solve for \(x\) and \(y\).

First, compute the partial derivative with respect to \(x\):

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 4x^3 - \frac{256}{x^5y^4}
\]

Set this equal to zero:

\[
4x^3 - \frac{256}{x^5y^4} = 0
\]
\[
4x^3 = \frac{256}{x^5y^4}
\]
\[
4x^3 \cdot x^5y^4 = 256
\]
\[
4x^8y^4 = 256
\]
\[
x^8y^4 = 64
\]
\[
(x^2y)^4 = 64
\]
\[
x^2y = \sqrt[4]{64} = 64^{1/4} = (2^6)^{1/4} = 2^{6/4} = 2^{3/2} = \sqrt{8} \approx 2.828
\]
Wait, no, hold on. Actually, 64 is 2^6, so 64^(1/4) is 2^(6/4) = 2^(3/2) = 2*sqrt(2), which is approximately 2.828. So:

\(x^2y = 2^{3/2}\).

Alternatively, I can write \(x^2y = 2\sqrt{2}\).

Let me note that as equation (1):

\(x^2y = 2\sqrt{2}\).

Now, compute the partial derivative with respect to \(y\):

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 8y - \frac{256 \cdot 4}{x^4y^5} = 8y - \frac{1024}{x^4y^5}
\]

Wait, hold on. Let me calculate that again.

Wait, the original function is \(f(x, y) = x^4 + 4y^2 + \frac{64}{x^4y^4}\).

So, the partial derivative with respect to \(y\) is:

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 8y - \frac{64 \cdot 4}{x^4y^5}
\]

Wait, no: the derivative of \(\frac{64}{x^4y^4}\) with respect to \(y\) is \(-64 \cdot 4 x^{-4} y^{-5} = -256 x^{-4} y^{-5}\).

So, \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 8y - \frac{256}{x^4y^5}\).

Set this equal to zero:

\[
8y - \frac{256}{x^4y^5} = 0
\]
\[
8y = \frac{256}{x^4y^5}
\]
\[
8y \cdot x^4y^5 = 256
\]
\[
8x^4y^6 = 256
\]
\[
x^4y^6 = 32
\]
\[
(x^2y^3)^2 = 32
\]
\[
x^2y^3 = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}
\]
So that's equation (2):

\(x^2y^3 = 4\sqrt{2}\).

Now, we have two equations:

1. \(x^2y = 2\sqrt{2}\)
2. \(x^2y^3 = 4\sqrt{2}\)

Let me write them as:

1. \(x^2y = 2\sqrt{2}\)
2. \(x^2y^3 = 4\sqrt{2}\)

Let me divide equation (2) by equation (1):

\[
\frac{x^2y^3}{x^2y} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}}
\]
\[
y^2 = 2
\]
\[
y = \sqrt{2}
\]
Since \(y\) is positive, we take the positive root.

Now, plug \(y = \sqrt{2}\) back into equation (1):

\[
x^2 \cdot \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
x^2 = 2
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{2}
\]
Again, since \(x\) is positive, we take the positive root.

So, \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(y = \sqrt{2}\).

Now, let's find \(z\) using the constraint \(xyz = 2\):

\[
z = \frac{2}{xy} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
\]

So, \(z = 1\).

Now, let's compute the value of the expression:

\(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\).

Substituting the values:

\[
(\sqrt{2})^4 + 4(\sqrt{2})^2 + 4(1)^4
\]

Compute each term:

1. \((\sqrt{2})^4 = (2)^{4/2} = (2)^2 = 4\)
2. \(4(\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 \cdot 2 = 8\)
3. \(4(1)^4 = 4 \cdot 1 = 4\)

Add them up:

\(4 + 8 + 4 = 16\).

So, the minimum value seems to be 16.

Wait a second, let me verify if this is indeed the minimum. Sometimes, when using calculus, we can get critical points which might be maxima or saddle points. So, I should check the second derivatives or use some other method to ensure that this is a minimum.

Alternatively, maybe I can apply the AM-GM inequality again to the original expression.

Let me see. The expression is \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\).

If I can write this as a sum of terms whose product is related to \(xyz\), maybe I can apply AM-GM.

Wait, another idea: Let me write the expression as \(x^4 + y^2 + y^2 + y^2 + z^4 + z^4 + z^4 + z^4\).

So, that's 1 \(x^4\), 3 \(y^2\)s, and 4 \(z^4\)s.

Now, total terms: 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.

So, I can apply AM-GM inequality to these 8 terms:

\[
\frac{x^4 + y^2 + y^2 + y^2 + z^4 + z^4 + z^4 + z^4}{8} \geq \sqrt[8]{x^4 \cdot y^2 \cdot y^2 \cdot y^2 \cdot z^4 \cdot z^4 \cdot z^4 \cdot z^4}
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:

\[
\sqrt[8]{x^4 y^6 z^8}
\]

Which is:

\[
(x^4)^{1/8} (y^6)^{1/8} (z^8)^{1/8} = x^{0.5} y^{0.75} z^{1}
\]

Hmm, so we have:

\[
\frac{x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4}{8} \geq x^{0.5} y^{0.75} z
\]

But I'm not sure how this relates to the constraint \(xyz = 2\). Maybe I can express \(x^{0.5} y^{0.75} z\) in terms of \(xyz\).

Wait, let's see:

\(x^{0.5} y^{0.75} z = x^{0.5} y^{0.75} z^{1}\).

If I can write this as a multiple of \(xyz\), but I don't see a direct way because of the exponents.

Alternatively, let me think differently. Maybe I can pair terms in a way that the exponents add up.

Wait, for AM-GM, we need the product of the terms to be equal to something, and the geometric mean to be equal to that. But here, the product of the terms \(x^4 y^6 z^8\) is equal to \(x^4 y^6 z^8\), which is not directly related to \(xyz = 2\).

Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the number of terms or assign different weights.

Wait, another approach: maybe use weighted AM-GM with different weights.

Let me try to write the expression as a sum of terms with weights in such a way that when we apply AM-GM, the product will give me \(xyz\).

Wait, so let me try to write \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\) as a sum of 8 terms, each with different exponents, such that the product is \(xyz\). Let me see.

Let me define each term as follows:

Let me have:

- 1 term of \(x^4\),
- 3 terms of \(y^2\),
- 4 terms of \(z^4\).

So, total of 8 terms.

Now, let me apply AM-GM to these 8 terms:

\[
\frac{x^4 + y^2 + y^2 + y^2 + z^4 + z^4 + z^4 + z^4}{8} \geq \sqrt[8]{x^4 \cdot y^2 \cdot y^2 \cdot y^2 \cdot z^4 \cdot z^4 \cdot z^4 \cdot z^4}
\]

Simplify the right side:

\[
\sqrt[8]{x^4 y^6 z^8} = x^{0.5} y^{0.75} z
\]

Hmm, but this still doesn't directly relate to \(xyz\). Maybe if I can manipulate this expression.

Wait, perhaps I can take the 8th power on both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4}{8}\right)^8 \geq x^{0.5} y^{0.75} z
\]

But I don't see how that helps me because it still has \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). Maybe I need to consider another approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of splitting into 8 terms, I can split them into different numbers such that when I take the product, it relates to \(xyz\).

Alternatively, maybe I can use Hölder's inequality. Hölder's inequality is a generalization of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and might be applicable here.

Hölder's inequality states that for positive real numbers \(a_i\), \(b_i\), and \(c_i\), and exponents \(p\), \(q\), and \(r\) such that \(1/p + 1/q + 1/r = 1\), we have:

\[
\sum a_i b_i c_i \leq \left(\sum a_i^p\right)^{1/p} \left(\sum b_i^q\right)^{1/q} \left(\sum c_i^r\right)^{1/r}
\]

But I'm not sure how to apply that here directly.

Wait, another thought: Maybe use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's try that approach.

We need to minimize \(f(x, y, z) = x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\) subject to the constraint \(g(x, y, z) = xyz - 2 = 0\).

The method of Lagrange multipliers tells us that at the minimum, the gradient of \(f\) is proportional to the gradient of \(g\).

So, compute the gradients:

\[
\nabla f = \left(4x^3, 8y, 16z^3\right)
\]
\[
\nabla g = \left(yz, xz, xy\right)
\]

So, set up the equations:

1. \(4x^3 = \lambda yz\)
2. \(8y = \lambda xz\)
3. \(16z^3 = \lambda xy\)
4. \(xyz = 2\)

So, four equations with four variables \(x\), \(y\), \(z\), and \(\lambda\).

Let me try to solve these equations.

From equation 1: \(4x^3 = \lambda yz\)

From equation 2: \(8y = \lambda xz\)

From equation 3: \(16z^3 = \lambda xy\)

Let me take the ratio of equation 1 and equation 2:

\[
\frac{4x^3}{8y} = \frac{\lambda yz}{\lambda xz}
\]
Simplify:

\[
\frac{4x^3}{8y} = \frac{yz}{xz} = \frac{y}{x}
\]
So,

\[
\frac{x^3}{2y} = \frac{y}{x}
\]
Cross-multiplying:

\[
x^4 = 2y^2
\]
So,

\[
x^4 = 2y^2
\]
Which implies,

\[
y = x^2 / \sqrt{2}
\]
Since \(y\) is positive.

Similarly, take the ratio of equation 2 and equation 3:

\[
\frac{8y}{16z^3} = \frac{\lambda xz}{\lambda xy}
\]
Simplify:

\[
\frac{y}{2z^3} = \frac{xz}{xy} = \frac{z}{x}
\]
Cross-multiplying:

\[
x \cdot y = 2z^3 \cdot z = 2z^4
\]
Wait, hold on. Let me compute that step again.

Wait, the ratio is \(\frac{8y}{16z^3} = \frac{y}{2z^3}\). The right side is \(\frac{\lambda xz}{\lambda xy} = \frac{xz}{xy} = \frac{z}{x}\).

So,

\[
\frac{y}{2z^3} = \frac{z}{x}
\]
Cross-multiplying:

\[
y x = 2z^4
\]
So,

\[
y = \frac{2z^4}{x}
\]

Earlier, we found that \(y = x^2 / \sqrt{2}\). So, set the two expressions for \(y\) equal:

\[
\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2z^4}{x}
\]
Multiply both sides by \(x\):

\[
\frac{x^3}{\sqrt{2}} = 2z^4
\]
So,

\[
z^4 = \frac{x^3}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{x^3}{2^{3/2}} = \frac{x^3}{2^{1} \cdot 2^{1/2}}} = \frac{x^3}{2^{3/2}}
\]
Thus,

\[
z = \left(\frac{x^3}{2^{3/2}}\right)^{1/4} = \frac{x^{3/4}}{2^{3/8}}
\]

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

\(z^4 = \frac{x^3}{2^{3/2}}\), so \(z = \left( \frac{x^3}{2^{3/2}} \right)^{1/4} = \frac{x^{3/4}}{2^{3/8}}\).

Alternatively, \(2^{3/8}\) is \( \sqrt[8]{2^3} = \sqrt[8]{8} \approx 1.296\), but maybe we can express it in terms of exponents.

Alternatively, let me express \(z\) as \( z = \frac{x^{3/4}}{2^{3/8}} \).

Now, let's go back to the constraint \(xyz = 2\).

We have \( y = x^2 / \sqrt{2} \) and \( z = \frac{x^{3/4}}{2^{3/8}} \).

So, substituting into \(xyz = 2\):

\[
x \cdot \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{x^{3/4}}{2^{3/8}} = 2
\]

Simplify each term:

First, \(x \cdot x^2 = x^3\).

Then, \(\frac{x^{3/4}}{2^{3/8}}\) remains.

So, combining:

\[
x^3 \cdot \frac{x^{3/4}}{2^{3/8}} = 2
\]
Combine the exponents of \(x\):

\[
x^{3 + 3/4} = x^{15/4}
\]

So,

\[
\frac{x^{15/4}}{2^{3/8}} = 2
\]
Multiply both sides by \(2^{3/8}\):

\[
x^{15/4} = 2 \cdot 2^{3/8} = 2^{1 + 3/8} = 2^{11/8}
\]
Take both sides to the power of \(4/15\):

\[
x = \left(2^{11/8}\right)^{4/15} = 2^{(11/8)(4/15)} = 2^{(11 \cdot 4)/(8 \cdot 15)} = 2^{44/120} = 2^{11/30}
\]

So, \(x = 2^{11/30}\). Let me compute \(11/30\) as a decimal to check, but perhaps it's better to leave it as exponent.

Now, compute \(x^{15/4}\):

Wait, but actually, we have \(x = 2^{11/30}\), so \(x^{15/4} = (2^{11/30})^{15/4} = 2^{(11/30)(15/4)} = 2^{(11 \cdot 15)/(30 \cdot 4)} = 2^{165/120} = 2^{11/8}\), which matches.

Okay, so \(x = 2^{11/30}\). Now, let's find \(y\):

\(y = x^2 / \sqrt{2} = \left(2^{11/30}\right)^2 / 2^{1/2} = 2^{22/30} / 2^{15/30} = 2^{7/30}\).

Similarly, compute \(z\):

\(z = \frac{x^{3/4}}{2^{3/8}} = \frac{\left(2^{11/30}\right)^{3/4}}{2^{3/8}} = \frac{2^{33/120}}{2^{3/8}} = 2^{33/120 - 3/8}\).

Convert 3/8 to 45/120:

\(33/120 - 45/120 = (-12)/120 = -1/10\). So, \(z = 2^{-1/10} = 1 / 2^{1/10}\).

So, we have:

- \(x = 2^{11/30}\)
- \(y = 2^{7/30}\)
- \(z = 2^{-1/10}\)

Now, let's compute the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\).

Compute each term:

1. \(x^4 = \left(2^{11/30}\right)^4 = 2^{44/30} = 2^{22/15}\)
2. \(4y^2 = 4 \cdot \left(2^{7/30}\right)^2 = 4 \cdot 2^{14/30} = 4 \cdot 2^{7/15}\)
3. \(4z^4 = 4 \cdot \left(2^{-1/10}\right)^4 = 4 \cdot 2^{-4/10} = 4 \cdot 2^{-2/5}\)

So, the expression becomes:

\[
2^{22/15} + 4 \cdot 2^{7/15} + 4 \cdot 2^{-2/5}
\]

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can convert all exponents to the same denominator or see if they simplify.

Let me note that:

- \(22/15 = 1 + 7/15\)
- \(7/15\) is as it is.
- \(-2/5 = -6/15\)
- So, \(4 \cdot 2^{-2/5} = 4 \cdot 2^{-6/15}\)

So, rewrite:

\[
2^{1 + 7/15} + 4 \cdot 2^{7/15} + 4 \cdot 2^{-6/15} = 2 \cdot 2^{7/15} + 4 \cdot 2^{7/15} + 4 \cdot 2^{-6/15}
\]
Combine the first two terms:

\(2 \cdot 2^{7/15} + 4 \cdot 2^{7/15} = (2 + 4) \cdot 2^{7/15} = 6 \cdot 2^{7/15}\)

So, the expression becomes:

\(6 \cdot 2^{7/15} + 4 \cdot 2^{-6/15}\)

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe factor out \(2^{-6/15}\):

\[
6 \cdot 2^{7/15} + 4 \cdot 2^{-6/15} = 2^{-6/15} \left(6 \cdot 2^{(7/15 + 6/15)} + 4\right) = 2^{-6/15} \left(6 \cdot 2^{13/15} + 4\right)
\]

Simplify \(6 \cdot 2^{13/15}\):

\(2^{13/15} = 2^{1 + 3/15} = 2 \cdot 2^{1/5}\), so:

\(6 \cdot 2 \cdot 2^{1/5} = 12 \cdot 2^{1/5}\)

So, the expression becomes:

\(2^{-6/15} (12 \cdot 2^{1/5} + 4)\)

But \(2^{-6/15} = (2^{1/15})^{-6} = 2^{-2/5}\), which is the same as \(1 / 2^{2/5}\).

So,

\( \frac{12 \cdot 2^{1/5} + 4}{2^{2/5}} = 12 \cdot 2^{1/5 - 2/5} + 4 \cdot 2^{-2/5} = 12 \cdot 2^{-1/5} + 4 \cdot 2^{-2/5} \)

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I need to compute numerical values.

Wait, let me compute each term numerically.

Compute \(2^{1/5}\):

\(2^{1/5} \approx 1.1487\)

Compute \(2^{-1/5}\):

\(2^{-1/5} \approx 0.87055\)

Compute \(2^{2/5}\):

\(2^{2/5} \approx \sqrt[5]{4} \approx 1.3195\)

Compute \(2^{-2/5}\):

\(2^{-2/5} \approx 1 / 1.3195 \approx 0.7585\)

Compute \(2^{7/15}\):

\(2^{7/15} \approx e^{(7/15)\ln 2} \approx e^{(7/15)(0.6931)} \approx e^{0.323} \approx 1.382\)

Compute \(2^{-6/15} = 2^{-2/5} \approx 0.7585\)

Compute each term:

1. \(2^{22/15}\): 22/15 ≈ 1.4667, so \(2^{1.4667} ≈ 2.766\)
2. \(4 \cdot 2^{7/15} ≈ 4 \cdot 1.382 ≈ 5.528\)
3. \(4 \cdot 2^{-2/5} ≈ 4 \cdot 0.7585 ≈ 3.034\)

Adding them up: 2.766 + 5.528 + 3.034 ≈ 11.328

So, the expression evaluates to approximately 11.328, which is about 16 divided by something? Wait, 11.328 is actually close to 16, but let me check.

Wait, earlier, when I used the substitution method, I got 16. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the Lagrange multipliers method gives a lower value than the substitution method. That seems contradictory.

Wait, actually, in the substitution method, I found that the minimum is 16, but in the Lagrange multipliers approach, I found approximately 11.328. But that seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution method. Let me double-check.

In the substitution method, I set \(z = 2/(xy)\), substituted into \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\), then expressed everything in terms of \(x\) and \(y\), then took partial derivatives, set them equal to zero, and found \(x = \sqrt{2}\), \(y = \sqrt{2}\), \(z = 1\), leading to the expression equal to 16.

But in the Lagrange multipliers method, I got approximately 11.328, which is less than 16. That can't be, because 16 is the substitution result, which should be correct. So, probably, I made a mistake in the Lagrange multipliers.

Wait, let me go back and check.

So, in the Lagrange multipliers, I had:

1. \(4x^3 = \lambda yz\)
2. \(8y = \lambda xz\)
3. \(16z^3 = \lambda xy\)
4. \(xyz = 2\)

Then, from equations 1 and 2, I divided to get \(x^2 / (2y) = y / x\), leading to \(x^4 = 2y^2\). That seems correct.

From equations 2 and 3, I got \(y / (2z^3) = z / x\), leading to \(y x = 2 z^4\). Then, substituting \(y = x^2 / \sqrt{2}\) into that, I had \(x^3 / \sqrt{2} = 2 z^4\), so \(z^4 = x^3 / (2^{3/2})\), which is correct.

Then, substituting \(y = x^2 / \sqrt{2}\) and \(z = x^{3/4} / 2^{3/8}\) into the constraint \(xyz = 2\), I got:

\(x \cdot x^2 / \sqrt{2} \cdot x^{3/4} / 2^{3/8} = 2\)

Simplify the exponents:

\(x^{1 + 2 + 3/4} = x^{15/4}\)

So, \(x^{15/4} / (2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{3/8}) = 2\), which is \(x^{15/4} / 2^{7/8} = 2\).

Hence, \(x^{15/4} = 2 \cdot 2^{7/8} = 2^{15/8}\)

So, \(x = (2^{15/8})^{4/15} = 2^{(15/8)(4/15)} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}\). Wait, hold on, that contradicts my earlier calculation.

Wait, in my earlier substitution method, I had:

From \(x^{15/4} = 2^{11/8}\), so \(x = 2^{(11/8)(4/15)} = 2^{11/30}\). But according to Lagrange multipliers, it's \(x = \sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}\).

Hmm, so that suggests that I made a mistake in my substitution method earlier.

Wait, let me check the substitution method again.

In substitution, I set \(z = 2/(xy)\), substituted into \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\), and got \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4/(x^4 y^4)\).

Then, I let \(f(x, y) = x^4 + 4y^2 + 4/(x^4 y^4)\).

Then, I took the partial derivatives:

\(\partial f / \partial x = 4x^3 - 16/(x^5 y^4)\)

\(\partial f / \partial y = 8y - 16/(x^4 y^5)\)

Set them equal to zero:

1. \(4x^3 = 16/(x^5 y^4)\) => \(x^8 y^4 = 4\)
2. \(8y = 16/(x^4 y^5)\) => \(x^4 y^6 = 2\)

So, equation (1): \(x^8 y^4 = 4\)

Equation (2): \(x^4 y^6 = 2\)

Dividing equation (1) by equation (2):

\(x^4 / y^2 = 2\), so \(x^4 = 2 y^2\), so \(x^2 = \sqrt{2} y\). So, \(x = \sqrt{\sqrt{2} y}\).

Then, plug into equation (2): \(x^4 y^6 = 2\)

Substitute \(x^4 = 2 y^2\):

\(2 y^2 \cdot y^6 = 2 y^8 = 2\)

So, \(y^8 = 1\), hence \(y = 1\).

Therefore, \(x^4 = 2 y^2 = 2\), so \(x = \sqrt{2}\).

Then, \(z = 2/(x y) = 2 / (\sqrt{2} \cdot 1) = \sqrt{2}\).

Wait, so \(z = \sqrt{2}\), not 1. So, in the substitution method, I must have made a mistake earlier. I thought \(z = 1\), but it's actually \(\sqrt{2}\).

So, in the substitution method, the correct value of \(z\) is \(\sqrt{2}\), not 1.

So, recomputing the expression with \(x = \sqrt{2}\), \(y = 1\), \(z = \sqrt{2}\):

\(x^4 = (\sqrt{2})^4 = 4\)

\(4y^2 = 4 \times 1 = 4\)

\(4z^4 = 4 \times (\sqrt{2})^4 = 4 \times 4 = 16\)

Adding them up: \(4 + 4 + 16 = 24\). Wait, that's different from the previous result. So, substitution method gives 24, while Lagrange multipliers gave approximately 11.328.

Wait, that can't be. There must be a mistake in either the substitution method or the Lagrange multipliers.

Wait, let's re-examine the substitution method.

In substitution, after setting \(z = 2/(x y)\), the expression is \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4/(x^4 y^4)\).

Then, the partial derivatives:

1. \(\partial f / \partial x = 4x^3 - 16/(x^5 y^4)\)
2. \(\partial f / \partial y = 8y - 16/(x^4 y^5)\)

Setting them to zero:

1. \(4x^3 = 16/(x^5 y^4)\) => \(x^8 y^4 = 4\)
2. \(8y = 16/(x^4 y^5)\) => \(x^4 y^6 = 2\)

Dividing equation 1 by equation 2:

\(x^4 / y^2 = 2\) => \(x^4 = 2 y^2\) => \(x^2 = \sqrt{2} y\)

So, \(x = \sqrt{\sqrt{2} y}\)

Substituting into equation 2:

\(x^4 y^6 = 2\)

\( (2 y^2) y^6 = 2 y^8 = 2 \) => \(y^8 = 1\) => \(y = 1\)

Therefore, \(x^4 = 2 y^2 = 2*1 = 2\), so \(x = \sqrt{2}\)

Then, \(z = 2 / (x y) = 2 / (\sqrt{2} * 1) = \sqrt{2}\)

Therefore, the expression is \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 = 2 + 4 + 4*(\sqrt{2})^4 = 2 + 4 + 4*4 = 2 + 4 + 16 = 22\). Wait, that's 22? But earlier I thought it was 24. Wait, no, 4*(\sqrt{2})^4 is 4*(4) = 16, so 2 + 4 + 16 = 22.

But in the Lagrange multipliers, I found approximately 11.328, which is less than 22. That means one of the methods is incorrect.

Wait, but according to substitution, the minimal value is 22, and according to Lagrange multipliers, it's about 11.328, which is lower. Since 11.328 is less than 22, but substitution suggests 22, I must have made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated in substitution.

Wait, when I set \(z = 2/(x y)\), so \(z^4 = (2/(x y))^4 = 16/(x^4 y^4)\). Therefore, \(4 z^4 = 64/(x^4 y^4)\). Wait, no, in the expression, it's \(4 z^4\), so \(4*(16/(x^4 y^4)) = 64/(x^4 y^4)\). Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, no: in substitution, I have \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\), and \(z = 2/(x y)\), so \(z^4 = (2/(x y))^4 = 16/(x^4 y^4)\). Therefore, \(4 z^4 = 64/(x^4 y^4)\). Wait, so the expression is \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 64/(x^4 y^4)\). Wait, that's different from what I had earlier.

Wait, in substitution, I thought \(4 z^4 = 16/(x^4 y^4)\), but actually, \(z^4 = (2/(x y))^4 = 16/(x^4 y^4)\), so \(4 z^4 = 64/(x^4 y^4)\). So, the expression is:

\(x^4 + 4y^2 + 64/(x^4 y^4)\)

Ah, that's where I messed up earlier. So, with \(x = \sqrt{2}\), \(y = 1\), \(z = \sqrt{2}\):

\(x^4 = 4\)

\(4y^2 = 4\)

\(64/(x^4 y^4) = 64/(4 * 1) = 16\)

So, total expression is 4 + 4 + 16 = 24

So, substitution method also gives 24, which matches the Lagrange multipliers result.

Wow, okay, so I must have made an error in substituting \(4 z^4\) earlier, thinking it was \(16/(x^4 y^4)\) instead of \(64/(x^4 y^4)\). That was my mistake.

So, both methods give 24 as the minimal value, which is consistent.

Therefore, the minimal value is 24, achieved when \(x = \sqrt{2}\), \(y = 1\), \(z = \sqrt{2}\).

Wait, but earlier in substitution, I thought it was 22, but that was a miscalculation.

Wait, but in the Lagrange multipliers, I also got 24, so that's consistent.

Therefore, the minimal value is 24.

But let me check back with the substitution method:

After correctly substituting \(z = 2/(x y)\), the expression becomes:

\(x^4 + 4y^2 + 64/(x^4 y^4)\)

Then, taking partial derivatives:

1. \(4x^3 - 256/(x^5 y^4)\) set to zero
2. \(8y - 256/(x^4 y^5)\) set to zero

Dividing equation 1 by equation 2:

\(x^4 / y^2 = 2\), so \(x^2 = \sqrt{2} y\)

Substituting into equation 2:

\(x^4 y^6 = 2\)

Which gives \(y^8 = 1\), \(y = 1\), \(x^4 = 2\), so \(x = \sqrt{2}\), \(z = \sqrt{2}\)

Thus, expression is \(4 + 4 + 16 = 24\)

Therefore, both methods confirm that the minimal value is 24.

Wait, but in the initial substitution, I thought the expression was \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\), but since \(z = 2/(x y)\), \(z^4 = 16/(x^4 y^4)\), so \(4 z^4 = 64/(x^4 y^4)\). Therefore, the expression is \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 64/(x^4 y^4)\). Hence, the minimal value is 24.

So, the answer is 24.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{24}
</think>

Given \(x, y,\) and \(z\) are positive real numbers such that \(xyz = 2\), we need to find the minimum value of the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\).

First, we use the substitution \(z = \frac{2}{xy}\) to express the problem in terms of \(x\) and \(y\). Substituting \(z\) into the expression, we get:

\[
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4\left(\frac{2}{xy}\right)^4 = x^4 + 4y^2 + \frac{64}{x^4 y^4}
\]

We then use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the critical points. Define the function \(f(x, y, z) = x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\) and the constraint \(g(x, y, z) = xyz - 2 = 0\). The gradients are:

\[
\nabla f = (4x^3, 8y, 16z^3)
\]
\[
\nabla g = (yz, xz, xy)
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations:

1. \(4x^3 = \lambda yz\)
2. \(8y = \lambda xz\)
3. \(16z^3 = \lambda xy\)
4. \(xyz = 2\)

By dividing the equations, we find relationships between \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). Solving these, we find \(x = \sqrt{2}\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = \sqrt{2}\). Substituting these values back into the expression, we get:

\[
x^4 = (\sqrt{2})^4 = 4
\]
\[
4y^2 = 4 \times 1^2 = 4
\]
\[
4z^4 = 4 \times (\sqrt{2})^4 = 4 \times 4 = 16
\]

Adding these, we get the minimum value:

\[
4 + 4 + 16 = 24
\]

Thus, the minimum value of the expression is \(\boxed{24}\).
