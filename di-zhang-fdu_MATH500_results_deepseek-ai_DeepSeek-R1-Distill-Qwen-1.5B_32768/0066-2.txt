Question:
Let $F(z)=\frac{z+i}{z-i}$ for all complex numbers $z\not= i,$ and let $z_n=F(z_{n-1})$ for all positive integers $n.$ Given that $z_0=\frac 1{137}+i,$ find $z_{2002}.$

Correct Answer:
Iterating $F$ a few times, we get \[\begin{aligned} F(F(z)) &= \frac{\frac{z+i}{z-i}+i}{\frac{z+i}{z-i}-i} = \frac{(z+i)+i(z-i)}{(z+i)-i(z-i)}= \frac{z+i+zi+1}{z+i-zi-1}= \frac{(z+1)(i+1)}{(z-1)(1-i)}\\
&= \frac{(z+1)(i+1)^2}{(z-1) \cdot 2}= \frac{(z+1)(2i)}{(z-1) \cdot 2} = \frac{z+1}{z-1}i,\\
F(F(F(z))) &= \frac{\frac{z+1}{z-1}i+i}{\frac{z+1}{z-1}i-i} = \frac{\frac{z+1}{z-1}+1}{\frac{z+1}{z-1}-1} = \frac{(z+1)+(z-1)}{(z+1)-(z-1)}= z. \end{aligned}\]Thus, $z_{k+3} = z_k$ for all $k.$ Since $2002 \equiv 1 \pmod{3},$ we then have \[z_{2002} = z_1 = \frac{z_0+i}{z_0-i} = \frac{1/137 + 2i}{1/137} = \boxed{1+274i}.\]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find \( z_{2002} \) given the function \( F(z) = \frac{z + i}{z - i} \) and the recursive sequence defined by \( z_n = F(z_{n-1}) \) with the initial term \( z_0 = \frac{1}{137} + i \). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by applying the function \( F \) to the previous term. So \( z_1 = F(z_0) \), \( z_2 = F(z_1) \), and so on. Since the recursion is applied repeatedly, this might lead to a cycle or some periodic behavior. Maybe if I compute the first few terms, I can spot a pattern or find a cycle length that I can use to determine \( z_{2002} \).

Let me start by computing \( z_1 \). Given \( z_0 = \frac{1}{137} + i \), plugging into \( F(z) \):

\[
z_1 = F(z_0) = \frac{\left( \frac{1}{137} + i \right) + i}{\left( \frac{1}{137} + i \right) - i} = \frac{\frac{1}{137} + 2i}{\frac{1}{137}} = \frac{\frac{1}{137}}{\frac{1}{137}} + \frac{2i}{\frac{1}{137}} = 1 + 2i \times 137 = 1 + 274i
\]

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, the numerator is \( \frac{1}{137} + i + i = \frac{1}{137} + 2i \). The denominator is \( \frac{1}{137} + i - i = \frac{1}{137} \). So, \( z_1 = \frac{\frac{1}{137} + 2i}{\frac{1}{137}} \). Let me divide both numerator terms by \( \frac{1}{137} \):

\( \frac{\frac{1}{137}}{\frac{1}{137}} = 1 \), and \( \frac{2i}{\frac{1}{137}} = 2i \times 137 = 274i \). So, yes, \( z_1 = 1 + 274i \). Okay, that seems correct.

Now, let me compute \( z_2 = F(z_1) \). So, substituting \( z_1 = 1 + 274i \) into \( F \):

First, compute the numerator: \( (1 + 274i) + i = 1 + 275i \).

Compute the denominator: \( (1 + 274i) - i = 1 + 273i \).

So, \( z_2 = \frac{1 + 275i}{1 + 273i} \).

Hmm, maybe I can simplify this complex fraction by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \( 1 + 273i \) is \( 1 - 273i \).

So, multiplying numerator and denominator by \( 1 - 273i \):

Numerator: \( (1 + 275i)(1 - 273i) \).

Denominator: \( (1 + 273i)(1 - 273i) \).

Let me compute denominator first:

Denominator: \( (1)^2 - (273i)^2 = 1 - (273)^2(-1) = 1 + (273)^2 \).

Compute \( 273^2 \):

273 * 273. Let me see, 270^2 is 72900, and then 270*3 + 3*270 + 3^2 = 2700 + 810 + 9 = 3579, so 273^2 = (270 + 3)^2 = 270^2 + 2*270*3 + 3^2 = 72900 + 1620 + 9 = 74529.

So denominator is 1 + 74529 = 74530.

Now numerator: \( (1 + 275i)(1 - 273i) \).

Multiply using FOIL:

First: 1*1 = 1.

Outer: 1*(-273i) = -273i.

Inner: 275i*1 = 275i.

Last: 275i*(-273i) = -275*273 i^2.

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes +275*273.

So, numerator is:

1 - 273i + 275i + 275*273.

Combine like terms:

1 + ( -273i + 275i ) + 275*273.

Compute the imaginary part: (275 - 273)i = 2i.

Compute the real part: 1 + 275*273.

Compute 275*273:

Hmm, 275*200 = 55,000

275*70 = 19,250

275*3 = 825

So total: 55,000 + 19,250 = 74,250 + 825 = 75,075

So real part is 1 + 75,075 = 75,076.

Therefore, numerator is 75,076 + 2i.

So, \( z_2 = \frac{75,076 + 2i}{74,530} \).

Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 2:

Numerator: 75,076 / 2 = 37,538; 2i / 2 = i.

Denominator: 74,530 / 2 = 37,265.

So, \( z_2 = \frac{37,538 + i}{37,265} \).

Wait, but 37,538 is just over 37,265, so maybe we can write this as \( 1 + \frac{273 + i}{37,265} \).

But perhaps I made a mistake here because 37,538 is 74,530 / 2, so \( 37,538 = 74,530 / 2 \). So, \( z_2 = \frac{74,530 / 2 + i}{74,530} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{i}{74,530} \).

Wait, that seems too small. Let me check my calculations again because that seems odd.

Wait, numerator was 75,076 + 2i, and denominator was 74,530. So, dividing numerator by denominator:

75,076 / 74,530 = approximately 1.0069, and 2i / 74,530 is approximately 0.0000268i.

So, approximately, \( z_2 \approx 1.0069 + 0.0000268i \). Hmm, that seems quite close to 1, but not exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication earlier.

Wait, let me verify the multiplication of (1 + 275i)(1 - 273i):

First term: 1*1 = 1.

Outer term: 1*(-273i) = -273i.

Inner term: 275i*1 = 275i.

Last term: 275i*(-273i) = -275*273 i^2.

Which is -275*273*(-1) = +275*273.

So, adding up real parts: 1 + 275*273.

Imaginary parts: (-273i + 275i) = 2i.

So, numerator is (1 + 275*273) + 2i.

275*273: Let me compute 275*270 = 74,250; 275*3=825; so total 74,250 + 825 = 75,075.

Therefore, numerator is 1 + 75,075 = 75,076 + 2i, which is correct.

Denominator is 74,530, so \( z_2 = \frac{75,076 + 2i}{74,530} \).

So, simplifying:

75,076 divided by 74,530 is equal to 1 + (546 / 74,530). Let me compute 546 / 74,530.

Wait, 74,530 divided by 546 is approximately 135.6, so 546 / 74,530 is approximately 0.0073. So, \( z_2 \approx 1 + 0.0073 + 0.0000268i \approx 1.0073 + 0.0000268i \).

Wait, that seems very close to 1. Maybe this is going towards 1? But I have a feeling something's wrong here because if \( z_1 = 1 + 274i \), and \( z_2 \) is approximately 1.0073 + 0.0000268i, which is approaching 1, maybe the sequence is approaching 1?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where after a few iterations, the terms cycle. Because if I compute \( z_3 \), maybe it will come back to something similar.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that this function \( F(z) \) is a Möbius transformation, which can be represented as a matrix and its powers can be found using matrix exponentiation, which might help in finding a periodic cycle.

Wait, Möbius transformations have properties that can be analyzed using their associated matrices. The function \( F(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d} \) corresponds to the matrix \( \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \). The composition of two such functions corresponds to multiplying their matrices. So, perhaps I can represent \( F \) as a matrix and then compute \( F^n \) by raising the matrix to the nth power, which might reveal a cycle.

Let me try that approach.

So, first, write \( F(z) = \frac{z + i}{z - i} \) in the form \( \frac{az + b}{cz + d} \). Comparing, we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 1 \), \( d = -1 \). So the matrix is:

\[
M = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, to compute \( F^n(z) \), we can compute \( M^n \) and then invert it.

But to compute \( M^n \), perhaps it's easier to diagonalize \( M \) if possible. Let me find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The characteristic equation is \( \det(M - \lambda I) = 0 \):

\[
\det\left( \begin{pmatrix} 1 - \lambda & 1 \\ 1 & -1 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \right) = (1 - \lambda)(-1 - \lambda) - 1 \times 1 = (-1 - \lambda + \lambda + \lambda^2) - 1 = \lambda^2 - 2.
\]

Wait, that's \( \lambda^2 - 2 = 0 \), so eigenvalues are \( \lambda = \sqrt{2} \) and \( \lambda = -\sqrt{2} \). Hmm, that might be messy, but perhaps I can proceed.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvectors. For eigenvalue \( \sqrt{2} \):

Solve \( (M - \sqrt{2} I) v = 0 \).

Compute \( M - \sqrt{2} I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 - \sqrt{2} & 1 \\ 1 & -1 - \sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} \).

The first row gives \( (1 - \sqrt{2})v_1 + v_2 = 0 \), so \( v_2 = (\sqrt{2} - 1) v_1 \).

So, an eigenvector is \( v = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} - 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

Similarly, for eigenvalue \( -\sqrt{2} \):

\( M - (-\sqrt{2}) I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \sqrt{2} & 1 \\ 1 & -1 + \sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} \).

First row: \( (1 + \sqrt{2}) v_1 + v_2 = 0 \), so \( v_2 = - (1 + \sqrt{2}) v_1 \).

So, eigenvector is \( v = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ - (1 + \sqrt{2}) \end{pmatrix} \).

So, matrix \( M \) can be diagonalized as \( M = PDP^{-1} \), where \( D \) is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, and \( P \) is the matrix of eigenvectors.

Therefore, \( M^n = PD^nP^{-1} \).

Once I have \( M^n \), the corresponding Möbius transformation is \( F^n(z) = \frac{ (M^n)_{11} z + (M^n)_{12} }{ (M^n)_{21} z + (M^n)_{22} } \).

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps instead of working with matrices, I can use the recursive relation to find a cycle.

Given the recursive formula \( z_{n} = F(z_{n-1}) \), which is \( z_n = \frac{z_{n-1} + i}{z_{n-1} - i} \). Let me try computing a few more terms to see if a cycle emerges.

Earlier, I found \( z_0 = \frac{1}{137} + i \), \( z_1 = 1 + 274i \), \( z_2 \approx 1.0073 + 0.0000268i \). Let me compute \( z_3 \):

\( z_3 = F(z_2) = \frac{z_2 + i}{z_2 - i} \).

Given \( z_2 = \frac{37,538 + i}{37,265} \approx 1.0073 + 0.0000268i \), let me compute \( z_2 + i \) and \( z_2 - i \).

Compute \( z_2 + i = \frac{37,538 + i}{37,265} + i = \frac{37,538 + i + i \times 37,265}{37,265} \).

Compute numerator: \( 37,538 + i + 37,265i = 37,538 + (1 + 37,265)i = 37,538 + 37,266i \).

So, \( z_2 + i = \frac{37,538 + 37,266i}{37,265} \).

Similarly, \( z_2 - i = \frac{37,538 + i}{37,265} - i = \frac{37,538 + i - i \times 37,265}{37,265} \).

Compute numerator: \( 37,538 + i - 37,265i = 37,538 - 37,264i \).

So, \( z_2 - i = \frac{37,538 - 37,264i}{37,265} \).

Therefore, \( z_3 = \frac{37,538 + 37,266i}{37,265} / \frac{37,538 - 37,264i}{37,265} = \frac{37,538 + 37,266i}{37,538 - 37,264i} \).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

Numerator: \( (37,538 + 37,266i)(37,538 + 37,264i) \).

Denominator: \( (37,538)^2 - (37,264i)^2 = (37,538)^2 - (37,264)^2 (-1) = (37,538)^2 + (37,264)^2 \).

This is getting really messy, but let me compute the numerator:

First, multiply \( (a + b)(a + c) = a^2 + a(c + b) + bc \). Let me use \( a = 37,538 \), \( b = 37,266i \), \( c = 37,264i \).

So,

Numerator: \( a^2 + a(b + c) + bc \).

Compute each term:

1. \( a^2 = (37,538)^2 \). I'm not going to compute this exactly, but maybe it's equal to \( (1 + 274i)(1 - 273i) \) scaled somehow? Wait, maybe there's a pattern.

Wait, hold on. Let me think about the function \( F(z) \). It's a Möbius transformation, so applying it twice should give me back something related to z. Maybe let's compute \( F(F(z)) \) and see if it's a linear function of z.

Compute \( F(F(z)) \):

First, \( F(z) = \frac{z + i}{z - i} \).

Then, \( F(F(z)) = \frac{ \frac{z + i}{z - i} + i }{ \frac{z + i}{z - i} - i } \).

Simplify numerator:

\( \frac{z + i}{z - i} + i = \frac{z + i + i(z - i)}{z - i} = \frac{z + i + iz - i^2}{z - i} = \frac{z + i + iz + 1}{z - i} = \frac{(z + iz) + (i + 1)}{z - i} = \frac{z(1 + i) + (1 + i)}{z - i} = \frac{(1 + i)(z + 1)}{z - i} \).

Similarly, denominator:

\( \frac{z + i}{z - i} - i = \frac{z + i - i(z - i)}{z - i} = \frac{z + i - iz + i^2}{z - i} = \frac{z + i - iz - 1}{z - i} = \frac{(z - iz) + (i - 1)}{z - i} = \frac{z(1 - i) + (i - 1)}{z - i} = \frac{(1 - i)(z - 1)}{z - i} \).

So, \( F(F(z)) = \frac{(1 + i)(z + 1)}{z - i} / \frac{(1 - i)(z - 1)}{z - i} = \frac{(1 + i)(z + 1)}{(1 - i)(z - 1)} \).

Simplify this:

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( (1 + i) \) and \( (1 + i) \) respectively? Wait, actually, \( (1 - i)(1 + i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2 \).

So, rewrite the expression:

\( F(F(z)) = \frac{(1 + i)(z + 1)}{(1 - i)(z - 1)} = \frac{(1 + i)(z + 1)}{(1 - i)(z - 1)} \times \frac{(1 + i)}{(1 + i)} \) to rationalize denominator.

Wait, alternatively, note that \( \frac{(1 + i)}{(1 - i)} = \frac{(1 + i)^2}{(1)^2 - (i)^2} = \frac{1 + 2i + i^2}{1 - (-1)} = \frac{1 + 2i - 1}{2} = \frac{2i}{2} = i \).

So, \( \frac{(1 + i)}{(1 - i)} = i \).

Therefore, \( F(F(z)) = \frac{(z + 1)}{(z - 1)} \times i \).

So, \( F(F(z)) = i \cdot \frac{z + 1}{z - 1} \).

Hmm, that's interesting. So, applying \( F \) twice gives me \( i \cdot \frac{z + 1}{z - 1} \). Maybe applying \( F \) four times would bring us back to something.

Let me compute \( F(F(F(F(z)))) \):

First, \( F(F(z)) = i \cdot \frac{z + 1}{z - 1} \).

Let me denote \( w = F(F(z)) = i \cdot \frac{z + 1}{z - 1} \).

Then, \( F(F(F(z))) = F(w) = \frac{w + i}{w - i} \).

Substitute \( w = i \cdot \frac{z + 1}{z - 1} \):

Compute numerator: \( w + i = i \cdot \frac{z + 1}{z - 1} + i = i \left( \frac{z + 1}{z - 1} + 1 \right) = i \left( \frac{z + 1 + z - 1}{z - 1} \right) = i \cdot \frac{2z}{z - 1} \).

Denominator: \( w - i = i \cdot \frac{z + 1}{z - 1} - i = i \left( \frac{z + 1}{z - 1} - 1 \right) = i \cdot \frac{z + 1 - (z - 1)}{z - 1} = i \cdot \frac{2}{z - 1} \).

Therefore, \( F(F(F(z))) = \frac{ i \cdot \frac{2z}{z - 1} }{ i \cdot \frac{2}{z - 1} } = \frac{2z}{z - 1} \).

So, \( F(F(F(z))) = \frac{2z}{z - 1} \).

Now, compute \( F(F(F(F(z)))) = F\left( \frac{2z}{z - 1} \right) \).

So, let me compute \( F\left( \frac{2z}{z - 1} \right) \):

\( F(w) = \frac{w + i}{w - i} \), where \( w = \frac{2z}{z - 1} \).

Compute numerator: \( \frac{2z}{z - 1} + i = \frac{2z + i(z - 1)}{z - 1} = \frac{2z + iz - i}{z - 1} = \frac{(2 + i)z - i}{z - 1} \).

Denominator: \( \frac{2z}{z - 1} - i = \frac{2z - i(z - 1)}{z - 1} = \frac{2z - iz + i}{z - 1} = \frac{(2 - i)z + i}{z - 1} \).

So, \( F(w) = \frac{(2 + i)z - i}{(2 - i)z + i} \).

Hmm, that's a linear transformation. Let me write it as \( F(F(F(F(z)))) = \frac{(2 + i)z - i}{(2 - i)z + i} \).

Hmm, that's still a Möbius transformation, but it's not obviously a cycle yet. Maybe if I keep applying \( F \) four times, I can get a pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each application of \( F \) is a linear fractional transformation, and after four applications, we might have a rotation or scaling.

Wait, I know that Möbius transformations can be composed by matrix multiplication, so maybe I can represent \( F \) as a matrix \( M \) and compute \( M^4 \) to find the effect after four transformations.

Earlier, I found the matrix \( M = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \). So, \( M^4 \) would be \( M^2 \times M^2 \), but instead, perhaps compute \( M^3 \) and \( M^4 \).

But this seems complicated, perhaps I can instead find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( M \) and then raise it to the fourth power.

Earlier, I found that the eigenvalues are \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \). So, if I can diagonalize \( M \), then \( M^n = P D^n P^{-1} \), where \( D \) is diagonal with \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \).

But wait, let me recall that \( M \) has eigenvalues \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \). So, when we raise \( M \) to the nth power, the eigenvalues become \( (\sqrt{2})^n \) and \( (- \sqrt{2})^n \).

But perhaps I need to find \( M^4 \). Let me compute \( M^2 \):

\( M^2 = M \times M = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1*1 + 1*1 & 1*1 + 1*(-1) \\ 1*1 + (-1)*1 & 1*1 + (-1)*(-1) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + 1 & 1 - 1 \\ 1 - 1 & 1 + 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix} = 2I \).

Wow, so \( M^2 = 2I \). Therefore, \( (M^2)^2 = (2I)^2 = 4I \), so \( M^4 = (M^2)^2 = (2I)^2 = 4I \).

Therefore, \( M^4 = 4I \). So, \( M^n = M^{4k + r} = (M^4)^k \times M^r = 4^k I \times M^r \).

Therefore, \( M^n = 4^{n/4} M^{n \mod 4} \).

But since \( 4^{n/4} = (2^2)^{n/4} = 2^{n/2} \), which is real. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, actually, since \( M^2 = 2I \), then \( M^4 = (M^2)^2 = (2I)^2 = 4I \). So, every four multiplications, it goes back to 4I. So, for any n, \( M^n = (M^4)^{n/4} = (4I)^{n/4} \).

But this is only if n is a multiple of 4, which is not necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps I can express \( M^n \) in terms of powers.

Wait, let me try calculating \( M^1 \), \( M^2 \), \( M^3 \), \( M^4 \):

- \( M^1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \).
- \( M^2 = 2I \).
- \( M^3 = M^2 \times M = 2I \times M = 2M \).
- \( M^4 = M^2 \times M^2 = (2I)(2I) = 4I \).

So, in general, for any integer k:

- If k is 1 mod 4: \( M^k = M \).
- If k is 2 mod 4: \( M^k = 2I \).
- If k is 3 mod 4: \( M^k = 2M \).
- If k is 0 mod 4: \( M^k = 4I \).

Therefore, \( M^n \) cycles every 4 powers.

Therefore, to compute \( M^n \), we can write \( n = 4k + r \), where r is 0,1,2,3. Then, \( M^n = 4^k \times M^r \).

So, applying this to our problem, since we have \( M^4 = 4I \), \( M^5 = M^4 \times M = 4M \), \( M^6 = M^5 \times M = 4M \times M = 4M^2 = 8I \), \( M^7 = M^6 \times M = 8I \times M = 8M \), \( M^8 = M^7 \times M = 8M \times M = 8 \times 2I = 16I \), and so on.

But perhaps instead of focusing on \( M^n \), since \( z_{n} = F^{(n)}(z_0) \), which corresponds to \( M^n \) acting on \( z_0 \), perhaps I can find a pattern.

Wait, but since \( z_n = F^n(z_0) \), which is equivalent to \( M^n z_0 \) in the matrix sense, but actually, in the Möbius transformation, applying \( F \) corresponds to multiplying by \( M \) and then inverting.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me recall that if \( z_{n} = \frac{az_{n-1} + b}{cz_{n-1} + d} \), then \( z_{n} = \frac{ (a + bd^{-1}) + (b - ad^{-1}) z_{n-1} }{ (c + dd^{-1}) + (d - ac^{-1}) z_{n-1} } \).

But maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, since \( z_n = F(z_{n-1}) \), and I know that \( F \) corresponds to the matrix \( M \), then \( z_n = M^n z_0 \) in the projective sense.

But wait, in Möbius transformations, the relation is \( z_n = \frac{M^n z_0 + N}{M^n w + N} \) if I include a constant term, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps I can think of \( z_n = \frac{M^n z_0 + c}{M^n w + d} \) where \( w \) is some constant? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the action of \( M^n \) on \( z_0 \).

Given that, \( z_n = \frac{(M^n) z_0 + 0}{0 + (M^{-n}) \infty} \), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the transformation as \( z_n = \frac{a^n z_0 + b_n}{c_n z_0 + d_n} \), but it's getting too vague.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that \( F \) corresponds to multiplying by \( M \) and then inverting. So, \( F^n(z) = \frac{M^n z + N}{D z + E} \), but I don't know N and D.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that \( z_n = \frac{M^n z_0}{1} \). But no, because Möbius transformations don't just scale; they can also rotate and translate.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to compute \( M^n \), I can compute the nth iterate of \( F \) and see if it cycles.

Given that \( F(F(F(F(z)))) = \frac{2z}{z - 1} \), which is another Möbius transformation. Let's denote this as \( F^4(z) = \frac{2z}{z - 1} \).

Then, let's compute \( F^8(z) = F^4(F^4(z)) = F^4\left( \frac{2z}{z - 1} \right) \).

Compute \( F^4\left( \frac{2z}{z - 1} \right) = \frac{2 \times \frac{2z}{z - 1}}{ \frac{2z}{z - 1} - 1 } = \frac{ \frac{4z}{z - 1} }{ \frac{2z - (z - 1)}{z - 1} } = \frac{4z}{2z - z + 1} = \frac{4z}{z + 1} \).

So, \( F^8(z) = \frac{4z}{z + 1} \).

Now, compute \( F^{12}(z) = F^4(F^8(z)) = F^4\left( \frac{4z}{z + 1} \right) = \frac{2 \times \frac{4z}{z + 1}}{ \frac{4z}{z + 1} - 1 } = \frac{ \frac{8z}{z + 1} }{ \frac{4z - (z + 1)}{z + 1} } = \frac{8z}{4z - z - 1} = \frac{8z}{3z - 1} \).

Hmm, so \( F^{12}(z) = \frac{8z}{3z - 1} \).

Continuing this pattern, perhaps \( F^{16}(z) = F^4(F^{12}(z)) = F^4\left( \frac{8z}{3z - 1} \right) \).

Compute \( F^4\left( \frac{8z}{3z - 1} \right) = \frac{2 \times \frac{8z}{3z - 1}}{ \frac{8z}{3z - 1} - 1 } = \frac{ \frac{16z}{3z - 1} }{ \frac{8z - (3z - 1)}{3z - 1} } = \frac{16z}{8z - 3z + 1} = \frac{16z}{5z + 1} \).

Hmm, so \( F^{16}(z) = \frac{16z}{5z + 1} \).

Wait, I see a pattern here:

- \( F^4(z) = \frac{2z}{z - 1} \)
- \( F^8(z) = \frac{4z}{z + 1} \)
- \( F^{12}(z) = \frac{8z}{3z - 1} \)
- \( F^{16}(z) = \frac{16z}{5z + 1} \)

So, the numerator is doubling each time, and the denominator seems to be following a sequence: starting with 1, then 1, then 3, then 5, which are odd numbers. Wait, 1, 1, 3, 5. Hmm, not exactly. Wait, no, numerator is 2z, 4z, 8z, 16z, which is 2^n z. The denominators are z - 1, z + 1, 3z - 1, 5z + 1.

Wait, 3z - 1 is like (z - 1) + 2z, and 5z + 1 is (z + 1) + 4z. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, notice that the denominator for \( F^{4k}(z) \) is \( (1 + 2k)z + (-1)^k \).

Wait, for \( F^4(z) \), k=1: \( (1 + 2*1)z + (-1)^1 = 3z - 1 \), but actual denominator is \( z - 1 \). Hmm, doesn't fit.

Wait, for \( F^8(z) \), k=2: \( (1 + 2*2)z + (-1)^2 = 5z + 1 \), but actual denominator is \( z + 1 \). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, looking at the denominators:

- \( F^4(z) \): \( z - 1 \)
- \( F^8(z) \): \( z + 1 \)
- \( F^{12}(z) \): \( 3z - 1 \)
- \( F^{16}(z) \): \( 5z + 1 \)

Wait, the coefficients of z in the denominator for \( F^{4k}(z) \) seem to be 1, 1, 3, 5, which are the odd numbers. Specifically, the denominator for \( F^{4k}(z) \) is \( (2k - 1)z + (-1)^{k} \).

Wait, for \( F^4(z) \), k=1: \( (2*1 -1)z + (-1)^1 = z - 1 \). Correct.

For \( F^8(z) \), k=2: \( (2*2 -1)z + (-1)^2 = 3z + 1 \). But in reality, it's \( z + 1 \). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps another pattern. The denominators for \( F^{4k}(z) \) are:

- \( F^4(z) \): denominator \( z - 1 \)
- \( F^8(z) \): denominator \( z + 1 \)
- \( F^{12}(z) \): denominator \( 3z - 1 \)
- \( F^{16}(z) \): denominator \( 5z + 1 \)

Wait, the coefficients of z in the denominator are 1, 1, 3, 5, which are 1, 1, 3, 5, which are the odd numbers, but the constants are -1, +1, -1, +1. Hmm, so perhaps for \( F^{4k}(z) \), the denominator is \( (2k - 1)z + (-1)^k \).

Testing this:

For \( k = 1 \): \( (2*1 -1)z + (-1)^1 = z - 1 \). Correct.

For \( k = 2 \): \( (2*2 -1)z + (-1)^2 = 3z + 1 \). But in reality, it's \( z + 1 \). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe that's not the right pattern. Alternatively, the constant term is \( (-1)^k \), and the coefficient of z is \( 2k - 1 \).

Wait, for \( F^{12}(z) \), k=3: \( (2*3 -1)z + (-1)^3 = 5z - 1 \). But in reality, it's \( 3z - 1 \). So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's not a straightforward pattern. Maybe I need to find a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of trying to compute \( F^n \), I can recognize that after 4 iterations, the transformation cycles in a certain way.

But I might be overcomplicating. Let's try to compute \( z_4 \) using \( z_3 \) and \( z_2 \), as I started before.

Earlier, I had:

\( z_3 = \frac{37,538 + 268i}{37,264} \).

Wait, but perhaps I can compute \( z_3 \) as follows:

Given \( z_2 = \frac{37,538 + i}{37,264} \), then \( z_3 = \frac{z_2 + i}{z_2 - i} \).

So, compute numerator: \( z_2 + i = \frac{37,538 + i}{37,264} + i = \frac{37,538 + i + 37,264i}{37,264} = \frac{37,538 + 37,265i}{37,264} \).

Denominator: \( z_2 - i = \frac{37,538 + i}{37,264} - i = \frac{37,538 + i - 37,264i}{37,264} = \frac{37,538 - 37,263i}{37,264} \).

So, \( z_3 = \frac{37,538 + 37,265i}{37,538 - 37,263i} \).

Now, let me compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \( 37,538 + 37,265i \).

Denominator: \( 37,538 - 37,263i \).

Let me write this as \( \frac{37,538 + 37,265i}{37,538 - 37,263i} \).

To simplify this, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

\( \frac{(37,538 + 37,265i)(37,538 + 37,263i)}{(37,538)^2 + (37,263)^2} \).

Compute numerator:

\( (37,538 + 37,265i)(37,538 + 37,263i) \).

Let me denote \( a = 37,538 \), \( b = 37,265 \), \( c = 37,263 \).

Then, numerator is \( (a + bi)(a + ci) = a^2 + a(c + b)i + (bi)(ci) = a^2 + a(c + b)i + b c i^2 \).

Compute each term:

1. \( a^2 = 37,538^2 \).
2. \( a(c + b)i = 37,538*(37,263 + 37,265)i = 37,538*(74,528)i \).
3. \( b c i^2 = 37,265 * 37,263 * (-1) \).

So, the numerator becomes:

\( a^2 - b c + [ a(c + b) ] i \).

Compute each term:

First, compute \( a^2 = 37,538^2 \). Hmm, 37,538 squared. Well, 37,538 is 37,500 + 38.

Compute \( (37,500 + 38)^2 = 37,500^2 + 2*37,500*38 + 38^2 = 1,406,250,000 + 2*1,425,000 + 1,444 = 1,406,250,000 + 2,850,000 + 1,444 = 1,409,101,444.

Next, compute \( b c = 37,265 * 37,263 \). Hmm, that's a bit tedious, but notice that \( 37,265 = 37,263 + 2 \). Therefore, \( 37,265 * 37,263 = (37,263 + 2)(37,263) = 37,263^2 + 2*37,263 \).

Compute \( 37,263^2 \). Again, 37,263 is 37,000 + 263.

Compute \( (37,000 + 263)^2 = 37,000^2 + 2*37,000*263 + 263^2 \).

Compute each term:

1. \( 37,000^2 = 1,369,000,000 \).
2. \( 2*37,000*263 = 74,000*263 = 74,000*200 + 74,000*63 = 14,800,000 + 4,662,000 = 19,462,000 \).
3. \( 263^2 = 69,169 \).

So, \( 37,263^2 = 1,369,000,000 + 19,462,000 + 69,169 = 1,388,531,169 \).

Then, \( 2*37,263 = 74,526 \). So, \( 37,265 * 37,263 = 1,388,531,169 + 74,526 = 1,388,605,695 \).

Therefore, \( numerator = a^2 - b c + [ a(c + b) ] i = 1,409,101,444 - 1,388,605,695 + [ 37,538*(37,263 + 37,265) ] i \).

Compute \( 1,409,101,444 - 1,388,605,695 = 20,495,749 \).

Compute \( 37,263 + 37,265 = 74,528 \).

So, numerator is \( 20,495,749 + 74,528 i \).

Denominator is \( a^2 + b^2 = (37,538)^2 + (37,263)^2 = 1,409,101,444 + 1,388,605,695 = 2,800,707,139 \).

Therefore, \( z_3 = \frac{20,495,749 + 74,528i}{2,800,707,139} \).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(20,495,749, 2,800,707,139). Let me see if 7 divides both:

20,495,749: 2+0+4+9+5+7+4+9 = 36, which is divisible by 3, but not necessarily 7.

Wait, 20,495,749 ÷ 7: 7*2,927,964 = 20,495,748, remainder 1. So, not divisible by 7.

Similarly, 2,800,707,139 ÷ 7: 7*400,101,020 = 2,800,707,140, remainder 89. So, no.

Similarly, 37,263 and 37,538: Let me check if 37 divides 37,263: 37*1000=37,000, 37,263-37,000=263. 263 ÷37≈7.1, so no. Similarly, 37,538 ÷37=1012, exactly. So, 37 divides 37,538, but not 37,263.

So, no common factors. Therefore, \( z_3 = \frac{20,495,749 + 74,528i}{2,800,707,139} \).

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but okay.

Wait, maybe instead of computing each term step by step, I can recognize a pattern or periodicity.

Given that \( z_{n} = F^n(z_0) \), and \( F \) is a Möbius transformation, the sequence \( z_n \) will eventually become periodic if we keep applying \( F \) repeatedly.

Given that the function \( F \) has two fixed points, 1 + 274i and -1 + 3572i, perhaps the sequence cycles between these two points?

Wait, let me check: applying \( F \) to 1 + 274i, which is a fixed point, should give 1 + 274i again.

Similarly, applying \( F \) to -1 + 3572i, which is another fixed point, should give -1 + 3572i.

So, if \( z_n \) cycles between these two fixed points, then the sequence would be periodic with period 2.

Wait, let me test that.

Compute \( z_1 = F(z_0) \). If \( z_1 \) is -1 + 3572i, then \( z_2 = F(z_1) = z_1 \), and so on.

Similarly, if \( z_1 \) is 1 + 274i, then \( z_2 = F(z_1) = z_1 \), etc.

Therefore, if we can show that \( z_1 \) is one of the fixed points, then the rest of the sequence is constant.

But in my earlier calculations, \( z_1 \) was approximately 1.0073 + 0.0000268i, which is not one of the fixed points. So, perhaps not.

Alternatively, let me compute \( z_2 \).

Earlier, \( z_2 = \frac{37,538 + i}{37,264} \approx 1.0073 + 0.0000268i \).

Is this equal to one of the fixed points? The fixed points are 1 + 274i and -1 + 3572i. So, no, it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find that \( z_2 \) is another fixed point or something else.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the behavior of \( F \). Since \( F \) is a Möbius transformation with two fixed points, the sequence \( z_n = F^n(z_0) \) will either converge to one of the fixed points or cycle between them.

But since \( z_0 \) is not a fixed point, and \( F \) has two fixed points, the orbit of \( z_0 \) under \( F \) will either be attracted to one fixed point or cycle between them.

In this case, since \( z_0 \) is a complex number, and \( F \) is linear fractional, the behavior is generally either converging or diverging, unless the fixed points are attracting.

But since \( F \) has two fixed points, the transformation can be classified into different cases: attracting, repelling, or neutral.

Given that, maybe I can compute the multiplier at the fixed points to determine their nature.

But this might be getting too complex for my current level.

Alternatively, perhaps noticing that the function \( F(z) = \frac{z + i}{z - i} \) is related to the function \( f(z) = \frac{z + i}{z - i} \), which is a Möbius transformation.

Let me compute the fixed points of \( F \):

Solve \( F(z) = z \):

\( \frac{z + i}{z - i} = z \).

Multiply both sides by \( z - i \):

\( z + i = z(z - i) \).

So, \( z + i = z^2 - i z \).

Bring all terms to one side:

\( z^2 - i z - z - i = 0 \).

Simplify:

\( z^2 - (i + 1) z - i = 0 \).

Using quadratic formula:

\( z = \frac{(i + 1) \pm \sqrt{(i + 1)^2 + 4i}}{2} \).

Compute discriminant:

\( (i + 1)^2 + 4i = (i^2 + 2i + 1) + 4i = (-1 + 2i + 1) + 4i = 2i + 4i = 6i \).

So, \( \sqrt{6i} \). Let me compute \( \sqrt{6i} \).

Express \( 6i \) in polar form: 6 cis π/2. The square root is \( \sqrt{6} \) cis π/4, which is \( \sqrt{6}/2 + i \sqrt{6}/2 \). So, \( \sqrt{6i} = \sqrt{6}/2 + i \sqrt{6}/2 \).

Therefore, fixed points:

\( z = \frac{(1 + i) \pm (\sqrt{6}/2 + i \sqrt{6}/2)}{2} \).

Compute both roots:

First root: \( \frac{1 + i + \sqrt{6}/2 + i \sqrt{6}/2}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{6}/2}{2} + \frac{1 + \sqrt{6}/2}{2}i \).

Second root: \( \frac{1 + i - \sqrt{6}/2 - i \sqrt{6}/2}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{6}/2}{2} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{6}/2}{2}i \).

Simplify:

First root: \( \frac{2 + \sqrt{6}}{4} + \frac{2 + \sqrt{6}}{4}i \).

Second root: \( \frac{2 - \sqrt{6}}{4} + \frac{2 - \sqrt{6}}{4}i \).

Wait, but earlier, I had the fixed points as 1 + 274i and -1 + 3572i. Hmm, that doesn't align with this, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, perhaps my initial fixed points were incorrect. Let me double-check.

Wait, earlier, I thought the fixed points were 1 + 274i and -1 + 3572i, but when computing the fixed points, I got different results.

Wait, no, let's re-examine.

Wait, earlier, I thought that fixed points were \( \sqrt{2}i \) and \( -\sqrt{2}i \). But that was under the assumption that \( F(z) = z \) leading to \( (1 + i)z = 2i \), which is z = 2i / (1 + i) = i(1 - i) = 1 + i, but that is not 1 + 274i.

Wait, so perhaps my earlier assumption about the fixed points was wrong.

Wait, going back, when I set \( F(z) = z \), I had:

\( \frac{z + i}{z - i} = z \).

Cross multiplying:

\( z + i = z(z - i) \).

So, \( z + i = z^2 - i z \).

Bring all terms to left:

\( z^2 - i z - z - i = 0 \).

Which is \( z^2 - (i + 1) z - i = 0 \).

So, quadratic equation with roots:

\( z = \frac{(i + 1) \pm \sqrt{(i + 1)^2 + 4i}}{2} \).

Compute discriminant:

\( (i + 1)^2 + 4i = (i^2 + 2i + 1) + 4i = (-1 + 2i + 1) + 4i = 2i + 4i = 6i \).

Therefore, sqrt(6i) = sqrt(6) (cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4)) = sqrt(6)/sqrt(2) + i sqrt(6)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(3) + i sqrt(3).

Therefore, the roots are:

\( z = \frac{(1 + i) \pm (\sqrt{3} + i \sqrt{3})}{2} \).

Compute both roots:

First root: \( \frac{1 + i + \sqrt{3} + i \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}i \).

Second root: \( \frac{1 + i - \sqrt{3} - i \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{3}}{2}i \).

So, fixed points are \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}i \) and \( \frac{1 - \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{3}}{2}i \).

These are complex numbers, but they are not 1 + 274i or -1 + 3572i as I thought earlier. So, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.

Therefore, going back, I think my earlier attempt is not useful, and I should stick to computing \( z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5 \) and see if a pattern emerges.

But perhaps noting that \( z_1 \) is approximately 1.0073 + 0.0000268i, which is close to 1, but not exactly. Similarly, \( z_2 \) is approximately 1.0073 + 0.0000268i, which suggests that \( z_2 \) is very close to 1, maybe even equal to 1.

Wait, maybe \( z_2 \) is exactly 1? Let me check.

Compute \( z_2 = \frac{37,538 + i}{37,264} \). Let me compute this as a decimal:

37,538 ÷ 37,264 ≈ 1.0073.

Similarly, 1 ÷ 37,264 ≈ 0.0000268.

Therefore, \( z_2 ≈ 1.0073 + 0.0000268i \), which is not 1. So, not equal to 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me recompute \( z_1 = F(z_0) \).

Given \( z_0 = \frac{1}{137 + i} \).

Compute \( 137 + i \) as \( \sqrt{137^2 + 1^2} e^{i \theta} \approx \sqrt{18769 + 1} e^{i 0.0031} \approx 137.0015 e^{i 0.0031} \).

Therefore, \( 1/(137 + i) \) is approximately \( \frac{1}{137} e^{-i 0.0031} \approx 0.007295 (1 - i 0.0031) \approx 0.007295 - 0.0000225i \).

So, approximately 0.007295 - 0.0000225i.

Then, \( z_1 = \frac{z_0 + i}{z_0 - i} \).

Compute numerator: 0.007295 - 0.0000225i + i = 0.007295 + (1 - 0.0000225)i ≈ 0.007295 + 0.9999775i.

Denominator: 0.007295 - 0.0000225i - i = 0.007295 - (1 + 0.0000225)i ≈ 0.007295 - 1.0000225i.

Therefore, \( z_1 ≈ \frac{0.007295 + 0.9999775i}{0.007295 - 1.0000225i} \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

\( \frac{(0.007295 + 0.9999775i)(0.007295 + 1.0000225i)}{(0.007295)^2 + (1.0000225)^2} \).

Compute denominator: \( (0.007295)^2 + (1.0000225)^2 ≈ 0.000053 + 1.000045 ≈ 1.000098 \).

Compute numerator:

First, 0.007295 * 0.007295 ≈ 0.0000532.

Second, 0.007295 * 1.0000225 ≈ 0.007295.

Third, 0.9999775i * 0.007295 ≈ 0.000734i.

Fourth, 0.9999775i * 1.0000225i ≈ 0.9999775 * 1.0000225 i^2 ≈ -0.9999775 * 1.0000225 ≈ -0.9999999.

So, numerator ≈ 0.0000532 + 0.007295 + 0.000734i - 0.9999999 ≈ (0.0000532 + 0.007295 - 0.9999999) + 0.000734i ≈ (-0.9926567) + 0.000734i.

Therefore, \( z_1 ≈ \frac{-0.9926567 + 0.000734i}{1.000098} ≈ -0.99265 + 0.00073i \).

Wait, that's approximately -0.99265 + 0.00073i, which is not 1, but close to -1. Hmm, so perhaps my initial thought about fixed points was incorrect. So, maybe \( z_1 \) is approximately -1?

Wait, no, because \( z_1 \) is \( F(z_0) \), and \( z_0 \) is a complex number near 0, so \( F(z_0) \) is near \( \frac{0 + i}{0 - i} = \frac{i}{-i} = -1 \). So, perhaps \( z_1 ≈ -1 \).

Similarly, \( z_2 = F(z_1) ≈ F(-1) = \frac{-1 + i}{-1 - i} \).

Compute \( F(-1) = \frac{-1 + i}{-1 - i} \). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-1 + i):

\( \frac{(-1 + i)^2}{(-1)^2 + (1)^2} = \frac{1 - 2i + i^2}{1 + 1} = \frac{1 - 2i -1}{2} = \frac{-2i}{2} = -i \).

So, \( z_2 ≈ -i \).

Then, \( z_3 = F(z_2) = F(-i) = \frac{-i + i}{-i - i} = \frac{0}{-2i} = 0 \).

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, \( F(-i) = \frac{-i + i}{-i - i} = \frac{0}{-2i} = 0 \).

But \( z_3 = 0 \).

Then, \( z_4 = F(z_3) = F(0) = \frac{0 + i}{0 - i} = \frac{i}{-i} = -1 \).

Then, \( z_5 = F(z_4) = F(-1) = -i \).

And so on. So, the sequence cycles between -1, -i, 0, -1, -i, 0, etc.

Wait, so the cycle is: -1, -i, 0, -1, -i, 0, ...

So, starting from \( z_2 = -i \), \( z_3 = 0 \), \( z_4 = -1 \), \( z_5 = -i \), \( z_6 = 0 \), \( z_7 = -1 \), etc.

Hence, starting from \( z_2 \), the sequence cycles every 3 terms: -i, 0, -1, -i, 0, -1, ...

Therefore, the cycle length is 3, and the sequence from \( z_2 \) onwards is periodic with period 3.

Therefore, to find \( z_{2077} \), we can note that starting from \( z_2 \), the cycle is of length 3: \( z_2 = -i \), \( z_3 = 0 \), \( z_4 = -1 \), \( z_5 = -i \), \( z_6 = 0 \), \( z_7 = -1 \), etc.

So, \( z_n \) for \( n \geq 2 \) cycles every 3 terms: -i, 0, -1, -i, 0, -1, ...

Therefore, \( z_{2077} \) can be found by determining the position of 2077 in the cycle.

First, note that \( z_2 \) corresponds to term 1 in the cycle.

So, the cycle is:

Term 2: -i

Term 3: 0

Term 4: -1

Term 5: -i

Term 6: 0

Term 7: -1

...

So, the cycle starts at term 2, with term 2: -i, term 3: 0, term 4: -1, term 5: -i, etc.

Thus, the cycle has a length of 3: -i, 0, -1.

Therefore, to find \( z_{2077} \), we need to see where 2077 falls in the cycle.

Compute the position within the cycle:

First, subtract 1 because term 2 is the first term in the cycle. So, starting from term 2, which is the 1st position in the cycle.

Therefore, position in cycle = (2077 - 1) mod 3 = 2076 mod 3.

Compute 2076 ÷ 3 = 692, remainder 0.

Therefore, 2076 mod 3 = 0.

Which corresponds to the last element in the cycle, which is -1.

Therefore, \( z_{2077} = -1 \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-1}
</think>

Given the function \( F(z) = \frac{z + i}{z - i} \) for complex numbers \( z \), we need to find \( z_{2077} \) where \( z_0 = \frac{1}{137 + i} \) and \( z_{n+1} = F(z_n) \) for each positive integer \( n \).

First, we compute \( z_0 \):
\[ z_0 = \frac{1}{137 + i} = \frac{137 - i}{137^2 + 1} = \frac{137 - i}{137^2 + 1} \]

Next, we find \( z_1 \):
\[ z_1 = F(z_0) = \frac{z_0 + i}{z_0 - i} \]
After simplifying, we find that \( z_1 \approx -1 \).

Continuing this process, we compute \( z_2 \):
\[ z_2 = F(z_1) = \frac{-1 + i}{-1 - i} \]
Simplifying, we find \( z_2 \approx -i \).

Next, we compute \( z_3 \):
\[ z_3 = F(z_2) = \frac{-i + i}{-i - i} = 0 \]

Then, we compute \( z_4 \):
\[ z_4 = F(z_3) = \frac{0 + i}{0 - i} = -1 \]

Continuing, we find:
\[ z_5 = F(z_4) = \frac{-1 + i}{-1 - i} \]
Simplifying, we find \( z_5 \approx -i \).

Next, we compute \( z_6 \):
\[ z_6 = F(z_5) = \frac{-i + i}{-i - i} = 0 \]

We observe that starting from \( z_2 \), the sequence cycles every 3 terms: \( -i, 0, -1 \).

To find \( z_{2077} \), we note that the cycle starts at \( z_2 \) and has a period of 3. We compute the position within the cycle:
- The position in the cycle is determined by \( (2077 - 1) \mod 3 = 2076 \mod 3 = 0 \).

Thus, \( z_{2077} \) corresponds to the last element in the cycle, which is \( -1 \).
