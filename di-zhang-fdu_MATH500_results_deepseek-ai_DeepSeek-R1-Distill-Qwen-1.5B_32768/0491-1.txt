Question:
Let $f(x)$ be an odd function, and let $g(x)$ be an even function.  Is $f(f(g(f(g(f(x))))))$ even, odd, or neither?

Enter "odd", "even", or "neither".

Correct Answer:
We have that
\[f(f(g(f(g(f(-x)))))) = f(f(g(f(g(-f(x)))))) = f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))),\]so the function is $\boxed{\text{even}}.$

More generally, if we have a composition of functions, and at least one of the functions is even, then the whole composition of functions is even.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out whether the composition of functions f and g, specifically f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) is even, odd, or neither. Both f(x) and g(x) are given as functions, with f being odd and g being even. Hmm, okay, let me recall what even and odd functions are.

An even function satisfies the condition that g(-x) = g(x) for all x in its domain. That means if you reflect the graph over the y-axis, it looks the same. Examples include functions like x² or cos(x). On the other hand, an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x). These are symmetric about the origin. Examples are x³ or sin(x).

So, f is odd, and g is even. The question is about the composition of these functions: starting from the innermost f, then g, then f, then g, then f again. So, let's write that out step by step.

Let me denote the function as h(x) = f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))). To determine if h(x) is even, odd, or neither, I need to check the behavior of h(-x) and see if it's equal to h(x) (which would make it even), equal to -h(x) (which would make it odd), or neither.

Since f is odd and g is even, let's analyze each composition step by step, starting from the inside.

Let's denote the innermost function as h1(x) = f(x). Then h2(x) = g(h1(x)) = g(f(x)). Then h3(x) = f(h2(x)) = f(g(f(x))). Then h4(x) = g(h3(x)) = g(f(g(f(x))). Then h5(x) = f(h4(x)) = f(g(f(g(f(x)))). So, h(x) = h5(x). I need to find h(-x) and see if it relates to h(x).

Let's compute h(-x):

h(-x) = f(g(f(g(f(-x))))).

Now, let's break it down step by step. Let's start with the innermost function first. Since f is odd, f(-x) = -f(x). So f(-x) = -f(x). Therefore, f(g(f(-x))) = f(g(-f(x))).

Now, since g is even, g(-f(x)) = g(f(x)). So, f(g(f(-x))) = f(g(f(x))).

So that's the next layer. Now, moving up, we have h3(-x) = f(g(f(-x))) = f(g(f(x))). So, h3(-x) = h3(x). So, h3 is even? Or is it just that for this specific case, it's equal to h3(x). Hmm.

Wait, but let's not jump ahead. Let's go step by step.

h1(-x) = f(-x) = -f(x) = -h1(x). So h1 is odd.

h2(-x) = g(h1(-x)) = g(-h1(x)). Since g is even, g(-h1(x)) = g(h1(x)). So h2(-x) = h2(x). So h2 is even.

h3(-x) = f(h2(-x)) = f(h2(x)). Since h2 is even, h2(-x) = h2(x), so h3(-x) = f(h2(x)) = h3(x). So h3 is odd.

h4(-x) = g(h3(-x)) = g(h3(x)). Since h3 is odd, h3(-x) = -h3(x). So g(h3(-x)) = g(-h3(x)). Since g is even, g(-h3(x)) = g(h3(x)). Therefore, h4(-x) = g(h3(x)) = h4(x). So h4 is even.

h5(-x) = f(h4(-x)) = f(h4(x)). Since h4 is even, h4(-x) = h4(x). Therefore, h5(-x) = f(h4(x)) = h5(x). So h5 is odd.

Wait, so h(x) = h5(x) is odd.

Let me recap:

Starting from h1: f(x) is odd.

h2: g(h1(x)) is even because g is even and h1 is odd.

h3: f(h2(x)) is odd because f is odd and h2 is even.

h4: g(h3(x)) is even because g is even and h3 is odd.

h5: f(h4(x)) is odd because f is odd and h4 is even.

Therefore, h5(x) = f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) is odd.

So, the composition is odd.

Wait, but let me recheck to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps.

Start with h1(x) = f(x): odd.

h2(x) = g(h1(x)): g is even, h1 is odd, so g(h1(x)) is even.

h3(x) = f(h2(x)): f is odd, h2 is even, so f(h2(x)) is odd.

h4(x) = g(h3(x)): g is even, h3 is odd, so g(h3(x)) is even.

h5(x) = f(h4(x)): f is odd, h4 is even, so f(h4(x)) is odd.

Yes, each composition alternates between odd and even. Starting with f(x) odd, then g(f(x)) even, then f(g(f(x))) odd, then g(f(g(f(x)))) even, then f(g(f(g(f(x)))) odd.

So, since h5 is odd, the entire composition is odd.

Therefore, the answer is "odd".

**Final Answer**
The composition is \boxed{odd}.
</think>

Given that \( f(x) \) is an odd function and \( g(x) \) is an even function, we need to determine if the composition \( f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \) is even, odd, or neither.

1. Start with the innermost function \( h_1(x) = f(x) \). Since \( f \) is odd, \( h_1(-x) = -h_1(x) \).
2. Next, \( h_2(x) = g(h_1(x)) \). Since \( g \) is even and \( h_1 \) is odd, \( h_2(-x) = g(h_1(-x)) = g(-h_1(x)) = g(h_1(x)) = h_2(x) \). Thus, \( h_2 \) is even.
3. Then, \( h_3(x) = f(h_2(x)) \). Since \( f \) is odd and \( h_2 \) is even, \( h_3(-x) = f(h_2(-x)) = f(h_2(x)) = h_3(x) \). Thus, \( h_3 \) is odd.
4. Next, \( h_4(x) = g(h_3(x)) \). Since \( g \) is even and \( h_3 \) is odd, \( h_4(-x) = g(h_3(-x)) = g(-h_3(x)) = g(h_3(x)) = h_4(x) \). Thus, \( h_4 \) is even.
5. Finally, \( h_5(x) = f(h_4(x)) \). Since \( f \) is odd and \( h_4 \) is even, \( h_5(-x) = f(h_4(-x)) = f(h_4(x)) = h_5(x) \). Thus, \( h_5 \) is odd.

Therefore, the composition \( f(f(g(f(g(f(x)))))) \) is odd.

\[
\boxed{odd}
\]
