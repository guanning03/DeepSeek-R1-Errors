Correct Answer:
Because $\triangle RST$ is a right triangle, $\sin R = \frac{ST}{RT}$. So $\sin R = \frac{2}{5} = \frac{ST}{5}$. Then $ST=2$.

We know that $\sin T = \frac{RS}{RT}$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $RS = \sqrt{RT^2 - ST^2} = \sqrt{25-4} = \sqrt{21}$. Then $\sin T = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}$.

Gold:
\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem about triangle RST, and I need to find sin T. The given information is that sin R is 2/5. Hmm, let me try to visualize the triangle first because the Asymptote code is provided. It shows a right triangle with points T at the origin, S at (2,0), and R at (2,sqrt(21)). So, triangle RST is a right-angled triangle at point T, right?

Wait, hold on, looking at the Asymptote code, the right angle is marked at point T, so that means the right angle is at T. So, in triangle RST, angle T is the right angle. Therefore, sides RT and ST are the legs, and RS is the hypotenuse.

But in the problem, it says sin R is 2/5. Let me recall that in a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is equal to the length of the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse. So, angle R is at point R, which is opposite side ST, and angle T is at point T, opposite side RS. But wait, angle T is the right angle, so sin T would be sin 90°, which is 1. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let me think again. If the right angle is at T, then angles R and S are the other two angles, which add up to 90°, since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. So, angle R and angle S are complementary. Therefore, sin R is given as 2/5, which would help me find the sides of the triangle, and then I can find sin T. Wait, but sin T is sin 90°, which is 1. But that can't be the case because the triangle is given with specific side lengths, so maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check. The Asymptote code shows that point T is at (0,0), S is at (2,0), and R is at (2,sqrt(21)). So, the triangle is right-angled at T, with legs of lengths 2 and sqrt(21), and hypotenuse of length sqrt((2)^2 + (sqrt(21))^2) = sqrt(4 + 21) = sqrt(25) = 5. So, the triangle RST is a right-angled triangle at T with sides RT = sqrt(21), TS = 2, and RS = 5.

Therefore, angle R is at point R, which is opposite side TS, which is 2. So, sin R is opposite over hypotenuse, which is 2/5, which matches the given information. So, sin R = 2/5.

But the question is asking for sin T. Since angle T is the right angle, sin T is sin 90°, which is 1. But I feel like that seems too easy. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem.

Wait, maybe the triangle is not right-angled at T? Let me check the Asymptote code again. The right angle mark is at point T, so it's a right angle at T. Therefore, angle T is 90°, and sin T is 1. But perhaps the problem is not specifying a right triangle? Hmm, no, the Asymptote code clearly draws a right angle at T. So, perhaps the problem is just giving a specific triangle with sides 2, sqrt(21), and 5, and angle R has sin 2/5.

Wait, so maybe sin T is not 1, but perhaps the problem is intended to be a different triangle? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read the problem again: "In triangle RST, shown, sin R = 2/5. What is sin T?"

Wait, if the triangle is right-angled at T, then sin T is 1, but the Asymptote code says T is at (0,0), S at (2,0), and R at (2,sqrt(21)). So, this is a right-angled triangle at T, so sin T is 1. Maybe the problem is just giving a specific triangle with sides 2, sqrt(21), and 5, and angle R has sin 2/5, and angle T has sin 1.

Wait, but 2, sqrt(21), 5 is a Pythagorean triplet since 2^2 + (sqrt(21))^2 = 4 + 21 = 25 = 5^2. So, yes, it's a right-angled triangle at T. Therefore, angle T is 90°, so sin T is 1.

But then why is the problem giving sin R as 2/5? Maybe I need to compute sin T based on the given triangle? Wait, but if it's a right-angled triangle, sin T is always 1.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is not right-angled at T? Let me check the Asymptote code again. The right angle mark is at point T, so it is a right angle. So, angle T is 90°, sin T is 1.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not right-angled, and the Asymptote code is just a general drawing? But no, the problem says "shown," so it must be the right-angled triangle.

Wait, maybe I need to find sin T in a different way? Let me think.

If triangle RST is right-angled at T, then the sides are RT, TS, and RS, with RS being the hypotenuse. So, angle R is opposite side TS, which is 2, and angle S is opposite side RT, which is sqrt(21). So, sin R is 2/5, sin S is sqrt(21)/5.

Therefore, angle T is 90°, so sin T is 1. So, why is the problem asking for sin T? Maybe it's a trick question, or perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, is the triangle not right-angled at T? If it's not, then sin T would be different. But according to the Asymptote code, it's right-angled at T.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the triangle is not right-angled at T, but the Asymptote code just shows a right angle at T, but perhaps it's not part of the triangle? No, the Asymptote code draws the triangle RST with a right angle at T, so triangle RST is right-angled at T.

Therefore, angle T is 90°, sin T is 1.

Wait, but the problem gives sin R as 2/5, which is a non-trivial value, so perhaps I need to compute sin T using the given information.

Wait, if angle R is given, and it's in a right-angled triangle at T, then angles R and S are complementary. So, angle R + angle S = 90°, so angle S = 90° - angle R.

Therefore, sin S = sin(90° - R) = cos R.

But sin R is 2/5, so cos R is sqrt(1 - (2/5)^2) = sqrt(1 - 4/25) = sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5.

Therefore, sin S = sqrt(21)/5.

But what is sin T? Since T is the right angle, sin T = 1.

Wait, so maybe the problem is just asking for sin T, but in that case, it's 1 regardless of the given sin R.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not right-angled at T, and the Asymptote code is just a generic right angle mark, but in reality, the triangle is not right-angled at T.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me see.

In the Asymptote code, the right angle is marked at point T, so that would indicate that the triangle is right-angled at T. Therefore, angle T is 90°, sin T is 1.

Wait, perhaps the given sin R is 2/5, and sin T is something else, but in the Asymptote code, it's 1.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is just giving a right-angled triangle at T with sides 2, sqrt(21), and 5, sin R is 2/5, so sin T is 1.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not right-angled, but in that case, the Asymptote code would not mark the right angle at T.

Wait, maybe I should just compute sin T based on the given triangle, regardless of it being right-angled.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, the triangle is right-angled at T, so angle T is 90°, sin T is 1. So, maybe the answer is 1.

But if I compute sin T based on the given triangle, it's 1, but sin R is 2/5, which is given, so maybe the triangle is not right-angled. Wait, but the Asymptote code shows it's a right-angled triangle.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not referring to the triangle in the Asymptote code, but a general triangle with angle R, sin R = 2/5, and being right-angled at T? Hmm, that is possible.

Wait, the problem says "In triangle RST, shown," so perhaps it's referring to a specific triangle, but the Asymptote code is just a diagram. So, the triangle is right-angled at T, sin R = 2/5, so sin T is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is not right-angled, and the Asymptote code is just drawing a right angle at T, but angle T is not necessarily 90°, but something else.

Wait, that's confusing because the right angle mark is at T.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is not right-angled at T, but according to the Asymptote code, it's drawn as such. So, maybe the triangle is right-angled at T, but the Asymptote code is just a generic drawing.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think step by step.

Given triangle RST, with sin R = 2/5. The Asymptote code shows a right-angled triangle at T, so angle T is 90°, sin T is 1.

But perhaps the triangle is not right-angled, but the Asymptote code is just a drawing. So, maybe the triangle is right-angled at T, so sin T is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is not right-angled, and angle T is not 90°, but the Asymptote code is just showing a specific triangle with sides 2, sqrt(21), and 5, which is right-angled at T.

Wait, in that case, sin T is still 1, because T is a right angle.

Alternatively, if the triangle is not right-angled, but the Asymptote code is just drawing a right angle at T, perhaps the triangle is right-angled at T, so sin T is 1.

Therefore, maybe the answer is 1.

But the problem is giving sin R = 2/5, which is non-trivial, so perhaps I should compute sin T based on the triangle.

Wait, in a right-angled triangle, if angle R is opposite side TS, which is 2, and hypotenuse RS is 5, then sin R is 2/5, which matches.

Then, angle S is opposite side RT, which is sqrt(21), so sin S is sqrt(21)/5.

Since angles in a triangle add up to 180°, and angle T is 90°, angles R and S add up to 90°, so sin T is sin 90°, which is 1.

Therefore, sin T is 1.

Wait, but maybe the problem is not assuming that the triangle is right-angled at T, but just a general triangle with angle R, and sin R = 2/5, and being right-angled at T? But that contradicts the Asymptote code.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is 1. So, sin T is 1.

But I need to check if angle T is 90°, which it is because the Asymptote code shows a right angle at T.

Therefore, sin T is 1.

Wait, but maybe the triangle is not right-angled at T, but the Asymptote code is drawing a right angle at T, but the triangle is not right-angled. But according to the Asymptote code, it's a right-angled triangle at T.

Therefore, I think sin T is 1.

But the problem is giving sin R as 2/5, so maybe I need to compute sin T based on the given triangle, which is 1, but sin R is 2/5.

Alternatively, maybe I need to find sin T in a different triangle, which is not the one given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is not right-angled, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawn as right-angled at T, but in reality, triangle RST is not right-angled at T, and sin R is 2/5, and angle T is something else.

Wait, but in that case, the Asymptote code would not mark the right angle at T.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If the triangle is right-angled at T, then angle T is 90°, so sin T is 1.

If the triangle is not right-angled at T, then angle T is not 90°, and we need to find sin T.

But according to the Asymptote code, it's right-angled at T, so angle T is 90°, sin T is 1.

Therefore, the answer is 1.

But why is sin R given as 2/5? Maybe the problem is just giving sin R, and sin T is 1.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not right-angled at T, but the Asymptote code is just indicating a right angle at T, so the triangle is right-angled at T, with angle R having sin 2/5, so sin T is 1.

Therefore, the answer is 1.

But I'm not sure if that's correct because the Asymptote code is specific. Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute sin T based on the given triangle, which is 1.

Wait, let's see. If triangle RST is right-angled at T, then sides are RT, TS, and RS. Given that sin R is 2/5, so opposite side is TS = 2, hypotenuse is RS = 5. Then, the remaining side RT is sqrt(5^2 - 2^2) = sqrt(25 - 4) = sqrt(21). Therefore, angle S is opposite side RT = sqrt(21), so sin S is sqrt(21)/5. Therefore, angles R and S add up to 90°, so sin T is sin 90° = 1.

Therefore, sin T is 1.

Wait, that seems too straightforward, but given the Asymptote code, it's a right-angled triangle at T, so sin T must be 1.

Therefore, I think the answer is 1.

**Final Answer**
The value of $\sin{T}$ is $\boxed{1}$.
</think>

In $\triangle{RST}$, we are given that $\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}$. The Asymptote code shows that $\triangle{RST}$ is a right-angled triangle at point $T$. Therefore, angle $T$ is a right angle, and $\sin{T}$ is $\sin{90^\circ}$ which is $1$.

To verify, we note that in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle. Given $\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}$, we can consider the sides opposite and hypotenuse relative to angle $R$. The side opposite angle $R$ is $2$, and the hypotenuse is $5$. The remaining side (opposite angle $S$) is $\sqrt{21}$, calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Since angles $R$ and $S$ are complementary, their sines are related as $\sin{S} = \cos{R} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

Thus, angle $T$ is $90^\circ$, and $\sin{T} = 1$.

The value of $\sin{T}$ is $\boxed{1}$.
