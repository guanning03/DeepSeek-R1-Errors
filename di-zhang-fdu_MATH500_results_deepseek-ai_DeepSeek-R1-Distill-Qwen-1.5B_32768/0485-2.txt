Question:
Simplify
\[\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left (\frac {4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right).\]

Correct Answer:
Let $x = \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left (\frac {4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right).$  Then by repeated application of the double angle formula,
\begin{align*}
x \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) &= \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left (\frac {4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \sin \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left (\frac {4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{4} \sin \left (\frac {8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{16} \sin \left( \frac{32 \pi}{15} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{16} \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right),
\end{align*}so $x = \boxed{\frac{1}{16}}.$

Gold:
\frac{1}{16}

Wrong Prediction:
\frac{\cos\frac{\pi}{15}}{16}

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this trigonometric expression to simplify: 

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Hmm, that's four cosine terms multiplied together. Each angle is a multiple of pi over 15, which is 12 degrees, right? So, these angles are all in the first or second quadrant since 16 pi over 15 is more than pi. But cosine is negative in the second quadrant, so the last term is negative. 

I remember that products of cosines can sometimes be simplified using product-to-sum formulas or multiple-angle identities. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe there's a clever trick or identity that applies here. 

Wait, I also recall that sometimes, when you have angles that are multiples of 2 pi over n, you can use properties of roots of unity or complex numbers. Maybe that's the way to go. 

Let me try that approach. The expression involves angles 2 pi/15, 4 pi/15, 8 pi/15, and 16 pi/15. Let's note that 16 pi/15 is equivalent to 16 pi/15 - 2 pi = 16 pi/15 - 30 pi/15 = -14 pi/15. But since cosine is even, cos(-14 pi/15) = cos(14 pi/15). So, the last term is cos(14 pi/15). 

So, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Wait, 14 pi/15 is equal to pi - pi/15, so cos(14 pi/15) = -cos(pi/15). So, that term becomes -cos(pi/15). So, the expression is:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) (-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)).
\]

Alternatively, that's equal to:

\[
- \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Hmm, so maybe I can focus on simplifying the product of four cosines first and then apply the negative sign at the end.

I remember that for multiple angles, especially with powers of two, sometimes using the identity for sine or cosine multiple angles can help. For example, the product of cosines can sometimes be expressed in terms of a sine function divided by some power, but the exact formula I need to recall is a bit fuzzy.

Wait, another idea: maybe use the identity for the product of cosines in terms of the roots of a Chebyshev polynomial or something. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, I remember that products of cosines can be expressed using the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2^k \theta}{2^n} \right ) = \frac{\sin(2^n \theta)}{2^n \sin \theta}.
\]

Is that correct? Let me test it. For example, if n=2: 

\[
\cos \left( \frac{\theta}{4} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \cos \theta = \frac{\sin(4 \theta)}{4 \sin \theta}.
\]

Yes, that seems familiar. So, perhaps I can use a similar approach here. Let me see.

Wait, in my problem, the angles are 2 pi/15, 4 pi/15, 8 pi/15, and 16 pi/15. These are 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3 times pi/15. So, 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3: 1, 2, 4, 8. So, maybe I can represent this as a product of four cosines, each with angles being double the previous one.

So, using the identity I mentioned earlier:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2^k \theta}{2^n} \right ) = \frac{\sin(2^n \theta)}{2^n \sin \theta}.
\]

But in my case, the angles are 2 pi/15, 4 pi/15, 8 pi/15, 16 pi/15. So, let me see if this identity can be applied here. Let me let n = 4, so:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{3} \cos \left( \frac{2^k \theta}{16} \right ) = \frac{\sin(16 \theta)}{16 \sin \theta}.
\]

Wait, but in my case, the angles are 2 pi/15, 4 pi/15, 8 pi/15, 16 pi/15. So, perhaps if I set theta = pi/15, then 2^k theta would be 2 pi/15, 4 pi/15, 8 pi/15, 16 pi/15. So, that's exactly the case.

So, applying the identity:

\[
\cos \left( \theta \right) \cos \left( 2 \theta \right) \cos \left( 4 \theta \right) \cos \left( 8 \theta \right ) = \frac{\sin(16 \theta)}{16 \sin \theta}.
\]

Yes, that seems correct. So, in my problem, theta is pi/15, so:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right ) = \frac{\sin(16 \cdot \frac{\pi}{15})}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right )}.
\]

Simplify 16 pi/15: 16 pi/15 is equal to pi + pi/15, and since sin(pi + x) = -sin x, so sin(16 pi/15) = -sin(pi/15). Therefore:

\[
\frac{\sin(16 \pi/15)}{16 \sin(\pi/15)} = \frac{ - \sin(\pi/15) }{16 \sin(\pi/15)} = - \frac{1}{16}.
\]

So, the product of the four cosines is -1/16. 

But wait, in my problem, the product is:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right ) = -1/16.
\]

But in my original expression, I had an extra negative sign because cos(16 pi/15) = cos(16 pi/15 - 2 pi) = cos(-14 pi/15) = cos(14 pi/15) = -cos(pi/15). So, the original expression is:

\[
- \times \left( -1/16 \right ) = 1/16.
\]

Wait, let me double-check. The original expression is:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right ).
\]

Which is equal to:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right ) \times \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right ).
\]

But as I said, cos(16 pi/15) is equal to cos(pi + pi/15) which is -cos(pi/15). So, that term is -cos(pi/15). So, the entire expression is:

\[
- \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right ) \times \left( \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right ) \right ).
\]

Which is:

\[
- \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right ) \times \left( -1/16 \right ) = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify:

1. The product of cos(pi/15) cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15) is equal to -1/16.

2. So, the original expression is:

cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15) cos(16 pi/15) = [cos(pi/15) cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15)] * cos(16 pi/15).

3. Since cos(16 pi/15) = -cos(pi/15), this becomes:

[Product] * (-cos(pi/15)) = (-1/16) * (-cos(pi/15)) = (1/16) cos(pi/15).

Wait, that seems different. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me re-examine the steps.

Using the identity:

Product_{k=0}^3 cos(2^k theta) = sin(2^4 theta) / (2^4 sin theta).

So, with theta = pi/15, 2^0 theta = pi/15, 2^1 theta = 2 pi/15, 2^2 theta = 4 pi/15, 2^3 theta = 8 pi/15.

So, the product is:

cos(pi/15) cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15) = sin(16 pi/15) / (16 sin(pi/15)).

Which is sin(16 pi/15) / (16 sin(pi/15)).

Now, 16 pi/15 is equal to pi + pi/15, so sin(16 pi/15) = sin(pi + pi/15) = -sin(pi/15). Therefore, sin(16 pi/15) = -sin(pi/15). Therefore, the product is:

(-sin(pi/15)) / (16 sin(pi/15)) = -1/16.

So, that part is correct. So, the product of cos(pi/15) cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15) is -1/16.

But in the original expression, we have:

cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15) cos(16 pi/15).

Which is equal to [cos(pi/15) cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15)] * cos(16 pi/15).

Which is (-1/16) * cos(16 pi/15).

But cos(16 pi/15) = cos(pi + pi/15) = -cos(pi/15). So, this becomes (-1/16) * (-cos(pi/15)) = (1/16) cos(pi/15).

Wait, but that seems different from before. Wait, so if the product of cos(pi/15) cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15) is -1/16, then multiplying by cos(16 pi/15) which is -cos(pi/15), we get:

(-1/16) * (-cos(pi/15)) = (1/16) cos(pi/15).

So, is the original expression equal to (1/16) cos(pi/15)? But that would mean that the product is (1/16) cos(pi/15). So, is that the final answer? Or did I make a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the identity. The identity is:

Product_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(2^k theta) = sin(2^n theta)/(2^n sin theta).

In my case, n=4, so:

Product_{k=0}^3 cos(2^k theta) = sin(16 theta)/(16 sin theta).

So, with theta = pi/15, the product is sin(16 pi/15)/(16 sin(pi/15)).

Which is sin(16 pi/15)/(16 sin(pi/15)).

As 16 pi/15 is in the third quadrant, sin is negative, so it's -sin(pi/15)/(16 sin(pi/15)) = -1/16.

So, the product is indeed -1/16.

So, then the original expression is:

[cos(pi/15) cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15)] * cos(16 pi/15) = (-1/16) * (-cos(pi/15)) = (1/16) cos(pi/15).

Wait, so that's the expression. So, is (1/16) cos(pi/15) the answer? That seems a bit odd because the original expression involves four cosines, but the product reduces to a multiple of cos(pi/15). Is that the case?

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it numerically to check. Let me compute each cosine term and multiply them together.

Compute each term:

cos(2 pi/15) ≈ cos(24 degrees) ≈ 0.9135

cos(4 pi/15) ≈ cos(48 degrees) ≈ 0.6691

cos(8 pi/15) ≈ cos(96 degrees) ≈ -0.1045

cos(16 pi/15) ≈ cos(192 degrees) ≈ -0.9781

Now, multiply them together:

0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.6103

0.6103 * (-0.1045) ≈ -0.0636

-0.0636 * (-0.9781) ≈ 0.0622

So, the product is approximately 0.0622.

Now, compute (1/16) cos(pi/15):

pi/15 ≈ 0.2094 radians ≈ 12 degrees.

cos(12 degrees) ≈ 0.9781

(1/16) * 0.9781 ≈ 0.0611

Which is approximately 0.0611, which is close to the numerical value we got earlier, 0.0622. The slight difference is due to rounding errors in the cosine values.

So, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the original expression simplifies to (1/16) cos(pi/15).

But wait, the problem is asking to simplify it, so perhaps it can be expressed in a more simplified exact form.

Alternatively, maybe it can be expressed as a fraction without pi, but I don't think so because pi/15 is an angle, so I don't think it can be expressed as a rational number.

So, perhaps the answer is (1/16) cos(pi/15). Alternatively, maybe it can be expressed in terms of other trigonometric functions or constants, but I don't see an immediate way.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product of four cosines can be expressed as a combination of sines, but in this case, we already used the identity and found it equal to -1/16, so multiplying by the last term, which is -cos(pi/15), gives us (1/16) cos(pi/15).

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is simply 1/16? But the numerical approximation suggests otherwise.

Wait, let me think again. The product of four cosines is -1/16, and then multiplied by cos(16 pi/15) which is -cos(pi/15). So, (-1/16)*(-cos(pi/15)) = (1/16) cos(pi/15). So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is (1/16). Because if the expression is equal to (1/16) cos(pi/15), but if cos(pi/15) is multiplied by 1/16, but the question is asking to simplify it, which is a single term, so maybe 1/16 is the answer. But numerically, it's about 0.062, which is about 1/16 (0.0625). So, perhaps the exact value is (1/16) cos(pi/15). But maybe there's a way to write it without the cosine term.

Wait, perhaps I missed a step in the identity. Let me verify the identity again.

The identity is:

Product_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(2^k theta) = sin(2^n theta)/(2^n sin theta).

Let me test it for n=4, theta=pi/15.

So, product is cos(theta) cos(2 theta) cos(4 theta) cos(8 theta) = sin(16 theta)/(16 sin theta).

Which is sin(16 pi/15)/(16 sin(pi/15)).

As 16 pi/15 is pi + pi/15, sin(16 pi/15) = -sin(pi/15). So, sin(16 pi/15) = -sin(pi/15).

Therefore, sin(16 pi/15)/(16 sin(pi/15)) = -sin(pi/15)/(16 sin(pi/15)) = -1/16.

So, the product is indeed -1/16.

Therefore, the original expression is equal to (1/16) cos(pi/15). So, that seems to be the simplified form.

Alternatively, can we write this in terms of sine or another function? Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps express cos(pi/15) in terms of radicals, but that seems complicated and unnecessary.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 1/16, but numerically, the product is approximately 0.0622, which is 1/16 is 0.0625, which is close but not exact. So, perhaps the exact value is (1/16) cos(pi/15), which is approximately 0.062.

But the problem says "simplify", so perhaps the answer is (1/16) cos(pi/15). Alternatively, maybe the answer is 1/16, but I think in this case, the exact answer is (1/16) cos(pi/15).

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can use the identity again for a different n.

Wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the product of cos(pi/15) cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15) is equal to 1/16. But in reality, the product is -1/16, because of the negative sign from the identity.

Wait, let me see. 

Wait, the product of four cosines is equal to -1/16 because of the identity. So, that's the exact value. So, then, the original expression is equal to (1/16) cos(pi/15). So, that's the simplified form.

Alternatively, maybe it can be expressed in another way. Let me consider the identity again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use the identity for multiple angles or other trigonometric identities.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, products of cosines can be related to roots of unity. For example, the product of (2 cos(theta)) for certain thetas can relate to Chebyshev polynomials.

Wait, in this case, perhaps I can use the identity that the product of (2 cos(theta)) for theta = pi/15, 2 pi/15, ..., 14 pi/15 is equal to 1.

Wait, that might be a useful identity. Let me recall.

Yes, the product over k=1 to n-1 of 2 cos(2 pi k /n) = 1. So, for n=15, the product from k=1 to 14 of 2 cos(2 pi k /15) = 1.

But in our case, we have cos(pi/15), cos(2 pi/15), cos(4 pi/15), cos(8 pi/15). So, those are 2 cos(pi/15), 2 cos(2 pi/15), 2 cos(4 pi/15), 2 cos(8 pi/15). So, those are 2 times the cosines of angles that are powers of 2 mod 15.

So, 2 cos(pi/15), 2 cos(2 pi/15), 2 cos(4 pi/15), 2 cos(8 pi/15) are the roots of the equation x^4 + x^3 - 4x^2 - x + 1 = 0. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe the product of 2 cos(pi/15) * 2 cos(2 pi/15) * 2 cos(4 pi/15) * 2 cos(8 pi/15) is equal to 1.

Wait, according to the identity, the product over k=1 to n-1 of 2 cos(2 pi k /n) is 1. So, for n=15, the product is 1.

But in our case, we have 2 cos(pi/15), 2 cos(2 pi/15), 2 cos(4 pi/15), 2 cos(8 pi/15). These are 2 cosines at angles pi/15, 2 pi/15, 4 pi/15, 8 pi/15.

Wait, note that 8 pi/15 is equal to 16 pi/30, which is 8 pi/15, which is equivalent to 2 pi - 8 pi/15 = 22 pi/15, but that's not helpful.

Wait, but 8 pi/15 is 2^(3) pi/15, so perhaps they are 2 cos(pi/15), 2 cos(2 pi/15), 2 cos(4 pi/15), 2 cos(8 pi/15). So, these are the first four terms of the product.

So, the product is 1, so:

[2 cos(pi/15)] * [2 cos(2 pi/15)] * [2 cos(4 pi/15)] * [2 cos(8 pi/15)] = 1.

So, 16 * [cos(pi/15) cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15)] = 1.

Therefore, [cos(pi/15) cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15)] = 1/16.

But earlier, when I considered the product, I found that it was -1/16. So, which is correct?

Wait, let me think again. The product:

[2 cos(pi/15)] * [2 cos(2 pi/15)] * [2 cos(4 pi/15)] * [2 cos(8 pi/15)] = 16 * [cos(pi/15) cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15)].

But according to the identity, this product equals 1. So, 16 * [product] = 1, so [product] = 1/16.

But earlier, using the identity, I found that the product was -1/16.

This inconsistency is confusing. So, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, in the identity, the product is sin(16 theta)/ (16 sin theta). So, for theta = pi/15, the product is sin(16 pi/15)/(16 sin(pi/15)).

But 16 pi/15 is equal to pi + pi/15, so sin(16 pi/15) = -sin(pi/15). Therefore, the product is (-sin(pi/15))/(16 sin(pi/15)) = -1/16.

But according to the other approach, using the multiple-angle identity, I find that the product is 1/16. So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the identity is for a different product.

Wait, let me check the identity again. The identity is:

Product_{k=0}^{n-1} 2 cos(2^k x) = (sin(2^n x))/(sin x).

Wait, let me verify that.

Yes, the identity is:

Product_{k=0}^{n-1} 2 cos(2^k x) = (sin(2^n x))/(sin x).

So, for n=4, x=pi/15, then:

Product_{k=0}^3 2 cos(2^k pi/15) = sin(16 pi/15)/sin(pi/15).

Which is (-sin(pi/15))/sin(pi/15) = -1.

Wait, so the product is -1.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, 2 cos(pi/15) * 2 cos(2 pi/15) * 2 cos(4 pi/15) * 2 cos(8 pi/15) = -1.

But in reality, each 2 cos(theta) is a factor, so the product is 2^4 * [cos(pi/15) cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15)].

So, 16 times the product is equal to sin(16 pi/15)/sin(pi/15) = (-sin(pi/15))/sin(pi/15) = -1.

Therefore, 16 * [product] = -1 => [product] = -1/16.

So, that's consistent with the first approach.

Earlier, I thought that 2 cos(pi/15) * 2 cos(2 pi/15) * 2 cos(4 pi/15) * 2 cos(8 pi/15) = sin(16 pi/15)/sin(pi/15) = -1, which is correct.

But then, in my initial mistake, I thought that 16 pi/15 is 16 pi/15, but 16 pi/15 is equal to pi + pi/15, so sin(16 pi/15) = -sin(pi/15), so the product is -1.

But then, in the other approach, I thought that the product is 1/16, which is wrong. So, actually, the correct product is -1/16.

So, that must mean that my initial mistake was in the second approach, thinking that 16 pi/15 is equivalent to something else.

So, now, the correct product is -1/16.

Therefore, going back to the original expression:

cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15) cos(16 pi/15) = [cos(pi/15) cos(2 pi/15) cos(4 pi/15) cos(8 pi/15)] * cos(16 pi/15).

Which is (-1/16) * (-cos(pi/15)) = (1/16) cos(pi/15).

So, that's correct.

Therefore, the simplified expression is (1/16) cos(pi/15).

Alternatively, to express it without cos(pi/15), but since the problem just says "simplify", and (1/16) cos(pi/15) is a simplified form, so that's probably the answer.

But wait, let me confirm the value numerically. Earlier, I found that the original expression is approximately 0.0622, and 1/16 is approximately 0.0625. Hmm, so close. So, that seems consistent.

Therefore, after all that, the simplified expression is (1/16) cos(pi/15). So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The simplified expression is \boxed{\dfrac{\cos \dfrac{\pi}{15}}{16}}.
</think>

To simplify the expression 

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right),
\]

we start by noting that each term can be expressed in terms of cosines of angles that are powers of 2. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( 2^k \theta \right) = \frac{\sin(2^n \theta)}{2^n \sin \theta}.
\]

Here, we set \( n = 4 \) and \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{15} \). This gives us:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin(16 \cdot \frac{\pi}{15})}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]

Simplifying \( 16 \cdot \frac{\pi}{15} \), we get \( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \), which is equal to \( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \). Since sine is negative in the third quadrant, we have:

\[
\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right).
\]

Thus, the product becomes:

\[
\frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = -\frac{1}{16}.
\]

Now, we need to account for the term \( \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) \), which is equal to \( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \). Therefore, the original expression is:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \left( -\frac{1}{16} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{16} \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right).
\]

Thus, the simplified expression is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\cos \dfrac{\pi}{15}}{16}}.
\]
