Question:
Two numbers, $x$ and $y$ are selected at random from the interval $(0,3)$.  What is the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ exists?

Correct Answer:
If a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ exists, the triangle inequality must be satisfied, which states that $x+y>1$, $1+x>y$, and $1+y>x$.  We can draw a plane with $x$ and $y$ axes and shade in the area where all of these inequalities are satisfied.

[asy]
draw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3));
draw((0,0)--(0,3));
label("$x$",(3,0),S);
label("$y$",(0,3),W);
fill((1,0)--(3,2)--(3,3)--(2,3)--(0,1)--cycle,gray(.7));
draw((1,-.1)--(1,.1));
draw((2,-.1)--(2,.1));
draw((.1,1)--(-.1,1));
draw((.1,2)--(-.1,2));

draw((1,0)--(0,1));
draw((1,0)--(3,2));
draw((0,1)--(2,3));

[/asy]

The total area of the square is $3^2=9$.  The area of the unshaded region is $2^2+1/2=9/2$.  Thus, the shaded area is $9/2$ and the probability that such a triangle exists is $(9/2)/9=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Gold:
\frac{1}{2}

Wrong Prediction:
\frac{2}{9}

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this probability problem here: Two numbers, x and y, are selected at random from the interval (0,3). I need to find the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, x, and y exists. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for three lengths to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. That means the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, for sides 1, x, and y, the following must all be true:

1. 1 + x > y
2. 1 + y > x
3. x + y > 1

So, these are the three conditions that x and y must satisfy for a triangle to exist.

Since x and y are chosen randomly from the interval (0,3), I can model this situation geometrically. I think using a coordinate system where one axis represents x and the other represents y would be helpful. So, the sample space is the set of all possible (x,y) pairs where both x and y are between 0 and 3. This forms a square with side length 3 in the coordinate plane, from (0,0) to (3,3).

Now, I need to find the region within this square where the triangle inequalities are satisfied. Let me write down the inequalities again:

1. x + 1 > y
2. y + 1 > x
3. x + y > 1

I should probably sketch these inequalities on the coordinate system to visualize the region where all three inequalities hold.

Starting with the first inequality: x + 1 > y. This can be rewritten as y < x + 1. This is a straight line with a slope of 1, passing through (0,1) and (3,4). But since our square only goes up to (3,3), the line y = x + 1 will intersect the square at (0,1) and (2,3). Beyond that, for x > 2, the line y = x + 1 would go beyond y=3, which is outside our square. So, the inequality y < x + 1 is satisfied below this line.

Second inequality: y + 1 > x, which can be rewritten as x < y + 1. Similarly, this is a line with a slope of 1, passing through (0,1) and (1,0). But since we're in the square (0,3)x(0,3), this line will intersect the square at (1,0) and (0,1). Again, for y > 0, x < y + 1 is below this line.

Third inequality: x + y > 1. This is another line, x + y = 1, which is a straight line with slope -1, passing through (1,0) and (0,1). The region above this line is where x + y > 1.

So, combining these three inequalities, the region where all three are satisfied would be the area above x + y > 1 and below both x + 1 > y and y + 1 > x.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. The square ranges from (0,0) to (3,3). The line x + y = 1 cuts through the square from (0,1) to (1,0). The lines x + 1 = y and y + 1 = x are both above this diagonal line.

So, the region where x + y > 1 is the area above this line, which is everything except the triangle below it. But we also have the regions where y < x + 1 and x < y + 1. So, effectively, the region we're interested in is the area above x + y > 1 and below both x + 1 > y and y + 1 > x.

Wait, so maybe it's a polygon bounded by these lines? Let me think.

If I consider the lines:

1. x + y = 1
2. y = x + 1
3. y = -x + 1 (which is the same as y + 1 = x, or rearranged y = -x + 1)

But in the coordinate system, y = x + 1 and y = -x + 1 both have slopes 1 and -1 respectively. These two lines intersect each other at some point.

Let me find their intersection point. Solving x + 1 = -x + 1, that gives 2x = 0, so x=0, and substituting back, y=1. So, they intersect at (0,1).

But in the square, the line x + y = 1 only goes from (0,1) to (1,0). The other line y = -x + 1 goes from (1,0) to (0,1). So, they only intersect at (0,1) and (1,0). So in the square, they form a V-shape.

So, the region above x + y >1 is everything above the line from (0,1) to (1,0). Then, we also have the regions y < x + 1 and x < y + 1.

Now, let's see where these lines intersect the square and the region above x + y >1.

First, the line y = x + 1:

- From (0,1) to (2,3). Because when x=2, y=3, but our square only goes up to y=3, so it stops at (2,3).

Similarly, the line x = y + 1:

- From (1,0) to (3,2). Because when y=2, x=3, which is the top of the square.

So, now, the region we're interested in is above x + y >1, below both y = x +1 and x = y +1.

So, let me try to visualize this. Starting from the origin, the line x + y =1 is the lower boundary. The lines y = x +1 and x = y +1 are both above this. So, the region where all three inequalities hold is the area above x + y >1 and below both y = x +1 and x = y +1.

So, the overlapping region is a quadrilateral, bounded by:

1. From (0,1) to (1,0): but wait, is that the case? Let me think.

Wait, starting from the origin, the first boundary is x + y =1. But in the square, x and y can go up to 3, so the line x + y =1 is only relevant near the origin.

But since we're dealing with x and y up to 3, and the region x + y >1 is a large area, but the other inequalities limit it.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the area where all three inequalities hold and then divide by the total area to get the probability.

The total area of the square is 3*3=9.

So, the probability would be the area satisfying all three inequalities divided by 9.

So, let's compute the area where x + y >1, x + y <1 + x, and x + y <1 + y.

Wait, is that correct? Wait, actually, the three inequalities are:

1. x + y >1
2. x + y <1 + x
3. x + y <1 + y

Which simplifies to:

1. x + y >1
2. y < x +1
3. x < y +1

So, the region is the intersection of these three.

So, this region is bounded by x + y >1, y < x +1, and x < y +1.

So, let's find the points of intersection.

First, x + y =1 intersects y = x +1 where x + (x +1) =1 → 2x +1=1 → 2x=0 → x=0, y=1. So, they intersect at (0,1).

Similarly, x + y =1 intersects x = y +1 where (y +1) + y =1 → 2y +1=1 → 2y=0 → y=0, x=1. So, they intersect at (1,0).

Now, we need to find where y = x +1 and x = y +1 intersect each other. Wait, earlier we saw they intersect at (0,1) and (1,0). But wait, they are parallel lines? No, wait, they are not parallel. They have slopes 1 and -1, so they intersect at (0,1) and (1,0).

So, in the square, the region defined by x + y >1, y <x +1, and x < y +1 is a polygon with vertices at:

- (1,0): where x = y +1 intersects the boundary x + y =1.

- (0,1): where y = x +1 intersects x + y =1.

Wait, but that's just a line segment, not a polygon. Hmm, maybe I need to find other vertices.

Wait, let me consider the boundaries.

Wait, the region is bounded by:

- Above by x + y =1? No, because x + y >1 is the region above.

Wait, no, sorry, x + y >1 is the region above the line x + y=1.

But the region also has to be below y = x +1 and x = y +1.

So, the intersection of x + y >1, y <x +1, and x < y +1.

This would form a polygon where these three lines intersect.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the intersection points of these boundaries within the square.

So, let's find:

1. Intersection of y = x +1 and x + y =1: which is (0,1).

2. Intersection of y = x +1 and x = y +1: which is (1,0).

3. Intersection of x = y +1 and x + y =1: which is (1,0).

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the region is actually bounded by other points.

Wait, let's consider the region where x and y are both greater than zero.

So, starting from the origin, but the region x + y >1 is above the line x + y =1.

But since x and y can be as low as 0, the region x + y >1 is a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1). Wait, is that right?

Wait, no. Wait, x + y >1 is the area above the line from (0,1) to (1,0). So, it's a triangle above that line.

But the other inequalities impose further restrictions.

Wait, perhaps it's a quadrilateral.

Wait, let me think again.

The region where x + y >1 is everything above the line from (0,1) to (1,0).

The region where x < y +1 is everything below the line y = x -1, which is a line with slope 1, but intercepts at (0,-1) and (1,0). But since we are in the square (0,3)x(0,3), this line only starts at (1,0) and goes upwards.

Similarly, the region where y < x +1 is everything below the line y = x +1, which goes from (0,1) to (2,3).

Wait, so combining all three:

1. Above x + y >1.

2. Below y = x +1.

3. Below x = y +1.

So, perhaps the intersection is a polygon with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to plot all these boundaries.

Wait, let me try to list the intersection points:

1. Intersection of x + y =1 and y = x +1: (0,1).

2. Intersection of x + y =1 and x = y +1: (1,0).

3. Intersection of y = x +1 and x = y +1: Let's solve y = x +1 and x = y +1.

From y = x +1, substitute into x = y +1: x = (x +1) +1 → x = x +2 → 0=2. That's impossible, so these lines don't intersect except at infinity.

So, they are parallel? Wait, no, they have the same slope, so they are parallel. So, they never meet.

Therefore, the region is bounded by:

- The line x + y >1.

- The lines y = x +1 and x = y +1, which are above the line x + y =1.

Wait, but since y = x +1 and x = y +1 are both above x + y =1, then the region is bounded by x + y >1, and the area below both y = x +1 and x = y +1.

So, the region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (0,1), and (1,1). Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to find where x = y +1 and x + y =1 intersect the boundaries of the square.

Wait, x = y +1 intersects the square at (1,0) and (0,1). Similarly, x + y =1 intersects the square at (0,1) and (1,0). So, perhaps the region is bounded by these two lines and the square's edges.

Wait, maybe it's a polygon with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1), but I need to verify.

Wait, let's think about the inequalities.

We need x + y >1, y <x +1, and x < y +1.

So, let's see:

- From y <x +1, when x is small, y can be as low as 0, but as x increases, y is bounded above.

- From x < y +1, similarly, when y is small, x can be as low as 0, but as y increases, x is bounded above.

So, the region is the intersection of all three.

I think the vertices of the region are:

1. Where x + y =1 meets x = y +1: (1,0).

2. Where x + y =1 meets y = x +1: (0,1).

3. Where y =x +1 meets x = y +1: but as we saw, they don't intersect here because they are parallel.

Wait, perhaps they don't intersect, so the region is a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1). Because (1,1) is where x =1 and y=1, which is on both lines y =x +1 (but wait, 1 =1 +1? That's not true. 1 =2? No, that's not right.

Wait, no, (1,1) doesn't lie on y =x +1, since 1 ≠1 +1. So, it's not a vertex.

Wait, maybe I need to find another point.

Wait, perhaps (1,1) is not a vertex.

Alternatively, maybe the region is unbounded, but since x and y are both between 0 and3, the region is bounded by the square.

Wait, perhaps I should find the points where the boundaries x + y =1, y =x +1, and x = y +1 intersect the square's edges.

So, starting with x + y =1:

- It intersects the square at (0,1) and (1,0).

Now, y =x +1:

- It intersects the square at (0,1) and (2,3).

Similarly, x = y +1:

- It intersects the square at (1,0) and (3,2).

So, the region above x + y =1 and below y =x +1 and below x = y +1 is bounded by:

- From (1,0) to (0,1) along the line x + y =1.

- From (0,1) to (2,3) along y =x +1.

- From (2,3) to (1,0) along x = y +1.

Wait, but that can't be right because x = y +1 goes from (1,0) to (3,2), not (2,3). Wait, no, x = y +1 is y =x -1. So, when x=2, y=1, when x=3, y=2.

Wait, so actually, y =x +1 intersects the square at (0,1) and (2,3), and x = y +1 intersects the square at (1,0) and (3,2).

So, the region above x + y =1, below y =x +1, and below x = y +1 is a polygon with vertices at:

1. (1,0): intersection of x = y +1 and x + y =1.

2. (0,1): intersection of x + y =1 and y =x +1.

Wait, but that only forms a line segment.

Wait, maybe I need to find another point where these lines intersect the boundaries of the square.

Wait, perhaps the region is bounded by:

- From (1,0) to (0,1) along x + y =1.

- From (0,1) to (2,3) along y =x +1.

- From (2,3) to (1,0) along x = y +1.

But that would form a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (2,3). But we have to check if these points satisfy all three inequalities.

Let me check (2,3):

1. x + y =5 >1: yes.

2. y <x +1: 3 <3 +1=4: yes.

3. x < y +1: 2 <3 +1=4: yes.

So, (2,3) is a point on the boundary.

Similarly, check (0,1):

1. x + y =1: not greater, so it's on the boundary.

2. y <x +1: 1 <0 +1=1: no, so equality holds.

3. x < y +1: 0 <1 +1=2: yes.

So, (0,1) is on the boundary.

Similarly, (1,0):

1. x + y =1: not greater.

2. y <x +1: 0 <1 +1=2: yes.

3. x < y +1: 1 <0 +1=1: no, equality holds.

So, (1,0) is on the boundary.

Wait, so the region is a polygon with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (2,3). Is that correct?

Wait, let me visualize this. Starting from (1,0), moving up along x + y =1 to (0,1), then moving along y =x +1 to (2,3), and then moving along x = y +1 back to (1,0). So, yes, that makes a triangle.

So, the area of this region is the area of the triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (2,3).

Let me calculate that area.

First, find the lengths of the sides or use the shoelace formula.

Shoelace formula:

Vertices in order: (1,0), (0,1), (2,3), back to (1,0).

Compute the area as 1/2 |sum(x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|

Compute each term:

(1,0) to (0,1): 1*1 - 0*0 =1

(0,1) to (2,3):0*3 -2*1= -2

(2,3) to (1,0):2*0 -1*3= -3

Sum: 1 -2 -3= -4

Take absolute value and multiply by 1/2: 1/2 * | -4 | = 2

So, the area is 2.

Wait, is that correct?

Alternatively, let's plot the points mentally.

From (1,0) to (0,1): that's a line going up and left.

From (0,1) to (2,3): that's a line going up and right.

From (2,3) back to (1,0): that's a line going down and left.

So, it's a triangle with base from (0,1) to (2,3). The base length can be calculated using distance formula: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +4)=sqrt(8)=2√2.

The height can be calculated as the distance from (1,0) to the line y =x +1.

The formula for distance from a point (x0,y0) to line ax + by +c=0 is |ax0 + by0 +c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2).

First, write y =x +1 as x - y +1=0.

So, a=1, b=-1, c=1.

Distance from (1,0):

|1*1 + (-1)*0 +1| / sqrt(1 +1)= |1 +0 +1| / sqrt(2)= 2 / sqrt(2)=sqrt(2).

So, height is sqrt(2). Then, area is 1/2 * base * height=1/2 *2√2*sqrt(2)=1/2*(2√2*sqrt(2))=1/2*(2*2)=1/2*4=2.

So, yes, shoelace formula and distance formula both give area 2.

But wait, the total area of the square is 9, so the probability would be 2/9? But that seems low.

Wait, but let me think again: the region where all three inequalities hold is a triangle with area 2, so the probability is 2/9.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought it would be a more complex region.

Wait, let me double-check the vertices of the region. Maybe I missed a vertex.

Wait, the inequalities are:

1. x + y >1

2. y <x +1

3. x < y +1

So, the region is above x + y =1, below y =x +1, and below x = y +1.

So, the overlapping area is the set of points where all three are true.

So, when x and y are both greater than 0, the region is bounded by (1,0), (0,1), and (2,3). Is that correct?

Wait, but when x and y are between 0 and 1, the region x + y >1 is satisfied, but since x and y are both less than 1, x + y would be less than 2, but depending on x and y, x + y could be greater than 1.

But in the square from 0 to3, the region x + y >1 is a large area, but the other inequalities x < y +1 and y <x +1 constrain it.

Wait, perhaps the region is a polygon with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (2,3), and (3,2). Wait, but (3,2) is another point where x = y +1 intersects the square.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the region is a hexagon or another polygon.

Wait, let me plot all the inequalities:

1. x + y >1

2. y <x +1

3. x < y +1

So, to satisfy all three, we are confined to the area where y is between x -1 and x +1.

Wait, but also y must be greater than 1 -x.

So, the region is the intersection of three inequalities.

Wait, perhaps the region is a convex polygon with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (2,3), and (3,2). Let me check if (3,2) satisfies all inequalities.

1. x + y =5 >1: yes.

2. y =2 <x +1=4: yes.

3. x=3 < y +1=3: no, 3 <3 is false. So, (3,2) doesn't satisfy the third inequality.

So, (3,2) is not part of the region.

Wait, then maybe the region is bounded by (1,0), (0,1), and (2,3), as before.

Wait, but what about (1,1)? Does (1,1) satisfy all three inequalities?

1. x + y =2 >1: yes.

2. y=1 <x +1=2: yes.

3. x=1 <y +1=2: yes.

So, (1,1) is inside the region.

But wait, in my earlier calculation, I only found the triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (2,3).

So, perhaps that's the entire region.

Wait, let me check if (1,1) is inside the region.

Yes, because x + y =2 >1, y=1 <x +1=2, and x=1 < y +1=2.

So, (1,1) is inside.

But wait, what about points between (1,0) and (2,3)? Like (1.5, 2.5). Let's check:

1. x + y=4 >1: yes.

2. y=2.5 <x +1=2.5: no, 2.5 <2.5 is false. So, it doesn't satisfy.

So, (1.5,2.5) is on the boundary between (1,0) and (2,3). Hmm.

Wait, so maybe my initial thought that the region is bounded by (1,0), (0,1), and (2,3) is correct, but it's actually a triangle.

Wait, no, because (1,1) is inside, but points between (0,1) and (1,0) are also inside the region.

Wait, perhaps the region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (2,3), and another point.

Wait, (3,2) is not valid because it doesn't satisfy x < y +1.

Wait, perhaps I need to find all the intersection points.

Wait, the boundaries are:

1. x + y =1: intersects square at (0,1) and (1,0).

2. y =x +1: intersects square at (0,1) and (2,3).

3. x = y +1: intersects square at (1,0) and (3,2).

So, the region is the area that is above x + y =1, below y =x +1, and below x = y +1.

Therefore, the overlapping region is a polygon with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (2,3). Because (2,3) is where y =x +1 intersects the square, and beyond that, x = y +1 doesn't extend further because at (3,2), x = y +1 would go beyond the square.

Wait, so is (3,2) a vertex? Let me check.

At (3,2), x = y +1: 3 =2 +1: yes.

But does (3,2) satisfy all inequalities?

1. x + y =5 >1: yes.

2. y =2 <x +1=4: yes.

3. x =3 < y +1=3: no, 3 <3 is false.

So, (3,2) doesn't satisfy the third inequality, so it's not part of the region.

Therefore, the region can't include (3,2). So, the only vertex is at (2,3).

Wait, so the region is a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (2,3). So, that area is 2, as calculated earlier.

So, the area is 2, and the total area is 9, so the probability is 2/9.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought the region might be larger.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the region where x + y >1, y <x +1, and x < y +1 is a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (2,3). So, that's 2 units.

But when x and y are both less than 3, does this region extend beyond (2,3)?

Wait, no, because at x=2, y=3 is the highest point.

Wait, but let me think about the lines.

After (2,3), if I go further, say x=3, y would have to satisfy x + y >1, but y <x +1=4, so y can be up to 4, but since the square only goes up to y=3, then at x=3, y must be less than 4, but y is also less than 3. So, the region beyond (2,3) would be a triangle from (2,3) to (3,3) to (3,2). But wait, (3,2) is not in the region because x < y +1: 3 <2 +1=3: no, it's equal.

Wait, so perhaps beyond (2,3), the region is just a line, not a polygon.

So, the region is indeed a triangle with area 2, and the probability is 2/9.

But just to be thorough, let me check another point. For example, at (1.5,1.5), which is inside the triangle.

1. x + y=3 >1: yes.

2. y=1.5 <x +1=2.5: yes.

3. x=1.5 <y +1=2.5: yes.

So, (1.5,1.5) is inside.

Another point, (2,2):

1. x + y=4 >1: yes.

2. y=2 <x +1=3: yes.

3. x=2 <y +1=3: yes.

So, (2,2) is also inside.

Wait, (2,3) is on the boundary, as y =x +1.

Wait, so that seems consistent.

Wait, but let me check (0.5,0.5):

1. x + y=1: not greater, so it's on the boundary.

2. y=0.5 <x +1=1.5: yes.

3. x=0.5 <y +1=1.5: yes.

So, (0.5,0.5) is on the boundary.

Wait, but (0.5,0.5) is inside the region.

Wait, so (0.5,0.5) is part of the region.

Wait, but (0.5,0.5) is inside the triangle, so that's fine.

Wait, I think my original calculation was correct. The area is 2, so the probability is 2/9.

But let me double-check the shoelace formula.

Vertices: (1,0), (0,1), (2,3).

Compute the area:

List the coordinates:

(1,0), (0,1), (2,3), back to (1,0).

Compute sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

1*1 + 0*3 +2*0 =1 +0 +0=1

Compute sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

0*0 +1*2 +3*1=0 +2 +3=5

Subtract: |1 -5|=4

Area=1/2 *4=2.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, using the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3):

Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) +x2(y3 - y1)+x3(y1 - y2))/2|

Plug in the points:

x1=1, y1=0

x2=0, y2=1

x3=2, y3=3

So,

Area = |1*(1 -3) +0*(3 -0) +2*(0 -1)| /2

= |1*(-2) +0 +2*(-1)| /2

= |-2 +0 -2| /2

= |-4| /2=4/2=2.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the area is 2, which is 2/9 of the total area of the square (which is 9). So, probability is 2/9.

But wait, let me think again. Is this the correct region?

Wait, because in the square (0,3)x(0,3), the region where x + y >1, y <x +1, and x < y +1 is a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (2,3), which has area 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the region was a hexagon, but now I'm convinced it's a triangle.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong because, in the square, the lines y =x +1 and x = y +1 create an 'X' shape, and the region above x + y =1 is a large area.

Wait, perhaps the region is actually the intersection of all three inequalities.

Wait, so perhaps it's a polygon with more vertices. Let me try to find all intersection points.

So, the lines:

1. x + y =1 intersects the square at (0,1) and (1,0).

2. y =x +1 intersects the square at (0,1) and (2,3).

3. x = y +1 intersects the square at (1,0) and (3,2).

Wait, so each pair of lines intersects at two points, but the overall region is formed by the overlapping areas.

Wait, perhaps the region is bounded by (1,0), (0,1), (2,3), and (3,2). Wait, but (3,2) is not a valid point because it doesn't satisfy x < y +1.

Wait, but maybe the region is a pentagon or something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to find all the intersection points between the boundaries.

Wait, the boundaries are:

- x + y =1

- y =x +1

- x = y +1

- x=3, y=3

So, let's find all intersection points of these lines within the square.

We have:

1. x + y =1 intersects (0,1) and (1,0).

2. y =x +1 intersects (0,1) and (2,3).

3. x = y +1 intersects (1,0) and (3,2).

4. x=3 intersects y=3, but that's a corner.

5. y=3 intersects x + y =1: at (x,3) where x +3=1 →x=-2: outside the square.

6. y=3 intersects x = y +1: x=4: outside.

So, the only intersection points inside the square are:

- (0,1) where x + y =1 and y =x +1 meet.

- (1,0) where x + y =1 and x = y +1 meet.

- (2,3) where y =x +1 and x = y +1 meet.

- (3,2) where x = y +1 and y=3 meet.

Wait, but (3,2) is outside the square, as x=3 is the right boundary, but y=2 is within 0 to3.

Wait, but x= y +1 intersects y=3 at x=4, which is outside the square.

So, perhaps the only valid intersection points within the square are (0,1), (1,0), and (2,3).

Wait, so the region is bounded by these three points, forming a triangle. So, that's the region we found earlier.

Therefore, the area is 2, probability is 2/9.

But wait, I just realized that the region is a triangle with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), and (2,3), but (0,1) and (1,0) are both on the boundary of the square, but the point (2,3) is inside the square.

Wait, but when I calculated the area using the shoelace formula, I used the coordinates in the order (1,0), (0,1), (2,3), which gave me an area of 2.

Wait, but if I rearrange the points, the order might change.

Wait, let me try ordering them as (0,1), (1,0), (2,3). So, computing the area with these points:

Using shoelace formula:

List of points: (0,1), (1,0), (2,3), back to (0,1).

Compute sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

0*0 +1*3 +2*1=0 +3 +2=5

Sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

1*1 +0*2 +3*0=1 +0 +0=1

Area=1/2 |5 -1|=1/2 *4=2.

Same result.

So, regardless of the order, the area is 2.

Therefore, the probability is 2/9.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the region was a hexagon, but no, it's a triangle.

Wait, so the answer is 2/9. But let me think again.

Wait, another approach: in the square, the region where x + y >1, y <x +1, and x < y +1 is the set of points where all three inequalities hold.

Alternatively, maybe it's the intersection of the three conditions, which is a convex polygon.

Wait, but given that (0,1), (1,0), and (2,3) are the only intersection points inside the square, the region is a triangle.

Alternatively, let me consider the three lines:

1. x + y =1

2. y =x +1

3. x = y +1

Each pair of lines intersect only at two points, but the only points within the square that are intersections of two or more lines are (0,1), (1,0), and (2,3).

Wait, so the region is a triangle with these three points as vertices.

Thus, the area is 2, so the probability is 2/9.

Wait, but let me just visualize the triangle:

- From (0,1) to (1,0): this is the line x + y =1.

- From (1,0) to (2,3): this is the line y =x +1.

- From (2,3) back to (0,1): this is the line x = y +1.

So, yes, this forms a triangle.

Therefore, the area is 2, so the probability is 2/9.

Wait, but I just want to ensure that this is indeed the correct region.

Wait, another test point: (1,1) is inside the triangle, and satisfies all three inequalities.

Another point: (0.5, 0.5) is inside the triangle and satisfies all inequalities.

Another point: (2,2) is inside the triangle and satisfies all inequalities.

Another point: (2.5, 2.5) is outside the triangle, because x + y =5 >1, but y =2.5 <x +1=3.5: yes, so it's inside the region.

Wait, but (2.5,2.5) is outside the triangle because it's below the line x = y +1.

Wait, x = y +1 at y=2.5 is x=3.5, which is beyond the square's x=3.

So, (2.5,2.5) is outside the triangle, but is it inside the region?

Wait, no, because x = y +1 is a boundary line, so points beyond that are outside.

Wait, but in reality, (2.5,2.5) is on x = y +1, so it's on the boundary, not inside.

Wait, but let me check (2.5,2.5) in all inequalities:

1. x + y=5 >1: yes.

2. y=2.5 <x +1=3.5: yes.

3. x=2.5 < y +1=3.5: yes.

So, (2.5,2.5) is on the boundary, so it's not in the interior.

Wait, but the region is defined by the inequalities, so it's a closed region, including the boundaries.

Wait, but then, the region is the triangle including the boundaries.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned that a triangle is formed with sides of length 1, x, and y. So, the triangle must have positive area, so the region is the interior, not the boundary.

Wait, so perhaps my initial calculation is correct, and the area is 2, but since the region is the interior, the probability is 2/9.

Wait, but I'm now confused because I thought the region might be a hexagon, but no, it's a triangle.

Wait, but I think my initial calculation is correct, so the probability is 2/9.

Wait, but let me think again. The region where x + y >1, y <x +1, and x < y +1 is a triangle with area 2, so probability is 2/9.

Wait, but let me think of the square area as 9, so 2/9 is a reasonable probability.

But, wait, another way to compute the area is to subtract the areas where the triangle inequalities fail.

But maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area using integration.

But that might be more time-consuming, but perhaps I can try.

The area where x + y >1 is the area above the line x + y =1, which is a large area.

Within that, we have y <x +1 and x < y +1.

So, the area is the intersection of these two conditions.

But perhaps integrating in the square coordinates.

Wait, integrating over x from 0 to3 and y from 0 to3, but with the constraints.

But that might be complex, but maybe manageable.

But since we already have a triangle with area 2, I think that's the correct answer.

Therefore, the probability is 2/9.

Wait, but just to confirm, let me compute the area of the region where x + y >1, y <x +1, and x < y +1.

We can compute it as the area of the square (9) minus the areas where at least one of the inequalities fails.

But that might be more work, but let me see.

The area where x + y >1 is 9 -1/2*1*1=9 -0.5=8.5.

Wait, no, that's not correct because x + y >1 is not just a simple rectangle; it's a triangular area.

Wait, the area where x + y >1 in the square is a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (3,3), but that can't be because (3,3) is on the square, but x + y=6>1.

Wait, actually, the area where x + y >1 is 9 -1/2 =8.5, but that's not correct because x + y =1 is a straight line cutting the square into two regions.

Wait, no, the area where x + y >1 is actually a square minus a triangle.

Wait, no, actually, the area where x + y >1 is the union of the square above the line x + y =1, which is a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (3,3).

Wait, but that's not correct because the line x + y =1 only intersects the square at (0,1) and (1,0), and the area above it is a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (3,3).

Wait, but (3,3) is on the square, so the area above x + y =1 is a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (3,3).

So, let me compute that area.

Use the shoelace formula for the triangle with points (1,0), (0,1), and (3,3):

List the points: (1,0), (0,1), (3,3), back to (1,0).

Compute sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

1*1 +0*3 +3*0=1 +0 +0=1

Compute sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

0*0 +1*3 +3*1=0 +3 +3=6

Area=1/2 |1 -6|=1/2*5=5/2=2.5.

So, the area where x + y >1 is 2.5.

Now, within this, we have to exclude the regions where y >=x +1 or x >= y +1.

Wait, so the area where x + y >1 and y <x +1 and x < y +1 is 2.5 minus the areas where y >=x +1 or x >= y +1.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the initial calculation.

Wait, but if the area where x + y >1 is 2.5, and the area where x + y >1 and y <x +1 is 1.5, and the area where x + y >1 and x < y +1 is 1.5, then the area where all three hold would be 1.5 (from y <x +1) plus 1.5 (from x < y +1) minus the overlapping area where both y <x +1 and x < y +1, which is 2.5 (the entire area where x + y >1).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the union of the two regions is the entire area where x + y >1, which is 2.5.

Wait, perhaps this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, the area where x + y >1 and y <x +1 and x < y +1 is the triangle with area 2, as previously calculated.

Therefore, I think the probability is 2/9.

So, after going through this lengthy process, I think the probability is 2/9.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{2}{9}}.
</think>

To determine the probability that three numbers \(x\), \(y\), and \(1\) can form the sides of a triangle, we need to check the triangle inequalities:

1. \(x + y > 1\)
2. \(x < y + 1\)
3. \(y < x + 1\)

These inequalities define a region within the square with side length 3 (from 0 to 3 for both \(x\) and \(y\)). The total area of this square is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).

The region where all three inequalities hold is a triangle with vertices at \((1,0)\), \((0,1)\), and \((2,3)\). Using the shoelace formula, we calculate the area of this triangle:

1. List the vertices: \((1,0)\), \((0,1)\), \((2,3)\), back to \((1,0)\).
2. Compute the sums for the shoelace formula:
   - Sum of \(x_i y_{i+1}\): \(1 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 0 = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1\)
   - Sum of \(y_i x_{i+1}\): \(0 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 1 = 0 + 2 + 3 = 5\)
3. Calculate the area: \(\frac{1}{2} |1 - 5| = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2\)

Thus, the area of the region is 2. The probability is the ratio of this area to the total area of the square:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area of the region}}{\text{Total area of the square}} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{2}{9}}\).
