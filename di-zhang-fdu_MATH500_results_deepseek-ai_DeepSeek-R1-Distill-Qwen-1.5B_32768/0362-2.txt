Question:
What is the total surface area, in square inches, of a cube with a volume of $1$ cubic foot?

Correct Answer:
Recall that  $$1 \mbox{ foot} = 12 \mbox{ inches}$$

Hence $$1 \mbox{ foot}^2 = 12^2 \mbox{ inches}^2 = 144 \mbox{ inches}^2$$

Finally, remember the formula $V = l \times w \times h$, that is, Volume is the product of length, width, and height.

The length, height, and width for a cube are equal, so the cube we are given has sides of length $1 \mbox{ feet}$. Now, a cube has 6 faces, so the surface area of our cube is $$6 \times (1 \mbox{ foot} \times 1 \mbox{ foot}) = 6 \mbox{ feet}^2$$

Now, convert: $$ 6 \mbox{ feet}^2 \frac{144 \mbox{ inches}^2}{1 \mbox{ foot}^2} = 864 \mbox{ inches}^2$$

So, our final answer is $\boxed{864 \mbox{ inches}^2}$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem: "What is the total surface area, in square inches, of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot?" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I know that a cube has all sides equal, so if I can find the length of one edge, I can figure out the surface area. But the volume is given in cubic feet, and the surface area needs to be in square inches. So, I think I need to convert the volume from cubic feet to cubic inches first, right?

Let me recall the conversion between feet and inches. I remember that 1 foot is 12 inches. So, 1 cubic foot is equal to (12 inches)^3. Let me calculate that: 12 times 12 is 144, and then 144 times 12 is... let me see, 144*10 is 1440 and 144*2 is 288, so adding them together gives 1440 + 288 = 1728. So, 1 cubic foot is 1728 cubic inches. That means the volume of the cube is 1728 in³.

Now, since it's a cube, all edges are equal. The volume of a cube is given by side length cubed. So, if I let s be the length of one edge, then:

s³ = 1728 in³

To find s, I need to take the cube root of both sides. Which is the same as raising both sides to the power of 1/3. So,

s = ∛1728

I remember that 12³ is 1728 because 12*12 is 144 and 144*12 is 1728. So, s = 12 inches. Got that down.

Now, the total surface area of a cube is given by 6 times the area of one face, since a cube has 6 identical square faces. The area of one face is side length squared. So, the area of one face is s².

Plugging in s = 12 inches,

Area of one face = 12² = 144 in²

Therefore, the total surface area is 6 * 144. Let me compute that:

6 * 144. Hmm, 144 * 6. Well, 100*6 is 600, 40*6 is 240, and 4*6 is 24. So, 600 + 240 is 840, plus 24 is 864. So, 144*6 is 864.

Therefore, the total surface area is 864 square inches.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the volume: 1 cubic foot equals 1728 cubic inches. That makes sense because 12 inches per foot cubed, so 12^3 = 1728. Then, the cube root of 1728 is 12 inches, which is the edge length. Then, the area of one face is 12 squared, which is 144. Multiply by 6 since there are six faces, so 144*6 is 864. 

Does 864 square inches seem reasonable? Let me think. 1 cubic foot is a sizable volume, so the surface area should be larger than, say, a small cube, but 864 seems a bit high. Let me see if I made an error in the conversion. Wait, 1 foot is 12 inches, so 12 inches is 1 foot, so 12 inches cubed is 1 cubic foot. That seems right.

Alternatively, I could have converted the surface area directly from cubic feet to square inches, but I think converting the edge length first is more straightforward. So, if the edge is 12 inches, then each face is 144 in², times six is 864 in².

Wait, hold on, 12 inches is 1 foot, so 12 inches is 12 inches. So, each face is 12 inches by 12 inches, which is 144 square inches. 6 faces would be 6*144=864. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if I tried to compute the surface area in cubic feet and then convert that to square inches, would that work? Let me see. The surface area in cubic feet would be 6*(edge length)^2. But since the edge length is 12 inches, which is 1 foot, so (1 foot)^2 is 1 square foot. So, 6*1 = 6 square feet. Then, convert square feet to square inches. Since 1 square foot is 144 square inches, 6 square feet is 6*144=864 square inches. That also gives the same result, so that method works too.

So, both methods give me 864 square inches, which is consistent. Therefore, I think that is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The total surface area is \boxed{864} square inches.
</think>

First, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to cubic inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 1 cubic foot is equal to \(12^3 = 1728\) cubic inches.

Given the volume of the cube is 1 cubic foot, which is 1728 cubic inches, we can find the side length \(s\) of the cube by taking the cube root of the volume:
\[
s = \sqrt[3]{1728} = 12 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we calculate the area of one face of the cube, which is \(s^2\):
\[
\text{Area of one face} = 12^2 = 144 \text{ square inches}
\]

Since a cube has 6 faces, the total surface area is:
\[
\text{Total surface area} = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches}
\]

Thus, the total surface area of the cube is \(\boxed{864}\) square inches.
