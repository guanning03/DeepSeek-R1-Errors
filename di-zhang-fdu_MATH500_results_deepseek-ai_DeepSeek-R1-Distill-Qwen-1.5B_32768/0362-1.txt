Question:
What is the total surface area, in square inches, of a cube with a volume of $1$ cubic foot?

Correct Answer:
Recall that  $$1 \mbox{ foot} = 12 \mbox{ inches}$$

Hence $$1 \mbox{ foot}^2 = 12^2 \mbox{ inches}^2 = 144 \mbox{ inches}^2$$

Finally, remember the formula $V = l \times w \times h$, that is, Volume is the product of length, width, and height.

The length, height, and width for a cube are equal, so the cube we are given has sides of length $1 \mbox{ feet}$. Now, a cube has 6 faces, so the surface area of our cube is $$6 \times (1 \mbox{ foot} \times 1 \mbox{ foot}) = 6 \mbox{ feet}^2$$

Now, convert: $$ 6 \mbox{ feet}^2 \frac{144 \mbox{ inches}^2}{1 \mbox{ foot}^2} = 864 \mbox{ inches}^2$$

So, our final answer is $\boxed{864 \mbox{ inches}^2}$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the total surface area of a cube, and they give me the volume in cubic feet, which is 1. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First, I remember that the volume of a cube is calculated by side length cubed. So, if the volume is 1 cubic foot, then each side must be 1 foot long, right? Because 1 foot * 1 foot * 1 foot equals 1 cubic foot. So, that means the cube is a unit cube, with each edge being 1 foot.

Now, the question is asking for the total surface area. I recall that a cube has 6 faces, each of which is a square. The area of one face is the side length squared. Since each side is 1 foot, the area of one face is 1 square foot. Therefore, the total surface area should be 6 times that, which would be 6 square feet.

Wait, hold on. The question is asking for the answer in square inches. Hmm, I converted the volume from cubic feet to feet, but they want it in inches. I need to make sure all my measurements are consistent before proceeding.

Okay, so 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, the side length of the cube is 12 inches, not 1 foot. Got it. So, let me correct that. Each side is 12 inches, so the area of one face is 12 inches multiplied by 12 inches, which is 144 square inches.

Then, since there are 6 faces, the total surface area is 6 times 144. Let me calculate that. 6 times 144... Well, 6 times 100 is 600, and 6 times 44 is 264, so 600 plus 264 is 864. So, the total surface area is 864 square inches.

Wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes it's easy to mix up units or miscalculate.

1. Volume is given as 1 cubic foot. Since the volume of a cube is side³, each side is 1 foot.
2. Convert feet to inches: 1 foot = 12 inches, so each side is 12 inches.
3. Area of one face: 12 inches * 12 inches = 144 square inches.
4. Total surface area: 6 faces * 144 square inches = 864 square inches.

Yes, that seems right. But just to be thorough, let me verify with another method.

Alternatively, since the volume is 1 cubic foot, which is 12 inches * 12 inches * 12 inches = 1728 cubic inches. But wait, the volume is given as 1 cubic foot, so that's 1728 cubic inches. But the cube's volume is side³, so side is 12 inches, as above.

Surface area is 6 * (side²) = 6 * (12²) = 6 * 144 = 864 square inches. Yep, that's consistent.

Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it in feet first and then convert to inches, let's see:

- Volume is 1 cubic foot, so each side is 1 foot.
- Surface area is 6 * (1 foot)² = 6 square feet.
- Convert square feet to square inches: 1 square foot is 144 square inches, so 6 * 144 = 864 square inches.

Same answer. So, that solidifies my confidence.

I think I got it right. So, the total surface area is 864 square inches.

**Final Answer**
The total surface area of the cube is \boxed{864} square inches.
</think>

The volume of the cube is given as 1 cubic foot. Since the volume of a cube is the side length cubed, each side of the cube is 1 foot. Converting this to inches, we have each side as 12 inches.

The area of one face of the cube is calculated as:
\[ 12 \text{ inches} \times 12 \text{ inches} = 144 \text{ square inches} \]

A cube has 6 faces, so the total surface area is:
\[ 6 \times 144 \text{ square inches} = 864 \text{ square inches} \]

Thus, the total surface area of the cube is \boxed{864} square inches.
