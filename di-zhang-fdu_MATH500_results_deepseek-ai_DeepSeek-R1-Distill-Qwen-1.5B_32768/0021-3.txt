Question:
Find all the integer roots of
\[x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0.\]Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
By the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots are all the divisors of 14 (including negative divisors), which are $-14,$ $-7,$ $-2,$ $-1,$ $1,$ $2,$ $7,$ and $14.$  Checking, we find that the only integer roots are $\boxed{-2,1}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this equation: \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, integer roots. That probably means I can use the Rational Root Theorem to figure them out. Let me recall what that theorem says. It says that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), has \(p\) as a factor of the constant term and \(q\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots would be the factors of -14 over the factors of 1, which are just ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14. 

Alright, so I need to test these possible roots in the equation to see which ones make the equation equal to zero. Let me write them down: ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14. Maybe I can plug them one by one into the equation.

Starting with x=1: Let's calculate \(1^4 + 5*1^3 + 9*1^2 -1 -14\). That's 1 + 5 + 9 -1 -14. Adding those up: 1+5=6, 6+9=15, 15-1=14, 14-14=0. Hey, that equals zero! So x=1 is a root. Nice, that's one root found.

Now, I can perform polynomial division or synthetic division to factor out (x - 1) from the original polynomial. Let me try synthetic division.

Set up synthetic division with root 1:

Coefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by 1, get 1. Add to next coefficient: 5 +1=6.

Multiply 6 by 1=6. Add to next coefficient: 9+6=15.

Multiply 15 by1=15. Add to next coefficient: -1 +15=14.

Multiply 14 by1=14. Add to last coefficient: -14 +14=0. So, no remainder. So, the polynomial can be written as (x - 1)(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14).

Alright, now I have a cubic equation: \(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14 =0\). I need to find integer roots again for this. Let's apply the Rational Root Theorem again. Possible roots are factors of 14 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.

Let me test x=-1: Plugging in -1: (-1)^3 +6*(-1)^2 +15*(-1) +14 = -1 +6 -15 +14. Calculating step by step: -1 +6=5; 5 -15=-10; -10 +14=4. Not zero.

How about x=-2: (-2)^3 +6*(-2)^2 +15*(-2) +14 = -8 + 24 -30 +14. Calculating: -8 +24=16; 16 -30=-14; -14 +14=0. Oh, that's zero. So x=-2 is a root.

So now, I can factor out (x + 2) from the cubic polynomial. Let's do synthetic division again.

Cubic equation: x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14, using root x=-2.

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by -2= -2. Add to next coefficient:6 + (-2)=4.

Multiply 4 by -2= -8. Add to next coefficient:15 + (-8)=7.

Multiply 7 by -2= -14. Add to last coefficient:14 + (-14)=0.

So, the cubic factors into (x + 2)(x^2 +4x +7). So, putting it all together, the original quartic equation factors into (x -1)(x +2)(x^2 +4x +7)=0.

Now, I need to check if the quadratic factors further. Let's see, discriminant of x^2 +4x +7 is 16 -28= -12, which is negative. So, it doesn't have real roots, let alone integer ones. Therefore, the only integer roots are x=1 and x=-2.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't miss any roots, let me double-check my calculations.

Original equation: \(x^4 +5x^3 +9x^2 -x -14\).

For x=1: 1 +5 +9 -1 -14=0, correct.

For x=-2: (-2)^4 +5*(-2)^3 +9*(-2)^2 -(-2) -14=16 +5*(-8) +9*4 +2 -14=16 -40 +36 +2 -14.

Calculating step by step: 16 -40= -24; -24 +36=12; 12 +2=14; 14 -14=0. Correct.

And for x=14, just to test, it's probably too big, but let's see: 14^4 is 38416, which is way too big, so it's not a root. Same with x=-7: (-7)^4 is 2401, way too big, so not a root. So we indeed only have x=1 and x=-2 as integer roots.

Therefore, the integer roots are 1 and -2.

**Final Answer**
The integer roots are \boxed{1}, \boxed{-2}.

\

Wait, hold on, in the problem statement, it's written as "Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas." So, I should present them as separate boxed numbers. Maybe I should write them in one box separated by commas.

Looking back, the initial prompt said: "Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas." So, probably, in a single box with commas in between. So, like \boxed{1}, \boxed{-2} but in a single line, separated by commas.

Let me check the instruction once more: "Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas." So, it's one box with multiple integer roots separated by commas.

So, the answer is 1 and -2, so in boxed form, it's \boxed{1}, \boxed{-2} but in a single box separated by commas. I need to make sure the formatting is correct.

Wait, the initial instruction was:

"Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas. Please put your final answer within \boxed{}."

So, in the final answer, I need to have all integer roots separated by commas inside a single box. So, it would be \boxed{1, -2}.

Yes, that's correct.

**Final Answer**
The integer roots are \boxed{1, -2}.

\

Wait, no, actually, in the initial problem, it's written as "Find all the integer roots of [equation]." So, I think the correct way is to have \boxed{1}, \boxed{-2}, but when the user says "Enter all... separated by commas," so maybe inside a single box.

But in the instructions, it's written: "Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas. Please put your final answer within \boxed{}." So, the final answer is to be within a single box, with the roots separated by commas. So, the answer is 1 and -2, so \boxed{1, -2}.

That's the correct format. So, I should write \boxed{1, -2}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1, -2}

To find all the integer roots of the equation \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\), we use the Rational Root Theorem, which tells us that the possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (-14) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). Therefore, the possible integer roots are ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14.

We test these possible roots:

1. For \(x = 1\):
   \[
   1^4 + 5 \cdot 1^3 + 9 \cdot 1^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0
   \]
   Thus, \(x = 1\) is a root.

2. We factor out \((x - 1)\) from the polynomial using synthetic division:
   \[
   (x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14) = 0
   \]

3. We then test the remaining cubic polynomial \(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\) for integer roots. Testing \(x = -2\):
   \[
   (-2)^3 + 6 \cdot (-2)^2 + 15 \cdot (-2) + 14 = -8 + 24 - 30 + 14 = 0
   \]
   Thus, \(x = -2\) is a root.

4. We factor out \((x + 2)\) from the cubic polynomial using synthetic division:
   \[
   (x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7) = 0
   \]

5. The quadratic \(x^2 + 4x + 7\) has a negative discriminant (\(16 - 28 = -12\)), indicating no real roots.

Therefore, the integer roots of the original equation are \(1\) and \(-2\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1, -2}
\]
