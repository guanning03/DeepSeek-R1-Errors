Question:
Find the roots of $(x - 3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.$

Correct Answer:
Let $a = x - 3$ and $b = x - 7.$  Then we can write the given equation as
\[a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3.\]Expanding, we get $a^3 + b^3 = a^3 + 3a^2 b + 3ab^2 + b^3,$ so $3a^2 b + 3ab^2 = 0,$ which factors as
\[3ab(a + b) = 0.\]Thus, $a = 0,$ $b = 0,$ or $a + b = 0.$  Then $x - 3 = 0,$ $x - 7 = 0,$ or $2x - 10 = 0.$  This gives us the roots $\boxed{3, 5, 7}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this equation to solve: \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step. 

First, I notice that all the terms are cubic expressions. So, maybe expanding them might help. But expanding them all could be tedious. There's probably a smarter way to approach this without having to deal with all the terms.

Wait, the equation is \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\). Hmm, I remember that sometimes when you have two cubes added together, it might relate to the cube of another expression. Let me think about the identity: \(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b)\). Is that right? Let me verify:

\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\), so if we subtract \(3ab(a + b)\), we get:

\((a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b) = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3 - 3a^2b - 3ab^2 = a^3 + b^3\). Yep, that seems correct.

So, applying this identity to the left side of the equation, which is \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3\), let me set \(a = x - 3\) and \(b = x - 7\). Then, the left side becomes:

\((a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b)\).

Calculating \(a + b\): \( (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10 \). Oh! That's exactly the right side of the equation. Interesting. So, substituting back into the equation:

The left side is \((2x - 10)^3 - 3ab(2x - 10)\), and the right side is \((2x - 10)^3\). So, putting it all together:

\((2x - 10)^3 - 3ab(2x - 10) = (2x - 10)^3\).

Hmm, if I subtract \((2x - 10)^3\) from both sides, I get:

\(-3ab(2x - 10) = 0\).

So, \(-3ab(2x - 10) = 0\). That simplifies to:

\(ab(2x - 10) = 0\).

Since \(-3\) is a non-zero constant, I can ignore it for the purpose of solving. So, either one of the factors is zero. That is, either \(a = 0\), \(b = 0\), or \(2x - 10 = 0\). 

Let's write down each case:

1. \(a = 0\): \((x - 3) = 0\), so \(x = 3\).
2. \(b = 0\): \((x - 7) = 0\), so \(x = 7\).
3. \(2x - 10 = 0\): \(2x = 10\), so \(x = 5\).

So, the solutions are \(x = 3\), \(x = 7\), and \(x = 5\). But wait, I should verify these solutions because sometimes when we manipulate equations, especially by factoring, we might introduce extraneous solutions.

Let me plug each value back into the original equation to check.

First, \(x = 3\):

Left side: \((3 - 3)^3 + (3 - 7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = -64\).

Right side: \((2*3 - 10)^3 = (6 - 10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64\).

So, both sides equal -64. That checks out.

Next, \(x = 7\):

Left side: \((7 - 3)^3 + (7 - 7)^3 = 4^3 + 0 = 64\).

Right side: \((2*7 - 10)^3 = (14 - 10)^3 = 4^3 = 64\).

Again, both sides equal 64. Good.

Lastly, \(x = 5\):

Left side: \((5 - 3)^3 + (5 - 7)^3 = 2^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 - 8 = 0\).

Right side: \((2*5 - 10)^3 = (10 - 10)^3 = 0^3 = 0\).

Both sides are 0, so that works too.

Hmm, so all three solutions satisfy the equation. So, it seems that \(x = 3\), \(x = 5\), and \(x = 7\) are all roots of the original equation.

But wait a second, I remember that sometimes when we factor equations, especially when dealing with cubes, there might be multiple roots or multiplicities. Maybe I should check if any of these roots are repeated or if there's more to the story.

Looking back at the equation, when we factored, we had:

\(ab(2x - 10) = 0\), where \(a = x - 3\) and \(b = x - 7\). So, each of these factors can be zero independently.

Thus, each one gives a unique solution: \(x = 3\), \(x = 7\), and \(x = 5\). So, no overlap, meaning each is a distinct root.

Therefore, the equation has three real roots: 3, 5, and 7.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me consider the original equation again: \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\).

I can also try plugging in another value, say \(x = 4\), to see if it's a root or not.

Left side: \((4 - 3)^3 + (4 - 7)^3 = 1 + (-3)^3 = 1 - 27 = -26\).

Right side: \((2*4 - 10)^3 = (8 - 10)^3 = (-2)^3 = -8\).

So, left side is -26, right side is -8. Not equal, so \(x = 4\) is not a root.

Similarly, trying \(x = 6\):

Left side: \((6 - 3)^3 + (6 - 7)^3 = 3^3 + (-1)^3 = 27 - 1 = 26\).

Right side: \((2*6 - 10)^3 = (12 - 10)^3 = 2^3 = 8\).

Not equal, so still, \(x = 6\) is not a root.

So, seems like only 3, 5, and 7 are the solutions.

Wait, another thought: the original equation is a cubic, so it should have exactly three roots (counting multiplicities) in the complex plane, but since it's a real equation, maybe some of them are real and others are complex. But in this case, we found three distinct real roots, so they must all be real.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be rewritten in terms of \(y = x - 5\), shifting the variable to see if symmetry is present.

Let me try substitution: let \(y = x - 5\), so \(x = y + 5\). Let's substitute into the equation.

Left side: \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = ( (y + 5) - 3 )^3 + ( (y + 5) - 7 )^3 = (y + 2)^3 + (y - 2)^3\).

Right side: \((2x - 10)^3 = (2(y + 5) - 10)^3 = (2y + 10 - 10)^3 = (2y)^3 = 8y^3\).

So, the equation becomes:

\((y + 2)^3 + (y - 2)^3 = 8y^3\).

Let me expand the left side:

First, expand \((y + 2)^3\):

\(y^3 + 3y^2*2 + 3y*2^2 + 2^3 = y^3 + 6y^2 + 12y + 8\).

Similarly, expand \((y - 2)^3\):

\(y^3 - 3y^2*2 + 3y*2^2 - 2^3 = y^3 - 6y^2 + 12y - 8\).

Adding them together:

\((y^3 + 6y^2 + 12y + 8) + (y^3 - 6y^2 + 12y - 8)\).

Combine like terms:

\(2y^3 + 24y\).

So, left side simplifies to \(2y^3 + 24y\).

Right side is \(8y^3\).

So, the equation becomes:

\(2y^3 + 24y = 8y^3\).

Subtract \(2y^3 + 24y\) from both sides:

\(0 = 8y^3 - 2y^3 - 24y\).

Simplify:

\(0 = 6y^3 - 24y\).

Factor out 6y:

\(0 = 6y(y^2 - 4)\).

Factor further:

\(0 = 6y(y - 2)(y + 2)\).

So, the solutions are \(y = 0\), \(y = 2\), and \(y = -2\).

Substituting back \(y = x - 5\):

1. \(y = 0\) gives \(x = 5\).
2. \(y = 2\) gives \(x = 7\).
3. \(y = -2\) gives \(x = 3\).

So, indeed, the solutions are \(x = 3\), \(x = 5\), and \(x = 7\), which are the same as before. So, this confirms that these are the only solutions.

Alternatively, if I didn't make the substitution, but let me consider another approach. Maybe using the identity I used earlier. So, I know that \((a + b)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(a + b)\). So, in the original equation, the left side is equal to the right side. So, substituting, the equation becomes:

\((2x - 10)^3 = (2x - 10)^3 + 3ab(2x - 10)\).

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply \(0 = 3ab(2x - 10)\), which is the same as before, so yeah, same steps.

So, regardless of the substitution, I end up with either \(a = 0\), \(b = 0\), or \(2x - 10 = 0\), which gives \(x = 3\), \(x = 7\), or \(x = 5\). So, seems consistent.

Therefore, after all these steps and checks, I can confidently say that the roots of the equation are \(x = 3\), \(x = 5\), and \(x = 7\).

**Final Answer**
The roots are \(\boxed{3}\), \(\boxed{5}\), and \(\boxed{7}\).
</think>

Given the equation \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\), we start by recognizing that all terms are cubic expressions. We use the identity for the sum of cubes: \(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b)\).

Setting \(a = x - 3\) and \(b = x - 7\), we find that \(a + b = 2x - 10\). Substituting these into the identity, we get:

\[
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3 - 3(x - 3)(x - 7)(2x - 10)
\]

This simplifies the original equation to:

\[
(2x - 10)^3 - 3(x - 3)(x - 7)(2x - 10) = (2x - 10)^3
\]

Subtracting \((2x - 10)^3\) from both sides, we get:

\[
-3(x - 3)(x - 7)(2x - 10) = 0
\]

This implies that either \(x - 3 = 0\), \(x - 7 = 0\), or \(2x - 10 = 0\). Solving these, we find:

1. \(x - 3 = 0\) gives \(x = 3\)
2. \(x - 7 = 0\) gives \(x = 7\)
3. \(2x - 10 = 0\) gives \(x = 5\)

We verify each solution by substituting back into the original equation and find that they all satisfy the equation. Thus, the roots of the equation are \(x = 3\), \(x = 5\), and \(x = 7\).

The roots are \(\boxed{3}\), \(\boxed{5}\), and \(\boxed{7}\).
