Question:
Find the sum of all complex solutions of the equation
\[\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\]

Correct Answer:
We can add 4 to both sides to get
\[\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + 1 + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + 1 + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + 1 + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} + 1 = 2010x.\]This simplifies to
\[\frac{x^2}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x.\]We see that $x = 0$ is a solution (which does not affect our sum).  Otherwise, we can divide both sides by $x$:
\[\frac{x}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{x}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{x}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{x}{x^2 - 4} = 2010.\]Clearing the denominators, we get
\begin{align*}
&x(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + x(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + x(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + x(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) \\
&\quad = 2010(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4).
\end{align*}This expands to
\[4x^7 + \dotsb = 2010x^8 + \dotsb,\]where only terms that have degree 7 or greater are shown.  Then
\[2010x^8 - 4x^7 + \dotsb = 0,\]so by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $\frac{4}{2010} = \boxed{\frac{2}{1005}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all complex solutions to this equation:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Hmm, okay. This looks like a rational equation, and I remember that when dealing with equations where variables are in the denominators, it's important to note that some values of x will make the denominators zero, which are called excluded values. Here, the denominators are \(x^2 - 1\), \(x^2 - 2\), \(x^2 - 3\), and \(x^2 - 4\). So, any x such that \(x^2 = 1, 2, 3, 4\) would make the denominators zero. Therefore, the domain of the equation excludes these x values: x cannot be 1, -1, √2, -√2, √3, -√3, 2, -2.

So, the first step is to figure out what these excluded values are, and then I can note that these are points where the equation isn't defined. However, since the problem is asking about the sum of all complex solutions, these excluded points won't affect the sum because they aren't roots of the equation. So, I can proceed to solve the equation as it is.

Looking at the equation, it's a sum of four fractions equal to a linear function of x. Each fraction has a numerator that's a constant and a denominator that's a quadratic in x. I wonder if this can be simplified or transformed into a polynomial equation.

Let me first write down the equation again:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Since the denominators are all quadratics, perhaps I can find a common denominator to combine the fractions. But that might be complicated because the denominators are different. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let’s set \(y = x^2\). Then, each denominator becomes \(y - 1\), \(y - 2\), \(y - 3\), and \(y - 4\). So, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{y - 1} + \frac{2}{y - 2} + \frac{3}{y - 3} + \frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Wait, but now we have a function of y, but the right-hand side is still in terms of x. That might not be helpful because y is \(x^2\), so unless there's some relationship between x and y that can help, it might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I can write each term as partial fractions or something else. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can combine the left-hand side into a single fraction.

But combining four fractions with different denominators is going to be messy. Each term has a unique denominator, so the common denominator would be the product of all four denominators: \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\). That seems quite complicated, but let's try.

So, if I let:

Left-hand side (LHS) = \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4}\).

To combine these, the common denominator is \(D = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\).

So, each term can be expressed with denominator D:

First term: \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} = \frac{(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)}{D}\).

Similarly, the second term: \(\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} = \frac{2(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)}{D}\).

Third term: \(\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} = \frac{3(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4)}{D}\).

Fourth term: \(\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = \frac{4(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)}{D}\).

Therefore, the entire LHS becomes:

\[
\frac{(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)}{D} = 2010x - 4.
\]

So, cross-multiplying both sides to eliminate the denominator, we get:

\[
(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = (2010x - 4)D.
\]

Now, this is going to lead to a very high-degree polynomial on both sides, right? The left-hand side is a polynomial of degree 6 (since each factor is quadratic, so four quadratics multiplied together give a degree 8, but wait, no, it's four quadratic terms, each of degree 2, so the product is degree 8, but each term is one quadratic over four quadratics, so when we expand the numerator, it's a degree 8 polynomial. Wait, actually, each term on the LHS is a product of three quadratics, so each term is degree 6. So, the numerator is a degree 8 polynomial.

Wait, no. Let me think again: each term in the numerator is a product of three quadratics, so each is degree 6. So, when adding them together, we still have a degree 6 polynomial. So, LHS is a degree 6 polynomial.

On the RHS, we have (2010x - 4) multiplied by D, which is the product of four quadratics, so that's a degree 8 polynomial. Therefore, bringing everything to one side, we get a degree 8 polynomial equation. So, we have a degree 8 polynomial on the left and a degree 8 polynomial on the right. Therefore, when we bring everything to the left, it becomes a degree 8 polynomial.

But 8 is a high degree, solving this directly would be difficult. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can make this equation symmetric or have some property that can help.

Let me look at the equation again:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Wait, the denominators are x^2 - 1, x^2 - 2, x^2 - 3, x^2 - 4, which are consecutive integers. So, perhaps I can make a substitution for x^2, say t = x^2, as I did earlier. Then, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{t - 1} + \frac{2}{t - 2} + \frac{3}{t - 3} + \frac{4}{t - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

But now, x is involved on the right-hand side, but t is a function of x. So, unless I can express x in terms of t, which would be x = sqrt(t), but that might complicate things because of the square roots.

Alternatively, perhaps if I consider that the left-hand side is a function of t, but the right-hand side is a function of x, which is a different variable. So, unless 2010x - 4 is somehow related to the left-hand side, but I don't see an immediate connection.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the left-hand side is symmetric in a certain way. Let me think.

Wait, the coefficients on the left-hand side are 1, 2, 3, 4, which are consecutive integers. That's an interesting pattern. Maybe that can be exploited.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each term on the LHS is of the form \(\frac{k}{t - k}\), so perhaps I can write this as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{t - k},
\]

where t = x^2. So, that's \(\sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{t - k}\).

Hmm, perhaps I can find a common pattern or relate it to partial fractions or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can write each term as a derivative or something. But that might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{t - k} = \frac{d}{dt} \sum_{k=1}^{4} \ln(t - k) = \frac{d}{dt} \ln((t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4)),
\]

but I don't know if that helps because the RHS is linear in x, not in t.

Wait, but t = x^2, so it's a function of x. So, unless I can express the derivative in terms of x, but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the left-hand side is a function of t, which is x^2, so if I denote t = x^2, then the equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{t - 1} + \frac{2}{t - 2} + \frac{3}{t - 3} + \frac{4}{t - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

But the problem is that RHS is linear in x, while LHS is a function of t. So, perhaps we can set t = x^2, so we have:

\[
f(t) = 2010x - 4,
\]

where f(t) is that sum on the LHS.

But unless f(t) is linear in x, which it's not, because f(t) is a rational function of t.

Wait, but f(t) is a function of t, which is x squared. So, we have f(t) = 2010x - 4, which is a function of x, but t is related to x.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each x, t is x^2, so maybe if I can write f(t) as a function of t, but f(t) is in terms of both t and x. It's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that f(t) is a function of t that is equal to 2010x - 4. So, if I can write f(t) in terms of x, but since t = x^2, it's a function of x.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{t - 1} + \frac{2}{t - 2} + \frac{3}{t - 3} + \frac{4}{t - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.
\]

But since t is x^2, I can substitute t = x^2:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.
\]

Wait, that's just the original equation. So, perhaps that substitution didn't help.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of t as a variable and write the equation as f(t) = 2010x - 4, where f(t) is the sum of the four fractions. So, f(t) is a rational function of t, and the equation is f(t) = linear function of x, but f(t) is in terms of t, which is a function of x.

So, perhaps we can consider that f(t) is a function of x, since t = x^2, so f(t) is f(x^2). So, f(x^2) = 2010x - 4.

So, f(x^2) is equal to a linear function of x, but f(x^2) is a rational function of x^2, which is a quadratic in x. So, f(x^2) is a rational function of x^2, but f(x^2) = 2010x -4, which is linear in x.

Therefore, the equation is a rational function of x^2 equals a linear function of x. Hmm.

So, perhaps I can write:

\[
f(x^2) = 2010x - 4,
\]

where f(t) is as above.

But since t = x^2, for each x, f(t) is a rational function of t, but f(t) is equal to a linear function of x.

Therefore, perhaps I can set f(t) - 2010x + 4 = 0.

But since t = x^2, that's f(x^2) - 2010x + 4 = 0.

But f(x^2) is a rational function in x, so the equation is a rational function in x equal to a linear function in x. So, perhaps the equation can be rewritten as a polynomial equation by multiplying both sides by the denominator.

But the denominator is the same as in the original equation, which is the product of (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4). So, if I multiply both sides by that, I get:

\[
(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = (2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4).
\]

So, this gives us a polynomial equation on the left and a polynomial equation on the right. Then, bringing everything to one side, we get a single polynomial equation of degree 8.

But expanding all of this seems really tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the equation is of the form:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{x^2 - k} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Perhaps I can consider adding fractions on the left-hand side. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe I can write each term as derivative or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can make a substitution z = x^2, so that t = z, and then write the equation as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{z - k} = 2010x - 4.
\]

But since z = x^2, we have x = sqrt(z), but that would complicate the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this equation as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{z - k} = 2010 \sqrt{z} - 4.
\]

But that introduces a square root, which is not a polynomial, so that complicates things. So, perhaps this substitution isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the equation is symmetric or has some properties that could allow me to pair terms or find a substitution.

Wait, looking at the equation again:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

I notice that the coefficients in the denominators are 1, 2, 3, 4, and the numerators are the same as these numbers. So, each term is of the form \(\frac{k}{x^2 - k}\), where k is from 1 to 4.

So, perhaps I can write this as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{x^2 - k} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Hmm, maybe I can factor this sum or find a common expression.

Alternatively, perhaps if I consider the function f(x) = LHS - RHS, then find the roots of f(x) = 0. The sum of the roots of the equation would be the sum of the solutions, which, by Vieta's formula, is equal to - coefficient of x^7 divided by the coefficient of x^8.

But, to apply Vieta's formula, I would need to know the polynomial equation, but it's degree 8, which is too high to write down here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the equation is of the form:

P(x) = Q(x),

where P(x) is the LHS and Q(x) is 2010x - 4.

If P(x) is a degree 8 polynomial and Q(x) is degree 1, then the equation P(x) - Q(x) = 0 is a degree 8 polynomial. So, the sum of its roots is equal to - (coefficient of x^7)/(coefficient of x^8).

But, again, unless I can compute the coefficients, which is tedious, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the equation is symmetric in some way, or that it can be expressed as a product of linear factors.

Wait, maybe I can consider the equation as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{x^2 - k} = 2010x - 4.
\]

Maybe I can write this as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{4} \frac{k}{x^2 - k} - 2010x + 4 = 0.
\]

So, if I set this equal to zero, then perhaps I can think of it as a function f(x) = 0, where f(x) is a rational function, and I need to find its roots.

But, again, the issue is that f(x) is a rational function, so to find the roots, I need to set f(x) = 0 and solve.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each x, t = x^2, so maybe I can write the equation as:

\[
\frac{1}{t - 1} + \frac{2}{t - 2} + \frac{3}{t - 3} + \frac{4}{t - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

But t = x^2, so x = sqrt(t) or x = -sqrt(t). So, each solution x would correspond to a solution t, and each t would correspond to two solutions for x, unless t is zero, but t can't be zero because denominators would be undefined.

Wait, but t = 0 would make denominators like x^2 - 1 = -1, which is fine, but x^2 - 2 would be -2, which is also fine, etc., as long as x isn't sqrt(1), sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(4). Wait, no, x^2 can't be 1, 2, 3, or 4, so t can't be 1, 2, 3, or 4, which corresponds to x being sqrt(t), so x can't be 1, -1, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2), sqrt(3), -sqrt(3), 2, -2.

So, maybe I can think of t as taking values in (-∞,1) U (1,2) U (2,3) U (3,4) U (4, ∞). So, for each t in these intervals, the equation in x would have two solutions: sqrt(t) and -sqrt(t). But, only if t is not one of 1, 2, 3, 4.

But, perhaps, for the equation f(t) = 2010x -4, which is a function of x, but f(t) is a function of t, which is x^2, so f(t) is equal to 2010x -4.

But f(t) is a rational function of t, so perhaps for each t, f(t) is a rational number, and 2010x -4 is a linear function in x, so perhaps we can find x such that f(t) = 2010x -4, where t = x^2.

But, I'm not sure if this approach is helpful.

Wait, another thought: since t = x^2, perhaps if I substitute z = x, then f(t) = 2010z -4, so:

\[
\frac{1}{z^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{z^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{z^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{z^2 - 4} = 2010z - 4.
\]

But that's just renaming variables; it's the same equation as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the function f(z) = LHS - RHS is a rational function, and we can consider its properties.

Wait, but f(z) is a rational function, so it's a ratio of two polynomials, numerator and denominator. So, f(z) is a rational function, and we can find its zeros by solving f(z) = 0.

But, as I thought earlier, f(z) is a degree 8 polynomial equation, so perhaps I need to find the sum of the roots without finding all the roots.

But, in order to do that, Vieta's formula tells us that the sum of the roots is equal to - coefficient of z^7 divided by coefficient of z^8.

Thus, if I can find the coefficient of z^8 and z^7 in the polynomial, then the sum of the roots is - (coeff z^7)/(coeff z^8).

So, perhaps the key is to find the coefficients of z^8 and z^7 in the expanded numerator.

Wait, let's try this approach.

First, let me denote the LHS as:

\[
\frac{1}{z^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{z^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{z^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{z^2 - 4}.
\]

Let me denote each term as:

\[
\frac{k}{z^2 - k}, \quad k = 1, 2, 3, 4.
\]

So, the entire LHS is:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{z^2 - k}.
\]

I need to find the sum of the roots of:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{z^2 - k} - (2010z - 4) = 0.
\]

Which is:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{k}{z^2 - k} - 2010z + 4 = 0.
\]

To find the sum of the roots, I need to consider the polynomial equation obtained by clearing denominators.

But to do that, I should find a common denominator for all the terms. The denominators are (z^2 - 1)(z^2 - 2)(z^2 - 3)(z^2 - 4).

So, the equation is:

\[
\frac{k}{z^2 - k} - 2010z + 4 = 0.
\]

Multiply both sides by the common denominator, (z^2 - 1)(z^2 - 2)(z^2 - 3)(z^2 - 4), which gives:

\[
k(z^2 - 2)(z^2 - 3)(z^2 - 4) - 2010z(z^2 - 1)(z^2 - 2)(z^2 - 3)(z^2 - 4) + 4(z^2 - 1)(z^2 - 2)(z^2 - 3)(z^2 - 4) = 0.
\]

So, each term is:

1. \( k(z^2 - 2)(z^2 - 3)(z^2 - 4) \)
2. \( -2010z(z^2 - 1)(z^2 - 2)(z^2 - 3)(z^2 - 4) \)
3. \( 4(z^2 - 1)(z^2 - 2)(z^2 - 3)(z^2 - 4) \)

So, when I expand all these terms, the resulting polynomial will have degree 8 (since each (z^2 - k) is degree 2, multiplied four times gives degree 8). So, the leading term will be:

From term 2: -2010z * (z^2)^4 = -2010z^9.

From term 1: k * (z^2)^3 = k z^6.

From term 3: 4 * (z^2)^4 = 4 z^8.

Wait, no, term 3 is 4(z^2 - 1)(z^2 - 2)(z^2 - 3)(z^2 - 4), which when multiplied out will have a z^8 term. Similarly, term 1 has a z^6 term, term 2 has a z^9 term.

So, when combining all terms, the highest degree is 9 (from term 2) and 8 (from term 3). So, the leading term is -2010z^9 + 4z^8.

So, the polynomial is:

\[
-2010 z^9 + 4 z^8 + \text{lower degree terms} = 0.
\]

But, perhaps I can factor out z^8:

\[
z^8 (-2010 z + 4) + \text{lower degree terms} = 0.
\]

But, in any case, the polynomial is degree 9. Wait, but earlier, I thought it was degree 8, but maybe I was wrong.

Wait, let me count the degrees:

- Term 1: k(z^2 - 2)(z^2 - 3)(z^2 - 4). So, expanding, that's a degree 6 polynomial.

- Term 2: -2010z*(z^2 - 1)(z^2 - 2)(z^2 - 3)(z^2 - 4). So, that's -2010z multiplied by a degree 8 polynomial, so that's a degree 9 polynomial.

- Term 3: 4*(z^2 - 1)(z^2 - 2)(z^2 - 3)(z^2 - 4). That's 4 multiplied by a degree 8 polynomial, so that's a degree 8 polynomial.

So, term 1 is degree 6, term 2 is degree 9, term 3 is degree 8. So, when adding them together, the highest degree term is 9 (from term 2), so the polynomial is of degree 9.

Thus, the equation is a degree 9 polynomial set to zero.

But, wait, in the problem statement, the equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.
\]

But x is the variable, so when I did the substitution, I called it z, but we eventually get a degree 9 polynomial in z.

But, in any case, the polynomial is of degree 9, so the sum of the roots is equal to - (coefficient of z^8)/(coefficient of z^9).

So, to find the sum of all roots, we need to find the coefficients of z^9 and z^8 in the expanded polynomial.

So, let's see.

First, term 2: -2010z(z^2 - 1)(z^2 - 2)(z^2 - 3)(z^2 - 4). So, the coefficient of z^9 in this term is -2010. The coefficient of z^8 is the sum over the coefficients of z^8 in each product.

Wait, to compute the coefficients, perhaps it's better to think about expanding the polynomial.

Wait, term 2 is -2010z*(z^2 -1)(z^2 -2)(z^2 -3)(z^2 -4). So, let me first compute (z^2 -1)(z^2 -2)(z^2 -3)(z^2 -4). Let me denote this as P(z^2).

So, P(t) = (t - 1)(t - 2)(t - 3)(t - 4), where t = z^2.

Then, P(t) is a degree 4 polynomial in t. Let me compute it:

First, multiply (t -1)(t - 2) = t^2 - 3t + 2.

Then, multiply (t - 3)(t - 4) = t^2 -7t + 12.

Now, multiply these two quadratics: (t^2 - 3t + 2)(t^2 -7t + 12).

Let me compute that:

= t^2(t^2 -7t + 12) -3t(t^2 -7t + 12) + 2(t^2 -7t + 12)

= t^4 -7t^3 +12t^2 -3t^3 +21t^2 -36t +2t^2 -14t +24

Combine like terms:

- t^4: 1t^4

- t^3: (-7t^3 -3t^3) = -10t^3

- t^2: (12t^2 +21t^2 +2t^2) = 35t^2

- t: (-36t -14t) = -50t

- constants: 24

So, P(t) = t^4 -10t^3 +35t^2 -50t +24.

Therefore, term 2: -2010z * P(z^2) = -2010z*(z^8 -10z^6 +35z^4 -50z^2 +24).

So, expanding this:

= -2010z^9 +20100z^7 -70350z^5 +100200z^3 -48240z.

Similarly, term 1: k(z^2 -2)(z^2 -3)(z^2 -4). Let's compute this.

First, compute (z^2 -2)(z^2 -3) = z^4 -5z^2 +6.

Then, multiply by (z^2 -4):

(z^4 -5z^2 +6)(z^2 -4) = z^6 -4z^4 -5z^4 +20z^2 +6z^2 -24.

Combine like terms:

= z^6 -9z^4 +26z^2 -24.

So, term1 is k*(z^6 -9z^4 +26z^2 -24).

Therefore, term1 is:

k z^6 -9k z^4 +26k z^2 -24k.

Similarly, term3: 4*(z^2 -1)(z^2 -2)(z^2 -3)(z^2 -4) = 4*(t^4 -10t^3 +35t^2 -50t +24) where t = z^2. Wait, but term3 is 4*(z^2 -1)(z^2 -2)(z^2 -3)(z^2 -4), which is 4*P(z^2).

So, 4*P(z^2) = 4*(z^8 -10z^6 +35z^4 -50z^2 +24) = 4z^8 -40z^6 +140z^4 -200z^2 +96.

So, summarizing all three terms:

1. Term1: k z^6 -9k z^4 +26k z^2 -24k

2. Term2: -2010z^9 +20100z^7 -70350z^5 +100200z^3 -48240z

3. Term3: 4z^8 -40z^6 +140z^4 -200z^2 +96

So, the entire polynomial is the sum of these terms.

So, let's write down each power of z:

Starting from the highest degree:

- z^9: Only in Term2: -2010z^9

- z^8: Only in Term3: +4z^8

- z^7: Only in Term2: +20100z^7

- z^6: From Term1: +k z^6; from Term3: -40z^6

- z^5: Only in Term2: -70350z^5

- z^4: From Term1: -9k z^4; from Term3: +140z^4

- z^3: From Term2: +100200z^3

- z^2: From Term1: +26k z^2; from Term3: -200z^2

- z^1: From Term2: -48240z

- z^0: From Term2: +96

So, combining like terms:

- z^9: -2010

- z^8: +4

- z^7: +20100

- z^6: (1 - 40) z^6 = -39z^6

- z^5: -70350

- z^4: (-9k + 140) z^4

- z^3: +100200

- z^2: (26k - 200) z^2

- z^1: -48240

- z^0: +96

But, wait, Term1 has four terms: k z^6 -9k z^4 +26k z^2 -24k. So, when we combine with Term3, which is -40z^6 +140z^4 -200z^2 +96, we have:

z^6: (1 -40) = -39z^6

z^4: (-9k +140) z^4

z^2: (26k -200) z^2

So, the coefficient of z^6 is -39, regardless of k because it's from Term1 and Term3.

Similarly, z^4: ( -9k +140 )

z^2: (26k -200 )

z^1: -48240

z^0: +96

But, in Term1, k is a coefficient from 1 to 4, so each term1 contributes a different k. So, for each k, Term1 will have different coefficients for z^6, z^4, z^2. So, the overall polynomial has coefficients depending on k.

But, when we write the entire polynomial, it's a sum over k=1 to 4 of the above expressions.

Wait, but in reality, Term1 is:

k(z^6 -9z^4 +26z^2 -24). So, when we sum over k=1 to 4, we have:

Sum over k=1 to 4:

- For z^6: Sum over k=1 to4 k z^6 = (1+2+3+4) z^6 = 10 z^6

- For z^4: Sum over k=1 to4 (-9k z^4) = -9*(1+2+3+4) z^4 = -90 z^4

- For z^2: Sum over k=1 to4 (26k z^2) =26*(1+2+3+4) z^2 = 26*10 z^2 = 260 z^2

- For z^1: Each term1 doesn't have a z^1 term, so z^1 is only from Term2: -48240 z. But since Term2 is independent of k, it's the same for all k.

Wait, no, actually, in Term2, there's a -2010z term for each k, but in our earlier expansion, in Term2, it was -2010z^9 +20100z^7 -70350z^5 +100200z^3 -48240z.

Wait, no, actually, in our previous analysis, the term2 is for each k, so Term2 is:

-2010z*(z^2 -1)(z^2 -2)(z^2 -3)(z^2 -4) = -2010z*(t^4 -10t^3 +35t^2 -50t +24) where t = z^2.

But in our earlier expansion, we considered term2 as a single expression, but actually, it's four terms, each for k=1,2,3,4.

Wait, no. Wait, term2 is:

-2010z*(z^2 -1)(z^2 -2)(z^2 -3)(z^2 -4) = -2010z*P(z^2), where P(t) is the quartic. So, P(z^2) is (z^2 -1)(z^2 -2)(z^2 -3)(z^2 -4) = z^8 -10z^6 +35z^4 -50z^2 +24.

So, term2 is:

-2010z*(z^8 -10z^6 +35z^4 -50z^2 +24) = -2010z^9 +20100z^7 -70350z^5 +100200z^3 -48240z.

But wait, that seems to be a single expression, which is correct because term2 is the same for all k, as it's multiplied by -2010z.

So, then, term1 is:

k(z^6 -9z^4 +26z^2 -24) for k=1,2,3,4.

So, overall, when we add all terms:

Total polynomial = term1 + term2

= Sum_{k=1}^4 [k(z^6 -9z^4 +26z^2 -24)] + (-2010z^9 +20100z^7 -70350z^5 +100200z^3 -48240z)

= (-2010z^9) + (20100z^7) + (-70350z^5) + (100200z^3) + (-48240z) + [Sum_{k=1}^4 (k z^6 -9k z^4 +26k z^2 -24k)]

So, let's compute the coefficients:

First, z^9 term: -2010.

z^8 term: 0.

z^7 term: 20100.

z^6 term: Sum_{k=1}^4 k = 1+2+3+4=10.

So, 10 z^6.

z^5 term: -70350.

z^4 term: Sum_{k=1}^4 (-9k) = -9*(10)= -90.

z^3 term: 100200.

z^2 term: Sum_{k=1}^4 26k =26*(10)=260.

z term: Sum_{k=1}^4 (-24k) = -24*(10)= -240.

constant term: -24*4= -96.

So, putting it all together:

-2010z^9 +20100z^7 -70350z^5 +100200z^3 +260z^2 -240z -96 +10z^6 -90z^4.

So, the polynomial is:

-2010z^9 +10z^6 -90z^4 +260z^2 -240z -96 +20100z^7 -70350z^5.

So, arranging in descending order:

-2010z^9 +20100z^7 -70350z^5 +10z^6 -90z^4 +260z^2 -240z -96.

Alternatively, we can factor out -1:

2010z^9 -20100z^7 +70350z^5 -10z^6 +90z^4 -260z^2 +240z +96 = 0.

But, for the purposes of finding the sum of the roots, we only need the coefficients of z^9 and z^8. From above, the coefficient of z^9 is -2010, and the coefficient of z^8 is 0.

Wait, hold on. Wait, in the polynomial, the leading term is -2010z^9, and the next term is +20100z^7, so the coefficient of z^8 is 0.

Therefore, the polynomial is:

-2010z^9 +20100z^7 -70350z^5 +10z^6 -90z^4 +260z^2 -240z -96 = 0.

So, the coefficient of z^9 is -2010, and the coefficient of z^8 is 0.

Therefore, the sum of the roots is - coefficient of z^8 / coefficient of z^9 = -0 / (-2010) = 0.

Wait, is that correct? Because in a polynomial of degree n, the sum of the roots is - (coefficient of z^{n-1}) / (coefficient of z^n).

But in this case, the polynomial is of degree 9, so n=9. The coefficient of z^9 is -2010, and the coefficient of z^8 is 0. So, the sum of the roots is -0 / (-2010) = 0.

Therefore, the sum of all complex solutions is 0.

But, wait, hold on. Let me check: the coefficient of z^8 is 0? Because in the expanded polynomial, z^8 term is 0, right? So, the coefficient of z^8 is 0. So, indeed, sum of roots is 0 / (-2010) = 0.

Wait, but is this correct? Because when I expanded the polynomial, the z^8 term was indeed 0, yes.

So, summarizing:

The polynomial equation is:

-2010z^9 +20100z^7 -70350z^5 +10z^6 -90z^4 +260z^2 -240z -96 = 0.

The coefficient of z^9 is -2010, the coefficient of z^8 is 0. Therefore, the sum of the roots is -0 / (-2010) = 0.

Therefore, the sum of all complex solutions is 0.

But, hold on, wait. Let me think again: is this correct? Because sometimes, there can be multiple roots, and sometimes, the polynomial can have multiple roots, but in this case, the coefficient of z^8 is 0, so the sum is 0.

But, wait, is the polynomial correct?

Wait, in the expansion, when I added term1 and term2, term1 has a coefficient of z^6 as 10, term3 as -40z^6, so 10 -40 = -30z^6, but in the previous step, I had written that z^6 coefficient is -39, but that was because I thought term1 was k*(z^6 -9z^4 +26z^2 -24) summed over k=1 to4, which would be (1+2+3+4) z^6 -9*(1+2+3+4) z^4 +26*(1+2+3+4) z^2 -24*(1+2+3+4).

Wait, so that is 10 z^6 -90 z^4 +260 z^2 -96.

But in the final polynomial, we have in the expression:

Sum_{k=1}^4 (k z^6 -9k z^4 +26k z^2 -24k) = (1+2+3+4) z^6 -9*(1+2+3+4) z^4 +26*(1+2+3+4) z^2 -24*(1+2+3+4).

Which is 10 z^6 -90 z^4 +260 z^2 -96.

Therefore, in the overall polynomial, the z^6 term is 10 z^6 - (term from term2's z^6), which is k z^6 summed over k=1 to4 is 10 z^6, and term2 has -40z^6, so total z^6 term is 10 -40 = -30 z^6.

But wait, in the entire polynomial, we have:

-2010z^9 +20100z^7 -70350z^5 +10z^6 -90z^4 +260z^2 -240z -96 +10z^6 -90z^4 +260z^2 -96.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, the term1 is k(z^6 -9z^4 +26z^2 -24) for k=1,2,3,4. So, term1 is 1*(z^6 -9z^4 +26z^2 -24) + 2*(z^6 -9z^4 +26z^2 -24) + 3*(z^6 -9z^4 +26z^2 -24) + 4*(z^6 -9z^4 +26z^2 -24).

So, that is (1+2+3+4) z^6 + (-9*(1+2+3+4)) z^4 + 26*(1+2+3+4) z^2 + (-24*(1+2+3+4)).

Which is 10 z^6 -90 z^4 +260 z^2 -96.

So, term1 is 10 z^6 -90 z^4 +260 z^2 -96.

Then, term2 is -2010z*(z^2 -1)(z^2 -2)(z^2 -3)(z^2 -4), which we found earlier as -2010z^9 +20100z^7 -70350z^5 +100200z^3 -48240z.

Then, term3 is 4*(z^8 -10z^6 +35z^4 -50z^2 +24) = 4z^8 -40z^6 +140z^4 -200z^2 +96.

So, adding all together:

Term1: 10 z^6 -90 z^4 +260 z^2 -96

term2: -2010 z^9 +20100 z^7 -70350 z^5 +100200 z^3 -48240 z

term3: 4 z^8 -40 z^6 +140 z^4 -200 z^2 +96

So, adding term1 and term3:

10 z^6 -40 z^6 = -30 z^6

-90 z^4 +140 z^4 =50 z^4

260 z^2 -200 z^2 =60 z^2

-96 +96=0

So, term1 + term3: -30 z^6 +50 z^4 +60 z^2

Then, adding term2:

-2010 z^9 +20100 z^7 -70350 z^5 +100200 z^3 -48240 z + (-30 z^6 +50 z^4 +60 z^2)

So, the entire polynomial is:

-2010 z^9 +20100 z^7 -70350 z^5 -30 z^6 +50 z^4 +60 z^2 -48240 z

Which can be written as:

-2010 z^9 +20100 z^7 -30 z^6 -70350 z^5 +50 z^4 +60 z^2 -48240 z =0

So, arranging in descending order:

-2010 z^9 +20100 z^7 -30 z^6 -70350 z^5 +50 z^4 +60 z^2 -48240 z =0

So, the coefficient of z^9 is -2010, and the coefficient of z^8 is 0, as we thought earlier.

Therefore, the sum of roots is -0 / (-2010) = 0.

Therefore, the sum of all complex solutions is 0.

But, just to make sure, is there a better way to see this? Because in the equation above, the coefficient of z^8 is zero. So, in the polynomial, the coefficient of z^8 is zero, so the sum of roots is zero.

But, in the original equation, the sum of roots is equal to the coefficient of z^8 divided by the coefficient of z^9, but since the coefficient of z^8 is zero, the sum of roots is zero.

Therefore, the answer is 0.

But, just to double-check, let me think about whether z=0 is a root. Let me plug z=0 into the original equation:

Left-hand side: 1/(-1) + 2/(-2) +3/(-3) +4/(-4)= -1 -1 -1 -1= -4.

Right-hand side: 2010*0 -4= -4.

So, z=0 is indeed a root.

Similarly, let's check z=1: LHS=1/(1-1) undefined, so z=1 is not a root.

Similarly, z=2: denominator in LHS terms would be zero, so z=2 is not a root.

Similarly, z=3: same issue.

So, z=0 is a root, and other roots come in symmetric pairs, so their sum would be zero.

Wait, but in the polynomial, the sum of roots is zero, which includes z=0 and the other roots. So, yes, the sum is zero.

Therefore, the sum of all complex solutions is zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
</think>

To find the sum of all complex solutions of the equation

\[
\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4,
\]

we start by noting that the equation is a rational equation. The denominators \(x^2 - 1\), \(x^2 - 2\), \(x^2 - 3\), and \(x^2 - 4\) suggest potential roots at \(x = 1, -1, \sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, -\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{4}, -\sqrt{4}\). However, these values are excluded from the domain of the original equation.

We then consider the polynomial equation obtained by multiplying both sides by the common denominator. This results in a polynomial equation of degree 9. The polynomial is:

\[
-2010 z^9 + 20100 z^7 - 30 z^6 - 70350 z^5 + 50 z^4 + 60 z^2 - 48240 z = 0,
\]

where \(z = x^2\). The coefficient of \(z^8\) in this polynomial is 0. 

The sum of the roots of a polynomial is given by the negative coefficient of the term just below the highest degree term divided by the leading coefficient. Since the coefficient of \(z^8\) is 0, the sum of the roots is:

\[
-\frac{0}{-2010} = 0.
\]

Thus, the sum of all complex solutions is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
