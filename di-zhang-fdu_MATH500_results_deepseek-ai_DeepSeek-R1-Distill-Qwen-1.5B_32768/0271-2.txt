Correct Answer:
From $\triangle PQR$, we have $\angle R = 180^\circ - \angle Q - \angle P = 105^\circ$.  Since $\overline{ST}\parallel \overline{QR}$, we have $\angle STR = 180^\circ - \angle R = \boxed{75^\circ}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the measure of angle STR. Let me try to visualize the diagram first based on the Asymptote code provided. It seems like there's a diagram with points Q, R, P, S, and T. The lines are drawn such that ST is parallel to QR, and we know angle P is 40 degrees and angle Q is 35 degrees. The goal is to find the measure of angle STR.

First, I think I should sketch a rough diagram to understand the configuration better. So, let me imagine point Q at the origin, and point R somewhere to the right of Q on the same horizontal line. Point P is above R, making triangle PQR, I believe. Then, point S is somewhere between P and T, and T is connected to R and S. The Asymptote code also mentions drawing lines from T to S and from T to P, so maybe triangle TSP is involved. Hmm, I need to figure out how all these points are connected.

Given that ST is parallel to QR, I recall that when two lines are parallel, the corresponding angles formed by a transversal are equal. That might be useful here. Also, we have angles at points P and Q given, so maybe we can use triangle properties or some angle relationships to find the desired angle.

Let me note down what's given:

1. ST is parallel to QR.
2. Angle P is 40 degrees.
3. Angle Q is 35 degrees.

We need to find angle STR. Since T is connected to S and R, angle STR is at point T, between lines ST and RT.

I think I should look at triangle QTR or triangle PRS, but maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, maybe I should examine triangle PQR because we have two angles given. Wait, in triangle PQR, if we know two angles, we can find the third one because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

Wait, hold on. Is triangle PQR a triangle? Looking at the Asymptote code, it seems like the diagram connects P to R, R to T, T to S, S to P, and Q to S. Hmm, actually, I think the figure is a bit more complex. Maybe it's a quadrilateral or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps considering triangle PQR, but I need to confirm if that's a triangle.

Wait, looking again at the Asymptote code, the points are Q, R, P, S, T. The lines drawn are T--SS--P--R--Q--SS. So, T is connected to SS, which is connected to P, which is connected to R, which is connected to Q, which is connected back to SS. Hmm, that seems like a star-shaped figure with some overlapping lines.

Wait, maybe I should consider triangles in the figure. Let's think step by step.

First, since ST is parallel to QR, by the converse of the corresponding angles theorem, if a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then the corresponding angles are equal.

Looking at point P, which is connected to S and T. Since ST is parallel to QR, and PS is a transversal, maybe the angle at P (which is angle P) corresponds to an angle at Q or R.

Wait, let's consider the transversal PR intersecting the parallel lines ST and QR. Then, the corresponding angles at P and Q should be equal. But angle P is 40 degrees, and angle Q is 35 degrees. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe it's not the corresponding angle but another type of angle.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use alternate interior angles. If PR is a transversal cutting the parallel lines ST and QR, then the alternate interior angles should be equal. But again, angle at P is 40 degrees, and angle at Q is 35 degrees. They are not equal, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the angles are on different sides. Let me think. If I have two parallel lines, ST and QR, and a transversal PR, then the alternate exterior angles would be equal. But here, angle P is on one side, and angle Q is on the other side. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Maybe I need to look at triangles PQR and STR, since ST is parallel to QR, which might imply some similar triangles. If triangles PQR and STR are similar, then their corresponding angles would be equal. But I need to verify if that's the case.

Wait, let me check. If ST is parallel to QR, and both are cut by transversal PT, then angle at T (angle STR) and angle at R (angle Q) might be corresponding angles. If that's the case, then angle STR would be equal to angle Q, which is 35 degrees. But that seems too straightforward, and I feel like the problem is more complex than that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not about similar triangles but about using the properties of parallel lines and transversals to find the measure of angle STR.

Wait, maybe I can find the measure of angle at T in triangle STR. But I don't know the sides or any other angles in that triangle. Alternatively, maybe I can find some relationships in triangle PQR.

In triangle PQR, we know angle P is 40 degrees, angle Q is 35 degrees, so angle R can be found since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

So, angle R = 180 - 40 - 35 = 105 degrees.

Okay, so angle at R in triangle PQR is 105 degrees. Now, since ST is parallel to QR, maybe there's a relationship between angle R and angle STR.

Wait, if ST is parallel to QR, then the angle formed by transversal SR with these lines should have some relationship. So, angle at R in triangle PQR is 105 degrees, and angle STR is the angle at T between ST and RT.

Wait, maybe angle STR is equal to angle R because of the parallel lines?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think step by step.

1. Triangle PQR: angles at P = 40°, Q = 35°, so angle R = 105°.

2. ST is parallel to QR. So, transversal PR intersects both ST and QR.

3. Therefore, angle between PR and ST at point R is equal to angle between PR and QR at point Q, because of alternate interior angles.

Wait, angle at Q is 35°, so angle at R (which is angle between PR and ST) is also 35°. Therefore, angle STR is 35°.

But wait, is that correct? Because angle STR is at point T, not at point R. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's not directly angle R that's equal. Let me clarify.

If ST is parallel to QR, and PR is a transversal, then angle at R (between PR and ST) and angle at Q (between PR and QR) should be equal because they are alternate interior angles. So, angle at R is equal to angle at Q, which is 35°.

But angle STR is at point T, so it's not directly angle R or Q. Hmm. Maybe I need to look at triangle STR.

Wait, in triangle STR, if I can find angle at S or T, I can find angle STR.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find some other angles.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. If I can find two angles in triangle STR, I can find the third.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of corresponding angles or alternate interior angles.

Wait, angle at T, which is angle STR, is formed by the intersection of ST and RT. Since ST is parallel to QR, and RT is a transversal, maybe the corresponding angle at Q is related.

Alternatively, let me consider the lines.

Wait, maybe I should use the concept of the exterior angle theorem or something like that.

Wait, perhaps if I can find the measure of angle at T in triangle STR, but I don't know any sides.

Alternatively, maybe I can find some relationship using the fact that ST is parallel to QR.

Wait, let me think about the angles around point T.

At point T, we have lines TS, TP, and TR. Since ST is parallel to QR, and TP is a transversal, maybe angle at T can be related to angle at R.

Wait, in triangle PQR, angle R is 105°, which is at point R, between sides QR and PR. Since ST is parallel to QR, and PR is the transversal, the angle at R (angle between PR and QR) is 35°, which we already established is equal to angle at R between PR and ST.

So, angle at R in triangle PQR is 105°, and the angle between PR and ST is also 105°, but that doesn't seem right because we already have angle Q as 35°, which is an interior angle.

Wait, maybe I need to look at triangle STR.

In triangle STR, we have point S connected to T, T connected to R, and R connected back to S. So, triangle STR is formed.

If I can find two angles in this triangle, I can find the third. So, maybe angle at S or angle at T.

Wait, angle at S is between ST and SR. Hmm, but I don't know much about triangle STR.

Wait, perhaps I can find angle at S by considering the lines ST and QR, which are parallel, and the transversal SR.

Wait, angle at S: if ST is parallel to QR, then angle at S (between SR and ST) and angle at Q (between SQ and QR) would be corresponding angles. But angle at Q is 35°, so angle at S is also 35°.

Wait, but angle at S is part of triangle STR, so maybe that can help.

So, in triangle STR, angle at S is 35°, angle at R is... Wait, in triangle PQR, angle at R is 105°, but is that the same as angle at R in triangle STR?

Wait, no, because triangle STR is a smaller triangle inside PQR. So, I need to be careful.

Wait, in triangle PQR, angle at R is 105°, which is the angle between sides QR and PR. In triangle STR, angle at R is between sides SR and TR. So, they are not the same angle.

Hmm, so perhaps I need a different approach.

Wait, maybe the key is to look at triangle PQR and use the properties of parallel lines to find the measure of angle STR.

Since ST is parallel to QR, and PR is a transversal, the angle between PR and ST at point R is equal to the angle between PR and QR at point Q, which is 35°. So, angle at R (between PR and ST) is 35°.

Therefore, in triangle PQR, angle at R is 105°, which is the angle between QR and PR. So, the angle between ST and PR is 35°, and the angle between QR and PR is 105°, so the angle between ST and QR is 105° - 35° = 70°. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, if angle between PR and ST is 35°, and angle between PR and QR is 105°, then the angle between ST and QR would be 105° - 35° = 70°, but that's the angle between ST and QR.

Wait, no, that might not be correct because the angles are on different sides.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the angles at point R. If angle between PR and ST is 35°, and angle between PR and QR is 105°, then angle between ST and QR is 105° - 35° = 70°, but that's the angle on one side.

Wait, maybe it's 70°, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of transversal angles.

Wait, so if angle P is 40°, and angle Q is 35°, and ST is parallel to QR, maybe the lines create similar triangles.

Wait, let me consider triangles PQR and TSP.

If ST is parallel to QR, then triangle PQR and triangle TSP might be similar. Let me check.

In triangle PQR, angle at P is 40°, angle at Q is 35°, so angle at R is 105°, as calculated before.

In triangle TSP, angle at P is the same as angle at T in triangle PQR? Wait, no, because T is a different point.

Alternatively, maybe triangle TSP is similar to triangle PQR.

Wait, let's see:

If ST is parallel to QR, then the corresponding angles would be equal. So, angle at T (angle PTS) would be equal to angle at Q (35°), and angle at S would be equal to angle at R (105°). So, if triangle PQR is similar to triangle TSP, then the sides would be in proportion.

But wait, in triangle PQR, angle at P is 40°, and in triangle TSP, angle at T is angle PTS, which is equal to angle at Q, which is 35°. So, the triangles are similar with angles 35°, 105°, and 40°, but the other angles would be corresponding.

Wait, that doesn't seem to add up because triangle PQR has angles 40°, 35°, and 105°, and triangle TSP would have angles 35°, 105°, and 40°, which is the same as triangle PQR. So, triangles PQR and TSP are similar by AAA similarity.

Therefore, triangle PQR ~ triangle TSP.

So, if that's the case, their sides are proportional. But I don't know if that helps me find angle STR.

Wait, angle STR is part of triangle STR, which is not necessarily similar to any other triangle.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that triangle STR is similar to another triangle.

Wait, perhaps triangle STR is similar to triangle PQR, but I need to verify.

Wait, angle at S in triangle STR is the same as angle at R in triangle PQR, which is 105°, but I don't think that's correct because angle at S in triangle STR is between ST and SR, whereas angle at R in triangle PQR is between QR and PR.

Hmm, maybe this is not the right approach.

Wait, let me think differently. Since ST is parallel to QR, and P is a common vertex, maybe we can consider the line PT as a transversal cutting both ST and QR, creating equal corresponding angles.

Wait, angle at P is 40°, so the angle at Q would be equal to that, but angle Q is 35°, so that doesn't add up. Hmm.

Wait, no, angle P is 40°, so the corresponding angle on the other side would be equal. So, the angle at Q would be equal to angle at S, maybe?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Maybe I should apply the concept of alternate interior angles.

Since ST is parallel to QR, and PR is a transversal, the alternate interior angles would be equal. So, angle at P (40°) and angle at R would be equal? But angle R is 105°, so that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, the alternate interior angles are on opposite sides of the transversal. So, angle at P (40°) and angle at R (105°) are not alternate interior angles because they are on the same side.

Wait, maybe the corresponding angles. If PR is the transversal, then the corresponding angle to angle at P (40°) would be the angle at point T. So, angle at T in triangle STR is equal to angle at P, which is 40°. But that seems too straightforward.

Wait, but if angle at T is 40°, then angle STR is 40°, but I don't know if that's correct because angle STR is at point T, and angle P is at point P.

Wait, maybe I should consider that angle STR is equal to angle P because they are corresponding angles. So, angle STR = angle P = 40°. But that seems too direct, and the problem gives angle Q as 35°, so 40° seems a bit arbitrary.

Wait, let me double-check. If ST is parallel to QR, and PT is a transversal, then the corresponding angles would be equal. So, angle at T (angle STR) and angle at Q (angle Q) would be corresponding angles.

Wait, is angle at T and angle at Q corresponding? Because ST is parallel to QR, and PQ is a transversal. So, the angle at T would correspond to the angle at Q.

Wait, so angle at T is equal to angle at Q, which is 35°. So, angle STR is 35°.

Hmm, that seems more reasonable. Because angle at T and angle at Q are corresponding angles when considering transversal PT cutting the parallel lines ST and QR.

Yes, because ST is parallel to QR, and PT is a transversal, so angle at T (angle STR) is equal to angle at Q (angle Q). So, angle STR is 35°.

Wait, but hold on, angle at Q is 35°, so if angle at T is equal to that, then angle STR is 35°. But earlier, I thought angle STR was 35°, but I was confused because I thought it might be 40°, but now I think it's 35°.

Let me confirm this. If ST is parallel to QR, and PT is a transversal, then angle STR is equal to angle P, but angle P is 40°, so that would make angle STR 40°. Wait, now I'm really confused.

Wait, no, the corresponding angles are angle at T and angle at Q. So, angle STR is equal to angle Q, which is 35°. So, I think the measure of angle STR is 35°.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the lines again.

ST is parallel to QR, and PT is a transversal. So, angle at T (angle STR) and angle at Q (angle Q) are corresponding angles because they are on the same side of the transversal PT.

Therefore, angle STR = angle Q = 35°.

Thus, the measure of angle STR is 35 degrees.

But wait, earlier I thought it might be 40°, but upon re-examining, it's 35°, so I think that's correct.

Wait, but let me also check using another method to make sure.

Alternatively, since triangle PQR has angles 40°, 35°, and 105°, and ST is parallel to QR, then lines PT and PR are transversals.

In triangle PQR, angle at R is 105°, so in triangle STR, angle at R is part of the triangle, but how does that relate?

Wait, if we consider triangle STR, the sum of its angles is 180°, so if we can find another angle, we can find the third.

If angle at T is 35°, then the angles at S and R would be 180 - 35 = 145°. But I don't know if that's correct.

Wait, no, that approach might not be correct because I don't know the sides or other angles.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles again. If triangle PQR is similar to triangle TSP, then triangle TSP would have angles equal to triangle PQR.

But triangle PQR has angles 40°, 35°, 105°, and triangle TSP would also have angles 40°, 35°, 105°, but I need to confirm that.

Wait, if triangle TSP is similar to triangle PQR, then sides would be proportional. But since we don't have any side lengths given, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps angle STR is 35°, and the other angles can be found accordingly.

Wait, maybe if I consider triangle STR, and angle STR is 35°, then I can find angles at S and R.

But without more information, I can't directly compute that.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to calculate the measure of angle at T in triangle STR.

Wait, point S is connected to T and R, so triangle STR is formed. Since ST is parallel to QR, and considering the lines, maybe angle STR is equal to angle P, which is 40°, but that seems conflicting.

Wait, let me think about the concept of alternate interior angles again. When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, alternate interior angles are equal. So, in this case, ST is parallel to QR, and PT is the transversal.

Therefore, the alternate interior angles would be angle at T (angle STR) and angle at Q (angle Q). So, angle STR = angle Q = 35°.

Therefore, angle STR is 35 degrees.

Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 40°, but that was incorrect because I was confusing the angles. So, the correct measure is 35°.

Therefore, I think the measure of angle STR is 35 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The measure of angle STR is \boxed{35} degrees.
</think>

Given that \(\overline{ST} \parallel \overline{QR}\), \(\angle P = 40^\circ\), and \(\angle Q = 35^\circ\), we need to find the measure of \(\angle STR\).

1. **Identify the angles in triangle \(PQR\)**:
   - Since \(\overline{ST} \parallel \overline{QR}\) and \(PR\) is a transversal, the corresponding angles formed are equal.
   - The angle at \(Q\) (which is \(35^\circ\)) corresponds to the angle at \(T\) (which is \(\angle STR\)) due to the parallel lines and the transversal \(PR\).

2. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, \(\angle STR\) is equal to \(\angle Q\), which is \(35^\circ\).

Thus, the measure of \(\angle STR\) is \(\boxed{35}\) degrees.
