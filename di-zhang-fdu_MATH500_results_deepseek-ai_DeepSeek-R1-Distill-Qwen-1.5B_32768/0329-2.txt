Question:
Find the number of integer values of $k$ in the closed interval $[-500,500]$ for which the equation $\log(kx)=2\log(x+2)$ has exactly one real solution.

Correct Answer:
First, note that if $k < 0,$ then $\log(kx)$ is defined for $x \in (-\infty, 0),$ and is strictly decreasing on that interval. Since $2\log(x+2)$ is defined for $x \in (-2, \infty)$ and is strictly increasing on that interval, it follows that $\log(kx) = 2\log(x+2)$ has exactly one real solution, which must lie in the interval $(-2, 0).$ Therefore, all the values $k = -500, -499, \ldots, -2, -1$ satisfy the condition.

If $k = 0,$ then the left-hand side is never defined, so we may assume now that $k > 0.$ In this case, converting to exponential form, we have \[ kx = (x+2)^2\]or \[x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = 0.\]Any solution of this equation satisfies $\log(kx) = 2\log(x+2)$ as well, as long as the two logarithms are defined; since $k > 0,$ the logarithms are defined exactly when $x > 0.$ Therefore, this quadratic must have exactly one positive root.

But by Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of this quadratic is $4,$ which is positive, so the only way for it to have exactly one positive root is if it has $\sqrt{4} = 2$ as a double root. That is, \[x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = (x-2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4\]for all $x,$ so $4-k=-4,$ and $k=8,$ which is the only positive value of $k$ satisfying the condition.

In total, there are $500 + 1 = \boxed{501}$ values of $k$ satisfying the condition.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of integer values of \( k \) in the closed interval \([-500, 500]\) for which the equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2)\) has exactly one real solution. Hmm, okay. Let me try to wrap my head around this step by step.

First, I remember that logarithmic equations can sometimes be tricky, but they often depend on the properties of logarithms. So, maybe I should start by simplifying the equation. The equation given is \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2)\). Hmm, I know that \(2\log(x + 2)\) is the same as \(\log((x + 2)^2)\), right? Because \(a\log(b) = \log(b^a)\). So, substituting that in, the equation becomes:

\[
\log(kx) = \log((x + 2)^2)
\]

Okay, so if two logs are equal, their arguments must be equal, as long as the arguments are positive. So, I can set the arguments equal to each other:

\[
kx = (x + 2)^2
\]

Alright, so that simplifies things a bit. Now, expanding the right-hand side:

\[
kx = x^2 + 4x + 4
\]

Now, let me bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 + 4x + 4 - kx = 0
\]

Simplify the terms:

\[
x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0
\]

So, that's a quadratic in terms of \(x\). Let me write that as:

\[
x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0
\]

Now, since this is a quadratic equation, the number of real solutions depends on the discriminant. The discriminant \(D\) of a quadratic \(ax^2 + bx + c\) is \(D = b^2 - 4ac\). So, let's compute the discriminant for our equation:

Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = (4 - k)\), and \(c = 4\). So,

\[
D = (4 - k)^2 - 4(1)(4)
\]

Calculating that:

\[
D = (16 - 8k + k^2) - 16
\]
\[
D = k^2 - 8k
\]

Hmm, so the discriminant is \(D = k^2 - 8k\). Now, for the quadratic equation to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero. So, set \(D = 0\):

\[
k^2 - 8k = 0
\]

Factor:

\[
k(k - 8) = 0
\]

So, the solutions are \(k = 0\) or \(k = 8\). Therefore, for these values of \(k\), the quadratic equation will have exactly one real solution.

But wait, before I jump to conclusions, I need to remember that the original logarithmic equation also has conditions on the domain. The logarithm functions require their arguments to be positive. So, let me note those:

1. For \(\log(kx)\), we must have \(kx > 0\).
2. For \(\log(x + 2)\), we must have \(x + 2 > 0\), which implies \(x > -2\).

So, combining these, \(x > -2\) and \(kx > 0\). Depending on the value of \(k\), this implies different conditions on \(x\).

Therefore, for each \(k\), we need to see if the quadratic equation has a solution that also satisfies the domain conditions.

Let me analyze the two cases when \(k = 0\) and \(k = 8\):

**Case 1: \(k = 0\)**

Substituting \(k = 0\) into the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 + (4 - 0)x + 4 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0
\]
\[
(x + 2)^2 = 0
\]
\[
x = -2
\]

But wait, in the domain conditions, \(x > -2\) and \(kx > 0\). Since \(k = 0\), \(kx = 0\), which is not greater than 0. So, \(x = -2\) is not in the domain. Therefore, there is no solution for \(k = 0\).

**Case 2: \(k = 8\)**

Substituting \(k = 8\) into the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 + (4 - 8)x + 4 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0
\]
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 0
\]
\[
x = 2
\]

Now, checking the domain conditions: \(x > -2\) and \(kx > 0\). \(x = 2\) is clearly greater than -2. \(k = 8\) is positive, so \(8*2 = 16 > 0\). So, \(x = 2\) is a valid solution. Therefore, for \(k = 8\), there's exactly one real solution.

So, from the discriminant approach, \(k = 0\) gives no solution, and \(k = 8\) gives exactly one solution. But, wait, the problem says "exactly one real solution." So, does that mean that only \(k = 8\) works? Or are there other possibilities?

But hold on, maybe when the quadratic equation has two solutions, but only one of them is valid because it doesn't satisfy the domain conditions. So, perhaps for other values of \(k\), the quadratic equation has two solutions, but only one of them falls into the domain. So, the number of real solutions for the original logarithmic equation could be one even if the quadratic has two solutions.

Therefore, I need to consider whether for other values of \(k\), the quadratic equation has two solutions, but only one is in the domain \(x > -2\) and \(kx > 0\). If so, then such \(k\) would also result in exactly one real solution.

Therefore, perhaps I should also analyze the quadratic equation for different ranges of \(k\), and see whether it has two solutions, but only one is valid.

Let me think about this.

First, let's consider the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0
\]

Let me denote this as \(f(x) = x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4\). Since the coefficient of \(x^2\) is positive, the parabola opens upwards. So, the graph will have a minimum point.

For the quadratic to have two real roots, discriminant \(D > 0\), which occurs when \(k^2 - 8k > 0\). So, \(k(k - 8) > 0\). So, this inequality holds when \(k < 0\) or \(k > 8\).

Therefore, for \(k < 0\) or \(k > 8\), the quadratic equation has two real roots. Now, I need to check whether these roots satisfy the domain conditions \(x > -2\) and \(kx > 0\).

Given that \(k\) is a real number, but we are only concerned with integer values of \(k\) in the interval \([-500, 500]\). So, \(k\) can be any integer from -500 to 500. So, let's see.

But before that, let me note that for \(k > 8\), \(k\) is positive, so \(kx > 0\) requires \(x > 0\). For \(k < 0\), \(kx > 0\) requires \(x < 0\).

So, depending on the sign of \(k\), the domain conditions will impose different constraints on \(x\).

Let me consider the cases \(k > 8\), \(k = 8\), \(k < 0\), and \(k = 0\) separately.

**Case 1: \(k > 8\)**

In this case, \(k\) is positive, so \(kx > 0\) implies \(x > 0\). So, \(x\) must be positive.

So, the quadratic equation is \(x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0\). Let me denote the roots as \(x_1\) and \(x_2\). Since the parabola opens upwards, and \(D > 0\), the quadratic will have two real roots. But since \(k > 8\), the quadratic equation will have two real roots, but we need to check whether these roots are positive.

So, let's find the roots:

Using quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-(4 - k) \pm \sqrt{(4 - k)^2 - 16}}{2}
\]

Simplify the discriminant:

\[
\sqrt{(4 - k)^2 - 16} = \sqrt{k^2 - 8k + 16 - 16} = \sqrt{k^2 - 8k} = \sqrt{D}
\]

But \(D = k^2 - 8k\), which is positive when \(k > 8\) or \(k < 0\). So, the roots become:

\[
x = \frac{-(4 - k) \pm \sqrt{k^2 - 8k}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{k - 4 \pm \sqrt{k^2 - 8k}}{2}
\]

Now, let's denote:

\[
x_1 = \frac{k - 4 + \sqrt{k^2 - 8k}}{2}
\]
\[
x_2 = \frac{k - 4 - \sqrt{k^2 - 8k}}{2}
\]

We need to determine whether both \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are positive.

Given that \(k > 8\), let's see:

First, \(k - 4\) is positive because \(k > 8\), so \(k - 4 > 4\). Then, the term \(\sqrt{k^2 - 8k}\) is also positive. So, \(x_1\) is the sum of two positive numbers divided by 2, so \(x_1 > 0\).

For \(x_2\), we have \(k - 4 - \sqrt{k^2 - 8k}\). Let's compute this expression:

Let me denote \(sqrt(k^2 - 8k) = \sqrt{k(k - 8)}\). Since \(k > 8\), \(k(k - 8)\) is positive, so it's a real number.

Now, \(k - 4\) is definitely greater than \(\sqrt{k^2 - 8k}\) when \(k > 8\). Wait, is that true?

Let me compute:

Let me square both sides to see if \(k - 4 > \sqrt{k^2 - 8k}\).

Square both sides:

Left side: \((k - 4)^2 = k^2 - 8k + 16\)

Right side: \(k^2 - 8k\)

So, we have:

\(k^2 - 8k + 16 > k^2 - 8k\)

Subtract \(k^2 - 8k\) from both sides:

16 > 0, which is always true.

Therefore, \(\sqrt{k^2 - 8k} < k - 4\) when \(k > 8\). Therefore, \(x_2 = \frac{k - 4 - \sqrt{k^2 - 8k}}{2}\) is positive? Let's check.

Compute numerator: \(k - 4 - \sqrt{k^2 - 8k}\)

We just saw that \(k - 4 > \sqrt{k^2 - 8k}\), so numerator is positive. Therefore, \(x_2 > 0\).

Therefore, both roots \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are positive, so both are valid solutions for \(k > 8\).

But wait, hold on. The quadratic equation has two positive roots when \(k > 8\). However, we need to make sure that both roots are valid, i.e., they satisfy \(x > 0\) and \(kx > 0\). But since \(k > 8\), the second condition is automatically satisfied as \(x > 0\). So, both roots are valid.

Therefore, for \(k > 8\), the equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2)\) has two real solutions.

But the problem is asking for the number of integer values of \(k\) in \([-500, 500]\) where the equation has exactly one real solution. So, in this case, for \(k > 8\), the equation has two real solutions, which is more than one, so they don't count. So, no \(k > 8\) will satisfy the condition.

**Case 2: \(k = 8\)**

We already saw earlier that for \(k = 8\), the quadratic equation reduces to \((x - 2)^2 = 0\), so \(x = 2\). Let's verify the domain:

\(x = 2 > -2\) is true, and \(8*2 = 16 > 0\), so \(kx > 0\) is also true. Therefore, \(x = 2\) is a valid solution. So, for \(k = 8\), exactly one real solution exists.

**Case 3: \(k = 0\)**

Earlier, when \(k = 0\), we found that the quadratic equation becomes \((x + 2)^2 = 0\), giving \(x = -2\). But checking the domain, \(x = -2\) is not greater than -2, so it's invalid. Therefore, no solution in this case.

**Case 4: \(k < 0\)**

Now, for \(k < 0\), \(kx > 0\) implies \(x < 0\), since \(k\) is negative and we need the product to be positive. So, \(x\) must be negative.

So, let me analyze the quadratic equation for \(k < 0\):

Quadratic equation: \(x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0\). Since \(k < 0\), \(4 - k\) is greater than 4. So, \(4 - k > 4\). Now, the coefficients are \(a = 1\), \(b = (4 - k)\), \(c = 4\).

Let me compute the discriminant again:

\(D = k^2 - 8k\)

Since \(k < 0\), \(k^2\) is positive, and \(-8k\) is positive as well, so \(D = k^2 - 8k > 0\). Therefore, two real roots.

Now, to check whether both roots are negative or if one is negative and one is positive.

For a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), the sum of roots is \(-b/a\) and the product is \(c/a\).

In our case, sum of roots is \(-(4 - k)\) and product is 4.

So, product of roots is 4, which is positive. Therefore, both roots have the same sign.

Sum of roots is \(-(4 - k)\). Since \(k < 0\), \(4 - k\) is greater than 4, so \(-(4 - k)\) is negative. Therefore, both roots are negative.

Therefore, for \(k < 0\), both roots are negative, so both are valid solutions in the domain \(x < 0\). So, the quadratic equation has two real solutions, both negative, so both are valid.

But hold on, the original logarithmic equation requires \(kx > 0\), which for \(k < 0\) and \(x < 0\), is satisfied. So, both solutions are valid.

Thus, for \(k < 0\), the equation has two real solutions, which is more than one, so they don't count towards our problem.

**So, summarizing the above cases:**

- For \(k > 8\): Two real solutions.
- For \(k = 8\): Exactly one real solution.
- For \(k = 0\): No real solutions.
- For \(k < 0\): Two real solutions.

Therefore, the only \(k\) in the interval \([-500, 500]\) where the equation has exactly one real solution is \(k = 8\).

But wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other cases.

Wait, could there be a case where the quadratic has exactly one real solution but that solution doesn't satisfy the domain conditions? For example, when the quadratic equation has a repeated root (i.e., when \(k = 0\) or \(k = 8\)), but in the case of \(k = 0\), the quadratic had a repeated root at \(x = -2\), which was invalid. For \(k = 8\), the repeated root was at \(x = 2\), which was valid.

Therefore, in these cases, the repeated roots either resulted in a valid solution or not. So, \(k = 8\) is the only value where the equation has exactly one real solution.

But wait, hold on a second. What if the quadratic equation has one valid solution and one invalid solution? Is that possible?

Let me think. If the quadratic equation has one positive and one negative root, but only one of them is valid in the domain.

But in our earlier analysis, for \(k > 8\), both roots are positive, so both are valid. For \(k < 0\), both roots are negative, so both are valid.

For \(k = 0\), both roots are invalid. For \(k = 8\), the root is valid.

Wait, but what if \(k\) is such that the quadratic has one positive and one negative root? Is that possible?

But for that to happen, the product of the roots is 4, which is positive. So, as before, both roots have the same sign. Therefore, if one root is positive, the other must be positive as well, because their product is positive. Similarly, if one is negative, the other is negative. So, in all cases, the quadratic either has two positive roots or two negative roots, or one repeated root at zero or negative.

Wait, but \(k\) is in the interval \([-500, 500]\). So, perhaps when \(k = 0\), it's a special case where the repeated root is at \(x = -2\), which is invalid.

Therefore, in all other cases (except \(k = 8\)), the quadratic has either two positive roots (for \(k > 8\)) or two negative roots (for \(k < 0\)), both of which are valid. So, only \(k = 8\) gives exactly one real solution.

But wait, is that all? Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: for \(k = 16\), for example, maybe the quadratic equation has one positive and one negative root? But no, because the product of the roots is 4, which is positive, so they must both be positive or both be negative. So, in that case, no, you can't have one positive and one negative root.

Wait, unless \(k\) is such that the quadratic equation is something else, but no, the product of roots is fixed as 4.

So, perhaps, in this problem, it's only \(k = 8\) that gives exactly one real solution.

But hold on, let me test \(k = 8\) again.

Wait, when \(k = 8\), the quadratic equation becomes \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\), which factors as \((x - 2)^2 = 0\). So, the only solution is \(x = 2\), which is valid because \(2 > -2\) and \(8 * 2 = 16 > 0\). So, exactly one solution.

For \(k = 0\), the equation becomes \(x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0\), which is \((x + 2)^2 = 0\), giving \(x = -2\), which is invalid.

For \(k = 1\), let's compute the quadratic equation:

\(x^2 + (4 - 1)x + 4 = 0\)
\(x^2 + 3x + 4 = 0\)

Discriminant: \(9 - 16 = -7\), which is negative, so no real solutions.

Similarly, for \(k = 2\):

\(x^2 + (4 - 2)x + 4 = 0\)
\(x^2 + 2x + 4 = 0\)
Discriminant: \(4 - 16 = -12\), no real solutions.

Wait, but when \(k = 8\), discriminant is zero, but we have exactly one solution.

But for \(k > 8\), discriminant is positive, quadratic has two real roots, both positive.

So, in those cases, we have two real solutions.

For \(k < 0\), discriminant is positive, quadratic has two real roots, both negative.

So, in all cases except \(k = 8\), the equation has either two real solutions or none. So, only \(k = 8\) gives exactly one real solution.

But hold on, is there a scenario where one of the roots of the quadratic is exactly at the boundary, such as \(x = -2\) or \(x = 2\), but neither is in the domain? For example, if the quadratic equation has a root at \(x = -2\), which is invalid, but another root is valid.

But in our case, when \(k = 0\), the quadratic equation is \((x + 2)^2 = 0\), so the root is \(x = -2\), which is on the boundary of the domain. But \(x = -2\) is not greater than -2, so it's excluded. Similarly, for \(k = 8\), the root is \(x = 2\), which is in the domain.

Is there any other \(k\) where the quadratic equation has a root at the boundary?

Let me think. For example, maybe when the quadratic equation has a double root at \(x = -2\) or \(x = 2\). But for \(k = 0\), the root is at \(x = -2\), which is invalid, and for \(k = 8\), the root is at \(x = 2\), which is valid.

But suppose there's another \(k\) where the quadratic equation has a root at \(x = -2\) or \(x = 2\). Let's see:

If the quadratic equation \(x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0\) has a root at \(x = -2\), then plugging \(x = -2\) into the equation:

\[
(-2)^2 + (4 - k)(-2) + 4 = 0
\]
\[
4 - 2(4 - k) + 4 = 0
\]
\[
4 - 8 + 2k + 4 = 0
\]
\[
(4 - 8 + 4) + 2k = 0
\]
\[
0 + 2k = 0
\]
\[
2k = 0
\]
\[
k = 0
\]

So, only when \(k = 0\), does the quadratic equation have a root at \(x = -2\), which is invalid. Similarly, if the quadratic equation has a root at \(x = 2\), plugging \(x = 2\) into the equation:

\[
(2)^2 + (4 - k)(2) + 4 = 0
\]
\[
4 + 8 - 2k + 4 = 0
\]
\[
16 - 2k = 0
\]
\[
2k = 16
\]
\[
k = 8
\]

So, only when \(k = 8\), does the quadratic equation have a root at \(x = 2\), which is valid.

Therefore, in all other cases, the quadratic equation doesn't have roots at these boundary points, so both roots are strictly inside the domain or both are strictly outside.

Therefore, except for \(k = 8\), which gives exactly one solution, no other \(k\) in the interval \([-500, 500]\) will result in exactly one real solution.

Therefore, the number of integer values of \(k\) is 1, which is \(k = 8\). Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure.

Wait, but let me think of another angle. Maybe the original equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2)\) could have cases where \(kx\) is equal to \((x + 2)^2\), but \(kx\) is also something else. Maybe, but I don't think so. Because we already converted it to the quadratic equation.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think: maybe for some \(k\), the quadratic equation might have a solution that is not in the domain, but also, the quadratic equation could have a repeated root at the boundary. So, for \(k = 0\), the root is at \(x = -2\), which is invalid, but for \(k = 8\), the root is at \(x = 2\), which is valid. So, only \(k = 8\) gives exactly one solution.

But, wait, in the initial analysis, when \(k = 8\), the equation reduces to a perfect square, so it's a tangent to the domain. So, only that point is valid.

But, now, let me think: is there a case where the quadratic equation has a solution at \(x = -2\) or \(x = 2\), which is a boundary point, but the equation is satisfied? For instance, when \(k = 0\), the equation is satisfied at \(x = -2\), but it's not in the domain. So, it's excluded.

Similarly, if there is a \(k\) such that the quadratic equation has a solution at \(x = -2\), but for that, \(k\) would have to be 0 as above, which is invalid. Similarly, for \(x = 2\), it's only when \(k = 8\), which is valid.

Therefore, the only value of \(k\) that gives exactly one real solution is \(k = 8\).

Wait, but wait another thought: in the problem statement, it's written as \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2)\). So, the arguments inside the logarithm must be positive. So, \(kx > 0\) and \(x + 2 > 0\). So, for \(k > 0\), \(x > 0\); for \(k < 0\), \(x < 0\).

But, in our analysis, for \(k > 8\), both roots are positive; for \(k = 8\), one root is positive; for \(k < 8\), but \(k < 0\), both roots are negative.

Wait, hold on, actually, for \(k > 8\), the quadratic equation is \(x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0\). The roots are both positive because the sum and product are positive.

For \(k < 0\), the quadratic equation is \(x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0\). The sum of roots is \(-(4 - k)\), which is negative because \(k < 0\), so \(-(4 - k)\) is negative. The product of roots is 4, which is positive. So, both roots have to be negative because their sum is negative and their product is positive.

Therefore, for \(k > 8\), both roots are positive and satisfy \(x > 0\). For \(k < 0\), both roots are negative and satisfy \(x < 0\). For \(k = 8\), the quadratic has a repeated root at \(x = 2\), which is positive, so it's valid. For \(k = 0\), the quadratic has a repeated root at \(x = -2\), which is invalid.

Thus, only \(k = 8\) gives exactly one valid solution.

Therefore, the only integer value is \(k = 8\). Hence, the number of integer values is 1.

But wait, let me think if I missed another case where the quadratic equation could have exactly one solution in the domain, even if the discriminant is zero. But in our earlier analysis, for \(k = 8\), the discriminant is zero and the root is valid. For \(k = 0\), the discriminant is zero but the root is invalid. For \(k > 8\), discriminant is positive, two real roots, both valid. For \(k < 0\), discriminant is positive, two real roots, both valid.

Therefore, only \(k = 8\) gives exactly one real solution.

But wait, hold on. Let me think if \(k\) is such that the quadratic equation has a repeated root at \(x = -2\). But as we saw, that only occurs when \(k = 0\), which is invalid. Similarly, a repeated root at \(x = 2\) only occurs for \(k = 8\), which is valid.

Therefore, only \(k = 8\) gives exactly one solution.

Wait, but before, I thought that for \(k > 8\), the quadratic equation has two positive roots, so the equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2)\) has two solutions. Similarly, for \(k < 0\), two negative solutions. So, indeed, only \(k = 8\) gives exactly one solution.

Therefore, the number of integer \(k\) in \([-500, 500]\) is 1.

But wait, hold on a second. Let me check the problem statement again: "the equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2)\) has exactly one real solution."

But in my analysis, only \(k = 8\) gives exactly one real solution. So, the answer should be 1.

But wait, wait, wait. Let me think about another possibility. Suppose that the quadratic equation has one solution in the domain and the other is not, but since the quadratic equation is in \(x\), for certain \(k\), maybe one solution is in the domain and the other is not. But in our analysis, in \(k > 8\), both roots are positive, so both are in the domain. For \(k < 0\), both roots are negative, so both are in the domain.

But wait, for \(k = 8\), the quadratic equation has a repeated root at \(x = 2\), which is in the domain.

So, all other \(k\) in the given interval result in the quadratic equation having either two valid solutions (for \(k > 8\) and \(k < 0\)) or no solutions (for \(k = 0\)). Therefore, only \(k = 8\) gives exactly one solution.

Therefore, the number of integer values is 1.

But, hold on, let me think if \(k = 16\) could result in a unique solution, but no, as we saw, for \(k = 16\), the quadratic would have two positive roots, so both are valid.

Similarly, for \(k = 1\), quadratic has no real solutions.

Wait, maybe I should consider \(k = -8\). Let me see.

For \(k = -8\), the quadratic equation is:

\(x^2 + (4 - (-8))x + 4 = 0\)
\(x^2 + 12x + 4 = 0\)

Compute discriminant:

\(144 - 16 = 128 > 0\), so two real roots.

Sum of roots: \(-12\), product: 4.

Since product is positive, both roots have same sign as sum is negative. So, both roots negative.

So, for \(k = -8\), quadratic equation has two negative roots, which are valid in the domain \(x < 0\). So, both are valid.

Therefore, for \(k = -8\), two real solutions. So, no, \(k = -8\) does not result in exactly one solution.

Similarly, for \(k = -4\):

Quadratic equation:

\(x^2 + (4 - (-4))x + 4 = 0\)
\(x^2 + 8x + 4 = 0\)

Discriminant: \(64 - 16 = 48 > 0\), two real roots.

Sum of roots: \(-8\), which is negative, product is 4, positive. So, both roots negative. So, both valid.

Therefore, for \(k = -4\), two real solutions.

Hence, only \(k = 8\) gives exactly one solution.

Wait, but I just thought of something.

Wait, when \(k = 8\), we have a repeated root at \(x = 2\). So, technically, it's a single solution with multiplicity two, but in terms of distinct real solutions, it's just one.

But in the problem statement, it says "exactly one real solution." So, if it's a repeated root, does that count as one solution or two?

In mathematics, a repeated root is still one solution with multiplicity two, but in the context of the problem, if the question is about the number of real solutions, it's typically considered as one solution, regardless of multiplicity, because multiplicity doesn't change the number of distinct real solutions.

Therefore, in this case, \(k = 8\) gives exactly one real solution, so that is acceptable.

But, just to make sure, let me think about the original equation when \(k = 8\). The equation becomes \(\log(8x) = 2\log(x + 2)\). So, we can solve it:

\[
\log(8x) = \log((x + 2)^2)
\]
Which implies \(8x = (x + 2)^2\), as both logs are defined for positive arguments.

Solving \(8x = x^2 + 4x + 4\), we get \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\), which is \((x - 2)^2 = 0\), so \(x = 2\), which is valid.

Therefore, yes, \(k = 8\) is the only integer value in the interval \([-500, 500]\) where the equation has exactly one real solution.

Therefore, the number of integer values is 1.

Wait, hold on, but let me double-check: the problem says "the equation has exactly one real solution." So, in the case of \(k = 8\), we have exactly one real solution, which is \(x = 2\). So, that is correct.

But, hold on, wait a second. Let me also check if the quadratic equation for \(k = 8\) actually has a repeated root. Yes, because discriminant is zero, so it's a repeated root. So, in terms of real solutions, it's just one, even though it's a double root.

But, in the problem statement, it's about the equation having exactly one real solution. So, whether it's a repeated root or not, as long as it's only one real solution, it's acceptable.

Therefore, the conclusion is that only \(k = 8\) is the integer in the given interval where the equation has exactly one real solution.

Therefore, the number of integer values is 1.

But, hold on, wait, but in my initial analysis, I thought that for \(k = 8\), the equation has exactly one real solution, so only one integer value. But now, I'm second-guessing because the problem says "exactly one real solution," but when I think about the equation, it's possible that maybe for some \(k\), the quadratic equation has a solution that is a point of tangency, but in this case, it's a repeated root at \(x = 2\), which is a valid solution.

But in the problem statement, it's about the equation having exactly one real solution, regardless of multiplicity, so it's acceptable.

Therefore, the final answer is 1. So, the number of integer values of \(k\) is \(\boxed{1}\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
</think>

To find the number of integer values of \( k \) in the closed interval \([-500, 500]\) for which the equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2)\) has exactly one real solution, we start by simplifying the equation.

First, we rewrite the equation using properties of logarithms:
\[
\log(kx) = \log((x + 2)^2)
\]
This implies:
\[
kx = (x + 2)^2
\]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0
\]
We need to determine the values of \( k \) for which this quadratic equation has exactly one real solution. A quadratic equation has exactly one real solution if its discriminant is zero. The discriminant \( D \) is given by:
\[
D = (4 - k)^2 - 16
\]
Setting the discriminant to zero:
\[
(4 - k)^2 - 16 = 0
\]
Solving this, we get:
\[
(4 - k)^2 = 16 \implies 4 - k = \pm 4
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
4 - k = 4 \implies k = 0
\]
\[
4 - k = -4 \implies k = 8
\]
We analyze the cases for each \( k \):

1. **For \( k = 0 \)**:
   - The quadratic equation becomes \((x + 2)^2 = 0\), which has a solution \( x = -2 \). However, this is invalid because \( x = -2 \) is not greater than -2. Thus, no solution.

2. **For \( k = 8 \)**:
   - The quadratic equation becomes \((x - 2)^2 = 0\), which has a solution \( x = 2 \). This is valid because \( x = 2 \) is greater than -2. Thus, exactly one solution.

For other values of \( k \):
- If \( k > 8 \), the quadratic equation has two positive solutions.
- If \( k < 0 \), the quadratic equation has two negative solutions.
- For \( k = 0 \) and \( k < 0 \), the equations have no valid solutions.

Thus, the only value of \( k \) in the interval \([-500, 500]\) that results in exactly one real solution is \( k = 8 \).

Therefore, the number of integer values of \( k \) is \(\boxed{1}\).
