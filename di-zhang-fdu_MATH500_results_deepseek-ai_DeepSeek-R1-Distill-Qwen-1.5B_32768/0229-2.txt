Question:
The solutions of the equation $z^4+4z^3i-6z^2-4zi-i=0$ are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane.  The area of this polygon can be expressed in the form $p^{a/b},$ where $a,$ $b,$ $p$ are positive integers, $p$ is prime, and $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime.  Find $a + b + p.$

Correct Answer:
By the Binomial Theorem,
\begin{align*}
(z + i)^4 &= z^4 + 4z^3 i + 6z^2 i^2 + 4zi^3 + 1 \\
&= z^4 + 4iz^3 - 6z^2 - 4iz + 1.
\end{align*}So, if $z^4 + 4z^3 i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0,$ then
\[(z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4iz^3 - 6z^2 - 4iz + 1 = 1 + i.\]Let $w = z + i,$ so $w^4 = 1 + i.$  (If we plot the solutions $w$ in the complex plane, we obtain the same area as from the solutions $z$ in the complex plane, because the substitution $w = z + i$ simply translates the polygon.)

If $w^4 = 1 + i,$ then
\[(wi)^4 = w^4 i^4 = w^4 = 1 + i.\]Thus, if $w$ is a solution, then so are $iw,$ $i^2 w = -w,$ and $i^3 w = -iw,$ which form a square in the complex plane.

From the equation $w^4 = 1 + i,$ $|w^4| = |1 + i|.$  Then $|w|^4 = \sqrt{2},$ so $|w| = 2^{1/8}.$  Therefore, the side length of the square is
\[|w - iw| = |w||1 - i| = 2^{1/8} \sqrt{2} = 2^{5/8},\]so the area of the square is $(2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{5/4}.$  The final answer is $5 + 4 + 2 = \boxed{11}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this equation: \( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \). The solutions to this equation are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of this polygon expressed in a specific form. Then, I have to find \( a + b + p \), where the area is \( p^{a/b} \).

First, I remember that solving a quartic equation can sometimes be done by factoring or by using substitution. Let me look at the equation again:

\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \).

Hmm, the coefficients involve powers of \( i \). Maybe there's a pattern here? Let me try to factor it.

Wait, another thought: sometimes equations like this can be related to the expansion of a binomial. For example, \( (z + w)^4 \) would have terms with \( z^4 \), \( z^3w \), \( z^2w^2 \), \( zw^3 \), and \( w^4 \). Let me see if this equation resembles such a form.

Let me set \( w = i z \), because I see a lot of \( i \) terms. Let's substitute \( w = i z \) into \( (z + w)^4 \):

\( (z + w)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3 w + 6z^2 w^2 + 4z w^3 + w^4 \).

If we plug \( w = i z \), we get:

\( (z + iz)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3(iz) + 6z^2(iz)^2 + 4z(iz)^3 + (iz)^4 \).

Calculating each term:

1. \( z^4 \)
2. \( 4z^3(iz) = 4i z^4 \)
3. \( 6z^2(iz)^2 = 6z^2(i^2 z^2) = 6z^2(-1)z^2 = -6z^4 \)
4. \( 4z(iz)^3 = 4z(i^3 z^3) = 4z(-i)z^3 = -4i z^4 \)
5. \( (iz)^4 = i^4 z^4 = 1 z^4 \)

So putting all these together:

\( (z + iz)^4 = z^4 + 4i z^4 - 6z^4 - 4i z^4 + z^4 \).

Combine like terms:

\( (1 + 4i - 6 - 4i + 1) z^4 = (2) z^4 \).

Wait, that's interesting. So \( (z + iz)^4 = 2 z^4 \).

But our original equation is \( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \).

Hmm, comparing with \( (z + iz)^4 = 2 z^4 \), it's not exactly the same. But maybe we can manipulate the original equation to relate it to \( (z + iz)^4 \).

Let me rewrite the original equation:

\( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6 z^2 - 4i z - i = 0 \).

If I factor out a \( z^4 \) from each term, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe factor the equation as \( (z + something)^4 = something \).

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the equation step by step.

Wait, another idea: Since the equation resembles a binomial expansion, perhaps it can be written as \( (z + i)^4 \) but adjusted for the coefficients. Let me compute \( (z + i)^4 \):

\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3 i + 6z^2 i^2 + 4z i^3 + i^4 \).

Simplify each term:

1. \( z^4 \)
2. \( 4z^3 i \)
3. \( 6z^2 (-1) = -6z^2 \)
4. \( 4z (-i) = -4i z \)
5. \( 1 \)

So, \( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6z^2 - 4i z + 1 \).

Wait a minute, our equation is \( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6z^2 - 4i z - i = 0 \).

Comparing this to \( (z + i)^4 \), which is \( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6z^2 - 4i z + 1 \). So, the original equation is \( (z + i)^4 - 2i = 0 \).

Wait, let me see:

\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6z^2 - 4i z + 1 \).

So, subtracting \( 2i \) from both sides, we get:

\( (z + i)^4 - 2i = z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6z^2 - 4i z - i = 0 \).

Yes! That's precisely the equation given. Therefore, the equation can be written as \( (z + i)^4 - 2i = 0 \), which simplifies to \( (z + i)^4 = 2i \).

So, this means that the solutions to the equation are the fourth roots of \( 2i \) shifted by \( -i \). In other words, each solution is \( w = z + i \), where \( w^4 = 2i \).

So, to find the solutions \( z \), we can find the fourth roots of \( 2i \) and then subtract \( i \) from each.

First, let's compute the fourth roots of \( 2i \). To do this, we can express \( 2i \) in polar form. Since \( 2i \) is a complex number with magnitude 2 and angle \( \pi/2 \) radians.

So, \( 2i = 2 (\cos \pi/2 + i \sin \pi/2) \).

The fourth roots of this will have magnitude \( (2)^{1/4} = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \), and angles \( \frac{\pi/2 + 2\pi k}{4} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \).

So, the fourth roots are:

1. \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos \frac{\pi}{8} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{8} \right) \)
2. \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos \frac{5\pi}{8} + i \sin \frac{5\pi}{8} \right) \)
3. \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos \frac{9\pi}{8} + i \sin \frac{9\pi}{8} \right) \)
4. \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos \frac{13\pi}{8} + i \sin \frac{13\pi}{8} \right) \)

Therefore, the solutions \( w \) are these four roots, and the solutions \( z \) are \( w - i \).

So, each \( z \) is \( w - i = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \right) - i \).

Let me write the four solutions \( z \):

1. \( z_1 = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos \frac{\pi}{8} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{8} \right) - i \)
2. \( z_2 = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos \frac{5\pi}{8} + i \sin \frac{5\pi}{8} \right) - i \)
3. \( z_3 = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos \frac{9\pi}{8} + i \sin \frac{9\pi}{8} \right) - i \)
4. \( z_4 = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos \frac{13\pi}{8} + i \sin \frac{13\pi}{8} \right) - i \)

Now, to plot these points in the complex plane, each \( z \) is a point with coordinates \( ( \text{Re}(z), \text{Im}(z) ) \).

Let me compute the real and imaginary parts for each \( z \).

Let’s denote \( r = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \), which is \( 2^{1/4} \).

So, \( z_k = r (\cos \theta_k + i \sin \theta_k) - i \).

This can be rewritten as:

\( z_k = r \cos \theta_k + i (r \sin \theta_k - 1) \).

Therefore, the real part is \( r \cos \theta_k \), and the imaginary part is \( r \sin \theta_k - 1 \).

Let’s compute each \( z_k \):

1. \( z_1 \):

- \( \theta_1 = \pi/8 \)
- \( \cos \pi/8 = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}} / 2 \)
- \( \sin \pi/8 = \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}} / 2 \)
- So, Real part: \( r \cos \pi/8 = 2^{1/4} \cdot \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}} / 2 \)
- Let’s compute \( 2^{1/4} = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \approx 1.1892 \), but exact value is \( 2^{1/4} \).
- Then, \( \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}} / 2 \) is \( \cos \pi/8 \).
- So, real part: \( 2^{1/4} \cdot \cos \pi/8 \)
- Imaginary part: \( 2^{1/4} \cdot \sin \pi/8 - 1 \)

But maybe instead of computing numerically, I can find an expression for the area.

Wait, since all four roots are equally spaced around a circle of radius \( 2^{1/4} \), shifted by \( -i \), their positions relative to the origin are the points of the fourth roots of \( 2i \), but then we subtract \( i \) from each. So, each point is shifted down by \( i \), which is equivalent to subtracting 1 from the imaginary part.

Therefore, in the complex plane, these four points are the four points equally spaced around a circle of radius \( 2^{1/4} \), but each shifted down by 1 unit. So, their positions are similar to a square rotated 45 degrees, but each point is on a circle of radius \( 2^{1/4} \) and then shifted down.

But to find the area of the convex polygon formed by these four points, we need to figure out their coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe the area can be found using the roots of the equation. Since they are the fourth roots of \( 2i \) shifted down by \( i \), which is a purely imaginary number. So, geometrically, the polygon is a square rotated 45 degrees, but each vertex is shifted down by 1 unit.

Wait, actually, if we have four points equally spaced on a circle, the area of the polygon they form is the same as the area of the polygon formed by those points. But in this case, they're shifted, so the polygon is a square, but each vertex is moved down by 1.

Wait, but 2i is a complex number with magnitude 2, angle π/2. Its fourth roots are four points on a circle of radius 2^{1/4} at angles π/8, 5π/8, 9π/8, 13π/8.

When we subtract i from each, it's moving each point by -i, which is (0, -1) in the complex plane. So, each point is shifted down by 1 unit.

So, the original square would have been the fourth roots of 2i, which is a square centered at the origin, with vertices on a circle of radius 2^{1/4}, rotated by 45 degrees relative to the axes. Then, each vertex is moved down by 1 unit, so the polygon becomes a square but shifted down.

But actually, when we shift all four points down by 1, the figure remains a square but translated down. The area should remain the same as the original square, right? Because translation doesn't change the area.

Wait, but the original square's area is... Let me think. If the four points are equally spaced on a circle of radius \( r = 2^{1/4} \), then the side length of the square can be found.

Wait, no, actually, a square's area when its vertices lie on a circle of radius \( r \) is \( 2 r^2 \). Hmm, is that correct?

Wait, no, actually, for a square inscribed in a circle of radius \( r \), the side length \( s \) is \( s = r \sqrt{2} \). So, the area would be \( s^2 = 2 r^2 \). So yes, the area is \( 2 r^2 \).

In this case, \( r = 2^{1/4} \), so the area would be \( 2 (2^{1/4})^2 = 2 \cdot 2^{1/2} = 2^{3/2} = 2 \sqrt{2} \).

But wait, is that correct? Because the original square is formed by the fourth roots of \( 2i \), which are on a circle of radius \( 2^{1/4} \). So, the area of that square is indeed \( 2 r^2 = 2 (2^{1/4})^2 = 2 \cdot 2^{1/2} = 2^{3/2} = 2 \sqrt{2} \).

But in our case, each point is shifted down by 1 unit. So, the polygon is a square, but each vertex is at (x, y - 1). Since the square was originally centered at the origin, shifting all points down by 1 will shift the square down by 1, but the side lengths and angles remain the same. Therefore, the area remains \( 2 \sqrt{2} \).

Wait, but let me verify that. When you shift all points in a polygon by a constant vector, the area remains the same. Because translation doesn't change distances or angles, just shifts them. So, yes, the area should remain the same.

But wait, in our case, the original equation is \( (z + i)^4 = 2i \). So, the solutions are the fourth roots of \( 2i \), which form a square centered at the origin, each vertex at radius \( 2^{1/4} \) at angles \( \pi/8, 5\pi/8, 9\pi/8, 13\pi/8 \).

So, when we subtract \( i \) from each, each point is moved down by 1. So, the new points are at:

1. \( ( - \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \cos \pi/8, - ( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \sin \pi/8 + 1 ) ) \)
2. \( ( - \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \cos 5\pi/8, - ( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \sin 5\pi/8 + 1 ) ) \)
3. \( ( - \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \cos 9\pi/8, - ( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \sin 9\pi/8 + 1 ) ) \)
4. \( ( - \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \cos 13\pi/8, - ( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \sin 13\pi/8 + 1 ) ) \)

So, each point is shifted down by 1. Now, since the polygon is convex, and the original square is centered at (0,0), shifting it down by 1 would make it a square centered at (0, -1). So, the distance from the center to each vertex remains the same, but the vertical position is shifted.

But since the horizontal distances are unaffected, the side lengths should remain the same, and the area should remain the same. Therefore, the area is still \( 2 \sqrt{2} \).

But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something because the polygon is not necessarily axis-aligned.

Wait, actually, the original square is rotated by 45 degrees. So, when I shift all points down, the polygon is still a square, but its center is now at (0, -1). The side length of the square should remain the same, so the area should still be \( 2 \sqrt{2} \).

But let me verify by actually computing the coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area using the shoelace formula. Let me try.

First, I need to find the coordinates of the four points.

Let me compute each one:

1. \( z_1 = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} (\cos \pi/8 + i \sin \pi/8) - i \)
   - \( \cos \pi/8 = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}} / 2 \approx 0.9239 \)
   - \( \sin \pi/8 = \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}} / 2 \approx 0.3827 \)
   - So, real part: \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \times 0.9239 \approx 2^{1/4} \times 0.9239 \approx 1.1892 \times 0.9239 \approx 1.100 \)
   - Imaginary part: \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \times 0.3827 \approx 1.1892 \times 0.3827 \approx 0.457 \)
   - Then, subtract 1 from the imaginary part: 0.457 - 1 = -0.543

So, point 1 is approximately (1.100, -0.543).

2. \( z_2 = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} (\cos 5\pi/8 + i \sin 5\pi/8) - i \)
   - \( \cos 5\pi/8 \approx -0.3827 \)
   - \( \sin 5\pi/8 \approx 0.9239 \)
   - Real part: \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \times (-0.3827) \approx 1.1892 \times (-0.3827) \approx -0.457 \)
   - Imaginary part: \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \times 0.9239 \approx 1.1892 \times 0.9239 \approx 1.100 \)
   - Subtract 1: 1.100 - 1 = 0.100

So, point 2 is approximately (-0.457, 0.100).

3. \( z_3 = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} (\cos 9\pi/8 + i \sin 9\pi/8) - i \)
   - \( \cos 9\pi/8 \approx -0.9239 \)
   - \( \sin 9\pi/8 \approx -0.3827 \)
   - Real part: \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \times (-0.9239) \approx 1.1892 \times (-0.9239) \approx -1.100 \)
   - Imaginary part: \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \times (-0.3827) \approx 1.1892 \times (-0.3827) \approx -0.457 \)
   - Subtract 1: -0.457 - 1 = -1.457

But wait, hold on, no. Wait, the imaginary part was already -0.457 before subtracting 1, so subtracting 1 gives -0.457 - 1 = -1.457.

But wait, no, actually, the imaginary part of \( z_3 \) is \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \times (-0.3827) \approx -0.457 \), then subtracting 1 gives -0.457 - 1 = -1.457.

Similarly, point 3 is approximately (-1.100, -1.457).

4. \( z_4 = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} (\cos 13\pi/8 + i \sin 13\pi/8) - i \)
   - \( \cos 13\pi/8 \approx 0.3827 \)
   - \( \sin 13\pi/8 \approx -0.9239 \)
   - Real part: \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \times 0.3827 \approx 1.1892 \times 0.3827 \approx 0.457 \)
   - Imaginary part: \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \times (-0.9239) \approx 1.1892 \times (-0.9239) \approx -1.100 \)
   - Subtract 1: -1.100 - 1 = -2.100

So, point 4 is approximately (0.457, -2.100).

So, the four points approximately are:

1. (1.100, -0.543)
2. (-0.457, 0.100)
3. (-1.100, -1.457)
4. (0.457, -2.100)

Now, to compute the area of the convex polygon formed by these points. Since it's a convex quadrilateral, we can use the shoelace formula.

But first, let me list their coordinates in order. Let's order them as they are found:

Point 1: (1.100, -0.543)
Point 2: (-0.457, 0.100)
Point 3: (-1.100, -1.457)
Point 4: (0.457, -2.100)

Wait, but when I connect these points, I need to make sure they are in the correct order to form a convex polygon. Let me plot them mentally.

Point 1 is in the fourth quadrant (positive real, negative imaginary).
Point 2 is in the second quadrant (negative real, positive imaginary).
Point 3 is in the third quadrant (negative real, negative imaginary).
Point 4 is further down in the fourth quadrant (positive real, negative imaginary).

Wait, maybe the order is Point 1, Point 2, Point 3, Point 4.

But to apply shoelace formula, I need to order the points either clockwise or counterclockwise around the polygon.

Looking at their approximate coordinates:

Point 1: (1.1, -0.5)
Point 2: (-0.45, 0.1)
Point 3: (-1.1, -1.45)
Point 4: (0.45, -2.1)

So, if I order them as Point 1, Point 2, Point 3, Point 4, it might go around the polygon clockwise or counterclockwise.

Wait, let me try plotting them:

Point 1: (1.1, -0.5) – right and down.

Point 2: (-0.45, 0.1) – left and up.

Point 3: (-1.1, -1.45) – left and down.

Point 4: (0.45, -2.1) – right and down.

So, if I connect them in the order Point 1, Point 2, Point 3, Point 4, it's a quadrilateral that goes from right-down, left-up, left-down, right-down. Hmm, but that might not be convex.

Wait, maybe the correct order is Point 1, Point 3, Point 4, Point 2? Let me see.

Wait, Point 1 is in the fourth quadrant, Point 3 is in the third, Point 4 is in the fourth, Point 2 is in the second. So, maybe the correct order is Point 1, Point 2, Point 3, Point 4, but I need to make sure it's convex.

Alternatively, perhaps using the shoelace formula with the points in an order that follows the polygon's perimeter.

Alternatively, maybe it's a trapezoid or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the vectors between points and use the shoelace formula.

But perhaps it's better to compute the exact coordinates.

Wait, let me note that all the points are of the form \( (\pm r \cos \theta, - (r \sin \theta + 1 )) \), with \( r = 2^{1/4} \), and angles \( \theta = \pi/8, 5\pi/8, 9\pi/8, 13\pi/8 \).

Wait, perhaps we can use the shoelace formula with these exact coordinates.

But since the coordinates are messy, perhaps it's better to compute vectors and use determinants.

Wait, but maybe we can note that the polygon is a square rotated by 45 degrees, but each vertex is shifted down by 1.

Wait, actually, the original square had four vertices at \( (r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta) \), for \( \theta = \pi/8, 5\pi/8, 9\pi/8, 13\pi/8 \).

Shifting each by \( (0, -1) \), so the polygon is \( (r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta - 1 ) \).

Thus, to compute the area, we can compute the area of the original square and then adjust for the shift.

But as I thought earlier, translation doesn't change the area. So, the area should remain \( 2 \sqrt{2} \).

But wait, let me think again. Actually, no, because when you shift the square down, the vertical distances between points change, but the horizontal distances remain the same.

Wait, but in our case, the original square has side length \( 2 r \sin (\pi/4) = 2 r \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = r \sqrt{2} \). So, the side length is \( r \sqrt{2} \). Therefore, the area is \( (r \sqrt{2})^2 = 2 r^2 \).

Given that \( r = 2^{1/4} \), then \( 2 r^2 = 2 \times (2^{1/4})^2 = 2 \times 2^{1/2} = 2^{3/2} = 2 \sqrt{2} \).

But when shifting down by 1, the polygon remains a square with the same side length, so the area remains the same.

Wait, but the vertical shift affects the polygon's area? Or not?

Wait, no, because the side length is determined by the horizontal distance, which remains the same. The vertical shift affects the height, but the side length is based on the horizontal distance between points.

Wait, actually, the original square has side length \( r \sqrt{2} \). After shifting down, the vertical side length is still \( r \sqrt{2} \), but the horizontal side length is still \( r \sqrt{2} \), so the area is still \( 2 r^2 \).

Therefore, the area should be \( 2 \sqrt{2} \).

But wait, let me verify this with the coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is a rectangle, but not a square. But given that the original square is symmetric with respect to the origin, the shifted polygon should also be symmetric and have the same area.

Wait, another approach: since the solutions are the roots of \( (z + i)^4 = 2i \), which is a square centered at \( -i \), each vertex is shifted down by 1 unit.

So, the original square had area \( 2 \sqrt{2} \), and shifting it down doesn't change the area.

But wait, actually, in our calculation earlier, using the shoelace formula with the approximate coordinates, let me try to compute the area.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a square, so area is \( 2 \sqrt{2} \), so \( a = 2 \), \( b = 2 \), \( p = 2 \), so the expression is \( 2^{2/2} = 2^1 = 2 \). But that can't be, because the area is \( 2 \sqrt{2} \), which is \( 2^{3/2} \). So, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 2 \), \( p = 2 \). So, \( a + b + p = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 \).

But I need to verify.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact area using the shoelace formula with the exact coordinates.

Let me denote the four points as follows:

Point 1: \( (r \cos \theta_1, r \sin \theta_1 - 1) \)
Point 2: \( (r \cos \theta_2, r \sin \theta_2 - 1) \)
Point 3: \( (r \cos \theta_3, r \sin \theta_3 - 1) \)
Point 4: \( (r \cos \theta_4, r \sin \theta_4 - 1) \)

Where \( \theta_1 = \pi/8 \), \( \theta_2 = 5\pi/8 \), \( \theta_3 = 9\pi/8 \), \( \theta_4 = 13\pi/8 \).

Using shoelace formula, the area is:

\( \frac{1}{2} |x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_4 + x_4 y_1 - (y_1 x_2 + y_2 x_3 + y_3 x_4 + y_4 x_1)| \)

Plugging in the coordinates:

\( x_i = r \cos \theta_i \), \( y_i = r \sin \theta_i - 1 \)

So,

Compute \( S1 = x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_4 + x_4 y_1 \)

Compute \( S2 = y_1 x_2 + y_2 x_3 + y_3 x_4 + y_4 x_1 \)

Then, the area is \( \frac{1}{2} |S1 - S2| \)

But this seems complicated with the trigonometric functions. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, since all points are obtained by rotating \( (0, -1) \) around the origin by the angles \( \theta_i \), perhaps the polygon is a rotated square, so the area is still \( 2 \sqrt{2} \).

But to double-check, perhaps I can compute the distance between two consecutive points and the angles.

Given the four points, let me compute the distance between Point 1 and Point 2.

Point 1: \( (r \cos \pi/8, r \sin \pi/8 - 1) \)

Point 2: \( (r \cos 5\pi/8, r \sin 5\pi/8 - 1) \)

The distance squared between them is:

\( (r \cos 5\pi/8 - r \cos \pi/8)^2 + (r \sin 5\pi/8 - r \sin \pi/8)^2 \)

Factor out \( r^2 \):

\( r^2 [ (\cos 5\pi/8 - \cos \pi/8)^2 + (\sin 5\pi/8 - \sin \pi/8)^2 ] \)

Using the identity \( (a - b)^2 + (c - d)^2 = (a^2 + c^2) + (b^2 + d^2) - 2(ab + cd) \), so:

\( r^2 [ \cos^2 5\pi/8 + \sin^2 5\pi/8 + \cos^2 \pi/8 + \sin^2 \pi/8 - 2 ( \cos 5\pi/8 \cos \pi/8 + \sin 5\pi/8 \sin \pi/8 ) ] \)

Simplify:

\( r^2 [ 1 + 1 - 2 ( \cos (5\pi/8 - \pi/8) ) ] \) since \( \cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B \)

So,

\( r^2 [ 2 - 2 \cos (4\pi/8) ] = r^2 [ 2 - 2 \cos (\pi/2) ] = r^2 [ 2 - 0 ] = 2 r^2 \)

So, the distance between Point 1 and Point 2 is \( \sqrt{2 r^2} = r \sqrt{2} \). So, the side length is \( r \sqrt{2} \).

Therefore, the area is \( (r \sqrt{2})^2 = 2 r^2 \). Since \( r = 2^{1/4} \), the area is \( 2 (2^{1/4})^2 = 2 \times 2^{1/2} = 2^{3/2} = 2 \sqrt{2} \).

Therefore, the area is \( 2 \sqrt{2} \), which can be expressed as \( 2^{2/2} \) since \( 2^{2/2} = 2^1 = 2 \), but wait, no. Wait, \( 2 \sqrt{2} = 2^{1} \times 2^{1/2} = 2^{3/2} \). So, \( 2^{3/2} \).

Thus, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 2 \), \( p = 2 \). Then, \( a + b + p = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 \).

Wait, but hold on. Let me confirm if the shoelace formula with the approximate coordinates gives the same area.

Earlier, I approximated the coordinates as:

1. (1.1, -0.543)
2. (-0.457, 0.100)
3. (-1.1, -1.457)
4. (0.457, -2.100)

Let me compute the shoelace formula with these approximate coordinates.

Compute S1 = x1 y2 + x2 y3 + x3 y4 + x4 y1

x1 y2 = 1.1 * 0.100 = 0.110

x2 y3 = (-0.457) * (-1.457) ≈ 0.457 * 1.457 ≈ 0.457 * 1 ≈ 0.457, more accurately: 0.457*1.457 ≈ 0.457*1.4=0.640, 0.457*0.057≈0.026, total ≈0.666

x3 y4 = (-1.1) * (-2.100) = 2.310

x4 y1 = 0.457 * (-0.543) ≈ -0.247

So, S1 ≈ 0.110 + 0.666 + 2.310 - 0.247 ≈ 0.110 + 0.666 = 0.776; 0.776 + 2.310 = 3.086; 3.086 - 0.247 ≈ 2.839

Compute S2 = y1 x2 + y2 x3 + y3 x4 + y4 x1

y1 x2 = (-0.543) * (-0.457) ≈ 0.543 * 0.457 ≈ 0.247

y2 x3 = 0.100 * (-1.1) ≈ -0.110

y3 x4 = (-1.457) * 0.457 ≈ -0.666

y4 x1 = (-2.100) * 1.1 ≈ -2.310

So, S2 ≈ 0.247 - 0.110 - 0.666 - 2.310 ≈ 0.247 - 0.110 = 0.137; 0.137 - 0.666 = -0.529; -0.529 - 2.310 ≈ -2.839

Then, |S1 - S2| = |2.839 - (-2.839)| = |5.678| ≈5.678

Then, area ≈ (1/2)*5.678 ≈2.839

But earlier, we found the area is \( 2 \sqrt{2} ≈2.828 \), which is very close to 2.839. So, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the area is indeed \( 2 \sqrt{2} \), which is \( 2^{3/2} \). So, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 2 \), \( p = 2 \), so \( a + b + p = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{7}
</think>

The given equation is \( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \). We recognize that this can be rewritten as \( (z + i)^4 = 2i \). The solutions to this equation are the fourth roots of \( 2i \) shifted by \( -i \).

The fourth roots of \( 2i \) are \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos \frac{\pi}{8} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{8} \right) \), \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos \frac{5\pi}{8} + i \sin \frac{5\pi}{8} \right) \), \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos \frac{9\pi}{8} + i \sin \frac{9\pi}{8} \right) \), and \( \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos \frac{13\pi}{8} + i \sin \frac{13\pi}{8} \right) \).

Subtracting \( i \) from each root, we get the solutions to the original equation. These solutions form a square rotated by 45 degrees, but each vertex is shifted down by 1 unit. The area of this square remains the same as the original square formed by the fourth roots of \( 2i \).

The area of the original square is \( 2 \sqrt{2} \). Thus, the area of the polygon formed by the solutions is \( 2 \sqrt{2} \), which can be expressed as \( 2^{3/2} \).

Therefore, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( p = 2 \). The sum \( a + b + p \) is \( 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 \).
