Question:
Let $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ be vectors such that the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is $29^\circ,$ and the angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $84^\circ.$  Find the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}.$

Correct Answer:
Since $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b},$ and $\mathbf{a-b}$ all lie in the same plane, from the diagram below, we see that the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $84^\circ - 29^\circ = \boxed{55^\circ}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this vector problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem says:

"Let $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ be vectors such that the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is $29^\circ,$ and the angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $84^\circ.$ Find the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}.$"

Okay, so I need to find the angle between vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$. Let me denote the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ as $\theta$. So, the goal is to find $\theta$.

Given are two angles:

1. The angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is $29^\circ$.
2. The angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $84^\circ$.

I need to find the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, which is $\theta$.

Hmm, perhaps I can use the dot product formula to relate these angles. Remember that the dot product of two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ is given by:

$\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = |\mathbf{u}| |\mathbf{v}| \cos \phi$

where $\phi$ is the angle between them.

So, maybe if I can express the dot products of these vectors in terms of their magnitudes and the given angles, I can set up equations and solve for $\theta$.

Let me denote some variables to make this easier.

Let’s let $|\mathbf{a}| = A$, $|\mathbf{b}| = B$, and $|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}| = C$.

Then, according to the problem:

1. The angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is $29^\circ$, so:

$\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = A B \cos 29^\circ$.

2. The angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $84^\circ$, so:

$\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = B C \cos 84^\circ$.

Let me compute the second dot product:

$\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} - |\mathbf{b}|^2$.

We already know $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = A B \cos 29^\circ$, and $|\mathbf{b}|^2 = B^2$. So,

$\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = A B \cos 29^\circ - B^2$.

But we also know that this is equal to $B C \cos 84^\circ$. So,

$A B \cos 29^\circ - B^2 = B C \cos 84^\circ$.

We can factor out a $B$ on both sides:

$B (A \cos 29^\circ - B) = B C \cos 84^\circ$.

Assuming $B \neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $B$:

$A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$.

Let me note this as equation (1):

$A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$.

Now, we need another equation to relate these variables. Perhaps we can find another relation involving these vectors.

We also need to find the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, which is $\theta$. Let's denote this angle as $\theta$, so:

$\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = A (A - \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a}) = A^2 - A \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a}$.

But wait, let's compute it step by step.

$\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = A^2 - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$.

We know that $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = A B \cos 29^\circ$, so:

$\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = A^2 - A B \cos 29^\circ$.

But this dot product is also equal to $A C \cos \theta$, because it's the dot product of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, which is $A$ times $C$ times the cosine of the angle $\theta$ between them. So:

$A^2 - A B \cos 29^\circ = A C \cos \theta$.

We can factor out an $A$:

$A (A - B \cos 29^\circ) = A C \cos \theta$.

Again, assuming $A \neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $A$:

$A - B \cos 29^\circ = C \cos \theta$.

Let me note this as equation (2):

$A - B \cos 29^\circ = C \cos \theta$.

So, now I have two equations:

1. $A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$ (Equation 1)
2. $A - B \cos 29^\circ = C \cos \theta$ (Equation 2)

I need to find $\theta$. So, perhaps I can express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $C$ or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between $A$ and $B$ first.

Let me think. If I can find $A$ and $B$ in terms of $C$, then I can substitute into equation (2) and find $\theta$.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate equations 1 and 2 by some manipulation.

Let me write equation 1:

$A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$.

Equation 2:

$A - B \cos 29^\circ = C \cos \theta$.

So, if I can get another equation, maybe involving $A$ and $B$, that would help.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the triangle formed by vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$. Maybe I can use the law of cosines or something.

Wait, but in this case, the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is 29°, and the angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is 84°, and I need the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$.

Hmm, actually, perhaps I can consider the triangle formed by vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$. Wait, let me draw this mentally.

Imagine vector $\mathbf{a}$ and vector $\mathbf{b}$ with an angle of 29° between them. Then, vector $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ would be the vector from the head of $\mathbf{b}$ to the head of $\mathbf{a}$, if you think of them as position vectors.

But maybe I can create a triangle with sides $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$.

Wait, but $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is equal to $-\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a}$, so perhaps it's a side in a triangle.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the triangle with sides $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$. But that might not form a triangle unless arranged properly.

Wait, actually, if I consider vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, they can form a triangle if they are connected tip-to-tail.

Let me think: if I have vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and then $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, which is $\mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{b})$, so perhaps the vectors form a triangle with sides $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$.

But actually, in vector terms, if I have vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, then these vectors can form a triangle if I arrange it appropriately. Hmm, perhaps this is getting a bit abstract.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ as $\mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{b})$, and then the triangle would be formed by the vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and their difference.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the parallelogram law here. But given the angles, maybe it's a triangle.

Wait, actually, no. Let me think: if I have vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, the lengths of these vectors can be related. But perhaps I need to use the law of cosines on the triangle formed by these vectors.

Wait, perhaps the triangle sides are $|\mathbf{a}|$, $|\mathbf{b}|$, and $|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|$, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the law of cosines on the triangle formed by the vectors.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a triangle with sides $|\mathbf{a}|$, $|\mathbf{b}|$, and $|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|$, and the angles between them.

But I think I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of thinking geometrically, I can just work with the equations I have.

From equation (1):

$A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$.

From equation (2):

$A - B \cos 29^\circ = C \cos \theta$.

I need to find $\theta$.

So, if I can express $A$, $B$, and $C$ in terms of each other, perhaps I can solve for $\theta$.

Let me denote:

Equation (1): $A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$.

Equation (2): $A - B \cos 29^\circ = C \cos \theta$.

I can write these as:

Equation (1): $A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$.

Equation (2): $A - B \cos 29^\circ = C \cos \theta$.

Let me denote equation (1) as Eq1 and equation (2) as Eq2.

So, if I can write Eq1 and Eq2, perhaps I can eliminate $C$.

Let me try to express $C$ from Eq1 and substitute into Eq2.

From Eq1: $C = \frac{A \cos 29^\circ - B}{\cos 84^\circ}$.

Substituting into Eq2:

$A - B \cos 29^\circ = \left( \frac{A \cos 29^\circ - B}{\cos 84^\circ} \right) \cos \theta$.

So,

$A - B \cos 29^\circ = \frac{(A \cos 29^\circ - B) \cos \theta}{\cos 84^\circ}$.

Multiply both sides by $\cos 84^\circ$:

$(A - B \cos 29^\circ) \cos 84^\circ = (A \cos 29^\circ - B) \cos \theta$.

Let me denote this as Eq3:

$(A - B \cos 29^\circ) \cos 84^\circ = (A \cos 29^\circ - B) \cos \theta$.

Hmm, now, I can perhaps relate this to another expression involving $A$ and $B$.

Wait, another idea: maybe I can relate $A$ and $B$ via the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. We know that:

$\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = A B \cos 29^\circ$.

But perhaps I can express $A$ or $B$ in terms of the other.

Wait, is there another equation that relates $A$ and $B$? Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the triangle formed by vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ as sides. Wait, but without knowing the angles of that triangle, it's hard to relate $A$ and $B$.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can consider the triangle formed by vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, but I think this might not directly correspond to the triangle sides.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $\theta$, which is related to $A$, $B$, and $C$.

Wait, but I already used that in equation (2).

Wait, let me think if I can express $A$ in terms of $B$ or vice versa.

Wait, from equation (1):

$A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$.

From equation (2):

$A - B \cos 29^\circ = C \cos \theta$.

So, if I can write $C$ in terms of $A$ and $B$, then I can substitute into equation (2).

From equation (1):

$C = \frac{A \cos 29^\circ - B}{\cos 84^\circ}$.

Substituting into equation (2):

$A - B \cos 29^\circ = \frac{(A \cos 29^\circ - B) \cos \theta}{\cos 84^\circ}$.

So, let me rearrange this equation:

Multiply both sides by $\cos 84^\circ$:

$(A - B \cos 29^\circ) \cos 84^\circ = (A \cos 29^\circ - B) \cos \theta$.

Let me write this as:

$A \cos 84^\circ - B \cos 29^\circ \cos 84^\circ = A \cos 29^\circ \cos \theta - B \cos \theta$.

Now, let's collect like terms:

Bring all terms involving $A$ to the left and all terms involving $B$ to the right:

$A \cos 84^\circ - A \cos 29^\circ \cos \theta = B \cos 29^\circ \cos 84^\circ - B \cos \theta$.

Factor out $A$ and $B$:

$A (\cos 84^\circ - \cos 29^\circ \cos \theta) = B (\cos 29^\circ \cos 84^\circ - \cos \theta)$.

Hmm, so now we have:

$A (\cos 84^\circ - \cos 29^\circ \cos \theta) = B (\cos 29^\circ \cos 84^\circ - \cos \theta)$.

Let me denote this as Equation (4).

Now, from equation (1):

$C = \frac{A \cos 29^\circ - B}{\cos 84^\circ}$.

But since I don't know $C$, maybe I can find another relation. Alternatively, perhaps I can express $A$ in terms of $B$ or vice versa.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can consider the triangle formed by vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$. Maybe the cosine law can be applied here.

The cosine law states that for any triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$, the following holds:

$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C$,

where $C$ is the angle opposite side $c$.

In this case, if I consider the triangle with sides $A$, $B$, and $C$, but I'm not sure about the angles. Alternatively, perhaps the triangle formed by vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ can be considered.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ as $\theta$, so in the triangle formed by $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $\theta$, and the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is 29°, and the angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is 84°.

Wait, perhaps I can apply the cosine law to this triangle to relate $A$, $B$, and $C$.

Wait, so in the triangle, the sides opposite the angles are as follows:

- The side opposite angle 29° is $|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}| = C$.
- The side opposite angle 84° is $|\mathbf{b}| = B$.
- The side opposite angle $\theta$ is $|\mathbf{a}| = A$.

Wait, is that correct? Wait, in the triangle, each side is opposite the angle at the opposite vertex. So, if I have a triangle with vertices at vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, then the angle at vertex $\mathbf{a}$ would be the angle between $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a}$, which is 84°. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps this is overcomplicating. Let me instead think of the triangle formed by vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, as a triangle where the sides are $A$, $B$, and $C = |\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|$. Then, the angles between these vectors can be related to the triangle's angles.

Wait, perhaps using the law of cosines on the triangle.

Wait, but in the triangle, the angle opposite side $C$ (which is $|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|$) would be the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$, which is 29°. Similarly, the angle opposite side $B$ (which is $|\mathbf{b}|$) would be the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, which is $\theta$, and the angle opposite side $A$ (which is $|\mathbf{a}|$) would be the angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, which is 84°. Wait, that seems correct.

Wait, so in triangle terms:

- The side opposite angle 29° is $C = |\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|$.
- The side opposite angle $\theta$ is $B = |\mathbf{b}|$.
- The side opposite angle 84° is $A = |\mathbf{a}|$.

So, according to the law of cosines:

$C^2 = A^2 + B^2 - 2AB \cos 29^\circ$.

Wait, but that seems to contradict because:

Wait, in the law of cosines, for a triangle with sides $a$, $b$, $c$, opposite angles $A$, $B$, $C$ respectively,

$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C$.

So, in our case, if side $C$ is opposite angle 29°, then:

$C^2 = A^2 + B^2 - 2AB \cos 29^\circ$.

But from equation (1), we have $A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$, so $C = (A \cos 29^\circ - B)/\cos 84^\circ$.

Substituting this into the law of cosines equation:

$[ (A \cos 29^\circ - B)/\cos 84^\circ ]^2 = A^2 + B^2 - 2AB \cos 29^\circ$.

Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe I can expand and solve for a relationship between $A$ and $B$.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of trying to apply the law of cosines directly, I can find another equation involving $A$ and $B$.

Wait, let me think. I have two equations:

1. $A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$.
2. $A - B \cos 29^\circ = C \cos \theta$.

And from the law of cosines, I have:

$C^2 = A^2 + B^2 - 2AB \cos 29^\circ$.

So, perhaps I can express $C$ from equation (1) and substitute into the law of cosines.

So, from equation (1):

$C = \frac{A \cos 29^\circ - B}{\cos 84^\circ}$.

Let me denote this as $C = \frac{A \cos 29^\circ - B}{\cos 84^\circ}$.

Then, substituting into the law of cosines:

$\left( \frac{A \cos 29^\circ - B}{\cos 84^\circ} \right)^2 = A^2 + B^2 - 2AB \cos 29^\circ$.

Expanding the left side:

$\frac{(A \cos 29^\circ - B)^2}{\cos^2 84^\circ} = A^2 + B^2 - 2AB \cos 29^\circ$.

Multiply both sides by $\cos^2 84^\circ$ to eliminate the denominator:

$(A \cos 29^\circ - B)^2 = (A^2 + B^2 - 2AB \cos 29^\circ) \cos^2 84^\circ$.

Let me expand the left side:

$A^2 \cos^2 29^\circ - 2AB \cos 29^\circ + B^2 = (A^2 + B^2 - 2AB \cos 29^\circ) \cos^2 84^\circ$.

Now, let me bring all terms to one side:

$A^2 \cos^2 29^\circ - 2AB \cos 29^\circ + B^2 - (A^2 + B^2 - 2AB \cos 29^\circ) \cos^2 84^\circ = 0$.

Factor out $A^2$, $B^2$, and $AB$ terms:

$A^2 (\cos^2 29^\circ - \cos^2 84^\circ) + B^2 (1 - \cos^2 84^\circ) + AB (-2 \cos 29^\circ + 2 \cos 29^\circ \cos^2 84^\circ) = 0$.

Simplify each term:

First term: $A^2 (\cos^2 29^\circ - \cos^2 84^\circ)$.

Second term: $B^2 (1 - \cos^2 84^\circ) = B^2 \sin^2 84^\circ$.

Third term: $AB (-2 \cos 29^\circ + 2 \cos 29^\circ \cos^2 84^\circ)$.

Factor out 2 cos29°:

$AB [ -2 \cos 29^\circ (1 - \cos^2 84^\circ) ]$.

So, putting it all together:

$A^2 (\cos^2 29^\circ - \cos^2 84^\circ) + B^2 \sin^2 84^\circ - 2 AB \cos 29^\circ (1 - \cos^2 84^\circ) = 0$.

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps we can factor this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to simplify. Let me denote $x = A/B$, so $A = x B$. Then, we can express everything in terms of $x$.

Let me try that.

Let $x = A/B$, so $A = x B$.

Substituting into the equation:

$(x B)^2 (\cos^2 29^\circ - \cos^2 84^\circ) + B^2 \sin^2 84^\circ - 2 (x B) B \cos 29^\circ (1 - \cos^2 84^\circ) = 0$.

Factor out $B^2$:

$B^2 [ x^2 (\cos^2 29^\circ - \cos^2 84^\circ) + \sin^2 84^\circ - 2 x \cos 29^\circ (1 - \cos^2 84^\circ) ] = 0$.

Since $B \neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $B^2$:

$x^2 (\cos^2 29^\circ - \cos^2 84^\circ) + \sin^2 84^\circ - 2 x \cos 29^\circ (1 - \cos^2 84^\circ) = 0$.

Let me compute each term:

First, compute $\cos^2 29^\circ - \cos^2 84^\circ$.

Using identity: $\cos^2 A - \cos^2 B = -(\sin^2 A - \sin^2 B) = -(\sin A \sin B)(\sin A + \sin B)$.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the values numerically.

But perhaps I can compute it symbolically.

Wait, alternatively, let me note that $\cos 84^\circ = \sin 6^\circ$, since $\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x$.

Similarly, $\cos 29^\circ$ is just $\cos 29^\circ$.

But maybe it's better to compute numerically.

Let me compute each term:

First, compute $\cos 29^\circ$ and $\cos 84^\circ$:

$\cos 29^\circ \approx 0.8746$.

$\cos 84^\circ \approx 0.1045$.

Compute $\cos^2 29^\circ \approx (0.8746)^2 ≈ 0.7650$.

Compute $\cos^2 84^\circ ≈ (0.1045)^2 ≈ 0.0109$.

Thus, $\cos^2 29^\circ - \cos^2 84^\circ ≈ 0.7650 - 0.0109 ≈ 0.7541$.

Next, compute $\sin^2 84^\circ ≈ (0.9945)^2 ≈ 0.9890$.

Then, compute $1 - \cos^2 84^\circ ≈ 1 - 0.0109 ≈ 0.9891$.

Now, substitute into the equation:

$x^2 (0.7541) + (0.9890) - 2 x (0.8746) (0.9891) = 0$.

Simplify each term:

First term: $0.7541 x^2$.

Second term: $0.9890$.

Third term: $2 * 0.8746 * 0.9891 ≈ 2 * 0.8746 * 0.9891 ≈ 2 * 0.866 ≈ 1.732$.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

$2 * 0.8746 ≈ 1.7492$.

$1.7492 * 0.9891 ≈ 1.7492 * 0.9891 ≈ approx 1.7492 * 1 = 1.7492; 1.7492 - 1.7492*0.0109 ≈ 1.7492 - 0.0189 ≈ 1.7303$.

So, the third term is approximately $1.7303 x$.

Putting it all together:

$0.7541 x^2 + 0.9890 - 1.7303 x = 0$.

So, the equation is:

$0.7541 x^2 - 1.7303 x + 0.9890 = 0$.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$.

Let me write it as:

$0.7541 x^2 - 1.7303 x + 0.9890 = 0$.

Let me solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.

The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 0.7541$, $b = -1.7303$, and $c = 0.9890$.

Compute discriminant $D = b^2 - 4ac$.

So, $D = (-1.7303)^2 - 4 * 0.7541 * 0.9890$.

Compute each term:

$(-1.7303)^2 ≈ 2.993$.

$4 * 0.7541 * 0.9890 ≈ 4 * 0.7541 ≈ 3.0164; 3.0164 * 0.9890 ≈ 3.0164 - 3.0164*0.011 ≈ 3.0164 - 0.0332 ≈ 2.9832$.

So, $D ≈ 2.993 - 2.9832 ≈ 0.0098$.

That's a very small discriminant, indicating that there are two real roots very close to each other.

So, $x = \frac{1.7303 \pm \sqrt{0.0098}}{2 * 0.7541}$.

Compute $\sqrt{0.0098} ≈ 0.09899$.

Thus,

$x ≈ \frac{1.7303 \pm 0.09899}{1.5082}$.

Compute both roots:

First root: $(1.7303 + 0.09899)/1.5082 ≈ (1.8293)/1.5082 ≈ 1.2133$.

Second root: $(1.7303 - 0.09899)/1.5082 ≈ (1.6313)/1.5082 ≈ 1.0815$.

So, we have two possible solutions for $x = A/B$:

1. $x ≈ 1.2133$.
2. $x ≈ 1.0815$.

So, there are two possible ratios of $A$ to $B$.

Now, let me check which one makes sense.

Given that in the problem, the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is 29°, and the angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is 84°, so perhaps both solutions are possible, depending on the relative lengths of $A$ and $B$.

But let me check if both lead to valid angles.

Alternatively, perhaps I can check if the angle $\theta$ is the same in both cases, but I suspect it would be different.

Wait, but the problem statement doesn't specify whether $\mathbf{a}$ is longer or shorter than $\mathbf{b}$, so both solutions might be possible, but the problem is expecting a specific answer, so perhaps I made a mistake in my computations.

Wait, let me re-examine the law of cosines approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when expanding the law of cosines equation.

Wait, let me re-examine the expansion step.

We had:

$[ (A \cos 29^\circ - B)/\cos 84^\circ ]^2 = A^2 + B^2 - 2AB \cos 29^\circ$.

Expanding the left side:

$(A \cos 29^\circ - B)^2 / \cos^2 84^\circ = A^2 + B^2 - 2AB \cos 29^\circ$.

Which is correct.

Then, multiplying both sides by $\cos^2 84^\circ$:

$(A \cos 29^\circ - B)^2 = (A^2 + B^2 - 2AB \cos 29^\circ) \cos^2 84^\circ$.

Expanding left side:

$A^2 \cos^2 29^\circ - 2AB \cos 29^\circ + B^2 = ...$.

Right side:

$A^2 \cos^2 84^\circ + B^2 \cos^2 84^\circ - 2AB \cos 29^\circ \cos^2 84^\circ$.

So, bringing all terms to the left:

$A^2 \cos^2 29^\circ - 2AB \cos 29^\circ + B^2 - A^2 \cos^2 84^\circ - B^2 \cos^2 84^\circ + 2AB \cos 29^\circ \cos^2 84^\circ = 0$.

Factor terms:

$A^2 (\cos^2 29^\circ - \cos^2 84^\circ) + B^2 (1 - \cos^2 84^\circ) + AB(-2 \cos 29^\circ + 2 \cos 29^\circ \cos^2 84^\circ) = 0$.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, substituting $\cos 84^\circ = \sin 6^\circ$ and computing numerically:

As I did earlier, which gave me x ≈ 1.2133 and x ≈ 1.0815.

But perhaps both solutions are valid, leading to two possible angles for $\theta$.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I can instead solve for $\theta$ using the two possible values of $x = A/B$ and see if either leads to a valid angle.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find $\theta$ using a different approach, without going through the quadratic.

Wait, perhaps I can use the law of sines.

Wait, in the triangle formed by $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, the sides are $A$, $B$, and $C = |\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|$, and the angles opposite are 29°, $\theta$, and 84°, respectively.

So, by the law of sines:

$\frac{A}{\sin 84^\circ} = \frac{B}{\sin \theta} = \frac{C}{\sin 29^\circ}$.

So, $\frac{A}{\sin 84^\circ} = \frac{B}{\sin \theta} = \frac{C}{\sin 29^\circ}$.

Let me denote this common ratio as $k$.

So,

$A = k \sin 84^\circ$,

$B = k \sin \theta$,

$C = k \sin 29^\circ$.

Now, from equation (1):

$A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$.

Substituting:

$k \sin 84^\circ \cos 29^\circ - k \sin \theta = k \sin 29^\circ \cos 84^\circ$.

Divide both sides by $k$:

$\sin 84^\circ \cos 29^\circ - \sin \theta = \sin 29^\circ \cos 84^\circ$.

Rearranged:

$\sin 84^\circ \cos 29^\circ - \sin 29^\circ \cos 84^\circ = \sin \theta$.

Notice that the left side resembles the sine of a difference:

$\sin (84^\circ - 29^\circ) = \sin 55^\circ$.

Because $\sin (A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B$.

Wait, yes, exactly:

$\sin (84^\circ - 29^\circ) = \sin 84^\circ \cos 29^\circ - \cos 84^\circ \sin 29^\circ = \sin 55^\circ$.

Wait, but in the equation, we have $\sin 84^\circ \cos 29^\circ - \sin 29^\circ \cos 84^\circ$.

Which is equal to $\sin (84^\circ - 29^\circ) = \sin 55^\circ$.

So, therefore,

$\sin \theta = \sin 55^\circ$.

Which implies that $\theta = 55^\circ$ or $\theta = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ$.

But, since $\theta$ is the angle between vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, and considering the configuration, it's likely that $\theta$ is acute, so $\theta = 55^\circ$.

Wait, but I need to confirm if this is consistent with the other given angle of 84° between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$.

Wait, perhaps so because if $\theta$ is 55°, then it's a valid angle in the triangle, and it would correspond to the angle opposite side $A$.

Wait, but let me verify this with the earlier equations.

Wait, if $\sin \theta = \sin 55^\circ$, then $\theta$ is either 55° or 125°, as I thought.

But let me check which one fits with the given angle of 84° between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$.

Since the triangle has angles 29°, 55°, and 180 - 29 - 55 = 96°, which is not 84°, which is given.

Alternatively, if $\theta = 125°$, then the angles would be 29°, 125°, and 180 - 29 - 125 = 26°, which also doesn't match the given 84°.

Wait, that's a problem. So, perhaps my assumption that $\theta$ is 55° is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step where I equated $\sin \theta = \sin 55^\circ$.

Wait, let me re-examine that step.

From the law of sines:

$\sin \theta = \sin 55^\circ$.

So, $\theta$ can be 55° or 180° - 55° = 125°.

But when I think about the triangle, the given angles are 29°, 84°, and thus the third angle is 180 - 29 - 84 = 67°.

But according to the law of sines, in the triangle, the angle opposite side $A$ is 84°, which is the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, which is our $\theta$.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I got the sides wrong.

Wait, in the triangle, the sides are:

- Opposite angle 29°: side $B = |\mathbf{b}|$.
- Opposite angle 84°: side $A = |\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|$.
- Opposite angle $\theta$: side $C = |\mathbf{a}|$.

So, the angle $\theta$ is opposite side $C = A$.

Wait, so according to the law of sines:

$\frac{A}{\sin 84^\circ} = \frac{B}{\sin \theta} = \frac{C}{\sin 29^\circ}$.

So, from here, $\sin \theta = \frac{B \sin 84^\circ}{A}$.

But from equation (1), we have $A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$.

So, $C = \frac{A \cos 29^\circ - B}{\cos 84^\circ}$.

Substituting into the expression for $\sin \theta$:

$\sin \theta = \frac{B \sin 84^\circ}{A}$.

But from equation (1), $A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$, so rearranged:

$B = A \cos 29^\circ - C \cos 84^\circ$.

Substituting into $\sin \theta$:

$\sin \theta = \frac{(A \cos 29^\circ - C \cos 84^\circ) \sin 84^\circ}{A}$.

Simplify:

$\sin \theta = \cos 29^\circ \sin 84^\circ - C \cos 84^\circ \sin 84^\circ / A$.

But $C = (A \cos 29^\circ - B)/\cos 84^\circ$, so substituting back:

$\sin \theta = \cos 29^\circ \sin 84^\circ - [(A \cos 29^\circ - B)/\cos 84^\circ] \cos 84^\circ \sin 84^\circ / A$.

Simplify:

$\sin \theta = \cos 29^\circ \sin 84^\circ - (A \cos 29^\circ - B) \sin 84^\circ / A$.

Which becomes:

$\sin \theta = \cos 29^\circ \sin 84^\circ - \sin 84^\circ + (B \sin 84^\circ)/A$.

Simplify:

$\sin \theta = \sin 84^\circ (\cos 29^\circ - 1) + (B \sin 84^\circ)/A$.

Hmm, this seems a bit messy, but perhaps I can compute the numerical value.

Let me compute each term:

First, compute $\cos 29^\circ ≈ 0.8746$.

So, $\cos 29^\circ - 1 ≈ 0.8746 - 1 = -0.1254$.

Then, $\sin 84^\circ ≈ 0.9945$.

So, $\sin 84^\circ (\cos 29^\circ - 1) ≈ 0.9945 * (-0.1254) ≈ -0.1247$.

Next, compute $B/A$.

From equation (1):

$A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$.

But $C = (A \cos 29^\circ - B)/\cos 84^\circ$.

So, substituting back into equation (2):

$A - B \cos 29^\circ = (A \cos 29^\circ - B) \cos \theta$.

Wait, perhaps I can find $B/A$ using equation (1) and the expression for $C$.

Wait, perhaps I can write $B = A \cos 29^\circ - C \cos 84^\circ$.

But from equation (2), $A - B \cos 29^\circ = C \cos \theta$.

Substituting $B$ from equation (1) into equation (2):

$A - (A \cos 29^\circ - C \cos 84^\circ) \cos 29^\circ = C \cos \theta$.

Expanding:

$A - A \cos^2 29^\circ + C \cos 84^\circ \cos 29^\circ = C \cos \theta$.

Rearranged:

$A (1 - \cos^2 29^\circ) + C \cos 84^\circ \cos 29^\circ = C \cos \theta$.

Factor $C$:

$A \sin^2 29^\circ + C \cos 84^\circ \cos 29^\circ = C \cos \theta$.

Divide both sides by $C$:

$A \sin^2 29^\circ / C + \cos 84^\circ \cos 29^\circ = \cos \theta$.

But from equation (1), $C = (A \cos 29^\circ - B)/\cos 84^\circ$, so $A \sin^2 29^\circ / C = A \sin^2 29^\circ / [(A \cos 29^\circ - B)/\cos 84^\circ]$.

Which is $A \sin^2 29^\circ \cos 84^\circ / (A \cos 29^\circ - B)$.

Hmm, this seems getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to use the fact that from the law of sines, $\sin \theta = \sin 55^\circ$ and $\sin \theta = \sin 125^\circ$.

But in the triangle, the third angle is 67°, as I computed earlier, so perhaps neither 55° nor 125° is the correct angle for $\theta$, which suggests that my initial assumption might be wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier approach using the law of sines.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the law of sines. Let me try again.

In the triangle, the three angles are:

- Between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$: 29°, opposite side $B$.
- Between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$: 84°, opposite side $A$.
- Between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$: $\theta$, opposite side $C = |\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|$.

So, according to the law of sines:

$\frac{A}{\sin 84^\circ} = \frac{B}{\sin \theta} = \frac{C}{\sin 29^\circ}$.

Therefore, $\frac{A}{\sin 84^\circ} = \frac{B}{\sin \theta} = \frac{C}{\sin 29^\circ}$.

So, from this, we can write:

$A = \frac{\sin 84^\circ}{\sin 29^\circ} B$,

$B = \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin 29^\circ} C$,

$C = \frac{\sin 29^\circ}{\sin 29^\circ} A$.

Wait, but $C = A$, so $C = A$, so $C = \frac{\sin 29^\circ}{\sin 29^\circ} A = A$, which means $C = A$, which is correct.

So, from $A = \frac{\sin 84^\circ}{\sin 29^\circ} B$, and $B = \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin 29^\circ} C$, and since $C = A$, then:

$B = \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin 29^\circ} A$,

But $A = \frac{\sin 84^\circ}{\sin 29^\circ} B$,

Substituting into the equation for $B$:

$B = \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin 29^\circ} * \frac{\sin 84^\circ}{\sin 29^\circ} B$,

Simplify:

$B = \frac{\sin \theta \sin 84^\circ}{\sin^2 29^\circ} B$.

Divide both sides by $B$:

$1 = \frac{\sin \theta \sin 84^\circ}{\sin^2 29^\circ}$,

Thus,

$\sin \theta = \frac{\sin^2 29^\circ}{\sin 84^\circ}$.

Compute the values:

$\sin 29^\circ ≈ 0.4848$,

$\sin 84^\circ ≈ 0.9952$,

So,

$\sin \theta ≈ (0.4848)^2 / 0.9952 ≈ 0.2351 / 0.9952 ≈ 0.236$.

So, $\theta ≈ \arcsin(0.236) ≈ 13.6^\circ$.

Wait, but this contradicts the earlier result from the law of sines, which suggested $\theta$ could be 55° or 125°, but that approach led to an inconsistency with the given angles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that approach. Let me check again.

Wait, using the law of sines:

$\frac{A}{\sin 84^\circ} = \frac{B}{\sin \theta} = \frac{C}{\sin 29^\circ}$.

Thus,

$\frac{A}{\sin 84^\circ} = \frac{B}{\sin \theta}$,

so,

$\frac{B}{A} = \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin 84^\circ}$.

But from the first equation, $A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$,

and from the third equation, $C = A$, so:

$A \cos 29^\circ - B = A \cos 84^\circ$.

Rearranged,

$B = A \cos 29^\circ - A \cos 84^\circ = A (\cos 29^\circ - \cos 84^\circ)$.

Thus,

$\frac{B}{A} = \cos 29^\circ - \cos 84^\circ ≈ 0.8746 - 0.1045 ≈ 0.7701$.

Therefore,

$\frac{B}{A} = 0.7701 = \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin 84^\circ}$.

Thus,

$\sin \theta = 0.7701 * \sin 84^\circ ≈ 0.7701 * 0.9952 ≈ 0.7701 * 0.9952 ≈ 0.766$.

Thus,

$\theta ≈ \arcsin(0.766) ≈ 50^\circ$.

Wait, that's different from the earlier result. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the previous step.

Wait, let me compute $\sin 84^\circ ≈ 0.9945$, so $\sin \theta = 0.7701 * 0.9945 ≈ 0.766$.

$\arcsin(0.766) ≈ 50^\circ$, since $\sin 50^\circ ≈ 0.766$.

So, $\theta ≈ 50^\circ$.

Wait, that makes more sense because earlier, the angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is 84°, which is quite large, so the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ would be smaller than 84°, perhaps around 50°, which is consistent with the calculation.

So, perhaps the correct value is $\theta ≈ 50^\circ$.

Wait, let me check with the quadratic solution earlier, where I got two possible solutions: 1. $x ≈ 1.2133$, leading to $A/B ≈ 1.2133$, and 2. $x ≈ 1.0815$, leading to $A/B ≈ 1.0815$.

But according to the law of sines approach, we have $\sin \theta ≈ 0.766$, so $\theta ≈ 50^\circ$.

Wait, but how does this relate to the quadratic solution?

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic approach.

Wait, let me go back to the quadratic equation:

$0.7541 x^2 - 1.7303 x + 0.9890 = 0$.

With $x = A/B$.

We found $x ≈ 1.2133$ and $x ≈ 1.0815$.

Wait, if $\theta ≈ 50^\circ$, then $\sin \theta ≈ 0.766$, which would correspond to $\theta ≈ 50^\circ$.

But according to the quadratic solution, we have two possible values for $x = A/B$, which are approximately 1.2133 and 1.0815.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate $x$ to $\theta$ using $\sin \theta = \sin 55^\circ ≈ 0.8192$, which is a larger value than 0.766, so perhaps that's inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic setup.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can compute $\theta$ using the two possible $x$ values.

If $\theta ≈ 50^\circ$, then $\sin \theta ≈ 0.766$.

From the equation $\sin 84^\circ \cos 29^\circ - \sin 29^\circ \cos 84^\circ = \sin 55^\circ$.

Wait, but earlier we saw that $\sin 84^\circ \cos 29^\circ - \sin 29^\circ \cos 84^\circ = \sin 55^\circ$.

Yes, that's correct, because $\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B$.

So, indeed, $\sin 84^\circ \cos 29^\circ - \sin 29^\circ \cos 84^\circ = \sin(84 - 29)^\circ = \sin 55^\circ$.

Thus, $\sin \theta = \sin 55^\circ$.

Therefore, $\theta = 55^\circ$ or $\theta = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ$.

But since $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, and considering the given angles in the problem, perhaps $\theta$ is 55°, which is less than 84°, which makes sense.

Wait, but then earlier from the law of sines, I got $\theta ≈ 50^\circ$, which is different.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in that approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better to accept that $\theta$ could be either 55° or 125°, but in the context of the problem, perhaps 55° is the correct answer, and the other solution is extraneous.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the law of sines approach, because when I set up the triangle, the angle opposite side $A$ is 84°, which is the angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$, which is our $\theta$, so maybe it's correct that $\theta = 55^\circ$.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute $\sin 55^\circ ≈ 0.8192$.

From the law of sines approach, $\sin \theta = (B \sin 84^\circ) / A$, and from equation (1), $B = A (\cos 29^\circ - \cos 84^\circ)$.

Thus, $\sin \theta = (A (\cos 29^\circ - \cos 84^\circ) \sin 84^\circ) / A = (\cos 29^\circ - \cos 84^\circ) \sin 84^\circ$.

Which is exactly what we had earlier, leading to $\sin \theta = \sin 55^\circ ≈ 0.8192$.

So, that would suggest that $\theta = 55^\circ$, because $\sin 55^\circ ≈ 0.8192$.

Therefore, the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is 55°, which is consistent with the quadratic solution approach.

Wait, but earlier, when I considered the angle $\theta$ in the triangle, I thought it was 50°, but that was due to a miscalculation.

So, the correct answer should be $\theta = 55^\circ$.

Wait, but let me check with the quadratic solution.

If $x = A/B = \cos 29^\circ / \sin 84^\circ ≈ 0.8746 / 0.9952 ≈ 0.8783$, then $\theta = \arcsin(0.8192) ≈ 55^\circ$.

Wait, perhaps I should compute $\cos 29^\circ / \sin 84^\circ$ more accurately.

$\cos 29° ≈ 0.8746197$,

$\sin 84° ≈ 0.9951849$,

So, $0.8746197 / 0.9951849 ≈ 0.8783$.

Then, $\arcsin(0.8783) ≈ 61^\circ$, but wait, $\arcsin(0.8783)$ is approximately 61°, not 55°.

Wait, that contradicts the earlier result. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, from the law of sines, we have $\sin \theta = \sin 55^\circ ≈ 0.8192$.

So, $\theta = 55^\circ$.

Alternatively, perhaps the two solutions from the quadratic are due to the ambiguity in the sine function and should be discarded because they lead to inconsistent angles.

Wait, but given that the problem states that the angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is 84°, and the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is 55°, which adds up to 139°, and the remaining angle in the triangle is 61°, which seems plausible.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct answer is 55°, so I'll go with that.

Wait, but in the quadratic solution, with $x ≈ 1.0815$, I get $A/B ≈ 1.0815$, which would imply that $A ≈ 1.0815 B$.

Then, using the law of sines, $\sin \theta = \sin 55^\circ ≈ 0.8192$, which would correspond to $\theta ≈ 55^\circ$, which is consistent.

Thus, I think the correct angle is 55°, so $\boxed{55^\circ}$.

Wait, but let me check with the quadratic solution.

If $x ≈ 1.0815$, then:

$\sin \theta = \frac{\sin \theta = \sin 55^\circ ≈ 0.8192$.

From equation (1):

$\sin \theta = \frac{\sin^2 29^\circ}{\sin 84^\circ}$.

Wait, but $\sin^2 29^\circ ≈ 0.766^2 ≈ 0.5868$,

$\sin 84^\circ ≈ 0.9952$,

So, $\sin \theta ≈ 0.5868 / 0.9952 ≈ 0.590$,

Which is not equal to $\sin 55^\circ ≈ 0.8192$.

Therefore, that solution doesn't satisfy the condition, so perhaps the correct solution is $x ≈ 1.2133$, leading to $\sin \theta ≈ 0.766$, which is approximately 50°, as earlier.

Wait, but that contradicts the law of sines approach, which gives $\theta ≈ 55°$. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the law of sines approach.

Wait, let me re-express $\sin \theta = \frac{\sin^2 29^\circ}{\sin 84^\circ}$.

Compute this accurately:

$\sin 29^\circ ≈ 0.484809665$,

$\sin^2 29^\circ ≈ 0.484809665^2 ≈ 0.2351$,

$\sin 84^\circ ≈ 0.9951849$,

So,

$\sin \theta = 0.2351 / 0.9951849 ≈ 0.236$,

Which is approximately 13.57°, not 55°.

Wait, that's different.

Wait, so which one is correct? Is $\theta$ 55°, or 13.57°?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the law of sines approach.

Wait, going back to the triangle, the angle opposite side $C$ (which is $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$) is 84°, so that angle is $\theta$.

Wait, but in the triangle, the sides are $A$, $B$, and $C$, with opposite angles 84°, 29°, and $\theta$.

Thus, from the law of sines,

$\frac{A}{\sin 84^\circ} = \frac{B}{\sin \theta} = \frac{C}{\sin 29^\circ}$.

Thus,

$\frac{A}{\sin 84^\circ} = \frac{B}{\sin \theta}$,

so,

$\frac{B}{A} = \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin 84^\circ}$.

From equation (1):

$A \cos 29^\circ - B = C \cos 84^\circ$,

and since $C = A$, we have:

$A \cos 29^\circ - B = A \cos 84^\circ$,

so,

$B = A \cos 29^\circ - A \cos 84^\circ = A (\cos 29^\circ - \cos 84^\circ)$.

Thus,

$\frac{B}{A} = \cos 29^\circ - \cos 84^\circ ≈ 0.8746 - 0.1045 ≈ 0.7701$.

Therefore,

$\frac{\sin \theta}{\sin 84^\circ} = 0.7701$,

so,

$\sin \theta = 0.7701 \times \sin 84^\circ ≈ 0.7701 \times 0.9952 ≈ 0.766$,

which gives $\theta ≈ 50^\circ$.

Wait, so that's about 50°, which is different from the 55° we had earlier.

But according to the quadratic solution, $x ≈ 1.2133$ gives $\sin \theta ≈ 0.766$, which is about 50°, which is consistent with the law of sines approach.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier in the law of sines approach, thinking that $\sin \theta = \sin 55^\circ$, but in reality, based on the law of sines, $\sin \theta ≈ 0.766$, which is approximately 50°.

Thus, the correct angle is approximately 50°, which is $\theta ≈ 50^\circ$.

Wait, but let me check with the quadratic solution.

From the quadratic equation, I got $x ≈ 1.2133$, which gives $\sin \theta ≈ 0.766$, so $\theta ≈ 50^\circ$.

Thus, the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is approximately 50°, which is the correct answer.

Therefore, after going through the problem, I conclude that $\angle a\mathbf{b}$ is approximately 50°, so the answer is $\boxed{50^\circ}$.

**Final Answer**
The angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $\boxed{50^\circ}$.
</think>

Given vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) such that the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(29^\circ\), and the angle between \(\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is \(84^\circ\), we need to find the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\).

   - \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = |\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{b}| \cos 29^\circ\).
   - \(\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = |\mathbf{b}| |\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}| \cos 84^\circ\).

2. **Using the law of cosines in the triangle formed by vectors \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\):**
   - The sides of the triangle are \(|\mathbf{a}|\), \(|\mathbf{b}|\), and \(|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|\).
   - Using the law of cosines, we relate the sides and angles.

3. **Setting up the equations:**
   - From the dot product, we have:
     \[
     \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = C \cos 84^\circ
     \]
     where \(C = |\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|\).
   - From the angle between \(\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\):
     \[
     \mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = B \cos 84^\circ
     \]

4. **Solving for the angle \(\theta\) between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\):**
   - Using the law of sines in the triangle, we find:
     \[
     \sin \theta = \frac{\sin^2 29^\circ}{\sin 84^\circ}
     \]
   - Calculating this, we find:
     \[
     \sin \theta \approx 0.766
     \]
   - Thus, \(\theta \approx 50^\circ\).

5. **Verification using the quadratic solution:**
   - Solving the quadratic equation derived from the given conditions, we find the angle \(\theta \approx 50^\circ\).

Therefore, the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{50^\circ}\).
