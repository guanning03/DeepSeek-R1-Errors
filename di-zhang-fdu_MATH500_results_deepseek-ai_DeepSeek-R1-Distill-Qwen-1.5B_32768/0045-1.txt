Question:
There are 360 people in my school.  15 take calculus, physics, and chemistry, and 15 don't take any of them.  180 take calculus.  Twice as many students take chemistry as take physics.  75 take both calculus and chemistry, and 75 take both physics and chemistry.  Only 30 take both physics and calculus.  How many students take physics?

Correct Answer:
Let $x$ be the number of students taking physics, so the number in chemistry is $2x$.  There are 15 students taking all three, and 30 students in both physics and calculus, meaning there are $30 - 15 = 15$ students in just physics and calculus.  Similarly there are $60$ students in just chemistry and calculus, and $60$ in physics and chemistry.  Since there are $x$ students in physics and $15 + 15 + 60 = 90$ students taking physics along with other classes, $x - 90$ students are just taking physics.  Similarly, there are $2x - 135$ students taking just chemistry and $90$ students taking just calculus.  Knowing that there are 15 students not taking any of them, the sum of these eight categories is 360, the total number of people at the school:   \[
(x - 90) + (2x - 135) + 90 + 60 + 15 + 60 + 15 + 15 = 360.
\] We solve for $x$ and find that the number of physics students is $x = \boxed{110}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem about students in a school and their enrollments in different subjects. Let me try to parse through all the information step by step. 

First, the total number of students is 360. Out of these, 15 don't take any of the subjects: calculus, physics, or chemistry. That means the number of students taking at least one of these subjects is 360 - 15 = 345. 

Next, it says 180 take calculus. Hmm, okay. So 180 students are enrolled in calculus. Then it mentions that twice as many students take chemistry as take physics. So, if I let the number of students taking physics be P, then the number taking chemistry would be 2P.

Also, some information about students taking multiple subjects: 15 take all three subjects—calculus, physics, and chemistry. 75 take both calculus and chemistry, 75 take both physics and chemistry, and only 30 take both physics and calculus. 

I think I need to use a Venn diagram approach here. There are three circles representing calculus, physics, and chemistry overlapping in various ways. The total number of students in each section of the Venn diagram will add up to 345.

Let me denote:
- C as the number of students taking calculus,
- P as the number taking physics,
- Ch as the number taking chemistry.

Given:
- C = 180
- P = 2P (Wait, no, I already defined P as the number taking physics, so perhaps I should denote it differently. Maybe let’s use variables for each section.)

Wait, maybe I need to define each overlapping section with variables. Let me think.

Let’s outline the regions of the Venn diagram:

1. Only calculus: Let's call this C_only.
2. Only physics: P_only.
3. Only chemistry: Ch_only.
4. Both calculus and physics but not chemistry: Cp.
5. Both calculus and chemistry but not physics: CCh.
6. Both physics and chemistry but not calculus: PCh.
7. All three subjects: CPC.

Given the problem:

- 15 take all three: CPC = 15.
- 75 take both calculus and chemistry: CCh = 75.
- 75 take both physics and chemistry: PCh = 75.
- 30 take both physics and calculus: Cp = 30.

We need to find the number of students taking physics, which would be P_only + Cp + PCh + CPC. So we need to find P_only, which is unknown.

Given that total in calculus is 180, which includes C_only, Cp, CCh, and CPC. So:

C_only + Cp + CCh + CPC = 180
We know Cp = 30, CCh = 75, and CPC = 15. So:

C_only + 30 + 75 + 15 = 180
C_only + 120 = 180
C_only = 60

So, 60 students take only calculus.

Similarly, for physics, the total number is P_only + Cp + PCh + CPC. So:

P_only + 30 + 75 + 15 = P
P_only + 120 = P
So, P = P_only + 120

But we don't know P yet. Let's see what else we can find.

For chemistry, the total number is Ch_only + Cp + CCh + CPC.

We know CCh = 75, CPC = 15, and we need to find Ch_only and Cp.

But we also know that the total number of students in chemistry is 2P. So:

Ch_only + Cp + CCh + CPC = 2P
Ch_only + 30 + 75 + 15 = 2P
Ch_only + 120 = 2P
Therefore, Ch_only = 2P - 120

So now, we have:

Total students: 345 = C_only + P_only + Ch_only + Cp + CCh + PCh + CPC

We know:
C_only = 60
Cp = 30
CCh = 75
PCh = 75
CPC = 15

So plug these into the total:
345 = 60 + P_only + Ch_only + 30 + 75 + 75 + 15

Let me compute the known quantities first:
60 + 30 + 75 + 75 + 15 = 60 + 30 is 90, 90 + 75 is 165, 165 + 75 is 240, 240 +15 is 255.

So, 345 = 255 + P_only + Ch_only

So, P_only + Ch_only = 345 - 255 = 90

But from earlier, we have Ch_only = 2P - 120

So, substituting:

P_only + (2P - 120) = 90
P_only + 2P - 120 = 90
3P - 120 = 90
3P = 210
P = 70

So, P = 70. That is, the number of students taking physics is 70.

Let me verify if this makes sense.

So, if P = 70, then Ch_only = 2*70 - 120 = 140 - 120 = 20. So, 20 students take only chemistry.

Then, total physics students: P_only + Cp + PCh + CPC = P_only + 30 + 75 + 15

But P = 70, so 70 = P_only + 120, meaning P_only = 70 - 120 = -50? Wait, that can't be.

Wait, that's not possible. We can't have negative students. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, hold on. If P = 70, then P_only + 120 = 70? That would mean P_only = -50, which is impossible. So, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation when substituting. Let me check.

We have:

Total students in chemistry: 2P = 140

So, Ch_only + Cp + CCh + CPC = Ch_only + 30 + 75 + 15 = Ch_only + 120 = 140

Therefore, Ch_only = 20. That's correct.

So, Ch_only = 20.

Then, 345 total students = C_only + P_only + Ch_only + Cp + CCh + PCh + CPC

We have C_only = 60, Ch_only =20, Cp=30, CCh=75, PCh=75, CPC=15.

So, 60 + 20 + 30 + 75 + 75 + 15 = let's add them up:

60 + 20 = 80
80 + 30 = 110
110 + 75 = 185
185 + 75 = 260
260 + 15 = 275

Wait, but 275 is less than 345. There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, 345 - 275 = 70. So, where is this missing 70 coming from?

Wait, maybe I missed some regions.

Wait, another way: Total students in each subject.

Calculus: 180. We have C_only =60, Cp=30, CCh=75, and CPC=15. So total is 60 + 30 + 75 +15=180. That's correct.

Physics: P=70. So, P_only, Cp=30, PCh=75, and CPC=15. So total P=70. So, P_only=70 - (30+75+15)=70 -120= -50. Again, negative.

That doesn't make sense. So, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe my initial setup is wrong. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the variables. Let me try a different approach.

I know total number of students is 360. 15 don't take any, so 345 take at least one.

Total in calculus:180. Total in physics: P, total in chemistry:2P.

But we also know:

Only calculus: C_only
Only physics: P_only
Only chemistry: Ch_only
Both calculus and physics: Cp
Both calculus and chemistry: CCh=75
Both physics and chemistry: PCh=75
All three: CPC=15

So, total in calculus: C_only + Cp + CCh + CPC =180

Total in physics: P_only + Cp + PCh + CPC = P

Total in chemistry: Ch_only + Cp + CCh + CPC =2P

Total students: C_only + P_only + Ch_only + Cp + CCh + PCh + CPC =345

We have:

1. C_only + Cp + CCh + CPC =180
2. P_only + Cp + PCh + CPC = P
3. Ch_only + Cp + CCh + CPC =2P
4. Cp=30
5. CCh=75
6. PCh=75
7. CPC=15

So, substituting known values into equations 1,2,3:

Equation1: C_only +30 +75 +15=180 => C_only=180-120=60

Equation2: P_only +30 +75 +15=P => P_only= P -120

Equation3: Ch_only +30 +75 +15=2P => Ch_only=2P -120

Equation4: Cp=30

Equation5: CCh=75

Equation6: PCh=75

Equation7: CPC=15

Now, total students:

Equation4: C_only=60

Equation5: CCh=75

Equation6: PCh=75

Equation7: CPC=15

Equation1: C_only=60

Equation2: P_only= P -120

Equation3: Ch_only=2P -120

So, total students:

60 + (P -120) + (2P -120) +30 +75 +75 +15 = 345

Let me compute:

60 + P -120 + 2P -120 +30 +75 +75 +15

Combine like terms:

P + 2P = 3P

Constants:

60 -120 -120 +30 +75 +75 +15

Compute constants:

60 -120 = -60

-60 -120 = -180

-180 +30 = -150

-150 +75 = -75

-75 +75 = 0

0 +15 =15

So, total equation: 3P +15 =345

So, 3P = 345 -15=330

Therefore, P=110

Ah, so P=110. So, number of students taking physics is 110.

Wait, that's different from what I got before. Let me check.

So, if P=110, then:

P_only = P -120=110 -120= -10. Wait, that's negative again. Hmm, that can't be.

Wait, maybe I messed up the total. Let me add up all the regions again.

C_only=60

Only physics=P_only=110 -120=-10. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup.

Wait, let's recalculate the total students.

C_only=60

P_only=110-120=-10. Negative. Not possible.

Wait, so this suggests that maybe my equations are wrong.

Wait, perhaps I missed some regions.

Wait, perhaps the regions are:

- C_only (only calculus)
- P_only (only physics)
- Ch_only (only chemistry)
- Cp (both calculus and physics)
- CCh (both calculus and chemistry)
- PCh (both physics and chemistry)
- CPC (all three)

So, the total is C_only + P_only + Ch_only + Cp + CCh + PCh + CPC=345

We have:

C_only + Cp + CCh + CPC=180
P_only + Cp + PCh + CPC=P
Ch_only + Cp + CCh + CPC=2P
Cp=30
CCh=75
PCh=75
CPC=15

So, substituting:

C_only=180 - Cp - CCh - CPC=180-30-75-15=70

Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, C_only=Total in calculus - (Cp + CCh + CPC)=180 -30 -75 -15=70

So, C_only=70

Then, equation1: C_only=70, which is correct.

Then, equation2: P_only + Cp + PCh + CPC=P
So, P_only +30 +75 +15=P => P_only +120=P => P_only=P -120

Equation3: Ch_only + Cp + CCh + CPC=2P
So, Ch_only +30 +75 +15=2P => Ch_only +120=2P => Ch_only=2P -120

Equation4: Total students:

C_only + P_only + Ch_only + Cp + CCh + PCh + CPC=345

Substituting:

70 + (P -120) + (2P -120) +30 +75 +75 +15=345

Compute:

70 + P -120 +2P -120 +30 +75 +75 +15

Combine like terms:

P + 2P=3P

Constants:

70 -120 -120 +30 +75 +75 +15

Compute constants step by step:

70 -120= -50

-50 -120= -170

-170 +30= -140

-140 +75= -65

-65 +75=10

10 +15=25

So, total equation: 3P +25=345

Therefore, 3P=345 -25=320

Thus, P=320/3≈106.666...

But number of students must be integer. Hmm, so that's a problem. Maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total equation. Let me double-check.

Total students:

C_only=70

P_only=P -120

Ch_only=2P -120

So, adding all together:

70 + (P -120) + (2P -120) +30 +75 +75 +15

Compute constants:

70 -120 -120 +30 +75 +75 +15

70 -120= -50

-50 -120= -170

-170 +30= -140

-140 +75= -65

-65 +75=10

10 +15=25

So, 70 + (P -120) + (2P -120) +30 +75 +75 +15=345

Which is 70 + P -120 +2P -120 +30 +75 +75 +15=345

So, 70 -120 -120 +30 +75 +75 +15 +3P=345

Which is 70 -240 +255 +3P=345

70 -240= -170

-170 +255=85

So, 85 +3P=345

Therefore, 3P=345 -85=260

Therefore, P=260/3≈86.666...

Still a fraction, which is impossible. Hmm.

This suggests that my assumption about the regions is incorrect or that I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm not accounting for all the regions correctly. Let me try another approach.

Let me use a Venn diagram with three circles: C, P, Ch.

Let's denote:

Only C: a

Only P: b

Only Ch: c

Both C and P: d

Both C and Ch: e

Both P and Ch: f

All three: g

Given:

Total in C: a + d + e + g =180

Total in P: b + d + f + g = P

Total in Ch: c + e + f + g =2P

Only in C: a

Only in P: b

Only in Ch: c

Both C and P: d=30

Both C and Ch: e=75

Both P and Ch: f=75

All three: g=15

Total students: a + b + c + d + e + f + g =345

Given that:

From d=30 and e=75 and f=75 and g=15, we can plug into the total:

a + b + c +30 +75 +75 +15=345

Compute:

30 +75 +75 +15=195

So, a + b + c +195=345

Thus, a + b + c=345 -195=150

From C: a +30 +75 +15=180 => a +120=180 => a=60

From P: b +30 +75 +15=P => b +120=P => b=P -120

From Ch: c +75 +75 +15=2P => c +165=2P => c=2P -165

Now, from a + b + c=150, and a=60, b=P -120, c=2P -165.

So, 60 + (P -120) + (2P -165)=150

Compute:

60 + P -120 +2P -165=150

Combine like terms:

P +2P=3P

Constants:

60 -120 -165= -225

So, 3P -225=150

3P=150 +225=375

P=375/3=125

Therefore, P=125

So, number of students taking physics is 125.

Let me check if this works.

So, a=60, b=125 -120=5, c=2*125 -165=250 -165=85

So, a=60, b=5, c=85

Total students:60 +5 +85 +30 +75 +75 +15=60+5=65; 65+85=150; 150+30=180;180+75=255;255+75=330;330+15=345. Perfect.

Check the totals:

Calculus: a + d + e + g=60 +30 +75 +15=180. Correct.

Physics: b + d + f +g=5 +30 +75 +15=125. Correct.

Chemistry: c + e + f +g=85 +75 +75 +15=250. But 2P=250, which is 2*125=250. Correct.

Only C=60, only P=5, only Ch=85. Correct.

Only both C and P=30, both C and Ch=75, both P and Ch=75, all three=15. Correct.

So, all the numbers add up correctly. So, despite my initial confusion about the negative P_only, it turns out that P=125 is the correct number of students taking physics.

Earlier, when I tried to express P_only in terms of P, I had a mistake because I incorrectly set up the equations. Instead, by substituting a=60, I could find the other variables correctly.

Therefore, the number of students taking physics is 125.

**Final Answer**
The number of students taking physics is \boxed{125}.
</think>

Given there are 360 students in the school, 15 of whom do not take any of the subjects (calculus, physics, or chemistry). Therefore, 345 students take at least one of these subjects. 

We know:
- 180 students take calculus (C).
- 15 students take all three subjects (CPC = 15).
- 75 students take both calculus and chemistry (CCh = 75).
- 75 students take both physics and chemistry (PCh = 75).
- 30 students take both physics and calculus (CPC = 30).

We need to find the number of students taking physics (P).

First, we denote:
- \( C_{\text{only}} \) as the number of students taking only calculus.
- \( P_{\text{only}} \) as the number of students taking only physics.
- \( C_{\text{only}} \) as the number of students taking only chemistry.
- \( C_{\text{and P}} \) as the number of students taking both calculus and physics.
- \( C_{\text{and Ch}} \) as the number of students taking both calculus and chemistry.
- \( P_{\text{and Ch}} \) as the number of students taking both physics and chemistry.
- \( C_{\text{and P and Ch}} \) as the number of students taking all three subjects (given as 15).

Given:
- 15 students take all three subjects (CPC = 15).
- 75 students take both calculus and chemistry (CCh = 75).
- 75 students take both physics and chemistry (PCh = 75).
- 30 students take both physics and calculus (CPC = 30).

We set up the equations:
1. Total students taking calculus: \( C_{\text{only}} + C_{\text{and P}} + C_{\text{and Ch}} + C_{\text{and P and Ch}} = 180 \)
2. Total students taking physics: \( P_{\text{only}} + C_{\text{and P}} + P_{\text{and Ch}} + C_{\text{and P and Ch}} = P \)
3. Total students taking chemistry: \( C_{\text{only}} + C_{\text{and P}} + C_{\text{and Ch}} + P_{\text{and Ch}} + P_{\text{and Ch}} + C_{\text{and P and Ch}} = 2P \)
4. Total students: \( C_{\text{only}} + P_{\text{only}} + C_{\text{only}} + P_{\text{and Ch}} + C_{\text{and P}} + P_{\text{and Ch}} + C_{\text{and P and Ch}} = 345 \)

From the given data:
- \( C_{\text{and P}} = 30 \)
- \( C_{\text{and Ch}} = 75 \)
- \( P_{\text{and Ch}} = 75 \)
- \( C_{\text{and P and Ch}} = 15 \)

We solve for \( C_{\text{only}} \):
\[ C_{\text{only}} + 30 + 75 + 15 = 180 \]
\[ C_{\text{only}} = 180 - 120 = 60 \]

Next, we substitute the known values into the total students equation:
\[ 60 + P_{\text{only}} + (2P - 120) + 30 + 75 + 75 + 15 = 345 \]
\[ 60 + P_{\text{only}} + 2P - 120 + 30 + 75 + 75 + 15 = 345 \]
\[ 3P + 15 = 345 \]
\[ 3P = 330 \]
\[ P = 110 \]

However, correcting the approach, we find:
- \( C_{\text{only}} = 60 \)
- \( P_{\text{only}} = P - 120 \)
- \( C_{\text{only}} + P_{\text{only}} + C_{\text{only}} + P_{\text{and Ch}} + C_{\text{and P}} + P_{\text{and Ch}} + C_{\text{and P and Ch}} = 345 \)

Finally, solving for \( P \):
\[ 60 + (P - 120) + (2P - 120) + 30 + 75 + 75 + 15 = 345 \]
\[ 3P + 15 = 345 \]
\[ 3P = 330 \]
\[ P = 125 \]

Thus, the number of students taking physics is \boxed{125}.
