Question:
The function $f$ satisfies the functional equation
\[f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1\]for all real numbers $x$ and $y.$  If $f(1) = 1,$ then find all integers $n$ such that $f(n) = n.$  Enter all such integers, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
Setting $x = y = 0,$ we get
\[2f(0) = f(0) - 1,\]so $f(0) = -1.$

Setting $y = 1,$ we get
\[f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1,\]so
\[f(x + 1) - f(x) = x + 2.\]Thus,
\begin{align*}
f(2) - f(1) &= 1 + 2, \\
f(3) - f(2) &= 2 + 2, \\
f(4) - f(3) &= 3 + 2, \\
&\dots, \\
f(n) - f(n - 1) &= (n - 1) + 2.
\end{align*}Adding all the equations, we get
\[f(n) - f(1) = 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + (n - 1) + 2(n - 1) = \frac{(n - 1)n}{2} + 2n - 2 = \frac{n^2 + 3n - 4}{2},\]so
\[f(n) = \frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2}\]for all positive integers $n.$

Setting $x = -n$ and $y = n,$ where $n$ is a positive integer, we get
\[f(-n) + f(n) = f(0) + n^2 - 1.\]Then
\[f(-n) = n^2 - f(n) + f(0) - 1 = n^2 - \frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2} - 2 = \frac{n^2 - 3n - 2}{2}.\]Thus, the formula
\[f(n) = \frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2}\]holds for all integers $n.$

We want to solve $f(n) = n,$ or
\[\frac{n^2 + 3n - 2}{2} = n.\]Then $n^2 + 3n - 2 = 2n,$ or $n^2 + n - 2 = 0.$  This factors as $(n - 1)(n + 2) = 0,$ so the solutions are $n = \boxed{1,-2}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this functional equation problem here. It says that the function \( f \) satisfies the equation:

\[ f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 \]

for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \). And we're also given that \( f(1) = 1 \). The task is to find all integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \).

Hmm, functional equations can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that one common strategy is to plug in specific values for \( x \) and \( y \) to figure out the form of the function \( f \). Let's try that.

First, let me see if I can find the value of \( f(0) \). That might help simplify things. I can set \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \) in the equation:

\[ f(0) + f(0) = f(0 + 0) - (0)(0) - 1 \]
\[ 2f(0) = f(0) - 0 - 1 \]
\[ 2f(0) = f(0) - 1 \]

Subtracting \( f(0) \) from both sides:

\[ f(0) = -1 \]

Okay, so \( f(0) = -1 \). That's a good starting point.

Next, maybe I can try to find a general form for \( f(x) \). Let me think about how functional equations often involve linear functions or quadratic functions. Let's assume \( f \) is a quadratic function because the equation involves a term \( xy \), which is quadratic. So, let's suppose that \( f(x) \) is a quadratic function of the form:

\[ f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \]

Where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants that we need to determine.

We already know that \( f(0) = -1 \), so plugging \( x = 0 \) into the quadratic:

\[ f(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = c \]
\[ c = -1 \]

So now, our function is:

\[ f(x) = ax^2 + bx - 1 \]

Next, let's use the functional equation to find \( a \) and \( b \). Let's substitute our assumed quadratic form into the equation:

\[ f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 \]

Substituting \( f(x) \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\[ f(x) + f(y) = (ax^2 + bx - 1) + (ay^2 + by - 1) \]
\[ = ax^2 + ay^2 + bx + by - 2 \]

Right-hand side (RHS):

\[ f(x + y) - xy - 1 \]
\[ = a(x + y)^2 + b(x + y) - 1 - xy - 1 \]
\[ = a(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) + b(x + y) - 1 - xy - 1 \]
\[ = ax^2 + 2axy + ay^2 + bx + by - 2 - xy \]

So, we have LHS = RHS:

\[ ax^2 + ay^2 + bx + by - 2 = ax^2 + 2axy + ay^2 + bx + by - 2 - xy \]

Let me subtract \( ax^2 + ay^2 + bx + by - 2 \) from both sides:

\[ 0 = 2axy + (-2 - xy) \]

So, simplifying:

\[ 0 = 2axy - xy - 2 \]
\[ 0 = xy(2a - 1) - 2 \]

This equation needs to hold for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \). Hmm, but the right-hand side is a linear expression in \( xy \) minus a constant, which can't be equal to zero for all \( x \) and \( y \) unless the coefficients of like terms are zero. Let's analyze this.

Looking at the equation:

\[ 0 = (2a - 1)xy - 2 \]

For this to hold for all \( x \) and \( y \), the coefficient of \( xy \) must be zero, and the constant term must also be zero. So, we have two equations:

1. Coefficient of \( xy \): \( 2a - 1 = 0 \)
2. Constant term: \( -2 = 0 \)

Wait, the second equation \( -2 = 0 \) is impossible. That suggests that my assumption that \( f(x) \) is quadratic might be wrong because otherwise, we can't satisfy the equation for all \( x \) and \( y \).

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in assuming \( f(x) \) is quadratic. Let me see. The functional equation involves \( f(x + y) \), so perhaps \( f \) is a quadratic function. But maybe I need to try a different approach.

Alternatively, let's consider the functional equation again:

\[ f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 \]

If I rearrange this equation:

\[ f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + xy + 1 \]

Hmm, this looks similar to the equation of a quadratic function because when you have \( f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + cxy + d \), it often indicates a quadratic form. Maybe I can assume \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) again, but let's see.

Wait, but earlier when I tried, I ended up with an impossible equation because of the constant term. Maybe I need to consider another function form. Perhaps \( f(x) \) is a quadratic function plus a linear function or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a substitution that simplifies the equation. Let's see.

Let me try to set \( y = 1 \). Since we know \( f(1) = 1 \), that might help.

So, set \( y = 1 \):

\[ f(x) + f(1) = f(x + 1) - x(1) - 1 \]
\[ f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1 \]
\[ f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1 + x + 1 \]
\[ f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2 \]

That's interesting. So, \( f(x + 1) - f(x) = x + 2 \). That suggests that the difference between consecutive terms is linear. Which makes me think that \( f(x) \) is a quadratic function because the second difference is constant.

Let me try to find the general form of \( f(x) \). If \( f(x + 1) - f(x) = x + 2 \), then perhaps \( f(x) \) is a quadratic function with leading coefficient \( \frac{1}{2} \) because the second difference would be the coefficient times 2.

Wait, more formally, let's consider the function \( f(x) \) as a polynomial. Suppose \( f(x) \) is a quadratic polynomial: \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \). Then, as before, let's compute \( f(x + 1) \):

\[ f(x + 1) = a(x + 1)^2 + b(x + 1) + c \]
\[ = a(x^2 + 2x + 1) + b(x + 1) + c \]
\[ = ax^2 + 2ax + a + bx + b + c \]
\[ = ax^2 + (2a + b)x + (a + b + c) \]

Then, \( f(x + 1) - f(x) \) is:

\[ [ax^2 + (2a + b)x + (a + b + c)] - [ax^2 + bx + c] \]
\[ = ax^2 + (2a + b)x + a + b + c - ax^2 - bx - c \]
\[ = (2a + b - b)x + a + b + c - c \]
\[ = 2a x + a + b \]

But from earlier, we have \( f(x + 1) - f(x) = x + 2 \). So, equating coefficients:

1. Coefficient of \( x \): \( 2a = 1 \) ⇒ \( a = \frac{1}{2} \)
2. Constant term: \( a + b = 2 \) ⇒ \( \frac{1}{2} + b = 2 \) ⇒ \( b = \frac{3}{2} \)

So, now we have \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( b = \frac{3}{2} \). We already know \( c = -1 \) from earlier.

Therefore, the function \( f(x) \) is:

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 \]

Let me verify if this function satisfies the original functional equation.

Let me compute \( f(x) + f(y) \):

\[ f(x) + f(y) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}y - 1 \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y - 2 \]

Now, compute \( f(x + y) - xy - 1 \):

First, compute \( f(x + y) \):

\[ f(x + y) = \frac{1}{2}(x + y)^2 + \frac{3}{2}(x + y) - 1 \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y - 1 \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + xy + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y - 1 \]

Now, subtract \( xy \) and 1:

\[ f(x + y) - xy - 1 = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + xy + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y - 1 - xy - 1 \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}y - 2 \]

Which matches \( f(x) + f(y) \). So, yes, the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 \) satisfies the functional equation.

Now, let's compute \( f(n) \) for integer values of \( n \) and see when \( f(n) = n \).

First, let's write \( f(n) \):

\[ f(n) = \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{3}{2}n - 1 \]

We want \( f(n) = n \):

\[ \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{3}{2}n - 1 = n \]

Let's solve this equation for integer \( n \):

Subtract \( n \) from both sides:

\[ \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{3}{2}n - 1 - n = 0 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{1}{2}n - 1 = 0 \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fractions:

\[ n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \]

Now, solve the quadratic equation:

\[ n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[ n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
Where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = -2 \).

So,

\[ n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} \]
\[ n = \frac{-1 \pm 3}{2} \]

Thus, the solutions are:

1. \( n = \frac{-1 + 3}{2} = 1 \)
2. \( n = \frac{-1 - 3}{2} = -2 \)

So, the integer solutions are \( n = 1 \) and \( n = -2 \).

Wait, let me double-check these solutions.

First, \( n = 1 \):

Compute \( f(1) \):

\[ f(1) = \frac{1}{2}(1)^2 + \frac{3}{2}(1) - 1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{2} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Which is correct.

Next, \( n = -2 \):

Compute \( f(-2) \):

\[ f(-2) = \frac{1}{2}(-2)^2 + \frac{3}{2}(-2) - 1 \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2}(4) + \frac{3}{2}(-2) - 1 \]
\[ = 2 - 3 - 1 \]
\[ = -2 \]

Which is also correct.

So, both \( n = 1 \) and \( n = -2 \) satisfy \( f(n) = n \).

Wait a second, but the quadratic equation only gave us two solutions, which are 1 and -2. So, those are the only integer solutions.

Is that all? Let me just make sure there are no other integer solutions.

Given that the equation \( n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \) only has two roots, which are 1 and -2, and since we're dealing with integers, there are no other integer solutions.

Therefore, the integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \) are \( 1 \) and \( -2 \).

**Final Answer**
The integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \) are \boxed{-2} and \boxed{1}.

Wait, looking back at my initial solving, I had two solutions, 1 and -2. But in the problem statement, it says "all integers n", so maybe I need to present both as the final answer. But in the system, it's expecting one box with all the integers, maybe separated by commas.

Wait, the original problem says "find all integers n such that f(n) = n", so I should list them. So, the answer is both 1 and -2.

But in the previous thought process, I concluded both, but in the final answer, I wrote two boxes. Let me check.

Wait, in my initial solving, I found n = 1 and n = -2, so I should include both in the final answer. However, in the problem, it asks to "find all integers n", so both are valid.

But in the problem statement, it says "enter all such integers, separated by commas." So, the final answer should be two integers: -2 and 1, separated by a comma.

So, the final answer is \boxed{-2}, \boxed{1}

But in the system, it's supposed to be within a single box with all integers separated by commas. So, maybe it's boxed as \boxed{-2, 1}.

Wait, looking back at the instructions, it says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". So, I should write all integers separated by commas inside a single box.

So, the correct way is \boxed{-2, 1}.

But let me just cross-verify the function.

Given \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 \), we have:

For \( n = 1 \): \( f(1) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{2} - 1 = 1 \), which is correct.

For \( n = -2 \): \( f(-2) = \frac{1}{2}(4) + \frac{3}{2}(-2) - 1 = 2 - 3 - 1 = -2 \), which is correct.

And as we saw, the equation \( f(n) = n \) reduces to \( n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \), which has roots 1 and -2.

So, yes, both are solutions. Therefore, the integers are -2 and 1.

**Final Answer**
The integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \) are \boxed{-2} and \boxed{1}.

Wait, no, actually in the instructions, it says "Enter all such integers, separated by commas." So, I think it should be written as \boxed{-2, 1}.

But in the initial problem statement, it's in Chinese, so maybe the user wants the answer in LaTeX with both numbers inside the box. Let me check.

Wait, the instruction was: "Enter all such integers, separated by commas." So, in the system, I think we can write it as \boxed{-2, 1}.

But in the initial problem, when I wrote "put your final answer within \boxed{}", maybe they expect all in one box. So, I think putting both numbers separated by comma inside the box is correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-2, 1}
</think>

Given the functional equation:

\[ f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 \]

for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), and knowing that \( f(1) = 1 \), we need to find all integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \).

First, we determine \( f(0) \) by setting \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \):

\[ f(0) + f(0) = f(0) - 1 \]
\[ 2f(0) = f(0) - 1 \]
\[ f(0) = -1 \]

Next, we assume \( f(x) \) is a quadratic function of the form \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \). Using the known value \( f(0) = -1 \), we find \( c = -1 \). Thus, the function becomes:

\[ f(x) = ax^2 + bx - 1 \]

We then use the functional equation to find \( a \) and \( b \). Setting \( y = 1 \) and using the known value \( f(1) = 1 \):

\[ f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1 \]
\[ f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2 \]

This suggests that \( f(x) \) is a quadratic function with the second difference being constant. Solving for \( a \) and \( b \), we find:

\[ 2a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ a + b = 2 \implies \frac{1}{2} + b = 2 \implies b = \frac{3}{2} \]

Thus, the function is:

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}x - 1 \]

We solve for \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \):

\[ \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{3}{2}n - 1 = n \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{1}{2}n - 1 = 0 \]
\[ n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \]

Solving this quadratic equation:

\[ n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} \]
\[ n = \frac{-1 \pm 3}{2} \]

Thus, the solutions are \( n = 1 \) and \( n = -2 \).

The integers \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n \) are \boxed{-2, 1}.
