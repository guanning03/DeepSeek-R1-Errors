Question:
The wheel shown is spun twice, so that the numbers indicated by the pointer are randomly determined (with each number on the wheel being equally likely). The two numbers determined in this way are recorded. The first number is divided by 4, determining one of the remainders 1,2,3 marking the columns of the checkerboard shown. The second number is divided by 5, determining one of the remainders 1,2,3,4 marking the rows of the checkerboard. Finally, a checker is placed on the square where this column and row meet. What is the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard?

Correct Answer:
The first remainder is even with probability $2/6=1/3$ and odd with probability 2/3.  The second remainder is even with probability $3/6=1/2$ and odd with probability 1/2.  The parity of the first remainder and the parity of the second remainder are independent, since they're determined by separate spins of the wheel.

The shaded squares are those that indicate that both remainders are odd or both are even. Hence the square is shaded with probability \[
\frac{1}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{2} =\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.
\]

Gold:
\frac{1}{2}

Wrong Prediction:
\frac{2}{7}

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this probability problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand everything.

There's a wheel shown, and it's being spun twice. Each time it's spun, the pointer stops on a number, which is used to determine columns and rows on a checkerboard. The first number is divided by 4, giving a remainder of 1, 2, or 3, which corresponds to the columns of the checkerboard. The second number is divided by 5, giving a remainder of 1, 2, 3, or 4, which corresponds to the rows. A checker is placed on the square where the column and row meet. We need to find the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard.

Alright, so to break it down, the wheel is divided into numbers, and when spun, it lands on one number. The first number is used to find its remainder when divided by 4, which gives 1, 2, or 3—this is the column. The second number is divided by 5, giving a remainder of 1, 2, 3, or 4—this is the row. The checker is placed at the intersection of this column and row, and we need to see if that square is shaded.

First, I need to figure out how many possible outcomes there are in total when spinning the wheel twice. Then, I need to figure out how many of those outcomes result in a shaded square. The probability would be the number of shaded outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

But wait, hold on. The problem doesn't specify how many numbers are on the wheel. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me check the Asymptote code provided. It shows the wheel is drawn with certain lines. Hmm, maybe the wheel is divided into 8 segments? Let me think.

Looking at the Asymptote code, the wheel is drawn with points at (1.7,1), (-1.7,-1), (-1.7,1), (1.7,-1), (0,2), (0,-2), (3,0), (6,0), (3,-2), (6,-2). So, the wheel has points at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and then at 4, 5, 6, 7, 8? Wait, no, the points are (1.7,1) as 1, (-1.7,-1) as -1, (-1.7,1) as 3, (1.7,-1) as -3, (0,2) as 2, (0,-2) as -2, (3,0) as 4, (6,0) as 5, (3,-2) as 6, (6,-2) as 7. Wait, but 5 isn't on the wheel? Because (3,0) is 4, (6,0) is 5, (3,-2) is 6, (6,-2) is 7. So, the numbers on the wheel are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. That's 7 numbers. So the wheel has 7 numbers.

Therefore, when spun, there are 7 possible outcomes for the first spin and 7 possible outcomes for the second spin, making 49 total possible outcomes.

Now, the first number is divided by 4, so the remainder can be 1, 2, or 3. These correspond to the columns of the checkerboard. The second number is divided by 5, so the remainder can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, which correspond to the rows. Therefore, the checkerboard is a 3x4 grid, with columns labeled 1, 2, 3 and rows labeled 1, 2, 3, 4.

I need to figure out how many of these squares are shaded. The Asymptote code shows the checkerboard with specific shaded squares. Let me try to visualize it.

In the Asymptote code, the checkerboard is drawn with several filled rectangles. Let me identify the shaded squares:

1. (3,0) is a gray square.
2. (4,-1) is a gray square.
3. (5,0) is a gray square.
4. (5,-2) is a gray square.
5. (4,1) is a gray square.
6. (3,2) is a gray square.

Wait, the coordinates are a bit confusing because the drawing might be in a different coordinate system. Maybe I should translate these coordinates into grid positions.

Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, the gray squares are:

- (3,0) is a gray square.
- (4,-1) is a gray square.
- (5,0) is a gray square.
- (5,-2) is a gray square.
- (4,1) is a gray square.
- (3,2) is a gray square.

So, translating these into the grid:

Assuming the grid is from (3,0) to (6,-2). So, the columns are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and the rows are 1, 2, 3, 4. Wait, but the shaded squares are at:

(3,0): This is column 3, row 0. Hmm, but our rows are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4. So, maybe row 0 is actually the top row, which would correspond to row 4 in the grid. Similarly, column 3 is column 3, but in the grid, columns go from 1 to 6.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust for that. Let me think.

The pointer landing on 3 gives column 3, which is the third column. The pointer landing on 4 gives row 1, which is the bottom row in the grid. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the grid is drawn with rows from 1 to 4, and columns from 1 to 6.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, the checkerboard is drawn with:

- Columns: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Rows: 1, 2, 3, 4

But the shaded squares are at:

(3,0), which in grid terms would be column 3, row 0. But since rows start at 1, maybe row 0 is actually row 4. Similarly, (4,-1) is column 4, row -1, which might be row 3 or something else. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid is drawn from (3,0) to (6,-2), so the grid is 3x4, with columns 1 to 4 and rows 1 to 3. Maybe the Asymptote coordinate system is flipped. So, (3,0) is column 1, row 1? Wait, no, because (3,0) is the first point. Wait, let me think.

Wait, perhaps the Asymptote coordinate system has (0,0) at the bottom-left corner, and it's being drawn with positive y upwards. So, (3,0) is on the right side, column 3, row 0. But perhaps row 0 is the bottom row. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I should just figure out the number of shaded squares regardless of their positions, since the problem is about a checkerboard, which is a standard chessboard with alternating shaded squares.

Wait, in a standard 3x4 checkerboard, how many shaded squares are there? Let's see. In a standard checkerboard, the number of shaded squares depends on whether the total number is even or odd. 3 rows, 4 columns: total squares are 12. So, half of them would be shaded? But 12 is even, so 6 shaded squares. But wait, depending on the starting color, it could be 6 or 6 as well. Wait, no, 3x4 is 12 squares. Each row has 6 and 6, alternating.

Wait, in a 3x4 grid, each row has 2 shaded squares. So, 3 rows, 2 shaded each: 6 shaded squares.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawn with both rows and columns, but maybe it's a different shading pattern. The Asymptote code is drawing multiple gray squares at (3,0), (4,-1), (5,0), (5,-2), (4,1), (3,2). So, how many are shaded?

Let me count them:

1. (3,0)
2. (4,-1)
3. (5,0)
4. (5,-2)
5. (4,1)
6. (3,2)

So, that's 6 shaded squares.

Wait, but the grid from (3,0) to (6,-2) is 3 columns (1,2,3) and 4 rows (1,2,3,4). But the shaded squares are at positions:

(3,0): column 3, row 0. But in our grid, row 0 is the bottom row, which would correspond to row 4 in the standard checkerboard.

Similarly, (4,-1): column 4, row -1. Wait, row -1 doesn't exist. Maybe it's a typo or misplacement.

Wait, perhaps the Asymptote coordinate system is such that (0,0) is at the bottom-left, (0,2) is at the top-left, (3,0) is the first point at the bottom-right, (3,2) is the top-right, and (6,-2) is the bottom-left, (6,0) is the top-left, (3,-2) is the top-right.

Wait, actually, maybe it's better to treat the grid as a standard 3x4 grid with rows 1 to 4 and columns 1 to 4.

But the shaded squares are at (3,0), which would be column 3, row 0. But row 0 is not part of the grid. Maybe (3,0) is an edge case.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different grid.

Wait, maybe the checkerboard is 3 columns and 4 rows, but the Asymptote code is drawing it in a different coordinate system.

Alternatively, maybe I should just think in terms of the two numbers: the first number divided by 4 gives columns 1,2,3, and the second number divided by 5 gives rows 1,2,3,4.

Each column and row corresponds to a specific shaded square. So, maybe I can figure out how many squares are shaded based on the remainders.

Let me think: for the first number, when divided by 4, the possible remainders are 1,2,3, which correspond to columns 1,2,3.

For the second number, when divided by 5, the possible remainders are 1,2,3,4, which correspond to rows 1,2,3,4.

So, each column and row combination is a square on the checkerboard. Now, how many of these squares are shaded?

From the Asymptote code, it's showing 6 shaded squares, but let's confirm.

Looking at the points:

1. (3,0): column 3, row 0. If row 0 is the bottom row, which is row 4 in standard terms, then perhaps it's a shaded square. Similarly, (4,-1): column 4, row -1, which would be row 3 in standard terms.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to just figure out for each column and row combination whether it's shaded based on the Asymptote code.

Alternatively, perhaps the Asymptote code shows the entire checkerboard, with specific shaded squares, so maybe I can count them.

Looking at the Asymptote code, the checkerboard is filled with several gray rectangles:

1. (3,0)--(3,1)--(4,1)--(4,0)--cycle: This is a square at (3,0) to (4,1), which would be column 3, row 0. If row 0 is considered row 4, maybe this is a shaded square.

2. (3,-2)--(3,-1)--(4,-1)--(4,0)--cycle: This is a square at (3,-2) to (4,-1), which would be column 3, row -1. That's row 3 in standard terms.

3. (4,1)--(4,2)--(5,2)--(5,1)--cycle: Column 4, row 1.

4. (4,-1)--(4,0)--(5,0)--(5,-1)--cycle: Column 4, row -1, which is row 3.

5. (5,0)--(5,1)--(6,1)--(6,0)--cycle: Column 5, row 0. If row 0 is row 4.

6. (5,-2)--(5,-1)--(6,-1)--(6,-2)--cycle: Column 5, row -1, which is row 3.

So, in terms of standard rows 1 to 4, columns 1 to 6:

1. (3,0): column 3, row 0 (row 4)
2. (3,-2): column 3, row -2 (row 2)
3. (4,1): column 4, row 1
4. (4,-1): column 4, row 3
5. (5,0): column 5, row 0 (row 4)
6. (5,-2): column 5, row -2 (row 2)

So, shaded squares are:

- (3,0): column 3, row 4
- (3,-2): column 3, row 2
- (4,1): column 4, row 1
- (4,-1): column 4, row 3
- (5,0): column 5, row 4
- (5,-2): column 5, row 2

So, that's 6 shaded squares. Each column and row combination is a square on the checkerboard.

So, the checkerboard has 6 shaded squares out of 12 total squares (since 3 columns and 4 rows). So, the probability of landing on a shaded square is 6/12 = 1/2. But wait, hold on, that seems too high.

Wait, no. Wait, in the checkerboard, each column has 4 squares, so 3 columns * 4 rows = 12 squares. Out of these, 6 are shaded. So, yes, 6 shaded squares. Therefore, the probability is 6/12 = 1/2.

But wait, the question is about the checker being on a shaded square. But the two numbers are determined by spinning the wheel twice, and each spin is independent. So, perhaps the probability is not 1/2 because the number of shaded squares depends on the number of times the wheel lands on specific numbers.

Wait, no, actually, the shading of the squares is determined by the remainders, so each remainder pair corresponds to a shaded square. So, the shaded squares are fixed based on the remainders.

Wait, no, the asy code is just the checkerboard. The shaded squares are fixed, and the checkerboard is determined by the remainders. So, each remainder pair (column, row) corresponds to a shaded square or not.

So, perhaps the total number of shaded squares is 6, each corresponding to a specific remainder pair. So, the probability is 6 divided by the total number of possible (column, row) pairs, which is 3*4=12.

Therefore, the probability would be 6/12 = 1/2.

But wait, I need to confirm. Because in the Asymptote code, the checkerboard is drawn with 6 shaded squares, each corresponding to a specific combination of remainders. So, when the first number mod 4 is 1,2,3 and the second number mod 5 is 1,2,3,4, each of these pairs corresponds to a specific shaded square.

So, in total, there are 3*4=12 possible (column, row) pairs, each with equal probability, since the wheel is spun twice. Each spin is independent, so each column has a 1/3 chance and each row has a 1/4 chance, so each pair has a 1/12 chance.

Since 6 of these 12 pairs result in a shaded square, the probability is 6/12 = 1/2.

Wait, but hold on, is that right? Because if the wheel is spun twice, the first spin determines column, the second spin determines row. Each spin is independent, so each column and each row is equally likely, but the number of shaded squares is 6 out of 12, so the probability is 1/2.

But let me think again.

Wait, the wheel is spun twice, so each spin is independent, each with 7 possible outcomes. So, total outcomes are 49. Now, how many of these 49 outcomes result in a shaded square.

To find this, we need to count the number of column, row pairs that are shaded. Since the shaded squares are fixed (as per the Asymptote code), each shaded square corresponds to a unique (column, row) pair.

From the Asymptote code, each shaded square is at:

1. Column 3, Row 4
2. Column 3, Row 2
3. Column 4, Row 1
4. Column 4, Row 3
5. Column 5, Row 4
6. Column 5, Row 2

So, 6 shaded squares, each corresponding to a unique (column, row) pair. So, 6 shaded squares.

But wait, is that correct? Wait, in the Asymptote code, each shaded square is at a specific (column, row). So, for the checkerboard, each (column, row) pair is either shaded or not.

Therefore, the number of shaded squares is 6, each corresponding to a unique (column, row) pair.

Therefore, the probability is the number of shaded (column, row) pairs divided by total possible (column, row) pairs.

But the (column, row) pairs are not all equally probable, because the first spin (column) has 7 possibilities, each with probability 1/7, and the second spin (row) has 7 possibilities, each with probability 1/7, so each (column, row) pair has probability 1/(7*7)=1/49.

But since the shaded squares are 6 out of 12 total (column, row) pairs, each of which has probability 1/49.

Wait, no, hold on. Each (column, row) pair is equally likely, each with probability 1/49.

So, the probability that the checker is on a shaded square is equal to the number of shaded (column, row) pairs divided by 49.

But wait, the number of shaded (column, row) pairs is 6. So, the probability is 6/49.

Wait, but hold on, let's double-check. Because in the Asymptote code, the shaded squares are fixed, but when you spin the wheel, each spin is independent, so each (column, row) pair is equally likely, each with probability 1/49. So, if there are 6 shaded (column, row) pairs, the probability is 6/49.

But earlier, I thought that each (column, row) pair corresponds to a shaded square, so the probability is 6/12=1/2, but that was under the assumption that each (column, row) pair had equal probability.

Wait, no, actually, each (column, row) pair is equally likely because the wheel is spun twice, so each column is equally likely, each row is equally likely, so each (column, row) pair is equally likely.

Therefore, since there are 3 columns and 4 rows, 12 possible pairs, 6 of which are shaded, so the probability is 6/12 = 1/2.

But wait, that seems conflicting with the total outcomes. If it's 6/49, that's approximately 0.122, and 1/2 is 0.5. Which one is correct?

Wait, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me clarify.

Each spin is independent, so the probability of getting a specific column is 1/7, and the probability of getting a specific row is 1/7, so the probability of getting a specific (column, row) pair is (1/7)*(1/7)=1/49.

Since there are 6 shaded (column, row) pairs, each with probability 1/49, the total probability is 6*(1/49)=6/49.

Wait, but now I'm confused because 6/49 is approximately 0.122, but 6/12=1/2 is 0.5.

But which is correct? Is the (column, row) pair equally likely?

Wait, let's think about it step by step.

When spinning the wheel twice, each spin is independent, so the probability of getting a specific first spin is 1/7, and the probability of getting a specific second spin is 1/7. Therefore, the probability of getting a specific pair is (1/7)*(1/7)=1/49.

Therefore, each (column, row) pair has probability 1/49, regardless of whether it's shaded or not. So, the probability that the checker is on a shaded square is equal to the number of shaded (column, row) pairs divided by 49.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, each shaded square is at a specific (column, row) pair, so 6 shaded squares, each with probability 1/49, so total probability is 6/49.

But earlier, I thought about the 3 columns and 4 rows, so 12 possible (column, row) pairs, 6 shaded. So, 6/12=1/2. But that was a different approach.

But which is correct? Is each (column, row) pair equally likely, or are the shaded squares equally likely?

Wait, in reality, each column is equally likely, each row is equally likely, so each (column, row) pair is equally likely, each with probability 1/49. So, the probability that the checker is on a shaded square is 6/49.

But wait, when I think of it, the columns are determined by the first spin divided by 4, so each column 1,2,3 has equal probability of 1/3, and each row 1,2,3,4 has equal probability of 1/4, so each (column, row) pair is equally likely with probability 1/12. Wait, no.

Wait, no, the first spin is divided by 4, so column 1,2,3 each have probability 1/3, because 7 numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, when divided by 4, give 1,2,3,1,2,3,1. So, the remainders 1,2,3 each occur 3 times, so each column has probability 3/7. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the first spin is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. When divided by 4, the remainders are:

- 1: remainder 1
- 2: remainder 2
- 3: remainder 3
- 4: remainder 0
- 5: remainder 1
- 6: remainder 2
- 7: remainder 3

Therefore, the remainders and their frequencies:

- Remainder 1: occurs on numbers 1,5 (2 times)
- Remainder 2: occurs on numbers 2,6 (2 times)
- Remainder 3: occurs on numbers 3,7 (2 times)
- Remainder 0: occurs on number 4 (1 time)

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, the first remainder (column) is 1,2,3, each with 2 counts, and 0 (remainder 4) with 1 count. So, the probability for each column:

- Column 1: 2/7
- Column 2: 2/7
- Column 3: 2/7
- Column 0: 1/7

Similarly, the second spin is divided by 5, so the remainders are 1,2,3,4, each with 1 occurrence, so each row has probability 1/7.

Therefore, the probability of each (column, row) pair is:

- Column 1: 2/7
- Column 2: 2/7
- Column 3: 2/7
- Row 1: 1/7
- Row 2: 1/7
- Row 3: 1/7
- Row 4: 1/7

Therefore, the probability of each (column, row) pair is (2/7)*(1/7)=2/49 for columns 1,2,3 and (1/7)*(1/7)=1/49 for each row.

So, the probability of each (column, row) pair is:

- (1,1): 2/49
- (1,2): 2/49
- (1,3): 2/49
- (1,4): 1/49
- (2,1): 2/49
- (2,2): 2/49
- (2,3): 2/49
- (2,4): 1/49
- (3,1): 2/49
- (3,2): 2/49
- (3,3): 2/49
- (3,4): 1/49

Therefore, the shaded squares are:

1. (3,0): Wait, hold on, (3,0) isn't a valid row. The rows are 1,2,3,4. So, (3,0) is row 0, which doesn't exist. So, actually, none of the shaded squares are in row 0.

Wait, looking back at the Asymptote code, the shaded squares are at:

1. (3,0): which is column 3, row 0. If row 0 doesn't exist, then perhaps it's a typo or misinterpretation.

Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is using a different coordinate system. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the first spin is divided by 4, giving 1,2,3, and the second spin divided by 5, giving 1,2,3,4.

So, the first spin, column, is 1,2,3, each with probability 1/3.

The second spin, row, is 1,2,3,4, each with probability 1/4.

Therefore, the probability of each (column, row) pair is (1/3)*(1/4)=1/12.

Therefore, each (column, row) pair has equal probability of 1/12. So, the probability that the checker is on a shaded square is equal to the number of shaded (column, row) pairs times 1/12.

But, in the Asymptote code, the shaded squares are:

1. (3,0): column 3, row 0. If row 0 doesn't exist, maybe it's a scaling issue.

Wait, perhaps the Asymptote code is using a different coordinate system where row 0 is actually row 4.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, the grid goes from (3,0) to (6,-2). So, the y-axis is inverted. So, (3,0) is the bottom-left, (6,0) is the top-left, (3,-2) is the bottom-right, and (6,-2) is the top-right.

So, in this coordinate system, row 1 is the bottom row, row 4 is the top row.

Therefore, (3,0) is column 3, row 1.

Similarly, (3,-2) is column 3, row 4.

Similarly, (4,1) is column 4, row 1.

(4,-1) is column 4, row 3.

(5,0) is column 5, row 1.

(5,-2) is column 5, row 3.

So, now, the shaded squares are at:

1. (3,0): column 3, row 1
2. (3,-2): column 3, row 4
3. (4,1): column 4, row 1
4. (4,-1): column 4, row 3
5. (5,0): column 5, row 1
6. (5,-2): column 5, row 3

So, 6 shaded squares, each at different (column, row) pairs.

Therefore, since each (column, row) pair has equal probability of 1/12, the probability that the checker is on a shaded square is 6*(1/12)=1/2.

Wait, but hold on. Is each (column, row) pair equally likely?

Wait, initially, I thought each column is equally likely (1/3) and each row is equally likely (1/4), so each (column, row) pair is equally likely with probability 1/12.

But in reality, the first spin, which determines the column, is divided by 4, so column 1,2,3 have 2 numbers each, so probability 2/7 for each column.

Wait, now this is confusing.

Wait, let me clarify:

First spin: possible remainders when divided by 4: 1,2,3,0 (but 0 is equivalent to 4). So, column 1,2,3,4, each with probability 2/7? Wait, no.

Wait, the wheel has numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

When you spin the wheel, the first number is divided by 4, so the possible remainders are 0,1,2,3.

But in the Asymptote code, it's labeled 1,2,3,4, so perhaps 1,2,3 correspond to remainders 1,2,3, and 0 is labeled as 4.

Wait, that would make the first number divided by 4, so the remainders are 0,1,2,3, but in this case, the labels are 1,2,3,4, meaning that 0 is labeled as 4.

So, actually, when the first spin is done, the possible remainders are 1,2,3,4, each with equal probability, because 0 is just another label. So, each remainder 1,2,3,4 is equally likely, each with probability 1/4.

Wait, but the numbers on the wheel are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. When divided by 4, the remainders can be 0,1,2,3.

But 0 occurs only when the number is 4.

So, the probability of remainder 1: numbers 1,5 (two numbers)
Remainder 2: numbers 2,6 (two numbers)
Remainder 3: numbers 3,7 (two numbers)
Remainder 0: number 4 (one number)

So, each remainder 1,2,3 has probability 2/7, and remainder 0 has probability 1/7.

Therefore, the probability of each column is:

- Column 1: 2/7
- Column 2: 2/7
- Column 3: 2/7
- Column 0: 1/7

Similarly, the second spin is divided by 5, so remainders 1,2,3,4 each have probability 1/5.

So, the probability of each (column, row) pair is:

- For columns 1,2,3: 2/7 each
- For column 0: 1/7
- For rows 1,2,3,4: 1/5 each

So, the probability of each (column, row) pair is:

- For (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4): 2/7 * 1/5 = 2/35
- Similarly for (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4): 2/35
- For (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4): 2/35
- For (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4): 1/35

Therefore, the probability of each (column, row) pair is:

- 2/35 for columns 1,2,3 and rows 1,2,3,4
- 1/35 for column 0 and rows 1,2,3,4

So, the shaded squares are:

1. (3,0): column 3, row 0. But column 0 is the label for remainder 0, which is different from column 3. So, (3,0) is column 3, row 0, which doesn't exist. So, in reality, this shaded square is column 3, row 0, which is row 0, which doesn't exist. Therefore, is this shaded square actually present? It depends on how the grid is drawn.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawn from (3,0) to (6,-2). So, row 0 is actually the bottom row, so (3,0) is the bottom-left corner. However, in the grid, (3,0) is column 3, row 0, but row 0 is an imaginary row below the actual grid.

Wait, perhaps the Asymptote code is using a different coordinate system where row 0 is the bottom, but in the Asymptote code, the grid is drawn with (3,0) to (6,-2), which is a rectangle from (3,0) to (6,2). So, row 0 is at the bottom, row 2 at the top.

But in the Asymptote code, the shaded squares are at (3,0), (3,-2), etc. So, (3,0) is at the bottom-left, (3,-2) is at the bottom-right, (4,1) is at the top-left, (4,-1) is at the top-right, (5,0) is at the bottom-center, and (5,-2) is at the top-center.

So, if the grid is drawn from (3,0) to (6,2), then the rows are labeled from top to bottom. So, (3,0) is the bottom-left, (4,1) is the top-left, (5,0) is the bottom-center, (4,-1) is the top-center, (3,1) is the top-right, and (6,-2) is the top-right.

Wait, this is getting too confusing without seeing the actual image. Maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the Asymptote code is not showing the actual grid but is just an illustration. So, perhaps I should ignore the coordinates and focus on the fact that the shaded squares are six in total, each corresponding to a unique (column, row) pair.

Given that, if each (column, row) pair is equally likely, then each has probability 1/12. So, 6 shaded pairs would give 6/12=1/2.

Alternatively, if each column is equally likely and each row is equally likely, then each (column, row) pair has probability 1/3 * 1/4=1/12, so again 6/12=1/2.

But in the first approach, I thought that the first spin is 1,2,3,4, each with probability 1/4, but actually, the first spin has 7 numbers, so the remainders 1,2,3,0 each have probabilities 2/7, 2/7, 2/7, 1/7.

Therefore, the probability of each (column, row) pair is:

- For columns 1,2,3: 2/7 each, and rows 1,2,3,4: 1/4 each.

Wait, no, rows are determined by the second spin divided by 5, so rows 1,2,3,4 each with probability 1/4.

Therefore, each (column, row) pair has probability (2/7) * (1/4)=2/28=1/14 for columns 1,2,3, and (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28 for column 0.

So, the probability of each (column, row) pair is:

- (1,1): 1/14
- (1,2): 1/14
- (1,3): 1/14
- (1,4): 1/28
- (2,1): 1/14
- (2,2): 1/14
- (2,3): 1/14
- (2,4): 1/28
- (3,1): 1/14
- (3,2): 1/14
- (3,3): 1/14
- (3,4): 1/28
- (0,1): 1/28
- (0,2): 1/14
- (0,3): 1/28
- (0,4): 1/28

Wait, that doesn't add up. The total probability should be 1.

Wait, maybe I need to compute the total probability.

So, for columns 1,2,3:

Each has 3 pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). So, 12 pairs, each with probability 1/14 or 1/28.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the total probability:

Total probability = sum over all (column, row) pairs [P(column) * P(row)]

For column 1,2,3:

P(column) = 2/7 each

P(row) = 1/4 each

Therefore, P((column, row)) = (2/7)*(1/4)=1/14 for columns 1,2,3, and (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28 for column 0.

Similarly, rows 1,2,3,4:

P(row)=1/4 each

For row 1,2,3:

P((column, row))= (2/7)*(1/4)=1/14 each

For row 4:

P((column, row))= (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28 each

Therefore, for each (column, row):

- (1,1): 1/14
- (1,2): 1/14
- (1,3): 1/14
- (1,4): 1/28
- (2,1): 1/14
- (2,2): 1/14
- (2,3): 1/14
- (2,4): 1/28
- (3,1): 1/14
- (3,2): 1/14
- (3,3): 1/14
- (3,4): 1/28
- (0,1): 1/28
- (0,2): 1/14
- (0,3): 1/28
- (0,4): 1/28

Now, let's compute the total probability:

Compute the sum of all these probabilities:

For columns 1,2,3:

Each has 1/14 * 3 = 3/14

Each has 1/28 for row 4, and there are 3 such rows: 3*(1/28)=3/28

For column 0:

Each has 1/28 for rows 1,2,3: 3*(1/28)=3/28

And 1/28 for row 4: 1/28

Wait, no, row 4 is separate.

Wait, row 4 is only one row, so for row 4:

Each (column, row 4) has probability 1/28 for column 1,2,3, and 1/28 for column 0.

So, (1,4): 1/28, (2,4):1/28, (3,4):1/28, (0,4):1/28

So, total for row 4:

3*(1/28) +1*(1/28)=4/28=1/7

Therefore, total for all columns:

Columns 1,2,3:

Each has 3/14, so total for columns 1,2,3: 3*(3/14)=9/14

Row 4:

Total probability: 4/28=1/7

Plus column 0:

Column 0 has 4/28=1/7

Therefore, total probability:

9/14 +1/7 +1/7=9/14 +2/7=9/14 +4/14=13/14

Wait, that can't be, because the total probability should be 1.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the breakdown.

Wait, columns 1,2,3:

Each column has 3 (column, row) pairs with probability 1/14 each, so 3*(1/14)=3/14 per column.

Therefore, columns 1,2,3: 3*(3/14)=9/14

Row 4:

Each (column, row4) has probability 1/28, so 3*1/28=3/28 for columns 1,2,3, and (0,4) has 1/28. So, total for row4: 4/28=1/7

Column 0:

Each (column0, row) has probability 1/28, so 4/28=1/7

Therefore, total probability:

9/14 (columns1-3) +1/7 (row4) +1/7 (column0)=9/14 +2/7=13/14

But that's still less than 1.

Wait, something is wrong here. It must be because the initial probabilities are not correctly calculated.

Wait, let me try a different approach.

Since the first spin determines the column with probabilities 2/7,2/7,2/7,1/7, and the second spin determines the row with probabilities 1/4,1/4,1/4,1/4.

Therefore, the probability of each (column, row) pair is (2/7)*(1/4)=1/14 for columns 1,2,3, and (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28 for column 0.

So, each (column, row) pair is:

- (1,1):1/14
- (1,2):1/14
- (1,3):1/14
- (1,4):1/28
- (2,1):1/14
- (2,2):1/14
- (2,3):1/14
- (2,4):1/28
- (3,1):1/14
- (3,2):1/14
- (3,3):1/14
- (3,4):1/28
- (0,1):1/28
- (0,2):1/14
- (0,3):1/28
- (0,4):1/28

Now, the total probability is:

Sum over all pairs [P(column) * P(row)] = sum over columns [3*(1/14) + 1*(1/28)] + sum over rows [3*(1/14) +1*(1/28)].

Wait, no. For columns 1,2,3:

Each has 3 pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). So, P((1,1))=1/14, P((1,2))=1/14, P((1,3))=1/14, P((1,4))=1/28.

Similarly for columns 2,3.

For row 4, it's similar.

But I think I'm overcomplicating. Maybe instead, note that each column is equally likely, each row is equally likely, so each (column, row) pair is equally likely with probability 1/(number of columns * number of rows)=1/(3*4)=1/12.

Therefore, the probability is 6*(1/12)=1/2.

But earlier, I thought about calculating the actual probabilities based on the number of favorable outcomes over total outcomes, which gave me 6/49.

Wait, so now I'm confused because two different approaches are giving me different answers: 1/2 and 6/49.

Wait, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it properly.

First, the total number of possible outcomes is 7*7=49.

The number of favorable outcomes is 6, each corresponding to a shaded square.

Therefore, the probability is 6/49.

But the issue is whether each (column, row) pair is equally likely.

If each column is equally likely (since the first spin is divided by 4, with remainders 1,2,3,4, each with probability 2/7,2/7,2/7,1/7), and each row is equally likely (divided by 5, each remainder 1,2,3,4 with probability 1/4), then the probability of each (column, row) pair is (2/7)*(1/4)=1/14 for columns 1,2,3, and (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28 for column 0.

Therefore, the probability of each (column, row) pair is not equal.

Therefore, the total probability is not 6*(1/12)=1/2, but rather:

Compute P = sum_{(column, row)} P(column, row)

= sum_{columns} sum_{rows} P(column) * P(row)

= sum_{columns} [P(column) * (1/4)] + sum_{columns} [P(column) * (1/4)] + sum_{columns} [P(column) * (1/4)] + sum_{columns} [P(column) * (1/4)]

Wait, no.

Wait, actually, rows are 1,2,3,4.

So, for each column, sum over rows:

sum_{rows} P(column, row) = P(column)*P(row1) + P(column)*P(row2) + P(column)*P(row3) + P(column)*P(row4)

= P(column)*(1/4 +1/4 +1/4 +1/4)=P(column)

Therefore, for each column, the total probability is 1. So, for three columns, the total probability is 3*1=3, but that can't be.

Wait, no, because each (column, row) pair is independent.

Wait, no, no, wait. The probability that the column is column i is P(column=i)=sum_{rows} P(column=i, row)=sum_{rows} P(column=i)*P(row)=P(column=i). So, P(column=i)=1/4 for i=1,2,3, and P(column=0)=1/7.

Similarly, for each row, P(row=j)=1/4.

Therefore, for each (column, row) pair, P(column=i, row=j)=P(column=i)*P(row=j)=1/4*1/4=1/16 for i=1,2,3,4.

Wait, no, wait, for column 1,2,3: P(column=i)=1/4, and for row j: P(row=j)=1/4, so P((i,j))=1/4*1/4=1/16 for i=1,2,3,4.

For column 0: P(column=0)=1/7, so P((0,j))=1/7*1/4=1/28 for each row j=1,2,3,4.

Therefore, the probability of each (column, row) pair:

- (1,1):1/16
- (1,2):1/16
- (1,3):1/16
- (1,4):1/28
- (2,1):1/16
- (2,2):1/16
- (2,3):1/16
- (2,4):1/28
- (3,1):1/16
- (3,2):1/16
- (3,3):1/16
- (3,4):1/28
- (0,1):1/28
- (0,2):1/16
- (0,3):1/28
- (0,4):1/28

Now, let's calculate the total probability:

Total probability = sum over all (column, row) pairs [P(column) * P(row)]

For columns 1,2,3:

Each has 3 (row) pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). So, 12 pairs.

Each pair has probability 1/16 for columns 1,2,3 and 1/28 for column 0.

Therefore, for columns 1,2,3:

Each has 3 pairs with 1/16 and 3 pairs with 1/28.

So, for each column i=1,2,3:

P = 3*(1/16) + 3*(1/28) = 3/16 + 3/28

Similarly, for column 0:

P = 4*(1/28)=4/28=1/7

Therefore, total probability:

P_total = 3*(3/16 +3/28) +1/7

Compute:

3*(3/16 +3/28) = 3*(21/56 + 6/56)=3*(27/56)=81/56

Plus 1/7=8/56

So, total P_total=81/56 +8/56=89/56≈1.589, which is more than 1. That can't be.

Wait, something's wrong here.

Wait, in reality, the probability must sum to 1.

Wait, maybe an error in the way I'm computing the probabilities.

Wait, in reality, the first spin is 1,2,3,4, each with probabilities 2/7,2/7,2/7,1/7.

The second spin is 1,2,3,4 each with probability 1/4.

So, for each (column, row) pair, the probability is:

For columns 1,2,3: (2/7)*(1/4)=2/28=1/14 each.

For column 0: (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28 each.

For rows 1,2,3,4:

For row 1,2,3: (2/7)*(1/4)=2/28=1/14 each.

For row 4:

(2/7)*(1/4)=2/28=1/14, plus (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28.

So, row 4 has probability 1/14 +1/28=3/28.

Wait, no, let's recast:

Wait, for row j=1,2,3:

Each (column, row) pair has probability P(column)*P(row)=2/7*1/4=2/28=1/14.

For row j=4:

Each (column, row) pair has probability P(column)*P(row)=2/7*1/4=2/28 for columns 1,2,3, and 1/7*1/4=1/28 for column 0.

Therefore, for row j=1,2,3:

Each (column, row) pair:1/14

For row j=4:

Each (column, row) pair: (1/14 for columns 1,2,3), (1/28 for column 0)

Therefore, the total probability:

Columns 1,2,3:

Each has 3 (row) pairs, each with 1/14. So, 3*(1/14)=3/14

Plus 1 pair with row4:1/28

Similarly, columns 2,3:

Same as column1.

Column0:

Each has 3 (row) pairs with1/14 and 1 pair with row4:1/28

Therefore, total probability:

3*(3/14 +1/28) +1*(3/14 +1/28)

Compute:

3*(3/14 +1/28)=3*(6/28 +1/28)=3*(7/28)=21/28=3/4

Plus 1*(3/14 +1/28)=1*(6/28 +1/28)=1*(7/28)=1/4

Total probability=3/4 +1/4=1

Perfect, that sums to 1.

So, now, the probability of each (column, row) pair is:

- For columns 1,2,3:

Each has 3 pairs with probability1/14 and 1 pair with1/28.

So, P((1,1))=P((1,2))=P((1,3))=1/14, and P((1,4))=1/28.

Similarly, columns2,3 have the same.

For column0, P((0,1))=P((0,2))=P((0,3))=1/14, and P((0,4))=1/28.

Therefore, the shaded squares are:

1. (3,0): column3, row0. So, column3, row0.

2. (3,-2): column3, row-2.

3. (4,1): column4, row1.

4. (4,-1): column4, row3.

5. (5,0): column5, row0.

6. (5,-2): column5, row-2.

So, (3,0), (3,-2), (4,1), (4,-1), (5,0), and (5,-2).

Now, let's compute the probability of each shaded square.

Assuming each (column, row) pair is equally likely, each has probability 1/12.

Therefore, the probability that the checker is on a shaded square is 6*(1/12)=1/2.

But wait, in reality, the probability isn't uniform. Some (column, row) pairs have higher probability.

For columns 1,2,3:

Each has 12 pairs, but some have 1/14 and some have1/28.

Wait, no, in reality, each (column, row) pair has a different probability. So, actually, (3,0) has probability1/28, (3,-2) has probability1/28, etc.

Wait, no, each (column, row) pair has a unique probability. So, (3,0) has probability1/28, (3,-2) has probability1/28, (4,1) has probability1/14, (4,-1) has probability1/14, (5,0) has probability1/28, (5,-2) has probability1/28.

So, the shaded squares are:

1. (3,0):1/28

2. (3,-2):1/28

3. (4,1):1/14

4. (4,-1):1/14

5. (5,0):1/28

6. (5,-2):1/28

Therefore, the total probability is:

1/28 +1/28 +1/14 +1/14 +1/28 +1/28

Convert all to 28 denominators:

1 +1 +2 +2 +1 +1=8

So, total probability=8/28=2/7.

Wait, so that's different from 1/2.

Wait, so which is correct?

If the columns and rows are not equally likely, then the probability of being on a shaded square is 2/7, not 1/2.

But in reality, the columns and rows are determined by the first and second spins.

So, first spin: 7 numbers, each column 1,2,3,4 with probabilities 2/7, 2/7, 2/7, 1/7.

Second spin: 4 numbers, each row1,2,3,4 with probability1/4.

Therefore, the probability of each (column, row) pair is:

For columns 1,2,3: (2/7)*(1/4)=2/28=1/14

For column 0: (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28

For rows1,2,3: (2/7)*(1/4)=1/14

For row4: (2/7)*(1/4)=1/14 for columns1,2,3 and (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28 for column0.

Wait, no:

Wait, for each (column, row) pair, the probability is:

- For columns 1,2,3:

  Each (column, row) pair: (2/7)*(1/4)=1/14

- For column0:

  Each (column, row) pair: (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28

- For rows1,2,3,4:

  For rows1,2,3: Each (column, row) pair: (2/7)*(1/4)=1/14

  For row4: Each (column, row) pair: (2/7)*(1/4)=1/14 for columns1,2,3 and (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28 for column0.

Wait, no, for row4:

Each (column, row) pair has probability (2/7)*(1/4)=1/14 for columns1,2,3 and (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28 for column0.

Wait, no, it's actually:

For row4:

Each (column, row) pair:

- If column is1,2,3: (2/7)*(1/4)=1/14

- If column is0: (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28

Therefore, for row4, we have:

- (0,4):1/28

- (1,4):1/14

- (2,4):1/14

- (3,4):1/14

Similarly, for rows1,2,3:

- (1,1):1/14

- (1,2):1/14

- (1,3):1/14

- (1,4):1/28

And same for rows2,3.

Therefore, the total probability of each shaded square is:

1. (3,0):1/28

2. (3,-2):1/28

3. (4,1):1/14

4. (4,-1):1/14

5. (5,0):1/28

6. (5,-2):1/28

So, sum them up:

1/28 +1/28 +1/14 +1/14 +1/28 +1/28

Convert to 28 denominators:

1 +1 +2 +2 +1 +1=8

So, total probability=8/28=2/7.

Therefore, the probability is2/7.

But now, that contradicts the earlier logic where I thought each (column, row) pair had equal probability.

So, which is right?

Wait, since the first spin is not uniform over the columns, and the second spin is not uniform over the rows, the (column, row) pairs are not equally likely.

Therefore, each (column, row) pair has different probabilities.

Hence, the shaded squares have different probabilities.

Therefore, the probability that the checker is on a shaded square is2/7.

But then, why did I think earlier that each (column, row) pair had equal probability?

Because I assumed that the first spin and second spin were uniform, but they aren't.

Therefore, the correct probability is2/7.

But earlier, when I thought each (column, row) pair had equal probability, I got1/2, but now, accounting for the fact that columns and rows aren't equally likely, I get2/7.

So, which is it?

Wait, the problem says the wheel is spun twice, so the first spin is one number, which determines the column, and the second spin is another number, which determines the row.

Therefore, the probability of each (column, row) pair is:

- For columns1,2,3: (2/7)*(1/4)=1/14 each

- For column0: (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28 each

- For rows1,2,3: (2/7)*(1/4)=1/14 each

- For row4: (2/7)*(1/4)=1/14 for columns1,2,3 and (1/7)*(1/4)=1/28 for column0.

Therefore, shaded squares:

1. (3,0):1/28

2. (3,-2):1/28

3. (4,1):1/14

4. (4,-1):1/14

5. (5,0):1/28

6. (5,-2):1/28

Total probability=8/28=2/7.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of the total number of possible outcomes:

The total number of possible pairs (first spin, second spin) is7*7=49.

The number of favorable outcomes is the number of pairs where the (column, row) pair is shaded.

Shaded squares are:

1. (3,0):1

2. (3,-2):1

3. (4,1):1

4. (4,-1):1

5. (5,0):1

6. (5,-2):1

So, 6 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, probability=6/49.

But wait, earlier, I thought that each (column, row) pair had different probabilities, but in reality, since the first spin isn't uniform, the (column, row) pairs aren't equally likely, so the number of favorable outcomes isn't6, but the probability is6/49.

Wait, but no, because each (column, row) pair has different probability, so the total probability isn't 6/49.

Wait, confusion.

Wait, no, actually, the probability of being on a shaded square is the sum over each shaded square of the probability of that square.

Since each shaded square is a unique (column, row) pair, and we've already calculated the probability of each, which are:

1. (3,0):1/28

2. (3,-2):1/28

3. (4,1):1/14

4. (4,-1):1/14

5. (5,0):1/28

6. (5,-2):1/28

So, adding them up:

1/28 +1/28 +1/14 +1/14 +1/28 +1/28= (1+1+2+2+1+1)/28=8/28=2/7.

Therefore, the probability is2/7.

Therefore, the answer should be2/7.

But I initially thought it was1/2, but that was incorrect because I assumed uniform probabilities for (column, row) pairs, which isn't the case.

Therefore, the correct answer is2/7.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results based on different approaches.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first approach.

Wait, let me think again.

First spin:7 numbers, two possible remainders:0,1,2,3, each with probabilities1/3,2/7,2/7,2/7,1/7.

Second spin:4 numbers, two possible remainders:1,2,3,4 each with probability1/4.

Therefore, the probability that the checker is on a shaded square is equal to the sum over all shaded squares of P(column, row).

Each shaded square is a unique (column, row) pair.

Therefore, the probability is sum_{shaded} P(column, row).

We have six shaded squares:

1. (3,0): P=1/28

2. (3,-2): P=1/28

3. (4,1): P=1/14

4. (4,-1): P=1/14

5. (5,0): P=1/28

6. (5,-2): P=1/28

Therefore, sum is:

1/28 +1/28 +1/14 +1/14 +1/28 +1/28 = (1+1+2+2+1+1)/28=8/28=2/7.

Therefore, the probability is2/7.

Hence, the answer is2/7.

**Final Answer**
The probability that the checker is on a shaded square is \boxed{\dfrac{2}{7}}.

The wheel is spun twice, resulting in a checker that moves based on the remainders of the column and row divisions. The wheel has 7 numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), which when divided by 4, give remainders: 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3. This results in probabilities for the column (1, 2, 3, 4) as 2/7, 2/7, 2/7, 1/7 respectively. The wheel also has 7 numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), which when divided by 5, give remainders: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3. This results in probabilities for the row (1, 2, 3, 4) as 1/4 each.

The shaded squares are determined by the checker landing on columns 3 or 4 and rows 0, 1, or 2. The probability of landing on a shaded square is calculated by summing the probabilities of each shaded (column, row) pair.

The probabilities for each shaded (column, row) pair are:
- (3, 0): 1/28
- (3, -2): 1/28
- (4, 1): 1/14
- (4, -1): 1/14
- (5, 0): 1/28
- (5, -2): 1/28

Summing these probabilities:
\[
\frac{1}{28} + \frac{1}{28} + \frac{1}{14} + \frac{1}{14} + \frac{1}{28} + \frac{1}{28} = \frac{8}{28} = \frac{2}{7}
\]

Thus, the probability that the checker is on a shaded square is \boxed{\dfrac{2}{7}}.
