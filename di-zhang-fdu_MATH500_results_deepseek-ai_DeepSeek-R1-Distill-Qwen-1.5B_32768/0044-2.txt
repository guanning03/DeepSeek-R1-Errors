Question:
Let $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ be vectors such that the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is $29^\circ,$ and the angle between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $84^\circ.$  Find the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}.$

Correct Answer:
Since $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b},$ and $\mathbf{a-b}$ all lie in the same plane, from the diagram below, we see that the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is $84^\circ - 29^\circ = \boxed{55^\circ}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I've got this vector problem here, and I need to figure out the angle between vectors **a** and **a** - **b**. Let me jot down the given information to get a clear picture.

First, we know that the angle between vectors **a** and **b** is 29 degrees. That's straightforward. Then, the angle between vector **b** and (**a** - **b**) is 84 degrees. My goal is to find the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**). Hmm, okay.

Let me visualize this. I have vectors **a** and **b** forming a 29-degree angle. Then, vector (**a** - **b**) is another vector, and it makes an 84-degree angle with **b**. I need to find the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**). 

Hmm, maybe I can use the dot product formula here. The dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them. So, if I can express (**a** - **b**) in terms of **a** and **b**, maybe I can set up equations using the dot products.

Let me denote some variables to make things clearer. Let’s say:

- |**a**| is the magnitude of vector **a**. Let’s call this as A.
- |**b**| is the magnitude of vector **b**. Let’s call this as B.
- The angle between **a** and **b** is 29 degrees, so their dot product is **a** · **b** = A * B * cos(29°).
- The angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**) is 84 degrees, so **b** · (**a** - **b**) = B * |**a** - **b**| * cos(84°).
- Finally, I need to find the angle θ between **a** and (**a** - **b**), so **a** · (**a** - **b**) = A * |**a** - **b**| * cosθ.

Alright, so let me write down these equations.

First, **a** · **b** = A * B * cos(29°). Let's note that as Equation (1).

Second, **b** · (**a** - **b**) = B * |**a** - **b**| * cos(84°). Let me expand this dot product:

**b** · (**a** - **b**) = **b** · **a** - **b** · **b** = (**a** · **b**) - |**b**|².

So, substituting the known value, we have:

(**a** · **b**) - |**b**|² = B * |**a** - **b**| * cos(84°).

From Equation (1), (**a** · **b**) is A * B * cos(29°). So:

A * B * cos(29°) - B² = B * |**a** - **b**| * cos(84°).

Hmm, let me factor out B on the left side:

B (A * cos(29°) - B) = B * |**a** - **b**| * cos(84°).

Assuming B is not zero (which it can't be, since it's a vector), I can divide both sides by B:

A * cos(29°) - B = |**a** - **b**| * cos(84°).

Let me denote |**a** - **b**| as C for simplicity. So, Equation (2) becomes:

A * cos(29°) - B = C * cos(84°).

Now, I need another equation involving A, B, and C to solve for the angle θ between **a** and (**a** - **b**). From the third equation, which is the dot product for θ:

**a** · (**a** - **b**) = A * C * cosθ. Let's compute this dot product:

**a** · (**a** - **b**) = **a** · **a** - **a** · **b** = A² - (**a** · **b**) = A² - A * B * cos(29°).

So, Equation (3) is:

A² - A * B * cos(29°) = A * C * cosθ.

Divide both sides by A (assuming A ≠ 0):

A - B * cos(29°) = C * cosθ.

Let me note this as Equation (4):

A - B * cos(29°) = C * cosθ.

So now, I have Equations (2) and (4):

Equation (2): A * cos(29°) - B = C * cos(84°).

Equation (4): A - B * cos(29°) = C * cosθ.

So, now I have two equations with three variables: A, B, C. I need another relation to connect them. Hmm, perhaps using the Law of Cosines on triangle formed by vectors **a**, **b**, and (**a** - **b**).

Wait, actually, (**a** - **b**) is the difference of vectors **a** and **b**, so geometrically, if I imagine vectors **a** and **b** with an angle of 29 degrees between them, then (**a** - **b**) is another vector whose magnitude and direction can be determined based on **a** and **b**.

But maybe it's better to use the Law of Cosines in triangle formed by **a**, **b**, and (**a** - **b**). Wait, actually, in triangle, the sides would be |**a**|, |**b**|, and |**a** - **b**|, but the angle between **a** and **a** - **b** is what I'm trying to find. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the triangle with sides |**a**|, |**b**|, and |**a** - **b**|, with angles as given.

Wait, but actually, the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) in the triangle would be the angle at the origin between **a** and (**a** - **b**), which is θ, that's what we need to find.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Law of Cosines on the triangle formed by vectors **a**, **b**, and (**a** - **b**). Let me think.

Wait, another approach is to express C in terms of A and B from Equation (2) and substitute into Equation (4). Let me try that.

From Equation (2):

C = (A * cos29° - B) / cos84°.

So I can substitute this into Equation (4):

A - B * cos29° = (A * cos29° - B) / cos84° * cosθ.

Let me write this as:

A - B * cos29° = (A * cos29° - B) * (cosθ / cos84°).

Hmm, now I have an equation involving A, B, and θ.

Let me denote cos29° as c for simplicity, and cos84° as d for simplification. So, c = cos29°, d = cos84°, and the equation becomes:

A - Bc = (A c - B) * (cosθ / d).

I can rearrange this equation to solve for cosθ.

First, let's bring all terms involving A and B to one side.

A - Bc - (A c - B) * (cosθ / d) = 0.

Let me factor this expression. It might be a bit messy, but let me try:

A (1 - (c cosθ / d)) + B ( - c + (cosθ / d)) = 0.

Hmm, so:

A [1 - (c cosθ / d)] + B [ - c + (cosθ / d)] = 0.

I can write this as:

A [ (d - c cosθ) / d ] + B [ ( - c d + cosθ ) / d ] = 0.

Multiplying both sides by d:

A (d - c cosθ) + B ( - c d + cosθ ) = 0.

Hmm, so:

A (d - c cosθ) + B (cosθ - c d) = 0.

Let me factor this:

A (d - c cosθ) = B (c d - cosθ).

So:

A / B = (c d - cosθ) / (d - c cosθ).

Let me denote k = A / B, so:

k = (c d - cosθ) / (d - c cosθ).

So, k is the ratio of A to B, which is the ratio of the magnitudes of vectors **a** and **b**.

Hmm, but I don't know k yet. Maybe I can find a relation for k from the given information.

Wait, let's go back to the Law of Cosines. The triangle formed by vectors **a**, **b**, and (**a** - **b**) has sides |**a**|, |**b**|, and |**a** - **b**|.

In such a triangle, the Law of Cosines applies as follows:

|**a** - **b**|² = |**a**|² + |**b**|² - 2 |**a**| |**b**| cos(angle between **a** and **b**).

Wait, but the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is θ, which is different from the angle between **a** and **b**.

Hmm, maybe not directly applicable. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Law of Cosines on triangle (**a** - **b**), **b**, **a**? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of vectors.

We have:

(**a** - **b**) · (**a** - **b**) = |**a** - **b**|² = |**a**|² + |**b**|² - 2 **a** · **b**.

Which is the same as:

C² = A² + B² - 2 A B cos29°.

So, that's another equation.

But I don't know if that's helpful yet.

Wait, so far I have:

1) A * cos29° - B = C * cos84°. (Equation 2)

2) A - B * cos29° = C * cosθ. (Equation 4)

3) C² = A² + B² - 2 A B cos29°. (Law of Cosines)

So, perhaps I can solve Equations 2 and 4 for A and B, and then substitute into Equation 3.

From Equation 2: C = (A cos29° - B) / cos84°.

From Equation 4: C = (A - B cos29°) / cosθ.

Therefore, (A cos29° - B) / cos84° = (A - B cos29°) / cosθ.

Cross-multiplying, we get:

(A cos29° - B) * cosθ = (A - B cos29°) * cos84°.

Let me expand both sides:

A cos29° cosθ - B cosθ = A cos84° - B cos29° cos84°.

Let me gather terms involving A and B on each side:

A cos29° cosθ - A cos84° = B cosθ - B cos29° cos84°.

Factor A and B:

A (cos29° cosθ - cos84°) = B (cosθ - cos29° cos84°).

Let me write this as:

(A / B) = [cosθ - cos29° cos84°] / [cos29° cosθ - cos84°].

Let me denote K = A / B, so:

K = [cosθ - cos29° cos84°] / [cos29° cosθ - cos84°].

Hmm, now, from Equation 1:

**a** · **b** = A B cos29°.

Which is equal to **a** · **b** = |**a**| |**b**| cos29°, which is the same as (**a** · **b**) = A B cos29°.

But I don't see an immediate connection to K. Maybe I can express K in terms of cosθ and other known quantities.

Wait, let me think about the Law of Cosines again.

From the Law of Cosines on the triangle formed by vectors **a**, **b**, and (**a** - **b**), the sides are |**a**|, |**b**|, and |**a** - **b**|.

So, the angles in this triangle are:

- Between **a** and (**a** - **b**): θ
- Between **b** and (**a** - **b**): 84°
- Between **a** and **b**: 29°

Therefore, the triangle has angles 29°, 84°, and θ, with sides |**a**|, |**b**|, and C.

Wait, so according to the Law of Sines, in any triangle, the ratio of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant.

So, in this triangle:

|**a**| / sin(angle opposite to |**a**|) = |**b**| / sin(angle opposite to |**b**|) = |**a** - **b**| / sin(angle opposite to |**a** - **b**|).

But the angles opposite the sides:

- The side |**a**| is opposite the angle at the vertex between **b** and (**a** - **b**). Wait, no, actually, in the triangle, the angle opposite to |**a**| would be the angle at the vertex where **b** and (**a** - **b**) meet, which is 84°, since that's the angle between **b** and (**a** - **b**).

Similarly, the angle opposite to |**b**| is 29°, since that's the angle between **a** and **b**.

And the angle opposite to |**a** - **b**| is θ, which is the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**).

Therefore, by the Law of Sines:

|**a**| / sin84° = |**b**| / sin29° = C / sinθ.

So, we have three equations:

1) |**a**| / sin84° = |**b**| / sin29°. Let's denote this as Equation (5).

2) |**a**| / sin84° = C / sinθ. Equation (6).

3) |**b**| / sin29° = C / sinθ. Equation (7).

Wait, hold on, from Equation (5), |**a**| / sin84° = |**b**| / sin29°. So, |**a**| = |**b**| * sin84° / sin29°. Let me compute sin84° and sin29°:

sin84° is approximately 0.994521895.

sin29° is approximately 0.48480962.

So, |**a**| ≈ |**b**| * 0.994521895 / 0.48480962 ≈ |**b**| * 2.050.

So, |**a**| ≈ 2.050 |**b**|.

Hmm, interesting. Let me note that as Equation (8): |**a**| ≈ 2.050 |**b**|.

Now, going back to Equation (6): |**a**| / sin84° = C / sinθ.

Similarly, from Equation (7): |**b**| / sin29° = C / sinθ.

So, from Equation (6) and (7), both equal to C / sinθ, so:

|**a**| / sin84° = |**b**| / sin29°.

But wait, that's exactly Equation (5), which is consistent.

So, that didn't give us new information.

Hmm, so maybe from Equation (6), we can express C as:

C = |**a**| * sinθ / sin84°.

Similarly, from Equation (7):

C = |**b**| * sinθ / sin29°.

Since both are equal to C, we can set them equal:

|**a**| * sinθ / sin84° = |**b**| * sinθ / sin29°.

Assuming sinθ ≠ 0 (which it isn't, since θ is an angle between vectors, hence between 0° and 180°), we can divide both sides by sinθ:

|**a**| / sin84° = |**b**| / sin29°.

Which is exactly Equation (5). So, again, consistent but not helpful.

Hmm, so perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, earlier, I had expressions for K in terms of θ, which is A / B. Maybe I can express K in terms of cosθ and constants.

From Equation (8), |**a**| ≈ 2.05 |**b**|, so K = A / B ≈ 2.05.

But that might be an approximation. Let me see if I can get an exact expression.

Wait, perhaps if I write K = A / B, then from Equation (2):

K cos29° - 1 = C cos84°.

And from Equation (4):

K - cos29° = C cosθ.

So, now I have two equations:

1) K cos29° - 1 = C cos84°.

2) K - cos29° = C cosθ.

Let me denote C as:

From Equation (2):

C = (K cos29° - 1) / cos84°.

From Equation (4):

C = (K - cos29°) / cosθ.

Therefore,

(K cos29° - 1) / cos84° = (K - cos29°) / cosθ.

Cross-multiplying:

(K cos29° - 1) cosθ = (K - cos29°) cos84°.

Let me expand both sides:

K cos29° cosθ - cosθ = K cos84° - cos29° cos84°.

Bring all terms involving K to one side and others to the opposite side:

K cos29° cosθ - K cos84° = cosθ - cos29° cos84°.

Factor out K:

K (cos29° cosθ - cos84°) = cosθ - cos29° cos84°.

So,

K = [cosθ - cos29° cos84°] / [cos29° cosθ - cos84°].

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Let me compute cos29° and cos84° approximately to see if I can compute the numerical value, but maybe that's not the way to go. Alternatively, perhaps I can express cos84° in terms of sin(90° - 84°) = sin6°, so cos84° = sin6°.

Similarly, cos29° is just cos29°, and sin6° is approximately 0.104528463.

Wait, but maybe leaving it in terms of cosines is better.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a trigonometric identity that can help me here.

Looking back at the expression for K:

K = [cosθ - cos29° cos84°] / [cos29° cosθ - cos84°].

Hmm, perhaps we can write cos84° as sin6°, so:

K = [cosθ - cos29° sin6°] / [cos29° cosθ - sin6°].

Wait, that might not help much. Alternatively, maybe I can express cos29° cosθ - sin6° as something else.

Wait, another idea: since K is A/B, which is the ratio of the magnitudes of vectors **a** and **b**, perhaps I can express this ratio in terms of the given angles.

Wait, going back to the Law of Cosines expression, we have:

C² = A² + B² - 2 A B cos29°.

But from Equation (2): C = (A cos29° - B) / cos84°.

So, substituting C into C²:

[(A cos29° - B) / cos84°]^2 = A² + B² - 2 A B cos29°.

Let me compute the left side:

(A cos29° - B)^2 / cos²84° = A² + B² - 2 A B cos29°.

Multiply both sides by cos²84°:

(A cos29° - B)^2 = (A² + B² - 2 A B cos29°) cos²84°.

Let me expand the left side:

A² cos²29° - 2 A B cos29° + B² = (A² + B² - 2 A B cos29°) cos²84°.

Bring all terms to one side:

A² cos²29° - 2 A B cos29° + B² - (A² + B² - 2 A B cos29°) cos²84° = 0.

Factor terms:

A² (cos²29° - cos²84°) + B² (1 - cos²84°) + (-2 A B cos29°) (1 - cos²84°) = 0.

Wait, let me expand it step by step:

First, expand the right side:

(A² + B² - 2 A B cos29°) cos²84° = A² cos²84° + B² cos²84° - 2 A B cos29° cos²84°.

So, moving this to the left side:

A² cos²29° - 2 A B cos29° + B² - A² cos²84° - B² cos²84° + 2 A B cos29° cos²84° = 0.

Now, let's group like terms:

A² (cos²29° - cos²84°) + B² (1 - cos²84°) + (-2 A B cos29° + 2 A B cos29° cos²84°) = 0.

Factor terms:

A² (cos²29° - cos²84°) + B² sin²84° + 2 A B cos29° (-1 + cos²84°) = 0.

Hmm, that seems complicated, but maybe we can factor further.

Let me note that cos²84° - sin²84° = cos(168°), but that might not be helpful here.

Alternatively, let me factor out terms:

Looking at the expression:

A² (cos²29° - cos²84°) + B² sin²84° + 2 A B cos29° (cos²84° - 1) = 0.

Note that cos²84° - 1 = -sin²84°, so:

A² (cos²29° - cos²84°) + B² sin²84° - 2 A B cos29° sin²84° = 0.

Hmm, this still looks messy.

Wait, perhaps using the identity cos²x - sin²x = cos2x. Let me see:

cos²29° - cos²84° = - (cos²84° - cos²29°) = - [ (cos84° - cos29°)(cos84° + cos29°) ].

Alternatively, maybe I can factor the expression as a quadratic in A or B.

Let me treat this as a quadratic equation in A:

A² (cos²29° - cos²84°) + A (-2 B cos29°) + B² sin²84° - 2 A B cos29° sin²84° = 0.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps if I factor out terms:

Looking at the entire expression:

A² (cos²29° - cos²84°) + B² sin²84° - 2 A B cos29° sin²84° = 0.

This is similar to A² (something) + B² (something else) - 2 A B (something else) = 0.

Wait, it resembles the form of (A cosθ - B sinθ)^2, but let me check:

(A cosθ - B sinθ)^2 = A² cos²θ - 2 A B cosθ sinθ + B² sin²θ.

Comparing to our expression:

A² (cos²29° - cos²84°) + B² sin²84° - 2 A B cos29° sin²84°.

Hmm, not the same, because the cosθ terms don't match. Instead, the coefficient of A² is cos²29° - cos²84°, and the coefficient of B² is sin²84°, and the cross term is -2 A B cos29° sin²84°.

Not quite matching (A cosθ - B sinθ)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps factor as (A cosφ - B)^2 - something.

Wait, another idea: maybe express the equation as (A cosφ - B)^2 = something.

Let me try:

Let me suppose that the expression A² (cos²29° - cos²84°) + B² sin²84° - 2 A B cos29° sin²84° can be written as (A cosφ - B)^2 - C.

Let me try expanding (A cosφ - B)^2:

= A² cos²φ - 2 A B cosφ + B².

Compare to our expression:

A² (cos²29° - cos²84°) + B² sin²84° - 2 A B cos29° sin²84°.

Hmm, not quite matching.

Wait, maybe if I set cosφ = sqrt(cos²29° - cos²84°), but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps think of it as a quadratic equation in A:

[cos²29° - cos²84°] A² - [2 cos29° sin²84°] A + [sin²84°] B² = 0.

Wait, that's a quadratic in A:

Let me denote:

M = cos²29° - cos²84°,

N = -2 cos29° sin²84°,

P = sin²84°.

So, the equation is:

M A² + N A + P B² = 0.

Hmm, perhaps we can solve for A in terms of B, or vice versa.

Using quadratic formula:

A = [ -N ± sqrt(N² - 4 M P) ] / (2 M).

But this might not be the best path.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to go back to the original problem and think differently.

We have three vectors: **a**, **b**, and (**a** - **b**). We know the angles between **a** and **b**, and between **b** and (**a** - **b**). We need to find the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**).

Wait, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle (**a** - **b**, **b**, **a**). So, in triangle (**a** - **b**, **b**, **a**), the sides are |**a**|, |**b**|, and |**a** - **b**|, with angles 29°, 84°, and θ between **a** and (**a** - **b**).

So, using the Law of Sines:

|**a**| / sin84° = |**b**| / sin29° = |**a** - **b**| / sinθ.

So, from this, we can write:

|**a**| = |**a** - **b**| * sin84° / sinθ,

and

|**b**| = |**a** - **b**| * sin29° / sinθ.

So, the ratio |**a**| / |**b**| = sin84° / sin29° ≈ 0.994521895 / 0.48480962 ≈ 2.050.

Which matches our earlier approximation.

So, |**a**| ≈ 2.050 |**b**|.

Now, going back to the expression for K:

K = A / B ≈ 2.050.

Wait, but K was defined as A / B, so that's consistent.

So, A ≈ 2.050 B.

Now, from Equation (2):

K cos29° - 1 = C cos84°.

So, substituting K ≈ 2.050:

2.050 * cos29° - 1 ≈ C cos84°.

Compute 2.050 * cos29°:

cos29° ≈ 0.8746197071,

2.050 * 0.8746197071 ≈ 1.789573328.

So, 1.789573328 - 1 ≈ 0.789573328 = C cos84°.

Compute cos84° ≈ 0.1045284633.

Therefore, C ≈ 0.789573328 / 0.1045284633 ≈ 7.546.

So, C ≈ 7.546.

Similarly, from Equation (4):

K - cos29° = C cosθ.

Substituting K ≈ 2.050, cos29° ≈ 0.8746197071, and C ≈ 7.546:

2.050 - 0.8746197071 ≈ 7.546 cosθ.

Compute 2.050 - 0.8746197071 ≈ 1.175380293 ≈ 7.546 cosθ.

Therefore, cosθ ≈ 1.175380293 / 7.546 ≈ 0.1559.

Therefore, θ ≈ arccos(0.1559) ≈ 81°.

Wait, so θ is approximately 81 degrees.

But let me verify the computations because sometimes approximations can lead to inaccuracies.

Wait, in Equation (2):

K = (A cos29° - B) / cos84°,

and K ≈ 2.050.

So, 2.050 = (A * 0.8746 - B) / 0.1045,

so 2.050 * 0.1045 ≈ 0.2143 ≈ 0.8746 A - B.

Similarly, in Equation (4):

K - cos29° = C cosθ,

so 2.050 - 0.8746 ≈ 1.1754 = C cosθ.

But C was found to be approximately 7.546.

So, 1.1754 ≈ 7.546 cosθ,

thus, cosθ ≈ 1.1754 / 7.546 ≈ 0.1559.

Therefore, θ ≈ arccos(0.1559) ≈ 81.2 degrees.

Hmm, so approximately 81.2°, which is close to 81°, but let me check if that's the exact value.

Wait, 81° is close, but let me see if we can find an exact value.

Wait, arccos(0.1559) is approximately 81.2°, which is roughly 81°, but maybe it's 81° exactly. Alternatively, perhaps it's 84°, but 0.1559 is closer to cos81°.

Wait, cos81° ≈ 0.1564, which is very close to 0.1559.

So, cosθ ≈ 0.1559 ≈ cos81°, so θ ≈ 81°.

Therefore, the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is approximately 81°, so the answer is 81 degrees.

Wait, but let me verify if this is exact.

Alternatively, perhaps with exact trigonometric identities, we can find θ.

Wait, going back to the Law of Cosines expression:

C² = A² + B² - 2 A B cos29°.

We have expressions for C from Equations (2) and (4). Let me substitute them into this.

From Equation (2): C = (A cos29° - B) / cos84°.

So, C² = (A cos29° - B)² / cos²84°.

Similarly, from Equation (4): C = (A - B cos29°) / cosθ.

So, C² = (A - B cos29°)² / cos²θ.

Therefore, equate both expressions:

(A cos29° - B)² / cos²84° = (A - B cos29°)² / cos²θ.

Cross-multiplying:

(A cos29° - B)² cos²θ = (A - B cos29°)² cos²84°.

Let me denote A cos29° - B as a term, say, let me set D = A cos29° - B.

Then, the equation becomes:

D² cos²θ = (A - B cos29°)² cos²84°.

But A - B cos29° is equal to (A cos29° - B) + B sin29°, because A - B cos29° can be written as A cos0° - B cos29°, which doesn't directly help, but perhaps another approach.

Wait, alternatively, let me write A - B cos29° as A cos0° - B cos29°, which is the dot product of **a** and (cos0°, sin0°) - **b** and (cos29°, sin29°). Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Wait, another idea: Let me express A - B cos29° in terms of D.

Wait, from D = A cos29° - B, so A = (D + B)/cos29°.

Substitute into A - B cos29°:

= (D + B)/cos29° - B cos29°.

= [D + B - B cos²29°]/cos29°.

Hmm, but this seems too convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps let me consider the ratio:

From D² cos²θ = (A - B cos29°)² cos²84°.

But from D = A cos29° - B, and A - B cos29° = A cos29° - B cos²29°, which is D cos29°.

Wait, because A - B cos29° = (A cos29° - B) cos29° + B (1 - cos²29°).

Wait, that seems complicated.

Wait, let me think again.

We have:

(A cos29° - B)² cos²θ = (A - B cos29°)² cos²84°.

So, let me write (A cos29° - B) as D, so:

D² cos²θ = (A - B cos29°)² cos²84°.

But (A - B cos29°) can be expressed as A(1 - cos29°) - B cos29°.

But not sure.

Wait, perhaps express A in terms of D:

From D = A cos29° - B,

A = (D + B)/cos29°.

Substitute into (A - B cos29°):

= (D + B)/cos29° - B cos29°

= [D + B - B cos²29°]/cos29°

So, it's [D + B(1 - cos²29°)] / cos29°

= [D + B sin²29°] / cos29°.

Hmm, but maybe not helpful.

Wait, going back to equation:

D² cos²θ = (A - B cos29°)^2 cos²84°.

But A - B cos29° = A cos29° - B cos²29° + B (1 - cos29°).

Wait, this seems too convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps let me consider:

Let me denote X = A / B, so K = X.

From Equation (2):

X cos29° - 1 = C cos84°.

From Equation (4):

X - cos29° = C cosθ.

So, from Equation (2):

C = (X cos29° - 1) / cos84°.

From Equation (4):

C = (X - cos29°) / cosθ.

Set equal:

(X cos29° - 1) / cos84° = (X - cos29°) / cosθ.

Cross-multiplying:

(X cos29° - 1) cosθ = (X - cos29°) cos84°.

Expand both sides:

X cos29° cosθ - cosθ = X cos84° - cos29° cos84°.

Bring all terms to one side:

X cos29° cosθ - X cos84° = cosθ - cos29° cos84°.

Factor X:

X (cos29° cosθ - cos84°) = cosθ - cos29° cos84°.

Thus,

X = [cosθ - cos29° cos84°] / [cos29° cosθ - cos84°].

Let me compute cos29°, cos84°, and plug in X = A / B.

We know from earlier that A ≈ 2.050 B, so X ≈ 2.050.

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: cosθ - cos29° cos84°.

Denominator: cos29° cosθ - cos84°.

Let me compute cosθ:

We found earlier that cosθ ≈ 0.1559, so θ ≈ 81°, cosθ ≈ 0.1559.

But let me compute numerator and denominator with cosθ ≈ 0.1559:

Numerator: 0.1559 - cos29° cos84°.

Compute cos29° ≈ 0.8746,

cos84° ≈ 0.1045,

So, cos29° cos84° ≈ 0.8746 * 0.1045 ≈ 0.0912.

Thus, numerator ≈ 0.1559 - 0.0912 ≈ 0.0647.

Denominator: cos29° cosθ - cos84°.

cos29° cosθ ≈ 0.8746 * 0.1559 ≈ 0.1363,

cos84° ≈ 0.1045,

Thus, denominator ≈ 0.1363 - 0.1045 ≈ 0.0318.

Therefore, X ≈ 0.0647 / 0.0318 ≈ 2.038.

Which is roughly 2.04, matching our earlier approximation of K ≈ 2.050.

So, that seems consistent.

Thus, X ≈ 2.04, which is consistent with K ≈ 2.050.

So, that verifies that our earlier computation is consistent.

Therefore, θ ≈ arccos(0.1559) ≈ 81.2°, which is approximately 81°.

But since the problem is given with angles as 29°, 84°, and we're dealing with exact values, perhaps 81° is the exact answer.

Wait, 81° is 90° - 9°, and 9° is half of 18°, which is close to 29°, but not exact.

Alternatively, maybe 81° is exact.

Wait, let me check if θ = 81°, then cosθ ≈ 0.1564, which is very close to our computed 0.1559. So, 0.1559 is close to cos81°, so θ ≈ 81°, which is exact.

Therefore, the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is 81°, so the answer is 81°, which is 81 degrees.

Alternatively, let me check if 81° is a result of some trigonometric identity.

Wait, 29° and 84°, 84° is 90° - 6°, but I don't see a direct relation.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Cosines:

If I have |**a**| = 2.050 |**b**|, and angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is θ, then:

|**a** - **b**|² = |**a**|² + |**b**|² - 2 |**a**| |**b**| cosθ.

But |**a** - **b**|² can also be expressed as (|**a**| - |**b**|)² + (|**b**| sinθ)^2, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps another approach: use the Law of Cosines on triangle (**a** - **b**, **b**, **a**):

We have sides |**a**|, |**b**|, |**a** - **b**|, and angles 29°, 84°, and θ.

So, Law of Sines:

|**a**| / sin84° = |**b**| / sin29° = |**a** - **b**| / sinθ.

From which, |**a**| = |**a** - **b**| sin84° / sinθ,

and |**b**| = |**a** - **b**| sin29° / sinθ.

So, |**a**| / |**b**| = sin84° / sin29° ≈ 0.9945 / 0.4848 ≈ 2.050.

Which matches our earlier approximation.

Then, from Equation (2):

K = (A cos29° - B) / cos84°,

and K ≈ 2.050.

So, 2.050 ≈ (A * 0.8746 - B) / 0.1045,

which gives A ≈ (2.050 * 0.1045 + B) / 0.8746,

but without knowing B, perhaps it's not helpful.

Wait, but from |**a**| = 2.050 |**b**|,

we can write A = 2.050 B.

Thus, plugging into Equation (2):

2.050 B * cos29° - B = C cos84°,

So, B (2.050 cos29° - 1) = C cos84°,

Thus, C = B (2.050 cos29° - 1) / cos84°,

Compute 2.050 cos29°:

2.050 * 0.8746 ≈ 1.7895,

so 1.7895 - 1 = 0.7895,

So, C = B * 0.7895 / 0.1045 ≈ B * 7.546.

Similarly, from Equation (4):

K = (A cos29° - B) / cos84°,

which is 2.050 = (1.7895 B - B) / 0.1045,

which gives 2.050 ≈ (0.7895 B) / 0.1045,

so B ≈ 2.050 * 0.1045 / 0.7895 ≈ (0.2143) / 0.7895 ≈ 0.2705.

So, B ≈ 0.2705, then A ≈ 2.050 * 0.2705 ≈ 0.554.

Then, |**a** - **b**| = sqrt(A² + B² - 2 A B cos29°),

Compute:

A² ≈ 0.554² ≈ 0.306,

B² ≈ 0.2705² ≈ 0.0732,

2 A B cos29° ≈ 2 * 0.554 * 0.2705 * 0.8746 ≈ 2 * 0.554 * 0.2705 * 0.8746 ≈ 2 * 0.128 ≈ 0.256.

Thus, |**a** - **b**| ≈ sqrt(0.306 + 0.0732 - 0.256) ≈ sqrt(0.1232) ≈ 0.351.

Then, using Law of Sines:

|**a** - **b**| / sinθ ≈ 0.351 / sinθ.

But |**a** - **b**| ≈ sqrt(A² + B² - 2 A B cos29°) ≈ 0.351,

and from sinθ = opposite / hypotenuse,

but actually, from the Law of Sines, sinθ = |**a** - **b**| sinθ / |**a**|.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, from Law of Sines:

|**a**| / sin84° = |**a** - **b**| / sinθ,

so sinθ = |**a** - **b**| sin84° / |**a**|.

Compute:

|**a** - **b**| ≈ 0.351,

sin84° ≈ 0.9945,

|**a**| ≈ sqrt(A² + B²) since A = 0.554, B = 0.2705,

so |**a**| ≈ sqrt(0.554² + 0.2705²) ≈ sqrt(0.306 + 0.0732) ≈ sqrt(0.3792) ≈ 0.616.

Thus, sinθ ≈ 0.351 * 0.9945 / 0.616 ≈ (0.35) / 0.616 ≈ 0.569.

So, θ ≈ arcsin(0.569) ≈ 35°, but this conflicts with the earlier approximate 81°.

Wait, that can't be right, because when I used Law of Cosines earlier, I thought θ was 81°, but here, using Law of Sines, I'm getting 35°, which is a discrepancy.

This suggests that I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in assuming the angle θ is between **a** and (**a** - **b**), but in reality, it's the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**), which is θ, as I considered. So, why the discrepancy?

Wait, when I computed sinθ ≈ 0.569, θ ≈ 35°, but earlier, using Law of Cosines, I found θ ≈ 81°, which is θ = 81°, which is a big discrepancy.

This suggests that somewhere in my reasoning, I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check:

Earlier, when I wrote:

K = A / B ≈ 2.050,

and then using the Law of Cosines expression for |**a** - **b**|, I had:

|**a** - **b**|² = A² + B² - 2 A B cos29°.

But from Law of Sines, I had:

|**a** - **b**| = |**a**| sin84° / sinθ.

So, squaring both sides:

|**a** - **b**|² = |**a**|² sin²84° / sin²θ.

But from the Law of Cosines:

|**a** - **b**|² = A² + B² - 2 A B cos29°.

Therefore,

A² + B² - 2 A B cos29° = (A² + B²) sin²84° / sin²θ.

Let me rearrange this:

(A² + B²)(1 - sin²84° / sin²θ) = 2 A B cos29°.

Which is,

(A² + B²)(cos²84° / sin²θ) = 2 A B cos29°.

Thus,

(A² + B²) cos²84° / sin²θ = 2 A B cos29°.

Divide both sides by A B:

(A/A + B/B) cos²84° / sin²θ = 2 cos29°.

But A/A = 1, B/B = 1, so:

(A + B) cos²84° / sin²θ = 2 cos29°.

But A = 2.050 B,

so,

(2.050 B + B) cos²84° / sin²θ = 2 cos29°,

which is,

3.050 B cos²84° / sin²θ = 2 cos29°.

But from Law of Sines,

B = |**a**| sin29° / sinθ ≈ (0.616) sin29° / sinθ ≈ 0.616 * 0.4848 / sinθ ≈ 0.299 / sinθ.

Thus, B ≈ 0.299 / sinθ.

Substituting back,

3.050 * (0.299 / sinθ) * cos²84° / sin²θ = 2 cos29°,

so,

3.050 * 0.299 * cos²84° / sin³θ = 2 cos29°.

Compute:

3.050 * 0.299 ≈ 0.912,

cos²84° ≈ 0.1045² ≈ 0.0109,

So,

0.912 * 0.0109 ≈ 0.0099,

Thus,

0.0099 / sin³θ ≈ 2 * 0.8746 ≈ 1.749,

So,

0.0099 ≈ 1.749 sin³θ,

Thus,

sin³θ ≈ 0.0099 / 1.749 ≈ 0.0057,

So,

sinθ ≈ cube root(0.0057) ≈ 0.18,

Thus,

θ ≈ arcsin(0.18) ≈ 10.3°,

Wait, that's different from before.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me check the calculations step by step.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, let's go back.

After substituting A = 2.050 B,

and B = |**a**| sin29° / sinθ,

and |**a**| ≈ 0.616,

so B ≈ 0.616 * 0.4848 / sinθ ≈ 0.299 / sinθ,

So, B ≈ 0.299 / sinθ.

Then, plugging into the equation:

(A² + B²) cos²84° / sin²θ = 2 A B cos29°,

we have:

( (2.050 B)^2 + B^2 ) cos²84° / sin²θ = 2 * 2.050 B * B cos29°,

which is:

(4.2025 B² + B²) cos²84° / sin²θ = 4.100 B² cos29°,

so,

5.2025 B² cos²84° / sin²θ = 4.100 B² cos29°,

Cancel B²:

5.2025 cos²84° / sin²θ = 4.100 cos29°,

Compute:

5.2025 * (0.1045)^2 ≈ 5.2025 * 0.0109 ≈ 0.0563,

So,

0.0563 / sin²θ = 4.100 * 0.8746 ≈ 4.100 * 0.8746 ≈ 3.584.

Thus,

0.0563 / sin²θ = 3.584,

so,

sin²θ = 0.0563 / 3.584 ≈ 0.01575,

so,

sinθ ≈ sqrt(0.01575) ≈ 0.1255,

so,

θ ≈ arcsin(0.1255) ≈ 7.2°.

This is consistent with our previous approximate θ ≈ 81°, which is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the earlier step when I equated the two expressions for |**a** - **b**|².

Wait, because |**a** - **b**|² is equal to both expressions:

From Law of Cosines:

|**a** - **b**|² = |**a**|² + |**b**|² - 2 |**a**| |**b**| cos29°.

From Law of Sines:

|**a** - **b**|² = |**a**|² sin²84° / sin²θ.

So, setting them equal:

|**a**|² + |**b**|² - 2 |**a**| |**b**| cos29° = |**a**|² sin²84° / sin²θ.

Then, rearranged:

|**b**|² - 2 |**a**| |**b**| cos29° = |**a**|² (sin²84° / sin²θ - 1).

Hmm, perhaps I should use this equation with the known ratios.

But this seems getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Law of Cosines on triangle (**a** - **b**, **b**, **a**).

So, sides:

|**a** - **b**|,

|**b**|,

|**a**|.

Angles:

At (**a** - **b**): θ,

At **b**: 84°,

At **a**: 29°.

Thus, Law of Cosines:

|**a**|² = |**a** - **b**|² + |**b**|² - 2 |**a** - **b**| |**b**| cos84°.

But we also have from triangle (**a** - **b**, **b**, **a**):

|**a**|² = |**a** - **b**|² + |**b**|² - 2 |**a** - **b**| |**b**| cos84°.

Which is the same as the Law of Cosines.

Alternatively, from the Law of Cosines:

|**a**|² = |**a** - **b**|² + |**b**|² - 2 |**a** - **b**| |**b**| cos84°.

But we also know that |**a**| = 2.050 |**b**|.

So, substituting |**a**| = 2.050 B,

we get:

(2.050 B)² = |**a** - **b**|² + B² - 2 |**a** - **b**| B cos84°,

so,

4.2025 B² = |**a** - **b**|² + B² - 2 |**a** - **b**| B cos84°,

which simplifies to:

3.2025 B² = |**a** - **b**|² - 2 |**a** - **b**| B cos84°,

But from the Law of Sines,

|**a** - **b**| = |**a**| sin84° / sinθ = 2.050 B * sin84° / sinθ,

so,

|**a** - **b**| = 2.050 B * 0.9945 / sinθ ≈ 2.038 B / sinθ.

Thus,

|**a** - **b**|² ≈ (2.038 B / sinθ)^2 ≈ 4.153 B² / sin²θ,

and

2 |**a** - **b**| B cos84° ≈ 2 * 2.038 B / sinθ * B * 0.1045 ≈ 2 * 2.038 * 0.1045 B² / sinθ ≈ 0.427 B² / sinθ.

So, plugging back into the equation:

3.2025 B² = (4.153 B² / sin²θ) - (0.427 B² / sinθ),

Divide both sides by B²:

3.2025 = 4.153 / sin²θ - 0.427 / sinθ,

Let me let x = 1 / sinθ,

then,

3.2025 = 4.153 x² - 0.427 x,

which is,

4.153 x² - 0.427 x - 3.2025 = 0.

Solving for x:

x = [0.427 ± sqrt(0.427² + 4 * 4.153 * 3.2025)] / (2 * 4.153),

Compute discriminant:

0.427² = 0.182,

4 * 4.153 * 3.2025 ≈ 4 * 4.153 ≈ 16.612; 16.612 * 3.2025 ≈ 53.19,

So,

sqrt(0.182 + 53.19) ≈ sqrt(53.372) ≈ 7.307,

Thus,

x = [0.427 ± 7.307] / 8.306,

Taking positive solution,

x = (0.427 + 7.307) / 8.306 ≈ 7.734 / 8.306 ≈ 0.928,

so,

1 / sinθ ≈ 0.928,

so,

sinθ ≈ 1 / 0.928 ≈ 1.077,

which is impossible because sinθ cannot exceed 1.

Thus, the other solution:

x = [0.427 - 7.307] / 8.306 ≈ (-6.88) / 8.306 ≈ -0.828,

which would give 1 / sinθ ≈ -0.828, which is impossible since sinθ is positive.

Hmm, this suggests no solution, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps my approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps the issue is with the assumption that |**a**| = 2.050 |**b**|.

Wait, that came from K = A / B ≈ 2.050, but is that accurate?

From Equation (2):

K cos29° - 1 = C cos84°,

and from Equation (4):

K - cos29° = C cosθ,

so,

K = (A cos29° - B) / cos84°,

and K = (A - B cos29°) / cosθ,

so,

(A cos29° - B) / cos84° = (A - B cos29°) / cosθ,

Cross-multiplying:

(A cos29° - B) cosθ = (A - B cos29°) cos84°,

which gives:

A cos29° cosθ - B cosθ = A cos84° - B cos29° cos84°,

which rearranged:

A (cos29° cosθ - cos84°) = B (cosθ - cos29° cos84°),

so,

A / B = [cosθ - cos29° cos84°] / [cos29° cosθ - cos84°],

which is the same as K = A / B.

We have K ≈ 2.050,

so,

[cosθ - cos29° cos84°] / [cos29° cosθ - cos84°] ≈ 2.050,

which we can write as:

cosθ - cos29° cos84° ≈ 2.050 (cos29° cosθ - cos84°),

which gives:

cosθ - cos29° cos84° ≈ 2.050 cos29° cosθ - 2.050 cos84°,

which rearranged:

cosθ - 2.050 cos29° cosθ ≈ cos29° cos84° - 2.050 cos84°,

so,

cosθ (1 - 2.050 cos29°) ≈ cos84° (cos29° - 2.050),

Compute:

1 - 2.050 cos29° ≈ 1 - 2.050 * 0.8746 ≈ 1 - 1.789 ≈ -0.789,

and,

cos29° - 2.050 ≈ 0.8746 - 2.050 ≈ -1.1754,

so,

cosθ (-0.789) ≈ -1.1754 cos84°,

so,

cosθ ≈ (-1.1754 cos84°) / (-0.789) ≈ (1.1754 * 0.1045) / 0.789 ≈ (0.1225) / 0.789 ≈ 0.1546,

so,

θ ≈ arccos(0.1546) ≈ 81.2°, which is approximately 81°.

Thus, the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is approximately 81°, which makes sense because when I computed via Law of Cosines earlier, it came out as around 81°, but via Law of Sines, it came out as 35°, which is a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the Law of Sines, I considered angle θ, but perhaps the triangle is actually being considered with a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps the angle θ is between **a** and (**a** - **b**), but in reality, (**a** - **b**) is a vector, so the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is indeed θ, but in the triangle (**a** - **b**, **b**, **a**), the angle at **a** is 29°, at **b** is 84°, so the angle at (**a** - **b**) is θ, which is 81°, which is consistent with our calculation.

So, perhaps my earlier confusion was because of misapplying the Law of Sines.

Therefore, after going through all these calculations, I think the angle between **a** and (**a** - **b**) is approximately 81°, which is the answer.

**Final Answer**
The angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\left(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\right)$ is $\boxed{81^\circ}$.

Given vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) with magnitudes \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 29^\circ\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 84^\circ\), and the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is 29 degrees, we need to find the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \((\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})\).

1. **Expressing the dot products:**
   - \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 29^\circ \cdot 84^\circ = 2436\)
   - \(\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 29^2 - 2436 = 841 - 2436 = -1595\)
   - \((\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 84^2 - 2436 = 7056 - 2436 = 4620\)

2. **Using the Law of Cosines in triangle \((\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{a}\):**
   - The sides are \(|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}| = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2 - 2AB \cos 29^\circ}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{a}\).
   - Using the Law of Cosines:
     \[
     |\mathbf{a}|^2 = |\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}|^2 + |\mathbf{b}|^2 - 2 |\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}| |\mathbf{b}| \cos 84^\circ
     \]
   - Substituting the known values and solving for the angle \(\theta\) between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \((\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})\).

3. **Solving for \(\theta\):**
   - Using the relationship between the vectors and the given angles, we find:
     \[
     \cos \theta = \frac{A \cos 29^\circ - B}{\cos 84^\circ}
     \]
   - Through detailed calculations, we find that the angle \(\theta\) is approximately 81 degrees.

Thus, the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \((\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})\) is \(\boxed{81^\circ}\).
