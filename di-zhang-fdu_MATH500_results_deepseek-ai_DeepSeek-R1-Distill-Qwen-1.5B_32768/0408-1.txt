Question:
What is the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeroes and ones?

Correct Answer:
If a number is divisible by 450, then it must be divisible by all divisors of 450, including 9 and 50.

For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Since a positive number must have at least one digit which is not 0, the number we're looking for is forced to have at least 9 ones among its digits.

The number we're looking for must also be divisible by 50, which means that it ends in 50 or 00. Since the digit 5 is not allowed, our number must end in 00, which means the smallest candidate is  $\boxed{11,\! 111,\! 111,\! 100}$. In fact, because 9 and 50 $\emph{do}$ divide this number, and because 450 is the least common multiple of 9 and 50, we know that 450 does divide 11,111,111,100; so that number is the correct answer.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all the digits are just zeros and ones. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, let me understand what a multiple of 450 looks like. 450 can be factored into prime factors as 2 * 3^2 * 5^2. So, any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. That means the number needs to end with a zero (because it's divisible by 2 and 5), and the sum of its digits should be a multiple of 9 (since it needs to be divisible by 9). Also, the last two digits should form a number that's divisible by 25, which means it should be either 00, 25, 50, or 75. But since we're only using 0s and 1s, the only possible ending is 00 or 00. Wait, 25, 50, and 75 aren't possible because they include digits other than 0 and 1. So, the number must end with two zeros.

So, the number has to end with two zeros. That simplifies things a bit. Now, let's think about the other conditions. The number must be divisible by 9, which means the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9. Since all digits are 0s and 1s, the sum of the digits is just the count of the 1s. Therefore, the number must have a number of 1s that is a multiple of 9. So, the number of 1s must be 9, 18, 27, etc.

Additionally, the number must be divisible by 25, which we already addressed by the two trailing zeros. So, the number must end with 00. Therefore, the number is a binary number (composed of 1s and 0s) with at least two trailing zeros. Let's denote the number as N. So, N = 100 * K, where K is some integer composed of 1s and 0s.

So, the problem reduces to finding the smallest K such that K is a binary number (no 1s except for trailing zeros if any, but since N must end with two zeros, K itself can be a binary number without trailing zeros because the trailing zeros would be already accounted for in N). Wait, actually, K can have trailing zeros as well, but since N must end with two zeros, K can end with one zero, but in terms of binary, that would be a 0. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a binary number where the last two digits are zeros, and the rest can be ones. So, the number N is equal to M * 100, where M is some binary number (composed of 1s and 0s). So, N = M followed by two zeros.

Therefore, N must be a multiple of 450, which is 2 * 3^2 * 5^2. So, N is a binary number ending with two zeros, so it's already even and divisible by 50. Now, we just need the sum of the digits of M plus two zeros to be a multiple of 9. Wait, no, the sum of digits of N is the sum of digits of M plus 0 + 0, which is the sum of digits of M. But since N is divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9.

So, the sum of the digits of M must be a multiple of 9. So, M is a binary number (0s and 1s) such that the number of 1s in M is a multiple of 9. Also, since N must be the smallest such number, we need the smallest M (which is in binary) such that M has at least 9 ones and ends with 00.

Wait, but M can have trailing zeros as well, but since N is M followed by two zeros, the trailing zeros in M would translate to having more zeros at the end of N. But since N is already required to have two trailing zeros, M can have trailing zeros as well, but since we want N to be as small as possible, we should minimize the number of digits.

So, the minimal number of digits in N would be when M has as few digits as possible, i.e., M is a binary number with the fewest digits possible such that the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. Since M must have at least 9 ones, the minimal length of M is 9 digits, all ones. So, M would be 111111111.

Therefore, N would be 111111111 followed by two zeros, which is 11111111100. So, is this the minimal number?

But wait, maybe we can find a smaller M with fewer digits? For example, perhaps with fewer digits, but with leading zeros? Wait, no, because M is a binary number, and leading zeros don't count towards the digits. So, M must be a binary number with minimal digits, which is 9 digits. Therefore, N is 9 digits followed by two zeros, which is 11 digits in total.

But wait, is there a smaller number? Let me think. Maybe we can have a number with fewer digits but more 1s in the right positions?

Wait, let's consider that N must be divisible by 9, so the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9. If N is a binary number with k digits, the sum of its digits is equal to the number of 1s in N. So, to get the minimal N, we need the minimal k such that the number of 1s is a multiple of 9 and the number ends with two zeros.

Wait, but N is not just any binary number with two trailing zeros; it must be the minimal such number. So, perhaps we need to find the minimal binary number with two trailing zeros and with a number of 1s that is a multiple of 9.

Alternatively, since N is equal to M * 100, where M is a binary number, perhaps we can model this problem as finding the smallest binary number M such that the number of 1s in M is a multiple of 9, and then N is M followed by two zeros.

So, to find the minimal M, we need the minimal number of digits in M such that the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. The minimal number of digits is when the number of 1s is exactly 9, so M must have at least 9 digits. Therefore, the minimal M is 111111111, which is 9 ones.

Therefore, N is 11111111100, which is 11 digits.

But wait, is there a smaller number? Let me think again. Suppose that we can have a binary number that is smaller than 11111111100 but still satisfies the condition. For example, maybe a number with fewer digits but with more 1s and arranged in a way that it's smaller.

Wait, but 11111111100 is 11 digits, whereas, for example, 11111111111111100 is longer. So, perhaps 11111111100 is the minimal.

Wait, but hold on a second. Maybe if we have a number with fewer digits but a non-uniform distribution of 1s and 0s, such that the number is smaller but still satisfies the sum of digits being a multiple of 9 and ending with two zeros.

But actually, since the number must end with two zeros, the minimal number of digits is determined by the number of 1s. The minimal M is 9 ones, making N as 11 digits. So, perhaps 11111111100 is the minimal.

But let me think again. Maybe there's a smaller number. For example, maybe a number that's not all ones but has a certain pattern that is smaller. Let's see.

Wait, let's think about the number as a binary number. So, N is a binary number ending with two zeros, with a number of 1s equal to a multiple of 9. So, the number is of the form 111...1100, where the number of 1s is 9, 18, 27, etc.

So, the minimal number is 11111111100, which is 11 digits. So, that's 11 digits long.

But, wait, is there a way to have a smaller number with fewer digits but more 1s? For instance, if we have a number with 18 digits, but arranged in a way that it's smaller than 11111111100.

Wait, for example, a number like 10101010101010101010000, which is 20 digits, but that's larger than 11 digits.

Wait, but if we have a number with fewer digits, the digits can be arranged in a way that the number is smaller. For example, 10010010010000 is 12 digits, but it's larger than 11111111100.

Wait, but perhaps a number like 10101010101010000, which is 15 digits, but that's still larger than 11 digits.

So, 11 digits is the minimal length. Therefore, 11111111100 is the minimal number.

But let me check if 11111111100 is indeed the minimal. Maybe there's a smaller number with fewer digits but more 1s in a different arrangement.

Wait, for example, let's think about smaller numbers. Suppose we have a number with 10 digits. The maximum number of 1s in a 10-digit number is 10, which isn't a multiple of 9. The next is 9, so 11111111100 is 11 digits. So, 10 digits can't satisfy the sum of digits being 9.

Wait, but N has to have at least two trailing zeros, so the number of digits is at least 2. But the number of 1s has to be a multiple of 9, so the minimal number of digits is 9, but with two trailing zeros, making it 11 digits.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to have a number with 18 digits, but arranged in a way that it's a smaller number? For example, 1001001001000000, but that's 16 digits, which is still more than 11.

Wait, perhaps I can think of a number that's shorter but has 1s in a way that the number is smaller than 11111111100.

Wait, 11111111100 is 11111111100, which is 11 digits. The first digit is 1, followed by 8 more 1s, then two 0s.

Is there a way to make a number with fewer digits but still ending with two zeros and having a sum of digits equal to 9?

Wait, for example, a 10-digit number: sum of digits must be 9, so 9 ones and 1 zero. But then, since it must end with two zeros, the total number of digits would be 1 (for the first digit) + 8 ones + 2 zeros, making 11 digits. So, you can't have a 10-digit number because you can't have 9 ones and 1 zero without ending with two zeros, which would require at least two more zeros, making it 11 digits.

Similarly, a 9-digit number can have 9 ones, but without any zeros, which would not satisfy the ending with two zeros. So, 9-digit numbers cannot satisfy the requirement, so the minimal number of digits is 11.

Therefore, 11111111100 seems to be the minimal number.

Wait, but let me test if 11111111100 is indeed divisible by 450.

So, let me compute 11111111100 divided by 450.

First, 450 * 246946296 = ?

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can divide 11111111100 by 100 first, which is 111111111, then divide by 450.

So, 111111111 divided by 450.

But 111111111 divided by 450 is equal to 111111111 / 450.

Let me compute that.

111111111 divided by 450:

First, 450 goes into 111111111 how many times?

Well, 450 * 246946296 = 11111111100, which is 11111111100.

Wait, so 450 * 246946296 = 11111111100, which is 111111111 * 100.

Wait, so 450 * 246946296 = 11111111100.

Therefore, 11111111100 divided by 450 is 246946296.

So, yes, 11111111100 is exactly divisible by 450.

Therefore, 11111111100 is a multiple of 450.

But, is this the smallest such number? Let me see.

Is there a smaller number? For example, a number with fewer digits, but still, the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9 and it ends with two zeros.

Wait, but as I thought earlier, with fewer digits, you can't have a sum of digits equal to 9 without having at least 9 ones, which would make it at least 11 digits. So, 11111111100 seems to be the minimal.

But wait, let me think if there's a way to have a number with more digits but arranged in a way that the number is smaller.

For example, a number with 18 digits, but arranged with more zeros in the higher place values, but I think that's not possible because 11111111100 is already 11 digits, which is smaller than 18.

Wait, but if we can't have a number with fewer digits, then 11111111100 is the minimal.

Wait, but let me check for smaller numbers.

Wait, suppose I have a number like 10010010010000, which is 12 digits. But 10010010010000 is larger than 11111111100, so it's not better.

Alternatively, 10010010010000 is 12 digits, which is longer than 11 digits.

Wait, but 10010010010000 is 1 followed by 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, which is 13 digits. So, no, that's worse.

Wait, perhaps a number with fewer digits but a different arrangement. Let me think.

Suppose I have a number with 9 digits: 111111111. But that's only 9 digits, but it doesn't end with two zeros. Therefore, it's not a multiple of 450.

So, the number must end with two zeros, so the minimal M is 9 digits, which is 111111111, making N as 11 digits.

Therefore, 11111111100 is the minimal such number.

But just to make sure, let me check if there's a smaller number with fewer digits. For example, a number with 10 digits: 1111111110, which is 10 digits. But, the sum of its digits is 9, which is not a multiple of 9? Wait, 1111111110 has 9 ones and 1 zero, so the sum is 9, which is a multiple of 9. So, is 1111111110 a multiple of 450?

Wait, 1111111110 divided by 450.

Let me compute 1111111110 / 450.

First, 450 * 246946298 = 111111111100, which is 111111111100, but we have 1111111110, which is 10 digits. So, 1111111110 / 450 is equal to approximately 246946298. So, 450 * 246946298 = 111111111100, which is different from 1111111110.

Therefore, 1111111110 is not divisible by 450 because 1111111110 is not four hundred fifty times an integer.

Wait, 450 times 246946298 is 111111111100, which is 100 more than 11111111100.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no, 450 * 246946298 = 111111111100, which is 111111111100.

But 11111111100 is 11111111100, which is 100 less than 111111111100.

So, 11111111100 is 11111111100, which is 111111111 * 100.

So, 111111111 * 100 is 11111111100, which is 11111111100.

So, 11111111100 divided by 450 is 246946296, as I computed earlier.

But 1111111110 is not a multiple of 450 because it's not 11111111100.

Therefore, 1111111110 is not a multiple of 450, so 11111111100 is the minimal.

Wait, but 11111111100 is 111111111 * 100, which is 9 ones followed by two zeros, so the sum is 9, which is a multiple of 9, and it's divisible by 100, so it's divisible by 4, 25, and 100, hence by 450.

So, I think 11111111100 is indeed the minimal.

But now, let me think again. Is there a smaller number? For example, a number with fewer digits but more 1s in a different arrangement.

Wait, for example, a number like 11111111100 is 11 digits. If I try to have a 10-digit number, it's not possible because the sum of the digits would have to be 9, which is less than 10. So, you can't have a 10-digit number with a sum of digits equal to 9; the maximum sum is 9.

Wait, but 10 digits with a sum of 9 is impossible because you can't have 9 ones in 10 digits and the rest zeros; that requires 10 digits. So, 10 digits can't have a sum of 9 if it needs to end with two zeros.

Therefore, 10 digits is impossible, so 11 digits is the minimal.

Therefore, 11111111100 is the minimal such number.

Wait, but let me just verify this with a different approach.

Since N must be divisible by 450, which is 2 * 3^2 * 5^2, N must be even (so ends with 0), divisible by 25 (ends with 00), and divisible by 9 (sum of digits is multiple of 9).

So, starting from the minimal possible number, which would be the smallest number ending with 00, with as few digits as possible. Since it has to be a multiple of 9, the number of 1s must be 9, 18, etc.

Therefore, the minimal such number is 11111111100, as that is 9 ones followed by two zeros. Since any other number with fewer digits would either not have enough 1s (sum of digits less than 9) or would have a wrong last two digits (not 00), due to the divisibility by 25.

Therefore, 11111111100 is indeed the minimal.

Wait, but let me check if there is a smaller number with fewer digits but arranged in a way that it's a multiple of 450.

Wait, for example, a 9-digit number: 111111111, which is 111,111,111. But 111,111,111 is not divisible by 450 because it's not a multiple of 100. So, 111,111,111 is 111111111, which is not ending with two zeros. So, it's not divisible by 25, hence not divisible by 450.

Similarly, a 10-digit number: 1010101010, which is 10 digits. Sum of digits is 5, which is not a multiple of 9. So, it's not divisible by 9.

Another example: 111111111100. That's 12 digits. But that's longer than 11 digits, so it's not minimal.

Wait, 11111111100 is 11 digits, which is shorter than 12 digits.

Therefore, 11111111100 is indeed the minimal.

Wait, to make sure, perhaps I can write a small program or use a calculator to verify the divisibility.

But since I don't have a calculator, I can perform the division.

Compute 11111111100 divided by 450.

First, 450 * 246946296 = ?

Compute 246946296 * 450.

Let me compute 246946296 * 450:

First, 246946296 * 400 = 98778518400

Then, 246946296 * 50 = 12347314800

Add them together: 98778518400 + 12347314800 = 111125833200

Wait, that's more than 11111111100.

Wait, so 246946296 * 450 is 111125833200, which is way larger than 11111111100.

So, that's not correct.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 246946296 * 450: 246946296 * 450 is 246946296 * 4.5 * 100.

Wait, 246946296 * 4.5 is 246946296 * 4 + 246946296 * 0.5.

Compute 246946296 * 4 = 987785184

Compute 246946296 * 0.5 = 123473148

Add them together: 987785184 + 123473148 = 1111258332

Multiply by 100: 1111258332 * 100 = 111125833200

Wait, but 11111111100 is 111111111 * 100.

So, 11111111100 is 111111111 * 100, which is 11111111100.

So, 11111111100 divided by 450 is 11111111100 / 450 = 246946296.

Wait, but 246946296 * 450 is 111125833200, which is not 11111111100.

Wait, so 246946296 * 450 is 111125833200, which is 111125833200, which is 25 times larger than 450.

Wait, but 11111111100 divided by 450 is 246946296.666..., which is not an integer. So, 11111111100 is not divisible by 450.

Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, so my initial assumption was wrong.

Wait, so 11111111100 is not divisible by 450. So, it's not the correct number.

Wait, so perhaps I need to find the next number.

Wait, so the number must be divisible by 450, which is 2*3^2*5^2. So, the number must be even, divisible by 25, and sum of digits is multiple of 9.

So, let me think again.

The number must end with 00, be even, and sum of digits is multiple of 9.

So, the number is of the form M00, where M is a binary number (only 1s and 0s) with a sum of digits equal to a multiple of 9.

So, the minimal M is 9 ones.

Therefore, the minimal N is 11111111100.

But as we saw, 11111111100 is not divisible by 450 because 11111111100 / 450 is not integer.

Wait, so perhaps the next number is 11111111100 + 100 = 11111112100, which has a sum of digits 10, which is not a multiple of 9.

Wait, 11111112100: sum is 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2+1+0+0 = 10. Not a multiple of 9.

Wait, so perhaps adding 100 until the sum of digits is a multiple of 9.

Wait, maybe I need to increase the number of 1s or the number of digits.

Wait, but that's too time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to find the minimal number that is a multiple of 450 and ends with two zeros.

So, perhaps starting from 450, and incrementing by 450 each time, checking if the number ends with two zeros.

So, let me try:

450: ends with 50. Not two zeros.

900: ends with 00. So, 900 is a multiple of 450 because 900 / 450 = 2.

And 900 is a multiple of 450.

Moreover, 900 is a multiple of 9, 25, and 4.

So, 900 is a candidate.

Wait, is 900 the minimal number? But wait, 900 is 9*100, which is 9*10^2, so it's a multiple of 450.

So, 900 is a multiple of 450, and it's a smaller number than 11111111100.

So, why did I think that 11111111100 was the minimal?

Because I thought the sum of digits had to be 9, but in reality, the sum of digits just needs to be a multiple of 9, which is 9, 18, etc.

So, 900 is a multiple of 450, and it's smaller than 11111111100.

So, perhaps 900 is the minimal.

But wait, is 900 a multiple of 450? Yes, because 450*2=900. So, 900 is a multiple.

But 900 is 9*100, which is 9*10^2. So, 900 is a multiple of 450.

But wait, 900 is 900, which is 100*9, so it's 9*10^2.

So, 900 is a multiple of 450, but is 900 the minimal?

Wait, 450*1=450, which is not ending with two zeros.

450*2=900, which ends with two zeros.

So, 900 is the minimal.

Wait, but why did I think that 11111111100 was the minimal?

Because I thought the sum of digits has to be 9, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, the sum of digits is a multiple of 9, so it can be 9, 18, 27, etc. So, 900 has a sum of digits 9, which is a multiple of 9.

So, 900 is a smaller number than 11111111100.

Therefore, 900 is the minimal.

But wait, is 900 a binary number with trailing zeros?

Wait, 900 is 9*100, which is 9*10^2, so it's 900 in decimal, which is 11100100 in binary.

Wait, let's verify 900 in binary.

Compute 900 / 2 = 450, remainder 0

450 / 2 = 225, remainder 0

225 / 2 = 112, remainder 1

112 / 2 = 56, remainder 0

56 / 2 = 28, remainder 0

28 / 2 = 14, remainder 0

14 / 2 = 7, remainder 0

7 / 2 = 3, remainder 1

3 / 2 = 1, remainder 1

1 / 2 = 0, remainder 1

So, writing remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0.

Wait, let me count:

Starting from the last division:

1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0.

So, 900 in binary is 11100100.

So, the binary representation of 900 is 11100100, which ends with two zeros, so it's divisible by 100, which is 4*25, so it's divisible by 4 and 25, hence divisible by 100.

Therefore, 900 is divisible by 450, as 900 / 450 = 2.

Therefore, 900 is a multiple of 450.

So, 900 is smaller than 11111111100.

So, perhaps 900 is the minimal.

Wait, but let me check numbers less than 900.

Wait, 450: ends with 50, not two zeros.

900: ends with two zeros, sum of digits is 9, which is a multiple of 9.

So, 900 is the minimal.

So, why did I think that 11111111100 was the minimal earlier? Because I considered that the number must end with two zeros and have a sum of digits equal to 9, which makes it divisible by 9, 25, and thus 450. But actually, the sum of digits only needs to be a multiple of 9, which can be 9, 18, 27, etc.

Therefore, 900, which is 9*100, is a smaller number and satisfies all the conditions.

So, is 900 the minimal?

Wait, let me check 450: not ending with two zeros.

900: ends with two zeros, sum of digits is 9, which is multiple of 9.

So, 900 is a multiple of 450.

So, 900 is smaller than 11111111100, so 900 is the minimal.

But wait, 900 is 900, which is 9*100, which is 9*2^2*5^2. So, 900 is 2^2*3^2*5^2.

So, yeah, 450 divides 900.

So, why did I think the minimal was 11111111100? Because I thought the sum of digits had to be 9, but that's not necessarily the case.

I think I confused the sum of digits with the number of 1s.

Therefore, the minimal multiple of 450 is 900.

So, 900 is the minimal.

Wait, but 900 is 9*100, which is 9*10^2, so it's 900.

So, 900 is a multiple of 450.

Therefore, 900 is the minimal.

But let me confirm.

Compute 900 divided by 450: 2.

Yes, so 900 is a multiple of 450.

So, 900 is the minimal multiple.

Therefore, the answer is 900.

Wait, but let me think again.

Is 900 the minimal multiple?

Because, let me check 450*2=900, which ends with two zeros, sum of digits is 9, which is a multiple of 9, so 900 is a multiple of 450.

Therefore, 900 is the minimal.

Wait, so why did I think it was 11111111100? Because I thought it had to end with two zeros and have the sum of digits as 9, but that's not required.

It's required only that the number is divisible by 450, which is 2*3^2*5^2, so the number must be even, divisible by 25, and have a sum of digits of a multiple of 9.

Therefore, the minimal number is 900.

So, the answer is 900.

Wait, but then I also thought of 1800, which is 18*100, which is 1800. 1800 is a multiple of 450, as 1800/450=4.

But 1800 is larger than 900, so 900 is the minimal.

So, 900 is the minimal multiple.

Therefore, the answer is 900.

Wait, but let me confirm if there is a smaller number.

Wait, 450 is not ending with two zeros, it's 450.

So, 900 is the next multiple that ends with two zeros.

So, 900 is 900, which is 450*2.

So, 900 is the minimal.

So, yeah, I think 900 is the answer.

So, to sum up:

- 450 is 2*3^2*5^2.

- The number must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25.

- To be divisible by 25, it must end with two zeros.

- To be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9.

- The minimal number that meets all these is 900.

Therefore, the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones is 900.

**Final Answer**
The smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones is \boxed{900}.
</think>

To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones, we start by noting that 450 factors into \(2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\). Therefore, the number must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25.

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in 0.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: The number must end in 00.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9.

Since the number must end in 00, it is of the form \(M00\), where \(M\) is a binary number. The sum of the digits of \(M\) must be a multiple of 9.

The smallest binary number \(M\) that sums to 9 is 111111111 (nine 1s). Therefore, the number is \(11111111100\), which is 111111111 multiplied by 100. However, this number is not divisible by 450.

Next, we consider the smallest multiple of 450 that ends in 00. The smallest such number is 900, which is 9 times 100. The sum of the digits of 900 is 9, which is a multiple of 9. Therefore, 900 is divisible by 450.

Thus, the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones is \(\boxed{900}\).
