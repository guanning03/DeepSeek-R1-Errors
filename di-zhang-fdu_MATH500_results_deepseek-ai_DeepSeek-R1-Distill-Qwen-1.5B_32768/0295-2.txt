Question:
Assume $0 < r < 3$.  Below are five equations for $x$.  Which equation has the largest solution $x$?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 3(1 + r)^x = 7\qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 3(1 + r/10)^x = 7\qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 3(1 + 2r)^x = 7$ $\textbf{(D)}\ 3(1 + \sqrt {r})^x = 7\qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 3(1 + 1/r)^x = 7$

Correct Answer:
Intuitively, $x$ will be largest for the option for which the value in the parentheses is smallest.

Formally, first note that each of the values in parentheses is larger than $1$. Now, each of the options is of the form $3f(r)^x = 7$. This can be rewritten as $x\log f(r) = \log\frac 73$. As $f(r)>1$, we have $\log f(r)>0$. Thus $x$ is the largest for the option for which $\log f(r)$ is smallest. As $\log f(r)$ is an increasing function, this is the option for which $f(r)$ is smallest.

We now get the following easier problem: Given that $0<r<3$, find the smallest value in the set $\{ 1+r, 1+r/10, 1+2r, 1+\sqrt r, 1+1/r\}$.

Clearly, $1+r/10$ is smaller than the first and the third option.

We have $r^2 < 10$, so dividing both sides by $10r$, we get $r/10 < 1/r$.

Finally, $r/100 < 1$, therefore $r^2/100 < r$. Since both sides are positive, we can take the square root and get $r/10 < \sqrt r$.

Thus the answer is $\boxed{\text{(B)}} 3(1 + r/10)^x = 7$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out which of the five given equations has the largest solution for x. All the equations are exponential, and they all have the form 3 times something raised to the power of x equals 7. The base of the exponent is different in each case, and the variable x is in the exponent. The question specifies that 0 < r < 3, which is important because it tells me about the possible values of r.

First, I think I should probably rewrite each equation in a more standard exponential form so I can see it clearly. Let me write them out again:

A) 3(1 + r)^x = 7  
B) 3(1 + r/10)^x = 7  
C) 3(1 + 2r)^x = 7  
D) 3(1 + sqrt(r))^x = 7  
E) 3(1 + 1/r)^x = 7

Alright, so each equation is of the form 3 times a base raised to x equals 7. To solve for x, I can divide both sides by 3, which gives me (base)^x = 7/3. Then, taking the natural logarithm of both sides should help me solve for x. The natural log of (base)^x is x times the natural log of the base, so x equals ln(7/3) divided by ln(base). That means x = ln(7/3) / ln(base). So, the solution for x is dependent on the base of the exponential function.

Since all the bases are greater than 1 (because r is positive), the function (base)^x is an increasing function. That means as the base increases, the exponent x needed to reach 7/3 will decrease because the same result is achieved with a larger base. So, the larger the base, the smaller the x needed to make the equation true. Therefore, the equation with the largest base will have the smallest x, and the equation with the smallest base will have the largest x.

Wait, let me make sure. If I have two bases, say base1 and base2, where base1 < base2. Then, for the same result, ln(base1) < ln(base2). So, when I divide ln(7/3) by a smaller denominator, the result is a larger x. So yes, the equation with the smallest base will have the largest x.

So, in order to find which equation gives the largest x, I need to identify which equation has the smallest base. Let's look at the bases:

A) (1 + r)  
B) (1 + r/10)  
C) (1 + 2r)  
D) (1 + sqrt(r))  
E) (1 + 1/r)

Since all the bases are of the form 1 plus something, and r is between 0 and 3, let's analyze each base:

- For A: 1 + r, since r is between 0 and 3, this base is between 1 and 4.

- For B: 1 + r/10, r is between 0 and 3, so r/10 is between 0 and 0.3, so this base is between 1 and 1.3.

- For C: 1 + 2r, since r is between 0 and 3, 2r is between 0 and 6, so this base is between 1 and 7.

- For D: 1 + sqrt(r). sqrt(r) is between 0 and sqrt(3) (~1.732), so this base is between 1 and 2.732.

- For E: 1 + 1/r. Since r is between 0 and 3, 1/r is between 1/3 (~0.333) and infinity. But since r is less than 3, 1/r is greater than 1/3. So, the base is between 1 and 1 + 1/3 = 4/3 (~1.333).

So, now, let's see which of these bases is the smallest. The smallest base will correspond to the largest x. So, comparing the bases:

- The smallest base is B) 1 + r/10, since r/10 is the smallest because r is positive. So, 1 + r/10 is the smallest base, then C) 1 + 2r, since 2r is larger than r, then A) 1 + r, then D) 1 + sqrt(r), which is smaller than 2, and E) 1 + 1/r, which is the largest because 1/r is the largest (since r is smallest in E, making 1/r the largest). Wait, is that true?

Wait, hold on. Let me think about E: 1 + 1/r. Since 0 < r < 3, 1/r is greater than 1/3. So 1 + 1/r is between 1 + 1/3 (~1.333) and infinity. So, E's base is greater than 1.333, which is larger than the base in C, which is 1 + 2r, which is 1 + 2r where r is less than 3, so 1 + 2r is less than 7. But E's base is 1 + 1/r, which is larger than 1.333, which is larger than C's base, which is 1 + 2r. Wait, is 1 + 1/r larger or smaller than 1 + 2r?

Wait, 1 + 1/r versus 1 + 2r. Since 1/r is equal to 1 divided by r, and 2r is 2 times r. So, when is 1/r larger than 2r? Let's solve 1/r > 2r.

Multiply both sides by r (since r > 0), we get 1 > 2r^2, so 2r^2 < 1, so r^2 < 0.5, so r < sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707.

So, if r < ~0.707, then 1/r > 2r. So, for r < ~0.707, 1 + 1/r > 1 + 2r, which would mean that E's base is larger than C's base.

But if r > ~0.707, then 1 + 1/r < 1 + 2r.

So, this suggests that depending on the value of r, E's base can be either larger or smaller than C's base.

Similarly, let's also check for D: 1 + sqrt(r). For r between 0 and 3, sqrt(r) is between 0 and ~1.732. So, D's base is between 1 and 2.732.

So, let's restate the bases:

A: 1 + r (1 < base < 4)  
B: 1 + r/10 (1 < base < 1.3)  
C: 1 + 2r (1 < base < 7)  
D: 1 + sqrt(r) (1 < base < ~2.732)  
E: 1 + 1/r (1 < base < ~4/3 if r is approaching 3, but actually, since r < 3, 1/r > 1/3, so E's base is between 1 and 1 + 1/3 = 4/3 (~1.333))

Wait, hold on. If r approaches 3, then 1/r approaches 1/3, so E's base approaches 1 + 1/3 = 4/3 (~1.333). So, as r increases towards 3, E's base approaches 1.333.

But for smaller r, say r = 0.5, 1/r = 2, so E's base is 3. If r is 1, E's base is 2, which is still less than C's base, which would be 3.

Wait, no, wait: If r = 1, then E's base is 2, C's base is 3. So, E's base is less than C's base. If r = 2, E's base is 1 + 1/2 = 1.5, while C's base is 1 + 4 = 5. So, E's base is still less than C's base.

Wait, but when r is approaching 3, E's base approaches 1.333, which is less than C's base which is 1 + 6 = 7. So, in all cases, E's base is less than C's base.

Wait, so E's base is 1 + 1/r, and since for 0 < r < 3, 1/r > 1/3, so 1 + 1/r > 1 + 1/3 = 4/3 (~1.333). So, E's base is between 1 and 4/3, depending on r. C's base is between 1 and 7, depending on r. Therefore, E's base is always less than C's base because 4/3 is less than 7, and 1/r is always greater than 1/3 for r < 3.

Wait, but 1 + 1/r is greater than 1 + 1/3, which is 4/3, but less than 7 when r is approaching 3, since 1 + 1/3 is 4/3, and 1 + 1/ (something less than 3) is greater than 4/3 but less than 7.

So, E's base is always between 4/3 and 7, while C's base is between 1 and 7. So, for some r, E's base is less than C's base, but not always. Wait, no, E's base is always between 4/3 and 7, and C's base is between 1 and 7. So, when r is less than 3, 1/r is greater than 1/3, so 1 + 1/r is greater than 4/3, which is greater than 1, but less than 7. So, E's base is always greater than 4/3, but less than 7. C's base is always greater than 1, but can be as high as 7 or as low as 1.

Therefore, for r < 3, E's base is always greater than 4/3, but less than 7, while C's base is greater than 1, up to 7. So, in that case, E's base is always greater than C's base for r > 1, because 1 + 1/r > 1 + 2r when 1/r > 2r, which occurs when r < sqrt(1/2) (~0.707). For r > sqrt(1/2), 1/r < 2r, so C's base is greater than E's base.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should make a table of the bases for different ranges of r.

Let's consider different ranges for r:

1. 0 < r < sqrt(1/2) (~0.707)
2. sqrt(1/2) ≤ r < 1
3. 1 ≤ r < 3

In each range, we can determine which base is smaller.

First, in the range 0 < r < sqrt(1/2) (~0.707):

- For E: 1 + 1/r. Since r < sqrt(1/2), 1/r > sqrt(2). So, 1 + 1/r > 1 + sqrt(2) (~2.414)
- For C: 1 + 2r. Since r < sqrt(1/2) (~0.707), 2r < sqrt(2) (~1.414). So, 1 + 2r < 1 + sqrt(2) (~2.414)
- Therefore, in this range, E's base is greater than C's base because E's base is greater than 2.414, and C's base is less than 2.414.

Wait, so in this range, E's base is greater than C's base.

In the range sqrt(1/2) ≤ r < 1:

- For E: 1 + 1/r. Since r is between sqrt(1/2) (~0.707) and 1, 1/r is between 1 and sqrt(2) (~1.414). So, 1 + 1/r is between 2 and ~2.414.
- For C: 1 + 2r. Since r is between 0.707 and 1, 2r is between ~1.414 and 2. So, 1 + 2r is between ~2.414 and 3.
- So, in this range, C's base is greater than E's base.

At r = sqrt(1/2), E's base is 1 + 1/sqrt(1/2) = 1 + sqrt(2) (~2.414) and C's base is 1 + 2*sqrt(1/2) = 1 + sqrt(2) (~2.414). So, they are equal at this point.

For r = 1: E's base is 2, and C's base is 3, so C's base is bigger.

Now, in the range 1 ≤ r < 3:

- For E: 1 + 1/r. Since r is between 1 and 3, 1/r is between 1/3 (~0.333) and 1. So, 1 + 1/r is between 1.333 and 2.
- For C: 1 + 2r. Since r is between 1 and 3, 2r is between 2 and 6. So, 1 + 2r is between 3 and 7.
- So, in this range, E's base is less than C's base.

So, summarizing:

- When 0 < r < sqrt(1/2), E's base > C's base.
- When sqrt(1/2) ≤ r < 1, C's base > E's base.
- When 1 ≤ r < 3, E's base < C's base.

Therefore, in the first two ranges, E's base is larger than C's base, and in the third range, E's base is smaller than C's base.

So, now, let's see how the other bases compare.

Looking at A, B, D, let's see:

- A: 1 + r
- B: 1 + r/10
- D: 1 + sqrt(r)
- E: 1 + 1/r

We already saw that in the first two ranges, E's base is larger than C's. So, in those ranges, E is larger than C, which is the largest base.

In the third range, E's base is smaller than C's base, so C is larger.

But in the other ranges, E's base is larger than C's base. So, let's focus on when E's base is larger than C's base.

In 0 < r < sqrt(1/2), E's base > C's base.

In sqrt(1/2) ≤ r < 1, C's base > E's base.

In 1 ≤ r < 3, E's base < C's base.

So, when E's base is larger than C's base, it's in 0 < r < sqrt(1/2). In that case, since E's base is larger, the solution x is smaller. When E's base is smaller than C's base, then x is larger.

So, in the first range, 0 < r < sqrt(1/2), the largest base is C, which leads to the smallest x. In the third range, 1 ≤ r < 3, the largest base is C, which leads to the smallest x as well.

But in the middle range, sqrt(1/2) ≤ r < 1, C's base is larger than E's, but E's base is larger than B, D, and A?

Wait, let me check:

Looking at B: 1 + r/10.

Since r is between 0 and 1, r/10 is between 0 and 0.1, so B's base is between 1 and 1.1.

D: 1 + sqrt(r). Since r is between 0.707 and 1, sqrt(r) is between ~0.841 and 1, so D's base is between ~1.841 and 2.

A: 1 + r, which is between 1 and 2.

So, in the middle range, sqrt(1/2) ≤ r < 1, E's base is between 1.333 and 2, C's base is between ~1.841 and 2, B's base is between 1 and 1.1, D's base is between ~1.841 and 2.

So, in the middle range, C's base is the largest, followed by D and A, then E, then B.

Wait, but in that middle range, E's base is larger than B and D, but smaller than C.

So, in that middle range, the largest base is C, so the smallest x, the smallest solution.

Wait, so in the first range, 0 < r < sqrt(1/2), E's base is larger than C's base, so the smallest x.

In the third range, 1 ≤ r < 3, E's base is smaller than C's base, so the largest x.

In the middle range, sqrt(1/2) ≤ r < 1, E's base is larger than B, D, A, but smaller than C.

So, in the middle range, the largest base is C, so the smallest x, and in other ranges, the largest base is C or D or A, leading to the smallest x.

Hence, putting it all together, the largest x is in the middle range, where E's base is smaller than C's, so the largest x.

Therefore, the equation with the largest solution x is equation E.

But wait, let me double-check. So, in the middle range, r is between ~0.707 and 1, E's base is between 1.333 and 2, C's base is between ~1.841 and 2, so C is larger, so x is smaller.

In the first range, E is larger, so x is smaller.

In the third range, E is smaller, so x is larger.

Therefore, equation E has the largest x in the middle range, which is when 0.707 ≤ r < 1. But in the problem, r is given as 0 < r < 3, so the middle range is 0.707 ≤ r < 1, which is within the given range.

So, equation E will have the largest x in that range, and in the other ranges, either equation C or other options will have larger x.

Hence, the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me take a specific example in the middle range to test.

Let me take r = 0.5, which is in the middle range. So, let's compute the bases:

- A: 1 + 0.5 = 1.5
- B: 1 + 0.05 = 1.05
- C: 1 + 2*0.5 = 2
- D: 1 + sqrt(0.5) ≈ 1 + 0.707 ≈ 1.707
- E: 1 + 1/0.5 = 1 + 2 = 3

So, in this case, E has the largest base (3), followed by C (2), then D (1.707), then A (1.5), then B (1.05). So, E's equation will have the smallest x, which is correct because E's base is the largest, which leads to the smallest x.

Now, let's take r = 0.8, which is in the middle range.

Compute the bases:

- A: 1 + 0.8 = 1.8
- B: 1 + 0.08 = 1.08
- C: 1 + 2*0.8 = 1 + 1.6 = 2.6
- D: 1 + sqrt(0.8) ≈ 1 + 0.894 ≈ 1.894
- E: 1 + 1/0.8 = 1 + 1.25 = 2.25

So, in this case, C has the largest base (2.6), followed by E (2.25), then D (1.894), then A (1.8), then B (1.08). So, equation C has the smallest x, which is correct because its base is the largest.

Now, let's take r = 0.9, which is approaching 1.

Compute the bases:

- A: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9
- B: 1 + 0.09 = 1.09
- C: 1 + 2*0.9 = 1 + 1.8 = 2.8
- D: 1 + sqrt(0.9) ≈ 1 + 0.948 ≈ 1.948
- E: 1 + 1/0.9 ≈ 1 + 1.111 ≈ 2.111

So, in this case, C is the largest base (2.8), followed by E (2.111), then D (1.948), then A (1.9), then B (1.09). So, equation C still has the smallest x, which is correct.

Now, let's take r = 0.3, which is in the first range (0 < r < sqrt(1/2)).

Compute the bases:

- A: 1 + 0.3 = 1.3
- B: 1 + 0.03 = 1.03
- C: 1 + 2*0.3 = 1 + 0.6 = 1.6
- D: 1 + sqrt(0.3) ≈ 1 + 0.547 ≈ 1.547
- E: 1 + 1/0.3 ≈ 1 + 3.333 ≈ 4.333

So, in this case, E has the largest base (4.333), followed by C (1.6), then D (1.547), then A (1.3), then B (1.03). So, equation E will have the smallest x, which is correct because E's base is the largest.

Now, let's take r = 0.95, which is in the middle range.

Compute the bases:

- A: 1 + 0.95 = 1.95
- B: 1 + 0.095 = 1.095
- C: 1 + 2*0.95 = 1 + 1.9 = 2.9
- D: 1 + sqrt(0.95) ≈ 1 + 0.974 ≈ 1.974
- E: 1 + 1/0.95 ≈ 1 + 1.052 ≈ 2.052

So, in this case, C has the largest base (2.9), followed by E (2.052), then D (1.974), then A (1.95), then B (1.095). So, equation C has the smallest x, correct.

Now, take r = 0.85, middle range:

- A: 1 + 0.85 = 1.85
- B: 1 + 0.085 = 1.085
- C: 1 + 2*0.85 = 1 + 1.7 = 2.7
- D: 1 + sqrt(0.85) ≈ 1 + 0.922 ≈ 1.922
- E: 1 + 1/0.85 ≈ 1 + 1.176 ≈ 2.176

So, C is the largest base (2.7), followed by E (2.176), then D (1.922), then A (1.85), then B (1.085). So, equation C has the smallest x.

Now, take r = 0.7, which is the lower bound of the middle range.

- A: 1 + 0.7 = 1.7
- B: 1 + 0.07 = 1.07
- C: 1 + 2*0.7 = 1 + 1.4 = 2.4
- D: 1 + sqrt(0.7) ≈ 1 + 0.836 ≈ 1.836
- E: 1 + 1/0.7 ≈ 1 + 1.428 ≈ 2.428

So, in this case, C is the largest base (2.4), followed by E (2.428), then D (1.836), then A (1.7), then B (1.07). So, equation C has the smallest x.

Wait, in this case, E's base is slightly larger than C's, but since C is larger, E's x is smaller. So, equation E is smaller than C, but in this case, equation C is larger, so equation E still has the smallest x.

Wait, but hold on, in this case, E's base is 2.428, which is larger than C's 2.4. So, since E's base is larger, does that mean E's x is smaller or larger?

Wait, no, because to get the same result, if we have 3(1 + r)^x = 7, then (1 + r)^x = 7/3 ≈ 2.333. So, the base is 1 + r.

So, if the base is larger, the exponent x needed to reach 7/3 is smaller.

Therefore, if E's base is larger, x is smaller.

But in this case, E has a larger base than C, so x is smaller.

So, in this case, equation E still has the smallest x.

Wait, so equation E's x is smallest in all cases, regardless of whether it's in the first or middle or third range.

But in the first range, E's base is larger, so its x is smaller, which is consistent.

In the middle range, E's base is still larger than C, so x is smaller.

In the third range, E's base is smaller than C, so x is larger.

Therefore, equation E always has the smallest x, except in the third range, where C has the smallest x.

But since the question is asking for which equation has the largest solution x, it's equation E.

So, I think after all that, the answer is E.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{E}
</think>

To determine which equation has the largest solution \( x \), we start by rewriting each equation in the form \( 3(1 + \text{base})^x = 7 \). Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

\[
(1 + \text{base})^x = \frac{7}{3}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we have:

\[
x = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{7}{3}\right)}{\ln(\text{base})}
\]

The solution \( x \) is inversely proportional to the natural logarithm of the base. Therefore, the larger the base, the smaller the \( x \). Conversely, the smaller the base, the larger the \( x \).

We analyze the bases for each equation:
- \( A: 1 + r \)
- \( B: 1 + \sqrt{r} \)
- \( C: 1 + 2r \)
- \( D: 1 + \sqrt{r} \)
- \( E: 1 + \frac{1}{r} \)

We compare the bases for different ranges of \( r \):
1. For \( 0 < r < \sqrt{1/2} \), \( E \)'s base is larger than \( C \)'s base.
2. For \( \sqrt{1/2} \leq r < 1 \), \( C \)'s base is larger than \( E \)'s base.
3. For \( 1 \leq r < 3 \), \( E \)'s base is smaller than \( C \)'s base.

In the middle range \( \sqrt{1/2} \leq r < 1 \), \( C \)'s base is the largest, leading to the smallest \( x \). In the third range \( 1 \leq r < 3 \), \( E \)'s base is the smallest, leading to the largest \( x \).

Thus, the equation with the largest solution \( x \) is equation \( E \).

\[
\boxed{E}
\]
