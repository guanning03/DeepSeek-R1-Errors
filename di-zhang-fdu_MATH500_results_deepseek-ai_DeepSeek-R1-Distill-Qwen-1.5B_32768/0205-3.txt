Correct Answer:
$\triangle DBC$ has base $\overline{BC}$ of length 8 and height $\overline{BD}$ of length 3; therefore, its area is $\frac{1}{2}\times8\times 3=12$.

The area of quadrilateral $DBEF$ equals the area of $\triangle DBC$ minus the area of $\triangle FEC$.

$\triangle FEC$ has base $EC=BC-BE=8-4=4$. The height of $\triangle FEC$ is equal to the vertical distance from point $F$ to the $x$-axis, which is equal to the $y$-coordinate of point $F$, or 2. Therefore, the area of $\triangle FEC$ is $\frac{1}{2}\times4\times 2=4$.

Finally, the area of quadrilateral $DBEF$ is $12-4=\boxed{8}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I need to figure out the area of quadrilateral DFEF. Wait, hold on, looking back at the Asymptote code, it says draw(E--A--C--D); and draw((-1,0)--(10,0), EndArrow); and draw((0,-1)--(0,8), EndArrow); so the quadrilateral is D-E-F-B? Wait, no, the Asymptote code says draw(E--A--C--D); and draw((-1,0)--(10,0), EndArrow); draw((0,-1)--(0,8), EndArrow); So E is connected to A, A to C, C to D, and then E is connected to A, A to C, C to D, but I think the diagram is more about lines between those points. Wait, maybe the quadrilateral is D-E-F-B? But the Asymptote code says draw(E--A--C--D). So E is connected to A, A to C, C to D. Then E is connected to A, A to C, C to D. So, is the quadrilateral D-E-F-B? Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the quadrilateral is D-E-F-B? Let me try to parse the Asymptote code again. The code defines A, B, C, D, E, F. Then draws E--A--C--D. So that's the path E to A to C to D. Then it draws the axes. So, quadrilateral D-E-F-B? Wait, but in the Asymptote code, F is at (8/3, 2). So, let me see the coordinates:

A is at (0,6), B is at (0,0), C is at (8,0), D is at (0,3), E is at (4,0), and F is at (8/3, 2). So, quadrilateral DFEB? Or D-E-F-B? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the lines drawn are E--A--C--D. So E is connected to A, A to C, C to D. So, the figure is E-A-C-D-E? So, a polygon connecting E to A to C to D to E. So, that's a quadrilateral, but in the Asymptote code, it's called E--A--C--D, so it's a four-sided figure. Then, in the diagram, there's another line from E to A to C to D, perhaps? But the Asymptote code draws E--A--C--D, so that's a polygon E-A-C-D-E. Then, it draws the axes, so maybe the quadrilateral is a part of that polygon.

But the problem says quadrilateral DFEF? Wait, that can't be right because F is already a point. Wait, maybe it's D-E-F-B? Because in the Asymptote code, F is at (8/3,2), which is somewhere on the line from C to B. So, perhaps quadrilateral D-E-F-B? So, connecting D to E to F to B and back to D? Let me see.

So, given the coordinates of D, E, F, and B, we can plot these points.

D is at (0,3), E is at (4,0), F is at (8/3,2), and B is at (0,0). So, quadrilateral D-E-F-B. So, connecting D(0,3) to E(4,0) to F(8/3,2) to B(0,0) and back to D(0,3). Okay, so that's the quadrilateral whose area we need to find. Hmm, so maybe I can use the shoelace formula for coordinates.

Yes, the shoelace formula is a good method for finding the area of a polygon when you know the coordinates of its vertices. So, let's list the coordinates of the quadrilateral in order:

D: (0,3)

E: (4,0)

F: (8/3, 2)

B: (0,0)

So, the coordinates are (0,3), (4,0), (8/3, 2), (0,0). Let me write them in order:

1. (0,3)

2. (4,0)

3. (8/3, 2)

4. (0,0)

And back to the first point (0,3) to complete the cycle.

So, using the shoelace formula, the formula is:

Area = 1/2 |sum from i=1 to n of (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|

Where (x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (x_1, y_1)

So, let's compute each term step by step.

First, list the coordinates:

1. D: (0,3)

2. E: (4,0)

3. F: (8/3, 2)

4. B: (0,0)

5. D: (0,3)  -- back to the first point

Now, calculate x_i y_{i+1} and x_{i+1} y_i for each i.

i=1: x1=0, y1=3; x2=4, y2=0

Term1: x1 y2 = 0 * 0 = 0

Term2: x2 y1 = 4 * 3 = 12

Difference: Term1 - Term2 = 0 - 12 = -12

i=2: x2=4, y2=0; x3=8/3, y3=2

Term1: 4 * 2 = 8

Term2: (8/3) * 0 = 0

Difference: 8 - 0 = 8

i=3: x3=8/3, y3=2; x4=0, y4=0

Term1: (8/3) * 0 = 0

Term2: 0 * 2 = 0

Difference: 0 - 0 = 0

i=4: x4=0, y4=0; x5=0, y5=3

Term1: 0 * 3 = 0

Term2: 0 * 0 = 0

Difference: 0 - 0 = 0

Now, sum all the differences: (-12) + 8 + 0 + 0 = -4

Take the absolute value: | -4 | = 4

Multiply by 1/2: 1/2 * 4 = 2

So, the area is 2.

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify the shoelace formula step by step.

Alternatively, I can list all the terms as per shoelace:

Compute sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

(0)(0) + (4)(2) + (8/3)(0) + (0)(3) = 0 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 8

Compute sum of x_{i+1} y_i:

(4)(3) + (8/3)(0) + (0)(2) + (0)(0) = 12 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 12

Subtract the two sums: 8 - 12 = -4

Take absolute value and multiply by 1/2: | -4 | * 1/2 = 2

Yes, same result. So, the area is 2.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the order of the points? Let me double-check the coordinates of F.

Looking back, Asymptote code says F is at (8/3, 2). So, 8/3 is approximately 2.666..., which is between 2 and 3. So, in the diagram, F is somewhere along the line from C(8,0) to B(0,0). So, it's not on the top edge, but on the bottom edge, closer to C.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawn as E--A--C--D, so that's E to A to C to D, which is a polygon. Then, F is another point, (8/3,2). So, in the quadrilateral D-E-F-B, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can divide the quadrilateral into triangles or other shapes to compute the area, but shoelace seems straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors or coordinate geometry.

Wait, another way is to compute the area of the entire figure and subtract the areas not included in D-E-F-B.

But perhaps shoelace is the simplest.

Wait, but just to make sure, let's see.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or determinants.

But I think shoelace is the way to go here.

Wait, let me double check the coordinates:

D: (0,3)

E: (4,0)

F: (8/3, 2)

B: (0,0)

So, the shoelace formula gives 2.

But let me visualize the figure. From D(0,3) to E(4,0): that's a line going down to E. Then E(4,0) to F(8/3,2): that's a line going up a bit. Then F(8/3,2) to B(0,0): that's a line going left and down. Then B to D: from (0,0) to (0,3): straight up. So, it's a quadrilateral that's a trapezoid or something.

Wait, is the area 2? That seems small given the figure.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the area by breaking into parts.

From D(0,3) to E(4,0): that's a line. Then from E(4,0) to F(8/3,2): that's another line. From F(8/3,2) to B(0,0): that's another line. Then from B(0,0) back to D(0,3): that's a vertical line.

So, maybe the quadrilateral is a trapezoid? Wait, not necessarily, because the sides are not necessarily parallel.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to find the area.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the area of E-F-B and something else.

Wait, let me try another method: coordinates.

Compute the area using the shoelace formula step by step.

List the coordinates in order:

1. D: (0,3)

2. E: (4,0)

3. F: (8/3, 2)

4. B: (0,0)

5. D: (0,3)

Compute the sum of x_i * y_{i+1}:

(0)(0) + (4)(2) + (8/3)(0) + (0)(3) = 0 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 8

Compute the sum of y_i * x_{i+1}:

(3)(4) + (0)(8/3) + (2)(0) + (0)(0) = 12 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 12

Subtract the two sums: 8 - 12 = -4

Take absolute value: 4

Multiply by 1/2: 2

So, the area is 2. So, same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors.

Compute vectors for each side and use the cross product.

But, that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using determinants.

But since shoelace gives 2, and that seems consistent, maybe 2 is the correct answer.

But wait, just to make sure, let me try another approach.

Let me compute the area of the entire figure and subtract the areas not included in D-E-F-B.

Looking at the figure, the entire figure is a quadrilateral E-A-C-D, which is a trapezoid? Wait, let's see.

Wait, E is at (4,0), A is at (0,6), C is at (8,0), D is at (0,3).

So, the quadrilateral E-A-C-D is a trapezoid? Or maybe a convex quadrilateral.

Wait, sides EA, AC, CD, DE.

EA: from E(4,0) to A(0,6). The slope is (6-0)/(0-4)= -1.5

AC: from A(0,6) to C(8,0). The slope is (0-6)/(8-0)= -6/8= -3/4

CD: from C(8,0) to D(0,3). The slope is (3-0)/(0-8)= 3/(-8)= -3/8

DE: from D(0,3) to E(4,0). The slope is (0-3)/(4-0)= -3/4

Wait, so EA has slope -1.5, AC has slope -3/4, CD has slope -3/8, DE has slope -3/4.

So, the sides EA, AC, and DE all have the same slope? Wait, EA is -1.5, AC is -3/4≈-0.75, DE is -3/4≈-0.75. So, AC and DE have the same slope, but EA has a different slope.

Wait, so quadrilateral E-A-C-D is not a trapezoid because only two sides have the same slope.

Wait, actually, only AC and DE have the same slope, so it's a trapezoid? Wait, no, in a trapezoid, only one pair of sides is parallel. Wait, but AC and DE have the same slope, so they are parallel.

Wait, hold on, let me compute slopes more precisely.

Slope of EA: (6 - 0)/(0 - 4)= 6 / (-4)= -3/2= -1.5

Slope of AC: (0 -6)/(8 - 0)= -6/8= -3/4= -0.75

Slope of CD: (3 - 0)/(0 -8)= 3/(-8)= -3/8= -0.375

Slope of DE: (0 -3)/(4 -0)= (-3)/4= -0.75

So, AC and DE have the same slope, so they are parallel. Therefore, quadrilateral E-A-C-D is a trapezoid because it has one pair of sides parallel (AC and DE). So, the area of E-A-C-D is the area of a trapezoid.

The formula for the area of a trapezoid is (1/2)*(sum of the lengths of the two parallel sides)*height.

So, in this case, the two parallel sides are AC and DE.

Compute lengths of AC and DE.

Length of AC: from A(0,6) to C(8,0). Using distance formula: sqrt((8-0)^2 + (0-6)^2)=sqrt(64 + 36)=sqrt(100)=10

Length of DE: from D(0,3) to E(4,0). Distance: sqrt((4-0)^2 + (0-3)^2)=sqrt(16 + 9)=sqrt(25)=5

So, the two parallel sides are 10 and 5.

Now, to find the height between these two sides.

Since AC and DE are the two parallel sides, the height is the distance between the lines AC and DE.

We can compute this distance by finding the equations of lines AC and DE and then computing the distance between them.

First, find the equation of line AC.

Points A(0,6) and C(8,0). The slope is -3/4, as computed earlier.

Equation using point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1). Let's use point A(0,6):

y -6 = (-3/4)(x - 0)

So, y = (-3/4)x + 6

Similarly, equation of line DE: points D(0,3) and E(4,0). Slope is -3/4.

Using point D(0,3):

y -3 = (-3/4)(x - 0)

So, y = (-3/4)x + 3

So, both lines AC and DE have the same slope, so they are indeed parallel.

The distance between two parallel lines y = mx + c1 and y = mx + c2 is given by |c1 - c2| / sqrt(m^2 + 1)

Here, c1 is 6 (from line AC: y = (-3/4)x + 6) and c2 is 3 (from line DE: y = (-3/4)x + 3)

So, the distance is |6 - 3| / sqrt( (-3/4)^2 + 1 ) = 3 / sqrt(9/16 + 16/16)= 3 / sqrt(25/16)= 3 / (5/4)= 3*(4/5)= 12/5= 2.4

So, the height is 12/5.

Therefore, area of trapezoid E-A-C-D is (1/2)*(10 + 5)*(12/5)= (1/2)*(15)*(12/5)= (1/2)*(36)= 18

Wait, but the area of E-A-C-D is 18, but earlier, the shoelace formula gave me the area of D-E-F-B as 2. But this is the area of the trapezoid E-A-C-D, which is 18.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the figure is E--A--C--D, which is a quadrilateral, and in the problem, we're asked for quadrilateral D-E-F-B.

Wait, so if the trapezoid E-A-C-D is 18, and the entire figure is also a quadrilateral, but I need the area of D-E-F-B.

Wait, maybe I can compute the area of E-F-B and subtract something? Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the drawing is E--A--C--D, which is the same as the quadrilateral E-A-C-D. So, the entire figure is E-A-C-D, which is 18, and then F is another point inside or outside of the figure? Wait, looking back, the coordinates of F are (8/3, 2), which is on the line from C(8,0) to B(0,0), closer to C.

So, quadrilateral D-E-F-B is a four-sided figure inside the original figure E-A-C-D.

So, maybe to find its area, I can subtract the area of triangle E-F-B from the area of E-A-C-D.

But wait, is that accurate? Or perhaps, since F is on CB, maybe D-E-F-B is a trapezoid or another shape.

Alternatively, maybe I can divide quadrilateral D-E-F-B into two parts: triangle D-E-F and triangle D-F-B.

But wait, let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates.

Compute the area of quadrilateral D-E-F-B.

Points:

D: (0,3)

E: (4,0)

F: (8/3, 2)

B: (0,0)

So, using shoelace formula again:

List the coordinates:

1. D: (0,3)

2. E: (4,0)

3. F: (8/3, 2)

4. B: (0,0)

5. D: (0,3)

Compute the sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

(0)(0) + (4)(2) + (8/3)(0) + (0)(3) = 0 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 8

Sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

(3)(4) + (0)(8/3) + (2)(0) + (0)(0) = 12 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 12

Difference: 8 - 12 = -4

Area: 1/2 | -4 | = 2

Wait, same result.

So, regardless of the method, I get 2.

Alternatively, maybe my initial assumption was wrong, and quadrilateral D-E-F-B is not convex or something.

Wait, but with the coordinates given, it's a trapezoid, but the shoelace formula is giving me 2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a convex quadrilateral, but the area is 2.

But I'm a bit confused because 2 seems small given the size of the figure.

Wait, if the entire area of E-A-C-D is 18, and D-E-F-B is 2, then the rest of the figure is 16. But maybe I should check.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is indeed 2.

Wait, let me try another approach. Coordinates of D, E, F, B.

We can use vectors to compute the area.

Let me define vectors from D to E, D to F, and D to B.

But actually, since D is (0,3), E is (4,0), F is (8/3,2), B is (0,0).

We can use the formula for the area of a quadrilateral given by coordinates.

Alternatively, we can use the formula for the area of a polygon with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ..., (xn, yn):

Area = 1/2 |sum_{i=1 to n} (xi yi+1 - xi+1 yi)|

Which is essentially the shoelace formula.

So, since I've done that multiple times and the result is 2, perhaps that is correct.

But to double-check, perhaps I can compute the area by breaking the quadrilateral D-E-F-B into two triangles: D-E-F and D-F-B.

Compute area of triangle D-E-F and area of triangle D-F-B, then add them up.

First, triangle D-E-F: points D(0,3), E(4,0), F(8/3,2)

Area can be computed using determinant formula:

Area = 1/2 | (x_D(y_E - y_F) + x_E(y_F - y_D) + x_F(y_D - y_E)) |

Plugging in:

= 1/2 | 0*(0 - 2) + 4*(2 - 3) + (8/3)*(3 - 0) |

= 1/2 | 0 + 4*(-1) + (8/3)*3 |

= 1/2 | 0 -4 + 8 |

= 1/2 |4| = 2

So, area of triangle D-E-F is 2.

Second, triangle D-F-B: points D(0,3), F(8/3,2), B(0,0)

Compute area using determinant formula:

Area = 1/2 |x_D(y_F - y_B) + x_F(y_B - y_D) + x_B(y_D - y_F)|

Plugging in:

= 1/2 |0*(2 - 0) + (8/3)*(0 - 3) + 0*(3 - 2)|

= 1/2 |0 + (8/3)*(-3) + 0|

= 1/2 |0 -8 + 0| = 1/2 | -8 | = 4

So, area of triangle D-F-B is 4.

Therefore, total area of quadrilateral D-E-F-B is 2 + 4 = 6

Wait, but that contradicts the shoelace formula result of 2. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because in the first method, I broke the quadrilateral into two triangles, D-E-F and D-F-B, but actually, in the figure, quadrilateral D-E-F-B is a four-sided figure, which is not necessarily composed of triangles D-E-F and D-F-B.

Wait, actually, point F is not inside triangle D-F-B, but rather, it's another point connected to D and B.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the diagram. Let me visualize again.

Quadrilateral D-E-F-B: points D, E, F, B.

From D(0,3) to E(4,0) to F(8/3,2) to B(0,0) back to D.

So, if I connect D to E to F to B, it's a quadrilateral that is not convex? Or is it convex?

Wait, point F is on CB, which is the base. So, from E(4,0) to F(8/3,2) to B(0,0). So, the quadrilateral is D(0,3) connected to E(4,0) connected to F(8/3,2) connected to B(0,0) connected back to D(0,3). So, in this case, is the quadrilateral convex?

Looking at the coordinates, the points are arranged in a way that the quadrilateral is convex? Or is it concave?

Wait, from D(0,3) to E(4,0) is a downward slope, E(4,0) to F(8/3,2) is a slight upward slope, F(8/3,2) to B(0,0) is a steep downward slope, and B(0,0) back to D(0,3) is a vertical line.

So, the quadrilateral is convex because all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

Therefore, it's a convex quadrilateral.

Therefore, the area can be computed as the sum of the areas of two triangles: D-E-F and D-B-F.

Wait, but in that case, triangle D-B-F is the same as triangle D-F-B.

Wait, no, triangle D-B-F is the same as triangle D-F-B.

Alternatively, divide the quadrilateral into triangles D-E-F and E-F-B.

Wait, maybe that's a better approach.

Compute area of triangle D-E-F and triangle E-F-B.

Compute area of triangle D-E-F:

Points D(0,3), E(4,0), F(8/3,2)

Using determinant formula:

Area = 1/2 | (0*(0 - 2) + 4*(2 - 3) + (8/3)*(3 - 0)) |

= 1/2 | 0 + 4*(-1) + (8/3)*3 |

= 1/2 | 0 -4 + 8 | = 1/2 |4| = 2

Compute area of triangle E-F-B:

Points E(4,0), F(8/3,2), B(0,0)

Using determinant formula:

Area = 1/2 | 4*(2 - 0) + (8/3)*(0 - 0) + 0*(0 - 2)|

= 1/2 | 4*2 + 0 + 0 | = 1/2 |8| = 4

Therefore, total area is 2 + 4 = 6

Wait, but this contradicts the shoelace formula result of 2.

Wait, so now I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the decomposition.

Wait, quadrilateral D-E-F-B is made up of two triangles: D-E-F and E-F-B. So, adding their areas should give the area of the quadrilateral. But according to this, it's 2 + 4 = 6.

But earlier, shoelace formula gave 2, so which one is correct?

Wait, let me compute the area of quadrilateral D-E-F-B using the shoelace formula again.

Points in order:

1. D(0,3)

2. E(4,0)

3. F(8/3,2)

4. B(0,0)

5. D(0,3)

Compute sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

(0)(0) + (4)(2) + (8/3)(0) + (0)(3) = 0 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 8

Compute sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

(3)(4) + (0)(8/3) + (2)(0) + (0)(0) = 12 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 12

Subtract: 8 - 12 = -4

Take absolute value and multiply by 1/2: | -4 | * 1/2 = 2

Wait, so shoelace formula gives 2.

But when I decomposed the quadrilateral into two triangles, D-E-F and E-F-B, I get 2 + 4 = 6, which is different.

So, there's inconsistency here.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the decomposition.

Wait, perhaps the quadrilateral D-E-F-B is actually a pentagon? Wait, no, it's a quadrilateral.

Wait, perhaps when I decomposed it into D-E-F and E-F-B, the area of E-F-B is not 4.

Wait, let me recalculate the area of triangle E-F-B.

Points E(4,0), F(8/3,2), B(0,0)

Using the determinant formula:

Area = 1/2 |x_E(y_F - y_B) + x_F(y_B - y_E) + x_B(y_E - y_F)|

= 1/2 |4*(2 - 0) + (8/3)*(0 - 0) + 0*(0 - 2)|

= 1/2 |8 + 0 + 0| = 4

So, that's correct.

But then, the area of the quadrilateral D-E-F-B is 2 + 4 = 6, but shoelace formula says 2.

So, one of the approaches must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the points order.

Wait, when I applied the shoelace formula, I went from D to E to F to B and back to D. But maybe the order is different.

Wait, in the shoelace formula, the order of the points must be either clockwise or counterclockwise without crossing.

Wait, let me check the order.

Point D is (0,3), E is (4,0), F is (8/3, 2), B is (0,0). So, plotting these points, D is at top, E is at bottom right, F is somewhere in the middle, and B is at the origin.

So, the order D-E-F-B is clockwise.

But in the shoelace formula, the order should be either clockwise or counterclockwise.

If I connected the points in the order D-E-F-B, that's clockwise, so shoelace formula should work.

Wait, but in the first decomposition, I split into D-E-F and E-F-B, but that is not a decomposition of D-E-F-B.

Wait, no, actually, D-E-F-B is a quadrilateral, so it can be split into D-E-F and D-F-B.

Wait, maybe that's the correct decomposition.

Compute area of D-E-F: 2

Compute area of D-F-B: 4

Total area: 6

But shoelace formula says 2.

Wait, so now I am really confused.

Wait, perhaps I have to think about the figure again.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing E--A--C--D, which is the same as D-E-F-B?

Wait, no, wait, E--A--C--D is the same as the quadrilateral E-A-C-D, which is a trapezoid.

But in the problem, the area is quadrilateral D-E-F-B, which is a four-sided figure.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I misapplied the shoelace formula earlier.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, D-E-F-B is plotted, but perhaps the figure is being drawn differently.

Wait, the Asymptote code draws E--A--C--D, so that's the trapezoid E-A-C-D. Then, the figure is drawn with E--A--C--D, and also the lines drawn are E--A, A--C, C--D, D--E, but then also F is a point at (8/3,2). So, maybe the quadrilateral D-E-F-B is a different figure.

Wait, perhaps the Asymptote code is confusing the quadrilateral.

Wait, perhaps I have to think about the coordinates again.

Wait, if D is (0,3), E is (4,0), F is (8/3, 2), B is (0,0).

So, quadrilateral D-E-F-B is a four-sided figure with vertices at these points.

But when I apply shoelace formula, I get 2, but when I decompose it into two triangles, I get 6. So, which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area using vectors or parametric equations.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to compute the area.

Another approach: using the area formula for a quadrilateral with coordinates.

But wait, since we have the coordinates, shoelace formula is straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the shoelace formula.

Wait, let me recheck the shoelace formula steps.

Coordinates:

1. D: (0,3)

2. E: (4,0)

3. F: (8/3, 2)

4. B: (0,0)

5. D: (0,3)

Compute sum of x_i * y_{i+1}:

0 * 0 = 0

4 * 2 = 8

8/3 * 0 = 0

0 * 3 = 0

Total: 0 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 8

Compute sum of y_i * x_{i+1}:

3 * 4 = 12

0 * 8/3 = 0

2 * 0 = 0

0 * 0 = 0

Total: 12 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 12

Compute difference: 8 - 12 = -4

Take absolute value: 4

Multiply by 1/2: 2

So, shoelace formula gives 2.

Wait, so that's correct.

But when I decomposed it into two triangles, D-E-F and E-F-B, I get 2 + 4 = 6, which is inconsistent.

But wait, perhaps I miscounted the triangles.

Wait, quadrilateral D-E-F-B is made up of two triangles: D-E-F and D-F-B.

Wait, but in that case, the area would be 2 + 4 = 6, but the shoelace formula says 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangles D-E-F and D-F-B are not both inside the quadrilateral.

Wait, no, D-E-F-B is a convex quadrilateral, so triangles D-E-F and E-F-B are both inside it.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the figure.

Alternatively, perhaps the shoelace formula is correctly giving 2, and the decomposition is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the quadrilateral D-E-F-B is not a convex polygon, but a concave one.

Wait, looking at the points, D(0,3), E(4,0), F(8/3,2), B(0,0). The point F is on CB, which is the base. So, in the quadrilateral D-E-F-B, the point F is between E and B? Wait, no, F is at (8/3, 2), which is on CB, which is from (8,0) to (0,0), so F is somewhere between C and B.

So, the quadrilateral D-E-F-B is a convex quadrilateral.

Therefore, the area should be 2.

But why does the decomposition give 6? That suggests that the quadrilateral is being divided into two triangles whose combined area is 6, but that can't be.

Wait, unless one of the triangles is subtracting.

Wait, no, when I computed the area of D-E-F as 2 and E-F-B as 4, that's 6, but the shoelace formula is correct.

Wait, maybe the triangles are not both inside the quadrilateral?

Wait, point D-E-F-B is a quadrilateral, so triangles D-E-F and D-F-B are both inside it.

But their combined area is 2 + 4 = 6, which is more than the shoelace result.

Wait, that can't be. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in decomposition.

Wait, perhaps the decomposition is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the quadrilateral D-E-F-B is not D-E-F and D-F-B, but D-E-F and E-F-B.

But then, D-E-F and E-F-B would be overlapping.

Wait, no, in that case, it's just two triangles.

Wait, unless the quadrilateral is being split into D-E-F and D-F-B, but the area is 2 + 4 = 6.

But shoelace formula says 2.

Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the shoelace formula.

Wait, maybe I should use a different order.

Wait, let me try reordering the points.

If I go D-E-F-B, but make sure the order is correct.

Wait, in the shoelace formula, the order of the points must be either clockwise or counterclockwise without crossing.

Wait, let's see:

From D(0,3) to E(4,0): this is a downward slope.

From E(4,0) to F(8/3,2): this is a slight upward slope.

From F(8/3,2) to B(0,0): this is a steep downward slope.

From B(0,0) back to D(0,3): this is a vertical line.

So, in terms of the order, it's a clockwise traversal.

So, shoelace formula should work.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use another method.

Compute the area using vectors.

Take D as the origin, then vectors DE, DF, and DB.

Wait, but perhaps not.

Alternatively, compute the area by integrating.

Wait, but that's too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps use coordinates to compute the area.

Wait, given that the shoelace formula is giving me 2, and the problem arises when I decompose into two triangles. So, perhaps, in reality, the area is 2.

But then, 2 seems too small.

Wait, let's recast the problem.

Wait, if the entire figure is a trapezoid E-A-C-D with area 18, and D-E-F-B is a subfigure within it.

If D-E-F-B is 2, then the rest of the figure is 16.

Alternatively, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the Asymptote code is drawing E--A--C--D and then E--A--C--D and F--E?

Wait, no, the Asymptote code says "draw(E--A--C--D); draw((-1,0)--(10,0), EndArrow); draw((0,-1)--(0,8), EndArrow);"

So, the figure is the trapezoid E-A-C-D with lines on the axes. Then, F is a point on CB.

Wait, so perhaps the figure is the trapezoid E-A-C-D, and then, on top of that, there's a line from F to E, creating a quadrilateral D-E-F-B.

So, the figure is the trapezoid E-A-C-D, and the line FE is another edge.

Thus, the quadrilateral D-E-F-B is a four-sided figure inside the trapezoid E-A-C-D.

So, in that case, the shoelace formula is correctly giving 2.

But then, when I decomposed it into two triangles, I get 6, which is inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the decomposition.

Wait, D-E-F-B is a quadrilateral. Let me compute its area using another method.

Compute the area by using the coordinates:

We can use the formula for the area of a quadrilateral with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), (x4,y4):

Area = 1/2 | (x1y2 - x2y1) + (x2y3 - x3y2) + (x3y4 - x4y3) + (x4y1 - x1y4) |

Wait, that's another version of the shoelace formula.

Compute each term:

First term: x1y2 - x2y1 = 0*0 - 4*3 = 0 - 12 = -12

Second term: x2y3 - x3y2 = 4*2 - (8/3)*0 = 8 - 0 = 8

Third term: x3y4 - x4y3 = (8/3)*0 - 0*2 = 0 - 0 = 0

Fourth term: x4y1 - x1y4 = 0*3 - 0*0 = 0 - 0 = 0

Sum of terms: -12 + 8 + 0 + 0 = -4

Take absolute value: 4

Multiply by 1/2: 2

Therefore, area is 2.

Hence, the shoelace formula is correctly giving 2.

Therefore, the earlier decomposition into two triangles was incorrect.

Wait, why? Because when I decomposed the quadrilateral D-E-F-B into D-E-F and D-F-B, the area came out to 6, but shoelace formula says 2.

Wait, perhaps the decomposition is incorrect because the quadrilateral is not convex or something.

Wait, but from the coordinates, it's convex.

Wait, maybe I have to re-examine the decomposition.

Wait, in reality, quadrilateral D-E-F-B is made up of two triangles: D-E-F and E-F-B.

But wait, in this case, triangle E-F-B is not entirely inside the quadrilateral.

Wait, point F is (8/3,2), which is on CB.

So, triangle E-F-B would have points E(4,0), F(8/3,2), B(0,0).

But in the quadrilateral D-E-F-B, point F is connected to B, so triangle E-F-B is part of the quadrilateral.

So, if I compute the area of D-E-F as 2 and E-F-B as 4, adding to 6, that's incorrect.

Wait, but according to shoelace formula, the area is 2.

Therefore, the problem is that triangle E-F-B is not entirely inside the quadrilateral.

Wait, no, point F is connected to B, which is a vertex of the quadrilateral.

Wait, perhaps the area is being overcounted.

Wait, perhaps the quadrilateral D-E-F-B is not the union of D-E-F and D-F-B, but rather D-E-F and E-F-B.

But in that case, the shoelace formula being 2 is correct, so the decomposition is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is indeed 2, and the quadrilateral D-E-F-B is a different figure.

Wait, perhaps the Asymptote code is drawing E--A--C--D and F--A--C--D, but that's not the case.

Wait, the code says:

draw(E--A--C--D);

draw((-1,0)--(10,0), EndArrow);

draw((0,-1)--(0,8), EndArrow);

label("$D$", D, NW);

label("$E$", E, NW);

label("$F$", F, SW);

label("$B$", B, SW);

So, the figure is drawn with E--A--C--D, and E--A--C--D is connected to F, but F is a separate point.

So, quadrilateral D-E-F-B is a separate figure.

Therefore, perhaps the area is 2.

Wait, but in the decomposition into D-E-F and D-F-B, which is 2 + 4 = 6, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the quadrilateral D-E-F-B is a five-sided figure, but no, it's four sides.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct coordinates.

Wait, in the shoelace formula, I have points D(0,3), E(4,0), F(8/3,2), B(0,0), and back to D(0,3).

The area is 2.

But that seems too small, considering the entire trapezoid E-A-C-D has area 18.

Wait, unless the figure is different.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the area of D-E-F-B using another method.

Wait, perhaps using the area of trapezoid D-E-F-B.

Wait, but D-E-F-B is not a trapezoid.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps compute the area using the coordinates.

Wait, another way is to compute the area using the formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices.

But that's the shoelace formula.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that in the shoelace formula, the points must be ordered either clockwise or counterclockwise.

But in this case, the points are ordered D-E-F-B, which is clockwise.

Wait, let me check.

Plotting the points:

D(0,3), E(4,0), F(8/3,2), B(0,0).

Moving from D(0,3) to E(4,0) is down and right.

From E(4,0) to F(8/3,2) is up and left.

From F(8/3,2) to B(0,0) is down and left.

From B(0,0) back to D(0,3) is up.

So, the traversal is clockwise.

Therefore, shoelace formula should work.

But why, when decomposed, gives a different result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the decomposition is incorrect.

Wait, if I consider quadrilateral D-E-F-B, perhaps it's not D-E-F-B, but a different quadrilateral.

Wait, let me check.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing E--A--C--D, then drawing F--A--C--D.

But F is a separate point, so maybe the figure is D-E-F-B connected via E-F-B.

Wait, no, in the figure, it's drawn as D-E-F-B, so connecting D to E to F to B.

Therefore, it's a quadrilateral.

But then, as per shoelace formula, it's 2, but as per decomposition, 6.

But perhaps the shoelace formula is correct because the decomposition is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the coordinates of F.

Wait, F is at (8/3, 2), which is (approximately 2.666, 2).

So, the quadrilateral D-E-F-B is a four-sided figure with vertices at (0,3), (4,0), (8/3,2), (0,0).

Wait, if I connect these points, it's a quadrilateral that's slanting.

Wait, perhaps the area is indeed 2, as per shoelace formula.

Wait, I think I need to accept that the shoelace formula is correct, and the area is 2.

Therefore, the area of quadrilateral D-E-F-B is 2.

Thus, the answer is \boxed{2}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2}
</think>

To determine the area of quadrilateral \(D-E-F-B\), we start by identifying the coordinates of the points involved. Point \(D\) is at \((0, 3)\), point \(E\) is at \((4, 0)\), point \(F\) is at \(\left(\frac{8}{3}, 2\right)\), and point \(B\) is at \((0, 0)\).

We use the shoelace formula to find the area of the quadrilateral. The shoelace formula is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) \right|
\]

Listing the coordinates in order and repeating the first point at the end:

1. \(D(0, 3)\)
2. \(E(4, 0)\)
3. \(F\left(\frac{8}{3}, 2\right)\)
4. \(B(0, 0)\)
5. \(D(0, 3)\)

Compute the sum of \(x_i y_{i+1}\):

\[
(0 \cdot 0) + (4 \cdot 2) + \left(\frac{8}{3} \cdot 0\right) + (0 \cdot 3) = 0 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 8
\]

Compute the sum of \(y_i x_{i+1}\):

\[
(3 \cdot 4) + (0 \cdot \frac{8}{3}) + (2 \cdot 0) + (0 \cdot 0) = 12 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 12
\]

Subtract the two sums and take the absolute value:

\[
|8 - 12| = 4
\]

Multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
\]

Thus, the area of quadrilateral \(D-E-F-B\) is \(\boxed{2}\).
