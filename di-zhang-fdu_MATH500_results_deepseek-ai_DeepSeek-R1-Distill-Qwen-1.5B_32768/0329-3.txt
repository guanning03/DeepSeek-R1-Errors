Question:
Find the number of integer values of $k$ in the closed interval $[-500,500]$ for which the equation $\log(kx)=2\log(x+2)$ has exactly one real solution.

Correct Answer:
First, note that if $k < 0,$ then $\log(kx)$ is defined for $x \in (-\infty, 0),$ and is strictly decreasing on that interval. Since $2\log(x+2)$ is defined for $x \in (-2, \infty)$ and is strictly increasing on that interval, it follows that $\log(kx) = 2\log(x+2)$ has exactly one real solution, which must lie in the interval $(-2, 0).$ Therefore, all the values $k = -500, -499, \ldots, -2, -1$ satisfy the condition.

If $k = 0,$ then the left-hand side is never defined, so we may assume now that $k > 0.$ In this case, converting to exponential form, we have \[ kx = (x+2)^2\]or \[x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = 0.\]Any solution of this equation satisfies $\log(kx) = 2\log(x+2)$ as well, as long as the two logarithms are defined; since $k > 0,$ the logarithms are defined exactly when $x > 0.$ Therefore, this quadratic must have exactly one positive root.

But by Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of this quadratic is $4,$ which is positive, so the only way for it to have exactly one positive root is if it has $\sqrt{4} = 2$ as a double root. That is, \[x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = (x-2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4\]for all $x,$ so $4-k=-4,$ and $k=8,$ which is the only positive value of $k$ satisfying the condition.

In total, there are $500 + 1 = \boxed{501}$ values of $k$ satisfying the condition.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of integer values of \( k \) in the closed interval \([-500, 500]\) for which the equation \( \log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2) \) has exactly one real solution. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithmic equations can sometimes be tricky because of their domain restrictions. So, I should start by figuring out the domain of this equation. The arguments of the logarithms must be positive. Therefore, for \( \log(kx) \) to be defined, \( kx > 0 \). Similarly, for \( \log(x + 2) \) to be defined, \( x + 2 > 0 \), which means \( x > -2 \).

So, let me note that down:
1. \( kx > 0 \)
2. \( x > -2 \)

From the second inequality, \( x \) must be greater than -2. Now, considering the first inequality, \( kx > 0 \). So, if \( k \) is positive, then \( x \) must also be positive. If \( k \) is negative, then \( x \) must also be negative. But wait, from the second inequality, \( x \) must be greater than -2, which can be negative or positive. So, this gives us some constraints on \( k \) depending on whether \( x \) is positive or negative.

But before that, let me see if I can manipulate the original equation to make it easier to solve. The equation is \( \log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2) \). I know that \( 2\log(x + 2) \) can be rewritten using logarithm properties as \( \log((x + 2)^2) \). So, I can rewrite the equation as:
\[ \log(kx) = \log((x + 2)^2) \]

Since logarithms are one-to-one functions, if \( \log(A) = \log(B) \), then \( A = B \), provided that both \( A \) and \( B \) are positive. So, I can set the arguments equal to each other:
\[ kx = (x + 2)^2 \]

Alright, so now I have a quadratic equation:
\[ (x + 2)^2 = kx \]
Let me expand the left side:
\[ x^2 + 4x + 4 = kx \]
Then, bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \]

So, the equation reduces to \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \). Now, this is a quadratic in \( x \). The number of real solutions depends on the discriminant. The discriminant \( D \) of a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is \( D = b^2 - 4ac \).

Calculating the discriminant for our equation:
\[ D = (4 - k)^2 - 4(1)(4) \]
\[ D = (16 - 8k + k^2) - 16 \]
\[ D = k^2 - 8k \]

So, the discriminant is \( D = k^2 - 8k \). For the quadratic to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero. So, set \( D = 0 \):
\[ k^2 - 8k = 0 \]
Factor out \( k \):
\[ k(k - 8) = 0 \]
Therefore, the solutions are \( k = 0 \) or \( k = 8 \). Hmm, so if \( k = 0 \) or \( k = 8 \), the quadratic equation will have exactly one real solution. But wait, I need to make sure that this solution also satisfies the original logarithmic equation's domain.

So, let me check each value of \( k \) separately.

First, \( k = 0 \):
If \( k = 0 \), the original equation becomes \( \log(0 \cdot x) = 2\log(x + 2) \). But \( \log(0 \cdot x) \) is \( \log(0) \), which is undefined. So, \( k = 0 \) is not allowed because it makes the left side undefined. Therefore, \( k = 0 \) is excluded.

Next, \( k = 8 \):
If \( k = 8 \), the equation becomes \( \log(8x) = 2\log(x + 2) \). Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, rewrite the right side:
\[ 2\log(x + 2) = \log((x + 2)^2) \]
So, the equation becomes:
\[ \log(8x) = \log((x + 2)^2) \]
Since logarithms are equal, their arguments must be equal (as long as they are positive):
\[ 8x = (x + 2)^2 \]
Expand the right side:
\[ 8x = x^2 + 4x + 4 \]
Bring all terms to one side:
\[ x^2 + 4x + 4 - 8x = 0 \]
Simplify:
\[ x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \]
Factor:
\[ (x - 2)^2 = 0 \]
So, the solution is \( x = 2 \).

Now, I need to check if this solution satisfies the domain restrictions of the original logarithmic equation. From \( \log(x + 2) \), we have \( x > -2 \), which is satisfied because \( x = 2 > -2 \). Also, \( \log(kx) = \log(8 \cdot 2) = \log(16) \), which is defined because 16 is positive.

So, \( k = 8 \) gives exactly one real solution, \( x = 2 \). Therefore, \( k = 8 \) is a valid value.

But wait, the question says "exactly one real solution." So, I need to consider not only the case when the quadratic has exactly one real solution, but also when the quadratic might have two solutions, but due to domain restrictions, only one is valid.

So, perhaps I need to analyze the quadratic equation \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \) and see for which values of \( k \) it has either one real solution or two solutions, but only one lies within the domain \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \).

So, let's consider the quadratic equation \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \). Let's denote this quadratic as \( f(x) = x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 \).

I need to find the number of integer \( k \) in \([-500, 500]\) such that the equation \( f(x) = 0 \) has exactly one real solution, but that solution must satisfy \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \). Alternatively, if both solutions are valid, then \( k \) is not included, but if only one solution is valid, then \( k \) is included.

Wait, but actually, the equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2)\) has exactly one real solution if either:
1. The quadratic has one real solution, and that solution satisfies the domain restrictions, or
2. The quadratic has two real solutions, but only one of them satisfies the domain restrictions.

So, I need to find all integer \( k \) in \([-500, 500]\) such that either:
- The quadratic has exactly one real solution, which is valid (i.e., satisfies \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \)), or
- The quadratic has two real solutions, but only one of them satisfies the domain restrictions.

Wait, but the problem says "has exactly one real solution." So, in the context of logarithmic equations, the solution must be valid, meaning \( kx > 0 \) and \( x > -2 \). Therefore, perhaps I need to consider the cases where either the quadratic has one solution (and it's valid) or the quadratic has two solutions, but only one is valid.

Therefore, I need to find all \( k \) such that either:
- The quadratic has exactly one real solution, and that solution is valid, or
- The quadratic has two real solutions, but only one of them is valid.

So, let's approach this step by step.

First, let's find when the quadratic has exactly one real solution. As we saw earlier, that happens when the discriminant is zero, which is \( k = 0 \) or \( k = 8 \). But \( k = 0 \) is invalid because it makes the logarithm undefined, so only \( k = 8 \) is valid.

Next, consider when the quadratic has two real solutions. For that, the discriminant must be positive, so \( D > 0 \). Thus, \( k^2 - 8k > 0 \). Let's solve this inequality:

Factor the discriminant:
\[ k(k - 8) > 0 \]

So, the critical points are \( k = 0 \) and \( k = 8 \). Let's test intervals:

1. \( k < 0 \): Choose \( k = -1 \). Then, \( (-1)(-1 - 8) = (-1)(-9) = 9 > 0 \). So, the inequality holds.
2. \( 0 < k < 8 \): Choose \( k = 4 \). Then, \( 4(4 - 8) = 4(-4) = -16 < 0 \). So, the inequality does not hold.
3. \( k > 8 \): Choose \( k = 9 \). Then, \( 9(9 - 8) = 9(1) = 9 > 0 \). So, the inequality holds.

Therefore, the discriminant is positive when \( k < 0 \) or \( k > 8 \).

So, for \( k < 0 \) or \( k > 8 \), the quadratic has two real solutions. Now, we need to check whether these solutions satisfy the domain restrictions \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \).

But since \( k \) is either negative or positive in these intervals, let's analyze each case separately.

Case 1: \( k > 8 \)

In this case, \( k \) is positive, so \( kx > 0 \) implies \( x > 0 \). So, the domain restriction becomes \( x > 0 \). Therefore, we need the quadratic equation \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \) to have at least one positive solution.

But since the quadratic has two real roots, we can use the properties of quadratic equations to determine the number of positive solutions.

The quadratic equation is \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \). Let's denote the roots as \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). We can apply Vieta's formulas:

- Sum of roots: \( x_1 + x_2 = k - 4 \)
- Product of roots: \( x_1 x_2 = 4 \)

Since the product of the roots is 4, which is positive, both roots have the same sign. So, either both roots are positive or both are negative.

But in this case, \( k > 8 \), so \( k - 4 > 4 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots is \( x_1 + x_2 = k - 4 > 4 \). So, both roots are positive (since their sum is positive and their product is positive). So, for \( k > 8 \), both roots are positive.

But the domain requires \( x > 0 \), so both roots satisfy \( x > 0 \). Therefore, for \( k > 8 \), the quadratic equation has two positive real solutions, both of which satisfy the domain restrictions.

Therefore, for each \( k > 8 \), the original logarithmic equation has exactly two real solutions. Wait, but the problem is asking for the number of integer \( k \) in \([-500, 500]\) for which the equation has exactly one real solution. So, for \( k > 8 \), the equation has two real solutions, so those \( k \) are not valid for our count.

Case 2: \( k < 0 \)

In this case, \( k \) is negative, so \( kx > 0 \) implies \( x < 0 \) (since \( k \) is negative). So, the domain restriction becomes \( x < 0 \). Therefore, we need the quadratic equation \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \) to have at least one solution less than zero.

Again, using Vieta's formulas, since the product of the roots is 4, which is positive, both roots have the same sign. So, if both roots are positive, then none of them are less than zero. If both roots are negative, then both satisfy \( x < 0 \).

So, let's analyze the sum of the roots: \( x_1 + x_2 = k - 4 \). Since \( k < 0 \), \( k - 4 \) is less than -4. So, the sum of the roots is negative.

But earlier, we saw that the product of the roots is positive (4). So, if the sum is negative and the product is positive, both roots must be negative.

Therefore, for \( k < 0 \), both roots are negative, so both satisfy \( x < 0 \). Therefore, for each \( k < 0 \), the quadratic equation has two negative real solutions, both of which satisfy the domain restrictions \( x < 0 \) and \( kx > 0 \). Therefore, for each \( k < 0 \), the original logarithmic equation has exactly two real solutions.

Wait a minute, so for \( k < 0 \), the quadratic has two negative solutions, both valid. So, in this case, the equation has two real solutions, which is more than one. So, those \( k \) are not valid for our count.

Wait, so for \( k > 8 \), we have two solutions, and for \( k < 0 \), we also have two solutions. But only when \( k = 8 \), we have exactly one solution, as we saw earlier.

But wait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me double-check.

In the case of \( k > 8 \), both roots are positive, right? Because the product is positive and the sum is positive. So, both roots positive. Therefore, both satisfy \( x > 0 \), which is acceptable because \( x > -2 \) is automatically satisfied for \( x > 0 \). So, both roots are valid, meaning two solutions.

Similarly, for \( k < 0 \), both roots are negative, so \( x < 0 \) is satisfied, and since \( k > 0 \) isn't the case, \( kx > 0 \) would require \( x < 0 \). So, both roots satisfy the domain restrictions.

But wait, the problem says "exactly one real solution." So, in both cases, for \( k > 8 \) or \( k < 0 \), the equation has two real solutions. So, that's not helpful.

Wait, but when \( k = 0 \), the equation becomes undefined, so \( k = 0 \) is invalid. So, only \( k = 8 \) gives exactly one solution.

But earlier, I thought that for \( k < 0 \), the quadratic has two negative roots, so both solutions are valid, meaning the equation has two real solutions. Similarly, for \( k > 8 \), the quadratic has two positive roots, so both solutions are valid.

Hmm, so maybe the only case where the equation has exactly one real solution is when \( k = 8 \). But that can't be, because the problem says "exactly one real solution," and we need to count all such \( k \).

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, let's go back to the original equation: \( \log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2) \). So, \( 2\log(x + 2) \) is only defined if \( x + 2 > 0 \), which is \( x > -2 \). Also, \( kx > 0 \), so \( x \) and \( k \) must have the same sign.

So, the domain is \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \). So, if \( k \) is positive, then \( x > 0 \); if \( k \) is negative, then \( x < 0 \).

So, in the case when \( k > 0 \), the domain is \( x > 0 \). The quadratic equation is \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \), and we need exactly one real solution in \( x > 0 \).

Similarly, for \( k < 0 \), the domain is \( x < 0 \), and the quadratic equation is again \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \), but we need exactly one real solution in \( x < 0 \).

Wait, this might be a better way to approach it.

So, for each \( k \), the equation \( \log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2) \) will have exactly one real solution only if, in the domain \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \), the quadratic equation has exactly one real solution.

But in the earlier analysis, we saw that the quadratic equation has two real solutions when \( k \neq 0 \) and \( k \neq 8 \). So, perhaps when the quadratic has two real roots, but only one of them lies in the domain \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \), then the equation will have exactly one real solution.

Therefore, the number of integer \( k \) where the equation has exactly one real solution is equal to the number of \( k \) such that the quadratic equation has exactly one real solution in the domain. So, that can happen in two cases:
1. When the quadratic has exactly one real solution and that solution is valid (i.e., lies in the domain).
2. When the quadratic has two real solutions, but only one of them is valid.

So, the total number of such \( k \) is equal to the number of \( k \) where the quadratic has exactly one real solution in the domain plus the number of \( k \) where the quadratic has two real solutions, but only one is in the domain.

But earlier, we saw that the quadratic has two real solutions for \( k < 0 \) or \( k > 8 \).

Wait, but hold on, for \( k > 8 \), the quadratic has two positive roots, both valid. For \( k < 0 \), the quadratic has two negative roots, both valid. So, for both \( k > 8 \) and \( k < 0 \), the quadratic has two valid solutions. So, in these cases, the equation has two real solutions, so they are not counted towards our desired count.

Therefore, perhaps the only case where the equation has exactly one real solution is when \( k = 8 \), which leads to a single valid solution \( x = 2 \). But wait, that can't be, because the problem says "exactly one real solution," so maybe there are other \( k \) where the equation has exactly one solution.

Wait, maybe when one of the roots is exactly at the boundary of the domain, i.e., when \( x = -2 \) or \( x = 0 \). But \( x = -2 \) is not allowed because \( x + 2 > 0 \). So, the boundary is \( x = 0 \), but \( kx > 0 \), so if \( k \) is positive, \( x > 0 \); if \( k \) is negative, \( x < 0 \).

So, perhaps when one root is at \( x = 0 \), but that's not allowed since \( kx > 0 \), so \( x = 0 \) would require \( k = 0 \), which is invalid.

Wait, maybe when one root is exactly at \( x = -2 \). Let me check.

If \( x = -2 \), then plug into the quadratic equation:
\[ (-2)^2 + (4 - k)(-2) + 4 = 0 \]
\[ 4 - 2(4 - k) + 4 = 0 \]
\[ 4 - 8 + 2k + 4 = 0 \]
\[ (4 - 8 + 4) + 2k = 0 \]
\[ 0 + 2k = 0 \]
\[ 2k = 0 \]
\[ k = 0 \]

But \( k = 0 \) leads to an undefined logarithm, so that's invalid.

Therefore, maybe we need to consider when one of the roots is equal to -2 or 0, but that seems not to be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps when one of the roots is equal to 0, but since \( kx > 0 \), if \( k \) is positive, \( x > 0 \), so \( x = 0 \) is not allowed, and if \( k \) is negative, \( x < 0 \), so \( x = 0 \) is not allowed either.

Alternatively, perhaps when one of the roots is exactly at the boundary of the domain, i.e., \( x = 0 \), but as I saw earlier, that's not possible because \( kx > 0 \), so \( x = 0 \) is not allowed.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about when the equation \( \log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2) \) has exactly one solution.

This can happen when the quadratic equation \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \) has exactly one real solution, but that solution must lie within the domain \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \). Alternatively, it can happen when the quadratic has two real solutions, but one of them is exactly at the boundary of the domain, i.e., \( x = 0 \) or \( x = -2 \), but since \( x = -2 \) is not allowed and \( x = 0 \) would require \( k = 0 \), which is invalid, that can't happen.

Alternatively, maybe when one of the roots is exactly at \( x = 0 \), but again, that would require \( k = 0 \), which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps when one of the roots is equal to -2. Let me try that.

Suppose \( x = -2 \). Plug into the quadratic equation:
\[ (-2)^2 + (4 - k)(-2) + 4 = 0 \]
\[ 4 - 2(4 - k) + 4 = 0 \]
\[ 4 - 8 + 2k + 4 = 0 \]
\[ 0 + 2k = 0 \]
\[ k = 0 \]
But \( k = 0 \) is invalid, as it makes the logarithm undefined.

Alternatively, perhaps when one of the roots is equal to -4, but that seems arbitrary.

Wait, maybe I should think of the quadratic equation and consider the cases where \( k > 0 \) and \( k < 0 \) separately.

Case 1: \( k > 0 \)

In this case, \( kx > 0 \) implies \( x > 0 \). So, the domain is \( x > 0 \).

The quadratic equation is \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \). Let's denote this as \( x^2 + Bx + C = 0 \), where \( B = 4 - k \) and \( C = 4 \).

The product of roots is \( C = 4 \), and the sum is \( -B = k - 4 \).

Since \( k > 0 \), \( k - 4 \) can be positive or negative.

Wait, for \( k > 4 \), \( k - 4 > 0 \), so the sum of the roots is positive.

For \( 0 < k < 4 \), \( k - 4 < 0 \), so the sum of the roots is negative.

For \( k = 4 \), the sum of the roots is \( 0 \).

Wait, but what is the product of the roots? It's 4, so both roots have the same sign.

Therefore, for \( k > 4 \), both roots are positive.

For \( 0 < k < 4 \), both roots are negative.

For \( k = 4 \), both roots are zero? Wait, no. If \( k = 4 \), the quadratic equation becomes \( x^2 + 0x + 4 = 0 \), which is \( x^2 + 4 = 0 \). So, the roots are \( x = \pm 2i \), which are complex. So, when \( k = 4 \), there are no real roots.

But the problem is to find integer \( k \) in \([-500, 500]\), so maybe \( k = 4 \) is a possible value, but since it's complex, we can ignore it because we are dealing with real solutions.

So, for \( k > 4 \), both roots are positive, so the equation \( \log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2) \) would have two real solutions in \( x > 0 \). Therefore, for \( k > 4 \), the equation has two real solutions, so those \( k \) are not valid for our count.

For \( 0 < k < 4 \), both roots are negative, so the equation would have two real solutions in \( x < 0 \). So, those \( k \) are not valid either, as they result in two real solutions.

For \( k = 4 \), no real solutions.

For \( k < 0 \), as we saw earlier, the quadratic equation has two real roots, both negative, so the equation would have two real solutions in \( x < 0 \). So, those \( k \) are not valid for our count.

Therefore, in the case when \( k > 0 \), the equation has either zero or two real solutions, except when \( k = 8 \), which gives exactly one solution. Wait, no. Wait, earlier when \( k = 8 \), the quadratic equation had exactly one real solution, \( x = 2 \). So, perhaps even though for \( k > 8 \), the equation has two solutions, one of them is positive, so in that case, we have two real solutions. Wait, but earlier, we saw that for \( k > 8 \), both roots are positive, so both solutions are valid. Therefore, for \( k > 8 \), the equation has two real solutions.

Wait, so for \( k > 8 \), the equation has two real solutions \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \), both positive.

For \( k = 8 \), the equation has exactly one real solution \( x = 2 \).

For \( 0 < k < 8 \), the equation has two real solutions, both negative, but for \( k < 0 \), it has two real solutions, both negative.

Wait, so in all cases, when \( k \neq 8 \), the equation has either two real solutions or no real solutions.

But the problem says "exactly one real solution." So, only when \( k = 8 \) does the equation have exactly one real solution.

Wait, but that seems to conflict with the earlier analysis where for \( k > 8 \) and \( k < 0 \), the equation has two real solutions. So, maybe my initial reasoning was incorrect.

Wait, let me think again.

The problem says: Find the number of integer values of \( k \) in the closed interval \([-500, 500]\) for which the equation has exactly one real solution.

So, in other words, we need to count all integer \( k \) such that the equation \( \log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2) \) has exactly one real solution.

From earlier, when \( k = 8 \), the equation has exactly one real solution \( x = 2 \).

But for \( k = 0 \), the equation is undefined.

For \( k > 8 \), the quadratic has two positive roots, so equation has two real solutions.

For \( k < 0 \), the quadratic has two negative roots, so equation has two real solutions.

Therefore, the only \( k \) for which the equation has exactly one real solution is \( k = 8 \).

But that seems too restrictive because the problem is asking for "exactly one real solution," which suggests that there could be more.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the discriminant.

Let me go back to the quadratic equation: \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \).

We have discriminant \( D = k^2 - 8k \).

We know that when \( D = 0 \), \( k = 0 \) or \( k = 8 \), giving one real solution. But since \( k = 0 \) is invalid, only \( k = 8 \) is valid.

But when \( D > 0 \), which is \( k < 0 \) or \( k > 8 \), the quadratic has two real roots. But in these cases, the equation \( \log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2) \) will have two real solutions in the domain \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \).

Wait, but if the quadratic has two real roots, but only one of them is valid, then the equation would have exactly one real solution.

So, perhaps we need to consider the cases where the quadratic has two real roots, but only one is in the domain. So, for \( k > 0 \), \( x > 0 \); for \( k < 0 \), \( x < 0 \).

Therefore, for \( k > 0 \), the domain is \( x > 0 \). The quadratic equation is \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \).

For this quadratic to have exactly one real solution in the domain \( x > 0 \), we need to have either:
- One root positive and one root negative, but since the product of roots is 4 (positive), both roots have the same sign. So, both positive or both negative.

Therefore, for \( k > 0 \), the quadratic has two real roots, both positive or both negative.

Wait, but the product is positive and the sum is \( k - 4 \). So, if \( k > 4 \), the sum is positive, so both roots positive.

If \( k < 4 \), the sum is negative, so both roots negative.

If \( k = 4 \), the sum is zero, so roots are \( \pm 2 \).

But since \( k > 0 \), for \( k > 4 \), both roots positive; for \( 0 < k < 4 \), both roots negative.

Similarly, for \( k < 0 \), the quadratic has two real roots, both negative.

Therefore, for \( k > 4 \), the quadratic has two positive roots, so equation has two real solutions.

For \( 0 < k < 4 \), the quadratic has two negative roots, so equation has two real solutions.

For \( k = 4 \), quadratic has a double root at 0 and -0, which is x = 0 and x = -0, but both are invalid because \( kx > 0 \) requires \( x > 0 \) or \( x < 0 \), but \( k = 4 \) is positive, so \( x > 0 \), but \( x = 0 \) is invalid. So, no real solutions.

For \( k < 0 \), quadratic has two negative roots, so equation has two real solutions.

Therefore, in all cases, the equation has either two real solutions or no real solutions. The only case when the equation has exactly one real solution is when \( k = 8 \), which gives exactly one real solution in the domain.

But wait, that seems contradictory to my earlier thought. Because when I considered \( k > 8 \), the quadratic has two positive roots, so equation has two real solutions. Similarly, when \( k < 0 \), quadratic has two negative roots, two real solutions.

Therefore, the only value where the equation has exactly one real solution is \( k = 8 \).

But that seems too restrictive. Let me verify with specific values.

Take \( k = 8 \):
Equation: \( \log(8x) = 2\log(x + 2) \).
Simplify: \( \log(8x) = \log((x + 2)^2) \).
So, \( 8x = (x + 2)^2 \).
Which gives \( x^2 + 4x + 4 = 8x \).
So, \( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \).
Solutions: \( x = 2 \) (double root). So, only one real solution.

Now, take \( k = 9 \):
Equation: \( \log(9x) = 2\log(x + 2) \).
Simplify: \( 9x = (x + 2)^2 \).
Which gives \( x^2 + 4x + 4 = 9x \).
Thus, \( x^2 - 5x + 4 = 0 \).
Solutions: \( x = [5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 16}]/2 = [5 \pm 3]/2 \).
Thus, \( x = 4 \) or \( x = 1 \). Both are valid since \( k = 9 > 0 \), so \( x > 0 \). So, two real solutions.

Similarly, take \( k = -1 \):
Equation: \( \log(-x) = 2\log(x + 2) \).
Simplify: \( -x = (x + 2)^2 \).
Which gives \( x^2 + 4x + 4 = -x \).
Thus, \( x^2 + 5x + 4 = 0 \).
Solutions: \( x = [-5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 16}]/2 = [-5 \pm 3]/2 \).
Thus, \( x = -1 \) or \( x = -4 \). Both are negative, so \( k = -1 < 0 \), which requires \( x < 0 \). So, both solutions are valid. So, two real solutions.

Therefore, indeed, for \( k = 8 \), the equation has exactly one real solution, for \( k > 8 \) and \( k < 0 \), it has two real solutions, and for \( k = 0 \), it's undefined.

Therefore, the only value of \( k \) in \([-500, 500]\) for which the equation has exactly one real solution is \( k = 8 \).

But wait, hold on, that seems too easy. The problem is asking for the number of integer \( k \) in that interval where the equation has exactly one real solution.

But perhaps, when \( k = 8 \), the equation has exactly one real solution, but perhaps another value of \( k \) also leads to exactly one real solution.

Wait, let me think. Perhaps when one of the roots is at the boundary of the domain, but as I saw earlier, the boundary is \( x = 0 \) for \( k > 0 \) and \( x = 0 \) is not allowed since \( kx > 0 \), and for \( k < 0 \), \( x < 0 \), but \( x = 0 \) is not allowed because \( kx > 0 \), so that can't happen either.

Alternatively, perhaps when one of the roots is equal to -2 or 0, but as we saw, that leads to \( k = 0 \) or \( k = \) undefined, so that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps when one of the roots is equal to -2, but that would require \( x = -2 \), but then \( kx = -2k \), which must be positive since \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \). So, \( -2k > 0 \) implies \( k < 0 \). So, if \( k < 0 \), \( x = -2 \) is not in the domain because \( x > -2 \), so it's excluded.

Similarly, if \( x = 0 \), then \( kx = 0 \), which is not positive, so it's invalid.

Therefore, the boundary points \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 0 \) are not in the domain.

Wait, perhaps when one of the roots is exactly at \( x = 0 \), but that's invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps when one of the roots is a multiple root, but we saw that only \( k = 0 \) and \( k = 8 \) are possible, but \( k = 0 \) is invalid.

Wait, so perhaps the only value where the equation has exactly one real solution is \( k = 8 \). Therefore, the number of such integers \( k \) is 1.

But that seems too small. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps when \( k = 8 \), the equation has exactly one real solution, but maybe also when \( k = something \), the equation has one real solution.

Wait, perhaps when one of the roots is exactly at \( x = 0 \), but that's invalid, or at \( x = -2 \), which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps for \( k = 8 \), in addition to the solution \( x = 2 \), another solution is at \( x = 0 \), but that's invalid. So, only one valid solution.

Wait, but earlier, when \( k = 8 \), the quadratic equation \( x^2 + (4 - 8)x + 4 = x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \) factors as \( (x - 2)^2 = 0 \), so only one solution at \( x = 2 \).

So, that's the case.

Wait, but perhaps when the quadratic equation has exactly one real solution in the domain, which is \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \).

So, perhaps in some other cases, one of the solutions is on the boundary, but as we saw, \( x = 0 \) is invalid, and \( x = -2 \) is not in the domain for \( k > 0 \) or \( k < 0 \).

Therefore, perhaps the only value where the equation has exactly one real solution is \( k = 8 \). So, the number of such integers \( k \) is 1.

But let me check another value. Let's take \( k = 9 \), as before, and see if the equation has two real solutions.

Equation: \( \log(9x) = 2\log(x + 2) \)
Which simplifies to \( 9x = (x + 2)^2 \)
So, \( x^2 + 4x + 4 = 9x \)
Thus, \( x^2 - 5x + 4 = 0 \)
Solutions: \( x = [5 ± sqrt(25 - 16)]/2 = [5 ± 3]/2 \)
So, \( x = 4 \) and \( x = 1 \), both positive, so two real solutions.

Similarly, for \( k = -1 \):
Equation: \( \log(-x) = 2\log(x + 2) \)
Which simplifies to \( -x = (x + 2)^2 \)
Thus, \( x^2 + 4x + 4 = -x \)
Which is \( x^2 + 5x + 4 = 0 \)
Solutions: \( x = [-5 ± sqrt(25 - 16)]/2 = [-5 ± 3]/2 \)
So, \( x = -1 \) and \( x = -4 \), both negative, so two real solutions.

Wait, so for \( k = 8 \), it's exactly one solution, and for all other \( k \) in the interval, the equation has two real solutions.

Therefore, the number of integer \( k \) in \([-500, 500]\) such that the equation has exactly one real solution is 1.

But hold on, I just realized something. When \( k = 8 \), the equation has exactly one real solution at \( x = 2 \). Is there another \( k \) where the equation has exactly one solution?

Wait, let me think about the function \( f(k) = \log(kx) - 2\log(x + 2) \) and analyze its behavior as \( k \) varies.

But perhaps it's overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe when one of the roots is at \( x = 0 \), but \( x = 0 \) is not allowed.

Wait, perhaps when the quadratic equation has a double root, but only one is valid.

Wait, when \( k = 8 \), it's a double root at \( x = 2 \), which is valid. But for other \( k \), like \( k = 9 \), it's two distinct roots, both valid, so two real solutions.

Similarly, for \( k = 0 \), undefined.

Therefore, I think the only \( k \) where the equation has exactly one real solution is \( k = 8 \), so the number of such integers is 1.

But that seems contradictory to the problem statement, which is asking for "the number of integer values of \( k \)". Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps when the equation \( \log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2) \) has exactly one real solution, it could occur when the quadratic equation has one solution that is at the boundary of the domain, but as we saw, \( x = 0 \) is not allowed for \( k > 0 \) or \( k < 0 \).

Alternatively, perhaps the equation has exactly one real solution when one of the roots is at \( x = -2 \), but \( x = -2 \) is invalid because \( kx > 0 \) would require \( x > 0 \) or \( x < 0 \) depending on \( k \), but \( x = -2 \) is not allowed.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps when the quadratic equation has one root at \( x = 0 \), but that's invalid, so no.

Alternatively, maybe when one of the roots is equal to -2, but as I saw earlier, that leads to \( k = 0 \), which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps when one of the roots is exactly at \( x = 0 \), but that's invalid, so no.

Wait, perhaps when one of the roots is equal to -2, but that's invalid as it leads to \( k = 0 \).

Therefore, I think my conclusion is that the only \( k \) where the equation has exactly one real solution is \( k = 8 \).

Therefore, the number of integer values is 1.

But wait, that seems too small. Let me check again.

Wait, when \( k = 8 \), the equation has exactly one real solution.

Wait, but when \( k = 8 \), the quadratic equation is \( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \), which is \( (x - 2)^2 = 0 \), so only one solution \( x = 2 \).

But for other \( k \), the quadratic equation has two solutions, both valid, so two real solutions.

Therefore, indeed, only \( k = 8 \) gives exactly one real solution.

But wait, let's think about \( k = 0 \). The equation becomes \( \log(0) \), which is undefined, so \( k = 0 \) is invalid.

Wait, but for \( k = 8 \), it's defined, so that's valid.

Wait, perhaps if I choose \( k = 8 \), the equation has exactly one real solution.

But is it possible that for other \( k \), the quadratic equation has one root at a boundary point?

Wait, perhaps for \( k = 8 \), the equation has exactly one solution, but for other \( k \), it might have one solution in the domain and one outside, but in that case, the equation would have exactly one real solution in the domain.

Wait, but if \( k \) is such that one root is in the domain and the other is outside, then the equation would have exactly one real solution.

But in the case of \( k = 8 \), both roots are equal to 2, so both are in the domain, but as they are the same, it's counted as one solution.

Wait, no, wait, if the quadratic has two equal roots, both in the domain, it's a single solution, so that's acceptable.

Wait, so in that case, perhaps when the quadratic equation has two equal roots, both in the domain, it's still considered as one solution.

Therefore, only when the quadratic equation has a double root at a point where \( kx > 0 \), and that is the only root, so it's considered as one solution.

But in our case, for \( k = 8 \), the quadratic equation is a perfect square, so it has a double root at \( x = 2 \), which is valid because \( k = 8 > 0 \) and \( x = 2 > 0 \). So, that's one real solution.

Similarly, if \( k = -8 \), then the quadratic equation is \( x^2 + (4 - (-8))x + 4 = x^2 + 12x + 4 = 0 \). The discriminant is \( 144 - 16 = 128 \), which is positive, so two real roots.

But for \( k = -8 \), the domain is \( x < 0 \). Let's find the roots:
\( x = [-12 ± sqrt(128)]/2 = [-12 ± 8*sqrt(2)]/2 = -6 ± 4*sqrt(2) \).

So, \( x_1 = -6 + 4*sqrt(2) \approx -6 + 5.656 = -0.344 \), and \( x_2 = -6 - 4*sqrt(2) \approx -6 - 5.656 = -11.656 \).

So, both roots are negative, so within the domain \( x < 0 \), both are valid. So, for \( k = -8 \), the equation has two real solutions.

Therefore, for \( k = -8 \), two real solutions.

Therefore, it seems that only \( k = 8 \) gives exactly one real solution.

Therefore, the number of integer \( k \) in \([-500, 500]\) is 1.

But wait, that seems too small, since \( k \) can range from -500 to 500, which is 1001 integers, but only one of them satisfies the condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the equation \( \log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2) \). Let me rewrite it as \( \log(kx) = \log((x + 2)^2) \).

Therefore, \( kx = (x + 2)^2 \) or \( kx = 0 \), but \( kx = 0 \) is only possible if \( k = 0 \), which is invalid.

Therefore, \( kx = (x + 2)^2 \), which simplifies to \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \).

So, for each integer \( k \) in [-500, 500], we have a quadratic equation. For each equation, we can find the number of real solutions in the domain \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \).

We need to find the number of \( k \) where the equation has exactly one real solution in that domain.

So, to have exactly one real solution, as we saw, the quadratic must have exactly one real root in the domain, which can happen in two cases:
1. When the quadratic has exactly one real root (i.e., discriminant zero) and that root lies in the domain.
2. When the quadratic has two real roots, but only one of them lies in the domain.

So, let's handle these two cases.

Case 1: Discriminant is zero, i.e., \( k = 0 \) or \( k = 8 \). But \( k = 0 \) is invalid, so only \( k = 8 \).

Case 2: Discriminant is positive, i.e., \( k < 0 \) or \( k > 8 \). Then, the quadratic has two real roots. We need to check if one of them lies in the domain and the other does not.

Therefore, the equation has exactly one real solution in the domain when one root is in the domain and the other is not.

So, let's analyze this.

The quadratic equation is \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \).

We need to find the number of integer \( k \) in [-500, 500] such that exactly one root is in the domain \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \).

Given that the quadratic has two real roots when \( k < 0 \) or \( k > 8 \), let's analyze each case.

Subcase 1: \( k > 8 \). The quadratic has two positive roots because both roots are positive when \( k > 4 \). So, both roots are in \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \). Therefore, two real solutions.

Subcase 2: \( k < 0 \). The quadratic has two negative roots because the product is positive and the sum is negative. Therefore, both roots are in \( x < -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \) (since \( k < 0 \) and \( x < 0 \) implies \( kx > 0 \)). So, two real solutions.

Wait, so for all \( k > 8 \) and \( k < 0 \), the quadratic has two real solutions, both in the domain, which would mean two real solutions, not one.

Therefore, the only way for the quadratic to have exactly one real solution in the domain is when \( k = 8 \).

Wait, but earlier, I thought that when \( k = 8 \), the equation has exactly one real solution. So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but wait, when \( k = 8 \), the quadratic is a perfect square with a double root at \( x = 2 \), which is a single solution.

But for other \( k \), the quadratic has two distinct real roots, both positive when \( k > 8 \) and both negative when \( k < 0 \), but in those cases, the equation has two real solutions.

Therefore, the only \( k \) where the equation has exactly one real solution is \( k = 8 \).

Hence, the number of integer values is 1.

But to make sure, let's check if \( k = 8 \) is the only one.

Wait, perhaps for \( k = 8 \), the quadratic equation has a double root, so it's one solution, and for other \( k \), either two distinct solutions or none.

Therefore, the answer is 1.

But wait, the problem says "exactly one real solution," and in the case of \( k = 8 \), it's exactly one real solution, but for all other \( k \), it's either two real solutions or no real solutions.

Therefore, the number of integer \( k \) is 1.

However, I feel that this seems too restrictive. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps when one of the roots is at \( x = 0 \), but as we saw, \( x = 0 \) is invalid for \( k > 0 \) or \( k < 0 \). Therefore, the boundary points are not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps when one of the roots is at the boundary of the domain. For example, when \( x = -2 \), but as that's invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps when one of the roots is at \( x = -2 \), but that leads to \( k = 0 \), which is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps when the quadratic equation has a root at \( x = 0 \), but that's invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps when the quadratic equation has one root at \( x = -2 \), but that leads to \( k = 0 \), invalid.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps when the quadratic equation has one root at \( x = -2 \), but that is invalid, so no.

Therefore, I think the only case when the equation has exactly one real solution is when \( k = 8 \). So, the number of integer \( k \) is 1.

But, wait, perhaps I should test another \( k \) value. Let's take \( k = 9 \).

As before, the quadratic equation is \( x^2 - 5x + 4 = 0 \), which factors to \( (x - 1)(x - 4) = 0 \). So, solutions at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Both are positive, so two real solutions.

Similarly, for \( k = -1 \), as before, the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 5x + 4 = 0 \), solutions at \( x = -1 \) and \( x = -4 \), both negative, two real solutions.

Therefore, indeed, for \( k \neq 8 \), we have either two real solutions or none.

Therefore, the only \( k \) where the equation has exactly one real solution is \( k = 8 \).

Thus, the number of integer \( k \) in [-500, 500] is 1.

Wait, but the problem says "exactly one real solution." So, perhaps that includes cases where one root is on the boundary, but as we saw, the boundaries are not allowed.

Therefore, the answer is 1.

But, wait, actually, in the case of \( k = 8 \), it's exactly one real solution, but for other \( k \), it's either two real solutions or none. So, the number of integer \( k \) is 1.

But, wait, maybe I should think again: in the quadratic equation, when \( k = 0 \), the equation is undefined, so \( k = 0 \) is invalid.

When \( k = 8 \), the equation has exactly one real solution, and for all other \( k \), it's either two real solutions or none.

Therefore, only \( k = 8 \) is valid.

Therefore, the number is 1.

But, hold on, just to ensure, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that only \( k = 8 \) is valid. Maybe for some \( k \), the quadratic equation has exactly one root in the domain.

Wait, suppose that one root is at \( x = -2 \), but as before, that requires \( k = 0 \), which is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps when the quadratic equation has a root at \( x = 0 \), but that's invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps when one root is at \( x = -2 \), but that's invalid.

Therefore, perhaps indeed, only \( k = 8 \) is valid.

Hence, the number of integer \( k \) is 1.

But, wait, I'm now doubting because the problem is asking for "exactly one real solution," and in some cases, especially when the quadratic has a double root, it's considered as one solution. But in this case, \( k = 8 \) gives exactly one solution, so it's valid.

Therefore, the final answer is 1.

But wait, actually, let me think about it once more.

The quadratic equation is \( x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0 \).

For it to have exactly one real solution in the domain \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \), the equation must have exactly one real solution, which can happen in two cases:
1. The quadratic has exactly one real solution (i.e., discriminant zero) and that solution is in the domain.
2. The quadratic has two real solutions, but only one is in the domain.

But as we saw, when the discriminant is positive, both roots are positive or both are negative.

Therefore, only when \( k = 8 \), the equation has a double root at \( x = 2 \), which is in the domain.

For all other \( k \), either the quadratic has two real roots (when \( k < 0 \) or \( k > 8 \)) both in the domain, leading to two real solutions, or no real roots.

Therefore, only \( k = 8 \) gives exactly one real solution.

Thus, the number of integer \( k \) in [-500, 500] is 1.

Therefore, the final answer is \( \boxed{1} \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
</think>

To find the number of integer values of \( k \) in the interval \([-500, 500]\) for which the equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2)\) has exactly one real solution, we start by simplifying the equation.

The given equation is:
\[
\log(kx) = 2\log(x + 2)
\]
Using logarithm properties, we rewrite it as:
\[
\log(kx) = \log((x + 2)^2)
\]
This implies:
\[
kx = (x + 2)^2
\]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we get the quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0
\]
We need to determine when this quadratic equation has exactly one real solution in the domain where \( x > -2 \) and \( kx > 0 \).

1. **Discriminant Analysis**:
   - The discriminant of the quadratic equation is \( \Delta = (4 - k)^2 - 16 \).
   - For the quadratic to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero, leading to \( k = 0 \) or \( k = 8 \). Since \( k = 0 \) is invalid, only \( k = 8 \) is considered.

2. **Root Analysis**:
   - For \( k = 8 \), the quadratic equation becomes \( (x - 2)^2 = 0 \), which has a double root at \( x = 2 \). This is valid since \( kx = 8 \times 2 = 16 > 0 \) and \( x = 2 > -2 \).
   - For other values of \( k \), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots. We need to check if these roots lie within the domain.

3. **Domain Consideration**:
   - For \( k > 8 \) and \( k < 0 \), the quadratic equation has two positive roots (for \( k > 8 \)) or two negative roots (for \( k < 0 \)), both of which are valid. Thus, these cases result in two real solutions.
   - For \( k = 0 \), the equation is undefined.

Thus, the only value of \( k \) for which the equation has exactly one real solution is \( k = 8 \). Therefore, the number of integer values of \( k \) in the interval \([-500, 500]\) is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
