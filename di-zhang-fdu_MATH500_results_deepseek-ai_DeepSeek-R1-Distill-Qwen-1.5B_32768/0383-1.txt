Question:
A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. The sum of a particular set of three consecutive positive integers is a three-digit palindrome. If the sum is less than 220, what is the greatest possible value for the largest of the three integers in the set?

Correct Answer:
The sum of the set $\{n-1, n, n+1\}$ of three consecutive integers is $3n$.  Therefore, we are looking for the largest three-digit palindromic multiple of $3$ less than $220$.  Checking through $212, 202, 191, 181$, and $171$, we find that $171$ is the greatest palindrome which is also a multiple of $3$.  Solving $3n=171$ for $n$ we find $n=57$. The three integers are $56,57,58$, and the greatest is $\boxed{58}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here about palindromes and consecutive integers. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says a palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. So, for example, numbers like 121 or 1331 are palindromes because they're the same when you reverse them. Got that.

Then, the problem mentions that the sum of a particular set of three consecutive positive integers is a three-digit palindrome. Also, it specifies that the sum is less than 220. The question is asking for the greatest possible value for the largest of the three integers in that set.

Alright, so let's break this down. Let me denote the three consecutive integers. If the middle number is, say, 'n', then the three consecutive numbers would be n-1, n, and n+1. That makes sense because they are consecutive, so each is one more than the previous.

So, the sum of these three numbers would be (n-1) + n + (n+1). Let me compute that: (n-1) + n + (n+1) simplifies to 3n. Wait, that's interesting. So the sum of three consecutive integers is just three times the middle number. That's a useful piece of information.

So, the sum is 3n and it's given that this sum is a three-digit palindrome. Also, 3n < 220. So, the largest possible value for n is less than 220 divided by 3, which is approximately 73.333. Since n has to be a positive integer, n can be at most 73. But wait, n is the middle number, and we need to have three consecutive numbers, so n needs to be at least 1, right? So n can be from 1 to 73. But we need to find the maximum possible value for the largest integer, which is n+1. So, if n is as large as possible, n+1 would also be as large as possible.

But hold on, n+1 can't just be 74 because 3*74 is 222, which is more than 220. So, n has to be such that 3n is a three-digit palindrome less than 220. Therefore, n must be less than 74, but we have to make sure that 3n is a palindrome.

So, the next step is to figure out what three-digit palindromes are, and then see which one can be expressed as 3n, where n is a positive integer, and 3n is less than 220. Then, among those palindromes, we need to find which one gives the largest possible n, and then the largest number would be n+1.

What is a three-digit palindrome? It's a number like 101, 111, 121, ..., up to 999. But since 3n must be less than 220, 3n can be at most 219. So, the maximum three-digit palindrome we can consider is 199, because 200 is not a palindrome, and 219 is less than 220.

Wait, but 219 is not a palindrome, right? 219 reversed is 912, which is different. So, 219 is not a palindrome. The largest three-digit palindrome less than 220 is 199? Wait, no, 199 is less than 220, but 199 is a palindrome. But wait, 198 is not a palindrome, nor is 181. Wait, let me list the three-digit palindromes just below 220.

Starting from 101, which is the smallest three-digit palindrome, and going up by 11 each time, since palindromes are symmetric. So, 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, 212, 222, etc. But 222 is more than 220, so we can stop before that.

So, the palindromes we have are:

101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, 212, 222.

But 222 is too big because 3n must be less than 220. So, we can exclude 222. So, our list is up to 212.

Now, we need to find which of these palindromes is divisible by 3 because the sum is 3n, so 3n must be a multiple of 3. All palindromes with an even number of digits are divisible by 11, but three-digit numbers might not necessarily be divisible by 3.

Wait, actually, all palindromic numbers are divisible by 11 if they have an even number of digits, but three-digit numbers can be divisible by 3 regardless of their digit count. Let me check that.

For example, 101: 1+0+1=2, which is not divisible by 3, so 101 is not divisible by 3. 111: 1+1+1=3, which is divisible by 3, so 111 is a multiple of 3. Similarly, 121: 1+2+1=4, not divisible by 3. 131: 1+3+1=5, not. 141: 1+4+1=6, which is divisible by 3. Similarly, 151: 1+5+1=7, not. 161: 1+6+1=8, not. 171: 1+7+1=9, which is divisible by 3. 181: 1+8+1=10, not. 191: 1+9+1=11, not. 202: 2+0+2=4, not. 212: 2+1+2=5, not. 222: 2+2+2=6, which is divisible by 3, but as we saw earlier, 222 is too big.

So, the palindromic numbers that are divisible by 3 in the three-digit range less than 220 are:

111, 141, 171, 201, 211? Wait, no, 201: 2+0+1=3, which is divisible by 3. 211: 2+1+1=4, not. So, 111, 141, 171, 201.

Wait, 201: 201 is a three-digit palindrome and divisible by 3. So, that's another one.

So, the list is: 111, 141, 171, 201.

Wait, but 201 is less than 220, so that's okay. So, these are the candidates.

So, now, let's think about it. We need to find the maximum n such that 3n is a three-digit palindrome less than 220.

So, if 3n is 111, then n is 37, because 111 divided by 3 is 37.

If 3n is 141, then n is 47.

3n is 171, then n is 57.

3n is 201, then n is 67.

So, the largest n is 67, which gives 3n = 201, which is a three-digit palindrome.

Therefore, the largest number in the set is n+1, which is 68.

Wait, so is that the answer? 68.

But let me verify. So, if the three consecutive integers are 66, 67, 68. Their sum is 66+67+68=201, which is a three-digit palindrome.

Yes, 201 reversed is 102, which is not the same, so 201 is a palindrome. 201 is less than 220, so that's good.

But hold on, wait, 201 is a palindrome, but is 201 the largest possible three-digit palindrome less than 220 that is divisible by 3, which gives n=67, which is the largest possible n. So, 67 is the largest n, leading to 68 as the largest integer.

But wait, hold on, is 201 the largest three-digit palindrome less than 220 that is divisible by 3?

Because 222 is too big, but 219 is not a palindrome, 212 is a palindrome, but 212 divided by 3 is approximately 70.666, which is not an integer. So, 212 is not divisible by 3.

Similarly, 202 is not divisible by 3, as we saw earlier, since 2+0+2=4, which isn't divisible by 3. 191: 1+9+1=11, not. 181:1+8+1=10, not. 171 is okay, but 171 is 171, which is less than 201, which is 171.

Wait, 191 is less than 201, but it's not divisible by 3. So, 201 is the next one.

Wait, is 212 a palindrome? Yes, it's 212. 212 divided by 3 is approximately 70.666, which is not an integer, so 212 is not a multiple of 3. So, the next one would be 201.

Wait, 201: 201 ÷ 3 is 67, which is an integer. So, that's good.

Is there any palindrome between 191 and 201 that is divisible by 3? Let's see.

191: Not divisible by 3.

181: Not divisible.

171: 171 ÷ 3 is 57, which is integer, but that's lower.

161: Not.

151: Not.

141: 141 ÷ 3 is 47, integer.

131: Not.

121: Not.

111: 111 ÷ 3 is 37, integer.

101: Not.

So, the palindromic numbers in the 100s that are divisible by 3 are 111, 141, 171, 201.

So, 201 is the largest one under 220.

Therefore, n is 67, which gives the three integers as 66, 67, 68, with a sum of 201.

Hence, the largest integer is 68.

But wait, hold on a second. Let me think again. Maybe I missed a palindrome between 171 and 201 that is divisible by 3.

Wait, 181 is a palindrome but not divisible by 3. 191 is not.

Wait, 111, 141, 171, 201. So, that's the list.

Alternatively, maybe a different approach: Let me think about three consecutive integers. The sum is 3n, which is a palindrome.

We need 3n to be a three-digit palindrome. So, n must satisfy that 3n is between 100 and 220, inclusive.

Wait, but 3n has to be less than 220, so n < 220/3 ≈73.333, so n can be up to 73. But n must be such that 3n is a palindrome.

So, n must be in the range 1 to 73, and 3n must be a three-digit palindrome.

So, n must be such that 3n is a palindrome. So, n must be a number where when multiplied by 3, it becomes a palindrome. So, perhaps, let's think of the palindromes between 100 and 220 and see which ones are divisible by 3.

So, three-digit palindromes between 100 and 220 are: 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, 212.

As we saw earlier, the ones divisible by 3 are 111, 141, 171, 201.

So, 111, 141, 171, 201.

So, the maximum n is 201 ÷ 3 = 67.

Therefore, n is 67, so the three numbers are 66, 67, 68, sum is 201. Therefore, the largest integer is 68.

Therefore, the answer is 68.

But wait, just to make sure, is there any palindrome between 191 and 201? 191 is a palindrome, but not divisible by 3, so n would not be an integer.

212 is a palindrome, but 212 is above 220? Wait, 212 is less than 220, right? 212 is less than 220, so 212 is a candidate. But 212 is not divisible by 3, as 2+1+2=5, which is not divisible by 3.

Wait, 202 is a palindrome, but 202 ÷3 is approximately 67.333, which is not an integer.

Similarly, 191: 191 ÷3 is approximately 63.666, not integer.

So, 201 is the next one, which is 201 ÷3=67.

Therefore, the three numbers are 66, 67, 68, which sum to 201.

Therefore, the answer is 68. So, \boxed{68}.

But wait, hold on, just to make sure, is there a palindrome between 191 and 201? 191, 192, ..., 200, 201.

But 191 is not a palindrome. 192 is not. 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201.

So, the only palindromes in that range are 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202.

So, yes, only 111, 141, 171, 201 are the palindromes between 100 and 220 that are divisible by 3.

Therefore, 201 is the largest, giving n=67, and the largest integer is 68.

So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{68}
</think>

Given a set of three consecutive positive integers, their sum is a three-digit palindrome less than 220. We need to find the greatest possible value for the largest of these three integers.

1. Denote the three consecutive integers as \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \).
2. The sum of these integers is \( (n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n \).
3. The sum \( 3n \) must be a three-digit palindrome and less than 220.
4. The three-digit palindromes less than 220 are: 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, 212.
5. Among these, the palindromes that are divisible by 3 are: 111, 141, 171, 201.
6. Convert these palindromes to the corresponding \( n \) values:
   - \( 3n = 111 \) gives \( n = 37 \)
   - \( 3n = 141 \) gives \( n = 47 \)
   - \( 3n = 171 \) gives \( n = 57 \)
   - \( 3n = 201 \) gives \( n = 67 \)
7. The largest \( n \) is 67, leading to the three consecutive integers 66, 67, and 68.
8. The largest integer in this set is 68.

Thus, the greatest possible value for the largest of the three integers is \(\boxed{68}\).
