Correct Answer:
Since $AB \parallel DE,$ we know that $\angle A = \angle E$ and $\angle B = \angle D.$ That works out nicely, since that means $\triangle ABC \sim EDC.$ If $BD = 4BC,$ that means $CD = BD - BC = 3BC.$ Therefore, the ratio of sides in $ABC$ to $EDC$ is $1:3,$ meaning the ratio of their areas is $1:9.$

Since the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $6\text{ cm}^2,$ that means the area of $\triangle CDE$ is $\boxed{54}\text{ cm}^2.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to find the area of triangle CDE given that the area of triangle ABC is 6 square centimeters. The problem also mentions that segment AB is parallel to segment DE, and that BD is four times BC. Let me try to visualize this first.

From the Asymptote code provided, it seems that the drawing has points A, B, C, D, and E. Point A is at the top, B is on the left, C is at the origin, D is on the right, and E is below point B. AB is parallel to DE, so I can imagine some similar triangles here.

Since AB is parallel to DE, triangles ABC and CDE might be similar. I remember that if two triangles are similar, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. But before I jump into that, let me make sure if this is indeed the case.

First, I should figure out the ratio of similarity between triangles ABC and CDE. For triangles to be similar, their corresponding angles must be equal, and their sides must be in proportion. Since AB is parallel to DE, the corresponding angles at C should be equal. That gives me that the triangles are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) criterion.

So, if I can find the ratio of AB to DE, I can find the ratio of the areas. Wait, but I don't know DE yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, I can think about using the concept of similar triangles and ratios. Let me assign some variables to the lengths.

Let me denote BC as x. Then BD is 4 times BC, so BD = 4x. Therefore, the entire length of AD is AB + BD. But wait, do I know AB? No, I don't have that. But maybe I can express AB in terms of BC.

Wait, AB is parallel to DE, and BD is 4 times BC. Maybe I can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals to find some ratios.

In the Asymptote code, points A, B, C, D, E are plotted with coordinates. A is at (.1,1), B at (-1,0), C at (0,0), D at (3,0), and E at (-.3,-3). So, in the figure, AB is from (-1,0) to (0.1,1), DE is from (-0.3,-3) to (3,0), and BC is from (-1,0) to (0,0). Hmm, maybe I can calculate the lengths based on coordinates to see if I can get the ratio.

But that might be overcomplicating. Maybe I should use coordinate geometry.

Let me observe that the coordinates are given, so maybe I can compute the lengths based on those.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that the figure is to scale. So, relying on coordinates might not be accurate. Instead, I should stick with the given information.

So, let me consider triangle ABC and triangle CDE. Since AB is parallel to DE, triangles ABC and CDE are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' theorem), which states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides proportionally.

Wait, but in this case, AB is parallel to DE. So, triangles ABC and CDE are similar because of the parallel lines.

So, the ratio of similarity would be the ratio of BC to CD. Wait, because if AB is parallel to DE, then the corresponding sides BC and CD are in proportion.

Wait, let me think. Since AB || DE, then the triangles ABC and CDE are similar with AB corresponding to DE, BC corresponding to CD, and AC corresponding to CE? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should draw a diagram or assign variables.

Let me denote BC as x, so BD is 4x, as given. Then, the entire length of BC is x, and BD is 4x. So, the length of AD is AB + BD, but I don't know AB.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the ratio in terms of the segments created by the parallel lines.

Since AB || DE, then the ratio of AB to DE is equal to the ratio of BC to CE. Wait, not sure. Maybe it's BC/CD.

Wait, let me recall the concept here. If two triangles are similar with a ratio of sides k, then the ratio of their areas is k squared.

But to find the ratio of sides, I need to find the scale factor between the two triangles.

Since AB is parallel to DE, the triangles ABC and CDE are similar. Let me denote the ratio of similarity as k, which is the ratio of corresponding sides.

So, AB corresponds to DE, BC corresponds to CD, and AC corresponds to CE.

Wait, but I don't know AB, DE, or CD.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of areas using the given information.

Wait, the area of ABC is 6. Let me denote the area of CDE as y. Then, since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their sides.

But I need another relationship between the sides.

Alternatively, since AB || DE, the ratio of AB to DE is equal to the ratio of BC to CD. Let me denote that ratio as k.

Therefore, k = AB / DE = BC / CD.

Given that BD = 4 BC, so BD = 4 BC.

Since BD is part of BC, wait, no. Wait, BD is a segment on BC? Or is BD a separate segment?

Wait, hold on. In the Asymptote code, points are drawn as A(-.3,-3), B(-1,0), C(0,0), D(3,0), E(-.3,-3). Wait, point E is at (-.3,-3), same as point A. Hmmm, that might be a typo or something. Maybe point E is another point.

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't rely on the coordinates. Let me try to assign variables without coordinates.

Let me denote BC = x. Then, BD = 4x. So, the entire length of BC is x, and BD is 4x, so the length from B to D is 4x. But where is point D? Is D on BC?

Wait, in the Asymptote code, D is at (3,0), which is to the right of C(0,0). So, D is on the same line as B and C, but in the problem, BD = 4 BC, so BD is four times BC.

Wait, so BC is a segment from B to C, so BD is a segment from B to D. If BC is x, then BD = 4x, meaning that D is beyond point C, 4 times the length of BC.

So, in terms of lengths, BC is x, BD is 4x, so CD is BC + BD? Wait, no. Wait, BC is from B to C, which is x. Then BD is from B to D, which is 4x. So, if D is on the line BC, then CD would be BD - BC, which is 4x - x = 3x.

But in the Asymptote code, D is on the other side of C, at (3,0), so D is beyond C, which would make CD = BC + BD? Wait, that contradicts. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps D is on the extension of BC beyond C. So, if BC is x, then BD is 4x, so CD is BC + BD? Wait, that would be CD = x + 4x = 5x. Hmm, but in the Asymptote code, D is at (3,0), which is beyond C(0,0). So, that seems consistent.

Wait, so in the diagram, D is beyond C, so CD is 4x - x = 3x? Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the lengths.

Wait, let me think step by step.

Let me denote BC = x. Then, BD = 4x.

Now, if points B, C, and D are colinear, with C between B and D. So, BD is from B to D, which is 4x, and BC is from B to C, which is x. Therefore, CD would be BD - BC = 4x - x = 3x.

Hence, CD = 3x.

Therefore, in triangle ABC, side BC is x, and in triangle CDE, side CD is 3x. So, the ratio of BC to CD is x : 3x, which simplifies to 1:3.

Therefore, the ratio of similarity between triangles ABC and CDE is 1:3. But wait, is that correct? Because if BC is x and CD is 3x, then the ratio of their corresponding sides is 1:3.

But in similar triangles, the ratio of areas is the square of the ratio of sides. So, if the ratio of sides is 1:3, the ratio of areas would be 1:9.

But wait, but triangle CDE is not similar to triangle ABC. Wait, are they similar?

Wait, AB is parallel to DE, so angles at C are equal. Also, angle at B is common with angle at D, but wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in triangle ABC, angle at B is between AB and BC. In triangle CDE, angle at C is between CD and CE. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the triangles differently. Maybe triangle ABC and triangle CDE are similar, but the correspondence is different.

Wait, if AB is parallel to DE, then the transversal BC would create corresponding angles. So, angle at B in triangle ABC corresponds to angle at D in triangle CDE, and angle at C corresponds to angle at C. So, that would make the triangles similar with the ratio of sides BC/CD = x / 3x = 1/3.

Therefore, the ratio of areas would be (1/3)^2 = 1/9.

Given that the area of ABC is 6, the area of CDE would be 6 * (1/9) = 2/3. Hmm, but that's not correct because the area of CDE is larger than ABC, so 2/3 would be smaller. But looking back at the Asymptote code, point E is below point B, so triangle CDE is on the other side.

Wait, maybe I got the ratio backwards. If the ratio of BC to CD is 1:3, then the ratio of areas would be 1:9, meaning that area of ABC is 6, area of CDE would be 6 * 9 = 54? That seems too large. But maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the triangles differently. Let me see.

Since AB is parallel to DE, the triangles ABC and CDE are similar. The ratio of similarity is BC/CD = x / 3x = 1/3.

Therefore, the area ratio is (1/3)^2 = 1/9. So, area of ABC is 6, then area of CDE would be 6 * 9 = 54? But that seems too big.

But wait, looking at the Asymptote code, point E is at (-0.3,-3), which is below point A at (0.1,1). So, triangle CDE is in a different location.

Wait, maybe I should consider the ratio in terms of the heights.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use coordinate geometry.

Given that Asymptote code gives coordinates:

A(-0.3,-3), B(-1,0), C(0,0), D(3,0), E(-0.3,-3).

Wait, so E is at (-0.3,-3), same as A.

Wait, that might be a typo or maybe the drawing is incorrect.

Wait, so if E is at (-0.3,-3), then DE is from (-0.3,-3) to (3,0). So, the coordinates are:

A(-0.3,-3), B(-1,0), C(0,0), D(3,0), E(-0.3,-3).

So, AB is from (-0.3,-3) to (-1,0), BC is from (-1,0) to (0,0), CD is from (0,0) to (3,0), and DE is from (3,0) to (-0.3,-3), and EA is from (-0.3,-3) to (-0.3,-3). Wait, that seems like point E is the same as A.

Wait, perhaps the coordinates are incorrect. Maybe E is another point. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is not accurate, and I shouldn't rely on it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assign coordinates based on the ratios.

Let me assume that point C is at (0,0), BC is along the x-axis. Let me assign point B as (-1,0), point C as (0,0), and point D as (3,0). Then, since BD = 4 BC, so BD is 4 units if BC is 1 unit. Therefore, D is at (3,0). Then, point A is somewhere above, say (a,b). Then, point E is somewhere below, say (e,f). Since AB is parallel to DE, the slope of AB should equal the slope of DE.

Slope of AB is (0 - b)/( -1 - a) = (-b)/(-1 - a) = b/(1 + a).

Slope of DE is (0 - f)/(3 - e).

So, b/(1 + a) = (0 - f)/(3 - e).

But I don't know the coordinates of A or E. Hmm, this might not be the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors or coordinate geometry to find the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that since AB || DE, the lines AB and DE are parallel, so they must have the same slope.

If I can find the coordinates of A and E, then I can find the ratio.

But maybe it's too involved without specific coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps using the area ratio.

Given that the area of ABC is 6, and AB || DE, with BD = 4 BC.

Wait, maybe the area of CDE can be found by considering the ratio of areas based on the segments.

Wait, if BD = 4 BC, then the ratio of BD to BC is 4:1.

Since AB || DE, triangles ABC and CDE are similar with the ratio of sides BC/CD. Wait, but CD is BD + BC? Wait, no.

Wait, if BD is 4 BC, and BC is a segment, then CD is BC + BD? No, if D is on the extension beyond C, then CD is BC + BD. But if BD is 4 BC, then CD would be 5 BC.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of mass point geometry or something else.

Wait, another approach: the area of triangle ABC is 6. Let me denote the height from A to BC as h. Then, the area is (1/2)*BC*h = 6.

Similarly, for triangle CDE, the base is CD and the height from E to CD would determine its area.

But since AB is parallel to DE, the heights from A and E to their respective bases BC and CD are proportional.

Wait, since AB || DE, the heights from A and E to BC and CD are in the same ratio as AB to DE.

But I don't know the lengths of AB or DE.

Wait, but maybe the ratio of the areas is equal to the square of the ratio of the heights.

Wait, but since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.

So, if AB is parallel to DE, the ratio of AB to DE is equal to the ratio of BC to CD.

Wait, let me define AB = x, DE = y, so x/y = BC/CD.

But I don't know BC and CD.

Wait, given BD = 4 BC. So, if BC is m, then BD is 4m, as given.

So, BC = m, BD = 4m.

Therefore, CD is BC + BD? Wait, no, if D is on the extension of BC beyond C, then CD is BC + BD, which is m + 4m = 5m.

Therefore, CD = 5m, BC = m, so the ratio BC/CD is m/5m = 1/5.

Therefore, the ratio of AB to DE is 1/5, so the ratio of their areas is (1/5)^2 = 1/25.

But wait, the area of ABC is 6, so the area of CDE would be 6 * 25 = 150? That seems too big.

Wait, but if the ratio is 1/5, then the area would be scaled by 1/25, which would make the area of CDE smaller, which contradicts the fact that triangles ABC and CDE might be similar.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the ratio is 5:1 instead of 1:5.

Wait, if AB is parallel to DE, then the ratio of AB to DE is equal to the ratio of BC to CD.

Wait, if AB is parallel to DE, then the triangles ABC and CDE are similar, and the ratio of similarity is AB/DE = BC/CD.

Given that BD = 4 BC, so BC/CD = BC/(BC + BD) = BC/(BC + 4 BC) = BC/5 BC = 1/5.

Therefore, AB/DE = 1/5, so the ratio of areas is (1/5)^2 = 1/25.

Therefore, the area of ABC is 6, so the area of CDE would be 6 * 25 = 150. But that seems too large.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the correspondence of the triangles.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is CD/BC = 5/1, so the ratio of similarity is 5/1, making the area ratio 25/1. So, area of CDE is 6 * 25 = 150.

But again, that seems too large, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, point E is at (-0.3,-3), which is same as point A, so that might not be the case. Maybe the drawing is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since AB is parallel to DE, the line AB is a scaled-down version of DE.

So, the ratio of similarity is k = AB/DE = BC/CD.

Given that BD = 4 BC, so BC = x, BD = 4x, CD = BC + BD = 5x.

Therefore, k = AB/DE = x / 5x = 1/5.

Therefore, the area ratio is k^2 = 1/25, so area of ABC is 6, area of CDE is 6 * 25 = 150.

But 150 seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the coordinates given are A(-0.3,-3), B(-1,0), C(0,0), D(3,0), E(-0.3,-3). So, E is at (-0.3,-3), which is same as A. That would make triangle CDE a triangle with points C(0,0), D(3,0), E(-0.3,-3). So, that's a triangle with base CD = 3 units and height from E to CD being the same as from A to BC.

But in that case, the area of ABC is 6, and the area of CDE would be (base * height)/2. BC was 1 unit, height was 3 units (from A(0, -3) to BC on the x-axis). So, area is (1 * 3)/2 = 1.5. But in the problem, area is given as 6, so scaling factor is 6 / 1.5 = 4.

Wait, so triangle CDE in the Asymptote code has area 1.5, but we need it to be 6. So, scaling factor is 4, so area of CDE in the problem would be 1.5 * 4 = 6. That makes sense.

But that's conflicting with my previous calculation. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of the areas.

Since AB || DE, the triangles ABC and CDE are similar with a ratio of 1:5, so the area ratio is 1:25. Therefore, area of ABC is 6, so area of CDE is 6 * 25 = 150.

But in the Asymptote code, the area of ABC is 1.5, and the area of CDE is 6, which is 4 times larger. So, 1.5 * 4 = 6, so the scaling factor is 4.

Wait, so in the Asymptote code, the ratio of areas is 1.5 to 6, which is 1:4. But according to the ratio of BC/CD, which is 1/5, so area ratio is 1/25. But 1.5 to 6 is 1:4, which is different.

Therefore, my previous approach is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the ratio based on the heights.

Since AB || DE, the distance between AB and DE is proportional to the ratio of similarity.

Wait, maybe the ratio is related to the ratio of the heights.

Wait, if AB is parallel to DE, then the heights from A and E to their respective bases BC and CD are in proportion equal to the ratio of AB to DE.

But since AB || DE, the heights from A and E to BC and CD must be proportional.

Wait, but without knowing the actual heights, perhaps it's difficult.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of dividing a line segment into parts and using similar triangles.

Since BD = 4 BC, point D is 4 times as far from B as C is.

Therefore, BC = x, BD = 4x, so CD = BC + BD = 5x.

Therefore, the ratio BC/CD is x/5x = 1/5.

Therefore, the ratio of similarity between triangle ABC and triangle CDE is 1/5.

Therefore, the area ratio is (1/5)^2 = 1/25.

Therefore, area of ABC is 6, area of CDE is 6 * 25 = 150.

But again, that seems too large.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the area of CDE is 6, with E coinciding with A, which is not the case here.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to consider the coordinates again.

Given that A(-0.3,-3), B(-1,0), C(0,0), D(3,0), E(-0.3,-3). So, triangle CDE has points C(0,0), D(3,0), E(-0.3,-3). Then, the area of CDE can be calculated.

Let me compute the area using the shoelace formula.

Coordinates:

C(0,0), D(3,0), E(-0.3,-3), back to C(0,0).

Compute:

Area = (1/2)| (0*0 + 3*(-3) + (-0.3)*0) - (0*3 + 0*(-0.3) + (-3)*0) | = (1/2)| (0 - 9 + 0) - (0 + 0 + 0)| = (1/2)| -9 | = 4.5.

But in the problem, the area is supposed to be 6, so the drawing is scaled.

Therefore, the ratio of the area in the drawing to the actual area is 4.5 / 6 = 0.75.

So, each unit area in the drawing is 1 / 0.75 = 4/3 times the actual area.

Therefore, to find the area of CDE in the problem, we can take the area in the drawing times 4/3.

But wait, the problem is asking for the area of CDE in the problem, given that area of ABC is 6. So, perhaps I should compute the ratio based on the areas.

Wait, maybe a better approach: since triangles ABC and CDE are similar with ratio 1:5, the area ratio is 1:25, so area of CDE is 6 * 25 = 150. But in the drawing, the area is 4.5, which is 1.5 times 3, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the ratio in terms of the heights.

Let me denote h1 as the height from A to BC, and h2 as the height from E to CD.

Since AB || DE, the heights h1 and h2 are proportional to the ratio of similarity.

Therefore, h2/h1 = 1/5, so h2 = h1 / 5.

The area of ABC is (1/2)*BC*h1 = 6, so BC*h1 = 12.

The area of CDE is (1/2)*CD*h2 = (1/2)*5 BC*(h1 /5) = (1/2)*BC*h1 = 6.

Wait, so the area of CDE is 6, same as ABC.

But that contradicts the idea that CDE is a different triangle.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the proportion.

Wait, if AB || DE, then the height from E to CD is proportional to the height from A to BC.

But if the ratio of similarity is 1:5, then the heights should also be in the same ratio.

Therefore, h2 = (1/5) h1.

So, the area of CDE is (1/2)*CD*h2 = (1/2)*(5 BC)*(h1 /5) = (1/2)*BC*h1 = 6.

So, that is the same as ABC's area.

But in the Asymptote code, triangle CDE is larger.

Wait, maybe the ratio is 5:1 instead.

If the ratio is 5:1, then area of CDE is 6*(5)^2 = 150.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is the other way around.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the ratio of the segments.

Wait, if BD = 4 BC, so BC is x, BD is 4x, CD is BC + BD = 5x.

Therefore, BC/CD = x /5x = 1/5.

Thus, the ratio of the sides is 1:5, so the ratio of areas is 1:25.

Therefore, area of ABC is 6, area of CDE is 6*25 = 150.

But in the Asymptote code, area of CDE is 6, which is much smaller.

Wait, perhaps the drawing is scaled down by a factor of 1/2, for example, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that since AB || DE, the ratio of areas is the square of the ratio of the corresponding sides.

Given that BD = 4 BC, so BC/CD = x/(5x) = 1/5.

Therefore, area ratio is 1:25, so area of CDE is 6*25=150.

But since in the Asymptote code, the area of CDE is 6, perhaps the drawing is scaled by a factor of 4, so each linear dimension is multiplied by 4, so the area is multiplied by 16.

Wait, but in that case, the area of ABC would be 6*16=96, which doesn't match the given area.

Wait, maybe the ratio is BC/CD = 1/5, so area ratio is 1:25, so area of CDE is 6*25=150.

Therefore, the answer is 150.

But in the Asymptote code, the area of CDE is 6, which is 4.5 in the drawing, which is 4.5 /6= 0.75, so scaling factor is 4/3.

But I don't know.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the areas in terms of the heights.

Since AB || DE, the heights from A and E to BC and CD are proportional to the ratio of similarity.

Given that, if we let h1 be the height from A to BC, and h2 be the height from E to CD, then h2 = (AB / DE) * h1.

But if AB || DE, then the ratio AB/DE is equal to the ratio BC/CD.

Therefore, h2 = (BC/CD) * h1 = (1/5) h1.

So, the heights are in the ratio 1:5, so the areas are in the ratio 1:5^2=1:25.

Therefore, area of ABC is 6, area of CDE is 6 *25=150.

Thus, the area of CDE is 150.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the area of CDE is 6, which is much smaller, so perhaps the scaling factor is such that 6 corresponds to 1, so CDE is scaled by 6, making ABC scaled by 6, so the area of ABC would be 6*6=36. But that's not the case.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this.

Given that triangles ABC and CDE are similar with a ratio of 1:5, the area ratio is 1:25. Therefore, since ABC is 6, CDE is 6*25=150.

Therefore, the area of triangle CDE is 150.

**Final Answer**
The area of triangle CDE is \boxed{150} square centimeters.
</think>

Given that the area of $\triangle ABC$ is 6 square centimeters, and $\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{DE}$ with $BD = 4BC$, we need to find the area of $\triangle CDE$.

1. **Identify Similar Triangles**:
   - Since $\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{DE}$, triangles $ABC$ and $CDE$ are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem).
   - The ratio of similarity between $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle CDE$ is the ratio of their corresponding sides.

2. **Determine the Ratio of Sides**:
   - Let $BC = x$. Then, $BD = 4x$.
   - The length of $CD$ is $BC + BD = x + 4x = 5x$.
   - The ratio of $BC$ to $CD$ is $\frac{x}{5x} = \frac{1}{5}$.

3. **Calculate the Ratio of Areas**:
   - The ratio of the areas of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.
   - Therefore, the ratio of the areas is $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{25}$.

4. **Find the Area of $\triangle CDE$**:
   - Given the area of $\triangle ABC$ is 6 square centimeters, the area of $\triangle CDE$ is $6 \times 25 = 150$ square centimeters.

Thus, the area of $\triangle CDE$ is \boxed{150} square centimeters.
