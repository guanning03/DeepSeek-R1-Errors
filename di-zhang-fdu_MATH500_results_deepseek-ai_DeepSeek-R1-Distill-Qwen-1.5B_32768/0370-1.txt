Question:
Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 5 such that
\[p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1}\]for $n = 2,$ 3, 4, $\dots,$ 7.  Find $p(8).$

Correct Answer:
Let $q(x) = (x^2 - 1) p(x) - x.$  Then $q(x)$ has degree 7, and $q(n) = 0$ for $n = 2$, 3, 4, $\dots,$ 7, so
\[q(x) = (ax + b)(x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7)\]for some constants $a$ and $b.$

We know that $q(1) = (1^2 - 1)p(1) - 1 = -1.$  Setting $x = 1$ in the equation above, we get
\[q(1) = 720(a + b),\]so $a + b = -\frac{1}{720}.$

We also know that $q(-1) = ((-1)^2 - 1)p(-1) + 1 = 1.$  Setting $x = -1$ in the equation above, we get
\[q(-1) = 20160(-a + b),\]so $-a + b = \frac{1}{20160}.$  Solving for $a$ and $b,$ we find $a = -\frac{29}{40320}$ and $b = -\frac{3}{4480}.$  Hence,
\begin{align*}
q(x) &= \left( -\frac{29}{40320} x - \frac{3}{4480} \right) (x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7) \\
&= -\frac{(29x + 27)(x - 2)(x - 3) \dotsm (x - 7)}{40320}.
\end{align*}In particular,
\[q(8) = -\frac{(29 \cdot 8 + 27)(6)(5) \dotsm (1)}{40320} = -\frac{37}{8},\]so
\[p(8) = \frac{q(8) + 8}{8^2 - 1} = \boxed{\frac{3}{56}}.\]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree 5, and I know that for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), it satisfies the equation \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \). I need to find \( p(8) \). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that if a polynomial of degree \( d \) passes through a set of points, its behavior can be determined by constructing it in a certain way. Since \( p(x) \) is degree 5 and it's given for six points (from \( n=2 \) to \( n=7 \)), it makes sense because a polynomial of degree \( d \) is uniquely determined by \( d+1 \) points. So, that's consistent.

The problem is to find \( p(8) \). Since I don't know the exact form of \( p(x) \), maybe I can construct a related polynomial that will help me find this value. Let me think about the given equation:

\[ p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \]

I can rewrite \( \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) as \( \frac{n}{(n - 1)(n + 1)} \). That might be useful later. Let me also note that \( n^2 - 1 = (n - 1)(n + 1) \), so the function is \( \frac{n}{(n - 1)(n + 1)} \).

Now, since \( p(n) = \frac{n}{(n - 1)(n + 1)} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), I can define a new polynomial \( q(x) \) such that:

\[ q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \]

Let me check why this is helpful. If I substitute \( x = n \) into \( q(x) \), then for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), we get:

\[ q(n) = (n^2 - 1)p(n) - n = (n^2 - 1)\cdot \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} - n = n - n = 0 \]

So, \( q(n) = 0 \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). That means \( q(x) \) has roots at \( x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). Therefore, \( q(x) \) must be a multiple of the polynomial \( (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) \). Let me write that as:

\[ q(x) = k(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) \]

Where \( k \) is some constant coefficient. So, putting it all together, we have:

\[ (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x = k(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) \]

Therefore, \( p(x) \) can be written as:

\[ p(x) = \frac{x + k(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)}{x^2 - 1} \]

Now, since \( p(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 5, the numerator must be a polynomial of degree 7, and when divided by \( x^2 - 1 \), it should result in a degree 5 polynomial. Therefore, the numerator \( x + k(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) \) must be a polynomial of degree 7. So, the term \( x \) is degree 1, and the other term is degree 7, so that makes sense.

To find the value of \( k \), I can use the fact that \( p(x) \) is a polynomial. Therefore, the division should result in an exact polynomial, so the numerator must be divisible by \( x^2 - 1 \). Alternatively, I can plug in a value of \( x \) that isn't one of 2 through 7 and solve for \( k \). Let's see, maybe \( x = 0 \) is a good choice because it's not one of the other points.

So, let's substitute \( x = 0 \) into the equation:

Left-hand side (LHS):

\[ p(0) = \frac{0 + k(0 - 2)(0 - 3)(0 - 4)(0 - 5)(0 - 6)(0 - 7)}{0^2 - 1} \]
\[ = \frac{0 + k(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6)(-7)}{-1} \]
\[ = \frac{k \cdot (-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6)(-7)}{-1} \]

First, compute the product in the numerator:

(-2)(-3) = 6

6*(-4) = -24

-24*(-5) = 120

120*(-6) = -720

-720*(-7) = 5040

So, the numerator is \( k \cdot 5040 \), and the denominator is -1, so:

LHS = \( \frac{5040k}{-1} = -5040k \)

But wait, LHS is also equal to \( p(0) \). Alternatively, let's compute \( p(0) \) using the original definition:

\[ p(0) = \frac{0}{0^2 - 1} = 0 \]

So, from the original equation, \( p(0) = 0 \). Therefore, equating the two expressions:

\[ -5040k = 0 \]
\[ k = 0 \]

Wait, that can't be right because if \( k = 0 \), then \( q(x) = 0 \), which would mean \( p(x) = \frac{x}{x^2 - 1} \), but that's not a polynomial. So, maybe I made a mistake in substituting \( x = 0 \). Let me double-check.

Wait, if \( k = 0 \), then:

Looking back at \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x = 0 \), which would imply \( p(x) = \frac{x}{x^2 - 1} \). But that's not a polynomial because it has a denominator. So, my substitution must have been incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should plug in a different value. Let me try \( x = 1 \). But \( x = 1 \) is not one of the points where \( p(n) \) is defined, so maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I should plug in a value that can make the numerator zero. Let me see, perhaps \( x = 1 \), but again, it's not given. Alternatively, maybe \( x = -1 \). Let me try that.

Substitute \( x = -1 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\[ p(-1) = \frac{-1 + k(-1 - 2)(-1 - 3)(-1 - 4)(-1 - 5)(-1 - 6)(-1 - 7)}{(-1)^2 - 1} \]
\[ = \frac{-1 + k(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6)(-7)(-8)}{1 - 1} \]
But wait, the denominator is 0, so it's undefined. That's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I need a different approach to find \( k \). Perhaps, since \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \) is a polynomial of degree 7, and \( q(x) = k(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)(x - a)(x - b) \). Wait, no, earlier we said that \( q(x) \) is a multiple of \( (x - 2)...(x - 7) \), so it's of degree 6, but \( q(x) \) is degree 7, so in fact, \( q(x) = k(x - 2)(x - 3)...(x - 7) \) times a linear term, right? Wait, no, in the beginning, we had:

\( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \), which is degree 7, and it's equal to \( k(x - 2)...(x - 7) \), which is degree 6. So, that would imply that \( q(x) = k(x - 2)...(x - 7) \) plus something? Wait, no, earlier I thought \( q(x) = k(x - 2)...(x - 7) \), but that can't be because \( q(x) \) would then be degree 6, but it's actually degree 7. So, perhaps I missed a term.

Wait, no, actually, \( (x^2 - 1) \) is degree 2, so when multiplied by \( p(x) \) which is degree 5, it becomes degree 7. Then subtracting \( x \) which is degree 1, so the leading term is degree 7, so \( q(x) \) is indeed degree 7. So, how does that relate to \( q(x) = k(x - 2)...(x - 7) \)?

Wait, actually, \( q(x) \) is equal to \( k(x - 2)...(x - 7) \) times something of degree 1, right? Because \( q(x) \) is degree 7, and \( (x - 2)...(x - 7) \) is degree 6, so \( k \) multiplied by a degree 1 polynomial. So, \( q(x) = k(x - 2)...(x - 7)(x - a) \) for some constant \( a \). But then, I don't know what \( a \) is.

Wait, but since \( q(n) = 0 \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), then \( q(x) \) must have these roots, so \( q(x) = k(x - 2)(x - 3)...(x - 7)(x - a) \).

But then, unless we know another root, we can't find \( k \) and \( a \). Hmm. So, perhaps I need another condition. Since \( p(x) \) is a degree 5 polynomial, \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \) is degree 7. But \( q(x) \) must also satisfy \( q(n) = 0 \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). So, it's divisible by \( (x - 2)...(x - 7) \), which is degree 6. Therefore, \( q(x) \) must be equal to \( k(x - 2)...(x - 7)(x - a) \), but we don't know \( a \).

Wait, but maybe \( a \) is such that \( (x - a) \) cancels out the \( x^2 - 1 \) term? Hmm, not necessarily. Alternatively, perhaps I can choose \( x = 1 \) or \( x = -1 \) to compute \( k \). Let's try that.

Compute \( q(1) \):

From the original definition,

\[ q(1) = (1^2 - 1)p(1) - 1 = 0 \cdot p(1) - 1 = -1 \]

But from the other expression,

\[ q(1) = k(1 - 2)(1 - 3)(1 - 4)(1 - 5)(1 - 6)(1 - 7)(1 - a) \]
\[ = k(-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6)(1 - a) \]
\[ = k(-1)^6 \cdot (1 - a) \cdot (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6) \]
\[ = k(1)(1 - a) \cdot 720 \]
\[ = 720k(1 - a) \]

Set equal to -1:

\[ 720k(1 - a) = -1 \]
\[ k(1 - a) = -1/720 \]

But we have two unknowns \( k \) and \( a \), so that's not helpful yet. Maybe I need another condition.

Alternatively, let's compute \( q(0) \):

From the original definition,

\[ q(0) = (0^2 - 1)p(0) - 0 = (-1)p(0) - 0 = -p(0) \]

But from the other expression,

\[ q(0) = k(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6)(-7)(0 - a) \]
\[ = k(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6)(-7)(-a) \]
\[ = k(-1)^6 \cdot (2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)a \]
\[ = k \cdot 5040a \]

Therefore,

\[ -p(0) = 5040k a \]

But without knowing \( p(0) \), this might not help. Wait, but I can find \( p(0) \) from the original equation:

\[ p(0) = \frac{0}{0^2 - 1} = 0 \]

So,

\[ -0 = 5040k a \]
\[ 0 = 5040k a \]

Which implies either \( k = 0 \) or \( a = 0 \). But if \( k = 0 \), then \( q(x) = 0 \), which implies \( p(x) = \frac{x}{x^2 - 1} \), which isn't a polynomial. Therefore, \( a = 0 \).

So, \( a = 0 \). Therefore, \( q(x) = k(x - 2)(x - 3)...(x - 7)x \).

So, \( q(x) = k(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)x \).

But wait, that's not correct because \( q(x) \) is degree 7, and \( (x - 2)...(x - 7)x \) is degree 7 (since 6 roots plus the x term). So, yes, that works.

Therefore, \( q(x) = k(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)x \).

But then, using the earlier substitution, when I set \( x = 1 \), I had:

\[ 720k(1 - a) = -1 \]

But we found \( a = 0 \), so:

\[ 720k(1 - 0) = -1 \]
\[ 720k = -1 \]
\[ k = -1/720 \]

So, \( k = -1/720 \).

Therefore, \( q(x) = -1/720 \cdot (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)x \).

Now, since \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \), we can write:

\[ (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x = -\frac{1}{720}x(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) \]

Therefore, solving for \( p(x) \):

\[ p(x) = \frac{x + \frac{1}{720}x(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)}{x^2 - 1} \]

Simplify numerator:

Factor out x:

\[ p(x) = \frac{x\left(1 + \frac{1}{720}(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)\right)}{x^2 - 1} \]

But since \( x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1) \), perhaps we can cancel out \( x \) if \( x \neq 1 \) or \( x \neq -1 \). But \( p(x) \) is a polynomial, so the numerator must be divisible by \( x^2 - 1 \). Wait, but in the original definition, \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, \dots, 7 \). So, \( p(x) \) is a polynomial that agrees with \( \frac{x}{x^2 - 1} \) at these points. Therefore, \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \) is zero at \( x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), so \( q(x) \) must be a multiple of \( (x - 2)(x - 3)...(x - 7) \), which we already established, and then multiplied by some constant \( k \).

But we found \( k = -1/720 \), so maybe I can express \( p(x) \) as:

\[ p(x) = \frac{x + \frac{1}{720}x(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)}{x^2 - 1} \]

Now, to compute \( p(8) \), I can plug in \( x = 8 \) into this expression.

First, calculate the numerator:

Numerator = \( x + \frac{1}{720}x(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) \)

At \( x = 8 \):

Numerator = \( 8 + \frac{1}{720} \cdot 8 \cdot (8 - 2)(8 - 3)(8 - 4)(8 - 5)(8 - 6)(8 - 7)(8 - 7) \)

Wait, hold on, that last term is \( (8 - 7) \) again, which is 1? Wait, no, let's list all terms:

At \( x = 8 \), the terms inside the product are:

\( (8 - 2) = 6 \)

\( (8 - 3) = 5 \)

\( (8 - 4) = 4 \)

\( (8 - 5) = 3 \)

\( (8 - 6) = 2 \)

\( (8 - 7) = 1 \)

So, the product is \( 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 1 \). Wait, hold on, we have:

Wait, \( (8 - 2) \) to \( (8 - 7) \) is 6 terms? Wait, no, because \( (x - 2) \) to \( (x - 7) \) is 6 terms: 6,5,4,3,2,1. Then, the last term is \( (x - 7) \) again, another 1. So, actually, it's 6 terms multiplied by 1, so 6 terms. Wait, no, the product is \( (x - 2)(x - 3)...(x - 7) \), which is 6 terms, and then multiplied by \( x \), so when \( x = 8 \), it's 8 times the product of 6 terms.

Wait, wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the numerator is:

\[ x + \frac{1}{720}x(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7) \]

So, when \( x = 8 \):

Numerator = \( 8 + \frac{1}{720} \cdot 8 \cdot (8 - 2)(8 - 3)(8 - 4)(8 - 5)(8 - 6)(8 - 7) \)

So, \( (8 - 2) = 6 \), \( (8 - 3) = 5 \), \( (8 - 4) = 4 \), \( (8 - 5) = 3 \), \( (8 - 6) = 2 \), \( (8 - 7) = 1 \). So, the product is 6×5×4×3×2×1 = 720. Therefore, the second term is \( \frac{1}{720} \cdot 8 \cdot 720 = 8 \).

Therefore, Numerator = \( 8 + 8 = 16 \).

Denominator is \( x^2 - 1 \) at \( x = 8 \): \( 8^2 - 1 = 64 - 1 = 63 \).

Therefore, \( p(8) = \frac{16}{63} \).

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Numerator:

At \( x = 8 \):

First term: 8.

Second term: \( \frac{1}{720} \times 8 \times (6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1) \).

Wait, hold on: 6×5×4×3×2×1 is 720, so \( \frac{1}{720} \times 8 \times 720 = 8 \). So, yes, 8 + 8 = 16.

Denominator: 8^2 - 1 = 63.

So, 16/63.

Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when I set \( q(x) = (x^2 -1)p(x) - x = k(x - 2)...(x - 7)x \), where \( k = -1/720 \).

Therefore, \( (x^2 - 1)p(x) = x + \frac{1}{720}x(x - 2)...(x - 7) \).

So, \( p(x) = \frac{x + \frac{1}{720}x(x - 2)...(x - 7)}{x^2 - 1} \).

So, when I plug in \( x = 8 \), the expression becomes:

\[ p(8) = \frac{8 + \frac{1}{720} \times 8 \times (6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)}{63} \]
\[ = \frac{8 + \frac{1}{720} \times 8 \times 720}{63} \]
\[ = \frac{8 + 8}{63} \]
\[ = \frac{16}{63} \]

So, \( p(8) = \frac{16}{63} \).

But wait, I thought \( p(x) \) is a polynomial, but 16/63 is a constant, which is a degree 0 polynomial. But \( p(x) \) is supposed to be degree 5. So, that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the construction of \( q(x) \). Let me rethink.

We have \( p(x) = \frac{x + \frac{1}{720}x(x - 2)(x - 3)...(x - 7)}{x^2 - 1} \). The numerator is a 7th degree polynomial, same as the denominator, so it's a degree 5 polynomial. So, actually, \( p(x) \) is indeed a degree 5 polynomial.

So, \( p(8) = 16/63 \). Hmm, that's a fraction. Is that correct? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe I can perform polynomial division or find a smarter way.

Alternatively, considering that \( p(x) \) interpolates \( n/(n^2 - 1) \) for \( n = 2, 3, ..., 7 \), and is a degree 5 polynomial, perhaps I can construct \( p(x) \) as a combination of basis polynomials or something.

Alternatively, considering the formula for Lagrange interpolation.

But perhaps since I have this expression for \( p(x) \), maybe I can just compute \( p(8) \) as I did, which gives 16/63.

Wait, but before I conclude, let me verify whether this is correct by plugging in another value, say \( x = 1 \).

At \( x = 1 \):

From the original definition, \( p(1) \) is not given, but from the expression:

\[ p(1) = \frac{1 + \frac{1}{720} \times 1 \times (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6)}{1 - 1} \]

Wait, denominator is zero, so undefined. Which makes sense because \( x = 1 \) is not in the interpolation points.

Alternatively, let me compute \( p(0) \):

From the expression:

\[ p(0) = \frac{0 + \frac{1}{720} \times 0 \times (-2)(-3)...(-7)}{0 - 1} \]
\[ = \frac{0 + 0}{-1} = 0 \]

Which is correct because \( p(0) = 0 \).

Alternatively, let me compute \( p(2) \):

From the expression:

\[ p(2) = \frac{2 + \frac{1}{720} \times 2 \times 0 \times (-1)...(-5)}{4 - 1} = \frac{2}{3} \]

But according to the original definition, \( p(2) = 2/(4 - 1) = 2/3 \), which matches.

Similarly, \( p(3) = \frac{3 + \frac{1}{720} \times 3 \times 1 \times 0 \times (-1)...(-4)}{9 - 1} = \frac{3 + 0}{8} = 3/8 \). But according to the original definition, \( p(3) = 3/(9 - 1) = 3/8 \). Correct.

So, the expression seems consistent for the given points. Therefore, it's likely correct that \( p(8) = 16/63 \).

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{\dfrac{16}{63}} \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{16}{63}}
</think>

Given a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree 5 such that \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), we need to find \( p(8) \).

First, we define a new polynomial \( q(x) \) such that:
\[ q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) - x \]

For \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), we have:
\[ q(n) = (n^2 - 1)p(n) - n = (n^2 - 1) \cdot \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} - n = n - n = 0 \]

Thus, \( q(x) \) has roots at \( x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), meaning:
\[ q(x) = k(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)(x - a) \]

Since \( q(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 7, we consider it as:
\[ q(x) = k(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)x \]

To find the constant \( k \), we use the value at \( x = 0 \):
\[ q(0) = -p(0) = 5040k(1 - a) \]
Since \( p(0) = 0 \), we get:
\[ -0 = 5040k(1 - a) \]
This implies \( a = 0 \), so:
\[ q(x) = k(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)x \]

Using the value at \( x = 1 \):
\[ q(1) = -1 = 720k \]
Thus, \( k = -\frac{1}{720} \).

Therefore, \( q(x) = -\frac{1}{720}(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6)(x - 7)x \).

To find \( p(8) \):
\[ p(8) = \frac{8 + \frac{1}{720} \cdot 8 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{8^2 - 1} = \frac{8 + 8}{63} = \frac{16}{63} \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{\dfrac{16}{63}} \]
