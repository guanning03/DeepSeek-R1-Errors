Question:
Let
\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = p_1(x) p_2(x) \dotsm p_k(x),\]where each non-constant polynomial $p_i(x)$ is monic with integer coefficients, and cannot be factored further over the integers.  Compute $p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \dots + p_k(1).$

Correct Answer:
First, we can factor $x^8 + 3x^4 - 4$ as $(x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4).$  Then
\[x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) = (x^2 + 1)(x - 1)(x + 1),\]and by Sophie Germain,
\[x^4 + 4 = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 - 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2).\]Thus, the full factorization is
\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^2 + 1)(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2).\]Evaluating each factor at $x = 1,$ we get $2 + 0 + 2 + 5 + 1 = \boxed{10}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this polynomial: \( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \), and I need to factor it into monic polynomials with integer coefficients, none of which can be factored further over the integers. Then, for each of these factors, I have to evaluate them at 1 and add all those values together. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that polynomials can sometimes be factored by grouping or by recognizing patterns. The given polynomial is \( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \). I notice that it's a quartic in terms of \( x^4 \), which is a common substitution technique. Maybe I can let \( y = x^4 \) to simplify the expression. So substituting, the polynomial becomes \( y^2 + 3y - 4 \). That looks more manageable.

Now, let me factor \( y^2 + 3y - 4 \). To factor a quadratic, I need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, the factored form is \( (y + 4)(y - 1) \). Substituting back \( y = x^4 \), we get \( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \). Okay, so that's a start.

Now, I have \( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \). But these can be factored further, right? Wait, no, actually, each of these is a quartic and can be factored into quadratics. Let me check each one.

Starting with \( x^4 - 1 \). That's a difference of squares, so it factors as \( (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) \). Wait, but \( x^2 - 1 \) can be factored further into \( (x + 1)(x - 1) \). So actually, \( x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1) \). But wait, hold on, this is a factorization over integers, but \( x^4 - 1 \) is also reducible into quadratics. Maybe there's another way to factor it.

Alternatively, I remember that \( x^4 - 1 \) can be factored as \( (x^2 + \sqrt{2}x + 1)(x^2 - \sqrt{2}x + 1) \), but that uses irrational coefficients, which aren't allowed here. So, I should stick to integer coefficients.

Wait, is \( x^4 - 1 \) further factorable? Yes, as \( (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) \), but \( x^2 - 1 \) can be factored into linear terms. So perhaps I should factor \( x^4 - 1 \) all the way into linear factors, but that's going to give me \( (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \). However, the problem says each polynomial must be monic with integer coefficients and cannot be factored further over the integers. So, linear factors are already irreducible over integers.

But let me check: \( x^4 - 1 \) as \( (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \) is correct. Each of these factors is irreducible over integers because \( x - 1 \) and \( x + 1 \) are linear, and \( x^2 + 1 \) is irreducible. So, \( x^4 -1 \) factors into three irreducible polynomials.

Now, moving on to \( x^4 + 4 \). That's a biquadratic which can be factored using the sum of squares formula, but over integers, it's known as the Sophie Germain identity. The identity is \( x^4 + 4y^4 = (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2) \). In this case, since there's no y, just 4, so set y = 1. So, substituting, \( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \). Let me verify that:

Multiply \( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \):
First terms: \( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \)
Outer: \( x^2 * (-2x) = -2x^3 \)
Inner: \( 2x * x^2 = 2x^3 \)
Last: \( 2x * (-2x) = -4x^2 \)
Wait, no, that seems messy. Maybe better to use the formula directly:

\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) = x^4 - (2x)^2 + 2*(x^2)*(2) + 4 \)
Wait, no, actually, let me do it step by step.

Multiply each term:

\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \)

\( x^2 * (-2x) = -2x^3 \)

\( x^2 * 2 = 2x^2 \)

\( 2x * x^2 = 2x^3 \)

\( 2x * (-2x) = -4x^2 \)

\( 2x * 2 = 4x \)

\( 2 * x^2 = 2x^2 \)

\( 2 * (-2x) = -4x \)

\( 2 * 2 = 4 \)

Now, combine like terms:

x^4

(-2x^3 + 2x^3) = 0

(2x^2 - 4x^2 + 2x^2) = 0x^2

(4x - 4x) = 0

+4

So, overall, \( x^4 + 4 \). Perfect, that works. So, \( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \).

Therefore, going back, the original polynomial factors as:

\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 + 1)(x - 1)(x + 1) \).

So, are all these factors irreducible over the integers? Let's check each one.

First, \( x^2 + 2x + 2 \): discriminant is \( 4 - 8 = -4 \), which is negative, so it's irreducible over reals, hence over integers.

Similarly, \( x^2 - 2x + 2 \): same discriminant, negative, so also irreducible.

\( x^2 + 1 \): also irreducible.

\( x - 1 \) and \( x + 1 \): linear, irreducible.

So, all factors are irreducible over integers. Thus, the complete factorization is:

\( p_1(x) = x^2 + 1 \)

\( p_2(x) = x - 1 \)

\( p_3(x) = x + 1 \)

\( p_4(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \)

\( p_5(x) = x^2 + 2x + 2 \)

So, five factors in total.

Now, the question is to compute \( p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \dots + p_5(1) \).

Let me compute each polynomial evaluated at 1:

1. \( p_1(1) = (1)^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)

2. \( p_2(1) = 1 - 1 = 0 \)

3. \( p_3(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 \)

4. \( p_4(1) = (1)^2 + 1 = 2 \)

5. \( p_5(1) = (1)^2 - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1 \)

Wait, hold on, let me double-check each evaluation:

For \( p_4(x) = x^2 + 1 \), so \( p_4(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

For \( p_5(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \), so \( p_5(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1 \).

So, adding them up:

\( p_1(1) = 2 \)

\( p_2(1) = 0 \)

\( p_3(1) = 2 \)

\( p_4(1) = 2 \)

\( p_5(1) = 1 \)

Adding these together: 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7.

Wait, that's 7. Hmm. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the evaluations.

Compute each:

- \( p_1(x) = x^2 + 1 \): at x=1 is 1 + 1 = 2. Correct.

- \( p_2(x) = x - 1 \): at x=1 is 1 - 1 = 0. Correct.

- \( p_3(x) = x + 1 \): at x=1 is 1 + 1 = 2. Correct.

- \( p_4(x) = x^2 + 1 \): at x=1 is 1 + 1 = 2. Correct.

- \( p_5(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \): at x=1 is 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. Correct.

Yes, that seems right. So, 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7.

Wait, just to double-check, are all these factors indeed irreducible? Let me check whether any of them can be factored further. For example, is \( x^2 + 2x + 2 \) reducible? Its discriminant is \( (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4 \), which is negative, so no real roots, so it's irreducible over integers.

Same with \( x^2 - 2x + 2 \). Discriminant is \( (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4 \). Also negative, so irreducible.

\( x^2 + 1 \) is irreducible as we saw.

\( x - 1 \) and \( x + 1 \) are linear, so they are irreducible.

So, yes, all factors are indeed irreducible. Therefore, the factorization is correct.

Therefore, the sum is 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7.

Wait, but hold on, is 1 the correct evaluation for \( p_5(1) \)? Let me recalculate:

\( p_5(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \). Plugging in 1:

1^2 - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. Yes, correct.

And \( p_4(x) = x^2 + 1 \), so 1^2 + 1 = 2. Correct.

So, yeah, that seems correct. So, 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 is indeed 7.

Therefore, the final answer is 7.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{7}
</think>

To factor the polynomial \( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \) into monic polynomials with integer coefficients that cannot be factored further over the integers, we start by substituting \( y = x^4 \). This transforms the polynomial into \( y^2 + 3y - 4 \), which factors as \( (y + 4)(y - 1) \). Substituting back \( y = x^4 \), we get \( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \).

Next, we factor each quartic polynomial further. The polynomial \( x^4 - 1 \) can be factored into linear terms as \( (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \). The polynomial \( x^4 + 4 \) can be factored using the Sophie Germain identity into \( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \).

Thus, the complete factorization of \( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \) is:
\[ (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 + 1)(x - 1)(x + 1) \]

These factors are:
- \( p_1(x) = x^2 + 1 \)
- \( p_2(x) = x - 1 \)
- \( p_3(x) = x + 1 \)
- \( p_4(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \)
- \( p_5(x) = x^2 + 2x + 2 \)

Evaluating each polynomial at \( x = 1 \):
- \( p_1(1) = 2 \)
- \( p_2(1) = 0 \)
- \( p_3(1) = 2 \)
- \( p_4(1) = 2 \)
- \( p_5(1) = 1 \)

Summing these values:
\[ p_1(1) + p_2(1) + p_3(1) + p_4(1) + p_5(1) = 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]
