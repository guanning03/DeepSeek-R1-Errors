Question:
Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot "mix and match".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.

Correct Answer:
There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.

Gold:
64

Wrong Prediction:
32

Wrong Answer:
To determine the number of different personalities Tom can create, I'll consider each feature he can choose independently.

For eyebrows, since he can choose from 2 sets, there are 2 options.

Ears consist of 1 pair, so only 1 option.

Lips offer 2 sets, resulting in 2 choices.

Shoes are 2 pairs, providing 2 options.

Eyes are 1 pair, so 1 choice.

And hair can be bald or one of the 3 hairstyles, giving 4 options.

To find the total number of combinations, I'll multiply the number of options for each feature:

2 (forehead) × 1 (ears) × 2 (lips) × 2 (shoes) × 1 (eyes) × 4 (hair) = 32.

Therefore, Tom can create 32 distinct personalities for his Mr. Potato Head.

To determine the number of different personalities Tom can create for his Mr. Potato Head, we'll consider each feature he can choose independently. The key is to multiply the number of options for each feature together since each feature is independent of the others.

**Features and Their Options:**

1. **Eyebrows:** 
   - 2 sets of eyebrows.
   - **Options:** 2

2. **Ears:**
   - 1 pair of ears.
   - **Option:** 1

3. **Lips:**
   - 2 sets of lips.
   - **Options:** 2

4. **Shoes:**
   - 2 pairs of shoes.

5. **Eyes:**
   - 1 pair of googly eyes.
   - **Option:** 1

6. **Hair:**
   - 3 hairstyles.
   - bald.
   - **Options:** 4

**Calculating the Total Number of Combinations:**

Multiply the number of options for each feature:

\[
\text{Total Combinations} = \text{Eyebrows} \times \text{Ears} \times \text{Lips} \times \text{Shoes} \times \text{Eyes} \times \text{Hair}
\]

\[
\text{Total Combinations} = 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 1 \times 4 = 32
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{32}
\]
