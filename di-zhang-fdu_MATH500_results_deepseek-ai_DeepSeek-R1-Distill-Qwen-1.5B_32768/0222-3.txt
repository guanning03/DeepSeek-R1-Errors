Question:
Let $f(x)=\left\lfloor\left(-\frac58\right)^x\right\rfloor$ be a function that is defined for all values of $x$ in $[0,\infty)$ such that $f(x)$ is a real number. How many distinct values exist in the range of $f(x)$?

Correct Answer:
Since $-\frac58$ is a negative number, $f(x)$ is only defined for integer values of $x$, and will alternate between positive and negative values. Additionally, $\left|-\frac58\right|< 1$, so $|f(x)|$ will continually decrease and approach 0 as $x$ increases in the interval $x\ge0$. Therefore, the largest positive value will occur at $x=0$, giving us the positive upper bound of $\left\lfloor\left(-\frac58\right)^0\right\rfloor=1$. The negative value that is greatest in magnitude then occurs at the next integer value of $x$: $x=1$, giving us the negative lower bound of $\left\lfloor\left(-\frac58\right)^1\right\rfloor=-1$. This tells us that $-1 \le f(x) \le 1$. Since the $f(x)$ must be an integer, the only possible distinct values contained in the range are -1, 0, and 1. This gives us a total of $\boxed{3}$ values of $f(x)$ when $x\ge0$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this function f(x) = floor((-5/8)^x), and I need to figure out how many distinct values it can take when x is in [0, ∞). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that the floor function, denoted by floor(y), gives the greatest integer less than or equal to y. So, if I can figure out the range of (-5/8)^x for x ≥ 0, then taking the floor of that will give me the values of f(x). 

Let me consider different values of x first. When x = 0, (-5/8)^0 is 1, because any number to the power of 0 is 1. So, floor(1) is 1, so f(0) = 1.

Now, for x > 0. Let's see what happens as x increases. Since the base is negative (-5/8), raising it to different exponents will result in different values. Let's analyze the behavior of (-5/8)^x as x increases from 0 onwards.

I remember that when the base is negative, the result alternates between negative and positive as x increases. For example, if x is an integer, (-5/8)^x will be negative if x is odd and positive if x is even. But here, x is a real number, so it's not just integers. So, what does (-5/8)^x do when x is a real number?

I recall that for negative bases, if the exponent is rational, the result can be real or not, depending on whether the denominator of the exponent's reduced fraction is even or odd.

Wait, but in this case, the base is negative, and the exponent is a real number. So, (-5/8)^x can be written as e^{x * ln(-5/8)}.

But wait, ln(-5/8) is a complex number because the logarithm of a negative number is not real. Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Alternatively, maybe I can express (-5/8)^x as (-1)^x * (5/8)^x. So, that would be e^{x * ln(-1)} * e^{x * ln(5/8)}. But ln(-1) is iπ, so (-1)^x is e^{iπx}.

So, (-5/8)^x = (5/8)^x * e^{iπx}.

So, that's a complex number, since e^{iπx} is on the unit circle in the complex plane. But f(x) is defined such that it's a real number. So, does that mean we're only considering the real part of (-5/8)^x?

Wait, but the problem says f(x) is defined for all x in [0, ∞) such that f(x) is a real number. Hmm, so maybe I'm supposed to take the floor of the real part of (-5/8)^x? Or perhaps the floor of the complex number? But the floor function is usually defined for real numbers, so perhaps we need to take the real part.

Alternatively, maybe I should take the absolute value? Or perhaps consider the modulus.

Wait, let me check the question again. It says f(x) = floor[(-5/8)^x], so it's the floor of that expression. Since (-5/8)^x is a complex number for non-integer x, but f(x) is a real number, so perhaps we're supposed to take the real part of (-5/8)^x and then take the floor of that.

Alternatively, maybe we can express (-5/8)^x as a real number for all x? Let me see.

Wait, let's think about the real and imaginary parts. Let me write (-5/8)^x as (5/8)^x * e^{iπx}. So, e^{iπx} = cos(πx) + i sin(πx). So, the real part is (5/8)^x cos(πx), and the imaginary part is (5/8)^x sin(πx). So, if f(x) is the floor of (-5/8)^x, but that is a complex number, so maybe we're supposed to take the floor of the real part?

Alternatively, perhaps f(x) is defined as the floor of the real value of (-5/8)^x, but I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is expecting us to consider the real part.

Alternatively, perhaps we can represent (-5/8)^x as a real number for all x by considering the absolute value. But that doesn't make sense because (-5/8)^x is real only when x is an integer. For non-integer x, it's complex.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually f(x) = floor[(-5/8)^x] where it's the floor of the real part of (-5/8)^x.

So, for x in [0, ∞), (-5/8)^x is real when x is an integer, but for non-integer x, it's complex. So, perhaps the problem is intended to consider x as integer? But the domain is [0, ∞), so x can be any non-negative real number.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about the function f(x) as floor of (-5/8)^x, but for x in [0, ∞), which includes both integers and non-integers.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a misinterpretation, and the function is floor((-5/8)^x) where x is an integer. But the question says x is in [0, ∞). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the intended interpretation is that x is an integer, so f(x) is floor((-5/8)^x), but then it would be a step function that takes integer values for integers x. Let me assume that.

Alternatively, perhaps x is allowed to be any real number, and f(x) is the floor of (-5/8)^x, considering the real part.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to proceed with both interpretations.

First, assuming x is an integer:

For x = 0: (-5/8)^0 = 1, floor is 1.

For x = 1: (-5/8)^1 = -5/8, floor is -1.

For x = 2: (-5/8)^2 = 25/64 ≈ 0.390625, floor is 0.

For x = 3: (-5/8)^3 = -125/512 ≈ -0.24414, floor is -1.

x=4: (25/64)^2 = 625/4096 ≈ 0.152587890625, floor is 0.

x=5: (-5/8)^5 = -3125/32768 ≈ -0.095367, floor is -1.

x=6: 15625/262144 ≈ 0.059604644775390625, floor is 0.

x=7: -78125/2097152 ≈ -0.03725290298461914, floor is -1.

x=8: 390625/16777216 ≈ 0.023343261748991216, floor is 0.

x=9: -1953125/134217728 ≈ -0.014551915226353085, floor is -1.

x=10: 9765625/1073741824 ≈ 0.009094947017729278, floor is 0.

And so on. So, as x increases beyond 0, f(x) alternates between 1, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, etc. So for integer x ≥ 0, the function f(x) takes values 1, -1, 0, repeating every 3 steps.

So, the distinct values are 1, -1, 0. That's three values.

But wait, is that the case? Let me check:

At x=0: 1.

x=1: -1.

x=2: 0.

x=3: -1.

x=4: 0.

x=5: -1.

And so on. So, yes, it cycles through 1, -1, 0, -1, 0, etc. So for integer x, the function f(x) can take three distinct values.

But if x is a real number, then (-5/8)^x is a complex number. So, what is the floor of a complex number? The floor function is typically defined for real numbers. So perhaps the problem is intended for integer x, but maybe I should consider the real part.

Wait, perhaps the function f(x) is defined as the floor of the real part of (-5/8)^x. Let's explore that.

So, if x is a real number, (-5/8)^x can be expressed as (5/8)^x * e^{iπx}, whose real part is (5/8)^x cos(πx). So, f(x) would be floor[(5/8)^x cos(πx)].

Then, f(x) is the floor of that real part, which is a real number. So, let's analyze this function.

First, note that (5/8)^x is a positive real number, decreasing as x increases. cos(πx) oscillates between -1 and 1, but is periodic with period 2.

So, the real part is (5/8)^x cos(πx). As x increases from 0 to infinity, (5/8)^x decreases from 1 to 0, and cos(πx) oscillates between -1 and 1.

Thus, the real part oscillates between (5/8)^x * 1 and (5/8)^x * (-1). So, the real part is between -(5/8)^x and (5/8)^x.

Since (5/8)^x is positive, the real part oscillates between negative and positive values, but the magnitude decreases as x increases.

So, f(x) = floor[(5/8)^x cos(πx)].

We need to find how many distinct integer values f(x) can take as x varies over [0, ∞). Note that floor(y) is the greatest integer less than or equal to y.

But since the real part is (5/8)^x cos(πx), which is between -(5/8)^x and (5/8)^x, which are both positive and negative as x increases.

But let's see for different ranges of x:

First, for x in [0, 1): since cos(πx) is positive for x in [0, 1/2), and negative for x in (1/2, 1]. So:

For x in [0, 1/2): real part is positive and decreasing from 1 to (5/8)^{1/2} ≈ 0.790569.

Thus, the real part is between 0 and approximately 0.790569. So, floor of that is 0.

For x in [1/2, 1): real part is negative and decreasing from (5/8)^{1/2} ≈ 0.790569 to (5/8)^1 = 5/8 = 0.625.

So, the real part is between -0.790569 and -0.625. So, floor of that is -1.

For x in [1, 2): cos(πx) is negative because x is between 1 and 2, which is  π*(1) to π*(2), so from π to 2π, so cos is negative. Wait, no: x in [1, 2) is equivalent to πx in [π, 2π), so cos(πx) is negative in (π, 3π/2) and positive in (3π/2, 2π). Wait, no: actually, cos is negative in (π/2, 3π/2). So, when x is in [1, 1.5), πx is in [π, 1.5π), which is from π to 1.5π, where cos is negative. When x is in [1.5, 2), πx is in [1.5π, 2π), which is from 1.5π to 2π, where cos is positive.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again: for x in [1, 2), πx is in [π, 2π). So, cos(πx) is positive in [0, π/2) and [3π/2, 2π), and negative in (π/2, 3π/2). So, x in [1, 1.5): πx in [π, 1.5π), which is from π (180 degrees) to 1.5π (270 degrees). So, cos is negative in (π, 3π/2), which is from π to 1.5π. So, in x in [1, 1.5), cos(πx) is negative.

Similarly, x in [1.5, 2): πx in [1.5π, 2π), which is from 270 degrees to 360 degrees, so cos is positive in (3π/2, 2π), which is 1.5π to 2π.

Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me plot it mentally.

At x=1: π*1=π, cos(π)=-1.

x=1.25: π*1.25=1.25π, cos(1.25π)=cos(225 degrees)=-√2/2≈-0.707.

x=1.5: π*1.5=1.5π, cos(1.5π)=0.

x=1.75: π*1.75=1.75π≈5.497 radians≈315 degrees, cos(1.75π)=cos(5.497)=√2/2≈0.707.

x=2: π*2=2π, cos(2π)=1.

So, yes, x in [1, 1.5): cos(πx) is negative.

x in [1.5, 2): cos(πx) is positive.

Therefore, for x in [1, 1.5): real part = (5/8)^x * cos(πx) is negative, with magnitude between (5/8)^1 * 1 = 5/8 ≈0.625 and (5/8)^{1.5} ≈ (5/8)*sqrt(5/8)≈0.625*0.7906≈0.4938.

So, real part is between approximately -0.625 and -0.4938.

Thus, floor of that is -1.

Similarly, for x in [1.5, 2): real part is positive, with magnitude between (5/8)^{1.5}≈0.4938 and (5/8)^2≈0.390625.

So, real part is between approximately 0.4938 and 0.390625.

So, floor of that is 0.

Similarly, for x in [2, 2.5): cos(πx) is negative.

x in [2, 2.5): πx in [2π, 2.5π), which is from 360 degrees to 450 degrees, so cos is negative in (3π/2, 2π), which is 270 degrees to 360 degrees, so x in [2, 2.5) corresponds to cos(πx) negative.

Wait, x=2: π*2=2π, cos(2π)=1.

x=2.25: π*2.25=2.25π≈405 degrees, which is equivalent to 45 degrees in the first quadrant, so cos is positive.

Wait, no, 405 degrees is 45 degrees past 360, so cos(405°)=cos(45°)=√2/2≈0.707.

Wait, no, 2.25π is 225 degrees? Wait, no, π radians is 180 degrees. So, 2.25π is 405 degrees, which is equivalent to 45 degrees, so cos is √2/2≈0.707.

Wait, but 2.25π is actually 225 degrees in the third quadrant? Wait, no: 225 degrees is 180 + 45, which is in the third quadrant where cos is negative. Wait, but 2.25π is 405 degrees, which is the same as 45 degrees, which is in the first quadrant. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think of cos(πx) for x in [2, 2.5):

x=2: π*2=2π, cos(2π)=1.

x=2.25: π*2.25=2.25π=405 degrees=45 degrees, cos(405°)=cos(45°)=√2/2≈0.707.

x=2.5: π*2.5=2.5π=5π/2=270 degrees, cos(5π/2)=0.

So, from x=2 to x=2.5, πx goes from 2π to 2.5π, which is 360 degrees to 450 degrees. So, cos(πx) is positive in (3π/2, 2π), which is 270 degrees to 360 degrees. So, x in [2, 2.5) corresponds to cos(πx) negative in (270 degrees, 360 degrees), but x=2.25 is 225 degrees, which is in the third quadrant, so cos is negative. Wait, but 2.25π is 225 degrees? No, 225 degrees is 5π/4, which is 225 degrees, which is in the third quadrant, where cos is negative.

Wait, hold on, 2π is 360 degrees, 2.25π is 405 degrees, which is 45 degrees beyond 360. So, 405 degrees is equivalent to 45 degrees, which is in the first quadrant, so cos is positive. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, 2.25π is 225 degrees? No, 225 degrees is π*(5/4)= (5/4)*180=225 degrees. Wait, no, π radians is 180 degrees, so 2.25π is 2.25*180=405 degrees. 405 - 360=45 degrees. So, 405 degrees is equivalent to 45 degrees, which is in the first quadrant, so cos is positive.

Wait, so perhaps x in [2, 2.5) corresponds to cos(πx) positive? Wait, no, 2.25π is 405 degrees, which is 45 degrees, so cos is positive. So, perhaps my earlier assumption was wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to plot the function y = cos(πx) for x in [2, 2.5):

At x=2: cos(2π)=1.

At x=2.25: cos(π*2.25)=cos(405 degrees)=cos(45 degrees)=approx 0.9962.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2.25π is 405 degrees, which is 45 degrees beyond 360, so cos(405 degrees)=cos(45 degrees)=√2/2≈0.707.

Wait, no, 405 degrees is 45 degrees, so cos(405°)=cos(45°)=√2/2≈0.707.

Wait, but 2.25π is 405 degrees, which is 45 degrees, so cos is positive.

Wait, perhaps I should stop here and realize that the function y = cos(πx) oscillates between -1 and 1 with period 2.

So, for x in [0,1): cos(πx) positive.

x in [1,2): cos(πx) negative.

x in [2,3): cos(πx) positive.

x in [3,4): cos(πx) negative.

And so on.

Wait, let me verify:

At x=1: cos(π)= -1.

x=1.5: cos(1.5π)=0.

x=2: cos(2π)=1.

x=2.5: cos(2.5π)=cos(5π/2)=0.

x=3: cos(3π)= -1.

Yes, so the pattern is: positive from even integers, negative from odd integers, and zero at half-integers.

So, for x in [n, n+1), where n is an integer, cos(πx) is positive if n is even, negative if n is odd.

Therefore, in general:

For x in [2k, 2k+1), cos(πx) is positive.

For x in [2k+1, 2k+2), cos(πx) is negative.

Therefore, for x in [2k, 2k+1): cos(πx) positive.

For x in [2k+1, 2k+2): cos(πx) negative.

So, for x in [2, 3): cos(πx) is positive.

x in [2, 2.5): cos(πx) positive because x is in [2, 3), so cos(πx) positive.

Wait, but earlier, when x=2.25, which is in [2,3), cos(πx)=cos(2.25π)=cos(π + 1.25π)=cos(π + 1.25π)=cos(2.25π)=cos(π*(2 + 0.25))=cos(π + π/4)= -cos(π/4)= -√2/2≈-0.707.

Wait, so that contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, cos(π + θ) = -cosθ. So, cos(2.25π)=cos(π + 0.25π)= -cos(0.25π)= -√2/2≈-0.707.

So, actually, in [2,3), cos(πx) is negative.

Wait, so going step by step:

x=2: cos(2π)=1.

x=2.25: cos(2.25π)=cos(π + 0.25π)= -cos(0.25π)= -√2/2≈-0.707.

x=2.5: cos(2.5π)=cos(π + 0.5π)= -cos(0.5π)=0.

x=2.75: cos(2.75π)=cos(π + 0.75π)= -cos(0.75π)= -(-√2/2)=√2/2≈0.707.

Wait, so in [2,3), cos(πx) goes from 1 to 0, then to -0.707, then to 0, then to √2/2≈0.707.

So, it's actually:

- From x=2 to x=2.5: cos(πx) negative.

- From x=2.5 to x=3: cos(πx) positive.

Wait, because at x=2.5, cos(πx)=0.

Wait, no, cos(2.5π)=cos(5π/2)=0.

So, actually, at x=2.5, cos(πx)=0.

So, let's correct the intervals:

x in [2, 2.5): cos(πx) negative.

x in [2.5, 3): cos(πx) positive.

Similarly, for x in [3, 4): cos(πx)=cos(3π)= -1; x in [3,4): cos(πx) negative.

x in [4,5): cos(πx) positive.

And so on.

So, in general, for x in [n, n+1), where n is even, cos(πx) is positive.

For x in [n, n+1), where n is odd, cos(πx) is negative.

But n is the integer part of x.

Wait, when n is even, x in [n, n+1) is where cos(πx) is positive.

Wait, let's see:

n=0: x in [0,1): cos(πx) positive.

n=1: x in [1,2): cos(πx) negative.

n=2: x in [2,3): cos(πx) negative.

Wait, no, if n=2, x in [2,3): cos(πx) is positive or negative?

Wait, x in [2,3): cos(πx)=cos(2π + π(x-2))=cos(π(x-2)).

So, for x in [2,3), x-2 is in [0,1), so cos(π(x-2)) is positive.

Therefore, for n even, x in [n, n+1): cos(πx) positive.

For n odd, x in [n, n+1): cos(πx) negative.

So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, for x in [n, n+1), cos(πx) positive if n is even, negative if n is odd.

Now, with that in mind, let's analyze the real part (5/8)^x cos(πx):

We can write this as (5/8)^x * cos(πx).

So, for x in [0,1): cos(πx) positive, decreasing from 1 to 5/8.

So, the real part is positive, decreasing from 1 to 5/8.

Thus, floor of that is 0.

For x in [1,2): cos(πx) negative, decreasing from -5/8 to - (5/8)^2= -25/64≈-0.390625.

So, the real part is negative, decreasing from -5/8≈-0.625 to -0.390625.

Thus, floor of that real part is -1.

For x in [2,3): cos(πx) negative, decreasing from - (5/8)^2≈-0.390625 to - (5/8)^3≈-0.24414.

So, the real part is negative, decreasing from -0.390625 to -0.24414.

Thus, floor is -1.

For x in [3,4): cos(πx) positive, decreasing from (5/8)^3≈0.24414 to (5/8)^4≈0.15258.

So, the real part is positive, decreasing from 0.24414 to 0.15258.

Thus, floor is 0.

For x in [4,5): cos(πx) negative, decreasing from (5/8)^4≈0.15258 to (5/8)^5≈0.11719.

So, real part is negative, decreasing from 0.15258 to 0.11719.

Thus, floor is -1.

And so on.

So, the real parts oscillate between positive and negative values, decreasing in magnitude.

So, for x in [0,1): floor=0.

x in [1,2): floor=-1.

x in [2,3): floor=-1.

x in [3,4): floor=0.

x in [4,5): floor=-1.

x in [5,6): floor=-1.

x in [6,7): floor=0.

x in [7,8): floor=-1.

x in [8,9): floor=-1.

x in [9,10): floor=0.

And so on.

So, in each interval [2k, 2k+1), where k is integer ≥1, the real part is negative, decreasing from (5/8)^{2k} to (5/8)^{2k+1}.

Thus, in each such interval, the real part is between (5/8)^{2k+1} and (5/8)^{2k}, which is between 0 and (5/8)^{2k}≈(0.625)^k.

Thus, the real part is negative and decreasing.

Therefore, floor is -1.

In each interval [2k+1, 2k+2), where k is integer ≥1, the real part is positive, decreasing from (5/8)^{2k+1} to (5/8)^{2k+2}.

Thus, the real part is positive and decreasing.

Thus, floor is 0.

So, for x in [0,1): floor=0.

x in [1,2), [2,3), [4,5), [6,7), etc.: floor=-1.

x in [3,4), [5,6), [7,8), etc.: floor=0.

Thus, the function f(x) takes values 0 and -1, repeating every 2 units, but with intervals.

Wait, actually, looking at the function:

It alternates between 0 and -1 every interval of length 1.

Wait, no, because in each interval of length 1, it's either 0 or -1.

Wait, for example, from x=0 to x=1: floor=0.

x=1 to x=2: floor=-1.

x=2 to x=3: floor=-1.

x=3 to x=4: floor=0.

x=4 to x=5: floor=-1.

x=5 to x=6: floor=-1.

x=6 to x=7: floor=0.

So, it's 0, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1, 0, etc. So, in each interval [2k, 2k+1), floor=0, and in each [2k+1, 2k+2), floor=-1.

Therefore, f(x) can only take two distinct values: 0 and -1.

But wait, is that so?

Wait, no, hold on.

In the intervals [0,1), floor=0.

[1,2), floor=-1.

[2,3), floor=-1.

[3,4), floor=0.

[4,5), floor=-1.

[5,6), floor=-1.

[6,7), floor=0.

So, f(x) alternates between 0 and -1 every interval of length 1.

Therefore, for integer x, f(x) takes values 0, -1, 0, -1, etc.

But for non-integer x, in [0,1), f(x)=0.

In [1,2), f(x)=-1.

In [2,3), f(x)=-1.

In [3,4), f(x)=0.

And so on.

Therefore, in each interval [2k, 2k+1), f(x)=0.

In each interval [2k+1, 2k+2), f(x)=-1.

So, for non-integer x, f(x) alternates between 0 and -1 in each interval [2k, 2k+1) and [2k+1, 2k+2).

But for integer x, f(x) alternates between 0 and -1.

Therefore, in the entire domain [0, ∞), f(x) can take two distinct values: 0 and -1.

But wait, let's check for x=0.5:

x=0.5: (-5/8)^0.5= sqrt(-5/8). Wait, but that is imaginary. Wait, but x=0.5 is not an integer, so I thought f(x) is defined for real x, but when x is not integer, it's complex. So, perhaps for non-integer x, f(x) is complex, so floor is not defined.

Wait, so maybe the function f(x) is only defined for integer x? Or perhaps the problem is intended for integer x.

Wait, the question says "Let f(x) = floor[(-5/8)^x] be a function that is defined for all values of x in [0, ∞) such that f(x) is a real number."

Hmm, so f(x) is a real number. Therefore, for f(x) to be a real number, (-5/8)^x must be real.

But (-5/8)^x is real for x being integer or when x is a rational number with odd denominator. But since x is in [0, ∞), and the base is negative, to have (-5/8)^x real, x must be an integer, because if x is a rational number p/q with even denominator, then (-5/8)^x would involve a root of a negative number, which is complex.

Wait, for example, (-5/8)^(1/2) is imaginary, as we saw earlier. Similarly, (-5/8)^(2/3) is complex because it's the cube root of a negative number, which is negative real, but then raised to 2/3 power, which is taking a square, so it becomes positive. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Let me think about it. (-5/8)^(2/3) is equal to [(-5/8)^(1/3)]^2. The cube root of a negative number is negative, so [(-5/8)^(1/3)] is - (5/8)^(1/3). Then, squaring that gives (5/8)^(2/3). So, real.

Wait, so for any rational exponent with denominator odd, it's real. For denominator even, it's complex. So, if x is rational with even denominator, (-5/8)^x is complex. If x is rational with odd denominator, it's real.

Therefore, to have f(x) real, x must be a non-negative rational number with odd denominator.

But the problem says f(x) is defined for all x in [0, ∞) such that f(x) is a real number. So, that suggests that f(x) is only defined for x in [0, ∞) where (-5/8)^x is real, which is x being a non-negative rational number with odd denominator.

But that's a very restrictive domain, which is not all of [0, ∞), but just a subset.

But the question says "defined for all values of x in [0, ∞)", so perhaps it's intended that f(x) is defined for all x in [0, ∞), and for x in [0, ∞), f(x) is real only when x is an integer.

Wait, but that contradicts because, for example, x=1/2: (-5/8)^(1/2) is imaginary, so f(x) is not defined as a real number.

So, perhaps the problem is intended to consider x as integer, so f(x) is defined for all x in [0, ∞), and f(x) is the floor of (-5/8)^x, which is real.

Therefore, f(x) takes the values as x increases, so for integer x, f(x) alternates between 0 and -1, as we saw earlier. So, f(x) can take two distinct values: 0 and -1.

But let me verify for x=1/2, which we already saw, f(x) is complex, so not a real number, so f(x) is not defined.

Similarly, x=1.5: f(x)=floor[(-5/8)^1.5] is complex, not a real number.

Therefore, the domain of f(x) as per the question is x where f(x) is real, which is x being integer, so f(x) is defined for all x in [0, ∞) and f(x) is a real number.

Therefore, f(x) is real for integer x, and for integer x, f(x) alternates between 0 and -1.

So, f(x) can take two distinct values: 0 and -1.

Therefore, the number of distinct values is 2.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that x in [0,1): f(x)=0.

x in [1,2): f(x)=-1.

x in [2,3): f(x)=-1.

x in [3,4): f(x)=0.

And so on.

Therefore, the distinct values are 0 and -1.

Thus, the function f(x) can take two distinct values: 0 and -1.

Therefore, the answer is 2.

But wait, wait a second, when x=1, (-5/8)^1=-5/8≈-0.625. So, f(1)=floor(-0.625)=-1.

When x=2, (-5/8)^2=25/64≈0.390625, so f(2)=floor(0.390625)=0.

x=3: (-5/8)^3≈-0.24414, so f(3)=floor(-0.24414)=-1.

x=4: (5/8)^4≈0.390625, so f(4)=0.

x=5: (-5/8)^5≈-0.11719, so f(5)=-1.

x=6: (5/8)^6≈0.09313, so f(6)=0.

x=7: (-5/8)^7≈-0.04956, so f(7)=-1.

x=8: (5/8)^8≈0.04329, so f(8)=0.

x=9: (-5/8)^9≈-0.02705, so f(9)=-1.

x=10: (5/8)^10≈0.02148, so f(10)=0.

So, this alternates between 0 and -1 every integer x.

Therefore, f(x) can take two distinct values: 0 and -1.

So, the number of distinct values is 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when x is non-integer, f(x) is complex, so f(x) is not defined as a real number. So, the function f(x) is only defined for integer x, and for integer x, it alternates between 0 and -1.

Therefore, the number of distinct real values of f(x) is 2.

But let me check with x=1/2: (-5/8)^0.5 is sqrt(-5/8), which is imaginary, so f(x) is not defined as a real number. Similarly, x=1/3: (-5/8)^(1/3)= cube root of (-5/8)= - (5/8)^(1/3)≈-0.843. So, (-5/8)^(1/3)≈-0.843, which is real. Then, f(x)=floor(-0.843)=-1.

Wait, but wait, if x=1/3, which is a rational number with odd denominator, (-5/8)^x is real. So, is x=1/3 allowed?

Wait, the problem says f(x) is defined for all x in [0, ∞) such that f(x) is a real number.

So, x=1/3 is allowed because f(x) is real. So, that complicates things.

Wait, so x=1/3: (-5/8)^(1/3)=cube root of (-5/8)= - (5/8)^(1/3)≈-0.843.

So, f(x)=floor(-0.843)=-1.

Similarly, x=2/3: (-5/8)^(2/3)= [(-5/8)^(1/3)]^2≈(-0.843)^2≈0.711, so f(x)=floor(0.711)=0.

x=3/3=1: (-5/8)^1=-5/8≈-0.625, floor=-1.

x=4/3: (-5/8)^(4/3)= [(-5/8)^(1/3)]^4≈(-0.843)^4≈0.511, floor=0.

x=5/3: (-5/8)^(5/3)= [(-5/8)^(1/3)]^5≈(-0.843)^5≈-0.405, floor=-1.

x=2/3: [(-5/8)^(1/3)]^2≈0.711, floor=0.

So, in this case, it's clear that for x being a rational number with denominator dividing 3, such as 1/3, 2/3, etc., f(x) is real.

Therefore, f(x) is defined for x in [0, ∞) where x is a rational number with odd denominator.

But that's a very strict domain.

But the problem statement says "Let f(x) = floor[(-5/8)^x] be a function that is defined for all values of x in [0, ∞) such that f(x) is a real number."

So, perhaps the problem is intending that x is an integer, so that (-5/8)^x is real.

Hence, f(x) is only defined for integer x, and for those x, f(x) alternates between 0 and -1.

Thus, the number of distinct values is 2.

But to confirm, let's check x=1/3: f(x)=floor(-0.843)=-1.

x=2/3: f(x)=floor(0.711)=0.

x=3/3=1: f(x)=floor(-0.625)=-1.

x=4/3: f(x)=floor(0.511)=0.

x=5/3: f(x)=floor(-0.405)=-1.

x=6/3=2: f(x)=floor(0.390625)=0.

So, yes, it alternates between -1 and 0 every x=1,2, etc., when x is integer.

Therefore, f(x) can take two distinct values: 0 and -1.

Hence, the number of distinct values is 2.

Wait, but let me check x=1/2: f(x) is complex, so f(x) is not defined.

x=1/4: (-5/8)^(1/4)=sqrt(sqrt(-5/8)), which is complex.

Thus, f(x) is not defined for non-integer x, only for x with odd denominators.

Thus, for the integer x, f(x) alternates between 0 and -1, so the number of distinct values is 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2.

**Final Answer**
The number of distinct values is \boxed{2}.
</think>

To determine the number of distinct values in the range of the function \( f(x) = \left\lfloor \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \right\rfloor \) for \( x \) in \([0, \infty)\) such that \( f(x) \) is a real number, we analyze the behavior of the function for both integer and non-integer values of \( x \).

1. **For integer \( x \):**
   - When \( x \) is an integer, \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) is either positive or negative depending on whether \( x \) is even or odd.
   - For even integers \( x \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) is positive, and the floor function will yield 0.
   - For odd integers \( x \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) is negative, and the floor function will yield -1.

2. **For non-integer \( x \):**
   - For non-integer \( x \), \( \left( -\frac{5}{8} \right)^x \) is complex because it involves taking a root of a negative number, which results in a complex number.
   - Therefore, \( f(x) \) is not defined as a real number for non-integer \( x \).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The function \( f(x) \) is defined for all integer values of \( x \).
   - For integer \( x \), the function alternates between 0 and -1 depending on whether \( x \) is even or odd.
   - Thus, the distinct values of \( f(x) \) are 0 and -1.

Therefore, the number of distinct values in the range of \( f(x) \) is \(\boxed{2}\).
