Question:
Find all the integer roots of
\[x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0.\]Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas.

Correct Answer:
By the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots are all the divisors of 14 (including negative divisors), which are $-14,$ $-7,$ $-2,$ $-1,$ $1,$ $2,$ $7,$ and $14.$  Checking, we find that the only integer roots are $\boxed{-2,1}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this equation: \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First off, I remember that the Rational Root Theorem could be helpful here. It states that any possible rational root, expressed in its lowest terms as \(\frac{p}{q}\), must have \(p\) as a factor of the constant term and \(q\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term is -14, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots are just the factors of -14. Let me list those out.

The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14. Since the constant term is negative, the possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14. That gives me a starting point for testing.

Alright, let me start plugging these into the equation one by one. It might take a bit, but I think it's doable.

First, let's test x = 1:

\(1^4 + 5*1^3 + 9*1^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14\). Calculating that: 1 + 5 is 6, plus 9 is 15, minus 1 is 14, minus 14 is 0. Oh! So, x = 1 is a root. Nice.

Now, since x = 1 is a root, I can factor (x - 1) out of the polynomial. To do that, I'll perform polynomial division or use synthetic division. Let me try synthetic division because it's quicker.

Setting up synthetic division with root 1:

Coefficients are 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by 1, get 1, add to next coefficient: 5 + 1 = 6.

Multiply 6 by 1, get 6, add to next coefficient: 9 + 6 = 15.

Multiply 15 by 1, get 15, add to next coefficient: -1 + 15 = 14.

Multiply 14 by 1, get 14, add to the constant term: -14 + 14 = 0. Perfect, no remainder.

So, after division, the polynomial becomes \(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\).

Now, I need to factor this cubic polynomial. Let me see if it has any integer roots again.

Using the Rational Root Theorem for the cubic: factors of 14 over 1, so possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.

Testing x = 1 again:

\(1 + 6 + 15 + 14 = 36\), not zero.

x = -1:

\(-1 + 6 - 15 + 14 = (-1 -15) + (6 + 14) = -16 + 20 = 4\), not zero.

x = 2:

\(8 + 24 + 30 + 14 = 76\), way too big.

x = -2:

\(-8 + 24 - 30 + 14 = (-8 -30) + (24 +14) = -38 + 38 = 0. Oh, x = -2 is a root!

Great, so x = -2 is a root. Let's factor out (x + 2) from the cubic.

Using synthetic division again with x = -2.

Coefficients: 1, 6, 15, 14.

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by -2, get -2; add to 6: 4.

Multiply 4 by -2, get -8; add to 15: 7.

Multiply 7 by -2, get -14; add to 14: 0. Perfect.

So, now, the cubic factors into (x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7). Therefore, the original quartic factors as:

\((x - 1)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7)\).

Now, to find all integer roots, we can set each factor equal to zero.

We already have two integer roots: x = 1 and x = -2.

The quadratic factor is \(x^2 + 4x + 7\). Let me check if this has real roots.

Using the discriminant: \(b^2 - 4ac = 16 - 28 = -12\). Since the discriminant is negative, this quadratic doesn't have real roots, so no integer roots here.

Wait, but just to make sure, was there any mistake in my calculations? Let me verify.

Starting with the quartic: \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x -14\). Plugging in x = 1: 1 +5 +9 -1 -14 = 0. Correct.

Plugging in x = -2: 16 + 5*(-8) + 9*(4) - (-2) -14. Wait, hold on, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, x = -2: (-2)^4 + 5*(-2)^3 + 9*(-2)^2 - (-2) -14.

Compute each term:

(-2)^4 = 16.

5*(-2)^3 = 5*(-8) = -40.

9*(-2)^2 = 9*4 = 36.

-(-2) = 2.

-14 remains.

So, adding up: 16 -40 +36 + 2 -14.

16 -40 = -24; -24 +36 = 12; 12 +2 =14; 14 -14=0. Correct.

So, x = -2 is indeed a root.

And when I factored out (x + 2), the remaining quadratic has no integer roots.

Hence, the only integer roots are x = 1 and x = -2.

Wait, but hold on, let me just think if there could be any other integer roots I missed.

I used the Rational Root Theorem, which considered all possible integer roots as ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14. I tested all of them, and only 1 and -2 worked. So, no more integer roots.

Therefore, the integer roots are x = 1 and x = -2.

**Final Answer**
The integer roots are \boxed{-2}, \boxed{1}.
</think>

To find all the integer roots of the equation \(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\), we use the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (-14) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1), giving possible roots: ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.

Testing these values:

1. Testing \(x = 1\):
   \[
   1^4 + 5 \cdot 1^3 + 9 \cdot 1^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0
   \]
   So, \(x = 1\) is a root.

2. Dividing the polynomial by \((x - 1)\) using synthetic division, we get the cubic polynomial:
   \[
   x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14
   \]

3. Testing the possible roots of the cubic polynomial:
   - Testing \(x = -2\):
     \[
     (-2)^3 + 6 \cdot (-2)^2 + 15 \cdot (-2) + 14 = -8 + 24 - 30 + 14 = 0
     \]
     So, \(x = -2\) is a root.

4. Dividing the cubic polynomial by \((x + 2)\) using synthetic division, we get the quadratic polynomial:
   \[
   x^2 + 4x + 7
   \]

5. Checking the discriminant of the quadratic polynomial \(x^2 + 4x + 7\) to see if it has real roots:
   \[
   \Delta = 16 - 28 = -12
   \]
   Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots.

Thus, the integer roots of the original quartic equation are \(\boxed{-2}\) and \(\boxed{1}\).
