Question:
Two numbers, $x$ and $y$ are selected at random from the interval $(0,3)$.  What is the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ exists?

Correct Answer:
If a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ exists, the triangle inequality must be satisfied, which states that $x+y>1$, $1+x>y$, and $1+y>x$.  We can draw a plane with $x$ and $y$ axes and shade in the area where all of these inequalities are satisfied.

The total area of the square is $3^2=9$.  The area of the unshaded region is $2^2+1/2=9/2$.  Thus, the shaded area is $9/2$ and the probability that such a triangle exists is $(9/2)/9=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here where two numbers, x and y, are selected at random from the interval (0,3). I need to find the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, x, and y exists. Hmm, okay. I remember that for three lengths to form a triangle, they have to satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. That theorem says that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, for sides 1, x, and y, all three inequalities must hold.

Let me write down the triangle inequalities:

1. 1 + x > y
2. 1 + y > x
3. x + y > 1

So, these are the three conditions that must be satisfied for 1, x, and y to form a triangle. Now, since x and y are selected from (0,3), it means that both x and y are greater than 0 and less than 3. So, they can take any value in that interval.

Since we're dealing with probabilities, it's likely that we need to model this geometrically. I think the best way to approach this is by considering x and y as coordinates in a coordinate plane, specifically in the xy-plane. So, we can think of all possible pairs (x, y) as points within a square with sides of length 3, from (0,0) to (3,3). The area of this square will represent the total number of possible outcomes, and the area where the triangle inequality holds will represent the favorable outcomes. The probability will then be the ratio of these two areas.

So, first, let's sketch this out mentally. The square has sides of 3 units each, so the area is 3*3=9 square units. Now, within this square, we need to find the region where all three triangle inequalities are satisfied. Let's consider each inequality one by one and see how they translate into regions on the coordinate plane.

Starting with the first inequality: 1 + x > y. This can be rewritten as y < x + 1. So, in the xy-plane, this is the region below the line y = x + 1. Similarly, the second inequality is 1 + y > x, which can be rewritten as x < y + 1. This is the region below the line x = y + 1. The third inequality is x + y > 1, which is the region above the line x + y = 1.

So, if I consider all three inequalities, we have three lines: y = x + 1, x = y + 1, and x + y = 1. These lines will partition the square into different regions, some of which satisfy all three inequalities.

But before I dive into solving for each inequality, I should note that in the square from (0,0) to (3,3), these lines will intersect each other and the boundaries of the square. So, I need to find the intersection points of these lines to figure out the boundaries of the region where all three inequalities hold.

Let's find the intersection points:

1. Intersection of y = x + 1 and x + y = 1:
   Substitute y from the first equation into the second:
   x + (x + 1) = 1
   2x + 1 = 1
   2x = 0
   x = 0
   Then, y = 0 + 1 = 1
   So, the intersection point is (0,1).

2. Intersection of y = x + 1 and x = y + 1:
   Substitute x from the second equation into the first:
   y = (y + 1) + 1
   y = y + 2
   0 = 2
   Wait, that doesn't make sense. So, these lines are parallel? Because they have the same slope (1) but different y-intercepts. So, they never intersect.

3. Intersection of x = y + 1 and x + y = 1:
   Substitute x from the second equation into the first:
   (y + 1) + y = 1
   2y + 1 = 1
   2y = 0
   y = 0
   Then, x = 0 + 1 = 1
   So, the intersection point is (1,0).

So, the lines y = x + 1 and x + y = 1 intersect at (0,1), and the lines x = y + 1 and x + y = 1 intersect at (1,0). The line y = x + 1 and x = y + 1 don't intersect because they are parallel.

Therefore, the region where all three inequalities hold is a polygon bounded by these lines. Let me try to visualize this.

In the square from (0,0) to (3,3), we have the line y = x + 1 which starts at (0,1) and goes up with a slope of 1. The line x = y + 1 starts at (1,0) and goes up with a slope of -1. The line x + y = 1 is a diagonal line from (0,1) to (1,0). So, these three lines form a triangle in the lower-left corner of the square.

Therefore, the region where all three inequalities hold is a triangle with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), and the point where x + y = 1 meets the other boundaries. Wait, but x + y =1 is a boundary line. Let me check where else it might intersect with the square.

But in the region from (0,0) to (3,3), the line x + y =1 will intersect the square at (0,1) and (1,0). So, the triangle we're talking about is bounded by these two points and the line y = x +1? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I need to think again. Let me sketch it mentally.

In the square from (0,0) to (3,3), if we have the line y = x +1, it starts at (0,1) and goes up. The line x + y =1 is the diagonal from (0,1) to (1,0). The line x = y +1 starts at (1,0) and goes up.

So, the region where all three inequalities hold is the intersection of the regions defined by y < x +1, x < y +1, and y > 1 - x.

So, in the square, that region is bounded by these three lines.

But wait, since all three lines pass through (0,1) and (1,0), the overlapping region is actually a triangle with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), and another point where y = x +1 meets x + y =1. But earlier, we saw that y = x +1 and x + y =1 intersect at (0,1). So, actually, the overlapping region is just the line segment from (0,1) to (1,0). Hmm, that can't be right because then the area would be zero. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the third inequality correctly. The third inequality is x + y >1, which is the area above the line x + y =1. So, the region where all three inequalities hold is the area above x + y =1 and below y = x +1 and below x = y +1.

So, the overlapping region is a polygon. Let me try to figure out the vertices.

Let me think. When x and y are both greater than 0, x + y >1 is the area above the line x + y =1. So, in the square, that's the area above that diagonal.

But the lines y = x +1 and x = y +1 both start from the lower left and upper right of the square. So, their intersection is at (0,1) and (1,0). So, the region where all three inequalities hold is the area that is above x + y =1, below y = x +1, and below x = y +1.

Wait, but when you have three lines, the region where all three inequalities hold is the intersection of the three half-planes. So, that region is a polygon bounded by the three lines.

Looking at the square, the region above x + y =1, below y = x +1, and below x = y +1. Let's try to find the vertices.

First, the intersection of x + y =1 and y = x +1. We know that they intersect at (0,1).

Second, the intersection of x + y =1 and x = y +1. They intersect at (1,0).

Third, the intersection of y = x +1 and x = y +1. As we saw earlier, these lines are parallel and do not intersect.

So, the region is a triangle with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), and another point where one of the lines meets the boundary of the square. Wait, but x + y =1 intersects the square only at (0,1) and (1,0). So, is the region bounded by these two lines and the square?

Wait, maybe I should think of the region as a quadrilateral? But no, because the lines y = x +1 and x = y +1 don't intersect within the square, so the region is actually a triangle with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), and the point where y = x +1 meets another boundary.

But y = x +1 goes beyond (0,1) upwards. But in the square, it only goes from (0,1) to (1,2). Wait, but the square is only up to (3,3). So, the line y = x +1 goes from (0,1) to (1,2), but since the square goes up to (3,3), it continues beyond.

Similarly, x = y +1 goes from (1,0) to (2,1), and beyond.

But in the square, we have to consider the region where all three inequalities hold. So, we have to be careful about the boundaries.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to visualize, I should write down the inequalities and find the region in the square where all three hold.

So, let's consider x and y in [0,3]. The three inequalities are:

1. y < x + 1
2. y > 1 - x
3. x < 3 and y < 3

Wait, no, actually, since x and y are both selected from (0,3), they can actually be up to 3, but the triangle inequalities are only about 1, x, y. So, even if x or y were greater than 2, for example, as long as 1 + x > y, etc., the triangle exists.

So, actually, x and y can range up to 3, but the triangle inequalities must hold.

So, the region we are interested in is within the square [0,3] x [0,3], and it's the area where y < x +1, y > 1 - x, and x < 3, y <3.

Wait, but in the square [0,3] x [0,3], the boundaries x=3 and y=3 are the edges, but since x and y are less than 3, perhaps the region is actually bounded by x=3 and y=3 as well.

Wait, but x and y are selected from (0,3), meaning they can be any real numbers between 0 and 3, but not including 0 and 3. So, actually, the square is open at the boundaries, but since we are dealing with continuous probability, the measure at the boundaries is zero, so it doesn't affect the probability.

So, essentially, we can model this as a square from (0,0) to (3,3), and find the area within this square where all three inequalities hold.

So, to find the area where y < x +1, y >1 -x, and x <3, y <3.

But let's see what these inequalities imply.

First, y < x +1. In the square, this is the area below the line y = x +1.

Second, y >1 -x. In the square, this is the area above the line y =1 -x.

Third, x <3 and y <3, but since the square is up to (3,3), but x and y can go up to 3, but in reality, the inequalities will restrict this.

But in the square, the lines y = x +1 and y =1 -x intersect each other at (0,1).

So, let's see:

- The line y =x +1 goes from (0,1) to (1,2), (2,3), etc.

- The line y =1 -x goes from (1,0) to (0,1), (-1,2), etc.

So, their intersection is at (0,1).

So, in the square, the region above y =1 -x and below y =x +1 is a quadrilateral?

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the lines y =x +1 and y =1 -x intersect at (0,1). So, above y =1 -x is a region above that line, and below y =x +1 is a region below that line.

So, the region where both y >1 -x and y <x +1 is a band between these two lines.

But in the square, the area between these two lines is a parallelogram.

Wait, but in the square, the lines y =x +1 and y =1 -x start at (0,1) and go to (1,2) and (-1,2) respectively, but in our case, x and y are positive, so we only consider x from 0 to 3 and y from 0 to3.

So, in the positive quadrant, the line y =x +1 starts at (0,1) and goes up to (1,2), (2,3), etc., while the line y =1 -x starts at (0,1) and goes down to (1,0), (2,-1), etc. But since y can't be negative, the area above y =1 -x is bounded by x=0 and y=0.

So, the region where y >1 -x is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1).

Similarly, the region where y <x +1 is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,2), (2,3), etc.

Wait, but in the positive quadrant, the line y =x +1 goes from (0,1) to (1,2), (2,3), and so on, but since y is limited to 3, the point (2,3) is on the boundary.

But in our square [0,3]x[0,3], the line y =x +1 goes from (0,1) to (2,3). Similarly, the line y =1 -x goes from (0,1) to (1,0).

So, the region where both y >1 -x and y <x +1 is a quadrilateral bounded by:

- From (0,1) up along y =1 -x to (1,0)

- Then along y =x +1 from (1,0) to (2,3)

- Then along y =3 from (2,3) to (3,3)

- Then back along x=3 to (3,0)

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because y cannot be less than 1 -x in that region.

Wait, actually, y must be greater than 1 -x and less than x +1.

So, let's think about the overlapping region.

When x is between 0 and1, y must be greater than 1 -x and less than x +1.

But when x is between1 and2, y must be greater than1 -x and less than x +1.

Wait, but for x in [0,1], 1 -x goes from1 to0, and x +1 goes from1 to2.

So, in this interval, y must be between1 -x andx +1, which is a vertical strip between these two lines.

Similarly, for x in [1,2], 1 -x goes from0 to -1, but since y cannot be negative, the lower bound is y=0.

Wait, so for x in [1,2], the lower bound is y=1 -x, but since y cannot be negative, we take y=0 as the lower bound.

But wait, no, the inequalities are y >1 -x and y <x +1. So, for x in [1,2], 1 -x is negative, so y > negative number. But since y must be positive, the lower bound is effectively y >0.

So, for x in [1,2], the region is the area between y=0 and y=x +1, but also bounded by y <x +1 and y >1 -x.

Wait, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe I should approach this problem by integrating over the region where all three inequalities hold.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the area by considering the intersection of the regions defined by each inequality.

So, first, the inequality 1 +x > y implies y <x +1.

Second, 1 + y >x implies x <y +1.

Third, x + y >1.

So, all three inequalities must hold.

Therefore, the region is defined by:

y <x +1,

y >1 -x,

and x <3,

y <3.

But since x and y are in (0,3), the inequalities are actually:

y <x +1,

y >1 -x,

x >0,

y >0,

x <3,

y <3.

So, in the square [0,3]x[0,3], the region is bounded by these four lines.

Let me try to find the intersection points of these boundaries.

First, the intersection of y =x +1 and y =1 -x is at (0,1).

Second, the intersection of y =x +1 and x =3 is at (3,4), but since y <3, this point is outside our square.

Similarly, the intersection of y =x +1 and y =3 is at (2,3).

Similarly, the intersection of y =1 -x and x =3 is at (3, -2), which is outside our square.

The intersection of y =1 -x and y =3 is at (-2,3), also outside.

Similarly, the intersection of y =1 -x and y =0 is at (1,0).

The intersection of y =x +1 and y =0 is at (-1,0), outside.

Similarly, the intersection of x =3 and y =3 is at (3,3), which is a corner.

So, in the square [0,3]x[0,3], the region where all three inequalities hold is bounded by:

- From (0,1) up along y =x +1 to (2,3),

- Then along y =3 from (2,3) to (3,3),

- Then along x =3 from (3,3) to (3,0),

- Then along y =1 -x from (3,0) to (2,-1), but since y can't be negative, this boundary is truncated at y=0.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to sketch this out step by step.

1. Start with the square from (0,0) to (3,3).

2. Draw the line y =x +1, which starts at (0,1) and goes up to (2,3).

3. Draw the line y =1 -x, which starts at (0,1) and goes down to (1,0).

4. Draw the line x =3, which is a vertical line on the right side.

5. Draw the line y =3, which is a horizontal line at the top.

Now, the region where y <x +1 is below the line y =x +1.

The region where y >1 -x is above the line y =1 -x.

The region where x <3 is to the left of x=3.

The region where y <3 is below y=3.

So, the overlapping region is the area that is below y =x +1, above y =1 -x, to the left of x=3, and below y=3.

So, let's break this down.

First, between x=0 and x=1, the region is between y=1 -x and y=x +1, which is a vertical strip.

At x=1, y=1 -x is 0, and y=x +1 is 2.

Then, between x=1 and x=2, the region is between y=0 and y=x +1, but since y must also be >1 -x, but for x >1, 1 -x becomes negative, so y >1 -x is automatically satisfied because y >=0.

Wait, so from x=1 to x=2, the lower bound is y=1 -x, but since y >=0, the effective lower bound is y=0.

Wait, but the inequality is y >1 -x, which for x >1 is y > negative number, but since y >=0, the lower bound is effectively y=0.

So, for x from1 to2, the region is between y=0 and y=x +1.

At x=2, y=x +1 is 3.

Then, from x=2 tox=3, the region is between y=1 -x and y=x +1, but since y cannot exceed3, the upper bound is y=3.

Wait, no, because the lines y=x +1 and y=1 -x only meet at (0,1) and (1,0). So, for x from2 to3, y=x +1 is beyond y=3, but since y is limited to3, we have to adjust.

Wait, actually, at x=2, y=x +1 is 3, and for x beyond2, y=x +1 would exceed3, but since y is bounded by3, the upper limit is y=3.

Similarly, for x=2, the lower bound is y=1 -x= -1, but since y must be >=0, the lower bound is y=0.

So, for x from2 to3, the region is between y=0 and y=3, but also must satisfy y <x +1. But since x +1 >3 when x>2, the upper bound is y=3.

Therefore, for x from2 to3, the region is between y=0 and y=3, but y must also be less thanx +1, which for x from2 to3, x +1 goes from3 to4.

But since y is limited to3, the upper bound is y=3.

Wait, but actually, for x from2 to3, the line y=x +1 is above3, so the upper bound for y is y=3.

Therefore, for x from2 to3, the region is between y=0 and y=3.

But is that correct? Wait, no, because the original inequality is y <x +1. So, for x from2 to3, y <x +1, but since x +1 goes up to4, but y is capped at3, so y <4, but since y is only up to3, the upper limit is y=3.

So, for x from2 to3, the region is between y=0 and y=3.

But we also have the other inequality y >1 -x.

So, for x from2 to3, y must be between1 -x and3, but since y >1 -x, which is negative, so effectively, y must be between0 and3, but also y <x +1, which is beyond3.

Wait, perhaps for x from2 to3, the region is between y=1 -x and y=x +1, but since y is bounded by3, the upper limit is y=3. So, actually, for x from2 to3, the region is between y=1 -x and y=3.

But we need to check whether 1 -x is less than3, which it is, since x >=2, so 1 -x <=-1, which is less than0.

But since y >=0, the lower bound is y=0. So, perhaps the region is between y=0 and y=3.

Wait, but y must also be less thanx +1, which is beyond3, so the upper bound is y=3.

Therefore, for x from2 to3, the region is between y=0 and y=3, but also the region must be above y=1 -x, which is automatically satisfied because y >=0.

Therefore, the region for x from0 to1 is between y=1 -x and y=x +1.

For x from1 to2, the region is between y=0 and y=x +1.

For x from2 to3, the region is between y=0 and y=3.

But we also need to consider that y <x +1.

Wait, but for x from2 to3, y <x +1 is redundant because y is already less than3, and x +1 is greater than3.

Wait, no, because y is less than3, but x +1 can be greater than3, but since y is already less than3, the condition y <x +1 is automatically satisfied because y <3 <=x +1 when x >=2.

Wait, for x >=2, x +1 >=3, so since y <3, y <x +1 is automatically true because x +1 >=3.

Therefore, for x from2 to3, y is between0 and3, which automatically satisfies y <x +1.

Therefore, the region is:

- For x from0 to1: between y=1 -x and y=x +1.

- For x from1 to2: between y=0 and y=x +1.

- For x from2 to3: between y=0 and y=3.

But wait, at x=2, y= x +1=3, and y=3 is the upper limit.

So, let me calculate the area of each region.

First, for x from0 to1:

The region is between y=1 -x and y=x +1.

The area can be found by integrating the difference between the two functions from x=0 to x=1.

So, the area A1 is:

A1 = ∫ from 0 to1 [ (x +1) - (1 -x) ] dx

= ∫ from0 to1 (2x) dx

= [x^2] from0 to1

= 1 -0 =1

So, the area for x from0 to1 is1.

Second, for x from1 to2:

The region is between y=0 and y=x +1.

So, the area A2 is:

A2 = ∫ from1 to2 [ (x +1) -0 ] dx

= ∫ from1 to2 (x +1) dx

= [ (1/2)x^2 +x ] from1 to2

= ( (1/2)(4) +2 ) - ( (1/2)(1) +1 )

= (2 +2) - (0.5 +1)

= 4 -1.5 =2.5

Third, for x from2 to3:

The region is between y=0 and y=3.

So, the area A3 is:

A3 = ∫ from2 to3 (3 -0) dx

= ∫ from2 to3 3 dx

= 3*(3 -2) =3*1=3

Therefore, the total area where all three inequalities hold is A1 + A2 + A3 =1 +2.5 +3=6.5.

So, the area is6.5.

But wait, the total area of the square is3*3=9. So, the probability is6.5/9≈0.7222.

But let me double-check my calculations because 6.5 is a bit low for the area where all three inequalities hold.

Wait, so the total area is9, and the area where all three inequalities hold is6.5. So, the probability is6.5/9≈0.7222, which is approximately72.22%.

But I want to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in calculating the areas.

First, for A1: x from0 to1, between y=1 -x and y=x +1. The integral of 2x from0 to1 is indeed1.

A2: x from1 to2, between y=0 and y=x +1, which is ∫(x +1)dx from1 to2.

Compute the integral:

∫(x +1)dx= (1/2)x² +x.

At x=2: (1/2)(4) +2=2+2=4.

At x=1: (1/2)(1)+1=0.5 +1=1.5.

Difference:4 -1.5=2.5. So, A2=2.5.

A3: x from2 to3, between y=0 and y=3, which is a rectangle with width1 (from2 to3) and height3. So, area=3*1=3.

Total area:1 +2.5 +3=6.5.

Total area of the square:3*3=9.

So, 6.5/9=13/18≈0.7222.

Wait, 6.5 is equal to13/2, so 13/2 divided by9 is13/18.

So, the probability is13/18.

Wait, but I had a conflicting thought earlier about the region.

But wait, actually, let me think again. The region where all three inequalities hold is a polygon with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (2,3), (3,3), (3,0), (2,-1) but since y can't be negative, it's clipped at (2,0). Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, actually, the region is a polygon with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (2,3), (3,3), (3,0), but we have to make sure that all these points lie within the square and satisfy all three inequalities.

Wait, but (2,3) is on the line y=x +1, and (3,3) is on the line y=3.

But actually, since we're dealing with a square [0,3]x[0,3], the region is a polygon with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (2,3), (3,3), (3,0), and back to (0,1). Wait, but that seems like a pentagon.

But let's plot it mentally:

- From (0,1) to (1,0): line y=x +1.

- From (1,0) to (2,3): line y=x +1.

- From (2,3) to (3,3): line y=3.

- From (3,3) to (3,0): line x=3.

- From (3,0) to (0,1): line y=1 -x.

Wait, but (3,0) to (0,1) is the line y=1 -x, but it's only the segment from (3,0) to (0,1), which is outside the square except for the points (3,0) and (0,1). So, actually, the region is bounded by:

- From (0,1) to (1,0) along y=x +1.

- From (1,0) to (2,3) along y=x +1.

- From (2,3) to (3,3) along y=3.

- From (3,3) back to (0,1) along x=3 and y=1 -x, but since y can't be negative, it's just the line from (3,0) to (0,1).

But actually, the region is bounded by y=1 -x for x from0 to1, y=x +1 for x from1 to2, and y=3 for x from2 to3.

Wait, perhaps the area is composed of two parts:

1. A quadrilateral from (0,1) to (1,0) to (2,3) to (3,3) to (3,0).

But actually, no, the region is bounded by the lines y=1 -x, y=x +1, y=3, and x=3.

Wait, maybe it's a trapezoid or a triangle.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the area by breaking it into two parts:

- The area between y=1 -x and y=x +1 from x=0 to x=1.

- The area between y=0 and y=3 fromx=1 to x=3.

Wait, but in reality, the region is:

From x=0 tox=1, it's between y=1 -x and y=x +1.

From x=1 tox=2, it's between y=0 and y=x +1.

From x=2 tox=3, it's between y=0 and y=3.

So, the total area is indeed A1 + A2 + A3=1 +2.5 +3=6.5.

So, the probability is6.5/9=13/18≈0.7222.

But wait, another approach is to calculate the area where all three inequalities hold without breaking it down into regions.

We can use the geometric probability formula, but that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of inclusion-exclusion.

But since we have three variables, the inclusion-exclusion principle for three events might be complex, but maybe manageable.

But perhaps the way I did it before is correct.

But just to make sure, let me think about the figure.

So, in the square [0,3]x[0,3], the region where all three inequalities hold is:

- Above y=1 -x,

- Below y=x +1,

- Left of x=3,

- Below y=3.

So, it's a polygon with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (2,3), (3,3), (3,0), and back to (0,1).

Wait, but (0,1) is the intersection of y=1 -x and y=x +1.

(1,0) is the intersection of y=1 -x and y=0.

(2,3) is the intersection of y=x +1 and y=3.

(3,3) is the corner of the square.

(3,0) is the intersection of y=3 and y=0.

Then back to (0,1) along y=1 -x.

But this is a pentagon, but in reality, the polygon is formed by four points:

(0,1), (1,0), (2,3), (3,3), (3,0), and back to (0,1).

Wait, but (3,0) is connected back to (0,1) via the line y=1 -x, which is a diagonal.

So, the figure is a pentagon, but with one of its sides being a diagonal.

Wait, but in any case, computing the area of a pentagon can be done by breaking it into simpler shapes.

Alternatively, since we already computed it as6.5, which is13/2, and 13/18≈0.7222, which is approximately72.22%.

But to make sure, let me compute the area using another method.

Let me consider the polygon with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (2,3), (3,3), (3,0), and back to (0,1).

We can use the shoelace formula to compute the area.

The shoelace formula is a mathematical algorithm to determine the area of a polygon given its vertices in order.

Formula:

Area = |(x1y2 +x2y3 +x3y4 +x4y5 +x5y6 +x6y1) - (y1x2 + y2x3 + y3x4 + y4x5 + y5x6 + y6x1)| /2

So, let's assign the points in order:

(0,1), (1,0), (2,3), (3,3), (3,0), (0,1)

So, list of points:

1. (0,1)

2. (1,0)

3. (2,3)

4. (3,3)

5. (3,0)

6. (0,1)

Compute the sum of xi yi+1:

(0*0) + (1*3) + (2*3) + (3*0) + (3*1) + (0*1)

Wait, let me do step by step:

x1y2 =0*0=0

x2y3=1*3=3

x3y4=2*3=6

x4y5=3*0=0

x5y6=3*1=3

x6y1=0*1=0

Total sum:0 +3 +6 +0 +3 +0=12

Now, sum of yi xi+1:

y1x2=1*1=1

y2x3=0*2=0

y3x4=3*3=9

y4x5=3*3=9

y5x6=0*0=0

y6x1=1*0=0

Total sum:1 +0 +9 +9 +0 +0=19

So, area=|12 -19| /2=| -7 | /2=7/2=3.5

Wait, but earlier I had6.5.

Wait, that's inconsistent. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the shoelace formula.

Wait, actually, the shoelace formula is:

Area = 1/2 |sum_{i=1 to n} (xi yi+1 - xi+1 yi)|

So, in this case,

Compute for each i from1 to6:

i=1: x1y2 -x2y1=0*0 -1*1=0 -1=-1

i=2: x2y3 -x3y2=1*3 -2*0=3 -0=3

i=3: x3y4 -x4y3=2*3 -3*3=6 -9=-3

i=4: x4y5 -x5y4=3*0 -3*3=0 -9=-9

i=5: x5y6 -x6y5=3*1 -0*0=3 -0=3

i=6: x6y1 -x1y6=0*1 -0*1=0 -0=0

Sum all these up:

-1 +3 -3 -9 +3 +0= (-1 +3)=2; (2 -3)=-1; (-1 -9)=-10; (-10 +3)=-7; (-7 +0)=-7

Absolute value:7

Area=7/2=3.5

So, the shoelace formula gives me3.5, which is7/2.

But earlier, breaking it into regions, I got6.5, which is13/2.

That's a discrepancy.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, let's see.

Alternatively, maybe my region is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the region I considered is not the same as the polygon I described.

Wait, if I go back to the initial problem, the three inequalities are:

1. y <x +1

2. y >1 -x

3. x + y >1

Which define a region.

But in the square [0,3]x[0,3], the intersection of these three regions is the area above y=1 -x and below y=x +1.

But in addition, we must have y <3 and x <3.

So, the region is bounded by y=1 -x, y=x +1, x=3, y=3, and y=0.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about it differently.

Wait, maybe to visualize it, the area where all three inequalities hold is the area above y=1 -x, below y=x +1, left of x=3, and below y=3.

So, it's a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (2,3), (3,3), (3,0), and back to (0,1).

Wait, but when I used the shoelace formula, it gave me3.5.

But when I broke it into regions, I got6.5.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I messed up in the initial region breakdown.

Wait, let's take another approach.

Let me sketch the lines:

1. y=1 -x is a line with slope -1, passing through (0,1) and (1,0).

2. y=x +1 is a line with slope1, passing through (0,1) and (1,2).

3. y=3 is a horizontal line.

4. x=3 is a vertical line.

So, the region where y <x +1 and y >1 -x is between these two lines.

But the other inequality is x + y >1.

So, in the square, the area where x + y >1 is everything above the line x + y =1.

So, the intersection of these three inequalities.

Wait, so the region is above y=1 -x, below y=x +1, and above y=1 -x as well.

But x + y >1 is automatically satisfied because y >0, so x + y >x >0. But x can be as low as0, so x + y >1 is more restrictive.

Wait, for x from0 to1, y must be >1 -x.

For x from1 to2, y must be >1 -x.

But since y >=0, for x from1 to2, y must be >1 -x.

But for x from2 to3, y must be >1 -x, which is negative, so y must be >0.

So, in the square, the region where all three inequalities hold is:

- From x=0 to x=1: y >1 -x and y <x +1.

- From x=1 to x=2: y >1 -x (since 1 -x is negative) and y <x +1.

- From x=2 to x=3: y >0 and y <x +1.

But in the square, y is limited by3.

So, this region is:

- A quadrilateral from (0,1) to (1,0) to (2,3) to (3,3) to (3,0) to (0,1).

Wait, but that's a pentagon, but the shoelace formula gave me3.5.

But when I broke it down into A1 + A2 + A3, I got6.5.

Wait, perhaps the region is not that pentagon. Maybe the region is only the quadrilateral.

Wait, no, because when x is from0 to1, you have the triangle, and from x=1 to2, you have a quadrilateral.

Wait, perhaps the correct area is indeed6.5.

Wait, but why does the shoelace formula give me3.5?

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the shoelace formula. Let me try another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can divide the region into two parts:

1. The area between y=1 -x and y=x +1 from x=0 to x=1.

2. The area between y=0 and y=x +1 from x=1 to x=2.

3. The area between y=0 and y=3 from x=2 to x=3.

Wait, but that's the same as before, giving6.5.

But why does the shoelace formula suggest3.5? Maybe because the polygon is not convex or something.

Wait, no, the shoelace formula is a reliable method for convex polygons.

Wait, perhaps my points are not ordered correctly.

In the shoelace formula, the points must be ordered either clockwise or counterclockwise without crossing.

In my previous calculation, I took the points as:

(0,1), (1,0), (2,3), (3,3), (3,0), (0,1)

Plotting them, that should form a convex polygon.

Wait, let me compute the shoelace formula step by step:

List the coordinates:

1. (0,1)

2. (1,0)

3. (2,3)

4. (3,3)

5. (3,0)

6. (0,1)

Compute the sum of xi*yi+1:

(0*0) + (1*3) + (2*3) + (3*0) + (3*1) + (0*1)

=0 +3 +6 +0 +3 +0=12

Compute the sum of yi*xi+1:

(1*1) + (0*2) + (3*3) + (3*3) + (0*0) + (1*0)

=1 +0 +9 +9 +0 +0=19

Compute the difference:12 -19= -7

Take absolute value and divide by2: |-7| /2=3.5

So, area=3.5.

Wait, but this is for the polygon (0,1),(1,0),(2,3),(3,3),(3,0),(0,1). But in reality, the region defined by the inequalities is a different polygon.

Wait, perhaps the region is not the convex hull of those points. Maybe the region is bounded by y=1 -x, y=x +1, x=3, and y=3.

Wait, but that's the same as before, which gives6.5.

Wait, perhaps the shoelace formula is being applied incorrectly because the polygon is not being traced correctly.

Wait, let's try to compute the area of the polygon with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (2,3), (3,3), (3,0), (0,1).

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use integration.

Let me try integrating the region.

The region is bounded by:

- From x=0 tox=1: y from1 -x toy=x +1.

- Fromx=1 tox=2: y from0 toy=x +1.

- Fromx=2 tox=3: y from0 toy=3.

So, the area can be computed as:

A1=∫(0 to1) [x +1 - (1 -x)] dx=∫0 to1 2x dx=1

A2=∫(1 to2) [x +1 -0] dx=∫1 to2 (x +1) dx= [x²/2 +x] from1 to2= (2 +2) - (0.5 +1)=4 -1.5=2.5

A3=∫(2 to3) [3 -0]=3 dx=3*(1)=3

Total area=1 +2.5 +3=6.5.

So, 6.5 is correct.

But the shoelace formula gave me3.5, which is different.

Wait, why is that?

Ah, because the shoelace formula is giving me the area of the polygon (0,1),(1,0),(2,3),(3,3),(3,0),(0,1). But in reality, the region defined by the inequalities is different.

Wait, perhaps the shoelace formula is counting the area of the polygon, but in this case, the region is not the convex hull of those points.

Wait, actually, let me plot the points:

(0,1): on the left side.

(1,0): at the bottom.

(2,3): upper right corner.

(3,3): upper right.

(3,0): bottom right.

(0,1): back to the left.

So, the polygon formed is a pentagon, but in reality, the region we're considering is a quadrilateral.

Wait, perhaps the region is a pentagon, but due to the lines y=1 -x and y=x +1, which intersect at (0,1). So, maybe the area is a pentagon, but the shoelace formula is correct.

Wait, but the shoelace formula gave me3.5, but according to the region breakdown, it's6.5.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the region is only the area above y=1 -x, below y=x +1, and below y=3, but restricted by x=3.

So, it's a trapezoid.

Wait, but let's see:

From x=0 tox=1: y from1 -x toy=x +1.

Fromx=1 tox=2: y from0 toy=x +1.

Fromx=2 tox=3: y from0 toy=3.

So, integrating, as before, gives6.5.

Wait, but why does the shoelace formula give me3.5?

Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the shoelace formula is not applicable here because the polygon is not convex or something.

Wait, no, the polygon is convex.

Wait, maybe the region is not that pentagon but another shape.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the region as the intersection of three areas:

1. Above y=1 -x.

2. Below y=x +1.

3. Below y=3.

So, the region is bounded by these three curves.

So, the area is the set of points where y is between1 -x andx +1, and y <=3, andx <=3.

So, integrating over x from0 to3, for each x, y from1 -x to min(x +1,3).

But, as we saw, whenx +1 <=3, which is forx <=2, so y from1 -x tox +1. Whenx >2, y from1 -x to3.

Therefore, the area can be written as:

A= ∫ from0 to2 [ (x +1) - (1 -x) ] dx + ∫ from2 to3 [3 - (1 -x) ] dx

Compute first integral:

∫0 to2 [x +1 -1 +x] dx= ∫0 to2 2x dx= [x²] from0 to2=4 -0=4

Second integral:

∫2 to3 [3 -1 +x ] dx= ∫2 to3 (2 +x) dx= [2x +0.5x²] from2 to3

Atx=3:6 +4.5=10.5

Atx=2:4 +2=6

Difference:10.5 -6=4.5

Thus, total area=4 +4.5=8.5

Wait, that's different.

Wait, no, wait, in the integral for the second part, it should be [3 - (1 -x)] =3 -1 +x=2 +x.

So, ∫2 to3 (2 +x) dx= [2x +0.5x²] from2 to3

At3:6 +4.5=10.5

At2:4 +2=6

Difference:10.5 -6=4.5

So, total area=4 +4.5=8.5.

But8.5 is17/2≈8.5.

Wait, but that seems too large, since the square is9, and the region can't exceed9.

Wait, but no, because we're considering the region where all three inequalities hold, which is a subset.

Wait, but according to my calculations, it's8.5.

But earlier, breaking it down into regions gave me6.5, and the shoelace formula gave me3.5.

Wait, something is wrong here.

Wait, let me make a table of x and y.

Wait, perhaps the integral is correct.

Wait, but let me check with another approach.

Let me use the formula for the area of a polygon.

But since the area is a pentagon, it's better to use the shoelace formula.

Wait, but according to the shoelace formula, the area is3.5.

But according to the integral, it's8.5.

Wait, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the integrals.

Wait, let's think about the region.

From x=0 to x=1, the region is between y=1 -x and y=x +1.

From x=1 to x=2, it's between y=0 and y=x +1.

Fromx=2 tox=3, it's between y=0 and y=3.

So, the area is indeed:

A1=1, A2=2.5, A3=3, so total6.5.

But according to the integral, it's8.5.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake in the integral setup.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that forx from0 to1, y is between1 -x andx +1, which is a triangle.

But whenx from1 to2, y is between0 andx +1, which is a trapezoid.

Wait, but no, it's not a trapezoid.

Wait, whenx from1 to2, y is between0 andx +1, which is a triangle.

Wait, no, because atx=1, y is between0 and2, and atx=2, y is between0 and3.

So, it's a region that's a triangle.

Wait, let me think.

Wait, fromx=1 to x=2, the region is between y=0 and y=x +1.

So, that's a triangle with vertices at(1,0),(2,3),(1,2).

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, whenx=1, y=2.

Whenx=2, y=3.

So, it's a triangle with points(1,0),(2,3),(1,2).

Wait, which is a right triangle with base1 and height2.

So, area=0.5*1*2=1.

But in our previous integral, we hadA2=2.5.

Wait, so I think I'm making a mistake in the integral.

Wait, actually, fromx=1 tox=2, the region is between y=0 and y=x +1.

So, the area is ∫ from1 to2 (x +1 -0)dx= ∫1 to2 (x +1)dx= [0.5x² +x] from1 to2= (2 +2) - (0.5 +1)=4 -1.5=2.5.

Which is correct.

Similarly, fromx=2 tox=3, the region is between y=0 and y=3.

So, area=∫2 to3 (3 -0)dx=3*(1)=3.

So, total area=1 +2.5 +3=6.5.

Wait, but according to the shoelace formula, it's3.5.

Wait, that's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the shoelace formula.

Wait, let me list the points again:

The vertices are:

(0,1), (1,0), (2,3), (3,3), (3,0), (0,1)

But perhaps that's not the correct polygon.

Wait, actually, the region is defined by the lines:

y=1 -x, y=x +1, x=3, y=3.

So, the polygon is bounded by these four lines:

1. y=1 -x from(0,1) to(1,0).

2. y=x +1 from(1,0) to(2,3).

3. x=3 from(2,3) to(3,3).

4. y=3 from(3,3) to(3,0).

5. y=0 from(3,0) to(0,1).

So, the polygon is a pentagon, but it's not convex because the line y=1 -x goes from(0,1) to(1,0), but also goes through(2,-1), which is outside the square.

Wait, no, in reality, the polygon is bounded only by the lines within the square.

Wait, so the polygon is(0,1),(1,0),(2,3),(3,3),(3,0), back to(0,1).

So, that's a pentagon.

But the shoelace formula gave me3.5, but the area should be6.5.

Wait, perhaps the shoelace formula is not applicable here because the polygon is not convex or something.

Wait, no, the polygon is convex because all its interior angles are less than180 degrees.

Wait, but when I applied the shoelace formula, I got3.5, while breaking it into regions, I got6.5.

Wait, that's impossible. Unless I made a mistake in one of the steps.

Wait, let me check the shoelace formula again.

List of points:

1. (0,1)

2. (1,0)

3. (2,3)

4. (3,3)

5. (3,0)

6. (0,1)

Compute sum of xi*yi+1:

x1y2=0*0=0

x2y3=1*3=3

x3y4=2*3=6

x4y5=3*0=0

x5y6=3*1=3

x6y1=0*1=0

Total sum:0 +3 +6 +0 +3 +0=12

Sum of yi*xi+1:

y1x2=1*1=1

y2x3=0*2=0

y3x4=3*3=9

y4x5=3*3=9

y5x6=0*0=0

y6x1=1*0=0

Total sum:1 +0 +9 +9 +0 +0=19

Difference:12 -19= -7

Area=| -7 | /2=3.5

But according to the integral, it's6.5.

Therefore, one of the methods is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the shoelace formula isn't applicable here because the polygon is not simple or something.

Wait, no, the polygon is a simple polygon.

Wait, perhaps the region is not convex.

Wait, but in reality, the region is a convex polygon.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the region is not the convex hull of the points, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the region is not just these five points, but another set.

Wait, let me think again about the inequalities.

The region where y <x +1 and y>1 -x is a band between the lines y=1 -x and y=x +1.

Within the square [0,3]x[0,3], this band intersects the square.

The other inequality is x + y >1.

So, the region is the part of the band y <x +1 and y>1 -x that is also above the line y=1 -x.

Wait, no, x + y >1 is a different condition.

Wait, perhaps the region is the intersection of y <x +1, y>1 -x, and x + y >1.

So, that's a different region.

Wait, perhaps I should make a table of x and y.

Wait, let me fix x and find the range of y.

For x from0 to1:

- y must be >1 -x (since y <x +1 and y >=0)

- y must be >0 (since x + y >1, which for x <=1, x +1 >1)

So, for0 <=x <=1, y from1 -x toy=x +1.

Area=∫0 to1 (x +1 - (1 -x))dx=∫0 to1 2x dx=1.

For x from1 to2:

- y must be >1 -x (since y <x +1 and y >=0, but 1 -x is negative, so y can be from0 toy=x +1.

- y must be >0 (since x + y >1, but forx >=1, x +1 >1, so y can be from0 toy=x +1.

So, for1 <=x <=2, y from0 toy=x +1.

Area=∫1 to2 (x +1 -0)dx=∫1 to2 (x +1)dx= [0.5x² +x] from1 to2= (2 +2) - (0.5 +1)=4 -1.5=2.5.

For x from2 to3:

- y must be >x +1 (since y <x +1 and y >0, but x +1 >3 whenx >=2, so y must be >3.

- y must be >0.

But since y <=3, the region is y from0 toy=3.

So, for2 <=x <=3, y from0 toy=3.

Area=∫2 to3 3 -0 dx=3*(1)=3.

Thus, total area=1 +2.5 +3=6.5.

Therefore, the correct area is6.5.

Thus, the probability is6.5 /9=13/18.

Therefore, the probability is13/18.

**Final Answer**
The probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, \(x\), and \(x\) exists is \boxed{\dfrac{13}{18}}.
</think>

To determine the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, \(x\), and \(x\) exists, we need to find the region within the unit square \([0, 3] \times [0, 3]\) where the triangle inequalities are satisfied. The triangle inequalities are:

1. \(1 + x > x + 1\) (always true)
2. \(1 + x > x + 1\) (always true)
3. \(x + x > 1\) which simplifies to \(x > 0.5\)

The region where all three inequalities hold is defined by the inequalities \(y < x + 1\), \(y > 1 - x\), and \(x + y > 1\). This region is a polygon with vertices at \((0, 1)\), \((1, 0)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 3)\), \((3, 0)\), and back to \((0, 1)\).

To find the area of this region, we break it down into three parts:

1. The area between the lines \(y = 1 - x\) and \(y = x + 1\) from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\). This forms a triangle with area 1.
2. The area between the line \(y = x + 1\) and the x-axis from \(x = 1\) to \(x = 2\). This forms a trapezoid with area 2.5.
3. The area between the line \(y = 3\) and the y-axis from \(x = 2\) to \(x = 3\). This forms a rectangle with area 3.

Adding these areas together, we get the total area:

\[ 1 + 2.5 + 3 = 6.5 \]

The total area of the square \([0, 3] \times [0, 3]\) is \(3 \times 3 = 9\). Therefore, the probability is:

\[ \frac{6.5}{9} = \frac{13}{18} \]

Thus, the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, \(x\), and \(x\) exists is \(\boxed{\dfrac{13}{18}}\).
