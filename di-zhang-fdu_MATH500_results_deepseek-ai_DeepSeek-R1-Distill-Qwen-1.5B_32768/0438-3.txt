Question:
If $re^{i \theta}$ is a root of
\[z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 = 0,\]where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi,$ then find the sum of all possible values of $\theta.$

Correct Answer:
The given equation can be written as
\[\frac{z^9 + 1}{z + 1} = 0.\]Then $z^9 + 1 = 0,$ or $z^9 = -1.$  Since $z = e^{i \theta},$
\[e^{9i \theta} = -1.\]This means $9 \theta = \pi + 2 \pi k$ for some integer $k.$  Since $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi,$ the possible values of $k$ are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.   (We omit $k = 4,$ because if $k = 4,$ then $\theta = \pi,$ so $z = -1,$ which makes $z + 1 = 0.$)  Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $\theta$ is
\[\frac{\pi}{9} + \frac{3 \pi}{9} + \frac{5 \pi}{9} + \frac{7 \pi}{9} + \frac{11 \pi}{9} + \frac{13 \pi}{9} + \frac{15 \pi}{9} + \frac{17 \pi}{9} = \boxed{8 \pi}.\]

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I came across this problem today, and at first glance, it looked a bit intimidating. But then I remembered that sometimes complex numbers and polynomials can be approached using their roots. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says: If \( re^{i \theta} \) is a root of the polynomial
\[ z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 = 0, \]
where \( r > 0 \) and \( 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi \), then we need to find the sum of all possible values of \( \theta \).

Hmm, okay. So, I know that for polynomials with real coefficients, the complex roots come in conjugate pairs. But this polynomial doesn't have real coefficients. Let me check:
Looking at the coefficients: 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1. Yeah, they are all real numbers. So that means if \( re^{i \theta} \) is a root, then \( re^{-i \theta} \) is also a root. That’s a good start.

Now, the polynomial is of degree 8, so there are 8 roots in total. The question is about the sum of all possible \( \theta \) values for each root. So, if I can find all the roots, I can find all the \( \theta \)s, and then add them up.

Wait, but how do I find the roots of this polynomial? It looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can factor it or recognize a pattern.

Looking at the polynomial:
\[ z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 = 0. \]
I notice that the exponents go from 8 down to 0, alternating signs. That reminds me of a geometric series or something similar.

Wait, a geometric series with ratio -z. Let me think: the sum of a geometric series is \( 1 + r + r^2 + \dots + r^n \). But here, the signs alternate, so it's \( 1 - z + z^2 - z^3 + \dots + z^8 \).

Yeah, that's exactly this polynomial. So, the polynomial is the sum from k=0 to 8 of \( (-z)^k \). So, in other words, it's \( \sum_{k=0}^8 (-z)^k \).

But wait, the sum of a geometric series is \( \frac{1 - r^{n+1}}{1 - r} \) for \( r \neq 1 \). So, applying that here, we can write the polynomial as:
\[ \frac{1 - (-z)^9}{1 - (-z)} = 0. \]
That's because the sum from k=0 to 8 of \( (-z)^k \) is \( \frac{1 - (-z)^9}{1 - (-z)} \).

Simplify the denominator: \( 1 - (-z) = 1 + z \). So, the polynomial is:
\[ \frac{1 - (-z)^9}{1 + z} = 0. \]
Which means that \( 1 - (-z)^9 = 0 \), so \( (-z)^9 = 1 \).

Therefore, \( (-z)^9 = 1 \) implies that \( -z \) is a 9th root of unity. So, \( -z = \omega \), where \( \omega \) is a primitive 9th root of unity or any root of unity with order dividing 9.

But since \( \omega^9 = 1 \), then \( \omega \) must satisfy \( \omega^9 = 1 \).

So, \( -z = \omega \), which implies \( z = -\omega \). Therefore, the roots \( z \) are the negatives of the 9th roots of unity.

Wait, so the roots are \( z = -\omega_k \), where \( \omega_k \) is a 9th root of unity.

But 9th roots of unity are \( e^{2\pi i k /9} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 8 \).

Therefore, \( z = -e^{2\pi i k /9} = e^{\pi i + 2\pi i k /9} = e^{2\pi i (k + 4.5)/9} \).

Wait, that might not be the simplest way. Alternatively, since \( z = -\omega \), and \( \omega = e^{2\pi i k /9} \), then \( z = -e^{2\pi i k /9} = e^{\pi i + 2\pi i k /9} \).

So, in exponential form, that's \( e^{2\pi i (k + 4.5)/9} \). Hmm, but maybe it's better to think in terms of angles.

Since \( \omega = e^{2\pi i k /9} \), then \( z = -\omega = e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k /9)} \).

So, each root \( z \) is at an angle \( \theta = \pi + \frac{2\pi k}{9} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 8 \).

But wait, hold on: \( z = -\omega = e^{i(\pi + \theta_k)} \), where \( \theta_k = \frac{2\pi k}{9} \). So, each root has angle \( \pi + \frac{2\pi k}{9} \).

But since \( z \) is a root, it's on the complex plane, so each root is at that angle.

But since the polynomial is of degree 8, there are 8 roots (including multiplicity), but 9th roots of unity are 9 in number.

Wait, no, the polynomial is degree 8, but \( z^9 = 1 \) has 9 roots. So, each root \( z \) is \( -\omega_k \), where \( \omega_k \) is a 9th root of unity.

So, each root \( z \) is \( e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k /9)} \), which is a 9th root of unity rotated by \( \pi \). So, each root \( z \) is at an angle \( \pi + \frac{2\pi k}{9} \).

But now, we have 9 roots, but the problem states that it's an 8th-degree polynomial. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's go back.

The polynomial is \( z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 = 0 \).

Wait, so it's a degree 8 polynomial. But if it's equal to \( \frac{1 - (-z)^9}{1 + z} \), then that would be equal to zero when \( 1 - (-z)^9 = 0 \), as long as \( 1 + z \neq 0 \).

So, that gives \( (-z)^9 = 1 \), so \( z^9 = (-1)^9 = -1 \).

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, actually, \( z^9 = -1 \). So, \( z^9 = -1 \), which means \( z \) is a 18th root of unity?

Wait, hold on.

Wait, \( z^9 = -1 \), so \( z^9 + 1 = 0 \), which factors as \( (z + 1)(z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1) = 0 \).

So, the original polynomial is a factor of \( z^9 + 1 = 0 \). So, the roots are the 9th roots of -1.

But -1 is \( e^{i\pi} \), so the 9th roots of -1 are \( e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/9} \) for \( k = 0, 1, ..., 8 \).

Therefore, the roots of the polynomial are \( z = e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/9} \) for \( k = 0, 1, ..., 8 \).

But wait, if \( z^9 = -1 \), then the roots are \( z = e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/9} \), which are 9 distinct roots.

But the given polynomial is degree 8. Hmm, so why is it degree 8?

Wait, because \( z = -1 \) is a root of \( z^9 + 1 = 0 \), but is it a root of the given polynomial?

Let me check: plug in \( z = -1 \) into the given polynomial.

Compute \( (-1)^8 - (-1)^7 + (-1)^6 - (-1)^5 + (-1)^4 - (-1)^3 + (-1)^2 - (-1) + 1 \).

Simplify each term:

1. \( (-1)^8 = 1 \)
2. \( -(-1)^7 = -(-1) = 1 \)
3. \( (-1)^6 = 1 \)
4. \( -(-1)^5 = -(-1) = 1 \)
5. \( (-1)^4 = 1 \)
6. \( -(-1)^3 = -(-1) = 1 \)
7. \( (-1)^2 = 1 \)
8. \( -(-1) = 1 \)
9. \( +1 \)

So, add them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 ≠ 0.

So, \( z = -1 \) is not a root of the given polynomial. Therefore, \( z^9 + 1 = 0 \) has a root \( z = -1 \), but our polynomial doesn't have \( z = -1 \) as a root, so \( z^9 + 1 \) and the given polynomial share a common factor?

Wait, no, if \( z^9 + 1 \) and the given polynomial share a common factor, then the given polynomial would be a factor of \( z^9 + 1 \). But since \( z = -1 \) is a root of \( z^9 + 1 = 0 \) but not of the given polynomial, they don't share a common factor. Therefore, the given polynomial indeed has 9 roots, but since it's degree 8, that can't be. Wait, no, it's 9th degree? Wait, no.

Wait, no, \( z^9 + 1 = 0 \) is a 9th-degree polynomial, but the given polynomial is \( z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 \). Let me check the degrees:

- \( z^9 + 1 \) is 9th-degree.
- The given polynomial is \( z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 \), which is 8th-degree.

Wait, so they differ by one degree. That suggests that perhaps \( z^9 + 1 \) is the minimal polynomial for the roots of the given polynomial, but since the given polynomial is 8th-degree, it must have 8 roots, so perhaps one of the roots is a multiple root? Or perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no, let's actually compute \( (z^9 + 1)/(z + 1) \). Let's do polynomial division:

Divide \( z^9 + 1 \) by \( z + 1 \):

Using synthetic division, but since it's \( z + 1 \), we can use \( z = -1 \).

Let me perform the division:

\( z^9 + 1 \) divided by \( z + 1 \). The root is \( z = -1 \). Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 (for \( z^9 \)), 0 (for \( z^8 \)), 0 (for \( z^7 \)), ..., 0 (for \( z^0 \) except the constant term is 1).

But actually, \( z^9 + 1 \) is \( z^9 + 0z^8 + 0z^7 + ... + 0z^2 + 0z + 1 \).

So, for synthetic division with root \( z = -1 \):

Bring down the 1.

Multiply by -1: 1*(-1) = -1. Add to next coefficient: 0 + (-1) = -1.

Multiply by -1: (-1)*(-1) = 1. Add to next coefficient: 0 + 1 = 1.

Continue this process:

Each step, the coefficient alternates between -1 and 1, starting from the second term.

Wait, but this seems tedious, but perhaps we can find a pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps \( (z + 1)(z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1) = z^9 + 1 \). Let me check:

Multiply \( (z + 1) \) by \( (z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1) \):

\( z \times (z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1) = z^9 - z^8 + z^7 - z^6 + z^5 - z^4 + z^3 - z^2 + z \).

Then, add \( 1 \times (z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1) \):

= \( z^9 - z^8 + z^7 - z^6 + z^5 - z^4 + z^3 - z^2 + z + z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 \).

Now, combine like terms:

- \( z^9 \): 1
- \( z^8 \): (-1 + 1) = 0
- \( z^7 \): (1 - 1) = 0
- \( z^6 \): (-1 + 1) = 0
- \( z^5 \): (1 - 1) = 0
- \( z^4 \): (-1 + 1) = 0
- \( z^3 \): (1 - 1) = 0
- \( z^2 \): (-1 + 1) = 0
- \( z \): (1 - 1) = 0
- Constant term: 1

So, all terms cancel except \( z^9 + 1 \). Therefore, indeed, \( (z + 1)(z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1) = z^9 + 1 \).

Therefore, \( z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 = \frac{z^9 + 1}{z + 1} \). So, the given polynomial is equal to \( \frac{z^9 + 1}{z + 1} \).

Therefore, the roots of the given polynomial are all the roots of \( z^9 + 1 = 0 \) except \( z = -1 \).

So, \( z^9 = -1 \) implies \( z = e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/9} \) for \( k = 0, 1, ..., 8 \). But since \( z = -1 \) is excluded, which corresponds to \( k = 4.5 \), but \( k \) must be integer, so \( k = 4 \) and \( k = 5 \) correspond to the same root? Wait, no.

Wait, actually, \( z = e^{i\pi} = -1 \), which is when \( \theta = \pi \). So, \( k = 4.5 \) would correspond to \( \theta = \pi + 2\pi*(4.5)/9 = \pi + \pi = 2\pi \), which is the same as \( \theta = 0 \). Wait, no, because \( e^{i\pi} = -1 \).

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the exponents.

Let me remember that \( z^9 = -1 \), which is \( e^{i\pi} \). So, \( z = e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/9} \), for \( k = 0, 1, ..., 8 \).

But if we include \( k = 4 \), we get \( z = e^{i(\pi + 8\pi)/9} = e^{i(9\pi)/9} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \). Similarly, \( k = 5 \) gives \( z = e^{i(\pi + 10\pi)/9} = e^{i(11\pi)/9} \), which is different.

Wait, but in the roots of \( z^9 + 1 = 0 \), all except \( z = -1 \) are roots of the given polynomial.

Therefore, the given polynomial has 8 roots, which are all the 9th roots of -1 except \( z = -1 \).

So, the roots are \( z = e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/9} \) for \( k = 0, 1, ..., 8 \), excluding \( k = 4.5 \), but since \( k \) must be integer, \( k = 4 \) gives \( z = -1 \), which is excluded, so we have 8 roots.

Therefore, the roots of the given polynomial are \( z = e^{i(\pi + 2\pi k)/9} \) for \( k = 0, 1, ..., 8 \) except \( k = 4 \).

Wait, but let me compute the angles for each root.

So, for each \( k \), the angle is \( \theta_k = \pi + \frac{2\pi k}{9} \).

So, for \( k = 0 \): \( \theta_0 = \pi \).

For \( k = 1 \): \( \theta_1 = \pi + 2\pi/9 \).

For \( k = 2 \): \( \theta_2 = \pi + 4\pi/9 \).

Similarly, up to \( k = 8 \): \( \theta_8 = \pi + 16\pi/9 \).

But wait, \( 16\pi/9 \) is greater than \( 2\pi \)? No, since \( 16\pi/9 ≈ 5.585 \), which is less than \( 2\pi ≈ 6.283 \). So, all angles are between \( \pi \) and \( \pi + 16\pi/9 \), which is less than \( 2\pi \).

Wait, but the roots are placed around the unit circle at angles \( \pi + 2\pi k /9 \) for \( k = 0, 1, ..., 8 \), except \( k = 4 \).

So, the angles are:

- \( k = 0 \): \( \pi \)
- \( k = 1 \): \( \pi + 2\pi/9 \)
- \( k = 2 \): \( \pi + 4\pi/9 \)
- \( k = 3 \): \( \pi + 6\pi/9 = \pi + 2\pi/3 \)
- \( k = 4 \): \( \pi + 8\pi/9 \) (excluded)
- \( k = 5 \): \( \pi + 10\pi/9 \)
- \( k = 6 \): \( \pi + 12\pi/9 = \pi + 4\pi/3 \)
- \( k = 7 \): \( \pi + 14\pi/9 \)
- \( k = 8 \): \( \pi + 16\pi/9 \)

So, we have 8 roots, each at angles \( \pi + 2\pi k /9 \) for \( k = 0, 1, ..., 8 \) except \( k = 4 \).

Now, the problem states that \( r > 0 \) and \( 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi \). So, all roots are in the upper half-plane (since angles are between \( \pi \) and \( \pi + 16\pi/9 \), which is less than \( 2\pi \), so all angles are in \( [\pi, 2\pi) \). So, all roots are in the left half-plane (except when the angle is exactly \( \pi \), which is on the negative real axis).

But we need to find the sum of all possible values of \( \theta \). So, we need to compute \( \sum_{k=0, k \neq 4}^{8} \theta_k \).

So, the sum is \( \sum_{k=0}^{8} \theta_k - \theta_4 \).

But what is \( \sum_{k=0}^{8} \theta_k \)?

The angles are \( \theta_k = \pi + \frac{2\pi k}{9} \) for \( k = 0, 1, ..., 8 \).

Therefore, the sum is \( \sum_{k=0}^{8} \pi + \sum_{k=0}^{8} \frac{2\pi k}{9} \).

Compute each part:

First sum: \( \sum_{k=0}^{8} \pi = 9\pi \).

Second sum: \( \sum_{k=0}^{8} \frac{2\pi k}{9} = \frac{2\pi}{9} \sum_{k=0}^{8} k \).

The sum \( \sum_{k=0}^{8} k = \frac{8(8 + 1)}{2} = 36 \).

So, second sum is \( \frac{2\pi}{9} \times 36 = 8\pi \).

Therefore, total sum \( \sum_{k=0}^{8} \theta_k = 9\pi + 8\pi = 17\pi \).

But we have to subtract \( \theta_4 \), which is the excluded angle.

\( \theta_4 = \pi + \frac{2\pi \times 4}{9} = \pi + \frac{8\pi}{9} = \frac{17\pi}{9} \).

Therefore, the desired sum is \( 17\pi - \frac{17\pi}{9} = \frac{153\pi}{9} - \frac{17\pi}{9} = \frac{136\pi}{9} \).

So, the sum of all possible values of \( \theta \) is \( \frac{136\pi}{9} \).

Wait, but let me check if that makes sense. The angles are symmetrically distributed around the circle, except for the excluded angle. So, perhaps the sum can be found by considering the roots of the given polynomial, which are all 9th roots of -1 except \( z = -1 \).

But the given polynomial is \( \frac{z^9 + 1}{z + 1} \), so its roots are the 9th roots of -1, excluding \( z = -1 \).

So, how are the angles distributed?

Each 9th root of -1 is spaced at \( \frac{2\pi}{9} \) radians apart, starting from angle \( \pi \). So, the angles are \( \pi, \pi + \frac{2\pi}{9}, \pi + \frac{4\pi}{9}, \dots, \pi + \frac{16\pi}{9} \).

So, in terms of the unit circle, these are points in the left half-plane, except for the one at angle \( \pi \).

Therefore, the angles are symmetric in some way? Hmm, not exactly, since they're not symmetric around the real axis, but they are symmetric in the sense that they're equally spaced every \( \frac{2\pi}{9} \) radians, except for the excluded one.

But in any case, the sum of all angles is 17π, as computed earlier, and subtracting the excluded angle gives 136π/9, which is approximately 15.11π, which is less than 2π times 8, so that seems plausible.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Compute the sum \( \sum_{k=0}^{8} \theta_k \):

Each \( \theta_k = \pi + \frac{2\pi k}{9} \).

So, sum is \( 9\pi + \frac{2\pi}{9} \times \sum_{k=0}^{8} k \).

Sum from k=0 to 8 of k is 36, so:

9π + (2π/9)(36) = 9π + 8π = 17π.

Subtract the excluded angle \( \theta_4 = \pi + \frac{8\pi}{9} = \frac{17\pi}{9} \).

So, 17π - 17π/9 = (153π - 17π)/9 = 136π/9.

So, the sum is 136π/9.

Wait, but 136 divided by 9 is approximately 15.11, which is more than 2π (which is about 6.28). So, that seems okay, because the angles are spread out across the circle.

Therefore, the sum of all the angles is 136π/9.

But let me think if there's another way to compute this sum, maybe using symmetry or roots of unity.

Since the roots are symmetrically placed, except for one excluded root, perhaps the sum can be found by considering the roots as roots of the polynomial \( z^9 + 1 \) excluding \( z = -1 \).

But the sum of all the roots of the polynomial \( z^9 + 1 \) is zero, because the coefficient of \( z^8 \) is zero. However, our polynomial is \( \frac{z^9 + 1}{z + 1} \), which is a degree 8 polynomial.

But the sum of the roots of \( z^9 + 1 \) is zero, so the sum of the roots of \( \frac{z^9 + 1}{z + 1} \) is also zero, because we're excluding \( z = -1 \). But in our case, the given polynomial is \( \frac{z^9 + 1}{z + 1} \), so its roots are the 9th roots of -1 except \( z = -1 \). So, the sum of the roots is the sum of all the roots of \( z^9 + 1 \) except \( z = -1 \).

But the sum of all roots of \( z^9 + 1 \) is zero, as the coefficient of \( z^8 \) is zero. So, the sum of the roots of \( \frac{z^9 + 1}{z + 1} \) is zero, because we're excluding \( z = -1 \), which is a root of \( z^9 + 1 \).

Wait, actually, the sum of the roots of \( z^9 + 1 \) is zero, so the sum of the roots of \( \frac{z^9 + 1}{z + 1} \) is also zero, because it's a polynomial with the same roots except \( z = -1 \), which is excluded. Therefore, sum of roots (excluding \( z = -1 \)) is equal to the sum of all roots of \( z^9 + 1 \) minus \( z = -1 \).

But the sum of all roots of \( z^9 + 1 \) is zero, so the sum of the roots of \( \frac{z^9 + 1}{z + 1} \) is \( 0 - (-1) = 1 \). Wait, that doesn't make sense because earlier we found it to be \( 17\pi \). Hmm, perhaps this approach is not correct because we are considering sums of angles, not sums of roots.

Therefore, maybe the approach of using the sum of roots as zero is not directly applicable here because we are dealing with angles, not roots. So, perhaps the previous method is more straightforward.

Therefore, the sum is indeed \( 136\pi/9 \).

But let me see if that can be simplified.

136 divided by 9: 9*15=135, so 136=15*9 +1, so 136/9=15 + 1/9.

Wait, 136π/9 is equal to 15π + π/9.

But 15π is 7.5*2π, so it's equivalent to 7.5 full circles, which is more than 2π, but we can represent it as 15π + π/9, but I think 136π/9 is fine.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write 136π/9 as 15π + π/9, but 15π is more than 2π, so it's equivalent to π/9 in terms of angle, but since we have 8 roots, each at different angles, adding up to 136π/9.

Wait, but maybe 136 is divisible by something? Let me check.

136 divided by 8 is 17. So, 136 = 8*17, so 136π/9 = (8*17)π/9.

But I don't think that's particularly helpful.

Alternatively, since 136 and 9 are both divisible by... Let me see:

136: factors are 2*2*2*17

9: 3*3

So, no common factors besides 1. So, 136π/9 is the simplest form.

So, the sum is 136π/9.

Wait, but let me think again: is there another way to compute the sum of angles, perhaps using symmetry?

Given that the roots are symmetrically placed around the unit circle, except for the excluded one. So, if we have 8 roots, each spaced at 2π/9 apart, starting from π.

So, the angles are symmetric with respect to the real axis, except for the excluded angle at π + 8π/9 = 17π/9, which is in the third quadrant.

Wait, so the roots are at angles π, π + 2π/9, π + 4π/9, ..., π + 16π/9.

So, the angles are symmetric around π, except that the first root is at π, and the rest are symmetrically placed around it.

So, if I pair each root with its mirror image across the angle π, except for the angle π itself.

So, the roots can be paired as:

- π + 2πk/9

and

- π + 2π(9 - k)/9 = π + 2π - 2πk/9 = 3π - 2πk/9.

Wait, but 3π - 2πk/9 = π + 2π(3 - k)/9.

Wait, this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the angles as being symmetric around the point π.

Each root at angle θ has a corresponding root at angle 2π - θ.

But in our case, the roots are all on the left half-plane (θ < π), so 2π - θ would be on the right half-plane, which are not included.

Therefore, maybe the sum can be thought of as the sum of all angles in one half-plane, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, since all angles are symmetric except for the one at π, perhaps the sum can be calculated by considering that each pair of roots adds up to something.

Wait, for each root at θ and θ', their sum is 2 cos θ or something?

Wait, actually, no, because each root is a complex number, not a real number. So, the sum of the roots is a complex number, but we are only concerned with their angles.

Therefore, perhaps it's not helpful.

Alternatively, since the angles are symmetrically placed, the sum could be found by considering their positions on the circle.

But the main approach I did earlier, computing the sum of the angles, is probably the most straightforward.

I think I've double-checked enough, so I can be confident that the sum is 136π/9.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{\dfrac{136\pi}{9}} \).

Given the polynomial
\[ z^8 - z^7 + z^6 - z^5 + z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1 = 0, \]
we need to find the sum of all possible values of \( \theta \) for each root \( re^{i\theta} \) where \( r > 0 \) and \( 0 \le \theta < 2\pi \).

First, we recognize that the polynomial can be written as
\[ \frac{1 - (-z)^9}{1 + z} = 0, \]
which implies that \( (-z)^9 = 1 \). Therefore, \( -z \) is a 9th root of unity, meaning \( z \) is a 18th root of unity. The roots of the polynomial are the 18th roots of unity excluding \( z = -1 \).

The 18th roots of unity are given by \( e^{i\frac{2\pi k}{18}} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 17 \). Excluding \( z = -1 \) (which corresponds to \( k = 9 \)), the roots are \( e^{i\frac{2\pi k}{18}} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 8 \) and \( k = 10, 11, \ldots, 17 \).

Each root can be written as \( e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta = \pi + \frac{2\pi k}{9} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 8 \), excluding \( k = 4 \) (which corresponds to \( \theta = \pi \)).

The angles \( \theta \) for the roots are:
- \( \theta_0 = \pi + \frac{2\pi \cdot 0}{9} = \pi \)
- \( \theta_1 = \pi + \frac{2\pi \cdot 1}{9} \)
- \( \theta_2 = \pi + \frac{2\pi \cdot 2}{9} \)
- \( \theta_3 = \pi + \frac{2\pi \cdot 3}{9} \)
- \( \theta_4 = \pi + \frac{2\pi \cdot 4}{9} \) (excluded)
- \( \theta_5 = \pi + \frac{2\pi \cdot 5}{9} \)
- \( \theta_6 = \pi + \frac{2\pi \cdot 6}{9} \)
- \( \theta_7 = \pi + \frac{2\pi \cdot 7}{9} \)
- \( \theta_8 = \pi + \frac{2\pi \cdot 8}{9} \)

The sum of all angles \( \theta \) is calculated as follows:
- The sum of the angles \( \pi + \frac{2\pi k}{9} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 8 \) is \( 9\pi + 8\pi = 17\pi \).
- Subtracting the excluded angle \( \theta_4 = \pi + \frac{8\pi}{9} = \frac{17\pi}{9} \), the sum becomes \( 17\pi - \frac{17\pi}{9} = \frac{136\pi}{9} \).

Thus, the sum of all possible values of \( \theta \) is \( \boxed{\dfrac{136\pi}{9}} \).
