Question:
How many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of $629_{10}$? For example, $121_{3}$ and $413_{5}$ would have one digit in common.

Correct Answer:
First, let us convert $629_{10}$ to each of the two bases. To convert to base 7, we realize $7^{4}>629_{10}>7^{3}$. So, we can tell that $629_{10}$ in base seven will have four digits. $7^{3}=343$, which can go into 629 only one time at most, leaving $629-1\cdot343 = 286$ for the next three digits. $7^{2}=49$ goes into 286 five times at most, leaving us with $286-5\cdot49 = 41$. Then, $7^{1}=7$ goes into 41 five times at most, leaving $41-5\cdot7 = 6$ for the ones digit. All together, the base seven equivalent of $629_{10}$ is $1556_{7}$.

To convert to base 8, we realize similarly that $8^{4}>629_{10}>8^{3}$. So, we can tell that $629_{10}$ in base eight will have four digits. $8^{3}=512$, which can go into 629 only one time at most, leaving $629-1\cdot512 = 117$ for the next three digits. $8^{2}=64$ goes into 117 one time at most, leaving us with $117-1\cdot64 = 53$. Then, $8^{1}=8$ goes into 53 six times at most, leaving $53-6\cdot8 = 5$ for the ones digit. All together, the base eight equivalent of $629_{10}$ is $1165_{8}$.

Finally, comparing $1556_{7}$ and $1165_{8}$, we find that digits 1, 5, and 6 are present in both numbers.  Thus, there are $\boxed{3}$ digits in common.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find how many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the number 629 in decimal. Hmm, let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand what's being asked.

First, I know that 629 is a decimal number, and I need to convert it into base 7 and base 8. Once I have both representations, I can compare digit by digit and count how many digits are the same. Got it.

Let me start by converting 629 from base 10 to base 7. I remember that to convert a decimal number to another base, I can use the division method where I divide the number by the base and keep track of the remainders. The remainders become the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit.

So, for base 7:

First, divide 629 by 7. Let me calculate that.

629 ÷ 7. Hmm, 7 goes into 629 how many times? Well, 7*89 is 623, which is just 6 less than 629. So that means 629 = 7*89 + 6. So the remainder is 6. That's the first digit (rightmost digit) in base 7.

Now, I take the quotient, which is 89, and divide that by 7 again.

89 ÷ 7. 7 goes into 89 twelve times because 7*12 is 84, with a remainder of 5. So, remainder is 5, next digit.

Now, take the new quotient, which is 12, and divide by 7.

12 ÷ 7 is 1 with a remainder of 5. So, another 5, next digit.

Continue with quotient 1. Now, 1 ÷ 7 is 0 with a remainder of 1. So, the last digit is 1.

Putting it all together, the remainders, from last to first, are 1, 5, 5, 6. So, 629 in base 7 is 1556 base 7.

Wait, let me confirm that because sometimes it's easy to mix up the remainders.

So, 629 divided by 7 is 89 with remainder 6. Then 89 divided by 7 is 12 with remainder 5. Then 12 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 5. Then 1 divided by 7 is 0 with remainder 1. So, reading the remainders from last to first: 1, 5, 5, 6. So yes, 1556 base 7. That seems right.

Now, let me convert 629 to base 8. I'll use the same division method.

629 ÷ 8. 8*78 is 624, which is 5 less than 629. So, remainder is 5. That's the first digit (rightmost).

Take the quotient 78 and divide by 8.

78 ÷ 8 is 9 with a remainder of 6. So, remainder 6, next digit.

Divide 9 by 8. It goes once with a remainder of 1. So, next digit is 1.

Now, quotient 1. 1 ÷ 8 is 0 with remainder 1. So, last digit is 1.

So, reading the remainders from last to first: 1, 1, 6, 5. So, 629 in base 8 is 1165 base 8.

Let me double-check that.

629 divided by 8 is 78 with remainder 5. 78 ÷ 8 is 9 with remainder 6. 9 ÷ 8 is 1 with remainder 1. 1 ÷ 8 is 0 with remainder 1. So, digits are 1,1,6,5. Yep, that's correct.

So now I have both base 7 and base 8 representations:

- Base 7: 1556
- Base 8: 1165

Now, I need to compare these two numbers digit by digit and count how many digits are the same.

Let me write them down with corresponding positions:

Base 7: 1 (4th position), 5 (3rd position), 5 (2nd position), 6 (1st position)
Base 8: 1 (4th position), 1 (3rd position), 6 (2nd position), 5 (1st position)

So, the digits in each position are:

1. Base 7: 1
   Base 8: 1

2. Base 7: 5
   Base 8: 1

3. Base 7: 5
   Base 8: 6

4. Base 7: 6
   Base 8: 5

So, let's compare each position:

1st position (units place): both have 1. That's a match.

2nd position: base 7 has 5, base 8 has 6. Not a match.

3rd position: base 7 has 5, base 8 has 1. Not a match.

4th position: both have 6. That's another match.

So, in total, how many matches are there? In the first and the last positions. So that's two matches.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, base 7: 1556, base 8: 1165.

Comparing digit by digit:

- First digit (from the right): both have 1. So that's one match.

- Second digit: 5 vs 6. Not a match.

- Third digit: 5 vs 1. Not a match.

- Fourth digit: 6 vs 5. Not a match.

So, only two digits are same: one in the units place and one in the 4th position.

Therefore, the number of same digits is 2.

Wait, hold on, 629 in base 7 is 1556, which is 1*7^3 + 5*7^2 + 5*7^1 + 6*7^0.

And 629 in base 8 is 1165, which is 1*8^3 + 1*8^2 + 6*8^1 + 5*8^0.

So, let me list both numbers:

Base 7: 1 5 5 6

Base 8: 1 1 6 5

Comparing each digit:

1. Position 1 (rightmost): 1 vs 5. Different.

2. Position 2: 5 vs 6. Different.

3. Position 3: 5 vs 1. Different.

4. Position 4: 6 vs 5. Different.

Wait, wait, hold on. I think I might have confused the positions earlier.

Wait, in base 7, the digits are 1 (thousands place), 5 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 6 (units). Similarly, in base 8, digits are 1 (thousands), 1 (hundreds), 6 (tens), 5 (units). So, when comparing, the positions are:

- Units place: 6 vs 5

- Tens place: 5 vs 6

- Hundreds place: 5 vs 1

- Thousands place: 1 vs 1

So, in the units place, 6 vs 5. Different.

In the tens place, 5 vs 6. Different.

In the hundreds place, 5 vs 1. Different.

In the thousands place, 1 vs 1. Same.

So, only one digit is the same: the leading digit '1' in both.

But wait, earlier I thought of the digits from right to left as positions 1 to 4, but that might be a confusion.

Wait, actually, when we write numbers, the rightmost digit is position 1, then next is 2, etc. So in base 7: 1 5 5 6. So units (1), tens (2), hundreds (3), thousands (4).

Similarly, base 8: 1 1 6 5. So units (1), tens (2), hundreds (3), thousands (4).

So, when comparing:

- Units place: 6 vs 5: different

- Tens place: 5 vs 6: different

- Hundreds place: 5 vs 1: different

- Thousands place: 1 vs 1: same.

So, only one digit is the same. Therefore, the answer is 1.

But hold on, wait, let me verify my initial thought. When I converted 629 to base 7, I got 1556, which is 1*343 + 5*49 + 5*7 + 6. Let's check:

343 + 245 + 35 + 6 = 343 + 245 is 588, plus 35 is 623, plus 6 is 629. Correct.

In base 8: 1165 is 1*512 + 1*64 + 6*8 + 5. Let's compute:

512 + 64 is 576, plus 48 is 624, plus 5 is 629. Correct.

So, both conversions are correct.

Now, let me think about the digits:

Base 7: 1 5 5 6

Base 8: 1 1 6 5

So, in the same positions:

- Position 1 (units): 6 vs 5

- Position 2 (tens): 5 vs 6

- Position 3 (hundreds): 5 vs 1

- Position 4 (thousands): 1 vs 1

So, only in the thousands place, both have 1. So, only one digit is the same.

But wait, hold on, is the thousands place the same digit? Yes, both have 1, so that's one.

But wait, hold on, let me think again.

Wait, if I write it as:

Base 7: 1 (thousands) 5 (hundreds) 5 (tens) 6 (units)

Base 8: 1 (thousands) 1 (hundreds) 6 (tens) 5 (units)

Comparing each digit:

Thousands: 1 vs 1: same

Hundreds: 5 vs 1: different

Tens: 5 vs 6: different

Units: 6 vs 5: different

So, only one digit is same.

Wait, but in the hundreds place, base 7 is 5 and base 8 is 1. Different.

In the tens place, base 7 is 5, base 8 is 6. Different.

In the units place, base 7 is 6, base 8 is 5. Different.

So, only the thousands place is same. So, only one digit.

But wait, the problem says "the same digits", so each digit that is same counts as one. So, even if two digits were same, like two digits are same, it's two. So, in this case, only one.

But, wait, let me check the problem again.

"How many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of 629_{10}? For example, 121_{3} and 413_{5} would have one digit in common."

Wait, that example: 121 base 3 and 413 base 5. So, let me see:

121 in base 3: 1*9 + 2*3 + 1 = 9 + 6 +1 =16.

413 in base 5:4*25 +1*5 +3=100 +5 +3=108. Wait, but 16 is not equal to 108. Wait, the example says 121 and 413 would have one digit in common. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, wait, maybe they mean the digits that are same, regardless of their position, but in the example, 121 and 413. In base 3, the digits are 1,2,1. In base 5, the digits are 4,1,3. So, how many digits are common? 1 appears in both, but in base 3, it's in the hundreds and units place, and in base 5, it's in the hundreds and tens place. So, does that count as two digits? But the example says one digit in common. Hmm, maybe the digits have to be in the same order?

Wait, no, the example says "for example, 121_{3} and 413_{5} would have one digit in common." So, they might be considering the same digit in the same position. But in this case, 121 has 1 in the hundreds place and 1 in the units place, while 413 has 4 in the hundreds place, 1 in the tens place, and 3 in the units place. So, the digit 1 is in the hundreds place in 121 and in the tens place in 413. So, if we're only considering exact same digit in the same position, they don't match. Similarly, 2 in base 3 vs 1 in base 5, and 1 in base 3 vs 3 in base 5. So, no digits are the same in the same position. So, the example is maybe a bit confusing, or perhaps they consider the number of digits that are the same regardless of position? But that would be two digits, 1 and 2 in 121, and 1 and 3 in 413. But 1 appears twice, but only once in each.

Wait, maybe the example is not meant to be taken literally, or perhaps it's a different context.

But perhaps, in the problem, they just want the number of digits that appear in the same position in both representations.

In that case, in base 7 and base 8, looking at each digit, regardless of position.

So, in base 7: 1 5 5 6.

In base 8: 1 1 6 5.

Comparing each digit:

1: same in both.

5: different.

5: different.

6: different.

Similarly, in base 8, 1 is same, but others are different.

Wait, so only one digit is same in the same position.

Wait, but 6 is in base 7 and 5 in base 8, different.

So, only one digit is same.

But wait, base 7 has 1, which is same as base 8's 1.

So, is that considered one digit? Or are they considering the count of digits that are present in both representations, irrespective of position?

Wait, the problem says "how many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations".

So, it's about the number of digits that are same in both representations. So, if a digit appears in both, but not necessarily in the same position, how many digits are same.

Wait, that would be a different interpretation. For instance, if both numbers have the digit '5' in either position, that would count as one digit. If both have '5' in the same position, that would count as two digits. But in this case, the digits are different.

Wait, in base 7: 1,5,5,6.

In base 8: 1,1,6,5.

So, looking at the digits:

- 1 appears twice, once in each number.

- 5 appears twice, once in each.

- 6 appears once in each.

So, perhaps, the count is the number of digits that are present in both numbers, regardless of position. So, digits are 1,5,6.

So, 1 appears twice, but only once as a digit. Similarly, 5 appears twice, but once. 6 appears once. So, in total, three digits are present in both numbers.

But in the example, 121 and 413, which have digits 1,2,1 and 4,1,3. So, the digits in common are 1 and 1, but in different positions. So, how many digits are common, considering multiplicity? It's two digits, but in different positions.

But in the example, they said one digit in common. So maybe they are considering the number of digits that are present in both representations, regardless of position, but without considering multiplicity.

Wait, but in the example, 121 has digits 1,2,1, and 413 has digits 4,1,3. So, the digits common are 1 and 1, but in different positions, so two digits. But the example says one digit.

Hmm, perhaps the example is just saying one digit in common, but they might have meant that if a digit is present in both, regardless of position, it's considered as one.

But that seems ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe it's just the number of digits that are same in the same place, which is one.

But in the problem statement, the example is given as 121 and 413, which have one digit in common. But in reality, they have two digits: 1 and 1, but in different positions. So, maybe the example is misleading or perhaps it's a translation issue.

Wait, perhaps the example is just a simple case where the digits are in different positions but the same digit is present.

Alternatively, maybe the example is just trying to explain the concept, but the actual problem is asking for the number of digits that are present in both numbers, regardless of position.

Wait, but in that case, 121 and 413 have two digits in common, but in different positions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the number of digits that are in the same position in both representations.

So, in that case, in base 7: 1 5 5 6.

In base 8: 1 1 6 5.

So, comparing each digit:

- Position 1: 1 vs 1: same.

- Position 2: 5 vs 1: different.

- Position 3: 5 vs 6: different.

- Position 4: 6 vs 5: different.

So, only one digit is same in the same position.

But if we consider the number of digits that are present in both, regardless of position, then digits are 1,5,6.

So, 1 appears twice, 5 appears twice, 6 appears once.

But in terms of count, 1,5,6. So, in base 7 and base 8, the digits present are 1,5,6.

So, how many digits are same. But the count is based on the digits that are present in both.

But in the example, 121 and 413, the digits present are 1,2,4,3. So, one digit in common.

Wait, but in this case, in both numbers, digits 1,5,6 are present, so three digits in common.

But in the example, only one digit is considered common.

This is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking how many digits are the same in both representations, regardless of their position.

So, how many digits are present in both base 7 and base 8 representations.

In that case, since both numbers have digits 1,5,6, three digits in common.

But in the example, 121 and 413 would have three digits in common, but the problem says one digit in common.

Wait, maybe the example is wrong or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.

Alternatively, maybe the example is just a simple case, and the problem is asking for the number of digits that are same in the same position, which is one.

But in that case, in the given problem, the answer is one.

But let me think again.

Wait, in base 7, 629 is 1556.

In base 8, 629 is 1165.

Looking at each digit:

1. Units place: 6 vs 5: different.

2. Tens place: 5 vs 6: different.

3. Hundreds place: 5 vs 1: different.

4. Thousands place: 1 vs 1: same.

So, only one digit is same in the same position.

So, the answer is 1.

But wait, in the example, 121 and 413 have two digits (1 and 1), but in different positions, so maybe the problem is asking for the number of digits that are present in both, regardless of position.

But in that case, the answer would be three digits: 1,5,6.

But the problem says "how many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations".

So, it's about the number of digits that are same in both representations, considering their positions.

So, in that case, only one digit is same in the same position.

So, I think the answer is 1.

But let me just make sure.

Wait, in base 7: 1 5 5 6.

In base 8: 1 1 6 5.

Comparing each digit:

1. Thousands place: 1 vs 1: same.

2. Hundreds place: 5 vs 1: different.

3. Tens place: 5 vs 6: different.

4. Units place: 6 vs 5: different.

So, only the thousands place is same.

Therefore, only one digit is same.

Therefore, the answer is 1.

But just to double-check, let me write down the digits:

Base 7: 1,5,5,6.

Base 8:1,1,6,5.

If I count how many times each digit appears in both:

1: appears once in each.

5: appears once in each.

6: appears once in each.

So, in terms of distinct digits, it's 1,5,6. So, three distinct digits are present in both representations.

But the problem is asking "how many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations".

So, perhaps it's asking for the count of digits that are present in both, regardless of position.

But then, since 1,5,6 are present in both, it's three digits.

But in the example, 121 and 413, which have digits 1,2,4,3, so only 1 is common. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the count of digits that are present in both, regardless of position.

But in the example, 121 and 413 are considered to have one digit in common, which is 1.

Wait, so perhaps, the problem expects the number of digits that are present in both, regardless of position.

In that case, since both numbers have three digits in common (1,5,6), the answer would be 3.

But the example is confusing.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

"How many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of 629_{10}? For example, 121_{3} and 413_{5} would have one digit in common."

Wait, 121 base 3 is 1*9 + 2*3 +1=16.

413 base 5 is 4*25 +1*5 +3=108.

So, 16 and 108. So, no digits in common.

But the problem says they have one digit in common. So, perhaps, it's about the number of digits that are present in both representations, regardless of position.

But in that case, 121 base3 and 413 base5 have only one digit in common? Wait, 121 has 1,2,1. 413 has 4,1,3. So, digits present in both are 1 in both, but 121 has two 1s and 413 has one 1. So, how many digits are same? They have one digit in common, 1.

So, in this case, it's about the number of digits that are present in both, regardless of position.

So, in that sense, the answer is 1.

So, in the problem, 121 and 413 have one digit in common, which is 1.

Similarly, in 629's base7 and base8, how many digits are present in both? So, in base7:1,5,5,6 and base8:1,1,6,5.

So, digits present in both are 1,5,6.

So, three digits are present in both representations.

But in the example, 121 and 413, they have only one digit in common.

So, perhaps the problem is expecting the number of digits that are present in both representations, regardless of position.

So, in that case, 1,5,6 are present in both, so three digits.

But the example is given as 121 and 413, which have one digit in common.

Wait, but 121 is 1,2,1, and 413 is 4,1,3.

So, in terms of digits, 1 is present in both, but 2 and 4, 3 are only in one. So, how many digits are same?

It's one digit, 1.

So, perhaps, the problem is expecting the number of digits that are same in both, considering multiplicity.

But in that case, in base7 and base8, 1 appears twice, but only once as a digit. Similarly, 5 appears twice, once as a digit.

So, in terms of unique digits, three digits:1,5,6.

But in the example, it's just one digit.

So, perhaps, the problem is expecting the number of digits that are present in both, regardless of position.

So, in that case, three digits.

But the example is given as 121 and 413, which would have one digit in common.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the number of digits in the same position.

So, in base7, 629 is 1 5 5 6.

In base8, 629 is 1 1 6 5.

So, comparing each digit:

- Position 1:1 vs1: same.

- Position2:5 vs1: different.

- Position3:5 vs6: different.

- Position4:6 vs5: different.

So, only one digit is same.

Therefore, the answer is 1.

Therefore, I think the answer is 1.

Hence, the number of same digits in the base7 and base8 representations of 629_{10} is 1.

**Final Answer**
The number of same digits is \boxed{1}.
</think>

To determine how many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we need to convert 629 from decimal to both base 7 and base 8, and then compare the digits.

First, we convert 629 to base 7:
1. Divide 629 by 7: quotient 89, remainder 6.
2. Divide 89 by 7: quotient 12, remainder 5.
3. Divide 12 by 7: quotient 1, remainder 5.
4. Divide 1 by 7: quotient 0, remainder 1.

Thus, the base 7 representation is \(1556_7\).

Next, we convert 629 to base 8:
1. Divide 629 by 8: quotient 78, remainder 5.
2. Divide 78 by 8: quotient 9, remainder 6.
3. Divide 9 by 8: quotient 1, remainder 1.
4. Divide 1 by 8: quotient 0, remainder 1.

Thus, the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\).

Now, we compare the digits of \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\):
- Base 7: 1, 5, 5, 6
- Base 8: 1, 1, 6, 5

Comparing each digit:
- Units place (rightmost): 6 vs 5 (different)
- Tens place: 5 vs 6 (different)
- Hundreds place: 5 vs 1 (different)
- Thousands place: 1 vs 1 (same)

Only the thousands place digits are the same. Therefore, the number of same digits is 1.

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
