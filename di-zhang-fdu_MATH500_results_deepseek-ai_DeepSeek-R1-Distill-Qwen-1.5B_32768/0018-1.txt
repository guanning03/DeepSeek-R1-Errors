Question:
Given that \begin{align*}x_{1}&=211,\\ x_{2}&=375,\\ x_{3}&=420,\\ x_{4}&=523,\ \text{and}\\ x_{n}&=x_{n-1}-x_{n-2}+x_{n-3}-x_{n-4}\ \text{when}\ n\geq5, \end{align*}find the value of $x_{531}+x_{753}+x_{975}$.

Correct Answer:
Shifting the recurrence over by one and adding, we have: \[\begin{aligned} x_n &= x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \\ x_{n-1} &= x_{n-2} - x_{n-3} + x_{n-4} - x_{n-5} \\ \implies x_n + x_{n-1} &= x_{n-1} - x_{n-5} \end{aligned}\]so $x_n = -x_{n-5}$ for all $n.$ In particular, $x_n = -x_{n-5} = -(-x_{n-10}) = x_{n-10},$ so the sequence repeats with period $10.$ Thus, \[\begin{aligned} x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} &= x_1 + x_3 + x_5 \\ &= x_1 + x_3 + (x_4-x_3+x_2-x_1) \\ &= x_2 + x_4 \\ &= 375 + 523 = \boxed{898}. \end{aligned}\]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a sequence defined by \( x_1 = 211 \), \( x_2 = 375 \), \( x_3 = 420 \), \( x_4 = 523 \), and for \( n \geq 5 \), each term is defined by the recurrence relation \( x_n = x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \). I need to find the value of \( x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} \).

Alright, let me think about how to approach this. The sequence is defined recursively, which means each term depends on the previous four terms. Since the problem is asking for specific terms far out in the sequence (like 531, 753, 975), computing them directly by hand isn't feasible. There must be a pattern or some periodicity in the sequence that I can exploit.

First, let's try to compute the first few terms to see if there's a repeating cycle or a pattern. Maybe the sequence becomes periodic after a certain point.

Given:

\( x_1 = 211 \)

\( x_2 = 375 \)

\( x_3 = 420 \)

\( x_4 = 523 \)

Now, let's compute \( x_5 \):

\( x_5 = x_4 - x_3 + x_2 - x_1 \)

Plugging in the numbers:

\( x_5 = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211 \)

Calculating that:

First, 523 - 420 = 103

Then, 103 + 375 = 478

Then, 478 - 211 = 267

So, \( x_5 = 267 \)

Next, \( x_6 \):

\( x_6 = x_5 - x_4 + x_3 - x_2 \)

Plugging in:

\( x_6 = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375 \)

Calculating step by step:

267 - 523 = -256

-256 + 420 = 164

164 - 375 = -211

So, \( x_6 = -211 \)

Moving on to \( x_7 \):

\( x_7 = x_6 - x_5 + x_4 - x_3 \)

Plugging in:

\( x_7 = (-211) - 267 + 523 - 420 \)

Calculating:

-211 - 267 = -478

-478 + 523 = 45

45 - 420 = -375

So, \( x_7 = -375 \)

Now, \( x_8 \):

\( x_8 = x_7 - x_6 + x_5 - x_4 \)

Plugging in:

\( x_8 = (-375) - (-211) + 267 - 523 \)

Simplify:

-375 + 211 = -164

-164 + 267 = 103

103 - 523 = -420

So, \( x_8 = -420 \)

Hmm, interesting. Let's compute \( x_9 \):

\( x_9 = x_8 - x_7 + x_6 - x_5 \)

Plugging in:

\( x_9 = (-420) - (-375) + (-211) - 267 \)

Calculating:

-420 + 375 = -45

-45 - 211 = -256

-256 - 267 = -523

So, \( x_9 = -523 \)

Continuing, \( x_{10} \):

\( x_{10} = x_9 - x_8 + x_7 - x_6 \)

Plugging in:

\( x_{10} = (-523) - (-420) + (-375) - (-211) \)

Simplify:

-523 + 420 = -103

-103 - 375 = -478

-478 + 211 = -267

So, \( x_{10} = -267 \)

Wait a minute, \( x_{10} = -267 \), which was equal to \( x_5 \). Let's check \( x_{11} \):

\( x_{11} = x_{10} - x_9 + x_8 - x_7 \)

Plugging in:

\( x_{11} = (-267) - (-523) + (-420) - (-375) \)

Calculating:

-267 + 523 = 256

256 - 420 = -164

-164 + 375 = 211

So, \( x_{11} = 211 \), which is equal to \( x_1 \). Hmm, this looks promising.

Let me list out the terms so far:

n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

x_n:211, 375, 420, 523, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211

Interesting, so at n=11, we get back to 211, which was x_1. Let's see if the next term repeats the previous one as well. I'll compute \( x_{12} \):

\( x_{12} = x_{11} - x_{10} + x_9 - x_8 \)

Plugging in:

\( x_{12} = 211 - (-267) + (-523) - (-420) \)

Simplify:

211 + 267 = 478

478 - 523 = -45

-45 + 420 = 375

So, \( x_{12} = 375 \), which is equal to \( x_2 \). Wow, this is a cycle!

Let me continue to check the next few terms to see if the cycle continues.

\( x_{13} = x_{12} - x_{11} + x_{10} - x_9 \)

Plugging in:

375 - 211 + (-267) - (-523)

Calculating:

375 - 211 = 164

164 - 267 = -103

-103 + 523 = 420

So, \( x_{13} = 420 \), which is \( x_3 \).

\( x_{14} = x_{13} - x_{12} + x_{11} - x_{10} \)

Plugging in:

420 - 375 + 211 - (-267)

Calculating:

420 - 375 = 45

45 + 211 = 256

256 + 267 = 523

So, \( x_{14} = 523 \), which is \( x_4 \).

\( x_{15} = x_{14} - x_{13} + x_{12} - x_{11} \)

Plugging in:

523 - 420 + 375 - 211

Calculating:

523 - 420 = 103

103 + 375 = 478

478 - 211 = 267

So, \( x_{15} = 267 \), which is \( x_5 \).

Hmm, this pattern is consistent. It seems that \( x_{n+11} = x_n \). So, every 11 terms, the sequence repeats. Therefore, the sequence is periodic with a period of 11.

Let me confirm this with \( x_{16} \):

\( x_{16} = x_{15} - x_{14} + x_{13} - x_{12} \)

Plug in:

267 - 523 + 420 - 375

Calculates to:

267 - 523 = -256

-256 + 420 = 164

164 - 375 = -211

Which is equal to \( x_6 \). So, the cycle continues.

Therefore, the sequence is periodic with period 11. That is, for all \( n \geq 1 \), \( x_{n+11} = x_n \).

Given that, I can use this periodicity to find \( x_{531} \), \( x_{753} \), and \( x_{975} \).

Since the sequence repeats every 11 terms, to find \( x_k \), I can compute \( k \) modulo 11, and then find the corresponding term in the first 11 terms.

But wait, let me check n=12: 12 mod 11 is 1, and \( x_{12} = x_1 \). Similarly, n=13: 13 mod 11 is 2, and \( x_{13} = x_2 \), etc.

Yes, that seems consistent.

So, for any integer \( k \), \( x_k = x_{(k \mod 11)} \). But I need to be careful with the modulus operation because:

- If \( k \mod 11 = 0 \), then \( k \) is a multiple of 11, so \( x_k = x_{11} \).

- Otherwise, \( k \mod 11 = r \), where \( r \) is from 1 to 10, so \( x_k = x_r \).

Therefore, I can compute each term as follows:

1. Compute \( 531 \mod 11 \)
2. Compute \( 753 \mod 11 \)
3. Compute \( 975 \mod 11 \)
4. Then, find the corresponding \( x \) value from the first 11 terms.

So, let's compute each modulus.

First, \( 531 \div 11 \). Let's compute 11*48 = 528, so 531 - 528 = 3.

Thus, \( 531 \mod 11 = 3 \). Therefore, \( x_{531} = x_3 = 420 \).

Next, \( 753 \div 11 \). Let's see, 11*68 = 748, so 753 - 748 = 5.

Thus, \( 753 \mod 11 = 5 \). Therefore, \( x_{753} = x_5 = 267 \).

Then, \( 975 \div 11 \). 11*88 = 968, so 975 - 968 = 7.

Thus, \( 975 \mod 11 = 7 \). Therefore, \( x_{975} = x_7 = -375 \).

Therefore, the sum \( x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = 420 + 267 + (-375) \).

Let me compute that:

420 + 267 = 687

687 - 375 = 312

So, the total is 312.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check the modulus calculations because sometimes it's easy to make an off-by-one error with modulus.

For \( 531 \mod 11 \):

11*48 = 528, 528 + 3 = 531, so yes, 531 mod 11 is 3.

For \( 753 \mod 11 \):

11*68 = 748, 748 +5=753, so 753 mod 11 is 5.

For \( 975 \mod 11 \):

11*88=968, 968 +7=975, so 975 mod 11 is 7.

So that seems correct.

And the corresponding x values:

x_3 = 420, x_5=267, x_7=-375.

So, adding them: 420 + 267 = 687, 687 - 375 = 312.

Therefore, the answer is 312.

But just to be thorough, let me verify whether the period is indeed 11 or if there could be a shorter period. Because sometimes, even if it seems like 11, it might have a smaller period.

So, let's check if the sequence repeats every 11 terms, but maybe with a smaller period.

Given the initial terms, we have x1 to x11 as 211, 375, 420, 523, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211.

So, x12 = x1, x13 = x2, etc. So, the cycle is indeed 11. So, the period is 11.

Therefore, I can confidently say that the sequence is periodic with period 11, so the terms repeat every 11 terms.

Hence, to find \( x_{531} \), \( x_{753} \), \( x_{975} \), we just compute their positions modulo 11 and refer to the first 11 terms.

Therefore, the final answer is 420 + 267 + (-375) = 312.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{312}
</think>

Given the sequence defined by:
\[
\begin{align*}
x_1 &= 211, \\
x_2 &= 375, \\
x_3 &= 420, \\
x_4 &= 523, \\
x_n &= x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \quad \text{for} \quad n \geq 5,
\end{align*}
\]
we need to find the value of \( x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} \).

First, we compute the initial terms to identify any periodicity. Calculating the first few terms, we find:
\[
\begin{align*}
x_5 &= 267, \\
x_6 &= -211, \\
x_7 &= -375, \\
x_8 &= -420, \\
x_9 &= -523, \\
x_{10} &= -267, \\
x_{11} &= 211, \\
x_{12} &= 375, \\
x_{13} &= 420, \\
x_{14} &= 523, \\
x_{15} &= 267.
\end{align*}
\]
We observe that \( x_{11} = x_1 \) and the sequence repeats every 11 terms. Thus, the sequence is periodic with period 11.

To find \( x_{531} \), \( x_{753} \), and \( x_{975} \), we compute their positions modulo 11:
\[
\begin{align*}
531 \mod 11 &= 3, \\
753 \mod 11 &= 5, \\
975 \mod 11 &= 7.
\end{align*}
\]
Thus, \( x_{531} = x_3 = 420 \), \( x_{753} = x_5 = 267 \), and \( x_{975} = x_7 = -375 \).

Summing these values:
\[
x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = 420 + 267 - 375 = 312.
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{312}
\]
