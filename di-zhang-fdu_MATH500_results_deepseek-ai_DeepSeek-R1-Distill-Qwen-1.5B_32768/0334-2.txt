Question:
A hexagon is inscribed in a circle: [asy]
pair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF, pO;
pO = (0, 0);
pA = pO + dir(-10);
pB = pO + dir(60);
pC = pO + dir(130);
pD = pO + dir(170);
pE = pO + dir(-160);
pF = pO + dir(-80);
draw(pA--pB--pC--pD--pE--pF--pA);
label("$105^\circ$", pF, N * 2);
label("$110^\circ$", pB, SW * 1.5);
label("$\alpha$", pD, E);
draw(circle(pO, 1));
[/asy] What is the measure of $\alpha$, in degrees?

Correct Answer:
Labeling our vertices will help a great deal, as will drawing a few radii: [asy]
pair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF, pO;
pO = (0, 0);
pA = pO + dir(-10);
pB = pO + dir(60);
pC = pO + dir(130);
pD = pO + dir(170);
pE = pO + dir(-160);
pF = pO + dir(-80);
draw(pA--pB--pC--pD--pE--pF--pA);
draw(pA--pO--pC--pO--pE--pO, red);
draw(circle(pO, 1));
label("$O$", pO, NE);
label("$A$", pA, E);
label("$B$", pB, NE);
label("$C$", pC, NW);
label("$D$", pD, W);
label("$E$", pE, SW);
label("$F$", pF, S);
label("$105^\circ$", pF, N * 2);
label("$110^\circ$", pB, SW * 1.5);
label("$\alpha$", pD, E);
[/asy] First of all, we see that $\angle ABC = 110^\circ$ must be half of the major arc ${AEC},$ thus arc ${AEC} = 2 \cdot \angle ABC.$ Then, the minor arc ${AC}$ must be $360^\circ - 2 \cdot \angle ABC = 360^\circ - 2 \cdot 110^\circ = 140^\circ.$

Likewise, the minor arc ${EA}$ must be $360^\circ - 2 \cdot \angle EFA = 360^\circ - 2 \cdot 105^\circ = 150^\circ,$ and the minor arc ${CE}$ is $360^\circ - 2 \alpha.$ Now, arc ${AC},$ ${CE},$ and ${EA}$ must add up to $360^\circ,$ which means that \begin{align*}
360^\circ &= (360^\circ - 2 \alpha) + 140^\circ + 150^\circ\\
360^\circ &= 650^\circ - 2\alpha\\
2\alpha &= 290^\circ\\
\alpha &= \boxed{145^\circ}.
\end{align*}

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hexagon inscribed in a circle. It's labeled with some angles, and I need to find the measure of angle α. Let me try to visualize this. The Asymptote code draws a circle with a hexagon inscribed in it, and there are some angles labeled: one is 105 degrees at point F, another is 110 degrees at point B, and angle α is somewhere else. I need to figure out what α is.

First, since it's a hexagon inscribed in a circle, that makes it a cyclic hexagon. I remember that in a cyclic polygon, all the vertices lie on the circumference of the circle, which means each side subtends an arc at the center. For a regular hexagon, all the sides and angles are equal, but in this case, it's not regular because the angles given are different. So, it must be an irregular cyclic hexagon.

I think the key here is to use the property of cyclic polygons. I remember that in a cyclic polygon, the sum of the measures of opposite angles is 180 degrees for quadrilaterals, but I'm not sure about hexagons. Maybe it's similar? Or maybe there's a different property. Wait, I think in cyclic polygons, the sum of every other angle is equal to half the sum of the other angles. Hmm, that sounds complicated. Maybe I should look at the arcs instead.

Since all the vertices are on the circle, each side corresponds to an arc. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, if I can find the measures of the arcs corresponding to the given angles, maybe I can find the remaining arcs and determine angle α.

Looking at the Asymptote code, the angles are labeled at specific points. The angle at point F is 105 degrees, which is labeled near the top, pointing north-south. The angle at point B is 110 degrees, which is on the left side, pointing southwest. The angle α is at point D, which is on the right side, pointing east. So, these points are spread around the circle, each at different positions.

Let me try to figure out the arcs corresponding to these angles. For an inscribed angle, the measure is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So, if I can figure out the intercepted arcs for each given angle, I can find the measure of those arcs.

Starting with angle F, which is 105 degrees. That angle intercepts an arc. Since it's an inscribed angle, the arc it intercepts is twice that, so 210 degrees. Similarly, angle B is 110 degrees, so the intercepted arc is 220 degrees.

Wait, but a circle is 360 degrees, so if I have two arcs already, 210 and 220, that's 430 degrees, which is more than 360. That can't be right. Maybe I misunderstood which arcs are intercepted. Perhaps the angle at F intercepts a smaller arc?

Wait, inscribed angles can intercept arcs that are either minor or major. The measure is still half the measure of the intercepted arc, but depending on which arc it intercepts, it could be the minor or major arc. So, maybe the angle at F intercepts a minor arc, which is 210 degrees, but that can't be because major arc would be 150 degrees, which is smaller. Hmm, wait, 210 is more than 180, so it's a major arc.

But since the angle is at point F, which is on the circle, the intercepted arc is the one that's opposite to that angle. For a triangle, the inscribed angle intercepts an arc opposite to it. For a polygon, it should intercept the arc that's not adjacent to the angle.

Wait, maybe I should think about the polygon. The hexagon is inscribed in the circle, so each side is a chord, and each angle is formed by two chords meeting at a point on the circumference.

So, for angle at point F, which is 105 degrees, it is formed by two chords: from F to E and from F to A. The intercepted arc would be the arc from E to A, not passing through F, right? Because the angle is formed by the two chords FE and FA.

Similarly, angle at point B is 110 degrees, formed by chords BF and BA. The intercepted arc is the arc from F to A that doesn't include B.

Wait, so maybe the intercepted arcs for these angles are the arcs opposite to the angles.

So, for angle F: 105 degrees, intercepts arc EA. So, arc EA is 210 degrees.

Similarly, angle B: 110 degrees, intercepts arc FA. So, arc FA is 220 degrees.

Wait, but hold on, arc EA is 210 degrees, and arc FA is 220 degrees. But the total circumference is 360, so adding these two arcs would be 430, which is more than 360. That must mean that these arcs overlap or something. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the intercepted arcs are the ones that are not adjacent to the angle. So, for angle F, which is at point F, the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to it. So, the arc from E to A, not passing through F. Similarly, for angle B, the intercepted arc is the one opposite to it, which is arc from F to A, not passing through B.

But in that case, arc EA is 210 degrees, and arc FA is 220 degrees. But how can these two arcs overlap? If I add them, I get 430, which is more than 360, so that suggests that these arcs are adjacent or overlapping. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe each angle intercepts two arcs, one minor and one major. So, for angle F, which is 105 degrees, the intercepted arc could be 210 degrees (major arc) or 105 degrees (minor arc). But in a cyclic polygon, the inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc, so if the angle is 105, the intercepted arc is 210.

Similarly, angle B is 110, so intercepted arc is 220. So, if I add up all these intercepted arcs: 210 + 220 + whatever else. Wait, but in a hexagon, each vertex has an angle, so each angle intercepts an arc. So, for a hexagon, there are six angles, each intercepting an arc. So, maybe the intercepted arcs are 210, 220, and then three more arcs each intercepting something.

Wait, but in a hexagon, each angle is between two sides, so each angle intercepts an arc opposite to it. So, for each angle, we have an intercepted arc. So, if we have six angles, each with an intercepted arc, the sum of all intercepted arcs should be 360 degrees. Because each intercepted arc is the arc opposite to the angle, and together, all intercepted arcs make up the whole circle.

Wait, that makes sense. So, for each angle, the intercepted arc is twice the angle. So, for angle F: 2*105 = 210 degrees. For angle B: 2*110 = 220 degrees. So, the intercepted arcs for these two angles are 210 and 220. Then, the intercepted arcs for the other four angles would be 360 - 210 - 220 = 30 degrees. Wait, but 210 + 220 is 430, which is larger than 360, so that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the intercepted arcs. Maybe the intercepted arcs for the angles are not the arcs opposite to the angles but the arcs that are intercepted by the sides. Let me think again.

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, each angle is formed by two chords, and the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to the angle, i.e., the arc that is not adjacent to the angle. So, for angle F, which is at point F, the intercepted arc is the one that's opposite to it, which is arc EA. Similarly, for angle B at point B, the intercepted arc is arc FA, which is the arc opposite to angle B. For angle C, it would be arc FD, and so on.

But in that case, each angle intercepts an arc, and these intercepted arcs are all around the circle, so their sum should be 360 degrees. So, if I have three angles given, each intercepting an arc, their intercepted arcs add up to 360 degrees. So, if angle F is 105, angle B is 110, and angle α is the one we need to find, maybe there are three other angles as well, each intercepting arcs, so total intercepted arcs would be 360.

Wait, but in a hexagon, there are six angles, so each angle intercepts an arc, so six intercepted arcs. So, the sum of all six intercepted arcs is 360 degrees. So, if we have three given angles, their intercepted arcs sum to 210 + 220 + (intercepted arc for angle α). But we need to find the intercepted arc for angle α.

Wait, no. Each angle is formed by two sides, each side intercepts an arc. So, perhaps each angle is formed by two arcs, but the intercepted arc is the one that the angle is opposite to. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Maybe I should look for another approach. Since it's a cyclic hexagon, opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 degrees, but in a hexagon, the concept is similar but different. I remember something called the "circumscribed circle" and the "power of a point," but I think that's for circles.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the central angles. Each side of the hexagon subtends a central angle. The central angles add up to 360 degrees. If I can find the central angles corresponding to each side, I can then find the inscribed angles.

But the given angles in the problem are not central angles; they are inscribed angles, which are half the measure of their intercepted arcs. So, if I can find the arcs corresponding to those angles, I can find the central angles.

Given that, let's denote the arcs opposite to each angle. For angle F, which is 105 degrees, the intercepted arc is 210 degrees. Similarly, angle B is 110 degrees, so its intercepted arc is 220 degrees.

Wait, but arcs can't be more than 180 degrees if we're talking about minor arcs. Wait, no, actually, intercepted arcs can be major arcs or minor arcs depending on the angle. So, for an inscribed angle, if it's greater than 90 degrees, the intercepted arc is greater than 180 degrees, and if it's less than 90, the intercepted arc is less than 180.

So, angle F is 105, which is greater than 90, so intercepted arc is 210 degrees. Similarly, angle B is 110, which is also greater than 90, so intercepted arc is 220 degrees. So, two intercepted arcs are 210 and 220, adding up to 430. But that can't be, as the total circle is 360 degrees.

Wait, so that means that these intercepted arcs are overlapping or something. So, perhaps the intercepted arcs are not on the same side of the circle.

Wait, maybe in a cyclic hexagon, each angle is formed by two adjacent arcs. So, for angle F, which is at point F, it's formed by arcs EA and ED. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, perhaps I need to label the arcs between each pair of consecutive points. Let's denote the arcs between points A, B, C, D, E, F as arcs AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA.

Since the hexagon is cyclic, these arcs add up to 360 degrees.

Now, each inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, for angle F, which is at point F, the intercepted arc is the arc opposite to F, which would be arc EA. Similarly, angle B at point B intercepts arc FA, angle C intercepts arc FD, angle D intercepts arc FE, angle E intercepts arc DC, and angle A intercepts arc CB.

So, each angle intercepts an arc that skips one vertex. So, angle F intercepts arc EFA, which is the arc from E to F to A, skipping B, C, D.

Wait, maybe. So, if that's the case, then each angle intercepts an arc that is two sides away.

So, angle F is formed by sides FE and FA. The intercepted arc is E to A, skipping B, C, D. So, the arc from E to A is two sides away.

Similarly, angle B is formed by sides BF and BA, intercepting arc F to A, skipping C, D, E.

So, in that case, if I denote the arcs as follows: arc AB = x, arc BC = y, arc CD = z, arc DE = w, arc EF = v, arc FA = u.

Then, the intercepted arcs for the angles are:

- Angle F intercepts arc E to A, which is arc EF + arc FA = v + u.

- Angle B intercepts arc F to A, which is arc FE + arc AB + arc BC + arc CD = v + x + y + z.

Wait, no, that seems too much. Wait, angle B is at point B, formed by sides BF and BA. The intercepted arc should be the arc opposite to angle B, which is arc F to A, skipping over points C, D, E.

So, arc F to A is arc FE + arc EA. But arc EA is the same as arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DE + arc EF? Wait, no, that's confusing.

Wait, let me think again. In a circle, the intercepted arc for an inscribed angle is the arc that is opposite to the angle, not containing the angle's vertex. So, angle F at point F intercepts arc E to A, which is the arc from E to A that doesn't pass through F, B, C, D.

Similarly, angle B at point B intercepts arc F to A, which is the arc from F to A that doesn't pass through B, C, D, E.

So, in terms of the arcs between consecutive points, intercepted arc for angle F is arc EFA, which is arc EF + arc FA, which is v + u.

Similarly, intercepted arc for angle B is arc FAB, which is arc FE + arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DE. Wait, that's the entire circle except arc EA, which is x + y + z + w.

Wait, that can't be because intercepted arcs should be the arcs opposite to the angles, so in this case, arc EFA is v + u, and arc FAB is v + u, but that would mean the intercepted arcs are the same, which isn't correct.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the intercepted arcs.

Wait, angle F is at point F, and the sides are FE and FA. The intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to angle F, which is arc EA. So, arc EA is u + v.

Similarly, angle B is at point B, sides BF and BA. The intercepted arc is arc FA, which is v + u.

Wait, so intercepted arc for angle F is u + v, and intercepted arc for angle B is u + v as well? That can't be, because they are different angles.

Wait, no, wait. Angle F is 105 degrees, which intercepts arc EA, which is u + v. So, arc EA = u + v. Similarly, angle B is 110 degrees, which intercepts arc FA, which is v + u. So, arc FA = v + u. Wait, that can't be, because arc EA and arc FA are the same if the hexagon is convex, which it is.

Wait, so if angle F intercepts arc EA (u + v), and angle B intercepts arc FA (v + u), then both are same. But in reality, angle F is 105, angle B is 110, so their intercepted arcs are different. So, what's going on here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in labeling the intercepted arcs.

Wait, angle F is at point F, sides FE and FA. The intercepted arc is the arc opposite to angle F, which is arc EA, which is the arc from E to A not passing through F, B, C, D. So, that's arc EF (v) plus arc FA (u), so total u + v.

Similarly, angle B is at point B, sides BF and BA. The intercepted arc is the arc opposite to angle B, which is arc FA, which is arc FE (v) plus arc AB (x) plus arc BC (y) plus arc CD (z). So, that's x + y + z + v.

So, angle B intercepts arc x + y + z + v, which is equal to 2*110 = 220 degrees. So, arc x + y + z + v = 220.

Similarly, angle F intercepts arc u + v, which is 2*105 = 210 degrees.

So, we have two equations:

1. u + v = 210

2. x + y + z + v = 220

Then, what about the other angles? The angles at D and C and E.

Angle at D: α, which is angle CDE. So, it's formed by sides DC and DE. The intercepted arc is arc E to C, which is arc ED + arc DC, which is w + z.

So, angle D intercepts arc w + z, which is 2*α.

Similarly, angle at E: angle DEA. It's formed by sides ED and EA. The intercepted arc is arc A to E, which is arc EF + arc FA, which is v + u. So, angle E intercepts arc v + u, which is 2*angle at E.

But angle at E is not given, so maybe we need to find some other relations.

Wait, the intercepted arcs for angles at D and E are w + z and v + u, respectively. But we already have u + v = 210 and x + y + z + v = 220.

So, let me see. The total circumference is 360, so u + v + w + x + y + z = 360.

From equation 1: u + v = 210, so w + x + y + z = 360 - 210 = 150.

From equation 2: x + y + z + v = 220.

But we have w + x + y + z = 150, and x + y + z + v = 220.

So, subtracting the first equation from the second: (x + y + z + v) - (w + x + y + z) = 220 - 150 => v - w = 70.

So, v = w + 70.

That's one equation.

Now, we have:

1. u + v = 210

2. v = w + 70

3. w + x + y + z = 150

4. x + y + z + v = 220

We can express everything in terms of w.

From equation 3: w + x + y + z = 150.

From equation 4: x + y + z + v = 220.

Subtract equation 3 from equation 4: v - w = 70, which is consistent with equation 2: v = w +70.

So, we need another equation to relate the variables.

Wait, perhaps the arcs can also be related through the fact that the sum of all arcs is 360.

So, u + v + w + x + y + z = 360.

We have u + v =210, w + x + y + z =150.

So, 210 +150=360, which checks out.

So, now, let's see. We need to find angle α, which is formed by sides DC and DE, intercepting arc w + z.

So, angle α is half the measure of arc w + z, which is 2*α = w + z.

So, if we can find w + z, we can find α.

We have w + x + y + z =150.

But we have v = w +70.

We also have u + v =210, so u =210 - v =210 - (w +70)=140 -w.

So, u=140 -w.

Now, we can express all variables in terms of w.

So, u=140 -w.

v=w +70.

w=w.

x + y + z=150 -w.

But we don't have enough information to find individual variables.

Wait, but maybe we can relate w + z to something.

Wait, angle α is w + z. So, 2α= w + z.

We need to find w + z. Let's denote S = w + z.

Then, from above, w + x + y + z =150 => x + y + z =150 -w.

But we don't know x, y, z individually.

Wait, maybe we can find another equation.

Wait, the sum of the intercepted arcs for all six angles is equal to 360. So, intercepted arcs:

- For angle F: u + v =210

- For angle B: x + y + z + v =220

- For angle D: w + z =2α

- For angle E: v + u =2*angle E

- For angle C: y + u =2*angle C

- For angle A: z + w =2*angle A

But wait, the sum of all intercepted arcs is 210 +220 +2α +2E +2C +2A = 360.

So, 210 +220 +2α +2E +2C +2A =360

Which simplifies to 430 + 2(α + E + C + A) =360

But 430 -360=70= 2(E + C + A + α)

So, 70=2(E + C + A + α)

Thus, E + C + A + α=35

But without knowing the other angles, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, but maybe the sum of angles in a hexagon is related. Wait, in a cyclic polygon, the sum of interior angles is (n-2)*180, where n is the number of sides. So, for a hexagon, the sum is (6-2)*180=720 degrees.

So, the sum of angles F, B, D, E, C, A is 720 degrees.

So, we have:

Angle F + Angle B + Angle D + Angle E + Angle C + Angle A =720

We know angle F=105, angle B=110, angle D=2α, angle E= something, angle C= something, angle A= something.

But we also have the sum of all intercepted arcs as 360, and we have expressions for some arcs.

Wait, maybe I need another approach.

Wait, let me think about the intercepted arcs again.

We have angle F intercepts arc EFA = u + v=210

Angle B intercepts arc FAB= v + u=220

Wait, that's a problem because arc EFA and arc FAB are the same? Wait, no, if you have points E, F, A, then arc EFA is from E to F to A, which is arc EF + arc FA= v + u.

Arc FAB is from F to A via B, which is arc FE + arc AB= v + x.

Wait, so, if angle F intercepts arc EFA= v + u=210

Angle B intercepts arc FAB= v + x=220

So, we have two equations:

1. v + u=210

2. v + x=220

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (v + x) - (v + u)=220 -210 => x -u=10 => x=u +10

So, x=u +10

Now, we also have equation 3: w + x + y + z=150

And equation 4: u + v + w + x + y + z=360

From equation 1: u + v=210 => w + x + y + z=150

From equation 4: u + v + (w + x + y + z)=360 => 210 +150=360, which is consistent.

So, we know x=u +10

So, let me substitute x=u +10 into equation 3: w + (u +10) + y + z=150 => w + u + y + z=140

But from equation 1: u + v=210 => w + x + y + z=150

Wait, not sure.

Wait, maybe there's another angle that can help.

Angle at point D: intercepts arc w + z, which is 2α.

So, 2α=w + z

Similarly, angle at point E: intercepts arc v + u=210 +10=220? Wait, no, angle E intercepts arc v + u, but angle E is not given. Wait, no, angle E intercepts arc v + u? Wait, no, angle E is at point E, formed by sides DE and EF. So, intercepted arc is arc F to E, which is arc FE + arc EA= v + u=210.

Wait, so angle E intercepts arc v + u=210, which is 2*angle E, so angle E=105 degrees. Wait, is that right?

Wait, angle E is at point E, formed by sides DE and EF. The intercepted arc is opposite to angle E, which is arc FA, which is v + u=210. So, angle E=105 degrees.

Wait, that's interesting because angle F is 105, angle B is 110, angle E is 105. So, two angles are 105 degrees.

But angle E is not given, but according to this, it's 105 degrees.

Wait, but angle E is not given in the problem, so maybe it's not. But in this case, angle E is 105 degrees, which is equal to angle F.

So, moving on, angle at point C: intercepts arc y + u, which is 2*angle C.

Similarly, angle at point A: intercepts arc z + w, which is 2*angle A.

So, angle C= (y + u)/2, angle A= (z + w)/2

We need to find angle α, which is angle D= w + z, so 2α=w + z

So, if we can find w + z, we can find α.

Let me see if I can find w + z.

From equation 3: w + x + y + z=150

We have x=u +10, so equation 3 becomes: w + (u +10) + y + z=150 => w + u + y + z=140

But from equation 1: u + v=210 => w + x + y + z=150

But x=u +10, so w + (u +10) + y + z=150 => w + u + y + z=140

Which is the same as above.

So, from equation 3: w + u + y + z=140

And from equation 4: u + v + w + x + y + z=360

Which is u + v + (w + x + y + z)=360 => u + v +150=360 => u + v=210, which is equation 1.

So, that doesn't help.

Wait, maybe we can find another equation.

We know that angle D intercepts arc w + z=2α, so 2α=w + z

Similarly, angle C intercepts arc y + u, which is 2*angle C

We need to find w + z.

But if we can express w + z in terms of other variables.

From equation 3: w + x + y + z=150, and x=u +10.

So, w + (u +10) + y + z=150 => w + u + y + z=140

But from equation 1: u + v=210

So, maybe we can express u in terms of v, or something else.

Wait, angle D is w + z=2α

So, w + z=2α

So, from equation 3: w + u + y + z=140 => (w + z) + u + y=140 =>2α + u + y=140

So, 2α + u + y=140

Similarly, equation 1: u + v=210

So, if I can express u in terms of v, or vice versa.

From equation 1: u=210 -v

So, substitute into 2α + u + y=140:

2α + (210 -v) + y=140 =>2α +210 -v + y=140 =>2α -v + y= -70

So, 2α -v + y= -70

But we don't know v or y.

Wait, maybe from equation 2: v + x=220, and x=u +10, so v + u +10=220 =>v + u=210

Wait, that's equation 1, so we don't get new info.

Wait, maybe I need to look at angle E.

Earlier, I thought angle E intercepts arc v + u=210, so angle E=105 degrees.

So, angle E=105, which is given? Wait, in the problem, angle E is not given, but from the intercepted arc, it's 210, so angle E=105.

So, angle E=105.

So, now, let's list all known angles:

Angle F=105

Angle B=110

Angle E=105

Angle D=2α

Angle C= (y + u)/2

Angle A= (z + w)/2

Sum of all angles in a hexagon is (6-2)*180=720.

So, 105 +110 +105 +2α + (y + u)/2 + (z + w)/2=720

Simplify:

105 +110 +105=320

So, 320 +2α + (y + u)/2 + (z + w)/2=720

Thus, 2α + (y + u)/2 + (z + w)/2=720 -320=400

Multiply both sides by 2:

4α + y + u + z + w=800

But from equation 3: w + x + y + z=150, and x=u +10, so w + u + y + z=140

So, 4α + (w + u + y + z)=4α +140=800

Thus, 4α +140=800 =>4α=660 =>α=165.

Wait, that seems too big. 165 degrees is more than a straight angle. Let me check.

Wait, 4α=660 =>α=165. Hmm, 105, 110, 105, 165, and two other angles. Let's see if that makes sense.

Wait, 105 +110 +105 +165= 105*3 +110=315 +110=425.

Then, the other two angles are 2α=330, and (y + u)/2 + (z + w)/2= (y + z + u + w)/2=140/2=70.

So, total sum is 425 +330 +70=825, which is more than 720. Hmm, that can't be.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let's go back.

We had:

Sum of all angles in hexagon=720.

We have angles:

F=105, B=110, E=105, D=2α, C=(y + u)/2, A=(z + w)/2.

So, sum=105 +110 +105 +2α + (y + u)/2 + (z + w)/2=720.

Compute sum:

105 +110=215; 215 +105=320.

So, 320 +2α + (y + u)/2 + (z + w)/2=720.

So, 2α + (y + u)/2 + (z + w)/2=720 -320=400.

Multiply both sides by 2:

4α + y + u + z + w=800.

But from equation 3: w +x + y + z=150.

And x=u +10, so w + (u +10) + y + z=150 => w +u + y + z=140.

Thus, 4α +140=800 =>4α=660 =>α=165.

But then, the other angles:

(y + u)/2 + (z + w)/2= (y + z + u + w)/2=140/2=70.

So, sum of all angles=105 +110 +105 +165 +70=555.

But that's way less than 720. So, something's wrong.

Wait, maybe my initial mistake was assuming that angle E intercepts arc v + u, but actually, angle E intercepts arc FAB, which is arc FE + arc AB= v + x=220, which is equal to 2*angle E, so angle E=110 degrees.

Wait, so let me correct that.

Earlier, I thought angle E intercepts arc v + u=210, but actually, angle E intercepts arc v + x=220, so angle E=110 degrees.

I missed that earlier.

So, angle E=110 degrees.

So, going back, angle E=110.

So, now, the sum of all angles is:

105 (F) +110 (B) +110 (E) +2α (D) + (y + u)/2 (C) + (z + w)/2 (A)=720

Compute the known angles:105 +110=215; 215 +110=325.

So, 325 +2α + (y + u)/2 + (z + w)/2=720.

Thus, 2α + (y + u)/2 + (z + w)/2=720 -325=395.

Multiply both sides by 2:

4α + y + u + z + w=790.

But from equation 3: w +x + y + z=150.

From equation 2: v +x=220, and x=u +10, so v +u +10=220 =>v +u=210.

From equation 1: u +v=210.

So, equation 3: w +x + y + z=150 =>w + (u +10) + y + z=150 =>w +u + y + z=140.

So, 4α + (w +u + y + z)=4α +140=790 =>4α=650 =>α=162.5 degrees.

Hmm, 162.5 degrees is still a very large angle.

Wait, let me check.

If angle D=2α=325, which is a reflex angle? Because 325 is greater than 180.

But in a hexagon, can an angle be reflex? I think in a convex hexagon, all internal angles are less than 180, but in a cyclic hexagon, it's possible to have reflex angles if the hexagon is not convex.

But in this case, with the given angles, maybe it's possible.

But let's see.

Sum of all angles=720.

If angle D=325, then the remaining angles sum to 720 -325=395.

So, 395=105 +110 +110 + (y + u)/2 + (z + w)/2.

Wait, 105 +110 +110=325, so 395 -325=70= (y + u)/2 + (z + w)/2.

So, (y + u + z + w)/2=70 => y + u + z + w=140.

But from equation 3: w +x + y + z=150 =>w + (u +10) + y + z=150 =>w +u + y + z=140.

So, equation holds.

So, 4α +140=790 =>4α=650 =>α=162.5.

Hmm, 162.5 degrees. So, angle D=162.5 degrees, which is reflex.

But in a cyclic hexagon, can an internal angle be reflex? I think so, but in a convex polygon, all internal angles are less than 180. But since we're dealing with a cyclic hexagon, perhaps it's allowed.

But in the problem, they just ask for the measure of α, which is 162.5 degrees.

Wait, but 162.5 is 131/8, but that seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me recast the problem.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption about the intercepted arcs. Maybe angle D intercepts a different arc.

Wait, angle D is at point D, which is between points C, D, E.

So, the intercepted arcs would be the arcs opposite to angle D.

Which, in a cyclic hexagon, would be arc CB and arc FE.

Wait, no, in a cyclic hexagon, each angle intercepts an arc that skips one vertex. So, angle D intercepts arc CFE, which is arc CF + arc FE.

Wait, point C, D, E. The arc opposite to angle D is from C to E, skipping D.

Wait, so arc CE.

Which is arc CF + arc FE.

But arc CF is x, and arc FE is v.

So, angle D intercepts arc CF + arc FE= x + v.

So, 2α=x + v.

Similarly, angle B is at point B, which intercepts arc FAB, which is arc FA + arc AB= v + x.

Which is 220, so angle B=110.

Angle E is at point E, which intercepts arc FAB= v + u=210, so angle E=105.

Angle F is at point F, which intercepts arc EAB= v + u=210, so angle F=105.

Angle A is at point A, which intercepts arc CDE= arc CD + arc DE= w + z.

Wait, maybe.

Wait, no, angle A is at point A, so the intercepted arc is the one opposite to angle A, which is arc CDE, which would be arc CD + arc DE= w + z.

So, angle A= (w + z)/2.

Wait, so maybe angle D intercepts arc CE= x + v.

So, angle D= (x + v)/2=α.

Similarly, angle C intercepts arc DE= arc DE= w, which is w=2 angle C.

Wait, no, angle C intercepts arc DE= arc D to E, which is w.

So, angle C= w/2.

Similarly, angle E intercepts arc FA= v + u=210, so angle E=105.

Angle F intercepts arc AB= x + v=220, so angle F=110.

Wait, that makes more sense.

So, let me try again.

Angle F is at point F, inscribed angle intercepts arc AB= x + v, which is 220, so angle F=110.

Angle B is at point B, intercepts arc EA= v + u=210, so angle B=105.

Angle E is at point E, intercepts arc AB= x + v=220, so angle E=110.

Angle D is at point D, intercepts arc CE= x + v=220, so angle D=110.

Wait, that's different.

Wait, so angle D is intercepting arc CE= x + v=220, so angle D=110.

Wait, but angle D is at point D, so the intercepted arc is the one opposite to angle D. In a cyclic polygon, the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't contain the angle.

So, in this case, angle D is at point D, so the intercepted arc is arc C to E, which is arc CE.

So, that's x + v.

So, angle D= (x + v)/2.

Similarly, angle C is at point C, intercepts arc DE= w.

So, angle C= w/2.

Angle E is at point E, intercepts arc FA= v + u=210, so angle E=105.

Angle F is at point F, intercepts arc AB= x + v=220, so angle F=110.

Angle B is at point B, intercepts arc EA= v + u=210, so angle B=105.

Angle A is at point A, intercepts arc CD= w.

Wait, no, angle A is at point A, so the intercepted arc is arc CD= w.

Wait, no, intercepted arc is arc DE? Wait, angle A is at point A, so the intercepted arc is the one not containing A, which is arc CD= w.

So, angle A= w/2.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, summarizing:

Angle F=110, intercepts arc AB= x + v=220, so angle F=110.

Angle B=105, intercepts arc EA= v + u=210, so angle B=105.

Angle E=105, intercepts arc AB= x + v=220, so angle E=105.

Angle D=110, intercepts arc CE= x + v=220, so angle D=110.

Angle C= w/2, intercepts arc DE= w.

Angle A= w/2, intercepts arc CD= w.

Wait, but in that case, angle C=(w)/2, angle A=(w)/2.

So, angles C and A are equal.

So, now, let's recap:

Angles:

F=110

B=105

E=105

D=110

C=w/2

A=w/2

Sum of all angles=110 +105 +105 +110 + (w/2) + (w/2)=720

Compute sum:

110+105=215

215+105=320

320+110=430

So, 430 +w=720 =>w=720 -430=290.

Wait, w=290.

But w is an arc measure, which can't be more than 180 in a convex polygon, but since it's cyclic, it can be more.

But let's proceed.

So, w=290, so angle C=w/2=145 degrees.

Similarly, angle A=w/2=145 degrees.

Wait, but that would make angle C and angle A both 145.

But in the problem, it's a convex hexagon, so all internal angles must be less than 180.

145 is less than 180, so that's okay.

So, angle α= angle D=110 degrees.

Wait, but earlier, I thought angle D=110.

So, but in the problem, it's asking for α, which is angle D=110 degrees.

But wait, in the initial problem statement, it's labeled as α, but in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as angle F, B, D, E.

Wait, in the problem, the hexagon is labeled with points A, B, C, D, E, F, so the angles are F, B, D, E, C, A.

So, angle F=110, angle B=105, angle D=110, angle E=105, angle C=145, angle A=145.

So, sum is 110+105+110+105+145+145=110*2 +105*2 +145*2=220 +210 +290=720, which is correct.

So, angle α is angle D=110 degrees.

Wait, so in the problem, angle α is angle D, which is 110 degrees.

But in my earlier calculation, I thought of angle D intercepting arc CE= x + v=220, so angle D=110.

But in the problem, angle D is 110, so that's the answer.

Wait, but the initial problem didn't specify where α is, so in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as angle F, B, D, E, C, A, so α is angle D.

So, answer is 110 degrees.

Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought angle D intercepts arc CE= x + v=220, which is correct, and angle D=110.

So, α=110.

Wait, but in my step-by-step, after correctly identifying that angle D intercepts arc CE= x + v=220, so angle D=110.

Thus, angle α is 110.

But in the problem statement, they labeled angle F=105, angle B=110, angle E=105, angle D=α, angle C=145, angle A=145.

So, the answer is 110 degrees.

Wait, but wait, in the problem, angle F is 105, angle B is 110, angle E is 105, and angle D is α.

So, with angle D=110, angle C=145, angle A=145.

So, the answer is 110 degrees.

But in my earlier wrong calculation, I thought angle E was 105, which is correct, and angle D was 110, which is correct.

So, the measure of α is 110 degrees.

But in the problem, the angle α is angle D, which is 110, so the answer is 110.

But in the problem, the Asymptote code labels the angle as alpha, but it's not clear. But given that, the answer is 110 degrees.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the angle is labeled as alpha, but in the diagram, it's angle D.

Wait, no, the Asymptote code labels the angle at point D as alpha, but the angle is not shown in the diagram; it's the label.

So, in the problem statement, they are asking for the measure of alpha, which is angle D, which is 110 degrees.

So, the answer is 110 degrees.

Wait, but in the problem, angle F is 105, angle B is 110, angle E is 105, angle D is α, which is 110. So, the answer is 110.

But in the problem statement, we have angle B=110, angle F=105, angle E=105, so angle D=110, angle C=145, angle A=145.

So, the measure of angle α is 110 degrees.

Therefore, the answer is 110 degrees, so 110.

But in the Asymptote code, the angle is labeled as alpha, but in the problem statement, it's given as α. So, regardless, it's 110 degrees.

Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the Asymptote code labels the angle as alpha, but in the problem, the angle is at point D, which is labeled as alpha in the Asymptote code.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, the Asymptote code is given, but in the problem statement, it's just the labels.

So, in the problem statement, it's just asking for the measure of angle alpha, which is angle D, which is 110.

So, the answer is 110 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as angle alpha at point D, which is 110.

So, yes, the measure is 110 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The measure of α is \boxed{110} degrees.
</think>

Given a cyclic hexagon inscribed in a circle, we need to find the measure of angle \(\alpha\). The angles given are \(\angle F = 105^\circ\), \(\angle B = 110^\circ\), and \(\angle E = 105^\circ\).

1. **Understanding Cyclic Hexagons**:
   - A cyclic hexagon is inscribed in a circle, meaning all its vertices lie on the circumference of the circle.
   - Each angle in a cyclic polygon is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

2. **Intercepted Arcs**:
   - For each angle, the intercepted arc is twice the measure of the angle.
   - For example, \(\angle F\) intercepts arc \(EFA\), \(\angle B\) intercepts arc \(FAB\), and so on.

3. **Calculating Intercepted Arcs**:
   - \(\angle F = 105^\circ\) intercepts arc \(EFA = 210^\circ\).
   - \(\angle B = 110^\circ\) intercepts arc \(FAB = 220^\circ\).
   - \(\angle E = 105^\circ\) intercepts arc \(FAB = 210^\circ\).

4. **Sum of Arcs**:
   - The total sum of all arcs in the circle is \(360^\circ\).
   - The sum of the intercepted arcs for the given angles is \(210^\circ + 220^\circ + 210^\circ = 640^\circ\).
   - This sum exceeds \(360^\circ\), indicating the need to consider the remaining arcs.

5. **Intercepted Arcs for Angle \(\alpha\)**:
   - \(\angle D\) is the angle we need to find, which intercepts another arc.
   - The intercepted arc for \(\angle D\) is the remaining part of the circle not covered by the other arcs.

6. **Calculating Angle \(\alpha\)**:
   - The intercepted arc for \(\angle D\) is calculated by considering the remaining arcs and the given angles.
   - The measure of \(\angle D\) is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - After considering the intercepted arcs and the given angles, we find that the measure of \(\angle D\) (which is \(\alpha\)) is \(110^\circ\).

Thus, the measure of \(\alpha\) is \(\boxed{110}\) degrees.
