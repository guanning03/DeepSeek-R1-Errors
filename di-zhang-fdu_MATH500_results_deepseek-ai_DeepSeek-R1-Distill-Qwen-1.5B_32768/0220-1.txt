Question:
Kathy needs money for her trip to Europe. If she has 300 US dollars in the bank but wants to withdraw half of it in British pounds and half of it in euros, how many more euros than pounds will she have? Assume 1 pound = 1.64 USD and 1 euro = 1.32 USD, and round to the nearest whole number.

Correct Answer:
After Kathy has exchanged half of her money ($300\text{ USD}\div 2 = 150\text{ USD}$) into pounds, she will have $150\text{ USD}\times\frac{1\text{ pound}}{1.64 \text{ USD}}\approx 91.46 \text{ pounds}$. After exchanging the other half of her money into euros, she will have $150\text{ USD} \times\frac{1\text{ euro}}{1.32 \text{ USD}}\approx 113.64\text{ euros}$. Subtracting these two values, we have $113.64-91.46=22.18$. Since the question calls for the nearest whole number, we round 22.18 to the final answer of $\boxed{22}$.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how much Kathy will withdraw in pounds and euros. She has 300 USD in her bank account and wants to withdraw half of it in each currency.

Half of 300 USD is 150 USD. This amount will be converted into pounds and euros using the given exchange rates.

To convert 150 USD to pounds, I divide 150 by the exchange rate of 1.64. Similarly, to convert 150 USD to euros, I divide 150 by the exchange rate of 1.32.

Calculating the pounds: 150 ÷ 1.64 ≈ 91.06 pounds.

Calculating the euros: 150 ÷ 1.32 ≈ 113.64 euros.

Next, I need to find out how many more euros Kathy will have than pounds. I subtract the amount in pounds from the amount in euros: 113.64 - 91.06 = 22.58 euros.

Finally, I round 22.58 to the nearest whole number, which gives me 23 euros.

**Solution:**

Kathy has **300 USD** in her bank account. She wants to withdraw half of it in British pounds and half in euros.

1. **Calculate the amount to withdraw in pounds:**
   
   \[
   \text{Amount in pounds} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ USD}
   \]
   
   To convert USD to pounds:
   
   \[
   150 \text{ USD} \div 1.64 \text{ USD/£} \approx 91.06 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount to withdraw in euros:**
   
   \[
   \text{Amount in euros} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ USD}
   \]
   
   To convert USD to euros:
   
   \[
   150 \text{ USD} \div 1.32 \text{ USD/Euro} \approx 113.64 \text{ euros}
   \]

3. **Determine how many more euros than pounds Kathy will have:**
   
   \[
   113.64 \text{ euros} - 91.06 \text{ pounds} = 22.58 \text{ euros}
   \]
   
   Rounded to the nearest whole number:
   
   \[
   \boxed{23}
   \]
