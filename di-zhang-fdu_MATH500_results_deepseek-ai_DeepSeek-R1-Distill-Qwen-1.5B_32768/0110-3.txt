Correct Answer:
Since $AB \parallel DE,$ we know that $\angle A = \angle E$ and $\angle B = \angle D.$ That works out nicely, since that means $\triangle ABC \sim EDC.$ If $BD = 4BC,$ that means $CD = BD - BC = 3BC.$ Therefore, the ratio of sides in $ABC$ to $EDC$ is $1:3,$ meaning the ratio of their areas is $1:9.$

Since the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $6\text{ cm}^2,$ that means the area of $\triangle CDE$ is $\boxed{54}\text{ cm}^2.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC, and its area is 6 square centimeters. They mention that segment AB is parallel to segment DE. Hmm, okay, so AB || DE. Also, BD is four times BC. So BD = 4 BC. I need to find the area of triangle CDE.

First, let me try to understand the figure. The Asymptote code draws a triangle with points A, B, C, D, E. From the labels, A is at the top, B is on the left, C is at the bottom right, D is on the right, and E is on the left. So it seems like AB is the top side, BC is the left side, and CD is the right side? Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, it's drawn from (-.3,-3) to (.1,1) to (-1,0) to (3,0) to cycle. So point A is at (0.1,1), B is at (-1,0), C is at (0,0), D is at (3,0), and E is at (-0.3,-3). So triangle ABC is between points A, B, and C, which is the main triangle. Then, points D and E are on the extensions of BC and maybe something else? Wait, not sure.

Wait, the Asymptote code is a bit complex, but from the coordinates, it seems that triangle ABC is drawn from (-1,0) to (0,0) to (0.1,1) and back. Then, points D and E are at (3,0) and (-0.3,-3). So, I think that the figure is a triangle ABC with base BC from (-1,0) to (0,0), and point A is at (0.1,1). Then, D is at (3,0), which is to the right of C, and E is at (-0.3,-3), which is below B. So, DE is a segment connecting D and E.

They tell me that AB is parallel to DE. So, AB is from (-1,0) to (0,0), and DE is from (-0.3,-3) to (3,0). Let me check if these are parallel. The slope of AB: since both points are on the x-axis, AB is horizontal, so slope is 0. The slope of DE: from (-0.3,-3) to (3,0). The change in y is 0 - (-3) = 3, and change in x is 3 - (-0.3) = 3.3. So slope is 3 / 3.3, which is approximately 0.909, not zero. Wait, that can't be, because AB is supposed to be parallel to DE. So maybe I'm misinterpreting the coordinates?

Wait, hold on. Maybe the Asymptote code is just a rough drawing, not to scale. So perhaps I shouldn't rely on exact coordinates but instead use the general information given. So, the key points are triangle ABC with area 6, AB parallel to DE, BD = 4 BC.

Let me try to sketch it mentally. ABC is a triangle, AB is one side, and DE is another segment, parallel to AB. BD is four times BC. So, if I consider point B, then from B, BD is four times BC. So, maybe D is a point beyond C on the extension of BC, such that BD = 4 BC. So, BD = BC + CD. So if BD = 4 BC, then CD = 3 BC. So, BD is four times BC, meaning that D is three times BC away from C.

Wait, no. If BD = 4 BC, then BC is the length from B to C, and BD is from B to D. So, if BD is four times BC, then D is located such that from B, you go four times the length of BC in the same direction. So, since BC is from B to C, which is a certain direction, then D is four times that length beyond C.

But in the problem, we have DE parallel to AB. So DE is a segment connecting D and E somewhere, and it's parallel to AB. So, triangle CDE is formed with points C, D, and E.

I think the key here is to use similar triangles because AB is parallel to DE, so triangles ABC and CDE might be similar. But wait, is that the case? Let me think.

If DE is parallel to AB, then triangles CDE and CAB are similar because they have the same angles. So, the ratio of their sides is equal. But wait, is that correct? Let me confirm.

In triangle ABC, AB is a side, and DE is a line segment parallel to AB. So, the triangles formed by these parallel lines are similar. But here, the triangle is CDE. So, point D is on the extension of BC, and E is somewhere such that DE is parallel to AB.

Wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, E is at (-0.3,-3), which is below point B. So, perhaps E is on the extension of AB or something else. Hmm, I might be overcomplicating.

Let me try to assign some variables to the lengths. Let me denote BC as x. Then BD is 4x, so CD would be BC + CD? Wait, no, BD is the entire length from B to D, which is BC (from B to C) plus CD. So BD = BC + CD = x + CD. And BD is given as 4 times BC, so BD = 4x. Therefore, x + CD = 4x, so CD = 3x. So, CD is three times BC.

So, from point C, we have a segment CD of length 3x in the same direction as BC. So, that locates point D beyond point C.

Now, DE is parallel to AB. So, DE is a segment starting at D and going in the same direction as AB, but since D is beyond C, DE must be extending beyond C as well.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, E is at (-0.3,-3), which is below point B. So, perhaps E is on the extension of AB? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe E is on the extension of BC beyond C.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates to make this clearer. Let me set point B at (0,0), point C at (x,0), so BC is of length x. Then, since BD is 4 BC, so BD = 4x, so point D would be at (4x,0). So, BC is from (0,0) to (x,0), so BD is from (0,0) to (4x,0). Then, AB is parallel to DE, so DE is parallel to AB.

So, point A is somewhere not on the x-axis, and AB is from (0,0) to A. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, A is at (0.1,1), but in my coordinate system, I set B at (0,0) and C at (x,0). Maybe that complicates things.

Alternatively, let's assign coordinates more abstractly.

Let me denote point B as (0,0). Let me denote point C as (c,0). So BC is of length c. Then, BD is 4 times BC, so BD = 4c, so point D is at (4c,0). Now, AB is parallel to DE. So, AB is a segment from A to B, which is from (a,b) to (0,0). DE is a segment from D(4c,0) to E somewhere.

Since AB is parallel to DE, the slope of AB must equal the slope of DE.

Slope of AB: (b - 0)/(a - 0) = b/a.

Slope of DE: (y_E - 0)/(4c - x_E), where E is some point (x_E, y_E). Since DE is parallel to AB, their slopes are equal:

(y_E)/(4c - x_E) = b/a.

So, y_E = (b/a)(4c - x_E).

Now, we need to find the area of triangle CDE. Let's find the coordinates of E.

Wait, but we don't know much about point E. Maybe we can express E in terms of point A and D?

Wait, since DE is parallel to AB, and D is on the extension of BC, perhaps E is a point such that DE is a translated version of AB.

But without knowing where A is, it's hard to determine E. Maybe it's better to use vectors or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, since AB || DE, the triangles ABC and CDE are similar. Because if two sides are parallel, the corresponding angles are equal, so triangles are similar.

So, triangle ABC ~ triangle CDE by AA similarity (since angle C is common, and angles at A and D are equal because AB || DE).

Therefore, the ratio of similarity is equal to the ratio of corresponding sides.

In triangle ABC, side AB corresponds to side CD in triangle CDE.

Wait, no. Wait, triangle ABC and triangle CDE: in triangle ABC, AB is a side, and in triangle CDE, CD is a side. So, the ratio of similarity is CD / AB.

Given that BD = 4 BC, and BC is length c, BD is 4c, so CD is 3c.

Therefore, CD = 3 BC.

But AB is another side, and DE is parallel to AB, so DE is a translated version of AB.

Wait, maybe the ratio is BC / BD? Wait, BD is 4 BC, so BC / BD = 1/4.

Wait, no, in similar triangles, the ratio is usually the ratio of corresponding sides.

Wait, since DE is parallel to AB, and D is on BC extended, so the ratio of DE to AB is the same as the ratio of CD to BC.

Wait, CD is 3 BC, so the ratio is 3. So DE is 3 times AB.

Wait, actually, no. The ratio of the sides is CD / BC = 3. So, the ratio of similarity is 3.

Therefore, the area ratio is 3 squared, which is 9.

But triangle CDE is similar to triangle CAB? Wait, no. Wait, triangle ABC and triangle CDE are similar, but the area ratio would be (CD / BC)^2.

But CD is 3 BC, so (3)^2 = 9.

But triangle ABC has area 6. So, triangle CDE would have area 9 * 6 = 54? But that seems too large.

Wait, maybe the ratio is the other way around. Because triangle CDE is similar to triangle CAB, but scaled by 3, so area is 9 times 6, which is 54. But the answer seems too big, and the problem says the area of ABC is 6. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the ratio is BC / CD, which is 1/3.

Wait, if triangle ABC ~ triangle CDE, then the ratio is AB / CD. But AB is a side of ABC, CD is a side of CDE.

Wait, maybe I need to find the ratio of areas of similar triangles.

Wait, if AB || DE, then triangle ABC ~ triangle CDE. So, the ratio of similarity is AB / CD.

But we know that BD = 4 BC, so BC / CD = 1 / 3. So, the ratio of similarity is 1/3, so the area ratio is (1/3)^2 = 1/9.

Therefore, area of CDE is 6 * (1/9) = 2/3. But that would be smaller, which doesn't make sense because CDE is a larger triangle.

Wait, perhaps I need to correct my approach.

Let me consider triangle ABC and triangle CDE.

Since AB || DE, the triangles ABC and CDE are similar.

The ratio of similarity is equal to the ratio of the corresponding sides. Since BD = 4 BC, then BC / CD = 1/3, so CD = 3 BC.

Therefore, the ratio of similarity is AB / CD. Wait, no, it's BC / CD.

Wait, if triangles ABC and CDE are similar, then the sides correspond. So, AB corresponds to CD, BC corresponds to CE, and AC corresponds to DE.

So, AB / CD = BC / CE = AC / DE.

From above, CD = 3 BC, so AB / CD = AB / (3 BC).

But we don't know AB or BC. However, we can express AB in terms of BC.

Wait, since AB is a side of triangle ABC, and we know the area of ABC is 6.

Maybe I can express AB in terms of BC. Let's denote BC as x, so AB is some length, say y. Then, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*BC*height. If I can find the height, maybe I can relate y and x.

Alternatively, since triangles ABC and CDE are similar with ratio 1/3, so area ratio is 1/9. But if I'm not sure, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, another approach: using coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates to ABC.

Let me set point B at (0,0), point C at (c,0). Then, point A is somewhere at (a,b). Then, BD is 4 BC, so point D is at (4c, 0). Then, DE is parallel to AB.

So, DE is parallel to AB, which has slope (b - 0)/(a - 0) = b/a.

So, DE has the same slope. So, DE is a line starting at D(4c, 0) with slope b/a.

So, equation of DE: y = (b/a)(x - 4c).

Now, point E is on DE, but we need to find its coordinates. Wait, but we don't have more information about E.

Wait, maybe E is such that DE is parallel to AB, but we can also assume that E is a point such that DE is parallel to AB and E lies somewhere to form triangle CDE.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a point on the extension of AC or something else.

Wait, maybe if we consider the coordinates, we can find E.

Wait, let's try to find E.

From DE, which is from D(4c,0) with slope b/a.

So, the parametric equations for DE can be written as x = 4c + t, y = 0 + (b/a) t, where t is a parameter.

So, any point E on DE can be written as (4c + t, (b/a) t).

Now, what is point E? It's supposed to form triangle CDE, so we need to find E such that E is connected to C.

Wait, point C is at (c,0). So, if we connect C to E, then E is somewhere along DE.

But without more information, perhaps E is a specific point. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, E is at (-0.3,-3), but that's specific to their drawing, but in the problem, it's just a general case.

Wait, perhaps E is the intersection of DE with another line.

Wait, maybe point E is such that DE is parallel to AB and E is on the extension of BC beyond C? Wait, but in that case, DE would be a different line.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe I should use vectors.

Let me denote vector BC as vector c, so from B to C, vector BC = c. Then, BD is 4 times BC, so vector BD = 4c.

Since DE is parallel to AB, which is vector AB.

Wait, vector AB is vector from A to B, which is (-a, -b) if A is at (a,b). So, vector AB is (-a, -b). So, vector DE should be a scalar multiple of vector AB.

Thus, vector DE = k * vector AB = (-ka, -kb).

But vector DE is vector from D to E: E = D + vector DE.

So, E = D + vector DE = (4c,0) + (-ka, -kb) = (4c - ka, 0 - kb).

So, coordinates of E are (4c - ka, -kb).

Now, triangle CDE has points C(c,0), D(4c,0), and E(4c - ka, -kb).

We need to find the area of triangle CDE.

Using the shoelace formula:

Area = (1/2)| (c*(0 - (-kb)) + 4c*(-kb - 0) + (4c - ka)*(0 - 0) ) |

Simplify:

= (1/2)| c*(kb) + 4c*(-kb) + (4c - ka)*0 |

= (1/2)| kbc - 4kbc |

= (1/2)| -3kbc |

= (1/2)(3|kbc|) = (3/2)|kbc|

But the area of triangle ABC is 6.

Points A(a,b), B(0,0), C(c,0). So, area is (1/2)*base*height.

Base BC is c, height is the y-coordinate of A, which is b.

So, area ABC = (1/2)*c*b = 6.

Thus, (1/2)bc = 6, so bc = 12.

So, back to area of CDE: (3/2)*|kbc| = (3/2)*|k*12| = (3/2)*12|k| = 18|k|.

But we need to find k.

Wait, how? Because we don't know k.

Wait, but maybe we can find k from the fact that DE is parallel to AB.

But DE is parallel to AB, which is vector (-a, -b). Vector DE is (-ka, -kb) = k*(-a, -b). So, yes, that's consistent.

But we also know that E is a point in the plane, but without more constraints, maybe E is determined by some other condition.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, E is at (-0.3,-3), but that's specific to their drawing. But in the problem, E is just another point such that DE is parallel to AB.

Wait, perhaps the key is that triangle CDE has the same area as CDE. Wait, no, we need to find the area.

Wait, maybe we can use the ratio of areas.

Since DE is parallel to AB, and BD = 4 BC, then the ratio of similarity is 1/3, so the area ratio is (1/3)^2 = 1/9. Therefore, area of CDE is 6*(1/9) = 2/3. But then the answer would be 2/3, but earlier I thought 18k, but perhaps k is 1/3?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I considered BC as c, so the area of ABC is (1/2)*c*b = 6, so bc = 12.

Then, in area of CDE, I had (3/2)*|kbc| = 18|k|.

But in reality, DE is parallel to AB, so the ratio of DE to AB is 1/3, so the ratio of areas is (1/3)^2 = 1/9. Therefore, area of CDE is 6*(1/9) = 2/3.

But then, where did the k come from?

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption by introducing k. Maybe DE is just parallel, and the scaling factor is 1/3, so the ratio is 1/3, hence area is 1/9.

Wait, but I need to verify.

Let me think differently. Since DE is parallel to AB, and BD = 4 BC, then triangle CDE is similar to triangle CAB with a ratio of 1/3, so the area is 1/9 of CAB, which is 6, so 6*(1/9) = 2/3.

But wait, is triangle CDE similar to triangle CAB?

Wait, point C is common, but angle at C is common? Wait, no.

Wait, triangle ABC has angle at B, triangle CDE has angle at C. So, the angles are different.

Wait, maybe triangle CDE is similar to triangle BAC.

Wait, maybe I should think of triangle CDE and triangle CBA.

Wait, if DE is parallel to AB, then triangle CDE is similar to triangle CBA.

Wait, but CDE and CBA: angle at C is common? No, angle at C is not common. Wait, angle at C is not shared.

Wait, maybe triangle CDE is similar to triangle CBA. Let me check.

Wait, angle at C is the same for both triangles. Then, if DE is parallel to AB, then angle at E is equal to angle at B, and angle at D is equal to angle at A. So, triangles CDE and CBA are similar.

Therefore, triangle CDE ~ triangle CBA.

Therefore, the ratio of similarity is CD / CB.

Since CD is 3 CB, so the ratio is 3:1.

Therefore, area ratio is (3)^2 = 9.

Wait, but area of triangle CBA is same as area of triangle ABC, which is 6.

So, area of triangle CDE would be 6 * 9 = 54.

But that's way too big. Hmm.

Wait, but if triangle CDE ~ triangle CBA with ratio 1/3, then area ratio is 1/9, so area of CDE is 6 / 9 = 2/3.

Wait, but which is it? Is the ratio 1/3 or 3?

Wait, if CD is 3 CB, then the ratio of CD / CB is 3, so the ratio of similarity is 3, hence area ratio is 9.

Wait, now I'm confused because depending on the direction, the ratio can be 3 or 1/3.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is 1/3 because DE is closer to D, so the similarity ratio is 1/3.

But I need to be precise.

Since DE is parallel to AB, then triangle CDE ~ triangle CAB with ratio of sides CD / CA.

Wait, no, because CD is on BC, which is part of CB.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is BC / CD = 1/3, so similarity ratio is 1/3, hence area ratio is 1/9.

Therefore, area of CDE is 6 * 1/9 = 2/3.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use coordinate geometry with variables.

Let me denote point C as (c,0), point B as (0,0), point A as (a,b). Then, BD is 4 BC, so point D is at (4c,0).

Then, DE is parallel to AB. Vector AB is (a,b) - (0,0) = (a,b). So, vector DE is some multiple of (a,b). So, vector DE = k*(a,b).

Therefore, point E is at D + vector DE = (4c, 0) + (ka, kb) = (4c + ka, kb).

Now, triangle CDE has points C(c,0), D(4c,0), and E(4c + ka, kb).

We need to find the area of triangle CDE.

Using the shoelace formula:

Area = (1/2)|x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|

Plugging in points C(c,0) = (x1,y1), D(4c,0) = (x2,y2), E(4c + ka, kb) = (x3,y3).

So,

Area = (1/2)|c*(0 - kb) + 4c*(kb - 0) + (4c + ka)*(0 - 0)|

Simplify:

= (1/2)| -c kb + 4c kb + 0 |

= (1/2)| 3c kb | = (3/2)|c kb|

But from triangle ABC, area is 6.

Area of ABC is (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*c*b = 6, so (1/2)c b = 6, so c b = 12.

Therefore, area of CDE = (3/2)|c kb| = (3/2)*c b k = (3/2)*12|k| = 18|k|.

But we need to find k.

Wait, what is k?

From vector DE, which is vector (ka, kb). But vector DE should not be a free variable; it's determined by the position of E.

Wait, unless E is constrained in some way.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "The area of triangle ABC is 6 square centimeters. BD = 4 BC. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of triangle CDE?"

So, perhaps E is just any point such that DE is parallel to AB, but without additional constraints.

But then, E can be anywhere along the line DE, which is parallel to AB.

But since E is part of triangle CDE, which is formed by points C, D, E.

Wait, but in that case, E can be anywhere along line DE, so maybe the area is fixed because of the ratio.

Wait, but in our coordinate system, E is determined by k, which is a scalar multiple. So, unless k is fixed, the area can vary.

But in the problem statement, it just says DE is parallel to AB, without any other conditions. So, perhaps k is arbitrary, but in reality, maybe the triangles are similar, so the ratio is fixed.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in choosing the coordinate system.

Let me try to assign coordinates differently. Let me let BC be along the x-axis, with B at (0,0), C at (1,0), so BC = 1. Then, BD = 4 BC = 4, so D is at (4,0). Then, AB is parallel to DE.

Let me assign coordinates to A. Let me say A is at (0,1), so triangle ABC has coordinates A(0,1), B(0,0), C(1,0). Then, area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*1*1 = 0.5.

But in the problem, area is 6, so I need to scale up.

So, if I let BC be of length 1 unit, area ABC is 0.5. To make it 6, I need to scale it by a factor of 12, since 0.5 * 12 = 6.

Therefore, the scaling factor is 12, so each coordinate is multiplied by 12.

Therefore, point A is at (0*12, 1*12) = (0,12). Wait, no, wait. If BC is from (0,0) to (1,0), then scaling by 12 would make BC from (0,0) to (12,0). Then, point A is at (0,12), so triangle ABC is a right triangle with legs 12 and 12, area 72, which is too big.

Wait, perhaps I need a different approach.

Wait, maybe let me use vectors.

Let me denote vector BC as vector c, so BC = vector c.

Then, BD = 4 BC, so vector BD = 4 vector c.

Since DE is parallel to AB, vector DE is proportional to vector AB. So, vector DE = k vector AB.

But vector AB is vector from A to B. Let me denote vector AB as vector v.

Then, vector DE = k vector v.

Then, point E can be expressed as D + vector DE = D + k vector v.

But we need to express this in terms of known vectors.

But since we don't know point A, this might not be helpful.

Wait, perhaps instead, think in terms of ratios.

Since DE is parallel to AB, the triangles ABC and CDE are similar, as earlier.

The ratio of similarity is BC / CD.

Given that BD = 4 BC, so CD = BD - BC = 3 BC.

Therefore, ratio BC / CD = 1/3.

Therefore, the ratio of similarity is 1/3, so area ratio is (1/3)^2 = 1/9.

Therefore, area of CDE is 6 * (1/9) = 2/3.

But in the problem, is the ratio 1/3 or 3?

Wait, if the ratio of BC to CD is 1/3, then the ratio of similarity is 1/3, so the area is 6*(1/3)^2 = 6/9 = 2/3.

Wait, yes, so the area is 2/3.

But wait, earlier I thought it was 54, but that was due to misapplying the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should just accept that the area is 2/3.

But wait, that seems too small. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is 1/3, so the area is 6*(1/3)^2 = 2/3.

But let me see. If triangle ABC has area 6, and triangle CDE is similar with ratio 1/3, then area is 6*(1/3)^2 = 2/3.

But wait, is triangle CDE similar to ABC with ratio 1/3? If DE is parallel to AB, and CD is 3 BC, then the ratio is 1/3, so the area is 1/9.

Wait, but in that case, the area of CDE would be 6*(1/9) = 2/3. So that's consistent.

But in my coordinate system, I got 18k, which depends on k, but perhaps k isn't arbitrary because of the way DE is placed.

Wait, perhaps k is 1/3, so E is at a specific point.

Wait, maybe I should use vectors.

Let me denote point B as origin (0,0), point C as (c,0), point A as (a,b). Then, point D is at (4c,0).

From DE parallel to AB, so vector DE = k*(vector AB). Vector AB is (a,b). So, vector DE = k*(a,b).

Point E = D + vector DE = (4c,0) + (ka,kb) = (4c + ka, kb).

So, coordinates of E are (4c + ka, kb).

Now, triangle CDE has points C(c,0), D(4c,0), E(4c + ka, kb).

Compute its area using determinant formula:

Area = (1/2)| (c*(0 - kb) + 4c*(kb - 0) + (4c + ka)*(0 - 0) ) | = (1/2)| -c kb + 4c kb | = (1/2)|3c kb| = (3/2)|c kb|.

From triangle ABC, area is (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*c*b = 6.

So, (1/2)c b = 6 => c b = 12.

Therefore, Area of CDE = (3/2)|c kb| = (3/2)*(12)|k| = 18|k|.

But we need to find k.

From point E, which is (4c + ka, kb). Since E is a point in the plane, unless there is another condition, k can be any real number, so the area can be any multiple of 18|k|.

Wait, but in the problem statement, there's no other information about E. So, perhaps the problem assumes that E is such that lines AE and DE intersect at a particular point, but the problem doesn't specify.

Wait, unless in the Asymptote code, E is at (-0.3,-3), but that's a specific case.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that DE is drawn such that E is between D and the extension beyond D. But in that case, k would be negative, but the area would still be positive.

Wait, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the area is fixed regardless of k, which would mean that k is determined by the position of E.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that DE is parallel to AB and that E is the intersection of DE with another line.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, E is at (-0.3,-3). In that case, k would be negative, so E is below the x-axis.

Alternatively, in the problem statement, as given, I think the area is 2/3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use similar triangles.

Since AB || DE, triangles ABC and CDE are similar with ratio BC/CD = 1/3, so area ratio is 1/9, so area of CDE is 6*(1/9) = 2/3.

But earlier, I thought it was 54, which was due to different scaling.

Wait, maybe I need to think that the ratio is CD/BC = 3, so the area ratio is 9, so area of CDE is 6*9=54. But that's conflicting.

Wait, confusion arises because if DE is parallel to AB, then depending on the direction, the ratio can be 1/3 or 3.

If DE is closer to D, then the ratio is 1/3, so area is 1/9.

If DE is further away, the ratio is 3, so area is 9.

But in the problem statement, since BD = 4 BC, point D is 4 times BC from B, so CD = 3 BC.

Thus, DE is such that CD is 3 BC, so the ratio is 3, so area is 3^2=9 times ABC, so 6*9=54.

But wait, in that case, triangle CDE is much larger.

But in my coordinate system, I got 18k, which is dependent on k, so unless k is fixed, the area is variable.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is 1/3.

Wait, in triangle ABC, with BD = 4 BC, so D is 4 BC from B, so triangle CDE is formed by connecting D to a point E such that DE || AB.

So, in that case, the ratio is BC / CD = 1/3, so area ratio is 1/9, so area of CDE is 6*(1/9) = 2/3.

Alternatively, if the ratio is CD / BC = 3, then area ratio is 9, so area of CDE is 54.

But how do I know which is correct?

Wait, if AB || DE, then the triangles ABC and CDE are similar by AA similarity because angle C is common, and angle B is equal to angle E because AB || DE, making corresponding angles equal.

Therefore, triangles ABC and CDE are similar.

The ratio of similarity is BC / CD.

Given that BD = 4 BC, so CD = BD - BC = 3 BC.

Therefore, BC / CD = 1/3.

Therefore, the ratio of similarity is 1/3, so area ratio is (1/3)^2 = 1/9.

Therefore, area of CDE is 6*(1/9) = 2/3.

Thus, the answer is 2/3.

But wait, in my coordinate system, I got 18k, which is dependent on k. So, unless k is fixed, the area is variable.

But in the problem statement, it just says DE || AB, so probably the area is fixed.

Wait, perhaps I need to think that DE is not just any line, but the specific line such that E is on the extension.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, E is at (-0.3,-3), so E is on the extension of AB beyond B.

But in that case, DE is not just parallel to AB, but also in the same direction.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, DE is drawn from D(3,0) to E(-0.3,-3), which is a straight line with slope (-3 - 0)/( -0.3 - 3) = (-3)/(-3.3) ≈ 0.909, which is not the same as AB's slope.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, AB is from A(0.1,1) to B(-1,0), so slope is (1-0)/(0.1 - (-1)) = 1 / 1.1 ≈ 0.909.

Similarly, DE is from D(3,0) to E(-0.3,-3), slope is (-3 - 0)/(-0.3 - 3) = (-3)/(-3.3) ≈ 0.909. So, in the Asymptote code, DE is parallel to AB, as expected.

So, in the Asymptote code, E is on the extension of AB beyond B, so in that case, DE is parallel to AB, but E is on the extension.

So, in that case, the ratio of CD to BC is 3, so the ratio of similarity is 1/3, so area ratio is 1/9, so area of CDE is 6*(1/9) = 2/3.

Therefore, the answer is 2/3.

**Final Answer**
The area of triangle \( \triangle CDE \) is \boxed{\dfrac{2}{3}} square centimeters.
</think>

Given that the area of $\triangle ABC$ is 6 square centimeters, and $\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{DE}$ with $BD = 4BC$, we need to find the area of $\triangle CDE$.

1. **Identify the ratio of similarity**:
   - Since $\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{DE}$, triangles $ABC$ and $CDE$ are similar by AA similarity (they share angle $C$ and have corresponding angles equal because of the parallel lines).
   - The ratio of similarity is determined by the ratio of the corresponding sides. Given $BD = 4BC$, we know $CD = BD - BC = 4BC - BC = 3BC$. Thus, the ratio of similarity is $\frac{BC}{CD} = \frac{1}{3}$.

2. **Calculate the area ratio**:
   - The area ratio of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area ratio is $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}$.

3. **Determine the area of $\triangle CDE$**:
   - The area of $\triangle ABC$ is 6 square centimeters. Using the area ratio, the area of $\triangle CDE$ is $6 \times \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{3}$ square centimeters.

Thus, the number of square centimeters in the area of $\triangle CDE$ is \(\boxed{\dfrac{2}{3}}\).
