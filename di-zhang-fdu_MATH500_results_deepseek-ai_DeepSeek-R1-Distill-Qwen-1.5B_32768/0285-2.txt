Question:
Let $T$ be the set of all triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive integers for which there exist triangles with side lengths $a,$ $b,$ $c.$  Compute
\[\sum_{(a,b,c) \in T} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}.\]

Correct Answer:
For a triangle with side lengths $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ let $s = \frac{a + b + c}{2},$ and let
\begin{align*}
x &= s - a = \frac{-a + b + c}{2}, \\
y &= s - b = \frac{a - b + c}{2}, \\
z &= s - c = \frac{a + b - c}{2}.
\end{align*}By the Triangle Inequality, $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are all positive.  (This technique is often referred to as the Ravi Substitution.)  Note that
\begin{align*}
a &= y + z, \\
b &= x + z, \\
c &= x + y.
\end{align*}If $s$ is even, then $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are all positive integers.  So, we can set $x = i,$ $y = j,$ and $z = k,$ which gives us the parameterization $(a,b,c) = (j + k, i + k, i + j).$

If $s$ is odd, then $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are all of the form $n - \frac{1}{2},$ where $n$ is a positive integer.  So, we can set $x = i - \frac{1}{2},$ $y = j - \frac{1}{2},$ and $z = k - \frac{1}{2}.$  This gives us the parameterization $(a,b,c) = (j + k - 1, i + k - 1, i + j - 1).$

Thus, our sum is
\begin{align*}
\sum_{(a,b,c) \in T} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c} &= \sum_{i = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{2^{j + k}}{3^{i + k} 5^{i + j}} + \frac{2^{j + k - 1}}{3^{i + k - 1} 5^{i + j - 1}} \right) \\
&= \sum_{i = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{2^{j + k}}{3^{i + k} 5^{i + j}} + \frac{15}{2} \cdot \frac{2^{j + k}}{3^{i + k} 5^{i + j}} \right) \\
&= \frac{17}{2} \sum_{i = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{2^{j + k}}{3^{i + k} 5^{i + j}} \\
&= \frac{17}{2} \sum_{i = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{15^i} \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{2}{5} \right)^j \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^k \\
&= \frac{17}{2} \cdot \frac{1/15}{1 - 1/15} \cdot \frac{2/5}{1 - 2/5} \cdot \frac{2/3}{1 - 2/3} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{17}{21}}.
\end{align*}

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to compute the sum over all triples (a, b, c) of positive integers such that (a, b, c) are the sides of a triangle. The sum is given by (2^a)/(3^b 5^c). Hmm, okay.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. T is the set of all triples where a, b, c are positive integers forming a triangle. So, for each such triple, I need to compute (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) and sum them all up. That sounds a bit abstract, but perhaps I can break it down.

I know that for a set of three positive integers to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality. That is, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, for sides a, b, c, the following must hold:

1. a + b > c
2. a + c > b
3. b + c > a

These are the three conditions that must be satisfied for a, b, c to be sides of a triangle. So, for each triple (a, b, c), we have to include it in the sum only if all three inequalities are satisfied.

Looking at the exponents, it seems like the problem is asking for a generating function where each term is weighted by (2^a)/(3^b 5^c). So, I need to find the sum over all a, b, c such that (a, b, c) is a triangle.

Breaking it down, since each of a, b, c are positive integers, and they must satisfy the triangle inequalities, I might need to consider each inequality separately and find the ranges of a, b, c for which they hold.

But dealing with three inequalities directly might be complicated. Maybe I can find a way to express the sum as a product of individual sums, each corresponding to one inequality.

Let me think about how to approach this. Perhaps I can fix one of the variables and express the others in terms of it, then sum accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe I can use generating functions or some form of inclusion-exclusion to account for the triangle inequalities.

Wait, actually, I remember that in generating functions, when you have multiple conditions, you can represent them as products. So, maybe I can model each triangle inequality as a generating function and then combine them.

Let me try to formalize this idea. For each positive integer a, b, c, the term (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) is part of the sum. But only when a, b, c satisfy the triangle inequalities.

So, perhaps I can express the total sum as a triple sum, and then find a way to compute it by considering the constraints.

But triple sums can be tricky because they have three variables. Maybe I can rewrite the problem in terms of two variables by fixing one variable and expressing the others in terms of it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can separate the variables. Let me try to see if I can express the sum as a product of three separate sums, each corresponding to one variable, but considering the constraints.

Wait, that might not be straightforward because the triangle inequalities involve all three variables.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Since the problem is about triples that satisfy three inequalities, I can compute the total sum without restrictions and then subtract the sums that violate each inequality.

But inclusion-exclusion can get complicated with three inequalities, but maybe manageable.

Let me try that approach.

First, compute the total sum without considering the triangle inequalities. That would be the sum over all positive integers a, b, c of (2^a)/(3^b 5^c). Then, subtract the sums where a + b <= c, a + c <= b, or b + c <= a.

But wait, how do I compute the total sum without restrictions? It's a triple sum:

Total = sum_{a=1}^infty sum_{b=1}^infty sum_{c=1}^infty (2^a)/(3^b 5^c)

I can separate this into three separate geometric series.

First, sum over a: sum_{a=1}^infty (2^a) = 2 + 4 + 8 + ... = 2/(1 - 2) = -2. Wait, that's a divergent series. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I need to approach it differently.

Wait, actually, in the expression, the term is (2^a)/(3^b 5^c). So, if I separate variables, it's (2^a) * (1/3^b) * (1/5^c). So, the total sum is:

( sum_{a=1}^\infty 2^a ) * ( sum_{b=1}^\infty 1/3^b ) * ( sum_{c=1}^\infty 1/5^c )

Each of these is a geometric series.

Compute them:

sum_{a=1}^\infty 2^a = 2/(1 - 2) = -2, but this diverges. Wait, that can't be right because 2^a grows without bound, so the sum diverges.

Similarly, sum_{b=1}^\infty 1/3^b = (1/3)/(1 - 1/3) = 1/2

sum_{c=1}^\infty 1/5^c = (1/5)/(1 - 1/5) = 1/4

So, the total sum is (-2) * (1/2) * (1/4) = (-2) * (1/8) = -1/4

But this total is divergent because the sum over a is divergent. So, perhaps this approach isn't useful, as the total sum is divergent, but our original problem is a subset of that.

Wait, so maybe I can't compute the total sum in this way. Maybe instead of treating the sum as divergent, I need to compute the sum without considering triangle inequalities, then subtract the divergent terms, but that might not be helpful. Perhaps another approach is needed.

Let me think again. Maybe instead of trying to compute the entire sum, I can condition on the inequalities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model each coordinate a, b, c in the sum as independent variables with some constraints.

Wait, considering that a, b, c are positive integers forming a triangle, the triangle inequalities are a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a.

Given that a, b, c are positive integers, the smallest possible value for each is 1.

So, let's try to consider the possible values for each variable.

But since the inequalities involve all three variables, it's a bit tricky.

Perhaps I can fix one variable, say c, and then find the number of pairs (a, b) such that a, b, c form a triangle.

But in our case, the sum is weighted by (2^a)/(3^b 5^c). So, it's not just counting the number of triples but weighting each by a factor.

Wait, so perhaps I can write the sum as a triple sum:

Sum = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty sum_{c=1}^\infty (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) * I(a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a)

Where I is the indicator function which is 1 if the conditions hold, else 0.

But how can I compute this?

Alternatively, maybe I can use generating functions for each variable, considering the constraints.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: Since a, b, c are positive integers, perhaps I can express the sum as a product of generating functions, each corresponding to one variable, but with constraints.

Wait, for a single variable, say, a, it's just sum_{a=1}^\infty 2^a. But that diverges. Similarly for b and c.

But in our case, the variables are connected via the triangle inequalities. So, perhaps I need to find a way to represent the constraints as a product of generating functions.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the sum as a product of three geometric series, but each with coefficients adjusted by the triangle inequalities.

Wait, but the triangle inequalities involve all three variables, so that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a generating function with variables a, b, c, and then find the coefficient of x^a y^b z^c with certain relations.

Wait, that might be overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I can think in terms of probability. Each term (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) can be thought of as a probability distribution, and the sum is the expectation over the set T. But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of multiplicative functions and Dirichlet generating functions.

Wait, perhaps I need to change variables.

Suppose I fix c, then for each c, find the number of pairs (a, b) such that a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a, and then sum over a, b, c.

But since the terms are (2^a)/(3^b 5^c), perhaps it's better to fix c and then handle a and b.

So, for each c, sum over a, b such that a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a.

But then, for each c, the constraints on a and b are:

a + b > c,

a + c > b => b < a + c,

b + c > a => a < b + c.

So, for each c, a and b must satisfy:

max(c - b + 1, a + c - b) > something? Wait, maybe it's better to express the constraints in terms of inequalities.

Wait, actually, for fixed c, the conditions are:

1. a + b > c,

2. a + c > b => b < a + c,

3. b + c > a => a < b + c.

So, combining these, for fixed c, we have:

b > c - a,

b < a + c,

a < b + c,

and a, b, c are positive integers.

So, for each c, a ranges from 1 to infinity, and for each a, b must satisfy:

max(c - a + 1, a + 1) <= b <= min(a + c - 1, b_max)

Wait, perhaps I need to find for each c, the possible a and b.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to fix c and find the number of (a, b) pairs that satisfy the triangle conditions, then multiply by the term (2^a)/(3^b 5^c).

But the issue is that both a and b are variables here, so this might get complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a generating function where each term is weighted by (2^a)/(3^b 5^c), and find the coefficient of x^a y^b z^c such that a, b, c satisfy the triangle inequalities, but I don't know if that's feasible.

Wait, perhaps the key is to model this as a generating function where each variable is independent, but with certain constraints.

Wait, let me think about the exponent for each term. The term is (2^a)/(3^b 5^c). So, that can be rewritten as (2^a) * (1/3)^b * (1/5)^c.

So, for each term, we can think of it as a product of three separate factors: 2^a, (1/3)^b, (1/5)^c.

So, perhaps the entire sum can be written as a product of three separate sums:

( sum_{a=1}^\infty 2^a ) * ( sum_{b=1}^\infty (1/3)^b ) * ( sum_{c=1}^\infty (1/5)^c )

But wait, each of these sums separately diverges because 2^a, (1/3)^b, (1/5)^c are geometric series with ratios greater than 1 and less than 1, respectively.

But in our case, we need the sum over a, b, c such that a, b, c satisfy the triangle inequalities.

Wait, but if the individual sums diverge, how can we compute this? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.

Wait, another idea: Maybe instead of considering the entire sum, I can consider generating functions for each variable with constraints.

Wait, for variable a, the generating function would be sum_{a=1}^\infty 2^a x^a = 2x / (1 - 2x). Similarly, for b, it's (1/3) x / (1 - (1/3) x), and for c, it's (1/5) x / (1 - (1/5) x).

But then, how do I incorporate the triangle inequalities?

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem as a Markov chain or use some form of recursion.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the problem as a tree, where each node is a triple (a, b, c), and edges represent the triangle inequalities. But that might not be helpful.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of convolution. Since each term is a product of terms depending on a, b, c, perhaps the overall sum can be expressed as the product of generating functions, but with constraints.

Wait, but the triangle inequalities are not multiplicative, so that might not work.

Wait, another approach: Maybe to rewrite the sum in terms of some generating functions with constraints, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider using generating functions in a different way. Let me consider the generating function for each variable, with the constraints.

Wait, for each variable, perhaps I can express it as a sum with certain coefficients, and then multiply them together.

Wait, for example, for each variable a, the generating function is sum_{a=1}^\infty (2^a) x^{a} = 2x / (1 - 2x). Similarly, for b: ( (1/3) x ) / (1 - (1/3) x ). For c: ( (1/5) x ) / (1 - (1/5) x ). So, if I can find the generating function where a, b, c satisfy the triangle inequalities, maybe that's the answer.

But how do I incorporate the triangle inequalities into the generating function?

Wait, perhaps I can model this as the product of generating functions, with each generating function imposing the constraint for that variable.

But triangle inequalities relate all three variables, so that's a problem.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to subtract the cases where the triangle inequalities are violated.

So, total sum is sum_{a, b, c} (2^a)/(3^b 5^c).

From this, subtract the cases where a + b <= c, a + c <= b, or b + c <= a.

But then, the inclusion-exclusion would require computing the sums over a, b, c where each inequality is violated, and then adding back in the overlaps where two inequalities are violated, and subtracting the case where all three are violated.

So, let me try that approach.

Let me denote:

A: the set of triples where a + b <= c

B: the set where a + c <= b

C: the set where b + c <= a

So, the total sum S is equal to:

S = T - (|A| + |B| + |C|) + (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|) - |A ∩ B ∩ C|

Where T is the total sum over all a, b, c.

So, let's compute each part.

First, compute T, which is the total sum over all a, b, c:

T = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty sum_{c=1}^\infty (2^a)/(3^b 5^c)

We can separate this into three separate geometric series:

T = (sum_{a=1}^\infty 2^a) * (sum_{b=1}^\infty 1/3^b) * (sum_{c=1}^\infty 1/5^c)

Each of these is a geometric series:

sum_{a=1}^\infty 2^a = 2 + 4 + 8 + ... = 2/(1 - 2) = -2, but actually, this diverges.

Wait, that's a problem because 2^a grows without bound. So, the total sum T is divergent. So, subtracting T is not helpful because T itself is infinite.

But in our case, we're not subtracting T; we're subtracting the divergent parts from our desired sum. So, perhaps this approach isn't the way to go.

Wait, maybe I need to compute the sums over a, b, c where the triangle inequalities are violated, but since the total sum is divergent, perhaps the divergent parts will cancel out in the inclusion-exclusion.

But that seems complicated. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the sums where a + b <= c, a + c <= b, etc., without worrying about convergence.

But how?

Wait, for each inequality, say a + b <= c, we can compute the sum over a, b, c where a + b <= c.

Similarly for the other inequalities.

But then, since the variables are positive integers, a + b <= c would require that c >= a + b, so c must be at least 2 (since a, b >=1).

So, for each c >= 2, the number of (a, b) such that a + b <= c.

But for each fixed c, the number of pairs (a, b) with a + b <= c is equal to the number of integer solutions to a + b <= c with a, b >=1.

Which is equal to sum_{k=2}^c (k -1), since for each c, the number of pairs (a, b) such that a + b = k is k -1. So, the total number is sum_{k=2}^c (k -1) = sum_{m=1}^{c -1} m = (c -1)c / 2.

So, for each c, the number of (a, b) pairs is (c -1)c / 2.

But wait, in our problem, the term (2^a)/(3^b 5^c). So, for each c, the sum over a, b where a + b <= c of (2^a)/(3^b 5^c).

So, maybe we can write this as sum_{c=2}^\infty (1/5^c) * sum_{a=1}^{c -1} sum_{b=1}^{c - a} (2^a)/(3^b)

So, that would be sum_{c=2}^\infty (1/5^c) * sum_{a=1}^{c -1} (2^a) * sum_{b=1}^{c - a} (1/3^b)

Now, let's compute the inner sums.

First, let's compute sum_{b=1}^{c - a} (1/3^b). That's a geometric series with first term 1/3 and ratio 1/3, up to term (c - a).

So, sum_{b=1}^{c - a} (1/3^b) = (1/3) * (1 - (1/3)^{c - a}) / (1 - 1/3)) = (1/2) * (1 - (1/3)^{c - a})

Similarly, sum_{a=1}^{c -1} (2^a) = 2*(1 - 2^{c -1}) / (1 - 2) ) = 2*(1 - 2^{c -1}) / (-1) = 2^{c} - 2

Wait, let's verify that:

sum_{a=1}^{n} 2^a = 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + 2^n = 2(1 - 2^n)/(1 - 2) = 2*(2^n -1)/1 = 2^{n +1} - 2. Wait, hold on, that seems off.

Wait, no, more precisely, sum_{a=1}^n 2^a = 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2*(2^n -1)/(2 -1) ) = 2^{n +1} - 2.

Yes, that's correct.

So, sum_{a=1}^{c -1} 2^a = 2^{c} - 2.

So, putting it back into the expression:

sum_{c=2}^\infty (1/5^c) * (2^{c} - 2) * (1/2)*(1 - (1/3)^{c - a})

Wait, but hold on, we have a dependency on a. Wait, in the inner sum, we have sum_{b=1}^{c - a} (1/3^b) = (1/2)*(1 - (1/3)^{c - a})

But in the term, we have (2^a)/(3^b), and the sum over b is (1/2)*(1 - (1/3)^{c - a})

So, the term becomes:

sum_{c=2}^\infty (1/5^c) * (2^a)/(3^b) * sum_{b=1}^{c - a} (1/3^b)

Wait, no, actually, for each c, a varies from 1 to c -1, so for each c, the term is:

(1/5^c) * (2^{c} - 2) * (1/2) * (1 - (1/3)^{c - a})

But this expression is dependent on a, which complicates things because a is a variable that varies for each c. So, I can't separate the sums like that.

Hmm, maybe that approach is not the way to go.

Wait, perhaps I can fix a and compute the sum over c and b for each a.

Wait, for a fixed a, the term is (2^a)/(3^b 5^c). The constraints are a + b <= c, a + c <= b, and b + c <= a.

But these constraints are quite restrictive.

Let's consider the triangle inequalities:

1. a + b <= c

2. a + c <= b

3. b + c <= a

But let's consider if these can be satisfied simultaneously.

From 1 and 2:

From 1: c >= a + b

From 2: b >= a + c

Substituting c from 1 into 2: b >= a + (a + b) => b >= 2a + b => 0 >= 2a, which is impossible since a is a positive integer.

Similarly, any two of these inequalities would lead to a contradiction.

Hence, there are no triples (a, b, c) that satisfy all three triangle inequalities simultaneously. Therefore, the set T is empty?

Wait, but that can't be, because, for example, (1,1,1) is a triangle, but wait, (1,1,1): 1 + 1 > 1, which is true. So, (1,1,1) is a valid triangle.

Wait, hold on, (1,1,1): 1 + 1 > 1, 1 + 1 > 1, 1 + 1 > 1. So, yes, it is a valid triangle.

Similarly, (2,2,2) is a triangle, etc. So, actually, T is not empty. So, my earlier conclusion that no triples satisfy all three inequalities is incorrect.

Wait, so, if a, b, c satisfy all three triangle inequalities, then that's a valid triangle. So, (1,1,1) is valid, as is (2,2,2), etc.

So, my earlier conclusion that the triangle inequalities are contradictory is wrong because only one inequality is needed to define a triangle.

So, for a set of three positive integers to form a triangle, at least one of the triangle inequalities must hold, and the other two are redundant.

Therefore, the set T is all triples (a, b, c) where at least one of a + b > c, a + c > b, or b + c > a is satisfied.

So, to compute the sum over T, we can compute the sum over all triples (a, b, c) of (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) minus the sum over triples where none of the triangle inequalities are satisfied.

Wait, so that would be:

Total = sum_{a,b,c} (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) - sum_{a,b,c} [ (a + b <= c) OR (a + c <= b) OR (b + c <= a) ]

But since the set where a + b <= c, a + c <= b, or b + c <= a are mutually exclusive (as any two cannot hold simultaneously), we can write:

Total = sum_{a,b,c} (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) - (sum_{a,b,c where a + b <= c} (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) + sum_{a,b,c where a + c <= b} (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) + sum_{a,b,c where b + c <= a} (2^a)/(3^b 5^c))

So, now, if I can compute the total sum, and the three other sums, then subtract them.

But as we saw earlier, the total sum is divergent, so that might not help.

Wait, but let's see: The sum over all triples is divergent, but perhaps the divergent parts can be subtracted.

Wait, maybe we can think of it as:

Total = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty sum_{c=1}^\infty (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) - [ sum_{c=2}^\infty sum_{a=1}^{c-1} sum_{b=1}^{c - a} (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) + sum_{b=2}^\infty sum_{a=1}^{b -1} sum_{c=1}^{b - a} (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) + sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{b=1}^{a -1} sum_{c=1}^{a - b} (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) ]

But this seems quite complicated because each sum is still infinite.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps instead of directly computing the sum, we can model this using generating functions with constraints.

Wait, each term is (2^a)/(3^b 5^c). So, for each a, the generating function is 2^a x^a, and for b, it's (1/3)^b y^b, and for c, it's (1/5)^c z^c.

But we need to consider the constraints a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a.

Wait, so maybe the generating function is a sum over a, b, c, each term being (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) x^a y^b z^c, but with constraints on x, y, z.

But I'm not sure how to incorporate the triangle inequalities into the generating function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a product of generating functions, each with constraints.

Wait, for example, for each variable, the generating function is sum_{a=1}^\infty (2^a) x^a = 2x/(1 - 2x), but then I need to impose that a + b > c, which would require that c < a + b. Similarly for the other variables.

But this is getting too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think of this as a problem in three variables, each with a generating function that includes the triangle inequalities.

Wait, perhaps using generating functions with exponents, but I don't know.

Wait, maybe I can change variables to make the problem symmetric.

Wait, set u = a, v = b, w = c.

Wait, no, that's not helpful.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can express the sum as a product of three separate generating functions, each handling one variable, but then find a way to combine them with the triangle inequalities.

Wait, for example, for variable a, the generating function is sum_{a=1}^\infty 2^a x^a = 2x/(1 - 2x)

Similarly, for variable b, sum_{b=1}^\infty (1/3)^b y^b = (1/3)y / (1 - (1/3)y)

And for variable c, sum_{c=1}^\infty (1/5)^c z^c = (1/5)z / (1 - (1/5)z)

But to incorporate the triangle inequalities, perhaps we can set up a system where the product of these generating functions, with certain constraints, gives us the desired sum.

But I'm not sure how to combine them with the triangle inequalities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the principle of Möbius inversion or other combinatorial techniques.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to take a step back.

Wait, another idea: Since the triangle inequalities are a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a, perhaps we can fix one variable and express the others in terms of it.

Let me fix c. Then, the constraints become a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a.

But if we fix c, then a and b must satisfy:

a + b > c,

and

a < b + c,

b < a + c.

But since a and b are positive integers, perhaps I can express the sum over a and b for fixed c.

So, for fixed c, the sum over a and b is sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty [ a + b > c ] * (2^a)/(3^b 5^c )

Where [ a + b > c ] is 1 if a + b > c, else 0.

But how do I compute this?

Alternatively, for fixed c, the number of pairs (a, b) such that a + b > c, a < b + c, b < a + c.

But this is still complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Since the problem is about weighted sums over triples, maybe I can model it as a generating function in three variables, with coefficients given by (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) and conditions that a, b, c satisfy the triangle inequalities.

But this seems non-trivial.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the problem as a generating function in x, y, z, where x = 2, y = 1/3, z = 1/5, but I need to impose the triangle inequalities.

Wait, but it's unclear.

Wait, maybe I can use the generating function approach for each variable, considering the constraints.

Wait, for a, the constraint is a <= b + c - 1.

Wait, no, for each triple, a + b > c, so c < a + b.

Similarly, for b, c < a + b, so b < a + c.

Similarly, for a, c < a + b, so a < b + c.

Wait, so for each triple (a, b, c), all of a, b, c must be less than the sum of the other two.

So, each variable is less than the sum of the other two. So, for each variable, it's bounded by the sum of the other two.

But since a, b, c are positive integers, the maximum value for a is b + c - 1, similarly for b and c.

But again, this seems difficult to model.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of generating functions where each term is constrained by the sum of the other variables.

Wait, for example, for a, the number of (b, c) such that b + c > a.

Similarly, for b, the number of (a, c) such that a + c > b.

And for c, the number of (a, b) such that a + b > c.

Hmm, but how do I compute this?

Wait, perhaps I can model the generating function for each variable as follows:

For a, the generating function is sum_{a=1}^\infty x^{a} * [ sum_{b=1}^\infty y^b * [ sum_{c=1}^\infty z^c * (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) ] ]

But this seems too abstract.

Wait, perhaps considering generating functions for each pair (a, b), (a, c), (b, c) with constraints.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as a hypergraph problem, but that might not help.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can compute the sum as a triple sum, and express it in terms of geometric series, but with the triangle constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can express the sum as:

Sum = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty sum_{c=1}^\infty (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) * I(a + b > c) * I(a + c > b) * I(b + c > a)

Where I is the indicator function.

But how to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can split the sum based on the relative sizes of a, b, c.

Case 1: a >= b >= c

Case 2: a >= c >= b

Case 3: b >= a >= c

Case 4: b >= c >= a

Case 5: c >= a >= b

Case 6: c >= b >= a

But this approach seems too involved because of the number of cases.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the order of a, b, c, but since they are all symmetric in the sum, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe I can compute the sum over all a, b, c where a, b, c are distinct, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but this time for the product of generating functions with constraints.

But I don't know how to set that up.

Wait, perhaps I can think of each term as a product of three terms: (2^a)/(3^b 5^c), and the constraints as a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a.

But I don't see a straightforward way to model this.

Wait, maybe I can use generating functions with variables x, y, z, each representing a, b, c, and then set up equations that correspond to the triangle inequalities.

Wait, for example, the term (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) can be written as x^a y^{-b} z^{-c}.

Then, the constraints are a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a.

But I don't know how to model these inequalities in generating functions.

Wait, maybe we can write each of these as a generating function constraint.

For a + b > c: For each c, the sum over a, b where a + b > c is equal to sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty [a + b > c] x^a y^b z^c

Similarly for the other inequalities.

But how do I combine these?

Wait, perhaps the generating function for a + b > c is sum_{c=2}^\infty z^c sum_{a=1}^{c -1} sum_{b=1}^{c - a} x^a y^b

Similarly, the generating function for a + c > b is sum_{b=2}^\infty x^b sum_{a=1}^{b -1} sum_{c=1}^{b - a} y^c z^a

And the generating function for b + c > a is sum_{a=2}^\infty x^a sum_{b=1}^{a -1} sum_{c=1}^{a - b} y^b z^c

But then, the total generating function would be the product of these three generating functions.

Wait, but each of these generating functions is still infinite, so I don't see how to compute the product.

Wait, perhaps I can consider each of these generating functions separately:

Let me denote:

G1 = sum_{c=2}^\infty z^c sum_{a=1}^{c -1} sum_{b=1}^{c - a} x^a y^b

Similarly,

G2 = sum_{b=2}^\infty x^b sum_{a=1}^{b -1} sum_{c=1}^{b - a} y^c z^a

G3 = sum_{a=2}^\infty x^a sum_{b=1}^{a -1} sum_{c=1}^{a - b} y^b z^c

Then, the total generating function is G1 * G2 * G3.

But then, the coefficient of x^a y^b z^c in G1 * G2 * G3 would be the sum over all triples (a, b, c) of (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) * I(a + b > c) * I(a + c > b) * I(b + c > a)

Which is exactly the sum we want.

But computing G1 * G2 * G3 is still difficult because each G1, G2, G3 is a double infinite sum.

Wait, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for each G1, G2, G3.

Let's try to compute G1 first.

G1 = sum_{c=2}^\infty z^c sum_{a=1}^{c -1} sum_{b=1}^{c - a} x^a y^b

Let me first compute the inner sum over b:

sum_{b=1}^{c - a} y^b = y * (1 - y^{c - a}) / (1 - y)

So, G1 becomes:

sum_{c=2}^\infty z^c sum_{a=1}^{c -1} x^a * y * (1 - y^{c - a}) / (1 - y)

= (y / (1 - y)) sum_{c=2}^\infty z^c sum_{a=1}^{c -1} x^a (1 - y^{c - a})

= (y / (1 - y)) sum_{c=2}^\infty z^c [ sum_{a=1}^{c -1} x^a - sum_{a=1}^{c -1} x^a y^{c - a} ]

So, let's compute the two sums separately.

First sum:

sum_{a=1}^{c -1} x^a = x (1 - x^{c -1}) / (1 - x)

Second sum:

sum_{a=1}^{c -1} x^a y^{c - a} = y^{c -1} sum_{a=1}^{c -1} (x / y)^a = y^{c -1} * ( (x / y) (1 - (x / y)^{c -1}) ) / (1 - x / y )

= (x / y) y^{c -1} (1 - (x / y)^{c -1}) / (1 - x / y)

= x y^{c -2} (1 - (x / y)^{c -1}) / (1 - x / y )

So, putting back into G1:

G1 = (y / (1 - y)) sum_{c=2}^\infty z^c [ x (1 - x^{c -1}) / (1 - x) - x y^{c -2} (1 - (x / y)^{c -1}) / (1 - x / y) ]

Let me split this into two sums:

G1 = (y / (1 - y)) [ (x / (1 - x)) sum_{c=2}^\infty z^c (1 - x^{c -1}) - (x y^{ -2} / (1 - x / y)) sum_{c=2}^\infty z^c (1 - (x / y)^{c -1}) ]

Wait, let me compute each part.

First, compute S1 = sum_{c=2}^\infty z^c (1 - x^{c -1}) )

= sum_{c=2}^\infty z^c - sum_{c=2}^\infty x^{c -1} z^c

= z^2 / (1 - z) - z^2 / (1 - x z)

Similarly, compute S2 = sum_{c=2}^\infty z^c (1 - (x / y)^{c -1}) )

= sum_{c=2}^\infty z^c - sum_{c=2}^\infty (x / y)^{c -1} z^c

= z^2 / (1 - z) - z^2 / (1 - (x / y) z )

So, plugging back into G1:

G1 = (y / (1 - y)) [ (x / (1 - x)) (S1) - (x y^{-2} / (1 - x / y)) (S2) ]

= (y / (1 - y)) [ (x / (1 - x)) ( z^2 / (1 - z) - z^2 / (1 - x z) ) - (x y^{-2} / (1 - x / y)) ( z^2 / (1 - z) - z^2 / (1 - (x / y) z ) ) ]

This is getting very complicated. Maybe I need to simplify it step by step.

First, let's compute S1:

S1 = z^2 / (1 - z) - z^2 / (1 - x z) = z^2 [ 1 / (1 - z) - 1 / (1 - x z) ]

= z^2 [ (1 - x z - 1 + z) / (1 - z)(1 - x z) ) ]

= z^2 [ ( -x z + z ) / (1 - z)(1 - x z) ) ]

= z^2 [ z (1 - x) / (1 - z)(1 - x z) ) ]

= z^3 (1 - x) / (1 - z)(1 - x z )

Similarly, S2:

S2 = z^2 / (1 - z) - z^2 / (1 - (x / y) z )

= z^2 [ 1 / (1 - z) - 1 / (1 - (x / y) z ) ]

= z^2 [ (1 - (x / y) z - 1 + z ) / (1 - z)(1 - (x / y) z ) ]

= z^2 [ ( z - (x / y) z ) / (1 - z)(1 - (x / y) z ) ]

= z^2 [ z (1 - x / y ) / (1 - z)(1 - (x / y) z ) ]

= z^3 (1 - x / y ) / (1 - z)(1 - (x / y) z )

So, plugging back into G1:

G1 = (y / (1 - y)) [ (x / (1 - x)) * ( z^3 (1 - x) / (1 - z)(1 - x z ) ) - (x y^{-2} / (1 - x / y )) * ( z^3 (1 - x / y ) / (1 - z)(1 - (x / y) z ) ) ]

Simplify the first term inside the brackets:

(x / (1 - x)) * ( z^3 (1 - x) / (1 - z)(1 - x z ) ) = x z^3 / (1 - z)(1 - x z )

Similarly, the second term:

(x y^{-2} / (1 - x / y )) * ( z^3 (1 - x / y ) / (1 - z)(1 - (x / y) z ) ) = x y^{-2} z^3

So, G1 becomes:

G1 = (y / (1 - y)) [ x z^3 / (1 - z)(1 - x z ) - x y^{-2} z^3 ]

Factor out x z^3:

= (y / (1 - y)) * x z^3 [ 1 / (1 - z)(1 - x z ) - 1 / y^2 ]

But 1 / (1 - z)(1 - x z ) - 1 / y^2 is not straightforward to combine.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe I need to change tactics.

Wait, another idea: Since the problem is about weighted sums, perhaps I can use the concept of generating functions where each variable is weighted by a factor, and the constraints are incorporated.

Wait, for example, if I can write the generating function as a product where each term is (2 + 3 + 5 + ...), but only for triples that satisfy the triangle inequality.

But I don't know how to do that.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of generating functions with restrictions on the exponents.

Wait, for example, for the term (2^a)/(3^b 5^c), I can think of it as a generating function where a contributes 2^a, b contributes -3^b, and c contributes -5^c.

But I need to impose that a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a.

Hmm, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle on the generating functions.

Wait, perhaps the generating function for all triples is the product of three separate generating functions, each corresponding to one variable, but then I have to subtract the cases where the triangle inequalities are violated.

But I don't know how to compute that.

Wait, perhaps it's time to look for similar problems or known results.

I recall that for counting the number of triangles with sides a, b, c, the generating function would be sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty sum_{c=1}^\infty x^a y^b z^c, but again, this is divergent.

Wait, but if we consider the generating function with constraints, it's still difficult.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept from analytic number theory where the density of such triangles can be calculated, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can compute the sum over a, b, c where a, b, c are positive integers, and a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a.

So, let me think about the sum S = sum_{a, b, c >=1} (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) * I(a + b > c) * I(a + c > b) * I(b + c > a)

Where I is the indicator function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write S as:

S = sum_{a, b, c >=1} (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) * (I(a + b > c) * I(a + c > b) * I(b + c > a)).

But I don't know how to separate these conditions.

Wait, perhaps I can express each condition as a separate generating function and then combine them.

Wait, for example, the condition a + b > c can be written as sum_{c=1}^\infty sum_{a=1}^{c -1} sum_{b=1}^{c - a} (2^a)/(3^b 5^c )

Similarly, the other two conditions can be written, but it's still complex.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can consider the problem as a two-dimensional grid where each point (a, b, c) satisfies the triangle inequalities, and then compute the sum over this grid.

But I don't know how to do that.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of convolution or something similar.

Wait, perhaps it's time to consider that the sum is equal to the sum over all a, b, c of (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) times the probability that a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a.

But this is vague.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can fix a and b, and compute the possible c, then sum over a and b.

So, for fixed a, b, c must satisfy a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a.

So, c < a + b, and c < a + b - 2a, but no, that's not helpful.

Wait, more precisely, c must satisfy max(a - b, b - a) < c < a + b.

So, for fixed a, b, the number of c is (a + b - 1) - max(a - b, b - a) - 1 + 1.

Wait, not necessarily. Let me compute the lower and upper bounds.

From the triangle inequalities:

From a + b > c, c < a + b.

From a + c > b, c > b - a.

From b + c > a, c > a - b.

So, c must be in (max(a - b, b - a), a + b).

But since c is a positive integer, c ranges from max(a - b, b - a) + 1 to a + b - 1.

Wait, but a - b and b - a can be positive or negative.

So, if a >= b, then max(a - b, b - a) = a - b.

Similarly, if b >= a, then max(a - b, b - a) = b - a.

So, in either case, c must be in (|a - b|, a + b).

Thus, the number of c is (a + b - 1) - (|a - b|) = a + b - 1 - |a - b|.

For example, if a = b, then |a - b| = 0, so number of c is a + b - 1 - 0 = 2a -1.

If a = b + 1, then |a - b| = 1, so number of c is (2a - 1) - 1 = 2a - 2.

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, for a = b + 1:

max(a - b, b - a) = 1

So, c must be in (1, 2a -1) since a + b = 2a -1, so c < 2a -1.

Thus, c ranges from 2 to 2a -2, which is 2a - 3 terms.

But 2a - 3 = (2a -1) -1 -1 = 2a -3.

Wait, but according to our earlier formula, it's (a + b -1) - |a - b| = (2a -1) -1 = 2a -2.

Hmm, seems like a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, when a = b + 1:

Number of c is (a + b -1) - (a - b) = (2a -1) - (1) = 2a -2.

Which is correct, because c can be from 2 to 2a -2, which is 2a - 2 - 1 + 1 = 2a - 2.

Wait, no, wait: c ranges from 2 to 2a -2 inclusive.

Number of integers from m to n inclusive is n - m +1.

So, 2a -2 -2 +1 = 2a -3.

Wait, so that contradicts the earlier formula.

Wait, so perhaps the correct number of c is 2a - 3 when a = b + 1.

But according to my earlier formula, it's 2a -2.

Hence, my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (a + b -1) - max(a - b, b - a) -1.

Wait, let me try:

Number of c is (a + b -1) - max(a - b, b - a) -1 +1.

Wait, that's (a + b -1) - max(a - b, b - a) -1 +1 = (a + b -1) - max(a - b, b - a).

So, for a = b +1:

max(a - b, b - a) =1

Thus, number of c is (2a -1) -1 = 2a -2

But in reality, c ranges from 2 to 2a -2, which is 2a -3 numbers.

So, discrepancy of 1.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (a + b -1) - max(a - b, b - a) -1 +1 = (a + b -1) - max(a - b, b - a) -1 +1.

Wait, but when a = b +1, it's (2a -1) -1 -1 +1 = 2a -2.

Which is still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (a + b - max(a - b, b - a) -1)

But for a = b +1:

(a + b - max(a - b) -1) = (2a -1 -1 -1) = 2a -3.

Which is correct.

Similarly, for a = b:

(a + b - max(a - b) -1) = (2a -0 -1) = 2a -1.

Which matches.

So, perhaps the number of c is (a + b - max(a - b, b - a) -1).

Thus, the number of c is (a + b - |a - b| -1 ).

Which simplifies as:

If a >= b: (a + b - (a - b)) -1 = 2b -1

If b >= a: (a + b - (b - a)) -1 = 2a -1

So, in either case, number of c is 2*min(a, b) -1.

Wait, that makes sense.

Because when a >= b, then c must be between b +1 and a -1, so the number of c is (a -1) - b = a - b -1

Wait, but according to the formula, it's 2b -1.

Wait, wait, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, if a >= b, then c must be between b +1 and a -1, so c ranges from b +1 to a -1 inclusive.

So, the number of c is (a -1) - (b +1) +1 = a -1 - b -1 +1 = a - b -1

Similarly, if b >= a, c ranges from a +1 to b -1, so number of c is b -1 - (a +1) +1 = b - a -1

So, in both cases, the number of c is |a - b| -1.

Wait, but according to earlier thinking, it's 2*min(a, b) -1.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, for a = b +1, number of c is a - b -1 = 1 -1 = 0, which is not correct because when a = b +1, c can be from b +1 to a -1, which is just one value.

Wait, perhaps my formula is wrong.

Wait, when a = b +1, c must be in (b, a) = (b, b +1), so c can only be b +1, but a + b > c requires c < a + b, which is c < 2b +1, so c can be up to 2b.

Wait, no, if a = b +1, then a + b = 2b +1, so c < 2b +1.

But c must be greater than b (from a + c > b), so c >= b +1.

Thus, c can be from b +1 to 2b.

So, number of c is 2b - (b +1) +1 = b.

Wait, which is different from my previous formula.

Hmm, so my formula was incorrect.

So, the correct number of c is (a + b -1) - max(a - b, b - a) -1.

Wait, so let's compute that.

For a = b +1:

a + b -1 = (b +1) + b -1 = 2b

max(a - b, b - a) =1

So, number of c is 2b -1 -1 = 2b -2.

But when a = b +1, c must be from b +1 to 2b.

Number of c is 2b - (b +1) +1 = b.

Wait, so 2b -2 vs b.

Hmm, inconsiderate.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (a + b -1) - max(a - b, b - a) -1 +1.

Wait, that's (a + b -1) - max(a - b, b - a)

For a = b +1: 2b -1 -1 = 2b -2.

But number of c is b.

So, perhaps the correct formula is (a + b -1) - max(a - b, b - a) -1.

Which is 2b -1 -1 = 2b -2.

But this is inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider specific examples.

Let a = 2, b = 1.

Then, c must satisfy:

2 + 1 > c => c <3

2 + c >1 => c > -1 (always true)

1 + c >2 => c >1

So, c can be 2.

Thus, only one c: 2.

So, number of c is 1.

Similarly, for a = 3, b =1:

c must satisfy 3 +1 >c => c <4

3 + c >1 => c >-2 (always true)

1 + c >3 => c >2

Thus, c can be 3.

So, number of c is1.

For a =3, b=2:

c must satisfy 3 +2 >c => c <5

3 +c >2 => c >-1

2 +c >3 => c >1

So, c can be 2,3,4.

Number of c is3.

Wait, so for a=3,b=2, number of c is3.

Similarly, for a=4,b=2:

c must satisfy 4 +2 >c =>c <6

4 +c >2 => always true

2 +c >4 =>c >2

So, c can be3,4,5.

Number of c is3.

Wait, so seems like when a > b, the number of c is a - b -1.

Wait, for a=3, b=2: 3 -2 -1=0, but number of c is3.

Wait, no, not.

Wait, another way.

From a =3, b=2:

c must be greater than max(4 -2, 2 -3) = max(2, -1)=2

and less than a + b =5.

So, c=3,4.

Wait, but 3 + c >2, which is always true since c >=3.

Similarly, 2 + c >3, which is true since c >=3.

Wait, but 3 +3 >2: yes, 6>2.

But c must satisfy 3 +2 >c, so c <5.

Thus, c can be3,4.

So, number of c is2.

Wait, my previous calculation was wrong.

Wait, so c must be greater than 2 and less than5, so c=3,4: two values.

Similarly, for a=4, b=2:

c must be >2 and <6.

c=3,4,5.

Thus, number of c is3.

So, in this case, for a >= b, number of c is a - b -1.

Wait, for a=3, b=2: 3 -2 -1=0: but actual number is2.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, number of c is a - b -1 +1= a - b.

For a=3, b=2: a - b=1, but actual is2.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps number of c is a - b -1 +1= a - b.

Wait, for a=3, b=2:1, but actual is2.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: The number of c is (a + b -1) - max(a -b, b -a) -1.

For a=3, b=2:

(3 +2 -1) -1 -1 =4 -1 -1=2, which matches.

For a=4, b=2:

(4 +2 -1) -2 -1=5 -2 -1=2, which does not match the actual number of c=3.

Wait, so this formula seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (a + b -1 - max(a -b, b -a) -1) if a != b, else (a + b -1 - 0 -1) = a + b -2.

But for a=4, b=2: a + b -2=4, but actual number of c is3.

Thus, incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Number of c = (a + b -1) - max(a -b, b -a) -1.

But as we saw, for a=3, b=2, it works.

Wait, for a=4, b=2: (4 +2 -1) -2 -1=5 -2 -1=2, but actual is3.

Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (a + b -1 - max(a -b, b -a) -1 +1).

Wait, that would be (a + b -1 - max(a -b, b -a) -1 +1)= (a + b - max(a -b, b -a) -1).

Which is the same as before.

Thus, for a=4, b=2: (4 +2 -2 -1)=3, which matches.

Similarly, for a=3, b=2: (3 +2 -1 -1)=3, which matches.

Wait, but for a=2, b=1:

(2 +1 -1 -1)=1, which matches.

Wait, for a=5, b=3:

(5 +3 -3 -1)=4.

Is that correct?

a=5, b=3:

c must satisfy 5 +3 >c => c <8

5 +c >3 => always true

3 +c >5 => c >2

Thus, c=3,4,5,6,7.

Number of c=5.

But according to the formula, (5 +3 -3 -1)=4, which is incorrect.

So, this formula is wrong.

Wait, for a=5, b=3, number of c is5, but formula gives4.

Hmm, so it doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps my initial formula is wrong.

Wait, it seems that the correct number of c is |a - b| -1.

Wait, for a=3, b=2: |3 -2| -1=0, which is wrong.

Wait, no, that's not.

Wait, maybe it's (a + b -1) - max(a - b, b -a) -1 +1.

But that still doesn't give the correct result.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the range of c.

c must satisfy:

c > max(a - b, b - a)

and

c < a + b

Thus, the number of c is (a + b -1) - max(a - b, b - a) -1 +1 = (a + b -1) - max(a - b, b - a)

Which is what we had before.

But for a=5, b=3:

(5 +3 -1) -2=7 -2=5, which is correct.

Similarly, a=4, b=2:

(4 +2 -1) -2=5 -2=3, which is correct.

a=3, b=1:

(3 +1 -1) -2=3 -2=1, which is correct.

a=2, b=1:

(2 +1 -1) -1=2 -1=1, which is correct.

a=4, b=3:

(4 +3 -1) -1=6 -1=5, which is correct.

So, the formula seems to hold.

Thus, the number of c is (a + b -1) - max(a - b, b - a).

Which can be written as (a + b -1) - |a - b|

So, number of c = (a + b -1) - |a - b|

Which is equal to (a + b -1) - |a - b|.

So, that's the number of c for fixed a, b.

Thus, the total sum S can be written as:

S = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty [2^a / (3^b 5^c)] * I(a + b > c) * I(a + c > b) * I(b + c > a)

But with the number of c for fixed a, b given by (a + b -1) - |a - b|

So, S = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty [ (a + b -1) - |a - b| ] * (2^a)/(3^b 5^c)

But c is a variable, so for each a, b, c varies, and the number of c is (a + b -1) - |a - b|

Wait, but that is a function of a, b, and c.

Wait, perhaps I can rewrite S as:

S = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty ( (a + b -1) - |a - b| ) * (2^a)/(3^b) * sum_{c=1}^{a + b -1} 1/5^c

Because for each a, b, c is at most a + b -1.

Thus, sum_{c=1}^{a + b -1} 1/5^c = (1/5)(1 - (1/5)^{a + b -1}) / (1 - 1/5)) = (1/5)(1 - (1/5)^{a + b -1}) / (4/5) ) = (1/4)(1 - (1/5)^{a + b -1})

Thus, S becomes:

S = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty ( (a + b -1) - |a - b| ) * (2^a)/(3^b) * (1/4)(1 - (1/5)^{a + b -1})

But this can be written as:

S = (1/4) sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty ( (a + b -1) - |a - b| ) * (2^a)/(3^b) * (1 - (1/5)^{a + b -1})

But that still seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps we can split the term ( (a + b -1) - |a - b| ) into two separate terms.

Let me write:

( (a + b -1) - |a - b| ) = (a + b -1) - |a - b|

So, S = (1/4) sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty ( (a + b -1) - |a - b| ) * (2^a)/(3^b) * (1 - (1/5)^{a + b -1})

Let me denote this as:

S = (1/4) [ sum_{a,b} (a + b -1) * (2^a)/(3^b) * (1 - (1/5)^{a + b -1}) - sum_{a,b} |a - b| * (2^a)/(3^b) * (1 - (1/5)^{a + b -1}) ]

So, S = (1/4) [ S1 - S2 ]

Where S1 = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty (a + b -1) * (2^a)/(3^b) * (1 - (1/5)^{a + b -1})

and S2 = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty |a - b| * (2^a)/(3^b) * (1 - (1/5)^{a + b -1})

Let me compute S1 and S2 separately.

First, S1:

S1 = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty (a + b -1) * (2^a)/(3^b) * (1 - (1/5)^{a + b -1})

Let me split this into two sums:

S1 = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty (a + b -1) * (2^a)/(3^b) - sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty (a + b -1) * (2^a)/(3^b) * (1/5)^{a + b -1}

Let me compute the first part:

S1a = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty (a + b -1) * (2^a)/(3^b)

Similarly, the second part:

S1b = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty (a + b -1) * (2^a)/(3^b) * (1/5)^{a + b -1}

Compute S1a:

Note that (a + b -1) = sum_{k=1}^{a + b -1} 1

Thus, S1a = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty sum_{k=1}^{a + b -1} 1 * (2^a)/(3^b)

Which can be rewritten as:

S1a = sum_{k=1}^\infty sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty (2^a)/(3^b) * I(a + b >k)

Wait, but perhaps it's better to express as:

S1a = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty (a + b -1) * (2^a)/(3^b) = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty (a + b -1) * (2^a)/(3^b)

Let me make substitution m = a + b -1, then for each m >=1, the number of pairs (a, b) such that a + b = m +1 is (m) (since a can be from1 to m, b = m +1 -a).

So, S1a = sum_{m=1}^\infty m * (2^a)/(3^b) summed over a, b with a + b = m +1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to fix m = a + b -1, so m >=1.

Then, for each m, the number of (a, b) pairs is m.

Wait, no, for each m, a can range from1 to m, b = m +1 -a.

Thus, for each m, the sum over a and b is:

sum_{a=1}^m (2^a)/(3^{m +1 -a}) = (1/3^{m +1}) sum_{a=1}^m 2^a * 3^a = (1/3^{m +1}) sum_{a=1}^m (2*3)^a = (1/3^{m +1}) * ( (2*(3^m -1))/(3 -1) ) ) = (1/3^{m +1}) * ( (2*(3^m -1))/2 ) ) = (1/3^{m +1}) * (3^m -1 ) = (1/3) * (1 - 1/3^m )

Thus, S1a = sum_{m=1}^\infty m * (1/3)*(1 - 1/3^m ) = (1/3) sum_{m=1}^\infty m - (1/3) sum_{m=1}^\infty m / 3^m

But sum_{m=1}^\infty m is divergent, which suggests that S1a is divergent. But this can't be, because our original sum S is finite.

Wait, so perhaps my approach is flawed.

Wait, in S1a, the term (a + b -1) * (2^a)/(3^b) for a, b >=1.

I think I need to approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps using generating functions.

Wait, let me define G(a) = sum_{a=1}^\infty (2^a)/(3^a) = sum_{a=1}^\infty (2/3)^a = 2/3 / (1 - 2/3) = 2.

Similarly, G(b) = sum_{b=1}^\infty 1/3^b = 1/3 / (1 -1/3) = 1/2.

But we have (a + b -1) * (2^a)/(3^b) = (a + b -1) * (2^a)/3^b.

Hmm, perhaps think of it as (a + b -1) * (2^a)/3^b = sum_{k=1}^{a + b -1} (2^a)/3^b.

Wait, but that's similar to my earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps I can split the term (a + b -1) into a sum over k.

Therefore, S1a = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty sum_{k=1}^{a + b -1} (2^a)/(3^b)

Which can be rewritten as:

S1a = sum_{k=1}^\infty sum_{a=1}^{k} sum_{b=1}^{k - a +1} (2^a)/(3^b)

Wait, since a + b -1 =k implies b <= k - a +1.

Thus, S1a = sum_{k=1}^\infty sum_{a=1}^k (2^a)/(3^b) summed over b=1 to k -a +1.

Thus, S1a = sum_{k=1}^\infty sum_{a=1}^k (2^a)/(3^{k - a +1}) * (k -a)

Wait, because b runs from1 to k -a +1, which is (k -a +1) terms.

Thus, S1a = sum_{k=1}^\infty sum_{a=1}^k (2^a)/(3^{k - a +1}) * (k -a)

= sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/3^{k +1}) sum_{a=1}^k (2^a)*(k -a)

= (1/3^{k +1}) sum_{a=1}^k (2^a)*(k -a)

= (1/3^{k +1}) sum_{a=1}^k k 2^a - sum_{a=1}^k a 2^a

= (1/3^{k +1}) [k sum_{a=1}^k 2^a - sum_{a=1}^k a 2^a ]

= (1/3^{k +1}) [k (2^{k +1} -2) - (2^{k +2} -2^{k +1} + k 2^{k +1} - 2^{k +1}) ]

Wait, let me compute the sums:

sum_{a=1}^k 2^a = 2^{k +1} - 2

sum_{a=1}^k a 2^a = 2(2^{k +1} - (k +1)2^{k +2} + 2^{k +2}) ) ?

Wait, no, the formula for sum_{a=1}^n a r^a is r(1 - (n +1) r^n + n r^{n +1}) ) / (1 - r)^2.

So, in our case, r=2.

Thus, sum_{a=1}^k a 2^a = 2(1 - (k +1) 2^k + k 2^{k +1}) ) / (1 -2)^2 = 2(1 - (k +1)2^k + k 2^{k +1}) ) /1 = 2 - 2(k +1)2^k + 2(k +1)2^k = 2.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, that would imply that the sum is 2, which is not correct.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

sum_{a=1}^k a 2^a.

Let me denote this as S.

We have S = 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + k 2^k.

Multiply both sides by2:

2S = 4 + 8 + ... + (k +1)2^k

Subtract the original S:

2S - S = S = (4 + 8 + ... + (k +1)2^k) - (2 + 4 + ... + k 2^k) = (k +1)2^k - 2

Thus, S = (k +1)2^k -2.

Thus, sum_{a=1}^k a 2^a = (k +1)2^k -2.

Therefore, going back to S1a:

S1a = (1/3^{k +1}) [k (2^{k +1} - 2) - ((k +1)2^k - 2) ]

= (1/3^{k +1}) [2^{k +1}k - 2k - (k +1)2^k + 2 ]

= (1/3^{k +1}) [2^{k +1}k - (k +1)2^k - 2k + 2 ]

Simplify:

2^{k +1}k = 2k 2^k

(k +1)2^k = (k +1)2^k

Thus,

= (1/3^{k +1}) [2k 2^k - (k +1)2^k - 2k + 2 ]

= (1/3^{k +1}) [ (2k - k -1)2^k - 2k +2 ]

= (1/3^{k +1}) [ (k -1)2^k - 2k + 2 ]

= (1/3^{k +1}) [ (k -1)2^k - 2(k -1) ]

= (1/3^{k +1}) (k -1)(2^k - 2 )

= (k -1)(2^k -2)/3^{k +1}

Thus, S1a = sum_{k=1}^\infty (k -1)(2^k -2)/3^{k +1}

Similarly, for k=1, (k -1)=0, so the first term is0, and for k>=2, we have:

S1a = sum_{k=2}^\infty (k -1)(2^k -2)/3^{k +1}

Let me factor out 2:

= sum_{k=2}^\infty (k -1)(2^k -2)/3^{k +1} = sum_{k=2}^\infty (k -1)(2^k -2)/3^{k +1}

= sum_{k=2}^\infty (k -1)(2^k -2)/3^{k +1} = (1/3) sum_{k=2}^\infty (k -1)(2^k -2)/3^{k }

= (1/3) sum_{k=2}^\infty (k -1)(2^k)/3^{k } - (1/3) sum_{k=2}^\infty (k -1)*2 /3^{k }

= (1/3) [ sum_{k=2}^\infty (k -1)(2/3)^k - 2/3 sum_{k=2}^\infty (k -1)(2/3)^k ]

Let me denote T = sum_{k=2}^\infty (k -1)(2/3)^k

Thus, S1a = (1/3)(T - (2/3)T ) = (1/3)(T(1 - 2/3)) = (1/3)(T*(1/3)) = T/9

So, compute T:

T = sum_{k=2}^\infty (k -1)(2/3)^k = sum_{m=1}^\infty m (2/3)^{m +1} = (2/3) sum_{m=1}^\infty m (2/3)^m

We know that sum_{m=1}^\infty m x^m = x/(1 -x)^2.

Thus, sum_{m=1}^\infty m (2/3)^m = (2/3)/(1 - 2/3)^2 = (2/3)/(1/3)^2 = (2/3)/(1/9) = 6.

Thus, T = (2/3)*6 = 4.

Thus, S1a = T/9 = 4/9.

Wait, so S1a = 4/9.

Wait, that's a finite number. Hmm, so that's a relief.

Now, compute S1b:

S1b = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty |a - b| * (2^a)/(3^b) * (1 - (1/5)^{a + b -1})

Let me express |a - b| = |b - a|, so symmetric.

Let me consider the case where a >= b:

Then, |a - b| = a - b

Similarly, for the other case.

But due to symmetry, S1b = 2 * sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^{a -1} (a - b) * (2^a)/(3^b) * (1 - (1/5)^{a + b -1})

Hmm, so S1b = 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{b=1}^{a -1} (a - b) * (2^a)/(3^b) * (1 - (1/5)^{a + b -1})

Let me denote d = a - b, then d >=1.

Thus, S1b = 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{d=1}^{a -1} d * 2^a / 3^{a - d} * (1 - (1/5)^{a + (a - d) -1})

Simplify:

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{d=1}^{a -1} d * 2^a / 3^{a - d} * (1 - (1/5)^{2a - d -1})

Let me change variables: let m = a - d, so d = a - m.

Thus, when a= m + d, d=1 to m.

Thus, S1b = 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{m=1}^\infty (a - m) * 2^a / 3^{m} * (1 - (1/5)^{2a - m -1})

But a = m + d, so a can be written as m + d.

Thus, S1b = 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{m=1}^{a -1} (a - m) * 2^a / 3^{m} * (1 - (1/5)^{2a - m -1})

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps separate the terms:

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{m=1}^{a -1} (a - m) * (2^a)/(3^m) * (1 - (1/5)^{2a - m -1})

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{m=1}^{a -1} (a - m) * (2^a)/(3^m) - 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{m=1}^{a -1} (a - m) * (2^a)/(3^m) * (1/5)^{2a - m -1}

Let me handle each part separately.

First, S1b1 = 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{m=1}^{a -1} (a - m) * (2^a)/(3^m)

Let me denote s = a - m, so s >=1.

Let me change variables: let s = a - m, so m = a - s.

Thus, S1b1 = 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * (2^a)/(3^{a - s}) * (1 - (1/5)^{2a - (a - s) -1})

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * 2^a / 3^{a - s} * (1 - (1/5)^{a + s -1})

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * 2^a / 3^{a - s} * (1 - (1/5)^{a + s -1})

Wait, let me factor out 2^a / 3^{a - s} = 2^a * 3^{s - a} = (2/3)^{a - s} * 3^s

Thus,

S1b1 = 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * 2^a / 3^{a - s} * (1 - (1/5)^{a + s -1})

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * 2^a * (1/3)^{a - s} * (1 - (1/5)^{a + s -1})

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * 2^a * (1/3)^{a - s} * (1 - (1/5)^{a + s -1})

Let me write (1/3)^{a - s} = 3^{s - a} = 3^s / 3^a.

Thus,

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * 2^a / 3^s * (1/3^a) * (1 - (1/5)^{a + s -1})

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * (2^a / 3^a) * (1/3^s) * (1 - (1/5)^{a + s -1})

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/3)^a sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s / 3^s * (1 - (1/5)^{a + s -1})

Let me compute sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s / 3^s * (1 - (1/5)^{a + s -1})

= sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s / 3^s - sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s / 5^{a + s -1}

= sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s / 3^s - (1/5)^{a -1} sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s / 5^s

Let me denote T1 = sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s / 3^s and T2 = sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s / 5^s.

Thus, the expression becomes:

(2/3)^a (T1 - (1/5)^{a -1} T2 )

Thus, S1b1 = 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/3)^a (T1 - (1/5)^{a -1} T2 )

Similarly, compute S1b2 = 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * (2^a)/(3^m) * (1/5)^{2a - m -1}

Wait, no, S1b2 was:

2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{m=1}^{a -1} s * (2^a)/(3^m) * (1/5)^{2a - m -1}

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-examine.

Wait, S1b2 = 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{m=1}^{a -1} s * 2^a / 3^m * (1/5)^{2a - m -1} where s = a - m.

Let me change variables: let s = a - m, so m = a - s.

Thus, S1b2 = 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * 2^a / 3^{a - s} * (1/5)^{2a - (a - s) -1} = 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * 2^a / 3^{a - s} * (1/5)^{a + s -1}

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * 2^a / 3^{a - s} * (1/5)^{a} (1/5)^s

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * (2^a / 3^{a - s}) * (1/5)^{a} * (1/5)^s

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/3)^a (1/5)^a sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * (1/3)^s * (1/5)^s

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * (1/15)^s

= 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a (T3 - (1/15)^{a -1} )

Where T3 = sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * (1/15)^s

Thus, S1b2 = 2 * sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a (T3 - (1/15)^{a -1}) )

= 2 * [ sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a T3 - sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a (1/15)^{a -1} ]

= 2 * [ sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a T3 - sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a (1/15)^{a -1} ]

= 2 * [ sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a T3 - sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a (1/15)^{a -1} ]

Let me compute the second sum:

sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a (1/15)^{a -1} = sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a (1/15)^{a -1} = sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a (1/15)^{a -1} = sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a (1/15)^{a -1}.

Let me compute (2/15)^a (1/15)^{a -1} = (2/15) * (1/15)^{2a -1}

Wait, perhaps better to factor:

sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a (1/15)^{a -1} = sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15) * (1/15)^{a -1} * (1/15)^a = sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15) * (1/15)^{2a -1}

= (2/15) * sum_{a=2}^\infty (1/225)^a

= (2/15) * [ (1/225)^2 / (1 - 1/225) ) - (1/225)^1 / (1 - 1/225) ) ]

= (2/15) * [ (1/50625) / (224/225) - (1/225) / (224/225) ) ]

= (2/15) * [ 1/50625 * 225 / 224 - 1/225 * 225 / 224 ]

= (2/15) * [ 1/(50625 * 9) - 1/224 ]

= (2/15) * [ 1/455625 - 1/224 ]

But that seems complicated. Alternatively, compute it as:

sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a (1/15)^{a -1} = sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15)^a (1/15)^{a -1} = sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15) * (1/15)^{a -1} * (1/15)^a = sum_{a=2}^\infty (2/15) * (1/225)^a

= (2/15) * sum_{a=2}^\infty (1/225)^a = (2/15) * [ (1/225)^2 / (1 - 1/225) ) - (1/225) / (1 - 1/225) ) ]

= (2/15) * [ (1/50625) / (224/225) - (1/225) / (224/225) ) ]

= (2/15) * [ (1/50625) * 225 / 224 - 1 / 224 ) ]

= (2/15) * [ (1/225) / 224 - 1 / 224 ) ]

= (2/15) * [ (1 - 1/225) / 224 ) ]

= (2/15) * (224/225) / 224 )

= (2/15) * (1/225 )

= 2 / (15 * 225 ) = 2 / 3375

Similarly, T3 = sum_{s=1}^{a -1} s * (1/15)^s

This can be expressed as T3 = sum_{s=1}^{infty} s * (1/15)^s - sum_{s=a}^\infty s * (1/15)^s

But T3 is finite for each a.

But this seems too involved.

Given the complexity of S1b2, and knowing that S1b is quite involved, and considering that S1a was manageable, perhaps my initial approach to split the problem is not the most efficient.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps it's time to look for another approach or refer to known formulas.

Wait, I recall that for positive integers a, b, c, the number of solutions to a + b > c is related to the number of triangles, but in our case, c is a positive integer, and a, b are positive integers.

Wait, but in our case, c must satisfy a + b > c, so for each c, the number of (a, b) pairs is (c + 1)(c + 2)/2 - something.

Wait, no, actually the number of pairs (a, b) where a + b > c is equal to the number of pairs where a >=1, b >=1, a + b > c.

Which is equal to the total number of pairs minus the number of pairs where a + b <= c.

The total number of pairs (a, b) is infinite, but for c fixed, the number is finite.

But in our case, the sum is over all (a, b, c) in positive integers with a + b > c.

But the sum we're computing is:

S = sum_{(a, b, c)} [ (2^a)/(3^b) * 1/(5^c) * I(a + b > c) ]

Where I(a + b > c) is 1 if a + b > c, 0 otherwise.

But this is a triple sum, which is difficult to compute directly.

Alternatively, perhaps changing variables.

Let me define d = c - (a + b). However, since a + b > c, we have d >=1. Thus, c = a + b - d, where d >=1.

Thus, substituting:

S = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty sum_{d=1}^\infty [ (2^a)/(3^b) * 1/(5^{a + b - d}) ] * I(a + b > a + b - d) which is always true.

Wait, but a + b > c = a + b - d implies d >0, which is already our case.

Thus, S = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty sum_{d=1}^\infty (2^a)/(3^b) * 1/(5^{a + b - d})

= sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty (2^a)/(3^b) * sum_{d=1}^\infty 1/(5^{a + b - d})

= sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty (2^a)/(3^b) * sum_{d=1}^\infty 1/5^{a + b - d}

But sum_{d=1}^\infty 1/5^{a + b - d} = sum_{k=0}^\infty 1/5^{a + b - (k +1)} } = sum_{k=0}^\infty 1/5^{(a + b) -k -1} } = (1/5)^{a + b -1} * sum_{k=0}^\infty (1/5)^{-k} } = (1/5)^{a + b -1} * 5.

Thus, sum_{d=1}^\infty 1/5^{a + b - d} = 5/(5^{a + b -1}) ) = 5^{1 - (a + b)}.

Thus, S = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty (2^a)/(3^b) * 5^{1 - (a + b)}.

= 5 * sum_{a=1}^\infty (2^a)/5^a * sum_{b=1}^\infty 1/3^b * 5^{-b}.

Because 5^{1 - (a + b)} = 5 * (2/5)^a * (1/3 * 1/5)^b

Thus, S = 5 * sum_{a=1}^\infty (2/5)^a * sum_{b=1}^\infty (1/(3*5))^b

= 5 * [ sum_{a=1}^\infty (2/5)^a ] * [ sum_{b=1}^\infty (1/15)^b ]

Compute each sum:

sum_{a=1}^\infty (2/5)^a = (2/5)/(1 - 2/5) )= (2/5)/(3/5) )= 2/3.

Similarly, sum_{b=1}^\infty (1/15)^b = (1/15)/(1 - 1/15) )= (1/15)/(14/15) )= 1/14.

Thus, S = 5 * (2/3) * (1/14) )= 5 * (2)/(3*14) )= 5 * (1)/(21) )= 5/21.

Therefore, the original sum S is equal to 5/21.

Wait, but wait, let me confirm the steps.

We had S = sum_{a, b, c} [2^a/(3^b) 1/(5^c) I(a + b > c) ].

We changed variables with d = c - (a + b), which led to d >=1, and thus c = a + b - d.

Thus, S = sum_{a, b, d} [2^a/(3^b) 1/(5^{a + b - d}) ].

Then, sum_{d=1}^\infty 1/5^{a + b - d} = 5/(5^{a + b -1}).

Thus, S = 5 sum_{a, b} [ (2^a)/(3^b) * 5^{-a - b +1} ].

But (2^a)/(3^b) * 5^{-a - b +1} = (2^a)/(3^b) * 5 * (1/5)^{a + b}.

Thus, S = 5 * sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=1}^\infty (2^a)/(3^b) (1/5)^{a + b}.

= 5 * [ sum_{a=1}^\infty (2/5)^a ] * [ sum_{b=1}^\infty (1/3 * 1/5)^b ].

= 5 * [ (2/5)/(1 - 2/5) ] * [ (1/15)/(1 - 1/15) ]

= 5 * [ (2/5)/(3/5) ] * [ (1/15)/(14/15) ]

= 5 * (2/3) * (1/14 )

= 5 * (2)/(42) )= 5/21.

Yes, that seems correct.

Thus, the original sum S is equal to 5/21.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{5}{21}}
</think>

To find the sum of all positive integer triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the inequality \(a + b > c\), we can transform the problem into a geometric interpretation in the coordinate plane. 

1. **Transform the variables**:
   - Let \(x = 2^a\), \(y = 3^b\), and \(z = 5^c\).
   - The inequality \(a + b > c\) translates to \(\log_2 x + \log_3 y > \log_5 z\).

2. **Change of variables**:
   - Let \(a' = \log_2 x\), \(b' = \log_3 y\), and \(c' = \log_5 z\).
   - The inequality becomes \(a' + b' > c'\).

3. **Geometric interpretation**:
   - The problem reduces to finding the sum of \(x / y\) over all triples \((x, y, z)\) such that \(x + y > z\).
   - This is transformed into a geometric series in three dimensions.

4. **Summing the series**:
   - The sum can be expressed as \(S = \sum_{a, b, c} \frac{2^a}{3^b} \cdot \frac{1}{5^c} \cdot I(a + b > c)\).
   - By changing variables and using geometric series, we find that the sum simplifies to \(S = 5 \sum_{a, b} \left( \frac{2}{5} \right)^a \left( \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \right)^b\).

5. **Final computation**:
   - Compute the geometric series sums:
     - \(\sum_{a=1}^\infty \left( \frac{2}{5} \right)^a = \frac{2/5}{1 - 2/5} = \frac{2}{3}\).
     - \(\sum_{b=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{15} \right)^b = \frac{1/15}{1 - 1/15} = \frac{1}{14}\).
   - Multiply the results by the factor 5:
     - \(S = 5 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{14} = \frac{5}{21}\).

Thus, the sum of all positive integer triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the inequality \(a + b > c\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{5}{21}}\).
