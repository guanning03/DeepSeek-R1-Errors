Question:
Evaluate
\[\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4).\]

Correct Answer:
From the angle addition and subtraction formulas,
\begin{align*}
\sin (x + y) &= \sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y, \\
\sin (x - y) &= \sin x \cos y - \cos x \sin y,
\end{align*}so
\begin{align*}
\sin (x + y) \sin (x - y) &= (\sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y)(\sin x \cos y - \cos x \sin y) \\
&= \sin^2 x \cos^2 y + \sin x \cos x \sin y \cos y - \sin x \cos x \sin y \cos y - \cos^2 x \sin^2 y \\
&= \sin^2 x (1 - \sin^2 y) - (1 - \sin^2 x) \sin^2 y \\
&= \sin^2 x - \sin^2 x \sin^2 y - \sin^2 y + \sin^2 x \sin^2 y \\
&= \sin^2 x - \sin^2 y.
\end{align*}Taking $x = \arcsin 0.5$ and $y = \arcsin 0.4,$ we get
\begin{align*}
\sin (\arcsin 0.5 + \arcsin 0.4) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4) &= \sin^2 (\arcsin 0.5) - \sin^2 (\arcsin 0.4) \\
&= 0.5^2 - 0.4^2 \\
&= 0.09 = \boxed{\frac{9}{100}}.
\end{align*}

Gold:

Wrong Prediction:
-\frac{9}{100}

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: evaluate the expression

\[
\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4).
\]

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it will make more sense. Let me try to remember some trigonometric identities and properties that might help me here.

First, I recall that there's a sine addition formula:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]

And similarly, the sine subtraction formula:

\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B
\]

So, maybe I can apply these formulas to both terms inside the sine functions in the original expression.

Let me denote:

\( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \).

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B)
\]

If I apply the addition and subtraction formulas, I can rewrite each sine term:

First, \( \sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B \).

Second, \( \sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B \).

So, if I multiply these two together, I get:

\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B)
\]

Hmm, that looks like a difference of squares, right? So, \( (x + y)(x - y) = x^2 - y^2 \). Applying that here:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
\sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B
\]

Okay, so now I have an expression that's entirely in terms of sine and cosine of A and B, where A and B are known as \( \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( \arcsin 0.5 \). I think I can compute \( \sin A \), \( \cos A \), \( \sin B \), and \( \cos B \) because they are directly related to the arcsin values.

Given that \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \), that means \( \sin A = 0.4 \). To find \( \cos A \), I can use the identity \( \sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1 \). So,

\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84}
\]

Similarly, for \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \), we have \( \sin B = 0.5 \). So,

\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75}
\]

Alright, so now I can plug these back into the expression:

\[
\sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B = (0.4)^2 \cdot (\sqrt{0.75})^2 - (\sqrt{0.84})^2 \cdot (0.5)^2
\]

Calculating each term separately.

First term: \( (0.4)^2 \cdot (\sqrt{0.75})^2 \).

Compute \( (0.4)^2 = 0.16 \).

Compute \( (\sqrt{0.75})^2 = 0.75 \).

So, first term is \( 0.16 \cdot 0.75 \).

Let me calculate that: 0.16 * 0.75.

Well, 0.16 * 0.75 can be thought as 16 * 75 = 1200, and then since both are two decimal places, we have 1200 / 10000 = 0.12.

So first term is 0.12.

Second term: \( (\sqrt{0.84})^2 \cdot (0.5)^2 \).

Compute \( (\sqrt{0.84})^2 = 0.84 \).

Compute \( (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \).

So, second term is \( 0.84 \cdot 0.25 \).

Calculating that: 0.84 * 0.25.

Well, 0.84 * 0.25 is the same as 0.84 / 4, which is 0.21.

So, the second term is 0.21.

Putting it all together:

First term - second term = 0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09.

Wait, so the entire expression simplifies to -0.09? Hmm, that seems a bit odd because the original expression is a product of two sines, which should be positive? Or is it?

Wait, actually, let's think about it. Since A and B are both arcsin values, they are in the range of \( -\pi/2 \) to \( \pi/2 \), so their sine and cosine are positive. So, both \( \sin A \) and \( \cos A \) are positive, and \( \sin B \) and \( \cos B \) are positive as well.

But wait, in our case, A and B are both positive angles because arcsin of positive numbers is positive. So, both \( \sin A \) and \( \sin B \) are positive, and so are \( \cos A \) and \( \cos B \).

Therefore, in the expression \( \sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B \), both terms are positive, but perhaps the second term is larger, leading to a negative result. So, -0.09 is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the sign somewhere.

Wait, let's double-check.

I expanded the product \( (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B) \) as \( \sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B \). That seems correct because it's the difference of squares.

So, that gives me \( \sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B \).

Which is equal to \( \sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B \).

Yes, that's correct. So, substituting the values, we get 0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09.

So, the value is -0.09. But wait, the problem is asking for a numerical value, right? So, is -0.09 the answer?

Wait, but let's think again. Maybe that's correct, but is there a possibility of a mistake in the expansion?

Let me go back to the beginning.

We have:

\( \sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) \).

We expanded it as \( \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B \) multiplied by \( \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B \), which is indeed \( \sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B \). So that seems correct.

So, if I compute that, as I did earlier, it's 0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09.

But wait, maybe I should compute the numerical values differently, to see if I get the same result.

Let me compute \( \sin(A + B) \) and \( \sin(A - B) \) separately, then multiply them together.

Alternatively, maybe that's another way.

But perhaps, since we have the same answer, maybe it's correct.

Wait, but let's see. Alternatively, maybe using another identity.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the identity for sine of sum and difference, but perhaps it's simpler to proceed as above.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the angles numerically, add them, take sine, subtract the angles, take sine, and then multiply.

Wait, let me try that approach as a check.

First, compute \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \).

So, \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \). Let's compute that in degrees or radians? Maybe in degrees for easier understanding.

But perhaps I can compute the value numerically.

Wait, but I don't have a calculator here, but maybe I can approximate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the sine addition formula as above.

Wait, but in any case, let's see.

Alternatively, since both \( A \) and \( B \) are known, maybe we can compute the numerical values.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to note that the product \( \sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) \) can be expressed as \( \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B \cdot \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B \). Wait, that might complicate more.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using complex numbers.

Wait, but maybe not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the identity for product of sines.

Wait, there's an identity for \( \sin \alpha \sin \beta \) in terms of sum and difference, but in this case, it's \( \sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) \), which is similar to \( \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B \). Wait, is that so?

Wait, no, \( \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B = ( \sin(A + B) )( \sin(A - B) ) \). So, yes, that's exactly the expression we have.

Wait, so that's another way to write it. So, it's equal to \( \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B \).

So, perhaps we can compute \( \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B \).

Given that \( \sin A = 0.4 \), so \( \sin^2 A = 0.16 \).

Similarly, \( \sin B = 0.5 \), so \( \sin^2 B = 0.25 \).

Thus, \( \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B = 0.16 - 0.25 = -0.09 \).

So, that gives the same result as before, which is -0.09.

So, either way, whether I calculate it through expanding the product or through using the identity \( \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B \), I get -0.09.

Therefore, the value of the expression is -0.09.

But wait, the problem is presented as:

\[
\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4).
\]

Which is equal to \( \sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (A - B) \), which is equal to \( \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B \), which is -0.09.

Thus, the answer is -0.09.

But to confirm, let me check my calculations once more.

Compute \( \sin^2 A = 0.4^2 = 0.16 \).

Compute \( \sin^2 B = 0.5^2 = 0.25 \).

Subtract: 0.16 - 0.25 = -0.09.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if I compute \( \sin(A + B) \) and \( \sin(A - B) \) separately and multiply them, perhaps that would also yield the same result.

Let's try that.

First, compute \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \), \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \).

Then, \( A + B = \arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5 \), and \( A - B = \arcsin 0.4 - \arcsin 0.5 \).

Compute \( \sin(A + B) \) and \( \sin(A - B) \).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas:

\( \sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = 0.4 \cdot \sqrt{0.75} + \sqrt{0.84} \cdot 0.5 \).

Compute each term:

First term: 0.4 * sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.4 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.3464.

Second term: sqrt(0.84) ≈ 0.9165 * 0.5 ≈ 0.4583.

So, sin(A + B) ≈ 0.3464 + 0.4583 ≈ 0.8047.

Similarly, \( \sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B = 0.4 * sqrt(0.75) - sqrt(0.84) * 0.5 \).

Compute:

First term: 0.4 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.3464.

Second term: 0.9165 * 0.5 ≈ 0.4583.

So, sin(A - B) ≈ 0.3464 - 0.4583 ≈ -0.1119.

Therefore, multiplying sin(A + B) * sin(A - B) ≈ 0.8047 * (-0.1119) ≈ -0.0905.

Which is approximately -0.09, consistent with the previous result.

So, that seems to confirm that the exact value is -0.09.

Therefore, the answer is -0.09.

But wait, the problem didn't specify whether the answer should be in decimal or fractional form. Since 0.09 is 9/100, which is 0.09, so perhaps we can write it as -9/100.

But, in the initial computation, we had -0.09, which is equal to -9/100.

So, both -0.09 and -9/100 are correct. However, since the problem is given in decimal form, perhaps it's better to write it as a decimal.

Alternatively, if we can write it as a fraction, it's -9/100.

But since the numerical value is -0.09, which is exact, unless we approximate, but in this case, since the inputs were exact (0.4 and 0.5), I suppose the answer is exact.

Wait, but actually, the 0.4 and 0.5 are exact, but their arcsin would result in angles with trigonometric function values that could be irrational or exact.

But in any case, the exact value is -0.09, which is -9/100.

So, I think the answer is -9/100, which is -0.09.

Hence, the value of the expression is -0.09.

But wait, hold on a second. The problem is written as:

\[
\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4).
\]

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of subtraction. The second sine term is sin(arcsin 0.5 - arcsin 0.4), which is sin(B - A), which is equal to sin(A - B) because sine is an odd function. So, sin(B - A) = -sin(A - B). So, is that correct?

Wait, let me check:

sin(B - A) = sin(-(A - B)) = -sin(A - B). So, correct.

Therefore, sin(A - B) is equal to -sin(B - A). Therefore, the two terms are sin(A + B) and sin(A - B) = -sin(B - A). So, their product is -sin(A + B) sin(B - A). But in this case, the product is sin(A + B) * sin(A - B) = sin(A + B)*(-sin(B - A)).

But wait, in the original expression, it's sin(A + B) * sin(A - B) = sin^2 A - sin^2 B, which is -0.09 as before.

Alternatively, if we write it as sin(A + B) * sin(A - B) = sin(A + B) * (-sin(B - A)).

But regardless, the product is sin^2 A - sin^2 B, which is -0.09.

So, the sign is correct.

Therefore, I think my conclusion is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a positive value? Wait, but in the original expression, it's a product of two sines. Depending on the angle measures, one could be positive and the other negative, leading to a negative product.

But let me verify.

Compute \( \arcsin 0.5 \) is 30 degrees, and \( \arcsin 0.4 \) is approximately 23.578 degrees.

So, \( A + B = 23.578 + 30 ≈ 53.578 degrees \), and \( A - B = 23.578 - 30 ≈ -6.422 degrees \).

Compute sin(53.578 degrees) is sin(arcsin 0.8) which is 0.8. Wait, no, that's not.

Wait, wait. Wait, 53.578 degrees is arcsin(0.8), because sin(53.578) ≈ 0.8.

Wait, 0.4 and 0.5 are the sine values, not the cosine.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, let me compute \( \arcsin 0.4 \) first.

So, \( \arcsin 0.4 \) is approximately 23.578 degrees, as arcsin(0.4) ≈ 23.578 degrees.

Similarly, \( \arcsin 0.5 \) is 30 degrees.

So, A + B ≈ 23.578 + 30 = 53.578 degrees.

Compute sin(53.578 degrees). Since sin(53.578) ≈ 0.8, as 0.5 and 0.8 are related to 3-4-5 triangle.

Similarly, A - B ≈ 23.578 - 30 = -6.422 degrees.

Compute sin(-6.422 degrees) ≈ -0.1119.

So, sin(A + B) * sin(A - B) ≈ 0.8 * (-0.1119) ≈ -0.09, which is approximately -0.09, which is what I got before.

Therefore, in degrees, the product is approximately -0.09.

So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, if I had used radians, but 0.4 and 0.5 are in sine, which are dimensionless, so the angles are in radians.

But in this case, the result is consistent.

So, I think my previous conclusion is correct.

Therefore, the value of the expression is -0.09, which is equal to -9/100.

Hence, the answer is \boxed{-\dfrac{9}{100}}.

Wait, but in the question, it's written as:

\[
\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4).
\]

I wonder if the problem expects an exact value or a decimal approximation.

Since 0.4 and 0.5 are exact, and arcsin values are exact, but their sines are exact, but the angles themselves are not standard angles, so the result is exact, so -9/100 is the exact value, and -0.09 is the approximate decimal.

But, in mathematical problems, it's often acceptable to write fractions rather than decimals, especially when the exact form is possible.

Therefore, -9/100 is better, which is -0.09.

Hence, the final answer is \boxed{-\dfrac{9}{100}}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-\dfrac{9}{100}}
</think>

To evaluate the expression

\[
\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4),
\]

we start by denoting \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \). This allows us to rewrite the expression as:

\[
\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B).
\]

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B.
\]

Multiplying these two expressions together, we get:

\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B).
\]

This is a difference of squares, which simplifies to:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2.
\]

We know that \( \sin A = 0.4 \), \( \cos A = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} \), \( \sin B = 0.5 \), and \( \cos B = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} \). Substituting these values in, we get:

\[
(0.4)^2 \cdot (\sqrt{0.75})^2 - (\sqrt{0.84})^2 \cdot (0.5)^2.
\]

Calculating each term separately:

1. \( (0.4)^2 \cdot (\sqrt{0.75})^2 = 0.16 \cdot 0.75 = 0.12 \).
2. \( (\sqrt{0.84})^2 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 0.84 \cdot 0.25 = 0.21 \).

Subtracting these results:

\[
0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09.
\]

Thus, the value of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{-\dfrac{9}{100}}.
\]
