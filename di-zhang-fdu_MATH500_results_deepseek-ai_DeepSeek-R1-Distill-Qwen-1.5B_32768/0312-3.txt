Question:
You have seven bags of gold coins. Each bag has the same number of gold coins. One day, you find a bag of 53 coins. You decide to redistribute the number of coins you have so that all eight bags you hold have the same number of coins. You successfully manage to redistribute all the coins, and you also note that you have more than 200 coins. What is the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins?

Correct Answer:
If there are $b$ gold coins in each of the original 7 bags, then $7b+53$ is divisible by 8. In other words, $7b + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$. Since $53 \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$ and $7 \equiv -1 \pmod{8}$, we have that $-b \equiv -5 \pmod{8}$. Multiplying both sides by $-1$, we get that $b \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$. Now, we want $7b + 53 > 200$, so as a result, $b > \frac{200-53}{7} \implies b > 21$. Therefore, we want an integer greater than 21 which leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 8. The least such integer is 29, so you had $29 \cdot 7 = \boxed{203}$ coins before finding the bag of 53 coins.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here about seven bags of gold coins. Each bag has the same number of coins. Then I find another bag with 53 coins, and I redistribute all my coins so that the eight bags I now hold all have the same number of coins. I end up with more than 200 coins. I need to find the smallest number of coins I could have had before finding that bag of 53 coins.

Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. First, there are seven bags, each with the same number of coins. Let me denote the number of coins in each of these seven bags as \( x \). So, the total number of coins I initially have is \( 7x \).

Then, I find a bag with 53 coins. That means my new total number of coins is \( 7x + 53 \).

Now, I redistribute all these coins into eight bags, each with the same number of coins. So, the total number of coins is now \( 7x + 53 \), and this total needs to be divisible by 8 because I'm putting the same number into each of the eight bags.

So, mathematically, I can write this as:

\[
7x + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}
\]

Which means:

\[
7x + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}
\]

I need to find the smallest \( x \) such that this congruence holds, and also that the total number of coins after redistribution, which is \( \frac{7x + 53}{8} \), is more than 200.

Wait, actually, the problem says I have more than 200 coins after redistribution. So, \( \frac{7x + 53}{8} > 200 \). So, that might be another condition I need to satisfy.

So, let me jot down the two key equations:

1. \( 7x + 53 \) must be divisible by 8, so \( 7x + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \).
2. \( \frac{7x + 53}{8} > 200 \).

I need to find the smallest \( x \) satisfying both conditions.

Let me start with the first condition: \( 7x + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \).

I can simplify this congruence. First, let's note that 7 and 8 are coprime, so 7 has an inverse modulo 8. Let me compute the inverse of 7 mod 8.

We know that 7 * 7 = 49, which is 1 mod 8, so 7 is its own inverse modulo 8. So, multiplying both sides by 7:

\( 7*7x + 7*53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \)
\( 49x + 371 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \)
But since 49 is 1 mod 8 and 371 divided by 8 is 46 with a remainder of 3, so:

\( x + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \)
Therefore, \( x \equiv -3 \pmod{8} \), which is the same as \( x \equiv 5 \pmod{8} \).

So, \( x = 8k + 5 \) for some integer \( k \geq 0 \).

Okay, now moving on to the second condition: \( \frac{7x + 53}{8} > 200 \).

Let me write that as:

\( 7x + 53 > 1600 \)

Because 200 * 8 is 1600.

So, \( 7x > 1600 - 53 \)
\( 7x > 1547 \)
\( x > \frac{1547}{7} \)
\( x > 221 \)

So, \( x \) must be greater than 221. Since \( x \) must be an integer, \( x \geq 222 \).

But we also have from the first condition that \( x \equiv 5 \pmod{8} \). So, I need the smallest \( x \) that is greater than 221 and congruent to 5 modulo 8.

Let me find the smallest integer \( x \geq 222 \) such that \( x = 8k + 5 \).

So, let me compute \( 221 \) divided by 8 to see where 221 stands.

221 divided by 8: 8*27=216, so 221 is 5 more than 216. So 221 ≡ 5 mod 8.

Wait, that's interesting. So, 221 is congruent to 5 mod 8. So, 221 is a solution, but since \( x > 221 \), the next number would be 221 + 8 = 229.

Wait, but hold on, 221 is 8*27 + 5 = 216 +5=221. So, 221 is 5 mod 8.

But if x must be greater than 221, then the next value is 221 +8=229, which is 5 mod 8.

But wait, let me verify. Let me compute 221 +8=229.

229 divided by 8: 8*28=224, 229-224=5, so yes, 229 ≡5 mod8. So, 229 is the next possible x.

But wait, before I jump to conclusion, is 221 itself the minimal x that is greater than 221? But wait, no, because 221 is equal to 221, which is not greater than 221. So, we need to take the next one, which is 229.

But wait, hold on, let me check: x must be greater than 221, so x must be at least 222. But x is congruent to 5 mod8, so let's see:

222 divided by 8 is 27*8=216, 222-216=6, so 222 ≡6 mod8.

223: 223-216=7, so 223≡7 mod8.

224: 224 is 28*8, so 224≡0 mod8.

225: 225-224=1, so 225≡1 mod8.

226: 226-224=2, 226≡2 mod8.

227: 227-224=3, 227≡3 mod8.

228: 228-224=4, 228≡4 mod8.

229: 229-224=5, 229≡5 mod8.

So, next after 221 is 229, which is the next x that is 5 mod8 and greater than 221.

Therefore, x=229 is the minimal x satisfying both conditions.

But hold on, let me verify whether x=229 satisfies both conditions:

First, \( x = 229 \). Let me compute \( 7x + 53 \).

7*229: Let me compute 7*200=1400, 7*29=203, so total is 1400+203=1603.

So, 1603 +53=1656.

Now, 1656 divided by8: 1656/8=207. So, 207 coins per bag.

Is 207>200? Yes, it is. So, that's good.

But wait, let me double-check if x=229 is indeed the minimal x>221 with x≡5 mod8.

Wait, let me think: x must be greater than 221, so starting from 222, 223,... and check which one is 5 mod8.

222:6, 223:7, 224:0, 225:1, 226:2, 227:3, 228:4, 229:5.

So, 229 is indeed the next one after 221 that is 5 mod8.

But wait, hold on, 229 is equal to 221 +8=229, so that's right.

But wait, 221 is equal to 221, but since x must be greater than 221, so 229 is the minimal x.

Therefore, the minimal x is 229.

But wait, 229 seems a bit high, but let's see.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me double-check.

So, we have 7x +53 must be divisible by8, so 7x +53 ≡0 mod8.

We found that this implies x≡5 mod8.

Then, x must be greater than221, since 7x +53 > 1600, so x>221.

So, the minimal x is 229.

But hold on, 7*229 +53=1603 +53=1656, which is 207*8=1656.

207 is more than 200, so that's good.

But let me check if x=229 is indeed the minimal x>221 with x≡5 mod8.

Wait, 221 is 5 mod8, so 221,229,307,... So, 229 is the next one after 221.

Therefore, 229 is the minimal x.

But wait, hold on, is 229 really the minimal x, or can I have a smaller x? Wait, 221 is the minimal x that is 5 mod8, but 221 is equal to 221, which is less than or equal to 221.

But the problem says I have more than 200 coins after redistribution.

Wait, so if x=221, then total coins after adding 53 is 7*221 +53=1547 +53=1600.

Then, 1600 divided by8 is200, which is exactly 200. But the problem says I have more than 200 coins, so x=221 gives exactly 200 coins per bag, which doesn't satisfy the condition.

Therefore, x=221 is invalid.

So, the next x is229, which gives1656 coins, divided by8 is207>200, so that's good.

So, x=229 is the minimal x.

Wait, but wait, let me check with x=225.

Wait, 225 is 5 mod8? 225 divided by8 is28*8=224, so 225 is1 mod8. So, 225≡1 mod8, not 5.

226:2 mod8, 227:3,228:4,229:5.

So, yes, 229 is indeed the next one.

But just to confirm, let's see x=221: total coins after adding53=1600, which is exactly 200 per bag, which is not more than200.

x=222: 7*222=1554, +53=1607. 1607 divided by8 is 200.875, which is not integer. So, doesn't satisfy.

x=223:7*223=1561, +53=1614, divided by8=201.75, not integer.

x=224:7*224=1568, +53=1621, divided by8=202.625, not integer.

x=225:1575 +53=1628, divided by8=203.5, not integer.

x=226:1582 +53=1635, divided by8=204.375, not integer.

x=227:1589 +53=1642, divided by8=205.25, not integer.

x=228:1596 +53=1649, divided by8=206.125, not integer.

x=229:1603 +53=1656, divided by8=207, which is integer, and >200.

Therefore, x=229 is indeed the minimal x.

Wait, but let me check if x=229 is indeed minimal. Let's check x=221, which is invalid, x=222,...,228, none of them give integer divisions when adding53.

So, yes, 229 is the minimal x.

Wait, but in the problem, it's "I successfully managed to redistribute all the coins, and I also note that I have more than 200 coins."

So, 207 is the number of coins per bag after redistribution, which is more than200.

Therefore, the minimal x is229.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, 7x +53 must be divisible by8.

So, x=229, 7*229=1603, 1603+53=1656, 1656/8=207.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the minimal x is229.

But wait, hold on, 229 is 5 mod8.

Wait, 229 is 5 mod8, but 229 is equal to 221 +8, which is 221 is the x that is 5 mod8 and equals to221.

Wait, but x must be more than221, so 229 is the next x.

Therefore, the minimal x is229.

But the problem says "the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of53."

Wait, so the initial number of coins was7x, which is7*229=1603.

But then, after adding53, it's1656, which is207 per bag.

But the problem is asking for the smallest number of coins I could have had before finding the bag of53, which is7x.

So, if x=229, then7x=1603.

But I need to make sure that 1603 is indeed the minimal number.

Wait, let me think, is there a smaller x that is greater than221 and congruent to5 mod8?

Wait, 221 is5 mod8. So, the next one is221 +8=229, as above.

Therefore, 229 is indeed the minimal x.

Therefore, the minimal number of coins before finding the bag of53 is7*229=1603.

But hold on, the problem is in the wording: "the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of53."

So, is it 1603? Or is it something else?

Wait, let me check the problem again.

"You have seven bags of gold coins. Each bag has the same number of gold coins. One day, you find a bag of53 coins. You decide to redistribute the number of coins you have so that all eight bags you hold have the same number of coins. You successfully manage to redistribute all the coins, and you also note that you have more than200 coins. What is the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of53?"

So, the question is about the number of coins before finding the53 bag, which is7x. So, minimal 7x is1603.

But wait, 1603 is equal to7*229, which is correct.

But let me check, is there a smaller x such that7x +53 is divisible by8 and7x +53 >1600.

So, let's let7x +53=8k, wherek>200.

So,8k>1600, so k>200.

So,8k>1600 =>k>200.

But since7x +53=8k, then7x=8k -53.

So,7x must be equal to8k -53.

Since7x must be divisible by7, 8k -53 must be divisible by7.

So,8k ≡53 mod7.

Compute8 mod7=1, 53 mod7: 53 divided by7 is7*7=49, 53-49=4, so53≡4 mod7.

Thus,8k≡53 mod7 =>1*k≡4 mod7 =>k≡4 mod7.

Therefore, k must be congruent to4 mod7.

So, k=7m +4, for some integer m>=2 (since k>200).

So, k=7m +4>200.

So,7m +4>200 =>7m>196 =>m>28.

Since m must be integer, so m>=29.

So, the minimal k is7*29 +4=203 +4=207.

So, k=207.

So, then, 7x=8k -53=8*207 -53=1656 -53=1603.

So, x=1603/7=229.

Thus, x=229, which is what I found earlier.

Therefore, the minimal number of coins before finding the53 bag is7x=7*229=1603.

Therefore, the answer is1603.

But let me just confirm with k=207, which is the minimal k.

Yes, 7x +53=8k=8*207=1656, which gives x=229.

Therefore, 1603 is indeed the minimal number of coins before finding the53 bag.

But wait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is asking for the number of coins you had before finding the53 bag, which is7x.

But 7x=1603 is the number before finding the53 bag.

But wait, 7*229=1603, and adding53 gives1656, which is207 per bag.

But is there a way to have a smaller 7x?

Wait, if k is smaller than207, but k>200, then k=201,202,...,206, but then 7x=8k -53 must be divisible by7.

So, 8k -53≡0 mod7 =>8k≡53 mod7 =>k≡4 mod7, as before.

So, k must be4 mod7.

So, the next k after200 is207, because200 mod7:200/7=28*7=196,200-196=4, so200≡4 mod7.

Therefore, next k is200 +7=207, which is the minimal k>200 withk≡4 mod7.

So, k=207 is minimal, leading tox=229.

Therefore, 7x=1603 is indeed the minimal number.

So, I think that's correct. So, the answer is1603.

But wait, just to make sure, let me check k=206.

k=206: 8k=1648, 1648-53=1595.

1595 divided by7: 7*227=1589, 1595-1589=6, so 1595≡6 mod7.

So, not divisible by7.

k=205:8*205=1640,1640-53=1587.

1587/7:7*226=1582,1587-1582=5, so1587≡5 mod7.

Not divisible.

k=204:8*204=1632,1632-53=1579.

1579/7=225.571... Not integer.

k=203:8*203=1624,1624-53=1571.

1571/7=224.428... Not integer.

k=202:8*202=1616,1616-53=1563.

1563/7=223.285... Not integer.

k=201:8*201=1608,1608-53=1555.

1555/7=222.142... Not integer.

k=200:8*200=1600,1600-53=1547.

1547/7=221, which is integer, but k=200, which is equal to221 mod8? Wait, no, k=200.

But earlier, we saw that k must be≡4 mod7, so k=200≡200 mod7=200-28*7=200-196=4, so k=200≡4 mod7.

Wait, but in our earlier reasoning, k must be≡4 mod7, so k=200 is≡4 mod7, which is correct.

But 7x +53=8k, wherek=200, which givesx=(8k -53)/7.

So, x=(1600 -53)/7=1547/7=221, which is an integer, but in that case, the number of coins per bag is1600/8=200, which is exactly200, which is not more than200.

Therefore, we cannot have k=200, because that would result in exactly200 coins per bag, which is not more than200.

Therefore, k must be greater than200, so k=207 is the minimal k.

Thus, 7x=8k -53=8*207 -53=1656 -53=1603.

Thus, x=229, which is the minimal x, so7x=1603 is the minimal number of coins before finding the53 bag, which satisfies all the conditions.

Therefore, the answer is1603.

**Final Answer**
The smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins is \boxed{1603}.
</think>

You have seven bags of gold coins, each with the same number of coins. You find a bag with 53 coins and redistribute all your coins into eight bags with the same number of coins. You have more than 200 coins after redistribution. We need to find the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of coins in each of the seven bags. The total number of coins before finding the bag of 53 coins is \( 7x \).
2. After finding the bag of 53 coins, the total number of coins is \( 7x + 53 \).
3. This total must be divisible by 8, so we have the congruence:
   \[
   7x + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}
   \]
4. Simplifying this congruence, we find:
   \[
   7x + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \implies 7x + 5 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \implies 7x \equiv -5 \pmod{8} \implies 7x \equiv 3 \pmod{8}
   \]
   Since 7 and 8 are coprime, the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 8 is 7. Thus,
   \[
   x \equiv 3 \times 7 \pmod{8} \implies x \equiv 21 \pmod{8} \implies x \equiv 5 \pmod{8}
   \]
5. Therefore, \( x \) can be written as \( x = 8k + 5 \) for some integer \( k \).
6. We also need \( \frac{7x + 53}{8} > 200 \), which simplifies to:
   \[
   7x + 53 > 1600 \implies 7x > 1547 \implies x > 221
   \]
7. The smallest \( x \) greater than 221 that satisfies \( x \equiv 5 \pmod{8} \) is 229.
8. Substituting \( x = 229 \) into the total number of coins, we get:
   \[
   7x + 53 = 7 \times 229 + 53 = 1603 + 53 = 1656
   \]
9. Dividing this total by 8 gives:
   \[
   \frac{1656}{8} = 207
   \]
   which is more than 200.

Thus, the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins is \(\boxed{1603}\).
