Question:
For what values of $x$ is it true that $x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10$? Express your answer in interval notation.

Correct Answer:
Re-arranging, $x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0$. The left-hand quadratic factors as $x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0$. Thus, $x-7$ and $x+2$ have opposite signs, so $-2 \le x \le 7$ and $\boxed{x \in [-2,7]}$.

Gold:
x\in[-2,7]

Wrong Prediction:
[-2,7]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: \(x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10\). Hmm, I remember that to solve quadratic inequalities, I need to get everything on one side so that I can factor or use the quadratic formula to find critical points. Let me try that.

First, I'll subtract 10 from both sides to move the 10 to the left. That gives me:

\(x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \le 0\)

Simplifying that, combine the constants:

\(x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0\)

Alright, now I have a quadratic expression on the left. I need to factor this or find its roots to determine where it's less than or equal to zero. Let's see if it factors easily.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add to -5. Let's think: 14 factors into 1 and 14, 2 and 7. Hmm, since the product is negative, one number has to be positive and the other negative. If I have 7 and -2, they multiply to -14 and add to 5. But wait, we need the sum to be -5, so maybe -7 and 2? Yes, that works because -7 * 2 = -14 and -7 + 2 = -5. Perfect!

So, factoring the quadratic:

\((x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0\)

Okay, so the expression is now factored. To find where this product is less than or equal to zero, I need to find the critical points where each factor is zero. That happens at x = 7 and x = -2.

These critical points divide the number line into three intervals:

1. \( (-\infty, -2) \)
2. \( (-2, 7) \)
3. \( (7, \infty) \)

I need to test each interval to determine the sign of the expression \((x - 7)(x + 2)\) in that interval.

Let's pick a test point in each interval.

First interval: \( (-\infty, -2) \). Let's pick x = -3.

Plugging in: (-3 - 7)(-3 + 2) = (-10)(-1) = 10. That's positive, so the expression is positive in this interval.

Second interval: \( (-2, 7) \). Let's choose x = 0.

Plugging in: (0 - 7)(0 + 2) = (-7)(2) = -14. Negative, so the expression is negative here.

Third interval: \( (7, \infty) \). Let's take x = 8.

Plugging in: (8 - 7)(8 + 2) = (1)(10) = 10. Positive again, so the expression is positive here.

Now, we're looking for where the expression is less than or equal to zero. So, the intervals where the expression is negative or zero.

From the test points, the expression is negative in (-2, 7). Now, we also need to check the critical points themselves: x = -2 and x = 7.

At x = -2: Plugging into the original expression: (-2)^2 -5*(-2) -4 = 4 + 10 - 4 = 10. Wait, that's equal to 10, which is the right-hand side of the inequality. So, at x = -2, the expression is equal to 10, which satisfies the inequality \(x^2 -5x -4 \le 10\). So, x = -2 is included.

Similarly, at x = 7: Plugging in: 7^2 -5*7 -4 = 49 - 35 -4 = 10. Again, equal to 10, so x = 7 is also included.

Therefore, the solution includes the interval between -2 and 7, including the endpoints.

In interval notation, this is written as \([-2, 7]\).

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check my factoring.

Original quadratic after moving terms: \(x^2 -5x -14\). Factored into (x - 7)(x + 2). Expanding this: x^2 -7x +2x -14 = x^2 -5x -14. Yep, that's correct.

Testing the intervals: I think my test points were right. (-3 is less than -2, 0 is between -2 and 7, 8 is greater than 7). The signs were positive, negative, positive. So, negative in between, which is what we want.

And endpoints: plugging x = -2 and 7, both give 10, which is equal to the RHS, so they are included.

So, yeah, seems solid. Therefore, the solution is the interval from -2 to 7, inclusive.

**Final Answer**
The solution is \boxed{[-2, 7]}.
</think>

To solve the inequality \(x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10\), we first move all terms to one side:

\[x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \le 0\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0\]

Next, we factor the quadratic expression:

\[(x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0\]

The critical points are \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). These points divide the number line into three intervals:

1. \((-∞, -2)\)
2. \((-2, 7)\)
3. \((7, ∞)\)

We test each interval to determine the sign of the expression:

- For \(x = -3\) in \((-∞, -2)\), the expression is positive.
- For \(x = 0\) in \((-2, 7)\), the expression is negative.
- For \(x = 8\) in \((7, ∞)\), the expression is positive.

The expression is negative in the interval \((-2, 7)\). We also check the critical points:

- At \(x = -2\) and \(x = 7\), the expression equals 10, which satisfies the inequality.

Thus, the solution includes the interval \([-2, 7]\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{[-2, 7]}\).
