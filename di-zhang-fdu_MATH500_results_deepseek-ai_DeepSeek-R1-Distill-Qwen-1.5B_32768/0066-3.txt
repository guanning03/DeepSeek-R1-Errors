Question:
Let $F(z)=\frac{z+i}{z-i}$ for all complex numbers $z\not= i,$ and let $z_n=F(z_{n-1})$ for all positive integers $n.$ Given that $z_0=\frac 1{137}+i,$ find $z_{2002}.$

Correct Answer:
Iterating $F$ a few times, we get \[\begin{aligned} F(F(z)) &= \frac{\frac{z+i}{z-i}+i}{\frac{z+i}{z-i}-i} = \frac{(z+i)+i(z-i)}{(z+i)-i(z-i)}= \frac{z+i+zi+1}{z+i-zi-1}= \frac{(z+1)(i+1)}{(z-1)(1-i)}\\
&= \frac{(z+1)(i+1)^2}{(z-1) \cdot 2}= \frac{(z+1)(2i)}{(z-1) \cdot 2} = \frac{z+1}{z-1}i,\\
F(F(F(z))) &= \frac{\frac{z+1}{z-1}i+i}{\frac{z+1}{z-1}i-i} = \frac{\frac{z+1}{z-1}+1}{\frac{z+1}{z-1}-1} = \frac{(z+1)+(z-1)}{(z+1)-(z-1)}= z. \end{aligned}\]Thus, $z_{k+3} = z_k$ for all $k.$ Since $2002 \equiv 1 \pmod{3},$ we then have \[z_{2002} = z_1 = \frac{z_0+i}{z_0-i} = \frac{1/137 + 2i}{1/137} = \boxed{1+274i}.\]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find \( z_{2002} \) given the function \( F(z) = \frac{z + i}{z - i} \) and the initial value \( z_0 = \frac{1}{137} + i \). The sequence is defined recursively by \( z_n = F(z_{n-1}) \) for all positive integers \( n \). Hmm, interesting. I think I should start by understanding what this function does and maybe find a pattern or periodicity in the sequence.

First, let me write down the function again:

\( F(z) = \frac{z + i}{z - i} \)

So, each term in the sequence is generated by plugging the previous term into this function. That means:

\( z_1 = F(z_0) = \frac{z_0 + i}{z_0 - i} \)

\( z_2 = F(z_1) = \frac{z_1 + i}{z_1 - i} \)

And so on. It might help to compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern or if it repeats after a certain number of steps.

Let me compute \( z_1 \):

Given \( z_0 = \frac{1}{137} + i \), so:

\( z_1 = \frac{\left( \frac{1}{137} + i \right) + i}{\left( \frac{1}{137} + i \right) - i} \)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \( \frac{1}{137} + i + i = \frac{1}{137} + 2i \)

Denominator: \( \frac{1}{137} + i - i = \frac{1}{137} \)

So, \( z_1 = \frac{\frac{1}{137} + 2i}{\frac{1}{137}} = \frac{1 + 2i \cdot 137}{1} = 1 + 274i \)

Wait, let me check that again. If I have \( \frac{\frac{1}{137} + 2i}{\frac{1}{137}} \), that's equal to \( \frac{1}{137} + 2i \times 137 \). Yeah, because dividing by \( \frac{1}{137} \) is multiplying by 137. So, \( 2i \times 137 = 274i \). So, \( z_1 = 1 + 274i \). Hmm, that's a pretty large number.

Now, let's compute \( z_2 \):

\( z_2 = F(z_1) = \frac{z_1 + i}{z_1 - i} = \frac{1 + 274i + i}{1 + 274i - i} = \frac{1 + 275i}{1 + 273i} \)

Hmm, that fraction. Maybe I can simplify it. Let me write numerator and denominator as complex numbers:

Numerator: \( 1 + 275i \)

Denominator: \( 1 + 273i \)

To simplify, I can multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

So, multiply both numerator and denominator by \( 1 - 273i \):

Numerator: \( (1 + 275i)(1 - 273i) = 1 \times 1 + 1 \times (-273i) + 275i \times 1 + 275i \times (-273i) \)

Compute term by term:

1. \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \)
2. \( 1 \times (-273i) = -273i \)
3. \( 275i \times 1 = 275i \)
4. \( 275i \times (-273i) = -275 \times 273 \times i^2 = -275 \times 273 \times (-1) = 275 \times 273 \)

So, adding all terms:

Real parts: 1 + (275 × 273)

Imaginary parts: (-273i + 275i) = (2i)

Compute 275 × 273:

Let me compute that. 275 × 200 = 55,000; 275 × 70 = 19,250; 275 × 3 = 825. So total is 55,000 + 19,250 = 74,250 + 825 = 75,075.

So, the numerator becomes:

1 + 75,075 + 2i = 75,076 + 2i

Denominator: \( (1 + 273i)(1 - 273i) = 1 - (273i)^2 = 1 - (273)^2 (-1) = 1 + (273)^2 \)

Compute \( 273^2 \):

273 × 273: Let's see, 270² is 72,900. Then, 273² = (270 + 3)^2 = 270² + 2×270×3 + 3² = 72,900 + 1,620 + 9 = 72,900 + 1,620 = 74,520 + 9 = 74,529.

So, denominator is \( 1 + 74,529 = 74,530 \)

Therefore, \( z_2 = \frac{75,076 + 2i}{74,530} \)

Simplify real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( \frac{75,076}{74,530} \approx 1.0067 \)

Imaginary part: \( \frac{2}{74,530} \approx 0.0000268 \)

Wait, but that's approximate. Maybe we can express it as a fraction. Let me see:

75,076 divided by 74,530.

Wait, 74,530 + 546 = 75,076.

So, 75,076 = 74,530 + 546.

Therefore, \( \frac{75,076}{74,530} = 1 + \frac{546}{74,530} \)

Similarly, 546 divided by 74,530.

Simplify \( \frac{546}{74,530} \):

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 273 / 37,265.

Hmm, 273 and 37,265. Let's check if they have any common factors.

273 ÷ 3 = 91, which is 13 × 7. So 273 = 3 × 7 × 13.

37,265: Let me check if it's divisible by 5: Yes, ends with 5. 37,265 ÷ 5 = 7,453.

Is 7,453 divisible by 13? Let's see: 13 × 573 = 7,449. Then, 7,453 - 7,449 = 4. So, not divisible by 13.

Similarly, 7,453 ÷ 7: 7 × 1,064 = 7,448, so 7,453 - 7,448 = 5. Not divisible by 7.

Check divisibility by 11: 7 - 4 + 5 - 3 = 5, not divisible by 11.

So, 37,265 = 5 × 7,453, which doesn't have common factors with 273.

So, \( \frac{546}{74,530} = \frac{273}{37,265} \approx 0.00732 \)

Therefore, real part: approximately 1.00732

Imaginary part: approximately 0.0000268

So, \( z_2 \approx 1.00732 + 0.0000268i \)

Wait, that seems very small. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I computed \( z_2 = \frac{1 + 275i}{1 + 273i} \), I multiplied numerator and denominator by the conjugate, which is \( 1 - 273i \). Then, the numerator became \( (1 + 275i)(1 - 273i) \) which gave me 1 - 273i + 275i - 275×273i².

So, 1 + (275i - 273i) + (275×273)(1). Since i² is -1, so it becomes +275×273.

Wait, 275×273 is 75,075, so numerator becomes 1 + 75,075 + 2i = 75,076 + 2i.

Denominator: (1 + 273i)(1 - 273i) = 1 - (273i)^2 = 1 - (273)^2(-1) = 1 + (273)^2 = 1 + 74,529 = 74,530.

So that part was correct.

Then, 75,076 divided by 74,530 is 1 + (546 / 74,530). So, 546/74,530 is 273/37,265, which is approximately 0.00732.

So, real part is approximately 1.00732, and imaginary part is 2 / 74,530, which is approximately 0.0000268.

Wait, but 2 / 74,530 is 1 / 37,265, which is approximately 0.0000268.

So, yeah, that seems correct.

So, \( z_2 \approx 1.00732 + 0.0000268i \). Hmm, okay.

Wait, but this is getting messy. Maybe I should think of another approach rather than computing term by term because it's tedious.

I remember that Möbius transformations can sometimes be represented as matrices, and repeated transformations correspond to matrix powers. Maybe I can represent \( F(z) \) as a matrix and then find a pattern or period.

So, a Möbius transformation \( F(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d} \) can be represented by the matrix \( \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \). The composition of transformations corresponds to multiplying their matrices.

So, let's write \( F(z) \) in matrix form. Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 1 \), \( d = -1 \). So the matrix is:

\( M = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \)

So, each application of \( F \) corresponds to multiplying by this matrix. Therefore, \( z_n = F(z_{n-1}) \) corresponds to multiplying the matrix \( M \) by the vector \( \begin{pmatrix} z_{n-1} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

So, the nth term can be found by \( M^n \) acting on \( \begin{pmatrix} z_0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

So, if I can diagonalize the matrix \( M \) or find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, I can compute \( M^{2002} \) and then apply it to \( z_0 \).

Let's try to find the eigenvalues of \( M \). The characteristic equation is \( \det(M - \lambda I) = 0 \).

Compute determinant:

\( \det\left( \begin{pmatrix} 1 - \lambda & 1 \\ 1 & -1 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \right) = (1 - \lambda)(-1 - \lambda) - (1)(1) \)

Compute that:

\( (1 - \lambda)(-1 - \lambda) = (-1)(1 - \lambda) - \lambda(1 - \lambda) = -1 + \lambda - \lambda + \lambda^2 = \lambda^2 - 1 \)

Then subtract 1:

\( \lambda^2 - 1 - 1 = \lambda^2 - 2 = 0 \)

So, eigenvalues are \( \lambda = \sqrt{2} \) and \( \lambda = -\sqrt{2} \). Hmm, interesting. So, the eigenvalues are \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \).

Since the eigenvalues are real and distinct, the matrix \( M \) is diagonalizable. So, we can write \( M = PDP^{-1} \), where \( D \) is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and \( P \) is the matrix of eigenvectors.

Once we have \( M^n = PD^nP^{-1} \), we can compute \( M^{2002} \).

So, let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

First, for \( \lambda = \sqrt{2} \):

We solve \( (M - \sqrt{2} I) \mathbf{v} = 0 \)

So, the matrix \( M - \sqrt{2} I \) is:

\( \begin{pmatrix} 1 - \sqrt{2} & 1 \\ 1 & -1 - \sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} \)

Let me write the equations:

1. \( (1 - \sqrt{2})v_1 + v_2 = 0 \)
2. \( v_1 + (-1 - \sqrt{2})v_2 = 0 \)

From equation 1: \( v_2 = (\sqrt{2} - 1)v_1 \)

Similarly, from equation 2: \( v_2 = \frac{v_1}{-1 - \sqrt{2}} = \frac{-1}{1 + \sqrt{2}} v_1 \). Let's rationalize this:

\( \frac{-1}{1 + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{-1 \times (1 - \sqrt{2})}{(1 + \sqrt{2})(1 - \sqrt{2})} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{2}}{1 - 2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{2}}{-1} = 1 - \sqrt{2} \)

Wait, that's the same as \( \sqrt{2} - 1 \) when multiplied by -1. So, both equations give the same ratio, which is consistent.

Therefore, the eigenvectors for \( \lambda = \sqrt{2} \) are scalar multiples of \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} - 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

Similarly, for \( \lambda = -\sqrt{2} \), we solve \( (M + \sqrt{2} I) \mathbf{v} = 0 \):

Matrix \( M + \sqrt{2} I \):

\( \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \sqrt{2} & 1 \\ 1 & -1 + \sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} \)

Equations:

1. \( (1 + \sqrt{2})v_1 + v_2 = 0 \)
2. \( v_1 + (-1 + \sqrt{2})v_2 = 0 \)

From equation 1: \( v_2 = -(1 + \sqrt{2})v_1 \)

From equation 2: \( v_2 = \frac{v_1}{-1 + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{v_1}{-1 + \sqrt{2}} \times \frac{1 + \sqrt{2}}{1 + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{(1 + \sqrt{2})v_1}{( -1 + \sqrt{2})(1 + \sqrt{2})} \)

Compute denominator:

\( (-1 + \sqrt{2})(1 + \sqrt{2}) = (-1)(1) + (-1)(\sqrt{2}) + \sqrt{2}(1) + \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2} = -1 - \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} + 2 = (-1 + 2) + (-\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2}) = 1 + 0 = 1 \)

So, \( v_2 = (1 + \sqrt{2})v_1 \)

But from equation 1, \( v_2 = -(1 + \sqrt{2})v_1 \). Therefore, unless \( v_1 = 0 \), these cannot be equal. So, for consistency, \( v_1 = 0 \), but that would make \( v_2 = 0 \), which is trivial. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the eigenvectors are not real. Wait, but since the eigenvalues are real and the matrix is 2x2, maybe we need to consider complex eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, for \( \lambda = -\sqrt{2} \):

Equation 1: \( (1 + \sqrt{2})v_1 + v_2 = 0 \) => \( v_2 = - (1 + \sqrt{2})v_1 \)

Equation 2: \( v_1 + (-1 + \sqrt{2})v_2 = 0 \)

Substitute \( v_2 \) from equation 1 into equation 2:

\( v_1 + (-1 + \sqrt{2})( - (1 + \sqrt{2})v_1 ) = 0 \)

Compute the second term:

\( (-1 + \sqrt{2})( - (1 + \sqrt{2})v_1 ) = (1 - \sqrt{2})(1 + \sqrt{2})v_1 \)

Which is \( (1)^2 - (\sqrt{2})^2 v_1 = (1 - 2)v_1 = -v_1 \)

So, equation 2 becomes:

\( v_1 - v_1 = 0 \) => \( 0 = 0 \). So, no new information. So, the eigenvectors for \( \lambda = -\sqrt{2} \) are scalar multiples of \( v_1 = 1 \), \( v_2 = -(1 + \sqrt{2}) \). So, \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ - (1 + \sqrt{2}) \end{pmatrix} \)

So, in summary, the eigenvectors are:

For \( \lambda = \sqrt{2} \): \( \mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} - 1 \end{pmatrix} \)

For \( \lambda = -\sqrt{2} \): \( \mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 - \sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} \)

Now, we can write the matrix \( M \) as \( M = PDP^{-1} \), where \( P \) is the matrix of eigenvectors and \( D \) is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

So:

\( P = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ \sqrt{2} - 1 & -1 - \sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} \)

\( D = \begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 0 & -\sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} \)

Then, \( M^n = P D^n P^{-1} \)

So, to compute \( M^{2002} \), I need to compute \( P D^{2002} P^{-1} \)

But before that, I need to compute \( P^{-1} \). Let's compute \( P^{-1} \).

Given \( P = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \), then \( P^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix} \)

Compute determinant of \( P \):

\( \det(P) = (1)(-1 - \sqrt{2}) - (1)(\sqrt{2} - 1) = -1 - \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2} + 1 = (-1 + 1) + (-\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2}) = 0 - 2\sqrt{2} = -2\sqrt{2} \)

So, \( \det(P) = -2\sqrt{2} \), so \( P^{-1} = \frac{1}{-2\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 - \sqrt{2} & -1 \\ -(\sqrt{2} - 1) & 1 \end{pmatrix} \)

Simplify:

First, factor out the negative sign:

\( P^{-1} = \frac{1}{-2\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 - \sqrt{2} & -1 \\ -\sqrt{2} + 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \)

Which is:

\( P^{-1} = \frac{1}{-2\sqrt{2}} \times \begin{pmatrix} -1 - \sqrt{2} & -1 \\ -\sqrt{2} + 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \)

Let me factor out a negative from the numerator:

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:

\( P^{-1} = \frac{1}{-2\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 - \sqrt{2} & -1 \\ -\sqrt{2} + 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{-2\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 - \sqrt{2} & -1 \\ 1 - \sqrt{2} & 1 \end{pmatrix} \)

Wait, maybe it's clearer if I factor out a negative from the first row:

\( P^{-1} = \frac{1}{-2\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} (-1 - \sqrt{2}) & -1 \\ (1 - \sqrt{2}) & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{-2\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 - \sqrt{2} & -1 \\ 1 - \sqrt{2} & 1 \end{pmatrix} \)

Alternatively, factor out -1 from the first row:

\( P^{-1} = \frac{1}{-2\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 - \sqrt{2} & -1 \\ 1 - \sqrt{2} & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{-2\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} (-1 - \sqrt{2}) & -1 \\ (1 - \sqrt{2}) & 1 \end{pmatrix} \)

I think that's as simplified as it gets.

Now, let's compute \( M^{2002} = P D^{2002} P^{-1} \). But before that, perhaps it's better to express \( M^n \) in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Given that \( M^n = P D^n P^{-1} \), and since \( D^n \) is easy to compute because it's diagonal, we can actually compute \( M^{2002} \) by applying it to the vector.

Wait, but in our case, we have \( z_n = F(z_{n-1}) = M z_{n-1} \), so \( z_n = M^n z_0 \).

Thus, \( z_{2002} = M^{2002} z_0 \)

Since \( z_0 \) is a vector \( \begin{pmatrix} z_0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), so if I can compute \( M^{2002} \begin{pmatrix} z_0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), I can get \( z_{2002} \).

Alternatively, since \( z_n = M^n z_0 \), perhaps I can represent \( z_n \) as a linear combination of the eigenvectors, scaled by eigenvalues raised to the nth power.

Let me recall that if \( M = P D P^{-1} \), then \( M^n = P D^n P^{-1} \), so \( z_n = M^n z_0 = P D^n P^{-1} z_0 \)

But since \( P^{-1} z_0 \) can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors, let me denote \( \mathbf{v}_0 = \begin{pmatrix} z_0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \)

Express \( \mathbf{v}_0 \) as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of \( M \):

\( \mathbf{v}_0 = c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 \), where \( \mathbf{v}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{v}_2 \) are the eigenvectors, and \( c_1, c_2 \) are scalars.

Then,

\( \mathbf{v}_0 = c_1 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} - 1 \end{pmatrix} + c_2 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 - \sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} \)

So, set up equations:

1. \( c_1 \times 1 + c_2 \times 1 = z_0 \)
2. \( c_1 \times (\sqrt{2} - 1) + c_2 \times (-1 - \sqrt{2}) = 1 \)

So, two equations:

1. \( c_1 + c_2 = z_0 \)
2. \( c_1 (\sqrt{2} - 1) - c_2 (1 + \sqrt{2}) = 1 \)

We can solve this system for \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \).

From equation 1: \( c_1 = z_0 - c_2 \)

Plug into equation 2:

\( (z_0 - c_2)(\sqrt{2} - 1) - c_2 (1 + \sqrt{2}) = 1 \)

Expand:

\( z_0 (\sqrt{2} - 1) - c_2 (\sqrt{2} - 1) - c_2 (1 + \sqrt{2}) = 1 \)

Combine the terms with \( c_2 \):

\( -c_2 [ (\sqrt{2} - 1) + (1 + \sqrt{2}) ] = -c_2 [ 2\sqrt{2} ] \)

So, equation becomes:

\( z_0 (\sqrt{2} - 1) - 2\sqrt{2} c_2 = 1 \)

Solve for \( c_2 \):

\( -2\sqrt{2} c_2 = 1 - z_0 (\sqrt{2} - 1) \)

Multiply both sides by -1/(2√2):

\( c_2 = \frac{ z_0 (\sqrt{2} - 1) - 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \)

Similarly, \( c_1 = z_0 - c_2 \)

Let me compute \( c_2 \):

\( c_2 = \frac{ z_0 (\sqrt{2} - 1) - 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \)

So, \( c_1 = z_0 - \frac{ z_0 (\sqrt{2} - 1) - 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \)

Simplify \( c_1 \):

\( c_1 = \frac{ 2\sqrt{2} z_0 - [ z_0 (\sqrt{2} - 1) - 1 ] }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \)

Compute numerator:

\( 2\sqrt{2} z_0 - z_0 (\sqrt{2} - 1) + 1 \)

Factor \( z_0 \):

\( z_0 (2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2} + 1) + 1 = z_0 (\sqrt{2} + 1) + 1 \)

So, \( c_1 = \frac{ z_0 (\sqrt{2} + 1) + 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \)

Alright, so now we have expressions for \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \). Therefore, \( \mathbf{v}_0 = c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 \)

Then, \( M^n \mathbf{v}_0 = c_1 \lambda_1^n \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \lambda_2^n \mathbf{v}_2 \)

Therefore,

\( z_n = M^n z_0 = M^n \begin{pmatrix} z_0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = c_1 \lambda_1^n \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \lambda_2^n \mathbf{v}_2 \)

Which is,

\( z_n = c_1 \lambda_1^n \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} - 1 \end{pmatrix} + c_2 \lambda_2^n \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 - \sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} \)

So, first component is:

\( z_n = c_1 \lambda_1^n + c_2 \lambda_2^n \)

Second component is:

\( 1 = c_1 (\sqrt{2} - 1) \lambda_1^n + c_2 (-1 - \sqrt{2}) \lambda_2^n \)

But actually, we only need the first component, so let's focus on:

\( z_n = c_1 \lambda_1^n + c_2 \lambda_2^n \)

Since \( \lambda_1 = \sqrt{2} \), \( \lambda_2 = -\sqrt{2} \)

Recall \( c_1 = \frac{ z_0 (\sqrt{2} + 1) + 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \) and \( c_2 = \frac{ z_0 (\sqrt{2} - 1) - 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \)

So, plugging in:

\( z_n = \left( \frac{ z_0 (\sqrt{2} + 1) + 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \right) (\sqrt{2})^n + \left( \frac{ z_0 (\sqrt{2} - 1) - 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \right) (-\sqrt{2})^n \)

Simplify each term:

First term:

\( \left( \frac{ z_0 (\sqrt{2} + 1) + 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \right) (\sqrt{2})^n = \frac{ z_0 (\sqrt{2} + 1) + 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times (\sqrt{2})^n \)

Similarly, second term:

\( \left( \frac{ z_0 (\sqrt{2} - 1) - 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \right) (-\sqrt{2})^n = \frac{ z_0 (\sqrt{2} - 1) - 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times (-\sqrt{2})^n \)

Let me factor out the constants:

First term:

\( \frac{ (\sqrt{2} + 1) }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times z_0 (\sqrt{2})^n + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} \times (\sqrt{2})^n \)

Second term:

\( \frac{ (\sqrt{2} -1 ) }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times (-\sqrt{2})^n (-1)^n + \frac{ -1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times (-\sqrt{2})^n \)

Wait, let me think.

Note that \( (-\sqrt{2})^n = (-1)^n (\sqrt{2})^n \). So, let's write:

Second term:

\( \frac{ z_0 (\sqrt{2} - 1) - 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times (-1)^n (\sqrt{2})^n \)

Similarly, first term is:

\( \frac{ z_0 (\sqrt{2} + 1) + 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times (\sqrt{2})^n \)

So, let's write both terms with \( (\sqrt{2})^n \):

First term:

\( \frac{ (\sqrt{2} + 1) z_0 + 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } (\sqrt{2})^n \)

Second term:

\( \frac{ (-1)^n ( (\sqrt{2} - 1) z_0 - 1 ) }{ 2\sqrt{2} } (\sqrt{2})^n \)

Combine the two terms:

\( z_n = \frac{ (\sqrt{2} + 1) z_0 + 1 }{ 2\sqrt{2} } (\sqrt{2})^n + \frac{ (-1)^n ( (\sqrt{2} - 1) z_0 - 1 ) }{ 2\sqrt{2} } (\sqrt{2})^n \)

Factor out \( \frac{ (\sqrt{2})^n }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \):

\( z_n = \frac{ (\sqrt{2})^n }{ 2\sqrt{2} } [ (\sqrt{2} + 1) z_0 + 1 + (-1)^n ( (\sqrt{2} - 1) z_0 - 1 ) ] \)

Simplify the bracket:

Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:

Term1: \( (\sqrt{2} + 1) z_0 + 1 \)

Term2: \( (-1)^n ( (\sqrt{2} - 1) z_0 - 1 ) = (-1)^n (\sqrt{2} - 1) z_0 - (-1)^n \)

So, overall:

\( (\sqrt{2} + 1) z_0 + 1 + (-1)^n (\sqrt{2} - 1) z_0 - (-1)^n \)

Combine like terms:

For \( z_0 \):

\( [ (\sqrt{2} + 1) + (-1)^n (\sqrt{2} - 1) ] z_0 \)

For constants:

\( 1 - (-1)^n \)

So, let's compute each:

First, for the coefficient of \( z_0 \):

\( (\sqrt{2} + 1) + (-1)^n (\sqrt{2} - 1) \)

Let me factor \( \sqrt{2} \) and constants:

= \( \sqrt{2} (1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 + (-1)^n (-1) \)

= \( \sqrt{2} (1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - (-1)^n \)

Similarly, for constants:

\( 1 - (-1)^n \)

So, putting it together, the bracket becomes:

\( [ \sqrt{2} (1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - (-1)^n ] z_0 + [ 1 - (-1)^n ] \)

Factor out \( 1 - (-1)^n \):

Wait, let's see:

Wait, the entire expression is:

\( [ \sqrt{2} (1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - (-1)^n ] z_0 + [ 1 - (-1)^n ] \)

Let me factor \( [1 - (-1)^n] \) from both terms:

Wait, the first term has \( \sqrt{2} (1 + (-1)^n ) + (1 - (-1)^n ) \) as the coefficient, and the second term is \( (1 - (-1)^n ) \).

So, factor \( 1 - (-1)^n \) from the first two terms:

= \( [ \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + (1 - (-1)^n ) ] z_0 + (1 - (-1)^n ) \)

= \( [ \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - (-1)^n ] z_0 + (1 - (-1)^n ) \)

Notice that \( 1 - (-1)^n = 1 - (-1)^n \), and \( \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - (-1)^n \) is another expression.

Let me write both terms:

= \( [ \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - (-1)^n ] z_0 + (1 - (-1)^n ) \)

Hmm, perhaps factor \( (1 - (-1)^n ) \) differently.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, factor \( 1 - (-1)^n \) as a common factor.

Alternatively, note that \( \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + (1 - (-1)^n ) = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2}(-1)^n + 1 - (-1)^n \)

= \( (\sqrt{2} + 1) + (-1)^n (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) \)

Which is the same as before.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute specific values.

Wait, but maybe instead of trying to factor, let's compute the entire expression step by step.

Wait, perhaps I made this more complicated. Let me think.

Given that \( z_n = \frac{ (\sqrt{2})^n }{ 2\sqrt{2} } [ (\sqrt{2} + 1) z_0 + 1 + (-1)^n ( (\sqrt{2} - 1) z_0 - 1 ) ] \)

Let me compute this for \( z_0 = \frac{1}{137} + i \), which is \( \frac{1}{137} + i \), so let's denote \( z_0 = a + ib \), where \( a = 1/137 \), \( b = 1 \)

So, substituting \( z_0 = a + ib \):

First, compute the bracket term:

\( [ \sqrt{2} (1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - (-1)^n ] (a + ib ) + [ 1 - (-1)^n ] \)

Compute each part:

Let me denote \( s_n = (-1)^n \). So, \( s_n = 1 \) if n even, \( -1 \) if n odd.

So, bracket becomes:

\( [ \sqrt{2} (1 + s_n ) + 1 - s_n ] (a + ib ) + [ 1 - s_n ] \)

Compute the scalar multiplier:

\( \sqrt{2} (1 + s_n ) + 1 - s_n \)

= \( \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} s_n + 1 - s_n \)

= \( (\sqrt{2} + 1) + s_n (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) \)

So, scalar is \( (\sqrt{2} + 1) + s_n (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) \)

Then, the entire bracket is:

\( [ (\sqrt{2} + 1) + s_n (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) ] (a + ib ) + [ 1 - s_n ] \)

So, now, distribute:

= \( (\sqrt{2} + 1)(a + ib ) + s_n (\sqrt{2} - 1)(a + ib ) + 1 - s_n \)

Compute each part:

First term: \( (\sqrt{2} + 1)(a + ib ) \)

= \( (\sqrt{2} + 1)a + i (\sqrt{2} + 1) b \)

Second term: \( s_n (\sqrt{2} - 1)(a + ib ) \)

= \( s_n (\sqrt{2} - 1) a + i s_n (\sqrt{2} - 1) b \)

Third term: \( 1 - s_n \)

So, combining all terms:

= \( [ (\sqrt{2} + 1) a + 1 ] + i [ (\sqrt{2} + 1) b + s_n (\sqrt{2} - 1) b ] + [ s_n (\sqrt{2} - 1) a - s_n ] \)

Wait, let me check:

Wait, no, the third term is 1 - s_n, which is a real term, and the second term has an imaginary component.

So, breaking down:

Real parts:

1. \( (\sqrt{2} + 1) a + 1 \)
2. \( s_n (\sqrt{2} - 1) a \)
3. \( -s_n \)

Imaginary parts:

1. \( (\sqrt{2} + 1) b \)
2. \( s_n (\sqrt{2} - 1) b \)

So, combining real parts:

= \( [ (\sqrt{2} + 1) a + 1 ] + s_n [ (\sqrt{2} - 1) a - 1 ] \)

Imaginary parts:

= \( [ (\sqrt{2} + 1) b ] + s_n [ (\sqrt{2} - 1) b ] \)

So, putting it all together:

\( z_n = \frac{ (\sqrt{2})^n }{ 2\sqrt{2} } [ Real Part + i Imaginary Part ] \)

Thus,

Real Part: \( [ (\sqrt{2} + 1) a + 1 ] + s_n [ (\sqrt{2} - 1) a - 1 ] \)

Imaginary Part: \( [ (\sqrt{2} + 1) b ] + s_n [ (\sqrt{2} - 1) b ] \)

So, let's compute each part step by step.

Given \( a = 1/137 \), \( b = 1 \), \( s_n = (-1)^n \)

Compute Real Part:

= \( [ (\sqrt{2} + 1)(1/137) + 1 ] + (-1)^n [ (\sqrt{2} - 1)(1/137) - 1 ] \)

Simplify:

= \( \frac{ (\sqrt{2} + 1) }{137 } + 1 + (-1)^n \left( \frac{ (\sqrt{2} - 1) }{137 } - 1 \right ) \)

Similarly, Imaginary Part:

= \( [ (\sqrt{2} + 1) \times 1 ] + (-1)^n [ (\sqrt{2} - 1) \times 1 ] \)

= \( (\sqrt{2} + 1) + (-1)^n (\sqrt{2} - 1) \)

So, now, let's compute Real Part:

= \( \frac{ (\sqrt{2} + 1) }{137 } + 1 + (-1)^n \left( \frac{ (\sqrt{2} - 1) }{137 } - 1 \right ) \)

Let me compute the fraction:

Compute \( \frac{ (\sqrt{2} - 1) }{137 } - 1 \):

= \( \frac{ \sqrt{2} - 1 - 137 }{137 } = \frac{ \sqrt{2} - 138 }{137 } \)

So, Real Part:

= \( \frac{ \sqrt{2} + 1 }{137 } + 1 + (-1)^n \times \frac{ \sqrt{2} - 138 }{137 } \)

Combine terms:

= \( 1 + \frac{ \sqrt{2} + 1 }{137 } + (-1)^n \times \frac{ \sqrt{2} - 138 }{137 } \)

Similarly, Imaginary Part:

= \( (\sqrt{2} + 1) + (-1)^n (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) \)

= \( \sqrt{2} + 1 + (-1)^n \sqrt{2} - (-1)^n \)

= \( \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + (1 - (-1)^n ) \)

So, now, putting it together:

\( z_n = \frac{ (\sqrt{2})^n }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times [ Real Part + i Imaginary Part ] \)

So,

Real Part:

= \( 1 + \frac{ \sqrt{2} + 1 }{137 } + (-1)^n \times \frac{ \sqrt{2} - 138 }{137 } \)

Imaginary Part:

= \( \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + (1 - (-1)^n ) \)

So, we can factor out \( \frac{1}{137 } \) from Real Part:

= \( 1 + \frac{1}{137 } [ \sqrt{2} + 1 - (\sqrt{2} - 138 ) (-1)^n ] \)

Wait, let me see:

Wait, Real Part was:

= \( 1 + \frac{ \sqrt{2} + 1 }{137 } + (-1)^n \times \frac{ \sqrt{2} - 138 }{137 } \)

= \( 1 + \frac{ \sqrt{2} + 1 + (-1)^n ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) }{137 } \)

So, combining:

= \( 1 + \frac{ \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - 138 (-1)^n }{137 } \)

Similarly, Imaginary Part:

= \( \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + (1 - (-1)^n ) \)

= \( (1 + (-1)^n ) ( \sqrt{2} + 1 ) - ( -1 + (-1)^n ) \)

Wait, maybe not. Let me just write it as is.

So, Real Part:

= \( 1 + \frac{ \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - 138 (-1)^n }{137 } \)

Imaginary Part:

= \( \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - (-1)^n \)

So, now, \( z_n = \frac{ (\sqrt{2})^n }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times [ Real Part + i Imaginary Part ] \)

Let me write \( z_n = x_n + i y_n \), where:

\( x_n = \frac{ (\sqrt{2})^n }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times \left( 1 + \frac{ \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - 138 (-1)^n }{137 } \right ) \)

\( y_n = \frac{ (\sqrt{2})^n }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times \left( \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - (-1)^n \right ) \)

This is getting quite involved, but perhaps we can factor some constants.

Let me factor \( \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} \) out of both \( x_n \) and \( y_n \):

So,

\( x_n = \frac{ (\sqrt{2})^n }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times \left( 1 + \frac{ \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - 138 (-1)^n }{137 } \right ) \)

= \( \frac{ (\sqrt{2})^n }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times \left( 1 + \frac{ \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} (-1)^n + 1 - 138 (-1)^n }{137 } \right ) \)

= \( \frac{ (\sqrt{2})^n }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times \left( 1 + \frac{ (\sqrt{2} + 1) + (-1)^n ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) }{137 } \right ) \)

Similarly, \( y_n = \frac{ (\sqrt{2})^n }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times \left( \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - (-1)^n \right ) \)

Let me simplify each part.

First, let's compute the Real Part in the \( x_n \) term:

= \( 1 + \frac{ \sqrt{2} + 1 + (-1)^n ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) }{137 } \)

= \( \frac{137 + \sqrt{2} + 1 + (-1)^n ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) }{137 } \)

= \( \frac{138 + \sqrt{2} + (-1)^n ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) }{137 } \)

Similarly, Imaginary Part:

= \( \sqrt{2}(1 + (-1)^n ) + 1 - (-1)^n \)

= \( \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} (-1)^n + 1 - (-1)^n \)

= \( (\sqrt{2} + 1) + [ \sqrt{2} - 1 ] (-1)^n \)

So, now, \( x_n = \frac{ (\sqrt{2})^n }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times \left( \frac{138 + \sqrt{2} + (-1)^n ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) }{137 } \right ) \)

Similarly, \( y_n = \frac{ (\sqrt{2})^n }{ 2\sqrt{2} } \times \left( (\sqrt{2} + 1) + [ \sqrt{2} - 1 ] (-1)^n \right ) \)

This seems to be a form where we can compute \( z_n \) for \( n = 2002 \).

However, this expression is quite complicated. Perhaps there's a pattern or a periodicity that can help us.

Given that \( z_n \) is defined by \( F(z_{n-1}) = z_n \), which is a Möbius transformation, and Möbius transformations can have periodic points depending on the trace and determinant.

Given that the eigenvalues are \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \), which are distinct, the transformation is periodic with period 2? Wait, no, because the eigenvalues have magnitude \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \), which is greater than 1, so the transformation is not periodic in the sense of finite order, but it's hyperbolic.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that the transformation alternates between two states, but given the eigenvalues, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps since the eigenvalues are real and distinct, the transformation could be conjugate to a rotation or a scaling, but in this case, since the determinant is -2, which is negative, the transformation has an improper rotation.

Wait, maybe we can compute \( z_2 \) and see if there is a pattern.

Earlier, when computing \( z_2 \), I found:

\( z_2 = \frac{75,076 + 275i}{74,530} \)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 2:

Numerator: 37,538 + 137.5i

Denominator: 37,265

Hmm, 37,538 divided by 37,265 is approximately 1.007, which is close to \( \sqrt{2} \) (approx 1.414), but not exactly.

Wait, 37,265 * 1.007 ≈ 37,538, so not exactly. Maybe the number is not reducible.

Alternatively, perhaps the real and imaginary parts can be expressed in terms of \( \sqrt{2} \) and trigonometric functions.

Alternatively, maybe instead of computing \( z_n \) directly, we can find a closed-form expression.

Wait, given that \( z_n = M^n z_0 \), where \( M \) is the matrix with eigenvalues \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \), and eigenvectors \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \), perhaps express \( z_0 \) as a linear combination of \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \), then \( M^n z_0 = c_1 (\sqrt{2})^n v_1 + c_2 (-\sqrt{2})^n v_2 \)

So, let's try that.

Express \( z_0 = a v_1 + b v_2 \)

Given that \( v_1 = [1; \sqrt{2} - 1] \), \( v_2 = [1; -1 - \sqrt{2}] \)

So, set up the equations:

1. \( a + b = z_0 \) (real part)
2. \( a (\sqrt{2} - 1) + b (-1 - \sqrt{2}) = 1 \) (imaginary part)

So, from equation 1: \( a + b = 1/137 \)

From equation 2: \( a (\sqrt{2} - 1) - b (1 + \sqrt{2}) = 1 \)

Let me write this as:

Equation 1: \( a + b = 1/137 \)

Equation 2: \( (\sqrt{2} - 1) a - (1 + \sqrt{2}) b = 1 \)

I can solve this system for \( a \) and \( b \).

Let me denote \( \sqrt{2} \) as s for simplicity.

So, Equation 1: \( a + b = 1/137 \)

Equation 2: \( (s - 1) a - (1 + s ) b = 1 \)

Let me solve Equation 1 for \( a \):

\( a = 1/137 - b \)

Substitute into Equation 2:

\( (s - 1)(1/137 - b ) - (1 + s ) b = 1 \)

Expand:

= \( (s - 1)/137 - (s - 1) b - (1 + s ) b = 1 \)

Combine the terms with \( b \):

= \( (s - 1)/137 - [ (s - 1) + (1 + s ) ] b = 1 \)

Simplify the coefficient of \( b \):

= \( (s - 1)/137 - [ 2s ] b = 1 \)

So, rearranged:

\( -2s b = 1 - (s - 1)/137 \)

Multiply both sides by -1:

\( 2s b = -1 + (s - 1)/137 \)

Factor:

= \( 2s b = ( -137 + s - 1 ) / 137 \)

= \( 2s b = ( s - 138 ) / 137 \)

Therefore,

\( b = ( s - 138 ) / ( 2s \times 137 ) \)

= \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) / ( 2 \sqrt{2} \times 137 ) \)

Similarly, \( a = 1/137 - b \)

= \( 1/137 - ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) / ( 2 \sqrt{2} \times 137 ) \)

= \( [ 2 \sqrt{2} - ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ] / ( 2 \sqrt{2} \times 137 ) \)

= \( ( 2 \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2} + 138 ) / ( 2 \sqrt{2} \times 137 ) \)

= \( ( \sqrt{2} + 138 ) / ( 2 \sqrt{2} \times 137 ) \)

So, now, \( z_0 = a v_1 + b v_2 \)

Therefore,

\( z_n = M^n z_0 = c_1 (\sqrt{2})^n v_1 + c_2 (-\sqrt{2})^n v_2 \)

Where \( c_1 = a \) and \( c_2 = b \)

Thus,

\( z_n = a (\sqrt{2})^n v_1 + b (-\sqrt{2})^n v_2 \)

Substituting \( a \) and \( b \):

= \( \left( \frac{ \sqrt{2} + 138 }{ 2 \sqrt{2} \times 137 } \right ) (\sqrt{2})^n v_1 + \left( \frac{ \sqrt{2} - 138 }{ 2 \sqrt{2} \times 137 } \right ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n v_2 \)

Simplify:

Factor out \( \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2} \times 137 } \):

= \( \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2} \times 137 } [ ( \sqrt{2} + 138 ) (\sqrt{2})^n v_1 + ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n v_2 ] \)

Let me write this as:

= \( \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2} \times 137 } [ ( \sqrt{2} + 138 ) (\sqrt{2})^n v_1 + ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n v_2 ] \)

Now, substitute \( v_1 = [1; \sqrt{2} - 1] \) and \( v_2 = [1; -1 - \sqrt{2}] \):

First term: \( (\sqrt{2} + 138 ) (\sqrt{2})^n [1; \sqrt{2} - 1] \)

= \( (\sqrt{2} + 138 ) (\sqrt{2})^n \times 1 \) in the real part,

= \( (\sqrt{2} + 138 ) (\sqrt{2})^n \times (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) \) in the imaginary part.

Second term: \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n [1; -1 - \sqrt{2} ] \)

= \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n \times 1 \) in the real part,

= \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n \times ( -1 - \sqrt{2} ) \) in the imaginary part.

So, let's compute each component.

Real part:

First term:

= \( ( \sqrt{2} + 138 ) (\sqrt{2})^n (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) \)

Second term:

= \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n \times 1 \)

So, total real part:

= \( ( \sqrt{2} + 138 ) (\sqrt{2})^n (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) + ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n \)

Similarly, Imaginary part:

First term:

= \( ( \sqrt{2} + 138 ) (\sqrt{2})^n (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) \)

Second term:

= \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n ( -1 - \sqrt{2} ) \)

= \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n ( -1 - \sqrt{2} ) \)

Let me compute each term.

First, compute the Real Part:

Real Part:

= \( ( \sqrt{2} + 138 ) (\sqrt{2})^n (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) + ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n \)

Note that \( (\sqrt{2})^n (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) = ( \sqrt{2}^{n + 1} - \sqrt{2}^n ) \), but perhaps we can factor something else.

Wait, perhaps factor out \( (\sqrt{2})^n \):

= \( (\sqrt{2} + 138 ) (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) (\sqrt{2})^n + ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n \)

Similarly, the Imaginary Part:

= \( ( \sqrt{2} + 138 ) (\sqrt{2})^n (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) + ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n ( -1 - \sqrt{2} ) \)

Let me compute \( (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) \) and \( ( -1 - \sqrt{2} ) \):

Note that \( ( -1 - \sqrt{2} ) = - (1 + \sqrt{2} ) \), so perhaps factor that.

But let me see:

Compute the coefficients:

First, Real Part:

Let me compute \( ( \sqrt{2} + 138 ) (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) \):

= \( \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} \times (-1) + 138 \times \sqrt{2} + 138 \times (-1) \)

= \( 2 - \sqrt{2} + 138 \sqrt{2} - 138 \)

= \( (2 - 138 ) + ( -1 + 138 ) \sqrt{2} \)

= \( -136 + 137 \sqrt{2} \)

Similarly, \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n \):

Note that \( ( -\sqrt{2} )^n = (-1)^n ( \sqrt{2} )^n \)

So,

= \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) (-1)^n ( \sqrt{2} )^n \)

Let me write both terms:

Real Part:

= \( ( -136 + 137 \sqrt{2} ) (\sqrt{2})^n + ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) (-1)^n ( \sqrt{2} )^n \)

Factor out \( (\sqrt{2})^n \):

= \( [ -136 + 137 \sqrt{2} + ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) (-1)^n ] (\sqrt{2})^n \)

Similarly, Imaginary Part:

Compute coefficient:

First term: \( ( \sqrt{2} + 138 ) (\sqrt{2} - 1 ) (\sqrt{2})^n = ( -136 + 137 \sqrt{2} ) (\sqrt{2})^n \)

Second term: \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -\sqrt{2} )^n ( -1 - \sqrt{2} ) \)

= \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -1)^n ( \sqrt{2} )^n ( -1 - \sqrt{2} ) \)

= \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -1 )^n ( \sqrt{2} )^n ( -1 - \sqrt{2} ) \)

Note that \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -1 - \sqrt{2} ) = - ( \sqrt{2} - 138 )(1 + \sqrt{2} ) \)

Compute \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 )(1 + \sqrt{2} ) \):

= \( \sqrt{2} \times 1 + \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2} - 138 \times 1 - 138 \times \sqrt{2} \)

= \( \sqrt{2} + 2 - 138 - 138 \sqrt{2} \)

= \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 \sqrt{2} ) + ( 2 - 138 ) \)

= \( -137 \sqrt{2} - 136 \)

So, the second term becomes:

= \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -1 )^n ( \sqrt{2} )^n ( -137 \sqrt{2} - 136 ) \)

= \( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -1 )^n ( -137 \sqrt{2} - 136 ) (\sqrt{2})^n \)

Thus, the second term is:

= \( ( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -137 \sqrt{2} - 136 ) ) ( -1 )^n (\sqrt{2})^n \)

So, putting together:

Imaginary Part:

= \( ( -136 + 137 \sqrt{2} ) (\sqrt{2})^n + ( ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -137 \sqrt{2} - 136 ) ) ( -1 )^n (\sqrt{2})^n \)

Factor out \( (\sqrt{2})^n \):

= \( [ -136 + 137 \sqrt{2} + ( \sqrt{2} - 138 ) ( -137 \sqrt{2} - 136 ) ( -1 )^n ] (\sqrt{2})^n \)

This is getting extremely complicated. I might have made a mistake in trying to compute it this way, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to accept that \( z_n \) can be written as a combination of \( (\sqrt{2})^n \) and \( (-\sqrt{2})^n \), and since both terms will grow rapidly in magnitude, but given that \( n = 2002 \), which is even, so \( (-\sqrt{2})^n = ( \sqrt{2} )^{2002} \), which is a very large number.

But wait, given that \( z_{2002} = F^{2002}(z_0) \), which is a function that's applied 2002 times, but maybe the sequence cycles or stabilizes after some steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after two iterations, the sequence becomes periodic or converges.

But given the eigenvalues, the transformation is hyperbolic, so it should diverge unless it's on the Julia set, which is complicated.

Wait, perhaps instead of computing it directly, perhaps using the fact that \( z_{n + 2} = F(F(z_n)) \), so perhaps \( z_{n + 2} = M^2 z_n \), where \( M^2 \) is the matrix squared.

But \( M \) has eigenvalues \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \), so \( M^2 \) has eigenvalues \( 2 \) and \( 2 \). So, \( M^2 \) is a positive definite matrix with both eigenvalues equal to 2.

Thus, \( M^2 \) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, since both eigenvalues are equal.

Wait, let me compute \( M^2 \):

\( M = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ \sqrt{2} - 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \)

Compute \( M^2 = M \times M \):

First element: 1*1 + 1*(√2 - 1) = 1 + √2 - 1 = √2

Second element: 1*1 + 1*(-1) = 1 - 1 = 0

Third element: (√2 - 1)*1 + (-1)*(√2 - 1) = √2 - 1 - √2 + 1 = 0

Fourth element: (√2 - 1)*1 + (-1)*(-1) = √2 - 1 + 1 = √2

Thus, \( M^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} = \sqrt{2} I \)

So, \( M^2 = \sqrt{2} I \)

Therefore, \( M^n \) can be expressed as \( (M^2)^{n/2} = ( \sqrt{2} I )^{n/2} = (2)^{n/4} I \), but this only holds when \( n \) is even.

Wait, but \( M^2 = \sqrt{2} I \), so \( M^4 = (M^2)^2 = ( \sqrt{2} I )^2 = 2 I \), so \( M^4 = 2 I \)

Therefore, \( M^{2k} = (M^4)^k = (2 I)^k = 2^k I \)

Thus, for even \( n = 2k \), \( M^n = 2^k I \)

For odd \( n = 2k + 1 \), \( M^n = M^{2k} \times M = 2^k M \)

Therefore, \( M^n = \begin{cases} 2^{n/2} I & \text{if } n \text{ is even} \\ 2^{(n - 1)/2} M & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \end{cases} \)

Therefore, \( M^n = \begin{pmatrix} 2^{n/2} & 0 \\ 0 & 2^{n/2} \end{pmatrix} \) if \( n \) is even, and \( M^n = \begin{pmatrix} 2^{(n - 1)/2} & 2^{(n - 1)/2} \\ 2^{(n - 1)/2} & 2^{(n - 1)/2} \end{pmatrix} \) if \( n \) is odd.

Therefore, \( M^n z_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 2^{n/2} & 0 \\ 0 & 2^{n/2} \end{pmatrix} z_0 \) if \( n \) is even,

Or \( M^n z_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 2^{(n - 1)/2} & 2^{(n - 1)/2} \\ 2^{(n - 1)/2} & 2^{(n - 1)/2} \end{pmatrix} z_0 \) if \( n \) is odd.

Therefore, \( z_n = M^n z_0 \) is either:

- If \( n \) is even: \( 2^{n/2} z_0 \)

- If \( n \) is odd: \( \begin{pmatrix} 2^{(n - 1)/2} & 2^{(n - 1)/2} \\ 2^{(n - 1)/2} & 2^{(n - 1)/2} \end{pmatrix} z_0 \)

But wait, let me verify this:

Given \( M^2 = \sqrt{2} I \), so \( M^2 z_0 = \sqrt{2} z_0 \)

Thus, \( M^4 z_0 = M^2 (M^2 z_0 ) = \sqrt{2} ( \sqrt{2} z_0 ) = 2 z_0 \)

Similarly, \( M^6 z_0 = M^4 (M^2 z_0 ) = 2 ( \sqrt{2} z_0 ) = 2 \sqrt{2} z_0 \)

Therefore, for even \( n \), \( z_n = 2^{n/2} z_0 \)

For odd \( n \), \( z_n = 2^{(n - 1)/2} z_0 \)

Wait, but that can't be, because when we computed \( z_2 \), it was \( \frac{75,076 + 275i}{74,530} \), which is not equal to \( 2^2 z_0 \) nor \( 2^{1} z_0 \).

Wait, so perhaps my earlier conclusion is incorrect.

Wait, no, because if \( M^2 = \sqrt{2} I \), then \( M^{2k} = ( \sqrt{2} I )^k = ( \sqrt{2} )^k I \). So, \( M^{2k} z_0 = ( \sqrt{2} )^k z_0 \)

Similarly, for odd \( n = 2k + 1 \), \( M^{2k + 1} = M^{2k} M = ( \sqrt{2} )^k M \), so \( M^{2k + 1} z_0 = ( \sqrt{2} )^k M z_0 \)

Therefore, \( z_n = \begin{cases} ( \sqrt{2} )^{n/2} z_0 & \text{if } n \text{ is even} \\ ( \sqrt{2} )^{(n - 1)/2} M z_0 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \end{cases} \)

But according to our earlier computation, \( z_2 = \frac{75,076 + 275i}{74,530} \), which is a complex number, whereas \( ( \sqrt{2} )^2 z_0 = 2 z_0 \), which is a real number ( 2*(1 + i ) = 2 + 2i ), which is different from \( z_2 \).

Similarly, \( ( \sqrt{2} )^{1} M z_0 \) would be \( \sqrt{2} \times M z_0 \), which is a different complex number.

Therefore, my assumption that \( M^{2k} = ( \sqrt{2} )^k I \) is incorrect because \( M^{2k} = (M^2)^k = ( \sqrt{2} I )^k = ( \sqrt{2} )^k I \), which is correct, but \( z_n \) is \( M^n z_0 \), not \( M^n \) multiplied by \( z_0 \).

Wait, no, in our case, \( M^n z_0 \) is equal to \( ( \sqrt{2} )^{n/2} z_0 \) if \( n \) is even, and \( ( \sqrt{2} )^{(n - 1)/2} M z_0 \) if \( n \) is odd.

But \( M z_0 \) is \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ \sqrt{2} - 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ \sqrt{2} - 2 \end{pmatrix} \)

So, \( M z_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ \sqrt{2} - 2 \end{pmatrix} \)

Therefore, \( z_n = \begin{pmatrix} 2^{n/2} & 0 \\ 0 & 2^{n/2} \end{pmatrix} z_0 \) if \( n \) is even,

Or \( z_n = \begin{pmatrix} 2^{(n - 1)/2} & 2^{(n - 1)/2} \\ 2^{(n - 1)/2} & 2^{(n - 1)/2} \end{pmatrix} z_0 \) if \( n \) is odd.

But to write this in terms of components, we can write:

If \( n \) is even:

\( z_n = 2^{n/2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = 2^{n/2} (1 + i ) \)

If \( n \) is odd:

\( z_n = \begin{pmatrix} 2^{(n - 1)/2} & 2^{(n - 1)/2} \\ 2^{(n - 1)/2} & 2^{(n - 1)/2} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = 2^{(n - 1)/2} (1 + 1 ) = 2^{(n + 1)/2} \)

Wait, that seems too simplified.

Wait, no, actually, \( M z_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ \sqrt{2} - 2 \end{pmatrix} \), so scaling by \( 2^{(n - 1)/2} \) gives \( z_n = 2^{(n - 1)/2} M z_0 \)

So, if we write \( z_n \) as:

If \( n \) is even:

\( z_n = 2^{n/2} (1 + i ) \)

If \( n \) is odd:

\( z_n = 2^{(n - 1)/2} (2, \sqrt{2} - 2 ) \), which is a complex number.

But in the problem statement, we have to compute \( z_{2002} \). Since 2002 is even, so \( z_{2002} = 2^{2002/2} (1 + i ) = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \)

But \( 2^{1001} \times (1 + i ) \) is a very large complex number, but the problem is asking for \( z_{2002} \). However, the problem didn't specify to compute it numerically but to find \( z_{2002} \). So, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that \( M^n = \begin{pmatrix} 2^{n/2} & 0 \\ 0 & 2^{n/2} \end{pmatrix} \) if \( n \) is even, which might not be correct because \( M^n \) is not just a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, but a matrix with 1s and something else.

Wait, no, according to the earlier computation, \( M^2 = \sqrt{2} I \), so \( M^2 = \sqrt{2} I \). Therefore, \( M^4 = (M^2)^2 = ( \sqrt{2} I )^2 = 2 I \), so \( M^4 = 2 I \). Therefore, \( M^{4k} = (2)^k I \). Therefore, for even \( n = 4k \), \( M^n = 2^{k} I \).

For odd \( n = 4k + 1 \), \( M^n = M^{4k} M = 2^{k} M \)

Similarly, for odd \( n = 4k + 3 \), \( M^n = M^{4k + 2} M = (2^{k} I ) M = 2^{k} M \)

But in our case, \( n = 2002 \). Let's compute \( 2002 \) modulo 4:

2002 divided by 4 is 500 * 4 = 2000, so 2002 = 4 * 500 + 2. So, 2002 is congruent to 2 mod 4. Therefore, \( n = 4k + 2 \), where \( k = 500 \). Therefore, \( M^{2002} = (M^4 )^{500} M^2 = (2 I )^{500} ( \sqrt{2} I ) = 2^{500} \sqrt{2} I = 2^{500.5} I = (2^{500} ) \sqrt{2} I \)

Wait, but if \( n = 4k + 2 \), then \( M^n = (M^4 )^k M^2 = (2 I )^k ( \sqrt{2} I ) = 2^k \sqrt{2} I \). Therefore, \( M^{2002} = 2^{500} \sqrt{2} I \). So, \( M^{2002} z_0 = 2^{500} \sqrt{2} (1 + i ) \)

But wait, in our earlier computation, for \( n = 2 \), \( M^2 z_0 = \sqrt{2} z_0 \). Similarly, for \( n = 4 \), \( M^4 z_0 = 2 z_0 \), and so on.

Therefore, for \( n = 4k + 2 \), \( M^n z_0 = 2^{k} \sqrt{2} z_0 \)

So, plugging in \( n = 2002 = 4*500 + 2 \), \( M^{2002} z_0 = 2^{500} \sqrt{2} z_0 \)

Therefore, \( z_{2002} = 2^{500} \sqrt{2} z_0 \)

But \( z_0 = 1 + i \), so:

\( z_{2002} = 2^{500} \sqrt{2} (1 + i ) = 2^{500} \sqrt{2} + 2^{500} \sqrt{2} i \)

But this is an extremely large number, which seems impractical.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that \( z_{n} = M^n z_0 \). Alternatively, since \( M^n \) is a matrix, perhaps we can write \( z_n \) in terms of \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \). But regardless, since \( M \) is diagonalizable, and both eigenvalues are real, but one is positive and the other is negative, which complicates the transformation.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that \( M \) is a rotation-scaling matrix with eigenvalues \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \), which are related to the rotation angle.

Wait, \( \sqrt{2} \) is \( 2 \cos( \pi / 8 ) \), but not exactly. Actually, \( \cos( \pi / 8 ) = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}} / 2 \approx 0.9239 \), which is not \( \sqrt{2} \). So, perhaps not directly applicable.

Alternatively, since \( M \) is a scaled rotation matrix, perhaps \( z_n \) can be expressed as \( 2^{n/2} ( \cos ( \theta / 2 ) + i \sin ( \theta / 2 ) ) \), but I'm not sure.

Wait, given that \( M \) is a rotation-scaling matrix with eigenvalues \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \), then \( M \) can be written as \( 2 \cos \theta I + \sqrt{2} \sin \theta J \) where \( J \) is the imaginary unit matrix, but this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that \( M \) is a rotation matrix scaled by \( \sqrt{2} \), so \( M = \sqrt{2} R \), where \( R \) is a rotation matrix with angle \( \pi / 4 \), since \( \cos(\pi / 4) = \sin(\pi / 4) = \sqrt{2}/2 \). Wait, but \( \sqrt{2} R \) would have eigenvalues \( \sqrt{2} e^{i \pi / 4} \) and \( \sqrt{2} e^{-i \pi / 4} \), which are \( \sqrt{2} ( \cos( \pi / 4 ) + i \sin( \pi / 4 ) ) \) and \( \sqrt{2} ( \cos( \pi / 4 ) - i \sin( \pi / 4 ) ) \), which are \( 1 + i \) and \( 1 - i \). But our eigenvalues are \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \), so that's a different scaling. So, perhaps it's not a rotation matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps \( M \) is a scaling matrix with eigenvalues \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \), so it scales vectors by \( \sqrt{2} \) in one direction and \( -\sqrt{2} \) in the other. Therefore, it's similar to a scaling by \( \sqrt{2} \) and a reflection. So, it's a reflection followed by scaling.

Therefore, perhaps \( M \) can be expressed as \( S R \), where \( S \) is a scaling matrix and \( R \) is a rotation matrix. But this might complicate things further.

Alternatively, since \( M^2 = \sqrt{2} I \), as we found earlier, then \( M^4 = 2 I \), so \( M^{4k} = 2^k I \), so \( M^{4k + 2} = (M^{4k}) M^2 = 2^k \sqrt{2} I \). Therefore, \( M^{2k + 2} = 2^{k + 1} \sqrt{2} I \).

Therefore, for \( n \) even, \( n = 2k \), \( M^n = 2^{k} I \)

For \( n \) odd, \( n = 2k + 1 \), \( M^n = (2^k ) M \)

So, \( z_n = M^n z_0 = \) if \( n \) even: \( 2^{n/2} z_0 \); if \( n \) odd: \( 2^{(n - 1)/2} M z_0 \)

But \( n = 2002 \) is even, so \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} z_0 \)

Therefore, \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \)

But the problem is asking for \( z_{2002} \). Unless there's a simplification or a trick, I think this is as far as I can go.

But let me verify with the earlier computation:

From \( z_{2} = \frac{75,076 + 275i}{74,530} \)

Compute \( 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \). Well, \( 2^{1001} \) is a huge number, but perhaps it's equal to \( z_2 \) scaled by a factor? Let's see.

Compute \( 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \) divided by \( z_2 \):

\( (2^{1001} (1 + i )) / ( (75,076 + 275i)/74,530 ) = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) * 74,530 / (75,076 + 275i ) \)

But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, consider that \( z_{n + 2} = M^2 z_n = \sqrt{2} z_n \), so it's a geometric sequence with ratio \( \sqrt{2} \).

Wait, if \( z_{n + 2} = \sqrt{2} z_n \), then for even \( n \), \( z_n = z_0 \times ( \sqrt{2} )^{n/2} \), and for odd \( n \), \( z_n = z_0 \times ( \sqrt{2} )^{(n - 1)/2} \)

But wait, in our earlier computation, \( z_2 = \frac{75,076 + 275i}{74,530} \approx 1.004 + 0.036i \), and \( z_0 = 1 + i \)

Compute \( ( \sqrt{2} )^1 z_0 = \sqrt{2} (1 + i ) \approx 1.4142 (1 + i ) \approx 2.4142 + 1.4142i \), which is different from \( z_2 \). So, the ratio isn't \( \sqrt{2} \). Therefore, that assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing \( z_2 \). Let me recompute \( z_2 \):

\( z_2 = F(z_1) = F(z_0 + i ) = F(1 + i + i ) = F(1 + 2i ) \)

Compute \( F(1 + 2i ) = \frac{1 + 2i + 1}{1 - (1 + 2i ) + (1 + 2i )^2 } = \frac{2 + 2i}{1 - 1 - 2i + (1 + 4i - 4 ) } = \frac{2 + 2i}{ (1 - 1 + 1 ) + (-2i + 4i ) } = \frac{2 + 2i}{1 + 2i } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( 1 - 2i \):

\( \frac{(2 + 2i )(1 - 2i )}{1 + 4} = \frac{2 - 4i + 2i - 4i^2 }{5 } = \frac{2 - 2i + 4 }{5 } = \frac{6 - 2i }{5 } = 1.2 - 0.4i \), which matches the earlier computation.

But if \( z_{n + 2} = \sqrt{2} z_n \), then \( z_2 = \sqrt{2} z_0 \), but \( \sqrt{2} (1 + i ) \approx 1.4142 + 1.4142i \), which is different from \( z_2 \approx 1.2 - 0.4i \). So, that can't be.

Therefore, my earlier assumption is wrong. The sequence isn't a simple geometric progression.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the general solution of the recurrence relation.

Since \( z_{n + 2} = M^2 z_n \), which is \( \sqrt{2} z_n \). Therefore, the recurrence is \( z_{n + 2} = \sqrt{2} z_n \)

Therefore, for even \( n \), \( z_n = z_0 \times ( \sqrt{2} )^{n / 2 } \), and for odd \( n \), \( z_n = z_0 \times ( \sqrt{2} )^{(n - 1)/2 } \)

But as observed earlier, this doesn't hold with the computed \( z_2 \). Alternatively, perhaps this is because the recurrence is only valid for \( n \geq 0 \), but in reality, the mapping is applied 2002 times, which is even, hence \( n = 2002 \) is even, so \( z_{2002} = z_0 \times ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001 } \)

But in the previous computation, \( z_2 = z_0 \times ( \sqrt{2} )^1 \), which is not matching.

Wait, let me compute \( z_4 \):

Compute \( z_3 = F(z_2 ) = F( (75,076 + 275i ) / 74,530 + i ) = \frac{ (75,076 + 275i ) / 74,530 + 1 }{ 1 - ( (75,076 + 275i ) / 74,530 + 1 ) + ( (75,076 + 275i ) / 74,530 + 1 )^2 } \)

This is going to be very messy, so perhaps recognizing that \( z_{n + 2} = \sqrt{2} z_n \), so if \( n = 2002 \), then \( z_{2002} = \sqrt{2}^{1001} z_0 \), which is \( 2^{1001/2} z_0 \). But \( 1001 \) is odd, so \( z_{2002} = 2^{500.5} z_0 \). However, \( 2^{500.5} = \sqrt{2^{1001}} \), which is a huge number.

But the problem is asking for \( z_{2002} \), so perhaps we need to express it in terms of \( z_0 \) scaled by \( 2^{1001} \). But perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps a different approach: since \( z_{n + 2} = \sqrt{2} z_n \), then for \( n = 2002 \), which is even, \( z_{2002} = \sqrt{2}^{1001} z_0 = 2^{1001 / 2} z_0 = 2^{500.5} z_0 \). But that seems unwieldy.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the transformation matrix \( M \) is related to a rotation and scaling, but with eigenvalues \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \), the transformation isn't a pure rotation, but a combination of scaling and reflection.

Alternatively, perhaps using eigenvalues to express \( M^n \) as \( M^n = (M^2)^{n/2} = ( \sqrt{2} I )^{n/2} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{n/2} I \) if \( n \) is even, and \( M^n = M^{n - 1} M = M^{n - 1} ( - \sqrt{2} I ) = - ( \sqrt{2} )^{(n - 1)/2} M \) if \( n \) is odd.

But in our case, \( n = 2002 \) is even, so \( M^{2002} = (M^2)^{1001} = ( \sqrt{2} I )^{1001} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001} I \)

Therefore, \( M^{2002} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001} I \)

Therefore, \( M^{2002} z_0 = ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001} z_0 \)

Thus, \( z_{2002} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001} z_0 = 2^{1001 / 2} z_0 \)

Which is \( z_{2002} = 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \), which is \( 2^{500} \sqrt{2} (1 + i ) \)

So, \( z_{2002} = 2^{500} \sqrt{2} + 2^{500} \sqrt{2} i \)

But perhaps we can write this as \( z_{2002} = \sqrt{2} (1 + i ) 2^{500} \)

But the problem is likely expecting an exact value, and \( 2^{1001} z_0 \) is a clean expression, but it's extremely large. So, perhaps the answer is \( 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \). But since 2002 is even, \( z_{2002} = ( M^2 )^{1001} z_0 = ( \sqrt{2} I )^{1001} z_0 = ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001} z_0 \), which is \( 2^{1001/2} z_0 \). But \( 2^{1001/2} = \sqrt{2^{1001}} \), which is \( 2^{500} \sqrt{2} \)

So, \( z_{2002} = 2^{500} \sqrt{2} (1 + i ) \)

But the problem is expecting a boxed expression, likely in terms of \( z_0 \), but since \( z_{2002} = M^{2002} z_0 = ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001} z_0 \), so \( z_{2002} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001} z_0 \). Alternatively, express \( z_{2002} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001} (1 + i ) \)

But \( ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001} = 2^{500.5} = 2^{500} \sqrt{2} \), so \( z_{2002} = 2^{500} \sqrt{2} (1 + i ) \)

But maybe the problem expects an expression in terms of \( z_0 \), but given that \( z_{2002} \) is expressed in terms of \( z_0 \), but the problem didn't specify whether they want it in terms of \( z_0 \) or another way.

Wait, perhaps the key is to notice that since \( M \) has eigenvalues \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \), and the transformation alternates signs every two steps. Therefore, for even steps, the transformation is a scaling by \( \sqrt{2}^{n/2} \), and for odd steps, it's a scaling by \( -\sqrt{2}^{(n - 1)/2} \). Therefore, since 2002 is even, \( z_{2002} = \sqrt{2}^{1001} z_0 \), which is \( 2^{1001/2} z_0 \). But 1001 is odd, so \( 2^{500.5} z_0 \). But perhaps the problem expects an expression in terms of \( z_0 \), scaled by \( 2^{1001} \), so \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} z_0 \), but that seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Given that each step is a linear transformation, and the composition after 2002 steps is \( (M^2)^{1001} \), which is \( ( \sqrt{2} I )^{1001} \), so \( z_{2002} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001} z_0 \). Therefore, \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001/2} z_0 = \sqrt{2^{1001}} z_0 \). Which is \( z_{2002} = 2^{500} \sqrt{2} (1 + i ) \), which is a clean expression.

Therefore, the answer is \( 2^{500} \sqrt{2} (1 + i ) \). But that can be written as \( 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \), but since 2^{500.5} is equal to \( \sqrt{2^{1001}} \), it's the same thing.

Alternatively, since \( 2^{500} \sqrt{2} = 2^{500} \times 2^{1/2} = 2^{500.5} \), so it's the same.

But the problem is expecting an answer, so perhaps I should write it as \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \), but wait, no, because \( M^{2002} = (M^2)^{1001} = ( \sqrt{2} I )^{1001} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001} I = 2^{500.5} I \). Therefore, \( z_{2002} = 2^{500.5} z_0 \), which is \( 2^{500} \sqrt{2} (1 + i ) \)

But perhaps the problem expects an answer in terms of \( z_0 \), so \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \). But \( 2^{1001} \) is \( (2^{1000}) \times 2 \), but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} z_0 \), but that seems incorrect because \( z_{n + 2} = \sqrt{2} z_n \), so \( z_{2002} = \sqrt{2}^{1001} z_0 = 2^{1001/2} z_0 \). So, \( 2^{1001/2} = 2^{500} \times 2^{1/2} \). Therefore, \( z_{2002} = 2^{500} \sqrt{2} z_0 \). But \( \sqrt{2} z_0 = \sqrt{2} (1 + i ) \). So, \( z_{2002} = 2^{500} \sqrt{2} (1 + i ) \), which is \( 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \).

But perhaps the problem expects to write it as \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \), but that would be incorrect, because the scaling factor is \( 2^{1001/2} \), not \( 2^{1001} \)

Alternatively, perhaps I need to note that \( z_{2002} = M^{2002} z_0 = (M^2)^{1001} z_0 = ( \sqrt{2} I )^{1001} z_0 = 2^{500.5} z_0 \). So, yes, \( z_{2002} = 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \). Since 500.5 is 500 + 0.5, it's \( 2^{500} \times 2^{0.5} (1 + i ) \), which is \( 2^{500} \sqrt{2} (1 + i ) \)

But since \( 2^{500} \times \sqrt{2} = 2^{500} \times 2^{1/2} = 2^{500.5} \), so that's consistent.

Therefore, the answer is \( z_{2002} = 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \). But 500.5 is 1001/2, so \( 2^{1001/2} (1 + i ) \), which is \( \sqrt{2^{1001}} (1 + i ) \)

But 2^{1001} is a huge number, but perhaps in the problem, the answer is simply expressed as \( 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \), recognizing that \( 2^{1001} = (2^{1/2})^{2002} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{2002} \), which is larger than our case.

Wait, but since \( z_{2002} = 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \), and \( 2^{500.5} = \sqrt{2^{1001}} \), then perhaps the answer is \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) / 2^{500} \), which is \( 2^{501} (1 + i ) \). But that's \( 2^{501} (1 + i ) \), which is different.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the transformation is applied 2002 times, which is even, so \( z_{2002} = (M^2)^{1001} z_0 = ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001} z_0 \), which is \( 2^{1001/2} z_0 = 2^{500.5} z_0 \). So, \( z_{2002} = 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \). But perhaps expressing it as \( 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \) is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \), but scaled by \( \sqrt{2} \). But this is speculative.

Given that \( z_{2002} = 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \), which is equal to \( \sqrt{2^{1001}} (1 + i ) \), perhaps the problem expects the answer in this form, or perhaps the answer is \( 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \) as a boxed expression.

But considering the problem, it's likely expecting an exact value, so perhaps the answer is \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \). But wait, if \( z_{n + 2} = \sqrt{2} z_n \), then \( z_{2002} = \sqrt{2}^{1001} z_0 = 2^{500.5} z_0 \), so it's \( 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \). So, I think that's the precise answer.

But perhaps to express it as \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \), which is incorrect, because 2002 is even, so the scaling factor is \( \sqrt{2}^{1001} \), not \( 2^{1001} \). So, I think \( 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \) is the correct answer.

But in the problem statement, it's 2002 times, so perhaps the answer is \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \), but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the key lies in noticing that \( z_{n + 2} = \sqrt{2} z_n \), so \( z_{2002} = \sqrt{2}^{1001} z_0 = 2^{500.5} z_0 \). So, \( z_{2002} = 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \), which is \( \sqrt{2^{1001}} (1 + i ) \)

But perhaps in the problem statement, it's expecting an integer or a simplified expression, but in this case, 2^{500.5} is not an integer, but it's a clean expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer as \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \), but scaling up incorrectly.

Wait, given that \( M^2 = \sqrt{2} I \), so \( M^{2k} = ( \sqrt{2} )^k I \). Therefore, \( M^{2002} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001} I \). Therefore, \( z_{2002} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{1001} z_0 = 2^{500.5} z_0 \)

So, yes, the answer is \( z_{2002} = 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \)

But in the problem, 2002 is an integer, so 500.5 is a half-integer, but since exponents can be fractional, it's acceptable.

But perhaps to write it as \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \), since \( 2^{500.5} = \sqrt{2^{1001}} \), so it's equal to \( \sqrt{2}^{1001} (1 + i ) \). Therefore, perhaps the answer is \( z_{2002} = \sqrt{2}^{1001} (1 + i ) \)

But the problem is expecting an exact expression, so perhaps expressing in terms of \( 2^{1001} \) is better.

But in conclusion, I think the answer is \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \). But given the recurrence, I think it's \( z_{2002} = 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \). However, perhaps the problem expects an answer in terms of \( z_0 \), which is \( 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \), as \( z_{2002} = M^{2002} z_0 = ( M^2 )^{1001} z_0 = ( \sqrt{2} I )^{1001} z_0 = 2^{500.5} z_0 \). So, in either case, the answer is expressed in terms of \( z_0 \), so perhaps the answer is \( 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \)

But, perhaps, since in the problem statement, the starting point is \( z_0 \), and the recurrence is \( z_{n + 2} = M z_n \), so \( z_{2002} = M^{2002} z_0 \), which is \( 2^{500.5} z_0 \), so I think the correct answer is \( 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \), but that can be written as \( \sqrt{2^{1001}} (1 + i ) \)

But perhaps the problem expects the answer as \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \), recognizing that \( 2^{500.5} = 2^{1001} \times 2^{-1000.5} \), but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation in the eigenvalues.

Wait, \( M \) is \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ \sqrt{2} & 1 \end{pmatrix} \). The eigenvalues are \( 1 + i \) and \( 1 - i \). So, \( M^{2002} = (1 + i )^{2002} (1 - i )^{2002} I \). But \( (1 + i )^{2002} (1 - i )^{2002} = ( (1 + i )(1 - i ) )^{2002} = (1 + 1 )^{2002} = 2^{2002} \). Therefore, \( M^{2002} = 2^{2002} I \). Therefore, \( z_{2002} = 2^{2002} I z_0 = 2^{2002} z_0 \). But this contradicts the earlier result where \( z_{2002} = \sqrt{2}^{1001} z_0 \)

Wait, hold on, this is a contradiction.

But, wait, if \( M^{2002} = 2^{2002} I \), then \( z_{2002} = 2^{2002} z_0 \). But earlier, I thought \( M^{2002} = ( \sqrt{2} I )^{1001} \), which is \( 2^{500.5} I \). But perhaps that was incorrect.

Wait, if \( M \) is diagonalizable with eigenvalues \( \lambda_1 = 1 + i \), \( \lambda_2 = 1 - i \), and \( M = P D P^{-1} \), where \( D = diag(1 + i, 1 - i ) \), then \( M^n = P D^n P^{-1} \). Then, \( M^{2002} = P D^{2002} P^{-1} \). But unless \( M \) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, which it's not, we cannot directly say that \( M^{2002} = ( \sqrt{2} I )^{1001} \).

Wait, but wait, let me compute \( M^2 \). If \( M = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ \sqrt{2} & 1 \end{pmatrix} \), then \( M^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\ 2\sqrt{2} & 2 \end{pmatrix} \). As before, \( M^2 = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ \sqrt{2} & 1 \end{pmatrix} \). So, \( M^2 = 2 z_0 \). Therefore, \( M^4 = ( M^2 )^2 = (2 z_0 )^2 = 4 z_0^2 \). Therefore, \( M^{2n} = ( M^2 )^n = ( 2 z_0 )^n \). Therefore, for even \( n = 2002 \), \( M^{2002} = (2 z_0 )^{1001} \). So, \( M^{2002} = 2^{1001} z_0^{1001} \). But in our case, \( z_{2002} = M^{2002} z_0 = 2^{1001} z_0^{1001} \). Which is a different result than earlier.

Wait, but this is conflicting with the earlier assumption that \( M^{2002} = 2^{2002} I \). It seems that \( M^2 = 2 z_0 \), so \( M^{2002} = (M^2)^{1001} = (2 z_0 )^{1001} = 2^{1001} z_0^{1001} \). So, the correct result is \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} z_0^{1001} \). Hmm.

But that contradicts the other result where \( z_{2002} = 2^{500.5} (1 + i ) \). So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps my initial calculation was wrong.

Wait, let me re-examine the recurrence.

If \( z_{n + 2} = M^2 z_n \), then \( z_{n + 2} = 2 z_n \). Therefore, \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} z_0 \). So, this is a better approach.

But earlier, I thought \( M^2 = 2 z_0 \). But \( M^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\ 2 \sqrt{2} & 2 \end{pmatrix} \). So, \( M^2 \) is not a scalar multiple of \( z_0 \), which is \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ \sqrt{2} & 1 \end{pmatrix} \). So, \( M^2 \) is not a multiple of \( z_0 \), hence \( z_{2002} = M^{2002} z_0 \) cannot be written as \( 2^{1001} z_0 \), but only as \( 2^{1001} z_0^{1001} \). Therefore, the original approach was wrong.

Wait, so this is a significant mistake.

Wait, so the key is that \( M^2 \) is not a scalar multiple of \( z_0 \), but a matrix that acts on vectors. Therefore, \( z_{2002} = M^{2002} z_0 \) cannot be reduced to \( 2^{1001} z_0 \), but rather, it's a combination of the basis vectors scaled by their respective eigenvalues.

But given that \( M^2 = 2 z_0 \), that is, \( M^2 = 2 z_0 \), meaning that \( z_{n + 2} = 2 z_n \), so \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} z_0 \). But since \( M^2 \) is a matrix, not a scalar multiple, perhaps I need to represent \( M^2 \) in terms of basis vectors.

But since \( M^2 \) is a 2x2 matrix, it can be expressed as a combination of \( z_0 \) and \( z_1 \). Let's compute \( M^2 \) in terms of \( z_0 \) and \( z_1 \).

Given \( z_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), \( z_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

Compute \( M^2 \) as a matrix:

\( M^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ \sqrt{2} & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ \sqrt{2} & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1*1 + 1*\sqrt{2} & 1*1 + 1*1 \\ \sqrt{2}*1 + 1*\sqrt{2} & \sqrt{2}*1 + 1*1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \sqrt{2} & 2 \\ 2 \sqrt{2} & 2 \end{pmatrix} \)

So, \( M^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \sqrt{2} & 2 \\ 2 \sqrt{2} & 2 \end{pmatrix} \)

Then, \( M^2 z_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \sqrt{2} & 2 \\ 2 \sqrt{2} & 2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (1 + \sqrt{2}) + 2 \\ 2 \sqrt{2} + 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 + \sqrt{2} \\ 2 + 2 \sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} \)

Similarly, \( M^2 z_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \sqrt{2} & 2 \\ 2 \sqrt{2} & 2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2(1 + \sqrt{2}) + 2 \\ 2 \sqrt{2}*2 + 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 + 2 \sqrt{2} \\ 4 \sqrt{2} + 2 \end{pmatrix} \)

Thus, the matrix \( M^2 \) can be expressed as a linear combination of \( z_0 \) and \( z_1 \):

\( M^2 = (1 + \sqrt{2}) z_0 + (2 \sqrt{2} + 2) z_1 \)

But since \( z_1 = \sqrt{2} z_0 \), substitute:

\( M^2 = (1 + \sqrt{2}) z_0 + (2 \sqrt{2} + 2)( \sqrt{2} z_0 ) \)

Compute the second term:

\( (2 \sqrt{2} + 2)( \sqrt{2} z_0 ) = (2 \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}) z_0 + (2 \cdot \sqrt{2}) z_0 = (4) z_0 + (2 \sqrt{2}) z_0 \)

Therefore, total:

\( M^2 = (1 + \sqrt{2} + 4 + 2 \sqrt{2}) z_0 \)

Simplify:

\( (1 + 4) + ( \sqrt{2} + 2 \sqrt{2} ) = 5 + 3 \sqrt{2} \)

So, \( M^2 = (5 + 3 \sqrt{2}) z_0 \)

Therefore, \( z_{2002} = M^{2002} z_0 = (M^2)^{1001} z_0 = (5 + 3 \sqrt{2})^{1001} z_0 \)

But \( 5 + 3 \sqrt{2} \) is approximately 7.124, which is \( ( \sqrt{2} + 2 )^2 \) because \( (\sqrt{2} + 2 )^2 = 2 + 4 \sqrt{2} + 4 = 6 + 4 \sqrt{2} \). Hmm, not quite.

Alternatively, \( 5 + 3 \sqrt{2} \) is just a constant, so \( z_{2002} = (5 + 3 \sqrt{2})^{1001} z_0 \). But this doesn't seem to simplify.

Wait, but earlier we thought \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} z_0 \), but that was incorrect because \( M^2 \) is not a scalar multiple of \( z_0 \), but a matrix acting on \( z_0 \).

So, perhaps the correct expression is \( z_{2002} = (M^2)^{1001} z_0 = (5 + 3 \sqrt{2})^{1001} z_0 \)

But let me verify with \( n = 2 \):

Compute \( z_2 = M^2 z_0 = (5 + 3 \sqrt{2}) z_0 \). So, \( z_2 = (5 + 3 \sqrt{2}) z_0 \). But from our previous computation, \( z_2 = \frac{75,076 + 275i}{74,530} z_0 \). Let's compute \( (5 + 3 \sqrt{2}) z_0 \):

\( z_0 = \frac{75,076 + 275i}{74,530} \), so \( (5 + 3 \sqrt{2}) z_0 = (5 + 3 \sqrt{2}) \frac{75,076 + 275i}{74,530} \)

Compute numerator:

\( (5 + 3 \sqrt{2})(75,076 + 275i ) = 5*75,076 + 5*275i + 3 \sqrt{2}*75,076 + 3 \sqrt{2}*275i \)

Calculate each term:

1. \( 5*75,076 = 375,380 \)
2. \( 5*275i = 1,375i \)
3. \( 3 \sqrt{2}*75,076 ≈ 3*1.4142*75,076 ≈ 3*1.0608*75,076 ≈ 318,280.8 \)
4. \( 3 \sqrt{2}*275i ≈ 3*1.4142*275i ≈ 1,180.83i \)

Adding real parts: 375,380 + 318,280.8 ≈ 693,660.8

Adding imaginary parts: 1,375i + 1,180.83i ≈ 2,555.83i

Thus, \( (5 + 3 \sqrt{2}) z_0 ≈ \frac{693,660.8 + 2,555.83i}{74,530} \approx \frac{693,660.8}{74,530} + \frac{2,555.83i}{74,530} ≈ 9.19 + 0.0349i \)

But from our calculation, \( z_2 = \frac{75,076 + 275i}{74,530} \times (5 + 3 \sqrt{2}) ≈ 9.19 + 0.0349i \), which matches.

Thus, \( z_{2002} = (5 + 3 \sqrt{2})^{1001} z_0 \). But \( 5 + 3 \sqrt{2} ≈ 7.124 \), so \( (5 + 3 \sqrt{2})^{1001} \) is an enormous number. So, this is unlikely the answer.

But this contradicts our initial assumption where \( z_{2002} = 2^{1001} (1 + i ) \). So, which is correct?

Wait, earlier, with the recurrence \( z_{n + 2} = \sqrt{2} z_n \), we thought \( z_{2002} = \sqrt{2}^{1001} z_0 \approx 2^{500.5} z_0 \), but that was incorrect because \( M^2 \) is a matrix acting on \( z_0 \), so \( z_{2002} \) is not a scalar multiple of \( z_0 \), but rather a combination of \( z_0 \) and \( z_1 \).

Therefore, the correct expression is \( z_{2002} = (5 + 3 \sqrt{2})^{1001} z_0 \)

But that is a massive number, and the problem likely expects a more elegant answer, probably in terms of \( z_0 \), which is a scalar multiple of \( z_0 \).

Wait, but \( z_{2002} = (M^2)^{1001} z_0 = (5 + 3 \sqrt{2})^{1001} z_0 \). But this seems as simplified as it can get.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is \( z_{2002} = (5 + 3 \sqrt{2})^{1001} z_0 \), which can be written as \( z_{2002} = (5 + 3 \sqrt{2})^{1001} z_0 \), but in the problem statement, it's likely expecting a more elegant answer.

Alternatively, maybe note that \( 5 + 3 \sqrt{2} = (1 + \sqrt{2})^2 \). Let me check:

\( (1 + \sqrt{2})^2 = 1 + 2 \sqrt{2} + 2 = 3 + 2 \sqrt{2} \), which is less than 5 + 3 \sqrt{2}. So, no.

Alternatively, \( (1 + \sqrt{2})^3 = 1 + 3 \sqrt{2} + 3*2 + 2 \sqrt{2} = 1 + 3 \sqrt{2} + 6 + 2 \sqrt{2} = 7 + 5 \sqrt{2} \). Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps \( (2 + \sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + 4 \sqrt{2} + 2 = 6 + 4 \sqrt{2} \), which is different.

Alternatively, take the modulus: \( |5 + 3 \sqrt{2}| = \sqrt{25 + 18 \sqrt{2}} \approx 7.124 \). But it's not a perfect power.

Alternatively, expressing it as \( (1 + \sqrt{2})^{1001} \) but that would be \( (1 + \sqrt{2})^{1001} \), which is much larger.

Wait, but \( (1 + \sqrt{2})^{1001} \) is a huge number, and our expression is \( (5 + 3 \sqrt{2})^{1001} \). So, they are different.

Wait, unless \( 5 + 3 \sqrt{2} = (1 + \sqrt{2})^k \) for some k. Let me check for k=3:

\( (1 + \sqrt{2})^3 = 1 + 3 \sqrt{2} + 3*2 + 2 \sqrt{2} = 7 + 5 \sqrt{2} \), which is different from 5 + 3 \sqrt{2}.

k=4: \( (1 + \sqrt{2})^4 = (1 + \sqrt{2})^2 * (1 + \sqrt{2})^2 = (3 + 2 \sqrt{2})^2 = 9 + 12 \sqrt{2} + 8 = 17 + 12 \sqrt{2} \), which is different.

Not matching. So, likely, the expression remains as \( (5 + 3 \sqrt{2})^{1001} z_0 \).

But perhaps, since \( 5 + 3 \sqrt{2} \) is equal to \( (1 + \sqrt{2})^3 \) squared or something, but as above, doesn't hold.

Alternatively, note that \( 5 + 3 \sqrt{2} = (1 + \sqrt{2})^2 + 3 \sqrt{2} \). Not helpful.

Alternatively, let me see if \( 5 + 3 \sqrt{2} \) can be expressed as a power of \( 1 + \sqrt{2} \). Let me compute \( (1 + \sqrt{2})^k \) and see if it equals \( 5 + 3 \sqrt{2} \):

k=1: \( 1 + \sqrt{2} ≈ 2.4142 \)

k=2: \( 3 + 2 \sqrt{2} ≈ 5.8284 \)
