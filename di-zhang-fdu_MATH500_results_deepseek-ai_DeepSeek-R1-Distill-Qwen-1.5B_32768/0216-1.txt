Correct Answer:
The number of $1\times1$ squares in the diagram is $2(n-1)$, the number of $2\times 2$ squares is $n-2$, and the number of $\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}$ squares is also $n-2$ (see diagram).  Solving \[
2(n-1)+n-2+n-2=70
\] we find $n=\boxed{19}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem here about a 3×n grid of points, and it says there are a total of 70 squares of three different sizes. I need to find the value of n. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me visualize the grid. A 3×n grid means there are 3 rows and n columns of points. So, it's like a rectangle with 3 rows and n columns, making a total of 3n points. But the question is about squares whose vertices are points on this grid. So, these squares can be of different sizes, and I need to count them all and set that equal to 70.

The problem mentions three sizes of squares. I'm assuming these are 1×1, 2×2, and 3×3 squares, but let me not jump to conclusions. I should figure out all possible square sizes that can fit into a 3×n grid.

Wait, hold on. A 3×n grid of points can contain squares of various sizes, but the maximum square size that can fit in the grid is determined by the number of rows and columns. Since there are 3 rows, a square cannot have a side longer than 2 units because the vertical distance between the top and bottom would be 2 units if it's a 3×3 grid. Similarly, horizontally, the maximum side length is n-1 units if it's a 3×n grid. Hmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of squares that fit both vertically and horizontally.

Actually, no. The size of the square is determined by the number of points it occupies. In a grid, a square of size k×k (in terms of points) would require k-1 spaces between points. So, if I have a 3×n grid, the largest possible square I can fit is 2×2 because the grid is only 3 rows high. Wait, no, actually, the grid is 3×n, so a square of side length 2 can fit in both dimensions, but a square of side length 3 would require 4 rows, which we don't have. So, the possible square sizes are 1×1, 2×2, and possibly 3×3 if n is large enough. But wait, 3×3 would require 4 points in both directions, which we don't have. So, maybe the largest square size is 2×2.

But the problem mentions three sizes, so maybe 1×1, 2×2, and another size? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the squares can be rotated? But the grid is axis-aligned, so unless the squares are diamond-shaped, which would require the grid to have points arranged in a rotated manner. But the problem says the vertices are points on the grid, but it doesn't specify whether the squares have to be axis-aligned or can be rotated.

Wait, the Asymptote code is given, so maybe I can infer the orientation. Looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing squares with coordinates like (2.95,-0.05) etc., so it seems like the squares are axis-aligned. So, I can probably assume that the squares are not rotated; they are axis-aligned. So, the squares can only be 1×1, 2×2, or possibly 3×3, but I need to confirm.

So, let's consider that. For a 3×n grid, the number of squares of size 1×1, 2×2, and 3×3.

Wait, but in a 3×n grid, the number of 1×1 squares is straightforward. It's (n - 1) columns times (3 - 1) rows, so 2*(n - 1). Similarly, the number of 2×2 squares is (n - 2) columns times (3 - 1) rows, so 2*(n - 2). Wait, but hold on, actually, no, because in a grid, the number of squares of size k×k is (m - k + 1)*(n - k + 1), but in this case, it's a 3×n grid, which is 3 rows and n columns. So, for a square of size k×k, the number of positions it can occupy is (3 - k + 1) * (n - k + 1). Wait, no, hold on. Wait, actually, if it's a 3×n grid, the number of horizontal lines is 4 (since it's 3 rows, so 4 horizontal lines: top, middle, bottom, and bottom). Similarly, the number of vertical lines is n + 1.

But for squares, the side length is the distance between two horizontal lines minus one, so for a 1×1 square, it's 2 units in both directions, but the number of squares is (n - 1)*(3 - 1) = (n - 1)*2. Similarly, for a 2×2 square, it's 3 units in both directions, so (n - 2)*2. For a 3×3 square, it's 4 units in both directions, but since we only have 3 rows, we can't have a 3×3 square, right? Because the vertical distance is only 2 units. So, a 3×3 square would require 4 rows, which we don't have. So, only 1×1 and 2×2 squares fit into a 3×n grid.

Wait, but the problem mentions three sizes. So, maybe I'm wrong in assuming only 1×1 and 2×2. Maybe there's another size? Let me think. Maybe squares that are not aligned with the grid? But if the grid is 3×n, then unless n is larger, the squares can't be larger than 2×2. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the squares can be placed diagonally? So, squares that are rotated 45 degrees. In that case, their side length would be different. For example, a square rotated 45 degrees would have its vertices on the grid points, but it would have a different side length in terms of grid units.

But in that case, the side length would be sqrt(2) times the grid unit. But the problem says the squares are axis-aligned, as the Asymptote code seems to draw axis-aligned squares. So, perhaps I shouldn't consider rotated squares.

Wait, but the problem says "a rectangular 3×n grid of points", so in that case, the grid is axis-aligned, meaning that the squares must be axis-aligned as well. So, the squares can only be 1×1, 2×2, or maybe 3×3 if n is large enough. But since the grid is only 3 rows, a 3×3 square can't be formed because the vertical distance between the top and bottom would require 4 rows. So, only 1×1 and 2×2 squares can fit.

But the problem says three sizes. So, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Perhaps the squares can be of different sizes in different orientations? Wait, but the grid is axis-aligned, so the squares must be axis-aligned.

Wait, hold on, maybe the squares can have different sizes in different directions? For example, squares that are 1×1 in horizontal and 1×1 in vertical, but I don't think that's possible because the grid is 3 rows and n columns, so a square can't have different horizontal and vertical sizes unless it's not axis-aligned.

Wait, no, the squares have to have sides of equal length, so they must be axis-aligned. So, maybe the problem is referring to squares of different sizes in different positions?

Wait, the problem says "three sizes of squares", so maybe it's referring to the side lengths, regardless of their position. So, 1×1, 2×2, and 3×3 squares. So, 1×1, 2×2, and 3×3.

But as we saw earlier, 3×3 squares can't fit into a 3×n grid because they need 4 rows. So, only 1×1 and 2×2 squares can fit. So, why does the problem say three sizes? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the squares can be of different sizes but in different orientations? But the grid is axis-aligned, so squares have to be axis-aligned. So, perhaps the squares are not necessarily aligned with the grid. Wait, no, the vertices must be on the grid points, so squares can be placed anywhere as long as their vertices are on the grid.

Wait, perhaps the squares can be of different orientations, but the side length can vary. Hmm, but in a 3×n grid, the maximum distance between two points is sqrt((n-1)^2 + 2^2) for squares that are rotated.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is referring to squares of different sizes in terms of the number of unit squares they cover, not necessarily their side lengths. But that might not make sense.

Wait, no, the problem says "squares of three sizes", so I think it refers to squares with different side lengths, irrespective of their orientation. So, 1×1, 2×2, and 3×3 squares. But as before, I can't fit a 3×3 square into a 3×n grid. So, maybe the problem is referring to squares in terms of the number of points along the sides, not the side length.

Wait, that might be it. So, for example, a square that is 1×1 would have side length 1 (in terms of points), a square that is 2×2 would have side length 2, and a square that is 3×3 would have side length 3. But in a 3×n grid, can you have a 3×3 square? Let's see: the grid has 3 rows, so the vertical distance is 2 units. So, a square with side length 3 units vertically would require 4 rows, which we don't have. So, yeah, only 1×1 and 2×2 squares can fit. So, why does the problem say three sizes? Maybe it's referring to three different sizes in terms of the number of squares, not the side lengths.

Wait, maybe the squares can be axis-aligned or axis-aligned in different orientations? Hmm, no, the grid is fixed as 3×n, so all squares must be axis-aligned.

Wait, perhaps the squares can be of different sizes but with different numbers of points. For example, a 1×1 square has 4 points, a 2×2 square has 9 points, and a 3×3 square has 16 points. So, maybe the problem is referring to different sizes in terms of the number of points, not the side lengths. Hmm, but that would imply that for each size, the number of squares is different, but the problem says "three sizes", so perhaps the number of squares of each size is 1, 2, and 3? Wait, but the total is 70, so that might not add up.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach it step by step.

First, let's consider the possible square sizes. Since the grid is 3×n, the maximum square that can fit is 2×2, because a 3×3 square would require 4 rows, which we don't have. So, only 1×1 and 2×2 squares. But the problem says three sizes, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the squares can be of different orientations, but in a 3×n grid, squares can be placed in such a way that their sides are not purely horizontal or vertical. For example, squares that are rotated 45 degrees, but that would require the vertical and horizontal distances between points to be equal, which in a 3×n grid, is possible only if n is sufficiently large.

Wait, but in a 3×n grid, the vertical distance is fixed. So, a square rotated 45 degrees would require the horizontal and vertical distances between points to be equal, but in a 3×n grid, the vertical distance is 1 unit (since it's 3 rows), while the horizontal distance can be 1 or 2 units. So, to have a square of side length sqrt(2), which is 1×1 rotated, it would require moving 1 unit horizontally and 1 unit vertically. But in a 3×n grid, the vertical distance is 2 units for 3 rows, so maybe a square of side length sqrt(2) can fit.

Wait, let me calculate. If the square is rotated, its side length would be sqrt( (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2 ). For a square with side length 1×1, the distance between points would be 1 unit. For a square rotated 45 degrees, the side length would be sqrt(2), which is the diagonal of a 1×1 square. So, such a square would have its vertices on the grid points, right?

So, for a rotated square, the side length is sqrt(2). So, in this case, such squares can fit into the 3×n grid. So, now, we have three sizes: 1×1 (non-rotated), 1×1 rotated (sqrt(2) side length), and 2×2 (rotated or non-rotated). Hmm, so that's three sizes.

Wait, but the problem says "three sizes of squares", so perhaps we have three distinct sizes: 1×1, 2×2, and sqrt(2)×sqrt(2). So, 1×1, 2×2, and sqrt(2)×sqrt(2) squares. So, in total, three sizes.

Therefore, the problem is considering both axis-aligned and rotated squares. So, I need to count all such squares.

Okay, so now, let's figure out how many squares of each size exist in a 3×n grid.

First, non-rotated squares:

1. 1×1 squares: These are axis-aligned. The number of such squares can be calculated by considering each possible position where a 1×1 square can fit. In a 3×n grid, the number of 1×1 squares is (n - 1)*(3 - 1) = 2*(n - 1). Wait, no, hold on. Actually, in a grid with m rows and k columns, the number of unit squares is (m - 1)*(k - 1). So, in a 3×n grid, the number of 1×1 squares is (3 - 1)*(n - 1) = 2*(n - 1).

2. 2×2 squares: Similarly, these are axis-aligned. The number of 2×2 squares is (3 - 2)*(n - 2) = 1*(n - 2) = n - 2.

Now, for the rotated squares, which have side length sqrt(2). These are squares that are rotated 45 degrees, so their vertices are on the grid points. To count these, I need to figure out how many positions such squares can occupy in the 3×n grid.

A square with side length sqrt(2) has its vertices at points (i, j), (i+1, j+1), (i, j+2), (i-1, j+1). So, in other words, the square is positioned such that its sides are diagonals of unit squares.

So, to count such squares, I need to see how many positions they can occupy. The square requires a 2x2 area in the grid, so it can't extend beyond the grid's boundaries.

In a 3×n grid, how many 2x2 blocks are there? Well, in terms of the grid, the number of 2x2 blocks is (3 - 1)*(n - 1) = 2*(n - 1). But each 2x2 block can have one such rotated square.

Wait, but each 2x2 block can have only one rotated square, right? Because the rotated square is uniquely determined by its position within the 2x2 block.

So, in a 3×n grid, the number of 2x2 blocks is 2*(n - 1). Each block can contain one sqrt(2)×sqrt(2) rotated square. So, the number of such squares is 2*(n - 1).

Wait, but hold on, in a 3×n grid, the number of 2x2 blocks is 2*(n - 1). But each 2x2 block can contain only one square of side length sqrt(2). So, the number of rotated squares is 2*(n - 1). Hmm, but let me verify.

Wait, actually, in a grid, the number of 2x2 blocks is (rows - 1)*(cols - 1). For a 3×n grid, that's (3 - 1)*(n - 1) = 2*(n - 1). Each 2x2 block can have exactly one rotated square. So, yes, the number of rotated squares is 2*(n - 1).

Therefore, in total, the number of squares is the sum of non-rotated and rotated squares:

Total squares = (2*(n - 1)) + (2*(n - 1)) + (n - 2) = 2n - 2 + 2n - 2 + n - 2 = 5n - 6.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify.

Wait, non-rotated squares: 2*(n - 1).

Rotated squares: 2*(n - 1).

1×1 squares: 2*(n - 1).

Wait, so total squares would be 2*(n - 1) + 2*(n - 1) + (n - 2) = 4n - 4 + n - 2 = 5n - 6.

But the problem states that the total number of squares is 70. So, 5n - 6 = 70.

Solving for n: 5n = 76 => n = 15.2.

Wait, that can't be, because n must be an integer. So, I must have made a mistake in counting.

Wait, let's check the counts again.

First, non-rotated squares: axis-aligned.

In a 3×n grid, the number of 1×1 squares is (3 - 1)*(n - 1) = 2*(n - 1). That's correct.

Number of 2×2 squares: (3 - 2)*(n - 2) = 1*(n - 2). Correct.

Now, rotated squares: sqrt(2)×sqrt(2).

In a 3×n grid, how many positions can a rotated square be placed? As I said, each 2x2 block can contain one such square. The number of 2x2 blocks in a 3×n grid is (3 - 1)*(n - 1) = 2*(n - 1). So, 2*(n - 1) rotated squares. That seems correct.

Thus, total squares: 2*(n - 1) + 1*(n - 2) + 2*(n - 1) = (2 + 1 + 2)*(n - 1) - (n - 2) = 5*(n - 1) - (n - 2) = 5n - 5 - n + 2 = 4n - 3.

Wait, hold on, let me recalculate:

Total squares = non-rotated + rotated + 1×1 rotated.

Wait, hold on, no, the 1×1 rotated squares are different from the non-rotated 1×1 squares. So, the 1×1 rotated squares also exist, so they are separate.

So, total squares = non-rotated 1×1 + rotated 1×1 + non-rotated 2×2 + rotated 2×2.

So, non-rotated 1×1: 2*(n - 1)

Rotated 1×1: (n - 2)

Non-rotated 2×2: (n - 2)

Rotated 2×2: 2*(n - 1)

Therefore, total squares: 2*(n - 1) + (n - 2) + (n - 2) + 2*(n - 1) = 2n - 2 + n - 2 + n - 2 + 2n - 2 = (2n + n + n + 2n) + (-2 - 2 - 2 - 2) = 6n - 8.

Wait, that seems more accurate.

So, 6n - 8 = 70

So, 6n = 78

n = 13.

But wait, let me double-check this.

Wait, number of non-rotated 1×1 squares: 2*(n - 1)

Number of rotated 1×1 squares: (n - 2)

Number of non-rotated 2×2 squares: (n - 2)

Number of rotated 2×2 squares: 2*(n - 1)

Thus, total squares: 2(n - 1) + (n - 2) + (n - 2) + 2(n - 1) = 2n - 2 + n - 2 + n - 2 + 2n - 2 = 6n - 8.

Set equal to 70: 6n - 8 = 70 => 6n = 78 => n = 13.

So, n = 13.

But let me think again: in a 3×13 grid, how many squares are there?

Non-rotated 1×1: 2*(13 - 1) = 24

Rotated 1×1: 11 (since 13 - 2 = 11)

Non-rotated 2×2: 11

Rotated 2×2: 2*12 = 24 (since 13 - 1 = 12, so 2*12 = 24)

Total: 24 + 11 + 11 + 24 = 70. Yes, that adds up.

So, n is 13.

But let me make sure that the problem statement is interpreted correctly. The problem says there is a total of 70 squares of three sizes. So, 70 is the total number of squares of three different sizes.

So, in a 3×13 grid, the number of squares is 70.

Therefore, the value of n is 13.

Wait, but let me see if the count is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the number of squares in a grid as a formula.

In a grid with m rows and n columns, the total number of squares is:

Sum over all possible square sizes k×k.

Each square size k×k can be placed in (m - k) rows and (n - k) columns, so the number of squares is (m - k)(n - k).

But for axis-aligned squares, yes. For rotated squares, it's more complicated, but in a 3×n grid, the rotated squares can be placed only in specific positions.

But in our case, we considered both axis-aligned and rotated squares, and found that the total number is 6n - 8.

But wait, in a 3×13 grid, the number of squares is 70, which is given.

So, n is 13.

But let me check with the Asymptote code. The Asymptote code shows a 3×n grid with some points. In the Asymptote code, the grid is drawn with 4 points on the top and bottom, and 5 points on the sides.

Wait, so in the Asymptote code, the grid is 3×n, with 4 points on the top and bottom, and 5 points on the left and right. So, n is 5 in the Asymptote code, but in the problem statement, it's a general 3×n grid.

Wait, so in the Asymptote code, it's a 3×5 grid, and the number of squares is 70? Let me check.

But in the Asymptote code, the grid is 3 rows and 5 columns. So, let's compute the number of squares in a 3×5 grid.

Non-rotated 1×1: (3 - 1)*(5 - 1) = 2*4 = 8

Rotated 1×1: (5 - 2) = 3

Non-rotated 2×2: (3 - 2)*(5 - 2) = 1*3 = 3

Rotated 2×2: 2*(5 - 1) = 2*4 = 8

Total squares: 8 + 3 + 3 + 8 = 22.

But the problem says the total number of squares is 70, so in the Asymptote code, it's 22. So, that suggests that the Asymptote code is just a representation, not the actual problem.

So, the problem is about a general 3×n grid, not a specific one.

Therefore, my calculation of n = 13 is correct.

Wait, but let me think again about the rotated squares.

In a 3×n grid, how many positions can a rotated square occupy? Each rotated square requires a 2x2 block, so in a 3×n grid, the number of 2x2 blocks is (3 - 1)*(n - 1) = 2*(n - 1). Each 2x2 block can have exactly one rotated square. Therefore, the number of rotated squares is 2*(n - 1).

So, for n = 13, the number of rotated squares is 2*12 = 24, which is correct.

Similarly, 1×1 rotated squares are in 2x2 blocks, but actually, in a 3×n grid, the number of 1x1 rotated squares is n - 2, which for n = 13 is 11.

So, 11 rotated 1x1 squares.

Similarly, non-rotated 1x1 squares: 2*(13 - 1) = 24.

Non-rotated 2x2 squares: 11.

Rotated 2x2 squares: 24.

Total squares: 24 + 11 + 11 + 24 = 70. Correct.

Therefore, the value of n is 13.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( n \) is \boxed{13}.
</think>

To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) given that there are a total of 70 squares of three different sizes in a \( 3 \times n \) grid, we need to consider both axis-aligned and rotated squares.

1. **Non-rotated Axis-Aligned Squares:**
   - **1×1 squares:** These are axis-aligned. The number of such squares is given by \((3 - 1) \times (n - 1) = 2(n - 1)\).
   - **2×2 squares:** These are also axis-aligned. The number of such squares is given by \((3 - 2) \times (n - 2) = 1 \times (n - 2) = (n - 2)\).

2. **Rotated 45-Degree Axis-Aligned Squares:**
   - These squares have a side length of \(\sqrt{2}\). The number of such squares is determined by the number of \( 2 \times 2 \) blocks in the grid, which is \((3 - 1) \times (n - 1) = 2(n - 1)\).

3. **Total Number of Squares:**
   - Summing up all the squares of different sizes, we get:
     - Non-rotated 1×1 squares: \(2(n - 1)\)
     - Rotated 1×1 squares: \(n - 2\)
     - Non-rotated 2×2 squares: \(n - 2\)
     - Rotated 2×2 squares: \(2(n - 1)\)

   Therefore, the total number of squares is:
   \[
   2(n - 1) + (n - 2) + (n - 2) + 2(n - 1) = 6n - 8
   \]

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Given that the total number of squares is 70, we set up the equation:
     \[
     6n - 8 = 70
     \]
   - Solving for \( n \):
     \[
     6n = 78 \\
     n = 13
     \]

Thus, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{13}\).
