Question:
For what values of $x$ is it true that $x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10$? Express your answer in interval notation.

Correct Answer:
Re-arranging, $x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0$. The left-hand quadratic factors as $x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0$. Thus, $x-7$ and $x+2$ have opposite signs, so $-2 \le x \le 7$ and $\boxed{x \in [-2,7]}$.

Gold:
x\in[-2,7]

Wrong Prediction:
[-2,7]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I've got this inequality to solve: \(x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10\). Hmm, I think I should start by moving all terms to one side to make it easier to handle. Let me subtract 10 from both sides. That gives me:

\(x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \le 0\)

Simplifying that, I get:

\(x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0\)

Alright, now I have a quadratic inequality: \(x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0\). I remember that to solve quadratic inequalities, I need to find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation and then test the intervals between those roots.

So, let me set the quadratic equal to zero:

\(x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\)

Hmm, how do I solve this? I can try factoring, but I'm not sure if this factors nicely. Let me check the discriminant to see if it's a perfect square.

The discriminant \(D\) is \(b^2 - 4ac\), which in this case is \((-5)^2 - 4(1)(-14)\). Calculating that:

\(25 - (-56)\) wait, no, that's not right. Wait, \(4ac\) is \(4*1*(-14)\), which is \(-56\). So, the discriminant is \(25 - (-56)\) which is \(25 + 56 = 81\). Oh, 81 is a perfect square, so it factors nicely.

So, the roots will be:

\(x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2*1} = \frac{5 \pm 9}{2}\)

Calculating both possibilities:

First root: \(\frac{5 + 9}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7\)

Second root: \(\frac{5 - 9}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2\)

So, the roots are \(x = -2\) and \(x = 7\).

Now, since the quadratic is \(x^2 - 5x - 14\), and the coefficient of \(x^2\) is positive, the parabola opens upwards. That means the quadratic will be less than or equal to zero between its two roots.

So, the solution to the inequality \(x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0\) is the interval where \(x\) is between \(-2\) and \(7\), inclusive.

Therefore, in interval notation, that would be \([-2, 7]\).

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started by moving 10 to the left, correct. Then I solved the quadratic equation, found the roots, and since the coefficient of \(x^2\) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, so the quadratic is negative between the roots. That makes sense.

Just to be thorough, maybe I can test a point in each interval to confirm. The intervals are:

1. \(x < -2\)
2. \(-2 < x < 7\)
3. \(x > 7\)

Let me pick a test point in each interval.

For \(x < -2\), let's say \(x = -3\):

Plugging into the original inequality: \((-3)^2 - 5*(-3) - 4 \le 10\)

Calculates to: \(9 + 15 - 4 = 20\). Is 20 ≤ 10? No, so the inequality is false here.

For \(-2 < x < 7\), let's pick \(x = 0\):

Plugging in: \(0 - 0 - 4 = -4\). Is -4 ≤ 10? Yes, so the inequality holds here.

For \(x > 7\), let's pick \(x = 8\):

Plugging in: \(64 - 40 - 4 = 20\). Is 20 ≤ 10? No, so the inequality is false here.

So, only in the interval \(-2\) to \(7\) does the inequality hold true. That confirms my earlier result.

Therefore, the solution is \([-2, 7]\).

**Final Answer**
The values of \(x\) that satisfy the inequality are \boxed{[-2, 7]}.
</think>

To solve the inequality \(x^2 - 5x - 4 \le 10\), we start by moving all terms to one side:

\[x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \le 0\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0\]

Next, we solve the corresponding quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) with \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = -14\), we find the roots:

\[
x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm 9}{2}
\]

This gives us the roots:

\[
x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2
\]

The quadratic \(x^2 - 5x - 14\) opens upwards (since the coefficient of \(x^2\) is positive), so it is less than or equal to zero between its roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the interval:

\[
[-2, 7]
\]

Testing intervals confirms that only between \(-2\) and \(7\) the inequality holds true.

Thus, the values of \(x\) that satisfy the inequality are \(\boxed{[-2, 7]}\).
