Question:
Point $A$ lies somewhere within or on the square which has opposite corners at $(0,0)$ and $(2,2)$. Point $B$ lies somewhere within or on the square which has opposite corners at points $(4,2)$ and $(5,3)$. What is the greatest possible value of the slope of the line containing points $A$ and $B$? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Correct Answer:
Since point $A$ is constrained to a rectangular region with sides parallel to the axes, its $x$ and $y$ coordinates can be chosen independently of one another.  The same is true of point $B$.  Therefore, the horizontal separation between $A$ and $B$ should be minimized and the vertical separation maximized.  The greatest possible $y$-coordinate for $B$ is 3 and the least possible $y$-coordinate for $A$ is 0.  The greatest possible $x$-coordinate for $A$ is 2 and the least possible $x$-coordinate for $B$ is 4. Therefore, the slope between $A$ and $B$ is maximized when $A$ has coordinates (2,0) and $B$ has coordinates (4,3).  The maximum slope is $\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to find the greatest possible value of the slope between points A and B, where A is somewhere in a square with opposite corners at (0,0) and (2,2), and B is somewhere in a square with opposite corners at (4,2) and (5,3). Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should visualize the squares. The first square, with corners at (0,0) and (2,2), must be a square with side length 2 units, right? So, it extends from (0,0) to (2,2). Similarly, the second square has corners at (4,2) and (5,3), so that's also a square of side length 1 unit, extending from (4,2) to (5,3).

Now, point A is anywhere within or on the first square and point B is anywhere within or on the second square. The slope of the line AB is given by (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). To maximize this slope, I need to find points A and B such that the change in y is as large as possible relative to the change in x.

But since A and B are in different squares, the x and y coordinates of A and B can vary independently. So, to maximize the slope, I should probably look for points where the y-coordinate of B is as large as possible and the y-coordinate of A is as small as possible, while their x-coordinates are as small as possible, and similarly for the reverse, but actually no, since slope is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). So, to make the numerator as large as possible and the denominator as small as possible, or vice versa?

Wait, no, slope is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). So, to maximize the slope, we can consider two cases:

1. When both the numerator and denominator are positive, making the slope positive.
2. When the numerator is negative and the denominator is negative, making the slope positive.

But to get the maximum slope, we need the numerator to be as large as possible relative to the denominator. So, ideally, we want the maximum possible y difference over the minimum possible x difference, or the maximum x difference over the minimum y difference. Wait, which one would give a larger slope?

Well, if the maximum y difference is much larger than the minimum x difference, then the slope would be very steep. Similarly, if the maximum x difference is much larger than the minimum y difference, but that might not be as steep.

But let's think about the two squares.

First square: (0,0) to (2,2). So, the maximum y value is 2, and the minimum y is 0. Similarly, the maximum x is 2, and the minimum x is 0.

Second square: (4,2) to (5,3). The maximum y is 3, and the minimum y is 2. The maximum x is 5, and the minimum x is 4.

So, the maximum possible y difference between A and B is 3 - 0 = 3, because A can be at (0,0) and B at (4,3). Alternatively, the maximum x difference is 5 - 0 = 5, since A can be at (0,0) and B at (5,3). Similarly, to get the maximum slope, we need to maximize the numerator and minimize the denominator.

So, numerator: 3 - 0 = 3; denominator: 5 - 0 = 5. So, slope would be 3/5.

Alternatively, if we consider the reverse, numerator as (0 - 3) = -3 and denominator as (5 - 0) = 5, so slope is -3/5, but since we are looking for the greatest possible value, which is positive, 3/5 is better.

Wait, but is 3/5 the maximum possible? Let me think.

Wait, actually, let's consider all possible points. Maybe if A is at (0,2) and B is at (4,3), then the slope is (3 - 2)/(4 - 0) = 1/4.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), the slope is (3 - 0)/(5 - 0) = 3/5, which is higher.

Similarly, if A is at (2,2) and B is at (4,3), the slope is (3 - 2)/(4 - 2) = 1/2.

Wait, so 3/5 is higher than 1/2, which is 0.6 vs 0.5.

But is 3/5 the maximum?

Wait, but perhaps if we can get a point A with a lower y-coordinate and a point B with a higher y-coordinate, but with a smaller x difference.

Wait, but A is in the first square, so the lowest y-coordinate is 0, and the highest is 2. Similarly, B is in the second square, with lowest y-coordinate 2 and highest y-coordinate 3.

So, the maximum difference in y is 3 - 0 = 3, as I thought earlier.

The minimum difference in x is 5 - 0 = 5, because A can be at (0,0) and B at (5,3), but wait, no, actually, x-coordinate of A can be as low as 0, and x-coordinate of B can be as high as 5, so 5 - 0 is 5.

Alternatively, if A is at (2,2) and B is at (4,3), the x difference is 2, so 3/2 is 1.5, which is 3/2, which is larger than 3/5.

Wait, no, wait: (3)/(5 - 0) = 3/5, which is 0.6.

But (3 - 2)/(4 - 2) = 1/2 = 0.5.

Wait, so 3/5 is higher. So, 3/5 is better.

Wait, but actually, if A is at (2,2) and B is at (4,3), that's a change in y of 1 over change in x of 2, which is 1/2.

Hmm, so 3/5 is higher.

But, is there a way to get a higher slope?

Wait, let's think about the slope formula:

Slope = (yB - yA)/(xB - xA)

To maximize this, we need to maximize (yB - yA) and minimize (xB - xA). Or if (yB - yA) is negative and (xB - xA) is negative, the slope becomes positive.

So, to get the maximum positive slope, we need to have the largest possible (yB - yA) and the smallest possible (xB - xA). So, (yB - yA) is maximum when yB is maximum and yA is minimum. Similarly, (xB - xA) is minimum when xB is maximum and xA is minimum.

In the first square, yA can be as low as 0 and as high as 2. In the second square, yB can be as low as 2 and as high as 3.

So, to maximize yB - yA, set yB = 3 and yA = 0, giving a difference of 3.

To minimize xB - xA, set xB = 5 and xA = 0, giving a difference of 5.

Therefore, the slope would be 3/5, which is 0.6.

But wait, hold on, is that possible? Because if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), then the slope is (3 - 0)/(5 - 0) = 3/5.

But, is that the only way? Or can we get a higher slope?

Wait, let's see. If A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), slope is 3/5.

If A is at (0,0) and B is at (4,3), the slope is 3/4, which is less than 3/5.

If A is at (0,0) and B is at (4,2), the slope is (2 - 0)/(4 - 0) = 0.5, which is less than 3/5.

If A is at (0,2) and B is at (4,3), the slope is (3 - 2)/(4 - 0) = 1/4.

If A is at (2,2) and B is at (4,3), the slope is (3 - 2)/(4 - 2) = 1/2.

So, 3/5 is the highest so far.

Wait, but what if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), which is 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (2,2) and B is at (5,3), the slope is (3 - 2)/(5 - 2) = 1/3, which is less than 3/5.

Similarly, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (4,2), the slope is (2 - 0)/(4 - 0) = 0.5, which is still less than 3/5.

Wait, so 3/5 is the maximum.

But let me think again. Maybe if A is somewhere else in the square, but not at (0,0), and B is somewhere else in the square, not at (5,3), can we get a higher slope?

Wait, for example, suppose A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), slope is 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's the maximum y for B and minimum x for B.

Wait, but is 3/5 the maximum possible slope?

Wait, another idea: Maybe if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), which is 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), which is the same point.

Wait, but if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's the points in their respective squares. So, that seems to be the highest.

But wait, is that the maximum possible?

Wait, let me think about the direction of the line.

If we have a line from (0,0) to (5,3), that's going up 3 units and right 5 units, so the slope is 3/5.

Alternatively, if we have a line from (0,0) to (4,2), that's slope 1/2, which is less.

Wait, but what if we have a line from (0,2) to (5,3), that's slope (3 - 2)/(5 - 0) = 1/5, which is even less.

Wait, no, that's 1/5. So, 3/5 is higher.

Wait, another idea: Maybe if A is at (0,2) and B is at (5,3), the slope is (3 - 2)/(5 - 0) = 1/5, which is less than 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's 3/5. So, 3/5 is higher.

Wait, so is 3/5 the maximum slope? Hmm.

Wait, but hold on a second. The squares are in different positions.

Wait, the first square is from (0,0) to (2,2), and the second square is from (4,2) to (5,3). So, the x-coordinates of the first square are from 0 to 2, and the second from 4 to 5. So, the x difference between the two squares is 4.

Wait, so, if we can get a point A in the first square with x=0, y=0 and point B in the second square with x=5, y=3, so that's a difference of 5 in x and 3 in y, so 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (2,2) and B is at (4,3), the difference is 2 in x and 1 in y, so slope 1/2, which is less.

Wait, but is there a way to have a higher slope?

Wait, suppose A is at (0,0) and B is at (5, something). Wait, but B is in the second square, so the maximum y in the second square is 3. So, the highest B can be is (5,3), so that's 3.

Similarly, A can be as low as (0,0). So, 3/5 is the maximum.

Wait, another thought: Maybe if A is not at (0,0), but in another corner.

Wait, for example, if A is at (2,2) in the first square, and B is at (4,3) in the second square, the slope is (3 - 2)/(4 - 2) = 1/2.

That's less than 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,2) in the first square, and B is at (5,3) in the second square, the slope is (3 - 2)/(5 - 0) = 1/5.

That's less than 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's 3/5.

Alternatively, maybe if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,2). But wait, B is in the second square, so in the second square, the y-coordinate can be as low as 2 and as high as 3. So, if B is at (5,2), that's in the second square, so that's allowed. So, slope is (2 - 0)/(5 - 0) = 2/5, which is less than 3/5.

Wait, so 3/5 is higher.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), the slope is 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's one point. But is there another point where the slope is higher?

Wait, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's 3/5.

If A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), yes.

Wait, but is this the maximum?

Wait, another case: What if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's the same as before.

Wait, maybe if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's the maximum.

Wait, but hold on, the squares are in different positions, so maybe A can be at (0,0) and B at (5,3), but if A is at (2,2) and B at (5,3), what's the slope? (3 - 2)/(5 - 2) = 1/3, which is less than 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), it's 3/5.

Wait, but another thought: If A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's 3/5.

But what if A is at (0,2) in the first square, and B is at (5,3) in the second square, then the slope is (3 - 2)/(5 - 0) = 1/5.

Which is less than 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's 3/5.

Wait, so it seems that 3/5 is the maximum.

Wait, but let me confirm.

Suppose A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3). That's 5 units in x, 3 units in y, so slope 3/5.

Alternatively, is there a way to get a higher slope?

Wait, for example, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's 3/5.

If A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's the maximum.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's the highest possible.

Wait, unless B can be at some other point with a higher y while A is at a lower point.

Wait, but in the first square, the maximum y is 2, and in the second square, the minimum y is 2.

So, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), yB is 3, which is the maximum in the second square, and yA is 0, which is the minimum in the first square.

Similarly, xB is 5, which is the maximum in the second square, and xA is 0, which is the minimum in the first square.

Therefore, the slope is 3/5, which is the maximum.

Wait, but let's think about if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), is that the point where the slope is maximum?

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), yeah, that's the only way to get the maximum y difference over the minimum x difference.

Wait, another thought: If A is at (0,0), that's the lowest y and x in the first square, and B is at (5,3), the highest y and x in the second square.

So, that should give the maximum slope.

Therefore, the maximum slope is 3/5.

But wait a second, I just remembered that the slope is (yB - yA)/(xB - xA). So, if I have A at (0,0) and B at (5,3), that's (3 - 0)/(5 - 0) = 3/5.

But wait, what if A is at (2,2) and B is at (5,3)? Then, the slope is (3 - 2)/(5 - 2) = 1/3, which is less than 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's the maximum.

Wait, but is there a way to get a higher slope?

Wait, let me think about other points.

Suppose A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), slope is 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's the maximum.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's 3/5.

Wait, so 3/5 is the maximum.

Wait, so is that the answer? 3/5.

But let me just make sure.

Wait, another idea: If A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,2) and B is at (5,3), the slope is (3 - 2)/(5 - 0) = 1/5, which is less.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's the maximum.

Alternatively, if A is at (2,2) and B is at (5,3), slope is 1/3, which is less.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's 3/5.

Wait, so in all cases, 3/5 is the maximum.

Wait, but hold on, what if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3). So, that's one point, but is there another point where the slope is higher? For example, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's 3/5.

Alternatively, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's the maximum.

Wait, another thought: If A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), the slope is 3/5.

But another point, if A is at (0,0) and B is at (5,3), that's the same as before.

Wait, so, is 3/5 the maximum?

Wait, but in another way, when you have two points, A and B, in their respective squares, the slope is determined by their coordinates. So, to maximize the slope, you need to maximize the numerator and minimize the denominator.

So, numerator: yB - yA. To maximize this, you need yB as large as possible and yA as small as possible. In the first square, yA can be as low as 0, and in the second square, yB can be as high as 3. So, the maximum difference is 3 - 0 = 3.

Denominator: xB - xA. To minimize this, you need xB as large as possible and xA as small as possible. In the first square, xA can be as small as 0, and in the second square, xB can be as large as 5. So, the minimum difference is 5 - 0 = 5.

Thus, maximum slope is 3/5.

Therefore, 3/5 is the greatest possible value of the slope.

But wait, hold on, let me just double-check.

Suppose I take A at (0,0) and B at (5,3), slope is (3 - 0)/(5 - 0) = 3/5.

Alternatively, take A at (0,2) and B at (5,3), slope is (3 - 2)/(5 - 0) = 1/5.

Alternatively, take A at (2,2) and B at (5,3), slope is (3 - 2)/(5 - 2) = 1/3.

Alternatively, take A at (0,0) and B at (5,3), slope is 3/5.

Wait, so 3/5 is the maximum.

Therefore, the greatest possible value of the slope is 3/5.

So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The greatest possible value of the slope is \boxed{\dfrac{3}{5}}.
</think>

To find the greatest possible value of the slope of the line containing points \(A\) and \(B\), where \(A\) lies within or on the square with opposite corners at \((0,0)\) and \((2,2)\), and \(B\) lies within or on the square with opposite corners at \((4,2)\) and \((5,3)\), we need to consider the coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\).

1. The first square has corners at \((0,0)\) and \((2,2)\), so the coordinates of \(A\) can vary between \(0\) and \(2\) for both \(x\) and \(y\).
2. The second square has corners at \((4,2)\) and \((5,3)\), so the coordinates of \(B\) can vary between \(4\) and \(5\) for \(x\) and between \(2\) and \(3\) for \(y\).

To maximize the slope \(\frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A}\), we need to maximize the numerator \((y_B - y_A)\) and minimize the denominator \((x_B - x_A)\).

- The maximum value of \(y_B - y_A\) is achieved when \(y_B\) is as large as possible and \(y_A\) is as small as possible. In the second square, \(y_B\) can be as large as \(3\) and \(y_A\) can be as small as \(0\). Thus, the maximum difference is \(3 - 0 = 3\).
- The minimum value of \(x_B - x_A\) is achieved when \(x_B\) is as large as possible and \(x_A\) is as small as possible. In the first square, \(x_B\) can be as large as \(5\) and \(x_A\) can be as small as \(0\). Thus, the minimum difference is \(5 - 0 = 5\).

Therefore, the greatest possible value of the slope is \(\frac{3}{5}\).

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{3}{5}}
\]
