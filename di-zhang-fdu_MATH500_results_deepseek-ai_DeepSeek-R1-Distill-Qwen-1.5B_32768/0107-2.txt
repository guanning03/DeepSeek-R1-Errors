Question:
Let $\lambda$ be a constant, $0 \le \lambda \le 4,$ and let $f : [0,1] \to [0,1]$ be defined by
\[f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x).\]Find the values of $\lambda,$ $0 \le \lambda \le 4,$ for which there exists an $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$ but $f(f(x)) = x.$

Correct Answer:
We have that
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda \cdot \lambda x(1 - x) (1 - \lambda x(1 - x)),\]so we want to solve $\lambda \cdot \lambda x(1 - x) (1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.$

Note that if $f(x) = x,$ then $f(f(x)) = f(x) = x,$ so any roots of $\lambda x(1 - x) = x$ will also be roots of $\lambda \cdot \lambda x(1 - x) (1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.$  Thus, we should expect $\lambda x(1 - x) - x$ to be a factor of $\lambda \cdot \lambda x(1 - x) (1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) - x.$  Indeed,
\[\lambda \cdot \lambda x(1 - x) (1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) - x = (\lambda x(1 - x) - x)(\lambda^2 x^2 - (\lambda^2 + \lambda) x + \lambda + 1).\]The discriminant of $\lambda^2 x^2 - (\lambda^2 + \lambda) x + \lambda + 1$ is
\[(\lambda^2 + \lambda)^2 - 4 \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1) = \lambda^4 - 2 \lambda^3 - 3 \lambda^2 = \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)(\lambda - 3).\]This is nonnegative when $\lambda = 0$ or $3 \le \lambda \le 4.$

If $\lambda = 0,$ then $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \in [0,1].$

If $\lambda = 3,$ then the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ becomes
\[(3x(1 - x) - x)(9x^2 - 12x + 4) = 0.\]The roots of $9x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0$ are both $\frac{2}{3},$ which satisfy $f(x) = x.$

On the other hand, for $\lambda > 3,$ the roots of $\lambda x(1 - x) = x$ are $x = 0$ and $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.$  Clearly $x = 0$ is not a root of $\lambda^2 x^2 - (\lambda^2 + \lambda) x + \lambda + 1 = 0.$  Also, if $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda},$ then
\[\lambda^2 x^2 - (\lambda^2 + \lambda) x + \lambda + 1 = \lambda^2 \left( \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \right)^2 - (\lambda^2 + \lambda) \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda + 1 = 3 - \lambda \neq 0.\]Furthermore, the product of the roots is $\frac{\lambda + 1}{\lambda^2},$ which is positive, so either both roots are positive or both roots are negative.  Since the sum of the roots is $\frac{\lambda^2 + \lambda}{\lambda^2} > 0,$ both roots are positive.  Also,
\[\frac{\lambda^2 + \lambda}{\lambda} = 1 + \frac{1}{\lambda} < \frac{4}{3},\]so at least one root must be less than 1.

Therefore, the set of $\lambda$ that satisfy the given condition is $\lambda \in \boxed{(3,4]}.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the values of λ between 0 and 4 such that there exists an x in [0,1] where f(x) is not equal to x, but when I apply the function f again to f(x), I get back x. The function f is defined as f(x) = λx(1 - x). Hmm, okay. Let me try to understand this step by step.

First, I know that f(x) = λx(1 - x) is a quadratic function. Depending on the value of λ, this function can have different shapes. For λ = 0, it's just the zero function, which maps everything to 0. For λ = 4, it's a downward opening parabola because the coefficient is positive, and the vertex will be at x = 0.5 with the maximum value of 1. So, at λ = 4, the function f(x) maps [0,1] onto itself, and every x has a unique image f(x). But for other values of λ between 0 and 4, the function will have a maximum somewhere inside (0,1), so it's not injective, meaning there are multiple x's that map to the same f(x). 

The question is asking for values of λ where there exists an x such that f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. So, x is not a fixed point of f, but when you apply f twice, it brings you back to x. That means x is part of a 2-cycle of the function f. Fixed points are points where f(x) = x, but a 2-cycle is a pair of points where f(x) = y and f(y) = x, but x ≠ y. So, in this case, we are looking for 2-cycles in the function f, which do not have to be fixed points. 

So, my goal is to find all λ in [0,4] such that the equation f(f(x)) = x has at least one solution x ≠ fixed points. That is, the function f has a pair of distinct points x and y = f(x) such that f(y) = x. So, x and y are distinct, not fixed, but they form a cycle of length 2.

Let me write down f(f(x)) = x explicitly. Since f(x) = λx(1 - x), then f(f(x)) would be f(λx(1 - x)).

So, f(f(x)) = λ*(f(x))*(1 - f(x)) = λ*(λx(1 - x))*(1 - λx(1 - x)).

Simplify that:

f(f(x)) = λ²x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)).

Set this equal to x:

λ²x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = x.

Assuming x ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by x:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = 1.

So, now we have:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = 1.

This equation may be a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find a substitution or factor it in a way that's easier to solve.

Let me denote y = λx(1 - x). Then, the equation becomes:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - y) = 1.

But y = λx(1 - x), so 1 - y = 1 - λx(1 - x).

Wait, but that doesn't seem to directly help. Maybe another substitution? Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as a quadratic equation in terms of x or y.

Alternatively, let me expand the left-hand side:

First, let's expand (1 - λx(1 - x)):

1 - λx + λx².

So, the equation is:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) = 1.

Let me compute (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²):

Multiply term by term:

1*(1 - λx + λx²) - x*(1 - λx + λx²)

= (1 - λx + λx²) - (x - λx² + λx³)

= 1 - λx + λx² - x + λx² - λx³

Combine like terms:

Constant term: 1

x terms: -λx - x = -x(λ + 1)

x² terms: λx² + λx² = 2λx²

x³ term: -λx³

So, overall:

1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

λ²*(1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³) = 1.

So, expanding this:

λ² - λ²(λ + 1)x + 2λ³x² - λ⁴x³ = 1.

Bring all terms to one side:

λ² - λ²(λ + 1)x + 2λ³x² - λ⁴x³ - 1 = 0.

Let me write this as:

-λ⁴x³ + 2λ³x² - λ²(λ + 1)x + (λ² - 1) = 0.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

λ⁴x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x + (1 - λ²) = 0.

So, the equation is:

λ⁴x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x + (1 - λ²) = 0.

This is a cubic equation in x. Hmm, solving cubic equations can be tricky, but perhaps we can factor it or find rational roots.

Let me try to factor this equation. Maybe it can be factored by grouping or by some substitution.

Looking at the coefficients:

- Coefficient of x³: λ⁴
- Coefficient of x²: -2λ³
- Coefficient of x: λ²(λ + 1)
- Constant term: 1 - λ²

Let me see if I can factor out something. Let me try to factor by grouping.

Group the first two terms and the last two terms:

(λ⁴x³ - 2λ³x²) + (λ²(λ + 1)x + (1 - λ²)) = 0.

Factor λ³ from the first group:

λ³(λx³ - 2x²) + (λ²(λ + 1)x + 1 - λ²) = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe factor out a λ from the second group:

Wait, the second group is λ²(λ + 1)x + (1 - λ²). Let me factor (λ + 1) from the first term and see:

Wait, (λ + 1)x is inside the first part, but the second part is 1 - λ². Alternatively, maybe factor (1 - λ²) as (1 - λ)(1 + λ):

Wait, let me write the equation as:

λ⁴x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x + (1 - λ²) = 0.

Let me try to factor this. Maybe try x = 1 as a root? Let me plug x = 1:

λ⁴(1) - 2λ³(1) + λ²(λ + 1)(1) + (1 - λ²).

Simplify:

λ⁴ - 2λ³ + λ³ + λ² + 1 - λ².

Simplify term by term:

λ⁴ - 2λ³ + λ³ + λ² - λ² + 1 = λ⁴ - λ³ + 0 + 1.

So, it's λ⁴ - λ³ + 1. This is not zero unless λ⁴ - λ³ + 1 = 0, which isn't true for real λ ≥0.

Wait, so x=1 isn't a root. Hmm, maybe x= something else.

Alternatively, maybe x=0 is a root, but plugging x=0:

0 - 0 + 0 + (1 - 0) = 1 ≠ 0. So, x=0 isn't a root either.

Alternatively, maybe x=1/2 is a root? Let me test x = 1/2:

Compute each term:

λ⁴*(1/2)^3 - 2λ³*(1/2)^2 + λ²(λ + 1)*(1/2) + (1 - λ²).

Simplify:

λ⁴*(1/8) - 2λ³*(1/4) + λ²(λ + 1)*(1/2) + (1 - λ²).

Which is:

(λ⁴)/8 - (λ³)/2 + (λ³ + λ²)/2 + 1 - λ².

Combine like terms:

(λ⁴)/8 - (λ³)/2 + (λ³)/2 + (λ²)/2 + 1 - λ².

Simplify:

(λ⁴)/8 + 0 + (-λ²)/2 + 1.

So, equation becomes:

(λ⁴)/8 - (λ²)/2 + 1 = 0.

Multiply by 8:

λ⁴ - 4λ² + 8 = 0.

This equation has discriminant D = 16 - 32 = -16 < 0, so no real roots. Therefore, x=1/2 is not a root either.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe instead of trying to factor, I can use the fact that for each λ, we can consider the equation f(f(x)) = x and find x such that f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a relationship between x and f(x). Since f(f(x)) = x, this suggests that applying f twice brings you back to x. So, x is part of a 2-cycle. So, for such x, f(x) must satisfy f(f(x)) = x, but f(x) ≠ x.

So, perhaps we can set f(x) = y, then f(y) = x, and we have y ≠ x. So, the system is:

y = λx(1 - x),

x = λy(1 - y).

So, substituting the first equation into the second, we have:

x = λ(λx(1 - x))(1 - λx(1 - x)).

Which simplifies to:

x = λ²x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)).

Which is the same equation as before. So, perhaps we can solve for x in terms of λ.

Wait, but this is the same cubic equation I had before. So, that might not help much.

Alternatively, maybe we can solve for y in terms of x and substitute back.

Wait, maybe another approach: Let's suppose that f(f(x)) = x, so f(f(x)) - x = 0.

We can write f(f(x)) - x = 0 as:

λ²x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - x = 0.

Factor out x:

x [λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1] = 0.

So, either x = 0, which is a fixed point, or:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0.

So, the non-trivial solutions are when:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = 1.

Which is the same equation as before. So, I think that approach is not helpful yet.

Perhaps, to make progress, I need to find for what λ, there exists x ≠ fixed point such that f(f(x)) = x. So, for each λ, the equation f(f(x)) = x can be written as a cubic equation, and we want to know for which λ this equation has solutions other than fixed points.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that if f(f(x)) = x, then f^{-1}(x) = f(x). So, meaning that f is its own inverse up to the sign? Wait, no, f^{-1}(x) is not necessarily f(x). Wait, actually, f(f(x)) = x implies that f is an involution, but only on the 2-cycle. So, f is not necessarily an involution on the entire interval, but on this specific 2-cycle, f is an involution.

So, perhaps for some λ, the function f has a 2-cycle, and for others, it doesn't.

So, maybe we can think about the function f as a quadratic function on [0,1], and look for points that are swapped by f.

Alternatively, maybe we can think about the fixed points. For f(x) = x, we have x = λx(1 - x). So, x(1 - λx + λx²) = 0.

So, the fixed points are x = 0 or x(1 - λx + λx²) = 0.

So, the non-zero fixed points are solutions to 1 - λx + λx² = 0.

That is, λx² - λx + 1 = 0.

Wait, discriminant D = λ² - 4λ*1 = λ² - 4λ.

So, real fixed points exist only when D ≥ 0, so λ² - 4λ ≥ 0 ⇒ λ(λ - 4) ≥ 0.

Since λ ∈ [0,4], this inequality holds when λ ≤ 0 or λ ≥ 4. But since λ is between 0 and 4, only λ = 0 or λ = 4 have real fixed points.

Wait, but for λ=0, f(x) = 0, so all points are fixed. For λ=4, as I mentioned before, f maps [0,1] onto itself, but not necessarily bijective, but the fixed points are x=0 and x=1, because f(1) = 4*1*(1 - 1) = 0, but wait, f(1) = 0, which is a fixed point only if 0 maps to itself, but 0 maps to 0. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, when λ=4, f(x) = 4x(1 - x). The fixed points are solutions to x = 4x(1 - x). So, 4x - 4x² = x ⇒ 4x² - 3x = 0 ⇒ x(4x - 3) = 0 ⇒ x=0 or x=3/4.

Wait, x=0 is a fixed point, and x=3/4 is another fixed point? Hmm, let's check f(3/4) = 4*(3/4)*(1 - 3/4) = 4*(3/4)*(1/4) = 4*(3/16) = 3/4. So, x=3/4 is a fixed point. Hmm, so for λ=4, there are two fixed points: 0 and 3/4.

But earlier, I thought for λ=4, the function maps [0,1] onto itself, but actually, f(3/4) = 3/4, so 3/4 is a fixed point, and f(0)=0, f(1)=4*1*(1 - 1)=0, which is another fixed point. So, in fact, for λ=4, we have two fixed points at 0 and 3/4, and also x=1 is a fixed point because f(1)=0, but 0 is already a fixed point. Wait, no, f(1)=0, but x=1 is not a fixed point unless f(1)=1.

Wait, for λ=4, f(1)=4*1*(1 - 1)=0, which is not 1, so x=1 is not a fixed point. So, for λ=4, the fixed points are x=0 and x=3/4. So, the other point is x=1, but it's not a fixed point.

So, to recap: For λ=0, every x is a fixed point. For 0 < λ < 4, the function f has two fixed points: x=0 and another point, which is 3/4 when λ=4. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, for λ=4, the fixed points are x=0 and x=3/4, as I saw.

Wait, for any λ, the fixed points are x=0 and x=(λ ± sqrt(λ² - 4λ))/2λ. Wait, the quadratic equation was λx² - λx + 1 = 0. Wait, no, earlier I had fixed points from x=0 or from 1 - λx + λx²=0, which is λx² - λx + 1=0. Wait, that would be discriminant D = λ² - 4λ, so x=(λ ± sqrt(λ² - 4λ))/(2λ).

Wait, but for λ≠0, x=(λ ± sqrt(λ² - 4λ))/(2λ). Let me compute this for λ=4:

x=(4 ± sqrt(16 - 16))/8 = 4/8 = 1/2. Wait, that's not correct because earlier, I saw that for λ=4, fixed points are 0 and 3/4. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation.

Wait, from f(x)=x, we have x=λx(1 - x). So, x=λx - λx². Bring everything to one side: λx² - (λ + 1)x = 0. Factor: x(λx - (λ + 1)) = 0. So, fixed points are x=0 and x=(λ + 1)/λ.

Ah, okay, so that's a different result than before. So, earlier, I thought the fixed points were from 1 - λx + λx²=0, but that was incorrect because moving x to the left side, it's λx² - (λ + 1)x = 0. So, the fixed points are x=0 and x=(λ + 1)/λ.

Wait, for λ=4, x=(4 + 1)/4 = 5/4, which is outside [0,1]. But earlier, when λ=4, we saw that x=3/4 is a fixed point, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let me check the fixed points again. When f(x) = x, so λx(1 - x) = x.

So, λx - λx² = x.

Bring all terms to one side: λx - λx² - x = 0.

Factor x: x(λ - λx - 1) = 0.

So, x=0, or λ - λx - 1 = 0.

So, λ - λx - 1 = 0 ⇒ λ(1 - x) = 1 ⇒ 1 - x = 1/λ ⇒ x = 1 - 1/λ.

Ah! So, for x to be in [0,1], 1 - 1/λ must be in [0,1]. So, 0 ≤ 1 - 1/λ ≤ 1.

Which implies:

1 - 1/λ ≥ 0 ⇒ 1 ≥ 1/λ ⇒ λ ≥ 1.

And,

1 - 1/λ ≤ 1 ⇒ -1/λ ≤ 0, which is always true for λ > 0.

So, for λ ≥ 1, x = 1 - 1/λ is a fixed point in [0,1]. For λ < 1, x = 1 - 1/λ would be negative, which is outside the interval, so only x=0 is a fixed point. For λ=1, x=1 - 1/1=0, so x=0 is the only fixed point.

Wait, so the fixed points are:

- x=0 for any λ.

- x=1 - 1/λ for λ ≥ 1.

- No fixed points for λ < 1.

So, for λ ≥1, there's another fixed point at x=1 - 1/λ.

So, for λ=4, x=1 - 1/4= 3/4, which is the fixed point we saw earlier.

For λ=1, x=1 - 1=0, so the fixed points are only x=0.

So, going back, for λ in [0,1), the only fixed point is x=0. For λ=1, x=0 is a fixed point, and x=1 - 1/λ=0, so same point. For λ>1, there is another fixed point at x=1 - 1/λ.

So, back to our problem: We need to find λ in [0,4] such that there exists x≠fixed point where f(f(x))=x.

So, for λ=0: f(x)=0, so every x is fixed. So, no x≠fixed point exists. So, λ=0 is out.

For λ=1: x=0 is the only fixed point, and f(f(x))=x for all x, so again, no x≠fixed point exists.

For λ=4: f(x)=4x(1 -x). Fixed points at x=0 and x=3/4.

So, is there an x≠0 or 3/4 such that f(f(x))=x?

Yes, because f(f(1/2))=f(4*(1/2)*(1 - 1/2))=f(4*(1/2)*(1/2))=f(1)=4*1*(1 -1)=0≠1/2.

Wait, so x=1/2 is not a fixed point, but f(f(1/2))=0≠1/2.

But wait, does f(f(x))=x have another solution besides fixed points? For λ=4, let's see:

Equation f(f(x))=x:

f(x)=4x(1 -x).

f(f(x))=4*(4x(1 -x))*(1 -4x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

4*(4x(1 -x))*(1 -4x(1 -x)) = x.

Divide both sides by x (assuming x≠0):

16(1 -x)(1 -4x +4x²)=1.

Wait, compute (1 -4x +4x²):

(1 -4x +4x²) is (1 - 2x)^2.

So, equation becomes:

16(1 -x)(1 - 2x)^2 =1.

Let me compute this:

16(1 -x)(1 - 4x +4x²) =1.

Expand (1 -x)(1 -4x +4x²):

Multiply term by term:

1*(1 -4x +4x²) - x*(1 -4x +4x²)

= (1 -4x +4x²) - (x -4x² +4x³)

= 1 -4x +4x² -x +4x² -4x³

Combine like terms:

1 -5x +8x² -4x³.

So, equation is:

16(1 -5x +8x² -4x³) =1.

Multiply through:

16 -80x +128x² -64x³ =1.

Bring 1 to left side:

16 -80x +128x² -64x³ -1 =0 ⇒ 15 -80x +128x² -64x³ =0.

Rewriting:

-64x³ +128x² -80x +15 =0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

64x³ -128x² +80x -15=0.

So, this is a cubic equation: 64x³ -128x² +80x -15=0.

Hmm, not sure if I can factor this. Maybe try rational roots. Possible rational roots are factors of 15 over factors of 64, so ±1, ±3, ±5, ±15, ±1/2, etc.

Let me test x=1:

64 -128 +80 -15= (64 -128)= -64; (-64 +80)=16; (16 -15)=1≠0.

x=1/2:

64*(1/8) -128*(1/4) +80*(1/2) -15 = 8 -32 +40 -15= (8 -32)= -24; (-24 +40)=16; (16 -15)=1≠0.

x=3/4:

64*(27/64) -128*(9/16) +80*(3/4) -15 = 27 -72 +60 -15= (27 -72)= -45; (-45 +60)=15; (15 -15)=0.

So, x=3/4 is a root. Therefore, (x - 3/4) is a factor.

Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Divide 64x³ -128x² +80x -15 by (x - 3/4). Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by 4 to make it (4x -3).

Let me write the polynomial as 64x³ -128x² +80x -15.

Divide by (4x -3):

Using polynomial long division.

Divide 64x³ by 4x: 16x². Multiply (4x -3) by 16x²: 64x³ -48x².

Subtract from original polynomial:

(64x³ -128x² +80x -15) - (64x³ -48x²) = (-80x² +80x -15).

Now, divide -80x² by 4x: -20x. Multiply (4x -3) by -20x: -80x² +60x.

Subtract:

(-80x² +80x -15) - (-80x² +60x) = (20x -15).

Divide 20x by 4x: 5. Multiply (4x -3) by 5: 20x -15.

Subtract:

(20x -15) - (20x -15) = 0.

So, the division yields 16x² -20x +5.

Therefore, the polynomial factors as (4x -3)(16x² -20x +5)=0.

So, the roots are x=3/4 and solutions to 16x² -20x +5=0.

Compute discriminant: D=400 - 320=80.

So, x=(20 ± sqrt(80))/32= (20 ±4√5)/32= (5 ±√5)/8.

So, the roots are x=3/4, x=(5 +√5)/8, and x=(5 -√5)/8.

Compute approximate values:

sqrt(5)=≈2.236.

So, (5 +2.236)/8≈7.236/8≈0.9045.

And (5 -2.236)/8≈2.764/8≈0.3455.

So, the roots are approximately x=0.9045, x=0.3455, and x=0.9045.

Wait, actually, (5 -√5)/8 is approximately (5 - 2.236)/8≈2.764/8≈0.3455.

And (5 +√5)/8≈0.9045.

So, so the cubic equation 64x³ -128x² +80x -15=0 has roots at x=3/4, x≈0.3455, and x≈0.9045.

So, for λ=4, f(f(x))=x has solutions at x=3/4, x≈0.3455, and x≈0.9045.

But we know that x=3/4 is a fixed point, and x=0 is another fixed point. So, the other solutions are the 2-cycles.

So, for λ=4, there are three solutions to f(f(x))=x: x=0, x=3/4, and x≈0.3455 and x≈0.9045. Wait, but x=3/4 is a fixed point, so the other two solutions are the 2-cycles.

So, for λ=4, x=1/2 is not a solution, but the other two points are the 2-cycles.

So, for λ=4, there exist x≠fixed points such that f(f(x))=x.

Similarly, for λ between 1 and 4, I think there will be similar solutions, but let me see.

Wait, let's take λ=2, for example.

At λ=2, f(x)=2x(1 - x). Let me see if there are any x≠fixed points satisfying f(f(x))=x.

First, fixed points are x=0 and x=(2 +1)/2=3/2, which is outside [0,1]. So, only x=0 is a fixed point.

So, is there an x≠0 such that f(f(x))=x?

From earlier, f(f(x))=x would lead to a cubic equation. Let me try to solve it.

f(f(x))=2*(2x(1 -x))*(1 - 2x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

2*(2x(1 -x))*(1 - 2x(1 -x)) = x.

Divide both sides by x (assuming x≠0):

2*(2(1 -x))*(1 - 2x + 2x²) =1.

Compute:

2*(2(1 -x))*(1 - 2x + 2x²) =1.

This is:

4(1 -x)(1 - 2x + 2x²)=1.

Compute (1 -x)(1 -2x +2x²):

Multiply term by term:

1*(1 -2x +2x²) -x*(1 -2x +2x²)

= (1 -2x +2x²) - (x -2x² +2x³)

= 1 -2x +2x² -x +2x² -2x³

= 1 -3x +4x² -2x³.

So, the equation becomes:

4*(1 -3x +4x² -2x³)=1.

Multiply out:

4 -12x +16x² -8x³=1.

Bring 1 to left:

4 -12x +16x² -8x³ -1=0 ⇒ 3 -12x +16x² -8x³=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

8x³ -16x² +12x -3=0.

Let me try to factor this. Maybe rational roots. Possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±1/2, etc.

Test x=1:

8 -16 +12 -3=1≠0.

x=3/2: But 3/2 is outside [0,1], so maybe x=1/2:

8*(1/8) -16*(1/4) +12*(1/2) -3=1 -4 +6 -3=0.

So, x=1/2 is a root.

So, factor (x -1/2) from the polynomial.

Divide 8x³ -16x² +12x -3 by (x -1/2). Alternatively, multiply by 2: 2x -1.

Using synthetic division:

Divide 8x³ -16x² +12x -3 by (2x -1). Let me let t = 2x, so x = t/2.

Express polynomial in terms of t:

8*(t/2)^3 -16*(t/2)^2 +12*(t/2) -3 =8*(t³/8) -16*(t²/4) +12*(t/2) -3= t³ -4t² +6t -3.

So, now we have to factor t³ -4t² +6t -3.

Try t=1: 1 -4 +6 -3=0. So, t=1 is a root.

Factor (t -1):

Divide t³ -4t² +6t -3 by (t -1):

Using synthetic division:

1 | 1  -4   6   -3

         1  -3    3

      1  -3   3    0

So, quotient is t² -3t +3.

Thus, t³ -4t² +6t -3=(t -1)(t² -3t +3). So, original polynomial is (2x -1)(t² -3t +3).

But t=2x, so t²=4x², and -3t= -6x.

Thus, t² -3t +3=4x² -6x +3.

So, overall, 8x³ -16x² +12x -3=(2x -1)(4x² -6x +3).

Thus, the roots are x=1/2 and solutions to 4x² -6x +3=0.

Discriminant D=36 -48= -12 <0. So, only real root is x=1/2.

So, for λ=2, the equation f(f(x))=x has x=0, x=1/2, and x=1/2. Wait, but x=1/2 is a root with multiplicity? Wait, 4x² -6x +3=0 gives complex roots, so only real solution is x=1/2.

But 1/2 is a fixed point? Let me check f(1/2)=2*(1/2)*(1 -1/2)=2*(1/2)*(1/2)=2*(1/4)=1/2. So, yes, x=1/2 is a fixed point.

So, for λ=2, the only real solution is x=0 and x=1/2. So, no x≠fixed points satisfy f(f(x))=x.

Hmm, but that contradicts my earlier thought that for λ=4, there are solutions.

Wait, perhaps my approach is flawed. Maybe for some λ, the equation f(f(x))=x has real solutions other than fixed points.

Wait, for λ=4, we saw that x=1/2 is not a fixed point, but f(f(1/2))=0≠1/2, so in that case, f(f(x))=x has real solutions.

But for λ=2, it does not.

So, perhaps the values of λ where f(f(x))=x has real solutions other than fixed points are in some interval around λ=4.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the function g(x) = f(f(x)) - x and analyze its fixed points.

Alternatively, perhaps think about the function f and its iterates.

Alternatively, maybe think about the graph of f and the line y=x. The fixed points are intersections of f and y=x. The 2-cycles are intersections of f and f^{-1}, but since f is not necessarily invertible, except on certain intervals.

But perhaps it's better to analyze the function g(x) = f(f(x)) and see where it intersects y=x.

Alternatively, perhaps to consider the function f(f(x)) and analyze its behavior.

Given that f(x)=λx(1 -x). So, for x in [0,1], f(x) is in [0, λ/4], because the maximum of f(x) is at x=1/2, where f(1/2)=λ*(1/2)*(1 -1/2)=λ/4.

So, f maps [0,1] to [0, λ/4].

Then, f(f(x)) maps [0,1] to [0, f(λ/4)].

Compute f(λ/4):

λ*(λ/4)*(1 - λ/4)=λ²/4*(1 - λ/4)=λ²/4 - λ³/16.

So, f(f(x)) maps [0,1] to [0, λ²/4 - λ³/16].

So, for f(f(x)) to intersect y=x somewhere, we need that the range of f(f(x)) covers some part of [0,1]. So, we need λ²/4 - λ³/16 ≥0, which is equivalent to λ² ≥ λ³/4.

Multiply both sides by 16: 16λ² ≥4λ³ ⇒ 16λ² -4λ³ ≥0 ⇒ 4λ²(4 - λ) ≥0.

Since λ ∈ [0,4], 4 - λ ≥0, and λ² ≥0. Thus, 4λ²(4 - λ) ≥0 for all λ ∈ [0,4].

Therefore, the range of f(f(x)) is [0, λ²/4 - λ³/16], which is within [0,1] because λ²/4 - λ³/16 = (4λ² - λ³)/16 = λ²(4 - λ)/16.

Since λ ∈ [0,4], 4 - λ ≥0, so (4λ² - λ³)/16 is non-negative.

Therefore, as long as the range of f(f(x)) is within [0,1], which it is, the function f(f(x)) must cross y=x somewhere.

But wait, the fixed points are in [0,1], so is that always the case? Wait, no, because f(f(x)) is mapping [0,1] to [0, something], but it can still have fixed points.

Wait, but in the case of λ=2, we saw that f(f(x))=x had no real solutions except fixed points.

Wait, perhaps for certain λ, the equation f(f(x))=x has solutions that are not fixed points. So, I need to find for which λ, the equation f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points.

So, perhaps, despite the range of f(f(x)) being within [0,1], the equation f(f(x))=x can have solutions outside the fixed points.

Wait, but f(f(x)) maps [0,1] to [0, something], but since f(x) is λx(1 -x), and f(f(x)) is λ*(f(x))*(1 - f(x)), which is λ*f(x)*(1 - f(x)).

But f(x) is in [0, λ/4], so 1 - f(x) is in [1 - λ/4, 1].

Thus, f(f(x)) is in [0, λ*(λ/4)*(1 - λ/4)]= [0, λ²/4 - λ³/16].

So, as long as this range is within [0,1], which it is, since λ²/4 - λ³/16 = (4λ² - λ³)/16.

Which is non-negative for λ ∈ [0,4], as we saw.

So, the equation f(f(x))=x is equivalent to x=λ*f(x)*(1 - f(x)).

Thus, we can think of it as a function h(x)=λ*f(x)*(1 - f(x)) -x, and we are to find when h(x)=0 has solutions other than fixed points.

But perhaps, instead of getting bogged down in algebra, I can consider the function f(f(x)) -x and analyze its graph.

But another approach: for f(f(x))=x to have solutions, the function f must intersect the line y=x in more than just the fixed points. So, to have such intersections, f must have a certain shape.

Wait, but in our previous example with λ=4, f(f(x))=x had real solutions outside the fixed points.

Similarly, for λ=2, it didn't. Maybe, for some λ, the function f(f(x))=x has solutions, and for others, it doesn't.

But in the case of λ=4, we saw that x=1/2 is not a solution, but x= (5 ±√5)/8 are.

Wait, perhaps there is a critical value of λ where the equation f(f(x))=x starts having solutions.

Wait, maybe I can consider the function f(f(x)) as f^2(x) and note that for certain λ, f^2(x) will cross y=x.

Alternatively, think about the graph of f(x). For λ=4, f(x) is a downward parabola peaking at (0.5,1). So, f(f(x)) will be a quartic function, which may intersect y=x at more points.

Wait, but for λ=2, f(x) is a parabola peaking at x=0.5, but with a smaller maximum. So, f(f(x)) would be a more wiggly function, but perhaps not intersecting y=x at all except at fixed points.

Wait, maybe to think of the problem as a quadratic function.

Wait, wait, f(f(x))=x is a quartic equation, which can have up to four real roots. But we are only interested in real roots other than fixed points.

But perhaps there is a way to parameterize the solutions.

Wait, given that f(x)=λx(1 -x), so f(f(x))=λ*(λx(1 -x))*(1 - λx(1 -x)).

So, f(f(x))=λ²x(1 -x)(1 - λx(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

λ²x(1 -x)(1 - λx(1 -x))=x.

Assuming x≠0, we can divide both sides by x:

λ²(1 -x)(1 - λx(1 -x))=1.

So, 1 -x - λx(1 -x) - λ²x²(1 -x) =1.

Wait, no, let me multiply it out:

λ²(1 -x)(1 - λx + λx²)=1.

Which is similar to earlier.

But perhaps instead of going through all this, maybe try to set t = x(1 -x). Then, f(x)=λt.

Then, f(f(x))=λf(t)=λ*λt(1 -t)=λ²t(1 -t).

So, f(f(x))=λ²t(1 -t).

Set equal to x:

λ²t(1 -t) =x.

But t =x(1 -x).

Thus, we have:

λ²x(1 -x)(1 -x(1 -x))=x.

Again, similar equation.

Wait, perhaps to think about f(f(x))=x in terms of t.

So, t =x(1 -x), so x = t / (1 - t). Wait, but x must be in [0,1], so t must be in [0,1/4].

So, substituting back:

f(f(x))=λ²t(1 -t)=x= t/(1 - t).

Wait, so:

λ²t(1 -t)=t/(1 - t).

Assuming t ≠0, divide both sides by t:

λ²(1 -t)=1/(1 - t).

Multiply both sides by (1 - t):

λ²(1 -t)^2=1.

Thus,

1 - t = ±1/λ.

So, t=1 ∓1/λ.

But t =x(1 -x) ∈ [0,1/4].

So, 1 - t must be between 1 -1/4=3/4 and 1.

So, 1 - t=1/λ, so t=1 -1/λ.

But t=1 -1/λ must be in [0,1/4].

So,

0 ≤1 -1/λ ≤1/4.

Which implies:

1 -1/λ ≥0 ⇒1/λ ≤1 ⇒λ ≥1.

And,

1 -1/λ ≤1/4 ⇒ -1/λ ≤ -3/4 ⇒1/λ ≥3/4 ⇒λ ≤4/3.

So, combining these, we have 1 ≤λ ≤4/3.

Thus, for λ ∈ [1,4/3], t=1 -1/λ, and thus x= t/(1 -t)= [1 -1/λ]/(1 - [1 -1/λ])= [1 -1/λ]/(1/λ)= λ(1 -1/λ)=λ -1.

So, x=λ -1.

But since x must be in [0,1], x=λ -1 ∈ [0,1] ⇒λ ∈ [1,2].

But for λ ∈ [1,4/3], t=1 -1/λ ∈ [1 -1/4/3,1 -1/1]= [3/4,0]. Wait, no, t=1 -1/λ.

Wait, for λ=1, t=0. For λ=4/3, t=1 - 3/4=1/4.

So, t ∈ [0,1/4] for λ ∈ [1,4/3].

So, x= t/(1 -t)= [1 -1/λ]/(1/λ)=λ(1 -1/λ)=λ -1.

So, x=λ -1.

Thus, for λ ∈ [1,4/3], x=λ -1 is a solution, which is in [0,1/3].

Therefore, when λ ∈ [1,4/3], x=λ -1 is a fixed point of f(f(x))=x and is not a fixed point of f(x)=x.

Because f(λ -1)=λ*(λ -1)*(1 - (λ -1))=λ*(λ -1)*(2 -λ).

For λ=1: f(0)=0, which is fixed.

For λ=4/3: f(1/3)= (4/3)*(1/3)*(1 -1/3)= (4/3)*(1/3)*(2/3)=8/27≈0.296, which is not 1/3. Wait, but according to earlier, x=1 -1/λ=1 -3/4=1/4.

Wait, so x=1/4.

Wait, hold on, earlier, for λ=4/3, t=1 -1/λ=1 -3/4=1/4.

Thus, x= t/(1 -t)= [1/4]/[3/4]=1/3.

Wait, this is conflicting with the earlier conclusion.

Wait, no, f(x)=λx(1 -x).

So, for x=1 -1/λ=1 -3/4=1/4, f(x)=λ*(1/4)*(1 -1/4)=λ*(1/4)*(3/4)=3λ/16.

But for λ=4/3, f(1/4)=3*(4/3)/16= (4)/16=1/4, so x=1/4 is a fixed point.

Wait, but according to the earlier substitution, x=λ -1=4/3 -1=1/3.

But f(1/3)= (4/3)*(1/3)*(1 -1/3)= (4/9)*(2/3)=8/27≈0.296≠1/3.

Therefore, x=1/3 is not a fixed point, but x=1/4 is a fixed point. So, x=1 -1/λ is a fixed point only when f(1 -1/λ)=λ*(1 -1/λ)*(1 - [1 -1/λ])=λ*(1 -1/λ)*(1/λ)= (λ*(1 -1/λ)*(1/λ))=1 -1/λ.

Wait, that suggests f(1 -1/λ)=1 -1/λ, which is the same as x.

So, x=1 -1/λ is a fixed point.

But in the case of λ=4/3, x=1 -1/λ=1 -3/4=1/4.

And indeed, f(1/4)=4/3*(1/4)*(1 -1/4)=4/3*(1/4)*(3/4)= (4/3)*(3/16)=1/4. So, yes, x=1/4 is a fixed point.

But when x=λ -1, for λ=4/3, x=1/3, which is not a fixed point.

Wait, so perhaps my earlier substitution was wrong.

Wait, let's redo:

We had t=1 -1/λ, then x= t/(1 -t)= [1 -1/λ]/(1 -[1 -1/λ])= [λ -1]/λ / (1/λ)= [λ -1]/λ * λ= λ -1.

But f(x)=λx(1 -x)=λ*(λ -1)*(1 - (λ -1))=λ*(λ -1)*(2 -λ).

Set equal to x=λ -1:

λ*(λ -1)*(2 -λ)=λ -1.

Assuming λ ≠1, we can divide both sides by (λ -1):

λ*(2 -λ)=1.

Thus,

2λ -λ²=1 ⇒λ² -2λ +1=0 ⇒(λ -1)^2=0 ⇒λ=1.

So, only solution is λ=1, which gives x=0.

But for λ=4/3, x=1 -1/λ=1/3, but f(1/3)=8/27≈0.296≠1/3. So, perhaps my mistake was in the substitution.

Wait, in the substitution above, I concluded that 1 -t=1/λ, but that led to x=λ -1, which is a fixed point only when λ=1.

But when λ=4/3, x=1 -1/λ=1 -3/4=1/4, which is a fixed point.

So, perhaps more accurately, t=1 -1/λ.

But when t=1 -1/λ, then f(x)=λ*t*(1 -t)=λ*(1 -1/λ)*(1 - (1 -1/λ))=λ*(1 -1/λ)*(1/λ)= (λ*(1 -1/λ)*(1/λ))=1 -1/λ.

Wait, that's not correct because f(x)=λ*t*(1 -t)=λ*(1 -1/λ)*(1 - (1 -1/λ))=λ*(1 -1/λ)*(1/λ)=1 -1/λ.

Wait, so f(x)=x in this case, which is only possible when x=1 -1/λ.

But for λ=4/3, x=1 -1/λ=1 -3/4=1/4, which is indeed a fixed point.

Thus, for λ ∈ [1,4/3], x=1 -1/λ is a fixed point of f(f(x))=x, but not a fixed point of f(x)=x.

Therefore, for λ ∈ [1,4/3], there exists x≠fixed points such that f(f(x))=x.

But wait, earlier when I took λ=2, which is greater than 4/3≈1.333, I found that x= (5 ±√5)/8 are the solutions, but in that case, x was not equal to fixed points.

But according to the above analysis, x=1 -1/λ is a fixed point only when λ ∈ [1,4/3]. So, for λ >4/3, x=1 -1/λ is not a fixed point, but f(f(x))=x still has solutions.

So, that suggests that for λ ∈ [1,4/3], x=1 -1/λ is a solution, and for λ >4/3, there are solutions not corresponding to x=1 -1/λ.

Therefore, the values of λ where such x exists are from 1 to 4/3.

Wait, but is that the case?

Wait, for λ=4/3, x=1 -1/λ=1 -3/4=1/4 is a fixed point.

But for λ >4/3, for example, λ=2, x=1 -1/2=1/2 is not a fixed point, but f(f(1/2))=f(1/2)=1/2, so f(f(1/2))=1/2, which would imply f(f(x))=x at x=1/2, but 1/2 is a fixed point.

Wait, but in the case of λ=2, we saw that f(f(x))=x has solutions at x=0, x=1/2, and x= some other point. Wait, no, when λ=2, f(f(x))=x had x=0 and x=1/2, which are fixed points.

Wait, but earlier when I computed for λ=2, the equation f(f(x))=x had x=0 and x=1/2 as solutions, but when I attempted to solve it, I thought there was another solution. Maybe I made a mistake in that process.

Wait, for λ=2, f(x)=2x(1 -x). So, f(f(x))=2*(2x(1 -x))*(1 -2x(1 -x)).

So, set equal to x:

2*(2x(1 -x))*(1 -2x(1 -x))=x.

Let me compute:

2*(2x(1 -x))*(1 -2x +2x²)=x.

Compute (1 -2x +2x²):

So, 2*(2x(1 -x))*(1 -2x +2x²)=4x(1 -x)*(1 -2x +2x²).

Set equal to x:

4x(1 -x)*(1 -2x +2x²)=x.

Assuming x≠0, divide both sides by x:

4(1 -x)*(1 -2x +2x²)=1.

Compute (1 -x)(1 -2x +2x²):

First, multiply (1 -x) by (1 -2x +2x²):

=1*(1 -2x +2x²) -x*(1 -2x +2x²)

= (1 -2x +2x²) - (x -2x² +2x³)

=1 -2x +2x² -x +2x² -2x³

=1 -3x +4x² -2x³.

Thus, equation becomes:

4*(1 -3x +4x² -2x³)=1.

Multiply:

4 -12x +16x² -8x³=1.

Bring 1 to left:

4 -12x +16x² -8x³ -1=0 ⇒3 -12x +16x² -8x³=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

8x³ -16x² +12x -3=0.

Try rational roots: possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±1/2, etc.

Test x=1:8 -16 +12 -3=1≠0.

x=1/2:8*(1/8) -16*(1/4)+12*(1/2)-3=1 -4 +6 -3=0.

So, x=1/2 is a root.

Factor out (x -1/2):

Divide 8x³ -16x² +12x -3 by (x -1/2):

Using synthetic division:

Root:1/2.

Coefficients:8, -16,12, -3.

Bring down 8.

Multiply 8 by1/2=4. Add to -16: -12.

Multiply -12 by1/2= -6. Add to12:6.

Multiply 6 by1/2=3. Add to -3:0.

Thus, quotient polynomial:8x² -12x +6.

So, 8x³ -16x² +12x -3=(x -1/2)(8x² -12x +6).

Set equal to zero:

(x -1/2)(8x² -12x +6)=0.

Solutions are x=1/2 and roots of 8x² -12x +6=0.

Compute discriminant:144 -192= -48 <0.

Thus, only real solution is x=1/2.

Therefore, for λ=2, f(f(x))=x has only x=0 and x=1/2 as solutions, both fixed points. So, no solutions other than fixed points.

Wait, but earlier when I tried to solve f(f(x))=x for λ=2, I thought x≈0.3455 was a solution, but that must have been a mistake.

So, perhaps for λ>4/3, the equation f(f(x))=x does not have solutions other than fixed points.

Wait, but for λ=2, which is between 1 and 4/3≈1.333, we saw that f(f(x))=x only has fixed points, so it doesn't have solutions other than fixed points.

Wait, but earlier, for λ=2, f(f(x))=x had only solutions at x=0 and x=1/2, which are fixed points.

Wait, but for λ=4, we saw that x=1/2 is not a fixed point, but f(f(1/2))=0≠1/2. So, for λ=4, does f(f(x))=x have solutions other than fixed points?

Wait, when I solved f(f(x))=x for λ=4, I found x=0, and x=(5 ±√5)/8≈0.3455 and 0.9045.

Wait, let me check if these are fixed points: f(0.3455)=4*0.3455*(1 -0.3455)≈4*0.3455*0.6545≈4*0.227≈0.908≈0.9045, so approximately fixed.

Similarly, f(0.9045)=4*0.9045*(1 -0.9045)≈4*0.9045*0.0955≈4*0.086≈0.3455.

So, approximately, x=0.3455 and x=0.9045 are fixed points.

But when I plugged x=0.3455 into f(f(x)), I got approximately 0.9045, which is not equal to 0.3455, which suggests that perhaps f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points?

Wait, but when I computed f(f(x))=4*(4x(1 -x))*(1 -4x(1 -x))=4*(4x -4x²)*(1 -4x +4x²)= (16x -16x²)*(1 -4x +4x²).

Set equal to x:

(16x -16x²)*(1 -4x +4x²)=x.

But earlier, I found that x= (5 ±√5)/8 are roots. So, perhaps my numerical calculation was wrong.

Wait, let me compute f(f(0.3455)):

First, compute f(0.3455)=4*0.3455*(1 -0.3455)=4*0.3455*0.6545≈4*0.227≈0.908.

Then, compute f(0.908)=4*0.908*(1 -0.908)=4*0.908*0.092≈4*0.0837≈0.335.

Which is approximately 0.3455, which is close to x=0.3455, but not exactly. So, perhaps the exact solution is x= (5 +√5)/8≈0.9045 and x=(5 -√5)/8≈0.3455.

Wait, so let me compute f(f( (5 +√5)/8 )):

First, compute f(x)=4x(1 -x).

So, 4x(1 -x)=4*( (5 +√5)/8 )*(1 - (5 +√5)/8 )= (5 +√5)/2 * ( (8 -5 -√5)/8 )= (5 +√5)/2 * (3 -√5)/8.

Multiply numerator: (5 +√5)(3 -√5)=15 -5√5 +3√5 -5=10 -2√5.

Thus, 4x(1 -x)= (10 -2√5)/16= (5 -√5)/8.

Now, compute f(f(x))=4*( (5 -√5)/8 )*(1 - (5 -√5)/8 ).

Compute 4*( (5 -√5)/8 )*(1 - (5 -√5)/8 ).

First, compute 1 - (5 -√5)/8= (8 -5 +√5)/8=(3 +√5)/8.

Then, 4*( (5 -√5)/8 )*( (3 +√5)/8 ).

Multiply the constants:4*(1/8)*(1/8)=4/64=1/16.

Multiply numerators: (5 -√5)(3 +√5)=15 +5√5 -3√5 -5=10 +2√5.

Thus, f(f(x))= (10 +2√5)/16= (5 +√5)/8.

Which is the original x. So, yes, x=(5 +√5)/8 is a fixed point.

Similarly, for x=(5 -√5)/8, f(f(x))=x.

Therefore, when λ=4, f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points: x=(5 ±√5)/8≈0.9045 and x≈0.3455.

Therefore, for λ=4, there exist x≠fixed points such that f(f(x))=x.

So, it seems that for λ ≥4, f(f(x))=x has solutions not equal to fixed points.

Wait, but for λ=3, let's see if f(f(x))=x has solutions.

Set λ=3.

Then, f(x)=3x(1 -x).

f(f(x))=3*(3x(1 -x))*(1 -3x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

3*(3x(1 -x))*(1 -3x +3x²)=x.

Compute inside:

3x(1 -x)=3x -3x².

1 -3x +3x² is as is.

Thus, f(f(x))=3*(3x -3x²)*(1 -3x +3x²).

Set equal to x:

3*(3x -3x²)*(1 -3x +3x²)=x.

Factor out 3x:

3x*(3 -3x)*(1 -3x +3x²)=x.

If x≠0, divide both sides by x:

3*(3 -3x)*(1 -3x +3x²)=1.

Compute (3 -3x)*(1 -3x +3x²):

=3*(1 -3x +3x²) -3x*(1 -3x +3x²)

=3 -9x +9x² -3x +9x² -9x³

=3 -12x +18x² -9x³.

Thus, equation:

3*(3 -12x +18x² -9x³)=1.

Multiply:

9 -36x +54x² -27x³=1.

Bring 1 to left:

9 -36x +54x² -27x³ -1=0 ⇒8 -36x +54x² -27x³=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

27x³ -54x² +36x -8=0.

Try rational roots: possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±1/3, etc.

Test x=1:27 -54 +36 -8=1≠0.

x=2/3:27*(8/27) -54*(4/9) +36*(2/3) -8=8 -24 +24 -8=0.

So, x=2/3 is a root.

Factor out (x -2/3):

Divide 27x³ -54x² +36x -8 by (x -2/3).

Using synthetic division:

Root:2/3.

Coefficients:27, -54,36,-8.

Bring down 27.

Multiply 27 by2/3=18. Add to -54: -36.

Multiply -36 by2/3= -24. Add to36:12.

Multiply 12 by2/3=8. Add to -8:0.

Thus, quotient is27x² -36x +12.

Factor: 27x² -36x +12=3(9x² -12x +4)=3(3x -2)^2.

Thus, equation factors as (x -2/3)*3*(3x -2)^2=0.

Thus, roots are x=2/3 and x=2/3 (double root). So, only solution is x=2/3.

Check if x=2/3 is a fixed point: f(2/3)=3*(2/3)*(1 -2/3)=3*(2/3)*(1/3)=2/3. So, yes, x=2/3 is a fixed point.

Thus, for λ=3, x=2/3 is a fixed point, and is the only solution. So, no solutions other than fixed points.

Wait, but earlier when I tried solving f(f(x))=x for λ=3, I thought there might be other solutions, but seems like it only has fixed points.

Wait, but for λ=4, there are solutions other than fixed points, but for λ=3, only fixed points exist.

So, perhaps, for λ=4, f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points, but for λ <4, only fixed points exist.

But wait, for λ=4, it's the case where the equation f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points.

Wait, maybe the threshold is at λ=4. So, for λ ∈ [1,4], there exist x≠fixed points such that f(f(x))=x.

But wait, when λ=4, x= (5 ±√5)/8, which are not fixed points.

But when λ=3, which is less than4, the only solution is fixed point.

Wait, but earlier, for λ=3, f(f(x))=x only had fixed points.

So, what's the exact value?

Wait, perhaps the critical value is λ=4, beyond which f(f(x))=x gains solutions not at fixed points.

So, perhaps, for λ ∈ [1,4], x≠fixed points satisfy f(f(x))=x.

But when λ=1, x=0 is the only solution.

Wait, when λ=1, f(x)=x(1 -x). So, f(f(x))=f(x(1 -x))=λ*(x(1 -x))(1 -x(1 -x)).

Set f(f(x))=x: λ*(x(1 -x))(1 -x(1 -x))=x.

For λ=1: (x(1 -x))(1 -x(1 -x))=x.

As before, which leads to x=0 and x=1/2.

So, x=0 is fixed point, x=1/2 is fixed point.

So, for λ=1, x=1/2 is fixed point, and x=0.

Wait, but is x=1/2 a fixed point for λ=1?

Compute f(1/2)=1*(1/2)*(1 -1/2)=1/4≠1/2.

Wait, so x=1/2 is not a fixed point for λ=1.

Wait, when λ=1, fixed points are x=0 and x=1/2.

Wait, when λ=1, f(x)=x(1 -x).

Set x= f(x):x =x(1 -x) ⇒x= x -x² ⇒x²=0⇒x=0. So, fixed point at x=0.

But x=1/2: f(1/2)=1*(1/2)*(1 -1/2)=1/4≠1/2, so not fixed.

Thus, for λ=1, fixed points are only x=0 and x=1/2 is not fixed, but wait, no, wait:

Wait, if λ=1, then f(x)=x(1 -x). So, solving x=λx(1 -x)=x(1 -x).

So, x=x -x² ⇒0= -x² ⇒x=0.

So, only fixed point is x=0.

Thus, for λ=1, only x=0 is fixed.

But earlier, when I set f(f(x))=x for λ=1, I found x=0 and x=1/2.

Wait, but x=1/2: f(1/2)=1*(1/2)*(1 -1/2)=1/4≠1/2, so x=1/2 is not a fixed point.

Wait, but if f(f(x))=x for λ=1, at x=1/2, f(f(1/2))=f(1/4)=1*(1/4)*(1 -1/4)=3/16≠1/2.

So, x=1/2 is not a solution for λ=1.

Thus, for λ=1, only x=0 is a fixed point.

Wait, but in the case of λ=1, f(f(x))=x equation only has x=0 as a solution.

Wait, no, when λ=1, f(f(x))=x is x=0 and x=1/2.

But x=1/2 is not a fixed point, but f(f(1/2))=3/16≠1/2.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in solving for λ=1.

Wait, for λ=1, f(f(x))=x is x=0 and x=1/2, but x=1/2 is not a fixed point, but is a solution of f(f(x))=x.

Wait, let me check:

f(f(1/2))=f(1*(1/2)*(1 -1/2))=f(1/4)=1*(1/4)*(1 -1/4)=3/16≠1/2.

So, x=1/2 is not a solution.

Wait, then for λ=1, f(f(x))=x has only x=0 as a solution.

Wait, but earlier, when solving for λ=1, I arrived at x=0 and x=1/2, but that may have been incorrect.

Wait, f(f(x))=x for λ=1 is x=0 and x=1/2.

But f(f(1/2))=3/16≠1/2, so x=1/2 is not a solution.

Therefore, for λ=1, only x=0 is a solution.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, let me think again.

For λ=1, f(x)=x(1 -x). So, f(f(x))=x(1 -x)(1 -x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

x(1 -x)(1 -x(1 -x))=x.

Assuming x≠0, divide both sides by x:

(1 -x)(1 -x(1 -x))=1.

Compute (1 -x)(1 -x(1 -x))= (1 -x)(1 -x +x²)= (1 -x)(1 -x +x²).

Multiply:

=1*(1 -x +x²) -x*(1 -x +x²)

=1 -x +x² -x +x² -x³

=1 -2x +2x² -x³.

Set equal to1:

1 -2x +2x² -x³=1 ⇒-2x +2x² -x³=0 ⇒x(-2 +2x -x²)=0.

Thus, x=0, or -2 +2x -x²=0 ⇒x² -2x +2=0.

But discriminant is 4 -8= -4 <0, so only real solution is x=0.

Thus, for λ=1, only x=0 is a solution.

Thus, for λ=1, only x=0 is a solution, which is a fixed point.

Similarly, for λ=2, x=0 and x=1/2 are solutions. x=1/2 is not a fixed point, as f(1/2)=1/4≠1/2.

Wait, but earlier, when I set f(f(x))=x for λ=2, I thought x= (5 ±√5)/8 were solutions, but that's only if x= (5 ±√5)/8 are fixed points.

Wait, let me compute f(f(x))=x for λ=2, x= (5 +√5)/8≈0.9045.

Compute f(x)=2*x*(1 -x).

So, f(x)=2*0.9045*(1 -0.9045)=2*0.9045*0.0955≈2*0.086≈0.172.

Then, f(f(x))=2*0.172*(1 -0.172)≈2*0.172*0.828≈2*0.142≈0.284.

Which is not equal to x≈0.9045.

Wait, so perhaps my earlier calculation was wrong.

Wait, no, actually, for x= (5 +√5)/8≈0.9045, f(x)=2*(5 +√5)/8*(1 - (5 +√5)/8)= (5 +√5)/4*( (8 -5 -√5)/8 )= (5 +√5)/4*(3 -√5)/8.

Compute numerator: (5 +√5)(3 -√5)=15 -5√5 +3√5 -5=10 -2√5.

Thus, f(x)= (10 -2√5)/32= (5 -√5)/16≈(5 -2.236)/16≈2.764/16≈0.172.

Then, f(f(x))=2*(0.172)*(1 -0.172)=2*0.172*0.828≈2*0.142≈0.284.

Which is not equal to x≈0.9045.

Wait, then perhaps x= (5 ±√5)/8 are not solutions for λ=2.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption was wrong.

Wait, if x= (5 +√5)/8 is a solution, then f(f(x))=x.

But when I computed f(f(x)), I got 0.284, which is not equal to x≈0.9045.

Thus, perhaps my earlier assumption was wrong.

Wait, perhaps x= (5 +√5)/8 is not a solution.

Wait, maybe I made a computational error.

Wait, let me compute f(f(x))=x for λ=2 and x=(5 +√5)/8.

Compute f(x)=2*x*(1 -x).

Given x=(5 +√5)/8, compute 2*x*(1 -x):

First, 2*x=2*(5 +√5)/8=(5 +√5)/4.

1 -x=1 - (5 +√5)/8=(8 -5 -√5)/8=(3 -√5)/8.

Thus, f(x)= (5 +√5)/4 * (3 -√5)/8= (5 +√5)(3 -√5)/32.

Compute numerator: (5 +√5)(3 -√5)=15 -5√5 +3√5 -5=10 -2√5.

Thus, f(x)= (10 -2√5)/32= (5 -√5)/16.

Then, compute f(f(x))=2*f(x)*(1 -f(x)).

Compute f(x)=(5 -√5)/16.

Compute 2*f(x)=2*(5 -√5)/16=(5 -√5)/8.

Compute 1 -f(x)=1 - (5 -√5)/16=(16 -5 +√5)/16=(11 +√5)/16.

Thus, f(f(x))= (5 -√5)/8 * (11 +√5)/16.

Compute numerator: (5 -√5)(11 +√5)=55 +5√5 -11√5 -5=50 -6√5.

Thus, f(f(x))= (50 -6√5)/128= (25 -3√5)/64≈(25 -6.708)/64≈18.292/64≈0.2858.

Which is approximately 0.2858, not equal to x≈0.9045.

Therefore, x= (5 +√5)/8 is not a solution for λ=2.

Thus, perhaps my earlier approach was flawed.

Wait, maybe I should reconsider.

Given that for λ ∈ [1,4], there exists x≠fixed points such that f(f(x))=x.

But for λ=4, x= (5 ±√5)/8 are fixed points.

Wait, but for λ=4, f(f(x))=x has solutions at x=0, and x=(5 ±√5)/8 which are fixed points.

Thus, for λ=4, the equation f(f(x))=x does not have x≠fixed points as solutions.

But for λ>4, does f(f(x))=x have solutions not at fixed points?

Wait, for λ=5, let's test.

Set λ=5, f(x)=5x(1 -x).

Compute f(f(x))=5*(5x(1 -x))*(1 -5x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

5*(5x(1 -x))*(1 -5x(1 -x))=x.

Assume x≠0, divide both sides by x:

5*(5(1 -x))*(1 -5x +5x²)=1.

Compute (5(1 -x))*(1 -5x +5x²)=5*(1 -x -5x +5x² +5x² -5x³)=5*(1 -6x +10x² -5x³)=5 -30x +50x² -25x³.

Thus, equation:

5*(5 -30x +50x² -25x³)=1 ⇒25 -150x +250x² -125x³=1 ⇒ -125x³ +250x² -150x +24=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

125x³ -250x² +150x -24=0.

Try rational roots: possible roots are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, ±1/5, etc.

Test x=24/125≈0.192.

But let me test x=2/5=0.4:

125*(0.4)^3 -250*(0.4)^2 +150*(0.4) -24.

Compute:

125*(0.064)=8,

-250*(0.16)= -40,

150*(0.4)=60,

-24.

Total:8 -40 +60 -24=0.

So, x=2/5=0.4 is a root.

Factor out (x -2/5):

Use synthetic division:

Root=2/5.

Coefficients:125, -250,150,-24.

Bring down 125.

Multiply 125 by2/5=50. Add to -250: -200.

Multiply -200 by2/5= -80. Add to150:70.

Multiply70 by2/5=28. Add to -24:4≠0. Wait, that's not zero.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, 125*(2/5)^3 -250*(2/5)^2 +150*(2/5) -24.

Compute:

(2/5)^3=8/125, 125*(8/125)=8.

(2/5)^2=4/25, -250*(4/25)= -40.

150*(2/5)=60.

So, total:8 -40 +60 -24=0. So, correct.

Then, synthetic division:

Bring down 125.

Multiply 125 by2/5=50. Add to -250: -200.

Multiply -200 by2/5= -80. Add to150:70.

Multiply70 by2/5=28. Add to -24:4≠0.

Wait, thus, I made a mistake.

Wait, but x=2/5 is a root, so the polynomial should factor as (x -2/5)(quadratic).

But with the above, it's not working. So, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, the polynomial is 125x³ -250x² +150x -24.

At x=2/5, it equals 0.

Let me write it as (x -2/5)(Ax² +Bx +C)=125x³ -250x² +150x -24.

Multiply out:

x*(Ax² +Bx +C)=Ax³ +Bx² +Cx.

-2/5*(Ax² +Bx +C)= -2/5 Ax² -2/5 Bx -2/5 C.

Combine:

Ax³ +Bx² +Cx - (2/5)Ax² - (2/5)Bx - (2/5)C.

Group like terms:

Ax³ + (B - 2A/5)x² + (C - 2B/5)x -2C/5.

Set equal to 125x³ -250x² +150x -24.

Thus, equate coefficients:

A=125.

B - 2A/5= -250 ⇒B - 2*125/5= B -50= -250 ⇒B= -200.

C -2B/5=150 ⇒C -2*(-200)/5= C +80=150 ⇒C=70.

-2C/5= -24 ⇒-2*70/5= -28≠-24.

Thus, discrepancy.

Hence, x=2/5 is not a root. But when I plugged x=2/5, I get 0.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, 125*(2/5)^3 -250*(2/5)^2 +150*(2/5) -24.

Compute:

(2/5)^3=8/125, 125*(8/125)=8.

(2/5)^2=4/25, -250*(4/25)= -40.

150*(2/5)=60.

So, 8 -40 +60 -24=0.

So, x=2/5 is a root.

But when I factor out (x -2/5), I get a remainder, which suggests an error.

Wait, perhaps I should use polynomial division.

Divide 125x³ -250x² +150x -24 by (x -2/5).

Using synthetic division:

Multiply by 5/2 to avoid fractions:

Root=2/5, multiply 5/2 to get polynomial coefficients:

125x³ -250x² +150x -24.

Multiply by (5/2):

625x³ -1250x² +750x -120.

Now, divide 625x³ -1250x² +750x -120 by (5x -2).

Using synthetic division for 5x -2=0 ⇒x=2/5.

Coefficients:625, -1250,750,-120.

Bring down 625.

Multiply 625 by2/5=250. Add to -1250: -1000.

Multiply -1000 by2/5= -400. Add to750:350.

Multiply350 by2/5=140. Add to -120:20≠0.

Thus, not a root.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Alternatively, since x=2/5 is a root, perhaps I can factor as (x -2/5)(something).

But as above, the division didn't work.

Alternatively, maybe I should not use synthetic division.

Alternatively, perhaps use polynomial division.

Wait, let me write the polynomial as:

125x³ -250x² +150x -24.

Divide by (x -2/5):

Let me write it as (5x -2).

So, divide 125x³ -250x² +150x -24 by (5x -2).

Using polynomial long division:

Divide 125x³ by5x: 25x².

Multiply (5x -2) by25x²=125x³ -50x².

Subtract from original polynomial:

(125x³ -250x² +150x -24) - (125x³ -50x²)=0x³ -200x² +150x -24.

Divide -200x² by5x: -40x.

Multiply (5x -2) by -40x= -200x² +80x.

Subtract:

(-200x² +150x -24) - (-200x² +80x)=0x² +70x -24.

Divide70x by5x:14.

Multiply (5x -2) by14=70x -28.

Subtract:

(70x -24) - (70x -28)=0x +4≠0.

So, the division leaves a remainder of4, which suggests that x=2/5 is not a root, but earlier plugging in x=2/5 gives zero. Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, in reality, if I plug x=2/5 into f(f(x))=x, it's supposed to be zero, but when I computed, I got zero. So, x=2/5 is a root.

But when I perform the polynomial division, I get a remainder, which suggests a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made an arithmetic mistake.

Wait, let me recompute the polynomial at x=2/5:

125*(2/5)^3 -250*(2/5)^2 +150*(2/5) -24.

=125*(8/125) -250*(4/25) +150*(2/5) -24.

=8 -40 +60 -24=0.

So, x=2/5 is a root.

But when I did the polynomial division, I thought there was a remainder.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the division.

Let me try again.

Divide 125x³ -250x² +150x -24 by (5x -2).

First term:125x³ /5x=25x².

Multiply (5x -2) by25x²=125x³ -50x².

Subtract: (125x³ -250x² +150x -24) - (125x³ -50x²)=0x³ -200x² +150x -24.

Next term: -200x² /5x= -40x.

Multiply (5x -2) by -40x= -200x² +80x.

Subtract: (-200x² +150x -24) - (-200x² +80x)=0x² +70x -24.

Next term:70x /5x=14.

Multiply (5x -2) by14=70x -28.

Subtract: (70x -24) - (70x -28)=0x +4.

Thus, the remainder is4, which should mean that x=2/5 is not a root, but in reality, it is.

Thus, my polynomial division is incorrect.

Wait, I think the issue is that when I multiplied by5/2, I introduced an error.

Wait, another approach: Use the factor theorem.

If x=2/5 is a root, then (5x -2) is a factor.

But when I divided, I got a remainder, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the factor theorem with x=2/5.

But given that f(f(x))=x at x=2/5, it's a root, so perhaps I have to accept that x=2/5 is a root and proceed.

Thus, for λ=5, f(f(x))=x has x=0 and x=2/5 as solutions.

Therefore, x=2/5 is a fixed point?

Wait, no, because f(2/5)=5*(2/5)*(1 -2/5)=5*(2/5)*(3/5)=6/5≠2/5.

Wait, so x=2/5 is not a fixed point.

Thus, for λ=5, f(f(x))=x has solutions x=0 and x=2/5, which are not fixed points.

Thus, for λ=5, x=2/5 is a solution.

Therefore, for λ ∈ [1,4], x≠fixed points satisfy f(f(x))=x.

Wait, but for λ=4, x= (5 ±√5)/8 are fixed points, so f(f(x))=x has only fixed points as solutions.

Therefore, for λ ∈ [1,4], the equation f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points.

For λ=4, only fixed points.

For λ>4, does f(f(x))=x have solutions other than fixed points?

Wait, let's take λ=5 again.

f(f(x))=5*(5x(1 -x))*(1 -5x(1 -x))=25x(1 -x)*(1 -5x +5x²).

Set equal to x:25x(1 -x)(1 -5x +5x²)=x.

Assuming x≠0, divide by x:

25*(1 -x)(1 -5x +5x²)=1.

Compute (1 -x)(1 -5x +5x²)=1 -5x +5x² -x +5x² -5x³=1 -6x +10x² -5x³.

Thus, 25*(1 -6x +10x² -5x³)=1 ⇒25 -150x +250x² -125x³=1 ⇒-125x³ +250x² -150x +24=0.

Multiply by -1:

125x³ -250x² +150x -24=0.

Which is the same as before.

We saw that x=2/5 is a root, but when I divided, I got a remainder.

Thus, perhaps x=2/5 is a solution, and the other roots are complex.

Thus, for λ=5, f(f(x))=x has x=0, x=2/5 as solutions.

Therefore, for λ=5, the equation f(f(x))=x has solutions not at fixed points.

Wait, but when I plugged in x=2/5, f(f(x))=x.

Wait, yes, f(f(2/5))=2/5.

Therefore, for λ=5, x=2/5 is a solution.

Thus, for λ>4, x= (5 ±√5)/8 are fixed points, but also, perhaps, f(f(x))=x has solutions at x=0 and x=1/2.

Wait, when λ=5, f(f(x))=x has x=0 and x=2/5.

But, when I tested x=1/2 earlier, f(f(1/2))=0≠1/2, so x=1/2 is not a solution.

Thus, for λ>4, f(f(x))=x has solutions at x=0, x=1/2 (fixed points), and x= (5 ±√5)/8 (fixed points if λ>4).

Wait, but wait, for λ=5, x= (5 +√5)/8≈0.9045.

Compute f(f(x))=5*(5x(1 -x))*(1 -5x(1 -x)).

x≈0.9045.

Compute f(x)=5x(1 -x)≈5*0.9045*0.0955≈5*0.086≈0.43.

Then, f(f(x))=5*0.43*(1 -0.43)=5*0.43*0.57≈5*0.245≈1.225.

Wait, which is not equal to x≈0.9045.

Wait, contradiction.

Wait, perhaps my calculation was wrong.

Wait, compute f(f(x))=5*(5x(1 -x))*(1 -5x(1 -x)).

With x≈0.9045:

5x(1 -x)=5*0.9045*0.0955≈0.43.

Then, 1 -0.43≈0.57.

Thus, f(f(x))≈5*0.43*0.57≈5*0.245≈1.225.

But x≈0.9045≠1.225.

Wait, so perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, but according to the equation, f(f(x))=x for λ=5, so x= (5 ±√5)/8 should satisfy.

But when I plug x= (5 +√5)/8≈0.9045 into f(f(x)), I don't get x≈0.9045.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Let me compute x= (5 +√5)/8≈(5 +2.236)/8≈7.236/8≈0.9045.

Compute f(x)=5x(1 -x)=5*0.9045*(1 -0.9045)=5*0.9045*0.0955≈5*0.086≈0.43.

Then, f(f(x))=5*0.43*(1 -0.43)=5*0.43*0.57≈5*0.245≈1.225.

Wait, but 1.225≠0.9045.

Thus, x= (5 +√5)/8 is not a solution for λ=5.

Wait, maybe my earlier conclusion was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps for λ=5, f(f(x))=x has solutions at x=0 and x=1/2, but also, x= (5 ±√5)/8, but when I plug in, they don't satisfy.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate f(f(x))=x for λ=5 again.

Wait, f(f(x))=5*(5x(1 -x))*(1 -5x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

5*(5x(1 -x))*(1 -5x(1 -x))=x.

Divide both sides by x≠0:

5*(5(1 -x))*(1 -5x +5x²)=1.

Compute (1 -x)(1 -5x +5x²)=1 -5x +5x² -x +5x² -5x³=1 -6x +10x² -5x³.

So, 5*(1 -6x +10x² -5x³)=1 ⇒5 -30x +50x² -25x³=1 ⇒-25x³ +50x² -30x +4=0.

Multiply by -1:

25x³ -50x² +30x -4=0.

Try rational roots: possible roots are x=1,2,4,1/5,2/5,4/5,1/2, etc.

Test x=1:25 -50 +30 -4=1≠0.

x=2:200 -200 +60 -4=56≠0.

x=4: too large.

x=1/5:25*(1/125) -50*(1/25) +30*(1/5) -4=0.2 -2 +6 -4=0.2≠0.

x=2/5:25*(8/125) -50*(4/25) +30*(2/5) -4=2 -8 +12 -4=2≠0.

x=1/2:25*(1/8) -50*(1/4) +30*(1/2) -4=3.125 -12.5 +15 -4=1.625≠0.

x=4/5:25*(64/125) -50*(16/25) +30*(4/5) -4=12.8 -32 +24 -4=0.8≠0.

x=1/4:25*(1/64) -50*(1/16) +30*(1/4) -4≈0.3906 -3.125 +7.5 -4≈0.7656≠0.

So, no rational roots. Thus, perhaps x=0 is a solution, but x=0 is a fixed point.

Thus, maybe for λ=5, f(f(x))=x only has x=0 as a solution, which is a fixed point.

But when I plugged in x=0 into f(f(x)), I get0.

Thus, for λ=5, f(f(x))=x only has x=0 as a solution, which is a fixed point.

Thus, perhaps my earlier conclusion was wrong; for λ>4, f(f(x))=x only has fixed points.

Wait, but let's test λ=6.

f(f(x))=6x(1 -x)*(1 -6x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:

6x(1 -x)*(1 -6x(1 -x))=x.

Assume x≠0, divide by x:

6*(1 -x)*(1 -6x(1 -x))=1.

Compute (1 -x)(1 -6x(1 -x))=1 -6x(1 -x) -x +6x²(1 -x)=1 -7x +6x² -6x² +6x³=1 -7x +0x² +6x³.

Thus, 6*(1 -7x +6x³)=1 ⇒6 -42x +36x³=1 ⇒36x³ -42x +5=0.

Try rational roots: possible roots x=1,5,1/2, etc.

x=1:36 -42 +5= -1≠0.

x=5:too large.

x=1/2:36*(1/8) -42*(1/2) +5=4.5 -21 +5= -11.5≠0.

x=1/3:36*(1/27) -42*(1/3) +5≈1.333 -14 +5≈-7.666≠0.

x=5/6:36*(125/216) -42*(5/6) +5≈18.75 -35 +5≈-11.25≠0.

x=1/4:36*(1/64) -42*(1/4) +5≈0.5625 -10.5 +5≈-4.9375≠0.

Thus, no rational roots.

Compute f(f(x)) at x=0:0. So, x=0 is a solution.

x=1: f(f(1))=6*1*0*(1 -6*1*0)=0≠1.

x=1/2: f(f(1/2))=6*(1/2)*(1 -1/2)*(1 -6*(1/2)*(1 -1/2))=6*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1 -3/2)=6*(1/4)*(-1/2)=6*(-1/8)= -3/4≠1/2.

Thus, x=1/2 is not a solution.

Thus, for λ=6, f(f(x))=x has only x=0 as a solution.

Therefore, perhaps for λ>4, f(f(x))=x only has x=0 as a solution, which is a fixed point.

Therefore, perhaps for λ>4, the equation f(f(x))=x only has the fixed point x=0.

Thus, for λ>4, the equation f(f(x))=x has only x=0 as a solution, which is a fixed point.

Therefore, the equation f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points only when λ ∈ [1,4].

But wait, for λ=4, we have fixed points at x=0 and x=1/2, and f(f(x))=x has solutions at x= (5 ±√5)/8, which are not fixed points.

Thus, for λ=4, f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points.

Wait, but when I plugged in x= (5 +√5)/8≈0.9045, I didn't get x back.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computation.

Let me recalculate f(f(x))=x for λ=4 at x=(5 +√5)/8.

x=(5 +√5)/8≈0.9045.

f(x)=4x(1 -x)=4*(0.9045)*(1 -0.9045)=4*0.9045*0.0955≈4*0.086≈0.344.

Then, f(f(x))=4*0.344*(1 -0.344)=4*0.344*0.656≈4*0.226≈0.904.

Thus, f(f(x))≈0.904≈x.

Therefore, x=(5 +√5)/8 is indeed a solution.

Thus, for λ=4, f(f(x))=x has solutions at x=0, x=1/2, and x=(5 ±√5)/8, which are not fixed points.

Thus, for λ=4, equation f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points.

Thus, for λ=4, equation f(f(x))=x has solutions at x=0, x=1/2, and x=(5 ±√5)/8.

Therefore, for λ=4, it's not that only fixed points are solutions; the equation f(f(x))=x also has other solutions.

Thus, for λ=4, f(f(x))=x has more solutions.

Therefore, perhaps the threshold is λ>4.

Wait, but for λ=5, we saw that f(f(x))=x only had x=0 as a solution.

Thus, perhaps for λ ∈ [1,4], equation f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points.

But wait, for λ=4, it does, but for λ=5, it doesn't.

So, perhaps the threshold is somewhere between 4 and5.

Wait, perhaps when λ=4, the fixed points coincide with the other solutions.

But for λ=5, fixed points are different.

Wait, let me check λ=4.5.

f(x)=4.5x(1 -x).

Compute fixed points: x=0 and x=(5 ±√(25 -72))/9=(5 ±√(-47))/9, which are complex.

Thus, no real fixed points.

Therefore, for λ=4.5, the fixed points are complex.

Thus, f(f(x))=x would have solutions at x=0 and x=1/2, and perhaps others, but not fixed points.

But since f(f(x))=x, and f(x)=4.5x(1 -x).

Compute f(f(x))=4.5*(4.5x(1 -x))*(1 -4.5x(1 -x)).

Set equal to x:4.5*(4.5x(1 -x))*(1 -4.5x(1 -x))=x.

Divide by x≠0:4.5*(4.5(1 -x))*(1 -4.5x(1 -x))=1.

Compute (1 -x)(1 -4.5x(1 -x))=1 -4.5x(1 -x) -x +4.5x²(1 -x)=1 -5.5x +4.5x² -4.5x² +4.5x³=1 -5.5x +0x² +4.5x³.

Thus, 4.5*(1 -5.5x +4.5x³)=1 ⇒4.5 -24.75x +20.25x³=1 ⇒20.25x³ -24.75x +3.5=0.

Multiply by 4:81x³ -99x +14=0.

Try rational roots: possible roots x=1,2,7,14,1/3, etc.

x=1:81 -99 +14= -4≠0.

x=1/3:81*(1/27) -99*(1/3) +14=3 -33 +14= -16≠0.

x=2/3:81*(8/27) -99*(2/3) +14=24 -66 +14= -28≠0.

x=7/9:81*(343/729) -99*(7/9) +14≈41.16 -77 +14≈-21.84≠0.

Thus, no rational roots.

Thus, perhaps x=0 is a solution.

Check x=0:0≠1.

Thus, perhaps no real solutions.

Thus, for λ=4.5, f(f(x))=x only has x=0 as a solution.

Thus, for λ=4, f(f(x))=x has solutions x=0, x=1/2, and x=(5 ±√5)/8.

For λ=4.5, f(f(x))=x only has x=0.

Thus, the critical value is somewhere between 4 and4.5.

Wait, but for λ=4, f(f(x))=x has x=0, x=1/2, and x=(5 ±√5)/8.

For λ=4.5, f(f(x))=x only has x=0.

Thus, the threshold is between 4 and4.5.

Wait, perhaps at λ=4, x= (5 ±√5)/8 are solutions; for λ>4, perhaps they are not.

Thus, the critical value is λ=4.

Thus, for λ ∈ (4,5], f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points.

But for λ=4.5, it only has x=0 as a solution.

Thus, perhaps the threshold is λ=4.

Therefore, for λ ∈ [1,4], f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points; for λ>4, only x=0 is a solution.

But for λ=4, x= (5 ±√5)/8 and x=0,1/2 are solutions.

Thus, for the problem, we need to find λ ∈ [1,4] such that f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points.

Thus, the range of λ is [1,4].

But wait, earlier when I considered λ=4, f(f(x))=x has three solutions: x=0, x=1/2, and x=(5 ±√5)/8.

But when I tried λ=5, f(f(x))=x only had x=0 as a solution.

Thus, for λ ∈ [1,4], equation f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points.

Thus, the range of λ is [1,4].

But in the problem statement, when they ask for the range of λ, it's possible that λ is greater than 4, but the problem might have different expectation.

But based on the computations, for λ ∈ [1,4], the equation f(f(x))=x has solutions other than fixed points.

Hence, the range of λ is [1,4].

But let me check once more for λ=4, whether f(f(x))=x has solutions at x=(5 ±√5)/8.

As above, f(f(x))=x for λ=4 is satisfied at x=(5 ±√5)/8.

Thus, x=(5 +√5)/8 is a solution, not fixed point.

Therefore, for λ=4, equation f(f(x))=x has solutions at x=(5 ±√5)/8, which are not fixed points.

Thus, for λ=4, it's valid.

Therefore, the range of λ is [1,4].

Thus, the answer is λ ∈ [1,4].

Therefore, the range of λ is [1,4].

**Final Answer**
The range of values for λ is \boxed{[1, 4]}.
</think>

To determine the range of values for \(\lambda\) such that there exists a real number \(x\) different from a fixed point for which \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

1. **Fixed Points**:
   - Fixed points are solutions to \(f(x) = x\), which gives \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\).

2. **Equation for \(f(f(x)) = x\)**:
   - We need to solve \(f(f(x)) = x\). This translates to solving:
     \[
     \lambda \left( \lambda x (1 - x) \right) \left( 1 - \lambda x (1 - x) \right) = x
     \]
     Simplifying this, we get a complex polynomial equation.

3. **Behavior of \(f(f(x))\)**:
   - For \(\lambda \leq 1\), \(f(f(x))\) is a quadratic function, which is either always increasing or decreasing, and thus can only intersect the line \(y = x\) at most once.
   - For \(1 < \lambda < 4\), \(f(f(x))\) is a degree 8 polynomial, which can have multiple intersections with \(y = x\).
   - For \(\lambda \geq 4\), \(f(f(x))\) becomes a quadratic function again, but the fixed points coincide with the solutions of \(f(x) = x\).

4. **Critical Value Analysis**:
   - For \(\lambda \in [1, 4]\), \(f(f(x)) = x\) can have solutions other than the fixed points \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\).
   - For \(\lambda > 4\), \(f(f(x)) = x\) only has the fixed point \(x = 0\).

5. **Verification**:
   - For \(\lambda = 4\), the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\) has solutions at \(x = 0\), \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{5}}{8}\).
   - For \(\lambda = 5\), the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\) only has \(x = 0\) as a solution.

Thus, the range of values for \(\lambda\) such that there exists a real number \(x\) different from a fixed point for which \(f(f(x)) = x\) is \(\boxed{[1, 4]}\).
