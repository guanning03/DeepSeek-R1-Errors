Question:
Suppose the polynomial
$$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$has integer coefficients, and its roots are distinct integers.

Given that $a_n=2$ and $a_0=66$, what is the least possible value of $|a_{n-1}|$?

Correct Answer:
Since $f(x)$ has integer coefficients, the Integer Root Theorem tells us that all integer roots of $f(x)$ must divide the constant term $66=2\cdot 3\cdot 11$. Thus, the possible integer roots of $f(x)$ are
$$\pm 1,~\pm 2,~\pm 3,~\pm 6,~\pm 11,~\pm 22,~\pm 33,~\pm 66.$$Moreover, since we know that all roots of $f(x)$ are integers, we know that all roots of $f(x)$ appear in the list above.

Now we apply Vieta's formulas. The product of the roots of $f(x)$ is $(-1)^n\cdot\frac{a_0}{a_n}$, which is $33$ or $-33$. Also, the sum of the roots is $-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}=-\frac{a_{n-1}}2$. Thus, in order to minimize $|a_{n-1}|$, we should make the absolute value of the sum of the roots as small as possible, working under the constraint that the product of the roots must be $33$ or $-33$.

We now consider two cases.

Case 1 is that one of $33,-33$ is a root, in which case the only other possible roots are $\pm 1$. In this case, the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $32$.

The alternative, Case 2, is that one of $11,-11$ is a root and one of $3,-3$ is a root. Again, the only other possible roots are $\pm 1$, so the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $11-3-1=7$, which is better than the result of Case 1. If the absolute value of the sum of the roots is $7$, then $|a_{n-1}|=7|a_n|=7\cdot 2=14$.

Therefore, we have shown that $|a_{n-1}|\ge 14$, and we can check that equality is achieved by
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= 2(x+11)(x-3)(x-1) \\
&= 2x^3+14x^2-82x+66,
\end{align*}which has integer coefficients and integer roots. So the least possible value of $|a_{n-1}|$ is $\boxed{14}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this polynomial: f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0. They told me that the coefficients are integers, and all the roots are distinct integers. Also, a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66. I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some polynomial properties. If a polynomial has integer coefficients and all its roots are integers, then by the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root p/q must have p dividing the constant term and q dividing the leading coefficient. But since all roots are integers, q must be 1, so all roots are integers themselves.

Given that, the roots must be integers, and since the leading coefficient is 2, which is a prime number, I remember that the factors of the constant term will be related to the possible roots. Specifically, the roots must be divisors of 66 because a_0 is 66.

Wait, so the roots are divisors of 66. Let me list all the integer divisors of 66: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66. But since the roots are distinct integers, we can't repeat any of these.

Also, since a_n is 2, which is positive, and the constant term is positive 66, that tells me that the number of negative roots must be even. Because the product of all roots (up to sign) will be equal to a_0 / a_n, which is 66/2 = 33. So, the product of all roots is 33 or -33, depending on the number of negative roots. Since the number of negative roots is even, the product will be positive.

So, all roots are integers, distinct, and their product is 33 or -33. Therefore, the roots are a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33.

I need to find such a set of roots that will give me the minimal |a_{n-1}|. Remember that in a monic polynomial, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is equal to minus the sum of the roots. But in this case, the leading coefficient is 2, so I need to adjust accordingly.

Wait, let me think again. For a general polynomial with roots r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is - (sum of roots) if the polynomial is monic. But here, the polynomial is not monic—it's monic only if a_n=1. But here, a_n=2, so it's a bit different.

I think the relationship still holds: for a monic polynomial, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is minus the sum of the roots. But here, since it's scaled by 2, the coefficient of x^{n-1} would be -2 times the sum of the roots. Is that correct?

Let me verify. If I have a polynomial f(x) = a_n(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n), then when expanded, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is -a_n*(r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n). So yes, that formula holds. So in this case, a_n is 2, so the coefficient of x^{n-1} is -2*(sum of roots). So, a_{n-1} = -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|. So, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to minimize |sum of roots|.

Therefore, my task reduces to finding a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, and whose sum is as close to zero as possible, then take twice that sum as |a_{n-1}|.

So, I need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, and whose sum is as small as possible in absolute value.

Okay, let's see. First, note that 33 factors into primes as 3*11. So, the possible factors are ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33.

Similarly, -33 would have the same factors, just with some negatives.

But since the roots are distinct, I can have both positive and negative roots. So, maybe including both 1 and -1? Wait, but 1 and -1 are distinct, so that's allowed.

Wait, hold on. Let me think about the factors. The roots are divisors of 66, which is 2*3*11. So, the possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66.

But since the product is ±33, which is 3*11, or -1*3*11, etc.

But I need to have the product as 33 or -33 with all roots being distinct integers.

So, to get the product as 33, I can have roots like 1, -1, 3, -11, but wait, no, because 3 and 11 are primes. Let me try to think of possible combinations.

Wait, another approach: since 33 is 3*11, and -33 is -1*3*11. So, if we want to get the product as 33, maybe we can take roots 1, -1, 3, -11, but that's four roots. Let me check the product: 1*(-1)*3*(-11) = (1*-1)*(3*-11) = (-1)*(-33) = 33. So, that works.

So, in that case, the roots would be 1, -1, 3, -11. Then, the sum of the roots would be 1 -1 + 3 -11 = (1 -1) + (3 -11) = 0 + (-8) = -8. Then, |sum| is 8, so |a_{n-1}| is 2*8=16.

But is this the minimal? Maybe we can get a smaller sum.

Wait, maybe if we include more roots, we can have a smaller sum. For example, adding 2, -2, etc. But we have to make sure that all roots are distinct and their product is 33 or -33.

So, let's try to include more small roots. Suppose I take roots 1, -1, 3, -11, and also include 2 and -2. Then, the product would be 1*(-1)*3*(-11)*2*(-2) = (1*-1)*(3*-11)*(2*-2) = (-1)*(-33)*(-4) = (-1)*(-33) is 33, times (-4) is -132. But we need the product to be 33 or -33, so that's not correct.

So, including 2 and -2 would make the product too big in absolute value. Similarly, including 3 and -3 would make it 33*9=297, which is way too big.

Alternatively, maybe we can include a smaller number of roots. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps 33 can be factored as 1, -1, 3, -11, but that's four roots. Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, -11, 2, but then we have six roots, which would make the product 1*(-1)*3*(-11)*2 = 66, which is double of 33, so we need to adjust.

Wait, 66 is 2*3*11, but we need the product to be 33 or -33. So, 66 is double. So, if we divide one of the roots by 2, but then the roots have to remain integers.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Let me think again.

Alternatively, instead of trying to include all possible roots, maybe I can think of the number of roots, n, in terms of the degree of the polynomial. Since a_n is 2, and the leading coefficient is 2, the degree n must be such that 2 divides into the leading coefficient, but that's always true.

But maybe n is variable, so perhaps I can choose n as 4? Because 4 roots would give me the product as 33 or -33, which is manageable.

Wait, 33 is 3*11, so if I take roots 1, -1, 3, -11, that's four roots. Then, the sum is -8, as before, which gives |a_{n-1}|=16.

Is there a way to get a smaller |sum|?

Wait, let's think about other factorizations of 33 or -33 with fewer roots.

For example, 33 can be written as 1, -1, 3, -11, but that's four roots. Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, -11, 2, which is five roots, but that would make the product too big.

Wait, 33 is 3*11, so if I take roots 3, -3, 11, -11, that would make the product (3*-3)*(11*-11) = (-9)*(-121) = 1089, which is way bigger than 33. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, which is four roots. Let's compute the product: 1*(-1)*3*11 = -33, which is good. The sum is 1 -1 + 3 + 11 = 14. So, |sum| is 14, which is larger than 8.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, 2, but that's five roots, and product is 1*(-1)*3*11*2 = -66, which is -66. So, that's not 33 or -33.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, 2, 2, but wait, roots have to be distinct, so can't have duplicate 2s.

Wait, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, but that's four roots, product -33, sum 1 -1 + 3 + 11 = 14.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, 2, but then the product is -66, which is too big.

Wait, perhaps using 1, -1, 3, 11, and 66, but that's five roots. The product would be 1*(-1)*3*11*66 = -2178, which is too big.

Alternatively, maybe using 1, -1, 3, -11, 2, and -2. But that's six roots, product is 1*(-1)*3*(-11)*2*(-2) = (-1)*(-33)*(-4) = -132, which is not 33 or -33.

Hmm, so maybe four roots is the way to go. So, with four roots, 1, -1, 3, -11, that's four roots, product is 33, sum is -8, |sum| is 8, so |a_{n-1}| is 16.

Is there a way to get a smaller |sum|? Let's see. Maybe by including more roots? But more roots would make the product larger in absolute value.

Wait, for example, using 1, -1, 3, -11, 2, 2, but no, duplicates not allowed.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 2, -2, -33, but 33 is a larger number. Wait, let me calculate. 1, -1, 3, 2, -2, -33: six roots. Product is 1*(-1)*3*2*(-2)*(-33) = (-1)*3*2*(-2)*(-33). Let me compute step by step: 1*(-1) = -1, 3*2 = 6, 6*(-2) = -12, -12*(-33) = 396. So, the product is 396, which is too big.

Alternatively, maybe using 1, -1, 3, -11, 2, and -1, but that's duplicate -1.

Wait, this is getting messy. Maybe four roots is the minimal. Let me check another four roots.

What if I take 1, -1, 3, 11. Wait, that's sum 1 -1 + 3 + 11 = 14, as before, which is bigger than 8.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 2, -2. Then, the product is 1*(-1)*2*(-2) = 4, which is not 33 or -33.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11. That's four roots, product -33, sum is 14.

Wait, let's try 1, -1, 3, 11, but that's four roots. The sum is 14, which is not better than 8.

Wait, maybe instead of 1, -1, 3, 11, I can use 1, -1, 3, 11, but that's the same as before. Maybe another set.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 2, 33. Then, the product is 1*(-1)*2*33 = -66, which is not 33 or -33.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 2, 3, 11. Then, the product is 1*(-1)*2*3*11 = -66, same as above.

Wait, so perhaps four roots is indeed the minimal.

But let me think differently. Instead of taking as many small roots as possible, maybe including more roots that are 1 and -1 but balancing the sum.

Wait, for example, if we have 1, -1, 3, -11, that's four roots, sum is -8.

Alternatively, if I can have two pairs of roots that are inverses, so that their sum is zero. For example, 1 and -1, or 3 and -3, etc.

But if I have two pairs, say 1, -1, 3, -3, but then the product is 1*(-1)*3*(-3) = 9, which is not 33 or -33.

Wait, so maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 2, -2, but then product is 1*(-1)*2*(-2) = 4, which is not 33.

Wait, maybe 1, -1, 2, -3, which would be four roots. Product is 1*(-1)*2*(-3) = 6, not 33.

Wait, perhaps 1, -1, 3, -11, which is four roots, sum is -8. Maybe that's the minimal.

Alternatively, if I take five roots, maybe 1, -1, 3, -11, 2. Then, the product is 1*(-1)*3*(-11)*2 = 66, which is double 33. So, 66 is 2*33, so that's not 33 or -33.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, -11, 2, -2. That's six roots. Product is 1*(-1)*3*(-11)*2*(-2) = (-1)*(-33)*(-4) = -132, which is too big.

Wait, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, 2, -2, but that's six roots. The product is 1*(-1)*3*11*2*(-2) = (-1)*3*11*4 = -132, same as above.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and something else. But I can't think of a way to get the product to 33 or -33 without including more roots.

So, maybe four roots is the minimal.

But wait, let me think again. 33 can be written as 1, -1, 3, -11. So sum is -8, which is good.

But perhaps, if I can write 33 as a product of more numbers, maybe 1, -1, 3, -11, 2, -2, but then the product is 1*(-1)*3*(-11)*2*(-2) = (-1)*(-33)*(-4) = -132, which is too big.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, 2, -2, but that's too many roots.

Alternatively, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, 2, but that's five roots, and product is 1*(-1)*3*11*2 = -66, which is double.

Wait, but 66 is double of 33, so that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, and 66, but that's six roots, and product is 1*(-1)*3*11*66 = -2178, which is too big.

So, perhaps four roots is the minimal.

But let me check another way. Maybe using 1, -1, 3, -11, but that's four roots, product 33, sum -8.

Alternatively, if I can have more roots, but their product is 33 or -33, but with the sum being smaller.

Wait, another idea: instead of having 1, -1, 3, -11, maybe I can include 2 and -2. But then, the product would be 1*(-1)*3*(-11)*2*(-2) = (-1)*3*11*4 = -132, which is too big. So, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, and then another root which is 1, but that would duplicate. So, can't do that.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and then a root of 66, but that would make the product too big.

Wait, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and then a root of 66, but that's five roots, product is 1*(-1)*3*11*66 = -2178, which is too big.

Alternatively, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and then a root of 1, but that duplicates.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and a root of -1, but then duplicate -1.

Wait, so maybe four roots is the only way to get the product 33 or -33 without having more roots that make the product too big.

Alternatively, maybe including 66 as a root, but that would require other roots to compensate. Wait, for example, if I have 1, -1, 3, 11, 2, 2, but again, duplicate 2s.

Wait, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and then a root of 2. Then, the product is 1*(-1)*3*11*2 = -66, which is double of 33, so not helpful.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and then a root of -2. Then, the product is 1*(-1)*3*11*(-2) = 66, which is double of 33.

Hmm, so that doesn't help.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and then a root of 66. Then, the product is 1*(-1)*3*11*66 = -2178, which is too big.

Alternatively, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and then a root of something else, but I don't think that's helpful.

So, maybe four roots is the minimal.

Wait, but hold on. Maybe I can have roots that are 1, -1, 3, and something else. Let me see.

Wait, suppose I take roots 1, -1, 3, and 11. Then, product is 1*(-1)*3*11 = -33, sum is 1 -1 + 3 + 11 = 14, which is worse than 8.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, and -3. Then, the product is 1*(-1)*3*(-3) = 9, which is not 33.

Wait, maybe 1, -1, 2, and -2. Then, the product is 1*(-1)*2*(-2) = 4, which is not 33.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 2, and 3. Then, the product is 1*(-1)*2*3 = -6, which is not 33.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 2, and 6. Then, product is 1*(-1)*2*6 = -12, which is not 33.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 2, and 33. Then, product is 1*(-1)*2*33 = -66, which is double.

Wait, maybe 1, -1, 3, and 11, which gives us 1*(-1)*3*11 = -33, sum is -8, which is good.

Alternatively, is there a way to get a smaller sum?

Wait, perhaps by not using 1 and -1.

Wait, if I take roots 3, -3, 11, -11, which are four roots, but their product is (3*-3)*(11*-11) = (-9)*(-121) = 1089, which is way too big.

Alternatively, 3, -3, 11, 2, -2, which is six roots, product is (3*-3)*(11*-2)*(2*-2) = (-9)*(-22)*(-4) = (-9)*(88) = -792, which is still too big.

Alternatively, 3, -3, 11, 2, -2, -2, but that's duplicate.

Wait, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, 2, but that's five roots.

Wait, 1, -1, 3, 11, 2: product is 1*(-1)*3*11*2 = -66, which is double.

Wait, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 66, but then the product is too big.

Alternatively, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, and 2, but that's five roots, with product -66.

So, perhaps four roots is the minimal.

Alternatively, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, and 2, but that is five roots, but product is -66.

Wait, but 66 is not 33 or -33.

Wait, another thought: maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, and something else, but that seems not helpful.

Wait, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 66, but that's too big.

So, I think four roots is the minimal.

Wait, but let me think again.

Suppose I take the roots 1, -1, 3, 11, which gives me a sum of -8 and a product of 33. So, maybe that's the minimal.

But hold on, another idea: what if I have more roots, but with smaller absolute values? For example, using 1, -1, 2, -2, but that's four roots, but the product is 4, not 33.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, -3, but that's four roots, product 9, not 33.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, which is six roots, product is 36, which is not 33.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, 11, which is six roots, product is 1*(-1)*2*(-2)*3*11 = (-1)*(-4)*3*11 = 4*33 = 132, which is double.

Hmm, so that's not helpful.

Wait, another approach: Since 33 is 3*11, and 1 is a divisor, maybe we can have a root at 1, which is 1, and another at -1, which gives us a factor of (x -1)(x +1) = x^2 -1.

Then, we have 33 divided by 1 is 33, so maybe 33 is split into two numbers whose product is 33. So, 3 and 11, or -3 and -11.

So, that gives us (x^2 -1)(x -3)(x +11) or (x^2 -1)(x +3)(x -11).

Wait, let me try that.

Let me write f(x) = (x^2 -1)(x -3)(x +11). Let's expand this.

First, multiply (x^2 -1)(x -3):

= x^3 -3x^2 -x +3.

Then, multiply by (x +11):

= (x^3 -3x^2 -x +3)(x +11).

Let me do the multiplication step by step:

First, x^3 * (x +11) = x^4 +11x^3.

Then, -3x^2 * (x +11) = -3x^3 -33x^2.

Then, -x * (x +11) = -x^2 -11x.

Then, 3 * (x +11) = 3x +33.

Now, combine all these terms:

x^4 +11x^3 -3x^3 -33x^2 -x^2 -11x +3x +33.

Combine like terms:

x^4 + (11x^3 -3x^3) + (-33x^2 -x^2) + (-11x +3x) +33.

So,

x^4 +8x^3 -34x^2 -8x +33.

So, in this case, the polynomial is x^4 +8x^3 -34x^2 -8x +33.

So, the sum of the roots is -8, which matches our earlier calculation. So, a_{n-1} is -8, so |a_{n-1}| is 8.

But wait, is this the minimal possible?

Alternatively, let me try with the other factor (x^2 -1)(x +3)(x -11).

Let me multiply (x^2 -1)(x +3):

= x^3 +3x^2 -x -3.

Then, multiply by (x -11):

= (x^3 +3x^2 -x -3)(x -11).

Multiply term by term:

x^3*(x -11) = x^4 -11x^3.

3x^2*(x -11) = 3x^3 -33x^2.

-x*(x -11) = -x^2 +11x.

-3*(x -11) = -3x +33.

Combine all terms:

x^4 -11x^3 +3x^3 -33x^2 -x^2 +11x -3x +33.

Combine like terms:

x^4 + (-11x^3 +3x^3) + (-33x^2 -x^2) + (11x -3x) +33.

So,

x^4 -8x^3 -34x^2 +8x +33.

So, this polynomial is x^4 -8x^3 -34x^2 +8x +33.

In this case, the sum of the roots is 8, so |a_{n-1}| is 8 as well.

So, whether we take the positive or negative factors, we get the same |a_{n-1}| value.

But wait, is this the minimal?

Wait, is there a way to get a smaller |sum|?

Wait, perhaps by having more roots, but not necessarily 4. Let me think.

Wait, for example, could we have 6 roots whose product is 33 or -33, with a smaller sum?

Wait, let's try.

Suppose we have 1, -1, 3, 11, 2, -2.

Then, the product is 1*(-1)*3*11*2*(-2) = (-1)*3*11*4 = -132, which is not 33 or -33.

Hmm, so that's no good.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, 2, -3, but that's seven roots.

Product is 1*(-1)*3*11*2*(-3) = (-1)*3*11*6 = -198, which is too big.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, 2, -66, but that's too many and product is way too big.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, 2, 2, but that duplicates 2.

So, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, 2, -2, -33, but that's seven roots, product is 1*(-1)*3*11*2*(-2)*(-33) = (-1)*3*11*4*33 = a big negative number.

So, no luck.

Alternatively, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, 2, -66, but that's six roots, product is 1*(-1)*3*11*2*(-66) = (-1)*3*11*132 = -4296, which is too big.

So, seems like adding more roots is making the product too big.

Wait, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, and something else.

Wait, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and 2, but that's five roots, product is 1*(-1)*3*11*2 = -66, which is double.

Wait, so if I have four roots, the product is 33, that's good.

Alternatively, if I have four roots, the product is -33, which is also good.

But in both cases, the sum is either -8 or 8.

So, |a_{n-1}| is 8 in both cases.

But wait, let me check another case where we have more roots, but the sum is smaller.

Wait, for example, if I have 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11, but that's six roots, and the product is 9, which is not 33 or -33.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, 2, but that's seven roots, product is 1*(-1)*3*(-3)*11*2 = (-1)*(-9)*22 = 198, which is too big.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, 2, 2, but that duplicates.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, 2, -2, which is seven roots, product is 1*(-1)*3*(-3)*11*2*(-2) = (-1)*(-9)*(-44) = -396, too big.

So, seems like I can't get a smaller sum.

Wait, another idea: perhaps using fractions? But no, the problem says all roots are distinct integers, so we can't have fractions.

So, seems like the minimal |a_{n-1}| is 8.

But wait, let me verify.

I had the polynomial f(x) = (x^2 -1)(x^2 -3x -11)(x -11). Wait, no, in the first case, I had (x^2 -1)(x -3)(x +11). So, that gives four roots, and sum is -8.

But wait, is that the minimal? Let me see if we can have three roots.

Wait, 33 can be written as 1*3*11, but that's only three roots. So, 1, -1, 3, and 11. Wait, no, that's four roots.

Wait, wait, if I have three roots: 1, -1, and 33. Then, their product is -33. So, that's three roots. Then, the polynomial is (x -1)(x +1)(x -33) = (x^2 -1)(x -33) = x^3 -33x^2 -x +33.

So, in this case, the coefficient a_{n-1} is -33, so |a_{n-1}| is 33, which is worse than 8.

Alternatively, if I have three roots: 1, -1, 3, and -33. But that's four roots. Wait, no, 1, -1, 3, -33 is four roots.

Wait, no, 1, -1, 3, -33 is four roots, product is 9, not 33.

Wait, so, to get the product 33 or -33, with three roots, we need 1, -1, and 33, but that's three roots with product -33. Then, the polynomial is x^3 -33x^2 -x +33, which has a_{n-1} = -33, so |a_{n-1}| is 33, which is worse.

Alternatively, with four roots: 1, -1, 3, 11. Product is -33, which gives us a_{n-1} = 8. So, that's better.

Alternatively, four roots: 1, -1, 3, -11. Product is 33, which gives a_{n-1} = -8, so |a_{n-1}| is 8. So, same as before.

So, seems like 8 is the minimal.

But just to make sure, let me see if I can have a different set of roots with the same product 33 or -33, but with a smaller sum.

Wait, another idea: 1, -1, 3, 11, and another root. But that would make the product too big.

Wait, perhaps 1, -1, 3, 11, and another root that's 1, but then duplicates.

Wait, no, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and another root that's a divisor of 33. Wait, but 33 is 3*11. So, maybe 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1, but that duplicates.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, and 1. But then duplicates.

Wait, so in any case, adding more roots beyond four seems to make the product too big, so four roots is the minimal.

Therefore, the minimal |a_{n-1}| is 8.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a way to have the roots as 1, -1, 3, 11, and another root of, say, 33 or something? But then, product would be too big.

Wait, for example, 1, -1, 3, 11, 33. Then, product is 1*(-1)*3*11*33 = -1089, which is too big.

Alternatively, 1, -1, 3, 11, 1/3. But no, roots must be integers.

So, no, can't do that.

So, seems like four roots is the minimal.

Therefore, the minimal |a_{n-1}| is 8.

Hence, the answer is 8.

**Final Answer**
The least possible value of \(|a_{n-1}|\) is \(\boxed{8}\).

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \) with integer coefficients, where \( a_n = 2 \) and \( a_0 = 66 \), we need to find the least possible value of \( |a_{n-1}| \).

Since the polynomial has integer roots, the roots must be divisors of 66. The polynomial can be factored as \( (x - r_1)(x - r_2) \cdots (x - r_n) \), where \( r_i \) are the roots. The constant term \( a_0 \) is the product of the roots multiplied by \( (-1)^n \), which is 66. Therefore, the product of the roots is \( 33 \) or \( -33 \) depending on the parity of \( n \).

To minimize \( |a_{n-1}| \), we need to find a set of roots whose product is 33 or -33 and whose sum is as small as possible. The roots must be distinct integers.

Considering the roots 1, -1, 3, and 11, their product is 33 and their sum is \( 1 - 1 + 3 + 11 = 14 \), giving \( |a_{n-1}| = 14 \).

However, we can also consider the roots 1, -1, 3, and -11. Their product is -33 and their sum is \( 1 - 1 + 3 - 11 = -8 \), giving \( |a_{n-1}| = 8 \).

Another set of roots 1, -1, 3, and 11 gives the same result with a sum of 14, but the other set gives a smaller sum.

Thus, the least possible value of \( |a_{n-1}| \) is \(\boxed{8}\).
