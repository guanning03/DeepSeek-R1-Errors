Correct Answer:
Since $PT$ and $RQ$ are parallel, then $2x^\circ=128^\circ,$ so $x=64,$ so $\angle TPQ=64^\circ.$

Since $PT$ and $QR$ are parallel, then $\angle TPQ$ and $\angle PQR$ are supplementary. Thus, $\angle PQR + 64^\circ = 180^\circ,$ so $\angle PQR = \boxed{116} \text{ degrees}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, let's see. I have this diagram with points P, Q, R, T, and some angles labeled. PT is parallel to QR, and I need to find the measure of angle PQR. Hmm, okay, let's try to visualize it.

First, looking at the Asymptote code, I can see that it's drawing some lines. The main lines are from (0,0) to (10,0), which is drawn with both arrows, so that's probably the base line QR. Then from (10,0) to (20,0), which is another line, so that's the line RT. Then there are some lines from (0,0) to (-7,10) and (7,10), so that must be line PQ. Then from (-5,10) to (7,10), which is another line, labeled as QR, but wait, QR was already drawn. Maybe it's a different line? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to sketch a rough diagram on paper. So, points Q, R, T are on a straight line, going from left to right. Q is at the left, R is in the middle, and T is on the right. Then, from Q, there's a line PQ going up to point P, which is above Q. Then from Q, another line QR going to R, which is on the same line as QT. Then, from Q, there's another line connecting to somewhere, but actually, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing from (-7,10) to (7,10), which is probably connecting Q to P? Wait, no, (-7,10) is above (-7,0), which is above Q, so maybe PQ is a line from Q to P above Q. Then, from somewhere else, it's drawing lines to T and R.

Wait, maybe it's better to just note the labels. The Asymptote code labels an angle at P as x°, at T as 2x°, at R as 128°, and angle PQR is what we're supposed to find. So, angle PQR is at point Q between PQ and QR.

Given that PT is parallel to QR, so PT || QR. So, PT and QR are two parallel lines. So, PQ is a transversal cutting across them. So, maybe we can use some properties of parallel lines and transversals here.

I remember that when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal, and alternate interior angles are equal. So, maybe angle at P and angle at T are corresponding angles?

Wait, let's think. PT is parallel to QR, and PQ is the transversal. So, angle at P... Wait, point P is connected to Q and T. So, PQ is connected to Q, which is connected to R. So, if PT is parallel to QR, then PQ is a transversal intersecting both PT and QR.

So, angle at Q on PT is x°, angle at Q on QR is 2x°. Since PT || QR, the corresponding angles should be equal. So, angle at P (which is x°) corresponds to angle at T (which is 2x°). Wait, so x = 2x? That would mean x = 0°, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I got the corresponding angles wrong.

Alternatively, maybe alternate interior angles. So, when a transversal crosses two parallel lines, alternate interior angles are equal. So, if angle at P is x°, then the alternate interior angle at T would be equal to x°, but in the diagram, angle at T is labeled as 2x°. Hmm, that doesn't add up either.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the diagram more carefully. Since PT is parallel to QR, and PQ is the transversal, then the angle at P (x°) and the angle at T (2x°) are corresponding angles. If PT is parallel to QR, then yes, corresponding angles are equal, so x = 2x. But that would mean x = 0°, which can't be. So, maybe I need to consider another pair of angles.

Alternatively, maybe it's not x° and 2x°, but some other pair. Wait, perhaps angle at Q is involved. Hmm, angle PQR is at point Q between PQ and QR. So, angle PQR is our desired angle.

Wait, if PT is parallel to QR, and PQ is the transversal, then maybe the angles formed by the transversal with the parallel lines are related. Specifically, the consecutive interior angles (same-side interior angles) add up to 180°. So, maybe angle at T (2x°) and angle at Q (angle PQR) add up to 180°, because they are same-side interior angles.

So, if angle at T is 2x°, and angle at Q is something, and angle at R is 128°, then 2x + angle PQR = 180. But wait, angle at R is 128°, which is on the same line as QR. So, maybe that's another angle.

Wait, let's think about triangle PQR. Is that a triangle? Points P, Q, R. So, points P, Q, R are connected by lines PQ, QR, and PR. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing Q to P (-7,10) to (7,10), so that's PQ, and Q to R is at (0,0). Then, connecting (-7,10) to (7,10) is PQ, and QR is from (0,0) to (10,0). So, PR is from (-7,10) to (10,0). So, triangle PQR has points P, Q, R.

So, angle PQR is the angle at Q between PQ and QR. So, in triangle PQR, we have angle at Q, which is angle PQR. We need to find that.

But wait, PT is parallel to QR. So, PT || QR. And PQ is the transversal. So, the angles formed by PQ with PT and QR are related.

So, angle between PQ and PT is x°, angle between PQ and QR is 2x°, and angle between PT and QR is 128°, which is at point R.

Wait, when PT is parallel to QR, and PQ is the transversal, then the angle at PT (which is x°) and the angle at QR (which is 2x°) should be equal because they are corresponding angles. But that would mean x = 2x, which is not possible unless x = 0, which is impossible.

Alternatively, if angle x° is an alternate interior angle to 2x°, then x = 2x, which again is not possible. Hmm, maybe I need to consider the straight line angles.

Wait, the line from Q to R is straight, so the angle at R is 128°, which is on the same line as QR. So, maybe that 128° is an exterior angle related to the triangle or something.

Wait, hold on. Since PT is parallel to QR, and PQ is a transversal, then the angle between PQ and PT (which is x°) is equal to the angle between PQ and QR (which is 2x°). But as before, that would imply x = 2x, which is impossible. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe angle x° is not the corresponding angle, but another angle. Maybe angle x° is an alternate exterior angle to 2x°. Wait, no, because they are on different sides.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at T is 2x°, and the angle at Q is x°, but since they are on the same side of the transversal, maybe they are supplementary.

Wait, yes, if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then same-side interior angles are supplementary. So, angle at T (2x°) and angle at Q (x°) are same-side interior angles, so 2x + x = 180. So, 3x = 180, so x = 60°. Then, angle PQR is x°, which is 60°. Wait, but let me check.

So, if angle at T is 2x°, and angle at Q is x°, then yes, they are same-side interior angles, so they add up to 180°, so 2x + x = 180, so 3x = 180, so x = 60. Therefore, angle PQR is x°, which is 60°. But in the diagram, angle at R is 128°, which is given. Hmm, so maybe that's not directly relevant, but perhaps angle PQR is 60°, and angle at R is 128°, which is a different angle.

Wait, but in triangle PQR, the sum of angles should be 180°. If angle PQR is 60°, and angle at R is 128°, then the third angle at P would be 180 - 60 - 128 = -8°, which is impossible. So, that can't be.

Wait, that suggests that my assumption might be wrong. So, maybe angle x° is not same-side interior with angle 2x°, but instead, angle x° is an alternate interior angle.

Wait, if PT is parallel to QR, and PQ is the transversal, then angle at P (x°) and angle at T (2x°) would be alternate interior angles if PT is parallel to QR. So, if they are alternate interior, then x = 2x, which is impossible. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the angles. Perhaps angle at P is x°, and angle at T is 2x°, but they are corresponding angles, so x = 2x, which is not possible. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the angle at P is exterior to triangle PQR, and the angle at T is interior? I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's try to think of triangle PQR. Points P, Q, R. So, in triangle PQR, angle at Q is angle PQR, which is what we need to find. So, if we can find the other two angles, we can subtract from 180°.

But how does that help? Maybe we can relate angles at P and T through the parallel lines.

Wait, perhaps angle at P is equal to angle at T because of alternate interior angles? But if PT is parallel to QR, then when cut by PQ, the alternate interior angles would be angle at P and angle at T. So, angle at P (x°) equals angle at T (2x°). So, x = 2x, which is impossible. So, that can't be.

Wait, maybe angle at P is equal to angle at R? But angle at R is 128°, which is given, so that would mean x = 128°, which seems too big.

Alternatively, maybe triangle PQR is involved. Let me consider triangle PQR. If PT is parallel to QR, and PQ is a transversal, then maybe triangle PQR is similar to some other triangle?

Wait, but without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say. Maybe I need to think about the angles around point Q.

Wait, at point Q, we have angle PQR, which is angle between PQ and QR. Then, from point Q, another line goes to P, making angle at P as x°, and another line goes to T, making angle at T as 2x°, and then R is on the same line as QT.

Wait, maybe the angles at P and T are on the same side of the transversal, so they are same-side interior angles. So, if PT is parallel to QR, then same-side interior angles x° (at P) and 2x° (at T) should add up to 180°, so x + 2x = 180, so 3x = 180, so x = 60°. Then angle PQR is x°, which is 60°, but again, in triangle PQR, if angle PQR is 60°, angle at R is 128°, then angle at P would have to be 180 - 60 - 128 = -8°, which is impossible.

Hmm, so that can't be. So, maybe my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps angle x° is not same-side interior with angle 2x°, but instead, it's corresponding angles. So, angle at P (x°) corresponds to angle at T (2x°), so x = 2x, which is not possible. So, maybe angle x° is corresponding to angle at R? But angle at R is 128°, which is not equal to x° or 2x°, unless x° is 128°, which would make angle at T 256°, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe I need to consider triangle QRT. Since PT is parallel to QR, and Q is connected to both P and T, maybe some of the triangles formed are similar.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing Q to (0,0), which is connected to (-7,10) and (7,10), which is connected to T at (7,10). So, point P is (-7,10), Q is (0,0), R is (10,0), T is (7,10). So, the figure is a bit complex.

Wait, so from (0,0) to (-7,10) is PQ, from (0,0) to (7,10) is QR, from (7,10) to (10,0) is RT. So, the figure is a polygon with vertices at (-7,10), (0,0), (10,0), (7,10). So, that's a quadrilateral.

But the lines PT and QR are both drawn from (0,0) to (-7,10) and (7,10), respectively. So, PT connects (0,0) to (-7,10), and QR connects (0,0) to (7,10). So, both PT and QR are lines from Q to points below (to the left for PT and to the right for QR). So, PT is going to the left, QR is going to the right.

So, in this case, PT is parallel to QR. So, PT is a line from Q (0,0) to P (-7,10), and QR is a line from Q (0,0) to R (10,0). Wait, no, QR is drawn from (0,0) to (10,0), which is the same as the base line. Wait, but then PT is from (0,0) to (-7,10). So, is PT parallel to QR?

Wait, QR is the base line from (0,0) to (10,0). PT is from (0,0) to (-7,10). So, are these lines parallel? Let's see. The slope of QR is (0 - 0)/(10 - 0) = 0, so it's a horizontal line. The slope of PT is (10 - 0)/(-7 - 0) = 10 / (-7) ≈ -1.428. So, they are not parallel. So, maybe the diagram is different.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing Q to (0,0) to (-7,10) to (7,10) to (10,0), so that's Q connected to (0,0) connected to (-7,10) connected to (7,10) connected to (10,0). So, that's Q connected to (0,0), then to (-7,10), then to (7,10), then to (10,0). So, it's a polygon with vertices at (-7,10), (0,0), (10,0), (7,10). So, a quadrilateral.

Then, it's drawing (-5,10) connected to (7,10), so that's another line. Then, (-5,10) connected to (7,10) to (-7,10), forming a diamond shape. Then, it's drawing (-5,10) to (7,10), MidArrow, and label("$x^{\circ}$") at (-6,10), SW, so angle at (-5,10) is x°. Label("$2x^{\circ}$") at (7,10), SE, so angle at (7,10) is 2x°. Then, label("$128^{\circ}$") at (10,0), NE, so angle at (10,0) is 128°, and label("$P$", (-7,10), N), label("$T$",(7,10),N), label("$R$",(10,0),S), label("$Q$",(0,0),S).

So, in this diagram, Q is at (0,0), R is at (10,0), T is at (7,10), P is at (-7,10). So, PQ is from (-7,10) to (0,0), QR is from (0,0) to (10,0), PT is from (0,0) to (-7,10). So, PT is parallel to QR. So, PT is from (0,0) to (-7,10), QR is from (0,0) to (10,0). So, are PT and QR parallel? Let me calculate the slopes.

Slope of PT: (10 - 0)/(-7 - 0) = 10 / (-7) ≈ -1.428. Slope of QR: (0 - 0)/(10 - 0) = 0. So, they are not parallel. So, that contradicts the given. So, perhaps the Asymptote code is not to scale, or maybe the way the lines are drawn is different.

Wait, but the problem says PT is parallel to QR. So, perhaps the Asymptote code is illustrative but not exact. So, maybe I shouldn't rely on the coordinates. Instead, I should focus on the problem description.

So, PT is parallel to QR. PT is a line from P to T, QR is a line from Q to R. So, PT || QR. Then, we have triangle PQR, with angle PQR at Q, which is what we need to find. Angle at T is 2x°, angle at P is x°, angle at R is 128°, given.

Wait, maybe triangle PQT? Or triangle PQR?

Wait, angle at T is 2x°, angle at P is x°, angle at R is 128°. So, in triangle PQR, the sum of angles is 180°, so x + angle PQR + 128° = 180°. So, angle PQR = 180 - x - 128 = 52 - x. Hmm, but we also have angle at T as 2x°, which is an angle in triangle PQR.

Wait, but angle at T is 2x°, but in triangle PQR, angle at T is part of the triangle. Wait, maybe angle at T is exterior or interior.

Wait, in triangle PQR, angle at T is not part of the triangle. Wait, angle at T is at point T, which is connected to points P and R. So, in triangle PQR, angle at T is not one of the internal angles. So, maybe angle at T is an external angle.

Wait, perhaps angle at T is an external angle to triangle PQR. So, if angle at T is 2x°, and that's an external angle, then according to the external angle theorem, it's equal to the sum of the two opposite internal angles.

So, in triangle PQR, angle at T is 2x°, which is an external angle at vertex T. So, that should be equal to the sum of the internal angles at P and R. So, 2x = angle P + angle R. But angle P is x°, angle R is 128°, so 2x = x + 128. So, 2x - x = 128, so x = 128. Then, angle PQR is x°, which is 128°, but then in triangle PQR, the sum of angles would be 128 + 128 + 128 = 384, which is way more than 180. That can't be.

So, that can't be right. So, maybe angle at T is not an external angle, but something else.

Wait, maybe angle at T is part of the triangle? Wait, no, point T is connected to P and R, so in triangle PQR, point T is not a vertex. So, that might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since PT is parallel to QR, and PQ is a transversal, then the angle at P (x°) is equal to the angle at T (2x°) because they are alternate interior angles. So, x = 2x, which is not possible. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe angle at P is supplementary to angle at T, so x + 2x = 180, so 3x = 180, x = 60. Then, angle PQR is x°, which is 60°, but in triangle PQR, if angle PQR is 60°, angle at R is 128°, then angle at P is 180 - 60 - 128 = -8°, which is impossible.

Wait, so that can't be either.

Wait, maybe in triangle PQR, angle at P is x°, angle at Q is angle PQR, and angle at R is 128°, so x + angle PQR + 128 = 180. So, angle PQR = 52 - x. But then, angle at T is 2x°, which is an external angle at point T.

Wait, maybe angle at T is equal to angle PQR (which is 52 - x) because of some property.

But I don't know.

Alternatively, maybe triangle QRT is involved? Since PT is parallel to QR, and Q is connected to P and T, maybe there's a similar triangle.

Wait, in triangle PQR, PT is parallel to QR, so maybe triangle PQT is similar to triangle QRR? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe triangle PQT is similar to triangle QRR? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that since PT is parallel to QR, and PT is connected to P, which is connected to Q, which is connected to R, which is connected to T, then maybe the angles around point Q can be used.

Wait, at point Q, we have angle PQR, and angles from PT and QR. So, if PT is parallel to QR, then the angles formed by the transversal PQ should be related.

Wait, angle at T is 2x°, angle at P is x°, angle at R is 128°, angle at Q is x°, so in triangle PQR, the sum is x + 128 + angle PQR = 180. So, angle PQR = 52 - x. But in that case, angle PQR is 52 - x. But also, angle at T is 2x°, which is an external angle at point T, so maybe 2x = angle PQR + angle R. But angle R is 128°, so 2x = (52 - x) + 128. So, 2x = 180 - x, so 3x = 180, x = 60. So, then angle PQR is 52 - 60 = -8°, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be. Hmm.

Wait, maybe angle at T is equal to angle at P because of alternate interior angles. So, x = 2x, which is impossible, so that can't be.

Wait, maybe angle at P is equal to angle at R? But angle at R is 128°, so x would be 128°, which makes angle at Q as x°, which is 128°, but then the sum of angles in triangle PQR would be 128 + 128 + 128 = 384°, which is way over 180°. So, that can't be.

Wait, maybe angle at P is equal to angle at T. So, x = 2x, which is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe angle at P is supplementary to angle at T. So, x + 2x = 180, which gives x = 60°, then angle PQR is x°, which is 60°, but then in triangle PQR, angle PQR + angle P + angle R = 60 + 128 + something, but 60 + 128 is 188, which is too much.

Alternatively, maybe angle at P is equal to angle at R. So, x = 128°, which would make the angle at Q 180 - 128 - 128 = negative, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a key property here. Since PT is parallel to QR, and PQ is a transversal, then perhaps the angle between PQ and PT is equal to the angle between PQ and QR.

Wait, but that would mean x° = 2x°, which is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at P is equal to the angle at R because of alternate interior angles. So, x = 128°, but then angle at Q would be 180 - x - 128, which is 180 - 128 - 128 = -76°, which is impossible.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to use the fact that angle at T is 2x°, which is an external angle.

In triangle PQR, if angle at T is 2x°, which is an external angle at point T, then according to the external angle theorem, it's equal to the sum of the two opposite internal angles. So, angle at P plus angle at R equals external angle at T. So, angle P + angle R = 2x°.

So, angle P is x°, angle R is 128°, so x + 128 = 2x. Therefore, 128 = x. So, x = 128°. Then, angle at Q is angle PQR, which would be 180 - x - 128 = 180 - 128 - 128 = negative, which is impossible.

Wait, that's not possible. So, maybe my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe angle at T is not an external angle, but something else. If PT is parallel to QR, and PQ is a transversal, then maybe angle at P is equal to angle at R because of alternate interior angles. So, x = 128°, which would make angle at Q = 180 - 128 - 128 = -76°, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe the triangle is being considered in another way. Maybe angle PQR is 180 - 2x - 128.

Wait, let me think again.

Given that PT is parallel to QR, and PQ is a transversal, then the angle at P (x°) is equal to the angle at Q (angle PQR). Wait, no, not necessarily. Wait, alternate interior angles.

Wait, if PT is parallel to QR, then angle at P (x°) is equal to angle at Q (angle PQR). So, x = angle PQR. So, angle PQR is x°, which is what we need to find.

But then, in triangle PQR, the sum of angles is x + x + 128 = 180. So, 2x + 128 = 180, so 2x = 52, so x = 26°. So, angle PQR is 26°.

Wait, that seems plausible. Let me verify.

If PT is parallel to QR, then angle at P (x°) is equal to angle at Q (x°). Then, in triangle PQR, sum of angles is x + x + 128 = 180. So, 2x = 52, so x = 26°. Therefore, angle PQR is 26°.

But wait, let me make sure. If angle at P is x°, and PT || QR, so angle at P is equal to angle at Q. So, x = angle Q.

In triangle PQR, angle P + angle Q + angle R = 180.

So, x + x + 128 = 180.

Therefore, 2x = 52, so x = 26°. So, angle PQR is 26°.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, angle at T is 2x°, which would be 52°, and angle at P is x°, which is 26°, and angle at R is 128°, which adds up to 180°.

Wait, 26 + 26 + 128 = 180, yes.

But how does that relate to the angles at P and T? Because angle at T is 52°, which is given as 2x°, but if x° is angle P, which is 26°, then 2x° is 52°, which matches.

So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it shows angle at T as 2x°, which is 52°, which matches.

So, maybe the answer is 26°, but in the Asymptote code, angle at T is labeled as 2x°, which is 52°, so 2x = 52, so x = 26.

Wait, but in the problem statement, we are to find angle PQR, which is angle at Q, which we found as 26°, so that's the answer.

But let me double-check. If angle at P is 26°, angle at Q is 26°, and angle at R is 128°, then 26 + 26 + 128 = 180, which is correct. So, that seems to add up.

Alternatively, if angle at T is 2x°, and x is 26°, then angle at T is 52°, which is consistent with the triangle sum.

Therefore, I think angle PQR is 26°.

**Final Answer**
The measure of $\angle PQR$ is $\boxed{26}$ degrees.
</think>

Given that \(PT\) is parallel to \(QR\), we need to find the measure of \(\angle PQR\). The problem states that \(\angle PQR\) is labeled at point \(Q\) with \(x^\circ\), \(\angle PT\) is labeled as \(2x^\circ\) at point \(T\), and \(\angle R\) is labeled as \(128^\circ\).

1. Since \(PT \parallel QR\) and \(PQ\) is a transversal, we use the property of alternate interior angles. This implies that \(\angle P\) (which is \(x^\circ\)) is equal to \(\angle Q\) (which is \(\angle PQR\)).

2. In triangle \(PQR\), the sum of the angles is \(180^\circ\). We know:
   - \(\angle P = x^\circ\)
   - \(\angle R = 128^\circ\)
   - \(\angle Q = x^\circ\)

3. Using the angle sum property of a triangle:
   \[
   x + x + 128^\circ = 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   2x + 128^\circ = 180^\circ
   \]
   \[
   2x = 52^\circ
   \]
   \[
   x = 26^\circ
   \]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle PQR\) is \(\boxed{26}\) degrees.
