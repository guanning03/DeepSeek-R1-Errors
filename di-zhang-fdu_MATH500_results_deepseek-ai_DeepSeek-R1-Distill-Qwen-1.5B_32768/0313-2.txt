Question:
Bob and Alice each have a bag that contains one ball of each of the colors,  blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob then randomly selects one ball from his bag and  puts it into Alice's bag. What is the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same?

Correct Answer:
After Alice puts the ball into Bob's bag, his bag will contain six balls: two of one color and one of each of the other colors. After Bob selects a ball and places it into Alice's bag, the two bags will have the same contents if and only if Bob picked one of the two balls in his bag that are the same color. Because there are six balls in the bag when Bob makes his selection, the probability of selecting one of the same colored pair is $2/6=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I've got this probability problem here, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

First, Bob and Alice each have a bag with one ball of each color: blue, green, orange, red, and violet. So, each bag starts with five different colored balls. That means each bag has a unique set of colors, right? So, Bob has {blue, green, orange, red, violet}, and Alice also has the same exact set.

Now, the process goes like this: Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Then, Bob randomly selects one ball from his bag (which now has an extra ball from Alice) and puts it into Alice's bag. We need to find the probability that after this process, the contents of the two bags are the same.

Hmm, okay. So, after these operations, both bags should have the same set of colors, meaning they have exactly the same five balls. So, each bag must have each of the five colors. That implies that no matter what, Bob might have lost a ball and gained a new one, and the same for Alice. But in the end, they need to have the same set.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think about that. If Alice puts a ball from her bag into Bob's bag, Bob's bag will have an extra ball. Then, Bob puts a ball from his bag into Alice's bag. So, Alice's bag will have an extra ball as well. So, both bags will have two extra balls, which are the ones transferred.

So, for the bags to end up with the same contents, the two transferred balls must be the same as each other. Because if Alice sends a different color to Bob, and then Bob sends the same color back, then both bags would have the original four colors plus that one color. Similarly, if Alice sends the same color back, then both bags would have the original four colors plus that color as well. Wait, actually, that would mean the two bags end up with the same composition.

But, wait, let me write this down step by step.

First, let's denote the colors as B, G, O, R, V for simplicity.

Both bags start with B, G, O, R, V.

Let me denote the color that Alice selects and puts into Bob's bag as A. Then, after that, Bob selects a color from his bag, which now has A added, and puts it into Alice's bag as B.

So, after these operations, Bob's bag will have A and the original four colors, and Alice's bag will have B and the original four colors.

For the contents of both bags to be the same, the sets {B, G, O, R, V} and {A, B, G, O, R, V}? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, wait, hold on.

Wait, no. Wait, each bag only has five colors. Initially, each bag has five colors. After the first transfer, Alice puts one ball into Bob's bag, so Bob's bag becomes six balls, and Alice's bag becomes four balls. Then, Bob puts one ball into Alice's bag, so Bob's bag becomes five balls and Alice's bag becomes five balls again. So, both bags have five balls each.

So, the process is: Alice transfers one ball to Bob, making Bob's bag six, then Bob transfers one back, making both bags five each.

So, the critical point is that after these two transfers, both bags have five balls, and we need them to have the same five colors.

Therefore, let's break it down.

First, Alice selects a ball from her bag. The probability of her selecting any specific color is 1/5, since she has one of each color.

Suppose Alice selects color A. Then, Bob's bag will now have A added to his original five colors. So, Bob now has five original colors plus A.

Then, Bob selects a ball from his bag. The probability of him selecting any specific color is 1/6, since he now has six balls.

If Bob selects color B, then he adds it to Alice's bag, which now has four balls (original four plus A). So, Alice's bag now has four original colors plus A, and Bob's bag has four original colors plus A and B.

So, for the two bags to end up the same, the color A must be present in both bags, and Bob must have selected A in his second step. Because if Bob selects A, then both bags will have A, and their other colors must be the same.

Wait, but if Bob selects A, then Alice's bag will have four original colors plus A, and Bob's bag will have four original colors plus A and B. So, unless B is also one of the original colors, they won't be the same.

Wait, hold on. So, we need that after both transfers, both bags have the same five colors. So, the key is that the color that Alice added to Bob's bag must be the same as the color that Bob added back to Alice's bag.

Therefore, for the contents to be equal, the color Alice moved must be equal to the color Bob moved back.

Therefore, the probability is equal to the probability that the color A that Alice moves is equal to the color B that Bob moves.

So, the probability that A equals B, given that A is selected by Alice and B is selected by Bob from their respective bags.

Wait, but actually, it's more precise. Since Alice is choosing A uniformly at random from her five colors, and then Bob is choosing B uniformly at random from his six colors (which includes A and the original four). So, the probability that A and B are equal is the probability that Bob, upon selecting from his bag, selects A, which is 1/6.

But wait, no. Because Alice chooses A first, uniformly at random, and then Bob chooses B, uniformly at random from his six colors, which includes A. So, the probability that B equals A is 1/6, since there's only one A in Bob's bag.

But wait, but actually, is that correct? Or is it more involved?

Wait, no, because Alice's choice is A, which is one color, and then Bob's choice is from six colors, one of which is A. So, the probability that he picks A is 1/6.

But actually, if Bob had chosen A, then both bags would have the same set, because Alice added A to Bob's bag, and then Bob added A back to Alice's bag.

So, the probability that after the two transfers, the bags are equal is equal to the probability that Bob, upon selecting from his bag, selects the same color that Alice moved.

But since Alice's color is selected uniformly at random, the probability that Bob selects A is 1/6, regardless of what A is. Because after Alice chooses A, Bob has a 1/6 chance to select A.

Wait, so is the probability 1/6?

But that seems low. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should model this with considering all possible scenarios.

Let me consider all possible selections.

First, Alice picks a color A from her bag. There are 5 possible choices for A.

Then, Bob picks a color B from his bag, which now has 6 colors: his original 5 plus A. So, 6 possible choices for B.

We need that after both selections, the two bags have the same set of colors. So, for that to happen, the color A must be in Bob's bag, which it is, and the color B must be in Alice's bag, which it is, and all other colors in both bags must be the same.

Wait, but actually, since we started with the same set, after the transfers, the only way the bags are the same is if the color that Alice moved is equal to the color that Bob moved back.

So, the only way for both bags to be equal is if the color A that Alice moved is equal to the color B that Bob moved back.

Therefore, the probability is the probability that Bob picks A after Alice has already picked A.

But since Bob is selecting from his bag, which now has A, the probability that he picks A is 1/6. So, the probability is 1/6.

But hold on, but Alice could have chosen any color, so is this the same for all possible A?

Wait, yes, actually. Because regardless of which color Alice picks first, the probability that Bob picks the same color back is 1/6, since his bag now contains that color.

Therefore, the probability is 1/6.

But wait, is that the only condition? Because even if Alice picks a color, Bob has to pick that specific color for the bags to be equal.

So, in that case, the probability is 1/6.

But let me think of another way.

Alternatively, let's consider all possible pairs of A and B, with A being Alice's selection and B being Bob's selection. The total number of possible pairs is 5 (for A) multiplied by 6 (for B), so 30 possible outcomes.

Out of these 30, how many result in A = B?

Well, for each A, there is exactly one B that would make A = B, which is B = A. Since B is chosen from 6 colors, only one of them is A.

Therefore, for each A, there is one favorable outcome where B = A. So, 5 A's, each with 1 favorable B, so 5 favorable pairs.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 5, and total is 30, so the probability is 5/30 = 1/6.

So, same answer.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think again.

Wait, but actually, when Alice selects A, Bob is selecting from his bag, which has A and the original four colors. So, the probability that Bob selects A is 1/6, as before.

So, the probability is 1/6.

Hence, the answer is 1/6.

Wait, but just to make sure, let's consider a concrete example.

Suppose Alice picks blue (B). Then, Bob's bag now has B, G, O, R, V, and B. So, six balls.

Bob has to choose a ball. The probability that he chooses B is 1/6.

Therefore, in this case, the probability that after the transfers, the bags are equal is 1/6.

Similarly, if Alice picks green, the same happens. Bob has a 1/6 chance to pick green, and so on.

Since Alice picks a color uniformly at random, the probability is just the average of all these, which is still 1/6.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as a conditional probability.

Let me denote event E as the event that after the transfers, the bags are equal.

We need to compute P(E).

E occurs if and only if the color that Alice moved, A, is equal to the color that Bob moved, B.

So, P(E) = P(A = B).

Since A is selected uniformly at random from 5 colors, and B is selected uniformly at random from 6 colors (which now includes A), P(B = A) = 1/6.

Alternatively, we can think of the process as follows:

After Alice adds A to Bob's bag, Bob adds B to Alice's bag. For the bags to be equal, A and B must be the same color.

Therefore, the probability is equal to the probability that B equals A, which is 1/6, as B is selected uniformly at random from 6 colors, one of which is A.

Therefore, the probability is 1/6.

Wait, but before I settle on that, let me consider a slightly different approach. Maybe thinking in terms of permutations or something.

Alternatively, let's model the process step by step:

1. Alice selects a ball, say A, from her bag. The probability of selecting any particular A is 1/5.

2. Now, Bob's bag has 6 balls: his original 5 plus A.

3. Bob selects a ball, say B, from his bag. The probability of selecting any particular B is 1/6.

4. After this, Alice's bag has 4 balls: her original 4 plus A.

5. Bob's bag has 4 balls: his original 4 plus A and B.

We need the two bags to be equal. Therefore, the colors in Alice's bag (4 original plus A) must be exactly equal to the colors in Bob's bag (4 original plus A and B). So, the only way this can happen is if B is also one of Alice's original colors, which is not the case because B is a color that Bob could have added.

Wait, unless B is equal to A.

Wait, hold on. Wait, if Bob selects A, then Alice's bag will have A, and Bob's bag will have A, but Bob's bag originally had 4 colors, so adding A would make 5. Similarly, Alice's bag had 5, added A, making 6, but then Bob added A back, making Alice's bag 5 again.

So, the only way the bags are equal is if A and B are the same color. Therefore, for the bags to be equal, Bob must select the same color A that Alice added.

Thus, the probability is the probability that Bob selects A from his bag, which, after Alice's move, contains A and the 4 original colors, so 6 total. So, the probability is 1/6.

Therefore, the probability is 1/6.

Wait, but let me think again. What if Alice picks a color that Bob then picks? So, for example, Alice picks blue, Bob picks blue. Then, Alice's bag becomes blue and green, orange, red, violet, and Bob's bag becomes blue and green, orange, red, violet. So, they are equal.

Similarly, if Alice picks green, Bob picks green, the bags become equal.

So, yes, for each color that Alice picks, Bob has a 1/6 chance to pick that same color, making the bags equal.

Since Alice's choice is any of the five colors with equal probability, the overall probability is 1/6.

Hence, the probability is 1/6.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think about this process more carefully.

Suppose Alice picks a color A, say blue. Then Bob's bag now has blue and green, orange, red, violet.

Then Bob picks a color B from his bag. The probability that B is blue is 1/6.

If B is blue, then Alice's bag gets an additional blue, making it blue, green, orange, red, violet, which is the same as Bob's bag, which has blue, green, orange, red, violet.

If B is not blue, then Alice's bag has blue, green, orange, red, violet, and Bob's bag has blue, plus four other colors. So, they are different.

So, in this specific case where Alice picks blue, the probability that the bags are equal is 1/6.

Similarly, if Alice picks green, the same logic applies. The probability is 1/6.

Since Alice picks a color uniformly at random, the probability is 1/5, and for each such pick, the probability is 1/6, so overall, 1/5 * 1/6 = 1/30.

Wait, hold on, this is conflicting with my earlier conclusion.

Wait, so if I think of it as the probability over all possible scenarios, the total probability is the sum over all possible Alice's choices of (probability Alice picks that color) times (probability Bob picks the same color as Alice).

So, since Alice picks each color with probability 1/5, and for each color, the probability Bob picks it is 1/6, then the total probability is 5*(1/5)*(1/6) = 1/6.

Wait, no, that can't be, because for each color, the probability is 1/5 * 1/6, so 5*(1/5)*(1/6) is 1/6. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, using linearity of expectation, the probability is the sum over all possible A of P(A) * P(B=A|A). Since P(A) = 1/5, and P(B=A|A) = 1/6, so it's 5*(1/5)*(1/6) = 1/6.

Wait, actually, no, because for each specific color A, the probability that Bob picks A is 1/6, so for each A, the joint probability is (1/5)*(1/6). Therefore, the total probability is sum over A of (1/5)*(1/6) = 5*(1/5)*(1/6) = 1/6.

Therefore, the probability is 1/6.

Wait, but now I'm confused because initially, I thought it was 1/5 * 1/6, which would be 1/30, but that's not correct because Alice has to pick a color, and then Bob has to pick the same color.

But since Alice's choice is uniform, we have to take into account that for each color, the probability is 1/5, then for each such color, the probability that Bob picks it is 1/6, so the total is 5*(1/5)*(1/6) = 1/6.

Therefore, the probability is 1/6.

Wait, but let me think about it another way.

Suppose we consider all possible sequences of events.

First, Alice selects a color A, which can be any of the 5 colors. Then, Bob selects a color B, which can be any of the 6 colors in his bag (including A). Then, after these two steps, the bags are equal only if B = A.

So, the probability that the bags are equal is equal to the probability that Bob selects A after Alice's selection.

But since Alice's selection is independent, and Bob's selection is dependent on Alice's choice.

Wait, so the probability is equal to the expectation over Alice's choice of (probability Bob selects A after Alice's choice).

So, E[P(B=A)] = sum_{A} P(A) * P(B=A|A) = sum_{A} (1/5) * (1/6) = 5*(1/5)*(1/6) = 1/6.

Therefore, the probability is 1/6.

So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but now I'm questioning whether this is correct because in the first approach, I considered the number of favorable outcomes over total outcomes, which was 5/30 = 1/6.

Alternatively, thinking about it in terms of the process, the key is that Bob has to select the same color A that Alice added.

So, the probability that Bob selects A is 1/6, given that Alice has already selected A.

Since Alice's selection is uniform, the overall probability is 1/6.

Therefore, both ways of thinking lead to the same answer.

Wait, but let me test with a concrete example to see.

Suppose Alice picks blue. Bob then has to pick blue or another color. The probability that Bob picks blue is 1/6, so the probability that the bags are equal is 1/6.

Similarly, if Alice picks green, same thing. So, since Alice has 5 options, each with probability 1/5, the overall probability is 1/5 * 1/6 = 1/30 for each color. But wait, no, because for each color, it's 1/5 * 1/6, so 5*(1/5 * 1/6) = 1/6.

Wait, I think I messed up here. Because for each color, the probability is 1/5 * 1/6, but since there are 5 colors, it's 5*(1/5)*(1/6) = 1/6.

But in another way, if Alice picks a color, the probability that Bob picks the same color is 1/6, regardless of Alice's color. So, since Alice's color is chosen uniformly, the overall probability is 1/6.

So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if Alice picks a color, the probability that Bob picks that same color is 1/6, so since Alice's choice is uniform over 5, the probability is 1/5 * 1/6 = 1/30, but that seems wrong because when she picks a color, Bob's probability is 1/6, so 1/5 * 1/6 is 1/30, but since she has 5 choices, it's 5*(1/5)*(1/6) = 1/6.

Wait, no, that seems not. Because it's not 1/5 * 1/6 per color, but rather, for each color, 1/5 * 1/6, so 5*(1/5 * 1/6) is 1/6.

Wait, but 5*(1/5 * 1/6) is (5/5)*(1/6) = 1*(1/6) = 1/6. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a two-step process:

1. Alice picks A with probability 1/5.

2. Bob picks B with probability 1/6.

3. Then, check if A = B.

So, the overall probability is sum_{A} sum_{B} P(A) * P(B) * P(A=B | A,B).

But in this case, P(A) = 1/5, P(B) = 1/6, and P(A=B | A,B) is 1 if A=B, else 0.

So, the total probability is sum_{A} P(A) * P(B) * P(A=B | A,B) = sum_{A} P(A) * P(B) * (1 if A=B else 0).

Which is equal to sum_{A, B} P(A) * P(B) * δ_{A,B}, where δ_{A,B} is 1 if A=B, else 0.

So, that is equal to sum_{A} P(A) * P(A) = sum_{A} (1/5)^2 = 5*(1/25) = 1/5.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because 1/5 is the probability that A=B just by itself.

But that's not considering the second step where Bob adds a ball.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from how the process is modeled.

Let me think of the entire process.

First, Alice selects a ball from her bag. The probability that she selects any specific ball is 1/5.

Then, Bob selects a ball from his bag, which now has 6 balls (including the one Alice added). So, the probability that Bob selects the same color as Alice is 1/6.

But only if Alice has selected a particular color. Wait, no, Alice's selection is already fixed.

Wait, no, it's the probability that Bob selects the same color as Alice, given that Alice has selected a particular color. Since the color Alice selects is fixed, the probability that Bob selects that same color is 1/6.

Therefore, the total probability is 1/5 * 1/6 = 1/30.

But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 1/6.

Wait, now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps another approach is necessary.

Let me model this as a tree.

First, Alice has 5 choices, each with probability 1/5.

For each of Alice's choices, Bob has 6 choices, each with probability 1/6.

Therefore, the total probability space is 5 * 6 = 30 possible outcomes, each with probability (1/5)*(1/6) = 1/30.

Out of these 30, how many result in the bags being equal?

Well, for each color Alice picks, say color A, Bob has to pick color A to make the bags equal.

So, for each color A, there is exactly one outcome where Alice and Bob pick A, resulting in equal bags.

Since there are 5 colors, that gives 5 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the total probability is 5*(1/30) = 1/6.

So, 1/6 is the probability.

But wait, earlier I thought it was 1/5 * 1/6 = 1/30, but that's not correct because the favorable outcomes are 5, not 1.

So, each favorable outcome is 1/30, so total probability is 5*(1/30) = 1/6.

Therefore, the answer is 1/6.

Wait, now I'm convinced.

So, the confusion was whether the favorable outcomes are 1 or 5. Since for each color Alice picks, Bob has exactly one favorable choice (to pick that same color), so 5 favorable outcomes. Therefore, the total probability is 5*(1/5)*(1/6) = 1/6.

Therefore, the answer is 1/6.

Hence, the probability that after this process, the contents of the two bags are the same is 1/6.

**Final Answer**
The probability that the contents of the two bags are the same is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.
</think>

Bob and Alice each have a bag containing one ball of each color: blue, green, orange, red, and violet. 

1. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. This results in Bob's bag having 6 balls (his original 5 plus Alice's selected ball).
2. Bob then randomly selects one ball from his bag and puts it into Alice's bag. This results in both bags having 5 balls each.

For the contents of both bags to be the same, the color that Alice moved into Bob's bag must be the same as the color that Bob moved back into Alice's bag.

- Alice has 5 possible choices, each with a probability of \( \frac{1}{5} \).
- For each color Alice picks, the probability that Bob picks the same color is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

The total probability is calculated as follows:
- The probability that Alice picks any specific color is \( \frac{1}{5} \).
- The probability that Bob picks the same color as Alice is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
- The combined probability for each specific color is \( \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{30} \).

Since there are 5 possible colors, the total probability is:
\[ 5 \times \frac{1}{30} = \frac{1}{6} \]

Thus, the probability that the contents of the two bags are the same is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}\).
