Correct Answer:
$\triangle DBC$ has base $\overline{BC}$ of length 8 and height $\overline{BD}$ of length 3; therefore, its area is $\frac{1}{2}\times8\times 3=12$.

The area of quadrilateral $DBEF$ equals the area of $\triangle DBC$ minus the area of $\triangle FEC$.

$\triangle FEC$ has base $EC=BC-BE=8-4=4$. The height of $\triangle FEC$ is equal to the vertical distance from point $F$ to the $x$-axis, which is equal to the $y$-coordinate of point $F$, or 2. Therefore, the area of $\triangle FEC$ is $\frac{1}{2}\times4\times 2=4$.

Finally, the area of quadrilateral $DBEF$ is $12-4=\boxed{8}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out the area of quadrilateral DFEF... Wait, actually, the Asymptote code defines D and E as midpoints, and then draws lines from E to A, A to C, C to D. There's also a point F at (8/3, 2). The figure is drawn with arrows on the x and y axes. The question is about the area of quadrilateral DFEF... Hmm, wait, looking back, the Asymptote code says draw(E--A--C--D); and draw((-1,0)--(10,0), EndArrow); draw((0,-1)--(0,8), EndArrow); So, the quadrilateral is DFEF, but wait, DFEF is a quadrilateral with points D, F, E, D? Or is it D, F, E, and somewhere else? Wait, looking at the Asymptote code, F is the intersection point of EA and DC? Hmm, maybe I need to figure out where F is.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, they've defined F as (8/3, 2). So, perhaps the quadrilateral is DFE, but that's three points. Wait, maybe it's DFEF? Or is it DFE something else. Wait, let's see. The Asymptote code draws E--A--C--D; so that's E connected to A, A connected to C, C connected to D. Then, in the diagram, F is a point somewhere. Wait, in the Asymptote code, F is defined as (8/3, 2). So, perhaps the quadrilateral is D, F, E, and some other point? Wait, in the Asymptote code, F is plotted at (8/3, 2). Maybe the quadrilateral is D-F-E-something? Wait, hold on.

Wait, the problem says D and E are midpoints of AB and BC, respectively. So, in the diagram, D is at (0,3), E is at (4,0). Then, F is the intersection of EA and DC. So, EA is the line from E=(4,0) to A=(0,6), and DC is from D=(0,3) to C=(8,0). So, F is the intersection of EA and DC. So, quadrilateral DFEF... Wait, that seems like a four-sided figure with points D, F, E, and another point? Or maybe D, F, E, and another point? Wait, maybe the quadrilateral is DFEF... Wait, perhaps it's D-F-E-F? But that's three points. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn as E--A--C--D, so that's E connected to A, A to C, C to D. Then, F is another point, and the figure is drawn as (-1,0)--(10,0), which is the x-axis, and (0,-1)--(0,8), the y-axis. So, in the figure, it's a coordinate system with axes.

But wait, the problem says "quadrilateral DFEF", but in the Asymptote code, F is defined as (8/3, 2). So, perhaps the quadrilateral is D-F-E-F? Wait, but that would be D, F, E, F, which is a triangle with an extra point. Hmm, maybe it's D-F-E-D? That seems a quadrilateral.

Wait, maybe I need to re-examine how the figure is constructed. In the Asymptote code, they draw E--A--C--D, so that would be a polygon E-A-C-D-E? But then, they also draw the x-axis and y-axis, which is probably the coordinate system. So, point F is at (8/3, 2), which is approximately (2.666, 2). So, where is F connected? In the Asymptote code, is F connected to E and D? Or is F just a point in the diagram?

Wait, perhaps the quadrilateral is the area bounded by E, A, C, D, and F? But in that case, it's a pentagon. Hmm, maybe I need to figure out the exact coordinates of all these points.

Wait, let me list out all the coordinates again:

- A is at (0,6)
- B is at (0,0)
- C is at (8,0)
- D is the midpoint of AB, so since A is (0,6) and B is (0,0), the midpoint D is at (0,3)
- E is the midpoint of BC, so since B is (0,0) and C is (8,0), the midpoint E is at (4,0)
- F is the intersection point of EA and DC.

So, first, let's find the coordinates of F. So, to find F, which is the intersection of EA and DC.

First, let's find the equations of lines EA and DC.

Line EA connects E=(4,0) to A=(0,6). Let's find its equation.

The slope of EA is (6 - 0)/(0 - 4) = 6 / (-4) = -3/2. So, the equation is y - 0 = (-3/2)(x - 4), so y = (-3/2)x + 6.

Line DC connects D=(0,3) to C=(8,0). Let's find its equation.

The slope of DC is (0 - 3)/(8 - 0) = (-3)/8. So, the equation is y - 3 = (-3/8)(x - 0), so y = (-3/8)x + 3.

Now, to find point F where EA and DC intersect, solve the two equations:

y = (-3/2)x + 6

and

y = (-3/8)x + 3

Set them equal:

(-3/2)x + 6 = (-3/8)x + 3

Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:

-12x + 48 = -3x + 24

Bring all terms to one side:

-12x + 48 + 3x - 24 = 0

-9x + 24 = 0

-9x = -24

x = (-24)/(-9) = 8/3

Then, plug x = 8/3 into one of the equations, say y = (-3/8)x + 3:

y = (-3/8)(8/3) + 3 = (-24/24) + 3 = -1 + 3 = 2

So, point F is at (8/3, 2), which matches the Asymptote code.

So, now we have all the required points:

- D: (0,3)
- F: (8/3, 2)
- E: (4,0)
- Additionally, I need to figure out what else is needed to form quadrilateral DFEF. Wait, quadrilateral DFEF would have points D, F, E, and another point? Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says: Determine the area of quadrilateral DFEF. But in the Asymptote code, F is at (8/3, 2), so perhaps it's a quadrilateral with points D, F, E, and another point? Wait, maybe it's D, F, E, and another point, but I need to figure out where that fourth point is.

Wait, looking back at the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn as E--A--C--D, which is a polygon, and then F is plotted at (8/3, 2). So, maybe quadrilateral DFEF is formed by points D, F, E, and another point? Or perhaps it's D, F, E, and another point on DC or EA.

Wait, perhaps the quadrilateral is D-F-E-D? But that would just be triangle DFE, but the problem says quadrilateral DFEF, which is confusing.

Wait, maybe it's D-F-E and another point? Wait, the Asymptote code draws E--A--C--D, so that's E to A, A to C, C to D. Then, the figure is drawn with arrows on the axes, which are the x and y axes. So, perhaps quadrilateral DFEF is the area bounded by D, F, E, and another point? Wait, maybe F is a vertex, but I need to figure out the exact quadrilateral.

Wait, maybe the quadrilateral is D-F-E-E? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's D-F-E and another point, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the quadrilateral is D-F-E and another point? Wait, in the Asymptote code, F is plotted at (8/3, 2). Maybe the quadrilateral is D-F-E-F? But that's just a triangle with an extra point, which is redundant.

Wait, perhaps the quadrilateral is D-F-E-D, which would be a triangle. But the problem says quadrilateral, so maybe I need to consider another point.

Wait, perhaps the quadrilateral is D-F-E-C? Because from D to F to E to C? That would be a quadrilateral. Alternatively, D-F-E-D?

Wait, but according to the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn as E--A--C--D, so E to A, A to C, C to D. Then, F is an intersection of EA and DC, which is at (8/3, 2). So, perhaps the quadrilateral is D-F-E-C? Let me check.

So, points:

- D: (0,3)
- F: (8/3, 2)
- E: (4,0)
- C: (8,0)

So, connecting D to F, F to E, E to C, and C back to D. So, quadrilateral D-F-E-C.

Alternatively, is it D-F-E-D? No, that would be a triangle.

Wait, let's see. The Asymptote code also draws E--A--C--D, so E to A, A to C, C to D.

Additionally, it draws the axes, so maybe the figure is a polygon with vertices at D, F, E, and another point? Wait, if I connect D to F, F to E, E to C, and C back to D, that makes a quadrilateral. Alternatively, is there another intersection point?

Wait, in the Asymptote code, they also draw E--A--C--D, so that is the polygon E-A-C-D. Then, they also draw F as the intersection point, so maybe the quadrilateral is E-F-D-C? Hmm.

Wait, no, because the Asymptote code doesn't connect E to F or anything. So, maybe the quadrilateral is D-F-E-C. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the quadrilateral is D-F-E and another point. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to figure it out.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, after drawing E--A--C--D, they also draw (-1,0)--(10,0) and (0,-1)--(0,8), which are the x and y axes. So, in the coordinate system, the figure is plotted with axes, and the polygon is E--A--C--D. So, the points involved are E, A, C, D, but F is an intersection inside the figure.

So, to find quadrilateral DFEF, I think it's the polygon D-F-E-C.

So, the quadrilateral has vertices at D=(0,3), F=(8/3, 2), E=(4,0), and C=(8,0). So, connecting D to F, F to E, E to C, and C back to D.

Alternatively, it could be D-F-E-D, but that would just be triangle DFE.

Wait, perhaps it's D-F-E and another point? Wait, no, the Asymptote code says F is at (8/3, 2). So, perhaps the quadrilateral is D-F-E-C.

Wait, let me think about the figure.

From D=(0,3) to F=(8/3, 2): that's a line going from (0,3) to (8/3, 2). Then, from F=(8/3, 2) to E=(4,0): that's a line going from (8/3,2) to (4,0). Then, from E=(4,0) to C=(8,0): that's a line going along the x-axis. Then, from C=(8,0) back to D=(0,3): that's a line going from (8,0) to (0,3). So, the quadrilateral is a four-sided figure connecting these four points.

So, quadrilateral D-F-E-C.

Alternatively, it might be D-F-E-D, but that's just a triangle.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the area of quadrilateral D-F-E-C.

Alternatively, maybe it's D-F-E-A? But A is (0,6), which is above D.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the points I have and figure out the area.

So, quadrilateral D-F-E-C.

Let me list the coordinates:

1. D: (0, 3)
2. F: (8/3, 2)
3. E: (4, 0)
4. C: (8, 0)

So, it's a quadrilateral with these four points.

To find the area of quadrilateral D-F-E-C, I can use the shoelace formula.

Shoelace formula: For a polygon with vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn), the area is:

1/2 |sum from 1 to n of (xi*yi+1 - xi+1*yi)|, where xn+1 = x1, yn+1 = y1.

So, let's apply this.

First, list the coordinates in order:

1. D: (0, 3)
2. F: (8/3, 2)
3. E: (4, 0)
4. C: (8, 0)
5. Back to D: (0, 3)

So, set them up:

x: 0, 8/3, 4, 8, 0

y: 3, 2, 0, 0, 3

Now, apply the shoelace formula:

Compute sum of xi*yi+1:

(0*2) + (8/3*0) + (4*0) + (8*3) + (0*3)

= 0 + 0 + 0 + 24 + 0

= 24

Compute sum of yi*xi+1:

(3*(8/3)) + (2*4) + (0*8) + (0*0) + (3*0)

= (8) + (8) + (0) + (0) + (0)

= 16

So, the area is 1/2 |24 - 16| = 1/2 * 8 = 4.

Wait, so the area is 4? Hmm.

But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have messed up the coordinates.

Wait, so:

x: 0, 8/3, 4, 8, 0

y: 3, 2, 0, 0, 3

Compute sum of xi*yi+1:

First term: 0*2 = 0

Second term: (8/3)*0 = 0

Third term: 4*0 = 0

Fourth term: 8*3 = 24

Fifth term: 0*3 = 0

Total sum: 0 + 0 + 0 + 24 + 0 = 24

Compute sum of yi*xi+1:

First term: 3*(8/3) = 8

Second term: 2*4 = 8

Third term: 0*8 = 0

Fourth term: 0*0 = 0

Fifth term: 3*0 = 0

Total sum: 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 16

Difference: 24 - 16 = 8

Area: 1/2 * |8| = 4

So, the area is 4.

Wait, but let me think again. The entire figure is a trapezoid from (0,6) to (0,0) to (8,0) to (8,0) to (0,6). But wait, it's a rectangle? Wait, no, the base is from (0,0) to (8,0), which is 8 units, and the height is from y=0 to y=6, which is 6 units, so the area of the rectangle would be 8*6=48.

But our quadrilateral D-F-E-C is only part of it.

Wait, so if the shoelace formula gives 4, which is 1/12 of the total area, that seems plausible.

Wait, but let me try another method to verify.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates, maybe we can split the quadrilateral into triangles.

Quadrilateral D-F-E-C can be split into triangle D-F-E and triangle D-E-C.

Wait, no, that might not be accurate.

Wait, maybe split it into triangle D-F-E and trapezoid F-E-C-D? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, use vectors or determinants.

Wait, another way is to find the area using the coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps decompose the quadrilateral into simpler shapes.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates, perhaps using the shoelace formula is the most straightforward.

Wait, but let me verify with another approach.

Alternatively, think of the quadrilateral as a polygon with vertices (0,3), (8/3, 2), (4,0), (8,0). So, plotting these points, I can see that from D=(0,3) to F=(8/3,2) is a line going left and down, then from F to E=(4,0) is a line going right and down, then from E to C=(8,0) is a line going right, then from C back to D=(0,3) is a line going left and up.

So, this is a trapezoid? Wait, is it a trapezoid? A trapezoid has at least one pair of sides parallel.

Looking at the sides DF and EC: DF is from (0,3) to (8/3,2), and EC is from (4,0) to (8,0). Are these lines parallel? Let's check their slopes.

Slope of DF: (2 - 3)/(8/3 - 0) = (-1)/(8/3) = -3/8

Slope of EC: (0 - 0)/(8 - 4) = 0/4 = 0

So, the slopes are different, so they are not parallel.

What about sides DE and FC?

Wait, DE is from D=(0,3) to E=(4,0). Slope is (0-3)/(4 - 0) = -3/4

FC is from F=(8/3,2) to C=(8,0). Slope is (0 - 2)/(8 - 8/3) = (-2)/(16/3) = (-6)/16 = -3/8

So, slopes of DE and FC are -3/4 and -3/8, which are different, so they are not parallel.

So, the quadrilateral is not a trapezoid, so we can't use the trapezoid area formula.

So, shoelace formula is the way to go. I think that gave us 4, and that seems correct.

But to double-check, maybe use coordinates to compute the area as a polygon.

Alternatively, use vectors.

Alternatively, use the area formula for quadrilaterals.

Wait, another way is to find the area by subtracting areas.

We know the total area of the figure is 48, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but maybe not. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates, perhaps use the vector cross product method.

But the shoelace formula is straightforward.

Wait, another thought: the coordinates of the quadrilateral are (0,3), (8/3, 2), (4,0), (8,0). Let me plot these mentally.

- D is at the top left.
- F is somewhere in the lower left.
- E is at the bottom right.
- C is at the bottom right as well.

Wait, no, C is at (8,0). So, moving from D to F to E to C.

Wait, maybe the quadrilateral is a kite? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: divide the quadrilateral into two triangles: D-F-E and D-E-C.

Compute the area of each triangle and sum them.

First, triangle D-F-E.

Points:

D: (0,3)

F: (8/3, 2)

E: (4,0)

Compute the area using determinant formula:

Area = 1/2 | (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) |

Plugging in:

x1 = 0, y1 = 3

x2 = 8/3, y2 = 2

x3 = 4, y3 = 0

Area = 1/2 | 0*(2 - 0) + (8/3)*(0 - 3) + 4*(3 - 2) |

= 1/2 | 0 + (8/3)*(-3) + 4*(1) |

= 1/2 | 0 - 8 + 4 | = 1/2 | -4 | = 1/2 * 4 = 2

Second triangle: D-E-C.

Points:

D: (0,3)

E: (4,0)

C: (8,0)

Compute the area:

Using determinant formula:

Area = 1/2 | x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) |

Plugging in:

x1 = 0, y1 = 3

x2 = 4, y2 = 0

x3 = 8, y3 = 0

Area = 1/2 | 0*(0 - 0) + 4*(0 - 3) + 8*(3 - 0) |

= 1/2 | 0 + 4*(-3) + 8*3 |

= 1/2 | 0 -12 + 24 | = 1/2 |12| = 6

So, the area of triangle D-F-E is 2, and the area of triangle D-E-C is 6, so total area of quadrilateral D-F-E-C is 2 + 6 = 8.

Wait, wait, that contradicts the shoelace formula which gave 4. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the triangles.

Wait, the quadrilateral is D-F-E-C, so the two triangles are D-F-E and E-C-D.

Wait, no, in the shoelace formula, the order of the points is important. Maybe I split it into D-F-E and E-C-D, but that might not cover the whole quadrilateral.

Wait, let me try again.

Quadrilateral D-F-E-C.

If we split it into D-F-E and E-C-D.

Wait, compute area of D-F-E: 2

Compute area of E-C-D: triangle with points E=(4,0), C=(8,0), D=(0,3)

Compute area using determinant:

Area = 1/2 | x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) |

x1=4, y1=0

x2=8, y2=0

x3=0, y3=3

Area = 1/2 |4*(0 - 3) + 8*(3 - 0) + 0*(0 - 0)|

= 1/2 |4*(-3) + 8*3 + 0|

= 1/2 | -12 + 24 + 0 | = 1/2 |12| = 6

So, area of triangle E-C-D is 6.

Therefore, total area of quadrilateral D-F-E-C is 2 + 6 = 8.

Wait, that's different from shoelace formula. Hmm.

Wait, but when I did shoelace formula earlier, I got 4.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I have an error in the order of points.

In shoelace formula, the points must be ordered either clockwise or counterclockwise.

In my initial shoelace formula, I went D, F, E, C, D.

But let's check the order.

D=(0,3), F=(8/3, 2), E=(4,0), C=(8,0), D=(0,3)

Plotting this, it's a quadrilateral that goes from D to F to E to C back to D.

But according to the shoelace formula, that gives area 4.

But when I split into two triangles, I get 8.

This inconsistency is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I split the quadrilateral incorrectly.

Wait, maybe the quadrilateral is not convex or the points are not ordered correctly.

Wait, let me try to plot the points:

D=(0,3), F=(8/3, 2), E=(4,0), C=(8,0)

So, starting at D=(0,3), moving to F=(8/3, 2), which is to the right and down, then to E=(4,0), which is further to the right and down, then to C=(8,0), which is far to the right, and back to D=(0,3).

Wait, that seems like a non-convex quadrilateral, but actually, maybe it's convex.

Wait, perhaps I should use the shoelace formula correctly, with the points ordered.

Wait, in the shoelace formula, the order is important; if the points are ordered clockwise or counter-clockwise, the area is positive. If not, the area is negative.

Wait, in my initial shoelace calculation, I think I might have mixed up the order.

Wait, let me recompute the shoelace formula step by step.

List of points:

1. D: (0,3)
2. F: (8/3, 2)
3. E: (4, 0)
4. C: (8, 0)
5. Back to D: (0,3)

Compute sum of xi*yi+1:

(0)*(2) + (8/3)*(0) + (4)*(0) + (8)*(3) + (0)*(3)

= 0 + 0 + 0 + 24 + 0 = 24

Compute sum of yi*xi+1:

(3)*(8/3) + (2)*(4) + (0)*(8) + (0)*(0) + (3)*(0)

= 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 16

So, difference: 24 - 16 = 8

Area: 1/2 * |8| = 4

Wait, so that's correct, but why does splitting into two triangles give me 8?

Wait, maybe I have a mistake in the area of the triangle E-C-D.

Wait, let me recalculate:

Triangle E-C-D has points E=(4,0), C=(8,0), D=(0,3)

Compute area using determinant:

Area = 1/2 |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|

x1=4, y1=0

x2=8, y2=0

x3=0, y3=3

So,

4*(0 - 3) + 8*(3 - 0) + 0*(0 - 0)

= 4*(-3) + 8*3 + 0

= -12 + 24 + 0

= 12

Then, area is 1/2 * |12| = 6

So, that's correct.

Wait, then why is the quadrilateral's area 4? Maybe I made a mistake in the shoelace formula order.

Wait, perhaps the points should be ordered differently.

Wait, if I order the points as D, F, E, C, D, but in a clockwise order, the shoelace formula might give negative area.

Wait, let me try.

Compute shoelace formula with points ordered clockwise.

List of points clockwise:

1. D: (0,3)

2. F: (8/3, 2)

3. E: (4,0)

4. C: (8,0)

5. Back to D: (0,3)

Wait, same as before.

Wait, but maybe the issue is that the shoelace formula requires the points to be ordered either clockwise or counterclockwise without crossing.

Wait, if I traverse the quadrilateral D-F-E-C, is it a simple polygon or does it intersect itself?

From D=(0,3) to F=(8/3,2): moving right and down.

From F to E=(4,0): moving right and down.

From E=(4,0) to C=(8,0): moving right.

From C=(8,0) back to D=(0,3): moving left and up.

This doesn't cross over itself, so it's a simple polygon. So, the shoelace formula should work.

But then why does splitting the quadrilateral into two triangles give me a different area?

Wait, perhaps I messed up which triangles to split.

Wait, actually, if I split the quadrilateral D-F-E-C into D-F-E and E-C-D, as I did before, both triangles are adjacent and don't overlap.

Wait, but in reality, the quadrilateral D-F-E-C is a four-sided figure, and when split as D-F-E and E-C-D, those are two non-overlapping triangles, but their union is the quadrilateral.

Wait, but in my calculation, D-F-E is 2 and E-C-D is 6, which sum to 8, while shoelace formula gives 4.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I need to double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the shoelace formula.

Wait, let me list the coordinates again:

Point D: (0,3)

Point F: (8/3, 2)

Point E: (4,0)

Point C: (8,0)

So, in order, the shoelace formula is:

Multiply xi * yi+1:

0*2 + (8/3)*0 + 4*0 + 8*3 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 24 = 24

Multiply yi * xi+1:

3*(8/3) + 2*4 + 0*8 + 0*0 = 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 16

Difference: 24 - 16 = 8

Area: 1/2 * 8 = 4

So, that's correct. So, the area is 4.

But when I split into two triangles, I get 8, which is double. So, I must have messed up the split.

Wait, maybe I should split the quadrilateral into D-F-E and D-E-C, not D-F-E and E-C-D.

So, let's compute the area of D-F-E: 2

Area of D-E-C: 6

Total area: 2 + 6 = 8

But shoelace formula is 4, so which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way I drew the quadrilateral.

Wait, maybe the quadrilateral is not D-F-E-C but another set of points.

Wait, let me think again. The Asymptote code draws E--A--C--D, which is a polygon. Then, F is the intersection of EA and DC.

So, quadrilateral D-F-E-C is as I thought.

Wait, but let's consider the figure. Since F is inside the figure, is the quadrilateral D-F-E-C a four-sided figure? Or is it a different figure?

Wait, if I think of D-F-E-C, it's a quadrilateral that goes from D to F, then to E, then to C, then back to D.

But according to the shoelace formula, it's 4, which is less than half of the rectangle.

Alternatively, perhaps the quadrilateral is D-F-E, but not C.

Wait, the Asymptote code also draws (-1,0)--(10,0), which is the x-axis, and (0,-1)--(0,8), which is the y-axis.

So, the figure is drawn with axes, but the polygon E--A--C--D is drawn as well.

So, perhaps the quadrilateral D-F-E-C is a four-sided figure, but maybe the figure is being considered in parts.

Wait, maybe I should re-examine the Asymptote code.

In the Asymptote code, after drawing E--A--C--D, they also draw the axes, which are from (-1,0) to (10,0) and from (0,-1) to (0,8).

So, the axes are drawn as dashed lines, but they are not part of the figure. So, the figure is just E--A--C--D.

But the problem says "quadrilateral DFEF". So, is that another figure?

Wait, perhaps the problem is a typo, and it should be D-F-E-C, as I thought earlier.

Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the figure is D-F-E-D, which is a triangle.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, E is connected to C, and C is connected back to D, so that's a polygon.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the figure in terms of the Asymptote code's drawing.

The figure is drawn as E--A--C--D, and the axes are drawn, but the figure itself is E-A-C-D, but then F is defined as the intersection, so the quadrilateral is D-F-E-C.

But according to the shoelace formula, that area is 4.

But when I split into two triangles, I get 8.

Wait, I must have messed up the split.

Wait, perhaps it's D-F-E-C, but when I split it into D-F-E and E-C-D, but E-C-D is a triangle that overlaps with D-F-E.

Wait, but no, D-F-E and E-C-D don't overlap.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the quadrilateral is not D-F-E-C, but D-F-E-C-F, which is a different figure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the figure is a polygon with vertices at D, F, E, and C, but in the coordinate system, the lines from E to C cross over somewhere else.

Wait, no, E is (4,0), C is (8,0). So, E to C is along the x-axis.

Wait, perhaps the figure is D-F-E-C, which is a trapezoid.

Wait, but with the coordinates, D is (0,3), F is (8/3,2), E is (4,0), C is (8,0).

Plotting these, D-F-E-C is a quadrilateral that goes from D up to F, then down to E, then along the base to C, and back to D.

Wait, perhaps the area is 4, as computed by the shoelace formula.

But then, if I split the quadrilateral into two triangles, D-F-E and D-E-C, which have areas 2 and 6, that adds up to 8, which is double.

Wait, so maybe the correct area is 4, and my split is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the quadrilateral D-F-E-C is not convex, and the split is not correct.

Wait, maybe the figure is a pentagon or something else.

Wait, let me try to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the area of quadrilateral D-F-E-C is 4, and the problem is simply to compute that.

But before finalizing, let me think again.

Shoelace formula gives 4, which seems correct.

Alternatively, I can compute the area using vectors.

Compute vectors DF, FC, CE, ED, etc., but that might not help.

Alternatively, the area can be computed as the sum of the areas of triangles D-F-E and D-E-C.

Wait, as I did before, but that gave 8.

Wait, but the shoelace formula gave 4.

I must have messed up the split.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the quadrilateral is D-F-E-C, but the area is 4, so it's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is worded as quadrilateral D-F-E-C, but in the Asymptote code, it's E--A--C--D.

Wait, maybe D-F-E-C is not a simple quadrilateral.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the figure as a polygon with vertices D, F, E, C, but since F is inside, it's a four-sided figure.

But when I compute the area, it's 4.

Alternatively, I can use the shoelace formula again, but order the points correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should list the points in a different order.

Wait, if I list them as D, F, E, C, D, but in clockwise order.

Wait, from D=(0,3) to F=(8/3,2): moving clockwise.

From F=(8/3,2) to E=(4,0): moving clockwise.

From E=(4,0) to C=(8,0): moving clockwise.

From C=(8,0) back to D=(0,3): moving clockwise.

So, all points are ordered clockwise.

So, shoelace formula should work.

So, in shoelace formula, the area is 1/2 |sum xi*yi+1 - sum yi*xi+1|.

So, as before, sum xi*yi+1 is 24, sum yi*xi+1 is 16, difference is 8, area is 4.

So, that's correct.

Therefore, the area of quadrilateral D-F-E-C is 4.

Thus, the answer is 4.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, they drew E--A--C--D, which is a quadrilateral, and the figure is supposed to be D-F-E-C, which is a four-sided figure inside.

But according to the shoelace formula, it's 4.

Therefore, after careful consideration, I think the area is 4.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{4}
</think>

To determine the area of quadrilateral \(DFEF\), we first identify the coordinates of the relevant points. 

- \(D\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\), so \(D = (0, 3)\).
- \(E\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{BC}\), so \(E = (4, 0)\).
- \(F\) is the intersection of lines \(EA\) and \(DC\). 

We find the equations of lines \(EA\) and \(DC\):

1. Line \(EA\) connects \(E = (4, 0)\) to \(A = (0, 6)\). The slope is \(-\frac{3}{2}\), giving the equation \(y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 6\).
2. Line \(DC\) connects \(D = (0, 3)\) to \(C = (8, 0)\). The slope is \(-\frac{3}{8}\), giving the equation \(y = -\frac{3}{8}x + 3\).

Solving these equations to find the intersection point \(F\):

\[
-\frac{3}{2}x + 6 = -\frac{3}{8}x + 3
\]

Multiplying through by 8 to clear the denominators:

\[
-12x + 48 = -3x + 24
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
-9x = -24 \implies x = \frac{8}{3}
\]

Substituting \(x = \frac{8}{3}\) back into the equation of line \(DC\):

\[
y = -\frac{3}{8} \left(\frac{8}{3}\right) + 3 = -1 + 3 = 2
\]

Thus, \(F = \left(\frac{8}{3}, 2\right)\).

Next, we use the shoelace formula to find the area of quadrilateral \(D-F-E-C\). The coordinates of the vertices are \(D = (0, 3)\), \(F = \left(\frac{8}{3}, 2\right)\), \(E = (4, 0)\), and \(C = (8, 0)\).

Applying the shoelace formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| (0 \cdot 2 + \frac{8}{3} \cdot 0 + 4 \cdot 0 + 8 \cdot 3) - (3 \cdot \frac{8}{3} + 2 \cdot 4 + 0 \cdot 8 + 0 \cdot 0) \right|
\]

Calculating the sums:

\[
\text{Sum of } x_i y_{i+1} = 0 + 0 + 0 + 24 = 24
\]
\[
\text{Sum of } y_i x_{i+1} = 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 16
\]

Thus, the area is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |24 - 16| = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4
\]

Therefore, the area of quadrilateral \(D-F-E-C\) is \(\boxed{4}\).
