Question:
Evaluate
\[\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4).\]

Correct Answer:
From the angle addition and subtraction formulas,
\begin{align*}
\sin (x + y) &= \sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y, \\
\sin (x - y) &= \sin x \cos y - \cos x \sin y,
\end{align*}so
\begin{align*}
\sin (x + y) \sin (x - y) &= (\sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y)(\sin x \cos y - \cos x \sin y) \\
&= \sin^2 x \cos^2 y + \sin x \cos x \sin y \cos y - \sin x \cos x \sin y \cos y - \cos^2 x \sin^2 y \\
&= \sin^2 x (1 - \sin^2 y) - (1 - \sin^2 x) \sin^2 y \\
&= \sin^2 x - \sin^2 x \sin^2 y - \sin^2 y + \sin^2 x \sin^2 y \\
&= \sin^2 x - \sin^2 y.
\end{align*}Taking $x = \arcsin 0.5$ and $y = \arcsin 0.4,$ we get
\begin{align*}
\sin (\arcsin 0.5 + \arcsin 0.4) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4) &= \sin^2 (\arcsin 0.5) - \sin^2 (\arcsin 0.4) \\
&= 0.5^2 - 0.4^2 \\
&= 0.09 = \boxed{\frac{9}{100}}.
\end{align*}

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to evaluate the expression \[\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4).\] Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, let me recall that \(\arcsin x\) is the inverse sine function, which gives me an angle whose sine is \(x\). So, if I have \(\arcsin 0.4\), that's an angle \(\theta\) such that \(\sin \theta = 0.4\), and similarly, \(\arcsin 0.5\) is an angle \(\phi\) where \(\sin \phi = 0.5\).

I remember that \(\sin(a + b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b\), so maybe I can use that identity to expand both sine terms in the expression. Let me denote \(A = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(B = \arcsin 0.5\), so the expression becomes \(\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B
\]

So, if I multiply these two together:

\[
\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B)
\]

Hmm, that looks like a difference of squares setup, so it simplifies to:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

Which can be written as:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this expression further or find another way to simplify it. Let me think. 

I remember that \(\sin^2 x - \cos^2 x = -\cos 2x\), but in this case, it's \((\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2\). Maybe I can factor this as a difference of squares:

\[
(\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B)(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)
\]

Wait, but that's just the original expression. Maybe I'm going in circles here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for the product of sines, such as the product-to-sum identities. Let me recall that:

\[
\sin \alpha \sin \beta = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(\alpha - \beta) - \cos(\alpha + \beta)]
\]

But in this case, I have \(\sin(A + B)\) and \(\sin(A - B)\), so maybe I can consider substituting \(\alpha = A + B\) and \(\beta = A - B\). Wait, but that might complicate things further.

Wait, actually, if I have \(\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B)\), is there a standard identity for this product? Let me think.

I recall that \(\sin(A + B)\sin(A - B) = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B\). Is that correct? Let me verify:

Using the product-to-sum formula:

\[
\sin(A + B)\sin(A - B) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos( (A + B) - (A - B) ) - \cos( (A + B) + (A - B) )]
\]
Simplify the arguments:

First term inside cosine: \( (A + B) - (A - B) = 2B \)
Second term inside cosine: \( (A + B) + (A - B) = 2A \)

So, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\cos 2B - \cos 2A]
\]

Alternatively, using the identity I thought of earlier: \(\sin^2 A - \sin^2 B = \frac{1 - \cos 2A}{2} - \frac{1 - \cos 2B}{2}\) = \(\frac{\cos 2B - \cos 2A}{2}\), which matches the previous result. So, indeed:

\[
\sin(A + B)\sin(A - B) = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B
\]

That's a useful identity! So, actually, the original expression simplifies to \(\sin^2 A - \sin^2 B\), where \(A = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(B = \arcsin 0.5\). Therefore, the expression is:

\[
\sin^2 (\arcsin 0.4) - \sin^2 (\arcsin 0.5)
\]

But \(\sin(\arcsin x) = x\), so:

\[
0.4^2 - 0.5^2 = 0.16 - 0.25 = -0.09
\]

Wait, that gives me a negative number. Hmm, is that possible? The sine of an angle is between -1 and 1, so \(\sin(A + B)\) and \(\sin(A - B)\) are both between -1 and 1, so their product can be negative, right? So, -0.09 is acceptable.

But let me double-check my steps because I don't want to make a mistake here.

1. I let \(A = \arcsin 0.4\), so \(\sin A = 0.4\), which means \(A = \arcsin 0.4\), and the same for \(B = \arcsin 0.5\).
2. Then I considered the expression \(\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B)\).
3. I expanded this using sine addition and subtraction formulas, then recognized it as a difference of squares, which led me to \(\sin^2 A - \sin^2 B\).
4. Since \(\sin(\arcsin x) = x\), substituting gives \(0.4^2 - 0.5^2 = 0.16 - 0.25 = -0.09\).

Wait, is this correct? Let me verify with another approach.

Alternatively, I can compute \(A + B\) and \(A - B\) numerically and then compute their sines and multiply.

First, compute \(A = \arcsin 0.4\). Let's find the numerical value. \(\arcsin 0.4\) is approximately, well, let me recall that \(\arcsin 0.4\) is roughly 0.4115 radians (since \(\sin 0.4115 \approx 0.4\)).

Similarly, \(B = \arcsin 0.5\) is \(\pi/6\) radians, which is approximately 0.5236 radians.

So, \(A + B \approx 0.4115 + 0.5236 = 0.9351\) radians.

Then, \(A - B \approx 0.4115 - 0.5236 = -0.1121\) radians.

Now, compute \(\sin(A + B) = \sin(0.9351)\). Let's calculate that.

Using a calculator, \(\sin(0.9351) \approx 0.8040\).

Then, \(\sin(A - B) = \sin(-0.1121)\). Since sine is an odd function, this is \(-\sin(0.1121)\). Calculating that, \(\sin(0.1121) \approx 0.1119\), so \(\sin(A - B) \approx -0.1119\).

Multiplying these together: \(0.8040 \times (-0.1119) \approx -0.0899\). That's approximately -0.09, which matches my earlier result. So that seems consistent.

But wait, is the exact value -0.09, or is there a more precise way to compute it?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to compute \(\sin(A + B)\sin(A - B)\) using other trigonometric identities, perhaps leveraging the fact that \(\sin(A + B)\sin(A - B) = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B\), which we've already established.

So, \(\sin^2 A = 0.4^2 = 0.16\), \(\sin^2 B = 0.5^2 = 0.25\), so \(0.16 - 0.25 = -0.09\).

Therefore, the exact value is \(-0.09\), which is \(-9\%\) or \(-9/100\). In fraction form, that's \(-9/100\).

Wait, but the question is presented in terms of sine and arcsin, so it's possible that the answer is a negative fraction? Let me just confirm the exactness.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute \(\sin(A + B)\) and \(\sin(A - B)\) more precisely.

Given that \(A = \arcsin 0.4\), so \(\cos A = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} \approx 0.9165\). Similarly, \(\cos B = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} \approx 0.8660\).

Now, let's compute \(\sin(A + B)\):

\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = 0.4 \times 0.8660 + 0.9165 \times 0.5
\]
Calculating each term:

0.4 * 0.8660 = 0.3464

0.9165 * 0.5 = 0.45825

Adding them together: 0.3464 + 0.45825 = 0.80465

So, \(\sin(A + B) \approx 0.80465\)

Similarly, \(\sin(A - B)\):

\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B = 0.4 * 0.8660 - 0.9165 * 0.5
\]
Calculating each term:

0.4 * 0.8660 = 0.3464

0.9165 * 0.5 = 0.45825

Subtracting: 0.3464 - 0.45825 = -0.11185

So, \(\sin(A - B) \approx -0.11185\)

Multiplying these together: 0.80465 * (-0.11185) â‰ˆ -0.0899

Which is approximately -0.09, as before. So that's a more precise calculation.

Therefore, the exact value is \(-0.09\), which is equal to \(-9/100\).

But wait, let me try to see if there's a way to compute it without using the identity. Maybe using the formula:

\[
\sin(A + B)\sin(A - B) = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B
\]

Which is what I did earlier, so that's consistent.

Alternatively, if I didn't use the identity, I could have expanded it as:

\[
\sin(A + B)\sin(A - B) = [\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B][\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B] = (\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

Which is also equal to:

\[
\sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B
\]

But \(\sin^2 A = 0.16\) and \(\cos^2 A = 0.84\), \(\sin^2 B = 0.25\) and \(\cos^2 B = 0.75\). So,

\[
0.16 \times 0.75 - 0.84 \times 0.25 = 0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09
\]

Which is the same result. So, this also gives me \(-0.09\).

Wait, but another thought: since the expression is \(\sin(A + B)\sin(A - B)\), and we know that \(\sin(A + B)\) and \(\sin(A - B)\) are both sine of angles, which can be positive or negative depending on the angle. However, when multiplied together, they can be positive or negative.

But in this case, we have \(\sin(A + B)\) as approximately 0.80465 and \(\sin(A - B)\) as approximately -0.11185, so their product is negative, which is consistent.

Alternatively, if I had \(\sin(A + B)\) and \(\sin(A - B)\) both positive, their product would be positive, but if one is positive and the other is negative, their product is negative.

So, in this case, since \(A = \arcsin 0.4\) is approximately 0.4115 radians, which is about 23.578 degrees, and \(B = \arcsin 0.5\) is \(\pi/6\) or 30 degrees, so \(A + B\) is approximately 53.628 degrees, and \(A - B\) is approximately -7.422 degrees, which is equivalent to 352.578 degrees in the positive direction. Therefore, \(\sin(A + B)\) is positive, and \(\sin(A - B)\) is negative, so their product is negative. That makes sense.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of reference angles, \(\sin(A - B)\) would be negative because it's in the fourth quadrant, so the sine is negative there.

Therefore, all of these confirm that the product is indeed negative.

Wait, but just to make sure, is there any chance that I made a mistake in interpreting the angle \(A - B\)? Since \(A = \arcsin 0.4\) is approximately 0.4115 radians, and \(B = \arcsin 0.5\) is approximately 0.5236 radians, so \(A - B\) is approximately -0.1121 radians, which is equivalent to 352.578 degrees. So, sine of that angle is negative because it's in the fourth quadrant, as we said before.

So, that's consistent.

Therefore, all my calculations lead me to \(-0.09\) as the value of the expression. So, the answer is \(-0.09\), which can be written as \(-9/100\).

Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-\dfrac{9}{100}}
</think>

To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(A = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(B = \arcsin 0.5\). This transforms the expression into \(\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B)\).

Using the product-to-sum identities, we know that:
\[
\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B
\]

Since \(\sin(\arcsin x) = x\), we have \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). Therefore, we need to compute \(\sin^2 A - \sin^2 B\):
\[
\sin^2 A - \sin^2 B = (0.4)^2 - (0.5)^2 = 0.16 - 0.25 = -0.09
\]

Thus, the value of the expression is:
\[
\boxed{-\dfrac{9}{100}}
\]
