Correct Answer:
Since $PT$ and $RQ$ are parallel, then $2x^\circ=128^\circ,$ so $x=64,$ so $\angle TPQ=64^\circ.$

Since $PT$ and $QR$ are parallel, then $\angle TPQ$ and $\angle PQR$ are supplementary. Thus, $\angle PQR + 64^\circ = 180^\circ,$ so $\angle PQR = \boxed{116} \text{ degrees}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It shows a diagram with points P, T, R, Q, and some angles labeled. The Asymptote code is given, which draws lines and labels angles. The question is asking for the measure of angle PQR in degrees. 

First, let me try to visualize the diagram based on the Asymptote code. There's a horizontal line from (0,0) to (10,0). Then, there are points P, T, and R connected to this base line. P is on the left, T is on the right, and R is at (10,0). So, the base line is from Q to R, and Q is at (0,0). 

There's also a line from Q to P, which goes up to some point P at (-7,10). Similarly, there's a line from Q to T at (7,10). So, the figure is a bit complex with multiple lines. 

Given that PT is parallel to QR, which means the lines PT and QR never meet and are always the same distance apart. Since PT is parallel to QR, maybe we can use properties of parallel lines and angles to solve this problem.

Looking at the labels, we have angle measures: x degrees at point P, 2x degrees at point T, and 128 degrees at point R. The angle at R is labeled at (10,0), which is the point R on the base line.

The question is asking for angle PQR, which is the angle at point Q between points P and R. So, angle PQR is at Q, between QP and QR.

Let me think about the diagram. So, we have points Q at (0,0), P at (-7,10), T at (7,10), and R at (10,0). So, QR is the base line from Q to R, which is 10 units long in the diagram. PT is another line from P to T, which is drawn from (-7,10) to (7,10), so it's a horizontal line as well, but it's at a height of 10 units.

So, PT is parallel to QR because both are horizontal lines. So, PT is parallel to QR.

Given that PT is parallel to QR, the angles formed by these lines with the transversals should be equal. So, maybe we can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals to find the angles.

Looking at point Q, which is connected to P and R. So, Q is connected to P and R, with QP going up to (-7,10), QR going left to (10,0). So, angle PQR is the angle at Q between P and R.

But since PT is parallel to QR, maybe we can consider the triangles formed by these lines. Let me see.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, it draws Q connected to P and T, and also Q connected to R. So, Q is connected to both P and R, and also PT is connected to P and T.

So, maybe we can consider triangles QPT and QRT. Since PT is parallel to QR, maybe there's a triangle similarity or something.

But first, let me note down the given angles:

- At point P, angle is x degrees.
- At point T, angle is 2x degrees.
- At point R, angle is 128 degrees.

So, in the figure, we have triangle PRT with angles at P, T, and R. Wait, no, because P and T are connected via PT and QR, but R is on the base line QR.

Wait, perhaps triangle PQT and triangle RTQ? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, since PT is parallel to QR, the angles formed by a transversal (which could be PQ or RT) should be equal. So, if we consider PQ as a transversal, then angle between PT and PQ at point P should be equal to the angle between QR and PQ at point Q. Similarly, angle between RT and QR at point T should be equal to the angle between QR and PQ at point Q.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should assign variables to the angles and set up equations based on the parallel lines.

Let me denote the angle at point P as angle QPT, which is x degrees. Similarly, at point T, the angle QTR is 2x degrees. At point R, the angle is 128 degrees.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the angle at R is labeled as 128 degrees. So, in the figure, the angle at R is 128 degrees, which is probably the angle between QR and RT. So, angle QRT is 128 degrees.

Since PT is parallel to QR, the corresponding angles formed by the transversal P to T should be equal.

So, let's consider the transversal PT cutting across the parallel lines QR and PT. Wait, but PT is parallel to QR, so the corresponding angles should be equal.

Wait, actually, in the case of parallel lines, the corresponding angles are equal. So, if PT is parallel to QR, then angle QPT (which is at P) should correspond to angle QTR (which is at T). But angle QPT is x degrees, and angle QTR is 2x degrees. So, x should equal 2x, which would mean x is zero, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, that must mean I'm mixing up the angles. Maybe it's not the corresponding angles, but the alternate interior angles.

When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, alternate interior angles are equal. So, maybe angle QPT (x degrees) is an alternate interior angle to angle QTR (2x degrees). If that's the case, then x equals 2x, which again implies x is zero, which is impossible. So, maybe I'm not identifying the correct angles.

Alternatively, perhaps PT is a transversal cutting QR and another line. Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing Q connected to P and T, so perhaps PT is a transversal cutting QR at some point.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, PT is drawn as (10,0) to (20,0). Wait, no, hold on. The Asymptote code is:

draw((0,0)--(10,0),black+linewidth(1));

draw((0,0)--(-7,10)--(7,10)--(10,0),black+linewidth(1));

So, first, it draws the base line from Q(0,0) to R(10,0). Then, it draws Q to P(-7,10), P to T(7,10), and T to R(10,0). So, the figure has Q connected to P and T, and P connected to T.

So, PT is the line from P(-7,10) to T(7,10), which is a horizontal line. QR is the base line from (0,0) to (10,0). So, PT is parallel to QR, both horizontal.

So, in this figure, PT is parallel to QR, and both are horizontal lines. So, the lines QP and QT are connecting Q to P and Q to T.

So, angle at P is angle QPT, which is x degrees. Angle at T is angle QTR, which is 2x degrees. Angle at R is angle QRT, which is 128 degrees.

So, in the triangle PRT, we have angles at P, T, and R. Wait, but in the figure, point Q is connected to P and T, so the triangle PQT is formed? Hmm, maybe not. Let's see.

Wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing Q connected to P and T, and also P connected to T. So, Q is connected to P and T, and P is connected to T. So, the figure is a quadrilateral QPT R? Because Q connected to P and T, and P connected to T, and T connected to R, which is connected back to Q via the base line.

Wait, actually, the figure is a quadrilateral QPT R, with Q connected to P and T, P connected to T, T connected to R, and R connected back to Q. So, it's a quadrilateral.

But since PT is parallel to QR, so maybe QPT R is a trapezoid? Because both PT and QR are parallel.

So, in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the non-parallel sides are supplementary.

Wait, but in this case, since PT is parallel to QR, and Q is connected to both P and T, so angle at Q is angle PQR, which is the angle we need to find.

Hmm, so in a trapezoid, the consecutive angles between the non-parallel sides are supplementary. So, angle at P plus angle at R should be 180 degrees, and angle at Q plus angle at T should be 180 degrees.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the angle at R is 128 degrees, which is at point R. So, if angle R is 128 degrees, then angle Q, which is angle PQR, should be 180 - 128 = 52 degrees.

Wait, is that correct? If PT is parallel to QR, and if the figure is a trapezoid, then yes, consecutive angles on the same side should be supplementary.

So, angle R is 128 degrees, so angle Q should be 52 degrees.

But wait, let me verify because the Asymptote code shows that angle at R is 128 degrees, but in the figure, the angle at Q is the angle PQR. So, is angle PQR supplementary to angle R?

Wait, in a trapezoid, the angles adjacent to each base are supplementary. So, angle at P and angle at R are supplementary. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, angle at R is 128 degrees, so angle at P should be 52 degrees? But the problem says that angle at P is x degrees, angle at T is 2x degrees. So, if angle P is 52 degrees, then x would be 52 degrees, but angle T is 2x, which would be 104 degrees.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the labels are x° at P, 2x° at T, and 128° at R. So, maybe the angle at R is 128°, angle at P is x°, and angle at T is 2x°, so we can relate these.

But if the trapezoid has PT parallel to QR, then angle at P plus angle at R equals 180°, and angle at T plus angle at Q equals 180°. But in this case, angle at P is x°, angle at T is 2x°, angle at R is 128°, so angle at Q would be 180° - 128° = 52°, and angle at P plus angle at R is x° + 128° = 180°, so x° = 52°, and angle at T is 2x°, which would be 104°, but in the Asymptote code, angle at T is labeled as 2x°, but the actual angle in the figure is 104°, which is different.

Wait, but maybe I'm misapplying the property here. Because in a trapezoid, the sum of each pair of angles on the same side is 180°, but in this case, the angles at P and T are not on the same side. Wait, wait, PT is parallel to QR, so sides PT and QR are the two bases.

So, in trapezoid QPT R, sides QR and PT are the bases, and sides QP and TR are the legs.

So, in a trapezoid, the consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary.

So, angle at Q and angle at R are on the same side, so they should be supplementary.

Similarly, angle at P and angle at T are on the same side, so they should be supplementary.

So, angle Q + angle R = 180°, and angle P + angle T = 180°.

Given angle R is 128°, so angle Q is 180° - 128° = 52°.

Similarly, angle P is x°, angle T is 2x°, so x° + 2x° = 180°, so 3x° = 180°, so x° = 60°.

But wait, the angle at R is labeled as 128°, which is the angle between QR and RT. So, in the figure, angle R is 128°, which is on the same side as QR and PT.

But if angle Q is 52°, which is the angle at Q between QP and QR, that seems inconsistent because angle P is 60°, angle T is 120°, and angle Q is 52°, which adds to 60 + 120 + 52 = 232°, which is more than 180°, which is impossible for a quadrilateral.

Wait, that can't be. So, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the figure is not a trapezoid, but a different quadrilateral.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn as Q--P--T--R--Q, right? So, it's a quadrilateral with sides QP, PT, TR, and RQ.

Given that PT is parallel to QR, so sides PT and QR are parallel.

Thus, it's a trapezoid, but in a trapezoid, the sum of the angles on each side is 180°, but in this case, if PT is parallel to QR, then the angles adjacent to each base should add up to 180°.

So, angle at Q and angle at R should be supplementary, as should angle at P and angle at T.

But in the Asymptote code, the angle at R is given as 128°, so angle at Q should be 52°, and angle at P and angle at T should add up to 180°.

Given that angle at P is x°, angle at T is 2x°, so x + 2x = 180°, which implies x = 60°, so angle P is 60°, angle T is 120°.

But then, the angle at Q is 52°, so the total sum of angles would be 60 + 120 + 52 + angle at R, but wait, angle at R is 128°, so 60 + 120 + 52 + 128 = 360°, which is correct for a quadrilateral.

But in the Asymptote code, the labels are given as angle P is x°, angle T is 2x°, and angle R is 128°, so angle Q is 52°, which is different from the label at Q.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it labels angle Q as PQR, which is the angle at Q between P and R. So, in the diagram, angle Q is 52°, but in the Asymptote code, angle Q is labeled as angle PQR, which is 52°, but in the code, it's labeled as 52°, which is different from the label for angle T.

Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, the label for angle Q is at (0,10), but in the Asymptote code, it's labeled as "PQR", which is the angle at Q between P and R, which is 52°, so that's correct.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, angle at P is x°, which is 60°, angle at T is 2x°, which is 120°, angle at R is 128°, and angle at Q is 52°, which adds up correctly.

But in the problem statement, the labels are x° at P, 2x° at T, and 128° at R, so angle Q is 52°, which is the answer.

But wait, the problem is from an external source, so I should make sure that my reasoning is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the properties because the figure might not be a standard trapezoid.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, PT is from (-7,10) to (7,10), so it's a horizontal line, same as QR from (0,0) to (10,0). So, both are horizontal lines, hence parallel.

So, yes, PT is parallel to QR.

Therefore, the figure is a trapezoid with bases PT and QR, and legs PQ and TR.

In a trapezoid, the consecutive angles between the legs are supplementary.

So, angle at P (between PQ and PT) plus angle at R (between TR and QR) equals 180°, and angle at T (between TR and PT) plus angle at Q (between PQ and QR) equals 180°.

Given that angle at R is 128°, angle at P is x°, angle at T is 2x°, so angle at Q is 180° - 128° = 52°, and angle at P + angle at T = x + 2x = 3x = 180°, so x = 60°, so angle P is 60°, angle T is 120°, and angle Q is 52°, which adds up to 60 + 120 + 52 + 128 = 360°, which is correct.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, the angle at P is labeled as x°, which is 60°, angle at T is labeled as 2x°, which is 120°, angle at R is 128°, and angle at Q is 52°, which is labeled as angle PQR. So, the measure of angle PQR is 52°, which is the angle at Q between PQ and QR.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, point Q is at (0,0), point P is at (-7,10), and point R is at (10,0). So, the angle at Q is between PQ and QR. So, it's the angle between the lines from Q to P and from Q to R, which is angle PQR.

Therefore, the measure of angle PQR is 52°, which is the angle at Q.

Wait, but hold on, in the Asymptote code, angle Q is labeled as "PQR", which is angle between P, Q, R, which is at Q. So, yes, angle PQR is 52°, which is the angle we need to find.

But, let me double-check because sometimes the labels can be confusing. In the Asymptote code, the label for angle P is at (-6,10), which is between P, Q, and R, correct? So, the angle at P is between QP and PR, which is angle QPR. So, angle P is x°, angle T is 2x°, angle R is 128°, angle Q is PQR, which is 52°.

So, according to this, angle PQR is 52°, which is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals more directly.

Since PT is parallel to QR, and PQ is a transversal, the corresponding angles are equal. So, angle QPT (which is x°) is equal to angle QTR (which is 2x°). But that would mean x = 2x, which implies x = 0, which is impossible, so that must mean that the angles are alternate interior angles.

So, angle QPT (x°) is equal to angle QTR (2x°), but since they are alternate interior angles, they should be equal, so x = 2x, which again implies x = 0. Hmm, contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong angles. Maybe it's not the angles at P and T, but the angles at the other sides.

Wait, in the trapezoid, the consecutive angles between the legs are supplementary. So, angle P + angle R = 180°, and angle T + angle Q = 180°.

Given angle R is 128°, angle P is x°, angle T is 2x°, so angle Q is 180° - angle R = 52°, and angle P + angle T = x + 2x = 3x = 180°, so x = 60°, so angle P is 60°, angle T is 120°, angle Q is 52°, and angle R is 128°, summing to 360°, which is correct.

Therefore, angle PQR is 52°, which is the angle at Q between PQ and QR.

So, I think that's the answer.

But just to make sure, let me think of another approach.

Since PT is parallel to QR, the lines PQ and TR are transversals cutting them, so maybe we can use similar triangles.

But in this case, since PT is parallel to QR, the triangles QPT and QRT are similar?

Wait, no, because QPT is a triangle with base PT, and QRT is a triangle with base QR. But PT is parallel to QR, so the triangles QPT and QRT are similar.

Wait, yes, because they are both triangles with a common vertex Q, and their bases PT and QR are parallel, so the triangles are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem or Thales' theorem.

So, triangle QPT ~ triangle QRT.

So, the ratio of sides QP/QR = QT/QT (but that's not helpful) or maybe other sides.

Wait, maybe the ratio of QP to QT is equal to the ratio of PT to RT.

But I don't have the lengths, so this might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Sines or Cosines.

But since PT is parallel to QR, the angles at P and R are equal because they are alternate interior angles.

Wait, but earlier I thought that angle P and angle R are supplementary, not equal.

Wait, no, if PT is parallel to QR, then angle QPT (x°) is equal to angle QTR (2x°) as alternate interior angles.

Wait, but if angle QPT is x°, then angle QTR is also x°, but in the problem, angle QTR is given as 2x°, which is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I got the angle identification wrong.

Wait, angle at P is x°, which is angle QPT, which is at point P between QP and PT.

Similarly, angle at T is 2x°, which is angle QTR, which is at point T between QT and TR.

Since PT is parallel to QR, the alternate interior angles formed by the transversal QT would be equal.

So, angle QPT (x°) is equal to angle QTR (2x°), but that would mean x = 2x, so x = 0, which is impossible.

Therefore, maybe the alternate interior angles are on the other side.

Wait, angle QPT is x°, and angle QTR is 2x°, but since they are on different sides of the transversal QT, maybe they are supplementary.

So, x + 2x = 180°, so 3x = 180°, x = 60°, so angle QPT is 60°, angle QTR is 120°, but in the problem, angle QTR is 2x°, which is 120°, so that works.

So, in this case, angle QPT is 60°, angle QTR is 120°, and then angle P is 60°, angle T is 120°, so then the sum of angles at Q is 180°, so angle P + angle T = 60 + 120 = 180°, so angle Q is 180 - 128 = 52°, which is consistent.

Therefore, the measure of angle PQR is 52°.

So, the answer is 52 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The measure of $\angle PQR$ is $\boxed{52}$ degrees.
</think>

Given that \(PT\) is parallel to \(QR\), we need to find the measure of \(\angle PQR\). 

1. Identify the given angles and their positions:
   - \(\angle P = x^\circ\)
   - \(\angle T = 2x^\circ\)
   - \(\angle R = 128^\circ\)

2. Since \(PT \parallel QR\), the angles formed by the transversal \(QT\) are supplementary. Therefore, the consecutive angles on the same side are supplementary:
   - \(\angle P + \angle T = 180^\circ\)
   - \(\angle Q + \angle R = 180^\circ\)

3. Substitute the known values into the equations:
   - \(x + 2x = 180^\circ\)
     - \(3x = 180^\circ\)
     - \(x = 60^\circ\)
   - \(\angle Q + 128^\circ = 180^\circ\)
     - \(\angle Q = 180^\circ - 128^\circ\)
     - \(\angle Q = 52^\circ\)

Thus, the measure of \(\angle PQR\) is \(\boxed{52}\) degrees.
