Question:
Given that \begin{align*}x_{1}&=211,\\ x_{2}&=375,\\ x_{3}&=420,\\ x_{4}&=523,\ \text{and}\\ x_{n}&=x_{n-1}-x_{n-2}+x_{n-3}-x_{n-4}\ \text{when}\ n\geq5, \end{align*}find the value of $x_{531}+x_{753}+x_{975}$.

Correct Answer:
Shifting the recurrence over by one and adding, we have: \[\begin{aligned} x_n &= x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \\ x_{n-1} &= x_{n-2} - x_{n-3} + x_{n-4} - x_{n-5} \\ \implies x_n + x_{n-1} &= x_{n-1} - x_{n-5} \end{aligned}\]so $x_n = -x_{n-5}$ for all $n.$ In particular, $x_n = -x_{n-5} = -(-x_{n-10}) = x_{n-10},$ so the sequence repeats with period $10.$ Thus, \[\begin{aligned} x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} &= x_1 + x_3 + x_5 \\ &= x_1 + x_3 + (x_4-x_3+x_2-x_1) \\ &= x_2 + x_4 \\ &= 375 + 523 = \boxed{898}. \end{aligned}\]

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a recursive sequence. It starts with x₁ = 211, x₂ = 375, x₃ = 420, x₄ = 523, and then for n ≥ 5, each term is defined by the formula xₙ = xₙ₋₁ - xₙ₋₂ + xₙ₋₃ - xₙ₋₄. I need to find the value of x₅₃₁ + x₇₅₃ + x₉₇₅. Hmm, that seems pretty big, so calculating each term up to 975 manually isn't feasible. I have to find a pattern or some periodicity in the sequence to make this manageable.

First, let me write down the recurrence relation again:

xₙ = xₙ₋₁ - xₙ₋₂ + xₙ₋₃ - xₙ₋₄ for n ≥ 5.

I wonder if this sequence is periodic. If it is, then maybe I can find the period and then find the terms modulo the period to simplify things. Alternatively, maybe it's related to some linear algebra or eigenvalues, but I'm not sure about that.

Looking at the recurrence relation, it's a linear recurrence of order 4. To analyze its behavior, I can try finding the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for a recurrence relation like this would be:

r⁴ - r³ + r² - r + 1 = 0.

Wait, let me make sure. The standard form for a linear recurrence with constant coefficients is:

aₙ = c₁aₙ₋₁ + c₂aₙ₋₂ + c₃aₙ₋₃ + c₄aₙ₋₄.

In this case, the recurrence is xₙ = xₙ₋₁ - xₙ₋₂ + xₙ₋₃ - xₙ₋₄, so the coefficients are 1, -1, 1, -1. Therefore, the characteristic equation is indeed:

r⁴ - r³ + r² - r + 1 = 0.

Hmm, let's try to factor this polynomial. Maybe it can be factored into lower-degree polynomials. Let me see if I can factor it.

Looking for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are ±1. Let me test r=1:

1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 -1 +1 -1 +1 = 1. Not zero.

Testing r=-1:

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. Not zero. So no rational roots. Maybe it can be factored into quadratics or something else.

Let me try to factor it as (r² + ar + b)(r² + cr + d). Multiplying these out:

= r⁴ + (a + c)r³ + (ac + b + d)r² + (ad + bc)r + bd.

Comparing coefficients with the original polynomial:

1) Coefficient of r⁴: 1, which matches.

2) Coefficient of r³: (a + c) = -1.

3) Coefficient of r²: (ac + b + d) = 1.

4) Coefficient of r: (ad + bc) = -1.

5) Constant term: bd = 1.

So we have the system:

a + c = -1,

ac + b + d = 1,

ad + bc = -1,

bd = 1.

From the last equation, bd = 1. So possible pairs for (b, d) are (1,1) or (-1,-1).

Let me try (b, d) = (1,1):

Then, from the first equation, a + c = -1.

From the third equation, ad + bc = a*1 + b*c = a + c = -1. But the third equation requires ad + bc = -1, which is -1. So that works.

From the second equation, ac + b + d = ac + 1 + 1 = ac + 2 = 1 ⇒ ac = -1.

So now, we have a + c = -1 and a*c = -1.

So now, a and c are roots of the equation t² + t -1 = 0.

Wait, because a + c = -1 and a*c = -1, so the quadratic equation is t² - (a + c)t + a*c = t² + t -1 = 0.

Solving t² + t -1 = 0, using quadratic formula:

t = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(5)] / 2.

So we have a = [ -1 + sqrt(5) ] / 2, c = [ -1 - sqrt(5) ] / 2, or vice versa.

Therefore, the characteristic polynomial factors as:

(r² + [( -1 + sqrt(5))/2] r + 1)(r² + [(-1 - sqrt(5))/2] r + 1).

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but I can note that the roots are complex or maybe real?

Wait, actually, discriminant for each quadratic:

First quadratic: t² + [( -1 + sqrt(5))/2] r + 1. The discriminant is [( -1 + sqrt(5))/2]^2 - 4*1*1.

Let me compute that:

= [ (1 - 2 sqrt(5) + 5 ) / 4 ] - 4

= (6 - 2 sqrt(5))/4 - 4

= (3 - sqrt(5))/2 - 4

= (3 - sqrt(5) - 8)/2

= (-5 - sqrt(5))/2, which is negative. So the roots are complex.

Similarly, the second quadratic would have discriminant [( -1 - sqrt(5))/2]^2 - 4*1*1.

Compute:

= [1 + 2 sqrt(5) + 5 ] /4 - 4

= (6 + 2 sqrt(5))/4 -4

= (3 + sqrt(5))/2 -4

= (3 + sqrt(5) -8)/2

= (-5 + sqrt(5))/2, also negative.

So both quadratic factors have complex roots, meaning the original characteristic equation has four complex roots, which suggests that the solution might be periodic with some period.

But to find the period, I might need to compute more terms or find the eigenvalues.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence is periodic with a certain period. Let me test if the sequence repeats after some terms.

Given that we have four initial terms, maybe the period is 6? Let me compute x₅ to see.

Compute x₅ using the recurrence:

x₅ = x₄ - x₃ + x₂ - x₁ = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211.

Compute step by step:

523 - 420 = 103,

103 + 375 = 478,

478 - 211 = 267.

So x₅ = 267.

Now, x₆ = x₅ - x₄ + x₃ - x₂ = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375.

Compute:

267 - 523 = -256,

-256 + 420 = 164,

164 - 375 = -211.

x₆ = -211.

x₇ = x₆ - x₅ + x₄ - x₃ = (-211) - 267 + 523 - 420.

Compute:

-211 -267 = -478,

-478 + 523 = 45,

45 - 420 = -375.

x₇ = -375.

x₈ = x₇ - x₆ + x₅ - x₄ = (-375) - (-211) + 267 - 523.

Compute:

-375 + 211 = -164,

-164 + 267 = 103,

103 - 523 = -420.

x₈ = -420.

x₉ = x₈ - x₇ + x₆ - x₅ = (-420) - (-375) + (-211) - 267.

Compute:

-420 + 375 = -45,

-45 - 211 = -256,

-256 - 267 = -523.

x₉ = -523.

x₁₀ = x₉ - x₈ + x₇ - x₆ = (-523) - (-420) + (-375) - (-211).

Compute:

-523 + 420 = -103,

-103 - 375 = -478,

-478 + 211 = -267.

x₁₀ = -267.

x₁₁ = x₁₀ - x₉ + x₈ - x₇ = (-267) - (-523) + (-420) - (-375).

Compute:

-267 + 523 = 256,

256 - 420 = -164,

-164 + 375 = 211.

x₁₁ = 211.

x₁₂ = x₁₁ - x₁₀ + x₉ - x₈ = 211 - (-267) + (-523) - (-420).

Compute:

211 + 267 = 478,

478 - 523 = -45,

-45 + 420 = 375.

x₁₂ = 375.

Wait a second! Look at that. x₁₂ = 375, which is equal to x₂. Let me check if the sequence repeats from here.

x₁ = 211, x₂ = 375, x₃ = 420, x₄ = 523, x₅ = 267, x₆ = -211, x₇ = -375, x₈ = -420, x₉ = -523, x₁₀ = -267, x₁₁ = 211, x₁₂ = 375.

Yes! So starting from x₁, the sequence goes 211, 375, 420, 523, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, 375, 420, ... So it seems that the sequence repeats every 11 terms? Wait, let's count the terms. From x₁ to x₁₂ is 12 terms, but the cycle seems to repeat every 11 terms because x₁₂ = x₁. So the period is 11.

Wait, let's list the terms:

x₁: 211

x₂: 375

x₃: 420

x₄: 523

x₅: 267

x₆: -211

x₇: -375

x₈: -420

x₉: -523

x₁₀: -267

x₁₁: 211

x₁₂: 375

So yes, x₁₂ = x₁, so the period is 11.

Therefore, the sequence is periodic with period 11. So every 11 terms, it repeats.

Therefore, to find x₅₃₁, x₇₅₃, x₉₇₅, we can compute their positions modulo 11.

Compute 531 mod 11:

11*48 = 528, so 531 - 528 = 3. So 531 ≡ 3 mod 11.

Similarly, 753 mod 11:

11*68 = 748, so 753 - 748 = 5. So 753 ≡ 5 mod 11.

975 mod 11:

11*88 = 968, so 975 - 968 = 7. So 975 ≡ 7 mod 11.

So x₅₃₁ = x₃, x₇₅₃ = x₅, x₉₇₅ = x₇.

Looking back at the list:

x₃ = 420,

x₅ = 267,

x₇ = -375.

So the sum is 420 + 267 + (-375) = 420 + 267 = 687; 687 - 375 = 312.

Wait, so x₅₃₁ + x₇₅₃ + x₉₇₅ = 312.

But wait, let me double-check the computations. Maybe I made a mistake in the modulus.

Compute 531 divided by 11:

11*48 = 528, so 531 - 528 = 3, so 531 ≡ 3.

753: 11*68=748, 753-748=5, so 753≡5.

975: 11*88=968, 975-968=7, so 975≡7.

So yes, x₅₃₁ = x₃=420, x₇₅₃=x₅=267, x₉₇₅=x₇=-375.

Sum: 420 + 267 = 687, 687 - 375 = 312.

So the answer is 312.

But wait, let me make sure the period is indeed 11. Let's check x₁₃.

x₁₃ = x₁₂ - x₁₁ + x₁₀ - x₉.

x₁₂ = 375, x₁₁ = 211, x₁₀ = -267, x₉ = -523.

So x₁₃ = 375 - 211 + (-267) - (-523).

Compute:

375 -211=164,

164 -267=-103,

-103 +523=420.

x₁₃=420, which is equal to x₃. So yes, the period is 11.

Therefore, the conclusion is correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{312}
</think>

Given the sequence defined by \( x_1 = 211 \), \( x_2 = 375 \), \( x_3 = 420 \), \( x_4 = 523 \), and \( x_n = x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \) for \( n \geq 5 \), we need to find the value of \( x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} \).

First, we compute the initial terms of the sequence to identify any periodicity. We find that the sequence repeats every 11 terms. This is confirmed by computing the terms up to \( x_{12} \) and observing that \( x_{12} = x_1 \).

To find \( x_{531} \), \( x_{753} \), and \( x_{975} \), we compute their positions modulo 11:

- \( 531 \mod 11 = 3 \)
- \( 753 \mod 11 = 5 \)
- \( 975 \mod 11 = 7 \)

Thus, \( x_{531} = x_3 \), \( x_{753} = x_5 \), and \( x_{975} = x_7 \).

From the sequence, we have:
- \( x_3 = 420 \)
- \( x_5 = 267 \)
- \( x_7 = -375 \)

Summing these values, we get:
\[ 420 + 267 + (-375) = 420 + 267 - 375 = 687 - 375 = 312 \]

Thus, the value of \( x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} \) is \(\boxed{312}\).
