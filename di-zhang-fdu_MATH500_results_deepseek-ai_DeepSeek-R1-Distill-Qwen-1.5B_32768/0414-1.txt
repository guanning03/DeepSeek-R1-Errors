Question:
Let $z$ be a complex number such that $|z| = 1.$  Find the maximum value of
\[|1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2|.\]

Correct Answer:
Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.  Since $|z| = 1,$ $x^2 + y^2 = 1.$  Then
\begin{align*}
|1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| &= |1 + x + yi| + |1 - x - yi + x^2 + 2xyi - y^2| \\
&= |(1 + x) + yi| + |(1 - x + x^2 - 1 + x^2) + (-y + 2xy)i| \\
&= |(1 + x) + yi| + |(-x + 2x^2) + (-y + 2xy)i| \\
&= \sqrt{(1 + x)^2 + y^2} + \sqrt{(-x + 2x^2)^2 + (-y + 2xy)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{(1 + x)^2 + y^2} + \sqrt{(-x + 2x^2)^2 + y^2 (1 - 2x)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{(1 + x)^2 + 1 - x^2} + \sqrt{(-x + 2x^2)^2 + (1 - x^2) (1 - 2x)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{2 + 2x} + \sqrt{1 - 4x + 4x^2} \\
&= \sqrt{2 + 2x} + |1 - 2x|.
\end{align*}Let $u = \sqrt{2 + 2x}.$  Then $u^2 = 2 + 2x,$ so
\[\sqrt{2 + 2x} + |1 - 2x| = u + |3 - u^2|.\]Since $-1 \le x \le 1,$ $0 \le u \le 2.$

If $0 \le u \le \sqrt{3},$ then
\[u + |3 - u^2| = u + 3 - u^2 = \frac{13}{4} - \left( u - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \le \frac{13}{4}.\]Equality occurs when $u = \frac{1}{2},$ or $x = -\frac{7}{8}.$

If $\sqrt{3} \le u \le 2,$ then
\[u + u^2 - 3 = \left( u + \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{13}{4} \le \left( 2 + \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{13}{4} = 3 < \frac{13}{4}.\]Therefore, the maximum value is $\boxed{\frac{13}{4}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to find the maximum value of |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²| where z is a complex number with |z| = 1. Hmm, complex numbers often have interesting properties when dealing with moduli and such. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since |z| = 1, z lies on the unit circle in the complex plane. That means I can represent z as e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z, right? So, z = cosθ + i sinθ. Maybe expressing z in exponential form will simplify the calculations.

Let me write down the expressions inside the moduli:

1. |1 + z|: That should be straightforward. If z = e^{iθ}, then 1 + z = 1 + e^{iθ}. The modulus is |1 + e^{iθ}|. I remember that |1 + e^{iθ}| can be simplified using Euler's formula. Let me calculate it.

|1 + e^{iθ}| = sqrt{(1 + cosθ)^2 + (sinθ)^2}. Expanding that:

(1 + cosθ)^2 + sin²θ = 1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ + sin²θ = 2 + 2cosθ.

So, |1 + e^{iθ}| = sqrt{2 + 2cosθ} = sqrt{2*(1 + cosθ)}. Hmm, and 1 + cosθ is 2cos²(θ/2), so this becomes sqrt{2*2cos²(θ/2)} = sqrt{4cos²(θ/2)} = 2|cos(θ/2)|. Since θ is between 0 and 2π, cos(θ/2) can be positive or negative, but modulus makes it positive. So, |1 + z| = 2|cos(θ/2)|.

Wait, but actually, sqrt{4cos²(θ/2)} is 2|cos(θ/2)|, yes. So that's manageable.

2. The second modulus is |1 - z + z²|. Hmm, let's compute that. Let me write z² in terms of θ. Since z = e^{iθ}, z² = e^{i2θ}. So, 1 - z + z² = 1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}. Maybe I can write this as 1 + (-e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}). Let's see if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor this expression. Let me try. Let me think of 1 - z + z² as a geometric series. Wait, 1 - z + z² is a finite geometric series with ratio z and two terms, but actually, it's a quadratic. Hmm, maybe I can represent it as 1 + z² - z.

Alternatively, I can try to express this as (1 + z²) - z. Let me compute |1 + z² - z|. To find its modulus, I might need to compute it in terms of θ.

So, 1 - z + z² = 1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}. Let me compute the modulus squared:

|1 - z + z²|² = (1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ})(1 - e^{-iθ} + e^{-i2θ}).

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's try expanding it. Multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second:

1*(1) + 1*(-e^{-iθ}) + 1*(e^{-i2θ}) - e^{iθ}*(1) + e^{iθ}*(e^{-iθ}) - e^{iθ}*(e^{-i2θ}) + e^{i2θ}*(1) - e^{i2θ}*(e^{-iθ}) + e^{i2θ}*(e^{-i2θ}).

Simplify each term:

1 - e^{-iθ} + e^{-i2θ} - e^{iθ} + e^{i0} - e^{-iθ} + e^{i2θ} - e^{iθ} + e^{i0}.

Simplify further:

1 - e^{-iθ} + e^{-i2θ} - e^{iθ} + 1 - e^{-iθ} + e^{i2θ} - e^{iθ} + 1.

Combine like terms:

1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Now, the terms with e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}:

- e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} - e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = -2e^{iθ} - 2e^{-iθ} = -2(cosθ + i sinθ) - 2(cosθ - i sinθ) = -4cosθ.

Similarly, the terms with e^{i2θ} and e^{-i2θ}:

e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ} = 2cos2θ.

So, putting it all together:

|1 - z + z²|² = 3 - 4cosθ + 2cos2θ.

Let me compute this expression:

First, let's recall that cos2θ = 2cos²θ - 1. So, 2cos2θ = 4cos²θ - 2.

Substituting back, we have:

3 - 4cosθ + 4cos²θ - 2 = (3 - 2) + ( -4cosθ ) + 4cos²θ = 1 - 4cosθ + 4cos²θ.

Which is (2cosθ - 1)^2. Nice!

So, |1 - z + z²|² = (2cosθ - 1)^2. Therefore, |1 - z + z²| = |2cosθ - 1|.

Since modulus is always non-negative, |2cosθ - 1| is just |2cosθ - 1|. So that's simpler.

So now, our original expression to maximize is |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²| = 2|cos(θ/2)| + |2cosθ - 1|.

So, we need to find the maximum value of f(θ) = 2|cos(θ/2)| + |2cosθ - 1| for θ ∈ [0, 2π).

Hmm, okay, so f(θ) is a function of θ, and we need to find its maximum. To do that, perhaps we can consider different cases based on the values of cosθ and cos(θ/2).

First, let's note that both cosθ and cos(θ/2) vary between -1 and 1 as θ varies.

Let me analyze the expression |2cosθ - 1|.

Let me denote x = cosθ, so x ∈ [-1, 1]. Then, |2x - 1|.

Similarly, |cos(θ/2)| can be expressed in terms of x, but it's perhaps more complicated. Maybe instead, it's better to consider θ in terms of t, where t = θ/2, so θ = 2t, and t ∈ [0, π). Then, cosθ = cos2t = 2cos²t - 1. So, cosθ = 2cos²t -1, so we can express everything in terms of t.

Wait, maybe that's a useful substitution. Let me define t = θ/2, so θ = 2t, and t ∈ [0, π). Then, cosθ = 2cos²t - 1.

So, |1 + z| = 2|cos(t)|, and |1 - z + z²| = |2cos(2t) - 1|.

So, f(t) = 2|cos t| + |2cos2t - 1|, with t ∈ [0, π).

But since cos2t is even, cos2t = cos(-2t), so for t ∈ [0, π), 2t ∈ [0, 2π). But since t is in [0, π), 2t is in [0, 2π). However, cos2t is periodic with period π, so we can consider t ∈ [0, π/2) and t ∈ [π/2, π) separately.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider t ∈ [0, π/2) and t ∈ [π/2, π) because of symmetry.

Wait, but wait, f(t) has |cos t|, which is symmetric around t=0 and t=π, so perhaps t ∈ [0, π) suffices.

But perhaps I can express everything in terms of t ∈ [0, π), and then consider the function f(t) = 2|cos t| + |2cos2t - 1|.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to express both terms in terms of t and see how they behave.

Wait, but let's see. Since t ∈ [0, π), cos t ∈ [-1, 1]. So, |cos t| = |cos t|.

Similarly, cos2t for t ∈ [0, π) is cos2t, which for t ∈ [0, π/2) is cos2t decreasing from 1 to -1, and for t ∈ [π/2, π), cos2t is cos(2t) which is cos(π + (2t - π)) = -cos(2t - π). Wait, maybe not.

Wait, 2t when t ∈ [0, π) is 2t ∈ [0, 2π). So, cos2t is periodic with period π, so cos2t for t ∈ [0, π) is same as cos(2t) which goes from 1 to -1 to 1 as t increases from 0 to π.

Wait, cos(2t) for t ∈ [0, π/2) is cos(2t) decreasing from 1 to -1, and for t ∈ [π/2, π), it's cos(2t) = cos(2t - 2π) which is cos(2t - 2π) but that's not the case. Wait, 2t for t in [π/2, π) is [π, 2π). So, cos2t for t in [π/2, π) is cos2t from -1 to 1.

So, cos2t is in [-1, 1] for all t ∈ [0, π).

Therefore, |2cos2t - 1| is the modulus of 2cos2t -1, which is a function that can be positive or negative.

So, let's analyze the expression f(t) = 2|cos t| + |2cos2t -1| for t ∈ [0, π).

To find the maximum, perhaps we can split the interval [0, π) into regions where the expressions inside the absolute values are positive or negative.

First, let's consider the expression |cos t|.

cos t is positive in [0, π/2) and negative in (π/2, π). So, |cos t| = cos t for t ∈ [0, π/2), and |cos t| = -cos t for t ∈ (π/2, π).

Similarly, let's look at |2cos2t -1|.

We need to find when 2cos2t -1 is positive or negative.

2cos2t -1 ≥ 0 => cos2t ≥ 1/2.

Similarly, 2cos2t -1 ≤0 => cos2t ≤1/2.

Since cos2t is periodic with period π, over t ∈ [0, π), 2t ∈ [0, 2π). So, cos2t ≥1/2 occurs when 2t ∈ [-π/3, π/3], but since 2t is in [0, 2π), that's equivalent to 2t ∈ [0, π/3] ∪ [5π/3, 2π). But since t ∈ [0, π), 2t ∈ [0, 2π), so cos2t ≥1/2 when 2t ∈ [0, π/3] or [5π/3, 2π), but 5π/3 is in [0, 2π). However, in t ∈ [0, π), 2t ∈ [0, 2π). So, cos2t ≥1/2 when 2t ∈ [0, π/3] and [5π/3, 2π). So, in terms of t, that's t ∈ [0, π/6] and t ∈ [5π/6, π).

Similarly, cos2t ≤1/2 when 2t ∈ [π/3, 5π/3], so t ∈ [π/6, 5π/6].

So, the expression |2cos2t -1| can be broken down as:

- When t ∈ [0, π/6], cos2t ≥1/2, so |2cos2t -1| = 2cos2t -1.

- When t ∈ [π/6, 5π/6], cos2t ≤1/2, so |2cos2t -1| = 1 - 2cos2t.

- When t ∈ [5π/6, π), cos2t ≥1/2, so |2cos2t -1| = 2cos2t -1.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me double-check:

If 2t ∈ [0, π/3], then cos2t ≥1/2. So, 2cos2t -1 ≥0.

Similarly, if 2t ∈ [5π/3, 2π), which is equivalent to t ∈ [5π/6, π), since 2t would be 5π/3 to 2π, so cos2t ≥1/2 as well.

So, yes, in t ∈ [0, π/6] and t ∈ [5π/6, π), |2cos2t -1| = 2cos2t -1.

In the middle region t ∈ [π/6, 5π/6], |2cos2t -1| = 1 - 2cos2t.

Similarly, for |cos t|, as I noted earlier:

- For t ∈ [0, π/2), |cos t| = cos t.

- For t ∈ [π/2, π), |cos t| = -cos t.

So, putting it all together, f(t) can be written as:

f(t) = { 2cos t + (2cos2t -1), if t ∈ [0, π/6] ∪ [5π/6, π),  
       -2cos t + (1 - 2cos2t), if t ∈ [π/6, 5π/6]

}

Simplify each case:

Case 1: t ∈ [0, π/6]:

f(t) = 2cos t + 2cos2t -1.

Case 2: t ∈ [π/6, 5π/6]:

f(t) = -2cos t + 1 - 2cos2t.

Case 3: t ∈ [5π/6, π):

f(t) = 2cos t + 2cos2t -1.

So, now, I need to analyze f(t) in each of these intervals.

Let me start with Case 1: t ∈ [0, π/6].

Compute f(t) = 2cos t + 2cos2t -1.

Let me write this as f(t) = 2cos t + 2(2cos²t -1) -1 = 2cos t + 4cos²t -2 -1 = 4cos²t + 2cos t -3.

So, f(t) = 4cos²t + 2cos t -3.

Let me denote x = cos t. Since t ∈ [0, π/6], cos t ∈ [sqrt(3)/2, 1]. Because cos(π/6) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So, x ∈ [sqrt(3)/2, 1]. Then, f(t) can be written as f(x) = 4x² + 2x -3.

We need to find the maximum of f(x) on x ∈ [sqrt(3)/2, 1].

Since f(x) is a quadratic function opening upwards (coefficient on x² is positive), its maximum on an interval is attained at one of the endpoints. So, let's compute f at x = sqrt(3)/2 and x=1.

Compute f(sqrt(3)/2):

4*(3/4) + 2*(sqrt(3)/2) -3 = 3 + sqrt(3) -3 = sqrt(3) ≈1.732.

Compute f(1):

4*1 + 2*1 -3 = 4 + 2 -3 = 3.

So, in this interval, the maximum is 3 at x=1, which is t=0.

Wait, t=0: z = e^{i0} = 1. Let's check f(0):

|1 +1| + |1 -1 +1| = |2| + |1| = 2 +1 =3. Yep, that's correct.

So, in Case1, maximum f(t) is 3.

Case2: t ∈ [π/6, 5π/6].

f(t) = -2cos t +1 -2cos2t.

Again, let me express cos2t in terms of cos t.

cos2t = 2cos²t -1.

So, f(t) = -2cos t +1 -2*(2cos²t -1) = -2cos t +1 -4cos²t +2 = (-4cos²t) -2cos t +3.

So, f(t) = -4cos²t -2cos t +3.

Let me denote x = cos t. Since t ∈ [π/6, 5π/6], cos t ∈ [-1/2, sqrt(3)/2].

Wait, cos t at t=π/6 is sqrt(3)/2, and at t=5π/6 is -1/2. So, x ∈ [-1/2, sqrt(3)/2].

So, f(t) can be written as f(x) = -4x² -2x +3.

This is a quadratic function opening downward (coefficient on x² is negative). So, its maximum is at the vertex.

The vertex is at x = -b/(2a) = -(-2)/(2*(-4)) = 2/(-8) = -1/4.

So, x = -1/4 is within the interval x ∈ [-1/2, sqrt(3)/2]. So, the maximum occurs at x = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4):

-4*(1/16) -2*(-1/4) +3 = -1/4 + 1/2 +3 = (-0.25 + 0.5 +3) = 3.25.

So, f(t) reaches a maximum of 3.25 at x = -1/4, which corresponds to t where cos t = -1/4.

Compute the angle t where cos t = -1/4. That would be t = arccos(-1/4) ≈ 1.823 radians ≈104.48 degrees.

Wait, but t is in [π/6, 5π/6], which is about [0.523, 2.618] radians, so 1.823 is within that interval.

So, in this interval, the maximum is 3.25, which is 13/4.

Case3: t ∈ [5π/6, π).

Here, f(t) = 2cos t + 2cos2t -1.

Again, let's express cos2t as 2cos²t -1.

So, f(t) = 2cos t + 2*(2cos²t -1) -1 = 2cos t +4cos²t -2 -1= 4cos²t + 2cos t -3.

Which is the same as in Case1.

So, f(t) =4x² + 2x -3, where x = cos t, with x ∈ [sqrt(3)/2, 1].

Wait, similar to Case1, so the same reasoning applies.

Compute f(x) at endpoints:

At x = sqrt(3)/2: f(x) = 3 as before.

At x=1: f(x)=3.

So, in this interval, the maximum is 3.

Therefore, putting it all together, the maximum of f(t) is 3.25 in Case2, which is 13/4.

But wait, hold on. Wait, 3.25 is 13/4? Wait, no, 13/4 is 3.25? Wait, no, 13/4 is 3.25? Wait, 4*3=12, so 13/4 is 3.25. Wait, 13/4 is 3.25? No, 13/4 is 3.25. Wait, no: 13 divided by 4 is 3.25? Wait, 4*3=12, 13-12=1, so 13/4=3.25. So, yes.

But wait, 13/4 is 3.25. So, is that the maximum? Wait, in Case1 and Case3, the maximum is 3, and in Case2, it's 13/4, which is higher.

But wait, is that the case? Wait, let me verify.

Wait, in Case2, when t ∈ [π/6, 5π/6], we have f(t) = -4cos²t -2cos t +3, which is a downward opening parabola, so its maximum is at the vertex, which is at x=-1/4, as I found.

But, in this interval, x=cos t ∈ [-1/2, sqrt(3)/2], so x=-1/4 is within that interval, so we can indeed compute f(-1/4) = 13/4.

But is 13/4 actually attainable? Let me check.

t where cos t = -1/4. So, t = arccos(-1/4) ≈1.823 radians, which is about 104.48 degrees.

So, z = e^{i t} = e^{i arccos(-1/4)}.

Compute |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|.

But wait, before I compute that numerically, perhaps I can check if 13/4 is indeed the maximum.

But maybe also, I should check the endpoints of each case.

Wait, in Case2, t ∈ [π/6,5π/6], so t=π/6 and t=5π/6.

Compute f(π/6):

Which is the first endpoint of Case2.

Compute f(π/6):

Using f(t) = -2cos t +1 -2cos2t.

Compute cos(π/6)=sqrt(3)/2, cos(π/3)=0.5.

So, f(π/6)= -2*(sqrt(3)/2) +1 -2*(0.5) = -sqrt(3) +1 -1 = -sqrt(3) ≈-1.732.

Similarly, f(5π/6)= -2cos(5π/6)+1 -2cos(5π/3).

cos(5π/6)= -sqrt(3)/2, cos(5π/3)=0.5.

So, f(5π/6)= -2*(-sqrt(3)/2) +1 -2*(0.5)= sqrt(3) +1 -1= sqrt(3)≈1.732.

So, at endpoints, f is -sqrt(3) and sqrt(3). So, in Case2, the maximum is 13/4, which is higher than the endpoint values.

Similarly, at t=arccos(-1/4), we have f(t)=13/4, which is about 3.25, which is higher than the endpoints.

Therefore, the maximum value is 13/4.

But wait, to make sure, let me compute 13/4.

13 divided by 4 is 3.25. So, 3.25 is 13/4, which is 3.25.

Wait, but is that the maximum? Or is there a point where f(t) could be larger? Let me consider t near 5π/6, let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize it differently.

Alternatively, another approach is to write z as e^{iθ}, and then compute |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|.

Let me compute each modulus:

|1 + z| = |1 + e^{iθ}| = 2|cos(θ/2)|, as we saw earlier.

|1 - z + z²| = |1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}|.

Let me compute this as |(1 - e^{iθ}) + e^{i2θ}|.

But perhaps express it differently.

Wait, 1 - e^{iθ} = -2i sin(θ/2) e^{i(θ/2 - π/2)}.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, express 1 - e^{iθ} = e^{iθ/2}(e^{-iθ/2} - e^{iθ/2}) = -2i sin(θ/2)e^{iθ/2}.

Similarly, e^{i2θ} = e^{i2θ}.

So, 1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ} = -2i sin(θ/2) e^{iθ/2} + e^{i2θ}.

Hmm, not sure that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute |1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}|^2 as done earlier, which gave us 1 - 4cosθ + 4cos²θ.

Wait, that was the same as |1 - z + z²|².

So, |1 - z + z²| = |2cosθ -1|, as we found earlier.

So, the expression is |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²| = 2|cos(θ/2)| + |2cosθ -1|.

So, yes, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try to graph this function or analyze it numerically.

But since I have already done the analysis by breaking into regions, and found that the maximum is 13/4, which is 3.25, which is greater than 3, which is the value at the endpoints.

But to make sure, let me consider t=arccos(-1/4)≈1.823 radians.

Compute |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²| where z = e^{i t}.

Compute |1 + z|: 2|cos(t/2)|.

Compute cos(t/2): cos(arccos(-1/4)/2). Since t=arccos(-1/4), so t/2= (1/2) arccos(-1/4). Let me compute cos(t/2).

Using the identity: cos(t/2) = sqrt[(1 + cos t)/2] = sqrt[(1 -1/4)/2] = sqrt[(3/4)/2] = sqrt(3/8) = (sqrt(6))/4 ≈0.612.

So, |1 + z| = 2*(sqrt(6)/4) = sqrt(6)/2 ≈1.2247.

Similarly, compute |1 - z + z²| = |2cosθ -1|, where θ = t.

So, θ=arccos(-1/4), so cosθ=-1/4.

So, |2cosθ -1|=|2*(-1/4) -1|=| -1/2 -1|=| -3/2 | = 3/2=1.5.

So, |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|= sqrt(6)/2 + 3/2≈1.2247 +1.5≈2.7247.

Wait, that's only about 2.7247, but earlier I thought it was 13/4=3.25. Hmm, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing f(t).

Wait, let's re-examine.

Earlier, I had f(t) = -2cos t +1 -2cos2t for t ∈ [π/6,5π/6]. So, when t=arccos(-1/4), cos t=-1/4, and cos2t= 2cos²t -1=2*(1/16)-1=1/8 -1= -7/8.

So, |2cos2t -1|=|2*(-7/8)-1|=| -7/4 -1|=| -11/4 | =11/4.

Wait, so |2cos2t -1|=11/4, not 3/2.

Wait, so my mistake earlier was in computing |2cos2t -1| as 3/2 when cos2t=-7/8, which is incorrect. It's |2cos2t -1|=|2*(-7/8)-1|=|-7/4 -1|=|-11/4|=11/4.

So, in that case, f(t)= -2cos t +1 -2cos2t= -2*(-1/4)+1 -2*(-7/8)= 0.5 +1 +1.75= 0.5 +1=1.5 +1.75=3.25=13/4.

Ah, okay, so that's correct. So, when t=arccos(-1/4), |2cos2t -1|=11/4, so f(t)=13/4.

But earlier, I thought |2cos2t -1|=3/2, which was incorrect.

So, in fact, f(t)=13/4 at t=arccos(-1/4).

But wait, when I computed |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|, I found that |1 + z| = sqrt(6)/2 ≈1.2247 and |1 - z + z²|=11/4=2.75, so total ≈3.9747, which is more than 13/4≈3.25.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, now I'm confused.

Wait, let me compute |1 + z| and |1 - z + z²| separately.

Wait, z = e^{i t}, t=arccos(-1/4).

Compute |1 + z|: 2|cos(t/2)|.

cos(t)=cos(arccos(-1/4)) = -1/4.

So, cos(t/2)=sqrt[(1 + cos t)/2]=sqrt[(1 -1/4)/2]=sqrt[(3/4)/2]=sqrt(3/8)=sqrt(6)/4≈0.612.

So, |1 + z|=2*(sqrt(6)/4)=sqrt(6)/2≈1.2247.

Similarly, |1 - z + z²|: 2|cosθ -1|, wait no, earlier I had:

|1 - z + z²| = |2cosθ -1|, which is 3/2 when cosθ=1/2, but when cosθ=-1/4, it's |2*(-1/4) -1|= |-1/2 -1|= 3/2. Wait, but above, we computed |2cos2t -1|=11/4, but 2cos2t -1=2*(-7/8)-1= -7/4 -1= -11/4, so |2cos2t -1|=11/4.

Wait, but 2cos2t -1=2*(-7/8)-1= -14/8 -8/8= -22/8= -11/4.

So, |2cos2t -1|=11/4.

But |1 - z + z²|=|2cosθ -1|, which is |2*(-1/4)-1|= |-1/2 -1|= 3/2.

Wait, so that's a contradiction.

Wait, no, if |1 - z + z²|=|2cosθ -1|, then when θ=arccos(-1/4), cosθ=-1/4, so |2*(-1/4)-1|=|-1/2 -1|=3/2=1.5.

But when I compute |1 - z + z²|=|1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}|.

Wait, if θ=arccos(-1/4), then z=e^{iθ}= -1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4.

Compute 1 - z + z²:

Compute z²: (-1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4)^2 = (1/16) - (15/16) + i (2*(-1/4)(sqrt(15)/4))= (-14/16) + i (-sqrt(15)/8)= -7/8 -i sqrt(15)/8.

Then, 1 - z + z²=1 - (-1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4) + (-7/8 -i sqrt(15)/8)=1 +1/4 -i sqrt(15)/4 -7/8 -i sqrt(15)/8.

Compute real parts: 1 +1/4 -7/8 = (8/8 +2/8 -7/8)=3/8.

Imaginary parts: -sqrt(15)/4 - sqrt(15)/8 = (-2sqrt(15)/8 - sqrt(15)/8)= -3sqrt(15)/8.

So, 1 - z + z²= 3/8 -i 3sqrt(15)/8.

Compute modulus: sqrt( (3/8)^2 + (3sqrt(15)/8)^2 )= sqrt(9/64 + 135/64)= sqrt(144/64)=12/8=3/2=1.5.

So, |1 - z + z²|=1.5=3/2.

But earlier, when I expressed |1 - z + z²| as |2cosθ -1|, that was incorrect, because when I did the substitution earlier, I had |1 - z + z²|=|2cosθ -1|, but according to this computation, it's 1.5, which is |2cosθ -1|=|2*(-1/4)-1|=|-1/2 -1|=3/2. So, actually, yes, |2cosθ -1|=3/2, which is correct.

Wait, so why did I think that |1 - z + z²|=|2cos2t -1|?

Because when I expressed |1 - z + z²|=|2cos2t -1|, that's only if I was using a different identity.

Wait, let me re-examine that step.

Earlier, I had:

|1 - z + z²| = |1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}|.

I tried to express it in terms of cos and sin, but perhaps that's not the most straightforward way.

Alternatively, I can compute it directly as I did above.

But when I express it as |2cosθ -1|, that seems incorrect because in my calculation, it's 3/2, which is equal to |2cosθ -1| when cosθ=-1/4.

But when I computed it as |2cos2t -1|, I thought it was |2*cos2t -1|=11/4.

But in this case, |1 - z + z²|=1.5=3/2.

Wait, that suggests that my earlier step was wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in an earlier substitution.

Let me go back.

Wait, I had |1 - z + z²| = |1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}|.

But 1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}= (1 - e^{iθ}) + e^{i2θ}.

But 1 - e^{iθ}= -2i sin(θ/2) e^{i(θ/2 - π/2)}.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps factor it differently.

Wait, 1 - z + z² = (z² +1 - z).

Wait, perhaps factor as z² - z +1. Hmm, discriminant is 1 -4= -3, so complex roots.

Alternatively, perhaps use the identity for |1 - z + z²|.

Wait, perhaps using the formula |1 - z + z²|=|1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}|.

We can write this as |e^{iθ}(e^{-iθ} - e^{-i2θ} + e^{-i3θ})|? Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps write it as |e^{iθ} - e^{i2θ} +1|=|1 + e^{iθ} - e^{i2θ}|.

Wait, that seems similar to the original expression.

Alternatively, perhaps write 1 + z + z² as (z³ -1)/(z -1), but we are dealing with |1 + z + z²|.

But perhaps that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps write it as |z² + z +1|.

Wait, maybe let me compute |z² + z +1| when z= e^{iθ}.

We can write z² + z +1 = e^{i2θ} + e^{iθ} +1.

Let me compute this as a complex number:

Real part: cos2θ + cosθ +1.

Imaginary part: sin2θ + sinθ.

So, |z² + z +1| = sqrt[(cos2θ + cosθ +1)^2 + (sin2θ + sinθ)^2].

Let me compute this.

Compute (cos2θ + cosθ +1)^2 + (sin2θ + sinθ)^2.

Expand:

= (cos2θ)^2 + (cosθ)^2 +1 + 2cos2θ cosθ + 2cos2θ*1 + 2cosθ*1 + (sin2θ)^2 + (sinθ)^2 + 2sin2θ sinθ.

Simplify term by term.

First, (cos2θ)^2 + (sin2θ)^2 = cos²2θ + sin²2θ=1.

Similarly, (cosθ)^2 + (sinθ)^2=1.

So, 1 +1 +1=3.

Now, cross terms:

2cos2θ cosθ + 2cos2θ*1 + 2cosθ*1 + 2sin2θ sinθ.

Let me compute each cross term:

2cos2θ cosθ: 2cos2θ cosθ.

2cos2θ*1: 2cos2θ.

2cosθ*1: 2cosθ.

2sin2θ sinθ: 2sin2θ sinθ.

So, total cross terms:

2cos2θ cosθ + 2cos2θ + 2cosθ + 2sin2θ sinθ.

Now, let's see if we can combine terms.

Note that 2cos2θ + 2sin2θ sinθ.

Wait, 2cos2θ + 2sin2θ sinθ = 2cos2θ + sin(2θ + something)? Hmm, maybe not directly.

Wait, alternatively, use the identity cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB.

But here, we have 2cos2θ sinθ + 2sin2θ cosθ.

Wait, no, let me see:

Wait, 2cos2θ + 2sin2θ sinθ can be written as 2cos2θ + sin(2θ - something). Wait, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, let me compute numerically.

Wait, perhaps too time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity:

cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB.

But we have 2cos2θ cosθ + 2sin2θ sinθ.

Wait, factor 2cosθ:

2cosθ (cos2θ + sin2θ tanθ).

Wait, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express sin2θ in terms of cosθ.

Wait, sin2θ = 2 sinθ cosθ.

So, 2sin2θ sinθ = 4 sin²θ cosθ.

Similarly, 2cos2θ cosθ is as is.

So, 2cosθ (cos2θ + 2 sin²θ).

But cos2θ= 2cos²θ -1.

So, 2cosθ (2cos²θ -1 + 2 sin²θ).

But sin²θ=1 - cos²θ, so 2cosθ (2cos²θ -1 + 2(1 - cos²θ))=2cosθ (2cos²θ -1 + 2 - 2cos²θ)=2cosθ (1)=2cosθ.

So, 2cosθ + 2cos2θ.

Therefore, total cross terms:

2cosθ + 2cos2θ + 2cosθ + 2sin2θ sinθ.

Wait, wait, no, the cross terms were:

2cos2θ cosθ + 2cos2θ + 2cosθ + 2sin2θ sinθ.

Which we have now as 2cosθ (cos2θ + 2 sin²θ) + 2cos2θ + 2cosθ + 2sin2θ sinθ.

Wait, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps use the identity that |1 + z + z²|=|z³ -1| / |z -1|, but since |z|=1, |z³|=1, so |z³ -1|=|1 - z³|, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that 1 + z + z² is related to roots of unity.

Wait, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps compute |1 + z + z²| when z= e^{iθ}= -1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4.

So, compute 1 + z + z².

1 + (-1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4) + (-1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4)^2.

First, compute z= -1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4.

z²= (-1/4)^2 + 2*(-1/4)*(i sqrt(15)/4) + (i sqrt(15)/4)^2=1/16 -i sqrt(15)/8 -15/16= (1 -15)/16 -i sqrt(15)/8= -14/16 -i sqrt(15)/8= -7/8 -i sqrt(15)/8.

So, 1 + z + z²=1 + (-1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4) + (-7/8 -i sqrt(15)/8).

Compute the real parts:1 -1/4 -7/8= (8/8 -2/8 -7/8)= (-1/8).

Imaginary parts: sqrt(15)/4 - sqrt(15)/8= (2sqrt(15)/8 - sqrt(15)/8)= sqrt(15)/8.

So, 1 + z + z²= -1/8 +i sqrt(15)/8.

Compute modulus: sqrt( (-1/8)^2 + (sqrt(15)/8)^2 )= sqrt(1/64 +15/64)=sqrt(16/64)=sqrt(1/4)=1/2.

So, |1 + z + z²|=1/2.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, so previously, I thought |1 + z + z²|=sqrt(6)/2≈1.2247, but now, computing directly, it's 1/2.

Wait, so my earlier mistake was in computing |1 + z + z²|, I incorrectly assumed it to be |2cosθ -1|, which is only part of the story.

Wait, in fact, when I computed it directly for z=arccos(-1/4), I got |1 + z + z²|=1/2.

But earlier, I thought it was 3/2, which was incorrect.

Wait, so now, what's the correct value?

Wait, when I compute |1 + z + z²| directly, it's 1/2.

But according to the formula, |1 + z + z²|=|1 - z + z²|, which was |2cosθ -1|=3/2 when θ=arccos(-1/4), but in reality, when I computed it, it's 1/2.

So, that suggests that my formula |1 + z + z²|=|2cosθ -1| is incorrect.

Therefore, my earlier conclusion was wrong.

So, how to resolve this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming |1 + z + z²|=|2cosθ -1|. Let me re-examine.

We have |1 + z + z²| = |1 - z + z²|?

Wait, no, 1 + z + z² is different from 1 - z + z².

So, I was wrong in equating them.

Therefore, my mistake was in assuming |1 + z + z²|=|2cosθ -1|, which is incorrect.

Therefore, need to compute |1 + z + z²| correctly.

So, let's compute |1 + z + z²| when z= e^{iθ}, θ=arccos(-1/4).

Compute 1 + z + z²=1 + (-1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4) + (-7/8 -i sqrt(15)/8)=1 -1/4 -7/8 + i (sqrt(15)/4 - sqrt(15)/8)= (8/8 -2/8 -7/8)= (-1/8) + i (sqrt(15)/8).

Therefore, modulus is sqrt( (-1/8)^2 + (sqrt(15)/8)^2 )= sqrt(1/64 +15/64)=sqrt(16/64)=sqrt(1/4)=1/2.

So, |1 + z + z²|=1/2.

Therefore, the expression |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²| when z=arccos(-1/4) is:

sqrt(6)/2 + 1/2= (sqrt(6) +1)/2≈(2.449 +1)/2≈1.724.

But earlier, I thought it was 13/4=3.25, which was incorrect.

So, that suggests that the maximum is higher.

Wait, but at t=π/6, |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|=sqrt(6)/2 +1/2≈1.724.

But at t=arccos(-1/4), the sum is ≈1.724.

But wait, when t=arccos(-1/4), we have |1 + z|=sqrt(6)/2≈1.2247, and |1 - z + z²|=1/2=0.5, so sum≈1.2247+0.5≈1.7247.

But earlier, when I thought |1 - z + z²|=3/2, which was wrong, but now, I see that it's actually 1/2.

So, that suggests that the maximum is actually higher.

Wait, but how?

Wait, the function f(t)= |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|=2|cos(t/2)| + |2cosθ -1|, where θ=t.

But when θ=arccos(-1/4), cosθ=-1/4, so |2cosθ -1|=| -1/2 -1|=3/2=1.5.

But in reality, when I computed it, it was 1/2.

Wait, so perhaps my mistake was in the substitution.

Wait, no, in the direct computation, when I plugged in z= e^{iθ}= -1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4, I got |1 + z + z²|=1/2, which is different from |2cosθ -1|=3/2.

So, my earlier step where I thought |1 + z + z²|=|2cosθ -1| was incorrect.

Therefore, actually, |1 + z + z²| cannot be expressed as |2cosθ -1|.

Therefore, my previous approach was flawed.

So, in order to correctly compute |1 + z + z²|, I must perform the calculation directly.

But perhaps I can express |1 + z + z²| in terms of θ.

Wait, since z= e^{iθ}, then 1 + z + z²=1 + e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}.

Expressed as a complex number: 1 + e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}.

Let me compute the modulus squared:

|1 + e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}|² = (1 + cosθ + cos2θ)^2 + (sinθ + sin2θ)^2.

Let me expand this:

=1 + 2cosθ + 2cos2θ + cos²θ + 2cosθ cos2θ + cos²2θ + sin²θ + 2sinθ sin2θ + sin²2θ.

Simplify term by term:

1 + sin²θ + cos²θ + sin²2θ + cos²2θ + 2cosθ + 2cos2θ + 2sinθ sin2θ + 2cosθ cos2θ.

Note that cos²θ + sin²θ=1, cos²2θ + sin²2θ=1, so 1 +1 +1=3.

Now, remaining terms:

2cosθ + 2cos2θ + 2sinθ sin2θ + 2cosθ cos2θ.

Let me factor 2:

2[cosθ + cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ + cosθ cos2θ].

Now, notice that cosθ cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ=cos(2θ -θ)=cosθ.

Similarly, cosθ + cos2θ + cosθ=2cosθ + cos2θ.

So, expression becomes:

2[2cosθ + cos2θ].

So, overall:

|1 + z + z²|²=3 + 2[2cosθ + cos2θ] + [2cosθ + cos2θ]².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no.

Wait, let's correct that.

Wait, the expression inside was:

2[cosθ + cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ + cosθ cos2θ].

Which is 2[cosθ + cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ + cosθ cos2θ].

Now, group terms:

=2[cosθ + cosθ cos2θ + cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ].

Notice that cosθ cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ=cos(2θ -θ)=cosθ.

So, expression becomes:

2[cosθ + cosθ + cos2θ]=2[2cosθ + cos2θ].

Therefore, |1 + z + z²|²=3 + 2(2cosθ + cos2θ).

Wait, no, wait, no, wait.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in factoring.

Wait, no, because we had:

|1 + z + z²|²=3 + 2[cosθ + cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ + cosθ cos2θ].

But the term inside the brackets was [cosθ + cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ + cosθ cos2θ]=cosθ + cosθ cos2θ + cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ=cosθ(1 + cos2θ) + cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ.

Wait, not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe factor differently.

Wait, let me think differently.

Express cosθ + cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ + cosθ cos2θ.

Let me group cosθ + cosθ cos2θ=cosθ(1 + cos2θ).

Similarly, cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ=cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ.

But perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps use the identity for cos(A) + cos(B)=2cos((A+B)/2)cos((A-B)/2).

But in this case, we have cosθ + cosθ cos2θ + cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ.

Hmm, not directly.

Alternatively, maybe factor out cosθ:

cosθ(1 + cos2θ) + cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ.

But this is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute |1 + z + z²| for z= e^{iθ}= -1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4.

We did that earlier, and found that |1 + z + z²|=1/2.

So, |1 + z + z²|=1/2.

Thus, at t=arccos(-1/4), |1 + z|=sqrt(6)/2≈1.2247, and |1 - z + z²|=1/2=0.5, so total≈1.7247.

But in the previous case, when t=π/6, we had |1 + z|=sqrt(6)/2≈1.2247, and |1 - z + z²|=1/2≈0.5, same as above.

Wait, but when t increases, |1 + z + z²| decreases?

Wait, no, perhaps the other way.

Wait, but in any case, when t=arccos(-1/4), |1 + z + z²|=1/2, and |1 - z + z²|=1/2.

So, the total sum is 1.

Wait, no, when t=arccos(-1/4), |1 + z + z²|=1/2, and |1 - z + z²|=|2cosθ -1|=3/2.

But earlier, when I thought |1 - z + z²|=3/2, that was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps in this case, when t=arccos(-1/4), |1 - z + z²|=|2cosθ -1|= |-1/2 -1|=3/2.

But in reality, when I computed it, it's 1/2.

Wait, so this is conflicting.

Wait, confusion arises because in one case, |1 - z + z²| is computed as 3/2, but in reality, it's 1/2.

Therefore, my earlier assumption was incorrect.

Therefore, perhaps |1 - z + z²|= |2cosθ -1| is not correct for all θ.

Wait, perhaps I need to correct this.

Wait, no, in fact, in general, |1 - z + z²|=|1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}|.

Let me compute this as follows:

1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}=1 - e^{iθ} + (e^{iθ})².

Let me write this as 1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}= e^{i2θ} - e^{iθ} +1.

Let me factor e^{iθ}:

e^{iθ}(e^{iθ} -1) +1.

But not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps compute modulus squared:

|1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}|²= (1 - cosθ + cos2θ)^2 + (sinθ - sin2θ)^2.

Compute:

=1 - 2cosθ + cos²θ + 2cos2θ - 2cosθ cos2θ + cos²2θ + sin²θ - 2sinθ sin2θ + sin²2θ.

Simplify:

1 +1 +1 -2cosθ + 2cos2θ -2cosθ cos2θ -2sinθ sin2θ + cos²θ + cos²2θ + sin²θ + sin²2θ.

Wait, cos²θ + sin²θ=1, cos²2θ + sin²2θ=1.

So, 1 +1 +1=3.

Then, remaining terms:

-2cosθ + 2cos2θ -2cosθ cos2θ -2sinθ sin2θ +1.

So,

3 -2cosθ + 2cos2θ -2(cosθ cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ).

But cosθ cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ=cos(2θ -θ)=cosθ.

So, expression becomes:

3 -2cosθ + 2cos2θ -2cosθ=3 -4cosθ + 2cos2θ.

Thus,

|1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}|²=3 -4cosθ + 2cos2θ.

Therefore,

|1 - e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ}|=sqrt(3 -4cosθ + 2cos2θ).

So, in general, |1 - z + z²|=sqrt(3 -4cosθ + 2cos2θ).

But let me compute this for θ=arccos(-1/4):

cosθ=-1/4, cos2θ=2cos²θ -1=2*(1/16) -1=1/8 -1=-7/8.

So,

sqrt(3 -4*(-1/4) + 2*(-7/8))=sqrt(3 +1 -14/8)=sqrt(4 -1.75)=sqrt(2.25)=1.5=3/2.

So, yes, |1 - z + z²|=3/2 when θ=arccos(-1/4).

But when I computed it directly earlier, I got 1/2, which was a mistake.

Therefore, correct computation is |1 - z + z²|=3/2.

Wait, so that suggests that my earlier step was wrong, but in reality, |1 - z + z²|=3/2.

So, at θ=arccos(-1/4), |1 - z + z²|=3/2, and |1 + z|=sqrt(6)/2.

So, the expression |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|=sqrt(6)/2 +3/2≈1.2247 +1.5≈2.7247.

Wait, that's higher than the previous 1.7247.

So, this is a better candidate for maximum.

Therefore, perhaps the maximum is sqrt(6)/2 + 3/2.

Wait, so that's approximately 2.7247.

But is there a higher value?

Wait, going back to the function f(t)=4|cos t| + |2cos2t -1|.

At t=arccos(-1/4), f(t)=4*(1/4) + |2*(-1/4) -1|=1 + | -1/2 -1|=1 + 3/2=5/2=2.5.

Wait, that contradicts previous.

Wait, wait, no, no.

Wait, f(t)=4|cos t| + |2cos2t -1|.

At t=arccos(-1/4):

|cos t|=1/4, so 4|cos t|=1.

|2cos2t -1|=|2*(-1/2)-1|=| -1 -1|=2.

So, f(t)=1 +2=3.

Wait, that's different.

Wait, so 4|cos t| + |2cos2t -1| at t=arccos(-1/4)=4*(1/4) + |2*(-1/2) -1|=1 + | -1 -1|=1 +2=3.

So, total f(t)=3.

But when I computed |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|, it was sqrt(6)/2 +3/2≈2.7247, which is less than 3.

So, which one is correct.

Wait, confusion arises because different expressions.

Wait, no, f(t)=|1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|.

And when z=e^{iθ}=cosθ +i sinθ, then |1 + z|=2|cos(t/2)|.

And |1 - z + z²|=|2cosθ -1|.

But when θ=arccos(-1/4):

|1 + z|=2|cos(arccos(-1/4)/2)|=2|cos(arccos(-1/4)/2)|.

But arccos(-1/4)/2 is an angle whose cosine is cos(arccos(-1/4)/2)=sqrt[(1 + cos(arccos(-1/4)))/2]=sqrt[(1 -1/4)/2]=sqrt[3/8]=sqrt6/4≈0.612.

Therefore, |1 + z|=2*sqrt6/4=sqrt6/2≈1.2247.

And |1 - z + z²|=|2cosθ -1|=| -1/2 -1|=3/2.

So, sum≈1.2247 +1.5≈2.7247.

But according to f(t)=4|cos t| + |2cos2t -1|, at t=arccos(-1/4):

4|cos t|=4*(1/4)=1,

|2cos2t -1|=|2*(-1/2)-1|=| -1 -1|=2,

so f(t)=1 +2=3.

So, which is correct?

Wait, confusion is arising from different expressions.

Wait, let me check.

Let me compute |1 - z + z²|.

z= e^{iθ}= -1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4.

Compute 1 - z + z².

1 - z + z²=1 - (-1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4) + (-1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4)^2.

Compute:

1 - (-1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4)=1 +1/4 -i sqrt(15)/4=5/4 -i sqrt(15)/4.

Compute z²= (-1/4 +i sqrt(15)/4)^2= (-1/4)^2 + 2*(-1/4)(i sqrt(15)/4) + (i sqrt(15)/4)^2=1/16 -i sqrt(15)/8 -15/16= (1 -15)/16 -i sqrt(15)/8= -14/16 -i sqrt(15)/8= -7/8 -i sqrt(15)/8.

So, 1 - z + z²= (5/4 -i sqrt(15)/4) + (-7/8 -i sqrt(15)/8)= (10/8 -7/8) + (-sqrt(15)/4 - sqrt(15)/8)=3/8 - 3sqrt(15)/8.

Therefore, real part=3/8, imaginary part=-3sqrt(15)/8.

Thus, modulus= sqrt( (3/8)^2 + (3sqrt(15)/8)^2 )= sqrt(9/64 + 135/64)=sqrt(144/64)=sqrt(9/4)=3/2.

So, |1 - z + z²|=3/2.

Therefore, |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|=sqrt(6)/2 +3/2≈1.2247 +1.5≈2.7247.

But according to f(t)=4|cos t| + |2cos2t -1|, at t=arccos(-1/4), f(t)=3.

But according to direct computation, it's≈2.7247.

Therefore, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expressing f(t).

Wait, earlier, I wrote |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²| as 2|cos(t/2)| + |2cos2t -1|.

But that is incorrect.

Wait, because |1 + z|=2|cos(t/2)|, but when t=arccos(-1/4), t/2 is not the same as t.

Wait, that is, the angle t is θ=arccos(-1/4), so t/2 is different.

So, |1 + z| is 2|cos(t/2)|, but not 2|cos(t)|.

Therefore, earlier, f(t)=2|cos(t/2)| + |2cos2t -1|, which is not equal to 4|cos t| + |2cos2t -1|.

Therefore, that was an incorrect assumption.

Therefore, the function f(t) is not equal to 4|cos t| + |2cos2t -1|, but rather, when z= e^{iθ}=cosθ +i sinθ, |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|=2|cos(t/2)| + |2cosθ -1|.

Therefore, it is 2|cos(t/2)| + |2cosθ -1|.

Thus, my mistake was in assuming f(t)=4|cos t| + |2cos2t -1|, which is incorrect.

Therefore, to find the maximum, we must use the correct expression: f(t)=2|cos(t/2)| + |2cosθ -1|, where θ=arccos(cos t).

Therefore, f(t)=2|cos(t/2)| + |2cos(arccos(cos t)) -1|=2|cos(t/2)| + |2cos t -1|.

Therefore, f(t)=2|cos(t/2)| + |2cos t -1|.

So, that's the correct function.

Therefore, to find f(t)=2|cos(t/2)| + |2cos t -1|, t ∈ [0, π].

So, now, we can analyze f(t).

Given that t ∈ [0, π], cos t ∈ [-1,1], and cos(t/2) ∈ [0,1].

Thus, |cos(t/2)|=cos(t/2).

Therefore, f(t)=2cos(t/2) + |2cos t -1|.

So, f(t)=2cos(t/2) + |2cos t -1|.

So, to find the maximum of f(t) over t ∈ [0, π].

Now, let's analyze the function f(t)=2cos(t/2) + |2cos t -1|.

We can split it into two cases based on the sign of 2cos t -1.

Case 1: 2cos t -1 ≥0 ⇒ cos t ≥1/2.

Case 2: 2cos t -1 <0 ⇒ cos t <1/2.

In Case 1: cos t ≥1/2.

Which implies t ∈ [0, π/3] ∪ [5π/3, π], but since t ∈ [0, π], it's t ∈ [0, π/3].

In Case 2: cos t <1/2.

Which implies t ∈ (π/3, 5π/3), but since t ∈ [0, π], it's t ∈ (π/3, π].

Therefore, f(t)=2cos(t/2) + (2cos t -1) when t ∈ [0, π/3].

And f(t)=2cos(t/2) + (1 - 2cos t) when t ∈ (π/3, π].

So, let's define f(t) as:

f(t)=2cos(t/2) + 2cos t -1, for t ∈ [0, π/3].

f(t)=2cos(t/2) +1 - 2cos t, for t ∈ (π/3, π].

Now, let's analyze each interval separately.

First, t ∈ [0, π/3].

Define f(t)=2cos(t/2) + 2cos t -1.

Compute derivative to find extrema.

But before that, maybe it's easier to compute f(t) at critical points and endpoints.

Compute f(t) at t=0:

f(0)=2cos(0) + 2cos0 -1=2*1 +2*1 -1=2 +2 -1=3.

At t=π/3≈1.047:

f(π/3)=2cos(π/6) +2cos(π/3) -1=2*(sqrt(3)/2) +2*(1/2)-1=sqrt(3) +1 -1=sqrt(3)≈1.732.

At t=π/2≈1.571:

f(π/2)=2cos(π/4) +2cos(π/2) -1=2*(sqrt(2)/2) +0 -1=sqrt(2) -1≈1.414 -1=0.414.

At t=π/6≈0.523:

f(π/6)=2cos(π/12) +2cos(π/6) -1≈2*(0.9659) +2*(0.8660)-1≈1.9318 +1.732 -1≈2.6638.

Wait, but that's in the first interval, t ∈ [0, π/3].

Wait, π/6≈0.523 is within [0, π/3≈1.047].

So, f(π/6)≈2.6638.

Wait, but earlier, at t=arccos(-1/4), f(t)=2cos(t/2) + |2cos t -1|. But t=arccos(-1/4)= arccos(-1/4)≈1.968, which is beyond π/3≈1.047, so it's in the second case.

So, perhaps the maximum in the first case is≈2.6638.

Now, moving to the second case, t ∈ (π/3, π].

Define f(t)=2cos(t/2) +1 -2cos t.

Compute f(t) at t=π/3≈1.047:

f(π/3)=2cos(π/6) +1 -2cos(π/3)=2*(sqrt(3)/2) +1 -2*(1/2)=sqrt(3) +1 -1=sqrt(3)≈1.732.

At t=π≈3.1416:

f(π)=2cos(π/2) +1 -2cos π=2*0 +1 -2*(-1)=0 +1 +2=3.

At t=π/2≈1.571:

f(π/2)=2cos(π/4) +1 -2cos(π/2)=2*(sqrt(2)/2) +1 -0= sqrt(2) +1≈1.414 +1≈2.414.

At t=2π/3≈2.094:

f(2π/3)=2cos(π/3) +1 -2cos(2π/3)=2*(1/2)+1 -2*(-1/2)=1 +1 +1=3.

At t=arccos(-1/4)≈1.968:

f(t)=2cos(1.968/2) +1 -2cos(1.968).

Compute cos(1.968/2)=cos(0.984)≈0.550.

cos(1.968)≈-0.416.

So,

f(t)=2*0.550 +1 -2*(-0.416)=1.1 +1 +0.832≈2.932.

At t=π/3≈1.047:

f(t)=sqrt(3)≈1.732.

At t=π/2≈1.571:

f(t)=sqrt(2)+1≈2.414.

At t=π/4≈0.785:

Wait, but t=π/4≈0.785, which is less than π/3≈1.047, so it's in the first case.

Wait, so in the second case, t ∈ (π/3, π], we have f(t)=2cos(t/2) +1 -2cos t.

Compute f(t) at t=2.094≈2π/3:

f(t)=2cos(π/3) +1 -2cos(2π/3)=2*(1/2)+1 -2*(-1/2)=1 +1 +1=3.

At t=1.968≈arccos(-1/4):

As above, f(t)≈2.932.

At t=1.571≈π/2:

f(t)=sqrt(2)+1≈2.414.

At t=1.745≈arccos(-0.5)=2π/3:

Wait, t=arccos(-0.5)=2π/3≈2.094, which is in the second case.

So, at t=2π/3≈2.094, f(t)=3.

Therefore, in the second case, the maximum is 3.

Comparing the two cases:

First case: t ∈ [0, π/3], maximum≈2.6638.

Second case: t ∈ (π/3, π], maximum=3.

So, the overall maximum is 3.

But wait, when t=2π/3≈2.094, which is in the second case, f(t)=3.

So, is 3 the maximum value?

But when t=2π/3, z= e^{i2π/3}= -1/2 +i sqrt(3)/2.

Compute |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|.

Compute 1 + z=1 + (-1/2 +i sqrt(3)/2)=1/2 +i sqrt(3)/2.

Modulus= sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 )=sqrt(1/4 +3/4)=sqrt(1)=1.

Compute 1 - z + z².

z= -1/2 +i sqrt(3)/2.

z²= (-1/2)^2 + 2*(-1/2)(i sqrt(3)/2) + (i sqrt(3)/2)^2=1/4 -i sqrt(3)/2 -3/4= -1/2 -i sqrt(3)/2.

Thus, 1 - z + z²=1 - (-1/2 +i sqrt(3)/2) + (-1/2 -i sqrt(3)/2)=1 +1/2 -i sqrt(3)/2 -1/2 -i sqrt(3)/2=1 +0 -i sqrt(3)=1 -i sqrt(3).

Modulus= sqrt(1^2 + (sqrt(3))^2)=sqrt(1 +3)=2.

Therefore, |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|=1 +2=3.

Therefore, at t=2π/3, which is in the second case, the sum is 3.

Therefore, the maximum is 3.

But wait, let's check t=π, which is the endpoint.

At t=π:

z= e^{iπ}= -1.

Compute |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|=|1 -1| + |1 - (-1) + (-1)^2|=0 + |1 +1 +1|=3.

Thus, at t=π, sum is 3.

So, in both cases, at t=2π/3 and t=π, the sum is 3.

Therefore, the maximum value is 3.

But let me check another point, say t=π/2≈1.571.

At t=π/2:

z= e^{iπ/2}=i.

Compute |1 + z| + |1 - z + z²|=|1 +i| + |1 -i + (-1)|=sqrt(2) +0≈1.414.

Which is less than 3.

Therefore, maximum is 3.

Thus, the maximum value is 3.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
</think>

Given \( z = e^{i z} \) where \( z \) is a complex number, we need to find the maximum value of the expression \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \).

First, we note that \( z \) lies on the unit circle, so we can write \( z = e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \) is a real number. This transforms the expression into terms of trigonometric functions.

We express \( |1 + z| \) and \( |1 - z + z^2| \) in terms of trigonometric functions:
- \( |1 + z| = 2|\cos(\theta/2)| \)
- \( |1 - z + z^2| = |2\cos\theta - 1| \)

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[ f(\theta) = 2|\cos(\theta/2)| + |2\cos\theta - 1| \]

We analyze this function over the interval \( \theta \in [0, 2\pi] \). However, since \( \cos\theta \) is periodic with period \( 2\pi \), we can consider \( \theta \in [0, \pi] \) and use the properties of the cosine function.

We find that the function \( f(\theta) \) has different cases based on the value of \( \cos\theta \):
1. When \( \cos\theta \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\theta) = 2\cos(\theta/2) + (2\cos\theta - 1) \).
2. When \( \cos\theta < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\theta) = 2\cos(\theta/2) + (1 - 2\cos\theta) \).

We compute the function at critical points and endpoints:
- At \( \theta = 0 \), \( f(0) = 3 \).
- At \( \theta = \pi/3 \approx 1.047 \), \( f(\pi/3) \approx 1.732 \).
- At \( \theta = \pi/2 \approx 1.571 \), \( f(\pi/2) \approx 1.414 \).
- At \( \theta = \pi \), \( f(\pi) = 3 \).

We also check the point \( \theta = 2\pi/3 \approx 2.094 \) and \( \theta = \pi \) where the function reaches 3.

Thus, the maximum value of the expression \( |1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2| \) is found to be 3.

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
