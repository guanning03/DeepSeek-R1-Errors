Correct Answer:
From $\triangle PQR$, we have $\angle R = 180^\circ - \angle Q - \angle P = 105^\circ$.  Since $\overline{ST}\parallel \overline{QR}$, we have $\angle STR = 180^\circ - \angle R = \boxed{75^\circ}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, let me try to figure out how to find the measure of angle STR in this diagram. So, we have triangle PQR with ST parallel to QR. Angle P is 40 degrees, and angle Q is 35 degrees. I need to find angle STR. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when two lines are parallel, the corresponding angles are equal. Since ST is parallel to QR, maybe I can use some properties of parallel lines here. But I'm not exactly sure which angles correspond. Let me see.

Looking at the Asymptote code, it seems like there's a point S on PT, and T is somewhere along the extension of PR. So, S is between P and T, and T is beyond R. That makes triangle STR, which is part of triangle PQR. Hmm, maybe I can use similar triangles here because of the parallel lines.

Wait, similar triangles have proportional sides and equal angles. If ST is parallel to QR, then triangle PST should be similar to triangle PQR. Let me check that. If angle P is common to both triangles PST and PQR, and since ST is parallel to QR, the corresponding angles at S and Q should be equal. So, yes, by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion, triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR.

Okay, so triangle PST ~ triangle PQR. That means the corresponding sides are proportional, and the corresponding angles are equal. So, angle at S in triangle PST corresponds to angle at Q in triangle PQR, which is 35 degrees. Similarly, angle at T corresponds to angle at R, and angle at P is common, which is 40 degrees.

Wait, but in the diagram, angle STR is at point S, right? Let me see, angle STR is the angle at S between lines ST and SR. So, in triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which we need to find. Since triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR, the angles should correspond. So, angle at S in triangle PST corresponds to angle at R in triangle PQR. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me try to write down the known angles. In triangle PQR, we have angle at P is 40 degrees, angle at Q is 35 degrees. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, angle at R is 180 - 40 - 35 = 105 degrees. So, angle QRP is 105 degrees.

Since triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR, their corresponding angles should be equal. So, angle at P in triangle PST is same as in triangle PQR, which is 40 degrees. Angle at Q in triangle PST is same as angle R in triangle PQR, which is 105 degrees. Wait, but angle at Q in triangle PST is at point S, which is angle PST, not angle STR.

Hmm, maybe I need to think about the angles in triangle STR. In triangle STR, we have angle at S, which is angle STR, angle at T, and angle at R. Since triangle PST ~ triangle PQR, angle at S in triangle PST is equal to angle at R in triangle PQR, which is 105 degrees. But wait, is that the case?

Wait, maybe I need to look at the correspondence of the triangles more carefully. Let me denote the order of the similarity. If triangle PST ~ triangle PQR, then vertex P corresponds to P, S corresponds to Q, and T corresponds to R. So, angle at S in triangle PST is equal to angle at Q in triangle PQR, which is 35 degrees. Similarly, angle at T in triangle PST is equal to angle at R in triangle PQR, which is 105 degrees.

So, in triangle PST, angle at S is 35 degrees. But in triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which is between ST and SR. So, is angle STR equal to angle PST, which is 35 degrees? Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.

In triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which is our target. Since triangle PST ~ triangle PQR, angle at S in triangle PST is 35 degrees, which corresponds to angle at R in triangle PQR, but in triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which is at point S between lines ST and SR. So, maybe angle STR is equal to angle PST, which is 35 degrees.

But wait, in triangle STR, the sum of angles should be 180 degrees. So, angle at S is 35 degrees, angle at R is... hmm, what's angle at R in triangle STR? It's angle STR, so that's 35 degrees. Then angle at T would be 180 - 35 - angle at T. Wait, but I don't know angle at T yet.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the fact that ST is parallel to QR. So, by the basic proportionality theorem (Thales' theorem), the line ST divides the sides PR and PQ proportionally. But I don't know if that helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of alternate interior angles. Since ST is parallel to QR, and PT is a transversal, the angle at T in triangle PQR, which is angle QRP, which is 105 degrees, is equal to the angle at S in triangle STR, which is angle STR. Wait, is that correct?

Hold on, if ST is parallel to QR, then angle at S in triangle STR is equal to angle at R in triangle PQR. But angle at R in triangle PQR is 105 degrees, so angle STR should be 105 degrees. But that seems too large because in triangle STR, the other angles would be too small. Let me check.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the angles. Let me try to label the diagram again.

Point S is on PT, closer to P. So, triangle PST is part of triangle PQR. Angle at S in triangle PST is equal to angle at Q in triangle PQR, which is 35 degrees. So, angle PST = 35 degrees. Then, in triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which is equal to angle PST, which is 35 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe angle STR is equal to angle PQR, which is 35 degrees. Hmm, but in the diagram, angle Q is 35 degrees, but angle STR is at a different location.

Alternatively, since ST is parallel to QR, the angle between PT and ST is equal to the angle between PT and QR. So, angle at T in triangle PQR is 105 degrees, which would correspond to angle at S in triangle STR. Wait, but that would make angle STR = 105 degrees.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting results here. Let me try to approach it more systematically.

We have triangle PQR with angle P = 40°, angle Q = 35°, so angle R = 105°. ST is parallel to QR, so angle PST = angle Q = 35°, as they are corresponding angles. Thus, in triangle PST, angle at S is 35°, angle at P is 40°, so angle at T is 180 - 35 - 40 = 105°, which is equal to angle R in triangle PQR. Therefore, triangle PST ~ triangle PQR by AA similarity.

Thus, the angles in triangle STR correspond to those in triangle PQR. So, angle at S in triangle STR is angle STR, which corresponds to angle at R in triangle PQR, which is 105°. Therefore, angle STR is 105°. But wait, that seems too large because in triangle STR, the other angles would be too small, and if angle STR is 105°, the sum would exceed 180°. Maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, in triangle STR, angle at R is the same as angle at Q in triangle PQR, which is 35°. Wait, that might not be the case. Let me clarify.

Wait, triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR. So, the order of similarity is important. If triangle PST ~ triangle PQR, then angle P corresponds to angle P, angle S corresponds to angle Q, and angle T corresponds to angle R. Therefore, angle at S in triangle PST is equal to angle at Q in triangle PQR, which is 35°, and angle at T in triangle PST is equal to angle at R in triangle PQR, which is 105°, as before.

Therefore, in triangle STR, angle at S is equal to angle at S in triangle PST, which is 35°, angle at R is equal to angle at R in triangle PQR, which is 105°, so angle at T would be 180 - 35 - 105 = 40°. Hmm, that seems more reasonable.

Wait, but angle STR is at point S, so in triangle STR, angle at S is 35°, angle at R is 105°, so angle at T is 40°, which is the same as angle at P in triangle PQR. That seems consistent.

But wait, if angle STR is 35°, is that correct? Hmm, let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the concept of alternate interior angles. Since ST is parallel to QR, the angle between PT and ST is equal to the angle between PT and QR. The angle at T in triangle PQR is angle QRP, which is 105°, so the angle at S in triangle STR, which is angle STR, is equal to 105°. But that seems too large.

Wait, no, because angle STR is at point S, which is a different angle. Let me try to think about the lines.

In triangle PQR, angle at R is 105°, which is the angle between QR and PR. Since ST is parallel to QR, the angle between ST and PR would be equal to angle R, which is 105°, but that's at point R, not at point S.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me draw this out mentally. So, ST is parallel to QR, so if I extend PR to a point T, then angle at S between PT and ST should be equal to angle at Q in triangle PQR, which is 35°, because they are corresponding angles.

So, angle at S in triangle PST is 35°, which is angle PST. Then, in triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which is the same as angle PST, so angle STR is 35°. Hmm, but in that case, in triangle STR, angles would be 35°, 105°, and 40°, which adds up to 180°, so that works.

Wait, but earlier I thought angle STR was 105°, but that led to inconsistency. So, which is correct?

Wait, let me think about the lines. ST is parallel to QR. So, the angle between ST and PT is equal to the angle between QR and PR, which is angle QRP, which is 105°, but that's at point R, not at point S.

Alternatively, the angle between ST and PR would be equal to angle R, which is 105°, but at point T.

Wait, perhaps I confused the corresponding angles. Let me recall: when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal.

So, line PT is the transversal cutting the two parallel lines ST and QR. So, angle at S (between PT and ST) corresponds to angle at Q (between PT and QR). So, angle PST = angle QRP.

But angle QRP is 105°, so angle PST is 105°. Wait, but that can't be because in triangle PQR, angle at R is 105°, but angle PST is part of triangle PST.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify:

- Line PT is a transversal cutting the parallel lines ST and QR.
- Therefore, angle at S (angle PST) and angle at Q (angle PQR) are corresponding angles and should be equal.
- But angle PQR is 35°, so angle PST is 35°, not 105°. That makes sense. So, angle PST is 35°, which is equal to angle QRP, which is 105°? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 35° ≠ 105°.

Wait, that can't be. There must be a miscalculation here.

Wait, no, angle PST is at point S, between PT and ST. Similarly, angle PQR is at point Q, between PQ and QR. Since ST is parallel to QR, angle PST should be equal to angle PQR due to the corresponding angles theorem.

But angle PQR is 35°, so angle PST is 35°. That makes sense.

Therefore, in triangle PST, angle at S is 35°, angle at P is 40°, so angle at T is 180 - 35 - 40 = 105°, which is equal to angle R in triangle PQR, which is 105°. So, triangle PST ~ triangle PQR by AA similarity.

Therefore, corresponding angles are equal. So, angle at S in triangle PST (angle PST = 35°) corresponds to angle at R in triangle PQR (which is 105°). Wait, that doesn't make sense because 35° ≠ 105°. So, perhaps I'm mixing up the correspondence.

Wait, perhaps triangle PST is similar to triangle QRP instead? Because in triangle PST, angle at S is 35°, which is equal to angle at Q in triangle PQR (35°), and angle at P is 40°, which is equal to angle at P in triangle PQR (40°). Therefore, triangle PST ~ triangle PQR with the correspondence S -> Q, T -> R, P -> P. So, angle PST corresponds to angle PQR, angle PST corresponds to angle QRP, and angle T corresponds to angle P.

Wait, that might be the correct correspondence. So, angle PST = angle PQR = 35°, angle PST = angle QRP = 105°, and angle T = angle P = 40°. Therefore, triangle PST ~ triangle PQR with similarity ratio.

Therefore, in triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which corresponds to angle PQR (35°). Similarly, angle at R is 105°, and angle at T is 40°. So, angle STR is 35°, which seems to make sense.

Wait, but earlier I thought angle STR was 105°, but that was incorrect because triangle STR's angles need to add up to 180°. If angle STR is 35°, angle at R is 105°, and angle at T is 40°, that adds up to 180°, which is correct.

But let me confirm using another method. Maybe using the concept of alternate interior angles.

Since ST is parallel to QR, and PT is a transversal, the angle between PT and ST at S is equal to the angle between PT and QR at Q. So, angle PST = angle PQR = 35°. So, in triangle PST, angle at S is 35°, angle at P is 40°, so angle at T is 105°, which is equal to angle R in triangle PQR.

Therefore, in triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which is equal to angle PST, which is 35°, angle at R is angle SRT, which is equal to angle QRP in triangle PQR, which is 105°, and angle at T is angle STRS, which would be 180 - 35 - 105 = 40°, which is equal to angle Q in triangle PQR.

Therefore, angle STR is 35°, which is the measure we're looking for.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, point T is defined as R + 0.6*(P - R), which suggests that T is somewhere beyond R from P, but in the code, P is (1.1, 0.5), R is (1,0), so P - R is (0.1, 0.5). So, T is R + 0.6*(P - R) = (1,0) + 0.6*(0.1, 0.5) = (1 + 0.06, 0 + 0.3) = (1.06, 0.3). So, T is just beyond R on the line PR.

Therefore, triangle STR is formed by points S, T, and R. So, in the diagram, S is between P and T, closer to P, so ST is a line segment from S to T, which is beyond R on PR.

Therefore, angle STR is at point S between lines ST and SR. So, in triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which we've determined is 35°, as it's equal to angle PST, which is 35°.

Wait, but in triangle PQR, angle at Q is 35°, but in triangle STR, angle at R is 105°, which is angle SRT. Hmm, perhaps I need to make sure about which angle is which.

Wait, in triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, angle at R is angle SRT, and angle at T is angle STRS (but that's the same as angle at T). Wait, no, in triangle STR, the angles are at S, R, and T.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of triangle STR.

- Point S is on PT, closer to P.
- Point T is beyond R on PR.
- So, triangle STR is a smaller triangle inside triangle PQR.

In triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which is between ST and SR. Angle at R is angle SRT, which is between SR and TR, and angle at T is angle STRS, which is between ST and PT.

Wait, no, in triangle STR, the sides are ST, TR, and SR. So, angle at S is between ST and SR, angle at R is between TR and SR, and angle at T is between ST and PT.

Therefore, since ST is parallel to QR, the angle between ST and PT is equal to the angle between QR and PR, which is angle QRP, which is 105°, as established earlier. Therefore, angle at T in triangle STR is 105°, angle at R is angle SRT, which is equal to angle QRP in triangle PQR, which is 105°, and angle at S is angle STR, which is 35°.

Wait, no, that can't be because angle at T is 105°, angle at R is 105°, and angle at S is 35°, which adds up to 240°, which is more than 180°, which is impossible.

Therefore, my earlier conclusion must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps angle STR is equal to angle QRP, which is 105°, but that would make angle at S 105°, which is more than the sum of the other two angles in triangle STR.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I should use the properties of parallel lines and transversals.

Since ST is parallel to QR, and PT is a transversal, the corresponding angles are equal. So, angle at S (angle PST) is equal to angle at Q (angle PQR). Angle PST is equal to 35°, as angle PQR is 35°, so angle PST is 35°, which is the angle between ST and PT at point S.

Similarly, the alternate interior angles would be angle at T (angle P TS) equal to angle at R (angle PRQ). Wait, but angle P TS is the same as angle T in triangle PQR, which is 105°, so angle P TS is 105°, which would correspond to angle at T in triangle STR.

Wait, this is getting more confusing. Let me try a different approach.

Since ST is parallel to QR, the angle between PT and ST is equal to the angle between PT and QR. The angle between PT and QR is angle QRP, which is 105°, so the angle between PT and ST is also 105°. Therefore, angle PST is 105°, but wait, earlier I thought angle PST is 35°, which contradicts.

Wait, no, angle between PT and QR is angle QRP, which is 105°, so the angle between PT and ST is also 105°, which is angle PST. Therefore, angle PST is 105°, but in triangle PQR, angle at Q is 35°, which is angle PQR. So, angle PST is 105°, which is different from angle PQR.

Hmm, so angle PST is 105°, which is the angle at S in triangle PST, which is similar to triangle PQR. Therefore, triangle PST ~ triangle PQR with a ratio of sides.

But in triangle PST, angle at P is 40°, angle at S is 105°, so angle at T is 180 - 40 - 105 = 35°, which is equal to angle R in triangle PQR. So, triangle PST ~ triangle PQR with angles 40°, 105°, 35°, so the ratio of sides would be consistent.

Therefore, in triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which is equal to angle PST, which is 105°, because in triangle PST, angle at S is 105°, which corresponds to angle at R in triangle PQR, which is 105°. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because angle STR is at point S, which is different from angle PST.

Wait, no, triangle STR is a different triangle. Maybe I need to use the fact that ST is parallel to QR to find the ratio of the sides and then use the properties of similar triangles.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of alternate interior angles again. Since ST is parallel to QR, and PT is a transversal, then angle between ST and PT at S is equal to angle between QR and PT at Q, which is 35°. So, angle between ST and PT is 35°, which is angle SPT. Therefore, in triangle SPT, angle at P is 40°, angle at S is 35°, so angle at T is 105°, which is equal to angle R in triangle PQR.

Therefore, triangle SPT is similar to triangle PQR, with angle at P equal, angle at S equal, angle at T equal. Therefore, the sides correspond as S-P-T ~ P-Q-R.

Therefore, the ratio of sides SP/PR = ST/PQ = PT/QR.

But I don't know the lengths, so maybe this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, maybe using the law of sines in triangle PQR.

In triangle PQR, sides are proportional to the sines of the opposite angles.

So, side PQ / sin(angle R) = QR / sin(angle P) = PR / sin(angle Q).

Given angle P = 40°, angle Q = 35°, angle R = 105°, so sides are proportional as:

PQ / sin(105°) = QR / sin(40°) = PR / sin(35°).

But I don't know the side lengths, but maybe I can find the ratio.

In triangle STR, angle at S is angle STR, which we need to find.

Wait, in triangle STR, we have angle at R, which is angle SRT, which is equal to angle QRP in triangle PQR, which is 105°, so angle SRT is 105°, angle at S is angle STR, which is equal to angle PST, which is 105°, and angle at T is angle STRS, which is equal to angle at T in triangle PQR, which is 40°, so 180 - 105 - 40 = 35°.

Wait, so angle STR is 35°, angle SRT is 105°, angle STRS is 40°, which adds up to 180°, so that works.

But in this case, angle STR is 35°, which is equal to angle PQR, which is 35°, which also makes sense because of the parallel lines.

Wait, but earlier I thought angle STR was 105°, but that was incorrect because that would make the sum of angles exceed 180°, which is impossible.

So, now I'm more confident that angle STR is 35°, since it's equal to angle PQR, which is given as 35°, and the other angles in triangle STR add up correctly.

Therefore, after all this back and forth, I think angle STR is 35 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The measure of $\angle STR$ is $\boxed{35}$ degrees.
</think>

We have triangle \(PQR\) with \(\overline{ST} \parallel \overline{QR}\), \(\angle P = 40^\circ\), and \(\angle Q = 35^\circ\). We need to find the measure of \(\angle STR\).

1. **Calculate the third angle of triangle \(PQR\)**:
   \[
   \angle R = 180^\circ - \angle P - \angle Q = 180^\circ - 40^\circ - 35^\circ = 105^\circ
   \]

2. **Identify the similarity of triangles \(PST\) and \(PQR\)**:
   - Since \(\overline{ST} \parallel \overline{QR}\), the corresponding angles are equal.
   - \(\angle PST = \angle PQR = 35^\circ\)
   - \(\angle P\) is common to both triangles \(PST\) and \(PQR\)
   - Therefore, triangle \(PST \sim \triangle PQR\) by AA similarity.

3. **Determine the corresponding angles in triangle \(STR\)**:
   - \(\angle STR\) corresponds to \(\angle PQR\) in triangle \(PQR\)
   - Thus, \(\angle STR = \angle PQR = 35^\circ\)

Thus, the measure of \(\angle STR\) is \(\boxed{35}\) degrees.
