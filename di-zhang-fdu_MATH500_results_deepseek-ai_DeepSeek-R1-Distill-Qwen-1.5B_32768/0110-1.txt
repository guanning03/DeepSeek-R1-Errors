Correct Answer:
Since $AB \parallel DE,$ we know that $\angle A = \angle E$ and $\angle B = \angle D.$ That works out nicely, since that means $\triangle ABC \sim EDC.$ If $BD = 4BC,$ that means $CD = BD - BC = 3BC.$ Therefore, the ratio of sides in $ABC$ to $EDC$ is $1:3,$ meaning the ratio of their areas is $1:9.$

Since the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $6\text{ cm}^2,$ that means the area of $\triangle CDE$ is $\boxed{54}\text{ cm}^2.$

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it and understand what's given. The problem says that the area of triangle ABC is 6 square centimeters. There are two lines, AB and DE, which are parallel. Also, BD is four times BC. I need to find the area of triangle CDE.

First, I should probably sketch a rough diagram to get a better idea of the problem. Since I'm not sure about the exact coordinates, I'll try to imagine it. Triangle ABC with points A, B, and C. Points D and E are somewhere else, with BD being four times BC. AB is parallel to DE, so DE must be a translated or scaled version of AB.

Hmm, okay. Since AB is parallel to DE, triangles ABC and CDE might be similar. That often happens with parallel lines. If that's the case, the ratio of their areas would be the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. But wait, I need to confirm if they are similar.

For similarity, the corresponding angles must be equal, and the sides must be in proportion. Since AB is parallel to DE, the corresponding angles at point C should be equal because they are vertical angles or something like that. So, maybe triangles ABC and CDE are similar? Let me see.

Let me denote BC as x. Then BD is 4x, so the entire length of CD would be BC + BD, which is x + 4x = 5x. So, CD is 5x. Now, looking at triangle CDE, which shares the same vertex C as triangle ABC. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ratio of the sides. Since AB is parallel to DE, the ratio of AB to DE would be the same as the ratio of BC to CD. That is, AB/DE = BC/CD. If BC is x and CD is 5x, then the ratio is 1/5. So, AB is (1/5) of DE. So, DE is 5 times AB.

If triangles ABC and CDE are similar, then the ratio of their areas would be the square of the ratio of their sides. So, the ratio of areas would be (1/5)^2 = 1/25. But the area of triangle ABC is 6 cm². Then, the area of triangle CDE would be 6 * (1/25) = 6/25 cm². But that seems really small. Maybe I did something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I got the ratio the other way around. Maybe the ratio of similarity is DE/AB, so 5/1. Then the ratio of areas would be (5)^2 = 25. So, if ABC is 6, then CDE would be 6 * 25 = 150. That doesn't seem right either because the triangle CDE is bigger than ABC. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption about the ratio is incorrect.

Let me try another approach. Maybe it's not the entire triangle, but just a part of it. Let's see, BD is 4BC, so BD:BC is 4:1. So, from point B to D is four times BC. So, point D is beyond C on the line CB extended.

Wait, is that right? If BD is 4BC, that means from point B to D is four times the length from B to C. So, if BC is x, then BD is 4x, so D is at a distance of 4x from B, which would place D 5x away from C. So, BD = 4x, BC = x, so CD = BC + BD = x + 4x = 5x.

Now, since AB is parallel to DE, maybe the triangles ABC and CDE are similar because of the parallel lines. Let me check for similarity.

In triangle ABC and triangle CDE, angle C is common. Also, since AB is parallel to DE, angle BAC is equal to angle DCE (alternate interior angles). Similarly, angle ABC is equal to angle CDE. So, triangles ABC and CDE are similar by AA similarity.

Therefore, the ratio of sides in triangle ABC to triangle CDE is the same as the ratio of BC to CD, which is x to 5x, or 1/5. So, the ratio of similarity is 1:5, meaning each side in triangle ABC is 1/5 the length of the corresponding side in triangle CDE.

Therefore, the area ratio is (1/5)^2 = 1/25. So, area of ABC is 6, so area of CDE would be 6 * 25 = 150 cm². But that seems too large because triangle CDE is part of the figure, but 150 is much bigger. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, actually, triangles ABC and CDE are similar, but they are on different sides. Maybe I need to think about the ratio in another way. Let me try to use coordinate geometry to verify.

Let me assign coordinates to points. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Let me assume that point B is at (-x, 0), and point A is somewhere else, say (0, y). Then, BD is 4 times BC. Since BC is from (-x, 0) to (0,0), which is length x. So BD is 4x. So, point D is located at (-x - 4x, 0) which is (-5x, 0).

Now, AB is from (0, y) to (-x, 0). DE is parallel to AB. So, DE is a line segment starting from D (-5x, 0) and going in the same direction as AB.

First, let me find the slope of AB. AB goes from (-x, 0) to (0, y). So, the slope is (y - 0)/(0 - (-x)) = y/x.

Therefore, DE must have the same slope. So, DE goes from D (-5x, 0) with slope y/x. Let me denote point E as (a, b). Then, the slope from D to E is (b - 0)/(a - (-5x)) = b/(a + 5x) = y/x. So, b = (y/x)(a + 5x).

Now, we need to find the coordinates of point E. But without more information, maybe I can find the ratio of similarity.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the area using coordinates. Since I have coordinates for points A, B, C, D, and need to find the area of triangle CDE.

But to find the coordinates of E, which is partway along DE, parallel to AB.

Wait, since AB is parallel to DE, and DE starts at D, we can parametrize point E.

Let me think. Since DE is parallel to AB, and AB is from (-x, 0) to (0, y). So, AB can be thought of as a vector (-x, y). So, DE should have the same vector.

But point D is at (-5x, 0). So, adding the vector (-x, y) to D would give E at (-5x - x, 0 + y) = (-6x, y). So, point E is at (-6x, y).

Therefore, triangle CDE has points C(0,0), D(-5x,0), and E(-6x, y). Let me compute the area of triangle CDE.

The area of a triangle with coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) can be found using the shoelace formula:

Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|

Plugging in the coordinates:

x1 = 0, y1 = 0
x2 = -5x, y2 = 0
x3 = -6x, y3 = y

So, Area = |(0*(0 - y) + (-5x)*(y - 0) + (-6x)*(0 - 0))/2|
= |0 + (-5x)(y) + (-6x)(0)| / 2
= | -5xy | / 2
= (5xy)/2

But we know that the area of triangle ABC is 6. Let me find the area of triangle ABC.

Points A(0,y), B(-x, 0), C(0,0). Using the shoelace formula:

Area = |0*(0 - 0) + (-x)*(0 - y) + 0*(y - 0)| / 2
= |0 + (-x)(-y) + 0| / 2
= |xy| / 2
= xy/2

Given that the area is 6, so xy/2 = 6 => xy = 12.

Therefore, the area of triangle CDE is (5xy)/2 = (5*12)/2 = 60 / 2 = 30 cm².

Wait, so the area is 30 cm²? But that's in a different calculation. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption about the coordinates is correct, but I think I made a mistake in assigning the coordinates.

Wait, hold on. When I assigned point A at (0, y), point B at (-x, 0), and point C at (0,0), that might not necessarily be a correct coordinate system because in reality, triangle ABC is not necessarily a right triangle. Wait, in the Asymptote code, which I can't see, but from the Asymptote code, it seems that the coordinates are defined as (-.3,-3)--(.1,1)--(-1,0)--(3,0)--cycle.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the coordinates differently. Let me check the Asymptote code.

Looking at the Asymptote code:

draw((-.3,-3)--(.1,1)--(-1,0)--(3,0)--cycle);
label("$A$",(.1,1),N);
label("$B$",(-1,0),W);
label("$C$",(0,0),NE);
label("$D$",(3,0),E);
label("$E$",(-.3,-3),S);

So, the points are:

A: (0.1,1)
B: (-1,0)
C: (0,0)
D: (3,0)
E: (-0.3,-3)

So, in this coordinate system, AB is from (0.1,1) to (-1,0), BC is from (-1,0) to (0,0), BD is from (-1,0) to (3,0), so BD is 4 units (from -1 to 3 is 4 units), BC is 1 unit, so BD = 4 BC. That's consistent with the given.

So, in this coordinate system, triangle ABC is triangle with points A(0.1,1), B(-1,0), C(0,0). Triangle CDE is triangle with points C(0,0), D(3,0), E(-0.3,-3).

So, in this case, I can compute the area of ABC and CDE using coordinates.

First, let's compute the area of triangle ABC.

Coordinates:

A: (0.1,1)
B: (-1,0)
C: (0,0)

Using shoelace formula:

Area = |(0.1*(0 - 0) + (-1)*(0 - 1) + 0*(1 - 0))/2|
= |0 + (-1)*(-1) + 0| /2
= |0 + 1 + 0| /2
= 1/2 = 0.5 cm²

Wait, but the problem states the area is 6 cm². Hmm, so maybe the figure is scaled. Because in the Asymptote code, the area is 0.5, but the problem says 6. So, we need to scale up the figure by a factor.

Let’s find the scaling factor. If the area scales by the square of the scaling factor, then if the original area is 0.5, and it's scaled by k² to get 6.

So, 0.5 * k² = 6 => k² = 12 => k = 2*sqrt(3).

Therefore, each coordinate is scaled by 2*sqrt(3). So, point A is (0.1,1) becomes (0.1*2√3, 1*2√3) = (0.2√3, 2√3). Similarly, point D is (3,0) becomes (3*2√3, 0) = (6√3, 0). Point E is (-0.3,-3) becomes (-0.3*2√3, -3*2√3) = (-0.6√3, -6√3).

But maybe instead of trying to compute coordinates, I can just use the similar triangles approach.

Earlier, I thought that triangles ABC and CDE are similar with ratio 1:5, but in the coordinate system, triangle ABC is 0.5 and CDE would be 0.5*(5)^2 = 12.5, which is way off. So, that must be incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's see, in the coordinate system, triangle ABC has area 0.5, and CDE has area 12.5, which is not matching the 6 and 30 I calculated earlier.

Wait, maybe the ratio isn't 1/5, but something else.

Wait, maybe I need to compute the ratio of areas using the coordinates.

In the given figure, triangle ABC has area 0.5, and triangle CDE has area 12.5. So, the ratio is 0.5 : 12.5 = 1 : 25, which is 1/25.

But in the problem, triangle ABC is 6, so if the ratio is 1/25, then triangle CDE would be 6*25=150. But in the coordinate system, it's 12.5, which is 6*2.083... So, that can't be.

Wait, I think the issue is that the triangles are not similar. Maybe they are not similar because of the way the lines are drawn.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, AB is drawn from A(0.1,1) to B(-1,0), and DE is from D(3,0) to E(-0.3,-3). So, maybe AB and DE are not parallel? Wait, AB has a slope of (0 - 1)/(-1 - 0.1) = (-1)/(-1.1) ≈ 0.909. DE has a slope of (-3 - 0)/( -0.3 - 3) = (-3)/(-3.3) ≈ 0.909. So, they have the same slope, so they are parallel.

So, the triangles ABC and CDE are similar because they have the same angles and DE is parallel to AB.

Wait, but in the coordinate system, the area ratio is 1/25, but in the problem, it's 6. So, maybe the figure is scaled up by a factor of k, so that the area is 6, which would make the scaling factor k = sqrt(6 / original area). Wait, the original area is 0.5, so k = sqrt(6 / 0.5) = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3). So, each length is scaled by 2*sqrt(3).

So, in the coordinate system, triangle ABC has area 0.5, so scaled up by (2*sqrt(3))² = 12, so the area becomes 0.5*12 = 6, which is correct.

Similarly, triangle CDE has area 12.5 in the coordinate system, which scales to 12.5*12 = 150. So, the area would be 150 cm².

But wait, in the problem, the area of triangle ABC is 6, which is scaled up, but the Asymptote figure is scaled down. So, maybe in the given problem, the area is 6, so the scaling factor is 1 (since in the Asymptote figure, the area is 0.5 but we need it to be 6, so scaling factor is 12). So, in the problem, triangle CDE is 150.

But let me try to think if there's another way without coordinates.

Given that BD = 4 BC, so BC:BD = 1:4. So, BD is 4 times BC. So, if BC is x, BD is 4x, so CD is BC + BD = 5x.

Since AB is parallel to DE, the triangles ABC and CDE are similar. The ratio of sides is BC/CD = 1/5.

Therefore, the ratio of areas is (1/5)^2 = 1/25. Therefore, area of CDE is 6 * 25 = 150.

Wait, so that's the same answer as before. But in the coordinate system, it's 150, but in the problem, if the area is 6, then CDE is 150. But in the Asymptote figure, the area is 0.5, so scaling factor is 12, so CDE should be 12 * 12.5 = 150, which matches.

So, maybe the answer is 150.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are specific, but in the problem, the coordinates are not specified, so we have to assume that it's a general case.

Wait, but perhaps in the Asymptote code, it's just a specific drawing, but in reality, it's a general problem. So, the ratio is 1/25, so the area is 150.

But wait, that seems big. Alternatively, maybe the area is 12.

Wait, I need to think carefully.

Wait, in the coordinate system, area of ABC is 0.5, CDE is 12.5. So, the ratio is 0.5 : 12.5 = 1:25. So, CDE is 25 times ABC. So, in the problem, if ABC is 6, then CDE is 6*25=150.

Therefore, 150 is the area of triangle CDE.

But wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is 1/5, so the area is 6*(1/5)^2=6/25, which is about 0.24, but that's too small.

Wait, but in the coordinate system, ABC is 0.5, and CDE is 12.5, which is 25 times bigger. So, the scaling factor is 25, so the answer is 150.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since BD = 4 BC, so BC:BD = 1:4, so CD = BC + BD = 5 BC. So, CD is 5 times BC.

Since AB is parallel to DE, the triangles ABC and CDE are similar with ratio 1:5, so the area is 1/25 of the larger triangle. Wait, no, larger triangle? Wait, ABC is the smaller triangle, and CDE is the larger one. So, area of CDE is 25 times ABC.

Therefore, 25*6=150.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the area is 150 cm².

Wait, but in the coordinate system, ABC is 0.5, CDE is 12.5. So, CDE is 25 times ABC. So, if ABC is 6, then CDE is 150.

Yes, so the area is 150.

But wait, I thought the answer was 12, but maybe not. Let me just go back.

Alternatively, maybe I should use vectors or coordinate geometry to find the ratio.

Wait, in the coordinate system, the area of ABC is 0.5, and CDE is 12.5. So, the ratio is 0.5:12.5 = 1:25. Therefore, CDE is 25 times ABC, so if ABC is 6, CDE is 150.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, another approach: Since AB is parallel to DE, the triangles ABC and CDE are similar with a ratio of 1:5, so the area ratio is 1:25. Therefore, CDE's area is 25*6=150.

Therefore, the area of triangle CDE is 150.

But, wait, hold on. In the Asymptote code, the figure is given, but in the problem, the area is 6. If I compute the area in the Asymptote figure, I get 0.5, so to scale it up to 6, I have to multiply by 12, so the area of CDE in the problem would be 12.5*12=150.

Therefore, I think the answer is 150.

But wait, I just recalled that sometimes when figures are similar, the ratio is different.

Wait, AB is parallel to DE, so the triangles are similar, but depending on which triangle is which.

Wait, in the coordinate system, ABC is the small triangle, and CDE is the large triangle.

Wait, if I compute the coordinates correctly, the area of ABC is 0.5, and CDE is 12.5, which is 25 times bigger. So, in the problem, ABC is 6, so CDE is 6*25=150.

Yes, so that's the answer. Therefore, I think the answer is \boxed{150}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{150}
</think>

Given that the area of $\triangle ABC$ is 6 square centimeters and $\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{DE}$ with $BD = 4BC$, we need to find the area of $\triangle CDE$.

1. **Identify the ratio of similarity**:
   - Since $\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{DE}$, triangles $ABC$ and $CDE$ are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.
   - The ratio of $BC$ to $CD$ is $1:5$ because $BD = 4BC$ and $CD = BC + BD = 5BC$.

2. **Calculate the area ratio**:
   - The ratio of the areas of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.
   - The ratio of the sides is $1:5$, so the ratio of the areas is $(1/5)^2 = 1/25$.

3. **Determine the area of $\triangle CDE$**:
   - The area of $\triangle ABC$ is 6 square centimeters.
   - The area of $\triangle CDE$ is $6 \times 25 = 150$ square centimeters.

Thus, the number of square centimeters in the area of $\triangle CDE$ is \(\boxed{150}\).
