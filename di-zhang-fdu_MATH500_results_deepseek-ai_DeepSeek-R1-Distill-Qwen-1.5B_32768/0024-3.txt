Question:
Six cars pull up to a red light, one at a time. At the light, there are three lanes, one left-turn lane, one straight-going lane, and one right-turn lane. How many ways can the cars stack up so that all three lanes are occupied?

Note that if the first car turns left and the second goes straight, this is considered different from the first car going straight and the second car turning left. In other words, the cars are distinguishable, but pull up to the intersection in a fixed order.

Correct Answer:
We count the number of ways that some lane can be left empty, and subtract from the total number, $3^6=729$ because each driver has three choices. Suppose the left-turn lane is left empty. Then each driver is limited to 2 choices, and there are $2^6$ ways to leave the left-turn lane empty. The same logic gives $2^6$ ways to leave the center lane and right-turn lane open. But we have double-counted the situations where two lanes are left empty. Fortunately, since each driver must go into the third lane, there are only 3 situations we have over-counted. This leaves $3\cdot2^6-3=189$ ways to leave at least one lane unoccupied, or $729-189=\boxed{540}$ ways to occupy every lane.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here where six cars are coming up to a red light one after another. There are three lanes: left-turn, straight, and right-turn. I need to figure out how many ways the cars can stack up so that all three lanes are occupied. The cars are distinguishable, meaning each one is unique, but they come up in a fixed order. So, the first car is different from the second, and so on.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have six distinct cars arriving at a red light, one after another. The light has three lanes: left, straight, and right. Each car will choose one of these lanes as they go up. The question is asking how many different ways this can happen so that all three lanes are occupied. So, all three lanes must have at least one car in them.

Since the cars are distinguishable, it's not just about assigning each car to a lane; each car is unique, so the order in which they choose the lanes matters. For example, if the first car chooses left and the second chooses straight, that's a different arrangement than the first car choosing straight and the second choosing left.

But the key here is that all three lanes must be occupied. That means no lane can be empty. So, each lane must have at least one car.

Let me think about how to model this. It seems like a problem related to counting the number of onto functions. An onto function is a function where every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain. In this case, the domain is the six cars, and the codomain is the three lanes. So, we need the number of onto functions from the set of six cars to the three lanes.

The formula for the number of onto functions from a set of size n to a set of size k is given by:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^i \binom{k}{i} (k - i)^n
$$

Alternatively, it can also be expressed using Stirling numbers of the second kind:

$$
k! \cdot S(n, k)
$$

Where \( S(n, k) \) is the Stirling number of the second kind, which counts the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets. Then, multiplying by \( k! \) accounts for the permutations of the subsets since the lanes are distinguishable.

So, for our problem, n = 6 cars and k = 3 lanes. Therefore, the number of onto functions should be:

$$
3! \cdot S(6, 3)
$$

But I don't remember the exact value of \( S(6, 3) \). Maybe I can look it up or calculate it.

Alternatively, I can compute the number using the inclusion-exclusion principle, which is essentially what I thought earlier.

The inclusion-exclusion formula for onto functions is:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^i \binom{k}{i} (k - i)^n
$$

So, plugging in n = 6 and k = 3:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^3 (-1)^i \binom{3}{i} (3 - i)^6
$$

Let's compute each term:

For i = 0:
$$
(-1)^0 \cdot \binom{3}{0} \cdot (3 - 0)^6 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 3^6 = 729
$$

For i = 1:
$$
(-1)^1 \cdot \binom{3}{1} \cdot (3 - 1)^6 = -1 \cdot 3 \cdot 2^6 = -1 \cdot 3 \cdot 64 = -192
$$

For i = 2:
$$
(-1)^2 \cdot \binom{3}{2} \cdot (3 - 2)^6 = 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 1^6 = 3 \cdot 1 = 3
$$

For i = 3:
$$
(-1)^3 \cdot \binom{3}{3} \cdot (3 - 3)^6 = -1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0^6 = -1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 0
$$

Now, summing these up:

729 - 192 + 3 + 0 = 729 - 192 is 537, plus 3 is 540.

So, the number of onto functions is 540.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Let me compute each term step by step:

i=0: 3^6=729

i=1: -C(3,1)*2^6= -3*64= -192

i=2: C(3,2)*1^6= 3*1=3

i=3: -C(3,3)*0^6= -1*0=0

So, 729 - 192 is indeed 537, plus 3 is 540. So, 540 onto functions.

Alternatively, using the Stirling numbers, I can compute S(6,3). I think S(6,3) is 90, so 3! * 90 is 540. Let me confirm that.

Yes, actually, S(6,3) is 90. So, 3! is 6, 6*90 is 540.

So, that's consistent.

Wait, but just to make sure, I can maybe compute S(6,3) manually.

Stirling numbers of the second kind can be computed recursively:

S(n,k) = S(n-1,k-1) + k*S(n-1,k)

So, starting from base cases:

S(0,0) = 1

S(n,0) = 0 for n > 0

S(0,k) = 0 for k > 0

S(n,k) = S(n-1,k-1) + k*S(n-1,k)

So, let's compute S(6,3):

We need S(6,3). Let's build up the Stirling numbers step by step.

First, compute S(n,1) = 1 for any n >=1, since there's only one way to partition n objects into 1 set.

Similarly, S(n,n) = 1, since each object is its own set.

Then, for S(n,k) where 1 < k < n:

S(n,k) = S(n-1,k-1) + k*S(n-1,k)

So, let's compute S(1,1)=1

S(2,1)=1, S(2,2)=1

S(3,1)=1, S(3,2)= S(2,1) + 2*S(2,2) = 1 + 2*1=3, S(3,3)=1

S(4,1)=1, S(4,2)= S(3,1) + 2*S(3,2)=1 + 2*3=7, S(4,3)= S(3,2) + 3*S(3,3)=3 + 3*1=6, S(4,4)=1

S(5,1)=1, S(5,2)= S(4,1) + 2*S(4,2)=1 + 2*7=15, S(5,3)= S(4,2) + 3*S(4,3)=7 + 3*6=7 + 18=25, S(5,4)= S(4,3) + 4*S(4,4)=6 + 4*1=10, S(5,5)=1

S(6,1)=1, S(6,2)= S(5,1) + 2*S(5,2)=1 + 2*15=31, S(6,3)= S(5,2) + 3*S(5,3)=15 + 3*25=15 + 75=90, S(6,4)= S(5,3) + 4*S(5,4)=25 + 4*10=25 + 40=65, S(6,5)= S(5,4) + 5*S(5,5)=10 + 5*1=15, S(6,6)=1

So, S(6,3)=90, which matches our earlier calculation.

Therefore, 3! * S(6,3) = 6 * 90 = 540.

So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, I can think of it as assigning each car to one of the three lanes, but making sure that all three lanes are used. Since the cars are distinguishable, it's like counting the number of onto functions.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is using permutations with restrictions.

For the first car, there are 3 choices.

For the second car, since one lane is already used, there are 2 remaining choices.

For the third car, there are 2 remaining choices.

Wait, but this seems incomplete because the cars are being pulled in a fixed order, so their choices are dependent on previous choices.

Wait, no. Actually, since the cars are pulled in a fixed order, each car's choice is independent of the previous ones, except that we need to ensure that all three lanes are used.

So, this is similar to counting the number of strings of length 6 over an alphabet of size 3, with the condition that each character appears at least once.

Wait, that's exactly the same problem.

Yes, so the number of such strings is equal to the number of onto functions from the 6 cars to the 3 lanes, which is what we computed as 540.

Alternatively, the number of onto functions is equal to the number of surjective functions, which is the same as the number of ways to assign each car to a lane with each lane getting at least one car.

So, let me think about how to compute this another way, perhaps using inclusion-exclusion.

So, the total number of ways to assign the six cars to three lanes is 3^6, since each car has 3 choices.

But some of these assignments don't use all three lanes. So, to compute the number of onto functions, we can subtract the ones that miss at least one lane.

Inclusion-exclusion formula:

Total onto functions = Total functions - functions missing at least one lane + functions missing at least two lanes - ... etc.

But for three lanes, the formula is:

Total onto = 3^6 - C(3,1)*2^6 + C(3,2)*1^6 - C(3,3)*0^6

Which is exactly the inclusion-exclusion formula we used earlier.

So, 3^6 is 729, subtract 3*64=192, add 3*1=3, subtract 0.

So, 729 - 192 + 3 = 540.

So, that's another way to think about it.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of permutations, but since the cars are distinguishable, it's not permutations but functions.

So, in conclusion, the number of ways the six cars can stack up so that all three lanes are occupied is 540.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem.

The problem says: "Six cars pull up to a red light, one at a time. At the light, there are three lanes, one left-turn lane, one straight-going lane, and one right-turn lane. How many ways can the cars stack up so that all three lanes are occupied?"

So, each car goes up one by one, and each can choose a lane. The key is that all three lanes must be occupied, meaning that each lane must have at least one car.

So, yes, this is exactly the number of onto functions from the set of six cars to the three lanes.

Hence, 540 is the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: if the cars are distinguishable, does the order matter? The problem says "at the light, there are three lanes, one left-turn lane, one straight-going lane, and one right-turn lane." It doesn't specify anything about the cars' order, but the note says: "Note that if the first car turns left and the second goes straight, this is considered different from the first car going straight and the second turning left."

Wait, hold on, that's an important point.

The note says: "Note that if the first car turns left and the second goes straight, this is considered different from the first car going straight and the second turning left."

Hmm, so in other words, the order in which the cars choose the lanes matters. So, it's not just assigning each car to a lane, but the sequence of choices is important.

Wait, let me parse that again.

It says: "At the light, there are three lanes, one left-turn lane, one straight-going lane, and one right-turn lane. How many ways can the cars stack up so that all three lanes are occupied?"

So, the cars are distinguishable, but they come up in a fixed order.

So, the first car chooses a lane, the second car chooses a lane, etc.

But then, the note says: "Note that if the first car turns left and the second goes straight, this is considered different from the first car going straight and the second turning left."

So, in other words, the order in which they choose the lanes matters. So, the two scenarios where the first car turns left and the second goes straight is different from the first car going straight and the second turning left.

Therefore, the cars are being assigned a sequence of choices, each time choosing a lane, with the constraint that all three lanes are used at least once.

So, this is similar to counting the number of sequences of length 6 over a 3-letter alphabet, where each letter appears at least once. But in this case, each sequence corresponds to a way the cars can stack up, considering the order of choices.

Alternatively, it's similar to counting the number of onto functions, but considering the order of assignment.

Wait, actually, the number of such sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of interleavings or something else?

Wait, actually, no. Because each function is an assignment, but here we have a sequence where order matters.

Wait, let me think again.

Each way the cars can stack up is a sequence of choices for each car, where each choice is a lane, and all three lanes are used at least once.

So, the total number is equal to the number of such sequences.

But since the cars are distinguishable, each sequence is a different way.

So, for example, if the first car chooses lane A, the second car chooses lane B, the third car chooses lane C, etc., that's a different sequence than if the first car chooses lane B, second car chooses lane A, etc.

Therefore, we need to count the number of sequences of six lane choices (each car choosing a lane) such that all three lanes are used at least once.

This is different from counting the number of onto functions, because in onto functions, the order of assignments doesn't matter, but here, the order does.

Wait, maybe not. Wait, in the case of onto functions, the order doesn't matter because the function is just assigning each element to a subset.

But here, we have sequences where order matters, so perhaps it's different.

Wait, but hold on, the problem is that the cars are being pulled up one by one, so the sequence of choices is important. So, each ordering is a different way.

Therefore, it's equivalent to counting the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings.

Wait, no, that might not be the case.

Wait, actually, the number of sequences where each car chooses a lane, all three lanes are used, is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the assignments.

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, perhaps we can think of it as assigning each car a lane, with all three lanes used, and the assignment is ordered, so for each onto function, there are several sequences corresponding to it.

But actually, no. Each onto function is a mapping from the set of cars to the set of lanes, without considering order.

But in this problem, the order of the cars matters, so each onto function is being embedded into a sequence where the order is fixed.

Wait, but if we have a function f: {1,2,3,4,5,6} → {A,B,C}, which is onto, then the number of sequences corresponding to this function is the number of linear extensions, which in this case is the number of permutations of the function's image.

Wait, no, actually, for each onto function, the number of sequences is the number of interleavings of the assignments.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

If the order of the cars matters, then each way the cars can stack up is a permutation of the six cars, each assigned to a lane, with the constraint that all three lanes are used.

So, that's equivalent to counting the number of injective functions from the six cars to the three lanes, multiplied by the number of orderings.

Wait, no, not injective.

Alternatively, it's the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the function's outputs.

Wait, no, actually, if you have an onto function, which maps each car to a lane, and order matters, then the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the set {A,B,C}, which is 6.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right.

Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, the number of onto functions is 540. Each onto function is an assignment where each car is assigned to a lane, with each lane assigned at least once.

But since the cars are distinguishable, and the order in which they are assigned matters, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the three lanes, which is 3!.

Wait, but that would be 540 * 6 = 3240.

But that seems too high.

Wait, let me think.

Each onto function is a way to assign each car to a lane, with each lane used at least once. So, the number of such assignments is 540.

But since the cars are ordered, the number of sequences is 540 multiplied by the number of orderings of the assignments.

Wait, but each onto function is already an assignment, which is a function, so each function can be thought of as a way to assign each car to a lane, but the order of the cars is fixed.

Wait, no, actually, the order of the cars is fixed; the problem says "six cars pull up to a red light, one at a time." So, the first car is fixed before the second, etc.

Therefore, the problem is about sequences of lane assignments where the order matters.

So, that is, the number of sequences of length 6 where each element is in {A,B,C}, all three letters appear at least once, and each element is assigned in order.

So, that's equivalent to counting the number of sequences with all three letters, with order.

Wait, that is, the number is equal to the number of strings of length 6 over {A,B,C} with all three letters appearing at least once, multiplied by the number of orderings, but actually, no, because each string is an ordered sequence.

Wait, no, actually, it's the number of sequences where each position is assigned a lane, with the condition that all three lanes are used.

So, that is, each sequence is a 6-length word over the alphabet {A,B,C}, with each letter appearing at least once, and the order matters.

So, the number is equal to the number of such words.

Which is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings.

Wait, no, actually, the number of such sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the three letters.

Wait, that is, for each onto function, which assigns each car to a lane, the number of sequences is the number of orderings of the assignments.

But since each onto function is a function, each assignment is a mapping, so the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings.

Wait, but each function is a specific assignment, and if you consider the order, it's like permuting the assignments.

Wait, that is, for each onto function (which is a specific assignment), the number of sequences is the number of permutations of the assignments, which is 6! divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each assignment.

Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, actually, no, for each onto function, the number of sequences is 6! divided by the product of factorials of the number of cars assigned to each lane.

But since the cars are distinguishable, each permutation of assignments is a different sequence.

Wait, so the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the assignments.

Wait, but the number of permutations of the assignments is 6! / (k1! k2! k3!) for each onto function with k1, k2, k3 cars in each lane.

But since the onto functions vary, the total number would be the sum over all onto functions of 6! / (k1! k2! k3!).

But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to note that each onto function can be thought of as an assignment, and the number of sequences is the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings of the assignments, but since each assignment is a specific function, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of possible orderings.

But wait, each onto function is already an assignment, so the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the function's outputs.

But each onto function maps each car to a lane, so for each onto function, the number of sequences is the number of bijections from the set of cars to the set of lanes, which is 6!.

But wait, no, that's not correct because the onto functions already account for the assignments, so the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of permutations.

Wait, actually, maybe it's the same as the number of surjective functions multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the function's outputs.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, let me get back to the problem.

The six cars are being pulled up one after another, each choosing a lane. The order matters because each choice is made at a different time.

The problem is asking for the number of ways the cars can stack up so that all three lanes are occupied.

This is similar to counting the number of sequences where each element is in {A,B,C}, all three elements appear at least once, and the order matters.

This is a classic problem in combinatorics.

The formula for the number of such sequences is:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^3 (-1)^{k} \binom{3}{k} (3 - k)^6 \times 6!
$$

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, the number of sequences where each of three elements appears at least once is equal to 3! * S(6,3), which is 6 * 90 = 540.

Wait, but earlier I thought the number of onto functions is 540, and each onto function can be thought of as a way to assign each car to a lane, but the order of the cars matters.

Wait, so if order matters, is it 540 * 6! / (k1! k2! k3!) summed over all possible k1, k2, k3.

But that seems complicated.

Wait, but actually, 540 is the number of onto functions, which are assignments of each car to a lane, but if the order of the cars matters, then each of these assignments can be permuted in 6! ways, but only if all three lanes are used.

Wait, no, that can't be, because the order is determined by the sequence of cars.

Wait, perhaps another way: for each onto function, which is an assignment of each car to a lane, the number of sequences is the number of permutations of the assignments.

Wait, so for each onto function, the number of sequences is 6! / (k1! k2! k3!) where k1, k2, k3 are the number of cars assigned to each lane.

But since the onto functions can have different k1, k2, k3, we need to sum over all possible onto functions.

Wait, but that seems complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the assignments, but since the onto functions are already determined, the number of sequences is the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the assignments.

Wait, but I think this is not correct because each onto function defines a specific assignment, and the number of sequences is the number of permutations of that assignment, but since the assignment is a function, the number of permutations is actually 6! divided by the product of the factorials of the number of cars in each lane.

But since the number of cars in each lane isn't fixed, we can't directly compute it.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of exponential generating functions.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, actually, let me recall that the number of sequences where each element is in a set of size n, and all elements appear at least once, with order, is n! * S(n, m), where m is the number of elements.

Wait, no, that's not.

Wait, no, in our case, the set of lanes is size 3, and we have 6 elements (cars), each assigned to one of the 3 lanes, with all lanes used at least once. The number of such assignments is 3! * S(6,3) = 540.

But if we consider the order of the cars, then each assignment can be permuted in 6! ways, but only if all lanes are used.

Wait, but no, because the permutation would correspond to different orderings of the same assignment.

Wait, so for each onto function, which is an assignment, the number of sequences is 6! / (k1! k2! k3!) multiplied by the number of onto functions.

But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The number of sequences is equal to the number of functions from the 6 cars to the 3 lanes, such that all lanes are used, multiplied by the number of orderings of the cars.

Wait, but that's not quite.

Wait, no, I think the confusion is arising because in the problem, the order of the cars is fixed: the first car comes first, the second comes next, etc. So, the sequence is determined by the order of the cars.

Therefore, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of possible orderings of the cars, but only considering those onto functions where all lanes are used.

Wait, but each onto function is a specific assignment, and the number of orderings is 6!.

But that can't be, because if all lanes are used, the number of orderings would be 6! for each onto function, which is too high.

Wait, no, actually, the number of sequences is the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the cars, but only if all lanes are used.

Wait, but actually, each onto function is a mapping, and the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the assignments.

Wait, no, perhaps another way.

Let me think of it as a permutation.

Each sequence is a permutation of the six cars, where each car is assigned to a lane, with all three lanes used.

This is equivalent to counting the number of such permutations.

So, for this, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

The total number of permutations is 6!.

From this, we subtract the number of permutations missing at least one lane.

That's 3 * 5! (since for each lane, we subtract the permutations where all cars go to the other two lanes).

Then, we add back the number of permutations missing two lanes, which is 3 * 4! (since for each pair of lanes, we subtract the permutations where all cars go to the remaining lane).

Finally, we subtract the number of permutations missing all three lanes, but since we can't have all cars in zero lanes, that term is zero.

So, the number of onto functions is:

6! - 3*5! + 3*4! - 0 = 720 - 3*120 + 3*24 = 720 - 360 + 72 = 432.

Wait, but that contradicts our earlier calculation.

Wait, hold on, that's 432, but we have 540.

Wait, that can't be right because 540 is the number of onto functions, and if the number of sequences is 432, that can't be.

Wait, but in the problem, the order matters, so the number of sequences is different from the number of onto functions.

So, in that case, the number of sequences is actually equal to 3! * S(6,3) multiplied by the number of orderings, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think again.

Each onto function is a way to assign each car to a lane, but the order of the cars matters, so for each onto function, the number of sequences is 6! / (k1! k2! k3!).

But since the onto functions vary, the total number is the sum over all onto functions of 6! / (k1! k2! k3!).

But that seems too complicated.

Wait, but in the problem statement, is the order of the cars considered? The note says: "Note that if the first car turns left and the second goes straight, this is considered different from the first car going straight and the second turning left."

Yes, so the order of the cars matters, so it's about the number of sequences, not the number of onto functions.

So, the number of sequences is equal to the number of functions from the set of cars to the set of lanes, such that all lanes are used, multiplied by the number of orderings.

Wait, no, for each function, the number of sequences is the number of permutations of the function's outputs, but since the function is a specific mapping, the number of sequences is equal to 6! divided by the product of the multiplicities of each lane.

But since the multiplicities vary per function, that complicates things.

Wait, actually, perhaps the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the assignments.

Wait, but each onto function is a specific mapping, so the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the cars, which is 6!.

But that would be 540 * 720, which is way too high.

Wait, no, that can't be, because it's the number of sequences where the mapping is fixed.

Wait, actually, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Each sequence is a permutation of the six cars, each assigned to a lane, with all three lanes used. So, for each permutation, we can assign each car to a lane, such that all three lanes are used.

Alternatively, for each permutation, we can think of the lanes as a partition of the permutation.

But since the lanes are distinguishable, each partition corresponds to a different assignment.

Wait, no, maybe not.

Alternatively, think of it as a word over the alphabet {A,B,C}, with the condition that all three letters appear at least once, and the order matters.

The number of such words is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations.

Wait, but no, actually, the number of such words is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations.

Wait, no, the number of onto functions is 540, and each onto function can be assigned to the six cars in 6! ways, but only if all three lanes are used.

Wait, but each onto function is a specific assignment, so the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the assignments.

But that seems like 540 * 6! which is way too large.

Wait, but no, because each onto function is a specific assignment, and the number of permutations is 6! for each assignment. But since the assignments are different for each onto function, this is not the right way.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a two-step process.

First, choose an onto function (540 ways). Then, for each onto function, assign each car to a lane in some order. But that seems inconsistent with the problem.

Wait, I think I need to approach this problem differently.

Let me recall that when order matters, the number of sequences is equal to the number of words, which is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations.

Wait, but no, actually, in the case where order matters, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations.

Wait, but let me think of an example.

Suppose we have two cars and two lanes, and we want to count the number of sequences where both lanes are used.

The onto functions are two: first car goes to lane A, second to lane B; and first to B, second to A.

Each of these can be permuted in 2! ways, so total number of sequences is 2 * 2 = 4.

But actually, the possible sequences are:

1. A, B

2. B, A

3. B, A

4. A, B

Wait, but that's four sequences, which is 2! * 2! = 4.

Wait, so in this case, the number of sequences is the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations.

Wait, but in our case, the onto functions are 540, and for each, the number of sequences is 6! / (k1! k2! k3!) for each function.

But since the number of cars in each lane is variable, we can't directly compute it.

Wait, but in the two-lane case, the number of onto functions is 2, and each can be permuted in 2! ways, giving 4 sequences, which is 2! * 2!.

Similarly, in our case, the number of onto functions is 540, and each can be permuted in 6! ways, but that would be 540 * 720, which is too high.

But in the two-lane case, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations.

Wait, in the two-lane case, the number of onto functions is 2, and the number of sequences is 2! * 2! = 4, which is 2! * 2! = 4.

So, in our case, it should be 3! * 6! / (k1! k2! k3!) summed over all onto functions, but that's too complicated.

Wait, but actually, in the two-lane case, the number of sequences is 2! * 2! = 4, because each onto function can be assigned in 2! ways.

Similarly, in our case, each onto function can be assigned in 6! / (k1! k2! k3!) ways, so the total number of sequences is the sum over all onto functions of 6! / (k1! k2! k3!).

But that's difficult.

Wait, but actually, in our problem, each onto function is a specific assignment, so the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the assignments.

Wait, but in the two-lane case, each onto function corresponds to a specific assignment, say, one car to A and one to B.

Then, the number of sequences is 2! / (1! 1!) = 2, which is the number of permutations.

But in our case, each onto function is a specific assignment, so for each, the number of sequences is 6! / (k1! k2! k3!), which varies.

So, in the two-lane case, the total number of sequences is sum over all onto functions of 2! / (1! 1!) = 2 * 2 = 4, which is correct.

Similarly, in our case, the total number of sequences is sum over all onto functions of 6! / (k1! k2! k3!) where k1 + k2 + k3 = 6, and each ki >=1.

That seems complicated, but perhaps we can compute it.

But wait, another thought: if we have 6 cars and 3 lanes, with each lane used at least once, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations, which is 3! * S(6,3) * 6!.

But that would be 6 * 90 * 720 = 388,800, which is too large.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, in the two-lane case, we had 2! * 2! = 4, which was equal to 2! * (2! / (1!1!)) = 2! * 2 = 4.

But that is incorrect, because for each onto function, it's 2! / (1!1!) = 2, and since there are 2 onto functions, the total is 2 * 2 = 4.

Similarly, in our case, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations, which is 6!.

But that can't be, because 540 * 720 is way too big.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around: the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings of the assignments, which is 3!.

But that would be 540 * 6 = 3240, which is still too big.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I need to look for a better approach.

Wait, another idea: Each sequence is a permutation of the six cars, with the added condition that all three lanes are used.

So, the number of such sequences is equal to the number of surjective functions from the set of cars to the set of lanes, multiplied by the number of permutations.

But wait, no, because the surjective functions are already assignments, not sequences.

Alternatively, the number of sequences is equal to the number of surjective functions multiplied by the number of permutations, but that still doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps let's think of it as a permutation with constraints.

Each permutation is a sequence, and each element is assigned to a lane. The constraint is that all three lanes are used.

So, for each permutation, we can assign each car to a lane, such that all three lanes are used.

Alternatively, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of ways to assign the cars to lanes, which is 6!.

Wait, but that can't be, because the onto functions are specific assignments, not arbitrary assignments.

Alternatively, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the images.

Wait, no, I think I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps another idea: The number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings of the cars, but the problem is that each onto function is a specific assignment, and the number of orderings is 6!.

But if you have 540 onto functions, each can be assigned in 6! ways, which is 720, so the total number is 540 * 720 = 388,800, which is way too high.

But in the two-lane case, the number of sequences is 2! * 2! = 4, which is 2 * 2 = 4, which is correct.

So, in that case, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings.

Therefore, in our problem, it's 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But that seems too high.

Wait, but in the two-lane case, the number of sequences is 4, which is equal to the number of onto functions (2) multiplied by the number of orderings (2).

Similarly, in our case, it's 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But in the two-lane case, 2! * 2! = 4, which is correct.

So, perhaps in our problem, it is 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But that seems way too high, because the total number of possible sequences is 3^6 = 729, which is much smaller.

Wait, but 3^6 is the total number of sequences without considering order.

So, 729 is the total number of sequences, but our problem is about sequences with order, so 3^6 is the total without order, and we need the number with order.

Wait, so 3^6 = 729 is the total number of sequences without considering the order of the cars.

But in our problem, we have the order of the cars fixed, so the number of sequences is 6! multiplied by the number of onto functions.

Wait, no, 6! is 720, and 540 is the number of onto functions, so 720 * 540 = 388,800.

But that can't be right because 3^6 is only 729.

Wait, no, no, the confusion is arising because 3^6 is the number of ways to assign each car to a lane without considering the order, so it's 729.

But in our problem, we're considering the order of the cars, so 3^6 is the total number of possible assignments without considering order.

But when we consider the order, each assignment corresponds to 6! / (k1! k2! k3!) sequences, where k1, k2, k3 are the number of cars in each lane.

Therefore, the total number of sequences is sum over all onto functions of (6! / (k1! k2! k3!)).

But that's equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations, which is 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But that is inconsistent with the two-lane case, where it was 4, which is 2 * 2 = 4.

But in our case, the total number of sequences is way higher.

Wait, but in the two-lane case, it was 4, which is 2! * 2! = 4.

But in our case, since there are more lanes, the number is higher.

Wait, but 3^6 is 729, which is the number of possible assignments without considering order.

But in our problem, we have order, so 3^6 is the number of assignments, but each assignment can be permuted in 6! ways.

Wait, but actually, each assignment is unique, so we can't permute them.

Wait, no, actually, the assignment is unique, but the order of the cars is fixed.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use exponential generating functions.

The exponential generating function for the onto functions is:

$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} S(n, k) \frac{x^n}{n!} = \frac{e^{kx} - 1}{k!}
$$

But in our case, we have 3 lanes and 6 cars, so perhaps the exponential generating function for onto functions is:

$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} S(n, 3) \frac{x^n}{n!} = \frac{e^{3x} - 3e^{2x} + 3e^{x}}{6}
$$

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, another idea: The number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of permutations of the cars, but that seems too high.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Think of the problem as assigning each car to a lane, considering order, so it's a permutation problem.

So, the first car can go to any of the three lanes, the second car can go to any of the three lanes, etc., so the total number without any restrictions is 3^6 = 729.

But we have the restriction that all three lanes must be occupied, and the order of the cars matters.

So, how many sequences of 6 cars with all three lanes used, where each car is assigned to a lane, considering order.

This is similar to counting the number of surjective functions from a 6-element set to a 3-element set, multiplied by the number of permutations.

But no, the surjective functions are already assignments, which are 540.

Wait, actually, in this case, each surjective function is an assignment, and for each assignment, the number of sequences is 6! / (k1! k2! k3!) multiplied by the number of orderings.

Wait, no, perhaps the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings, which is 3!.

Wait, but that's 540 * 6 = 3240, but in the two-lane case, that would be 2 * 2 = 4, which is correct.

But in our case, the number is too high.

Wait, but actually, in the two-lane case, the number of sequences is 4, which is 2! * 2! = 4, which is equal to 2! * 2! = 4, so in our case, it's 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But that seems way too high.

Wait, 3^6 = 729, which is the total number of assignments without considering order.

But in our problem, the number of sequences is 540 * 720 = 388,800, which is 540 * 720.

But that can't be, because 3^6 is 729, and 388,800 is way larger.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, actually, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings.

But each onto function is a specific assignment, and the number of orderings is 6!.

Wait, but that would be 540 * 720, which is 388,800, which is correct.

Wait, but in the two-lane case, the number of sequences is 4, which is equal to 2! * 2! = 4, which is also 2 * 2 = 4.

So, in that case, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings.

Therefore, in our problem, the number of sequences is 540 * 720 = 388,800.

Wait, but 388,800 is way more than 729, which is the number of assignments.

Wait, that makes sense because each onto function can be permuted in 6! ways, which is a lot.

Therefore, maybe the answer is 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But let me check.

Wait, actually, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings, which is 3!, but that is 540 * 6 = 3240, which is still less than 729.

Wait, no, 540 * 6 = 3240, but 3240 is less than 729? No, that can't be.

Wait, 540 * 6 = 3240, which is more than 729, which is the number of assignments.

Wait, but 3^6 is 729, so the number of sequences is 3240, which is greater than 729.

But that's impossible because sequences can't be more than 3^6.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, in our problem, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings.

So, 540 * 720 = 388,800, which is the number of sequences.

But 388,800 is way larger than 729, which is the number of assignments.

Wait, no, hold on, in the two-lane case, the number of sequences is 4, which is less than 2^6 = 64, but 4 is less than 64.

Wait, in our problem, the number of sequences is 540 * 720 = 388,800, which is way more than 729.

Wait, so, for example, if we have two lanes, the number of sequences is 4, which is 2! * 2! = 4, which is correct.

So, in the two-lane case, it's 4.

Similarly, in our case, it's 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But 540 * 720 is 388,800, which is correct, but in the two-lane case, 2! * 2! = 4, which is correct.

Wait, but 3! * 2^6 is 18 * 64 = 1152, which is bigger than 388,800.

Wait, no, that's not the case.

Wait, no, in the two-lane case, the number of sequences is 4, which is equal to 2! * 2! = 4, which is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings.

Similarly, in our case, the number of sequences is 540 * 720 = 388,800.

Therefore, I think that is the answer.

But let's see.

Wait, but let me think differently.

Each sequence is determined by an assignment and an order.

So, the number of sequences is equal to the number of assignments multiplied by the number of orderings.

Wait, but no, each assignment is a specific mapping, so the number of orderings is 6!.

Wait, but that's 540 * 720 = 388,800, which is too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings.

Wait, which would be 540 * 720 = 388,800.

Alternatively, maybe it's equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings per function.

Wait, but that would be 540 * (6! / (k1! k2! k3!)) summed over all onto functions, which is complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings, which is 3!.

So, 540 * 6 = 3240.

Wait, but in the two-lane case, it's 2 * 2 = 4, which is 2! * 2! = 4.

So, for our problem, 540 * 6 = 3240.

Wait, but 3240 is 540 * 6, which is 3240.

But in the two-lane case, that would also be 2! * 2! = 4, which is correct.

But in our problem, 3240 is different from 388,800.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to think that each onto function is an assignment, and the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings.

But the number of orderings is 6!.

So, 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But in the two-lane case, the number of sequences is 2! * 2! = 4, which is 2! * 2! = 4, which is equal to 2! * 2! = 4.

But in our problem, 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But that is equal to 540 * 720.

Wait, but in the two-lane case, 2! * 2! = 4, which is equal to 2 * 2 = 4.

Similarly, in our problem, 540 * 720 = 388,800.

Wait, but 3^6 is 729, and 388,800 is much larger.

Wait, so that can't be.

Wait, I think the confusion is that 3^6 is the number of assignments without considering order. So, for each assignment, we have 6! orderings, but that's not correct.

Wait, actually, no, each assignment is a specific function, so for each assignment, the number of sequences is 6!.

So, the total number of sequences is 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But that seems too high.

Wait, but in the two-lane case, it's 2! * 2! = 4, which is 2 * 2 = 4.

Similarly, in our problem, it's 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But 3^6 is 729, which is the number of assignments without considering order.

So, 388,800 is 540 * 720, which is 540 * 6!.

But 6! is 720, so 540 * 720 is indeed 388,800.

Therefore, the answer is 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But that seems high, but considering that order matters and we have three lanes, it's correct.

Wait, but let me think about another way.

Each car can choose a lane, so 3^6 = 729 assignments.

But in our problem, the order matters, so each assignment can be permuted.

Wait, but in reality, the order is fixed by the sequence.

Wait, no, the order is determined by the sequence.

Wait, actually, no, in the problem, the order of the cars is fixed, so the sequence is determined by the order of the cars.

Wait, so if we fix the order, the number of assignments is 3^6 = 729.

But we need to count how many of these assignments are onto functions, meaning all three lanes are used.

So, the number of sequences is equal to the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings.

Wait, but in this case, each onto function is a specific assignment, and the number of orderings is 6!.

Wait, but each onto function is a specific assignment, so the number of sequences is 540 * 720 = 388,800, which is correct.

Therefore, the answer is 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But that seems too high. Wait, maybe the correct answer is 540 * 6! / (1!1!1!) = 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But that's correct.

Wait, but in the two-lane case, 2! * 2! = 4, which is correct.

Similarly, in our problem, 540 * 720 = 388,800.

So, I think that is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me confirm with another approach.

Let me use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

The number of onto functions is:

$$
\sum_{k=0}^{3} (-1)^k \binom{3}{k} (3 - k)^6
$$

Which is:

$$
\binom{3}{0} 3^6 - \binom{3}{1} 2^6 + \binom{3}{2} 1^6 - \binom{3}{3} 0^6
$$

Which is:

$$
1 \times 729 - 3 \times 64 + 3 \times 1 - 1 \times 0 = 729 - 192 + 3 = 540
$$

Which is correct.

Now, if we consider order, the total number of sequences is:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{3} \binom{3}{k} S(6, k) \times 6! / (k! \times (6 - k)!)
$$

Wait, that's complicated.

Alternatively, for each onto function, the number of sequences is the number of permutations of the cars, which is 6!.

But each onto function is a specific assignment, so the number of sequences is 540 * 720 = 388,800.

Therefore, I think that is the correct answer.

Thus, the number of ways is 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But I'm a bit concerned because 388,800 is 540 multiplied by 720, which seems high, but considering that order matters, it's correct.

Wait, but let me check with another approach.

Each lane can be thought of as a position. Each car can choose a lane, and we need to count the number of assignments where all three lanes are used, considering order.

So, it's similar to counting the number of words of length 6 over an alphabet of size 3, where all letters appear at least once, and the order matters.

Wait, but in this case, the number of such words is equal to the sum over k=1 to 3 of Stirling numbers of the second kind multiplied by k!.

Which is exactly the inclusion-exclusion formula, which gave us 540.

But since order matters, each word can be permuted in 6! ways, so the total number of sequences is 540 * 6! = 388,800.

Therefore, I think that is the answer.

So, after all this thinking, I believe the number of ways is 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But wait, another thought. Since order matters, perhaps each onto function can be considered as a permutation.

Wait, no, the onto functions are already permutations, but when we consider order, it's different.

Wait, but in any case, I think the answer is 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But let me check with an example.

Suppose we have two lanes, A and B, and two cars, 1 and 2.

The number of onto functions is 2.

Each can be assigned to lanes A and B, so the assignments are:

1 -> A, 2 -> B

1 -> B, 2 -> A

Now, considering order, the sequences are:

1, 2 (A, B)

2, 1 (B, A)

So, 2 sequences.

But according to inclusion-exclusion, S(2,2) = 1, so the number of onto functions is 1.

But with order, it's 2.

So, in that case, the number is 2, which is 2!.

Similarly, in three lanes, the number of sequences would be 3! times the number of onto functions.

Wait, so in the two-lane case, it's 2!.

In the three-lane case, it's 3! times the number of onto functions.

Wait, no, in the two-lane case, it's 2! * S(2,2) = 2 * 1 = 2, which is correct.

Similarly, in three-lane case, it's 3! * S(6,3) = 6 * 90 = 540, which is the number of onto functions.

Wait, but in the two-lane case, it's 2! * S(2,2) = 2.

In our problem, it's 6! * S(6,3) = 720 * 90 = 64,800.

Wait, but in the two-lane case, the number of sequences is 2, not 64,800.

Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps in the two-lane case, it's 2! * S(2,2) = 2 * 1 = 2.

Similarly, in the three-lane case, it's 6! * S(6,3) = 720 * 90 = 64,800.

But in reality, in the two-lane case, the number of sequences is 2, which is 2!.

In the three-lane case, the number of sequences is 6! * S(6,3) = 6! * 90 = 64,800.

Wait, but that seems correct because in the two-lane case, 2! = 2 is the number of onto functions multiplied by 1, which is the number of orderings.

Wait, no, in the two-lane case, the number of onto functions is 1, and the number of orderings is 2, so the total is 2, which is 2!.

Similarly, in the three-lane case, the number of onto functions is 90, and the number of orderings is 720, so the total is 90 * 720 = 64,800.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, in general, the number of onto functions is S(n, k), and the number of orderings is n!.

Therefore, the total number of sequences is S(n, k) * n!.

Therefore, in our problem, it's S(6,3) * 6! = 90 * 720 = 64,800.

Therefore, the number of ways is 64,800.

Wait, but that contradicts our earlier conclusion.

Wait, but in the two-lane case, that formula gives us 2, which is correct.

In the three-lane case, it's 6! * S(6, 3) = 64,800.

But earlier, we thought it's 540 * 720 = 388,800, but that seems inconsistent.

Wait, so which is correct?

Wait, let's verify with the two-lane case.

In the two-lane case, S(2, 2) = 1.

Therefore, the number of onto functions is 1.

Number of orderings is 2!.

Therefore, total number of sequences is 1 * 2! = 2, which is correct.

Similarly, in the three-lane case, S(6,3) = 90.

Number of orderings is 6!.

Therefore, total number of sequences is 90 * 720 = 64,800.

But wait, in the two-lane case, it's 2, which is 2!.

In the three-lane case, it's 6!.

Therefore, that seems correct.

Therefore, in our problem, the number of sequences is 6! * S(6,3) = 720 * 90 = 64,800.

Wait, but in the three-lane case, that's 64,800.

But earlier, I thought that was 540 * 720 = 388,800.

But now, this approach is giving 64,800.

So, which is correct?

Wait, in the two-lane case, the number of onto functions is 1, the number of orderings is 2, so total is 2, which is correct.

Similarly, in the three-lane case, the number of onto functions is 90, the number of orderings is 6!, so 90 * 720 = 64,800.

But earlier, in the two-lane case, I thought of it as 2! * 2! = 4, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, in the two-lane case, the number of onto functions is 1, and the number of orderings is 2!, so 1 * 2! = 2, which is correct.

Similarly, in the three-lane case, the number of onto functions is 90, the number of orderings is 6!, so 90 * 720 = 64,800.

Therefore, that must be the correct answer.

So, why did I get confused before?

Because I thought that in the two-lane case, the number of sequences is 4, but that's incorrect.

Wait, in the two-lane case, the number of onto functions is 1, and the number of orderings is 2, so 1 * 2! = 2.

Therefore, in the three-lane case, the number of onto functions is 90, and the number of orderings is 6!, so 90 * 720 = 64,800.

Therefore, the answer is 64,800.

Wait, but let me do a sanity check.

In the two-lane case, 2! * 1 = 2.

In the three-lane case, 6! * 90 = 64,800.

That seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is 64,800.

But wait, in the two-lane case, is the number of sequences 2, which is 2!.

In the three-lane case, the number is 6! * 90 = 64,800.

Therefore, the formula is S(n, k) * n!.

Which is the formula for the number of onto functions multiplied by the number of orderings.

So, in general, the number of sequences is S(n, k) * n!.

Therefore, in our problem, S(6,3) * 6! = 90 * 720 = 64,800.

Therefore, the answer is 64,800.

Therefore, the number of ways is 64,800.

So, the number of ways is 64,800.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{64800}.

**Final Answer**
The number of ways is \boxed{64800}.

To determine the number of ways the cars can stack up so that all lanes are occupied, we need to consider the problem as counting the number of onto functions from the set of cars to the set of lanes, where the order of the cars matters. 

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have six cars and three lanes.
   - The order of the cars matters.
   - All three lanes must be occupied.

2. **Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion**:
   - The number of onto functions from a set of 6 elements to a set of 3 elements is given by the Stirling numbers of the second kind, \( S(6, 3) \).
   - The Stirling number \( S(6, 3) \) is 90.

3. **Considering Order**:
   - Each onto function can be permuted in \( 6! \) ways (since the order of the cars matters).

4. **Calculating the Total Number of Sequences**:
   - The total number of sequences is the product of the number of onto functions and the number of permutations of the cars.
   - This is calculated as \( S(6, 3) \times 6! = 90 \times 720 = 64800 \).

Thus, the number of ways the cars can stack up so that all lanes are occupied is \(\boxed{64800}\).
