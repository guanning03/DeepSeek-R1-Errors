Question:
A hexagon is inscribed in a circle: [asy]
pair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF, pO;
pO = (0, 0);
pA = pO + dir(-10);
pB = pO + dir(60);
pC = pO + dir(130);
pD = pO + dir(170);
pE = pO + dir(-160);
pF = pO + dir(-80);
draw(pA--pB--pC--pD--pE--pF--pA);
label("$105^\circ$", pF, N * 2);
label("$110^\circ$", pB, SW * 1.5);
label("$\alpha$", pD, E);
draw(circle(pO, 1));
[/asy] What is the measure of $\alpha$, in degrees?

Correct Answer:
Labeling our vertices will help a great deal, as will drawing a few radii: [asy]
pair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF, pO;
pO = (0, 0);
pA = pO + dir(-10);
pB = pO + dir(60);
pC = pO + dir(130);
pD = pO + dir(170);
pE = pO + dir(-160);
pF = pO + dir(-80);
draw(pA--pB--pC--pD--pE--pF--pA);
draw(pA--pO--pC--pO--pE--pO, red);
draw(circle(pO, 1));
label("$O$", pO, NE);
label("$A$", pA, E);
label("$B$", pB, NE);
label("$C$", pC, NW);
label("$D$", pD, W);
label("$E$", pE, SW);
label("$F$", pF, S);
label("$105^\circ$", pF, N * 2);
label("$110^\circ$", pB, SW * 1.5);
label("$\alpha$", pD, E);
[/asy] First of all, we see that $\angle ABC = 110^\circ$ must be half of the major arc ${AEC},$ thus arc ${AEC} = 2 \cdot \angle ABC.$ Then, the minor arc ${AC}$ must be $360^\circ - 2 \cdot \angle ABC = 360^\circ - 2 \cdot 110^\circ = 140^\circ.$

Likewise, the minor arc ${EA}$ must be $360^\circ - 2 \cdot \angle EFA = 360^\circ - 2 \cdot 105^\circ = 150^\circ,$ and the minor arc ${CE}$ is $360^\circ - 2 \alpha.$ Now, arc ${AC},$ ${CE},$ and ${EA}$ must add up to $360^\circ,$ which means that \begin{align*}
360^\circ &= (360^\circ - 2 \alpha) + 140^\circ + 150^\circ\\
360^\circ &= 650^\circ - 2\alpha\\
2\alpha &= 290^\circ\\
\alpha &= \boxed{145^\circ}.
\end{align*}

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem where a hexagon is inscribed in a circle. The Asymptote code is provided, but I think I can visualize it without running the code. Let me try to parse it.

First, the hexagon is labeled pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF. Each of these is a point on the circle, right? So, it's a regular hexagon? Wait, no, the hexagon is inscribed in the circle, but the sides might not be equal because the angles are different. Looking at the Asymptote code, the points are placed at specific angles from the center. So, pA is at -10 degrees, pB at 60 degrees, pC at 130, pD at 170, pE at -160, and pF at -80 degrees. So, each point is separated by certain angles, which probably mean that the sides of the hexagon are chords of the circle with different lengths.

The angles labeled are 105 degrees at pF, 110 degrees at pB, and we need to find alpha at pD. So, I need to find the measure of angle alpha, which is the angle at vertex pD.

Since the hexagon is inscribed in a circle, it's a cyclic hexagon. But I don't recall any specific properties of cyclic hexagons, unlike cyclic quadrilaterals which have opposite angles summing to 180 degrees. Hmm, maybe I can use the fact that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

Let me think. In a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, if I can find the intercepted arcs corresponding to these angles, I can perhaps find the measures of those arcs and then use that to find alpha.

Looking at the Asymptote code, the labels are placed at specific points:

- pF is labeled 105 degrees. So, that must be the angle at pF, which is between points pE, pF, and pA. So, the angle at pF intercepts the arc from pE to pA, right? So, the measure of angle pF is half the measure of arc pE-pA.

Similarly, pB is labeled 110 degrees. The angle at pB is between points pA, pB, and pC. So, this angle intercepts the arc from pA to pC.

pD is labeled alpha. The angle at pD is between points pC, pD, and pE. So, this angle intercepts the arc from pC to pE.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure. The angle at a vertex in a cyclic polygon intercepts the arc opposite to it, which is the arc that doesn't include the vertex. So, for angle at pF, which is between pE, pF, pA, the intercepted arc is from pE to pA, passing through the opposite side of the circle. Similarly, for angle at pB, intercepted arc from pA to pC, and for angle at pD, intercepted arc from pC to pE.

So, in general, for each angle in the hexagon, the intercepted arc is the one that's opposite to the angle. So, each angle intercepts an arc, and the measure of the angle is half the measure of that arc.

So, if I can find the measures of the intercepted arcs, I can find the measures of the angles. But we already have some angles given: 105 degrees at pF and 110 degrees at pB. So, let's find the intercepted arcs for these.

Starting with angle pF: 105 degrees. Since pF is at -80 degrees, the intercepted arc from pE to pA. So, pE is at -160 degrees, and pA is at -10 degrees. So, the arc from pE to pA going the shorter way around the circle.

Wait, but in a circle, the measure of the intercepted arc is the measure of the central angle between the two points. So, if we have points at -160 and -10, the central angle between them is |-10 - (-160)| = |150| = 150 degrees. So, the intercepted arc is 150 degrees. Therefore, angle pF is half of that, so 75 degrees. But wait, in the problem, angle pF is given as 105 degrees. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I got the intercepted arc wrong. Maybe the intercepted arc is the one that goes the other way around the circle. So, if the angle is at pF, and the intercepted arc is from pE to pA, but depending on the direction, it could be the major arc or the minor arc.

Wait, the angle at pF is 105 degrees. If the intercepted arc is 150 degrees, then half of that would be 75 degrees, but the problem says it's 105 degrees. That suggests that the angle is actually intercepting a different arc. Maybe the major arc?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the opposite arc. Let me recall that in a cyclic polygon, the angle at a vertex is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arc and its opposite arc. Wait, no, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle is half the sum of its intercepted arcs. But for a hexagon, maybe it's similar.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the arcs that are not adjacent to the angle. For angle at pF, the intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite to the sides coming out of pF.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that for each angle, the intercepted arc is the one that is not adjacent to the angle but spans the angle's sides.

Wait, another approach: in a cyclic polygon, the measure of an interior angle is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming the angle.

Wait, no, that seems unclear. Maybe another way: for a triangle inscribed in a circle, the angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. For a quadrilateral, it's half the sum of the intercepted arcs. But for a hexagon, maybe each angle intercepts two arcs, and the measure of the angle is half the sum of those arcs.

Wait, let me refer back to the definition. For a cyclic polygon, the measure of an interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming the angle. So, for vertex pF, which is between pE, pF, pA, the sides are pF-pE and pF-pA. The intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite to these sides.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try this: in a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to the angle. So, for angle at pF, the opposite arc would be the one not containing pF. So, the arc from pA to pE, passing through the other side of the circle.

Given that pA is at -10 degrees and pE is at -160 degrees, so the arc from pA to pE going the short way is 150 degrees, but the long way would be 210 degrees. But since angle at pF is 105 degrees, which is more than half of 150, so maybe it's the major arc? Wait, 105 is half of 210, so maybe the intercepted arc is 210 degrees. So, the angle at pF is half of 210, which is 105, which matches the given. So, that's the intercepted arc.

Similarly, for angle at pB, which is 110 degrees. The sides are pB-pA and pB-pC. So, the intercepted arc is the one opposite to pB. So, the arc from pA to pC not passing through pB. So, pA is at -10, pC is at 130. So, the arc from pA to pC is 140 degrees (130 - (-10) = 140). But wait, depending on the direction, it's 140 degrees or 360 - 140 = 220 degrees. Since the angle at pB is 110 degrees, which is half of 220, gives 110. So, the intercepted arc is 220 degrees.

Similarly, for angle at pD, which is alpha. The sides are pD-pC and pD-pE. So, the intercepted arc is the one opposite to pD. So, the arc from pC to pE. pC is at 130, pE is at -160. So, the arc from pC to pE is | -160 - 130 | = 290 degrees? Wait, but that's more than 180, so the minor arc would be 360 - 290 = 70 degrees. But since angle at pD is alpha, and the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. But wait, if the intercepted arc is 70, then alpha would be 35, but let's see.

Wait, maybe I need to think again. The intercepted arc for angle at pD is the arc from pC to pE that does not include pD. Since pD is at 170 degrees, the arc from pC (130) to pE (-160) passing through the other side of the circle.

Wait, let's calculate the central angle between pC and pE. pC is at 130, pE is at -160. So, the central angle is | -160 - 130 | = 290, but since we take the smaller arc, it's 360 - 290 = 70 degrees. So, the intercepted arc is 70 degrees. So, angle at pD is half of that, which is 35 degrees. So, alpha is 35 degrees. Is that correct?

Wait, let me verify.

For angle at pF: intercepted arc was 210 degrees (from pA to pE), so angle is 105 degrees, which is correct.

For angle at pB: intercepted arc was 220 degrees (from pA to pC), so angle is 110 degrees, correct.

For angle at pD: intercepted arc is 70 degrees, angle is 35 degrees.

Therefore, alpha is 35 degrees.

Wait, let me just confirm if this approach is correct.

Another way: in a cyclic polygon, the measure of each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides. So, for angle at pD, which is between pC-pD and pE-pD, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite to these sides.

So, the two arcs intercepted are the arcs from pC to pE not containing pD and the arc from pD to pD, which is zero. Wait, no, that's not the case.

Wait, no, the intercepted arcs for angle pD are the arcs that are opposite to the sides pD-pC and pD-pE. So, the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to angle pD, which would be the arc from pC to pE passing through the opposite side of the circle from pD.

So, as before, pC is at 130, pE is at -160. The arc from pC to pE passing through the opposite side is 70 degrees.

So, angle pD is half of 70, which is 35 degrees.

So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, let's think about the total sum of the arcs around the circle. The circle is 360 degrees, so the sum of all the arcs between the points should add up to 360. Let me check:

pA to pB: -10 to 60: 70 degrees.

pB to pC: 60 to 130: 70 degrees.

pC to pD: 130 to 170: 40 degrees.

pD to pE: 170 to -160: 160 degrees (since 170 - (-160) = 330, but the shorter arc is 160).

pE to pF: -160 to -80: 80 degrees.

pF to pA: -80 to -10: 70 degrees.

Adding these up: 70 + 70 + 40 + 160 + 80 + 70 = 490 degrees. Wait, that's more than 360. That can't be right. So, perhaps I'm miscalculating the arcs.

Wait, no, because when you go from pF to pA, it's from -80 to -10, which is a 70-degree arc, but going the other way is 170 degrees, but since the arc between two points is the shorter one, it's 70 degrees.

Wait, but if I add up all the arcs, they should add up to 360. But 70 + 70 + 40 + 160 + 80 + 70 is 490, which is more than 360. Therefore, some of the arcs are actually the major arcs, not the minor ones.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the arcs that are intercepted, not the arcs that are adjacent. So, for each angle, the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle.

So, for angle at pF, the intercepted arc is from pE to pA, but going the opposite way. So, that is the major arc, which is 290 degrees, but since the angle is 105, and 105 is half of 210, which is the minor arc.

Wait, so maybe the intercepted arc is the minor arc, not the major arc. So, in that case, for angle at pF, the intercepted arc is from pE to pA, the shorter arc, which is 150 degrees, so angle is half of that, 75. But in the problem, it's given as 105 degrees. Hmm, so this seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the intercepted arc is the major arc, which is 210 degrees, so angle is 105, which is half of 210. So, that's consistent.

Similarly, for angle at pB, intercepted arc is 220 degrees, which is 110, which is half of 220.

Wait, but in that case, the intercepted arc for pB is 220, which is the major arc. So, how do we know which one to take?

Wait, maybe the intercepted arc is the one that is not containing the vertex. For angle at pF, the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't contain pF. So, pE to pA, the arc that goes through the side opposite to pF. Since pF is at -80, the side opposite is the arc that goes through the rest of the circle.

So, from pE (-160) to pA (-10), the arc that doesn't pass through pF is the major arc, which is 210 degrees. So, angle at pF is half of 210, which is 105, which is given.

Similarly, for angle at pB, the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't contain pB. So, from pA to pC, the arc that doesn't pass through pB. pA is at -10, pC is at 130. The arc from pA to pC passing through the opposite side is 220 degrees (130 - (-10) = 140, but going the other way is 360 - 140 = 220). So, angle at pB is half of 220, which is 110, which matches.

Similarly, for angle at pD, the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't contain pD. So, from pC to pE, the arc that doesn't pass through pD. pC is at 130, pE is at -160. The arc from pC to pE passing through the opposite side is 70 degrees, so angle at pD is half of 70, which is 35 degrees.

So, that seems consistent.

Therefore, alpha is 35 degrees.

But just to be thorough, let me make sure that all arcs add up correctly, but considering that some arcs are the major arcs.

Wait, the total circle is 360 degrees. Let's compute all the intercepted arcs:

- Intercepted arc at pF: 210 degrees
- Intercepted arc at pB: 220 degrees
- Intercepted arc at pD: 70 degrees

Wait, but 210 + 220 + 70 = 490, which is way more. So, that can't be, because all intercepted arcs are supposed to add up to 360.

Wait, this suggests that my approach is wrong because I'm summing the intercepted arcs as 210, 220, and 70, but they should all be parts of the circle.

Wait, perhaps instead of summing intercepted arcs, I need to consider that each angle corresponds to an arc opposite to it, but each angle is part of the polygon, so perhaps the sum of all the angles in the cyclic hexagon is related to the sum of the arcs.

Wait, in a cyclic polygon, the sum of the interior angles is (n-2)*180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. For a hexagon, that would be 720 degrees. But in a cyclic hexagon, each angle is related to the arcs.

Wait, but in a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees. For a cyclic hexagon, I think the sum of all interior angles is (6-2)*180 = 720 degrees. So, maybe the sum of all the angles at the vertices is 720 degrees.

But in our case, we have three angles given: 105, 110, and alpha. So, the sum of these three angles is 105 + 110 + alpha. The sum of the other three angles is 720 - (105 + 110 + alpha). But I don't know if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming that angle.

Wait, so for each angle, say at pF, which is between pE, pF, pA, the intercepted arcs are from pE to pA, which we determined earlier is 210 degrees, so angle pF is half of that, which is 105.

Similarly, for angle at pB, which is between pA, pB, pC, the intercepted arc is from pA to pC, which is 220 degrees, so angle pB is half that, 110.

For angle at pD, which is between pC, pD, pE, the intercepted arc is from pC to pE, which is 70 degrees, so angle pD is half of that, 35.

So, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the measure of alpha is 35 degrees.

I think that makes sense. I considered the intercepted arcs for each angle, ensuring that they are the major arcs (since the given angles are larger than 90 degrees), and computed the measure accordingly.

So, I'm pretty confident that alpha is 35 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The measure of $\alpha$ is $\boxed{35}$ degrees.
</think>

To find the measure of $\alpha$ in the given cyclic hexagon inscribed in a circle, we use the property that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

1. **Angle at $pF$ (105 degrees)**:
   - This angle intercepts the arc from $pE$ to $pA$, which is 210 degrees (a major arc).
   - The measure of the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc: $105^\circ = \frac{210^\circ}{2}$.

2. **Angle at $pB$ (110 degrees)**:
   - This angle intercepts the arc from $pA$ to $pC$, which is 220 degrees (a major arc).
   - The measure of the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc: $110^\circ = \frac{220^\circ}{2}$.

3. **Angle at $pD$ ($\alpha$)**:
   - This angle intercepts the arc from $pC$ to $pE$, which is 70 degrees (a minor arc).
   - The measure of the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc: $\alpha = \frac{70^\circ}{2} = 35^\circ$.

Thus, the measure of $\alpha$ is $\boxed{35}$ degrees.
