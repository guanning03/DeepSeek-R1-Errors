Question:
For $0 \le x \le 40$ and $0 \le y \le 50,$ find the minimum value of
\[\sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{y^2 + 900} + \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100}.\]

Correct Answer:
Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ the expression becomes
\[\sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{y^2 + 900} + \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{y^2 + 900} + \sqrt{(40 - x)^2 + (50 - y)^2}.\]By QM-AM,
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{\frac{x^2 + 400}{2}} &\ge \frac{x + 20}{2}, \\
\sqrt{\frac{y^2 + 900}{2}} &\ge \frac{y + 30}{2}, \\
\sqrt{\frac{(40 - x)^2 + (50 - y)^2}{2}} &\ge \frac{(40 - x) + (50 - y)}{2},
\end{align*}so
\begin{align*}
&\sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{y^2 + 900} + \sqrt{(40 - x)^2 + (50 - y)^2} \\
&\ge \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{x + 20}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{y + 30}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{(40 - x) + (50 - y)}{2} \\
&= 70 \sqrt{2}.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $x = 20$ and $y = 30,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{70 \sqrt{2}}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum value of the expression:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{y^2 + 900} + \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100}
\]

where \(0 \leq x \leq 40\) and \(0 \leq y \leq 50\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all those square roots and variables. Let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that expressions like \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\) can represent the distance between two points. Maybe I can interpret each term as a distance and then find the minimum total distance from some fixed points.

Let me write down each term separately:

1. \(\sqrt{x^2 + 400}\): This looks like the distance from the point \((x, 0)\) to the point \((0, 20)\) because \(\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (0 - 20)^2}\) is the distance formula. So, it's the distance from \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\).

2. \(\sqrt{y^2 + 900}\): Similarly, this is the distance from \((0, y)\) to the point \((0, 30)\), because it's \(\sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (y - 30)^2}\).

3. \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100}\): Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe I can complete the squares for \(x\) and \(y\) to see if this can be expressed as a distance formula.

Let me work on the expression under the square root:

\(x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100\)

Let me group the x terms and y terms:

\((x^2 - 80x) + (y^2 - 100y) + 4100\)

Now, to complete the square for \(x^2 - 80x\), I take half of 80, which is 40, square it to get 1600. Similarly, for \(y^2 - 100y\), take half of 100, which is 50, square it to get 2500.

So, adding and subtracting these squares:

\[
(x^2 - 80x + 1600 - 1600) + (y^2 - 100y + 2500 - 2500) + 4100
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
(x - 40)^2 - 1600 + (y - 50)^2 - 2500 + 4100
\]

Adding the constants:

\(-1600 - 2500 + 4100 = (-4100) + 4100 = 0\)

So the expression under the square root simplifies to:

\[
(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2
\]

Therefore, the third term is the distance from the point \((x, y)\) to the point \((40, 50)\).

So, putting it all together, the expression represents the sum of three distances:

1. From \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\)
2. From \((0, y)\) to \((0, 30)\)
3. From \((x, y)\) to \((40, 50)\)

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. The first term is distance from \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\), the second term is distance from \((0, y)\) to \((0, 30)\), and the third term is distance from \((x, y)\) to \((40, 50)\). Hmm, but all these terms are separate. So, actually, the total expression is the sum of three distances:

- From some point on the x-axis \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\)
- From some point on the y-axis \((0, y)\) to \((0, 30)\)
- From the same point \((x, y)\) to \((40, 50)\)

Wait, but is that the case? Or is the third term a distance from a point \((x, y)\) to \((40, 50)\), but that point \((x, y)\) is also being used in the first two terms?

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize.

Alternatively, maybe I can interpret the entire expression as the sum of distances from three different points. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can consider all three terms as distances from a moving point \((x, y)\) to fixed points. But actually, the first two terms involve \(x\) and \(y\), while the third term is a function of \(x\) and \(y\) as well.

Wait, perhaps I can visualize this as a point \((x, y)\) moving in the plane, and the total expression is the sum of three distances: one from \((x, y)\) to \((0, 20)\), another from \((x, y)\) to \((0, 30)\), and the third from \((x, y)\) to \((40, 50)\). But that doesn't directly make sense because the first two terms have \(x\) and \(y\) in them.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of each term as separate and then see if we can find a geometric interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps an optimization technique is needed here, like calculus, to minimize the expression. Since \(x\) and \(y\) are variables, we can take partial derivatives with respect to \(x\) and \(y\), set them to zero, and solve for the critical points. Then check if they lie within the given domain \(0 \leq x \leq 40\), \(0 \leq y \leq 50\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to interpret the sum of these square roots as a path or something in geometry. Hmm.

Let me try the calculus approach.

Let me denote the function as:

\[
f(x, y) = \sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{y^2 + 900} + \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}
\]

We need to find the minimum of \(f(x, y)\) over \(0 \leq x \leq 40\) and \(0 \leq y \leq 50\).

To find the critical points, I need to compute the partial derivatives of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) and \(y\), set them to zero, and solve.

First, compute the partial derivative with respect to \(x\):

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 400}} + 0 + \frac{(x - 40)}{\sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}}
\]

Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to \(y\):

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0 + \frac{y}{\sqrt{y^2 + 900}} + \frac{(y - 50)}{\sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}}
\]

Set both partial derivatives to zero:

1. \(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 400}} + \frac{(x - 40)}{\sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}} = 0\)

2. \(\frac{y}{\sqrt{y^2 + 900}} + \frac{(y - 50)}{\sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}} = 0\)

Let me denote:

Let \(A = \sqrt{x^2 + 400}\), so \(\frac{x}{A} = \frac{x}{A}\).

Let \(B = \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}\), so \(\frac{(x - 40)}{B}\).

Similarly, \(C = \sqrt{y^2 + 900}\), so \(\frac{y}{C}\).

Let \(D = \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}\), so \(\frac{(y - 50)}{D}\).

So, the equations become:

1. \(\frac{x}{A} + \frac{(x - 40)}{D} = 0\)

2. \(\frac{y}{C} + \frac{(y - 50)}{D} = 0\)

Let me write these equations as:

1. \(\frac{x}{A} = -\frac{(x - 40)}{D}\)

2. \(\frac{y}{C} = -\frac{(y - 50)}{D}\)

So, from equation 1:

\(\frac{x}{A} = -\frac{(x - 40)}{D}\)

Cross-multiplying:

\(x D = -A (x - 40)\)

Similarly, from equation 2:

\(\frac{y}{C} = -\frac{(y - 50)}{D}\)

Cross-multiplying:

\(y D = -C (y - 50)\)

So, we have:

1. \(x D = -A (x - 40)\)

2. \(y D = -C (y - 50)\)

Now, let's substitute \(A = \sqrt{x^2 + 400}\), \(C = \sqrt{y^2 + 900}\), and \(D = \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}\).

So, equation 1:

\(x \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2} = -\sqrt{x^2 + 400} (x - 40)\)

Similarly, equation 2:

\(y \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2} = -\sqrt{y^2 + 900} (y - 50)\)

Hmm, these seem a bit complicated, but maybe we can square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

Starting with equation 1:

Left side: \(x \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}\)

Right side: \(-\sqrt{x^2 + 400} (x - 40)\)

Square both sides:

\(x^2 [(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2] = x^2 + 400 \cdot (x - 40)^2\)

Similarly, for equation 2:

Left side: \(y \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}\)

Right side: \(-\sqrt{y^2 + 900} (y - 50)\)

Square both sides:

\(y^2 [(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2] = y^2 + 900 \cdot (y - 50)^2\)

So, now we have two equations:

1. \(x^2 [(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2] = x^2 + 400 (x - 40)^2\)

2. \(y^2 [(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2] = y^2 + 900 (y - 50)^2\)

Let me simplify equation 1 first.

Left side: \(x^2 [(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2]\)

Right side: \(x^2 + 400 (x - 40)^2\)

Bring everything to the left side:

\(x^2 [(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2] - x^2 - 400 (x - 40)^2 = 0\)

Factor out \(x^2\):

\(x^2 [(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2 - 1 - 400 \frac{(x - 40)^2}{x^2}] = 0\)

Wait, that might not be the best approach. Maybe expand the left side:

First, expand \(x^2[(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2]\):

= \(x^2(x^2 - 80x + 1600) + x^2(y^2 - 100y + 2500)\)

= \(x^4 - 80x^3 + 1600x^2 + x^2 y^2 - 100x^2 y + 2500x^2\)

Then subtract \(x^2 + 400(x^2 - 80x + 1600)\):

= \(x^4 - 80x^3 + 1600x^2 + x^2 y^2 - 100x^2 y + 2500x^2 - x^2 - 400x^2 + 32000\)

Simplify term by term:

- \(x^4\)
- \(-80x^3\)
- \(1600x^2 + 2500x^2 - 400x^2 = (1600 + 2500 - 400)x^2 = 2700x^2\)
- \(x^2 y^2\)
- \(-100x^2 y\)
- \( -x^2\)
- \(32000\)

So overall:

\(x^4 - 80x^3 + x^2 y^2 - 100x^2 y + 2700x^2 - x^2 + 32000 = 0\)

Similarly, let's expand equation 2.

Left side: \(y^2[(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2]\)

= \(y^2(x^2 - 80x + 1600) + y^2(y^2 - 100y + 2500)\)

= \(x^2 y^2 - 80x y^2 + 1600 y^2 + y^4 - 100y^3 + 2500 y^2\)

Right side: \(y^2 + 900(y^2 - 100y + 2500)\)

= \(y^2 + 900y^2 - 90000y + 2250000\)

Bring everything to the left side:

\(x^2 y^2 - 80x y^2 + 1600 y^2 + y^4 - 100y^3 + 2500 y^2 - y^2 - 900y^2 + 90000y - 2250000 = 0\)

Simplify term by term:

- \(x^2 y^2\)
- \(-80x y^2\)
- \(1600 y^2 + 2500 y^2 - y^2 - 900y^2 = (1600 + 2500 - 1 - 900)y^2 = 3199y^2\)
- \(y^4\)
- \(-100y^3\)
- \(90000y\)
- \(-2250000\)

So overall:

\(x^2 y^2 - 80x y^2 + y^4 - 100y^3 + 3199y^2 + 90000y - 2250000 = 0\)

Now, we have two equations:

1. \(x^4 - 80x^3 + x^2 y^2 - 100x^2 y + 2700x^2 - x^2 + 32000 = 0\)

2. \(x^2 y^2 - 80x y^2 + y^4 - 100y^3 + 3199y^2 + 90000y - 2250000 = 0\)

These equations look pretty complicated. Maybe I can factor them or find a relationship between x and y.

Looking back at the original partial derivatives, I notice that both equations have similar terms. Maybe there is a relationship between x and y that can be found by manipulating these equations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the minimal point occurs when the three terms are balanced in some way, maybe when the angles between the vectors are equal or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider specific points where x and y are within the given ranges and see if they satisfy the equations.

Wait, maybe I can test some points.

First, let's try \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\):

Compute partial derivatives:

For \(x = 0\):

Equation 1: \(0 - 0 + 0 - 0 + 0 - 0 + 32000 = 32000 \neq 0\)

Equation 2: \(0 - 0 + 0 - 0 + 0 + 0 - 2250000 = -2250000 \neq 0\)

So, not a critical point.

Next, try \(x = 40\), \(y = 50\):

Equation 1: \(40^4 - 80*40^3 + 40^2*50^2 - 100*40^2*50 + 2700*40^2 - 40^2 + 32000\)

Compute each term:

- \(40^4 = 2560000\)
- \(80*40^3 = 80*64000 = 5120000\)
- \(40^2*50^2 = 1600*2500 = 4,000,000\)
- \(100*40^2*50 = 100*1600*50 = 8,000,000\)
- \(2700*40^2 = 2700*1600 = 4,320,000\)
- \(40^2 = 1600\)

So putting it all together:

2560000 - 5120000 + 4,000,000 - 8,000,000 + 4,320,000 - 1600 + 32000

Compute step by step:

2560000 - 5120000 = -2560000

-2560000 + 4,000,000 = 1,440,000

1,440,000 - 8,000,000 = -6,560,000

-6,560,000 + 4,320,000 = -2,240,000

-2,240,000 - 1600 = -2,241,600

-2,241,600 + 32000 = -2,209,600 ≠ 0

Similarly, equation 2 at (40,50):

\(40^2*50^2 - 80*40*50^2 + 50^4 - 100*50^3 + 3199*50^2 + 90000*50 - 2250000\)

Compute each term:

- \(40^2*50^2 = 1600*2500 = 4,000,000\)
- \(80*40*50^2 = 80*40*2500 = 8,000*2500 = 20,000,000\)
- \(50^4 = 6,250,000\)
- \(100*50^3 = 100*125000 = 12,500,000\)
- \(3199*50^2 = 3199*2500 = 7,997,500\)
- \(90000*50 = 4,500,000\)

So plug in:

4,000,000 - 20,000,000 + 6,250,000 - 12,500,000 + 7,997,500 + 4,500,000 - 2,250,000

Compute step by step:

4,000,000 - 20,000,000 = -16,000,000

-16,000,000 + 6,250,000 = -9,750,000

-9,750,000 -12,500,000 = -22,250,000

-22,250,000 + 7,997,500 = -14,252,500

-14,252,500 + 4,500,000 = -9,752,500

-9,752,500 - 2,250,000 = -12,002,500 ≠ 0

So, (40,50) is not a critical point either.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider another approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe the minimal value is achieved when all three terms are minimized individually, but considering the coordinates, perhaps not. Wait, actually, the expression is a sum of three distances, each involving different points.

Wait, perhaps we can interpret the entire expression as the sum of three distances from the point \((x, y)\) to three fixed points:

1. From \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\)
2. From \((x, y)\) to \((0, 30)\)
3. From \((x, y)\) to \((40, 50)\)

Wait, but that's not quite right, because the second term is a distance from \((0, y)\) to \((0, 30)\), which is along the y-axis, while the third term is a distance from \((x, y)\) to \((40, 50)\). So, maybe if I can find a point \((x, y)\) such that it minimizes the sum of these three distances.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the first term is the distance from \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\), the second term is the distance from \((0, y)\) to \((0, 30)\), and the third term is the distance from \((x, y)\) to \((40, 50)\). So, if we can find a path that goes from some point on \((0, 20)\), then to \((0, 30)\), and then to \((40, 50)\), but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, think of it as the sum of three distances: from \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\), from \((0, y)\) to \((0, 30)\), and from \((x, y)\) to \((40, 50)\). But that seems a bit jumbled.

Wait, maybe I can fix \((x, 0)\) and \((0, y)\) and see how the total distance changes with \(x\) and \(y\). But this might not lead me anywhere.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the first two terms as separate distances:

- Distance from \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\)
- Distance from \((0, y)\) to \((0, 30)\)

So, the sum of these two is like moving from \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\) and then to \((0, 30)\). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps if I fix \(x\) and \(y\), then the first term is fixed for that \(x\), the second term is fixed for that \(y\), and the third term is fixed for that \((x, y)\). So, perhaps I can find a point \((x, y)\) that minimizes the sum.

Alternatively, maybe I can use reflection to solve the problem. Like reflecting points across axes or something to find a straight line path.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can consider the problem as a path that goes from \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\), then to \((0, 30)\), and then to \((40, 50)\), but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, think of the first two terms as moving from \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\) and then to \((0, 30)\). So, the total distance is the sum of these two, and then the third term is the distance from \((x, y)\) to \((40, 50)\). Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as a path that goes from \((x, 0)\) to some point and then to \((0, 30)\), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should try to interpret the problem in terms of vectors or geometric transformations.

Wait, here's another idea: The first term is the distance from \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\), which is \(\sqrt{x^2 + 400}\).

The second term is the distance from \((0, y)\) to \((0, 30)\), which is \(\sqrt{y^2 + 900}\).

The third term is the distance from \((x, y)\) to \((40, 50)\), which is \(\sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}\).

So, the total expression is:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{y^2 + 900} + \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}
\]

Perhaps I can consider each term as the hypotenuse of a right triangle and then try to find a minimal path.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I can use the triangle inequality or some geometric principle to find the minimal sum.

Alternatively, think of \(\sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}\) as the distance between the point \((x, y)\) and \((40, 50)\).

Similarly, \(\sqrt{x^2 + 400}\) is the distance from \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\), and \(\sqrt{y^2 + 900}\) is the distance from \((0, y)\) to \((0, 30)\).

But perhaps if I can find a path that goes from \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\), then to \((0, 30)\), then to \((40, 50)\), but I'm not sure.

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe I can try to visualize what's happening.

Imagine that I have a point \((x, 0)\) moving along the x-axis from 0 to 40, and a point \((0, y)\) moving along the y-axis from 0 to 50. The expression is the sum of two distances from these moving points to fixed target points plus the distance from \((x, y)\) to another fixed point.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize this problem. Let me fix \(x\) and \(y\), and then compute the expression. But since I need to find the minimal value, maybe I can take derivatives and set them to zero, but that leads to complicated equations.

Wait, maybe I can consider the expression as the sum of three terms, each involving one variable. Maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or something similar.

But since each term is a square root, adding them up might not directly lead to a simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Minkowski inequality, which states that for vectors, the sum of the magnitudes is greater than or equal to the magnitude of the sum.

Wait, let me think: If I consider the vectors:

- From \((0, 20)\) to \((x, 0)\): \((x, -20)\)
- From \((0, 30)\) to \((0, y)\): \((0, y - 30)\)
- From \((40, 50)\) to \((x, y)\): \((x - 40, y - 50)\)

But I don't see an immediate application here.

Wait, perhaps I can consider reflecting a point across an axis to make the problem easier.

Wait, here's an idea: The expression can be thought of as the sum of distances from three different points, but only involving part of the coordinates.

Wait, let me try to consider this: If I have a point \((x, y)\), and I need to compute distances to three places, but two of them involve moving along the axes and the third is a free point.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the first two terms as separate and then the third term as another.

Wait, the first term is \(\sqrt{x^2 + 400}\), which is the distance from \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\). The second term is \(\sqrt{y^2 + 900}\), the distance from \((0, y)\) to \((0, 30)\). The third term is the distance from \((x, y)\) to \((40, 50)\).

So, perhaps the point \((x, y)\) is somewhere that allows me to minimize the sum of these three distances.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can fix \(x\) and then find the optimal \(y\), or vice versa.

But since both variables are involved, it's tricky.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I can observe that the expression is convex, so the minimal value occurs at an interior point where the partial derivatives are zero.

So, maybe the critical point is inside the domain \(0 \leq x \leq 40\), \(0 \leq y \leq 50\).

So, if I can find \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy the partial derivative equations, those would be the critical points. Then, I can compute the value and see if it's the minimal.

But the system of equations is complicated. Let me see if I can manipulate the equations.

From equation 1:

\(x D = -A (x - 40)\)

From equation 2:

\(y D = -C (y - 50)\)

So, let me write:

\(x = \frac{-A (x - 40)}{D}\)

\(y = \frac{-C (y - 50)}{D}\)

But \(A = \sqrt{x^2 + 400}\), \(C = \sqrt{y^2 + 900}\), and \(D = \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}\)

Let me denote \(A = \sqrt{x^2 + 400}\), so \(x = -A (x - 40)/D\)

Similarly, \(y = -C (y - 50)/D\)

Hmm, I can write:

\(x D = -A (x - 40)\)

\(y D = -C (y - 50)\)

Let me denote \(x D + A (x - 40) = 0\)

Similarly, \(y D + C (y - 50) = 0\)

Let me denote \(x D + A x - 40 A = 0\)

Similarly, \(y D + C y - 50 C = 0\)

Thus,

\(x (D + A) = 40 A\)

\(y (D + C) = 50 C\)

Hmm, interesting.

So,

\(x = \frac{40 A}{D + A}\)

\(y = \frac{50 C}{D + C}\)

So, that's an interesting relation.

So, now, since \(A = \sqrt{x^2 + 400}\), \(C = \sqrt{y^2 + 900}\), and \(D = \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}\), perhaps I can substitute these expressions into each other.

So, let me write:

\(x = \frac{40 \sqrt{x^2 + 400}}{\sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2} + \sqrt{x^2 + 400}}\)

Similarly,

\(y = \frac{50 \sqrt{y^2 + 900}}{\sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2} + \sqrt{y^2 + 900}}\)

Hmm, these equations are still complex because they involve both \(x\) and \(y\).

Alternatively, maybe I can make a substitution: Let me define:

Let \(a = x\), \(b = y\), \(c = \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}\)

So, the equations become:

\(a = \frac{40 \sqrt{a^2 + 400}}{c + \sqrt{a^2 + 400}}\)

\(b = \frac{50 \sqrt{b^2 + 900}}{c + \sqrt{b^2 + 900}}\)

And \(c = \sqrt{(a - 40)^2 + (b - 50)^2}\)

This substitution might not help much, unless I can find a relationship between \(a\) and \(b\).

Wait, another approach: Maybe assume that the minimal occurs at \(x = 40\) and \(y = 50\), but earlier, I saw that the expression at (40,50) is 32000 + 9000000 - 2250000 = -2209600, which is negative. Wait, but the function is a sum of square roots, which are always positive. So, the expression can't be negative because each term is a square root, which is non-negative. So, my earlier calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let me recalculate:

At (40,50):

First term: \(\sqrt{40^2 + 400} = \sqrt{1600 + 400} = \sqrt{2000} ≈ 44.72\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{50^2 + 900} = \sqrt{2500 + 900} = \sqrt{3400} ≈ 58.31\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(40 - 40)^2 + (50 - 50)^2} = 0\)

So, total expression ≈ 44.72 + 58.31 + 0 ≈ 103.03

Wait, that's positive. So, I must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate:

Wait, \(f(40,50)\):

First term: \(\sqrt{40^2 + 20^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 400} = \sqrt{2000} ≈ 44.721\) (since \(20^2 = 400\), so 40^2 + 20^2 = 1600 + 400 = 2000)

Second term: \(\sqrt{0^2 + 30^2} = \sqrt{0 + 900} = 30\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(40 - 40)^2 + (50 - 50)^2} = 0\)

So total expression ≈ 44.721 + 30 + 0 ≈ 74.721

Not 32000, which was wrong. I think I miscalculated earlier.

So, at (40,50), the expression is approximately 74.721, which is positive.

Similarly, at (0,0):

First term: \(\sqrt{0 + 400} = 20\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{0 + 900} = 30\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{1600 + 2500} = \sqrt{4100} ≈ 64.03\)

Total ≈ 20 + 30 + 64.03 ≈ 114.03

So, at (40,50), the expression is ~74.72, which is lower.

So, maybe the minimal is around there.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal is at (0,0). But let's see.

Wait, perhaps the minimal occurs at (0,0). Let me check another point.

For example, at (0, 20):

First term: \(\sqrt{0 + 400} = 20\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{20^2 + 900} = \sqrt{400 + 900} = \sqrt{1300} ≈ 36.06\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(0 - 40)^2 + (20 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 900} = \sqrt{2500} = 50\)

Total ≈ 20 + 36.06 + 50 ≈ 106.06

Which is higher than at (40,50).

Similarly, at (0,30):

First term: \(\sqrt{0 + 400} = 20\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{30^2 + 900} = \sqrt{900 + 900} = \sqrt{1800} ≈ 42.43\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(0 - 40)^2 + (30 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 400} = \sqrt{2000} ≈ 44.72\)

Total ≈ 20 + 42.43 + 44.72 ≈ 107.15

So, higher than at (40,50).

Alternatively, try (20, 30):

First term: \(\sqrt{400 + 400} = \sqrt{800} ≈ 28.28\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{900 + 900} = \sqrt{1800} ≈ 42.43\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(20 - 40)^2 + (30 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{400 + 400} = \sqrt{800} ≈ 28.28\)

Total ≈ 28.28 + 42.43 + 28.28 ≈ 99.0

Still higher than at (40,50).

Alternatively, maybe the minimal is somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that when \(x = 40\) and \(y = 50\), but that seems not necessarily the minimal. Maybe somewhere else.

Alternatively, think of using calculus to find the minimal.

Wait, maybe instead of solving for \(x\) and \(y\) from the partial derivatives, perhaps I can find a relationship.

Let me go back to the partial derivatives.

From equation 1: \(x D = -A (x - 40)\)

From equation 2: \(y D = -C (y - 50)\)

Divide equation 1 by equation 2:

\[
\frac{x D}{y D} = \frac{-A (x - 40)}{-C (y - 50)}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{A (x - 40)}{C (y - 50)}
\]

But \(A = \sqrt{x^2 + 400}\), \(C = \sqrt{y^2 + 900}\), so:

\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 400} (x - 40)}{\sqrt{y^2 + 900} (y - 50)}
\]

This is a complicated equation, but perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

So,

\[
\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 400} (x - 40)}{\sqrt{y^2 + 900} (y - 50)}\right)^2
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x^2}{y^2} = \frac{(x^2 + 400)(x - 40)^2}{(y^2 + 900)(y - 50)^2}
\]

Cross-multiplying:

\[
x^2 (y^2 + 900)(y - 50)^2 = y^2 (x^2 + 400)(x - 40)^2
\]

This is a complex equation, but maybe I can find a substitution or a ratio between \(x\) and \(y\).

Let me denote \(k = \frac{x}{y}\), so \(x = k y\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
(k y)^2 (y^2 + 900)(y - 50)^2 = y^2 ((k y)^2 + 400)(k y - 40)^2
\]

Simplify:

Left side: \(k^2 y^2 (y^2 + 900)(y - 50)^2\)

Right side: \(y^2 (k^2 y^2 + 400)(k y - 40)^2\)

Divide both sides by \(y^2\):

\(k^2 (y^2 + 900)(y - 50)^2 = (k^2 y^2 + 400)(k y - 40)^2\)

This seems still complicated, but maybe we can find a value of \(k\) that satisfies this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that \(x = 40\) and \(y = 50\), but we already saw that the expression is not minimized there.

Alternatively, perhaps \(x\) and \(y\) are proportional to the constants in the first two terms: 20 and 30.

Wait, the first term is \(\sqrt{x^2 + 20^2}\), the second term is \(\sqrt{y^2 + 30^2}\).

So, if I consider these, perhaps the minimal path is achieved when these two terms are minimized, but it's not straightforward.

Wait, another idea: Maybe consider reflecting the point \((40,50)\) across the y-axis or x-axis to create a straight line path.

Wait, reflecting \((40,50)\) across the y-axis gives \((-40,50)\). Then, the distance from \((x, y)\) to \((40,50)\) is the same as the distance from \((x, y)\) to \((-40,50)\), but that might not help.

Alternatively, reflecting across the x-axis gives \((40,-50)\), but again, not sure.

Alternatively, reflecting across the point \((0,0)\), but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps not. Another thought: Maybe I can use a method where I reflect the point \((40,50)\) across the y-axis or x-axis and then find a straight line path.

Let me try reflecting \((40,50)\) across the y-axis to get \((-40,50)\). Then, the distance from \((x, y)\) to \((40,50)\) is equal to the distance from \((x, y)\) to \((-40,50)\). Hmm, but that doesn't help me because I still have the other two terms.

Alternatively, maybe reflecting across both axes.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I can consider the problem as minimizing the sum of three distances, which can be represented as the sum of three paths. Maybe reflecting points to turn it into a straight line.

Wait, for example, in the classic problem of minimizing the sum of two distances, reflecting one point across a line allows you to turn the problem into finding a straight line. Maybe in this case, I can do something similar with multiple reflections.

Wait, perhaps I can reflect the point \((40,50)\) across the y-axis and then across the x-axis, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the problem differently. Suppose I have three points: \(A = (0, 20)\), \(B = (0, 30)\), and \(C = (40, 50)\). The expression is the sum of distances from a point \((x, y)\) to these three points.

Wait, no, actually, the expression is a combination of two distances from points moving along the axes and the third as a free point.

Wait, maybe it's possible to model this as a path that goes from \(A\) to \(B\) to \((x, y)\) to \(C\). But no, that's not quite right.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the first two terms can be thought of as moving from the origin to \((0, 20)\) and then to \((0, 30)\), and the third term is another point. But I don't see a direct geometric interpretation.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the first two terms as part of a path from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\) to \((0, 30)\), and the third term as a free point. But that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal path is achieved by reflecting the point \((40,50)\) across the y-axis or x-axis.

Wait, let me try reflecting \((40,50)\) across the y-axis to get \((-40,50)\). Then, the distance from \((x, y)\) to \((40,50)\) is the same as the distance from \((x, y)\) to \((-40,50)\). So, maybe I can use that to create a straight line path.

Wait, so, maybe the minimal path is the sum of the distance from \((x, y)\) to \((0, 20)\), to \((0, 30)\), and to \((-40,50)\). Then, the total distance would be the distance from \((0, 20)\) to \((0, 30)\) plus the distance from \((0, 30)\) to \((-40,50)\). But that seems not directly applicable.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps I can use the method of images to represent the problem as a straight line in a reflected coordinate system.

Let me explain: In problems where you need to minimize the sum of distances, sometimes reflecting points across axes or lines can help turn the problem into finding a straight line.

For example, in the classic problem of finding the shortest path that reflects off a mirror, you reflect one point across the mirror, and the minimal path becomes a straight line from the original point to the reflected point.

Maybe I can do something similar here.

Wait, the first two terms are \(\sqrt{x^2 + 20^2}\) and \(\sqrt{y^2 + 30^2}\), which can be thought of as moving from \((0, 0)\) to \((x, 20)\) and then to \((0, y)\). So, perhaps if I reflect the point \((40,50)\) across the y-axis or x-axis, the minimal path would be a straight line.

Wait, let me try reflecting \((40,50)\) across the y-axis to get \((-40,50)\). Then, the distance from \((x, y)\) to \((40,50)\) is equal to the distance from \((x, y)\) to \((-40,50)\). So, perhaps the minimal path is the sum of three distances: from \((0, 20)\) to \((0, y)\), then to \((x, y)\), then to \((40,50)\). But I don't see a direct connection.

Alternatively, perhaps reflecting \((40,50)\) across the x-axis to get \((40, -50)\), but again, not sure.

Wait, another idea: Maybe consider the first two terms as the lengths from \((0,0)\) to \((x, 20)\) and from \((0, y)\) to \((0, 30)\). So, if I reflect \((0,30)\) across the x-axis, but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the first two terms as moving from \((0,0)\) to \((x,20)\) and then to \((0,y)\), and the third term as moving from \((x,y)\) to \((40,50)\). So, the total path is from \((0,0)\) to \((x,20)\) to \((0,y)\) to \((40,50)\). To minimize the total distance, I can reflect the starting point across one of the axes to make the path straight.

Wait, here's a method: To find the shortest path that reflects off two lines, you can reflect the starting point over one line and then reflect the endpoint over the other line, and then connect the two reflected points with a straight line. The points where the straight line intersects the original lines give the reflection points.

But in this case, it's a bit more complicated because we have three points and two reflections.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a path from \((0,0)\) to \((x,20)\) to \((0,y)\) to \((40,50)\). To make this a straight line, I can reflect \((40,50)\) across the y-axis or x-axis.

Wait, let me try reflecting \((40,50)\) across the y-axis to get \((-40,50)\). Then, the path from \((x, y)\) to \((40,50)\) is the same as the path from \((x, y)\) to \((-40,50)\). So, the total path is from \((0,0)\) to \((x,20)\) to \((0,y)\) to \((-40,50)\). Then, the minimal path is the straight line from \((0,0)\) to \((-40,50)\), which would cross the y-axis at some point, say \((0, a)\), and the x-axis at some point, say \((b, 0)\). Then, the reflections would give \((x,20)\) and \((0,y)\).

Wait, this is getting a bit convoluted, but perhaps this approach can work.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let me denote the reflection of \((40,50)\) across the y-axis as \((-40,50)\), which is point \(C'\).

Then, the path from \((x, y)\) to \((40,50)\) is equivalent to the path from \((x, y)\) to \((-40,50)\). So, the total path is from \((0,0)\) to \((x,20)\) to \((0,y)\) to \((-40,50)\). The minimal path would be the straight line from \((0,0)\) to \((-40,50)\), intersecting the y-axis at some point.

But in this case, the point \((0, y)\) is on the y-axis, so the path from \((x, y)\) to \((0,y)\) is just a horizontal line, which is the same as \((x, y)\) to \((0, y)\).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try another approach: Using the method of images for multiple reflections.

Suppose I want to find the shortest path that goes from \((0,0)\) to \((x,20)\) to \((0,y)\) to \((40,50)\). To make this a straight line, I can reflect the starting point across one axis and the endpoint across the other.

Wait, more accurately, to make the path from \((0,0)\) to \((x,20)\) to \((0,y)\) to \((40,50)\) a straight line, I can reflect \((40,50)\) across the y-axis to get \((-40,50)\), and then the path from \((0,0)\) to \((x,20)\) to \((0,y)\) to \((-40,50)\) is a straight line.

Therefore, the minimal path would be the straight line from \((0,0)\) to \((-40,50)\), which intersects the y-axis at some point. The intersection point would be the point \((0, a)\), where \(a\) is between 0 and 50.

The equation of the straight line from \((0,0)\) to \((-40,50)\) is:

\(y = \frac{50}{-40}x = -\frac{5}{4}x\)

So, at \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\), and at \(x = -40\), \(y = 50\).

But since we're interested in the point \((0, a)\) on the y-axis, which is the intersection of this line with the y-axis, it's at \((0,0)\). That doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps instead, I can consider reflecting the endpoint \((40,50)\) across the y-axis to get \((-40,50)\), and then the minimal path is the straight line from \((0,0)\) to \((-40,50)\), which would cross the y-axis at some point, but that point would be \((0,0)\), which is already on the y-axis.

Wait, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can reflect \((40,50)\) across the x-axis to get \((40,-50)\), and then the minimal path is a straight line from \((0,0)\) to \((40,-50)\). But that would cross the x-axis at some point.

Wait, but \((0,0)\) is on both axes, so maybe that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe reflecting \((0,0)\) across the y-axis to get \((0,0)\), which doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I can't use this method because the reflections are not across different axes.

Alternatively, maybe reflecting \((40,50)\) across both axes.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, another idea: Since the expression is the sum of three terms, maybe I can use the triangle inequality to bound the expression.

But given the problem's complexity, I think it's better to proceed with calculus.

So, let's get back to the partial derivatives.

We had:

1. \(x D = -A (x - 40)\)

2. \(y D = -C (y - 50)\)

Where \(A = \sqrt{x^2 + 400}\), \(C = \sqrt{y^2 + 900}\), and \(D = \sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}\).

Let me try dividing equation 1 by equation 2:

\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{-A (x - 40)}{-C (y - 50)} = \frac{A (x - 40)}{C (y - 50)}
\]

So,

\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 400} (x - 40)}{\sqrt{y^2 + 900} (y - 50)}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{\sqrt{(x^2 + 400)} (x - 40)}{\sqrt{(y^2 + 900)} (y - 50)}
\]

Cross-multiplying:

\[
x \sqrt{y^2 + 900} (y - 50) = y \sqrt{x^2 + 400} (x - 40)
\]

This equation seems difficult to solve analytically, so maybe I can make an assumption that \(x\) and \(y\) are proportional to the constants in the first two terms, which are 20 and 30.

Wait, the first term is \(\sqrt{x^2 + 20^2}\), which is a distance from \((x, 0)\) to \((0, 20)\). The second term is \(\sqrt{y^2 + 30^2}\), a distance from \((0, y)\) to \((0, 30)\). So, maybe the minimal path occurs when the angles of incidence and reflection are equal, similar to the law of reflection.

Wait, that might be a way to approach it.

Wait, if I consider the path from \((0, 0)\) to \((x, 20)\) to \((0, y)\) to \((40, 50)\), then the reflection method could be applied.

Wait, here's a thought: Reflect the point \((40,50)\) across the y-axis to get \((-40,50)\). Then, the minimal path from \((x, y)\) to \((40,50)\) is the same as the minimal path from \((x, y)\) to \((-40,50)\).

So, the total path is from \((0,0)\) to \((x,20)\) to \((0,y)\) to \((-40,50)\).

Now, the minimal path would be a straight line from \((0,0)\) to \((-40,50)\), intersecting the y-axis at some point \((0, a)\). The point \((0, a)\) would be the intersection of the line from \((0,0)\) to \((-40,50)\) with the y-axis.

Wait, but the line from \((0,0)\) to \((-40,50)\) is \(y = -\frac{5}{4}x\), which only passes through the origin and \((-40,50)\). So, the only intersection with the y-axis is at the origin.

Wait, that doesn't help because we already have \((0,0)\) in the path. Maybe I need a different reflection.

Wait, perhaps I need to reflect across both axes.

Wait, another method: To find the shortest path from \((0,0)\) to \((x,20)\) to \((0,y)\) to \((40,50)\), we can reflect the starting point across one axis and the endpoint across the other.

Wait, suppose I reflect \((0,0)\) across the y-axis to get \((0,0)\), which doesn't help. Reflecting across the x-axis to get \((0,0)\) again. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, alternatively, reflecting \((40,50)\) across the y-axis gives \((-40,50)\), as before. Then, the straight line from \((0,0)\) to \((-40,50)\) would cross the y-axis at some point.

Wait, actually, that's the same as the previous approach, which only gives the origin.

Alternatively, reflecting \((40,50)\) across the x-axis gives \((40,-50)\), and reflecting \((0,0)\) across the y-axis gives \((0,0)\). Maybe the minimal path is a straight line from \((0,0)\) to \((40,-50)\), which would cross the y-axis at some point.

Wait, let's calculate that. The line from \((0,0)\) to \((40,-50)\) has a slope of \(-50/40 = -5/4\), so the equation is \(y = -\frac{5}{4}x\), which only passes through the origin and \((40,-50)\). So, no intersection with the y-axis other than the origin.

Wait, so reflecting \((40,50)\) across the x-axis gives \((40,-50)\), but the line from \((0,0)\) to \((40,-50)\) doesn't help because it only intersects the y-axis at the origin.

Wait, maybe I need to reflect \((0,0)\) across the x-axis to get \((0,0)\), which doesn't help, or reflect across the y-axis to get \((0,0)\), which also doesn't help.

This seems like a dead end.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can consider that the minimal path from \((0,0)\) to \((x,20)\) to \((0,y)\) to \((40,50)\) is minimized when the angles of incidence and reflection are equal with respect to the y-axis.

Wait, that is, reflecting \((40,50)\) across the y-axis to get \((-40,50)\), and then the minimal path is a straight line from \((0,0)\) to \((-40,50)\), which intersects the y-axis at the origin.

But that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let's think numerically.

Earlier, I found that at \((40,50)\), the expression is approximately 74.72. Maybe that's the minimal value? But I'm not sure. Maybe I can test another point.

Wait, let's try \((20, 40)\):

First term: \(\sqrt{20^2 + 20^2} = \sqrt{400 + 400} = \sqrt{800} ≈ 28.28\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{40^2 + 900} = \sqrt{1600 + 900} = \sqrt{2500} = 50\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(20 - 40)^2 + (40 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{400 + 100} = \sqrt{500} ≈ 22.36\)

Total ≈ 28.28 + 50 + 22.36 ≈ 100.64

Which is higher than at (40,50).

Wait, what about \((50, 30)\):

First term: \(\sqrt{50^2 + 20^2} = \sqrt{2500 + 400} = \sqrt{2900} ≈ 53.85\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{30^2 + 900} = \sqrt{900 + 900} = \sqrt{1800} ≈ 42.43\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(50 - 40)^2 + (30 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{100 + 400} = \sqrt{500} ≈ 22.36\)

Total ≈ 53.85 + 42.43 + 22.36 ≈ 118.64

Still higher.

Wait, maybe the minimal is indeed at (40,50), giving approximately 74.72.

But let me confirm by checking another point. Let's try \((30, 40)\):

First term: \(\sqrt{30^2 + 20^2} = \sqrt{900 + 400} = \sqrt{1300} ≈ 36.06\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{40^2 + 900} = \sqrt{1600 + 900} = \sqrt{2500} = 50\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(30 - 40)^2 + (40 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{100 + 100} = \sqrt{200} ≈ 14.14\)

Total ≈ 36.06 + 50 + 14.14 ≈ 100.2

Wait, that's higher than at (40,50). Maybe the minimal is indeed at (40,50).

Alternatively, let's try \((10, 10)\):

First term: \(\sqrt{10^2 + 20^2} ≈ \sqrt{100 + 400} ≈ 22.36\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{10^2 + 30^2} ≈ \sqrt{100 + 900} ≈ 31.62\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(10 - 40)^2 + (10 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{900 + 1600} = \sqrt{2500} = 50\)

Total ≈ 22.36 + 31.62 + 50 ≈ 104

Still higher.

Wait, maybe I can try (40,50) and see if it's indeed the minimal.

But before that, let me check another point near (40,50). Let's take (40,50) plus a small epsilon, say (40,50 + 0.1), and see if the expression increases.

First term: \(\sqrt{40^2 + 20^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 400} = \sqrt{2000} ≈ 44.72\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{(50 + 0.1)^2 + 900} ≈ \sqrt{2500 + 10 + 1} ≈ \sqrt{2511} ≈ 50.11\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(40 - 40)^2 + (50.1 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 0.01} = 0.1\)

Total ≈ 44.72 + 50.11 + 0.1 ≈ 94.93

Wait, that's lower than 74.72? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait, at (40,50), the third term is \(\sqrt{0 + 0} = 0\), but at (40,50.1), the third term is \(\sqrt{0 + (0.1)^2} = 0.1\). So, the expression increases by 0.1, which is a small increase, but the first two terms decrease.

Wait, let me compute the change more precisely.

At (40,50):

First term: \(\sqrt{40^2 + 20^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 400} = \sqrt{2000} ≈ 44.721\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{50^2 + 30^2} = \sqrt{2500 + 900} = \sqrt{3400} ≈ 58.309\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{0 + 0} = 0\)

Total: ≈ 44.721 + 58.309 + 0 = 103.03

At (40,50.1):

First term: \(\sqrt{40^2 + 20^2} ≈ 44.721\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{50.1^2 + 30^2} ≈ \sqrt{(50 + 0.1)^2 + 900} = \sqrt{2500 + 10 + 0.01 + 900} = \sqrt{3410.01} ≈ 58.416\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(40 - 40)^2 + (50.1 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 0.01} = 0.1\)

Total ≈ 44.721 + 58.416 + 0.1 ≈ 103.237

Wait, so the expression increases from 103.03 to 103.237 when moving from (40,50) to (40,50.1). So, at least in that direction, the expression increases.

Similarly, moving in another direction, say (40.1,50):

First term: \(\sqrt{40.1^2 + 20^2} ≈ \sqrt{1608.01 + 400} ≈ \sqrt{2008.01} ≈ 44.826\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{50^2 + 30^2} ≈ 58.309\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(40.1 - 40)^2 + (50 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{0.01 + 0} = 0.1\)

Total ≈ 44.826 + 58.309 + 0.1 ≈ 103.235

Which is also higher than at (40,50). So, it seems that (40,50) is a local minimum.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can check another point.

Let me try (40,50 + 0.5):

First term: \(\sqrt{40^2 + 50.5^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 2550.25} = \sqrt{4150.25} ≈ 64.43\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{50.5^2 + 30^2} = \sqrt{2550.25 + 900} = \sqrt{3450.25} ≈ 58.73\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(40 - 40)^2 + (50.5 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 0.5^2} = 0.5\)

Total ≈ 64.43 + 58.73 + 0.5 ≈ 123.66

Which is higher than 103.03.

Wait, so maybe (40,50) is indeed the minimal point.

Wait, then at (40,50), the expression is approximately 103.03, which is lower than at other nearby points.

Therefore, perhaps the minimal value is achieved at (40,50), giving the expression value of approximately 103.03.

But let me compute it more accurately.

Compute each term at (40,50):

First term: \(\sqrt{40^2 + 20^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 400} = \sqrt{2000} = 100\sqrt{2} ≈ 141.421\)

Wait, wait, no! Wait, 40^2 is 1600, 20^2 is 400, so 1600 + 400 = 2000, sqrt(2000) = 44.72135955

Second term: \(\sqrt{50^2 + 30^2} = \sqrt{2500 + 900} = \sqrt{3400} = 10\sqrt{34} ≈ 58.3095\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(40 - 40)^2 + (50 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 0} = 0\)

Total expression: 44.72135955 + 58.3095 + 0 ≈ 103.03086

So, approximately 103.03.

Wait, but earlier I thought the first term was sqrt(40^2 + 20^2) which is 44.72, and the second term sqrt(50^2 + 30^2) which is 58.309, totaling 103.03.

But is this the minimal? Or is there a point where the expression is lower?

Wait, maybe I can try a point closer to (0,0), say (10,10):

First term: sqrt(10^2 + 20^2) = sqrt(100 + 400) = sqrt(500) ≈ 22.36

Second term: sqrt(10^2 + 30^2) = sqrt(100 + 900) = sqrt(1000) ≈ 31.62

Third term: sqrt((10 - 40)^2 + (10 - 50)^2) = sqrt{900 + 1600} = sqrt{2500} = 50

Total ≈ 22.36 + 31.62 + 50 ≈ 103.98

Which is higher than at (40,50). So, higher.

Wait, so (40,50) gives a lower value than nearby points.

Wait, maybe (40,50) is indeed the minimal point.

Wait, but let me compute the value at (40,50) precisely.

First term: sqrt(40^2 + 20^2) = sqrt(1600 + 400) = sqrt(2000) = 10*sqrt(20) ≈ 10*4.4721 ≈ 44.721

Second term: sqrt(50^2 + 30^2) = sqrt(2500 + 900) = sqrt(3400) = 10*sqrt(34) ≈ 10*5.8309 ≈ 58.309

Third term: sqrt(0 + 0) = 0

Total ≈ 44.721 + 58.309 + 0 = 103.03

Wait, so 103.03 is the value at (40,50).

Is this the minimal value?

Wait, perhaps I can test another point, like (0,50). Let's compute.

At (0,50):

First term: sqrt(0 + 20^2) = 20

Second term: sqrt(50^2 + 30^2) = sqrt(2500 + 900) = sqrt(3400) ≈ 58.309

Third term: sqrt((0 - 40)^2 + (50 - 50)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 0) = 40

Total: 20 + 58.309 + 40 ≈ 118.309

Which is higher than 103.03.

Wait, another point, say (40,50 + 1):

First term: sqrt(40^2 + 51^2) ≈ sqrt(1600 + 2601) ≈ sqrt(4201) ≈ 64.84

Second term: sqrt(51^2 + 30^2) ≈ sqrt(2601 + 900) ≈ sqrt(3501) ≈ 59.16

Third term: sqrt(0 + 1^2) = 1

Total ≈ 64.84 + 59.16 + 1 ≈ 125

Which is higher than 103.03.

Wait, another point, say (40, 50.5):

First term: sqrt(40^2 + 50.5^2) ≈ sqrt(1600 + 2550.25) ≈ sqrt(4150.25) ≈ 64.43

Second term: sqrt(50.5^2 + 30^2) ≈ sqrt(2550.25 + 900) ≈ sqrt(3450.25) ≈ 58.73

Third term: sqrt(0 + 0.5^2) = 0.5

Total ≈ 64.43 + 58.73 + 0.5 ≈ 123.66

Which is higher than 103.03.

So, it seems that (40,50) gives the minimal value, approximately 103.03.

But the problem asks for the minimal value. Since (40,50) is an integer point, maybe it's the exact minimal value.

Wait, let me compute it more precisely.

First term: \(\sqrt{40^2 + 20^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 400} = \sqrt{2000} = 10\sqrt{20}\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{50^2 + 30^2} = \sqrt{2500 + 900} = \sqrt{3400} = 10\sqrt{34}\)

Third term: 0

So, total expression is \(10\sqrt{20} + 10\sqrt{34}\).

But perhaps we can rationalize or represent it differently.

Wait, 10\sqrt{20} = 10 * 2\sqrt{5} = 20\sqrt{5}

10\sqrt{34} remains as is.

So, total expression is \(20\sqrt{5} + 10\sqrt{34}\).

But that's an exact value.

Wait, but earlier I thought that at (40,50), the third term is zero, but let me check that.

Wait, the third term is \(\sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}\), so at (40,50), it's \(\sqrt{0 + 0} = 0\). So, yes.

So, the minimal value is \(20\sqrt{5} + 10\sqrt{34}\).

Wait, let me compute this numerically.

20√5 ≈ 20 * 2.23607 ≈ 44.7214

10√34 ≈ 10 * 5.83095 ≈ 58.3095

Total ≈ 44.7214 + 58.3095 ≈ 103.0309

Which matches my earlier calculation.

But let me check if this is indeed the minimal value.

Wait, is there a point where the expression is lower?

Wait, suppose I move a little bit from (40,50). Let's try (40.1, 50):

First term: \(\sqrt{40.1^2 + 20^2} ≈ \sqrt{1608.01 + 400} ≈ \sqrt{2008.01} ≈ 44.825\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{50^2 + 30^2} ≈ 58.309\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(40.1 - 40)^2 + (50 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{0.01 + 0} = 0.1\)

Total ≈ 44.825 + 58.309 + 0.1 ≈ 103.234

Which is higher than 103.03.

Similarly, moving to (39.9,50):

First term: \(\sqrt{39.9^2 + 20^2} ≈ \sqrt{1592.01 + 400} ≈ \sqrt{1992.01} ≈ 44.64\)

Second term: 58.309

Third term: \(\sqrt{(39.9 - 40)^2 + (50 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{0.01 + 0} = 0.1\)

Total ≈ 44.64 + 58.309 + 0.1 ≈ 103.049

Which is slightly higher than 103.03.

So, moving in either direction from (40,50) increases the total expression.

Therefore, it seems that (40,50) is indeed the minimal point, giving the expression value of \(20\sqrt{5} + 10\sqrt{34}\).

Wait, but let me check if there's a point where the expression is lower by moving in different directions.

Wait, for example, moving along x-axis: Let me try (30,50):

First term: \(\sqrt{30^2 + 20^2} ≈ \sqrt{900 + 400} = \sqrt{1300} ≈ 36.055\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{50^2 + 30^2} ≈ 58.309\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(30 - 40)^2 + (50 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{100 + 0} = 10\)

Total ≈ 36.055 + 58.309 + 10 ≈ 104.364

Which is higher than 103.03.

Similarly, moving along y-axis: (40,40):

First term: \(\sqrt{40^2 + 20^2} ≈ 44.721\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{40^2 + 30^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 900} = \sqrt{2500} = 50\)

Third term: \(\sqrt{(40 - 40)^2 + (40 - 50)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 100} = 10\)

Total ≈ 44.721 + 50 + 10 ≈ 104.721

Which is higher than 103.03.

Therefore, it seems that moving in any direction from (40,50) increases the total expression, so (40,50) is the minimal point.

Thus, the minimal value of the expression is \(20\sqrt{5} + 10\sqrt{34}\).

But perhaps this can be written as \(10\sqrt{20} + 10\sqrt{34}\), which is \(10\sqrt{20} + 10\sqrt{34}\).

But let me check if this simplifies further.

Wait, 20√5 = 10 * 2√5, and 10√34 is as simple as it gets.

Therefore, the minimal value is \(10\sqrt{20} + 10\sqrt{34}\).

Alternatively, I can factor out 10:

\(10(\sqrt{20} + \sqrt{34})\)

But let me compute that as a single numerical value:

√20 ≈ 4.4721, √34 ≈ 5.8309

Sum ≈ 4.4721 + 5.8309 ≈ 10.303

Multiply by 10: ≈ 103.03, which matches our earlier calculation.

Therefore, the minimal value is \(10\sqrt{20} + 10\sqrt{34}\), which is approximately 103.03.

Wait, but before finalizing, let me check if there's another point where the expression is lower.

Wait, suppose I take a point along the line y = x + 10, which is the hypotenuse of the first two terms.

Wait, but perhaps it's too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use calculus again, but maybe I made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, let me try to think differently. Maybe I can perform a substitution.

Wait, let me let u = x, v = y - 50.

Then, the expression becomes:

sqrt(u^2 + 20^2) + sqrt((u - 40)^2 + 30^2) + sqrt(u^2 + v^2)

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the problem in terms of reflections. Let me think about reflecting the point (0,0) across the y-axis to get (-40,0), and reflect (0,50) across the y-axis to get (0,-50). Then, the problem might be transformed into finding a straight line path from (-40,0) to (0,-50) that reflects off the y-axis at (x,y).

Wait, perhaps that's a way to model the problem.

Wait, in optics, the shortest path that reflects off a surface can be found by reflecting the target across the surface and finding a straight line path.

In this case, reflecting the point (0,50) across the y-axis gives (0,-50). So, the path from (0,0) to (x,y) to (0,50) can be considered as a straight line from (0,0) to the reflection point (0,-50), passing through (x,y).

Wait, but that might not directly apply here, as there are three terms, not just two.

Alternatively, maybe I can reflect the point (0,50) across the line y = 50 + something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression as the sum of three distances and find the minimal path.

Wait, considering that each term is the distance from (0,0) to (x,y), from (x,y) to (40,50), and from (x,y) to (0,50), perhaps reflecting points can help.

Wait, perhaps I can reflect (0,50) across the y-axis to get (0,-50), then the path from (0,0) to (x,y) to (0,50) is equivalent to a straight line from (0,0) to (0,-50), passing through (x,y).

But then the total distance would be |(0,0) to (x,y)| + |(x,y) to (0,50)|.

But I also have the third term, |(x,y) to (0,50)|, so it's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a light ray that reflects off two mirrors.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the minimal value is indeed 20√5 + 10√34, as I found at (40,50), but let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says "Find the minimum value of the expression", so it's possible that the minimal value is 20√5 + 10√34, but perhaps there's a way to write it differently or find an exact expression.

Wait, let me compute 20√5 + 10√34.

Alternatively, factor out 10: 10(2√5 + √34). That seems as simplified as it gets.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rationalize it further, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as a decimal, but since the problem doesn't specify, I think an exact form is acceptable.

Therefore, the minimal value is \(10\sqrt{20} + 10\sqrt{34}\), which simplifies to \(20\sqrt{5} + 10\sqrt{34}\).

Wait, but wait, in the previous calculation, I had:

First term: \(\sqrt{40^2 + 20^2} = \sqrt{2000} = 10\sqrt{20}\)

Second term: \(\sqrt{50^2 + 30^2} = \sqrt{3400} = 10\sqrt{34}\)

Third term: 0

Therefore, total expression is \(10\sqrt{20} + 10\sqrt{34}\), which is \(10\sqrt{20} + 10\sqrt{34}\).

Wait, but 20√5 is equal to 10√20, since 20√5 = 10√(5*4) = 10*2√5 = 20√5.

Similarly, 10√34 is as is.

Therefore, the minimal value is \(20\sqrt{5} + 10\sqrt{34}\).

But to make sure, let me compute it numerically:

20√5 ≈ 20 * 2.23607 ≈ 44.7214

10√34 ≈ 10 * 5.83095 ≈ 58.3095

Total ≈ 44.7214 + 58.3095 ≈ 103.0309

Which matches our earlier calculation.

Therefore, the minimal value is \(20\sqrt{5} + 10\sqrt{34}\).

But let me see if this is the minimal value or if there's a point where it's lower.

Wait, perhaps moving along a different path, but I can't see a way to get a lower value. It seems that (40,50) gives the minimal value.

Alternatively, since I've found a point where the expression is 103.03, which is the minimal value, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of the expression is \(\boxed{20\sqrt{5} + 10\sqrt{34}}\).
</think>

To find the minimum value of the expression

\[
\sqrt{x^{2}+20^{2}} + \sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}} + \sqrt{(x-40)^{2}+(y-50)^{2}},
\]

we start by interpreting each term geometrically. Each term represents the distance between points in a plane. 

1. The term \(\sqrt{x^2 + 20^2}\) is the distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to the point \((x, 20)\).
2. The term \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) is the distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to the point \((x, y)\).
3. The term \(\sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2}\) is the distance from the point \((x, y)\) to the point \((40, 50)\).

We need to find the point \((x, y)\) that minimizes the sum of these distances. After considering various approaches and using calculus, we find that the point \((40, 50)\) minimizes the expression.

At the point \((40, 50)\):

1. The first term is \(\sqrt{40^2 + 20^2} = \sqrt{2000} = 10\sqrt{20}\).
2. The second term is \(\sqrt{40^2 + 50^2} = \sqrt{4100} = 10\sqrt{41}\).
3. The third term is \(\sqrt{(40 - 40)^2 + (50 - 50)^2} = 0\).

However, upon re-evaluating, we find that the third term is zero, and the second term is actually \(\sqrt{50^2 + 30^2} = \sqrt{3400} = 10\sqrt{34}\).

Thus, the total expression simplifies to:

\[
10\sqrt{20} + 10\sqrt{34} = 20\sqrt{5} + 10\sqrt{34}.
\]

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is

\[
\boxed{20\sqrt{5} + 10\sqrt{34}}.
\]
