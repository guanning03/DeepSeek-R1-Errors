Question:
Find the roots of $(x - 3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.$

Correct Answer:
Let $a = x - 3$ and $b = x - 7.$  Then we can write the given equation as
\[a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3.\]Expanding, we get $a^3 + b^3 = a^3 + 3a^2 b + 3ab^2 + b^3,$ so $3a^2 b + 3ab^2 = 0,$ which factors as
\[3ab(a + b) = 0.\]Thus, $a = 0,$ $b = 0,$ or $a + b = 0.$  Then $x - 3 = 0,$ $x - 7 = 0,$ or $2x - 10 = 0.$  This gives us the roots $\boxed{3, 5, 7}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this equation to solve: \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving cubes, sometimes it's helpful to expand everything and then simplify. Let me try expanding each term individually. Starting with the left side: \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3\).

The formula for expanding a cube is \((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\). So, applying that to both \((x - 3)^3\) and \((x - 7)^3\):

For \((x - 3)^3\):
\(x^3 - 3 \cdot 3x^2 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 3x \cdot 3^2 - 3^3\)
Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me actually compute it step by step.

\((x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 3 \cdot x^2 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot x \cdot 3^2 - 3^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\).

Similarly, \((x - 7)^3\):
\((x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 3 \cdot x^2 \cdot 7 + 3 \cdot x \cdot 7^2 - 7^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343\).

So when we add these together:
\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343)\).

Let me combine like terms:
- \(x^3 + x^3 = 2x^3\)
- \(-9x^2 -21x^2 = -30x^2\)
- \(27x + 147x = 174x\)
- \(-27 - 343 = -370\)

So the left side simplifies to \(2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370\).

Now, let's look at the right side: \((2x - 10)^3\). Again, using the expansion formula:

\((2x - 10)^3 = (2x)^3 - 3 \cdot (2x)^2 \cdot 10 + 3 \cdot (2x) \cdot 10^2 - 10^3\).

Calculating each term:
- \((2x)^3 = 8x^3\)
- \(3 \cdot (2x)^2 \cdot 10 = 3 \cdot 4x^2 \cdot 10 = 120x^2\)
- \(3 \cdot (2x) \cdot 10^2 = 3 \cdot 2x \cdot 100 = 600x\)
- \(10^3 = 1000\)

Putting it all together:
\((2x - 10)^3 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000\).

Alright, so now the equation is:
\(2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000\).

Hmm, let's bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero. Subtracting the right side from both sides:

\(2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 - 8x^3 + 120x^2 - 600x + 1000 = 0\).

Combine like terms:
- \(2x^3 - 8x^3 = -6x^3\)
- \(-30x^2 + 120x^2 = 90x^2\)
- \(174x - 600x = -426x\)
- \(-370 + 1000 = 630\)

So the equation simplifies to:
\(-6x^3 + 90x^2 - 426x + 630 = 0\).

Wait, that looks like a cubic equation. Maybe I can factor out a common factor to make it simpler. Let me see:

All coefficients are divisible by 6, I think. Let's check:

-6 ÷ 6 = -1
90 ÷ 6 = 15
-426 ÷ 6 = -71
630 ÷ 6 = 105

So, factoring out -6 (or 6, but negative), the equation becomes:
\(-6(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105) = 0\).

Since -6 is not zero, we can divide both sides by -6:
\(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0\).

Now, we have a cubic equation: \(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0\). I need to find its roots. I remember that for polynomials, the Rational Root Theorem can help find possible rational roots. It states that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction p/q, has p as a factor of the constant term and q as a factor of the leading coefficient.

In this case, the constant term is -105, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, possible rational roots are the factors of -105, which are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±15, ±21, ±35, ±105.

I can test these possible roots one by one.

Let me start with x=1:
\(1 - 15 + 71 - 105 = (1 - 15) + (71 - 105) = (-14) + (-34) = -48\) ≠ 0.

x=3:
\(27 - 135 + 213 - 105 = (27 - 135) + (213 - 105) = (-108) + (108) = 0\). Oh, x=3 is a root!

Okay, so (x - 3) is a factor of the cubic equation. Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.

Let's use synthetic division with root x=3.

Set up synthetic division:

3 | 1  -15   71   -105
        3  -36    105
      -----------------
        1  -12   35      0

So, the cubic factors into (x - 3)(x^2 - 12x + 35). Now, we can factor the quadratic:

x^2 - 12x + 35. Let me look for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add up to -12. Hmm, factors of 35 are 1 & 35, 5 & 7. Since the middle term is -12x, both numbers should be negative. So, -5 and -7 multiply to 35 and add to -12.

Therefore, the quadratic factors as (x - 5)(x - 7). So, putting it all together, the original equation factors to:

\((x - 3)(x - 5)(x - 7) = 0\).

Therefore, the roots are x = 3, x = 5, and x = 7.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me plug these back into the original equation to verify.

First, x = 3:
Left side: (3 - 3)^3 + (3 - 7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = 0 + (-64) = -64
Right side: (2*3 - 10)^3 = (6 - 10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64. So, -64 = -64. It works.

x = 5:
Left side: (5 - 3)^3 + (5 - 7)^3 = (2)^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 + (-8) = 0
Right side: (2*5 - 10)^3 = (10 - 10)^3 = 0^3 = 0. So, 0 = 0. It works.

x = 7:
Left side: (7 - 3)^3 + (7 - 7)^3 = (4)^3 + 0 = 64 + 0 = 64
Right side: (2*7 - 10)^3 = (14 - 10)^3 = (4)^3 = 64. So, 64 = 64. It works.

Looks like all three roots satisfy the equation. Therefore, the roots are 3, 5, and 7.

**Final Answer**
The roots are \boxed{3}, \boxed{5}, and \boxed{7}.
</think>

To find the roots of the equation \((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\), we start by expanding each term.

Expanding \((x - 3)^3\) and \((x - 7)^3\):
\[
(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27
\]
\[
(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343
\]

Adding these together:
\[
(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343)
\]
\[
= 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370
\]

Expanding the right side \((2x - 10)^3\):
\[
(2x - 10)^3 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000
\]

Subtracting the right side from the left side:
\[
2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 - (8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000) = 0
\]
\[
2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 - 8x^3 + 120x^2 - 600x + 1000 = 0
\]
\[
-6x^3 + 90x^2 - 426x + 630 = 0
\]

Factoring out \(-6\):
\[
-6(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105) = 0
\]

Factoring the cubic equation \(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0\) using the Rational Root Theorem, we find the roots \(x = 3\), \(x = 5\), and \(x = 7\).

Verifying each root in the original equation confirms they are correct.

The roots are \(\boxed{3}\), \(\boxed{5}\), and \(\boxed{7}\).
