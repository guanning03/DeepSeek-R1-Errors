Question:
How many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of $629_{10}$? For example, $121_{3}$ and $413_{5}$ would have one digit in common.

Correct Answer:
First, let us convert $629_{10}$ to each of the two bases. To convert to base 7, we realize $7^{4}>629_{10}>7^{3}$. So, we can tell that $629_{10}$ in base seven will have four digits. $7^{3}=343$, which can go into 629 only one time at most, leaving $629-1\cdot343 = 286$ for the next three digits. $7^{2}=49$ goes into 286 five times at most, leaving us with $286-5\cdot49 = 41$. Then, $7^{1}=7$ goes into 41 five times at most, leaving $41-5\cdot7 = 6$ for the ones digit. All together, the base seven equivalent of $629_{10}$ is $1556_{7}$.

To convert to base 8, we realize similarly that $8^{4}>629_{10}>8^{3}$. So, we can tell that $629_{10}$ in base eight will have four digits. $8^{3}=512$, which can go into 629 only one time at most, leaving $629-1\cdot512 = 117$ for the next three digits. $8^{2}=64$ goes into 117 one time at most, leaving us with $117-1\cdot64 = 53$. Then, $8^{1}=8$ goes into 53 six times at most, leaving $53-6\cdot8 = 5$ for the ones digit. All together, the base eight equivalent of $629_{10}$ is $1165_{8}$.

Finally, comparing $1556_{7}$ and $1165_{8}$, we find that digits 1, 5, and 6 are present in both numbers.  Thus, there are $\boxed{3}$ digits in common.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find out how many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the number 629 in base 10. The example given is 121 in base 3 and 413 in base 5, which have one digit in common. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First off, I think I need to convert 629 from base 10 to both base 7 and base 8. Once I have those two representations, I can compare them digit by digit and count how many digits are the same. That should give me the answer.

Starting with base 7. I remember that to convert a decimal number to another base, I can use the division method. So, I'll divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders. Let me try that.

629 divided by 7. Well, 7 times 90 is 630, which is just one more than 629. So, 7 times 89 is 623. That means 629 divided by 7 is 89 with a remainder of 6. So, the least significant digit (rightmost) in base 7 is 6.

Now, take 89 and divide by 7. 7 times 12 is 84, so 89 divided by 7 is 12 with a remainder of 5. So, the next digit is 5.

Then, take 12 and divide by 7. 7 goes into 12 once, with a remainder of 5. So, the next digit is 5.

Now, take 1 and divide by 7. 7 goes into 1 zero times, so the remainder is 1. That's the last digit.

So, reading the remainders from last to first, the base 7 representation of 629 is 1 5 5 6. Let me write that as 1556 base 7.

Wait, let me verify that. 1*7^3 is 343, 5*7^2 is 245, 5*7^1 is 35, and 6*7^0 is 6. Adding them up: 343 + 245 is 588, plus 35 is 623, plus 6 is 629. Perfect, that checks out.

Now, moving on to base 8. I'll do the same process. Let's divide 629 by 8.

629 divided by 8. 8 times 70 is 560, which leaves a remainder of 69. 8 times 8 is 64, so 8 times 8 is 64, which leaves a remainder of 5. So, the next digit is 5.

Then, take 8 and divide by 8. That's 1 with a remainder of 0. So, the next digit is 0.

Now, take 1 and divide by 8. That's 0 with a remainder of 1. So, the last digit is 1.

So, writing the remainders from last to first, the base 8 representation is 1 0 5. Let me write that as 105 base 8.

Wait, let me double-check that. 1*8^2 is 64, 0*8^1 is 0, and 5*8^0 is 5. So, 64 + 0 + 5 is 69. Wait, that's not 629. Hmm, did I make a mistake in my conversion?

Oh, no, I think I messed up the remainders. Let me go through the base 8 conversion again.

Starting with 629 divided by 8: 629 ÷ 8 is 78 with a remainder of 5. So, the first digit is 5.

Next, take 78 and divide by 8: 78 ÷ 8 is 9 with a remainder of 6. So, next digit is 6.

Then, take 9 and divide by 8: 9 ÷ 8 is 1 with a remainder of 1. So, next digit is 1.

Finally, take 1 and divide by 8: 1 ÷ 8 is 0 with a remainder of 1. So, last digit is 1.

Wait, so it should be 1 1 6 5? But that doesn't make sense because 1*8^3 is 512, 1*8^2 is 64, 6*8 is 48, and 5 is 5. So, 512 + 64 is 576, plus 48 is 624, plus 5 is 629. Wait, that actually adds up correctly. So, is the base 8 representation 1165?

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 105. That was my mistake. Let me correct that.

So, the base 8 conversion:

629 ÷ 8 = 78, remainder 5.

78 ÷ 8 = 9, remainder 6.

9 ÷ 8 = 1, remainder 1.

1 ÷ 8 = 0, remainder 1.

So, reading the remainders from last to first: 1, 1, 6, 5. So, it's 1165 base 8.

Wait, but hold on, that seems like a lot of digits. 1165 base 8 would be 1*8^3 + 1*8^2 + 6*8 + 5. That's 512 + 64 + 48 + 5 = 629. Correct. So, 1165 base 8.

Okay, so the base 8 representation is 1165.

Wait, so in base 7, we had 1556, and in base 8, we have 1165. So, let's write both:

Base 7: 1 5 5 6

Base 8: 1 1 6 5

Now, comparing digit by digit:

First digit: 1 vs 1. That's a match.

Second digit: 5 vs 1. Not a match.

Third digit: 5 vs 6. Not a match.

Fourth digit: 6 vs 5. Not a match.

So, only the first digit is the same. Therefore, the number of same digits is 1.

Wait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Wait, in base 7, 629 is 1556. Let me verify that again.

1*7^3 = 343

5*7^2 = 5*49 = 245

5*7^1 = 5*7 = 35

6*7^0 = 6

Adding those up: 343 + 245 = 588, 588 + 35 = 623, 623 + 6 = 629. Correct.

In base 8, 1165. Let's verify:

1*8^3 = 512

1*8^2 = 64

6*8 = 48

5*1 = 5

512 + 64 = 576, 576 + 48 = 624, 624 + 5 = 629. Correct.

So, both representations are correct.

So, comparing:

Base 7: 1 5 5 6

Base 8: 1 1 6 5

Comparing each digit:

1 vs 1: same.

5 vs 1: different.

5 vs 6: different.

6 vs 5: different.

So, only the first digit is the same. Therefore, the number of same digits is 1.

Wait, but the example given was 121 in base 3 and 413 in base 5, which had one digit in common. So, in that case, both representations have three digits, and only one digit is the same.

In our problem, both representations have four digits. Only the first digit is same, so the answer is 1.

But, just to make sure, let me check if maybe I made a mistake in the base conversions.

Wait, in base 7, 629 is 1556. Let me see if 1*343 + 5*49 + 5*7 + 6 is 629.

343 + 245 is 588, 588 + 35 is 623, 623 + 6 is 629. Correct.

In base 8, 1*512 + 1*64 + 6*8 + 5 is 512 + 64 is 576, 576 + 48 is 624, 624 +5 is 629. Correct.

So, that's correct. So, both representations are accurate.

Therefore, the digits in base 7: 1,5,5,6

Digits in base 8:1,1,6,5

Comparing each digit:

1 vs 1: same

5 vs 1: different

5 vs 6: different

6 vs 5: different

Only 1 digit is the same. Therefore, the answer is 1.

Wait, but hold on, let me think again about the base 8 conversion. When I did 629 ÷ 8, I got 78 and remainder 5, so 5. Then, 78 ÷8 is 9 with remainder 6, so 6. Then, 9 ÷8 is 1 with remainder 1, so 1. Then, 1 ÷8 is 0 with remainder 1, so 1. So, the base 8 digits are 1 1 6 5, right?

Wait, but 1165 in base 8 is 1*8^3 +1*8^2 +6*8 +5.

So, 512 +64 +48 +5 is 629. Correct.

So, both representations are correct.

Thus, my conclusion is that only the first digit is the same, so the number of same digits is 1.

Wait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe I can convert both numbers to decimal and see how they look, but perhaps another way.

Alternatively, I can think about the number of digits in each base. 629 in base 7 is four digits, and in base 8 is also four digits. So, each has the same number of digits, which is four.

Now, the question is how many digits are common between the two representations.

In base 7, 629 is 1556.

In base 8, 629 is 1165.

Comparing the digits:

First digit: 1 vs 1: same.

Second digit: 5 vs 1: different.

Third digit:5 vs6: different.

Fourth digit:6 vs5: different.

So, only the first digit is the same. So, the number of same digits is 1.

Therefore, the answer is 1.

But just to check, is there a chance that I made a mistake in the base conversions? Let me verify once again.

Base 7:

629 ÷7=89 r6

89 ÷7=12 r5

12 ÷7=1 r5

1 ÷7=0 r1

So, base 7 is 1 5 5 6, which is correct.

Base 8:

629 ÷8=78 r5

78 ÷8=9 r6

9 ÷8=1 r1

1 ÷8=0 r1

So, base 8 is 1 1 6 5, which is correct.

So, both representations are correct.

Therefore, the number of same digits is 1.

I think that's solid.

**Final Answer**
The number of same digits is \boxed{1}.
</think>

To determine how many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases and compare the digits.

First, we convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7:
1. Divide 629 by 7: \(629 \div 7 = 89\) with a remainder of 6.
2. Divide 89 by 7: \(89 \div 7 = 12\) with a remainder of 5.
3. Divide 12 by 7: \(12 \div 7 = 1\) with a remainder of 5.
4. Divide 1 by 7: \(1 \div 7 = 0\) with a remainder of 1.

Reading the remainders from last to first, the base 7 representation is \(1556_7\).

Next, we convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8:
1. Divide 629 by 8: \(629 \div 8 = 78\) with a remainder of 5.
2. Divide 78 by 8: \(78 \div 8 = 9\) with a remainder of 6.
3. Divide 9 by 8: \(9 \div 8 = 1\) with a remainder of 1.
4. Divide 1 by 8: \(1 \div 8 = 0\) with a remainder of 1.

Reading the remainders from last to first, the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\).

Comparing the digits of \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\):
- Base 7: 1, 5, 5, 6
- Base 8: 1, 1, 6, 5

The only common digit is the first digit, which is 1.

Thus, the number of same digits is \(\boxed{1}\).
