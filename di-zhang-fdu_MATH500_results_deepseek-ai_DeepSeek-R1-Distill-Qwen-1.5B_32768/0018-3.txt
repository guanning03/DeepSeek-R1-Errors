Question:
Given that \begin{align*}x_{1}&=211,\\ x_{2}&=375,\\ x_{3}&=420,\\ x_{4}&=523,\ \text{and}\\ x_{n}&=x_{n-1}-x_{n-2}+x_{n-3}-x_{n-4}\ \text{when}\ n\geq5, \end{align*}find the value of $x_{531}+x_{753}+x_{975}$.

Correct Answer:
Shifting the recurrence over by one and adding, we have: \[\begin{aligned} x_n &= x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \\ x_{n-1} &= x_{n-2} - x_{n-3} + x_{n-4} - x_{n-5} \\ \implies x_n + x_{n-1} &= x_{n-1} - x_{n-5} \end{aligned}\]so $x_n = -x_{n-5}$ for all $n.$ In particular, $x_n = -x_{n-5} = -(-x_{n-10}) = x_{n-10},$ so the sequence repeats with period $10.$ Thus, \[\begin{aligned} x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} &= x_1 + x_3 + x_5 \\ &= x_1 + x_3 + (x_4-x_3+x_2-x_1) \\ &= x_2 + x_4 \\ &= 375 + 523 = \boxed{898}. \end{aligned}\]

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem here where I'm given a sequence of numbers, and then there's a recurrence relation for each term starting from the fifth term onwards. The task is to find the value of \( x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} \). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me write down the given information:

- \( x_1 = 211 \)
- \( x_2 = 375 \)
- \( x_3 = 420 \)
- \( x_4 = 523 \)
- For \( n \geq 5 \), \( x_n = x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \)

So, each term from the fifth term onward is defined by this alternating sum of the previous four terms. Interesting. I need to figure out what \( x_{531} \), \( x_{753} \), and \( x_{975} \) are, and then add them together. But calculating each term up to 975 seems impractical. There must be some pattern or periodicity in this sequence that I can exploit.

Let me start by computing the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges. Maybe the sequence becomes periodic or repeats after some point.

Starting with the given terms:

- \( x_1 = 211 \)
- \( x_2 = 375 \)
- \( x_3 = 420 \)
- \( x_4 = 523 \)

Now, let's compute \( x_5 \):

\( x_5 = x_4 - x_3 + x_2 - x_1 \)

Plugging in the numbers:

\( x_5 = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211 \)

Let me compute step by step:

- \( 523 - 420 = 103 \)
- \( 103 + 375 = 478 \)
- \( 478 - 211 = 267 \)

So, \( x_5 = 267 \)

Now, \( x_6 \):

\( x_6 = x_5 - x_4 + x_3 - x_2 \)

Substituting the known values:

\( x_6 = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375 \)

Calculating step by step:

- \( 267 - 523 = -256 \)
- \( -256 + 420 = 164 \)
- \( 164 - 375 = -211 \)

So, \( x_6 = -211 \)

Next, \( x_7 \):

\( x_7 = x_6 - x_5 + x_4 - x_3 \)

Substituting:

\( x_7 = (-211) - 267 + 523 - 420 \)

Calculating:

- \( -211 - 267 = -478 \)
- \( -478 + 523 = 45 \)
- \( 45 - 420 = -375 \)

So, \( x_7 = -375 \)

Now, \( x_8 \):

\( x_8 = x_7 - x_6 + x_5 - x_4 \)

Substituting:

\( x_8 = (-375) - (-211) + 267 - 523 \)

Simplify:

- \( -375 + 211 = -164 \)
- \( -164 + 267 = 103 \)
- \( 103 - 523 = -420 \)

So, \( x_8 = -420 \)

Moving on to \( x_9 \):

\( x_9 = x_8 - x_7 + x_6 - x_5 \)

Substituting:

\( x_9 = (-420) - (-375) + (-211) - 267 \)

Calculating:

- \( -420 + 375 = -45 \)
- \( -45 - 211 = -256 \)
- \( -256 - 267 = -523 \)

Thus, \( x_9 = -523 \)

Next, \( x_{10} \):

\( x_{10} = x_9 - x_8 + x_7 - x_6 \)

Substituting:

\( x_{10} = (-523) - (-420) + (-375) - (-211) \)

Simplify:

- \( -523 + 420 = -103 \)
- \( -103 - 375 = -478 \)
- \( -478 + 211 = -267 \)

So, \( x_{10} = -267 \)

Hmm, interesting. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. Let's list out the terms we have so far:

- \( x_1 = 211 \)
- \( x_2 = 375 \)
- \( x_3 = 420 \)
- \( x_4 = 523 \)
- \( x_5 = 267 \)
- \( x_6 = -211 \)
- \( x_7 = -375 \)
- \( x_8 = -420 \)
- \( x_9 = -523 \)
- \( x_{10} = -267 \)

Wait a minute, looking at these numbers, it seems like starting from \( x_5 \), the sequence is alternating between positive and negative terms with magnitudes similar to earlier terms but in reverse order.

For example:

- \( x_5 = 267 \) which is the negative of \( x_6 = -211 \)
- \( x_6 = -211 \) which is the negative of \( x_7 = -375 \)
- \( x_7 = -375 \) which is the negative of \( x_8 = -420 \)
- \( x_8 = -420 \) which is the negative of \( x_9 = -523 \)
- \( x_9 = -523 \) which is the negative of \( x_{10} = -267 \)
- \( x_{10} = -267 \) which is the negative of \( x_5 = 267 \)

So, this suggests that starting from \( x_5 \), the terms are alternating between positive and negative, with each subsequent term being the negative of the term before it. Wait, that seems too simplistic. Let me check:

Looking at \( x_5 = 267 \), which is the negative of \( x_6 = -211 \).

\( x_6 = -211 \), which is the negative of \( x_7 = -375 \).

So, \( x_6 = -x_7 \). Similarly, \( x_7 = -x_8 \), \( x_8 = -x_9 \), \( x_9 = -x_{10} \), and \( x_{10} = -x_5 \).

So, in general, this seems to be a periodic sequence with period 5 or something?

Wait, let me check the indices:

\( x_5 = 267 = -x_6 = -(-211) \)
\( x_6 = -211 = -x_7 = -(-375) \)
\( x_7 = -375 = -x_8 = -(-420) \)
\( x_8 = -420 = -x_9 = -(-523) \)
\( x_9 = -523 = -x_{10} = -(-267) \)
\( x_{10} = -267 = -x_5 \)

So, each term starting from \( x_5 \) is the negative of the term 5 places before it. So, \( x_{n} = -x_{n-5} \) for \( n \geq 5 \).

That's an important observation. So, the recurrence relation is \( x_n = -x_{n-5} \) for \( n \geq 5 \).

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify.

From the given recurrence:

\( x_n = x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \)

But we just saw that in the terms, starting from \( x_5 \), \( x_n = -x_{n-5} \).

Wait, so if \( x_n = -x_{n-5} \), then perhaps the recurrence is satisfied?

Let me check for \( n = 5 \):

\( x_5 = x_4 - x_3 + x_2 - x_1 = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211 = 267 \)

According to \( x_n = -x_{n-5} \), \( x_5 = -x_0 \). But we don't have \( x_0 \). Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the recurrence \( x_n = x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \) isn't directly leading to \( x_n = -x_{n-5} \), but maybe the sequence has some periodicity or cycles.

Alternatively, perhaps the recurrence can be rewritten or simplified.

Let me try to compute a few more terms to see if a pattern emerges.

So, from \( x_5 = 267 \), let's compute \( x_5 \) to \( x_{10} \), then \( x_{11} \) onwards.

Wait, I just computed \( x_{10} = -267 \). Let's compute \( x_{11} \):

\( x_{11} = x_{10} - x_9 + x_8 - x_7 \)

Substituting:

\( x_{11} = (-267) - (-523) + (-420) - (-375) \)

Calculating:

- \( -267 + 523 = 256 \)
- \( 256 - 420 = -164 \)
- \( -164 + 375 = 211 \)

So, \( x_{11} = 211 \)

Wait, that's interesting. \( x_{11} = 211 \), which is equal to \( x_1 = 211 \). Let me check \( x_{12} \):

\( x_{12} = x_{11} - x_{10} + x_9 - x_8 \)

Substituting:

\( x_{12} = 211 - (-267) + (-523) - (-420) \)

Simplify:

- \( 211 + 267 = 478 \)
- \( 478 - 523 = -45 \)
- \( -45 + 420 = 375 \)

So, \( x_{12} = 375 \), which is equal to \( x_2 = 375 \).

Continuing, \( x_{13} \):

\( x_{13} = x_{12} - x_{11} + x_{10} - x_9 \)

Substituting:

\( x_{13} = 375 - 211 + (-267) - (-523) \)

Calculating:

- \( 375 - 211 = 164 \)
- \( 164 - 267 = -103 \)
- \( -103 + 523 = 420 \)

Thus, \( x_{13} = 420 \), which is \( x_3 = 420 \).

Next, \( x_{14} \):

\( x_{14} = x_{13} - x_{12} + x_{11} - x_{10} \)

Substituting:

\( x_{14} = 420 - 375 + 211 - (-267) \)

Simplify:

- \( 420 - 375 = 45 \)
- \( 45 + 211 = 256 \)
- \( 256 + 267 = 523 \)

So, \( x_{14} = 523 \), which is \( x_4 = 523 \).

Continuing, \( x_{15} \):

\( x_{15} = x_{14} - x_{13} + x_{12} - x_{11} \)

Substituting:

\( x_{15} = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211 \)

Calculating:

- \( 523 - 420 = 103 \)
- \( 103 + 375 = 478 \)
- \( 478 - 211 = 267 \)

So, \( x_{15} = 267 \), which is \( x_5 = 267 \).

Wait, so now I see a pattern. Starting from \( x_5 \), the terms are repeating every 5 terms:

\( x_5 = 267 \)

\( x_6 = -211 \)

\( x_7 = -375 \)

\( x_8 = -420 \)

\( x_9 = -523 \)

\( x_{10} = -267 \)

\( x_{11} = 211 \)

\( x_{12} = 375 \)

\( x_{13} = 420 \)

\( x_{14} = 523 \)

\( x_{15} = 267 \)

And so on. So, it seems that every 5 terms, the sequence repeats. Therefore, the period is 5, and the sequence is cyclic with period 5.

Wait, but hold on, from \( x_5 \) to \( x_{10} \), the terms are \( 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267 \), and then \( x_{11} \) is back to 211, which is \( x_5 \). So, the cycle is indeed 5 terms: 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, and then repeats.

Therefore, the sequence is periodic with period 5 starting from \( x_5 \). So, \( x_{n} = x_{n+5} \) for \( n \geq 5 \).

So, if the sequence is periodic with period 5 starting from \( x_5 \), then all terms can be determined by their position modulo 5.

Let me verify this by computing a couple more terms.

We have:

- \( x_{11} = 211 = x_5 \)
- \( x_{12} = 375 = x_6 \)
- \( x_{13} = 420 = x_7 \)
- \( x_{14} = 523 = x_8 \)
- \( x_{15} = 267 = x_9 \)
- \( x_{16} = x_{15} - x_{14} + x_{13} - x_{12} \)

Substituting:

\( x_{16} = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375 \)

Calculating:

- \( 267 - 523 = -256 \)
- \( -256 + 420 = 164 \)
- \( 164 - 375 = -211 \)

So, \( x_{16} = -211 \), which is equal to \( x_6 \). That matches the periodicity.

Similarly, \( x_{17} = x_{16} - x_{15} + x_{14} - x_{13} \)

Substituting:

\( x_{17} = (-211) - 267 + 523 - 420 \)

Calculating:

- \( -211 - 267 = -478 \)
- \( -478 + 523 = 45 \)
- \( 45 - 420 = -375 \)

So, \( x_{17} = -375 \), which is \( x_7 \).

Therefore, the periodicity seems solid. So, we can conclude that starting from \( x_5 \), the sequence repeats every 5 terms. Therefore, the period is 5, and the terms cycle through 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, and then repeats.

So, to find \( x_{531} \), \( x_{753} \), and \( x_{975} \), we need to find their positions modulo 5, since the sequence repeats every 5 terms starting from \( x_5 \).

Let me define the position \( k \) as \( x_k \). For \( k \geq 5 \), \( x_k = x_{k-5} \). Therefore, to find \( x_k \), we can write \( k = 5 + m \), where \( m = k - 5 \), and then \( x_k = x_{m} \). So, if we can express \( k \) as \( 5 + m \), then \( m \) can be reduced modulo 5 to find the equivalent position in the first cycle.

Therefore, let me compute \( 531 \), \( 753 \), and \( 975 \) modulo 5.

First, let's compute \( 531 \mod 5 \):

Divide 531 by 5:

5 * 106 = 530, so 531 - 530 = 1. Therefore, \( 531 \mod 5 = 1 \).

So, \( x_{531} = x_1 \). But wait, hold on. Let me make sure.

Wait, according to our earlier mapping, starting from \( x_5 \), the sequence repeats every 5 terms. So, for \( k \geq 5 \), \( x_k = x_{k - 5 \times \lfloor (k - 5)/5 \rfloor} \). So, the position is \( k \mod 5 \), but starting from 1.

Wait, actually, we need to adjust our indexing. Let me clarify.

If the sequence is periodic with period 5 starting from \( x_5 \), then each term \( x_k \) for \( k \geq 5 \) is equal to \( x_{k - 5 \times m} \) for some integer \( m \), such that \( k - 5 \times m \) is in the first cycle (i.e., between 1 and 5).

Therefore, to find \( x_k \) for \( k \geq 5 \), we can compute \( k \mod 5 \) to find the position within the cycle, then map that to the corresponding term.

But let's check with our earlier terms.

For \( x_5 \), \( 5 \mod 5 = 0 \), but our terms are 1-indexed, so maybe we need to adjust.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that \( x_5 \) corresponds to the first term in the cycle (position 1), \( x_6 \) corresponds to position 2, and so on.

So, to map \( x_k \) for \( k \geq 5 \) to the cycle, we can compute \( (k - 5) \mod 5 \), and then add 1 to get the position in the cycle.

Wait, let's test it.

For \( k = 5 \):

\( (5 - 5) \mod 5 = 0 \), add 1: position 1. Correct, \( x_5 = 267 \).

For \( k = 6 \):

\( (6 - 5) \mod 5 = 1 \), add 1: position 2. Correct, \( x_6 = -211 \).

For \( k = 10 \):

\( (10 - 5) \mod 5 = 0 \), add 1: position 1. Correct, \( x_{10} = -267 \).

For \( k = 11 \):

\( (11 - 5) \mod 5 = 1 \), add 1: position 2. Correct, \( x_{11} = 211 \).

Similarly, \( k = 15 \):

\( (15 - 5) \mod 5 = 0 \), add 1: position 1. Correct, \( x_{15} = 267 \).

So, the formula is:

For \( k \geq 5 \):

\( \text{position} = ((k - 5) \mod 5) + 1 \)

Therefore, to find \( x_k \), we can compute the position in the cycle and then take the corresponding value from the initial cycle.

So, let's apply this formula to \( 531 \), \( 753 \), and \( 975 \).

First, \( k = 531 \):

Compute \( (531 - 5) \mod 5 \):

\( 531 - 5 = 526 \)

\( 526 \mod 5 \):

Divide 526 by 5: 5 * 105 = 525, so 526 - 525 = 1. Therefore, \( 526 \mod 5 = 1 \)

Then, position = 1 + 1 = 2.

So, \( x_{531} = x_2 = 375 \)

Wait, hold on, the initial cycle is:

\( x_1 = 211 \)

\( x_2 = 375 \)

\( x_3 = 420 \)

\( x_4 = 523 \)

\( x_5 = 267 \)

So, position 1 is 211, position 2 is 375, etc.

Therefore, position 2 is 375. So, yes, \( x_{531} = 375 \).

Next, \( k = 753 \):

Compute \( (753 - 5) \mod 5 \):

\( 753 - 5 = 748 \)

\( 748 \mod 5 \):

Divide 748 by 5: 5 * 149 = 745, so 748 - 745 = 3. Therefore, \( 748 \mod 5 = 3 \)

Position = 3 + 1 = 4.

So, \( x_{753} = x_4 = 523 \)

Wait, position 4 is 523, yes.

Next, \( k = 975 \):

Compute \( (975 - 5) \mod 5 \):

\( 975 - 5 = 970 \)

\( 970 \mod 5 \):

Divide 970 by 5: 5 * 194 = 970, so 970 - 970 = 0. Therefore, \( 970 \mod 5 = 0 \)

Position = 0 + 1 = 1.

So, \( x_{975} = x_1 = 211 \)

Wait, position 1 is 211, correct.

Therefore, summarizing:

- \( x_{531} = 375 \)
- \( x_{753} = 523 \)
- \( x_{975} = 211 \)

Therefore, \( x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = 375 + 523 + 211 \)

Let me compute that:

375 + 523 = 898

898 + 211 = 1109

So, the sum is 1109.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

First, \( x_{531} \):

531 mod 5 = 1 (since 5*106=530, 531-530=1)

So, position 1: 211. But according to our formula, position was ((531 -5) mod 5) +1 = (526 mod 5) +1=1+1=2. Wait, hold on, that contradicts.

Wait a second, maybe my formula was incorrect.

Wait, let's re-examine.

Earlier, I thought that \( x_5 \) corresponds to position 1, so \( k = 5 \) gives position 1.

Similarly, \( k = 6 \) gives position 2, etc.

Therefore, to get the position in the cycle, we can compute \( (k - 5) \mod 5 \), and then add 1.

Wait, let's test with \( k = 5 \):

\( (5 -5) mod5 = 0, 0 +1=1 \). Correct, position 1.

\( k = 6 \):

\( (6 -5) mod5=1, 1 +1=2 \). Correct.

\( k =10 \):

\( (10 -5) mod5=0, 0 +1=1 \). Correct, \( x_{10} = -267 \).

\( k =11 \):

\( (11 -5) mod5=1, 1 +1=2 \). Correct, \( x_{11}=211 \).

Therefore, formula is:

position = ((k -5) mod5) +1.

Therefore, for \( k=531 \):

(531 -5)=526 mod5=1, position=1+1=2. So, \( x_{531}=x_2=375 \). Correct.

For \( k=753 \):

753 -5=748 mod5=3, position=3+1=4. So, \( x_{753}=x_4=523 \). Correct.

For \( k=975 \):

975 -5=970 mod5=0, position=0+1=1. So, \( x_{975}=x_1=211 \). Correct.

Therefore, the previous calculation is correct. So, the sum is 375 + 523 + 211 = 1109.

But wait a second, let me verify once more.

Alternatively, perhaps my mapping is wrong.

Wait, let's think about the cycle starting at \( x_5 \).

So, from \( x_5 \) to \( x_{10} \), the terms are 267, -211, -375, -420, -523.

Then, \( x_{11} \) is 211, which is \( x_5 \), so the cycle repeats every 5 terms.

Therefore, the cycle is:

Position: 1 2 3 4 5

Term:    211 375 420 523 267

So, each term in the cycle corresponds to positions 1 through 5.

Therefore, given any \( k \geq 1 \), we can find its position in the cycle by:

\( \text{position} = (k -1) \mod 5 +1 \)

So, for \( k=1 \): (0 mod5)+1=1

\( k=2 \):1 mod5 +1=2

...

\( k=5 \):4 mod5 +1=5

\( k=6 \):5 mod5 +1=0 +1=1

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the formula is:

\( \text{position} = ((k -1) \mod 5) +1 \)

So, for \( k=5 \):

(5 -1)=4 mod5=4, +1=5

For \( k=6 \):

(6 -1)=5 mod5=0, +1=1

But in our earlier mapping, \( x_5 \) is position1, \( x_6 \) is position2, ..., \( x_{10} \) is position5, \( x_{11} \) is position1, etc.

So, to compute the position, it's \( ((k -1) \mod5) +1 \). Let me test:

For \( k=5 \):

(5 -1)=4 mod5=4, +1=5. So, position5: 267. Correct.

For \( k=6 \):

(6 -1)=5 mod5=0, +1=1. Position1: 211. Correct.

For \( k=10 \):

(10 -1)=9 mod5=4, +1=5. Position5: 267. Correct.

For \( k=11 \):

(11 -1)=10 mod5=0, +1=1. Position1:211. Correct.

So, the formula is:

position = ((k -1) mod5) +1

Therefore, for any \( k \geq1 \), position is ((k -1) mod5)+1.

Therefore, for \( k=531 \):

position = ((531 -1) mod5) +1 = (530 mod5) +1

530 divided by5 is 106, remainder 0. So, 0 +1=1. So, position1:211. Correct.

For \( k=753 \):

position = ((753 -1) mod5) +1 = (752 mod5) +1

752 divided by5: 5*150=750, remainder2. So, 2 +1=3. Position3:420. Wait, but earlier, I thought \( x_{753} =523 \). Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, hold on. There's a discrepancy here. Earlier, I thought that \( x_{753} \) is \( x_4 =523 \), but according to this formula, it's \( x_3=420 \). That can't be.

Wait, no, wait, the formula is:

position = ((k -1) mod5) +1

So, for \( k=753 \):

(753 -1)=752, 752 mod5=2, +1=3. So, position3:420.

But earlier, I thought that \( x_{753}=x_4=523 \). Hmm, which is conflicting.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, from our earlier computation, \( x_{11}=211 =x_5 \), which is position1.

Similarly, \( x_{12}=375 =x_6 \), position2.

\( x_{13}=420 =x_7 \), position3.

\( x_{14}=523 =x_8 \), position4.

\( x_{15}=267 =x_9 \), position5.

\( x_{16}= -211 =x_{10} \), position1.

So, the mapping is:

k:1→1

k:2→2

k:3→3

k:4→4

k:5→5

k:6→1

k:7→2

k:8→3

k:9→4

k:10→5

k:11→1

k:12→2

k:13→3

k:14→4

k:15→5

Etc.

So, at position3: \( x_3=420 \), position4: \( x_4=523 \), position5: \( x_5=267 \), position1:211, position2:375, etc.

So, for \( k=753 \):

position = ((753 -1) mod5) +1 = (752 mod5)+1=2+1=3

So, position3:420. Therefore, \( x_{753}=420 \), not 523.

Wait, so earlier, I had a mistake in my initial calculation.

Wait, where did I go wrong? Let me re-examine.

Earlier, I thought that \( x_{10}= -267 \), so \( x_{11}=x_5=211 \), but according to the formula, \( x_{11}=x_2=375 \). Wait, this is conflicting.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I messed up the indexing.

Wait, if the cycle starts at \( x_5 \), which is position1, and \( x_5=267 \), \( x_6=-211 \), \( x_7=-375 \), \( x_8=-420 \), \( x_9=-523 \), \( x_{10}=-267 \), then \( x_{11}=x_5=267 \), but according to the formula, \( x_{11}=x_{((11-1)mod5)+1}=x_{(10mod5)+1}=x_{0 +1}=x_1=211 \). But this contradicts with the actual calculation where \( x_{11}=211 \).

Wait, so which is correct? Let me compute \( x_{11} \) using the original recurrence.

From the original recurrence, \( x_{11}=x_{10} -x_9 +x_8 -x_7 \)

Substituting:

\( x_{10}=-267 \), \( x_9=-523 \), \( x_8=-420 \), \( x_7=-375 \)

Therefore:

\( x_{11}= (-267) - (-523) + (-420) - (-375) \)

Calculating:

- \( -267 + 523 = 256 \)
- \( 256 - 420 = -164 \)
- \( -164 + 375 = 211 \)

So, \( x_{11}=211 \), which is \( x_5 \), not \( x_1 \). Therefore, my earlier formula was wrong.

So, my mistake was in the formula. The correct formula is not ((k -1) mod5)+1, but rather, since the cycle starts at \( x_5 \), the position is \( (k -5) mod5 \), but that doesn't align with the previous results.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

Given that the cycle starts at \( x_5 \), and has period5, then for \( k \geq5 \), \( x_k = x_{(k -5) mod5} \).

But wait, let's test this:

For \( k=5 \):

\( (5 -5) mod5=0, so x_0 \). But x_0 is undefined.

Alternatively, starting from \( x_5 \), the cycle is 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, then repeats.

So, for \( k \geq5 \), the position is \( (k -5) mod5 \). If the result is 0, it corresponds to the fifth term.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of zero-based indexing.

Let me try to index the cycle starting from 0:

Cycle: 0:267, 1:-211, 2:-375, 3:-420, 4:-523

Then, for \( k \geq5 \), \( x_k = cycle[(k -5) mod5] \)

Therefore, for \( k=5 \):

\( (5 -5)=0 mod5=0 → x_0=267 \). Correct.

\( k=6 \):

\( (6 -5)=1 mod5=1 →x_1=-211 \). Correct.

\( k=10 \):

\( (10 -5)=5 mod5=0 →x_0=267 \). Correct.

\( k=11 \):

\( (11 -5)=6 mod5=1 →x_1=-211 \). But according to the actual calculation, \( x_{11}=211 \). Hmm, conflict.

Wait, that can't be. There's a problem here.

Alternatively, perhaps the cycle is 5 terms, so:

Cycle: 1:267, 2:-211, 3:-375, 4:-420, 5:-523

Then, for \( k \geq1 \), \( x_k = cycle[(k -1) mod5] \)

So:

\( k=1 \): cycle[0] undefined.

Wait, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to map \( k \) to the cycle index as follows:

For \( k \geq5 \), the term \( x_k \) is equal to \( x_{k-5} \). So, the cycle is 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, 267, etc.

Therefore, for \( k \geq5 \), \( x_k = x_{k-5} \)

So, for \( k=5 \):267

\( k=6 \):-211

\( k=7 \):-375

\( k=8 \):-420

\( k=9 \):-523

\( k=10 \):-267

\( k=11 \):211 (since \( x_{11}=x_{6}=-211 \) but wait, no, \( x_{11}=x_{10 -5}=x_5=267 \). Wait, no, that doesn't align.

Wait, perhaps the formula is \( x_k = x_{k-5} \) for \( k \geq5 \). So, \( x_{11}=x_6=-211 \), but that's not correct because earlier calculation showed \( x_{11}=211 \).

Wait, no, maybe I need to consider that the cycle is 5 terms, but the first term is \( x_5=267 \), which is position1.

Therefore, for \( k \geq5 \), \( x_k = cycle[ ((k -5) mod5) +1 ] \)

So, for \( k=5 \): ((5 -5) mod5)+1=0 +1=1 →267

\( k=6 \):1 +1=2→-211

\( k=10 \):5 +1=6 mod5=1→267

Wait, that seems correct.

\( k=11 \): (11 -5)=6 mod5=1→267. But earlier, \( x_{11}=211 \). Contradiction.

Wait, so something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to forget the formula and instead simply note that the terms from \( x_5 \) onwards repeat every 5 terms.

So, starting from \( x_5=267 \), \( x_6=-211 \), \( x_7=-375 \), \( x_8=-420 \), \( x_9=-523 \), and then \( x_{10}=-267 \), \( x_{11}=211 \), \( x_{12}=-375 \), \( x_{13}=-420 \), \( x_{14}=-523 \), \( x_{15}=-211 \), and so on.

Wait, but in reality, after \( x_{10}=-267 \), the next term is \( x_{11}=211 \), which is different from the cycle I thought.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption about the cycle was wrong.

Wait, let's compute \( x_{11} \) again.

\( x_{11}=x_{10} -x_9 +x_8 -x_7 \)

Given \( x_{10}=-267 \), \( x_9=-523 \), \( x_8=-420 \), \( x_7=-375 \)

So:

\( x_{11}= -267 - (-523) + (-420) - (-375) \)

Simplify:

- \( -267 +523 =256 \)
- \( 256 -420 =-164 \)
- \( -164 +375=211 \)

So, \( x_{11}=211 \)

But according to our earlier sequence, \( x_{10}=-267 \), \( x_{11}=211 \), \( x_{12}= -375 \), \( x_{13}=-420 \), \( x_{14}=-523 \), \( x_{15}=-211 \), etc.

Wait, so there's a shift in the cycle.

Wait, if we look at the terms from \( x_5 \) onward:

\( x_5=267 \)

\( x_6=-211 \)

\( x_7=-375 \)

\( x_8=-420 \)

\( x_9=-523 \)

\( x_{10}=-267 \)

\( x_{11}=211 \)

\( x_{12}=-375 \)

\( x_{13}=-420 \)

\( x_{14}=-523 \)

\( x_{15}=-211 \)

\( x_{16}=267 \)

\( x_{17}= -211 \)

Wait, so starting from \( x_5=267 \), it cycles through: 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, -375, -420, -523, -211, 267, -211, etc.

So, the cycle is:

1:267

2:-211

3:-375

4:-420

5:-523

6:-267

7:211

8:-375

9:-420

10:-523

11:-211

12:267

13:-211

14:-375

15:-420

16:-523

17:-267

18:211

19:-375

20:-420

21:-523

22:-211

23:267

24:-211

25:-375

...

So, the cycle length is 10, but that contradicts the initial thought that it repeats every 5 terms.

Wait, but from \( x_5 \) onward, the terms are:

267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, -375, -420, -523, -211, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, -375, -420, -523, -211, 267, -211, 267, -211, etc.

Wait, so actually, starting from \( x_5 \):

267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, -375, -420, -523, -211, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, -375, -420, -523, -211, 267, -211, etc.

So, the cycle is 10 terms? Wait, the sequence from \( x_5 \) onward is:

267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, -375, -420, -523, -211, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, -375, -420, -523, -211, 267, -211, etc.

So, after \( x_{10}=-523 \), we have \( x_{11}=211 \), then \( x_{12}=-375 \), which is \( x_3 \). So, the cycle is 10 terms, starting from \( x_5 \).

Wait, then the cycle is:

1:267

2:-211

3:-375

4:-420

5:-523

6:-267

7:211

8:-375

9:-420

10:-523

11:211

12:-375

13:-420

14:-523

15:-267

16:211

17:-375

18:-420

19:-523

20:-267

21:211

22:-375

23:-420

24:-523

25:-267

26:211

27:-375

... and so on.

Therefore, the cycle is 10 terms. So, starting from \( x_5 \), every 10 terms, the sequence repeats.

Therefore, the period is 10.

Wait, then perhaps my initial assumption that it's 5 terms was wrong. It's actually 10 terms.

But then, the recurrence relation is of order 4, so the period can't be 10 unless the characteristic equation has roots that repeat every 10 terms.

Hmm, maybe I should instead consider the recurrence:

\( x_n = x_{n-1} -x_{n-2} +x_{n-3} -x_{n-4} \)

This is a linear recurrence with constant coefficients.

To find the period, we can find the roots of the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation is:

\( r^4 - r^3 + r^2 - r +1=0 \)

So, let's compute the roots.

First, factor the polynomial.

Looking for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem: possible roots are ±1.

Test r=1: 1 -1 +1 -1 +1=1≠0

Test r=-1:1 +1 +1 +1 +1=5≠0

So, no rational roots. Therefore, the roots are either complex or irrational.

Alternatively, perhaps factor by grouping.

Let me group terms:

\( (r^4 - r^3) + (r^2 - r) +1=0 \)

Factor:

\( r^3(r -1) + r(r -1) +1=0 \)

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps notice that the polynomial is palindromic? Let me check:

A palindromic polynomial satisfies \( a_i = a_{n-i} \). Here, coefficients are 1, -1, 1, -1, 1. So, yes, it's palindromic.

Therefore, for palindromic polynomials, if \( r \) is a root, then \( 1/r \) is also a root.

Therefore, the roots come in reciprocal pairs.

So, for the quartic equation, the roots satisfy \( r \) and \( 1/r \).

Therefore, it might have two pairs of reciprocal roots.

But still, to find the period, we need to know the nature of the roots.

Alternatively, maybe the roots are on the unit circle, which would explain periodicity.

If all roots lie on the unit circle, then the sequence would be periodic.

But without computing, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence has period 10, as per our earlier observation.

But given that the recurrence is of order4, the period can't be more than 10.

Wait, but in our manual computation, starting from \( x_5 \), we have a sequence that after 10 terms repeats.

Wait, but let me confirm.

From \( x_5 \) onward:

267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, -375, -420, -523, -211, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, -375, -420, -523, -211, 267, -211, 267, -211,...

So, looking at this, after 10 terms:

267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, -375, -420, -523, then next term is -211, which is \( x_{11} \). So, the cycle is 10 terms.

Wait, but \( x_{11}=-211 \), which is \( x_6=-211 \). Wait, is that right?

Wait, no, \( x_6=-211 \), \( x_{11}=-211 \), \( x_{16}=-211 \), etc. So, \( x_6=-211 \), \( x_{16}=-211 \), etc.

So, the cycle is 10 terms, starting from \( x_5 \). So, positions 1 to10 correspond to \( x_5 \) to \( x_{14} \), then \( x_{15} \) to \( x_{24} \), etc.

Therefore, the period is 10.

Therefore, \( x_n = x_{n+10} \) for all \( n \geq5 \).

Therefore, for any \( n \geq5 \), \( x_n = x_{n+10} \).

Therefore, to compute \( x_{531} \), \( x_{753} \), \( x_{975} \), we can find their positions modulo10.

Because the period is10.

So, for \( x_{531} \):

Compute \( 531 -5 =526 \). Now, 526 mod10=6. So, \( x_{531}=x_{5+6}=x_6=-211 \).

For \( x_{753} \):

753 -5=748. 748 mod10=8. So, \( x_{753}=x_{5+8}=x_8=-420 \).

For \( x_{975} \):

975 -5=970. 970 mod10=0. So, \( x_{975}=x_{5+0}=x_5=267 \).

Therefore, \( x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}= (-211) + (-420) + 267= (-631) +267= -364 \).

Wait, that seems different from my initial calculation.

Wait, but according to the period of10, these positions map to \( x_6=-211 \), \( x_8=-420 \), \( x_5=267 \). So, adding them up: -211 -420 +267.

Compute: -211 -420 = -631. Then, -631 +267= -364.

So, the total is -364.

But wait, in our earlier analysis, I thought the period was5, but upon further consideration, it's10. So, that's the correction.

So, in that case, the answer is -364.

But wait, let me confirm.

Wait, according to the period of10, the terms from \( x_5 \) onwards repeat every10 terms.

Therefore, \( x_{531}=x_{6}=-211 \)

\( x_{753}=x_{8}=-420 \)

\( x_{975}=x_{5}=267 \)

Sum: -211 -420 +267= (-211 -420) +267= (-631) +267= -364.

So, the answer is -364.

Therefore, I need to correct my earlier mistake by recognizing that the period is actually10, not5.

But wait, how did I get10? From the calculation of \( x_{11}=-211 \), which is \( x_6=-211 \). So, the period is10.

Therefore, the correct answer is -364.

But now, I need to verify this.

Alternatively, perhaps the period is5.

Wait, let me test the terms further.

From \( x_5 \) to \( x_{14} \):

267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, -375, -420, -523, -211, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, -375, -420, -523, -211, 267, -211,...

So, the cycle is:

267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, -375, -420, -523, -211, 267, -211, -375, -420, -523, -267, 211, -375, -420, -523, -211, 267, -211,...

So, from \( x_5 \) onward, every10 terms, it repeats.

Therefore, the period is indeed10.

Therefore, the earlier mistake was thinking the period was5, but in reality, the period is10.

Therefore, \( x_{531}=x_{6}=-211 \), \( x_{753}=x_{8}=-420 \), \( x_{975}=x_{5}=267 \).

Sum: -211 -420 +267= -631 +267= -364.

Therefore, the final answer is -364.

But to make sure, let me compute \( x_{531} \) as \( x_{5 + 526} \).

526 divided by10 is52.6, so the remainder is6.

Thus, \( x_{531}=x_{5+6}=x_6=-211 \).

Similarly, \( x_{753}=x_{5+748}=x_{5+8}=x_8=-420 \).

\( x_{975}=x_{5+970}=x_{5+0}=x_5=267 \).

So, all correct.

Therefore, \( x_{531} +x_{753} +x_{975}= (-211) + (-420) +267= -631 +267= -364 \).

Therefore, the answer is -364.

Wait, but the problem statement says \( x_{1}=211 \), \( x_{2}=375 \), \( x_{3}=420 \), \( x_{4}=523 \).

Wait, according to the recurrence relation, \( x_{5}=x_{4} -x_{3} +x_{2} -x_{1}=523 -420 +375 -211=267 \). Correct.

\( x_{6}=x_{5} -x_{4} +x_{3} -x_{2}=267 -523 +420 -375= -266 +420 -375=154 -375= -221 \). Wait, wait, hold on.

Wait, no, earlier, I thought \( x_6=-211 \). But according to the recurrence:

\( x_6 = x_5 -x_4 +x_3 -x_2 \)

Which is 267 -523 +420 -375.

Compute:

267 -523= -256

-256 +420=164

164 -375= -211.

Wait, so \( x_6= -211 \). So, my earlier computation was correct.

Wait, so \( x_6=-211 \). So, 526 mod10=6, so \( x_{531}=x_6=-211 \).

Therefore, correct.

Similarly, \( x_{753}=x_{8}=-420 \), which comes from:

\( x_7 =x_6 -x_5 +x_4 -x_3= (-211) -267 +523 -420= (-478) +523 -420=45 -420= -375 \). So, \( x_7=-375 \). Then, \( x_8 =x_7 -x_6 +x_5 -x_4= (-375) -(-211) +267 -523= (-375 +211) + (267 -523)= (-164) + (-256)= -420 \). So, \( x_8=-420 \). Therefore, correct.

Similarly, \( x_{975}=x_{5}=267 \), because 975 -5=970, 970 mod10=0, so \( x_{975}=x_5=267 \). Correct.

Therefore, the sum is indeed -211 -420 +267= -364.

Therefore, the answer is -364.

But wait, I just noticed that in the cycle, \( x_{10}= -523 \), \( x_{11}=-211 \), which is \( x_6 \), and \( x_{12}=-375 \), which is \( x_7 \), etc. So, the cycle is starting at \( x_5 \), and the period is10.

Thus, the initial approach was wrong because I thought the period was5, but it's actually10.

Therefore, the correct answer is -364.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-364}
</think>

Given the sequence \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{1023} \) where \( x_1 = 211 \), \( x_2 = 375 \), \( x_3 = 420 \), \( x_4 = 523 \), and the recurrence relation for \( n \geq 5 \):

\[ x_n = x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \]

We need to find the value of \( x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} \).

First, we compute the initial terms of the sequence to identify any patterns. We find that the sequence starts repeating every 10 terms from \( x_5 \) onwards. This periodicity helps us determine the values of \( x_{531} \), \( x_{753} \), and \( x_{975} \).

To find the positions of these terms within the cycle:
- For \( x_{531} \): \( 531 - 5 = 526 \), \( 526 \mod 10 = 6 \). Thus, \( x_{531} = x_6 = -211 \).
- For \( x_{753} \): \( 753 - 5 = 748 \), \( 748 \mod 10 = 8 \). Thus, \( x_{753} = x_8 = -420 \).
- For \( x_{975} \): \( 975 - 5 = 970 \), \( 970 \mod 10 = 0 \). Thus, \( x_{975} = x_5 = 267 \).

Adding these values together:

\[ x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = -211 + (-420) + 267 = -631 + 267 = -364 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{-364}
\]
