Question:
In how many ways can 8 people be seated around a square table with 2 people on a side?  (Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.)

Correct Answer:
There are $8!$ ways to place the people around the table, but this counts each valid arrangement 4 times (if you move each person 2, 4, or 6 places clockwise you get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\dfrac{8!}{4} = \boxed{10080}$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem: I need to figure out how many ways 8 people can be seated around a square table with 2 people on each side. And it's important to note that two configurations are considered the same if one is a rotation of another. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First off, seating around a square table. I know that for circular tables, the number of seating arrangements is usually (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. But this is a square table, so it's a bit different. I think the first thing I need to do is figure out how many rotational symmetries a square has. A square has 4 sides, so it should have 4 rotational symmetries: 0째, 90째, 180째, and 270째. So, does that mean I need to divide the total number of arrangements by 4 to account for these rotations?

Wait, but actually, in circular permutations, we often fix one person's position to account for rotations. Maybe a similar approach can work here. If I fix one person's seat, then the rest can be arranged in different ways, but since it's a square, fixing one person might help eliminate rotational duplicates.

Let me see. If I fix one person's seat, then the table can be rotated, but since we're fixing one person, we can't rotate anymore. So now, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways? But hold on, is that the case? Because each side has 2 people, so each side is a pair.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

In a circular table, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)!. But in this case, it's a square, so the symmetry group is different. The dihedral group D4, which has 8 elements: 4 rotations and 4 reflections. But in our problem, do we consider reflections as different configurations? The question says configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another, but it doesn't mention reflections. So maybe reflections are considered distinct.

Hmm, so if that's the case, then perhaps I don't need to divide by 8. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check. If we have a square table, rotating it 90 degrees would make it the same configuration, but reflecting it would create a different one. So, if reflections are considered different, then the number of symmetries is 8, otherwise, it's 4.

Hmm, the problem statement just says "rotations," not reflections, so maybe reflections are considered different. So, perhaps, the dihedral group applies here with 8 symmetries. So, if that's the case, maybe the number of distinct arrangements is (8-1)! divided by 8? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, actually, the formula for circular arrangements is (n-1)! when considering rotational symmetry. But for square tables with rotational symmetry, the formula is (n-1)! divided by something. But in this case, since we're dealing with a square, which has 4-fold rotational symmetry, so each unique arrangement is counted 4 times in (n-1)! because of the rotations.

So, to adjust for rotations, we would divide by 4. So, for 8 people, that would be (8-1)! / 4 = 7! / 4. But wait, 7! is 5040, so 5040 / 4 is 1260. Is that the answer? Hmm, but hold on, the problem is about seating around a square table with 2 people on each side. So, each side has 2 seats, which are adjacent.

Does that affect the calculation? Because if each side has 2 seats, then the arrangement is similar to a circular table but with 4 sides, each with 2 seats.

Wait, another thought: maybe I can model the square table as a cycle with 8 positions, but grouped into 4 groups of 2, each group forming a side. So, perhaps it's a circular arrangement with 8 seats, but with the constraint that each side has exactly 2 people.

So, how do we count the number of arrangements in such a case?

I remember that when arranging people around a table with specific groupings, you can use the formula for circular permutations with indistinct groups. But in this case, the groups are distinguishable because each side is a different side of the table.

Wait, but in a square table, the sides are fixed, right? So, if we have 8 seats, each side has 2 seats, and each side is distinguishable because they are on different sides of the table. So, the sides are fixed, meaning that the groupings are fixed as well. So, in that case, maybe it's similar to arranging people around a circular table where each side is a pair, but the sides are different.

But how does that affect the number of arrangements?

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a circular arrangement where each side is a pair. So, each side has 2 seats, and each pair is on a different side.

So, maybe the number of ways is similar to arranging 8 people around a circular table with 4 pairs, each pair on a different side.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about fixing the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can break down the problem into two steps: first, arrange the people around the square, considering the rotational symmetry, and then consider the reflections.

Wait, I think I need to recall Burnside's lemma, which is used for counting distinct arrangements accounting for group actions, like rotations and reflections.

But since the problem only mentions rotations, not reflections, maybe I can use the formula for circular permutations divided by the number of rotations.

But let me verify.

In a circular table, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! / n if considering both rotations and reflections as the same. But in our case, if only rotations are considered equivalent, then we need to divide by n, which is 4.

So, for 8 people, it would be (8-1)! / 4 = 7! / 4 = 5040 / 4 = 1260.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think again.

Wait, when we fix one person's seat to account for rotational symmetry, then the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways. But since the table is square, which has 4-fold rotational symmetry, each unique arrangement is counted 4 times in the total number of arrangements.

Therefore, to get the number of distinct arrangements, we divide by 4.

So, yes, 7! / 4 is 1260.

But hold on, the problem is about seating 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side.

Wait a second, is this a circular table or a square table? It's a square table, so the sides are fixed.

Wait, another approach: fix one person's seat to eliminate rotational symmetry, and then arrange the remaining 7 people. But since each side has 2 seats, which are adjacent, the problem is a bit different.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as arranging people in a circle where each side has exactly 2 people. So, the table is divided into 4 sides, each with 2 seats, and we need to arrange 8 people in these seats.

Wait, so in this case, how does it differ from a circular table?

In a circular table, all seats are equivalent, but here, each side is a specific side of the square, so fixing a position on one side would fix the position of the other sides.

Wait, perhaps this is a more complex problem. Maybe it's better to think of the square table as having 4 sides, each with 2 seats. So, it's similar to arranging people in a 4x2 grid, but the sides are fixed.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as two separate circular tables.

Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, I can think of the square table as a circle with 8 positions, but with the constraint that each pair of adjacent positions (forming a side) must have exactly 2 people.

Wait, that might not be the case. Each side has 2 seats, but the rest of the seats can have any number of people.

Wait, hold on, actually, each side has 2 seats, but the total number of seats is 8, so each side has exactly 2 seats, and each seat is part of exactly one side.

Therefore, it's similar to arranging 8 people around a circular table, but with 4 sides, each side having exactly 2 seats. So, each side is a pair of adjacent seats.

So, in that case, the number of distinct arrangements is equal to the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table divided into 4 sides, each with 2 seats.

Wait, so in this case, each arrangement is a circular permutation with 4 sides, each side having exactly 2 people. So, how do we count the number of such arrangements?

I think this is a problem that can be approached using the concept of circular permutations with fixed groupings.

I recall that for circular arrangements with fixed groupings, the formula is (n-1)! divided by the size of the group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, actually, in the case where we have a circular table with n seats, and we fix k seats together, the number of arrangements is (n-1)! / (k)!.

Wait, no, that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as arranging 8 people in a circle, but with 4 specific pairs of seats (each pair forming a side of the square). So, the number of ways to do that is equal to the number of ways to partition the 8 people into 4 pairs, and then arrange each pair around a side.

But wait, each side has 2 seats, which can be considered as a pair.

So, if we think of the square table as having 4 sides, each side has 2 seats, and we need to arrange 8 people in these 8 seats.

So, the number of ways would be:

First, partition the 8 people into 4 groups of 2, and then arrange each group around a side.

But the number of ways to partition 8 people into 4 groups of 2 is equal to (8)! / (2!^4 * 4!). Then, for each group, we can arrange the 2 people in 2! ways, so multiply by (2!)^4.

But wait, but in a circular arrangement, the number of ways to arrange each group is (number of seats on the side -1)!.

Wait, no, because each side is a fixed side of the square, so arranging each pair on the side is a linear arrangement, but since the side is a circle (it's a straight side, but the two seats are adjacent in the circular table). Wait, no, each side is a straight line of two seats in the circular table.

Wait, but the side is part of the circular table, so the two seats on each side are adjacent, but also symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the key is that each side is a pair of seats, which are adjacent in the circular arrangement.

So, in that case, arranging the people around the sides is similar to arranging them in a circle, but with 4 specific pairs.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me try a different approach.

If I fix one person's seat to account for rotational symmetry, then the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways.

But since the table is square, which has 4-fold symmetry, each unique arrangement is counted 4 times in 7!.

Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 7! / 4 = 5040 / 4 = 1260.

But wait, does this apply here?

Wait, in a circular table, you fix one person and arrange the others, which gives (n-1)! arrangements. But in a square table, each arrangement is counted 4 times because of the rotations.

So, yes, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! / 4.

So, 7! / 4 = 5040 / 4 = 1260.

But let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with symmetries, especially dihedral groups, the number can be different.

Wait, the dihedral group D4 has 8 elements: 4 rotations and 4 reflections. So, if we consider both rotations and reflections as equivalent, then the number of distinct arrangements would be (n-1)! / 8.

But the problem statement only mentions rotations, not reflections, so maybe we don't need to divide by 8.

Wait, so in our case, is the square table considered with both rotations and reflections as equivalent? The problem says two configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another. It doesn't mention reflections, so I think reflections are considered different.

Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements would be (n-1)! / 4, which is 7! / 4 = 1260.

But wait, let me think about it another way. Suppose we fix one person's position, say person A, then the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways. However, since the table is square, rotating the entire arrangement by 90 degrees would make it equivalent. So, each unique arrangement is counted 4 times in 7!.

Therefore, to get the number of distinct arrangements, we divide by 4, so 7! / 4 = 1260.

Alternatively, if I don't fix a person's position, but instead consider the total number of circular permutations, which is (n-1)! = 7! = 5040, and then divide by 4 because of the square's rotational symmetry, giving 1260.

So, it seems like 1260 is the answer.

But wait, another thought: when arranging people around a square table with 2 people on each side, each side is a pair of adjacent seats, but the entire table is a circle, so the two seats on each side are adjacent in the circular arrangement.

Wait, but in that case, the problem is similar to arranging 8 people in a circle, but with 4 specific pairs of seats (each pair is a side of the square) that must be occupied together.

So, how do we count the number of ways to arrange 8 people in a circle, with 4 specific pairs, each pair occupying two adjacent seats.

Wait, in that case, the number of ways is equal to the number of ways to partition the 8 people into 4 pairs, and then arrange each pair around a side.

So, the number of ways to partition 8 people into 4 pairs is (8)! / (2!^4 * 4!) = 105.

Then, for each pair, we can arrange them in 2! ways, so 2!^4 = 16.

Therefore, the total number is 105 * 16 = 1680.

But hold on, this is without considering the rotational symmetry. So, in a circular arrangement, we need to divide by the number of rotations, which is 8, but in our case, since each side is a specific pair, the number of rotations would be 4, because rotating by 90 degrees would map each pair to the next pair.

Wait, maybe I need to think of the number of distinct arrangements as (number of ways to partition into pairs) / number of rotations.

Wait, no, perhaps the rotational symmetry is already accounted for in the partitioning.

Wait, actually, in circular arrangements, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! when considering rotations, but if we have fixed pairs, then we don't divide by n anymore, because the pairs are fixed in their positions.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

If we fix the pairs as given, then the number of ways is (number of ways to arrange the pairs around the table) multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the people within each pair.

But in our case, each pair is fixed, so the number of ways is just the number of ways to arrange the pairs around the table.

But since the table is square, which has 4-fold rotational symmetry, the number of distinct arrangements is (number of ways to arrange the pairs) divided by 4.

Wait, so how many ways are there to arrange 4 fixed pairs around a square table? It's (4-1)! = 6, because it's a circular arrangement with 4 pairs.

But wait, 4 pairs would be arranged in a circle, so the number of distinct arrangements is (4-1)! = 6.

But then, within each pair, the two people can be arranged in 2! ways, so 2!^4 = 16.

Therefore, total number of arrangements is 6 * 16 = 96.

Wait, but that seems too low because 96 is much less than 1260.

Wait, I'm confused now.

Alternatively, maybe if the pairs are fixed, the number of arrangements is (number of ways to arrange the pairs around the table) multiplied by the number of ways to arrange within each pair.

So, the number of ways to arrange 4 pairs around a square table is (4-1)! = 6, since it's a circular arrangement, and each pair can be arranged in 2! ways internally. So, total number is 6 * (2!)^4 = 6 * 16 = 96.

But that's if the pairs are fixed in their positions, but in our case, the pairs are fixed as sides of the square.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the pairs are fixed as sides of the square, so the pairs are fixed in their positions, so arranging them around the table is not a rotational symmetry anymore? Wait, no, because the square can be rotated, so the same pairs can be arranged in different rotational positions.

Wait, I think I need to clarify.

If the pairs are fixed in their positions, then the number of distinct arrangements would be (number of rotational symmetries) times the number of linear arrangements.

Wait, no, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the key is that each side is a pair of seats, and the square can be rotated, so the number of distinct arrangements is (number of ways to arrange the pairs) divided by the number of rotations.

But if the pairs are fixed as sides, then the number of rotations would be the number of ways you can rotate the pairs to get equivalent arrangements.

Wait, but each rotation would just shift the pairs around the table.

Wait, maybe the number of distinct arrangements is (number of ways to arrange the pairs) divided by the number of rotations.

But if the pairs are fixed, then the number of rotations is 4, so 96 / 4 = 24.

But that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the square table as a fixed arrangement with specific sides, so the pairs are fixed in their positions, so the number of arrangements is (number of ways to arrange the people in the 8 seats) divided by the number of rotations.

But since the pairs are fixed, each rotation would just permute the pairs.

So, if we fix the pairs, the number of rotational symmetries is equal to the number of pairs, which is 4.

Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is (number of linear arrangements of people in the 8 seats) divided by 4.

But the number of linear arrangements is 8! = 40320, but wait, that's not right because the pairs are fixed.

Wait, no, if the pairs are fixed, meaning that each side is a specific pair, then the number of linear arrangements is 8! because each seat is unique.

But since the table is square, rotating the whole table would just shift the pairs around.

So, each rotation would make the same arrangement.

Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 8! / 4 = 40320 / 4 = 10080.

But that seems too high because it's considering all possible rotations, but in our problem, we only have 4 rotational symmetries.

Wait, no, actually, no, when you fix the pairs, the number of distinct arrangements is 8! / 4 = 10080, but that seems incorrect because 8! is 40320, which is the number of linear arrangements, but I don't think that's right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again.

Wait, maybe I should go back to the initial approach.

If I fix one person's seat, then the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways, but since the table is square, each unique arrangement is counted 4 times in 7!.

Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 7! / 4 = 5040 / 4 = 1260.

So, 1260 is the answer.

But wait, to verify, let's think of a simpler case. Suppose we have a square table with 2 people on each side, so 8 seats total.

If we fix one person, say Alice, then the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways.

But since the table is square, each unique arrangement is counted 4 times, so dividing by 4 gives 7! / 4 = 1260.

Alternatively, if we don't fix a person, the total number of circular arrangements is (8-1)! = 5040, but since the table has 4-fold symmetry, each unique arrangement is counted 4 times, so the number of distinct arrangements is 5040 / 4 = 1260.

Therefore, both approaches give the same answer.

So, I think 1260 is the correct answer.

But just to make sure, let me think of another way.

Suppose I fix one person, Alice, at a specific seat. Then, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways. However, since the table is square, Alice could be rotated into any of the 4 seats, but since we fixed her seat, we don't have to worry about that.

Wait, no, fixing Alice's seat accounts for the rotational symmetry.

So, the number of distinct arrangements is 7! = 5040, but since the table is circular, we divide by 4, so 5040 / 4 = 1260.

Alternatively, if we didn't fix Alice's seat, the total number of arrangements would be (8-1)! = 5040, but since each arrangement is counted 4 times, we divide by 4 to get 1260.

Therefore, both methods give 1260.

Alternatively, another way is to model this as arranging 8 people around a square table with 2 people per side.

Each side has 2 seats, which are adjacent.

So, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around the table is equal to the number of ways to arrange them in a circle, divided by 4 because of the square's rotational symmetry.

So, (8-1)! / 4 = 5040 / 4 = 1260.

Yes, that makes sense.

Therefore, after thinking through different approaches and verifying, I believe the answer is 1260.

**Final Answer**
The number of distinct seating arrangements is \boxed{1260}.
</think>

To determine the number of ways 8 people can be seated around a square table with 2 people on each side, considering rotational symmetry, we need to account for the square's rotational symmetries. 

1. **Fixing a Position**: We can fix one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry. This leaves us with arranging the remaining 7 people.
2. **Circular Arrangements**: The number of ways to arrange 7 people in a circle is given by \((7-1)!\), but since we are considering rotational symmetry, we need to divide by the number of rotational symmetries.
3. **Dividing by Rotational Symmetry**: The square table has 4 rotational symmetries (0째, 90째, 180째, and 270째), so we divide by 4.

Thus, the number of distinct seating arrangements is calculated as:
\[
\frac{(8-1)!}{4} = \frac{7!}{4} = \frac{5040}{4} = 1260
\]

Therefore, the number of distinct seating arrangements is \(\boxed{1260}\).
