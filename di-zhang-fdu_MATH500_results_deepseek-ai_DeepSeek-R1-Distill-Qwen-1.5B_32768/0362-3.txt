Question:
What is the total surface area, in square inches, of a cube with a volume of $1$ cubic foot?

Correct Answer:
Recall that  $$1 \mbox{ foot} = 12 \mbox{ inches}$$

Hence $$1 \mbox{ foot}^2 = 12^2 \mbox{ inches}^2 = 144 \mbox{ inches}^2$$

Finally, remember the formula $V = l \times w \times h$, that is, Volume is the product of length, width, and height.

The length, height, and width for a cube are equal, so the cube we are given has sides of length $1 \mbox{ feet}$. Now, a cube has 6 faces, so the surface area of our cube is $$6 \times (1 \mbox{ foot} \times 1 \mbox{ foot}) = 6 \mbox{ feet}^2$$

Now, convert: $$ 6 \mbox{ feet}^2 \frac{144 \mbox{ inches}^2}{1 \mbox{ foot}^2} = 864 \mbox{ inches}^2$$

So, our final answer is $\boxed{864 \mbox{ inches}^2}$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem: find the total surface area of a cube that has a volume of 1 cubic foot. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that a cube has all sides equal, so maybe I can find the length of one side first and then use that to figure out the surface area.

First, let me recall the formula for the volume of a cube. I think it's side length cubed, right? So, Volume = side^3. Yeah, that sounds right. The problem says the volume is 1 cubic foot, so if I let s be the length of one side of the cube, then s^3 = 1 cubic foot. To find s, I just need to take the cube root of both sides. 

Calculating that, the cube root of 1 is 1, so s = 1 foot. Wait, is that right? Because 1 foot is a pretty long side for a cube, but mathematically, it makes sense. Let me double-check: if each side is 1 foot, then the volume is indeed 1*1*1 = 1 cubic foot. Okay, that checks out.

Now, I need to find the total surface area of the cube. I remember that a cube has 6 faces, each of which is a square. The area of one face is side length squared, so the area of one face is s^2. Therefore, the total surface area would be 6 times that, so 6*s^2.

Plugging in the value of s, which is 1 foot, into the formula, the surface area would be 6*(1)^2 = 6*1 = 6 square feet. Wait, but the question asks for the answer in square inches, not square feet. So, I need to convert square feet to square inches.

I know that 1 foot is 12 inches, so 1 square foot is 12 inches * 12 inches = 144 square inches. Therefore, each face of the cube is 144 square inches. Since there are 6 faces, the total surface area is 6*144 square inches.

Calculating that, 6*144: Let me do 144*6. Hmm, 100*6 = 600, 40*6=240, and 4*6=24. So, adding those up: 600 + 240 = 840, and 840 + 24 = 864. So, 6*144 = 864 square inches.

Wait, let me verify that multiplication another way to be sure. 144*6: 6*140=840, 6*4=24, so 840+24=864. Yep, that's correct.

So, the total surface area is 864 square inches. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The volume was 1 cubic foot, so each edge was 1 foot. Converted that to inches (12 inches), then found the area of each face (12^2 = 144 in²), and multiplied by 6 for all faces. That gives 864 in². Seems solid.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using units from the start? Let me think. If the volume is given in cubic feet, perhaps I should convert that to cubic inches first before proceeding? Wait, but the question is about surface area, so maybe that complicates things. Let me see.

But no, actually, since the volume is in cubic feet, converting to square inches is necessary because the question asks for square inches. So, going back, if the volume is 1 cubic foot, which is 12 inches on each side, then the volume is 12*12*12 = 1728 cubic inches, but the problem said the volume is 1 cubic foot, which is 1728 cubic inches. Hmmm, that seems a bit off because the question is about a cube with volume 1 cubic foot, so I think my initial approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps I confused myself here. Let me clarify: If the cube has a volume of 1 cubic foot, that means each edge is 1 foot, which is 12 inches. So, the surface area is 6*(12 inches)^2 = 6*144 = 864 square inches. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if someone mistakenly thought that 1 cubic foot is 12^3 cubic inches (which is 1728), and then tried to calculate the surface area in cubic inches, that would be wrong because surface area is in square inches, not cubic inches. So, the key is to make sure we're dealing with the correct units throughout.

Therefore, sticking with my original approach, which was to take the volume in cubic feet, find the edge length in feet, then convert that edge length to inches, and then compute the surface area in square inches. That gives 864 square inches as the total surface area.

Just to double-check, let's go through the steps again:

1. Volume of cube = side^3 = 1 cubic foot.
2. Therefore, side length = 1 foot. (since 1^3 = 1)
3. Convert 1 foot to inches: 1 foot = 12 inches.
4. Surface area of cube = 6*(side length)^2 = 6*(12 inches)^2 = 6*144 = 864 square inches.

Yep, that all adds up. So, I think 864 square inches is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The total surface area of the cube is \boxed{864} square inches.
</think>

To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we start by determining the side length of the cube. 

1. The volume of a cube is given by the formula \( s^3 \), where \( s \) is the side length. Since the volume is 1 cubic foot, we have:
   \[
   s^3 = 1 \implies s = 1 \text{ foot}
   \]

2. Convert the side length from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, the side length in inches is:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The total surface area of a cube is given by the formula \( 6s^2 \). Substituting \( s = 12 \) inches into the formula, we get:
   \[
   6 \times (12)^2 = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches}
   \]

Thus, the total surface area of the cube is \(\boxed{864}\) square inches.
