Question:
A steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from the corners of a cube that has the shortest possible side lengths. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the cube?

Correct Answer:
A sphere with a 3-inch radius has a 6-inch diameter and can be inscribed in a cube with at least side length 6.  Thus the smallest possible cube has side length 6 and volume $6^3=\boxed{216}$ cubic inches.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out the volume of a cube from which a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made. The sphere is removed from the corners of the cube, and I have to find the cube's volume. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the sphere is inscribed in the cube somehow. But wait, it's made by removing metal from the corners of the cube, so it's not inscribed. Instead, the sphere touches the edges or the faces of the cube? Hmm, no, when you remove metal from the corners to make a sphere, it's more like the sphere is inscribed in the cube, right? Because each corner of the cube is a point where three edges meet. So the sphere would be touching those edges. That makes sense.

So, if the sphere is touching the edges of the cube, then the radius of the sphere should be related to the cube's space diagonal. Wait, no, the radius is 3 inches, so the diameter is 6 inches. Let me think about the relationship between the sphere and the cube.

In a cube, the space diagonal connects two opposite corners, passing through the interior of the cube. The formula for the space diagonal of a cube with side length 's' is \( s\sqrt{3} \). Since the sphere touches the corners, the diameter of the sphere should be equal to the space diagonal of the cube. Is that right? Let me verify.

If the sphere is touching the corners, then the distance from one corner of the cube to the opposite corner must be equal to the sphere's diameter. So, the space diagonal of the cube is equal to 2 * radius of the sphere. The radius is given as 3 inches, so the diameter is 6 inches. So, \( s\sqrt{3} = 6 \). Then, solving for 's', we get \( s = \frac{6}{\sqrt{3}} \). But that simplifies to \( 2\sqrt{3} \).

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. If the sphere is inscribed in the cube, then the sphere touches the centers of the cube's faces, not the corners. But in this case, it's touching the corners, so maybe it's different. Hmm, I think I might have confused inscribed and circumscribed.

If the sphere is touching the corners, it's actually circumscribed around the cube, meaning that the cube is inscribed within the sphere. So, the sphere's diameter would be the space diagonal of the cube. That makes sense because each vertex of the cube lies on the sphere's surface.

So, yes, the space diagonal of the cube is equal to the sphere's diameter. So, the space diagonal \( d \) is 2r = 6 inches. Therefore, \( s\sqrt{3} = 6 \). So, solving for 's', we get \( s = \frac{6}{\sqrt{3}} \). Rationalizing the denominator, that becomes \( \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{3} = 2\sqrt{3} \) inches. So, each side of the cube is \( 2\sqrt{3} \) inches.

Now, to find the volume of the cube, I need to cube the side length. So, \( V = s^3 = (2\sqrt{3})^3 \). Let's compute that. First, compute \( (2)^3 = 8 \). Then, \( (\sqrt{3})^3 = (\sqrt{3})^2 * \sqrt{3} = 3 * \sqrt{3} \). So, multiplying those together: 8 * 3 * sqrt(3) = 24 * sqrt(3). Wait, is that correct?

Hold on, 8 times 3 is 24, yes, and times sqrt(3), so 24 sqrt(3). So, the volume of the cube is 24 sqrt(3) cubic inches. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, if the sphere is inscribed such that it touches the corners, then the sphere's diameter is equal to the space diagonal of the cube, which is correct. So, the space diagonal is 6 inches, so the cube's side is 6 / sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3). Then, the volume is (2 sqrt(3))^3 = 8 * (sqrt(3))^3 = 8 * 3 * sqrt(3) = 24 sqrt(3). That seems right.

But wait, another thought: sometimes in these problems, people think of the sphere inscribed in the cube, but in this case, it's inscribed from the corners. So, perhaps the radius is related to something else.

Alternatively, maybe the sphere is inscribed such that it touches the centers of each face of the cube, making the diameter equal to the edge length. But in that case, the radius would be s/2, so s = 6 inches. Then, the volume would be 216, which is too big. But the problem says the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners, so it's touching the corners, not the centers.

Alternatively, maybe the sphere is inscribed in such a way that each edge is tangent to the sphere. So, each edge of the cube is tangent to the sphere, which would make the sphere's radius related to the cube's edges.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the distance from the center of the sphere to the edge of the cube. If the sphere is touching the edges, then the radius is equal to half the distance from the center of the cube to the edge.

Let me visualize this. The cube has a center point. Each edge is at a distance of s/2 from the center along each axis. So, the radius of the sphere would be equal to that distance, which is s/2. Wait, no, that would be if the sphere was inscribed, touching the centers of the faces. But if the sphere is touching the edges, then the radius is equal to half the edge length.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the cube in 3D coordinates. Let me place the cube with its center at the origin (0,0,0). Then, each vertex would be at (s/2, s/2, s/2) in some octant. The sphere is touching those vertices, so the distance from the center of the sphere (which is at the cube's center, (0,0,0)) to each vertex is equal to the radius, which is 3 inches.

So, the distance from (0,0,0) to (s/2, s/2, s/2) is sqrt( (s/2)^2 + (s/2)^2 + (s/2)^2 ). That's sqrt( 3*(s/2)^2 ) which simplifies to (s/2)*sqrt(3). But this distance must equal the radius, which is 3 inches. Therefore, (s/2)*sqrt(3) = 3. Solving for s, we get s = (3 * 2)/sqrt(3) = 6 / sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3). So, same result as before. So, the side length is 2 sqrt(3) inches.

So, the volume of the cube is (2 sqrt(3))^3, which is 8*(sqrt(3))^3. Since (sqrt(3))^3 is sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)*sqrt(3) = 3*sqrt(3). Therefore, 8*3*sqrt(3) = 24 sqrt(3). So, 24 sqrt(3) cubic inches.

Wait, but let me check units and anything else. The radius is given in inches, so the volume will be in cubic inches, which is consistent. So, I think that's correct.

Alternatively, if I consider that the sphere is inscribed in the cube but touching the edges, then the sphere's radius is equal to half the space diagonal, so 3 = (s sqrt(3))/2. Therefore, s = (3 * 2)/sqrt(3) = 6 / sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3). So, same result. Volume is 24 sqrt(3).

So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes:

1. Sphere has radius 3 inches, so diameter 6 inches.
2. The sphere is inscribed such that it touches the corners of the cube, meaning the space diagonal of the cube is equal to the sphere's diameter.
3. Space diagonal formula: s sqrt(3) = 6
4. Solving for s: s = 6 / sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3)
5. Volume of cube: s^3 = (2 sqrt(3))^3 = 24 sqrt(3)
6. Wait, let me compute (2 sqrt(3))^3 again: 2^3 is 8, and (sqrt(3))^3 is 3 sqrt(3). So, 8 * 3 sqrt(3) is 24 sqrt(3). Yep, that's correct.

No, I think that's solid. The logic flows correctly. I considered two different ways of thinking about whether the sphere is inscribed at the centers of the faces or at the edges, but in both cases, the result was the same. So, I think 24 sqrt(3) is the correct volume.

Therefore, the volume of the cube is \( 24\sqrt{3} \) cubic inches.

**Final Answer**
The volume of the cube is \boxed{24\sqrt{3}} cubic inches.
</think>

To find the volume of the cube from which a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made, we start by noting that the sphere is inscribed such that it touches the corners of the cube. This means the space diagonal of the cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere.

1. The radius of the sphere is 3 inches, so the diameter is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) inches.
2. The space diagonal of the cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere, which is 6 inches.
3. The formula for the space diagonal of a cube with side length \(s\) is \(s\sqrt{3}\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   s\sqrt{3} = 6
   \]
4. Solving for \(s\):
   \[
   s = \frac{6}{\sqrt{3}} = 2\sqrt{3}
   \]
5. The volume of the cube is \(s^3\). Substituting \(s = 2\sqrt{3}\):
   \[
   (2\sqrt{3})^3 = 8 \times (3\sqrt{3}) = 24\sqrt{3}
   \]

Thus, the volume of the cube is \(\boxed{24\sqrt{3}}\) cubic inches.
