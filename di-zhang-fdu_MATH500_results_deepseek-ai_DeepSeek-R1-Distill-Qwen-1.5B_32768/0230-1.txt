Question:
What's the largest eight-digit base 2 integer?  Express your answer in base 10.

Correct Answer:
The largest eight-digit base 2 integer is 1 less than the smallest nine-digit base 2 integer, which is $$ 100000000_{2} = 1 \cdot 2^8 = 256. $$Thus, the largest eight-digit base 2 integer is $256 - 1 = \boxed{255}$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out the largest eight-digit base 2 integer and express it in base 10. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I should make sure I understand what is being asked here. An eight-digit base 2 integer means a binary number that has exactly eight digits, right? But wait, I think binary numbers can have digits 0 and 1, but sometimes people refer to the number of digits as how long the number is. 

So, in binary, each digit is a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit which is 2^0, then 2^1, 2^2, and so on. Since we're dealing with an eight-digit binary number, the leftmost digit will be the 2^7 place because binary numbers are base 2. That means the positions are from 2^7 down to 2^0. 

Now, the question is asking for the largest such number. In binary, the largest number with n digits is the one where all the digits except the leftmost one are zeros. So, for an eight-digit binary number, the largest one would be 1 followed by seven zeros. That makes sense because if you put a one in the highest place value, the number will be as large as possible. 

Let me write that out. In binary, that number is 10000000. But the problem wants the answer in base 10, so I need to convert this binary number into base 10. How do I do that? Well, each digit represents a power of 2, so starting from the right, the first digit is 2^0, then 2^1, and so on. 

So, let's break down 10000000 in binary. Starting from the right:

- The rightmost digit is 0, which is 2^0 place.
- Next digit to the left is also 0, which is 2^1.
- This pattern continues until the eighth digit from the right, which is 1, and that's the 2^7 place.

So, in total, the value is 1 multiplied by 2^7 plus all the zeros multiplied by their respective powers of 2. Since the other digits are zero, they don't contribute anything to the total value.

Calculating 2^7: I know that 2^1 is 2, 2^2 is 4, 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64, and 2^7 is 128. So, 2^7 is 128.

Therefore, the binary number 10000000 is equal to 128 in base 10. 

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me verify. Converting binary numbers to decimal is straightforward, right? Each digit is a coefficient for a power of 2. So, for 10000000:

1 * 2^7 + 0 * 2^6 + 0 * 2^5 + 0 * 2^4 + 0 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0.

Calculating that step by step:

- 1 * 128 = 128
- 0 * 64 = 0
- 0 * 32 = 0
- 0 * 16 = 0
- 0 * 8 = 0
- 0 * 4 = 0
- 0 * 2 = 0
- 0 * 1 = 0

Adding all those up: 128 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 128.

Yep, that checks out. So, the largest eight-digit binary number is indeed 128 in base 10.

But just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me think again. The number is eight digits, so the first digit can't be zero because that would make it a seven-digit number. So, the first digit must be 1. The rest can be 0s. So, 10000000 is correct.

Is there a way to have a larger number? Well, if the first digit is 1, it's the largest possible digit. If it's 0, the number would be smaller. So, 10000000 is indeed the largest eight-digit binary number.

Therefore, I feel confident that the answer is 128 in base 10. 

**Final Answer**
The largest eight-digit base 2 integer expressed in base 10 is \boxed{128}.
</think>

To determine the largest eight-digit base 2 integer and express it in base 10, we start by recognizing that an eight-digit binary number must have the form where the leftmost digit is 1 and the remaining seven digits are 0. This binary number is \(10000000_2\).

Next, we convert this binary number to base 10. Each digit in the binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit which is \(2^0\). For the binary number \(10000000_2\):

- The rightmost seven digits are 0, contributing nothing to the value.
- The eighth digit from the right is 1, which is \(2^7\).

Calculating \(2^7\):
\[ 2^7 = 128 \]

Thus, the binary number \(10000000_2\) converts to the decimal number 128.

\[
\boxed{128}
\]
