Question:
Bob and Alice each have a bag that contains one ball of each of the colors,  blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob then randomly selects one ball from his bag and  puts it into Alice's bag. What is the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same?

Correct Answer:
After Alice puts the ball into Bob's bag, his bag will contain six balls: two of one color and one of each of the other colors. After Bob selects a ball and places it into Alice's bag, the two bags will have the same contents if and only if Bob picked one of the two balls in his bag that are the same color. Because there are six balls in the bag when Bob makes his selection, the probability of selecting one of the same colored pair is $2/6=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Gold:
\frac{1}{3}

Wrong Prediction:
\frac{1}{6}

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so here's this problem: Bob and Alice each have a bag with one ball of each color—blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Then Bob randomly selects one ball from his bag and puts it into Alice's bag. We need to find the probability that after this process, the contents of the two bags are the same.

Hmm, let's see. So each bag initially has one of each color. So both have the same number of balls, right? Let me check: Alice has one, Bob has one. So when Alice puts one into Bob's, Bob now has two balls, and Alice has zero. Then Bob selects one of his two balls and puts it back into Alice's bag. So after that, Alice has two balls, and Bob has one. So the number of balls in each bag changes—Alice goes from 0 to 2, Bob from 1 to 2.

But we need the contents of the bags to be the same. So, for the bags to have the same contents, they must have the same set of colors. So, for example, if Alice initially had a blue ball and Bob had a green one, after the transfers, if Alice puts a green into Bob's and Bob puts a green into Alice's, then both have blue and green. Wait, but initially, they each have all five colors. So maybe the only way the bags can end up with the same contents is if, after the transfers, both have the same set of colors, which would require that they both have all five colors again.

Wait, but initially, both have all five colors. So if Alice transfers one color to Bob, and then Bob transfers one color back, for the contents to be the same, Bob must have transferred the same color that Alice initially had. Let me think.

Let me try to model this. Let me denote the colors as B, G, O, R, V.

Initially, Alice has {B, G, O, R, V}, and Bob has the same.

Step 1: Alice picks a random color from her bag and puts it into Bob's. Let's say she picks color C1. So Bob now has {B, G, O, R, V, C1}, and Alice has {C1}.

Step 2: Bob picks a random color from his bag and puts it into Alice's. So Bob has 6 balls now, so he picks one uniformly at random. Let's denote this color as C2.

So after this, Alice has {C1, C2}, and Bob has {B, G, O, R, V, C1 - C2}.

We are to find the probability that Alice and Bob have the same contents. So, for the bags to be the same, Alice must have a subset of Bob's bag or vice versa? Wait, no. Since they both have two balls each after the transfers.

Wait, actually, it's possible that after the transfer, both have the same set of two colors. So, for example, Alice has {B, G} and Bob has {B, G}, which would satisfy the condition. But in order for that to happen, Alice must have transferred a color that Bob later transferred back, and that color had to be the same.

Wait, maybe it's better to model it step by step.

Let me think: the initial step is that Alice transfers one color to Bob. Then Bob transfers one color back, and the question is whether the set of Alice's bag equals the set of Bob's bag.

So, for the sets to be equal, after the transfers, Alice must have the same two colors as Bob. Since Alice started with one color, added one, and then lost one, so she ends up with two. Bob started with one, added one, and then lost one, so he also ends up with two. So the two bags each have two colors.

So, for the two bags to have the same contents, they must have the same two colors. So, for each color in Alice's bag, Bob must have it, and vice versa.

So, the process is:

1. Alice picks a color to put into Bob's bag. Let's say she picks color X. So Bob now has X in his bag along with the original four.

2. Then Bob picks a color from his bag. For the final sets to be equal, he must pick color X, so that he can put it back into Alice's bag. So, Bob must pick color X, which was the one Alice added.

If that's the case, then after the transfer, Alice has X and whatever she had before, which was one color. Bob has his original four colors plus X.

But for the final sets to be equal, Alice must have X and Y, and Bob must have X and Y as well. So Alice must have transferred X, and Bob must have transferred X.

So, the probability that Alice transfers X and then Bob transfers X is what we need.

But wait, maybe it's more complicated. Because after Alice transfers X, Bob's bag has X plus four original colors. Then Bob picks a color at random—for this to be X, the probability is 1/5. Then, after that, Alice's bag has X and whatever she had before. So, if Alice had color Y, then she had only Y before the transfer.

Wait, let me model this more formally.

Let’s denote the initial colors as B, G, O, R, V.

Let’s say that when Alice transfers a color, she picks one color at random. So probability of picking any color is 1/5.

Suppose she picks color X. So Bob's bag now has {B, G, O, R, V, X}, and Alice's bag has {X}.

Then Bob picks a color at random from his bag, which now has 6 colors. So the probability that he picks color X is 1/6.

If he picks X, then Alice's bag becomes {X, Y}, where Y was the color she had before (which was the one she picked from initially). Similarly, Bob's bag becomes {B, G, O, R, V, X} - {X} = {B, G, O, R, V}.

Wait, but that can't be, because Bob already had X in his bag before, and then he puts X back into Alice's bag. So, actually, after that, Alice's bag would have X (from her initial one) and whatever she had before, which was one color, so two colors in total. Bob's bag would have the original four, plus X (which he removed and put in), so also four colors. Wait, so Bob now has four colors, but Alice has two. So the sets can't be equal unless he also has two colors.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

After Alice transfers X to Bob's bag, Bob has six colors: the original five plus X.

Then Bob selects a color to put back into Alice's bag. So, if Bob selects X, then he puts it back into Alice's bag, which had only X. So Alice ends up with X (from Bob's transfer) and whatever she had before, which was one color, so two colors in total.

Bob, on the other hand, after the transfer, has six colors minus the one he transferred, so five colors: the original four plus X (since he put X back). Wait, no: Bob had six colors, he transferred one, so he has five colors left. So Alice has two, Bob has five.

Wait, that can't be equal. So, perhaps my earlier thought was incorrect. Maybe the only way the bags can be equal is if Alice's bag ends up with two colors, which are the same as Bob's. But for Bob's bag to have two colors, he must have removed one color from his five, so he had six colors, removed one, and now has five. But initially, he had five, now he has five. So, they can't have two and five.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, no, hold on. Alice starts with one color, Bob with one. Alice puts one into Bob, so Bob has two. Then Bob puts one into Alice, so Alice has two, and Bob has one. So, actually, Alice ends up with two, Bob ends up with two. Wait, that's correct.

Wait, so both Alice and Bob end up with two balls each. So the initial process is that Alice adds one to Bob, then Bob adds one back to Alice, so each ends up with two.

So, in order for the bags to be equal, Alice's two balls must be exactly the same as Bob's two balls.

So, for that to happen, the two balls Alice has must be exactly the two balls that Bob has. So, for example, if Alice had color X and Bob had color Y, then after the transfers, Alice has X and Y, and Bob has the original four colors plus X. So, unless X is one of the original four, Bob doesn't have X. So, perhaps the only way they can end up with the same two is if Alice transfers a color that Bob later transfers back.

So, let's model this.

Let me denote:

- Initial colors: A, B, C, D, E. Let's use A = B, B = G, C = O, D = R, E = V for clarity.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the standard colors.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the transfer process.

First, Alice picks a color, say X, to add to Bob's bag. Then Bob picks a color, say Y, to add to Alice's bag. For the final bags to be equal, the set {X, Y} must be equal to {A, B, C, D, E}.

Wait, no, because both Alice and Bob end up with two colors each. Wait, but initially, both had five colors each. So, after the transfers, Alice has two, Bob has five? Or is it the other way around.

Wait, hold on. Let me recount.

- Initially, Alice has five balls: {A, B, C, D, E}. Bob has the same.

- Alice transfers one: say she picks A and puts it into Bob's bag. Now, Bob has {A, B, C, D, E, A}, which is six balls. Alice has {A}.

- Then Bob transfers one: he picks a color from his six, which includes A and the other four. So, the probability that he picks A is 1/6. If he picks A, then he puts it back into Alice's bag, which had only A. So, Alice now has {A, something else} (since she started with A and then Bob gave her A, but wait, she only had A before, so after adding A, she has two A's? Wait, no. Wait, hold on.

Wait, no, Alice started with one A. She adds another A, so she now has two A's. Bob, after adding A, had six balls, then he removes one (A) and puts it back. So, Bob now has five balls: {A, B, C, D, E}. Alice has {A, A}—but wait, but the problem says each bag has one ball of each color. Wait, no—the problem says, "Bob and Alice each have a bag that contains one ball of each of the colors, blue, green, orange, red, and violet." So, each bag initially has one of each color, meaning they have one blue, one green, etc. So, when Alice adds a color to Bob's bag, she's increasing Bob's count of that color by one, and Bob, after adding, has two of that color. But for the final bags to have the same contents, Bob must have the same two colors as Alice.

Wait, but Alice, after adding, has two of color X, but Bob, after adding back, has five colors, so unless color X is among the original five, he can't have two of it.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me consider that both Alice and Bob end up with two balls each. So, for the bags to be the same, they must have the same two colors.

So, the only way that can happen is if the two balls Alice has are exactly the two balls that Bob has, and vice versa.

Therefore, for this to happen, the color that Alice added to Bob's bag must be one that Bob later adds back. So, the process is:

1. Alice picks a color X (with probability 1/5).

2. Bob, upon receiving color X, picks a color Y (with probability 1/6).

3. For the final bags to be equal, Y must be X, otherwise, Bob would have one more color than Alice.

Wait, no. If Bob picks X, he puts it back into Alice's bag. So, Alice's bag becomes {X, A}, where A is the original color she had. Bob's bag becomes {B, G, O, R, V, X} - {X} = {B, G, O, R, V}. So, unless X is in the original set, Bob doesn't have X. Therefore, unless X was already in Bob's original set, Bob doesn't have it.

Wait, but Bob had all five colors originally. So, if Alice adds a color X that Bob doesn't have, then Bob doesn't have X, so Bob can't have both X and Alice's other color.

Wait, let me think differently.

Let’s denote:

- Let Alice’s original bag be {A, B, C, D, E}.

- Bob’s original bag is {A, B, C, D, E}.

- Step 1: Alice selects one color, say X, and adds it to Bob’s bag, making Bob’s bag {A, B, C, D, E, X}.

- Step 2: Bob selects a color from his bag {A, B, C, D, E, X} uniformly at random. The probability of selecting X is 1/6.

- If he selects X, he puts it back into Alice's bag. Now, Alice has {A, B, C, D, E, X}, and Bob has {A, B, C, D, E, X} - {X} = {A, B, C, D, E}.

So, in this case, Alice has all six colors, and Bob has all five colors. So, the bags are not the same.

Wait, so if Alice picks X, and then Bob picks X, he puts it back, so Alice has X and Bob has his original five colors. So, unless X was already in Bob's original five, which it was, because Bob originally had all five. So, Bob now has five colors, Alice has six.

So, they can't be the same.

Wait, so in order for the bags to be the same, after Bob puts back X, Alice must have two colors, and Bob must have two colors, but the only way that can happen is if Bob transferred the same color that Alice added.

Wait, maybe let me model it in another way.

Suppose Alice initially picks color X. Bob then, after receiving X, picks a color Y. If Y is X, then Alice gets X and whatever she had (which was one color), and Bob gets his original four colors plus X. So, unless X was already in Bob's original colors, Bob doesn't have X.

Wait, but Bob's original colors were all five. So, unless X was already in Alice's original colors, which it isn't, because Alice's original colors are all five, and Bob's original colors are all five.

Wait, hold on. If Alice adds a color X to Bob's bag, which already has all five colors. So, Bob's bag now has all five colors plus X. Then Bob selects a color Y. If Y is X, he puts it back into Alice's bag. So, Alice now has X and whatever she had before (which was one color). So, she has two colors. Bob, on the other hand, has all five colors.

But Bob, after putting back X, would have five colors, so they can't be the same.

Wait, so in order for the bags to be the same, Bob must have transferred a color that Alice added, but since Bob only has five colors, he can only transfer one, which could be the same as Alice's.

Wait, maybe there's only one way this can happen: if Alice picks a color, and Bob picks the same color, then they both have two balls each.

So, let's consider: Alice picks X, Bob picks X. Then, Alice's bag is {X, something}, and Bob's bag is {X, original four colors}. So, unless X is already in Bob's original four, which it isn't, Bob doesn't have X.

Wait, but Bob's original four colors were all five. Wait, no, both Alice and Bob started with all five colors. So, if Alice adds X to Bob's bag, which already has all five, so Bob's bag becomes all five plus X. Then Bob picks X, and puts it back into Alice's bag.

So, Alice now has X and whatever she had before (which was one color), so two colors. Bob has all five colors again. So, unless X was already in Bob's original four, which it wasn't, he can't have X.

Wait, that suggests that unless X was already in Alice's original four, which it wasn't, Bob can't have X.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe a different approach.

Let me think of all possible cases.

After the transfers:

- Alice's bag has two colors: X and Y.

- Bob's bag has two colors: X and Z.

For the bags to be the same, Alice must have exactly the same two colors as Bob. So, {X, Y} = {X, Z}, which implies Y = Z.

So, the only way for the bags to be equal is if Alice and Bob both have the same two colors, meaning that the color Bob added back to Alice is the same as the color Alice added to Bob.

Therefore, the first step is that Alice adds a color X to Bob's bag. Then Bob adds the same color X to Alice's bag.

So, let's compute the probability of this happening.

First, Alice picks a color X (uniformly at random from the five colors). Probability is 1/5.

Then, Bob has six colors: the original five plus X. So, he picks a color uniformly at random. The probability that he picks X is 1/6.

If he does pick X, then Alice's bag becomes {X, whatever Alice had before} and Bob's bag becomes {X, original four colors}.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify.

Wait, initially, Alice has {A, B, C, D, E}.

Bob has {A, B, C, D, E}.

1. Alice picks a color, say X, and puts it into Bob's bag. So, Bob's bag now has {A, B, C, D, E, X}, and Alice has {X}.

2. Then, Bob picks a color at random from his six-color bag. The probability he picks X is 1/6.

- If he picks X, he puts it back into Alice's bag. So, Alice's bag becomes {X, A, B, C, D, E} (since she had {X} before, and Bob transferred X to him).

- But wait, Bob originally had {A, B, C, D, E}, so after adding X, he has {A, B, C, D, E, X}. Then he removes X and puts it back, so he's back to {A, B, C, D, E}.

- Therefore, Alice's bag is {X, A, B, C, D, E}, and Bob's bag is {A, B, C, D, E}. So, the sets are not equal.

Wait, so in this case, they can't be equal. So, this seems to suggest that the only way the bags can be equal is if Alice picks X and Bob doesn't pick X, but for that, Bob doesn't need to pick X. Wait, but if Bob doesn't pick X, then Alice's bag is {X, A, B, C, D, E}, and Bob's bag is {A, B, C, D, E}, so they can't be equal.

Alternatively, is there a scenario where the two bags can be equal?

Wait, maybe if both Alice and Bob end up with the same two colors, which are not necessarily the same as the original. So, for example, Alice might have color X and Y, and Bob has color X and Y, regardless of what they were before.

Wait, but in that case, the color that Alice added was X, and Bob needs to add X back to Alice's bag. So, the process is:

1. Alice picks X, adds to Bob's bag.

2. Bob then picks X and adds it back to Alice's bag.

So, Alice's bag becomes {X, whatever she had before} (so two colors), and Bob's bag becomes {X, original four colors} (so five colors). So, unless X was already in Bob's original set, which it wasn't, Bob can't have X. So, the only way for Alice and Bob to have the same two colors is if X was in Bob's original set, but since Bob's original set was all five colors, and Alice's original set was all five colors, that can't happen. Wait, unless X was in Bob's original set, but that's not possible because Alice's original set was all five, and Bob's original set was all five. So, X is in both. So, if Alice picks X, which is in Bob's set, then Bob can pick X and put it back into Alice's set.

Wait, let me think. If Alice picks X, which is in Bob's set, then Bob has all five colors plus X. Then, Bob picks X and puts it back into Alice's bag. So, Alice's bag becomes {X, whatever she had before} (so two colors), and Bob's bag becomes {X, original four colors} (so five colors). So, unless X was already in Bob's original four, which it wasn't, Bob can't have X.

Wait, but Bob's original four colors were all five. So, if Alice picks X, which is one of Bob's original four, then Bob's bag becomes {A, B, C, D, E, X}. So, Bob picks X and puts it back into Alice's bag.

So, Alice's bag becomes {X, A, B, C, D, E}, and Bob's bag is back to {A, B, C, D, E}. So, they can't be the same.

Wait, so this suggests that it's impossible for the bags to be the same, unless Alice and Bob somehow somehow end up with the same two colors, but given the way the transfers happen, it seems impossible.

But that can't be, because the problem is asking for the probability, so it must be possible.

Wait, maybe I have a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is that Alice selects one color, and then Bob selects one, but we don't know the order of the transfers.

Wait, let's consider that Alice first selects a color, then Bob selects a color. Then, the process is:

- Alice picks X, adds to Bob's bag.

- Then Bob picks Y, adds to Alice's bag.

So, the probability that Alice's bag equals Bob's bag is when {X, something} equals {Y, something}.

Wait, so for that to happen, X must equal Y, and the other elements must be equal as well.

But since the colors are all distinct, except for X and Y, unless X = Y, the sets can't be equal.

So, to have {X, A} = {Y, B}, then X must equal Y, and A must equal B, which is impossible because all colors are distinct.

Wait, so that suggests that the only way for the sets to be equal is if the color added by Alice is the same as the color added by Bob, and the other elements are such that they balance out.

Wait, perhaps if Alice adds a color X, and Bob adds a color Y, and then the remaining colors are such that when you add X and Y, the sets become equal.

But the problem is, Alice only adds one color, and Bob only adds one color. So, unless X and Y are the same, the sets can't be equal.

Wait, unless X and Y are the same, but Bob can't add X again because he already added it to Alice's bag.

Wait, no, Bob can add a color that Alice added, but the key is that for the sets to be equal, the two colors in Alice's bag must be the same as the two colors in Bob's bag.

Wait, but Alice's bag has X and whatever she had before. Since she only had X, it's X and one other color. Bob's bag has Y and whatever he had before. Since he had Y, it's Y and four other colors.

So, unless X is one of the four colors in Bob's original four, which it isn't, Bob can't have the same two colors.

Wait, but Bob's original four are all five colors, so if Alice adds X, which is one of the five colors, Bob can't have X in his original four. Therefore, unless X was one of the original four, Bob can't have X.

Wait, but Alice's original four are all five colors, so X is one of the five.

Wait, perhaps the only way for the sets to be equal is if Alice and Bob both have the same two colors, which are the same two colors that they started with, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe it's better to look at this as permutations.

Alternatively, maybe I need to model the problem step by step.

Let me denote:

- Alice's bag: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5.

- Bob's bag: B1, B2, B3, B4, B5.

Initially, all A's and all B's are the same.

Step 1: Alice picks a color, say Ai, and puts it into Bob's bag.

So now, Bob's bag has B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, Ai.

Alice's bag has 5 colors minus Ai, so 4 colors.

Step 2: Bob picks a color from his bag, which now has 6 colors: 5 original plus Ai.

He picks a color Yj, and puts it back into Alice's bag.

So, Alice's bag now has 4 + 1 = 5 colors: 3 original, plus Ai, plus whatever she had before (which was 4 colors, so now 5).

Wait, no, Alice had 4 colors, added Ai, so now 5.

Bob's bag now has 6 - 1 = 5 colors.

Wait, so for the final bags to be equal, Alice's bag must have 5 colors, and Bob's bag must have 5 colors, and they must be the same set.

So, let's think about what Alice's bag has after the transfers:

- If Alice added Ai, and then Bob added Aj, then Alice has Ai and three of her original colors.

- Bob has Aj and four of his original colors.

For Alice and Bob's bags to be equal, the sets {Ai, Ai1, Ai2, Ai3, Ai4} must equal {Aj, Bj, Bk, Bl, Bm}.

But Aj is Bob's original color, which was one of B1, B2, B3, B4, B5.

So, unless Aj is one of Ai1, Ai2, Ai3, Ai4, Bob can't have Aj. But Bob's original colors were all five, so Aj is one of them. So, unless Aj is one of Ai's original colors, Bob can't have Aj.

Wait, but in Alice's bag, she has Ai plus her original three colors. So, unless Aj is one of Ai's original three, Bob can't have Aj.

Wait, but Ai is one of Bob's original colors, so for Bob to have Aj, which is one of Alice's original colors, Bob must have had that color.

But in this case, Bob had all five original colors. So, unless Aj is in Alice's original colors, Bob can't have Aj.

But Alice's original colors are all five, so Aj is in Bob's original colors.

Wait, so unless Bob already had Aj in his original colors, which he did, he can't have Aj in his final bag.

Wait, so the only way Alice's bag and Bob's bag can be equal is if Aj is not in Bob's original colors. But that's impossible because Bob's original colors were all five.

Wait, so maybe it's impossible for the bags to be equal.

But the problem says "the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same." So, maybe it's possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe in the first step, when Alice adds Ai to Bob's bag, Bob's bag now has 6 colors, including Ai. Then Bob picks Aj, which is one of the original five, so Bob's bag becomes 5 colors again.

Then, Alice adds Aj back to her bag, which had 4 colors, so now Alice has 5 colors, which include Ai and Aj.

But if Alice added Ai and then Aj, is that possible?

Wait, no, because Bob picks Aj from his bag which already contains Ai. So, Bob can't pick Ai again; he can only pick Aj.

Wait, so after the first transfer, Bob has Ai in his bag, and then when he picks, he can't pick Ai again because it's already there.

Wait, no, when Bob picks a color from his bag, which now has six colors: A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, and Ai. So, he picks Aj, which is one of A1-A5 or B1-B5.

So, if he picks Ai, he puts it back into Alice's bag, which had Ai in it. Then Alice's bag becomes Ai, A1, A2, A3, A4, Aj.

Bob's bag becomes the original four colors plus Aj, which are A1, A2, A3, A4, Aj, Aj, Aj? Wait, no, Bob only had five colors before, so if he removes Aj, he has A1, A2, A3, A4, Aj.

Wait, so Bob's bag is now five colors: A1, A2, A3, A4, Aj.

Alice's bag is now six colors: Ai, A1, A2, A3, A4, Aj.

So, for the bags to be equal, Alice's bag must have the same colors as Bob's bag.

So, the only way is if Aj is not in Alice's original four colors. But Aj is one of Bob's original colors, so unless Aj is in Alice's original four, which it isn't, Bob can't have Aj.

Wait, so unless Aj is in Alice's original four, Bob can't have Aj. So, Bob can only have Aj if Aj was in Alice's original four colors. But Alice's original four are all five, so Aj is one of them.

Therefore, if Bob picks Aj, he can only have Aj in his bag, which is one of Alice's original colors.

So, in that case, the only way the bags can be equal is if Aj was not in Alice's original four, but Aj is in Alice's original four.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of permutations.

Alternatively, let's compute the probability by considering the possible cases.

Case 1: Alice picks a color, say X, Bob then picks X. Then, Alice's bag is {X, A, B, C, D}, and Bob's bag is {A, B, C, D, E}. So, the sets are different.

Case 2: Alice picks X, Bob picks Y, which is not X. Then, Alice's bag is {X, A, B, C, D}, and Bob's bag is {A, B, C, D, E, Y}. So, the sets are different.

Wait, so in neither case are the sets equal. So, is the probability zero?

But the problem says "What is the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same?" So, perhaps it's always impossible? But that seems odd.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe the process doesn't require Bob to pick the same color Alice added. Wait, let me think again.

After Alice adds a color X to Bob's bag, Bob's bag has six colors: original five and X.

Then Bob picks a color Y, which could be X or any of the original four.

If Y is X, then Bob puts it back into Alice's bag, which now has X and her original four colors.

But for Alice's bag to have the same two colors as Bob's, Bob's bag must have the same two colors as Alice's. But Bob's bag has six colors, so unless Y is X, and Bob's bag has the same two colors as Alice's, which is not possible.

Wait, but maybe the two colors are the same as Alice's initial colors.

Wait, let's see.

Suppose Alice picks color X and adds it to Bob's bag. Then, Bob's bag has six colors: original five plus X.

Bob then picks a color Y, which could be X or any of the original four.

If Bob picks X, he puts it back into Alice's bag, so Alice's bag has {X, A, B, C, D, E}, and Bob's bag is {A, B, C, D, E}.

If Bob picks Y (which is not X), he puts it back into Alice's bag, so Alice's bag has {X, A, B, C, D}, and Bob's bag has {A, B, C, D, E, Y}.

In either case, the sets are different because Bob's bag has five colors, and Alice's bag has six colors.

Wait, so unless Y is the same as X, but then Bob can't have X in his bag.

Wait, so in all cases, the sets are different. Therefore, the probability is zero.

But that seems counterintuitive because the problem is asking for a probability, implying that it's non-zero.

Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.

Wait, let me reread the problem: "Bob and Alice each have a bag that contains one ball of each of the colors, blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob then randomly selects one ball from Alice's bag and puts it into Alice's bag. What is the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same?"

Wait, so after the transfers, the bags must have the same contents.

So, the key is that Alice's bag and Bob's bag have the same five colors each.

But, as we saw, in the first transfer, Alice adds a color to Bob's bag, which now has six colors. Then Bob adds a color back to Alice's bag. So, the total number of colors in Alice's bag is now five, and Bob's bag is also five.

But in order for the bags to have the same contents, Alice's original four plus X must equal Bob's original four plus Y.

But X and Y are different colors, unless...

Wait, unless X is one of Bob's original colors, but Bob's original colors were all five.

Wait, perhaps if Alice and Bob somehow end up with the same two colors, but it's not possible because Alice had one color added, which Bob must have put back.

Wait, maybe the only way is if the color Alice added is the same as the color Bob added.

Wait, let's model this as a permutation.

After Alice adds a color, say X, and Bob adds a color, say Y, then Alice's bag becomes {X, A, B, C, D} and Bob's bag becomes {Y, A, B, C, D, E}. So, for them to be equal, {X, A, B, C, D} must equal {Y, A, B, C, D, E}, which would require X = Y and E must be in Alice's bag, but E isn't in Alice's bag. So, X must be E? But Bob added Y, which is not E unless Y is E.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the probability is zero, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the only way the bags can be equal is if the color added by Alice is the same as the color added by Bob, and the other colors are such that they balance out.

But since Alice adds one color, and Bob adds one color, the only way the sets are equal is if the color added by Alice is equal to the color added by Bob, and the remaining colors are the same.

But since Alice's original colors are all five, and Bob's original colors are all five, the only way for Bob's added color to be in Alice's original colors is if Bob picks one of the original four colors. But since Bob picks from the six-color bag, which includes Alice's original five plus the one he added, so Bob has a 1/6 chance of picking X, which is in Alice's original colors, and a 5/6 chance of picking something else.

Wait, so if Bob picks X, he puts it back into Alice's bag, so Alice's bag becomes {X, A, B, C, D, E}, and Bob's bag becomes {A, B, C, D, E, X}.

So, in this case, Alice's bag has all five colors, and Bob's bag has all five colors. So, the bags are equal.

Similarly, if Bob picks any other color, say Y, not equal to X, then Alice's bag becomes {X, A, B, C, D}, and Bob's bag becomes {A, B, C, D, E, Y}.

So, the sets are not equal.

Therefore, the only way for the bags to be equal is if Bob picks X, which is the color Alice added, so that Alice gets all five colors, and Bob's bag also ends up with all five colors.

Therefore, the probability is equal to the probability that Bob picks X when he has six colors, including X.

So, the probability is 1/6.

Wait, so that's the answer? 1/6.

But let me verify.

If Alice picks X, then Bob's bag has six colors: five original plus X.

He picks X with probability 1/6, which puts it back into Alice's bag.

Thus, Alice's bag becomes {X, A, B, C, D, E}, and Bob's bag is {A, B, C, D, E, X}.

So, the bags are equal.

If Bob picks any other color Y, then Alice's bag becomes {X, A, B, C, D}, and Bob's bag becomes {A, B, C, D, E, Y}, which are different.

Therefore, the probability that the bags are equal is equal to the probability that Bob picks X when he has six colors, including X, which is 1/6.

Therefore, the probability is 1/6.

Wait, so final answer is 1/6.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}.
</think>

Bob and Alice each have a bag containing one ball of each color: blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Then, Bob randomly selects one ball from Alice's bag and puts it back into Alice's bag. We need to find the probability that the contents of the two bags are the same after these transfers.

1. **Initial Setup**: Both Alice and Bob have five colors each.
2. **Alice's Transfer**: Alice picks a color \( X \) and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob's bag now has six colors: the original five plus \( X \).
3. **Bob's Transfer**: Bob picks a color \( Y \) from his bag. If \( Y = X \), he puts it back into Alice's bag. If \( Y \neq X \), he puts it into Alice's bag.

To have the same contents in both bags, Alice's bag must contain the same set of colors as Bob's bag. For this to happen, Bob must pick the same color \( X \) that Alice added to his bag. This ensures that Alice's bag ends up with all five colors, and Bob's bag also ends up with all five colors.

The probability that Bob picks \( X \) when he has six colors (including \( X \)) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

Thus, the probability that the contents of the two bags are the same is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}\).
