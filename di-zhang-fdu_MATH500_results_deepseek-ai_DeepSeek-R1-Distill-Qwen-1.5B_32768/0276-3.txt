Question:
A sequence $(a_n)$ is defined as follows:
\[a_{i + 1} = \frac{1}{1 - a_i}\]for $i \ge 1.$  If $a_3 = a_1,$ compute $(a_9)^9.$

Correct Answer:
First, if $a_3 = a_1,$ then
\[a_1 = a_3 = a_5 = a_7 = a_9,\]so $(a_9)^9 = (a_1)^9.$

We have that
\begin{align*}
a_2 &= \frac{1}{1 - a_1}, \\
a_3 &= \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1 - a_1}{1 - a_1 - 1} = \frac{1 - a_1}{-a_1}.
\end{align*}Then
\[\frac{1 - a_1}{-a_1} = a_1,\]so $1 - a_1 = -a_1^2.$  Then $a_1^2 - a_1 + 1 = 0.$  Multiplying both sides by $a_1 + 1,$ we get
\[(a_1 + 1)(a_1 ^2 - a_1 + 1) = 0,\]so $a_1^3 + 1 = 0.$  Then $a_1^3 = -1,$ so $a_1^9 = (-1)^3 = \boxed{-1}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to solve this problem where a sequence is defined by the recurrence relation \( a_{i+1} = \frac{1}{1 - a_i} \) for \( i \geq 1 \), and it's given that \( a_3 = a_1 \). I have to compute \( (a_9)^9 \). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let's write down what's given. The sequence is defined such that each term is the reciprocal of one minus the previous term. So, \( a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{1 - a_n} \). That means each term depends on the previous one in a specific way.

Given that \( a_3 = a_1 \), so the third term is equal to the first term. So, maybe if I can find a pattern or a cycle in the sequence, I can figure out the relationship between \( a_1 \) and \( a_9 \).

Let me try to compute the first few terms in terms of \( a_1 \). Let's denote \( a_1 = x \) for simplicity. Then, \( a_2 \) can be expressed in terms of \( a_1 \), and so on.

Starting with \( a_1 = x \), so \( a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - x} \).

Then, \( a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} \). Substituting \( a_2 \), we get \( a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - x}} \). Let me simplify that.

First, let's compute the denominator: \( 1 - \frac{1}{1 - x} = \frac{(1 - x) - 1}{1 - x} = \frac{-x}{1 - x} \). So, \( a_3 = \frac{1}{\frac{-x}{1 - x}} = \frac{1 - x}{-x} = \frac{x - 1}{x} \).

Wait, so \( a_3 = \frac{x - 1}{x} \). But we are told that \( a_3 = a_1 = x \). So, setting \( a_3 = x \):

\( \frac{x - 1}{x} = x \).

Let me solve this equation for \( x \).

Multiply both sides by \( x \) to eliminate the denominator:

\( x - 1 = x^2 \).

Bring all terms to one side:

\( x^2 - x + 1 = 0 \).

Wait, is that correct? Let me check the steps.

Wait, original equation:

\( \frac{x - 1}{x} = x \).

Multiply both sides by \( x \):

\( x - 1 = x^2 \).

Yes, that's correct. So, \( x^2 - x + 1 = 0 \).

Wait, but that quadratic equation \( x^2 - x + 1 = 0 \) has discriminant \( D = (-1)^2 - 4*1*1 = 1 - 4 = -3 \), which is negative. So, it has no real solutions. Hmm, that seems problematic because we were probably dealing with real numbers here.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating \( a_3 \). Let me double-check my steps.

Starting with \( a_1 = x \),
then \( a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - x} \),
then \( a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - x}} \).

Simplify denominator:

\( 1 - \frac{1}{1 - x} = \frac{(1 - x) - 1}{1 - x} = \frac{-x}{1 - x} \).

So, \( a_3 = \frac{1}{\frac{-x}{1 - x}} = \frac{1 - x}{-x} = \frac{-(1 - x)}{x} = \frac{x - 1}{x} \).

Wait, that seems correct. So, \( a_3 = \frac{x - 1}{x} \). Then, set equal to \( a_1 = x \):

\( \frac{x - 1}{x} = x \).

Multiply both sides by \( x \):

\( x - 1 = x^2 \).

So, \( x^2 - x + 1 = 0 \).

But as I saw before, this equation has no real solutions. Hmm. Is this possible? Or, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Wait, is \( a_3 \) equal to \( a_1 \), or is it equal to \( a_{-1} \) or something else? No, it's given as \( a_3 = a_1 \).

Wait, is it possible that the sequence is periodic with period 2 or something? Or perhaps the cycle is longer? Let me try to compute more terms.

So, if \( a_3 = a_1 = x \), then \( a_4 = \frac{1}{1 - a_3} = \frac{1}{1 - x} = a_2 \). So, \( a_4 = a_2 \).

Then, \( a_5 = \frac{1}{1 - a_4} = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = a_3 = x \).

Similarly, \( a_6 = \frac{1}{1 - a_5} = a_4 = a_2 \).

\( a_7 = \frac{1}{1 - a_6} = a_5 = x \).

\( a_8 = \frac{1}{1 - a_7} = a_6 = a_2 \).

\( a_9 = \frac{1}{1 - a_8} = a_7 = x \).

So, the sequence alternates between \( a_1 = x \), \( a_2 \), \( a_3 = x \), \( a_4 = a_2 \), \( a_5 = x \), \( a_6 = a_2 \), etc.

So, every odd term is \( x \), every even term is \( a_2 \). Thus, \( a_1 = a_3 = a_5 = a_7 = a_9 = \dots = x \).

Therefore, \( a_9 = x \), so \( (a_9)^9 = x^9 \).

But we also have from earlier that \( a_3 = x = \frac{x - 1}{x} \), which led us to the equation \( x^2 - x + 1 = 0 \), which has no real solutions.

Wait, so does that mean that \( x \) is a complex number? The problem didn't specify whether it's real or complex. So, perhaps \( x \) is a complex number. Let me solve the equation \( x^2 - x + 1 = 0 \) in complex numbers.

Using the quadratic formula:

\( x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4*1*1}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

So, \( x \) is either \( \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) or \( \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

Therefore, \( a_9 = x \), so \( (a_9)^9 = x^9 \).

So, now, I need to compute \( x^9 \) where \( x = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

Hmm, that's a complex number. Let me note that \( \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) are the complex cube roots of unity. Specifically, they are primitive cube roots of unity because \( \omega^3 = 1 \), where \( \omega = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) and \( \omega^2 = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

So, \( x \) is either \( \omega \) or \( \omega^2 \). Let's take \( x = \omega \) first.

We know that \( \omega^3 = 1 \), so \( \omega^3 = 1 \). So, \( \omega^9 = (\omega^3)^3 = 1^3 = 1 \). Similarly, \( \omega^2 \) is also a primitive cube root, so \( (\omega^2)^3 = 1 \), and \( (\omega^2)^9 = 1 \).

Therefore, regardless of whether \( x \) is \( \omega \) or \( \omega^2 \), \( x^9 = 1 \).

Hence, \( (a_9)^9 = x^9 = 1 \).

Wait, but hold on, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.

Given that \( x^2 - x + 1 = 0 \), which can be rewritten as \( x^2 = x - 1 \). Let me see if I can find a pattern or a cycle for \( x^n \).

Since \( x^3 = 1 \), then \( x^n = x^{n \mod 3} \). So, for \( n = 9 \), \( 9 \mod 3 = 0 \), so \( x^9 = x^0 = 1 \). That's consistent.

Alternatively, using Euler's formula, \( \omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} \), so \( \omega^9 = e^{2\pi i * 3} = e^{6\pi i} = 1 \). Similarly, \( \omega^2 = e^{4\pi i / 3} \), so \( (\omega^2)^9 = e^{6\pi i * 2} = e^{12\pi i} = 1 \). So, yeah, same result.

Therefore, \( (a_9)^9 = 1 \).

Wait, but let me just check my initial assumption. I assumed \( a_3 = a_1 \) leads to \( a_9 = a_1 \), but is that necessarily the case?

Looking back at the sequence:

\( a_1 = x \),
\( a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - x} \),
\( a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \frac{1 - x}{x} \),
\( a_4 = \frac{1}{1 - a_3} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1 - x}{x}} = \frac{x}{x - (1 - x)} = \frac{x}{2x - 1} \),
Wait, hold on, this seems different. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, let me recast the computation of \( a_4 \).

Given \( a_3 = \frac{x - 1}{x} \), so \( 1 - a_3 = 1 - \frac{x - 1}{x} = \frac{x - (x - 1)}{x} = \frac{1}{x} \).

Therefore, \( a_4 = \frac{1}{1 - a_3} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}} = x \).

Ah! So, \( a_4 = x = a_1 \). Then, \( a_5 = \frac{1}{1 - a_4} = \frac{1}{1 - x} = a_2 \), and \( a_6 = \frac{1}{1 - a_5} = a_3 \), and so on.

So, the sequence is periodic with period 3: \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots \).

Therefore, \( a_{n} = a_{n \mod 3} \). So, for \( n = 1, 4, 7, 10, \dots \), \( a_n = a_1 \).

Hence, \( a_9 = a_{9 \mod 3} = a_0 \). Wait, hold on, 9 mod 3 is 0, but our sequence starts at \( a_1 \). Hmm, maybe I should adjust.

Wait, actually, if \( a_1 = x \), then \( a_4 = x = a_1 \), so the cycle repeats every 3 terms. So, term number 1, 4, 7, 10, etc., are equal to \( a_1 \).

Therefore, \( a_{3k + 1} = a_1 = x \).

So, \( a_9 \) is \( a_{3*3} = a_9 = a_{9} = a_1 = x \).

Therefore, \( (a_9)^9 = x^9 \).

Which, as I saw before, since \( x^3 = 1 \), \( x^9 = (x^3)^3 = 1^3 = 1 \).

Therefore, \( (a_9)^9 = 1 \).

Wait, so regardless of whether \( x \) is \( \omega \) or \( \omega^2 \), \( x^9 = 1 \). So, that's consistent.

But let me try another approach without using the cube roots of unity. Maybe using recurrence relations or matrix exponentiation.

Given the recurrence \( a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{1 - a_n} \), with \( a_1 = x \).

Let me compute a few terms:

- \( a_1 = x \)
- \( a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - x} \)
- \( a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - x}} = \frac{1 - x}{-x} = \frac{x - 1}{x} \)
- \( a_4 = \frac{1}{1 - a_3} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{x - 1}{x}} = \frac{1}{\frac{x - (x - 1)}{x}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}} = x \)
- So, it cycles every 3 terms.

Therefore, \( a_1 = a_4 = a_7 = a_{10} = \dots = x \)
Similarly, \( a_2 = a_5 = a_8 = \dots = a_{11} = \frac{1}{1 - x} \)
And \( a_3 = a_6 = a_9 = \dots = a_{12} = \frac{x - 1}{x} \)

Thus, \( a_9 = a_3 = \frac{x - 1}{x} \).

Wait, but earlier, I thought \( a_9 = a_1 \), but now it seems that \( a_9 = a_3 \). So, which is it?

Wait, let's compute \( a_9 \) directly.

Given that \( a_1 = x \),
\( a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - x} \),
\( a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \frac{1 - x}{-x} = \frac{x - 1}{x} \),
\( a_4 = \frac{1}{1 - a_3} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{x - 1}{x}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}} = x \),
\( a_5 = \frac{1}{1 - a_4} = \frac{1}{1 - x} = a_2 \),
\( a_6 = \frac{1}{1 - a_5} = a_3 \),
\( a_7 = \frac{1}{1 - a_6} = a_4 = x \),
\( a_8 = \frac{1}{1 - a_7} = a_5 = a_2 \),
\( a_9 = \frac{1}{1 - a_8} = a_6 = a_3 \).

So, \( a_9 = a_3 \).

Therefore, \( a_9 = \frac{x - 1}{x} \).

But earlier, I thought that \( a_9 = a_1 \), but it's actually \( a_9 = a_3 \). So, which one is correct?

Wait, let me check with the problem statement. It says \( a_3 = a_1 \), so in this case, \( a_3 = a_1 \). But according to the recurrence, \( a_3 = \frac{x - 1}{x} \), which equals \( a_1 = x \). So, \( x = \frac{x - 1}{x} \). Then, \( x^2 = x - 1 \), so \( x^2 - x + 1 = 0 \).

So, \( x \) is either \( \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) or \( \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

Therefore, \( a_9 = a_3 = \frac{x - 1}{x} \).

Wait, so I had a conflict earlier. So, if \( a_3 = a_1 \), but \( a_9 = a_3 \), then \( a_9 = a_1 \). But in the calculation above, \( a_9 \) is not equal to \( a_1 \), but rather \( a_9 = a_3 \).

Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me see:

Given \( a_1 = x \), and \( a_3 = \frac{x - 1}{x} \). If \( a_3 = a_1 \), then \( \frac{x - 1}{x} = x \), which gives \( x^2 - x + 1 = 0 \). So, \( a_3 = a_1 \) is consistent with that.

But then, if \( a_3 = a_1 \), then \( a_4 = a_2 \), \( a_5 = a_3 = a_1 \), \( a_6 = a_4 = a_2 \), \( a_7 = a_5 = a_1 \), etc.

Hence, the cycle is \( a_1, a_2, a_1, a_2, a_1, a_2, \dots \). So, every odd term is \( a_1 \), and every even term is \( a_2 \).

Therefore, \( a_9 \) is an odd index, so \( a_9 = a_1 \).

But earlier, when I computed \( a_9 = \frac{x - 1}{x} \), which is \( a_3 \), so that seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps my mistake came from conflating \( a_9 \) with \( a_3 \). Let's see:

If \( a_3 = a_1 \), as given, then \( a_9 \) is 8 steps later, so starting from \( a_1 \), \( a_2 \), \( a_3 \), \( a_4 \), \( a_5 \), \( a_6 \), \( a_7 \), \( a_8 \), \( a_9 \). So, 8 steps.

But since the cycle is every 3 terms, starting from \( a_1 \):

- \( a_1 \)
- \( a_2 \)
- \( a_3 \)
- \( a_4 = a_1 \)
- \( a_5 = a_2 \)
- \( a_6 = a_3 \)
- \( a_7 = a_1 \)
- \( a_8 = a_2 \)
- \( a_9 = a_3 \)

Therefore, \( a_9 = a_3 \).

But \( a_3 = a_1 \), so \( a_9 = a_1 \).

But earlier, when I computed \( a_9 = \frac{x - 1}{x} \), which is \( a_3 \), that was incorrect if \( a_3 = a_1 \).

Therefore, perhaps the correct conclusion is that \( a_9 = a_1 \), which is \( x \).

Wait, but then, if \( a_9 = a_1 \), then \( (a_9)^9 = x^9 \). But \( x^3 = 1 \), so \( x^9 = (x^3)^3 = 1 \).

So, regardless of the value of \( x \), \( (a_9)^9 = 1 \).

But wait, earlier, I thought that \( a_9 = a_3 \). So, actually, \( a_9 = a_3 \), which is \( a_1 \), so \( a_9 = x \). Thus, \( x^9 = 1 \).

Therefore, the answer is 1.

Wait, so why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought \( a_9 = a_3 \), but actually, considering the period of 3, starting from \( a_1 \), \( a_9 \) is 3 steps ahead, so it's \( a_3 \), which is equal to \( a_1 \).

Therefore, \( a_9 = a_1 \), so \( (a_9)^9 = (a_1)^9 = x^9 = 1 \).

Alternatively, since the sequence cycles every 3 terms, after every 3 terms, it repeats. So, term number \( 1 + 3k \) is equal to \( a_1 \).

Therefore, \( a_9 = a_{1 + 6} = a_1 \).

Hence, \( (a_9)^9 = (a_1)^9 = x^9 = 1 \).

Therefore, regardless of the value of \( x \), as long as \( x^3 = 1 \), \( x^9 = 1 \).

Hence, the answer is 1.

Wait, just to be thorough, let me check with the actual value of \( x \). Let me compute \( x^9 \) for \( x = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

First, note that \( x = e^{2\pi i / 3} \), so \( x^3 = 1 \). Therefore, \( x^9 = (x^3)^3 = 1^3 = 1 \).

Similarly, \( x^6 = (x^3)^2 = 1^2 = 1 \), and \( x^9 = x^{6 + 3} = x^6 * x^3 = 1 * 1 = 1 \).

So, yes, \( x^9 = 1 \).

Therefore, \( (a_9)^9 = 1 \).

So, after carefully going through the problem, considering the recurrence relation and the periodicity of the sequence, I conclude that \( (a_9)^9 = 1 \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
</think>

Given the sequence \((a_n)\) defined by the recurrence relation \(a_{i+1} = \frac{1}{1 - a_i}\) for \(i \ge 1\), and knowing that \(a_3 = a_1\), we need to compute \((a_9)^9\).

First, we express the terms of the sequence in terms of \(a_1\). Let \(a_1 = x\). Then,

\[
\begin{align*}
a_2 &= \frac{1}{1 - x}, \\
a_3 &= \frac{1}{1 - a_2} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - x}} = \frac{x - 1}{x}, \\
a_4 &= \frac{1}{1 - a_3} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{x - 1}{x}} = x.
\end{align*}
\]

We observe that \(a_4 = a_1\), indicating that the sequence is periodic with a period of 3. Therefore, the sequence alternates between \(a_1\), \(a_2\), and \(a_3\).

Given \(a_3 = a_1\), we conclude that \(a_9\) is part of this periodic sequence. Specifically, every term of the form \(a_{3k + 1}\) is equal to \(a_1\). Thus, \(a_9 = a_3 = a_1\).

Since \(a_1 = x\), we need to compute \(x^9\). Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - x + 1 = 0\), the roots are the complex cube roots of unity, \(\omega = \frac{1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and \(\omega^2 = \frac{1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}\). These roots satisfy \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \((\omega^2)^3 = 1\).

Thus, \(x^9 = (\omega^3)^3 = 1^3 = 1\). Therefore, \((a_9)^9 = 1\).

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
