Question:
Let $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ be distinct real numbers.  Find the degree of the polynomial
\[p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}.\]

Correct Answer:
Note that $p(x)$ has degree at most 2.  Also, $p(a) = p(b) = p(c) = 1.$  Thus, the polynomials $p(x)$ and 1 agree at three different values, so by the Identity Theorem, they are the same polynomial.  Hence, the degree of $p(x)$ (which is the constant polynomial 1) is $\boxed{0}.$

You can check manually that
\[p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}\]simplifies to 1.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the degree of a polynomial \( p(x) \) given by the expression:

\[
p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}
\]

where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are distinct real numbers. Hmm, okay. So, the question is about the degree of this polynomial. I know that the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of \( x \) with a non-zero coefficient. So, my task is to figure out what the highest power of \( x \) is in \( p(x) \), and that will be the degree.

First, let me try to understand what this polynomial \( p(x) \) is. It's given as a sum of three fractions. Each fraction has a numerator that's a quadratic expression and a denominator that's a product of differences of the variables. Since \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are distinct, none of the denominators will be zero, so each term is defined.

I wonder if there's a way to simplify this expression or recognize a pattern. Maybe it's related to Lagrange interpolation? I remember that Lagrange polynomials pass through given points, and their general form is a sum of terms that are 1 at one point and 0 at the others. Let me recall the Lagrange interpolation formula.

The Lagrange interpolation polynomial for three points \( (a, f(a)) \), \( (b, f(b)) \), \( (c, f(c)) \) is:

\[
p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} f(a) + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} f(b) + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} f(c)
\]

Comparing that with the given \( p(x) \), it looks exactly like the Lagrange interpolation polynomial for the function \( f(x) = x \), since each term is \( f(x) \) evaluated at \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) respectively. So, \( f(a) = a \), \( f(b) = b \), and \( f(c) = c \). Therefore, \( p(x) \) is the Lagrange interpolation polynomial of degree 2 for the function \( f(x) = x \).

Wait, that makes sense because if we have three points, the Lagrange polynomial is of degree at most 2. Since our function \( f(x) = x \) is a linear function, the Lagrange polynomial will pass through those points and will be exactly degree 2. So, that would mean that \( p(x) \) is a quadratic polynomial, and hence its degree is 2.

But just to be thorough, maybe I should verify this by expanding the expression. Let me try that.

So, let's denote:

\[
p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}
\]

I need to expand each term and see what the resulting polynomial looks like. Let me expand each numerator and denominator step by step.

First, consider the first term:

\[
\frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} = \frac{x^2 - (b + c)x + bc}{(a - b)(a - c)}
\]

Similarly, the second term:

\[
\frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} = \frac{x^2 - (a + c)x + ac}{(b - a)(b - c)}
\]

And the third term:

\[
\frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = \frac{x^2 - (a + b)x + ab}{(c - a)(c - b)}
\]

So, each of these terms is a quadratic, and the entire expression is a sum of three quadratics.

Now, let's think about the denominators. The denominators are products of differences. Let me note that some denominators are negative of each other. For example, \( (a - b)(a - c) = (b - a)(c - a) \), but I should be careful with the signs because if I factor out a negative, it will affect the numerator.

Wait, maybe instead of computing each term separately, I can add them together. Let me try to add the first two terms first, and then add the third.

So, let's compute:

First two terms:

\[
\frac{(x^2 - (b + c)x + bc)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x^2 - (a + c)x + ac)}{(b - a)(b - c)}
\]

Note that \( (b - a) = -(a - b) \) and \( (b - c) = -(c - b) \). Therefore, the second denominator can be written as \( (b - a)(b - c) = (-1)^2 (a - b)(c - b) = (a - b)(c - b) \). Similarly, the third denominator is \( (c - a)(c - b) = (-1)^2 (a - c)(b - c) = (a - c)(b - c) \). Wait, actually, perhaps it's better to factor out the negatives.

Wait, actually, let's compute the first two denominators:

Denominator of first term: \( (a - b)(a - c) \)

Denominator of second term: \( (b - a)(b - c) \) which is \( (-1)(a - b) \times (-1)(c - b) = (a - b)(c - b) \)

So, denominator of second term is \( (a - b)(c - b) \)

Similarly, denominator of third term is \( (c - a)(c - b) \) which is \( (-1)(a - c) \times (c - b) = (a - c)(c - b) \) since \( (c - b) = -(b - c) \). So, overall, denominator is \( (a - c)(c - b) \) which is \( (c - b)(a - c) \)

So, to make it clearer, let me denote:

First denominator: \( D1 = (a - b)(a - c) \)

Second denominator: \( D2 = (b - a)(b - c) = (-1)(a - b)(-1)(c - b) = (a - b)(c - b) \)

Third denominator: \( D3 = (c - a)(c - b) = (-1)(a - c)(-1)(b - c) = (a - c)(b - c) \)

Wait, perhaps it's getting too convoluted. Maybe instead of looking at the denominators, I can combine the first two terms and see if the denominators can be related.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to bring all terms to a common denominator and then combine them. The common denominator would be \( (a - b)(a - c)(b - c) \). Let me try that.

So, the first term is over \( (a - b)(a - c) \), so to get the common denominator, I need to multiply numerator and denominator by \( (b - c) \):

\[
\frac{(x - b)(x - c)(b - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)(b - c)}
\]

Similarly, the second term is over \( (b - a)(b - c) \), so multiply numerator and denominator by \( (a - c) \):

\[
\frac{(x - a)(x - c)(a - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)(a - c)}
\]

And the third term is over \( (c - a)(c - b) \), which is \( (c - a)(c - b) \). So, multiply numerator and denominator by \( (a - b) \):

\[
\frac{(x - a)(x - b)(a - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)(a - b)}
\]

So now, all three terms have the same denominator \( (a - b)(a - c)(b - c) \). So, adding the numerators together, we get:

\[
\frac{(x - b)(x - c)(b - c) + (x - a)(x - c)(a - c) + (x - a)(x - b)(a - b)}{(a - b)(a - c)(b - c)}
\]

So, now the numerator is the sum of three terms:

1. \( (x - b)(x - c)(b - c) \)
2. \( (x - a)(x - c)(a - c) \)
3. \( (x - a)(x - b)(a - b) \)

So, let's compute each term:

First term: \( (x - b)(x - c)(b - c) \)

Let me expand \( (x - b)(x - c) \):

\( x^2 - (b + c)x + bc \). Then multiply by \( (b - c) \):

\( (x^2 - (b + c)x + bc)(b - c) = x^2(b - c) - (b + c)x(b - c) + bc(b - c) \)

Which simplifies to:

\( (b - c)x^2 - (b + c)(b - c)x + bc(b - c) \)

Similarly, second term: \( (x - a)(x - c)(a - c) \)

First, expand \( (x - a)(x - c) \):

\( x^2 - (a + c)x + ac \)

Multiply by \( (a - c) \):

\( (x^2 - (a + c)x + ac)(a - c) = x^2(a - c) - (a + c)x(a - c) + ac(a - c) \)

Simplify:

\( (a - c)x^2 - (a + c)(a - c)x + ac(a - c) \)

Third term: \( (x - a)(x - b)(a - b) \)

First, expand \( (x - a)(x - b) \):

\( x^2 - (a + b)x + ab \)

Multiply by \( (a - b) \):

\( (x^2 - (a + b)x + ab)(a - b) = x^2(a - b) - (a + b)x(a - b) + ab(a - b) \)

Simplify:

\( (a - b)x^2 - (a + b)(a - b)x + ab(a - b) \)

So, now, let's write all three terms:

1. \( (b - c)x^2 - (b + c)(b - c)x + bc(b - c) \)
2. \( (a - c)x^2 - (a + c)(a - c)x + ac(a - c) \)
3. \( (a - b)x^2 - (a + b)(a - b)x + ab(a - b) \)

Now, let's add them together:

First, let's collect like terms. Let's group the \( x^2 \) terms, the \( x \) terms, and the constant terms.

1. Coefficient of \( x^2 \):
   - From first term: \( b - c \)
   - From second term: \( a - c \)
   - From third term: \( a - b \)
   So total: \( (b - c) + (a - c) + (a - b) \)

Let me compute this:
\( b - c + a - c + a - b = (a + a) + (b - b) + (-c - c) = 2a + 0 - 2c = 2(a - c) \)

2. Coefficient of \( x \):
   - From first term: \( - (b + c)(b - c) = - [ b^2 - c^2 ] = -b^2 + c^2 \)
   - From second term: \( - (a + c)(a - c) = - [ a^2 - c^2 ] = -a^2 + c^2 \)
   - From third term: \( - (a + b)(a - b) = - [ a^2 - b^2 ] = -a^2 + b^2 \)
   So total:
   \( (-b^2 + c^2) + (-a^2 + c^2) + (-a^2 + b^2) \)
   Let's compute term by term:
   - \( -b^2 + c^2 - a^2 + c^2 - a^2 + b^2 \)
   Rearranged:
   \( (-b^2 + b^2) + (-a^2 - a^2) + (c^2 + c^2) = 0 - 2a^2 + 2c^2 = 2(c^2 - a^2) \)

3. Constant terms:
   - From first term: \( bc(b - c) \)
   - From second term: \( ac(a - c) \)
   - From third term: \( ab(a - b) \)
   So total constant term:
   \( bc(b - c) + ac(a - c) + ab(a - b) \)

Let me compute this:

First, expand each term:

1. \( bc(b - c) = b^2c - bc^2 \)
2. \( ac(a - c) = a^2c - ac^2 \)
3. \( ab(a - b) = a^2b - ab^2 \)

So, adding them together:

\( (b^2c - bc^2) + (a^2c - ac^2) + (a^2b - ab^2) \)

Let me rearrange terms:

\( a^2c + a^2b + b^2c - ac^2 - bc^2 - ab^2 \)

Factor where possible:

Looking at the first three terms: \( a^2(c + b) + b^2c \)

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, group terms:

Group the terms with \( a^2 \):
\( a^2(c + b) \)

Group the terms with \( b^2 \):
\( b^2c \)

Group the terms with \( c^2 \):
\( -ac^2 - bc^2 = -c^2(a + b) \)

Group the terms with \( ab^2 \):
\( -ab^2 \)

Wait, maybe it's better to see if we can factor this expression differently.

Alternatively, factor terms with similar variables:

Let me write the entire expression:

\( a^2b + a^2c + b^2c - ab^2 - ac^2 - bc^2 \)

Now, let's see if we can factor this. Hmm.

Let me factor by grouping:

Group the first two terms and the last three terms:

\( (a^2b + a^2c) + (b^2c - ab^2) + (-ac^2 - bc^2) \)

Factor:

\( a^2(b + c) + b^2(c - a) - c^2(a + b) \)

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let me factor terms with \( a \), \( b \), \( c \):

Looking for common factors:

- \( a^2b + a^2c = a^2(b + c) \)
- \( b^2c - ab^2 = b^2(c - a) \)
- \( -ac^2 - bc^2 = -c^2(a + b) \)

So, expression becomes:

\( a^2(b + c) + b^2(c - a) - c^2(a + b) \)

Hmm, still not obvious. Maybe I should compute it step by step.

Compute \( a^2b + a^2c + b^2c - ab^2 - ac^2 - bc^2 \):

Let me write all terms:

- \( a^2b \)
- \( a^2c \)
- \( b^2c \)
- \( -ab^2 \)
- \( -ac^2 \)
- \( -bc^2 \)

Now, group terms with similar variables:

Group terms with \( a^2 \):
\( a^2b + a^2c = a^2(b + c) \)

Group terms with \( b^2 \):
\( b^2c - ab^2 = b^2(c - a) \)

Group terms with \( c^2 \):
\( -ac^2 - bc^2 = -c^2(a + b) \)

So, the expression is:

\( a^2(b + c) + b^2(c - a) - c^2(a + b) \)

Hmm, maybe factor further. Let me see if I can factor \( (a + b) \) or \( (b + c) \) or something.

Alternatively, let me factor out \( (a + b + c) \) or something? Maybe not.

Wait, perhaps think in terms of symmetric functions.

Alternatively, maybe try to factor each group:

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute numerically. Let me assign specific values to a, b, c to compute the constant term.

Wait, but since a, b, c are arbitrary distinct real numbers, this expression needs to hold for any a, b, c. So, perhaps, if I can factor the entire expression, it might lead to something.

Alternatively, perhaps this expression can be written as \( (a - b)(b - c)(c - a)(something) \), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe think of the entire numerator as a polynomial in x, and find its degree.

Wait, the numerator is:

\( 2(a - c)x^2 + 2(c^2 - a^2)x + [a^2b + a^2c + b^2c - ab^2 - ac^2 - bc^2] \)

But in any case, let's see:

So, the numerator is a quadratic in x, as expected, since p(x) is a quadratic polynomial.

But let me think about the leading coefficient: the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is \( 2(a - c) \), which is non-zero because a, c are distinct. Therefore, the leading term is \( 2(a - c)x^2 \). So, the polynomial p(x) is quadratic, hence degree 2.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is \( 2(a - c) \), which is non-zero as a and c are distinct. Therefore, the polynomial has degree 2.

But just to make sure, let me think if it's possible that the numerator could have a higher degree. But since each of the terms after expansion is quadratic, adding three quadratics would still give a quadratic. So, the numerator is quadratic, and the denominator is cubic, so the overall expression is quadratic divided by cubic, which is a quadratic polynomial. So, degree 2.

Wait, but hold on, I have:

Numerator is quadratic, denominator is cubic, so the overall expression is a quadratic polynomial? Wait, no. Wait, p(x) is the sum of three rational functions, each of which is quadratic over linear, so each term is degree 1. So, when we sum them, the numerator is quadratic, so p(x) is quadratic.

Wait, actually, if I consider p(x) as a polynomial, then the numerator must be a multiple of the denominator, otherwise, it's a proper rational function. But in this case, when I expanded, I saw that the numerator is quadratic, denominator is cubic, so the rational function is of the form quadratic over cubic, which is of degree 2.

But wait, in the initial expression, p(x) is equal to the sum of three quadratic terms divided by linear terms, so when we add them together, the numerator is quadratic, as each term is quadratic, but adding three quadratics could give a quadratic with higher degree? Wait, no, each term is quadratic in numerator, so when adding three quadratics, the numerator remains quadratic. So, the entire expression p(x) is quadratic, hence degree 2.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me think if I can have a higher degree. For example, if I had a higher degree numerator, but in this case, the numerator is quadratic, so the degree of the polynomial is 2.

Alternatively, maybe if I consider the original Lagrange interpolation formula, since we have three points, the polynomial should be degree 2.

Therefore, I think I can confidently say that the degree of p(x) is 2.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2}
</think>

Given the polynomial \( p(x) \):

\[
p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}
\]

where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are distinct real numbers, we recognize that this polynomial is a Lagrange interpolation polynomial of degree 2. The Lagrange interpolation polynomial for three points \( (a, f(a)) \), \( (b, f(b)) \), and \( (c, f(c)) \) is a quadratic polynomial.

To verify, we consider the general form of the Lagrange interpolation polynomial for three points:

\[
p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} f(a) + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} f(b) + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} f(c)
\]

In this case, \( f(a) = a \), \( f(b) = b \), and \( f(c) = c \). Thus, \( p(x) \) is a quadratic polynomial because it is the Lagrange interpolation polynomial for the function \( f(x) = x \) evaluated at three distinct points.

Therefore, the degree of the polynomial \( p(x) \) is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
