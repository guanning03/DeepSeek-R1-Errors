Question:
The data in the table below shows the percent of bus riders in a survey of Central H.S. students; 300 males and 300 females in each grade were surveyed. For which grade is the number of its male bus riders closest to $135\%$ of the number of its female bus riders? \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\hline
Grade & Males & Females \\ \hline
$9^{\mathrm{th}}$ grade & $41.1\%$ & $39.4\%$ \\ \hline
$10^{\mathrm{th}}$ grade & $34.4\%$ & $33.1\%$ \\ \hline
$11^{\mathrm{th}}$ grade & $20.6\%$ & $13.8\%$ \\ \hline
$12^{\mathrm{th}}$ grade & $11.6\%$ & $8.6\%$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

Correct Answer:
The grade level in which the number of male bus riders is closest to $135\%$ of the number of female bus riders is the same grade level in which the percentage of male bus riders is closest to $135\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders. To find what percentage is $135\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders, we multiply each percentage by $1.35.$ In ninth grade, the percentage is $39.4\cdot1.35=53.19$ percent. In tenth grade, the percentage is $33.1\cdot1.35=44.685$ percent. In eleventh grade, the percentage is $13.8\cdot1.35=18.63$ percent. In twelfth grade, the percentage is $8.6\cdot1.35=11.61$ percent. From inspection, we see that $135\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders in twelfth grade is closest to the percentage of male bus riders in twelfth grade. So the answer is $\boxed{12}.$

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the table shows the percentage of male and female bus riders in each grade. There are four grades: 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th. For each grade, they surveyed 300 males and 300 females. 

So, for each grade, I can calculate the number of male bus riders and the number of female bus riders. Since there were 300 males and 300 females in each grade, I can find the actual numbers by taking the percentages and multiplying them by 300.

Let me write down the percentages again to make sure I have them right:

- 9th grade: 41.1% males, 39.4% females.
- 10th grade: 34.4% males, 33.1% females.
- 11th grade: 20.6% males, 13.8% females.
- 12th grade: 11.6% males, 8.6% females.

Okay, so for each grade, I need to calculate the number of male riders and female riders. Since each grade has 300 males and 300 females, let me compute these numbers.

Starting with the 9th grade:

Male riders: 41.1% of 300 = 0.411 * 300 = let me compute that. 0.411 * 300. Well, 0.4 * 300 is 120, and 0.011 * 300 is 3.3, so adding those together gives 123.3. So, 123.3 male riders.

Female riders: 39.4% of 300 = 0.394 * 300. Let me calculate that. 0.3 * 300 is 90, and 0.094 * 300 is approximately 28.2. Adding those gives 90 + 28.2 = 118.2. So, 118.2 female riders.

Now, I need to find out if the number of male riders is closest to 135% of the number of female riders. So, let's compute 135% of 118.2. 135% is the same as 1.35, so 1.35 * 118.2.

Let me compute that. 1 * 118.2 is 118.2, and 0.35 * 118.2. Hmm, 0.3 * 118.2 is 35.46, and 0.05 * 118.2 is 5.91. Adding those together gives 35.46 + 5.91 = 41.37. So, 0.35 * 118.2 is 41.37. Therefore, 1.35 * 118.2 is 118.2 + 41.37 = 159.57. So, 135% of 118.2 is approximately 159.57.

Now, let's compare the number of male riders (123.3) to this value. 123.3 is less than 159.57. So, for 9th grade, the male riders are about 123.3, and the 135% of female riders is about 159.57. The difference between them is 159.57 - 123.3 = 36.27. So, the male riders are about 36.27 less than 135% of the female riders. Hmm, that's a significant difference.

Moving on to the 10th grade. Let's compute the number of male and female riders.

Male riders: 34.4% of 300 = 0.344 * 300. Let's calculate that. 0.3 * 300 is 90, and 0.044 * 300 is 13.2. So, 90 + 13.2 = 103.2 male riders.

Female riders: 33.1% of 300 = 0.331 * 300. That's 0.3 * 300 = 90 and 0.031 * 300 = 9.3. So, adding those gives 90 + 9.3 = 99.3 female riders.

Again, 135% of 99.3 is 1.35 * 99.3. Let me compute that. 1 * 99.3 is 99.3, 0.35 * 99.3 is approximately 34.755. So, 99.3 + 34.755 is 134.055. So, 135% of 99.3 is approximately 134.055.

Now, the male riders are 103.2, so 103.2 compared to 134.055. The difference is 134.055 - 103.2 = 30.855. So, the male riders are about 30.855 less than 135% of the female riders. That's still a larger difference than the 9th grade, but let's check the other grades.

Moving on to the 11th grade. Let's calculate the numbers.

Male riders: 20.6% of 300 = 0.206 * 300. That's 0.2 * 300 = 60, and 0.006 * 300 = 1.8. So, 60 + 1.8 = 61.8 male riders.

Female riders: 13.8% of 300 = 0.138 * 300. 0.1 * 300 is 30, and 0.038 * 300 is 11.4. So, 30 + 11.4 = 41.4 female riders.

Now, compute 135% of 41.4. That's 1.35 * 41.4. Let's break that down. 1 * 41.4 is 41.4, and 0.35 * 41.4. 0.3 * 41.4 is 12.42, and 0.05 * 41.4 is 2.07. Adding those together gives 12.42 + 2.07 = 14.49. So, 0.35 * 41.4 is 14.49. Therefore, 1.35 * 41.4 is 41.4 + 14.49 = 55.89.

So, 135% of the female riders is 55.89. The male riders are 61.8. The difference is 61.8 - 55.89 = 5.91. This is a smaller difference compared to the previous grades.

Wait, hold on. So, 11th grade, male riders are 61.8, female riders are 41.4. 135% of female riders is 55.89. So, 61.8 - 55.89 is 5.91. That's quite close. So, the male riders are about 5.91 less than 135% of the female riders.

Wait, but is 5.91 less or more? Wait, 61.8 is more than 55.89, so 61.8 - 55.89 is positive, meaning the male riders are 5.91 more than 135% of the female riders. So, the male riders are not close to 135% of the female riders for 11th grade.

Wait, hold on, maybe I need to check the question again. It says, "for which grade is the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders?" So, 135% is more than 100%, so it's a multiplier greater than the number of female riders. So, if male riders are equal to or more than 135% of female riders, that would be higher, but if male riders are less, then it's lower.

Wait, but in the case of 9th grade, male riders are 123.3, and 135% of female riders is 159.57. So, male riders are less than 135% of female riders. For 10th grade, male riders are 103.2, and 135% of female riders is 134.055, so male riders are less than 135% of female riders. For 11th grade, male riders are 61.8, which is more than 55.89, so 11th grade, male riders are more than 135% of female riders. So, 11th grade, male riders are more than 135% of female riders.

Wait, so 11th grade, male riders are 61.8, female riders are 41.4. 135% of 41.4 is 55.89. So, 61.8 is greater than 55.89. So, is 11th grade closer to 135% of female riders? It's actually 55.89, and male riders are 61.8. The difference is |61.8 - 55.89| = 5.91. 

But for 9th grade, male riders are 123.3, 135% of female riders is 159.57. So, the difference is 159.57 - 123.3 = 36.27. For 10th grade, the difference is 134.055 - 103.2 = 30.855. So, 11th grade is closer with a difference of 5.91.

Wait, but 5.91 is less than 30.855 and 36.27. So, 11th grade is the closest. So, that's the answer.

But let me double-check my calculations to be sure because math can be tricky.

Starting with 11th grade:

Male riders: 20.6% of 300. 20.6 * 300. Hmm, 20% is 60, 0.6% is 1.8, so 60 + 1.8 is 61.8. Correct.

Female riders: 13.8% of 300. 10% is 30, 3% is 9, 0.8% is 2.4. So, 30 + 9 + 2.4 = 41.4. Correct.

135% of 41.4: 135% is 1.35. 1.35 * 41.4. Let's compute 41.4 * 1.35.

Compute 41.4 * 1 = 41.4

Compute 41.4 * 0.3 = 12.42

Compute 41.4 * 0.05 = 2.07

Add them all together: 41.4 + 12.42 = 53.82; 53.82 + 2.07 = 55.89.

So, yes, that's correct. 135% of 41.4 is 55.89. So, male riders are 61.8.

Difference: 61.8 - 55.89 = 5.91. So, that's about 5.91.

For 12th grade:

Male riders: 8.6% of 300. 8% is 24, 0.6% is 1.8. So, 24 + 1.8 = 25.8.

Female riders: 11.6% of 300. 10% is 30, 1.6% is 4.8. So, 30 + 4.8 = 34.8.

135% of 34.8: 1.35 * 34.8. Let's compute that.

34.8 * 1 = 34.8

34.8 * 0.3 = 10.44

34.8 * 0.05 = 1.74

So, 34.8 + 10.44 = 45.24; 45.24 + 1.74 = 46.98.

So, 135% of 34.8 is 46.98.

Male riders are 25.8. So, the difference is 46.98 - 25.8 = 21.18. So, 21.18 difference. That's larger than the 5.91 in 11th grade.

So, 11th grade is the closest.

But let me verify 11th grade again. Sometimes, I make calculation errors.

Male riders: 20.6% of 300 is indeed 61.8.

Female riders: 13.8% of 300 is 41.4.

135% of 41.4 is 55.89.

Difference: 61.8 - 55.89 is 5.91.

Is 5.91 less than the differences for 9th and 10th grades?

For 9th grade, difference is 36.27.

For 10th grade, 30.855.

So, 5.91 is less than 30.855 and 36.27. So, 11th grade is closer.

Therefore, the answer is 11th grade.

Wait, hold on. But wait, the question says "closest to 135% of the number of its female riders." So, if male riders are 61.8, which is 55.89 + 5.91, so 5.91 more than 135% of female riders. So, 11th grade is closer than 9th and 10th.

But just to make sure, let me think if maybe I interpreted 135% correctly. So, 135% is 1.35 times. So, if the male riders are equal to 1.35 times female riders, they are equal. If male riders are more than that, they are more.

So, 11th grade: 61.8 vs. 1.35 * 41.4 = 55.89. So, 61.8 is more, so 11th grade is more than 135%, which is closer? Wait, actually, no. The question is asking which grade is the number of male riders closest to 135% of female riders. So, 11th grade is above 135%, but for 10th grade, male riders are 103.2, which is below 135%, but the difference is 30.855, while for 11th grade, the difference is only 5.91. So, 11th grade is closer.

So, yes, 11th grade is the answer.

But, wait, could I have messed up the percentages? Let me double-check the percentages given.

In the table, for 11th grade, males are 20.6%, females 13.8%. For 10th grade, males 34.4%, females 33.1%. For 9th grade, males 41.1%, females 39.4%. For 12th grade, males 11.6%, females 8.6%.

Wait, so 11th grade is below 135%, but closer than 10th grade.

Wait, but 135% is a pretty high percentage, so is 11th grade, it's 13.8%, but 13.8% is moderate. Wait, 135% is 1.35 times, so if the female riders are, say, 100, male riders would need to be 135. But in 11th grade, female riders are 41.4, so 135% of that is 55.89. So, male riders are 61.8, which is 5.91 more than that.

So, 11th grade is closest.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the exact percentage for each grade and see how close they are to 135%. Wait, that might complicate, but let me try.

For each grade, compute (male riders / female riders) * 100, and see how close it is to 135%.

So, for 9th grade: (123.3 / 99.3) * 100 ≈ (1.242) * 100 ≈ 124.2%

For 10th grade: (103.2 / 99.3) * 100 ≈ (1.039) * 100 ≈ 103.9%

For 11th grade: (61.8 / 41.4) * 100 ≈ 1.494 * 100 ≈ 149.4%

For 12th grade: (25.8 / 34.8) * 100 ≈ (0.7447) * 100 ≈ 74.47%

So, 9th grade is 124.2%, 10th is 103.9%, 11th is 149.4%, 12th is 74.47%. 

135% is in between 103.9% and 149.4%. So, 10th grade is below 135%, and 11th grade is above 135%. The question is which is closer. 103.9% is 135 - 103.9 = 31.1% away. 149.4% is 149.4 - 135 = 14.4% away. So, 11th grade is closer.

Therefore, 11th grade is the answer.

So, I think that's solid. 11th grade is the one where male riders are closest to 135% of female riders.

**Final Answer**
The number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders for the \boxed{11^{\mathrm{th}}} grade.
</think>

To determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders, we need to calculate the percentage of male and female bus riders for each grade and then compare them to 135% of the female riders.

The table provides the following percentages for each grade:
- 9th grade: 41.1% males, 39.4% females
- 10th grade: 34.4% males, 33.1% females
- 11th grade: 20.6% males, 13.8% females
- 12th grade: 11.6% males, 8.6% females

We calculate the number of male and female bus riders for each grade by taking the respective percentages and multiplying by 300 (since there are 300 males and 300 females in each grade).

### Calculations:
1. **9th grade:**
   - Male riders: \( 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3 \)
   - Female riders: \( 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2 \)
   - 135% of female riders: \( 1.35 \times 118.2 = 159.57 \)
   - Difference: \( 159.57 - 123.3 = 36.27 \)

2. **10th grade:**
   - Male riders: \( 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2 \)
   - Female riders: \( 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3 \)
   - 135% of female riders: \( 1.35 \times 99.3 = 134.055 \)
   - Difference: \( 134.055 - 103.2 = 30.855 \)

3. **11th grade:**
   - Male riders: \( 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8 \)
   - Female riders: \( 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4 \)
   - 135% of female riders: \( 1.35 \times 41.4 = 55.89 \)
   - Difference: \( 61.8 - 55.89 = 5.91 \)

4. **12th grade:**
   - Male riders: \( 0.116 \times 300 = 25.8 \)
   - Female riders: \( 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8 \)
   - 135% of female riders: \( 1.35 \times 25.8 = 34.98 \)
   - Difference: \( 34.98 - 25.8 = 9.18 \)

### Conclusion:
The number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders for the 11th grade, as the difference of 5.91 is the smallest compared to the other grades.
