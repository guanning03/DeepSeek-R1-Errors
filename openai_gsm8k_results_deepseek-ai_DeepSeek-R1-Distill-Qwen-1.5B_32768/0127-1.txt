Question:
George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. Heâ€™s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?

Correct Answer:
The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.

300

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the total cost of the dental work. George needs 2 implants, each costing $2000, so that's $4000. Additionally, one implant has a crown costing $500, adding another $500. This gives a subtotal of $4500. There's also a deposit of $600, so the total amount George needs to pay is $4500 plus $600, which totals $5100.

Next, George has already made a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work, so his remaining amount needed is $5100 minus $600, which equals $4500.

Finally, to determine how many hours he needs to work to cover the remaining $4500 at a rate of $15 per hour, I'll divide $4500 by $15. This calculation results in 300 hours.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work.

1. **Calculate the Total Cost of dental Work:**
   
   - ** implants:** George needs 2 implants.
     \[
     2 \text{ implants} \times \$2000 \text{ per implant} = \$4000
     \]
   
   - **Crown:** One of the implants has a crown costing an additional \$500.
     \[
     \$500
     \]
   
   - **Deposit:** George has already made a deposit of \$600.
   
   **Total Cost:**
   \[
   \$4000 + \$500 + \$600 = \$5100
   \]

2. **Determine the Remaining Amount Needed:**
   
   George has already deposited \$600, so the remaining amount he needs to cover is:
   \[
   \$5100 - \$600 = \$4500
   \]

3. **Calculate the Hours Required to Work:**
   
   George makes \$15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn \$4500:
   \[
   \text{Hours} = \frac{\$4500}{\$15/\text{hour}} = 300 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

George needs to work for \boxed{300} hours.
