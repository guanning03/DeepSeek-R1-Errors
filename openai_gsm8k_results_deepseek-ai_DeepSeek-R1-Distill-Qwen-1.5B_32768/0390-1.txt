Question:
In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep. In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. If she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, how many pages did she read in two weeks?

Correct Answer:
Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.
So, she read 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pages every night in the first week.
In the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.
Therefore, she read a total of 140 + 100 = <<140+100=240>>240 pages in two weeks.

Wrong Prediction:
120

Wrong Answer:
First, I will calculate Judy's reading speed in pages per minute. She reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, which means her reading speed is 2 divided by 1.5 pages per minute. This simplifies to approximately 1.333 pages per minute.

Next, I'll determine how many pages she read in the second week. If she read a total of 100 pages in that week, then in 15 minutes, she would have read 100 pages divided by 1.333 pages per minute, which is approximately 75 pages.

Finally, I'll add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week to find the total number of pages Judy read over the two weeks. This results in a total of 75 pages plus 15 pages, totaling 90 pages.

Let's determine how many pages Judy read over the two weeks step by step.

1. **Calculate Judy's Reading Speed:**
   
   Judy reads **2 pages** in **1.5 minutes**. 
   
   To find her reading speed in pages per minute (PM):
   
   \[
   \text{Reading Speed} = \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{1.5} = 1.\overline{3} \text{ pages per minute}
   \]

2. **Determine Weekly Pages Read:**
   
   - **First Week:**
     
     Judy read for **15 minutes** each night.
     
     \[
     \text{Pages in First Week} = 15 \text{ minutes} \times 1.\overline{3} \text{ pages per minute} = 20 \text{ pages}
     \]
   
   - **Second Week:**
     
     Judy read a total of **100 pages**.
     
     \[
     \text{Pages in Second Week} = 100 \text{ pages}
     \]

3. **Calculate Total Pages Read Over Two Weeks:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Pages} = \text{First Week} + \text{Second Week} = 20 + 100 = 120 \text{ pages}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{120}
\]
