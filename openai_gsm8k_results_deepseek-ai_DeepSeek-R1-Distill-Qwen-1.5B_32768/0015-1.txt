Question:
John cuts down an 80-foot tree.  He can make logs out of 80% of it. He cuts it into 4-foot logs.  From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks.  He then sells each plank for $1.2.  How much does he make?

Correct Answer:
He can use 80*.8=<<80*.8=64>>64 feet of the tree.
That means he can make 64/4=<<64/4=16>>16 logs.
That gives him16*5=<<16*5=80>>80 planks.
So he makes 80*1.2=$<<80*1.2=96>>96.

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the amount of wood John has after cutting down the 80-foot tree. He can make 80% of the tree's volume into logs, which means he has 80% of 80 feet.

Next, I'll determine how many 4-foot logs John can obtain from these logs. I'll divide the total volume of logs by the length of each log.

Then, I'll figure out how many 5-foot planks John can cut from each log by dividing the length of each log by the length of each plank.

Finally, I'll calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of planks by the selling price per plank.

To determine how much John makes from cutting down the tree, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of wood available:**
   
   John can make 80% of the 80-foot tree into logs.
   
   \[
   \text{Logs available} = 80\% \times 80\ \text{feet} = 0.8 \times 80 = 64\ \text{feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of 4-foot logs:**
   
   Each log is 4 feet long.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of 4-foot logs} = \frac{64\ \text{feet}}{4\ \text{feet/log}} = 16\ \text{logs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of 5-foot planks from each log:**
   
   From each 4-foot log, John cuts 5-foot planks.
   
   \[
   \text{Planks per log} = \frac{4\ \text{feet}}{5\ \text{feet/plank}} = 0.8\ \text{planks per log}
   \]
   
   However, since John can't cut a fraction of a plank, we'll consider the whole number of planks that can be obtained from each log. Since 4 feet is less than 5 feet, he can only get **0 planks** from each log.

   \[
   \text{Planks per log} = 0\ \text{planks}
   \]
   
   Therefore, the total number of planks is:
   
   \[
   \text{Total planks} = 16\ \text{logs} \times 0\ \text{planks/log} = 0\ \text{planks}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   
   John sells each plank for \$1.20.
   
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 0\ \text{planks} \times \$1.20/\text{plank} = \$0.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
