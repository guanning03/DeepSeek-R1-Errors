Question:
A perfume company is trying to create new scents. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?

Correct Answer:
The store sold 4 types of vanilla scents * 5 sales each = <<4*5=20>>20 of the vanilla scents.
The store sold 8 types of fruity scents * 2 sales each = <<8*2=16>>16 of the fruity scents.
This means that the store sold 20 vanilla â€“ 16 fruity = <<20-16=4>>4 more vanilla scents.
#### 4

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the number of vanilla scents sold. The company sells 5 of each vanilla scent throughout the day.

Next, I'll calculate the number of fruity scents sold. They sell 2 of each fruity scent.

To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, I'll subtract the total number of fruity scents sold from the total number of vanilla scents sold.

Finally, I'll present the result to show the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Vanilla Scent Sales:**
   - The company sells **5 vanilla scents** throughout the day.

2. **Fruity Scent Sales:**
   - The company sells **2 fruity scents** throughout the day.

3. **Comparing Sales:**
   - To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold.
   
   \[
   \text{More Vanilla Sents Sold} = \text{Vanilla Sents Sold} - \text{Fruity Sents Sold}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{More Vanilla Sents Sold} = 5 - 2 = 3
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
