Question:
Mason is on his bike journey at a rate of 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours, takes some rest, and then goes on for another 6 hours. How many miles has he traveled in total?

Correct Answer:
If Mason travels for 8 miles in one hour, in four hours, he traveled for 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 miles.
After his rest, Mason traveled for another 6 hours, and since he was traveling at 8 miles per hour, he had traveled for 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 miles after the six hours.
For the whole journey, Mason traveled for 32+48 = <<32+48=80>>80 miles.

Wrong Answer:
To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, I first calculate the distance he covered during his biking sessions.

Mason's biking rate is 8 miles per hour, and he traveled for 4 hours. So, the distance covered during biking is 8 miles/hour multiplied by 4 hours, which equals 32 miles.

Next, I consider the rest period, as it does not affect the distance traveled. Mason then rode his bike for another 6 hours.

Applying the same rate, the distance covered during the rest period is 8 miles/hour multiplied by 6 hours, which equals 48 miles.

Finally, to find the total distance traveled, I add the distances from both biking periods: 32 miles plus 48 miles equals 80 miles.

To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance traveled during biking:**
   - **Rate (speed):** 8 miles per hour
   - **Time:** 4 hours
   - **Distance:** \( 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Calculate the distance traveled during rest:**
   - **Rate (speed):** 8 miles per hour
   - **Time:** 6 hours
   - **Distance:** \( 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \)

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - **Total Distance:** \( 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{80\ \text{miles}}
\]
