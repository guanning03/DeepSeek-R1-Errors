Question:
Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again. If there are 10 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?

Correct Answer:
He must attend at least six classes, because 60 / 6 = <<60/6=10>>10
He can skip 4 class because 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6
#### 4

Gold:
4

Wrong Prediction:
8

Wrong Answer:
To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents' condition is met, I'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of all classes.
2. Determine the maximum allowable total cost per class.
3. Calculate the remaining budget if all classes are taken.
4. Find the number of classes he can miss by dividing the remaining budget by the per-class cost.

First, the total cost for 10 classes is:
\( 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \)

Manny's parents will stop him if the total cost exceeds \$10 per class. If all 10 classes are taken, the total cost is \$600, which is way more than \$10. Therefore, he needs to miss some classes to reduce the total cost.

The remaining budget he can spend is:
\( \$600 - \$100 = \$500 \)

Now, dividing the remaining budget by the per-class cost:
\( \$500 \div \$60 \approx 8.33 \)

This means Manny can miss up to 8 classes before the total cost exceeds \$10 per class.

To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents' condition is met, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Total number of classes:** 10
- **Cost per class:** \$60
- **Maximum allowed cost per class:** \$10

**Objective:**
Find the number of classes Manny can miss before the total cost per class exceeds \$10.

**Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost for All Classes**
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Classes} \times \text{Cost per Class} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600
\]

**Step 2: Determine the Maximum Allowable Total Cost**
\[
\text{Maximum Allowable Total Cost} = 10 \times \$10 = \$100
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the Remaining Budget if All Classes are Taken**
\[
\text{Remaining Budget} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Maximum Allowable Total Cost} = \$600 - \$100 = \$500
\]

**Step 4: Find the Number of Classes Manny Can Miss**
\[
\text{Number of Missed Classes} = \frac{\text{Remaining Budget}}{\text{Cost per Class}} = \frac{\$500}{\$60} \approx 8.33
\]

Since Manny can't miss a fraction of a class, he can miss **8 classes** before the total cost per class would exceed \$10.

\[
\boxed{8}
\]
