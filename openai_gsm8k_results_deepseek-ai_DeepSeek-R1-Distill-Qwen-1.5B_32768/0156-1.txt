Question:
Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?

Correct Answer:
Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants
After receiving an additional 18 plants, she therefore had a total of 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants
Tomorrow, Maryâ€™s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.
She will therefore remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.
#### 58

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine the total number of potted plants Mary has initially. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which calculates to 2 multiplied by 40, resulting in 80 potted plants.

Next, I'll calculate how many potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 ledges to her friends and family, which means she will give away a total of 40 potted plants.

Finally, I'll subtract the number of potted plants she gives away from her initial total. This means 80 potted plants minus 40 potted plants equals 40 potted plants remaining with Mary.

To determine how many potted plants Mary will have remaining after giving away some, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial total number of potted plants:**
   
   Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
   
   \[
   \text{Total potted plants} = 2 \, \text{potted plants/ledge} \times 40 \, \text{ledges} = 80 \, \text{potted plants}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of potted plants Mary will give away:**
   
   She will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 ledges.
   
   \[
   \text{Potted plants given away} = 1 \, \text{potted plant/ledge} \times 40 \, \text{ledges} = 40 \, \text{potted plants}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of potted plants remaining:**
   
   Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the initial total.
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining potted plants} = 80 \, \text{potted plants} - 40 \, \text{potted plants} = 40 \, \text{potted plants}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{40}
\]
