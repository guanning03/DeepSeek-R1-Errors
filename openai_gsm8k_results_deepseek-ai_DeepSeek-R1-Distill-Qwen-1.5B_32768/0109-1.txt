Question:
Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month.  She sets 25% of her paycheck aside to put towards fancy shoes.  Each pair of shoes she buys costs $1,000.00.  How many shoes can she buy in a year?

Correct Answer:
She is paid $2,000.00 a month and she saves 25% for shoes so she saves 2000*.25 = $<<2000*.25=500.00>>500.00
She saves $500.00 a month for 12 months so she saves 500*12 = $<<500*12=6000.00>>6,000.00
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00 and she has saved $6,000.00 so she can buy 6000/1000 = 6 pair of shoes per year

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate Jessica's monthly contribution to the fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 is $500.00.

This $500.00 allows her to buy a pair of shoes. Each subsequent pair costs another $1,000.00.

To find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, I'll divide her total monthly contribution by the cost per pair.

$500.00 divided by $1,000.00 equals 0.5.

Since she can't buy half a pair, she can afford 1 pair of shoes in a year.

To determine how many fancy shoes Jessica can buy in a year, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Jessica's monthly contribution to the fancy shoes:**

   Jessica sets aside 25% of her \$2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

   \[
   25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00
   \]

2. **Determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy monthly:**

   Each pair of shoes costs \$1,000.00.

   \[
   \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00 \text{ per pair}} = 0.5 \text{ pairs}
   \]

   Since she can't buy half a pair, she can afford **1 pair** of shoes each month.

3. **Calculate the total number of shoes she can buy in a year:**

   \[
   1 \text{ pair/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ pairs}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
