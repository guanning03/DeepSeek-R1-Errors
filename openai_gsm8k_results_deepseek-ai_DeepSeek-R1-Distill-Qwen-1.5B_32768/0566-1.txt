Question:
Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the remaining distance?

Correct Answer:
First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours
Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph
#### 6

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total distance Marissa has already hiked and the time she has spent so far.

Marissa has hiked a total of 4 miles plus 2 miles, which equals 6 miles. She has been hiking for 1 hour plus another hour, totaling 2 hours.

Next, I need to determine the remaining distance she has to hike. The total trail is 12 miles, so she has 12 minus 6 miles left, which is 6 miles.

Marissa wants her average speed for the entire 12-mile trail to be 4 miles per hour. To find out the total time she should take, I'll divide the total distance by the desired average speed: 12 miles divided by 4 miles per hour equals 3 hours.

Marissa has already hiked for 2 hours, so she has 3 hours minus 2 hours left, which is 1 hour remaining.

Finally, to find the speed she needs to maintain for the remaining 6 miles, I'll divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles divided by 1 hour equals 6 miles per hour.

To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Distance and Time:**
   - **Total Distance:** 12 miles
   - **Total Time:** Currently, Marissa has hiked 6 miles in 2 hours.
   - **Desired Average Speed:** 4 miles per hour

2. **Determine the Remaining Distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Distance} = \text{Total Distance} - \text{Distance Hiked} = 12\ \text{miles} - 6\ \text{miles} = 6\ \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Time Remaining:**
   \[
   \text{Desired Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Desired Average Speed}} = \frac{12\ \text{miles}}{4\ \text{miles per hour}} = 3\ \text{hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time Remaining} = \text{Desired Total Time} - \text{Time Hiked} = 3\ \text{hours} - 2\ \text{hours} = 1\ \text{hour}
   \]

4. **Determine the Required Speed for the Remaining Distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Time Remaining}} = \frac{6\ \text{miles}}{1\ \text{hour}} = 6\ \text{miles per hour}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6\ \text{miles per hour}}
\]
