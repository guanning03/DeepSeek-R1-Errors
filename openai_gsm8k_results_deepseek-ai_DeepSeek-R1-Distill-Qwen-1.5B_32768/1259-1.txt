Question:
Gunther, the gorilla, had 48 bananas hidden under a fern branch.  When Gunther wasn't looking, Arnold, the chimpanzee, stole half of the bananas from the pile.  The next day, Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile, but later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 of the bananas.  On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile and began counting bananas.  How many bananas did Gunther find were in the pile?

Correct Answer:
Half of 48 bananas is 48/2=<<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
Arnold's first act of thievery removes 24 bananas, leaving 48-24=24 bananas.
Starting with the remaining 24 bananas, adding 25 bananas to the pile brings the total to 24+25=<<24+25=49>>49 bananas.
Arnold's second act of thievery resulted in 49-12=<<49-12=37>>37 bananas remaining.
Gunther adds another 6 bananas, resulting in the final number of 37+6=<<37+6=43>>43 bananas.

Wrong Answer:
To determine how many bananas Gunther found, let's break down each day step by step:

1. **Initial Bananas**: Gunther starts with 48 bananas.

2. **First Day**:
   - Arnold steals half of the bananas.
   - Stealing: \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) bananas.
   - Remaining bananas: \( 48 - 24 = 24 \).

3. **Second Day**:
   - Arnold does not steal bananas.
   - Gunther adds 25 bananas to his pile.
   - New total: \( 24 + 25 = 49 \) bananas.

4. **Third Day**:
   - Arnold steals another 12 bananas.
   - Stealing: \( 49 - 12 = 37 \) bananas.
   - Remaining bananas: \( 49 - 12 = 37 \).

Therefore, after the third day, Gunther finds 37 bananas in the pile.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Bananas**:
   - Gunther starts with **48 bananas**.

2. **First Day**:
   - **Arnold steals half of the bananas.**
     \[
     \text{Bananas stolen} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ bananas}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Bananas remaining} = 48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
     \]

3. **Second Day**:
   - **Arnold does **not** steal bananas.**
   - **Gunther adds another 25 bananas to his pile.**
     \[
     \text{Total bananas after addition} = 24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
     \]

4. **Third Day**:
   - **Arnold steals another 12 bananas.**
     \[
     \text{Bananas stolen} = 12 \text{ bananas}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Bananas remaining} = 49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{37}
\]
