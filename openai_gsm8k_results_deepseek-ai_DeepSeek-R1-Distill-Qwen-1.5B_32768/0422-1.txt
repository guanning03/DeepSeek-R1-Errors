Question:
Sally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60. Find her mean score.

Correct Answer:
Sally's total score is 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = <<50+80+80+60+40+90+100+70+60=630>>630.
Her mean score is 630 / 9/quizzes = <<630/9=70>>70/quiz.
#### 70

Wrong Answer:
To find Sally's mean score, I first need to add up all her quiz scores.

Adding the scores: 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 600.

Next, I count the total number of quizzes she took, which is 9.

Finally, I divide the total sum by the number of quizzes to find the mean score: 600 รท 9 = 66.666...

To find Sally's mean score, follow these steps:

1. **Add up all her quiz scores:**

   \[
   50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 600
   \]

2. **Count the total number of quizzes:**

   \[
   \text{Total quizzes} = 9
   \]

3. **Divide the total sum by the number of quizzes to find the mean:**

   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{600}{9} = 66.\overline{6}
   \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is:

\[
\boxed{66.\overline{6}}
\]
