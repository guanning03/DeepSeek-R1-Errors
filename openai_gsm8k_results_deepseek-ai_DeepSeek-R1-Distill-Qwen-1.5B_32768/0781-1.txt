Question:
The temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight and then increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. What was the temperature, in degrees Celsius, in the morning?

Correct Answer:
Start = +<<2=2>>2 degrees
Drop 8 degrees = 2 - 8 = -6 degrees
Increase 3 degrees = -6 + 3 = -3 degrees
It was -3 degrees Celsius in the morning.
#### -3

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the temperature drop overnight. The temperature was 2 degrees Celsius and it dropped by 8 degrees. So, subtracting 8 degrees from 2 degrees gives a new temperature of -6 degrees Celsius.

Next, the temperature increases by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. Adding 3 degrees to -6 degrees results in a final temperature of -3 degrees Celsius.

Therefore, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.

To determine the temperature in the morning, let's break down the changes step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature:**  
   The temperature starts at **2 degrees Celsius**.

2. **Temperature Drop Overnight:**  
   The temperature drops by **8 degrees Celsius**.  
   \[
   2\,^{\circ}\mathbb{C} - 8\,^{\circ}\mathbb{C} = -6\,^{\circ}\mathbb{C}
   \]
   So, after the overnight drop, the temperature is **-6 degrees Celsius**.

3. **Temperature Increase in the Morning:**  
   The temperature then increases by **3 degrees Celsius**.  
   \[
   -6\,^{\circ}\mathbb{C} + 3\,^{\circ}\mathbb{C} = -3\,^{\circ}\mathbb{C}
   \]
   Therefore, in the morning, the temperature is **-3 degrees Celsius**.

\[
\boxed{-3^{\circ}\mathbb{C}}
\]
