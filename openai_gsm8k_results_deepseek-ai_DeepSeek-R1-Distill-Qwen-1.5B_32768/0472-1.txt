Question:
Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day from her parents. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each every day and saves the change in her piggy bank. How much money does she put in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days?

Correct Answer:
If each lollipop costs 25 cents, 4 lollipops cost 4 * 25 cents = <<4*25=100>>100 cents
Since 100 cents = $1 she spends $1 everyday.
Her savings everyday is $5 - $1 = $<<5-1=4>>4
If she saves $4 every day for 5 days, she will have $4 * 5 = $<<4*5=20>>20
#### 20

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the weekly pocket money Marisa receives. Since she gets $5 each day, over 7 days, she would receive 5 multiplied by 7, which equals $35 per week.

Next, I'll determine how much she spends on lollipops. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 of them daily. So, the cost per day is 4 times 25 cents, totaling $1.00.

This means that each day, Marisa saves the remaining money after buying the lollipops. She spends $1.00 daily, leaving her with $35 minus $1.00, which equals $34.00 per day.

Finally, to find out how much she saves over 5 days, I'll multiply the daily savings by 5. That is, $34.00 multiplied by 5, resulting in $170.00.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Marisa's weekly pocket money:**
   
   - She receives \$5 each day.
   - Over 7 days, she receives:
     \[
     5\ \text{dollars/day} \times 7\ \text{days} = 35\ \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the daily spending on lollipops:**
   
   - Each lollipop costs 25 cents (\$0.25).
   - She buys 4 lollipops daily:
     \[
     4\ \text{lollipops} \times \$0.25/\text{lollipop} = \$1.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the daily savings:**
   
   - She spends \$1.00 on lollipops each day.
   - Therefore, her daily savings:
     \[
     \$35.00\ \text{(weekly)} - \$1.00\ \text{(daily)} = \$34.00\ \text{(daily savings)}
     \]

4. **Find the total savings over 5 days:**
   
   - Daily savings: \$34.00
   - Over 5 days:
     \[
     \$34.00/\text{day} \times 5\ \text{days} = \$170.00
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{170\ \text{dollars}}
\]
