Question:
Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.  In 8 years his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.  How many years separate the age of the two now?

Correct Answer:
James is 27-5=<<27-5=22>>22 years old
In 8 years he will be 22+8=<<22+8=30>>30 years old
So in 8 years, his cousin will be 30*2-5=<<30*2-5=55>>55
So his cousin is 55-8=<<55-8=47>>47 years old now
So there is a 47-22=<<47-22=25>>25 year gap

Wrong Answer:
To determine how many years separate Jame's current age from his cousin's current age, I'll start by setting up the given information.

Jame will be 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 minus 5, which is 22.

Next, I'll define the cousin's current age as \( c \).

In 8 years, the cousin's age will be \( c + 8 \) years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin's age will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. This translates to the equation:
\[ c + 8 = 2 \times 22 - 5 \]
\[ c + 8 = 44 - 5 \]
\[ c + 8 = 39 \]
\[ c = 39 - 8 \]
\[ c = 31 \]

Finally, to find the difference in their current ages:
\[ 31 - 22 = 9 \]

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Jame will be 27 in 5 years.
- In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.

**Let's denote:**
- \( J \) = Jame's current age
- \( C \) = His cousin's current age

**Step 1: Determine Jame's current age.**

Jame will be 27 in 5 years, so:
\[
J + 5 = 27
\]
\[
J = 27 - 5
\]
\[
J = 22
\]

**Step 2: Set up the equation for the cousin's age in 8 years.**

In 8 years, the cousin's age will be \( C + 8 \) years old. According to the problem:
\[
C + 8 = 2 \times J - 5
\]
Substitute \( J = 22 \):
\[
C + 8 = 2 \times 22 - 5
\]
\[
C + 8 = 44 - 5
\]
\[
C + 8 = 39
\]
\[
C = 39 - 8
\]
\[
C = 31
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in their ages.**

\[
C - J = 31 - 22 = 9
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{9}
\]
