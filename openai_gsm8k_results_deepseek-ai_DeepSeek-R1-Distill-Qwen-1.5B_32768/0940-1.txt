Question:
Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jewel. Daily, Jewel processes 50 customers. What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?

Correct Answer:
While Jewel is processing 50 orders in a day, Julie processes 50 orders/day * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 orders/day.
In a day, they process 100 orders/day + 50 orders/day = <<100+50=150>>150 orders together.
The total number of orders the two processes in a week is 150 orders/day * 7 days/week = <<150*7=1050>>1050 orders
#### 1050

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many customers Jewel processes daily. Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, I'll note that down.

Next, I'll find out how many customers Julie processes in the same time. The problem states that Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, Julie processes 2 times 50, which equals 100 customers daily.

Now, I'll calculate their combined daily output by adding both of their customer counts: 100 (Julie) + 50 (Jewel) = 150 customers per day.

Assuming they work a standard 5-day work week, I'll multiply their combined daily output by 5 to find the total weekly production: 150 * 5 = 750 customers.

Thus, the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel is 750 customers.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the Daily Customer Processing:**
   - **Jewel's Daily Output:**  
     Jewel processes 50 customers daily.
     
   - **Julie's Daily Output:**  
     Julie operates twice as fast as Jewel, so:
     \[
     \text{Julie's Daily Output} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers}
     \]

2. **Calculate Combined Daily Output:**
   \[
   \text{Combined Daily Output} = 100 \, (\text{Julie}) + 50 \, (\text{Jewel}) = 150 \text{ customers}
   \]

3. **Determine Weekly Output (assuming 5 days of work):**
   \[
   \text{Weekly Output} = 150 \times 5 = 750 \text{ customers}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is \(\boxed{750}\) customers.
