Question:
The ice cream parlor was offering a deal, buy 2 scoops of ice cream, get 1 scoop free.  Each scoop cost $1.50.  If Erin had  $6.00, how many scoops of ice cream should she buy?

Correct Answer:
Each scoop cost $1.50. If she buys 2, she gets one free. So it will cost her 2 * 1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00 for thee scoops total.
If you break it down, 3 scoops of ice cream cost $3.00 so 3/3 = $<<3/3=1.00>>1.00 per scoop
Erin has $6.00 and each scoop ends up costing $1.00 each then 6/1 = <<6/1=6>>6 scoops total

Wrong Prediction:
4

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the total number of scoops Erin can afford with her $6.

Each ice cream costs $1.50, so with $6, she can buy 4 scoops.

The deal allows Erin to buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, which effectively gives her 3 scoops for the price of 2.

With $6, Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream by purchasing 2 sets of 2 scoops each, giving her 3 scoops for the first two sets and 1 additional free scoop, totaling 5 scoops.

To determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her \$6, let's break down the problem step by step.

**1. Understand the Deal:**
- **Buy 2 scoops, get 1 free.**
- This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2.

**2. Calculate the Number of Sets Erin Can Afford:**
- Each scoop costs \$1.50.
- With \$6, Erin can buy:
  
  \[
  \text{Number of scoops} = \frac{\$6.00}{\$1.50/\text{scoop}} = 4 \text{ scoops}
  \]

**3. Apply the Deal:**
- Erin has the ability to buy 4 scoops.
- For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free.
  
  - **First 2 scoops:** She pays for 2, gets 1 free.
  - **Next 2 scoops:** She pays for 2, gets 1 free.
  
  However, since she only has \$6, she can't buy two separate sets of 2 scoops. Instead, she can buy 2 scoops, get 1 free, and still have enough money for another free scoop with the remaining \$1.50.

**4. Final Calculation:**
- **First 2 scoops:** She pays \$3.00, gets 1 free (total of 3).
- **Remaining \$1.50:** She buys 1 more scoop for free.

- **Total scoops:** 3 (paid) + 1 (free) = **4 scoops**

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
