Question:
John buys a cassette with 2 songs.  The first song is 5 minutes and the second song is 60% longer.  How much time was the total cassette?

Correct Answer:
The second song is 5*.6=<<5*.6=3>>3 minutes longer than the first
So the second song was 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 minutes
That means the total time was 5+8=<<5+8=13>>13 minutes
#### 13

Wrong Answer:
To determine the total length of John's cassette, I need to calculate the duration of each song and then add them together.

First, the first song is 5 minutes long.

Next, the second song is 60% longer than the first song. I'll calculate 60% of 5 minutes, which is 3 minutes. Adding this to the original duration, the second song is 8 minutes long.

Finally, I'll add the durations of both songs to find the total length: 5 minutes + 8 minutes equals 13 minutes.

**Solution:**

John has a cassette with two songs. Let's determine the total duration step by step.

1. **Duration of the first song:**
   
   The first song is **5 minutes** long.

2. **Duration of the second song:**
   
   The second song is **60% longer** than the first song. 
   
   - Calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
     \[
     0.60 \times 5\ \text{minutes} = 3\ \text{minutes}
     \]
   - Add this to the original duration:
     \[
     5\ \text{minutes} + 3\ \text{minutes} = 8\ \text{minutes}
     \]
   
3. **Total duration of the cassette:**
   
   Add the durations of both songs:
   \[
   5\ \text{minutes} + 8\ \text{minutes} = 13\ \text{minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{13\ \text{minutes}}
