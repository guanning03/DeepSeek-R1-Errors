Question:
Anthony is sending out coupons for his pizza parlor through the mail. He wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. If each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail and each big coupon costs 15 cents, how much does he spend on postage total?

Correct Answer:
First find the total cost of the small coupons: 700 coupons * $0.05/coupon = $<<700*0.05=35>>35
Then find the number of big coupons Anthony sends out: 700 small * 2 big/small = <<700*2=1400>>1400 big coupons
Then multiply the number of big coupons by the cost per big coupon to find the total cost of the big coupons: $0.15/coupon * 1400 coupons = $<<0.15*1400=210>>210
Then add the costs of each size of coupon to find the total cost: $210 + $35 = $<<210+35=245>>245

24500\

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the number of big coupons Anthony is sending. Since he wants twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and there are 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons will be 2 multiplied by 700, which equals 1400.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost for the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so multiplying 700 by 5 gives a total of 3500 cents for the small coupons.

Then, I'll calculate the total cost for the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, so multiplying 1400 by 15 results in 21000 cents for the big coupons.

Finally, I'll add the costs of the small and big coupons together to find the total postage cost. 3500 cents plus 21000 cents equals 24500 cents, which is the total amount Anthony spends on postage.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of big coupons:**
   
   Anthony wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons.
   
   - Number of **small coupons** = 700
   - Number of **big coupons** = 2 × 700 = 1400

2. **Calculate the cost for small coupons:**
   
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents.
   
   - Total cost for small coupons = 700 × 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents}

3. **Calculate the cost for big coupons:**
   
   Each big coupon costs 15 cents.
   
   - Total cost for big coupons = 1400 × 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents}

4. **Determine the total postage cost:**
   
   Add the costs of small and big coupons.
   
   - Total postage cost = 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents}

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{24500\ \text{cents}}
