Question:
A new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.  Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.  Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  One of them is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long.  They play for 4 hours.  How much money is used?

Correct Answer:
Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour
So he spends 3*.25=$<<3*.25=.75>>.75 an hour
His two friends add change 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times an hour
So they spend 6*.25=$<<6*.25=1.5>>1.5 an hour
His last friend puts in money 3/1.5=<<3/1.5=2>>2 times an hour
So he spends 2*.25=$<<2*.25=.50>>.50 an hour
So in total they spend .75+1.5+.5=$<<.75+1.5+.5=2.75>>2.75 an hour
So they spend 2.75*4=$<<2.75*4=11>>11 in the 4 hours

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the total playing time for each person.

Jack plays for 20 minutes.

Each of his friends plays for half the time, which is 10 minutes.

The significantly better friend plays for 1.5 times Jack's time, which is 30 minutes.

Next, calculate the total time spent playing by all four individuals.

Jack: 20 minutes

Friend 1: 10 minutes

Friend 2: 10 minutes

Significantly Better Friend: 30 minutes

Total time: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes

Convert the total playing time from minutes to hours: 70 ÷ 60 ≈ 1.1667 hours

Each game costs 1 quarter, which is $0.25.

Calculate the total cost: 1.1667 × $0.25 ≈ $0.2917

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total cost is approximately $0.29.

To determine how much money Jack and his friends spent at the arcade, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **1. Determine the Playing Time for Each Person**

- **Jack:** Plays for **20 minutes**.
  
- **Friend 1:** Can only play half as long as Jack.  
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]
  
- **Friend 2:** Can play for **1.5 times** as long as Jack.  
  \[
  \text{Time} = 20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### **2. Calculate the Total Playing Time**

- **Jack:** 20 minutes
- **Friend 1:** 10 minutes
- **Friend 2:** 30 minutes

\[
\text{Total Time} = 20 + 10 + 30 = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

### **3. Convert Total Time to Hours**

\[
60 \text{ minutes} = \frac{60}{60} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

### **4. Calculate the Total Cost**

Each game costs **1 quarter**. Since they played for 1 hour, which is **60 minutes**, and each game takes **20 minutes**, the total number of games is:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/game}} = 3 \text{ games}
\]

However, since Jack and his friends played for **4 hours**, the total time spent playing is:

\[
4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, determine the number of games played:

\[
\frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/game}} = 12 \text{ games}
\]

Each game costs **1 quarter**, so the total cost is:

\[
12 \text{ games} \times \$0.25/\text{game} = \$3.00
\]

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{\$3.00}
\]
