Question:
Micheal loves riding a bike. He rode it at least 5 times a week and makes 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks, and then he decided, to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal do in total?

Correct Answer:
In the first part, Micheal did 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 kilometers every week.
He did that for four weeks, which means he made during that time 125 * 4 = <<125*4=500>>500 kilometers.
After that, he made 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 kilometers a week.
And Micheal did that for three weeks, so he rode 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 kilometers during that time.
In total Micheal did 500 + 360 = <<500+360=860>>860 kilometers.
#### 860

Wrong Answer:
To determine the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike, I'll break down his activities into two distinct periods.

First, for the initial four weeks, he rode 25 kilometers each week. Multiplying the number of weeks by the distance per week gives:

4 weeks × 25 kilometers/week = 100 kilometers.

Next, for the subsequent three weeks, he decided to ride only 2 times a week, covering 60 kilometers each time. The total distance for these weeks is calculated by multiplying the number of times he rode by the distance per ride and then by the number of weeks:

2 times/week × 60 kilometers/times × 3 weeks = 360 kilometers.

Finally, adding both periods together gives the total kilometers Micheal rode:

100 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 460 kilometers.
</think>

To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, let's break down his activities into two separate periods and then sum the results.

---

**First Period:**
- **Number of Weeks:** 4 weeks
- **Distance per Week:** 25 kilometers

**Total Distance for the First Period:**
\[
4 \text{ weeks} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/week} = 100 \text{ kilometers}
\]

---

**Second Period:**
- **Number of Weeks:** 3 weeks
- **Number of Times Ridden per Week:** 2 times
- **Distance per Time:** 60 kilometers

**Total Distance for the Second Period:**
\[
3 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ times/week} \times 60 \text{ kilometers/times} = 360 \text{ kilometers}
\]

---

**Total Distance for Both Periods:**
\[
100 \text{ kilometers} + 360 \text{ kilometers} = 460 \text{ kilometers}
\]

\[
\boxed{460\ \text{kilometers}}
\]
