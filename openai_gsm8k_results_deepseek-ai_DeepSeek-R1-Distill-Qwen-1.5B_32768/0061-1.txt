Question:
Bill is signing up for a new streaming service. He got a special introductory deal where the first 6 months were $8 a month, then it went up to the normal price of $12 a month. After 8 months of the normal rate, the service increased its price to $14 a month. How much do 2 years of the service cost him?

Correct Answer:
There are 12 months in a year, so there are 2 years * 12 months per year = 24 months in 2 years.
He has 6 months at the special rate, followed by 8 months of the normal rate, so out of 24 months he pays the increased rate for 24 months - 6 months - 8 months = <<24-6-8=10>>10 months.
He pays the special rate of $8 a month for 6 months, or 6 months * $8 per month = $<<6*8=48>>48.
He pays the normal rate of $12 a month for 8 months, or 8 months * $12 per month = $<<8*12=96>>96.
He pays the new raised rate of $14 a month for 10 months, or 10 months * $14 per month = $<<10*14=140>>140.
Over two years, he pays a total of $48 + $96 + $140 = $<<48+96+140=284>>284.

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine the total duration of the service usage, which is 2 years, or 24 months.

Next, I'll break down the 24 months into three distinct periods:
1. The first 6 months at the introductory rate of $8 per month.
2. The next 18 months at the normal rate of $12 per month.
3. The last 0 months since the service doesn't increase the price beyond $12 during these months.

Now, I'll calculate the cost for each period:
- For the first 6 months: 6 months * $8 = $48.
- For the next 18 months: 18 months * $12 = $216.

Finally, I'll add up the costs of all three periods to find the total cost for 2 years.

To determine the total cost for 2 years (24 months) of the streaming service, let's break down the pricing into the given periods:

1. **First 6 Months:**
   - **Price per month:** \$8
   - **Total cost for 6 months:**  
     \[
     6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
     \]

2. **Next 18 Months (Months 7 to 24):**
   - **Price per month:** \$12
   - **Total cost for 18 months:**  
     \[
     18 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$216
     \]

3. **After 8 Months (Months 9 to 24):**  
   - **Price per month:** \$12 (since the price caps at \$12 after 8 months of normal rate)

**Calculating the Total Cost:**

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost for first 6 months} + \text{Cost for next 18 months}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$48 + \$216 = \$264
\]

\[
\boxed{\$264}
\]
