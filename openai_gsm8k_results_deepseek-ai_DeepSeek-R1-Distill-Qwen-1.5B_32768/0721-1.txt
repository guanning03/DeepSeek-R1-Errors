Question:
Last year there were 50 students enrolled in a calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment. How many students are enrolled this year in the calligraphy class?

Correct Answer:
There was an increase of 50 x 20/100 = <<50*20/100=10>>10 students in enrollment.
So, there is a total of 50 + 10 = <<50+10=60>>60 students who were enrolled this year.
#### 60

Gold:
60

Wrong Prediction:
110

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the increase in enrollment due to the 20% growth.

I'll calculate 20% of last year's enrollment, which was 50 students.

20% of 50 students is 0.20 multiplied by 50, resulting in 10 students.

Next, I'll add this increase to last year's enrollment to find this year's total enrollment.

Adding 10 students to 50 students gives a total of 60 students.

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

**Solution:**

To determine the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year after a 20% increase from last year:

1. **Calculate the increase in enrollment:**

   \[
   \text{Increase} = \text{Last year's enrollment} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100}\right)
   \]

   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50 \times \left(1 + \frac{20}{100}\right) = 50 \times 1.20 = 60
   \]

2. **Determine this year's total enrollment:**

   \[
   \text{This year's enrollment} = \text{Last year's enrollment} + \text{Increase}
   \]

   \[
   \text{This year's enrollment} = 50 + 60 = 110
   \]

**Answer:**

\[
\boxed{110}
\]
