Question:
David and Dasha went to the carnival, where there are 9 rides.  Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket.  You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 which gives you 9 rides.  If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, how much money does David save?

Correct Answer:
Each ride cost 2 x $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All 9 rides cost $4 x 9 = $<<4*9=36>>36.
By bathing the ride bracelet, David saves $36 - $30 = $<<36-30=6>>6.

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the total cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet.

The bracelet costs $30, which gives him 9 rides.

Next, I'll determine how many rides Dasha needs to buy tickets for. Since there are 9 rides in total and David already has one bracelet, Dasha needs to ride 8 rides using the tickets.

Each ride ticket costs $2, so 8 rides will cost 8 multiplied by $2, which equals $16.

Now, I'll calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha.

David pays $30 for the bracelet.
Dasha pays $16 for the tickets.
Adding these together, the total cost is $46.

Finally, I'll compare the total cost with the cost if they both bought tickets. Without the bracelet, each ride ticket would be $2, so 9 rides would cost $18.

The difference between the two total costs is $46 minus $18, which equals $28.

Therefore, David saves $28 by buying a ride bracelet instead of purchasing tickets.

Let's determine how much money David saves by using a ride bracelet instead of buying individual ride tickets.

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost for David

- **Cost of a Ride Bracelet:** \$30
- **Number of Rides Provided by the Bracelet:** 9 rides
- **Number of Tickets David Needs to Buy:** 
  \[
  9 \text{ rides} - 1 \text{ bracelet} = 8 \text{ tickets}
  \]
- **Cost per Ticket:** \$2
- **Total Cost for Tickets:** 
  \[
  8 \text{ tickets} \times \$2/\text{ticket} = \$16
  \]
- **Total Cost for David:** 
  \[
  \$30 \text{ (bracelet)} + \$16 \text{ (tickets)} = \$46
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Cost for Dasha

- **Number of Rides Dasha Plans to Take:** 9 rides
- **Cost per Ticket:** \$2
- **Total Cost for Tickets:** 
  \[
  9 \text{ rides} \times \$2/\text{ride} = \$18
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the Savings

- **Total Cost if Both Buy Tickets:** 
  \[
  \$46 \text{ (David)} + \$18 \text{ (Dasha)} = \$64
  \]
- **Total Cost if Both Buy Tickets:** 
  \[
  9 \text{ rides} \times \$2/\text{ride} = \$18
  \]
- **Savings:** 
  \[
  \$64 - \$18 = \$46
  \]

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct that.

Actually, the correct approach is:

- **Total Cost if Both Buy Tickets:** 
  \[
  9 \text{ rides} \times \$2/\text{ride} = \$18
  \]
- **Total Cost if David buys Bracelet and Dasha buys Tickets:** 
  \[
  \$30 + \$16 = \$46
  \]
- **Savings:** 
  \[
  \$46 - \$18 = \$28
  \]

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{28}
