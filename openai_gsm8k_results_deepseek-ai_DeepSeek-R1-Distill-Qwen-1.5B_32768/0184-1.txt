Question:
Milly needs to return a book she decided was really boring. The book weighs 4 pounds, cost $32, and needs to be returned to a distribution center 20 miles away. If the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile, and Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, how much money will Milly lose?

Correct Answer:
Milly will get back from Amazon $32 * .75 = $<<32*.75=24>>24 once the book is returned.
She will lose $32 - 24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 when the book is returned.
The first part of the shipping cost is $0.35 per pound * 4 pounds = $<<0.35*4=1.40>>1.40
The second part of the shipping cost is $0.08 per mile * 20 miles = $<<0.08*20=1.60>>1.60
Milly loses $8 + $1.40 + $1.60 = $<<8+1.4+1.6=11>>11

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total shipping cost for Milly's book. The book weighs 4 pounds and costs $32. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile for 20 miles. 

I'll calculate the variable cost by multiplying the weight by the per-pound rate: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40. Then, I'll calculate the mileage cost by multiplying the distance by the per-mile rate: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60. Adding these together, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, I need to determine how much Milly will get back from Amazon. Amazon refunds 75% of the purchase price, so 75% of $32 is $24.00. 

Finally, to find out how much Milly will lose, I subtract the amount she'll get back from the total shipping cost: $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00. The negative sign indicates that Milly will lose $21.00.

To determine how much money Milly will lose, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Shipping Cost**

The shipping company charges:
- **Cost per pound:** \$0.35
- **Cost per mile:** \$0.08
- **Distance:** 20 miles

**Variable Cost (per pound):**
\[
4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
\]

**Mileage Cost:**
\[
20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
\]

**Total Shipping Cost:**
\[
\$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
\]

### **Step 2: Determine the Refund from Amazon**

Amazon refunds 75% of the purchase price:
\[
75\% \times \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24.00
\]

### **Step 3: Calculate the Loss**

The loss is the total shipping cost minus the refund:
\[
\$3.00 - \$24.00 = -\$21.00
\]

The negative sign indicates a loss. Therefore, Milly will lose:
\[
\boxed{\$21.00}
\]
