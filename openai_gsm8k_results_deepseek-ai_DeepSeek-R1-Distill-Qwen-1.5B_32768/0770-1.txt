Question:
A company sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the cost of $3.5 per gallon. However, Mr. Marcellus later realized 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.

Correct Answer:
If he purchased 4000 gallons, the number of gallons expired is 2/5 * 4000 gallons = <<2/5*4000=1600>>1600 gallons.
If each gallon costs $3.5, and he returned 1600 gallons for refund, the total amount he got from the refund is $3.5/gallon * 1600 gallons = $<<3.5*1600=5600>>5600

5600

Wrong Prediction:
1,600

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons, so the total purchase is $4,000.

Next, I need to calculate how much of this milk was expired. Two-fifths of 4,000 gallons is (2/5) * 4,000 = $1,600.

Since only 1,600 gallons were unsold and expired, Mr. Marcellus returned these to the company. The company will refund him 2/5 of the total amount paid, which is (2/5) * $4,000 = $1,600.

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of $1,600 for the expired milk.

To determine how much Mr. Marcellus received in refunds, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Amount Purchased:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Purchase} = 4,000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14,000
   \]

2. **Determine the Amount of Exploded Milk:**
   
   \[
   \text{Exploded Milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4,000 \text{ gallons} = 1,600 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Refund Amount:**
   
   The refund is based on the portion of the total purchase that was expired.
   
   \[
   \text{Refund} = \frac{2}{5} \times \$14,000 = \boxed{\$1,600}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$1,600}
\]
