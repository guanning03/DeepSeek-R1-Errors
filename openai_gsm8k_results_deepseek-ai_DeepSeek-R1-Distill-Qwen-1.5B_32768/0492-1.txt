Question:
Dale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his club at school. He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?

Correct Answer:
Dale starts off selling 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered, but ends up selling 150, 100 - 150 = <<100-150=-50>>-50 candies.
So Dale orders 100 more candies to make up for the deficit and to sell even more, -50 candies + 100 candies = <<100-50=50>>50 candies Dale has left and still needs to sell.
#### 50

Gold:
50

Wrong Prediction:
0

Wrong Answer:
First, Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies that he had ordered.

He then sold 150 candies, which means he lost 150 candies from his initial stock.

To find out how many candies he still has, we subtract the number of candies sold from the initial amount: 100 - 150 = -50.

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Dale has actually lost 50 candies.

Next, Dale ordered another 100 candies, so his new total is 100 - 50 = 50 candies.

Finally, to determine how many more candies he needs to sell to reach a total of all candies, we subtract the current number of candies from the desired total: 50 - 50 = 0.

Therefore, Dale has already sold all his candies.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell to reach his goal of selling all his candies.

1. **Initial Stock:**
   - Dale starts with **100 total** butterscotch candies that he ordered.

2. **Candies Sold:**
   - Dale sells **150 butterscotch candies**.

3. **Candies Left After Sales:**
   - \(100 \text{ (initial)} - 150 \text{ (sold)} = -50\)

   This negative result indicates that:
   - **50 candies** have been lost or no longer available.

4. **Additional Order:**
   - Dale then orders **100 more butterscotch candies**.
   - **New total** = \(50 \text{ (remaining)} + 100 \text{ (ordered)} = 150 \text{ candies}\)

5. **Total Candies to Sell:**
   - Dale wants to **sell all of his candy**.
   - Since he has **150 candies** after the additional order, he needs to **sell all 150 candies**.

6. **Candies Already Sold:**
   - He has already sold **150 candies**.

7. **Candies Still Needed to Sell:**
   - \(150 \text{ (total desired)} - 150 \text{ (already sold)} = 0\)

   This means:
   - **Dale has sold all his candies.**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{0}
\]
