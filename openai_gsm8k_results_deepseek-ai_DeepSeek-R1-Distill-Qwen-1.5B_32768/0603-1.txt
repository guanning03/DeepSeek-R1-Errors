Question:
Billy is buying some candy with $10 his father gave him. The candy costs $1.5 a pound. After buying candy, he takes half his change and spends it on gumballs, which cost $.05 each. If he bought 40 gumballs, how many pounds of candy did he buy?

Correct Answer:
He spent $2 on gumballs because 40 x .05 = <<40*.05=2>>2
He had $4 in change because 2 / .5 = <<2/.5=4>>4
He spent $6 on candy because 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6
He bought 4 pounds of candy because 6 / 1.5 = <<6/1.5=4>>4

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how much money Billy has left after buying the candy. He started with $10 and spent some amount on candy.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost of the candy he bought. Since each pound costs $1.5 and he bought 40 pounds, I'll multiply 40 by $1.5 to find out how much he spent on candy.

After subtracting the cost of the candy from his initial $10, I'll have the total change he received. Then, Billy takes half of this change and buys gumballs. Each gumball costs $0.05, so I'll divide the amount he spent on gumballs by $0.05 to find out how many gumballs he bought.

Finally, I'll add the number of gumballs he bought to the number of pounds of candy he initially purchased to find the total amount of candy he bought.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total cost of the candy:**
   - **Cost per pound of candy:** \$1.50
   - **Number of pounds bought:** 40
   - **Total cost for candy:** 
     \[
     40 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.50/\text{pound} = \$60.00
     \]

2. **Determine the change Billy receives after buying the candy:**
   - **Total money given:** \$10.00
   - **Total cost of candy:** \$60.00
   - **Change received:** 
     \[
     \$10.00 - \$60.00 = -\$50.00
     \]
     (It appears Billy does not have enough money to buy any candy, but this is an error in the problem setup. Assuming the problem is correctly stated, we'll proceed.)

3. **Calculate the amount spent on gumballs:**
   - **Total change received:** \$50.00 (after the negative change calculation)
   - **Cost per gumball:** \$0.05
   - **Number of gumballs bought:** 
     \[
     \frac{\$50.00}{\$0.05/\text{gumball}} = 1000 \text{ gumballs}
     \]
     However, this contradicts the given information that he bought **40 gumballs**. This indicates an inconsistency in the problem setup.

4. **Re-examining the Problem:**
   - It seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement. If Billy bought **40 gumballs**, each costing \$0.05, the total cost for gumballs would be:
     \[
     40 \text{ gumballs} \times \$0.05/\text{gumball} = \$2.00
     \]
   - This implies that the change spent on gumballs is \$2.00, which means the total change received after buying candy is \$2.00. Therefore, the amount spent on candy would be:
     \[
     \$10.00 - \$2.00 = \$8.00
     \]
   - Now, calculate the number of pounds of candy bought:
     \[
     \frac{\$8.00}{\$1.50/\text{pound}} \approx 5.333 \text{ pounds}
     \]
     Since it's not practical to buy a fraction of a pound, we'll consider that Billy bought **5 pounds** of candy, with a small amount of change left over.

**Final Answer:** \boxed{5}
