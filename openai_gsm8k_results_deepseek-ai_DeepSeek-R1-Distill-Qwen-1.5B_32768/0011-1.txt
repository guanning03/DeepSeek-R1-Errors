Question:
Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies that cost $3.20. If each lollipop costs $0.40, how much will 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost him?

Correct Answer:
Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.
So four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.
Thus, each candy costs $1.20/4 = $<<1.20/4=0.30>>0.30.
Ten lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.
Ten candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.
Hence, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total cost of the lollipops. Manolo bought five lollipops at $0.40 each, so the total cost for the lollipops is 5 multiplied by $0.40, which equals $2.00.

Next, I will calculate the total cost of the candies. The candies cost $3.20 in total.

Finally, to find the combined cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, I will add the cost of the lollipops and the candies together. That is, $2.00 for the lollipops plus $3.20 for the candies, resulting in a total cost of $5.20.

**Solution:**

Manolo bought:
- **5 lollipops** at \$0.40 each.
- **4 candies** costing a total of \$3.20.

We need to find the total cost for:
- **10 lollipops** and **10 candies**.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of 10 lollipops**

\[
10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00
\]

**Step 2: Determine the cost of 10 candies**

Since Manolo bought 4 candies for \$3.20, we can find the cost of one candy:

\[
\text{Cost per candy} = \frac{\$3.20}{4} = \$0.80
\]

Now, calculate the cost for 10 candies:

\[
10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.80 \text{ per candy} = \$8.00
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies**

\[
\$4.00 \text{ (lollipops)} + \$8.00 \text{ (candies)} = \$12.00
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12.00}
\]
