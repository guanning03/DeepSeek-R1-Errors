Question:
Jake is walking through the Museum of Entomology. He sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, 90 insects with 6 legs each, and 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each. How many legs does Jake see total?

Correct Answer:
First find the total number of spider legs: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = <<80*8=640>>640 legs
Then find the total number of insect legs: 90 spiders * 6 legs/spider = <<90*6=540>>540 legs
Then find the total number of mutant invertebrate legs: 3 mutants * 10 legs/mutant = <<3*10=30>>30 legs
Then add the number of each kind of leg to find the total he saw: 640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = <<640+540+30=1210>>1210 legs
#### 1210

Gold:
1210

Wrong Prediction:
1110

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total number of legs each type of creature has.

For the spiders, there are 80 spiders with 8 legs each. Multiplying 80 by 8 gives 640 legs.

Next, for the insects, there are 90 insects with 6 legs each. Multiplying 90 by 6 results in 540 legs.

Then, the rare mutant invertebrates have 3 individuals each with 10 legs. Multiplying 3 by 10 gives 30 legs.

Finally, I'll add up all the legs from spiders, insects, and invertebrates to find the total number of legs Jake sees.

**Solution:**

To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we'll calculate the legs contributed by each type of creature and then add them together.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Number of spiders: 80
   - Legs per spider: 8
   - Total legs from spiders: \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \) legs

2. **Insects:**
   - Number of insects: 90
   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \) legs

3. **Rare Mutant Invertebrates:**
   - Number of invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) legs

4. **Total Legs:**
   - Sum of all legs: \( 640 + 540 + 30 = 1110 \) legs

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1110}
\]
