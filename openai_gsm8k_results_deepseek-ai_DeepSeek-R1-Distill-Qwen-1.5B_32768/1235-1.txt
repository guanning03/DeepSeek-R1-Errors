Question:
Kalinda is working on a 360 piece puzzle with her mom. Kalinda can normally add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can typically place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.  How many hours will it take them to complete this puzzle?

Correct Answer:
Her mom places 2 pieces per minute because 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2
On average they get in 6 pieces per minute because 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6
It will take 60 minutes to complete the puzzle because 360 / 6 = <<360/6=60>>60
It will take one hour because 60 / 60 = <<60/60=1>>1

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can work together on the puzzle.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, so her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which is 2 pieces per minute.

Adding their rates together, Kalinda contributes 4 pieces per minute, and her mom contributes 2 pieces per minute, making a combined rate of 6 pieces per minute.

The puzzle has a total of 360 pieces. To find the time it will take to complete the puzzle, I'll divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate: 360 pieces divided by 6 pieces per minute equals 60 minutes.

Finally, to convert the time from minutes to hours, I'll divide 60 minutes by 60, which equals 1 hour.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the Rates:**
   - Kalinda can add **4 pieces per minute**.
   - Her mom can place **half as many pieces per minute** as Kalinda, which is **2 pieces per minute**.

2. **Calculate the Combined Rate:**
   \[
   \text{Combined Rate} = \text{Kalinda's Rate} + \text{Mom's Rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute}
   \]

3. **Determine the Total Time Needed:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time (in minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total Pieces}}{\text{Combined Rate}} = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Convert Minutes to Hours:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time (in hours)} = \frac{60}{60} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1\ \text{hour}}
\]
