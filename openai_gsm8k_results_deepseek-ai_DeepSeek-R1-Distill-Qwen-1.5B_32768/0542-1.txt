Question:
Rob, Royce, and Pedro are contractors getting ready to put a new roof on three homes. If the three homes will need 250 cases of shingles, with the first house needing 1/2 of the second, and the third needing double the first. How many cases of shingles will the third house need?

Correct Answer:
Let x be the number of cases of shingles for the second house
The first house needs 1/2 x cases of shingles
The third house needs 2(1/2)x=x cases of shingles
250=x+x+(1/2)x
250=(5/2)x
250(2/5)=100=x
The third house needs 100 cases of shingles
#### 100

Wrong Answer:
First, let's define the number of cases required for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases, and the third house needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed is the sum of the cases for all three houses:
\[
x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250
\]

Combining like terms gives:
\[
3.5x = 250
\]

Solving for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3.5:
\[
x = \frac{250}{3.5} \approx 71.43
\]

Now, calculate the cases for the third house:
\[
2x = 2 \times 71.43 \approx 142.86
\]
</think>

Let's determine how many cases of shingles the third house will need.

**Let:**
- \( x \) = number of cases needed for the first house
- \( \frac{1}{2}x \) = number of cases needed for the second house
- \( 2x \) = number of cases needed for the third house

**Total cases needed:**
\[
x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250
\]

**Combine like terms:**
\[
x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{3}{2}x + 2x = \frac{7}{2}x
\]

**Set up the equation:**
\[
\frac{7}{2}x = 250
\]

**Solve for \( x \):**
\[
x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43
\]

**Calculate the cases for the third house:**
\[
2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{143}
\]
