Question:
Bob is in charge of doing laundry for a large hotel. Each room has two sheets, one comforter, twice as many pillow cases as sheets and twice as many towels as pillow cases. How many pieces of laundry are there in 80 rooms?

Correct Answer:
First find the number of pillow cases in each room: 2 sheets * 2 pillow cases/sheet = <<2*2=4>>4 pillow cases
Then find the number of towels in each room: 4 pillow cases * 2 towels/pillow case = <<4*2=8>>8 towels
Then find the number of pieces of laundry in each room: 4 pillow cases + 8 towels + 2 sheets + 1 comforter = <<4+8+2+1=15>>15 pieces of laundry
Then multiply the number of pieces of laundry in each room by the number of rooms to find the total: 15 pieces of laundry/room * 80 rooms = <<15*80=1200>>1200 pieces

Gold:
1200

Wrong Prediction:
1120

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine the number of pieces of clothing needed per room. Each room has two sheets, which means there are two pieces of clothing.

Next, since there are twice as many pillow cases as sheets, each room requires 4 pillow cases.

Then, there are twice as many towels as pillow cases, so each room needs 8 towels.

Adding these together, each room requires a total of 14 pieces of clothing.

Finally, to find the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms, I'll multiply 14 by 80, which equals 1,120.

To determine the total number of pieces of laundry needed for 80 rooms, let's break down the requirements step by step.

1. **Sheets (Comforter):**
   - Each room requires **2 sheets**.
   - For **80 rooms**, the total number of sheets is:
     \[
     2 \text{ sheets/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 160 \text{ sheets}
     \]

2. **Pillow Cases:**
   - The number of pillow cases is twice the number of sheets:
     \[
     2 \times 160 = 320 \text{ pillow cases}
     \]

3. **Towels:**
   - The number of towels is twice the number of pillow cases:
     \[
     2 \times 320 = 640 \text{ towels}
     \]

4. **Total Pieces of Laundry:**
   - Adding up all the clothing items:
     \[
     160 \text{ sheets} + 320 \text{ pillow cases} + 640 \text{ towels} = 1120 \text{ pieces of laundry}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1120}
\]
