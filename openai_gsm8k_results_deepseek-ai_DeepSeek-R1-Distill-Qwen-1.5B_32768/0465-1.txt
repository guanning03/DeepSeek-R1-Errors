Question:
Lana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has 27 cups, and she divides these into 3 rows. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. She then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?

Correct Answer:
If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 â€“ 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.
As there are equal amounts of chamomile tea and mint tea, there is a total of 12 cups / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups of mint tea.
Dividing these into rows shows that each row holds 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 cups of mint tea.

Wrong Answer:
Lana starts with 27 cups of tea. She divides these into 3 equal rows, so each row has 9 cups.

She uses some cups for cinnamon tea, leaving the remaining cups for chamomile and mint tea. There are 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

This means the remaining cups are 27 - 15 = 12 cups.

These 12 cups are equally divided between chamomile and mint tea, so each type has 12 / 2 = 6 cups per row.

Therefore, each row contains 6 cups of mint tea.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

**Total Cups of Tea:** 27

**Number of Rows:** 3

1. **Determine the number of cups per row:**
   
   \[
   \text{Cups per row} = \frac{27}{3} = 9
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of cups used for cinnamon tea:**
   
   \[
   \text{Cup of cinnamon tea} = 15
   \]

3. **Find the remaining cups for chamomile and mint tea:**
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining cups} = 27 - 15 = 12
   \]

4. **Divide the remaining cups equally between chamomile and mint tea:**
   
   \[
   \text{Cups of each type} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
   \]

**Final Answer:**

Each row contains \(\boxed{6}\) cups of mint tea.
