Question:
Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.  If he was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, how many reports did he staple altogether?

Correct Answer:
In one hour, there are 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 (15 minutes).
From 8am - 11am, there are 11 - 8 = <<11-8=3>>3 hours.
In 3 hours, there are 3 x 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 (15 minutes).
In those 3 hours, Vince stapled 12 x 30 = <<12*30=360>>360 reports.
#### 360

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, given that he can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, let's see the time span we're dealing with. It starts at 8:00 AM and ends at 11:00 PM. Hmm, that's a pretty long period. Maybe I should calculate the total number of minutes he worked during this time.

Let's break it down. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Wait, is that right? Let me count: from 8 AM to 9 AM is 60 minutes, 9 to 10 is another 60, 10 to 11 is another 60, and then from 11 AM to 11 PM is another 12 hours. So, adding that up: 60 + 60 + 60 + 720 minutes. Let me add those numbers: 60 + 60 is 120, plus 60 is 180, plus 720 is 900 minutes. So, 900 minutes total.

Wait, is that correct? 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours, right? Because from 8 AM to 11 PM is 15 hours. So 15 hours multiplied by 60 minutes per hour is 900 minutes. Yeah, that's correct. So, 900 minutes.

Now, the question is how many reports does he staple in 900 minutes? We know he can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. So, maybe I can find out how many 15-minute intervals are there in 900 minutes and then multiply that by 30.

Let me think. If there are 900 minutes, and each interval is 15 minutes, then the number of intervals is 900 divided by 15. Let's calculate that: 900 รท 15. Hmm, 15 times 60 is 900, so 60. So, there are 60 intervals of 15 minutes each in 900 minutes.

Now, since he can staple 30 reports in each interval, then total reports would be 60 multiplied by 30. Let me compute that: 60 * 30 is 1800. So, he staple 1800 reports in total.

Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me double-check my calculations. 15 minutes per interval, 60 intervals in 900 minutes. So, 60 intervals times 30 reports is 1800 reports. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as rate. His rate is 30 reports every 15 minutes. So, his rate is 30 divided by 15 reports per minute, which is 2 reports per minute. So, 2 reports per minute times 540 minutes (which is 900 minutes). 2 * 540 is 1080. Wait, that's different. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, hold on, 2 reports per minute times 540 minutes is 1080? But earlier, I got 1800. So, something's wrong here. Maybe I messed up the rate calculation.

Wait a second, if I think in terms of reports per minute, 30 reports in 15 minutes is 2 reports per minute. So, 2 reports per minute times 540 minutes is 1080 reports. But earlier, I calculated 60 intervals times 30 reports is 1800 reports.

Hmm, that discrepancy is concerning. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of minutes. Let me recalculate the total minutes from 8 AM to 11 PM.

From 8 AM to 11 AM is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. From 11 AM to 11 PM is 12 hours, which is 720 minutes. So, total minutes is 180 + 720 = 900 minutes. Okay, that's correct.

Hmm, so 900 minutes. If he does 30 reports every 15 minutes, that's 2 reports per minute. So, 2 * 900 is 1800 reports. That seems correct.

But in the other approach, I calculated 60 intervals of 15 minutes, each interval producing 30 reports. So, 60 * 30 is 1800. So, both methods give the same result. So, why did I get 1080 when I did 2 reports per minute times 540 minutes?

Wait, maybe I messed up the number of minutes. Let me check again.

Wait, 15 minutes per interval. So, 900 minutes divided by 15 minutes per interval is 60 intervals. 60 intervals times 30 reports is 1800.

Alternatively, 2 reports per minute times 540 minutes is 1080. So, which is correct?

Wait, 2 reports per minute times 540 minutes is 1080.

But 900 minutes divided by 15 minutes per interval is 60, times 30 is 1800.

Wait, that means I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, 15 minutes per interval, 60 intervals. 60 times 30 is 1800. That's correct. So, 2 reports per minute times 540 minutes is 1080, but that's not correct because 540 minutes is 9 hours. Wait, but if I compute 2 reports per minute times 540 minutes, that's 1080 reports.

But 1080 is less than 1800. So, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.

Wait, 15 minutes per interval, 60 intervals: 60 * 30 = 1800. That's correct.

So, why is the alternative calculation giving me a different answer? Maybe I made a mistake in the alternative approach.

Wait, 2 reports per minute times 540 minutes: 2 * 540 is 1080. But that's inconsistent with the first method.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of minutes.

Wait, 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours, which is 900 minutes. So, 2 reports per minute times 900 minutes is 1800.

So, that would make sense. So, why did I think 540 minutes?

Wait, perhaps I thought 9 hours, but 9 hours is 540 minutes. But 900 minutes is 15 hours, which is more than 9 hours.

Wait, maybe I messed up the rate.

Wait, if he can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, that's 30 / 15 = 2 reports per minute.

So, 2 reports per minute times 900 minutes is 1800. So, that's correct.

Wait, so why did I think 540 minutes. So, perhaps I confused the total time?

Wait, maybe I misread the question. It says he was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.

Wait, so from 8 AM to 11 PM is 15 hours, which is 900 minutes. So, 900 minutes. So, 2 reports per minute times 900 minutes is 1800.

So, that must be correct.

Wait, so why did I get 1080 earlier? Oh, because I thought 540 minutes instead of 900 minutes.

Wait, 9 hours is 540 minutes, but 11 PM is 23:00, so 15 hours is 900 minutes. So, 900 minutes.

Therefore, 2 reports per minute times 900 minutes is 1800.

So, the correct answer is 1800 reports.

Wait, so why did I think 540 minutes? Maybe I thought the total time was 9 hours? But 8 AM to 11 PM is 15 hours, which is 900 minutes.

Wait, so perhaps I confused the time duration. Let me just confirm.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. Let's count the hours:

From 8 AM to 11 AM is 3 hours.

From 11 AM to 11 PM is 12 hours.

So, 3 + 12 = 15 hours, which is 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Yes, that's correct.

So, 900 minutes. So, 2 reports per minute times 900 minutes is 1800.

Therefore, the total number of reports is 1800.

So, the initial approach was correct.

Wait, but maybe I should think of it differently. Maybe calculate how many reports he can staple in each hour, then multiply by the number of hours.

Let me try that approach.

So, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

In each hour, how many reports can he staple?

He can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, 30 reports. So, in one hour (60 minutes), how many 15-minute intervals are there?

60 / 15 = 4.

So, in one hour, he can staple 4 * 30 = 120 reports.

Therefore, in 15 hours, he can staple 15 * 120 = 1800 reports.

So, same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should do it using rates.

So, the rate is 30 reports per 15 minutes, which is 2 reports per minute.

Therefore, in 900 minutes, he can staple 2 * 900 = 1800 reports.

So, all methods are leading to 1800.

So, why did I initially think 1080? I think I might have confused the time duration.

Wait, if I thought 11 PM is 11 hours, which is 660 minutes, but that's incorrect because 11 PM is 23:00, which is 15 hours, so 900 minutes.

So, maybe I should just stick to the correct calculation.

Therefore, the total number of reports is 1800.

So, the answer is 1800 reports.

**Final Answer**
Vince staple \boxed{1800} reports altogether.
</think>

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we first calculate the total time duration in minutes.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this to minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we calculate the total number of reports:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Thus, the total number of reports Vince staple altogether is:
\[
\boxed{1800}
\]
