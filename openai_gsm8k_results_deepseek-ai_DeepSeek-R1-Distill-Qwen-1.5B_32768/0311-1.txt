Question:
Tim gets a promotion that offers him a 5% raise on his $20000 a month salary.  It also gives him a bonus worth half a month's salary. How much money will he make in a year?

Correct Answer:
The promotion increased his monthly salary by 20000*.05=$<<20000*0.05=1000>>1000
So his new salary is 20000+1000=$<<20000+1000=21000>>21000 a month
So he makes 21000*12=$<<21000*12=252000>>252,000 a year
The bonus is worth 21000*.5=$<<21000*.5=10500>>10500
So he makes 252,000+10,500=$<<252000+10500=262500>>262,500 for the year
#### 262500

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Tim has a promotion that gives him a 5% raise on his current $20,000 monthly salary. Plus, he also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. I need to figure out how much money he'll make in a year. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's tackle the raise. His current salary is $20,000 per month. A 5% raise means he'll get an additional 5% of that amount. To find the raise amount, I can calculate 5% of $20,000. 

So, 5% as a decimal is 0.05. Multiplying that by $20,000 gives me 0.05 * 20,000. Let me compute that: 20,000 divided by 100 is 200, and 200 times 5 is 1,000. So, the raise is $1,000 per month.

Now, adding that raise to his original salary, his new monthly salary becomes $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000 per month. Okay, that makes sense.

Next, he gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. Half a month's salary would be half of $20,000, right? So, half of $20,000 is $10,000. Got that.

So, now, his total monthly income is the sum of his raise and the bonus. That would be $21,000 + $10,000. Let me add those together: $21,000 plus $10,000 is $31,000 per month.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that. If his original salary is $20,000 plus 5%, which is $1,000, so $21,000. The bonus is half of his original salary, which is $10,000. So yes, $21,000 plus $10,000 is indeed $31,000. Okay, that seems correct.

Now, to find out his annual income, I need to multiply his monthly salary by 12, since there are 12 months in a year. So, $31,000 per month times 12 months.

Let me calculate that. 31,000 times 12. Let me break this down. 30,000 times 12 is 360,000. Then, 1,000 times 12 is 12,000. So, adding those together, 360,000 + 12,000 equals $372,000. Hmm, that seems straightforward.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The question says a 5% raise and a bonus worth half a month's salary. So, I think I accounted for both. The raise was on his original salary, which is $20,000, and the bonus was half a month's salary, which is $10,000. So, adding those together correctly gave me $31,000 per month, which when multiplied by 12 gives $372,000. That seems right.

Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe instead of calculating the raise and then the bonus, I could calculate the total for the year directly. So, first month's salary would be $31,000, as we found earlier. Then, the next 11 months would also be $31,000 each, right? So, 12 months times $31,000 is the same as 12 times 31,000, which is 372,000. Yep, that checks out.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total additional income from the raise and the bonus and then add it to the original salary. So, the raise for the year would be 5% of $20,000 times 12 months. That would be 0.05 * 20,000 = $1,000 per month raise, so $1,200 per year. The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $10,000. So, adding that $1,200 raise and $10,000 bonus to the original $20,000 salary would give him total income of $20,000 + $1,200 + $10,000 = $31,200 per year. Wait, hold onâ€”that doesn't seem right because $31,200 is a year's salary. But that contradicts my previous result of $372,000.

Wait, that can't be. There must be something wrong with this approach. Let me think. If his original salary is $20,000 per month, and he gets a 5% raise each month, then the raise is $1,000 per month, so $1,200 per year. But when I calculate the total of all his monthly earnings, including the raise and the bonus, I should get the total annual salary.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the bonus as an additional amount that's not tied to the raise? Hmm, so maybe the total for the year is the sum of his monthly salaries plus the bonus. So, each month he gets $21,000 plus $10,000, which totals $31,000 per month. So, 12 times $31,000 is $372,000. That seems to make sense.

But why when I tried adding the raise and the bonus separately, I got a different number? Maybe because I was incorrectly separating the bonus and the raise in the same year. The 5% raise is a percentage of his original salary, so it's $1,000 per month, which is a flat amount. The bonus is a one-time amount of half a month's salary, which is $10,000 per year. So, when calculating the total for the year, the raise is a flat amount of $1,200, and the bonus is $10,000. So, total is $1,200 + $10,000 = $11,200, plus the original $20,000, which is $31,200. But that's incorrect because the raise is added to the salary, not just a flat amount.

Wait, now I'm confused. Which approach is correct? Let's think. If Tim gets a 5% raise on his $20,000, that's a monthly raise of $1,000, so over a year, that's $1,200. Then, he gets a one-time bonus of half a month's salary, which is $10,000. So, adding those together, he makes $1,200 + $10,000 = $11,200 extra in the year, on top of his $20,000 original salary. So, total income would be $31,200. But that conflicts with the other method where I considered his monthly salary as $31,000, which is $21,000 + $10,000, and then multiplied by 12.

Wait, so which one is correct? Let me get back to the problem statement. It says "a 5% raise on his $20000 a month salary. It also gives him a bonus worth half a month's salary." So, the raise is on his current salary, which is $20,000, so the raise is $1,000 per month. The bonus is half a month's salary, so $10,000. So, his total income each month is $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000. Therefore, annually, that's $31,000 * 12 = $372,000. So, that seems correct.

But in the alternative approach, if I consider the raise as a flat amount per year, which is $1,200, and the bonus as a flat amount of $10,000, then the total would be $31,200. But the problem is, does the bonus get added each month or once a year? The problem says it's a bonus worth half a month's salary. It doesn't specify whether it's added each month or once. But since it's a one-time amount, I think it's added once at the end of the year. So, the $10,000 bonus is added once, not each month.

So, if that's the case, then the total income would be his original salary of $20,000 plus the raise of $1,200 plus the bonus of $10,000. So, $20,000 + $1,200 = $21,200, plus $10,000 = $31,200. But that seems incorrect because the raise is on his current salary, not on his original salary. The raise is a percentage of his current monthly salary, so each month he gets an extra $1,000.

Therefore, the correct way is to calculate his monthly salary as $21,000, add the $10,000 bonus each month, so total per month is $31,000, times 12 is $372,000. So, that seems to make sense.

Wait, but the problem says "half a month's salary." So, is that $10,000 per year, or is it $5,000 per month? Because half a month's salary would be either $5,000 or $10,000 depending on how you calculate it. But since a month is typically considered as 30 days, half a month is 15 days. So, half of $20,000 is $10,000. So, that seems correct.

So, summarizing, Tim's monthly salary after the raise is $21,000. His bonus is $10,000. So, each month, he makes $31,000. Over the year, that's 12 times $31,000, which is $372,000. Therefore, the answer is $372,000.

But let me just check once more. If each month he gets a 5% raise on his current $20,000, which is $1,000, so $21,000. Plus a bonus of half a month's salary, which is $10,000. So, $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000 per month. 12 times that is $372,000. Yep, that seems consistent.

I think I was tripped up earlier when I tried adding the raise and bonus separately, but the correct way is to add them together as separate components of his total income per month. So, the raise is a monthly addition, and the bonus is a one-time addition. Therefore, the total is $31,000 per month, and $372,000 per year.

So, I think the final answer is $372,000.

**Final Answer**
Tim will make \boxed{372000} dollars in a year.
</think>

Tim's current monthly salary is $20,000. He receives a 5% raise on this salary, which is calculated as follows:

\[
5\% \text{ of } \$20,000 = 0.05 \times 20,000 = \$1,000
\]

Adding the raise to his original salary, his new monthly salary becomes:

\[
\$20,000 + \$1,000 = \$21,000
\]

Additionally, Tim receives a bonus worth half a month's salary. Half of $20,000 is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \$20,000 = \$10,000
\]

Therefore, his total monthly income is the sum of his raise and the bonus:

\[
\$21,000 + \$10,000 = \$31,000
\]

To find his annual income, we multiply his monthly salary by 12:

\[
\$31,000 \times 12 = \$372,000
\]

Thus, Tim will make \boxed{372000} dollars in a year.
