Question:
Ophelia and Jenna are living in the same apartment building. They each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that they have.

Correct Answer:
If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, a total of 3*22 = <<3*22=66>>66 chairs
The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88
Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.
The total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 64+20 = <<64+20=84>>84 sofas
Together, they have 84 sofas+88 chairs = <<84+88=172>>172

Wrong Answer:
Ophelia has 20 sofas.

Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna also has 20 + 3 = 23 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 20 = 60 chairs.

Adding up all the furniture, Ophelia has 20 + 20 = 40 pieces, and Jenna has 60 + 23 = 83 pieces.

The total number of furniture pieces is 40 + 83 = 123.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Ophelia has 20 sofas.
- Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.

**Step 1: Determine the number of chairs Ophelia has.**

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[
\text{Chairs}_{\text{Ophelia}} = \text{Sofas}_{\text{Ophelia}} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of chairs Jenna has.**

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
\[
\text{Chairs}_{\text{Jenna}} = 3 \times \text{Chairs}_{\text{Ophelia}} = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

**Step 3: Determine the number of sofas Jenna has.**

Jenna has 2 fewer furniture pieces than Ophelia. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas:
\[
\text{Sofas}_{\text{Jenna}} = \text{Sofas}_{\text{Ophelia}} - 2 = 20 - 2 = 18
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of furniture pieces (sofas and chairs) for both Ophelia and Jenna.**

- **Ophelia:**
  \[
  \text{Total}_{\text{Ophelia}} = \text{Sofas}_{\text{Ophelia}} + \text{Chairs}_{\text{Ophelia}} = 20 + 22 = 42
  \]

- **Jenna:**
  \[
  \text{Total}_{\text{Jenna}} = \text{Sofas}_{\text{Jenna}} + \text{Chairs}_{\text{Jenna}} = 18 + 66 = 84
  \]

**Step 5: Find the combined total of furniture pieces for both.**
\[
\text{Total}_{\text{Combined}} = \text{Total}_{\text{Ophelia}} + \text{Total}_{\text{Jenna}} = 42 + 84 = 126
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{126}
\]
