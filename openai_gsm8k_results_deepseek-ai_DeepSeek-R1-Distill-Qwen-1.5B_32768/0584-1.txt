Question:
Mark works at his job for 8 hours a day for 5 days a week.  He used to make $10 an hour but they raised his pay by $2 per hour.  How much does he make a week?

Correct Answer:
He works 8*5=<<8*5=40>>40 hours a week
He gets paid 10+2=$<<10+2=12>>12 an hour
So he now gets 40*12=$<<40*12=480>>480 per week
#### 480

Wrong Answer:
To determine how much Mark makes weekly after the pay increase, I'll follow these steps:

First, calculate his original weekly earnings by multiplying his hourly rate by the number of hours he works each week.

Next, calculate the new hourly wage by adding the raise to his original hourly rate.

Finally, multiply the new hourly wage by the number of hours he works each week to find his new weekly earnings.

**Solution:**

Let's calculate Mark's weekly earnings step by step.

1. **Original Pay Rate:**
   
   - **Hourly wage:** \$10
   - **Hours worked per week:** 8 hours
   
   **Original weekly earnings:**
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80/\text{week}
   \]

2. **New Pay Rate After Raise:**
   
   - **Raise:** \$2 per hour
   
   **New hourly wage:**
   \[
   \$10 + \$2 = \$12/\text{hour}
   \]

3. **New Weekly Earnings with the Raise:**
   
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$96/\text{week}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$96}
\]
