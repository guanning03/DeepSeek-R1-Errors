Question:
Lillian's garden doesn't have any bird feeders in it so she wants to add some. She builds 3 and buys 3 others. Each bird feeder seems to attract 20 birds throughout the day until Lillian notices that the birds seem to prefer the feeders she made herself which attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. How many birds can Lillian expect to see in her garden each day if the same amount keep coming to her bird feeders?

Correct Answer:
Lillian has 3 store-bought + 3 self-made bird feeders = <<3+3=6>>6 bird feeders in all.
Lillian first notices each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, 6 x 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 birds.
Then Lillian notices that her 3 self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 extra birds.
Each day Lillian can expect to see 120 + 30 = <<120+30=150>>150 birds in her garden.

90

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the number of bird feeders Lillian has. She initially buys 3 and then adds 3 more, totaling 6 bird feeders.

Next, calculate the number of birds attracted to each store-bought feeder, which is 20 birds per feeder.

Then, find out how many birds are attracted to Lillian's own bird feeders. Since each feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, each Lillian's feeder attracts 30 birds.

Now, calculate the total number of birds attracted to all 6 bird feeders. This is 20 birds per feeder multiplied by 6, resulting in 120 birds.

Finally, add the additional 10 birds from Lillian's own feeders to the total. This gives a final count of 130 birds expected to be in the garden each day.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day.

1. **Number of Bird Feeters:**
   - **Store-bought:** Lillian initially buys **3 bird feeders**.
   - **Made herself:** She adds **3 more bird feeders**.
   - **Total bird feeders:** \( 3 + 3 = 6 \) bird feeders.

2. **Birds Attracted by Store-Bought Feeters:**
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts **20 birds**.
   - Total birds from store-bought feeders: \( 20 \text{ birds/feeder} \times 3 \text{ feeders} = 60 \text{ birds} \).

3. **Birds Attracted by Lillian's Feeters:**
   - Each Lillian's feeder attracts **10 more birds** than the store-bought ones.
   - Birds attracted by one Lillian feeder: \( 20 \text{ birds} + 10 \text{ birds} = 30 \text{ birds} \).
   - Total birds from Lillian's feeders: \( 30 \text{ birds/feeder} \times 6 \text{ feeders} = 180 \text{ birds} \).

4. **Total Birds Expected:**
   - Add the birds from both types of feeders: \( 60 \text{ birds} + 180 \text{ birds} = 240 \text{ birds} \).

However, since the problem specifies that the same number of birds keep coming to the bird feeders, we need to adjust our calculation to account for the additional birds from Lillian's feeders.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - **Total birds from store-bought feeders:** \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) birds.
   - **Additional birds from Lillian's feeders:** \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) birds.
   - **Total birds expected:** \( 60 + 30 = 90 \) birds.

\(\boxed{90}\)
