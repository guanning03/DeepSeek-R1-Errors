Question:
Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?

Correct Answer:
Artie will round his marigolds up from $2.74 to $3, since the number following the 2 is 5 or higher.
Artie will round his petunias up from $1.87 to $2, since the number following the 1 is 5 or higher.
Artie will round his begonias down from $2.12 to $2, since the number following the 2 is less than 5.
Artie sells 12 marigolds x $3 = $<<12*3=36>>36
Artie sells 9 petunias x $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18
Artie sells 17 begonias x $2 = $<<17*2=34>>34
Altogether, Artie will make $36 + $18 + $34 = $<<36+18+34=88>>88

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total cost for each type of flower by multiplying the price per pot by the number of pots Artie sells.

For marigolds, the cost is $2.74 multiplied by 12 pots. After calculating, I round this amount to the nearest dollar.

Similarly, for petunias, I multiply $1.87 by 9 pots and round the result.

For begonias, multiplying $2.12 by 17 pots and rounding the total to the nearest dollar.

Finally, I add up the rounded amounts for each type of flower to determine the total amount Artie will make today.

To determine how much Artie will make from selling the flowers, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost for each type of flower before rounding.**
2. **Round each total to the nearest dollar.**
3. **Sum the rounded amounts to find the total earnings.**

Let's perform each calculation step by step.

---

### **1. Calculate Total Cost Before Rounding**

**a. Marigolds**
- **Price per pot:** \$2.74
- **Number of pots sold:** 12

\[
\text{Total for Marigolds} = 2.74 \times 12 = \$32.88
\]

**b. Petunias**
- **Price per pot:** \$1.87
- **Number of pots sold:** 9

\[
\text{Total for Petunias} = 1.87 \times 9 = \$16.83
\]

**c. Begonias**
- **Price per pot:** \$2.12
- **Number of pots sold:** 17

\[
\text{Total for Begonias} = 2.12 \times 17 = \$35.94
\]

### **2. Round Each Total to the Nearest Dollar**

**a. Marigolds (\$32.88):**
- The decimal part is .88, which is closer to 1 than to 0.
- Rounded to the nearest dollar: \$33

**b. Petunias (\$16.83):**
- The decimal part is .83, which is closer to 1 than to 0.
- Rounded to the nearest dollar: \$17

**c. Begonias (\$35.94):**
- The decimal part is .94, which is closer to 1 than to 0.
- Rounded to the nearest dollar: \$36

---

### **3. Sum the Rounded Amounts**

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \$33 + \$17 + \$36 = \$86
\]

---

\[
\boxed{86}
\]
