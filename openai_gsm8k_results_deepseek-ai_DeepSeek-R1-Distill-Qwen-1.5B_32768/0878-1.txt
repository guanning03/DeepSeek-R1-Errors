Question:
Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?

Correct Answer:
First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400
#### 8400

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A's gross pay is $15 per hour multiplied by 2000 hours, which equals $30,000. With a 20% tax rate, the property tax is $6,000. Subtracting the property tax from the gross pay gives a net income of $24,000.

Next, I'll determine the net pay for Job B.

Job B's gross pay is $42,000. Subtracting the property tax of $6,000 leaves a net income of $36,000. Applying a 10% tax rate to this net income results in a final net pay of $3,240.

Finally, I'll compare the net pays of both jobs. Job B offers a higher net pay of $3,240 compared to Job A's $24,000. The difference in net pay is $20,760.

Let's determine the net pay for each job and then find the difference.

**Job A:**
- **Gross Pay:**  
  \[
  15 \, \text{USD/hour} \times 2000 \, \text{hours} = 30,000 \, \text{USD}
  \]
- **Property Tax:**  
  \[
  6,000 \, \text{USD}
  \]
- **Net Pay After Property Tax:**  
  \[
  30,000 \, \text{USD} - 6,000 \, \text{USD} = 24,000 \, \text{USD}
  \]
- **Tax:**  
  \[
  24,000 \, \text{USD} \times 0.20 = 4,800 \, \text{USD}
  \]
- **Net Pay After Tax:**  
  \[
  24,000 \, \text{USD} - 4,800 \, \text{USD} = 19,200 \, \text{USD}
  \]

**Job B:**
- **Gross Pay:**  
  \[
  42,000 \, \text{USD}
  \]
- **Tax:**  
  \[
  42,000 \, \text{USD} \times 0.10 = 4,200 \, \text{USD}
  \]
- **Net Pay After Tax:**  
  \[
  42,000 \, \text{USD} - 4,200 \, \text{USD} = 37,800 \, \text{USD}
  \]

**Comparison:**
- **Job A Net Pay:** \$19,200  
- **Job B Net Pay:** \$37,800  

The job with a higher net pay rate is **Job B**, and the difference is:

\[
37,800 \, \text{USD} - 19,200 \, \text{USD} = \boxed{18,600 \, \text{USD}}
\]
