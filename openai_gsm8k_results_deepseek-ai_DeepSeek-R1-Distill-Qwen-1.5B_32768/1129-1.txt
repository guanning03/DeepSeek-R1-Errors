Question:
Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. If Arelia has $120, how much would each have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them?

Correct Answer:
Since Arelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money Arelia, Kassidy has 3/4*$120 = $<<3/4*120=90>>90
The total amount of, money Kassidy and Arelia have together is $90+$120 = $<<90+120=210>>210
Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, and since Kassidy has $90, Rayna has $60+$90 = $<<60+90=150>>150
The three of them together has $210+$150 = $<<210+150=360>>360
If they decide to add up their money and share equally, each person would receive $360/3= $<<360/3=120>>120

Wrong Prediction:
90

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how much money each person has.

Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. Let's denote Kassidy's amount as K. So, Rayna has K + 60.

Kassidy has 3/4 of Aurelia's money. If I let A represent Aurelia's amount, then K = (3/4)A.

Arelia has $120, which is given.

Next, I can express everything in terms of A. Since K = (3/4)A, Rayna's amount becomes (3/4)A + 60.

Now, the total amount of money they all have together is A + (3/4)A + (6/4)A, which simplifies to (13/4)A.

To find the equal share, I divide the total by 4, resulting in (13/16)A per person.

Substituting A = 120 into the equation gives each person an equal share of $135.

Let's determine how much money each person has step by step.

1. **Letâ€™s Define Variables:**
   - Let **A** represent the amount of money Arelia has.
   - Given that **Arelia has $120**, we have:
     \[
     A = 120
     \]
   
2. **Kassidy's Money:**
   - Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia.
     \[
     \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4}A = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
     \]
   
3. **Rayna's Money:**
   - Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy.
     \[
     \text{Rayna's money} = \text{Kassidy's money} + 60 = 90 + 60 = 150
     \]
   
4. **Total Money:**
   - Now, let's find the total amount of money all three have together.
     \[
     \text{Total} = \text{Arelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360
     \]
   
5. **Equal Sharing:**
   - If they decide to add together their money and share equally among the four of them (Arelia, Kassidy, Rayna, and presumably **[missing person]**?), the share per person would be:
     \[
     \text{Each person's share} = \frac{\text{Total}}{4} = \frac{360}{4} = 90
     \]
   
6. **Final Answer:**
   - After adding and sharing equally, each person would have:
     \[
     \boxed{90}
     \]
