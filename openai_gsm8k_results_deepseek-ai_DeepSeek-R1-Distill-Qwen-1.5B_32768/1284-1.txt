Question:
Sandy wants to lose as much weight as Joey does but needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, how many weeks will it take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight?

Correct Answer:
Joey loses 8 pounds / 4 weeks = <<8/4=2>>2 pounds per week.
In order to match Joey, Sandy should lose 2 pounds / 4 = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 of a pound per week.
To find the number of weeks it will take, divide the number of pounds by the rate of weight loss: 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds/week = <<8/0.5=16>>16 weeks
#### 16

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the rate at which Joey loses weight. Joey loses 8 pounds over 4 weeks, so his weekly weight loss is 8 pounds divided by 4 weeks, which equals 2 pounds per week.

Next, Sandy loses as much weight as Joey in 4 weeks. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy also loses 2 pounds per week.

To find out how many weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, I divide the total weight loss by her weekly rate. So, 8 pounds divided by 2 pounds per week equals 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in a single week.

Let's determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in a single week.

**Given:**
- Joey loses **8 pounds** in **4 weeks**.

**Step 1: Calculate Joey's weekly weight loss rate.**
\[
\text{Joey's weekly loss} = \frac{\text{Total weight loss}}{\text{Number of weeks}} = \frac{8\ \text{pounds}}{4\ \text{weeks}} = 2\ \text{pounds per week}
\]

**Step 2: Determine Sandy's weight loss rate.**
- Sandy loses the same amount of weight as Joey in **4 weeks**.
- Therefore, Sandy's weekly weight loss rate is:
\[
\text{Sandy's weekly loss} = 2\ \text{pounds per week}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose 8 pounds.**
\[
\text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Total weight loss}}{\text{Sandy's weekly loss}} = \frac{8\ \text{pounds}}{2\ \text{pounds per week}} = 4\ \text{weeks}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
