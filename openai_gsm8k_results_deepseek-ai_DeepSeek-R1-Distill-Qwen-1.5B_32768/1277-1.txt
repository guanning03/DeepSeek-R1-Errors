Question:
Leah just got a new kitten. Spaying her cost $200, her 3 vaccines costs $20 each, and the kitten broke 4 vases that cost $12 each. How much has the kitten cost so far?

Correct Answer:
First find the total cost of the vaccines: $20/vaccine * 3 vaccines = $<<20*3=60>>60
Then find the total cost of the vases: 4 vases * $12/vase = $<<4*12=48>>48
Then add the cost of the vaccines and vases to the cost of the spaying to find the total cost: $200 + $48 + $60 = $<<200+48+60=308>>308

Wrong Prediction:
248

Wrong Answer:
I need to determine the total cost of the kitten's care. First, I'll add the cost of the spays, which is $200.

Next, I'll calculate the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and there are 3 of them, so I'll multiply 3 by $20 to get $60.

Then, I'll find out how much the vases cost. Each vase is $12, and there are 4 vases, so I'll multiply 4 by $12 to get $48.

Finally, I'll add up all these amounts to find the total cost: $200 (spays) + $60 (vices) + $48 (vases) equals $308.

Let's calculate the total cost of the kitten's care step by step.

1. **Cost of Spaying the Kitten:**
   \[
   \$200
   \]

2. **Cost of V侧面:**
   - Each vase costs \$12.
   - There are 4 vases.
   \[
   4 \times \$12 = \$48
   \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   \[
   \$200 \, (\text{spays}) + \$48 \, (\text{vases}) = \$248
   \]

**Final Answer:** \boxed{248}
