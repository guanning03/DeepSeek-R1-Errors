Question:
Tim makes a special honey and jam mix.  To make 1 jar of the mixture it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit and 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.  It also takes 2 pounds of special honey.  The passion fruit costs $6 per pound, the jackfruit is $8 per pound, and the honey is $10 per pound.  He sells each jar for $50.  How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?

Correct Answer:
The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12
The jackfruit cost 1.5*8=$<<1.5*8=12>>12
The honey is 2*10=$<<2*10=20>>20
So the total cost for a jar is 12+12+20=$<<12+12+20=44>>44
So the profit per jar is 50-44=$<<50-44=6>>6
So the total profit for 10 jars is 10*6=$<<10*6=60>>60
#### 60

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the cost of producing one jar of the mixture. This includes the costs of passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey.

Passion fruit costs $6 per pound and requires 2 pounds per jar, so the cost for passion fruit is \(2 \times 6 = \$12\).

Jackfruit costs $8 per pound and also requires 2 pounds per jar, so the cost for jackfruit is \(2 \times 8 = \$16\).

Honey costs $10 per pound and requires 2 pounds per jar, so the cost for honey is \(2 \times 10 = \$20\).

Adding these together, the total cost per jar is \(12 + 16 + 20 = \$48\).

Next, since Tim sells each jar for $50, the profit per jar is \(50 - 48 = \$2\).

Finally, to find the profit from selling 10 jars, I multiply the profit per jar by 10: \(10 \times 2 = \$20\).

To determine Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of the special mixture, let's break down the costs and revenues step by step.

### **1. Calculate the Cost of Ingredients for One Jar**

Each jar consists of:
- **Passion Fruit:** 2 pounds at \$6 per pound
- **Jackfruit:** 2 pounds at \$8 per pound
- **Honey:** 2 pounds at \$10 per pound

**Cost of Ingredients:**
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Passion Fruit} &= 2 \text{ lbs} \times \$6/\text{lb} = \$12 \\
\text{Jackfruit} &= 2 \text{ lbs} \times \$8/\text{lb} = \$16 \\
\text{Honey} &= 2 \text{ lbs} \times \$10/\text{lb} = \$20 \\
\end{align*}
\]

**Total Cost per Jar:**
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$12 + \$16 + \$20 = \$48
\]

### **2. Determine the Revenue from Selling One Jar**

Tim sells each jar for \$50.

\[
\text{Revenue per Jar} = \$50
\]

### **3. Calculate the Profit per Jar**

\[
\text{Profit per Jar} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$50 - \$48 = \$2
\]

### **4. Calculate the Profit from Selling 10 Jars**

\[
\text{Total Profit} = 10 \times \$2 = \$20
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$20}
\]
