Question:
An air conditioner cools a room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?

Correct Answer:
The air conditioner ran for 3 hours on low, so the temperature dropped 2 * 3 = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.
It then ran for 4 hours on high, so the temperature dropped another 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 degrees.
It was then turned off for 2 hours, so the temperature rose 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 degrees.
Thus, the final temperature was 6 + 12 - 4 = <<6+12-4=14>>14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total cooling effect of the air conditioner. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour when running on low and 3 degrees per hour when running on high.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, contributing 2 degrees per hour, so that's 3 times 2, which equals 6 degrees of cooling.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, resulting in a cooling rate of 3 degrees per hour. So, 4 times 3 equals 12 degrees of cooling.

After that, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, during which the room remained at its temperature without cooling or warming.

To find the total cooling, I add the cooling from both low and high runs: 6 degrees plus 12 degrees equals 18 degrees of cooling.

Therefore, the final temperature is 18 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

To determine how many degrees lower the final temperature is compared to the starting temperature, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given:
1. **Cooling rate when running on low:**  
   - **2 degrees per hour**
   
2. **Cooling rate when running on high:**  
   - **3 degrees per hour**

3. **Air conditioner usage details:**  
   - **Ran on low for 3 hours:**  
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees}
     \]
   - **Then turned up to high for 4 hours:**  
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees}
     \]
   - **Then turned off for 2 hours:**  
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ degrees/hour} = 0 \text{ degrees}
     \]

4. **Total cooling effect:**  
   \[
   6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} + 0 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The final temperature is **18 degrees lower** than the starting temperature.

\[
\boxed{18}
\]
