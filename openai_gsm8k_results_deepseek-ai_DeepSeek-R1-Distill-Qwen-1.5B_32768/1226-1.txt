Question:
James decides to buy birthday candles for his 2 sons.  One of them is 12 and the other is 4 years younger.  A pack of 5 candles costs $3.  How much does James spend on candles?

Correct Answer:
His younger son is 12-4=<<12-4=8>>8 years old
So he needs 12+8=<<12+8=20>>20 candles
That means he needs 20/5=<<20/5=4>>4 packs of candles
The total cost of those is 4*3=$<<4*3=12>>12
#### 12

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many candles James needs for his two sons. The older son is 12, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is 8 years old.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of candles required by multiplying the age of each son by the number of candles per pack. The older son needs 12 packs, and the younger son needs 8 packs. This gives a total of 20 packs.

Since each pack contains 5 candles, I'll multiply the total number of packs by 5 to find the total number of candles. This results in 100 candles.

Finally, to find out how much James spends on the candles, I'll divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack and then multiply by the cost per pack. The total cost is $30.

To determine how much James spends on birthday candles for his two sons, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the ages of the sons:**
   - Older son: 12 years old
   - Younger son: 12 - 4 = 8 years old

2. **Calculate the number of packs needed for each son:**
   - Older son: 12 packs (1 candle per year)
   - Younger son: 8 packs (1 candle per year)

3. **Find the total number of packs needed:**
   \[
   12 \text{ packs} + 8 \text{ packs} = 20 \text{ packs}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each pack costs $3.
   \[
   20 \text{ packs} \times \$3 \text{ per pack} = \$60
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
