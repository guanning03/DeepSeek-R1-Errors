Question:
Ava and Emma want to know who is better at the new video game Ava got for her birthday. They are each going to play one level and whoever has the highest score wins. They receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on, 5 points for each berry they collect, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level. If Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, but finishes the level 4 seconds slower, what is the difference between their two scores?

Correct Answer:
For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.
For collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.
For finishing the level faster, Emma earns 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 more points than Ava.
Overall, Emma has 120 â€“ 80 - 15 = <<120-80-15=25>>25 more points than Ava.

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll define the variables for the number of enemies Ava and Emma jump on. Let \( E_A \) represent the number of enemies Ava jumps on, and \( E_E \) represent the number Emma jumps on.

Given that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, I can express this relationship as:
\[
E_A = E_E + 8
\]

Next, I'll define the variables for the number of berries Ava and Emma collect. Let \( B_A \) represent the number of berries Ava collects, and \( B_E \) represent the number Emma collects.

Given that Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, the relationship can be expressed as:
\[
B_A = B_E + 3
\]

Now, I'll calculate Ava's score using the points system:
- 10 points for each enemy jumped on: \( 10 \times E_A \)
- 5 points for each berry collected: \( 5 \times B_A \)
- 30 points for each second left on the timer: \( 30 \times S_A \), where \( S_A \) is the number of seconds left on the timer for Ava.

Similarly, I'll calculate Emma's score:
- 10 points for each enemy jumped on: \( 10 \times E_E \)
- 5 points for each berry collected: \( 5 \times B_E \)
- 30 points for each second left on the timer: \( 30 \times S_E \), where \( S_E \) is the number of seconds left on the timer for Emma.

The problem states that Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. Assuming the timer starts at a certain time, finishing 4 seconds slower would mean:
\[
S_E = S_A + 4
\]

To find the difference in their scores, I'll subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10 \times E_A + 5 \times B_A + 30 \times S_A) - (10 \times E_E + 5 \times B_E + 30 \times S_E)
\]

Substituting the relationships and expressions into the equation:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10 \times (E_E + 8) + 5 \times (B_E + 3) + 30 \times S_A) - (10 \times E_E + 5 \times B_E + 30 \times (S_A + 4))
\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[
\text{Difference} = 80 + 15
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 95
\]

Therefore, Ava's score is 95 points higher than Emma's score.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the difference in Ava and Emma's scores.

### **Given:**
- **Points System:**
  - 10 points for each enemy jumped on.
  - 5 points for each berry collected.
  - 30 points for each second left on the timer.

- **Relationships:**
  - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
  - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
  - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.

### **Let's Define Variables:**
- Let \( E_A \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- Let \( E_E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( B_A \) be the number of berries Ava collects.
- Let \( B_E \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( S_A \) be the time Ava has left on the timer.
- Let \( S_E \) be the time Emma has left on the timer.

### **Establishing Relationships:**

1. **Enemies Jumped:**
   \[
   E_A = E_E + 8
   \]
   
2. **Berries Collected:**
   \[
   B_A = B_E + 3
   \]
   
3. **Timer Time:**
   \[
   S_E = S_A + 4
   \]

### **Calculating Scores:**

- **Ava's Score:**
  \[
  \text{Score}_A = (10 \times E_A) + (5 \times B_A) + (30 \times S_A)
  \]
  
- **Emma's Score:**
  \[
  \text{Score}_E = (10 \times E_E) + (5 \times B_E) + (30 \times S_E)
  \]
  
### **Expressing Scores in Terms of Emma's Variables:**

- Substitute \( E_A = E_E + 8 \) into Ava's score:
  \[
  \text{Score}_A = 10(E_E + 8) + 5(B_E + 3) + 30S_A = 10E_E + 80 + 5B_E + 15 + 30S_A = 10E_E + 5B_E + 30S_A + 95
  \]
  
- For Emma, her score remains:
  \[
  \text{Score}_E = 10E_E + 5B_E + 30S_E
  \]
  
### **Calculating the Difference:**

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E = (10E_E + 5B_E + 30S_A + 95) - (10E_E + 5B_E + 30S_E)
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 30S_A + 95 - 30S_E
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 30(S_A - S_E) + 95
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 30(4) + 95 \quad \text{(Since } S_E = S_A + 4 \text{)}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 120 + 95 = 215
\]

### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{215}
\]
