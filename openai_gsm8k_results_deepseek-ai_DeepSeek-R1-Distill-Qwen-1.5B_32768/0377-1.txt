Question:
A three-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups.  Greg wants to make small jello cups for his son's outdoor birthday party.  There will be 30 kids and he wants to have enough so that each kid can have 4 jello cups.  Jello is currently on sale for $1.25.  How much will he spend on jello?

Correct Answer:
There will be 30 kids and he wants each kid to have 4 servings so that's 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>120 jello cups
1 box of jello makes 10 jello cups and he needs to make 120 jello cups so he needs 120/10 = <<120/10=12>>12 boxes of jello
Each box of jello is $1.25 and he needs 12 boxes so he will spend 1.25*12 = $<<1.25*12=15.00>>15.00 on jello

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the total number of jello cups needed for the 30 kids, with each kid having 4 cups. That's 30 multiplied by 4, which equals 120 jello cups.

Next, calculate how much jello is needed per jello cup. Since a three-ounce box makes 10 jello cups, one jello cup requires 3 ounces divided by 10, which is 0.3 ounces per cup.

Multiply the total number of jello cups by the ounces per cup to find the total ounces needed: 120 cups multiplied by 0.3 ounces per cup equals 36 ounces.

Finally, determine the total cost by multiplying the total ounces by the sale price per ounce: 36 ounces multiplied by $1.25 per ounce equals $45.

To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, let's break down the problem step by step.

**1. Calculate the Total Number of Jello Cups Needed:**

- **Number of kids:** 30
- **Jello cups per kid:** 4

\[
\text{Total jello cups} = 30 \, \text{kids} \times 4 \, \text{jello cups/kid} = 120 \, \text{jello cups}
\]

**2. Determine the Ounces of Jello Per Jello Cup:**

- **Jello per box:** 3 ounces
- **Jello cups per box:** 10

\[
\text{Ounces per jello cup} = \frac{3 \, \text{ounces}}{10 \, \text{jello cups}} = 0.3 \, \text{ounces/jello cup}
\]

**3. Calculate the Total Ounces of Jello Needed:**

\[
\text{Total ounces} = 120 \, \text{jello cups} \times 0.3 \, \text{ounces/jello cup} = 36 \, \text{ounces}
\]

**4. Compute the Total Cost:**

- **Sale price per ounce:** \$1.25

\[
\text{Total cost} = 36 \, \text{ounces} \times \$1.25/\text{ounce} = \$45
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$45}
\]
