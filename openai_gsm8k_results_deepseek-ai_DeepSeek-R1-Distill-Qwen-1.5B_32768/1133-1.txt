Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here about a book that's printed on paper. The book, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Each paper is printed on both sides, and each side has one page of the book. The book is 1.5 inches thick. I need to figure out how many pages are in the book. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, let me try to visualize this. A book is made up of multiple pages, and each sheet of paper in the book is folded in such a way that each sheet contributes to two pages. Since each paper is printed on both sides, that means each sheet of paper is used for two pages, right? So, the number of pages in the book is twice the number of sheets of paper. That makes sense because each sheet has two sides, each side used for a page.

Now, the book is 1.5 inches thick. The problem states that when the book is stacked, it's 100 pages to the inch. So, if I think about a single sheet of paper, how thick is it? If 100 pages equal 1 inch, then each page is 0.01 inches thick? Wait, is that right? Let me check. If 100 pages = 1 inch, then yes, one page would be 1/100 inch thick, which is 0.01 inches. So each sheet, which is two pages, would be 0.02 inches thick. But wait, that seems a bit too thin. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Hold on, perhaps each sheet is actually contributing more to the thickness. Let me think again. If a single sheet is printed on both sides, then each sheet is one sheet of paper. But when you stack papers, each sheet adds to the total thickness. But in a book, each sheet is folded into multiple pages. For example, an A4 paper is folded once to make 8 pages. So, maybe each fold doubles the number of pages. But the problem says each paper is printed on both sides, so maybe each sheet adds two pages? Wait, that might not be accurate.

Let me clarify: when you have a sheet of paper, if it's printed on both sides, each side is a single page. So, each sheet of paper can hold two pages, front and back. So, if each sheet is folded, say, once, you can have multiple pages. For example, a single sheet folded once will have 8 pages, because each fold doubles the number of pages. So, each fold increases the number of pages exponentially.

But in this problem, the book is 1.5 inches thick when stacked, and the total number of pages is 100 pages per inch. So, the total thickness of the book is 100 pages * 1.5 inches. Wait, hold on, is that correct? The problem says the book is 100 pages to the inch, so 100 pages per inch.

So, if the book is 1.5 inches thick, then the total number of pages is 100 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 150 pages. Is that the answer? Hmm, that seems straightforward. But I want to make sure I'm not missing something.

Wait, but let me think about the relationship between the number of pages and the thickness. Each sheet of paper contributes to the thickness. So, if each sheet is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes two pages. But does each sheet contribute a certain amount to the thickness?

In a book, each sheet is folded multiple times to create multiple pages. For example, a typical book like a 16-page book is folded 4 times, resulting in 16 pages. So, the number of pages is related to the number of folds. Each fold doubles the number of pages. So, if you have n folds, you have 2^n pages.

But in this case, is the number of folds given, or is the number of pages related to the thickness? The problem says the book is 1.5 inches thick, and each paper is 100 pages to the inch. So, perhaps each sheet of paper contributes 0.01 inches to the thickness because 100 pages equal 1 inch. So, each sheet is 0.01 inches thick.

But wait, a sheet of paper, when folded, actually contributes less to the thickness because multiple pages are on the same sheet. So, each sheet is a single sheet of paper, but when folded multiple times, it can hold more pages. So, in this case, each sheet of paper is 0.01 inches thick, but it can hold multiple pages.

But hold on, the problem says that the book is 1.5 inches thick. So, if each sheet is 0.01 inches thick, how many sheets do we have? Let me calculate that. 1.5 inches divided by 0.01 inches per sheet is 150 sheets. So, 150 sheets. But since each sheet is printed on both sides, the total number of pages is 2 * 150 = 300 pages. Hmm, but wait, the problem says it's 100 pages per inch, so 1.5 inches would be 150 pages? Or 300?

Wait, I'm confused here. Let me clarify the definitions. The problem states: "The book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch." So, 100 pages equal 1 inch. So, 1 inch = 100 pages. Therefore, 1.5 inches would be 100 * 1.5 = 150 pages. So, is that the answer?

But then, another way to think about it is that each sheet is 0.01 inches thick, and 1.5 inches divided by 0.01 inches per sheet is 150 sheets, each sheet contributing two pages, so 300 pages. Wait, this is conflicting.

So, which is it? Is it 150 pages or 300 pages?

Let me try to think of how books are made. A typical book might not fold a single sheet into a single page. Instead, it's folded multiple times to make multiple pages. For example, a 16-page book is made by folding a single sheet 4 times, resulting in 16 pages. So, each fold doubles the number of pages.

Therefore, if each fold doubles the number of pages, the number of pages is 2^n, where n is the number of folds. But in this problem, we have the thickness of the book. So, if each sheet is folded multiple times, each fold adds to the thickness.

So, if each sheet is 0.01 inches thick, then each fold would add another 0.01 inches. So, if the book is 1.5 inches thick, how many folds does it have? 1.5 / 0.01 = 150. So, 150 folds. But each fold doubles the number of pages, so the number of pages would be 2^150. That's an astronomically large number, which doesn't make sense for a book.

Wait, so perhaps my initial assumption that each sheet is 0.01 inches thick is incorrect. Maybe each sheet is just 0.01 inches when it's folded once, but when folded multiple times, the thickness increases exponentially. But in reality, the thickness doesn't increase exponentially because each fold is just adding a small amount.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. If each sheet is 0.01 inches thick, regardless of how many times it's folded, then 1.5 inches / 0.01 inches per sheet = 150 sheets, each contributing two pages, so 300 pages. But that seems too many pages for a book.

Alternatively, maybe the 100 pages per inch is the number of pages per inch when the book is open. So, when the book is open, each sheet contributes 2 pages. So, each inch of thickness corresponds to 100 pages, and each sheet is 0.01 inches thick, so 100 pages per inch divided by 0.01 inches per sheet is 100 / 0.01 = 10,000 pages per sheet. That seems too high.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is just a straightforward conversion. If it's 100 pages per inch, and the book is 1.5 inches thick, then 100 * 1.5 = 150 pages. So, 150 pages. That seems simple, but let me check.

Alternatively, maybe each sheet contributes 100 pages to the thickness, so each sheet is 0.01 inches. So, 1.5 inches divided by 0.01 inches per sheet is 150 sheets. Then, since each sheet is 2 pages, 150 * 2 = 300 pages. But that seems too high.

Wait, perhaps the 100 pages per inch is the number of pages per inch when the book is folded. So, each fold doubles the number of pages. So, to get 1.5 inches, how many folds?

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think in terms of the stack. If I have a single sheet, it's 0.01 inches thick. If I fold it once, it's 0.02 inches. Fold it again, 0.04 inches, and so on. So, the number of folds n relates to the thickness t as t = n * 0.01 inches.

But how does the number of pages relate to the number of folds? Each fold doubles the number of pages. So, if you have n folds, the number of pages is 2^n.

So, if the thickness is t = n * 0.01 inches, which is 1.5 inches. So, 1.5 = n * 0.01 => n = 1.5 / 0.01 = 150. So, number of pages is 2^150, which is a huge number, not practical for a book.

Therefore, that must not be the correct approach.

Wait, maybe the problem is that each sheet is 100 pages to the inch, meaning that each inch of thickness is 100 pages. So, 1 inch thickness corresponds to 100 pages. Therefore, 1.5 inches would correspond to 1.5 * 100 = 150 pages. So, maybe that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe it's 100 pages per inch when the book is open, so each page is 0.01 inches thick. So, 1.5 inches thickness would mean 1.5 / 0.01 = 150 pages. So, same answer.

But wait, if the book is 1.5 inches thick, and each sheet is 100 pages per inch, then it's 150 pages. But that seems too simplistic, but it's the only way I can think to relate the thickness and pages per inch.

Alternatively, maybe the book is 1.5 inches thick, and each sheet is printed on both sides, so each sheet is 0.01 inches thick. So, the number of sheets is 1.5 / 0.01 = 150 sheets. Each sheet is printed on both sides, so 150 * 2 = 300 pages.

But this seems conflicting because if each sheet is 0.01 inches thick, 150 sheets would be 1.5 inches thick, but 150 sheets would produce 300 pages. So, is 300 pages per inch? That seems high.

Wait, the problem says the book is 100 pages per inch when stacked. So, 1 inch corresponds to 100 pages. So, 1.5 inches would be 150 pages. So, that's the answer, 150 pages.

But I need to make sure that this is correct. Let me think of a smaller example. If a book is 1 inch thick, and each sheet is 0.01 inches thick, then the number of sheets is 100. Each sheet is printed on both sides, so 200 pages. But 200 pages in 1 inch. So, 200 pages per inch? But the problem says 100 pages per inch. So, if each sheet is 0.01 inches, then 1 inch / 0.01 inches per sheet = 100 sheets. 100 sheets * 2 pages = 200 pages, which is 200 pages per inch. But the problem says 100 pages per inch. So, this seems contradictory.

Therefore, my initial calculation must be wrong because the number of pages per inch is given, but when trying to compute the number of pages, it's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the thickness of the book is 100 pages in 1 inch, so each inch is 100 pages, so 1.5 inches would be 150 pages. So, 150 pages is the answer.

But in the small example, if the book is 1 inch thick, and each sheet is 0.01 inches, then 1 inch / 0.01 inches per sheet is 100 sheets, each sheet contributing 2 pages, so 200 pages. But the problem says 100 pages per inch, so 100 pages. So, this is inconsistent.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong. Maybe the thickness is 100 pages, but each sheet is folded multiple times to hold multiple pages.

Wait, maybe the book is 100 pages per inch, but each sheet is folded to make 100 pages. So, 1 inch corresponds to 100 pages, so 1.5 inches would be 150 pages.

Alternatively, perhaps each sheet is folded once, so each fold adds another 100 pages. So, 100 pages per inch, 1 inch, 100 pages, 2 inches, 200 pages, and so on. So, 1.5 inches would be 150 pages.

Wait, but if it's folded once, each sheet is 100 pages, but folded once, it's 200 pages. So, maybe 100 pages per inch, 1 inch is 100 pages, 2 inches is 200 pages, and 1.5 inches is 150 pages.

But that seems to be a linear conversion, whereas the actual thickness when folded should be more than linear due to folding.

Wait, but in reality, the thickness when folded is actually less because each fold doubles the thickness. So, if you have a single sheet folded once, the thickness is 0.01 inches, but it holds 200 pages. So, 200 pages per 0.01 inches, which is 20,000 pages per inch. That's way more than 100 pages per inch.

So, that's not matching the problem statement. The problem says 100 pages per inch, so it's a linear relation, not exponential.

Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be a simple conversion, where the number of pages is directly proportional to the thickness. So, 100 pages per inch, 1.5 inches is 150 pages.

But in reality, when you fold a book, the number of pages is not just doubled each time. It's more complicated because of the folding. However, since the problem doesn't specify how the book is folded, it's likely intended to be a straightforward conversion.

So, I think the answer is 150 pages.

Wait, but let me think again. If each sheet is printed on both sides, each sheet is one side of the book. So, each sheet is one side of the page. So, each sheet can hold two pages. So, if you have 100 pages per inch, that's 100 pages per inch. So, each inch corresponds to 100 pages. So, 1.5 inches would be 150 pages.

Alternatively, if each sheet is 0.01 inches thick, and each sheet contributes two pages, then 1.5 inches would be 150 sheets, each contributing two pages, so 300 pages. But that seems too high.

Wait, but perhaps the 100 pages per inch refers to the number of pages per inch when the book is open, meaning each inch of the book is 100 pages. So, 1.5 inches would be 150 pages.

But if the book is folded, then the thickness would be less, but the number of pages would be more. So, perhaps the thickness is the limiting factor. So, 100 pages per inch, so 1.5 inches is 150 pages.

Alternatively, if each sheet is 0.01 inches thick, then 1.5 inches / 0.01 inches per sheet = 150 sheets, each sheet has two pages, so 300 pages.

But since the problem says each paper is printed on both sides, so each sheet is two pages, but the thickness is 0.01 inches per sheet.

So, which one is it?

Wait, maybe the key is that each sheet is 100 pages thick, but wait, no, each sheet is printed on both sides, so each sheet is one side of the book.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about what's being measured. The thickness of the book is given as 100 pages per inch. So, 100 pages correspond to 1 inch in thickness. So, 1.5 inches would be 150 pages.

Alternatively, maybe the 100 pages per inch is the number of pages per inch when the book is folded, so the thickness is 100 pages per inch, but each sheet contributes to the thickness. So, 1.5 inches divided by 0.01 inches per sheet is 150 sheets, each sheet contributing two pages, so 300 pages.

But that seems too high.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the term "pages" as the number of leaves in the book. So, each sheet is a leaf. So, if each leaf is 100 pages, then 1.5 inches would be 150 leaves, each contributing 100 pages, so 150 * 100 = 15,000 pages. That seems too high.

Alternatively, if each sheet is 0.01 inches thick, and each sheet is printed on both sides, then 1.5 inches thickness is 150 sheets, each sheet contributing two pages, so 300 pages. But that also seems too high.

Wait, maybe I need to think about how the number of pages relates to the number of sheets. If each sheet is folded to hold a certain number of pages, then the number of pages is two to the power of the number of folds. So, if 1 inch is 100 pages, then each fold adds a certain number of pages.

Wait, but 100 pages per inch is a linear relationship, not exponential. So, each inch is 100 pages, regardless of folding.

Therefore, 1.5 inches would be 150 pages. So, maybe that's the answer.

Alternatively, the thickness of the book is 100 pages per inch, so 1.5 inches would hold 150 pages, regardless of how it's folded. So, since the book is 1.5 inches thick, and each page is a leaf, so 150 leaves, each leaf is one side of the paper, but each sheet is folded.

Wait, perhaps each sheet is folded so that each fold adds a certain number of pages.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should just read the problem again.

"The book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side. How many pages are in the book, if it is 1.5 inches thick?"

So, the key points:

- Each sheet of paper is printed on both sides.

- When stacked, the book's thickness is 100 pages per inch.

- The book is 1.5 inches thick.

- Each side of the paper is a single page.

So, the key is that each sheet is printed on both sides, so each sheet contributes two pages, but each sheet also contributes to the thickness.

But the problem says that when stacked, the thickness is 100 pages per inch. So, 100 pages per inch is a measure of how much the book is thick when all the pages are together, considering the number of pages.

So, if the book is 1.5 inches thick, and each inch corresponds to 100 pages, then 1.5 inches would be 150 pages. So, 150 pages.

But perhaps, to elaborate, when the book is 1 inch thick, it's 100 pages. So, 1.5 inches would be 150 pages. So, that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the book is 100 pages per inch, so 1 inch is 100 pages, so 1.5 inches is 150 pages.

So, I think the answer is 150 pages. So, I will go with that.

**Final Answer**
The book has \boxed{150} pages.
</think>

The book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Each paper is printed on both sides, meaning each sheet contributes two pages. The book is 1.5 inches thick. 

To determine the number of pages in the book, we consider the given thickness and the number of pages per inch. Each inch of thickness corresponds to 100 pages. Therefore, 1.5 inches of thickness would correspond to:

\[
1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
\]

Thus, the number of pages in the book is \(\boxed{150}\).
