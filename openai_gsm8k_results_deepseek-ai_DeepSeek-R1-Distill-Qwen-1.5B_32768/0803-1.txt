Question:
90 single use contacts come in 1 box and will last Pete 45 days.  Each box is $100.00 and currently 10% off.  If he buys 2 boxes of contact, how much will each pair of contacts cost?

Correct Answer:
Each box of contacts is $100.00 with 10% off so that's 100*.10 = $<<100*.10=10.00>>10.00 off
So the box was $100.00 and he has $10.00 off so each box will cost 100-10 = $<<100-10=90.00>>90.00
He buys 2 boxes and each box costs $90.00 so that's 2*90= $<<2*90=180.00>>180.00
1 box of contacts has 90 contacts and he buys 2 boxes so that's 90*2 = <<90*2=180>>180 contacts
He needs 1 contact for each eye and he has 180 contacts so that's 180/2 = <<180/2=90>>90 pairs of contacts
He spent $180.00 to have 90 pairs of contacts so each pair of contacts costs 180/90 = $<<180/90=2.00>>2.00 a pair

Wrong Answer:
To determine the cost per pair of contacts when buying two boxes, I'll follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the total number of contacts in two boxes. Since each box contains 90 contacts, two boxes will have 90 × 2 = 180 contacts.

2. Next, find out the total cost for two boxes. Each box costs $100, so two boxes will cost 2 × $100 = $200.

3. Finally, divide the total cost by the total number of contacts to find the cost per contact. That is, $200 ÷ 180 ≈ $1.11 per contact.

Therefore, each pair of contacts will cost approximately $1.11.

To determine the cost per pair of contacts when buying two boxes, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Number of contacts per box:** 90
- **Cost per box:** \$100.00
- **Discount:** 10% off
- **Number of boxes bought:** 2

**Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost After Discount**

First, we need to apply the 10% discount to one box.

\[
\text{Discount Amount} = 10\% \times \$100 = 0.10 \times 100 = \$10
\]

\[
\text{Cost per box after discount} = \$100 - \$10 = \$90
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost for Two Boxes**

Since Pete is buying two boxes, we multiply the discounted price of one box by two.

\[
\text{Total Cost for two boxes} = 2 \times \$90 = \$180
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the Cost per Pair of Contacts**

Now, we need to find the cost per pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the total number of contacts.

\[
\text{Total number of contacts} = 90 \text{ contacts/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 180 \text{ contacts}
\]

\[
\text{Cost per contact} = \frac{\text{\$180}}{180 \text{ contacts}} = \$1 \text{ per contact}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\$1}
