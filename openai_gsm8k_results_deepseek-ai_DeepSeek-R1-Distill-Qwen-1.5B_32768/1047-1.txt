Question:
Jordan wanted to surprise her mom with a homemade birthday cake.  From reading the instructions, she knew it would take 20 minutes to make the cake batter and 30 minutes to bake the cake.  The cake would require 2 hours to cool and an additional 10 minutes to frost the cake.  If she plans to make the cake all on the same day, what is the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm?

Correct Answer:
1 hour is 60 minutes so we know that 2 hours to cool the cake is the same as 2*60 so <<2*60=120>>120 min
It will take Jordan 20 min to make the batter, 30 to bake, 120 to cool and 10 to frost so the cake will take 20 +30 +120 +10 = <<20+30+120+10=180>>180 minutes total
Jordan needs to convert 180 minutes to hours so 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours
If the cake needs to be finished by 5:00 pm and it will take 3 hours total to make then 5-3 = <<5-3=2>>2:00 pm is the latest she can start making the cake

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Jordan wants to make a homemade birthday cake and she wants it to be ready at 5:00 pm. There are several tasks involved: making the cake batter, baking the cake, cooling it down, and frosting it. Each of these tasks takes a certain amount of time, and we need to figure out the latest start time so that everything is ready by 5:00 pm.

Let me list out the tasks and their respective times:

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours
4. frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Since Jordan is making all these tasks on the same day, we need to work backwards from the time she wants the cake ready at, which is 5:00 pm. Let's start by figuring out when she needs to start frosting the cake because that's the last task.

Frosting takes 10 minutes, so if she wants it ready at 5:00 pm, she needs to start frosting by 4:50 pm. That seems straightforward.

Next, the cake needs to cool down for 2 hours before she can frost it. If she wants to start frosting at 4:50 pm, she must have started cooling the cake by 2:50 pm. Wait, hold on, is that right? If the cake needs to cool for 2 hours, then the start time would be 2 hours before 5:00 pm. But actually, she wants to finish frosting at 5:00 pm, which includes the cooling time. So, she needs to finish cooling by 4:50 pm, so she can start frosting at 4:50 pm. 

So, the latest start time for the cooling process is 4:50 pm. That means she needs to start cooling the cake by 4:50 pm to finish it by 5:00 pm. But the cooling itself takes 2 hours, which is 2 hours from when she starts cooling. So, subtracting 2 hours from 5:00 pm gives us the latest start time for cooling, which is 4:50 pm.

Now, moving back to the baking time. The cake needs to bake for 30 minutes. So, if she wants to finish cooling by 4:50 pm, she needs to start baking by 4:20 pm. Wait, let me check that again. If she needs to finish cooling by 4:50 pm, and it takes 2 hours to cool, then she needs to start cooling at 4:50 pm minus 2 hours, which is 2:50 pm. Therefore, she can start cooling at 2:50 pm, and the cake will be done at 5:00 pm. That makes sense.

But wait, she can't start cooling until 2:50 pm. So, the latest start time for the cooling process is 2:50 pm. Therefore, the latest start time for baking would be 2:50 pm minus 30 minutes, which is 2:20 pm.

Hold on, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. If she wants to finish cooling by 4:50 pm, she needs to start cooling at 2:50 pm. Therefore, she must finish baking by 4:50 pm. So, the latest start time for baking is 4:50 pm minus 30 minutes, which is 4:20 pm.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because the baking time is 30 minutes, so she needs to finish baking by 5:00 pm. Therefore, she must start baking by 4:30 pm. Wait, no, if she wants to finish baking by 5:00 pm, then she needs to start baking by 5:00 pm minus 30 minutes, which is 4:30 pm. But hold on, she can't start baking until she has finished cooling, right?

So, if she starts baking at 4:30 pm, the cake will be done at 5:00 pm, but she needs to have finished cooling by 4:50 pm. Therefore, she needs to start baking at 4:20 pm, because 4:20 pm plus 30 minutes is 4:50 pm. Then she can start cooling at 2:50 pm, right?

Wait, so if she starts baking at 4:20 pm, then the cake will be done at 4:50 pm, which is the latest time she can finish cooling, and then she can start frosting at 4:50 pm, as planned. That seems correct.

So, to recap:

1. Start frosting at 4:50 pm.
2. Start cooling at 2:50 pm.
3. Start baking at 4:20 pm.
4. Start batter at 3:40 pm.
5. Finish cake at 5:00 pm.

Wait, hold on, if she starts baking at 4:20 pm, which is 20 minutes after 4 pm, then 4:20 pm plus 30 minutes is 4:50 pm. Then she can start cooling at 2:50 pm, and the cake will be done at 5:00 pm. Then she can start frosting at 5:00 pm, but that seems like she would finish immediately. But the question is, what is the latest time she can start making the cake so that it's ready by 5:00 pm.

So, she can start the cake making process at any time before 5:00 pm, but considering the dependencies, the earliest she can start is 3:40 pm, because after that, she has to wait for the batter to be made, then the cake to bake, then to cool, and then to frost.

Wait, let me think again. The cake must be ready by 5:00 pm. So, the latest time she can start the whole process is 5:00 pm. But the dependencies are in between.

So, breaking it down step by step:

1. Start frosting at 4:50 pm. So, the latest start time for frosting is 4:50 pm.

2. Therefore, she must finish cooling by 4:50 pm. So, she can start cooling at 2:50 pm.

3. She needs to finish baking by 4:50 pm because she needs to finish cooling by that time. Therefore, she can start baking at 4:20 pm.

4. Then, she needs to finish making the batter by 4:20 pm. So, she needs to start making the batter 20 minutes before 4:20 pm, which is 4:00 pm minus 20 minutes, which is 3:40 pm.

So, the latest time she can start making the cake is 3:40 pm.

Wait, but hold on. If she starts at 3:40 pm, she will finish the batter at 4:00 pm, then the cake bakes for 30 minutes, finishing at 4:30 pm, then cools for 2 hours, finishing at 5:00 pm, then she can start frosting at 5:00 pm. So, if she starts at 3:40 pm, she finishes at 5:00 pm, which is when she wants it to be ready.

But the question is, what is the latest time she can start making the cake so that it's ready at 5:00 pm. So, 3:40 pm is the earliest she can start, but the latest is... Wait, no, if she starts later, she can still finish at 5:00 pm. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if she starts later, she has to finish earlier. So, she can't start later than 3:40 pm because that's when she needs to finish the batter.

But if she starts making the cake before 3:40 pm, she can start later than 3:40 pm, but still finish at 5:00 pm. Wait, no, because the dependencies are in between. So, she can't start later than 3:40 pm because she needs to finish the batter by 4:20 pm, and she can't start the cake before that. So, 3:40 pm is the latest she can start.

Wait, no, that seems conflicting with my earlier conclusion.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this as a timeline.

Let's denote:

- Start batter at S.

- Then, batter takes 20 minutes, so ends at S + 20.

- Then, cake bakes for 30 minutes, so ends at S + 20 + 30 = S + 50.

- Then, cake cools for 2 hours (120 minutes), so ends at (S + 50) + 120 = S + 170.

- Then, frosting takes 10 minutes, so ends at S + 170 + 10 = S + 180.

She wants S + 180 = 5:00 pm.

So, S = 5:00 pm - 180 minutes.

180 minutes is 3 hours, so 5:00 pm minus 3 hours is 2:00 pm.

Wait, so is the latest time she can start making the cake 2:00 pm? But that seems conflicting with my earlier conclusion.

Wait, hold on, I'm getting confused here. Let's write it step by step.

If she wants to finish by 5:00 pm, then:

Start of frosting: 5:00 pm - 10 minutes = 4:50 pm.

Start of cooling: 4:50 pm - 2 hours = 2:50 pm.

Start of baking: 2:50 pm - 30 minutes = 2:20 pm.

Start of batter: 2:20 pm - 20 minutes = 2:00 pm.

So, yes, if she starts at 2:00 pm, she can finish everything by 5:00 pm.

But if she starts later than 2:00 pm, she can still finish by 5:00 pm. So, what is the latest time she can start?

Wait, 5:00 pm is the finish time, so starting at 2:00 pm and finishing at 5:00 pm is the latest start time. But if she starts earlier than 2:00 pm, she can still finish by 5:00 pm.

But the question is, what is the latest time she can start making the cake so that it's ready at 5:00 pm. So, the latest start time is 2:00 pm, because starting any later would still make her finish by 5:00 pm.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because if she starts at 2:00 pm, she can make everything by 5:00 pm. If she starts at 2:00 pm, she has exactly 3 hours from start to finish. If she starts at 2:01 pm, she has 2 hours and 59 minutes, so she can still finish at 5:00 pm.

So, the latest start time is 2:00 pm because starting any later would make her finish before 5:00 pm, but she needs to finish by 5:00 pm. So, starting at 2:00 pm is the latest time she can start making the cake.

Wait, but that contradicts my initial thought where I thought 3:40 pm was the latest start time.

Wait, maybe I was confused earlier.

Let me lay it out step by step.

If she wants the cake ready at 5:00 pm, she must finish all tasks by that time.

So:

1. Start frosting at 4:50 pm (10 minutes before 5:00 pm).

2. Start cooling at 2:50 pm (2 hours before 5:00 pm).

3. Start baking at 2:20 pm (30 minutes before 2:50 pm).

4. Start batter at 2:00 pm (20 minutes before 2:20 pm).

Therefore, the latest time she can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

Wait, but then if she starts at 2:00 pm, she would finish at 5:00 pm. If she starts at 2:01 pm, she would finish at 5:00 pm as well, but that's 1 minute later.

So, in that case, 2:00 pm is the latest start time because starting any later would still finish at 5:00 pm.

Wait, but if she starts at 2:00 pm, she can't start later because she can't finish earlier. So, 2:00 pm is the latest start time.

But that seems counterintuitive because in the earlier step-by-step, I thought she could start at 3:40 pm.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Let me model it as a timeline.

Let’s denote S as the start time.

1. batter: S + 20 min

2. bake: S + 20 + 30 min = S + 50 min

3. cool: S + 50 + 120 min = S + 170 min

4. frost: S + 170 + 10 min = S + 180 min

She wants S + 180 min = 5:00 pm

So, S = 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

So, that seems to confirm that 2:00 pm is the latest start time.

But let's think another way. Suppose she starts at 2:00 pm, she can make the cake, it will take 20 minutes, so it's ready at 2:20 pm. Then, it bakes for 30 minutes, so it's done at 2:50 pm. Then it cools for 2 hours, so at 5:00 pm. Then she can frost it immediately.

Wait, if she starts at 2:00 pm, she can finish at 5:00 pm. So, she can’t start later than 2:00 pm because that would make her finish earlier.

Wait, but that's confusing because if she starts at 2:00 pm, she can't start later because she needs to finish by 5:00 pm.

But actually, if she starts earlier, she can still finish by 5:00 pm.

Wait, no, no, she needs to finish by 5:00 pm, but she can start earlier. So, the latest time she can start is 2:00 pm, because starting any later would mean she has to finish before 5:00 pm, but she needs to finish at or before 5:00 pm.

So, the latest time she can start is 2:00 pm.

But that seems too early, because if she starts at 2:00 pm, she can make everything by 5:00 pm. If she starts later, she still can finish at 5:00 pm, but she can't start too late because she can't finish before 5:00 pm.

Wait, so 2:00 pm is the latest start time. That makes sense because she needs to finish at 5:00 pm, so the latest she can start is 2:00 pm.

Wait, but 2:00 pm is not the latest start time, because she can start earlier and still finish at 5:00 pm. So, the latest start time is 2:00 pm, but that's not the same as the earliest start time.

Wait, no. The latest start time is the time when she can start making the cake such that she finishes by 5:00 pm. So, 2:00 pm is the latest start time because starting any later would make her finish before 5:00 pm, but she needs to finish by 5:00 pm.

So, 2:00 pm is the latest time she can start making the cake.

Wait, but that seems too early because if she starts at 2:00 pm, she can make the cake, it will take 20 minutes, so it's ready at 2:20 pm, then it bakes for 30 minutes, so it's done at 2:50 pm, then it cools for 2 hours, so at 5:00 pm, and then she can frost it immediately.

But in that case, she can start earlier than 2:00 pm as long as she finishes by 5:00 pm.

So, perhaps my earlier conclusion is wrong.

Wait, let me model this as a schedule.

Let’s define each task as a duration and the time it must be done.

1. Baking starts at S and takes 30 minutes, ends at S + 30.

2. Cooling starts at Baking_end + 120 minutes, ends at Cooling_end.

3. Frosting starts at Cooling_end + 10 minutes, ends at frosting_end.

4. Total time from S to frosting_end is 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

She wants frosting_end ≤ 5:00 pm.

Thus, S + 180 ≤ 5:00 pm.

So, S ≤ 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest start time is 2:00 pm.

But if she starts at 2:00 pm, she can finish at 5:00 pm.

If she starts at 2:01 pm, she'll finish at 5:01 pm, which is later than 5:00 pm, which is not desired.

Therefore, the latest start time is 2:00 pm.

But that seems counterintuitive because if she starts at 2:00 pm, she can make the cake as soon as possible, but if she wants to make it as late as possible, she can start late, but still finish at 5:00 pm.

Wait, but the question says, "the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm."

So, she needs to start making it as late as possible, but still finish by 5:00 pm. So, that's 2:00 pm.

But that seems conflicting with some of my initial thoughts.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of it as:

The time you can start making the cake is 5:00 pm minus the total time required for all tasks.

So, the total time is 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes, which is 3 hours.

Therefore, she can start at 5:00 pm minus 3 hours, which is 2:00 pm.

So, that's consistent.

Therefore, the latest time she can start making is 2:00 pm.

But wait, that seems too early because if she starts at 2:00 pm, she can make the cake, and it's ready at 5:00 pm.

But she can start earlier, like 2:00 pm minus some minutes, and still finish by 5:00 pm.

So, the latest time she can start is 2:00 pm.

But that seems too quick. Let me see.

Wait, 20 minutes to make the batter, 30 minutes to bake, 2 hours to cool, 10 minutes to frost.

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

So, she needs to start at 5:00 pm minus 3 hours, which is 2:00 pm.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the latest start time is 2:00 pm.

So, the answer is 2:00 pm.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive because if she starts at 2:00 pm, she can make the cake, it will be ready at 2:20 pm, then it bakes for 30 minutes, so 2:50 pm, cools for 2 hours to 5:00 pm, and then she can frost it immediately.

So, she's starting at 2:00 pm, finishing at 5:00 pm.

But if she starts later, like 3:00 pm, she would finish at 6:00 pm, which is too late.

Therefore, 2:00 pm is the latest time she can start.

Wait, but is that correct? Because 2:00 pm plus 20 minutes is 2:20 pm, which is when the batter is done.

Wait, no, the batter is made at 2:00 pm, and it takes 20 minutes, so it's ready at 2:20 pm.

So, she can't start making it at 2:00 pm because that would make it ready at 2:20 pm, then it bakes for 30 minutes, so 2:50 pm, then cools for 2 hours to 5:00 pm, then she can frost it at 5:00 pm.

Wait, so if she starts at 2:00 pm, she can make the cake, finish it at 2:20 pm, then it takes 30 minutes to bake, so it's done at 2:50 pm, then it cools for 2 hours, so at 5:00 pm, then she can frost it immediately.

So, she can start at 2:00 pm and finish at 5:00 pm.

Alternatively, if she starts at 2:01 pm, she finishes at 5:01 pm, which is too late.

Therefore, the latest time she can start is 2:00 pm.

So, the answer is 2:00 pm.

Wait, but then if she starts at 2:00 pm, she can make the cake, it's ready at 2:20 pm, then it takes 30 minutes to bake, so it's done at 2:50 pm, then it cools for 2 hours to 5:00 pm, then she can frost it at 5:00 pm.

So, that's 2:00 pm start, 5:00 pm finish.

That seems correct.

But then, if you think about the dependencies, the earliest you can start is 3:40 pm, because she needs to finish the batter by 4:20 pm, so she can't start before 3:40 pm.

But the latest start time is 2:00 pm because she can start as late as 2:00 pm and still finish at 5:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest start time is 2:00 pm.

So, that's the answer.

But wait, to make sure, let's think of it as:

If she wants to finish by 5:00 pm, she must start at 5:00 pm minus the total time.

Total time is 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

180 minutes is 3 hours.

Therefore, 5:00 pm minus 3 hours is 2:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest start time is 2:00 pm.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the answer is 2:00 pm.

**Final Answer**
The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is \boxed{2:00\ \text{pm}}.
</think>

To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we need to consider the time required for each task and the dependencies between them.

1. **Baking time**: 30 minutes
2. **Cooling time**: 2 hours
3. **Frosting time**: 10 minutes
4. **Batter time**: 20 minutes

Starting from the latest time (5:00 pm), we need to work backwards to find the latest start time for each task.

1. **Frosting**: Must finish by 5:00 pm. The latest start time for frosting is 5:00 pm - 10 minutes = 4:50 pm.
2. **Cooling**: Must finish before 4:50 pm. The latest start time for cooling is 4:50 pm - 2 hours = 2:50 pm.
3. **Baking**: Must finish before 2:50 pm. The latest start time for baking is 2:50 pm - 30 minutes = 2:20 pm.
4. **Batter**: Must finish before 2:20 pm. The latest start time for making the cake is 2:20 pm - 20 minutes = 2:00 pm.

Thus, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is \boxed{2:00\ \text{pm}}.
