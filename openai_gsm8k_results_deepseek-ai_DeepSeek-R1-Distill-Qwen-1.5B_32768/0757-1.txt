Question:
A hospital sees 500 people a day.  Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.  The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital and the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour.  How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?

Correct Answer:
The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day
That means they see patients for 12000/60=<<12000/60=200>>200 hours a day
They profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour
So they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits

Wrong Answer:
First, calculate the total number of patient visits per hour by multiplying the daily patient volume by the number of hours in a day, which is 24. This gives 12,000 patient visits per hour.

Next, determine the total cost to the hospital by multiplying the number of patient visits by the hourly charge per visit, resulting in $240,000 per hour.

Then, find the total earnings from the patients by multiplying the total patient visits by the hourly rate charged to the patients, which is $4,800 per hour.

Finally, calculate the profit by subtracting the hospital's total cost from its total earnings, resulting in a profit of $192,000 per hour.

To determine the hospital's profit from patient visits, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Patient Visits per Hour:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total visits per hour} = \text{Daily patient volume} \times \text{Hours in a day} = 500 \times 24 = 12,\!000 \text{ visits}
   \]

2. **Determine the Total Cost to the Hospital:**
   
   \[
   \text{Hospital cost per hour} = \text{Total visits per hour} \times \text{Hourly charge} = 12,\!000 \times \$150 = \$1,\!800,\!000
   \]

3. **Find the Total Earnings from Patients:**
   
   \[
   \text{Patient earnings per hour} = \text{Total visits per hour} \times \text{Hourly charge} = 12,\!000 \times \$200 = \$2,\!400,\!000
   \]

4. **Calculate the Profit:**
   
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Patient earnings per hour} - \text{Hospital cost per hour} = \$2,\!400,\!000 - \$1,\!800,\!000 = \$600,\!000
   \]

\[
\boxed{\$600,\!000}
\]
