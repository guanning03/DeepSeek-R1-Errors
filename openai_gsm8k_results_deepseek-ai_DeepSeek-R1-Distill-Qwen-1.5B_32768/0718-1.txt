Question:
Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. This means that each hour the AC uses 900 watts of energy. If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, how many kilowatts of electric energy will he save in 30 days?

Correct Answer:
An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.
An air conditioner uses 900 x 5 = <<900*5=4500>>4500 watts for 5 hours a day.
So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.
Hence, in 30 days he will have 2.7 x 30 = <<2.7*30=81>>81 kilowatts of electric energy saved.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total energy used by the air conditioner over 30 days with the original usage. The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour, and it's used for 8 hours each day. 

Next, I'll calculate the daily energy consumption by multiplying the power by the time: 900 watts * 8 hours = 7,200 watt-hours per day.

Then, I'll find the total energy used over 30 days by multiplying the daily consumption by 30: 7,200 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 216,000 watt-hours.

After that, I'll determine the new daily usage after reducing the usage by 5 hours: 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours per day.

I'll then calculate the new daily energy consumption with the reduced usage: 900 watts * 3 hours = 2,700 watt-hours per day.

Finally, I'll find the total energy saved over 30 days by subtracting the new daily consumption from the original total consumption: 216,000 watt-hours - 81,000 watt-hours = 135,000 watt-hours.

Since the question asks for the answer in kilowatts, I'll convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours by dividing by 1,000: 135,000 watt-hours / 1,000 = 135 kilowatt-hours.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Power of the air conditioner = 900 watts
- Original usage time per day = 8 hours
- Reduction in usage = 5 hours per day
- Duration for which the energy is saved = 30 days

**Step 1: Calculate the original daily energy consumption.**

\[
\text{Daily Energy} = \text{Power} \times \text{Time} = 900\ \text{watts} \times 8\ \text{hours} = 7,200\ \text{watt-hours}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the new usage time per day.**

\[
\text{New Time per day} = 8\ \text{hours} - 5\ \text{hours} = 3\ \text{hours}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the new daily energy consumption.**

\[
\text{New Daily Energy} = 900\ \text{watts} \times 3\ \text{hours} = 2,700\ \text{watt-hours}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total original energy consumption over 30 days.**

\[
\text{Total Original Energy} = 7,200\ \text{watt-hours/day} \times 30\ \text{days} = 216,000\ \text{watt-hours}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the total new energy consumption over 30 days.**

\[
\text{Total New Energy} = 2,700\ \text{watt-hours/day} \times 30\ \text{days} = 81,000\ \text{watt-hours}
\]

**Step 6: Calculate the energy saved.**

\[
\text{Energy Saved} = \text{Total Original Energy} - \text{Total New Energy} = 216,000\ \text{watt-hours} - 81,000\ \text{watt-hours} = 135,000\ \text{watt-hours}
\]

**Step 7: Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours.**

\[
135,000\ \text{watt-hours} = \frac{135,000}{1,000} = 135\ \text{kilowatt-hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{135\ \text{kW}}
\]
