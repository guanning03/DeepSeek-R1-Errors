Question:
Jenna has 4 roommates. Each month the electricity bill is $100. How much will each roommate pay per year for electricity, if they divide the share equally?

Correct Answer:
There are 12 months in a year, so the total electricity for the year will cost 100*12 =$<<100*12=1200>>1200.
Since there are 5 roommates, each roommate will pay 1200/5=$<<1200/5=240>>240 in a year.
#### 240

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total electricity bill for the year. Since the bill is $100 each month and there are 12 months in a year, I multiply 100 by 12 to get the annual bill.

Next, I'll determine how much each roommate will pay by dividing the total annual bill by the number of roommates, which is 4.

Finally, I'll present the amount each roommate pays per year.

**Solution:**

Jenna has 4 roommates, and they agree to divide the electricity bill equally for the year. Here's how we can calculate the amount each roommate will pay:

1. **Calculate the annual electricity bill:**
   
   - Monthly bill: \$100
   - Number of months in a year: 12
   - **Annual bill** = Monthly bill × Number of months
   - **Annual bill** = \$100 × 12 = \$1,200

2. **Divide the annual bill equally among the 4 roommates:**
   
   - **Amount per roommate** = Annual bill ÷ Number of roommates
   - **Amount per roommate** = \$1,200 ÷ 4 = \$300

**Final Answer:**

Each roommate will pay \(\boxed{\$300}\) per year for electricity.
