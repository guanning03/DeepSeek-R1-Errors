Question:
Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins, Dallas and Darla.  If Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them in the playground, how many did Mazie give to Darla?

Correct Answer:
Mazie gave Dallas 21 + 4 = <<21+4=25>>25 marbles.
Darla has 52 - 25 = <<52-25=27>>27 marbles.
#### 27

Wrong Answer:
First, Mazie starts with a total of 52 marbles. These marbles are divided equally between Dallas and Darla, so each twin initially receives 26 marbles.

Next, Dallas drops 4 of his marbles in the playground. Therefore, Dallas has 26 - 4 = 22 marbles remaining.

The problem states that Dallas has 21 marbles after the drop. This means that an additional marble is needed in Dallas's count to reach 21 marbles. So, Darla must have received this extra marble.

Since the marbles were divided equally, Darla would also have the same number of marbles as Dallas after the drop. Therefore, Darla received 21 marbles.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total marbles Mazie has: 52
- Marbles are divided equally between Dallas and Darla.
- After dropping 4 marbles, Dallas has 21 marbles.

**Let's denote:**
- Marbles given to Dallas initially: \( D \)
- Marbles given to Darla initially: \( Darla \)

Since the marbles are divided equally:
\[
D = Darla = \frac{52}{2} = 26
\]

**After dropping 4 marbles:**
\[
\text{Marbles Dallas has} = D - 4 = 26 - 4 = 22
\]

But according to the problem, Dallas has 21 marbles after the drop. This means that an additional marble is needed to reach 21. Since the marbles were initially divided equally, Darla must have received this extra marble.

**Therefore:**
\[
Darla = 21
\]

\[
\boxed{21}
\]
