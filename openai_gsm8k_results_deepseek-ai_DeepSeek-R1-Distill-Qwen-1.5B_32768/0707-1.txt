Question:
Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?

Correct Answer:
She trades 27 small stickers because 30 x .9 = <<27=27>>27
She gets 9 large buttons for these because 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9
She trades 20 large stickers for large buttons because 40 x .5 = 20
She gets 20 large buttons for these because 20 / 1 = <<20/1=20>>20
She trades 50% of her large stickers for small buttons because 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50
She trades 20 large stickers for small buttons because 40 x .5 = 20
She gets 60 small buttons because 20 x 3 = <<20*3=60>>60
She has 89 buttons at the end because 9 + 20 + 60 = <<9+20+60=89>>89
#### 89

Wrong Answer:
First, I will determine how many large buttons Lorraine receives from trading 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. Each small sticker is worth one large button, so 90% of 40 small stickers equals 36 large buttons.

Next, I will calculate how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. Lorraine has 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them, which is 20 large stickers, resulting in 20 large buttons.

Finally, she trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small stickers, so 20 large stickers yield 60 small buttons.

Now, I will sum up all the buttons she has at the end. She has 36 large buttons and 60 small buttons, totaling 96 buttons.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has at the end.

### **Initial Information**
- **Large Sticker Value:** Each large sticker is worth **1 large button or 3 small buttons.**
- **Small Sticker Value:** Each small sticker is worth **1 small button.**
- **Large Button Value:** Each large button is worth **3 small stickers.**

### **Lorraine's Initial Stickers**
- **Small Stickers:** 40
- **Large Stickers:** 30

### **Step 1: Trading 90% of Small Stickers for Large Buttons**
- **Number of Small Stickers Traded:** \( 90\% \) of 40 = \( 0.9 \times 40 = 36 \) small stickers.
- **Large Buttons Received:** Each small sticker is worth 1 large button, so she gets **36 large buttons.**

### **Step 2: Trading 50% of Large Stickers for Large Buttons**
- **Number of Large Stickers Traded:** \( 50\% \) of 30 = \( 0.5 \times 30 = 15 \) large stickers.
- **Large Buttons Received:** 15 large stickers yield **15 large buttons.**

### **Step 3: Trading the Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons**
- **Remaining Large Stickers:** \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) large stickers.
- **Small Buttons Received:** Each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, so \( 15 \times 3 = 45 \) small buttons.

### **Total Buttons Lorraine Has**
- **Large Buttons:** 36
- **Small Buttons:** 45

\[
\text{Total Buttons} = 36 \text{ (large)} + 45 \text{ (small)} = \boxed{81}
\]
