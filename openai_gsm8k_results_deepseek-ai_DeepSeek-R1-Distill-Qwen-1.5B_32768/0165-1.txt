Question:
The Doubtfire sisters are driving home with 7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter when their mother calls to inform them that their two house cats have just had kittens. She says that Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, while Trixie, the other cat, has had 12. How many kittens does the Doubtfire family now have?

Correct Answer:
Patchy has just had 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 kittens
Since Trixie's kittens are 12, both cats have 21 +12 = <<21+12=33>>33 kittens.
Combining the adopted kittens with those from the two cats, the Doubtfire family now has 7 + 33 = <<7+33=40>>40 kittens.

Wrong Prediction:
55

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many kittens Patchy and Trixie have had. The problem states that Patchy has had three times the number of adopted kittens that Trixie has had. Since Trixie has had 12 kittens, I can calculate the number of kittens Patchy has had by multiplying 12 by 3.

Next, I'll add the number of kittens both Patchy and Trixie have had to the original 7 kittens that the Doubtfire sisters had. This will give me the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Kittens Adopted:**
   - Trixie has had **12** kittens.
   - Patchy has had **3 times** the number of adopted kittens that Trixie has had.

2. **Calculating the Number of Kittens Patchy has Had:**
   \[
   \text{Kittens by Patchy} = 3 \times \text{Kittens by Trixie} = 3 \times 12 = 36
   \]

3. **Total Number of Kittens:**
   - The Doubtfire family originally had **7** kittens.
   - Adding the kittens adopted by both sisters:
   \[
   \text{Total Kittens} = 7 + 12 + 36 = 55
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{55}
\]
