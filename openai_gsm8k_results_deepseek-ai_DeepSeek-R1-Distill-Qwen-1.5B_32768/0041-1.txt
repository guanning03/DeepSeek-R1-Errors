Question:
Courtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number. However, Kelly went to the same concert and said that Courtney had made the mistake of overstating the number of people in attendance by 20%. If Kelly was right, how many people really attended the concert?

Correct Answer:
Since she overstated the number by 20%, 48 is 20% greater than the actual number i.e. 48 = 100% + 20% = 120% of the actual number = 120/100 of the actual number
Therefore, the actual number = (100/120)*48 = <<(100/120)*48=40>>40
#### 40

Gold:
40

Wrong Prediction:
38

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine the number of people who attended the concert based on Courtney's report. She mentioned 48 people, but Kelly pointed out that this was overstated by 20%.

To find the actual number of attendees, I'll calculate 20% of Courtney's number, which is 20% of 48. This equals 9.6.

Since the overstated number is 20%, the actual number is 80% of 48, which is 38.4.

However, the number of people attending a concert must be a whole number. Therefore, rounding 38.4 to the nearest whole number gives 38.

So, the real number of people who attended the concert is 38.

To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Courtney's Report:**
   - Courtney said there were **48** people in attendance.
   
2. **Kelly's Observation:**
   - Kelly noted that Courtney overstated the number by **20%**.
   
3. **Calculating the Overstatement:**
   - To find 20% of 48:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 48 = 0.20 \times 48 = 9.6
     \]
   
4. **Determining the Actual Number:**
   - Since 9.6 is the overstatement, the actual number of attendees is 48 minus this overstatement:
     \[
     48 - 9.6 = 38.4
     \]
   
5. **Rounding to the Nearest Whole Number:**
   - Since the number of people must be a whole number, we round 38.4 to the nearest whole number.
   
   \[
   \boxed{38}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The real number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{38}\).
