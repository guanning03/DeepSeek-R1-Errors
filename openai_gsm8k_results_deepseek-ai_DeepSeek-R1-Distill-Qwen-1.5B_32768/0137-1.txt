Question:
Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute and saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp?

Correct Answer:
First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes
Then find how many batches of shrimp she needs to cook: 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/batch = <<90/30=3>>3 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 30 minutes + 15 minutes = <<30+15=45>>45 minutes
#### 45

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so dividing 90 by 6 gives 15 minutes for peeling.

Next, I'll calculate the time it takes to sauté 90 shrimp. She sautes 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To sauté 90 shrimp, I can divide 90 by 30 to find out how many batches she needs to make, which is 3. Multiplying this by 10 minutes gives 30 minutes for sautéing.

Finally, I'll add the peeling time and sautéing time together to find the total time required. 15 minutes for peeling plus 30 minutes for sautéing equals 45 minutes.

**Solution:**

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute and sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To determine how long it will take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Time to Peel 90 Shrimp:**

   \[
   \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Number of Shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp Peeled per Minute}} = \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Time to Sauté 90 Shrimp:**

   Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp:

   \[
   \text{Number of Batches} = \frac{\text{Total Shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp Sauté per Batch}} = \frac{90}{30} = 3 \text{ batches}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Time to Sauté} = \text{Number of Batches} \times \text{Time per Batch} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Time:**

   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{Time to Peel} + \text{Time to Sauté} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{45\ \text{minutes}}
\]
