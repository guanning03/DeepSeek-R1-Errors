Tokens: 401.0

Question:
Mark's car breaks down and he needs to get a new radiator.  The cost for a new radiator is $400 but he goes to get it at a junk shop and gets it for 80% off.  He then hires a mechanic to install it and it takes 3 hours at $50 an hour.  How much did he pay?

Correct Answer:
The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320
So he paid 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80
The mechanic charges 3*50=$<<3*50=150>>150
So in total he paid 80+150=$<<80+150=230>>230
#### 230

Wrong Answer:
First, mark pays $400 for a new radiator. He finds a junk shop that offers a 20% discount on the original price of $400, which is $80. Therefore, the cost at the junk shop is $400 minus $80, totaling $320.

Next, the mechanic takes 3 hours to install the radiator at a rate of $50 per hour. This amounts to 3 times $50, which equals $150.

Finally, to find the total cost, mark adds the cost of the radiator from the junk shop and the labor cost for installation, resulting in $320 plus $150, totaling $470.

**Solution:**

1. **Cost of the Radiator:**
   
   The original price of the radiator is \$400. 
   
   Mark buys it at a 20% discount through a junk shop.
   
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 20\% \times \$400 = \$80
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Cost at Junk Shop} = \$400 - \$80 = \$320
   \]

2. **Cost of Mechanic's Installation:**
   
   The mechanic takes 3 hours to install the radiator at a rate of \$50 per hour.
   
   \[
   \text{Labor Cost} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$50/\text{hour} = \$150
   \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost at Junk Shop} + \text{Labor Cost} = \$320 + \$150 = \$470
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{470}
\]
