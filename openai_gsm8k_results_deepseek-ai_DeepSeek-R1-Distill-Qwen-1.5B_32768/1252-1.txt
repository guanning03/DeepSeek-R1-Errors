Question:
The Hortex company produces bottled carrot juices. Every day it can produce 4200 bottles of these juices. Each juice can cover 20% of 1 person'ts daily energy demand. How many more bottles of juices would Hortex have to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people?

Correct Answer:
Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.
So 2300 people, need 5 * 2300 = <<2300*5=11500>>11500 juices for this purpose.
To cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.

Gold:
7300

Wrong Prediction:
-1900

Wrong Answer:
First, determine how much energy demand each person has per day. Since each juice covers 20% of a person's energy needs, one juice provides 20% of the daily energy requirement.

Next, calculate the total energy demand for 2300 people. Multiply the number of people by the energy coverage per juice: 2300 ร 20% = 460.

Then, find out how many juices Hortex needs to produce to meet this total energy demand. Divide the total energy by the coverage per juice: 460 รท 20% = 2300 juices.

Finally, subtract the number of juices Hortex currently produces from the total needed to find out how many more juices are required: 2300 - 4200 = -1900. Since the result is negative, Hortex already meets the energy demand for 2300 people.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Daily production capacity of Hortex company:** 4200 bottles of carrot juice per day
- **Each juice covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand**

**Objective:**
Find out how many **additional bottles** Hortex needs to produce to satisfy **100%** of the daily energy needs of **2300** people.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   
   Since each juice covers **20%** of a person's energy, one juice provides:
   \[
   0.20 \times \text{Person's Daily Energy Demand}
   \]
   
   For 2300 people, the total daily energy demand is:
   \[
   2300 \times 0.20 = 460
   \]
   
   So, 460 units of energy are needed daily for 2300 people.

2. **Determine how many juices are needed to meet this energy demand:**
   
   Since each juice provides 0.20 units of energy, the number of juices required (\( N \)) is:
   \[
   N = \frac{460}{0.20} = 2300
   \]
   
   Therefore, Hortex needs to produce **2300** juices daily to satisfy the energy needs of 2300 people.

3. **Calculate how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce:**
   
   Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed:
   \[
   2300 - 4200 = -1900
   \]
   
   Since the result is negative, it indicates that Hortex already meets the energy demand for 2300 people.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{-1900}
\]

This means Hortex **already** satisfies the daily energy needs of 2300 people by producing **4200 bottles**, which is more than sufficient.
