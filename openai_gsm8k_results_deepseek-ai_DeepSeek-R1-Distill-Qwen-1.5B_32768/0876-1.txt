Question:
There are four birds at the Caboose. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, what's the total age of the four birds?

Correct Answer:
If Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, same as Sally four, their total age 8+8 = <<8+8=16>>16 years.
Granny red is two times as old as Sally four, meaning Granny red is 2*8 = <<2*8=16>>16 years old.
Sally Thirtytwo, Sally four, and Sally red are 16+16 = <<32=32>>32 years old.
Sally two is three years older than Granny red, meaning Sally two is 16+3= <<16+3=19>>19 years old.
The four birds have a total age of 32+19 = <<32+19=51>>51 years old.
#### 51

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the ages of each bird based on the given information.

Sally Thirtytwo is stated to be 8 years old.

Sally Four is mentioned to be the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, which means Granny Red is 2 multiplied by 8, resulting in 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Since Granny Red is 16, Sally Two is 16 plus 3, totaling 19 years old.

Finally, to find the total age of all four birds, I add up the ages of Sally Four, Sally Twenty-two, Granny Red, and Sally Two: 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 equals 41 years.

Let's determine the total age of the four birds step by step.

1. **Sally Thirtytwo**:
   - **Age**: 8 years

2. **Sally Four**:
   - **Age**: Same as Sally Thirtytwo
   - **Total Age**: \(8 \text{ years}\)

3. **Granny Red**:
   - **Age**: Two times as old as Sally Four
   - **Calculation**: \(2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years}\)

4. **Sally Two**:
   - **Age**: Three years older than Granny Red
   - **Calculation**: \(16 + 3 = 19 \text{ years}\)

5. **Total Age of All Four Birds**:
   - **Sum**: \(8 \text{ (Sally Thirtytwo)} + 8 \text{ (Sally Four)} + 16 \text{ (Granny Red)} + 19 \text{ (Sally Two)}\)
   - **Result**: \(8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 41 \text{ years}\)

\[
\boxed{41}
\]
