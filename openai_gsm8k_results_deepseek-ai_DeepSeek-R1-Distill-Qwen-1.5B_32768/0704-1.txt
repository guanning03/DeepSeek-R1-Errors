Question:
Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each and three makeup sets that came with six eyeshadow colors each. Her sister steals one of the palettes. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. How many eyeshadow colors does she have left?

Correct Answer:
Amy had 2 * 4 + 3 * 6 = 8 + 18 = <<2*4+3*6=26>>26 eyeshadow colors to start.
Her sister stole one palette of 4 colors, leaving Amy with 26 - 4 = <<26-4=22>>22 colors.
Half the colors from one makeup set are 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 colors.
Thus, Amy has 22 - 3 = <<22-3=19>>19 eyeshadow colors left.
#### 19

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had. She has two eyeshadow palettes, each containing four colors. That gives her 2 multiplied by 4, which is 8 colors.

Next, her sister steals one of the palettes, leaving her with one full palette of four colors and the other palette untouched, which still has four colors. So, after the theft, Amy has a total of 8 colors.

Then, Amy's sister steals one of the makeup sets. Each makeup set includes six eyeshadow colors, so stealing one set removes six colors.

Finally, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Using half of six colors means she uses three colors from that set. Subtracting three colors from the total, Amy now has 8 minus 3, which equals 5 colors left.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left after her sister steals one makeup set.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - **Amy's Eyeshadow Palettes:**
     - Each palette has **4 colors**.
     - She has **2 palettes**.
     - **Total colors from palettes:** \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.

   - **Amy's Makeup Sets:**
     - Each set contains **6 colors**.
     - She has **3 makeup sets**.
     - **Total colors from makeup sets:** \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

2. **Sister Steals One Makeup Set:**
   - The sister steals one makeup set, which contains **6 colors**.
   - **Colors remaining in makeup sets:** \(18 - 6 = 12\) colors.

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of One Makeup Set:**
   - From the stolen makeup set, Amy uses **half of the colors**.
   - **Colors used:** \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) colors.
   - **Colors remaining in makeup set:** \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors.

4. **Total Eyeshadow Colors Left:**
   - **Colors from palettes:** \(8\) (unchanged).
   - **Colors from makeup sets after use:** \(3\).
   - **Total colors left:** \(8 + 3 = 11\).

\(\boxed{11}\)
