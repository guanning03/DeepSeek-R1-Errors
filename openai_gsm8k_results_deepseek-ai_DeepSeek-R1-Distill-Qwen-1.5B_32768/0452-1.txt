Question:
Ben bought a car for $20000 in 2007. The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. Find the price of the car in the year 2010.

Correct Answer:
The price of the car depreciates of 20000 * 21% = $<<20000*21*.01=4200>>4200 per year.
Ben had the car for 2010 - 2007 = <<2010-2007=3>>3 years.
The price of the car depreciates 4200 * 3 = $<<4200*3=12600>>12600 from 2007 to 2010.
So the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.
#### 7400

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007, and it's depreciating at a constant rate of 21% per year. I need to find out how much the car will cost in 2010. Hmm, depreciation... that means the value of the car is decreasing each year. I remember that depreciation can be modeled using exponential decay, right? So the formula should be something like:

Final Amount = Initial Amount × (1 - rate)^time

Let me write that down. The initial amount is $20,000, the rate is 21% per year, which is 0.21, and the time is from 2007 to 2010. So that's 3 years, right?

Wait, hold on. 2010 minus 2007 is 3 years, so the time is 3. So plugging into the formula, it should be:

Final Amount = 20000 × (1 - 0.21)^3

Let me compute that step by step. First, calculate 1 - 0.21, which is 0.79. Then, raise that to the power of 3. Hmm, 0.79 cubed.

Calculating 0.79 × 0.79 first. Let me do that. 0.79 × 0.79: 79 × 79 is 6241, so with two decimal places, that's 0.6241. Then, multiply that by 0.79 again. So 0.6241 × 0.79. Let me compute that.

First, 0.6241 × 0.7 = 0.43687
Then, 0.6241 × 0.09 = 0.056169
Adding those together: 0.43687 + 0.056169 = 0.493039

So, 0.79 cubed is approximately 0.493039. Now, multiply that by the initial amount of $20,000.

20,000 × 0.493039. Let me compute that. 20,000 × 0.493039. Well, 20,000 × 0.4 is 8,000, and 20,000 × 0.093039 is...

Wait, maybe it's easier to just multiply 20,000 × 0.493039 directly.

20,000 × 0.493039 = (20,000 × 0.4) + (20,000 × 0.093039)
= 8,000 + (20,000 × 0.093039)

Now, 20,000 × 0.09 is 1,800, and 20,000 × 0.003039 is...

Wait, maybe it's better to compute 20,000 × 0.093039 directly.

0.093039 × 20,000. Let's see, 0.09 × 20,000 is 1,800, and 0.003039 × 20,000 is approximately 60.78. So adding those together: 1,800 + 60.78 = 1,860.78.

So, 20,000 × 0.493039 = 8,000 + 1,860.78 = 9,860.78.

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,860.78.

But wait, let me verify if I did the exponentiation correctly. 0.79^3 is indeed 0.493039, and multiplying that by 20,000 gives $9,860.78. Hmm, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach to compute (1 - 0.21)^3.

First, 1 - 0.21 is 0.79.

0.79 × 0.79 is 0.6241, as I did earlier.

Then, 0.6241 × 0.79: Let me do this multiplication step by step.

0.6241 × 0.79:

Multiply 6241 by 79, then move the decimal point four places (since both numbers have four decimal places? Wait, no. 0.6241 is four decimal places, 0.79 is two. So total of six decimal places.

Wait, that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can use another method.

Let me write 6241 × 79.

6241 × 70 = 436,870

6241 × 9 = 56,169

Adding those together: 436,870 + 56,169 = 493,039

So, 6241 × 79 = 493,039.

Now, since we had 0.6241 × 0.79, which is 493,039 divided by 10^6 (because each number has six decimal places: 0.6241 is six decimal places? Wait, no. 0.6241 is four decimal places, 0.79 is two decimal places, so total of six decimal places. So 493,039 / 1,000,000 = 0.493039.

So, yes, that's correct. So 0.79^3 is 0.493039.

Therefore, 20,000 × 0.493039 is indeed approximately $9,860.78.

Wait, but is there another way to compute 0.79^3? Maybe using binomial expansion.

(1 - 0.21)^3 = 1 - 3×0.21 + 3×(0.21)^2 - (0.21)^3

Compute each term:

1 = 1

3×0.21 = 0.63

3×(0.21)^2 = 3×0.0441 = 0.1323

(0.21)^3 = 0.009261

So, putting it together:

1 - 0.63 + 0.1323 - 0.009261

Compute step by step:

1 - 0.63 = 0.37

0.37 + 0.1323 = 0.5023

0.5023 - 0.009261 = 0.493039

Yes, same result as before. So, 0.493039 is correct. So, 20,000 × 0.493039 is 9,860.78.

So, the car's value in 2010 is approximately $9,860.78.

Wait, but let me check if the depreciation is indeed compounded annually at 21% per annum. Since the problem says "constant rate of 21% per year," which is typical for car depreciation, so it's exponential decay with a rate of 21% per year. So, the formula I used is correct.

Alternatively, if it were simple interest, it would be different, but since it's depreciation, it's definitely exponential decay.

Just to double-check, maybe I can compute the value year by year.

Starting in 2007: $20,000

2008: 20,000 × (1 - 0.21) = 20,000 × 0.79 = $15,800

2009: 15,800 × 0.79 = let me compute that.

15,800 × 0.79: 15,800 × 0.7 = 11,060 and 15,800 × 0.09 = 1,422. So total is 11,060 + 1,422 = $12,482

2010: 12,482 × 0.79. Let me compute that.

12,482 × 0.7 = 8,737.4

12,482 × 0.09 = 1,123.38

Adding together: 8,737.4 + 1,123.38 = $9,860.78

So, same result. Therefore, it's confirmed.

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,860.78.

But since we are dealing with currency, it's usually rounded to the nearest cent, which is two decimal places. So, $9,860.78 is correct, as the third decimal is 7, which is more than 5, so we round up the second decimal place from 8 to 9. Wait, hold on, 0.78 + 0.007 = 0.787, which is more than 0.78, but actually, in the calculation, the third decimal was 7, right?

Wait, wait. Let me see: When I multiplied 15,800 × 0.79, I got $12,482. Then, 12,482 × 0.79.

Let me do that calculation again:

12,482 × 0.7 = 8,737.4

12,482 × 0.09 = 1,123.38

Adding together: 8,737.4 + 1,123.38 = $9,860.78

So, that is $9,860.78.

But actually, in the step before, when I calculated 0.79^3, I got 0.493039, which is approximately 0.493, so 20,000 × 0.493 is $9,860.

But to get the precise value, I think it's better to compute 20,000 × 0.493039.

20,000 × 0.493039 = 20,000 × 0.493 + 20,000 × 0.000039

20,000 × 0.493 = 9,860

20,000 × 0.000039 = 0.78

So, total is 9,860 + 0.78 = $9,860.78.

Therefore, $9,860.78 is the precise value.

Alternatively, if we use the formula:

Final Amount = 20,000 × (0.79)^3 = 20,000 × 0.493039 = $9,860.78

So, that's consistent.

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is $9,860.78.

Wait, just to make sure, let me use another method. Maybe using logarithms? Hmm, that might complicate things, but just for verification.

Wait, perhaps not necessary, since the step-by-step computation and the formula both lead to the same result. So, I think it's safe to say that the price in 2010 is $9,860.78.

Alternatively, if I use a calculator, just to be absolutely sure.

Compute 0.79^3: 0.79 × 0.79 = 0.6241, then 0.6241 × 0.79.

Let me do it on calculator:

0.6241 × 0.79:

First, 0.6 × 0.79 = 0.474

0.02 × 0.79 = 0.0158

0.0041 × 0.79 ≈ 0.003239

Adding together: 0.474 + 0.0158 = 0.4898 + 0.003239 ≈ 0.493039

So, 0.79^3 is about 0.493039.

Therefore, 20,000 × 0.493039 = 9,860.78.

Yes, so I can't see any mistake here. So, the final price is $9,860.78.

But just to think, is it possible that the depreciation is compounded annually? So, does that mean that each year, the value is multiplied by 0.79? Yes, that's how it's usually modeled, especially for cars. So, the answer is $9,860.78.

Alternatively, if it's simple interest, the formula would be different, but since it's depreciation, which is exponential, we use the formula with the exponent.

So, in conclusion, after 3 years of depreciation at 21% per annum, the car's value is $9,860.78 in 2010.

**Final Answer**
The price of the car in 2010 is \boxed{9860.78}.
</think>

Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. To find the price of the car in 2010, we use the exponential decay formula:

\[
\text{Final Amount} = \text{Initial Amount} \times (1 - \text{rate})^{\text{time}}
\]

Here, the initial amount is $20,000, the rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the time is 3 years. Plugging in these values, we get:

\[
\text{Final Amount} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3
\]

First, calculate \(1 - 0.21\):

\[
1 - 0.21 = 0.79
\]

Next, raise 0.79 to the power of 3:

\[
0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

\[
0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.6241
\]
\[
0.6241 \times 0.79 = 0.493039
\]

Now, multiply this result by the initial amount:

\[
20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78
\]

Thus, the price of the car in 2010 is:

\[
\boxed{9860.78}
\]
