Question:
John buys milk for 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars.  If there is a 10% tax on all nonfood items how much did everything cost.

Correct Answer:
The foodstuff cost 2+3=$<<2+3=5>>5
The nonfood stuff comes out to 3+3+4=$<<3+3+4=10>>10
Tax on the nonfood stuff comes out to 10*.1=$<<10*.1=1>>1
So the total cost is 5+10+1=$<<5+10+1=16>>16

Wrong Prediction:
9.90

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll identify the cost of each item before tax.

Milk costs $2, eggs cost $3, light bulbs cost $3, and cups cost $3. Roach traps, being a food item, are not included in the tax.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost of nonfood items, which are eggs, light bulbs, and cups. Adding these together gives $3 + $3 + $3 = $9.

Then, I'll apply the 10% tax to this total: $9 * 10% = $0.90.

Finally, I'll add the tax to the original total of nonfood items to find the total cost. $9 + $0.90 = $9.90.

To determine the total cost of everything John bought, including a 10% tax on all nonfood items, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the cost of each item:**
   - **Milk:** \$2
   - **Eggs:** \$3
   - **Light Bulbs:** \$3
   - **Cups:** \$3
   - **Roach Traps:** Not included in the tax calculation (it's a food item).

2. **Calculate the total cost of nonfood items (eggs, light bulbs, and cups):**
   \[
   \$3 \ (\text{eggs}) + \$3 \ (\text{light bulbs}) + \$3 \ (\text{cups}) = \$9
   \]

3. **Calculate the 10% tax on the nonfood items:**
   \[
   \$9 \times 10\% = \$0.90
   \]

4. **Add the tax to the total cost of nonfood items to find the total cost:**
   \[
   \$9 + \$0.90 = \$9.90
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{9.90}
\]
