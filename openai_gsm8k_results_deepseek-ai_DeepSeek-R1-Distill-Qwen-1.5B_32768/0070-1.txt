Question:
Jenny goes to the florist to buy some flowers. Roses cost $2 each and $15 for a dozen. If she bought 15 roses and arrived with five 5 dollar bills and they only have quarters for change, how many quarters does she leave with?

Correct Answer:
Jenny has $25 because 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25
She buys 1 dozen roses and 3 single roses because 15 - 12 - 3 = <<15-12-3=0>>0
She spends $6 on the single roses because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6
She spends $21 on roses because 15 + 6 = <<15+6=21>>21
She gets $4 in change because 25 - 21 = <<25-21=4>>4
She gets 16 quarters because 4 x 4 = <<4*4=16>>16
#### 16

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine the total cost of 15 roses. Each rose costs $2, so 15 roses cost \(15 \times 2 = \$30\).

Next, I'll calculate the cost of a dozen roses. A dozen roses cost $15.

Jenny bought 15 roses, which is equivalent to 1.2 dozen roses. Therefore, the cost for 1.2 dozen roses is \(1.2 \times 15 = \$18\).

Jenny paid with five $5 bills, totaling \$25. Subtracting the cost of the roses from the amount she paid gives \(25 - 18 = \$7\).

Since she only has quarters for change, she needs to return \$7 in quarters. Each quarter is worth \$0.25, so she needs \(7 \div 0.25 = 28\) quarters.

Thus, Jenny leaves with 28 quarters.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Cost of one rose:** \$2
- **Cost of a dozen roses:** \$15
- **Number of roses bought:** 15
- **Amount paid:** Five \$5 bills (\$25)
- **Change received:** Only in quarters (\$0.25 each)

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total cost of 15 roses:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 15 roses} = 15 \times \$2 = \$30
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of 1.2 dozen roses:**
   
   \[
   \text{Cost for 1.2 dozen roses} = 1.2 \times \$15 = \$18
   \]

3. **Determine the change received:**
   
   \[
   \text{Change} = \$25 - \$18 = \$7
   \]

4. **Convert the change into quarters:**
   
   Since each quarter is worth \$0.25,
   
   \[
   \text{Number of quarters} = \frac{\$7}{\$0.25} = 28
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{28}
\]
