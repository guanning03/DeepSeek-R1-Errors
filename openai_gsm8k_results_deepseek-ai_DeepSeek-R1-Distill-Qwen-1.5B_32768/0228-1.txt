Question:
Jackie is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or hire an accountant. If she does the taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, losing $35/hour in missed income. The accountant charges $90. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?

Correct Answer:
First find the total lost revenue if Jackie does her taxes herself: $35/hour * 3 hours = $<<35*3=105>>105
Then subtract the accountant's charge to find how much money Janet saves: $105 - $90 = $<<105-90=15>>15

Wrong Answer:
To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, I'll break down the problem step by step.

First, if Jackie does her taxes herself, she can reduce her freelance work hours by 3 hours. This means she will be able to work 3 fewer hours, each worth $35. 

Calculating the lost income from the reduced freelance work:
3 hours × $35/hour = $105.

Next, the accountant charges $90 per hour. To find the total cost for the same number of hours, I'll multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours:
$90/hour × 3 hours = $270.

Finally, to find out how much more money Jackie will have by hiring the accountant, I'll subtract the accountant's cost from her current income:
$270 (cost of accountant) - $105 (lost income) = $165.

Therefore, Jackie will have $165 more if she hires the accountant.

Let's determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself.

### Step 1: Calculate the Lost Income from Reduced Freelance Work
- **Lost Hours:** 3 hours
- **Hourly Rate:** \$35/hour

\[
\text{Lost Income} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Cost of Hiring an Accountant
- **Hourly Rate for Accountant:** \$90/hour
- **Hours Worked:** 3 hours

\[
\text{Cost of Accountant} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$90/\text{hour} = \$270
\]

### Step 3: Determine How Much More Money Jackie Will Have
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Cost of Accountant} - \text{Lost Income} = \$270 - \$105 = \$165
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$165}
\]
