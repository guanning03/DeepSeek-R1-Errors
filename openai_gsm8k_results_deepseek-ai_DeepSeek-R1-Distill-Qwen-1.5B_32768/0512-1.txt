Question:
Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes cost $20. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?

Correct Answer:
Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.
Sara will need to save a total of $30 + $40 = $<<30+40=70>>70 to buy everything that she wants.
Sara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.
Between her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.
Sara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 from mowing the lawn to afford her clothes.
Sara must mow the lawn $40 / $4 = <<40/4=10>>10 times to afford to buy the jacket and shoes.

Wrong Answer:
First, calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20, so two pairs of shoes cost $40. Adding these together, the total cost is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, she needs $70 minus $10, which is $60.

Next, determine how much Sara earns from mowing the lawn. She earns $4 per mowing.

Let x be the number of times she needs to mow the lawn. The total earnings from mowing will be 4x.

The total amount she will have after mowing is her current savings plus her earnings from mowing, which is 10 + 4x.

To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, set up the equation 10 + 4x = 60.

Solving for x, subtract 10 from both sides to get 4x = 50.

Finally, divide both sides by 4 to find x = 12.5.

Since Sara can't mow half a lawn, she needs to mow 13 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   - **Jacket:** \$30
   - **2 Pairs of Shoes:** \$20 each Ã— 2 = \$40
   - **Total Cost:** \$30 + \$40 = \$70

2. **Subtract the Amount Sara Already Has:**
   - **Savings:** \$10
   - **Remaining Amount Needed:** \$70 - \$10 = \$60

3. **Determine Earnings from Mowing the Lawn:**
   - **Earnings per Mow:** \$4
   - **Let \( x \) be the number of times she mows the lawn.**
   - **Total Earnings from Mowing:** \$4x

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   \[
   10 + 4x = 60
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   4x = 60 - 10 \\
   4x = 50 \\
   x = \frac{50}{4} \\
   x = 12.5
   \]

6. **Interpret the Result:**
   - Since Sara can't mow half a lawn, she needs to mow **13 times** to have enough money.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
