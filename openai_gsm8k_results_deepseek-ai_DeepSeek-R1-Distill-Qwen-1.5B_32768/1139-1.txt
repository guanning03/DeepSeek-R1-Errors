Question:
Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times while Fred rode it 4 times. After that, each of them decided to ride the luge 2 times. If each ride cost 6 tickets, how many tickets did they use that day?

Correct Answer:
The total times that they ride the roller coaster is 2+4=<<2+4=6>>6 times.
The total times that they ride the luge is 2+2=<<2+2=4>>4 times.
The total times they ride that day is 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10 times.
So, Pam and Fred used 10x6=<<10*6=60>>60 tickets that day.

Wrong Prediction:
24

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine how many times Pam and Fred rode the roller coaster. Pam rode it 2 times, and Fred rode it 4 times. 

Next, both of them decided to ride the luge 2 times each. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, I'll calculate the total number of luge rides by adding Pam's and Fred's luge rides: 2 + 4 = 6 rides.

Finally, I'll multiply the total number of luge rides by the number of tickets per ride to find out how many tickets they used in total: 6 rides Ã— 6 tickets per ride = 36 tickets.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Rides:**
   - **Roller Coaster:**
     - Pam rode it **2 times**.
     - Fred rode it **4 times**.
   - **Luge:**
     - Pam decided to ride it **2 times**.
     - Fred decided to ride it **2 times**.

2. **Total Luge Rides:**
   \[
   \text{Total Luge Rides} = 2 \text{ (Pam)} + 2 \text{ (Fred)} = 4 \text{ rides}
   \]

3. **Cost per Ride:**
   - Each ride costs **6 tickets**.

4. **Total Tickets Used:**
   \[
   \text{Total Tickets} = \text{Total Luge Rides} \times \text{Cost per Ride} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ tickets}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{24}
\]
