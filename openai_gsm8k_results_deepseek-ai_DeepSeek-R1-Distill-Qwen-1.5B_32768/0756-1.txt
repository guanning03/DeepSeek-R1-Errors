Question:
Jen decides to travel to 3 different countries.  He has to pay $400 for the supplies he needs, in total.  The tickets for travel cost, in total, 50% more than the supplies.  How much does travel cost?

Correct Answer:
He pays 400*.5=$<<400*.5=200>>200 more for tickets than supplies
That means the tickets cost 400+200=$<<400+200=600>>600
So it cost 600+400=$<<600+400=1000>>1000 in total.

Wrong Prediction:
600

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total cost of the travel tickets. The problem states that the travel cost is 50% more than the supplies cost. Jen has $400 for supplies.

To calculate the additional amount for travel, I'll find 50% of $400, which is $200. Adding this to the supplies cost, the total travel cost becomes $600.

Let's determine the total travel cost step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of supplies:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of supplies} = \$400
   \]

2. **Calculate the additional amount for travel, which is 50% more than the supplies cost:**
   \[
   \text{Additional travel cost} = 50\% \times \$400 = 0.5 \times \$400 = \$200
   \]

3. **Determine the total travel cost by adding the additional amount to the supplies cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total travel cost} = \$400 + \$200 = \$600
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{600}
\]
