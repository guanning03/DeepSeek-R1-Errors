Question:
Marin and his neighbor Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. How many apples do they eat in 30 days?

Correct Answer:

Wrong Prediction:
240

Wrong Answer:
To determine how many apples Marin and his neighbor Nancy eat in 30 days, I start by calculating the total number of apples they eat each day.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, and Nancy also eats 4 apples a day. Adding these together gives 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Next, I need to find the total number of apples they eat over 30 days. I multiply the daily consumption by the number of days: 8 apples/day Ã— 30 days = 240 apples.

Therefore, Marin and Nancy eat a total of 240 apples in 30 days.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the daily apple consumption:**
   - Marin eats **4 apples** a day.
   - Nancy eats **4 apples** a day.
   
   Combined, they eat:
   \[
   4 \text{ apples/day} + 4 \text{ apples/day} = 8 \text{ apples/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total apple consumption over 30 days:**
   \[
   8 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ apples}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{240}
\]
