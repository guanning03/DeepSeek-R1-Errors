Question:
The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.  The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo and this will give you 120 washings.  If Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, how much will each pump cost, in cents?

Correct Answer:
2 pumps will give you 120 washes so if she only uses 1 pump per wash she doubles the number of washes so she now has 120*2 = <<120*2=240>>240 washes
The bottle costs $24.00 and she will 240 washes so each wash is 24/240 = $<<24/240=0.10>>0.10

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the cost per washing by dividing the total cost of the shampoo by the total number of washings. The shampoo costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings, so the cost per washing is $0.20.

Next, calculate the cost per pump by dividing the cost per washing by the number of pumps. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, each pump costs $0.20.

To determine how much each pump costs, follow these steps:

1. **Find the total cost per washing:**
   
   The total cost of the shampoo is \$24.00, and it provides 120 washings.
   
   \[
   \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{\$24.00}{120} = \$0.20
   \]

2. **Determine the cost per pump:**
   
   If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, each pump costs the same as the cost per washing.
   
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump} = \$0.20
   \]

3. **Convert the cost to cents:**
   
   Since \$1 is equal to 100 cents, multiply the cost in dollars by 100.
   
   \[
   \$0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{20}
\]
