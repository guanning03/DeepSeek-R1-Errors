Question:
Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?

Correct Answer:
Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the total cost of the bacon. Kelly has 5 packs costing $10 in total.

Next, I'll determine the cost of the chicken. Each chicken packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each chicken packet costs $2. Since she has 6 packets, the total cost for chicken is $12.

Then, I'll find out the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so the total cost for strawberries is $12.

After that, I'll calculate the cost of the apples. Each apple pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $2. With 7 packs, the total cost for apples is $14.

Finally, I'll add up all these costs to find the total expenditure: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) equals $48.

Subtracting the total expenditure from Kelly's budget of $65, she has $17 remaining.

Let's determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget after her purchases.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   - Total cost of 5 packs of bacon = \$10

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   - Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per chicken packet = \$2 (since \$10 ÷ 5 = \$2)
   - Total cost for 6 packs of chicken = 6 × \$2 = \$12

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs \$4.
   - Total cost for 3 packs of strawberries = 3 × \$4 = \$12

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per apple packet = \$2 (since \$4 ÷ 2 = \$2)
   - Total cost for 7 packs of apples = 7 × \$2 = \$14

5. **Total Expenditure:**
   - Sum of all costs = \$10 (bacon) + \$12 (chicken) + \$12 (strawberries) + \$14 (apples) = \$48

6. **Money Left in Budget:**
   - Kelly's budget = \$65
   - Money left = \$65 - \$48 = \boxed{17}
