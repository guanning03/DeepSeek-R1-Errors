Question:
A hotel in the Philippines charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. Cameron arrives at 5 pm at the hotel and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?

Correct Answer:
12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.
If Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.
This means that he must pay an additional 70 pesos x 5 hours = <<70*5=350>>350 pesos.
Altogether, he must pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = <<1000+350=1350>>1350 pesos.
Therefore, he will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = <<1600-1350=250>>250 pesos.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many hours Cameron will stay at the hotel.

He arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This is a total of 7 hours.

Since the hotel offers a 12-hour stay for 1000 pesos, Cameron can use this option for the first 12 hours. However, he only needs 7 hours, so he will only pay for 7 hours.

The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.

After the 12-hour mark, Cameron can add 70 pesos for each additional hour. He will stay for an additional 5 hours (from 12 pm to 10 am).

Calculating the additional cost: 5 hours Ã— 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

Therefore, the total cost for Cameron's stay is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

If Cameron had chosen to pay for a full 24-hour stay, the cost would have been 1600 pesos.

By choosing the 70 pesos per hour option for the first 5 hours, Cameron saves 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 150 pesos.

To determine how much Cameron would save by choosing the 70 pesos per additional hour option instead of paying for a full 24-hour stay, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Duration of Cameron's Stay:**
   
   Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This gives him a total stay duration of:
   \[
   \text{Stay Duration} = 10 \, \text{am} - 5 \, \text{pm} = 7 \, \text{hours}
   \]
   
2. **Determine the Cost for the First 12 Hours:**
   
   The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours.
   \[
   \text{Cost for First 12 Hours} = 1000 \, \text{pesos}
   \]
   
3. **Calculate the Additional Cost for the Next Hours:**
   
   After the 12-hour stay, Cameron will add 70 pesos for each additional hour. He stays for 7 hours in total, so the additional time beyond the first 12 hours is:
   \[
   \text{Additional Hours} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 12 \, \text{hours} = -5 \, \text{hours}
   \]
   Since the additional hours are negative, it means Cameron only pays for the first 12 hours.
   
   However, this doesn't seem right. Let's correct this.

   **Revised Calculation:**
   
   Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is **7 hours** after 5 pm.

   Since the first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos, and Cameron only stays for 7 hours, he will only pay for **7 hours** at the 70 pesos per hour rate.

   \[
   \text{Additional Cost} = 7 \, \text{hours} \times 70 \, \text{pesos/hour} = 490 \, \text{pesos}
   \]
   
4. **Calculate the Total Cost for Cameron's Stay:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost for First 12 Hours} + \text{Additional Cost} = 1000 \, \text{pesos} + 490 \, \text{pesos} = 1490 \, \text{pesos}
   \]
   
5. **Determine the Savings by Choosing the 70 Peso Option:**
   
   If Cameron had chosen to pay for a full 24-hour stay, the cost would have been 1600 pesos.
   
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Full 24-Hour Cost} - \text{Total Cost with 70 Peso Option} = 1600 \, \text{pesos} - 1490 \, \text{pesos} = 110 \, \text{pesos}
   \]
   
However, upon reviewing the calculations, there seems to be a mistake in the additional hours calculation. Let's correct this.

**Corrected Calculation:**

- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am, which is **5 hours after 5 pm** (i.e., from 5 pm to 10 am is 5 hours).
  
- Therefore, he will stay for **7 hours total**, with the first 12 hours costing 1000 pesos, and no additional hours beyond that.

- Thus, the total cost remains:
  \[
  \text{Total Cost} = 1000 \, \text{pesos}
  \]
  
- The incorrect earlier calculation mistakenly included an additional 5 hours, which is not necessary. Cameron only stays for 7 hours, so he pays for the full 12-hour rate.

**Final Savings:**

Since Cameron pays for the full 12-hour rate of 1000 pesos instead of the 24-hour rate of 1600 pesos, his savings would be:
\[
\text{Savings} = 1600 \, \text{pesos} - 1000 \, \text{pesos} = 600 \, \text{pesos}
\]

**Answer:**
Cameron would save \boxed{600}pesos.
