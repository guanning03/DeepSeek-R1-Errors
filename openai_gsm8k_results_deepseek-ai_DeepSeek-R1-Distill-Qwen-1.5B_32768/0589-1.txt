Question:
A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?

Correct Answer:
The city will be covered in 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 intervals of 10 minutes.
Thus, it will take 14 * 10 = <<14*10=140>>140 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.
#### 140

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how long it takes for the fog bank to cover each mile of the city.

Given that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, the time per mile is 10 minutes divided by 3 miles, which equals approximately 3 and 1/3 minutes per mile.

Next, I'll calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover, which is 42 miles.

Finally, I'll multiply the time per mile by the total miles to find the total time required: 42 miles multiplied by 3 and 1/3 minutes per mile, resulting in 140 minutes.

To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- The fog bank covers **3 miles** in **10 minutes**.
- The total distance from the oceanfront to the opposite edge is **42 miles**.

**Step 1: Calculate the Time per Mile**

First, find out how many minutes it takes to cover **1 mile**.

\[
\text{Time per mile} = \frac{10\ \text{minutes}}{3\ \text{miles}} = \frac{10}{3}\ \text{minutes per mile} \approx 3.\overline{3}\ \text{minutes per mile}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the Total Time for 42 Miles**

Multiply the time per mile by the total distance to find the total time required.

\[
\text{Total time} = 42\ \text{miles} \times \frac{10}{3}\ \text{minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140\ \text{minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{140\ \text{minutes}}
\]
