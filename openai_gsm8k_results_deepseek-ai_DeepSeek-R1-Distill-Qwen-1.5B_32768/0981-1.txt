Question:
A company pays each of its employees $600 in a month. The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years. If Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December, what's her annual salary after three more years of service?

Correct Answer:
In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.
Sylvie earnings will increase by 10/100 * $7200/year = $<<10/100*7200=720>>720/year after 5 years.
In three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160
After three years, Sylvie will be paid $7200 + $2160 = $<<7200+2160=9360>>9360

Wrong Answer:
Alright, let me try to figure out Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service. So, the company gives a base salary of $600 each month. They increase this salary by 10% every year for employees who have been with them for five years. Since Sylvie has already been there for five years and just clocked in another year, she's now been with the company for six years. But the question is asking about her salary after three more years, which means she'll have been with the company for a total of nine years from the start. Hmm, but the policy is only in place for those who have stayed for five years. So, does that mean that for Sylvie, the first five years are the base, and then starting from the sixth year, she gets the 10% increase each year?

Wait, let me reread the question to make sure I understand. It says, "the company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years." So, only for employees who have been with the company for five years or more does the company increase their salary by 10% each year. So, for Sylvie, who has been there for five years, the first five years of service, her salary isn't increased, right? Because the policy only starts after five years. So, after five years, every additional year, her salary gets increased by 10% of the initial salary.

So, her initial salary is $600. Each year, she gets a 10% increase on her salary. So, each year, her salary becomes 110% of what it was the previous year. That's a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 1.1 each year. So, after one year, it's $660, after two years, it's $726, and so on.

But wait, the question is asking for her annual salary after three more years of service. So, she's been with the company for five years, and now she's been there for a total of eight years, but she's been in for three more years. So, starting from the sixth year, her salary gets increased by 10% each year.

So, we need to calculate her salary after three more years, which means she will have had the 10% increase for three consecutive years. So, starting from the sixth year, each subsequent year, her salary increases by 10%.

Therefore, we can model her salary after each year as:

Year 1: 600 * 1.1 = 660

Year 2: 660 * 1.1 = 726

Year 3: 726 * 1.1 = 800 approximately? Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

Wait, 660 * 1.1 is 726, correct. Then 726 * 1.1 is 798.6, right? Because 726 * 1.1 is 726 + 72.6 = 800 - 1.4, which is 798.6.

So, after three more years, her salary would be $798.60. But wait, the question is asking for her annual salary. So, does that mean her monthly salary? Or is it asking for the total salary over the year?

Wait, the question says, "what's her annual salary after three more years of service?" So, her annual salary, which would be the total amount she earns in a year. So, since the salary is increased by 10% each year, her annual salary after each year is the previous year's salary multiplied by 1.1.

So, starting from the sixth year, her annual salary is $660 (first year after the 10% increase), then $726, then $800, etc. So, after three years, her annual salary would be $800.

Wait, but let's be precise. Let me compute it step by step.

First, initial salary: $600.

After first year (Year 1): 600 * 1.1 = 660.

After second year (Year 2): 660 * 1.1 = 726.

After third year (Year 3): 726 * 1.1 = 800. So, yes, $800.

But wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the policy correctly. The policy says, "increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years." So, for Sylvie, who has been there for five years, the initial salary is $600, and each year, they add 10% of $600, which is $60. So, each year, her salary increases by $60.

So, starting from the sixth year, her salary becomes $660, then $720, then $780, then $840. Wait, that's a different result. Wait, hold on, that would be $60 per year increase. But is that correct? Because 10% of the initial salary is 10% of $600, which is $60, so each year, it's a flat $60 increase.

Wait, so that would make it $660, $720, $780, $840. So, that's a different result.

But the problem says, "10% of the initial salary." So, initial salary is $600 each month, so 10% of that is $60. So, each year, the salary increases by $60. So, starting from $600, each year, it's plus $60.

Wait, so after three years, her annual salary would be 600 + 3*60 = 600 + 180 = 780.

But that contradicts the previous result where I multiplied by 1.1 each year, which would be:

600 * 1.1 = 660

660 * 1.1 = 726

726 * 1.1 = 800

So, two different results based on interpretation.

Wait, let's look back at the problem statement: "the company pays each of its employees $600 in a month. The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years."

So, the key here is "10% of the initial salary." The initial salary is $600, so each year, 10% of $600 is $60. So, each year, it's a flat $60 increase.

Therefore, the salary progression is $600, $660, $720, $780, $840, etc. So, each year, it's +$60.

Therefore, after three more years, her annual salary would be $600 + 3*$60 = $780.

But in the other interpretation, if it's a 10% increase on the previous year's salary, then starting from the sixth year, it's 10% of the previous year's salary. So, the first year after the policy kicks in is $660, then $726, then $798.60, which is approximately $798.60.

But the problem is a bit ambiguous. It says, "the company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years."

So, the wording suggests that the 10% is of the initial salary, which is a fixed $600. So, it's a flat $60 increase each year. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that her salary increases by a flat $60 each year.

Therefore, after three more years, her annual salary would be $600 + 3*$60 = $780.

Wait, but let me think again.

If it's a 10% increase on the initial salary, which is $600, so each year, it's 10% of $600, which is $60. So, each year, the salary increases by $60.

So, starting from the sixth year, her salary is:

Year 6: $600 + $60 = $660

Year 7: $660 + $60 = $720

Year 8: $720 + $60 = $780

So, after three more years, it's $780.

But wait, the problem says "the company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years."

So, for those who have stayed for five years, every year after that, the salary is increased by 10% of the initial salary. So, the 10% is on the initial salary, which is $600, so it's a flat $60 increase each year.

Therefore, it's a linear increase, not compounded.

So, starting from the sixth year, it's $660, $720, $780, etc.

So, after three more years, her annual salary is $600 + 3*10% of $600, which is $60 each year, so $780.

Wait, but now I'm confused because in the first calculation, I thought of it as compounded increase, but the wording says "10% of the initial salary," which is a flat amount. So, I think the correct interpretation is that it's a flat $60 increase each year.

Therefore, after three more years, it's $780.

But just to be absolutely sure, let me parse the wording again: "increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years."

So, the key here is "10% of the initial salary." The initial salary is $600. So, 10% of $600 is $60. So, each year, the salary increases by $60. So, regardless of the current year, the increase is always $60.

Therefore, Sylvie's salary progression is:

Year 1: $660

Year 2: $720

Year 3: $780

So, after three more years, her annual salary is $780.

Therefore, the answer is $780.

But wait, let me think about another angle. Maybe the 10% is applied on the previous year's salary, so it's compounded. So, in that case, starting from the sixth year, it's 10% of the previous year's salary.

So, initial salary: $600.

Year 1: 10% of $600 = $60, so $660.

Year 2: 10% of $660 = $66, so $726.

Year 3: 10% of $726 = $72.60, so $800 approximately.

So, if compounded, after three more years, her salary would be approximately $800.

But in the problem statement, it says "10% of the initial salary." The initial salary is $600, so 10% is $60, regardless of the previous year's salary.

So, it's a flat $60 increase each year, not a percentage of the current salary.

Therefore, the correct interpretation is that it's a flat $60 increase each year, making Sylvie's salary after three more years $780.

But wait, now I'm getting confused because in the first sentence, it's said the company pays each employee $600 per month, and then increases salaries by 10% for those who have stayed five years.

So, the initial monthly salary is $600, and then, starting from the sixth year, they increase it by 10% each year on the initial salary.

Wait, perhaps the 10% is relative to the initial salary, which is $600, so each year, they add $60.

Therefore, regardless of how many years they've been there, the 10% is on the initial $600.

So, if that's the case, the salary after three more years would be $660 + 3*$60 = $780.

But let me check with another approach.

The formula for the salary after n years, if it's a linear increase, would be:

Salary = 600 + 10% * 600 * n

Where n is the number of years after the 10% increase starts. Since Sylvie has been there for five years, the 10% increase starts at year 6.

Therefore, for the next three years (year 6, 7, 8), the salary increases by 10% of 600 each year.

So, the formula would be:

Salary after year 6: 600 + 10%*600*1 = 660

After year 7: 600 + 10%*600*2 = 600 + 120 = 720

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait. Let's model it as a linear function.

Let t be the number of years after the 10% increase started, which is year 6. So, t = 0 is year 6, t = 1 is year 7, t = 2 is year 8, t = 3 is year 9.

Each t, salary is 600 + 10%*600*t = 600 + 60t.

So, after t = 3, salary is 600 + 60*3 = 780.

So, that matches the previous calculation.

Thus, after three more years, her annual salary is $780.

Alternatively, if we model it as compounded, the salary after t years would be 600*(1.1)^t.

So, after t=3, that would be 600*(1.1)^3 = 600*1.331 = $798.6.

But since the problem says "10% of the initial salary," which is 10% of 600, so that's a flat $60 increase each year, not a percentage of the current salary.

Therefore, it's a linear increase.

Thus, the correct answer is $780.

But hold on, the problem is presented as if it's a linear increase, but let me check again.

The problem says: "the company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years."

So, "10% of the initial salary." The initial salary is $600, so 10% of that is $60. So, each year, the salary is increased by $60.

Therefore, regardless of the previous year's salary, the 10% is on the initial $600.

Thus, the salary progression is:

Year 0: $600

Year 1: $660

Year 2: $720

Year 3: $780

So, after three more years, her annual salary is $780.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{780}$.

**Final Answer**
Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is \boxed{780} dollars.
</think>

The company pays each of its employees $600 per month. The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who have stayed in the company for five years. Sylvie has been with the company for five years and now has three more years of service.

The initial salary is $600. Each year, the salary is increased by 10% of the initial salary, which is $60. Therefore, the salary increases by $60 each year.

Starting from the sixth year, Sylvie's salary increases as follows:
- After one more year: $600 + $60 = $660
- After two more years: $660 + $60 = $720
- After three more years: $720 + $60 = $780

Thus, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is \(\boxed{780}\) dollars.
