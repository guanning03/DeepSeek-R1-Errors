Question:
As Sally walked to school, she was holding the strings to 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. Suddenly, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  But as she neared the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, and she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which she carried into the school.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?

Correct Answer:
Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons
#### 34

Wrong Answer:
Alright, let me try to figure out how many balloons Sally finally carried into the school. Okay, so Sally had some balloons initially, and then the wind caused some to burst, she released some, she found some, and then she added more. I need to track each step to see how many she had at each point.

First, she started with 25 red balloons, 7 green, and 12 yellow. That seems straightforward. So, initially, she had:

- Red: 25
- Green: 7
- Yellow: 12

Then, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate 40% of 25 to find out how many red balloons burst. Let me do that. 40% is the same as 0.4 in decimal form. So, 25 multiplied by 0.4 is... 25 * 0.4 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst. That means Sally is left with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Okay, so after the wind, she has 15 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow. That's 15 + 7 + 12. Let me add those up. 15 + 7 is 22, and 22 + 12 is 34. So, she now has 34 balloons.

Then, the wind scared her, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. So, the number of yellow balloons she had was 12. Half of 12 is 6. So, she releases 6 yellow balloons. That means she's left with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

So, now, her remaining balloons are 15 red, 7 green, and 6 yellow. Let me add those up again: 15 + 7 is 22, plus 6 is 28. So, she has 28 balloons after the wind.

But then, as she neared the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree. Wait, she didn't have any blue balloons before, right? She started with red, green, yellow. So, she adds 8 blue balloons to her clutch. So, her total becomes 28 + 8 = 36 balloons.

Then, she added 75% of those 8 blue balloons to her remaining clutch. Hmm, 75% of 8. Let me calculate that. 75% is 0.75, so 8 * 0.75 is... 6. So, she adds 6 more blue balloons.

So, her total now is 36 + 6 = 42 balloons. Therefore, she finally carried 42 balloons into the school.

Wait, let me double-check in case I made a mistake somewhere. Starting with 25 red, 7 green, 12 yellow. 40% of red (25) is 10, so 15 red left. Then 7 green and 12 yellow. Then half of yellow (12) is 6, so 6 yellow left. Then adding 8 blue and 75% of those 8. 75% of 8 is 6, so 8 + 6 = 14 blue. So, total is 15 + 7 + 6 + 14. Let's add them: 15 + 7 is 22, 6 + 14 is 20, 22 + 20 is 42. Yeah, that seems right.

So, I think 42 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is \boxed{42}.

Sally started with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. A gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst. 

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.4 \times 25 = 10
   \]
   Remaining red balloons:
   \[
   25 - 10 = 15
   \]

2. The wind also caused Sally to release half of the yellow balloons:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6
   \]
   Remaining yellow balloons:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6
   \]

3. Adding the remaining red, green, and yellow balloons:
   \[
   15 \text{ (red)} + 7 \text{ (green)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} = 28
   \]

4. Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her clutch:
   \[
   75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6
   \]
   Adding the blue balloons:
   \[
   28 + 8 = 36
   \]
   Adding the 75% of the blue balloons:
   \[
   36 + 6 = 42
   \]

The number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is \boxed{42}.
