Question:
Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, and then started and finished another 500 piece puzzle within an hour.  How many puzzle pieces did Teddy place during that hour?

Correct Answer:
Teddy did 1/2 * 500 pieces = <<500/2=250>>250 pieces.
Teddy completed 250 pieces + 500 pieces = <<250+500=750>>750 pieces.
#### 750

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during the first half of the 500-piece puzzle. Since half of 500 is 250, Teddy placed 250 pieces during this time.

Next, I'll consider the second 500-piece puzzle. Since the first half of this puzzle was completed within an hour, Teddy placed 250 pieces during this period as well.

Finally, I'll add the pieces from both puzzles together to find the total number of pieces Teddy placed during the hour. That would be 250 plus 250, totaling 500 pieces.

To determine how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during the specified hour, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Puzzle:**
   - **Total pieces:** 500
   - **Puzzle finished:** Half of 500
     \[
     \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   
2. **Second Puzzle:**
   - **Total pieces:** 500
   - **Puzzle finished within an hour:** Teddy placed 250 pieces during this time.
   
3. **Total Pieces Placed During the Hour:**
   \[
   250 \text{ pieces (first puzzle)} + 250 \text{ pieces (second puzzle)} = 500 \text{ pieces}
   \]

\[
\boxed{500}
\]
