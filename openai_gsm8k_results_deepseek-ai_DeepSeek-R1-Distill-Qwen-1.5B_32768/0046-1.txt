Question:
Jackie grew 3" over the summer.  She is now 2" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert.  If Albert is 36" tall, how tall was Jackie before summer?

Correct Answer:
Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72" tall
Anne is 72" tall and Jackie is 2" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72-2 = <<72-2=70>>70" tall
Jackie is currently 70" tall and grew 3" over summer, so before summer she was 70-3= <<70-3=67>>67" tall
#### 67

67

Wrong Prediction:
67\

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the current height of Albert. Since Albert is 36 inches tall, I'll use that as a starting point.

Next, Anne is twice as tall as Albert. So, I'll calculate Anne's height by multiplying Albert's height by 2. 36 inches multiplied by 2 equals 72 inches.

Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Therefore, I'll subtract 2 inches from Anne's height to find Jackie's current height. 72 inches minus 2 inches equals 70 inches.

Since the question asks for Jackie's height before the summer growth, I'll subtract the 3 inches she grew over the summer from her current height. 70 inches minus 3 inches equals 67 inches.

So, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer.

Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how tall Jackie was before summer.

### **Given:**
1. **Jackie's growth over the summer:** 3 inches.
2. **Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne.**
3. **Anne is twice the size of Albert.**
4. **Albert is 36 inches tall.**

### **Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Determine Anne's Current Height:**
   
   - **Albert's current height:** 36 inches.
   - **Anne is twice as tall as Albert:** 
     
     \[
     \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36\, \text{inches} = 72\, \text{inches}
     \]

2. **Find Jackie's Current Height:**
   
   - **Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne:** 
     
     \[
     \text{Jackie's current height} = \text{Anne's height} - 2\, \text{inches} = 72\, \text{inches} - 2\, \text{inches} = 70\, \text{inches}
     \]

3. **Determine Jackie's Height Before Summer Growth:**
   
   - **Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer:** 
     
     \[
     \text{Jackie's height before summer} = \text{Jackie's current height} - 3\, \text{inches} = 70\, \text{inches} - 3\, \text{inches} = 67\, \text{inches}
     \]

### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{67\ \text{inches}}
\]
