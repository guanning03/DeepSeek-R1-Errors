Question:
Elly is organizing her books on the new bookcases her parents bought her. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?

Correct Answer:
The bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.
The 2 middle shelves can hold a total of 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.
The top shelf can hold 20 â€“ 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 books.
Each bookcase can hold a total of 20 books + 20 books + 15 books = <<20+20+15=55>>55 books.
To hold all of her books, she needs 110 / 55 = <<110/55=2>>2 bookcases.

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Each middle shelf holds 10 books, and there are two of them, so that's 20 books in total.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is 2 times 10, equaling 20 books.

The top shelf holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so that's 20 minus 5, totaling 15 books.

Adding all the shelves together, the total capacity is 10 (middle) + 20 (bottom) + 15 (top) equals 45 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, dividing the total number of books by the total capacity gives 110 divided by 45, which is approximately 2.444 bookcases.

Since you can't have a fraction of a bookcase, rounding up gives 3 bookcases needed to hold all her books.

To determine how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all her 110 books, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the capacity of each shelf:**
   - **Middle shelves:** Each holds 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves.
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
     \]
   - **Bottom shelf:** Holds twice as many books as a middle shelf.
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
     \]
   - **Top shelf:** Holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
     \[
     20 - 5 = 15 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Find the total capacity of all shelves:**
   \[
   20 \text{ (middle)} + 20 \text{ (bottom)} + 15 \text{ (top)} = 55 \text{ books}
   \]

3. **Determine how many bookcases are needed:**
   Elly has 110 books and each bookcase can hold 55 books.
   \[
   \frac{110}{55} = 2 \text{ bookcases}
   \]
   
   However, since you can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up:
   \[
   \lceil 2 \rceil = 3 \text{ bookcases}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
