Question:
Debra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?

Correct Answer:
Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.
Debra sees twice as many bees as first left the hive--which was 30--fly from the hive in the next 6 hours, 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bees that leave the hive.
In total, 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 bees left the hive.
There were 90 bees total that left the hive - 15 bees that already returned = <<90-15=75>>75 bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.
#### 75

Wrong Answer:
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. It's about Debra monitoring a beehive and counting how many bees come and go over a day. I need to find out how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours. Hmm, let me break it down.

First, the problem says Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Okay, so in the first 6 hours, 30 bees are leaving. That's straightforward.

Then, she sees half that many bees return in the next 6 hours. Half of 30 is 15. So, in the next 6 hours, 15 bees return. Got that.

Next, it says she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. So, she saw 30 bees leave in the first 6 hours, and now it's two times that number. So, 30 times 2 is 60. So, in the following 6 hours, she sees 60 bees return. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but okay.

Wait, but let me make sure I understand that part. It says she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. So, does that mean 2 times the number that left in the first 6 hours, which is 30, so 60? Yep, that's correct.

Then, it says every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. So, in the last 6 hours, after the 60 bees return, all the bees that came out before (which were the 30 bees) haven't returned yet, so they come back.

Let me try to summarize:

- First 6 hours: 30 bees leave. So, 0 bees have returned yet.

- Next 6 hours: 15 bees return. Now, 15 bees are back.

- Next 6 hours: 60 bees return. Now, 15 + 60 = 75 bees are back.

- Then, in the last 6 hours, every bee that left before (which was 30 bees) hasn't returned yet, so they come back. So, 30 bees come back.

Wait, so in the last 6 hours, 30 bees return. But let me double-check if that's the case.

Wait, does the problem say "every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours"? So, if the last 6 hours are the next 6 hours after the previous ones, does that mean that in the last 6 hours, the 30 bees come back?

But I need to be careful here. Let's think about the timeline:

1. First 6 hours: 30 leave. So, 0 return.

2. Next 6 hours: 15 return. So, 15 returned, 15 still leaving.

3. Next 6 hours: 60 return. So, 15 + 60 = 75 returned, 60 + 30 = 90 still leaving.

4. Then, in the last 6 hours: every bee that left before that hadn't already returned. So, that's the 30 bees that left before the last 6 hours. So, in the last 6 hours, those 30 come back.

So, yes, that makes sense. So, in the last 6 hours, 30 bees return.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not overcomplicating it. So, to recap:

- 0 returning bees at the start.

- After first 6 hours: 30 leave.

- After next 6 hours: 15 return.

- After next 6 hours: 60 return.

- Then, in the last 6 hours: 30 return.

So, total returned in last 6 hours: 30.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says "every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours." So, "that" refers to the last 6 hours. So, the 30 bees that left before are the ones that left in the first 6 hours. So, in the last 6 hours, they come back.

So, that would be 30.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because in the next 6 hours after the first 6, she saw 15 return, then 60, and then the last 6 hours, 30 return. So, the last 6 hours are separate from the previous ones.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's phrased as "she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours." So, that is, the next 6 hours, two times as many as the first 6 hours. So, that's 60.

Then, "then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours." So, the "that" refers to the last 6 hours. So, in that last 6 hours, all the bees that have left before (which were the first 30) haven't returned yet, so they come back.

Therefore, in the last 6 hours, 30 bees return.

Wait, but let me make sure that the time is being correctly interpreted.

So, the first 6 hours: 30 leave.

Next 6 hours: 15 return, so 15 are back.

Next 6 hours: 60 return, so 60 are back.

Then, in the last 6 hours: 30 return.

So, the time breakdown is:

1. 6 hours: 30 leave.

2. 6 hours: 15 return.

3. 6 hours: 60 return.

4. 6 hours: 30 return.

So, each of these is a separate period, each 6 hours. So, the last 6 hours are separate from the previous ones. So, in the last 6 hours, 30 return.

But let me think, is that all?

Wait, but in the previous step, after the first 6 hours, 30 leave; then in the next 6 hours, 15 return; then 60 return; then in the last 6 hours, 30 return.

So, the total number of bees in the hive after those 24 hours would be 30 (left) - 15 (returned) - 60 (returned) + 30 (returned again). Wait, that seems a bit confusing.

Wait, actually, maybe I should think in terms of net change.

But perhaps the problem is more straightforward. It doesn't ask for the total number of bees in the hive, but how many returned in the last 6 hours. So, if in the last 6 hours, every bee that left before hasn't returned yet, which is 30 bees, so 30 returned.

But let me re-examine the problem statement:

"Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours."

So, 30 leave first, 15 return.

Then, "she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours."

Wait, maybe I misinterpreted that part.

Wait, the next part is: "Then, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours."

Wait, so perhaps it's two times the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours, which is 60.

Then, "Then, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours."

Wait, so the "that" is referring to the last 6 hours. So, all the bees that left before that time (i.e., the 30 that left in the first 6 hours) haven't returned yet, so they come back.

So, in the last 6 hours, 30 return.

Therefore, the answer is 30.

But hold on, is that correct? Let me try to visualize the timeline.

1. First 6 hours: 30 leave. So, net change: -30.

2. Next 6 hours: 15 return. So, net change: -15.

3. Next 6 hours: 60 return. So, net change: -60.

4. Last 6 hours: 30 return. So, net change: -30.

Wait, but that would imply that at the end of the day, the number of bees in the hive is 30 - 15 - 60 + 30 = -15.

Wait, that can't be right because you can't have negative bees. So, maybe that's a red flag here.

Wait, perhaps I have to think differently.

Wait, is the last 6 hours adding 30 to the hive? Because if every bee that left before hasn't returned yet returns, that would mean that all 30 that left before are coming back.

But if they were just leaving, that would mean they are no longer in the hive. So, if they hadn't returned yet, they come back.

Therefore, in the last 6 hours, 30 come back.

But, then, how do we know the number of bees in the hive at the end of the day? Maybe that's not required.

But the question is, "How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours?"

So, regardless of the net change, the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is 30.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me go back.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in the last 6 hours, the 30 returning bees would include the ones that had left before, right? Or not.

Wait, the problem says: "every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours."

So, in the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns. So, the "that" refers to the last 6 hours.

So, the 30 that left before (the first 30) haven't returned yet, so they return.

So, in the last 6 hours, those 30 return.

Therefore, the number of bees returning is 30.

But let me see. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in the last 6 hours, the 30 returning bees include the ones that had left before. So, if the bees that left before hadn't returned yet, they are coming back, so perhaps in the last 6 hours, all the bees that have left before are coming back, which is 30.

But is that correct? Let me read the problem again:

"Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours."

So, the key phrase is "every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours."

So, the "that" refers to the last 6 hours. So, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns.

Therefore, in the last 6 hours, the 30 that left before are the ones that haven't returned yet, so they come back.

Therefore, the number of bees returning in the last 6 hours is 30.

Wait, but let me make sure that the timeline is accurate.

First 6 hours: 30 leave.

Next 6 hours: 15 return.

Next 6 hours: 60 return.

Then, in the last 6 hours: 30 return.

Therefore, in the last 6 hours, 30 return.

So, that would be the answer.

But wait, another way to think about it: the problem says she sees two times as many bees as the first 6 hours fly out. So, first 6 hours: 30 leave.

Then, next 6 hours: 15 return.

Next 6 hours: 60 return.

Then, in the next 6 hours, every bee that left before (i.e., the 30 that left in the first 6) hasn't returned yet, so they come back.

So, that's 30 bees.

Therefore, the answer is 30. So, 30 bees returned in the last 6 hours.

But I just want to think, is the problem perhaps trying to trick me into thinking that the number is 15 or 60? Because depending on how you parse it, it could be.

Wait, let me read it again.

"Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours."

So, that's 30 and 15.

"Then, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours."

So, two times as many as the first 6 hours. First 6 hours: 30 left. So, two times that would be 60.

"Then, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours."

So, the "that" refers to the last 6 hours.

So, in the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns. So, that's the 30.

Therefore, the number is 30. So, the answer is 30.

But wait, let me see if I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's 15 + 60 + 30? But that would be the total, but the question is about how many returned in the last 6 hours.

So, 30 is the answer.

Wait, but hold on, perhaps I should think about the net number of bees in the hive.

But the problem isn't asking for the net number, it's asking for how many returned in the last 6 hours.

So, it's 30.

Therefore, I think the answer is 30.

**Final Answer**
The number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours is \boxed{30}.
</think>

Debra is monitoring a beehive and counting how many bees return to the hive over a day. Here is the breakdown of the events:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half of those 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, two times as many bees as the first 6 hours return. Since 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours, two times that number is 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that (the 30 bees) hasn't already returned and will return. Therefore, 30 bees return to the hive.

Thus, the number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours is \boxed{30}.
