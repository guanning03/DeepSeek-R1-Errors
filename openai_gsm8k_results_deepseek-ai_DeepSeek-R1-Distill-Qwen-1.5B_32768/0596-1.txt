Question:
9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64" tall.  The 10th cheerleader is 60" tall.  If they build a human pyramid, where 4 girls are on the bottom,  3 stand on top of the 4, 2 stand on top of the 3 and the shortest girl is at the top, how tall is the human pyramid in feet?

Correct Answer:
All but one cheerleader is 64" tall and these cheerleaders make up the bottom 3 layers of the pyramid. So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192" tall
The shortest cheerleader is at the top of the pyramid and is 60" tall so the pyramid is 192+60 = <<252=252>>252" tall
12" are in 1 foot and the pyramid is 252" tall so it's 252/12 = <<252/12=21>>21 feet tall

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem about cheerleaders building a human pyramid. Let me try to understand it step by step.

First, it says that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th is 60 inches tall. That makes sense because 90% are 64 inches tall, which is 5 feet 4 inches, and the 10th is 5 feet. So, the pyramid is mostly 64-inch tall cheerleaders except for the shortest one, who is 60 inches tall.

Now, the pyramid structure is given as: 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on top of the 4, 2 on top of the 3, and the shortest girl is at the top. So, it's a triangular pyramid, right? Let me visualize it. The bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders, each supporting the ones above them. The layer above that has 3, then 2, and the very top has 1.

Since the pyramid is built with cheerleaders, their heights will contribute to the total height of the pyramid. But how exactly? I think we need to consider the height of each layer and how they add up.

Wait, but the problem says "how tall is the human pyramid in feet." So, maybe we need to find the total height of all the cheerleaders in the pyramid and then convert that to feet. That seems reasonable.

So, first, let me figure out how many cheerleaders are in each layer. The bottom layer has 4, then 3, then 2, and the top has 1. So, the pyramid has 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 cheerleaders. That matches the total number given in the problem (9 out of 10 are 64", 1 is 60"). So, that part makes sense.

Now, each layer's cheerleaders will be stacked vertically, right? So, the height of each layer is determined by the height of the cheerleaders in that layer. But since the pyramid is built with the cheerleaders, the height of each layer is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders in that layer.

But wait, in a human pyramid, the height of each layer is typically the height of the leader(s) in that layer. So, if you have 4 cheerleaders on the bottom, each 64 inches tall, their combined height would be 4 * 64 inches. Similarly, the next layer has 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, so their combined height is 3 * 64 inches, and so on.

But hold on, is the height of the pyramid just the total height of all the layers, or is it the height of the base? Hmm, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, "how tall is the human pyramid," which could be interpreted as the total height from the base to the top. Alternatively, it could just be the height of the base layer, but that seems less likely since it's a pyramid.

Given that it's a human pyramid, it's more reasonable that the height would be the height of the base layer, which is the bottom layer with 4 cheerleaders. But wait, let me confirm that.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because when you stack layers on top of each other, each layer is supported by the layer below it. So, the height of the entire pyramid would be the height of the base layer, which is the 4 cheerleaders. But that seems too simplistic because each layer above would add to the overall height.

But in this case, since each layer is just a single layer of cheerleaders, stacked on top of each other, the height of the pyramid would be the height of the base layer. Because the layers above are just supporting the base, not adding to the height. So, the height of the pyramid would be the same as the height of the base layer, which is 4 cheerleaders each 64 inches tall.

But that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. If all the cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, except one, which is 60 inches, then the pyramid is mostly 64 inches tall, but the top is 60 inches. So, would the height of the pyramid be just 64 inches, or would it be the average height?

Wait, no, in a human pyramid, the height of the pyramid is typically the maximum height, which is the height of the base layer. Because each layer is built on top of the previous one. So, even though some layers have shorter cheerleaders, the height of the pyramid is determined by the base layer.

But let me verify. If the base layer is 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, so the base layer is 4 * 64 inches. Then, the next layer is 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, so 3 * 64 inches. Then the next is 2 * 64 inches, and finally, the top is 1 * 60 inches.

But since the pyramid is built with each layer on top of the previous, the height of the pyramid would be the maximum height from the base to the top. But wait, actually, no. The height of the pyramid is the vertical distance from the base to the top. Since the base is 4 cheerleaders tall, and the top is 1 cheerleader, the height would be the height of the base layer.

But all cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, except one at the top, who is 60 inches tall. So, does that mean that the pyramid's height is 64 inches, or 60 inches?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the base is 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, then the base layer is 4 * 64 inches tall. So, the base is 256 inches tall, which is 21 feet 4 inches. But the top is just 60 inches tall, which is 5 feet.

But that seems inconsistent. So, maybe the pyramid's height is not just the base layer, but the total height from the ground to the top. But in that case, how is the total height calculated?

Wait, perhaps the height of the pyramid is the height of the topmost layer, which is 60 inches, but that seems too short. Or maybe it's the height of the base layer, which is 256 inches. But that seems too high.

Alternatively, maybe we have to consider that each layer contributes to the height, but the total height is the sum of the heights of all layers. So, 4 cheerleaders on the bottom layer, each 64 inches, so 4 * 64 = 256 inches. Then, 3 cheerleaders on top, each 64 inches, so 3 * 64 = 192 inches. Then, 2 cheerleaders on top, each 64 inches, so 2 * 64 = 128 inches. Then, 1 cheerleader on top, 60 inches. So, total height would be 256 + 192 + 128 + 60. Let me calculate that.

256 + 192 is 448. 448 + 128 is 576. 576 + 60 is 636 inches. Then, to convert 636 inches to feet, since 12 inches = 1 foot, 636 / 12 = 53 feet. So, the total height of the pyramid would be 53 feet.

But wait, but is that the correct way to calculate? Because in a human pyramid, the height is usually the vertical distance from the ground to the highest point, which would be the topmost layer's height. But in this case, the topmost layer is a single cheerleader at 60 inches tall, which is 5 feet. So, is the pyramid's height 5 feet? Or is it more?

Wait, maybe the confusion is between the height of each layer and the overall height of the pyramid. If each layer is built on top of the previous, the vertical height of the pyramid is determined by the height of the base layer. But each layer is a horizontal layer, so the height from the ground to the base would be the base layer's height. But the topmost layer is a single cheerleader, so the height from the ground to the top is the height of the top layer.

But that doesn't add up because the base layer is 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, so the base is 4 * 64 inches. But the top layer is 1 cheerleader, 60 inches tall. So, the pyramid's height is the height from the ground to the top, which is 60 inches, but that seems too short.

Wait, perhaps the height of the pyramid is the vertical height of the base layer. So, the base layer is 4 cheerleaders tall, each 64 inches, so the base is 4 * 64 inches, which is 256 inches, or 21 feet 4 inches. Then, the top is 1 cheerleader, 60 inches tall, so the total height from the ground to the top is 256 + 60 inches? That would be 316 inches, which is 26 feet 4 inches. Hmm, that makes more sense.

But wait, if the base is 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, their total height is 4 * 64 = 256 inches, as above. Then, the next layer is 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, so 3 * 64 = 192 inches. Then, the next layer is 2 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, so 2 * 64 = 128 inches. Finally, the top is 1 cheerleader, 60 inches tall.

But in terms of the pyramid's height, if it's built on top of each other, the total height would be the sum of the heights from the base to the top. So, from the ground to the base is 256 inches, and then from the base to the top is another 60 inches. So, the total height is 256 + 60 = 316 inches, which is 26 feet 4 inches.

Alternatively, maybe the pyramid's height is the maximum height, which is the height of the base layer, 256 inches (21 feet 4 inches). But since the top is shorter, maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the way to think about it is that each layer is a horizontal layer, so the height of the pyramid is the height of the base layer. So, the base layer is 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, so the base is 4 * 64 inches. Then, the next layer is 3 cheerleaders on top of it, each 64 inches tall, so the height of the next layer is 3 * 64 inches, and so on. But the height from the ground to the top is the height of the top layer, which is 1 cheerleader, 60 inches tall.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach: the pyramid's height is the height from the ground to the apex, which is the topmost point. Since the topmost point is a single cheerleader, 60 inches tall, then the height of the pyramid is 60 inches. But that seems too short because the base is 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, so the base is 4 * 64 = 256 inches, which is 21 feet 4 inches. So, the height of the pyramid is 60 inches, which is 5 feet. But that seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the pyramid is built with layers, each layer's height being the height of the leaders in that layer. So, the base layer is 4 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so the base is 4 * 64 inches. Then, the next layer is 3 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so 3 * 64 inches. Then, 2 leaders, 64 inches each, and then 1 leader, 60 inches tall. So, the height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of all the layers, which is 4*64 + 3*64 + 2*64 + 1*60.

Calculating that: 4*64 is 256, 3*64 is 192, 2*64 is 128, and 1*60 is 60. Adding them up: 256 + 192 is 448, 448 + 128 is 576, and 576 + 60 is 636 inches. Converting that to feet: 636 / 12 = 53 feet. So, 53 feet is the total height of the pyramid.

But wait, is this the correct interpretation? Because the base is 4 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so the base is 4*64 inches. Then, the next layer is 3 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so 3*64 inches. Then, 2 leaders, 64 inches each, and finally 1 leader, 60 inches. So, each layer is a horizontal layer, each 1 inch apart vertically. So, the height of the pyramid is the height from the ground to the topmost point, which would be the height of the top layer, which is 1 leader, 60 inches tall.

But that seems inconsistent because the base is higher than the top. So, how can the pyramid's height be just the height of the top layer?

Wait, perhaps the pyramid's height is the maximum height from the ground to any point in the pyramid. So, the base is 4 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so 4*64 = 256 inches. Then, the next layer is 3 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so 3*64 = 192 inches. Then, the next is 2 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so 128 inches. Finally, the top is 1 leader, 60 inches tall.

But when you build a pyramid, each layer is centered on top of the layer below. So, the base is the largest layer, and each subsequent layer is smaller, centered. The height of each layer is the height of the leaders in that layer. So, the base layer is 4 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so the base is 4 * 64 inches. Then, the next layer is 3 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so 3 * 64 inches. Then, the next is 2 leaders, 64 inches each, and finally, 1 leader, 60 inches.

But the height of the pyramid is the vertical height from the ground to the top of the base layer. So, the base layer is 4 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so the base is 4 * 64 inches. Then, the next layer is 3 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so the next layer is 3 * 64 inches. Then, the next is 2 leaders, 64 inches each, so 2 * 64 inches. Finally, the top is 1 leader, 60 inches tall.

But if you think about stacking them, the height from the ground to the base is 4*64 inches, and then each subsequent layer adds to the height? Wait, no. Each layer is placed on top of the previous one, but the vertical height of each layer is the height of the leaders in that layer.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to think of it as each layer's height is the height of the leaders in that layer, regardless of the layer above. So, the base layer is 4 leaders, each 64 inches, so total height is 4 * 64 = 256 inches. Then, the next layer is 3 leaders, each 64 inches, so 3 * 64 = 192 inches. Then, 2 leaders, 64 inches each, 128 inches. Finally, 1 leader, 60 inches. So, the total height of the pyramid is the sum of all these: 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches.

But then, how is the height of the pyramid defined? Is it the total vertical height from the ground to the topmost point? If the topmost point is 60 inches, then the pyramid's height is 60 inches. But that seems too short because the base is 4 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so 4 * 64 = 256 inches, which is 21 feet 4 inches. So, the height from the ground to the base is 256 inches, and then from the base to the top is another 60 inches. So, the total height from the ground to the top is 256 + 60 = 316 inches, which is 26 feet 4 inches.

I think that's more accurate. So, the height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of all the layers, meaning both the base layer and the top layer. Therefore, the total height is 636 inches, which is 53 feet. So, the answer would be 53 feet.

Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me double-check.

Each layer's height is the height of the leaders in that layer. So, base layer: 4 leaders, each 64 inches, so 4 * 64 = 256 inches. Next layer: 3 leaders, each 64 inches, so 3 * 64 = 192 inches. Next: 2 leaders, 64 inches each, so 128 inches. Top: 1 leader, 60 inches. So, total height is 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches, which is 53 feet.

Alternatively, if we consider each layer's height as the height of the leader(s) in that layer, regardless of the layer below, then the base layer is 4 * 64 = 256 inches. Then, the next layer is 3 * 64 = 192 inches. Then, 2 * 64 = 128 inches. Then, 1 * 60 = 60 inches. So, the total height is 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches, which is 53 feet.

So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the height of the pyramid is 53 feet.

**Final Answer**
The human pyramid is \boxed{53} feet tall.
</think>

First, we note that there are 10 cheerleaders in total, with 9 of them being 64 inches tall and 1 being 60 inches tall. The pyramid structure is as follows: 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on top of the 4, 2 on top of the 3, and the shortest girl on top. 

Each layer's height is determined by the height of the leaders in that layer. The base layer has 4 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so the base layer height is \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches. The next layer has 3 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so the height is \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches. The next layer has 2 leaders, each 64 inches tall, so the height is \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches. The top layer has 1 leader, 60 inches tall.

To find the total height of the pyramid, we sum the heights of all layers:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

Converting 636 inches to feet:
\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is \(\boxed{53}\) feet.
