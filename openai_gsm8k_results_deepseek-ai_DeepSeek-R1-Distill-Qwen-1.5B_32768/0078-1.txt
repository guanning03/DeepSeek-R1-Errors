Question:
Alex is getting ready to attend an event that she has hosted and wants to make sure that she has enough seats for everyone. She invites 100 people via email and each invited person says that they will also invite 2 of their friends. She then calls 10 of her friends to invite them too and 8 of them say they will be bringing their spouses. How many seats will Alex need?

Correct Answer:
Each of the people that were emailed are bringing 2 friends, which means that they will be in groups of 1 +2 = <<1+2=3>>3 people.
Since 100 people were emailed, this creates a total of 3 * 100 = <<3*100=300>>300 people.
Out of her friends, 8 people said that they will be bringing their spouse, so this is a total of 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 people.
Including her own seat, Alex is going to need a total of 300 + 18 +1 = <<300+18+1=319>>319 seats.
#### 319

Gold:
319

Wrong Prediction:
318

Wrong Answer:
First, Alex invites 100 people via email, and each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends. This means the number of people invited via email is 100 multiplied by 2, resulting in 200 additional friends.

Next, Alex calls 10 of her friends and invites them, adding 10 more people. Additionally, 8 of these friends bring their spouses, which adds another 8 people.

In total, Alex has invited 100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318 people.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats.

To determine how many seats Alex needs, let's break down the invitations step by step:

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - **Email Invites:** Alex invites **100 people** via email.
   - **Friends Invited:** Each of these 100 people will invite **2 friends**.
     \[
     100 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ friends per person} = 200 \text{ friends}
     \]

2. **Phone Calls Invitations:**
   - **Phone Calls Invites:** Alex calls **10 of her friends** and invites them.
     \[
     10 \text{ people}
     \]
   - **Spouses Invited:** Of these 10 friends, **8 of them** bring their **spouses**.
     \[
     8 \text{ people}
     \]

3. **Total Invitations:**
   - **Email Invites:** 100
   - **Friends Invited:** 200
   - **Phone Calls Invites:** 10
   - **Spouses Invited:** 8

   \[
   \text{Total Invitations} = 100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318 \text{ people}
   \]

Therefore, Alex will need \(\boxed{318}\) seats.
