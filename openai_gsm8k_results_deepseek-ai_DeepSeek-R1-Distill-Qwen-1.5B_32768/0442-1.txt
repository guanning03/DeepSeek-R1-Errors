Question:
Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles.  But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%.  If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?

Correct Answer:
If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.
10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.
The improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.
#### 36

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine Lee's original time for the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee runs them two seconds faster than Gerald, I'll denote Gerald's original time as \( t \) seconds. This means Lee's time is \( t - 2 \) seconds.

Next, I know that Lee's time is 38 seconds. So, I can set up the equation \( t - 2 = 38 \) and solve for \( t \). Adding 2 to both sides gives \( t = 40 \) seconds. This means Gerald's original time was 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10%, which directly affects his time. A 10% increase in speed means his time increases by 1 / 1.10, or approximately 9.09%. Calculating 9.09% of 40 seconds gives about 3.636 seconds. Adding this to the original time, Gerald's improved time is approximately \( 40 + 3.636 = 43.636 \) seconds.

Rounding to the nearest second, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in about 44 seconds.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in **38 seconds**.
- Lee runs **two seconds faster** than Gerald originally.
- Gerald's speed improved by **10%**.

**Step 1: Determine Gerald's original time.**

Since Lee runs two seconds faster than Gerald, we can write:

\[
\text{Lee's time} = \text{Gerald's original time} - 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Let \( t \) be Gerald's original time in seconds. Then:

\[
38 = t - 2
\]

**Step 2: Solve for Gerald's original time.**

\[
t = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the improvement in Gerald's time due to a 10% increase in speed.**

An **10% increase in speed** results in a **10% increase in time**. The formula for the new time after an **10% increase in speed** is:

\[
\text{New time} = \text{Original time} \times \left(1 + \frac{10}{100}\right) = \text{Original time} \times 1.10
\]

**Step 4: Apply the time increase to Gerald's original time.**

\[
\text{New time} = 40 \times 1.10 = 44 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{44}
\]
