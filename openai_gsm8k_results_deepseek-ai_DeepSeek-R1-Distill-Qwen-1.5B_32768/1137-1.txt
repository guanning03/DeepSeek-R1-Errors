Question:
In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, how many miles will Brian walk in seven days?

Correct Answer:
If Sofie walks 10 miles each day, she will walk 7*10 = <<10*7=70>>70 miles in seven days.
Since Sofie is walking twice as far as Brian, Brian will walk 70/2 = <<70/2=35>>35 miles in seven days.
#### 35

Gold:
35

Wrong Prediction:
245

Wrong Answer:
To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, I start by calculating the total distance Sofie will cover in that time. Sofie walks 10 miles each day, so over seven days, she will walk 10 multiplied by 7, which equals 70 miles.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian in the same period, I can set up an equation where Brian's distance multiplied by 2 equals Sofie's total distance. Let B represent Brian's daily walking distance. Therefore, 2B = 70.

To find Brian's daily distance, I divide both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in B = 35 miles per day.

Finally, to find Brian's total distance over seven days, I multiply his daily distance by 7, which gives 35 multiplied by 7, equaling 245 miles.

**Solution:**

Let's determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days.

1. **Calculate Sofie's total distance in seven days:**
   
   Sofie walks **10 miles** each day.
   
   \[
   \text{Total distance Sofie walks} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Set up the relationship between Sofie's and Brian's distances:**
   
   Sofie walks twice as far as Brian in seven days.
   
   \[
   \text{Sofie's distance} = 2 \times \text{Brian's distance}
   \]
   
   \[
   70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times \text{Brian's distance}
   \]

3. **Solve for Brian's distance:**
   
   \[
   \text{Brian's distance} = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate Brian's total distance over seven days:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total distance Brian walks} = 35 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 245 \text{ miles}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{245}
\]
