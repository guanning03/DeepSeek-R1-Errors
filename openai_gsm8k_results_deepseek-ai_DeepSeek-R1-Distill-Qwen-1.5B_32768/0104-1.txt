Question:
It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish a crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to finish a sudoku puzzle.  Over the weekend she solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 sudoku puzzles.  How much time did she spend playing these games?

Correct Answer:
It takes 10 minutes to complete a crossword puzzle and she completed 3 for a total of 10*3 = <<10*3=30>>30 minutes
It takes 5 minutes to complete a sudoku puzzle and she completed 8 for a total of 5*8 = <<5*8=40>>40 minutes
She spent 30 minutes on crosswords and 40 minutes on sudoku for a total of 30+40 = <<30+40=70>>70 minutes

Wrong Answer:
To determine how much time Carmen spent playing these games over the weekend, I'll calculate the time she spent on each type of puzzle separately and then add them together.

First, for the crossword puzzles: She solved 3 puzzles, each taking 10 minutes. So, 3 multiplied by 10 minutes equals 30 minutes.

Next, for the sudoku puzzles: She solved 8 puzzles, each taking 5 minutes. Calculating that, 8 multiplied by 5 minutes equals 40 minutes.

Finally, I'll add both times together: 30 minutes plus 40 minutes equals a total of 70 minutes.

To determine how much time Carmen spent playing crossword and sudoku puzzles over the weekend, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. **Crossword Puzzles:**
   
   - **Number of Crossword Puzzles:** 3
   - **Time per crossword puzzle:** 10 minutes
   
   \[
   \text{Total time for crossword puzzles} = 3 \times 10\ \text{minutes} = 30\ \text{minutes}
   \]

2. **Sudoku Puzzles:**
   
   - **Number of Sudoku Puzzles:** 8
   - **Time per sudoku puzzle:** 5 minutes
   
   \[
   \text{Total time for sudoku puzzles} = 8 \times 5\ \text{minutes} = 40\ \text{minutes}
   \]

3. **Total Time Spent:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time for crossword puzzles} + \text{Time for sudoku puzzles} = 30\ \text{minutes} + 40\ \text{minutes} = 70\ \text{minutes}
   \]

\[
\boxed{70\ \text{minutes}}
\]
