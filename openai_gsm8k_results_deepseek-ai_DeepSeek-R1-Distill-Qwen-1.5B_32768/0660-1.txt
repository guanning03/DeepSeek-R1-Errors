Question:
A cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein.  If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day how many grams of protein does he get per week?

Correct Answer:
He eats 200/100=<<200/100=2>>2 cups per day
So that means he gets 2*3=<<6=6>>6 grams of protein per day
So he gets 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 grams of protein per week
#### 42

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, I can calculate the protein in 200 grams by multiplying 3 grams by 2, which gives 6 grams of protein per day.

Next, to find out how much protein John consumes in a week, I'll multiply the daily protein intake by 7 days. This means 6 grams multiplied by 7 equals 42 grams of protein per week.

To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week when eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, follow these steps:

1. **Find the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   
   \[
   \frac{3\ \text{grams of protein}}{100\ \text{grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03\ \text{grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}
   \]

2. **Calculate the protein intake for 200 grams of mushrooms per day:**
   
   \[
   200\ \text{grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03\ \frac{\text{grams of protein}}{\text{gram of mushrooms}} = 6\ \text{grams of protein per day}
   \]

3. **Determine the protein intake for a week (7 days):**
   
   \[
   6\ \text{grams of protein per day} \times 7\ \text{days} = 42\ \text{grams of protein per week}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{42\ \text{grams}}
\]
