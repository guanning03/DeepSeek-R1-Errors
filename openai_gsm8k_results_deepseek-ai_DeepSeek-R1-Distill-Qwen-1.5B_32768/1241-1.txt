Question:
Elise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Elise written in total?

Correct Answer:
Elise has written the alphabet twice which is a total of 26 * 2 = <<26*2=52>>52 letters.
She then writes half the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = <<26/2=13>>13 letters.
So far, this is a total of 52 + 13 = <<52+13=65>>65 letters.
Writing this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 65 * 2 = <<65*2=130>>130 letters.
#### 130

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many letters Elise has written in each step.

Initially, Elise writes the full alphabet, which has 26 letters.

She writes the full alphabet again, adding another 26 letters, making a total of 52 letters so far.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet. Since the full alphabet has 26 letters, half of that is 13 letters.

After that, she rewrites everything she has already written. This means she writes the full alphabet again, adding another 26 letters.

Finally, she rewrites everything she has already written again, which is the full alphabet, adding another 26 letters.

Adding all these together, Elise has written a total of 26 + 26 + 13 + 26 + 26 = 117 letters.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the total number of letters Elise has written.

1. **Full Alphabet (First Writing):**
   - **Letters:** 26
   - **Total Written:** 26

2. **Full Alphabet (Second Writing):**
   - **Letters:** 26
   - **Total Written:** 26 + 26 = 52

3. **Half Alphabet:**
   - **Letters:** 26 / 2 = 13
   - **Total Written:** 52 + 13 = 65

4. **Rewriting Everything Already Written (First Re-write):**
   - **Letters:** 26
   - **Total Written:** 65 + 26 = 91

5. **Rewriting Everything Already Written (Second Re-write):**
   - **Letters:** 26
   - **Total Written:** 91 + 26 = 117

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{117}
\]
