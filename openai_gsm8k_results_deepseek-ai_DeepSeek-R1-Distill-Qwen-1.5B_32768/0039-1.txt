Question:
A dance studio offers lessons to students. It costs $25 per session to rent the studio plus $1.50 per student per session. At present, the dance studio has 10 students and is rented 3 days a week. How much are the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month?

Correct Answer:
The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.
So the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.
Thus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.
Therefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total number of students expected in a month. Since there are currently 10 students and the studio is rented 3 days a week, I'll calculate the monthly student count by multiplying 10 by the number of weeks in a month, which is approximately 4, leading to 40 students.

Next, I'll calculate the earnings from the students. Each student pays $1.50 per session, and there are 40 students. Multiplying these together gives $600 in earnings from students.

Then, I'll calculate the earnings from renting the studio. The studio charges $25 per session, and it's rented 3 days a week. Over a month of 4 weeks, the number of sessions is 12. Multiplying these gives $300 in studio earnings.

Finally, I'll add the earnings from both the studio and the students to find the total expected earnings: $300 plus $600 equals $900.

To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Given:**
- **Studio Rental Cost:** \$25 per session
- **Cost per Student per Session:** \$1.50
- **Current Number of Students:** 10
- **Studio Rental Frequency:** 3 days per week

### **Step 1: Calculate the Number of Sessions in a Month**

- **Number of Weeks in a Month:** Approximately 4 weeks.
- **Total Sessions:** 
  \[
  \text{Total Sessions} = \text{Number of Students} \times \text{Sessions per Week} \times \text{Number of Weeks}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total Sessions} = 10 \times 3 \times 4 = 120 \text{ sessions}
  \]

### **Step 2: Calculate Earnings from Students**

\[
\text{Earnings from Students} = \text{Number of Students} \times \text{Cost per Student per Session} \times \text{Total Sessions}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from Students} = 10 \times 1.50 \times 120 = \$1,800
\]

### **Step 3: Calculate Earnings from Renting the Studio**

\[
\text{Earnings from Studio Rental} = \text{Studio Rental Cost per Session} \times \text{Total Sessions}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from Studio Rental} = 25 \times 120 = \$3,000
\]

### **Step 4: Calculate Total Expected Earnings**

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings from Students} + \text{Earnings from Studio Rental}
\]
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \$1,800 + \$3,000 = \$4,800
\]

\[
\boxed{\$4,\!800}
\]
