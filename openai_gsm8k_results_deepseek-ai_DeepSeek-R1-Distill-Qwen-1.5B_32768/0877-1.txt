Question:
Antoine's french onion soup recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions. He likes to double that amount. His soup serves 6 people. The onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, that are also on sale for $2.00 a box.  What is the cost per serving? (Round to the nearest integer.)

Correct Answer:
His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions but he wants to double that amount so he needs 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds of onions
Onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound so they will cost 4*2 = $8.00
He needs 2 boxes of stock which are also on sale for $2.00 so they will cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00
The onions are $8.00 and the stock is $4.00 for a total of 8+4 = $<<8+4=12.00>>12.00
The soup serves 6 people and the total cost is $12.00 so each serving is 12/6 = $<<12/6=2.00>>2.00 a serving

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the total amount of onions Antoine needs. He plans to double the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds. Doubling 2 pounds gives him 4 pounds of onions.

Next, find out how much beef stock he requires. He needs 2 boxes, each costing $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is 2 boxes multiplied by $2.00 per box, resulting in $4.00.

Then, calculate the total cost for both the onions and the beef stock. The onions cost $2.00 per pound for 4 pounds, totaling $8.00. Adding the $4.00 for the beef stock gives a combined cost of $12.00.

Now, determine the number of servings. The recipe serves 6 people, and he is doubling the amount, resulting in 12 servings.

Finally, calculate the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings. Dividing $12.00 by 12 servings gives a cost of $1.00 per serving.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the Amount of Onions Needed:**
   - **Original Recipe:** 2 pounds of onions.
   - **Amount Antoine Plans to Use:** He needs to double the recipe.
   - **Total Onions Needed:** 
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Cost of Onions:**
   - **Price per Pound:** \$2.00
   - **Total Cost for Onions:** 
     \[
     4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00
     \]

3. **Determine the Amount of Beef Stock Needed:**
   - **Number of Boxes:** 2
   - **Total Cost for Beef Stock:** 
     \[
     2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   \[
   \$8.00 \text{ (Onions)} + \$4.00 \text{ (Beef Stock)} = \$12.00
   \]

5. **Determine the Number of Servings:**
   - **Original Recipe Serves:** 6
   - **Total Servings:** 
     \[
     6 \text{ servings} \times 2 = 12 \text{ servings}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Cost Per Serving:**
   \[
   \frac{\$12.00}{12 \text{ servings}} = \$1.00 \text{ per serving}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
