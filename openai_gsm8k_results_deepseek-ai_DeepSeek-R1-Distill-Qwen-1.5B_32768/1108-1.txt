Question:
Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Correct Answer:
Pat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.
Pat needs to buy 74 plants - 17 plants = <<74-17=57>>57 plants needed to purchase.
Pat will spend 57 plants * $6 = $<<57*6=342>>342.
#### 342

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many plants Pat needs to fill her 111-foot-long flower bed.

Each plant requires 12 inches, which is 1 foot, plus a 1.5-foot gap between every two plants. This means each plant effectively takes up 2.5 feet of space.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of plants needed by dividing the length of the flower bed by the space each plant occupies. This gives me approximately 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs an additional 27 plants.

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost will be 27 plants multiplied by $6 per plant, which equals $162.

To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill her flower bed, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - **Total length of the flower bed:** 111 feet
   - **Width of each plant:** 12 inches (which is 1 foot)
   - **Gap between each plant:** 1.5 feet
   - **Number of plants Pat already owns:** 17
   - **Cost per plant:** \$6

2. **Calculate the Space Required Per Plant:**
   - Each plant takes up **1 foot** of space.
   - Plus, there's a **1.5-foot gap** between each plant.
   - **Total space per plant:** \(1 + 1.5 = 2.5\) feet

3. **Determine the Total Number of Plants Needed:**
   - **Total length of the flower bed:** 111 feet
   - **Number of plants needed:** \(\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4\) plants

   Since Pat can't buy a fraction of a plant, she needs to round up to the next whole number:
   - **Total plants needed:** 45

4. **Account for the Plants Pat Already Owns:**
   - **Plants already owned:** 17
   - **Plants to buy:** \(45 - 17 = 28\)

5. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   - **Number of plants to buy:** 28
   - **Cost per plant:** \$6
   - **Total cost:** \(28 \times 6 = \$168\)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{168}
\]
