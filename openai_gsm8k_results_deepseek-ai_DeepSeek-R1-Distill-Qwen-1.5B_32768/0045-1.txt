Question:
James gets a job selling used cars.  He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each.  The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars.  He got a 10% commission on the profits.  How much did he make?

Correct Answer:
He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000
Each car was bought for 25,000*.3=$<<25000*.3=7500>>7500
So they bought the cars for 7500*10=$<<7500*10=75000>>75,000
That means the cars had a profit of 250,000-75,000=$<<250000-75000=175000>>175,000
So his commission was 175,000*.1=$<<175000*.1=17500>>17,500
#### 17500

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total revenue James earned from selling the cars. He sold 10 cars, each priced at $25,000. So, the total revenue is 10 multiplied by $25,000.

Next, I'll calculate the cost of acquiring the cars. The company paid 30% of the price to the seller, which means the cost is 30% of $25,000.

Once I have the total revenue and the cost, I'll subtract the cost from the revenue to find the profit. Finally, James earns a 10% commission on the profits. I'll apply this commission to the calculated profit and add it to the profit itself to find the total amount James made.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Total Revenue:**
   
   James sold 10 cars, each costing \$25,000.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000
   \]

2. **Determine the Cost of Acquisition:**
   
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars.
   
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 30\% \times \$25,000 = 0.30 \times \$25,000 = \$7,500
   \]

3. **Calculate Profit:**
   
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Cost} = \$250,000 - \$7,500 = \$242,500
   \]

4. **Compute James's Commission on Profit:**
   
   James earned a 10% commission on the profits.
   
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 10\% \times \$242,500 = 0.10 \times \$242,500 = \$24,250
   \]

5. **Determine James's Total Earnings:**
   
   James's total earnings include both the profit and the commission.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = \$242,500 + \$24,250 = \$266,750
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$266,750}
\]
