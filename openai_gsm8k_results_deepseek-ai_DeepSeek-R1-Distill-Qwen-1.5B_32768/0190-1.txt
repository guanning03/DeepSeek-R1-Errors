Question:
Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the first race, he lost $5. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?

Correct Answer:
On the second race he won $11 because 1+ 5 x 2 = <<1+5*2=11>>11
On the third race he lost $15 because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15
He lost a total of $20 on the first and third races because 15 + 5 = <<15+5=20>>20

He lost $9 that day because 11 - 20 = <<11-20=-9>>-9
He lost an average of $3 per race because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how much Johnny's dad lost on each race.

On the first race, he lost $5.

For the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost on the first race. So, twice $5 is $10, plus $1 equals $11. Therefore, he won $11 on the second race.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won on the second race. So, 1.5 times $11 is $16.50.

To find the total loss, I add the losses from the first and third races: $5 + $16.50 equals $21.50.

Finally, to find the average loss per race, I divide the total loss by the number of races, which is 3. So, $21.50 divided by 3 equals approximately $7.17.

Let's break down Johnny's dad's horse racing outcomes step by step to determine the average loss he incurred per race.

1. **First Race:**
   - **Loss:** Johnny's dad lost **\$5**.
   - **Total Loss:** \$5

2. **Second Race:**
   - **Win:** He won **\$1 more than twice the amount he previously lost**.
     - Twice the loss from the first race: \(2 \times \$5 = \$10\).
     - Adding the extra \$1: \(\$10 + \$1 = \$11\).
   - **Total Win:** \$11

3. **Third Race:**
   - **Loss:** He lost **1.5 times as much as he won on the second race**.
     - Calculate 1.5 times the win from the second race: \(1.5 \times \$11 = \$16.50\).
   - **Total Loss:** \$16.50

4. **Total Loss Over Three Races:**
   - **First Race Loss:** \$5
   - **Second Race Loss:** \$0 (He won)
   - **Third Race Loss:** \$16.50
   - **Total Loss:** \$5 + \$0 + \$16.50 = **\$21.50**

5. **Average Loss Per Race:**
   - **Total Loss:** \$21.50
   - **Number of Races:** 3
   - **Average Loss:** \(\frac{\$21.50}{3} = \$7.17\)

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{7.17}
