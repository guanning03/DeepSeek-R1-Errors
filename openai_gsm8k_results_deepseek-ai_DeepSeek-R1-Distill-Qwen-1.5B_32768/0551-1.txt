Question:
A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12. There's currently a special size box for the same price that has 20% more pods. How many dishwashing cycles with the new box can you run for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle?

Correct Answer:
If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10
If 1 cycle costs $0.10, then for $1 I could run $1/$0.1 = 10 cycles
#### 10

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the cost per pod for both the original and special boxes. The original box has 100 pods for $12, so the cost per pod is $12 divided by 100, which is $0.12 per pod.

The special box costs the same $12 but contains 20% more pods than the original. Calculating 20% of 100 pods gives 20 additional pods, making the total number of pods 120. Therefore, the cost per pod for the special box is $12 divided by 120 pods, which is $0.10 per pod.

With $1, I can buy 100 original pods or 120 special pods. Since the question asks how many cycles I can run using 1 pod per cycle, and each cycle uses one pod, I can run 100 cycles with the original box or 120 cycles with the special box.

To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run with \$1 using the special box, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Regular Box:**
  - **Number of pods:** 100
  - **Cost:** \$12
- **Special Box:**
  - **Number of pods:** 20% more than the regular box
  - **Cost:** \$12
- **Pods per cycle:** 1

**Step 1: Calculate the Number of Pods in the Special Box**

The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box.

\[
\text{Additional pods} = 20\% \times 100 = 20
\]
\[
\text{Total pods in special box} = 100 + 20 = 120
\]

**Step 2: Determine the Cost per Pod in the Special Box**

The special box costs \$12 for 120 pods.

\[
\text{Cost per pod in special box} = \frac{12}{120} = \$0.10 \text{ per pod}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Cycles with \$1**

With \$1, you can buy 100 regular pods or 120 special pods.

\[
\text{Number of cycles} = \$1 \div \$0.10 = 10 \text{ cycles}
\]

\[
\text{Or, with \$1, you can buy } 120 \text{ special pods} \div 1 \text{ pod per cycle} = 120 \text{ cycles}
\]

However, since the question asks **how many cycles** you can run **for \$1**, depending on which box you choose, you can run either **10 cycles** or **120 cycles**.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{120}
\]
