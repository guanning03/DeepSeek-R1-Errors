Question:
Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.  His laundry machine will only allow him to wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.  How many loads of laundry does he do in a year?

Correct Answer:
He has to wash 4 twin size sheet sets each week and the machine will only let him do 2 sets at a time so he has to do 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 loads of twin size sheets
He does 2 loads of twin size sheets and 1 load for king size sheets every week for a total of 2+1 = <<2+1=3>>3 loads
Over 52 weeks (1 year) he does 3 loads of laundry a week for a total of 52*3 = <<3*52=156>>156 loads of laundry
#### 156

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many sets of sheets Greg uses in a year.

There are 4 twin beds and 1 king-sized bed, making a total of 5 beds.

Each twin bed has 2 sheets, so 4 twin beds equal 8 sheets. The king-sized bed has 1 sheet, adding 1 more sheet, resulting in a total of 9 sheets.

Next, I'll calculate how many times Greg can wash the sheets. The laundry machine can handle 2 sets of twin sheets and 1 set of king sheets at a time.

For the twin sheets, since there are 8 sheets, Greg can wash 4 sets at a time. Each laundry load can cover 2 sets, so he needs 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin sheets.

For the king-sized sheets, there's only 1 set, so he needs 1 load.

Adding both, Greg will do a total of 2 loads for the twin sheets and 1 load for the king-sized bed, resulting in 3 loads of laundry in a year.

To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Sheets

Greg uses:
- 4 twin beds
- 1 king-sized bed

Each twin bed has **2 sheets**, so:
- **Twin sheets**: \(4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ sheets/bed} = 8 \text{ sheets}\)

The king-sized bed has **1 sheet**, so:
- **King sheet**: \(1 \text{ bed} \times 1 \text{ sheet/bed} = 1 \text{ sheet}\)

**Total sheets per year**:
\[
8 \text{ sheets (twin)} + 1 \text{ sheet (king)} = 9 \text{ sheets}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Laundry Loads

Greg's laundry machine can handle:
- **2 sets of twin sheets at a time**
- **1 set of king-sized sheets at a time**

**Calculating for Twin Sheets:**
- Total twin sheets: 8
- Sheets per load: 2
- Number of loads for twin sheets:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ sheets}}{2 \text{ sheets/load}} = 4 \text{ loads}
\]

**Calculating for King Sheet:**
- Total king sheet: 1
- Sheets per load: 1
- Number of loads for king sheet:
\[
\frac{1 \text{ sheet}}{1 \text{ sheet/load}} = 1 \text{ load}
\]

**Total Laundry Loads:**
\[
4 \text{ loads (twin)} + 1 \text{ load (king)} = \boxed{5 \text{ loads}}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
