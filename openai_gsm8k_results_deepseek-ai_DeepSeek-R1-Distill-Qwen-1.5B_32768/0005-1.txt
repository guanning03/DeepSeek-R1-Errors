Question:
Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?

Correct Answer:
He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5
He earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5
It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13
#### 13

Wrong Answer:
To determine how many years it will take Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, I'll analyze the cash flows year by year.

First, I'll calculate the net cash flow each year by subtracting the cost of watering and feeding from the revenue generated from selling the lemons.

For each year:
- Revenue from selling lemons: 7 lemons * $1.5 = $10.50
- Cost of watering and feeding: $3
- Net cash flow per year: $10.50 - $3 = $7.50

Next, I'll consider the initial planting cost of $90. After the first year, the net cash flow of $7.50 will be offset by the $90 investment.

After 3 years, the total cash flow from netting $7.50 per year will be $22.50. This amount will be used to cover the initial $90 investment, resulting in a net profit of $32.50.

Therefore, it will take Carlos 3 years before he starts earning money from his lemon tree.

To determine how many years it will take Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, let's analyze the cash flows year by year.

**Given:**
- **Cost to plant the tree:** \$90
- **Growth per year:** 7 lemons
- **Selling price per lemon:** \$1.50
- **Watering and feeding cost per year:** \$3
- **Net cash flow per year (Revenue - Cost):** \$10.50 - \$3 = \$7.50

**Steps to Calculate Net Cash Flow and Earnings:**

1. **Year 1:**
   - **Revenue:** 7 lemons * \$1.50 = \$10.50
   - **Cost:** \$3
   - **Net Cash Flow:** \$10.50 - \$3 = \$7.50
   
2. **Year 2:**
   - **Revenue:** 7 lemons * \$1.50 = \$10.50
   - **Cost:** \$3
   - **Net Cash Flow:** \$10.50 - \$3 = \$7.50
   
3. **Year 3:**
   - **Revenue:** 7 lemons * \$1.50 = \$10.50
   - **Cost:** \$3
   - **Net Cash Flow:** \$10.50 - \$3 = \$7.50

**Calculating the Total Net Cash Flow After 3 Years:**
\[
\text{Total Net Cash Flow after 3 Years} = 3 \times \$7.50 = \$22.50
\]

**Covering the Initial Investment:**
- **Initial Investment:** \$90
- **Total Net Cash Flow after 3 Years:** \$22.50

Since \$22.50 is less than \$90, it means Carlos will have spent more than the initial investment after 3 years. Therefore, he will start earning money after **3 years**.

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
