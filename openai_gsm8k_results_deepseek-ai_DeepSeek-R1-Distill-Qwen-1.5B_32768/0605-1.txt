Question:
Colby loves going to the movies and every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies. Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Tickets for any other day cost $7. Popcorn costs $8 and boxes of candy cost $2. It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?

Correct Answer:
He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50
He has spent $56 on movies the rest of the day because 8 x 7 = <<8*7=56>>56
He has spent $16 on popcorn because 2 x 8 = <<16=16>>16
He has spent $8 on candy because 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8
He has spent 130 in total because 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = <<50+56+16+8=130>>130
He plans to spend $10 on popcorn and candy because 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10
He has $10 left to spend because 150 - 130 - 10 = <<150-130-10=10>>10
He can see 1 movie because 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1

Wrong Answer:
First, determine how many movies Colby has already seen. He saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays and 8 on other days, totaling 13. The month has 30 days, so he has 17 days left. Each Friday or Saturday allows him to see one movie, and each other day also allows one movie. He has watched 2 Fridays and 6 other days, leaving 11 days for more movies.

Next, calculate the total cost of the already seen movies. For Fridays and Saturdays, 2 tickets cost $20, and 6 tickets cost $42, totaling $62. For 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each and 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, the cost is $24.

Subtract the total expenses from the $150 to find the remaining money: $150 - $62 - $24 = $64.

Now, determine how many additional movies he can see with $64. Each movie costs $7 on Fridays or Saturdays and $5 on other days. He can see 11 more movies, but needs to account for the different ticket prices. The maximum number of movies he can see is 11, using $67 (7*11), but he only has $64. Therefore, he can see 10 movies, spending $70, which exceeds his budget. So, he can see 10 more movies.

To determine how many more movies Colby can see this month, let's break down the information step by step.

### **Given:**
- **Total monthly budget:** \$150
- **Movies per month:** 30
- **Movies already seen:**
  - **Fridays/Saturdays:** 5 (tickets cost \$10 each)
  - **Other days:** 8 (tickets cost \$7 each)
  - **Total already seen:** 5 + 8 = **13 movies**
- **Movies remaining in the month:** 30 - 13 = **17 days**
- **Movies already watched on Fridays/Saturdays:**
  - **Fridays:** 2 (tickets cost \$10 each)
  - **Other days:** 6 (tickets cost \$7 each)
  - **Cost of already seen Friday movies:** 2 * \$10 = **\$20**
  - **Cost of already seen Saturday movies:** 6 * \$7 = **\$42**
- **Popcorn and candy already purchased:**
  - **Popcorn:** 2 tubs * \$8 = **\$16**
  - **Candy:** 4 boxes * \$2 = **\$8**
  - **Total spent on popcorn and candy:** \$16 + \$8 = **\$24**

### **Calculations:**
1. **Total money spent on already seen movies:**
   \[
   \$20 (\text{Fridays}) + \$42 (\text{Saturdays}) + \$24 (\text{Popcorn and Candy}) = \$86
   \]
2. **Money remaining for additional movies:**
   \[
   \$150 - \$86 = \$64
   \]
3. **Determine the number of additional movies based on ticket prices:**
   - **Fridays/Saturdays:** Each movie costs \$10.
     \[
     \frac{\$64}{\$10} = 6.4 \Rightarrow 6 \text{ movies}
     \]
   - **Other days:** Each movie costs \$7.
     \[
     \frac{\$64}{\$7} \approx 9.14 \Rightarrow 9 \text{ movies}
     \]
4. **Since additional movies can be seen on either day, the maximum number of movies he can see is:**
   \[
   6 \text{ (Fridays/Saturdays)} + 9 \text{ (Other days)} = 15 \text{ movies}
   \]

### **Final Answer:**
Colby can see a total of \(\boxed{15}\) additional movies this month.
