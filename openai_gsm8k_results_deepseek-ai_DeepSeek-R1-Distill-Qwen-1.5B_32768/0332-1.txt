Question:
Violetta wants to buy new crayons. She needs them in 5 different colors and prepared $20 for this purchase. One crayon costs $2. How much change will she get?

Correct Answer:
Violetta is going to pay 5 * 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 for the crayons she wants.
If she pays $20, she will get 20 - 10 = $<<20-10=10>>10 of change.

Wrong Prediction:
20

Wrong Answer:
Violetta needs 20 crayons in different colors and has already spent $20 on them.

Each crayon costs $2, so 20 crayons will cost 20 multiplied by $2, which equals $40.

Violetta has $20 initially, but she needs $40 worth of crayons.

Since she doesn't have enough money, she will not receive any change.

To determine how much change Violetta will receive, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the crayons:**
   - Violetta needs **20** crayons.
   - Each crayon costs **\$2**.
   - **Total cost** = Number of crayons Ã— Cost per crayon
   - **Total cost** = \( 20 \text{ crayons} \times \$2/\text{crayon} = \$40 \)

2. **Determine the change:**
   - Violetta has **\$20** initially.
   - **Change** = Total cost - Initial amount
   - **Change** = \( \$40 - \$20 = \$20 \)

However, since Violetta only has **\$20** and needs **\$40**, she does not have enough money to make the purchase. Therefore, she will not receive any change.

\[
\boxed{\$20}
\]
