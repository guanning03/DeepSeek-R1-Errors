Question:
Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?

Correct Answer:
Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.
The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.
Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the original prices of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans.

The tattered jeans cost $28.

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so their original price is $28 - $6 = $22.

Next, I'll calculate the total savings from each type of jeans.

Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the remaining 2/3 from the tattered jeans.

Let x be the total savings. Then, the savings from jogger jeans are (1/3)x, and from tattered jeans are (2/3)x.

The savings from jogger jeans are $22, and from tattered jeans are $28. Therefore:

(1/3)x = 22
(2/3)x = 28

Solving for x gives the total savings. However, since we're interested in the difference in original prices, I'll subtract the jogger jeans' original price from the tattered jeans' original price.

$28 - $22 = $6.

Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than tattered jeans.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans.

**Given:**
- **Tattered jeans:** \$28
- **Jogger jeans:** \$6 less than tattered jeans
- **Total savings:** He saved \$6 in total by purchasing both jeans.

**Let’s denote:**
- Let \( x \) be the total savings.

**Step 1: Determine the original price of jogger jeans**

The jogger jeans cost \$6 less than the tattered jeans.

\[
\text{Original price of jogger jeans} = \$28 - \$6 = \$22
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the savings from each type of jeans**

Let’s define:
- \( S_j \) as the savings from jogger jeans
- \( S_t \) as the savings from tattered jeans

Given that:
\[
S_j = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total Savings} = \frac{1}{3}x
\]
\[
S_t = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Savings} = \frac{2}{3}x
\]

We know the savings from each type of jeans:
\[
S_j = \$22 \quad \text{and} \quad S_t = \$28
\]

**Step 3: Set up the equations**

\[
\frac{1}{3}x = 22 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
\frac{2}{3}x = 28 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \) (Total Savings)**

From equation (1):
\[
x = 22 \times 3 = 66
\]

**Step 5: Verify with equation (2)**

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 66 = 44
\]

However, this does not match the given savings of \$28 for tattered jeans. This discrepancy suggests a miscalculation. Let's re-examine the problem.

**Re-evaluating the Approach:**

Let’s denote:
- \( S_j \) as the savings from jogger jeans
- \( S_t \) as the savings from tattered jeans

Given:
\[
S_j = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total Savings} = \frac{1}{3}x
\]
\[
S_t = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Savings} = \frac{2}{3}x
\]

We know:
\[
S_j = \$22 \quad \text{and} \quad S_t = \$28
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{1}{3}x = 22 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 66
\]
\[
\frac{2}{3}x = 28 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 42
\]

There's an inconsistency here, indicating an error in the problem setup. To resolve this, let's interpret the savings differently.

**Alternative Interpretation:**

Assume that:
- The savings from jogger jeans are \$22
- The savings from tattered jeans are \$28
- The total savings \( x = 22 + 28 = \$50 \)

This contradicts the given savings of \$6. Therefore, there must be a different approach.

**Correct Interpretation:**

Let’s denote:
- \( t \) as the total savings
- The savings from jogger jeans are \( \frac{1}{3}t \)
- The savings from tattered jeans are \( \frac{2}{3}t \)

Given:
\[
\text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \$22 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{3}t = 22 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = 66
\]
\[
\text{Savings from tattered jeans} = \$28 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{2}{3}t = 28 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = 42
\]

The total savings \( t \) cannot be both 66 and 42 simultaneously. This indicates a contradiction in the problem statement.

**Conclusion:**

Given the provided information, there's an inconsistency in the savings amounts. Therefore, it's not possible to determine the original prices based on the given data. However, based on the initial calculation:

\[
\text{Original price of jogger jeans} = \$22
\]
\[
\text{Original price of tattered jeans} = \$28
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = \$28 - \$22 = \$6
\]

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{6}
