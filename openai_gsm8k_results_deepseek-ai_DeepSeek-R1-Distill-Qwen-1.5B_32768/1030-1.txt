Question:
Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays.  On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class.  How many hours a week did she have dance practice?

Correct Answer:
She had practice for 1 hour on Tuesday and 2 hours on Thursday so she practiced for 1+2 = <<1+2=3>>3 hours
Saturday's class was twice as long as Tuesday's so she danced 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 hours on Saturday
In one week she danced 3 hours on the weekdays and 2 hours on the weekend for a total of 3+2 = <<3+2=5>>5 hours

Wrong Answer:
First, identify the duration of dance practice during each class: Tuesday is 1 hour, Thursday is 2 hours, and Saturday is twice the duration of Tuesday's practice, which is 2 hours.

Next, calculate the total number of practice sessions in a week: Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, totaling 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 sessions.

Finally, multiply the number of sessions by the duration of each practice to find the total weekly hours: 5 sessions * 1 hour = 5 hours.

**Solution:**

Let's break down Hallie's dance practice schedule:

1. **Tuesday:** Hallie had 1 hour of dance practice.
2. **Thursday:** She had 2 hours of dance practice.
3. **Saturday:** She had twice as long as Tuesday's practice. Since Tuesday's practice was 1 hour, Saturday's practice was:
   \[
   2 \times 1\ \text{hour} = 2\ \text{hours}
   \]

**Total Dance Practice Hours in a Week:**

\[
\text{Total} = \text{Tuesday} + \text{Thursday} + \text{Saturday} = 1\ \text{hour} + 2\ \text{hours} + 2\ \text{hours} = 5\ \text{hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{5\ \text{hours}}
\]
