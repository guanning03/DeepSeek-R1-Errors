Question:
Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks from his store supplying fertiliser to different farmers in his hometown dispatched for delivery on a particular day. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser packed in bags. Two hours after the trucks had departed for delivery, Mr Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures on the road and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day?

Correct Answer:
If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.
Out of the 20 trucks dispatched to deliver fertiliser, 20-5 = <<20-5=15>>15 trucks delivered to the farmers.
Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of tons of fertiliser delivered that day was 15*20 = <<15*20=300>>300 tons.

Wrong Answer:
To determine the total amount of fertiliser delivered to the farmers, I'll start by calculating the initial amount delivered. Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total initial amount is 20 trucks multiplied by 20 tons per truck, which equals 400 tons.

Next, I need to account for the trucks that failed due to mechanical issues. Two hours after departure, a quarter of the 20 trucks had failed. A quarter of 20 is 5 trucks. These 5 trucks did not deliver their fertiliser, so they contributed 0 tons to the total.

Finally, the remaining 15 trucks successfully delivered their 20 tons each. Multiplying the number of successful trucks by the amount each carried gives 15 trucks Ã— 20 tons per truck = 300 tons.

Adding the successful delivery amounts to the initial delivery, the total amount of fertiliser delivered to the farmers that day is 400 tons + 300 tons = 700 tons.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total amount of fertiliser delivered to the farmers.

**Given:**
- **Total number of trucks:** 20
- **Fertiliser per truck:** 20 tons
- **Trucks that failed due to mechanical issues:** Two hours after departure, **1/4** of the trucks had mechanical failures.

**Step 1: Calculate the Total Initial Fertiliser Delivered**

\[
\text{Total Fertiliser} = \text{Number of Trucks} \times \text{Fertiliser per Truck}
\]

\[
\text{Total Fertiliser} = 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Failed Trucks**

\[
\text{Failed Trucks} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \text{ trucks} = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the Fertiliser Delivered by Failed Trucks**

Since these failed trucks did not deliver any fertiliser:

\[
\text{Fertiliser from Failed Trucks} = 5 \text{ trucks} \times 0 \text{ tons/truck} = 0 \text{ tons}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the Number of Successful Trucks**

\[
\text{Successful Trucks} = \text{Total Trucks} - \text{Failed Trucks} = 20 \text{ trucks} - 5 \text{ trucks} = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the Fertiliser Delivered by Successful Trucks**

\[
\text{Fertiliser from Successful Trucks} = 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

**Step 6: Calculate the Total Fertiliser Delivered**

\[
\text{Total Fertiliser Delivered} = \text{Initial Fertiliser} + \text{Fertiliser from Successful Trucks} = 400 \text{ tons} + 300 \text{ tons} = 700 \text{ tons}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{700}
\]
