Question:
James gets 10 new CDs.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40. How much money was he out?

Correct Answer:
He got a 15*.4=$<<15*.4=6>>6 discount on each CD
That means each CD cost 15-6=$<<15-6=9>>9
So he paid 10*9=$<<10*9=90>>90
That means he was out 90-40=$<<90-40=50>>50

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total cost James initially incurred by purchasing the CDs.

Each CD costs $15, and he bought 10 CDs. So, the total cost before any discounts is calculated by multiplying the number of CDs by the cost per CD:
10 CDs × $15 per CD = $150.

Next, I'll apply the 40% discount to the total cost of the CDs:
$150 × 40% = $60.

Subtracting the discount from the original total cost gives the discounted total:
$150 - $60 = $90.

James doesn't like 5 of the CDs, so he decides to sell the remaining 5. I'll calculate the total revenue from selling these 5 CDs:
5 CDs × $40 per CD = $200.

Finally, to find out how much money James was out, I'll subtract the total revenue from the amount he received from selling the CDs:
$200 - $90 = $110.

Therefore, James is out a total of $110.

**Solution:**

James buys 10 CDs, each costing \$15, and gets them for 40% off. He then decides to sell 5 of them and recovers some of his initial investment.

1. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15/\text{CD} = \$150
   \]

2. **Apply the 40% discount:**
   
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \$150 \times 40\% = \$150 \times 0.40 = \$60
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Discounted Total Cost} = \$150 - \$60 = \$90
   \]

3. **Determine the number of CDs he sells:**
   
   James doesn't like 5 CDs, so he sells:
   
   \[
   10 \text{ CDs} - 5 \text{ CDs} = 5 \text{ CDs}
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from selling 5 CDs:**
   
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40/\text{CD} = \$200
   \]

5. **Find out how much money James was out:**
   
   Subtract the total cost from the revenue:
   
   \[
   \text{Money Out} = \$200 - \$90 = \boxed{110}
   \]

**Final Answer:** \boxed{110}
