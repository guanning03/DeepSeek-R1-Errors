Question:
At the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.  The teacher agreed.  Kate took the crayons home and decided to make crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together in a muffin tin that she placed in an oven for a few minutes. If she can sell her muffin crayons for $1.50 each, how much money can Kate make?

Correct Answer:
She was able to get 3 boxes of 64 crayons so she has 3*64 = <<3*64=192>>192 crayons
Each crayon muffin needs 8 crayons and she has 192 crayons so she can make 192/8 = <<192/8=24>>24 crayon muffins
If she makes 24 crayon muffins and sells them for $1.50 apiece, she can make 24*1.5 = $<<24*1.5=36.00>>36.00

Wrong Prediction:
288

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many small pieces of crayons Kate has. Since each box contains 64 crayons and she has 3 boxes, the total number of small pieces is 3 multiplied by 64, which equals 192.

Next, I'll calculate the total amount of money Kate can earn by selling all the muffin crayons. Each muffin is sold for $1.50, and she made 192 muffins. Multiplying 192 by $1.50 gives a total of $288.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the Number of Small Pieces of Crayons:**
   
   - Each box contains **64 small pieces** of crayons.
   - Kate has **3 boxes**.
   - Total small pieces = \( 3 \times 64 = 192 \) pieces.

2. **Calculate the Total Earnings from Selling Muffin Crayons:**
   
   - Each muffin is sold for **\$1.50**.
   - Total earnings = \( 192 \times 1.50 = 288 \) dollars.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{288}
