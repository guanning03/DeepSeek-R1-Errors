Question:
Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck. How many more years does Lauren need to work if she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, live with 40% of her current annual salary, and her current salary is $100,000?

Correct Answer:
Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000
If she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire
If her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year
To reach her desired savings goal ($800,000) she will need to work for another $800,000/$20,000 = <<800000/20000=40>>40 years

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine how much Lauren currently saves each year. She saves 20% of her salary, which is $100,000. So, 20% of $100,000 is $20,000.

Next, I'll calculate how much she needs to save each year to cover 40% of her current salary. 40% of $100,000 is $40,000.

To find out how much more she needs to save each year, I'll subtract her current savings from the required amount: $40,000 - $20,000 = $20,000.

Now, I'll figure out how many years it will take her to save the additional $20,000 if she needs to save $20,000 each year. Dividing the total amount needed by her annual savings gives: $20,000 รท $20,000 = 1 year.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 1 more year to save enough for her retirement period.

To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for her retirement, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Annual Savings:**
   
   Lauren saves 20% of her salary each year. Her current salary is \$100,000.
   
   \[
   \text{Annual Savings} = 20\% \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

2. **Determine the Amount Needed for Retirement:**
   
   Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary.
   
   \[
   \text{Retirement Savings Needed} = 40\% \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]

3. **Find the Additional Amount Lauren Needs to Save:**
   
   Subtract her current annual savings from the total retirement savings needed.
   
   \[
   \text{Additional Savings Needed} = \$40,000 - \$20,000 = \$20,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the Number of Years Needed to Save the Additional Amount:**
   
   \[
   \text{Years Needed} = \frac{\text{Additional Savings Needed}}{\text{Annual Savings}} = \frac{\$20,000}{\$20,000} = 1 \text{ year}
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for \(\boxed{1}\) more year to save enough for her retirement period.
