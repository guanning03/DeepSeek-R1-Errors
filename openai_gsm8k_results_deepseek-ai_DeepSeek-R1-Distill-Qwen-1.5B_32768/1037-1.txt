Question:
The highest temperature ever recorded in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest temperature ever recorded in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest temperature recorded in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit. What is the average highest temperature of these 3 countries?

Correct Answer:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = <<-48+21+(-3)=-30>>-30
-30/3 = <<-30/3=-10>>-10 degrees
The average highest temperature recorded in Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.
#### -10

Gold:
-10

Wrong Prediction:
-6.67F

Wrong Answer:
To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, I need to add up their highest recorded temperatures and then divide by the number of countries.

First, I'll add the highest temperatures:
-48°F (Southlandia)
+21°F (Northlandia)
-3°F (Midlandia)

Adding them together: -48 + 21 = -27, and then -27 + (-3) = -30.

Next, I'll divide the total by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30°F ÷ 3 = -10°F.

So, the average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F.

To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, follow these steps:

1. **List the highest temperatures:**
   - **Southlandia:** \(-48^\circ F\)
   - **Northlandia:** \(21^\circ F\)
   - **Midlandia:** \(-3^\circ F\)

2. **Add the temperatures together:**
   \[
   -48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -20
   \]

3. **Divide the total by the number of countries (3):**
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{-20}{3} \approx -6.666\ldots
   \]

4. **Round the result to two decimal places:**
   \[
   \text{Average} \approx -6.67^\circ F
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{-6.67^\circ F}
\]
