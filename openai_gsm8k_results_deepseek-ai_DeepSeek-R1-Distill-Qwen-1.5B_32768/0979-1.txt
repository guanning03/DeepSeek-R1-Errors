Question:
Tim decides to cancel his cable subscription and get streaming services.  He gets Netflix for $10 a month.  Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 a month each but he saves 20% for bundling.  How much money does he save by cancelling his $60 cable package?

Correct Answer:
Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20
By bundling he saves 20*.2=$<<20*.2=4>>4
So in total it cost 20-4=$<<20-4=16>>16
So he pays 16+10=$<<16+10=26>>26 for streaming
That means he saves 60-26=$<<60-26=34>>34 a month
#### 34

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total cost of Tim's cable subscription before he canceled it. According to the question, the cable package costs $60 per month.

Next, I'll calculate the savings from cancelling the subscription. Since Tim is saving 20% on the costs of Hulu and Disney Plus, I'll compute 20% of $10 for Hulu and another 20% for Disney Plus, which adds up to 40% of $10. 

Adding these savings together, I get $4.00. 

Finally, I'll subtract the total savings from the original cable package price to find out how much Tim saves by canceling: $60 - $4 = $56.00.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription.

**Given:**
- **Original Cable Subscription Cost:** \$60 per month
- **Cost of Hulu:** \$10 per month
- **Cost of Disney Plus:** \$10 per month
- **Savings from Bundling:** 20% per month

**Step 1: Calculate the Total Savings from Hulu and Disney Plus**

1. **Savings from Hulu:**
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } \$10 = 0.20 \times 10 = \$2.00
   \]
   
2. **Savings from Disney Plus:**
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } \$10 = 0.20 \times 10 = \$2.00
   \]
   
3. **Total Savings:**
   \[
   \$2.00 + \$2.00 = \$4.00
   \]

**Step 2: Determine the Amount Saved by Canceling the Subscription**

Since Tim is cancelling his cable subscription, he effectively avoids paying the full \$60. The savings come directly from the bundled subscription services.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
