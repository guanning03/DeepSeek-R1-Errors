Question:
Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy after Halloween. If they decide to pool and share their candy equally with each other, how much candy would each of them have?

Correct Answer:
Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy which equals 3 + 5 + 4 = <<3+5+4=12>>12 pounds of candy
Since there are three of them (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron), they divide the candy into 3 equal portions. 12/3 = <<12/3=4>>4 pounds of candy
#### 4

Gold:
4

Wrong Prediction:
4\

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the total amount of candy that Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have together. Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. Adding these amounts gives a total of 12 pounds of candy.

Next, I need to determine how this total will be shared equally among the three of them. To find out how much each person gets, I'll divide the total candy by the number of people, which is 3.

Finally, performing the division, 12 pounds divided by 3 people equals 4 pounds per person.

To determine how much candy each person would have after pooling and sharing equally, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Amount of Candy:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Candy} = \text{Robert's Candy} + \text{Cindy's Candy} + \text{Aaron's Candy}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total Candy} = 3\ \text{pounds} + 5\ \text{pounds} + 4\ \text{pounds} = 12\ \text{pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine How Much Each Person Gets:**
   
   Since the candy is to be shared equally among the three people, divide the total amount by 3.
   
   \[
   \text{Candy per Person} = \frac{\text{Total Candy}}{\text{Number of People}} = \frac{12\ \text{pounds}}{3} = 4\ \text{pounds}
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{4\ \text{pounds}}
   \]

Each of them would have **4 pounds** of candy.
