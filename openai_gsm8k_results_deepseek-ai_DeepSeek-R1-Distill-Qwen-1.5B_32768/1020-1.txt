Question:
For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. Today is December 31st. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?

Correct Answer:
January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July. So there are 3 * 31 days + 28 + 2 * 30 days + 19 days = 93 days + 28 + 60 days + 19 days = <<3*31+28+2*30+19=200>>200 days until Andy's birthday.
He wants to lose 30 lbs. At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,
To reach his goal, he will have to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = <<105000/200=525>>525 calories per day more than he consumes.
#### 525

Wrong Answer:
To determine how many calories Andy needs to burn each day to lose 30 pounds by his birthday, we start by calculating the total calorie deficit required. Since he needs to lose 30 pounds and burns 3500 calories to lose one pound, we multiply 3500 by 30.

Next, we need to find out how many days are between December 31st and July 19th. Counting each month and the days, we find there are 183 days in total.

Finally, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days to find out the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to maintain to achieve his goal.

To determine how many calories Andy needs to burn daily to lose 30 pounds by his birthday, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Calorie Deficit Needed:**
   
   Andy needs to lose **30 pounds**. Since **3500 calories** are burned to lose **1 pound**, the total calorie deficit required is:
   
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105,000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the Number of Days:**
   
   Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. Counting the days from December 31st to July 19th, inclusive, gives:
   
   \[
   183 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Daily Calorie Deficit:**
   
   To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn **each day**, divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
   
   \[
   \frac{105,000 \text{ calories}}{183 \text{ days}} \approx 575.26 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

4. **Round to a Nearest Whole Number:**
   
   Since Andy can't burn a fraction of a calorie, we round up to the nearest whole number:
   
   \[
   \boxed{576} \text{ calories/day}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

Andy needs to maintain a **576-calorie deficit** each day to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday.
