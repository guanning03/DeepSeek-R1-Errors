Question:
Bobby takes a 30 min lunch and 2 15 minutes break per day at the office.  After 5 days, how many hours do his lunches and breaks add up to?

Correct Answer:
He has 2 15 minutes breaks per day so together they add up to 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 minutes
He also has a 30-minute lunch every day so together with his 30-minute break he has a 30+30 = 60-minute break each day
Every day his breaks total 60 minutes and he takes these breaks 5 days per week so he takes 60*5 = <<60*5=300>>300 minutes of break time
60 minutes is in an hour so 300/60 = <<300/60=5>>5 hours of break time

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch each day. Since he takes a 30-minute lunch, that's 0.5 hours.

Next, I'll determine his break time per day. With a 2-minute break, that's 2/60 hours, which is approximately 0.0333 hours.

Adding the lunch and break times together gives the total daily time spent on activities. So, 0.5 hours plus 0.0333 hours equals approximately 0.5333 hours per day.

To find the total time over 5 days, I'll multiply the daily total by 5. That results in approximately 2.6665 hours.

Finally, converting the decimal hours to hours and minutes by multiplying the decimal part by 60 gives 40 minutes. Therefore, the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks over 5 days is 2 hours and 40 minutes.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many hours Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days.

**Given:**
- **Lunch time per day:** 30 minutes
- **Break time per day:** 2 minutes
- **Number of days:** 5

**Step 1: Calculate the total time spent on lunch per day.**
\[
\text{Lunch time} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on breaks per day.**
\[
\text{Break time} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total daily activity time (lunch + breaks).**
\[
\text{Total daily time} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 32 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 4: Convert the total daily time from minutes to hours.**
\[
32 \text{ minutes} = \frac{32}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{8}{15} \text{ hours} \approx 0.5333 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the total time over 5 days.**
\[
\text{Total time over 5 days} = 5 \times \frac{8}{15} \text{ hours} = \frac{40}{15} \text{ hours} = \frac{8}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 2.6667 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 6: Convert the decimal hours to hours and minutes.**
\[
0.6667 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \approx 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2 \text{ hours and } 40 \text{ minutes}}
\]
