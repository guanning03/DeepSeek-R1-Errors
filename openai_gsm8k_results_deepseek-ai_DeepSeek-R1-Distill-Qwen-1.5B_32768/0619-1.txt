Question:
A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?

Correct Answer:
The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.

Wrong Answer:
First, I recognize that the teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk on Monday. He used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day and ended up with 20% left, which is 1 inch. However, since he needs more support, he used the remaining 15% of the chalk, which is 0.75 inches. 

This means he had to recycle the rest of the chalk, which was 10% of the original piece, equalling 0.5 inches. 

Starting from Monday, each subsequent day he uses 20% of the chalk. I need to calculate how many days it will take until the cumulative amount of chalk used exceeds 10% of the original piece, which is 0.5 inches.

After solving the equation, I find that it will take 5 days before he needs to recycle the original piece of chalk.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many days the teacher can use 20% of the chalk before needing to recycle the original piece.

### **Understanding the Problem:**
1. **Initial Chalk Piece:** 5 inches.
2. **Daily Usage:** 20% of the chalk.
3. **Recycling:** Uses smaller pieces (less than 2 inches) and recycles them.
4. **First Day (Monday):** 
   - The teacher started with a new piece.
   - He used **45%** of the chalk by the end of the day, ending up with **1 inch** of chalk.
   - However, since the students needed extra help, he used the remaining **15%** of the chalk, which is **0.75 inches**.
   - Therefore, he had to recycle **10%** of the original chalk, which is **0.5 inches**.

### **Calculating Remaining Chalk:**
- **Total Chalk Used:** 45% + 15% = 60% of the original chalk.
- **Remaining Chalk:** 40% of the original chalk.
- **Recycled Chalk:** 10% of the original chalk.

### **Showing Chalk Usage Over Days:**
Let's denote:
- **C:** Total chalk (5 inches).
- **R:** Recycled portion (2 inches).
- **D:** Number of days to recycle the original piece.

Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the chalk, which includes some original chalk and some recycled chalk.

### **Formulating the Equation:**
We need to find the number of days \( D \) such that the cumulative chalk used exceeds the amount that would require recycling the original piece (10% of 5 inches = 0.5 inches).

The total chalk used after \( D \) days is:

\[
\text{Total Chalk Used} = 0.20 \times C \times D
\]

We want this total to be greater than the amount that exceeds the recycling threshold:

\[
0.20 \times C \times D > 0.5 \text{ inches}
\]

Substituting \( C = 5 \) inches:

\[
0.20 \times 5 \times D > 0.5
\]

\[
1.0 \times D > 0.5
\]

\[
D > 0.5
\]

Since \( D \) must be a whole number of days, we round up to the next whole number:

\[
D = 1
\]

### **Conclusion:**
The teacher will need to recycle the original piece of chalk after **1 day**.

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
