Question:
Bubbles collects stuffed animals. She has three stuffed puppies, five stuffed koalas, two stuffed zebras and four stuffed frogs. If she wants to buy enough stuffed goats, such that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all of her stuffed animals, how many stuffed goats should she buy?

Correct Answer:
Let x = the number of stuffed goats.
The current number of stuffed animals are (puppies + koalas + zebras + frogs) or 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = <<3+5+2+4=14>>14 stuffed animals total.
Take the total stuffed animals, add x and divide by the number of stuffed goats to get to 30% or x / (14 + x) = .3
Cross multiply to get x = 0.42 + .3x
Subtract .3 x from each side, .7x = 0.42
Bubbles needs x = <<6=6>>6 goats added.

Wrong Prediction:
5

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. I'll add up the stuffed puppies, koalas, zebras, and frogs: 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 equals 14 stuffed animals.

Next, I want to determine how many stuffed goats she needs to have that make up 30% of the total stuffed animals. To find this, I'll calculate 30% of 14, which is 4.2.

Since she can't buy a fraction of a stuffed goat, I'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 5.

Therefore, Bubbles needs to buy 5 stuffed goats to make up 30% of her total stuffed animals.

**Solution:**

Bubbles currently has a total of **14** stuffed animals (3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs).

She wants to have **30%** of her stuffed animals as stuffed goats. To find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate 30% of the total stuffed animals:**
   
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 14 = 0.30 \times 14 = 4.2
   \]
   
2. **Determine the whole number of stuffed goats:**
   
   Since she can't buy a fraction of a stuffed goat, round up to the nearest whole number.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of stuffed goats} = \lceil 4.2 \rceil = 5
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
