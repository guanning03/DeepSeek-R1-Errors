Question:
James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?

Correct Answer:
He sprints 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 times
So he runs 9*60=<<9*60=540>>540 meters
#### 540

Wrong Answer:
First, identify the number of sprints James runs each week, which is 3.

Next, determine the distance of each sprint, which is 60 meters.

Then, multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint to find the total distance James runs in a week.

So, 3 sprints multiplied by 60 meters per sprint equals 180 meters.
</think>

**Solution:**

James runs **3 sprints** each week, and each sprint is **60 meters** long.

To find the total distance he runs in a week, multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint:

\[
\text{Total meters} = \text{Number of sprints} \times \text{Distance per sprint}
\]

\[
\text{Total meters} = 3 \times 60\ \text{meters} = 180\ \text{meters}
\]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{180}\) meters
