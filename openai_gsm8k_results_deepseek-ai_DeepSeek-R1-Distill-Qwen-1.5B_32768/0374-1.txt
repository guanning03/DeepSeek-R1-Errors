Question:
Paul is driving a car twice a day: in the morning, and in the afternoon. He did that for 14 days. Each morning ride cost him about $6, and each afternoon ride, about $2. How much money did he spend on driving his car during these two weeks?

Correct Answer:
Paul's morning rides cost him 14 * 6 = $<<14*6=84>>84.
Driving in the afternoon, on the other hand, was a cost of 14 * 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28.
So in total Paul spend on driving 84 + 28 = $<<84+28=112>>112.

Wrong Prediction:
224

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the total number of days Paul drove his car, which is 14 days.

Next, calculate the number of mornings and afternoons he drove. Since he drove twice a day, the total number of rides is 2 rides/day multiplied by 14 days, resulting in 28 rides in total.

Then, calculate the cost for the morning rides. Each morning ride costs $6, so the total cost for mornings is 28 rides multiplied by $6, which equals $168.

After that, calculate the cost for the afternoon rides. Each afternoon ride costs $2, so the total cost for afternoons is 28 rides multiplied by $2, resulting in $56.

Finally, add the cost of mornings and afternoons to find the total amount Paul spent on driving his car: $168 + $56 equals $224.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of Days:**
   - Paul drove his car twice a day for 14 days.
   - Total rides = \(2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ rides}\).

2. **Mornings:**
   - Each morning ride costs \$6.
   - Total cost for mornings = \(28 \text{ rides} \times \$6/\text{ride} = \$168\).

3. **Afternoons:**
   - Each afternoon ride costs \$2.
   - Total cost for afternoons = \(28 \text{ rides} \times \$2/\text{ride} = \$56\).

4. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - Add the costs of mornings and afternoons.
   - Total cost = \(\$168 + \$56 = \$224\).

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{224}
