Question:
Digimon had its 20th anniversary.  When it came out John was twice as old as Jim.  If John is 28 now how old is Jim?

Correct Answer:
When Digimon came out John would have been 28-20=<<28-20=8>>8
So Jim was 8/2=<<8/2=4>>4 years old
That means John is now 4+20=<<4+20=24>>24
#### 24

Gold:
24

Wrong Prediction:
14

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine John's age at the 20th anniversary. According to the problem, John is 28 years old.

Next, I know that John was twice as old as Jim when the Digimon came out. Let’s denote Jim's age at that time as J. 

So, John’s age at the anniversary is twice Jim’s age, which can be written as:

28 = 2J

To find Jim’s age, I divide both sides of the equation by 2:

J = 28 / 2

J = 14

Therefore, Jim was 14 years old when the Digimon released.
</think>

Let's determine Jim's age step by step.

**Given:**
- **John's current age:** 28 years
- **John was twice as old as Jim when the Digimon came out.**

**Let’s denote:**
- **Jim's age when Digimon came out:** \( J \)

**Setting up the equation:**
Since John was twice as old as Jim when the Digimon came out:
\[
28 = 2J
\]

**Solving for \( J \):**
\[
J = \frac{28}{2} = 14
\]

**Conclusion:**
When the Digimon came out, Jim was **\boxed{14}** years old.
