Question:
A family of parents and a child go to the cinema. The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $8. Then they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each. How many dollars do they pay in total?

Correct Answer:
Adult tickets cost 12*2=$<<12*2=24>>24
Popcorns cost 2*3=$<<2*3=6>>6
They pay 24+8+6=$<<24+8+6=38>>38 in total.
#### 38

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total cost for the adult tickets. Since there is 1 adult ticket and it costs $12, the total for adults is $12.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost for the child tickets. There are 2 children, and each child ticket is $8. So, 2 multiplied by $8 equals $16.

Now, I'll add the cost of the adults and the children together to find the total cost of the tickets. $12 plus $16 equals $28.

Additionally, they purchase 2 popcorns, each costing $3. Multiplying the number of popcorns by their price gives 2 times $3, which is $6.

Finally, I'll add the cost of the popcorns to the total cost of the tickets to find the final amount they pay. $28 plus $6 equals $34.

To determine the total amount the family pays for the cinema tickets and popcorn, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Adult Tickets:**
   - **Number of Adult Tickets:** 1
   - **Cost per Adult Ticket:** \$12
   - **Total Cost for Adults:** 
     \[
     1 \times \$12 = \$12
     \]

2. **Child Tickets:**
   - **Number of Child Tickets:** 2
   - **Cost per Child Ticket:** \$8
   - **Total Cost for Children:** 
     \[
     2 \times \$8 = \$16
     \]

3. ** Popcorns:**
   - **Number of Popcorns:** 2
   - **Cost per Popcorn:** \$3
   - **Total Cost for Popcorns:** 
     \[
     2 \times \$3 = \$6
     \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   - **Sum of Adult Tickets, Child Tickets, and Popcorns:**
     \[
     \$12 + \$16 + \$6 = \$34
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
