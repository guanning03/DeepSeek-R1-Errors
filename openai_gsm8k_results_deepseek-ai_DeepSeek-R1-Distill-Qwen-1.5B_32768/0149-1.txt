Tokens: 727.0

Question:
Britany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week. She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs to sing on TikTok, and 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup before filming herself for TikTok. How much time does Britany spend on TikTok in a month with four weeks?

Correct Answer:
First find how long Britany spends recording the videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes
Then find how long she spends writing songs in minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes
Then find how long Britany spending doing her makeup in a week: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week
Then add the time she spends on videos and song-writing to find the total time she spends on TikTok in a week: 72 minutes/week + 90 minutes/week + 120 minutes/week = <<72+90+120=282>>282 minutes/week
Then multiply the time spent per week by the number of weeks per month to find the total time spent per month: 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes/month
#### 1128

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month. Since a month typically has 4 weeks, I'll calculate her daily TikTok video time for each of the 4 weeks.

Britanya records 18 videos each week, with each video lasting 4 minutes. Multiplying 18 by 4 gives the total minutes spent on TikTok each week.

Next, I'll calculate her time spent writing songs. She spends 2 hours a week on this activity, which I'll convert to minutes since the other times are in minutes.

She also spends 15 minutes doing her makeup before filming each day. Since this happens 6 days a week, I'll multiply 15 by 6 to find the total minutes spent on makeup each week.

Adding up all these minutes (TikTok videos, songwriting, and makeup) will give the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month.

Finally, I'll convert the total minutes into hours to provide a clear and understandable answer.

To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, let's break down her activities step by step.

### 1. **TikTok Video Time**
   - **Number of videos per week:** 18
   - **Duration per video:** 4 minutes
   - **Total minutes per week on TikTok:**  
     \[
     18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - **Total minutes per month (4 weeks):**  
     \[
     72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}
     \]

### 2. **Songwriting Time**
   - **Duration:** 2 hours/week
   - **Convert hours to minutes:**  
     \[
     2 \text{ hours/week} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

### 3. **Makeup Time**
   - **Frequency:** 6 days/week
   - **Duration per day:** 15 minutes
   - **Total minutes per week on makeup:**  
     \[
     15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

### 4. **Total Time on TikTok in a Month**
   - **Sum of all activities per week:**  
     \[
     288 \text{ minutes (TikTok)} + 120 \text{ minutes (Songwriting)} + 90 \text{ minutes (Makeup)} = 498 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - **Total time over 4 weeks:**  
     \[
     498 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1992 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - **Convert total minutes to hours:**  
     \[
     \frac{1992 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 33.2 \text{ hours}
     \]

### **Final Answer**
Britany spends a total of \(\boxed{33.2}\) hours on TikTok in a month.
