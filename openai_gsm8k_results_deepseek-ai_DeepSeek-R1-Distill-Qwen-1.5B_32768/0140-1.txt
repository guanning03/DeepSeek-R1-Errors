Question:
Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. One monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?

Correct Answer:
Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.
The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.
So the first and the second monkey eat a total of 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.
Hence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.
#### 21

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the total number of bananas needed for a week by multiplying the number of monkeys by the number of bananas each monkey eats per day. 

There are 3 monkeys in total. The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day, the second monkey eats 4 more than the first, so that's 14 bananas per day. The third monkey eats the remaining bananas. 

Adding the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys gives a total of 24 bananas per day. 

Since the bananas are enough for a week, multiply the daily consumption by 7 to find the total number of bananas: 24 bananas/day * 7 days = 168 bananas.

Finally, subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas to find out how many the third monkey eats each day: 168 bananas - 24 bananas = 144 bananas.

To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, let's break down the problem step by step.

**1. Calculate the total number of bananas needed for a week:**

- **Monkeys:**
  - **Monkey 1:** 10 bananas/day
  - **Monkey 2:** 10 + 4 = 14 bananas/day
  - **Monkey 3:** ?

- **Total bananas needed per day:** 
  \[
  10 \, \text{bananas} + 14 \, \text{bananas} = 24 \, \text{bananas}
  \]

**2. Determine the total number of bananas for a week:**
\[
24 \, \text{bananas/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 168 \, \text{bananas}
\]

**3. Calculate the number of bananas eaten by Monkey 3 each day:**
\[
168 \, \text{bananas} - 24 \, \text{bananas} = 144 \, \text{bananas}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{144}
\]
