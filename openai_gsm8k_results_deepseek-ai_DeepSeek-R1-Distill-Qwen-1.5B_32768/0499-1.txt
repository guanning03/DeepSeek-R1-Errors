Question:
Patty's Plumbing charges $40 to visit a house to make a repair, plus $35 per hour, or part thereof, for labor, plus parts. One job took 2.25 hours and used $60 in parts. How much did Patty charge?

Correct Answer:
She charged for 3 hours.
The total cost from the hourly rate was 3*35=$<<3*35=105>>105.
She charged 40+105+60=<<40+105+60=205>>205.

Wrong Answer:
I need to calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing service.

First, I'll start with the fixed cost of $40 for the visit.

Next, I'll determine the labor cost. The labor rate is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Converting 2.25 hours to a fraction, I recognize that 0.25 hours is 15 minutes. So, the total labor time is 3 and 1/4 hours.

Multiplying the hourly labor rate by the total hours gives me 3.25 hours times $35 per hour, which equals $113.75.

Then, I'll add the parts cost of $60 to the labor and visit costs.

Finally, I'll sum up all these amounts to find the total charge for the job.

**Solution:**

Patty's Plumbing charges a total of:

1. **Fixed Visit Charge:** \$40
2. **Labor Charge:** \$35 per hour
3. **Parts Cost:** \$60

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Convert the hours to a decimal for easier multiplication:**
   \[
   2.25 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} + 0.25 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} + \frac{1}{4} \text{ hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total labor cost:**
   \[
   \text{Labor Charge} = \$35 \times 2.25 = \$35 \times 2 + \$35 \times 0.25 = \$70 + \$8.75 = \$78.75
   \]

3. **Add the fixed visit charge and labor charge:**
   \[
   \text{Total Charge} = \$40 + \$78.75 = \$118.75
   \]

4. **Include the parts cost:**
   \[
   \text{Final Total Charge} = \$118.75 + \$60 = \$178.75
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$178.75}
\]
