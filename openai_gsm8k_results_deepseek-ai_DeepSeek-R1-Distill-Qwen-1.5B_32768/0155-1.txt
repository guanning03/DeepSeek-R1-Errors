Question:
Frances sells 20 cupcakes for $2 for each cupcake and  40  cookies at $1 each.  She buys five trays at $4 for each tray. How much money does Frances have left?

Correct Answer:
20 cupcakes cost 20 x $2 =$<<20*2=40>>40.
40 cookies cost 40 x $1 = $<<40*1=40>>40.
So, Frances earns $40 + $40 = $<<40+40=80>>80 for selling cupcakes and cookies.
The cost of five trays is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
Therefore, France will have $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 left.

20

Wrong Answer:
I need to calculate the total amount Frances spent on buying the cupcakes and cookies.

First, I'll determine the cost of the cupcakes. She buys 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so 20 multiplied by $2 equals $40.

Next, I'll calculate the cost of the cookies. She buys 40 cookies at $1 each, which means 40 multiplied by $1 equals $40.

Adding these two amounts together, $40 for cupcakes plus $40 for cookies gives a total expenditure of $80.

Finally, I'll subtract the total expenditure from the amount of money she started with. If she initially had $100, subtracting $80 leaves her with $20.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of cupcakes:**
   - Frances sells 20 cupcakes.
   - Each cupcake costs \$2.
   - **Total cost for cupcakes:** \( 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40 \)

2. **Calculate the cost of cookies:**
   - Frances sells 40 cookies.
   - Each cookie costs \$1.
   - **Total cost for cookies:** \( 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \)

3. **Calculate the total expenditure:**
   - **Total cost:** \$40 (cupcakes) + \$40 (cookies) = \$80

4. **Determine the money left:**
   - Assume Frances initially had \$100.
   - **Money left:** \$100 - \$80 = \$20

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{20}
\]
