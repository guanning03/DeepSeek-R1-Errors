Question:
Judy teaches 5 dance classes, every day, on the weekdays and 8 classes on Saturday.  If each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, how much money does she make in 1 week?

Correct Answer:
She teaches 5 dance classes 5 days a week so that's 5*5 = <<5*5=25>>25 classes
She teaches 25 classes during the week and 8 classes on Saturday for a total of 25+8 = <<25+8=33>>33 classes
There are 15 students in each of the 33 classes so there are 15*33 = <<15*33=495>>495 students
Each student pays $15.00 per class and there are 495 students so Judy makes 15*495 = $<<15*495=7425>>7,425
#### 7425

Gold:
7425

Wrong Prediction:
2925

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the number of dance classes Judy teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes on each weekday and 8 classes on Saturday, totaling 13 classes per week.

Next, calculate the total number of students she has in a week. Each class has 15 students, so multiplying 13 classes by 15 students per class gives 195 students.

Finally, find out how much money Judy makes by charging $15.00 per student. Multiplying the total number of students, 195, by the price per student, $15.00, results in $2,925.00.

To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Dance Classes in a Week:**
   - **Weekdays:** Judy teaches 5 dance classes each day.
   - **Saturday:** She teaches 8 dance classes.

   \[
   \text{Total Classes per Week} = 5 \text{ (weekdays)} + 8 \text{ (Saturday)} = 13 \text{ classes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Students:**
   - Each dance class has 15 students.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Students per Week} = 13 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 195 \text{ students}
   \]

3. **Determine the Total Earnings:**
   - Judy charges \$15.00 per student.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = 195 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$2,\!925.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{2925}
\]
