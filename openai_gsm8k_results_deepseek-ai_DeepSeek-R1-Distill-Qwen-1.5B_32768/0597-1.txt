Question:
Andy works in the pro shop of a tennis resort. He has 12 racquets that need restringing. 3 of them are to be strung with synthetic gut, 5 of them will be strung with polyester string, and 4 of them will be strung with a hybrid set (half synthetic gut, half polyester string). How long will it take Andy to string all of those racquets if it takes him an average of 15 minutes for him to string with synthetic gut, 22 minutes to string with polyester string, and 18 minutes for hybrid sets?

Correct Answer:
Andy is stringing 3 racquets with synthetic gut, so those will take 3 synthetic gut jobs * 15 minutes per synthetic gut job = <<3*15=45>>45 minutes.
He is stringing 5 racquets with polyester string, so those will take 5 polyester string jobs * 22 minutes per polyester string job = <<5*22=110>>110 minutes.
He has 4 hybrid string jobs, so those will take 4 hybrid string jobs * 18 minutes per hybrid job = <<4*18=72>>72 minutes.
So Andy should finish stringing all the racquets in 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = <<45+110+72=227>>227 minutes.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the time it takes to string the synthetic gut racquets. There are 3 of them, each taking 15 minutes. So, 3 multiplied by 15 minutes equals 45 minutes.

Next, I'll determine the time for the polyester stringed racquets. There are 5 of them, each taking 22 minutes. Multiplying 5 by 22 minutes gives 110 minutes.

Then, for the hybrid sets, there are 4 racquets, each requiring 18 minutes. Multiplying 4 by 18 minutes results in 72 minutes.

Finally, I'll add up all the individual times to find the total time needed to string all the racquets: 45 minutes (synthetic gut) + 110 minutes (polyester) + 72 minutes (hybrid sets) equals 227 minutes.

To determine the total time Andy will take to string all the racquets, we'll calculate the time required for each type of stringing and then sum them up.

1. **Synthetic Guts:**
   - **Number of racquets:** 3
   - **Time per racquet:** 15 minutes
   - **Total time:** \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) minutes

2. **Polyester Strings:**
   - **Number of racquets:** 5
   - **Time per racquet:** 22 minutes
   - **Total time:** \( 5 \times 22 = 110 \) minutes

3. **Hybrid Sets:**
   - **Number of racquets:** 4
   - **Time per racquet:** 18 minutes
   - **Total time:** \( 4 \times 18 = 72 \) minutes

4. **Total Time:**
   - **Sum of all times:** \( 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 \) minutes

\[
\boxed{227\ \text{minutes}}
\]
