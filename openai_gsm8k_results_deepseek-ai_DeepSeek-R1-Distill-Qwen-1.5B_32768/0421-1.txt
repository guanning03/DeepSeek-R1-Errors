Question:
Jay is making snowballs to prepare for a snowball fight with his sister. He can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. How long will it take before he has 60 snowballs?

Correct Answer:
Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.
At the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.
This means that each hour, Jay ends up with 20 â€“ 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 more snowballs.
It will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.

Wrong Answer:
First, Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, which is 60 minutes.

However, every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, a total of 8 snowballs melt in an hour.

This means Jay's net gain of snowballs per hour is 20 minus 8, which is 12 snowballs.

To reach a total of 60 snowballs, Jay needs an additional 36 snowballs after the initial 20.

Dividing the required snowballs (36) by the net gain per hour (12) gives 3 hours.

Therefore, Jay will need 3 additional hours of work to reach a total of 60 snowballs.

Let's determine how long Jay needs to work to make 60 snowballs, considering his rate of building and the melting rate.

**Given:**
- **Building Rate:** Jay can build 20 snowballs per hour.
- **Melting Rate:** 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.

**Step 1: Convert Melting Rate to Per Hour**

Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, the total number of snowballs that melt in an hour is:
\[
2 \text{ snowballs/15 minutes} \times 4 = 8 \text{ snowballs/hour}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Net Gain per Hour**

Jay's net gain of snowballs per hour is the difference between his building rate and his melting rate:
\[
20 \text{ snowballs/hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs/hour}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the Time Required to Reach 60 Snowballs**

Jay already has 20 snowballs at the start. To reach a total of 60 snowballs, he needs:
\[
60 \text{ snowballs} - 20 \text{ snowballs} = 40 \text{ additional snowballs}
\]

Given his net gain of 12 snowballs per hour, the time required to gain 40 more snowballs is:
\[
\frac{40 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 3.333 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 4: Convert Hours to Hours and Minutes**

\[
\frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours and } \left(\frac{1}{3} \times 60\right) \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours and } 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Jay will need to work for \(\boxed{3 \text{ hours and } 20 \text{ minutes}}\) to have 60 snowballs.
