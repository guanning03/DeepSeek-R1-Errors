Question:
Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. If his brother eats 1/2 as many, how many does his brother eat in a week?

Correct Answer:
His brother eats 9 pretzels a day because 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9
His brother eats 63 in a week because 9 x 7 = <<9*7=63>>63
#### 63

Gold:
63

Wrong Prediction:
126

Wrong Answer:
Edgar eats 18 pretzels each day. To find out how many he eats in a week, I need to multiply the daily amount by the number of days in a week, which is 7.
</think>

**Solution:**

Edgar eats **18** pretzels each day. To find out how many he eats in a week, multiply his daily consumption by the number of days in a week.

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar in a week} = 18 \times 7 = \boxed{126}
\]

**Answer:**  
Edgar eats \(\boxed{126}\) pretzels in a week.
