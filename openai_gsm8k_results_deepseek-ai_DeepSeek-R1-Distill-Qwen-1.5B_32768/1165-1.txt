Question:
Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?

Correct Answer:
She has enough supplies to make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.
She sells all of the lemonade for 36 * $1 = $<<36*1=36>>36.
Her total profit for selling the lemonade is $36 - $18 = $<<36-18=18>>18.
It will take Millie 36 / 4 = <<36/4=9>>9 hours of work to sell all of the lemonade.
Her hourly profit is $18 / 9 hours = $<<18/9=2>>2 per hour.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how much Millie spends on supplies and the cost per pitcher. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies for 3 pitchers.

Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so 3 pitchers provide 36 cups in total.

She sells each cup for $1, earning $1 per cup. With 36 cups, she makes $36 in total.

Next, I'll calculate how many cups she sells per hour. She averages 4 cups per hour.

To find the profit per hour, I'll subtract the hourly cost from the hourly revenue. Since she sells 4 cups per hour and earns $1 per cup, her hourly revenue is $4.

Subtracting the $18 supplies cost for 3 hours, the profit per hour is $4 minus $18, which equals -$14.

This means Millie has a loss of $14 per hour she's running the lemonade stand.

To determine Millie's profit per hour, let's break down the information provided and calculate step by step.

### **1. Total Cost of Supplies**
- **Amount Spent:** \$18
- **Number of Pitchers:** 3
- **Cups per Pitcher:** 12
- **Total Cups in 3 Pitchers:** \(3 \times 12 = 36\) cups

### **2. Total Revenue from Lemonade**
- **Cups Sold per Hour:** 4 cups
- **Total Cups Sold in 1 Hour:** 4 cups
- **Revenue per Hour:** \(4 \times \$1 = \$4\)

### **3. Total Hours and Revenue**
- **Assuming Millie runs the lemonade stand for 1 hour:**
  - **Revenue in 1 Hour:** \$4
  - **Total Cost for 1 Hour:** \$18

### **4. Profit per Hour**
- **Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost**
- **Profit per Hour:** \(\$4 - \$18 = -\$14\)

### **Conclusion**
Millie has a **loss** of **\$14** per hour running her lemonade stand after accounting for all her expenses.
