Question:
Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later?

Correct Answer:
Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.
The total amount of salary the two earn four years later is $39200+$56000 = $<<39200+56000=95200>>95200

Wrong Answer:
To determine the total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, I'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, I know that Adrien's current salary is 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's represent Lylah's current salary as \( L \). Therefore, Adrien's current salary can be expressed as \( 1.30L \).

Next, I need to find out how much Adrien earned four years ago. Since his salary increased by 30%, and he was earning $40,000 four years ago, I can set up the equation:
\[
1.30L = 40000
\]
To find \( L \), I'll divide both sides by 1.30:
\[
L = \frac{40000}{1.30} \approx 30769.23
\]
So, Lylah's current salary is approximately $30,769.23.

Now, I'll calculate Lylah's salary four years ago. Since it increased by 40%, I'll multiply his current salary by 0.40:
\[
0.40L = 0.40 \times 30769.23 \approx 12307.69
\]
Therefore, Lylah earned approximately $12,307.69 four years ago.

Next, I'll determine Adrien's salary four years ago. Since his salary increased by 30%, I'll multiply his current salary by 1.30:
\[
1.30 \times 40000 = 52000
\]
So, Adrien earned $52,000 four years ago.

Finally, to find the total salary that both Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, I'll add their current salaries:
\[
52000 + 30769.23 = 82769.23
\]
Thus, the total salary they were receiving four years later is approximately $82,769.23.
</think>

To determine the total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Adrien's Current Salary:**
   
   Adrien's current salary is 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's current salary is $40,000, then:
   
   \[
   \text{Adrien's Current Salary} = 40000 = 1.30 \times Lylah's \text{ Current Salary}
   \]
   
   Solving for Lylah's current salary (\( L \)):
   
   \[
   Lylah's \text{ Current Salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \approx 30769.23
   \]

2. **Lylah's Salary Four Years Ago:**
   
   Lylah's salary increased by 40% over four years. Let \( L_4 \) be Lylah's salary four years ago:
   
   \[
   Lylah's \text{ Current Salary} = Lylah's \text{ Salary Four Years Ago} \times 1.40
   \]
   
   \[
   30769.23 = L_4 \times 1.40
   \]
   
   \[
   L_4 = \frac{30769.23}{1.40} \approx 21978.02
   \]

3. **Adrien's Salary Four Years Ago:**
   
   Adrien's salary increased by 30% over four years. Therefore, his salary four years ago was:
   
   \[
   \text{Adrien's Salary Four Years Ago} = 40000
   \]

4. **Total Salary Four Years Later:**
   
   Since both salaries increased simultaneously, the total salary four years later is the sum of their current salaries:
   
   \[
   \text{Total Salary} = \text{Adrien's Current Salary} + \text{Lylah's Current Salary}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total Salary} = 40000 + 30769.23 = 70769.23
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{70769.23}
\]
