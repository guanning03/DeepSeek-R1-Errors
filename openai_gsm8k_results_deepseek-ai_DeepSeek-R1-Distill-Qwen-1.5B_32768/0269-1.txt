Question:
John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and he sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left. How many lego sets does he still have?

Correct Answer:
He spent $160 on video games because 8 x 20 = <<8*20=160>>160
He earned $165 from his sale because 160 + 5 = <<160+5=165>>165
He sold 11 lego sets because 11 x 15 = <<11*15=165>>165
He has 2 sets left because 13 - 11 = <<13-11=2>>2

Wrong Answer:
To determine how many lego sets John has left after selling them, I'll follow these steps:

First, calculate the total money John makes from selling his lego sets. He sells each set for $15, and he has 13 sets.

Next, I'll calculate the total amount he spends on video games. Each game costs $20, and he buys 8 of them.

Then, I'll subtract the total cost of the video games and the $5 he has left from the total money he made from selling the lego sets. This will give me the amount of money he has left after all purchases.

Finally, I'll subtract this remaining amount from the original number of lego sets he had to find out how many he has left.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total money John makes from selling his lego sets:**
   
   - **Number of lego sets:** 13
   - **Selling price per set:** \$15
   
   \[
   \text{Total money from selling lego sets} = 13 \times \$15 = \$195
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount spent on video games:**
   
   - **Number of video games bought:** 8
   - **Cost per video game:** \$20
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost for video games} = 8 \times \$20 = \$160
   \]
   
   - **Money left after buying video games:** \$5
   
   \[
   \text{Total money spent} = \$160 + \$5 = \$165
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining money John has after all purchases:**
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = \$195 - \$165 = \$30
   \]

4. **Find out how many lego sets John has left:**
   
   - **Original number of lego sets:** 13
   - **Total money spent on lego sets:** \$30
   
   \[
   \text{Lego sets left} = 13 - \left( \frac{\$30}{\$15} \right) = 13 - 2 = \boxed{11}
   \]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{11}\)
