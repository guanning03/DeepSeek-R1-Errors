Question:
Jen works for 7.5 hours a day 6 days a week. Her hourly rate is $1.5. Jen also receives an additional $10 if she has complete attendance. Suppose Jen did not incur any absences for  April, and there are exactly 4 weeks in April, how much will she receive?

Correct Answer:
In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week
So in a month, she works for 45 hours/week x 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours.
180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.
Since she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.
#### 280

Wrong Answer:
To determine how much Jen will receive in April, I need to calculate her earnings based on her regular hours and any additional bonuses.

First, I'll calculate her total working hours in April. Jen works 7.5 hours each day for 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April. So, her total hours are 7.5 multiplied by 6, which equals 45 hours.

Next, I'll calculate her earnings from her hourly rate. Jen's hourly rate is $1.5 per hour. Multiplying her total hours by her hourly rate gives $67.50.

Additionally, since Jen had complete attendance throughout April, she receives a $10 bonus.

Finally, I'll add the earnings from her hourly rate and the bonus to find her total compensation. This results in a total of $77.50.

**Solution:**

Let's break down Jen's earnings step by step.

1. **Calculate Total Working Hours in April:**
   
   - **Hours per day:** 7.5 hours
   - **Days worked:** 6 days
   - **Total hours = Hours per day × Days worked = 7.5 × 6 = 45 hours**

2. **Calculate Earnings from Hourly Rate:**
   
   - **Hourly rate:** \$1.5
   - **Total earnings = Hours × Hourly rate = 45 × \$1.5 = \$67.50**

3. **Add Bonus for Complete Attendance:**
   
   - **Bonus amount:** \$10
   - **Total earnings = Hourly earnings + Bonus = \$67.50 + \$10 = \$77.50**

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$77.50}
\]
