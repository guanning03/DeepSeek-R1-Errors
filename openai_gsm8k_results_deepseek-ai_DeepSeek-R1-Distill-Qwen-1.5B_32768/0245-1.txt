Question:
Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week for his drawing. If there are 30 sheets of paper on a pad of paper, how many sheets of paper does he use every month?

Correct Answer:
Miguel uses 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 sheets of paper every week.
Therefore, he uses 60 x 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 sheets of paper every month.
#### 240

Wrong Answer:
First, I know that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week.

Since there are 7 weeks in a month, I'll multiply the weekly usage by 7 to find the monthly usage.

So, 2 pads/week multiplied by 7 weeks/month equals 14 pads/month.

Each pad contains 30 sheets of paper, so I'll multiply the total pads by the number of sheets per pad to find the total sheets used in a month.

14 pads multiplied by 30 sheets per pad equals 420 sheets.

**Solution:**

Miguel uses **2 pads** of paper every week. Each pad contains **30 sheets** of paper. To find out how many sheets he uses in a month, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate weekly usage:**
   
   \[
   \text{Weekly usage} = 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate monthly usage:**

   \[
   \text{Monthly usage} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 7 \text{ weeks/month} = 420 \text{ sheets/month}
   \]

Therefore, Miguel uses \(\boxed{420}\) sheets of paper every month.
