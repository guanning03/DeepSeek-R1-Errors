Question:
Leo collects stickers. Two years ago, he had 100 stickers in his collection. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. How many stickers does Leo have in his collection?

Correct Answer:
Last year, Leo had 100 +50 = <<100+50=150>>150.
This year, he collected 2 x 50 = <<2*50=100>>100.
Therefore, Leo had 150 + 100 = <<150+100=250>>250 stickers in his collection.

Wrong Prediction:
550

Wrong Answer:
To determine how many stickers Leo has in his collection now, I'll start with the number he had two years ago.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he added 50 stickers to his collection. So, the total number of stickers after last year was 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers he did last year. Since he collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to the previous year's total, Leo now has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers in his collection.

**Solution:**

Let's determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection step by step.

1. **Stickers Two Years Ago:**
   \[
   \text{Stickers two years ago} = 100 \text{ stickers}
   \]

2. **Stickers Last Year:**
   \[
   \text{Stickers last year} = 100 \text{ stickers} + 50 \text{ stickers} = 150 \text{ stickers}
   \]

3. **Stickers This Year:**
   \[
   \text{Stickers this year} = 2 \times \text{Stickers last year} = 2 \times 150 = 300 \text{ stickers}
   \]

4. **Total Stickers Now:**
   \[
   \text{Total stickers} = \text{Stickers two years ago} + \text{Stickers last year} + \text{Stickers this year} = 100 + 150 + 300 = 550 \text{ stickers}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{550}
\]
