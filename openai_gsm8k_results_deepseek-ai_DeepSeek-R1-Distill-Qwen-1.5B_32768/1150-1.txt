Question:
Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and half as many bananas as Jamal. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. How many fruits are there if Andrea has 52 apples?

Correct Answer:
Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.
The total number of apples is 44+52 = <<44+52=96>>96
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
There are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.
Altogether, there are 96 apples + 72 bananas = <<96+72=168>>168 fruits
#### 168

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal must have 52 minus 8, which is 44 apples.

Next, I'll find out how many bananas Jamal has. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 plus 4, which equals 48 bananas.

Finally, I'll calculate the total number of fruits by adding Andrea's apples, Jamal's apples, and Jamal's bananas: 52 plus 44 plus 48 equals 144 fruits.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Jamal's Apples:**
   
   - **Andrea's Apples:** 52
   - **Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal:**
     
     \[
     \text{Andrea's Apples} = \text{Jamal's Apples} + 8
     \]
     
     Plugging in the values:
     
     \[
     52 = \text{Jamal's Apples} + 8 \implies \text{Jamal's Apples} = 52 - 8 = 44
     \]
     
2. **Determine Jamal's Bananas:**
   
   - **Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:**
     
     \[
     \text{Jamal's Bananas} = \text{Jamal's Apples} + 4
     \]
     
     Plugging in the value:
     
     \[
     \text{Jamal's Bananas} = 44 + 4 = 48
     \]
     
3. **Calculate Total Number of Fruits:**
   
   - **Andrea's Fruits:** 52 apples
   - **Jamal's Fruits:** 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits
   
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = \text{Andrea's Fruits} + \text{Jamal's Fruits} = 52 + 92 = 144
   \]
   
**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{144}
\]
