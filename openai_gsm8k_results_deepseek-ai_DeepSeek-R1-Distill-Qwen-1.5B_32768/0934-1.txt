Question:
Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long.  He does this 3 times a week.  How many hours does he spend on TV and reading in 4 weeks?

Correct Answer:
He reads for 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 hour a night
So he spends 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 hours on these activities
That means he spends 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 hours a week on them
So in 4 weeks, he spends 9*4=<<9*4=36>>36 hours on these activities

Wrong Prediction:
84

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the total time Jim spends on TV and reading each day. He spends 2 hours watching TV and half as long reading, which is 1 hour. So, each day he spends 3 hours on these activities.

Next, I'll determine how many times he does this in a week. He does it 3 times each day, so over 7 days, he spends 3 times 7, which equals 21 hours per week.

Finally, I'll calculate the total time over 4 weeks by multiplying the weekly time by 4. That means Jim spends 21 hours multiplied by 4, totaling 84 hours on TV and reading.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

1. **Daily Time Spent:**
   - **TV Watching:** Jim spends **2 hours** watching TV each day.
   - **Reading:** He reads for **half as long** as he watches TV, which is **2 hours / 2 = 1 hour**.
   
   **Total Daily Time:** 
   \[
   2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (Reading)} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Weekly Time Spent:**
   - Jim does this **3 times a week**.
   
   **Total Weekly Time:**
   \[
   3 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

3. **Total Time Over 4 Weeks:**
   \[
   21 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{84}
\]
