Question:
The girls are trying to raise money for a carnival. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430, and Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. How much money, in dollars, did they all raise in total?

Correct Answer:
Kim raises 320+430=<<320+430=750>>750 dollars.
Maryam raises 400+300=<<400+300=700>>700 dollars.
They raise 750+430+400+700=<<750+430+400+700=2280>>2280 dollars.

Wrong Prediction:
2180

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how much each person raised. 

Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raised $300. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, I'll add up the amounts raised by all four individuals: Alexandra ($430) + Kim ($750) + Sarah ($300) + Maryam ($700) = $2180.

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by all the girls is $2180.

To determine the total amount of money raised by all the girls, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Alexandra's Raise:**
   - Let \( A \) represent the amount Alexandra raised.
   - **Given:** \( A = \$430 \).

2. **Kim's Raise:**
   - Kim raised \$320 more than Alexandra.
   - **Given:** \( K = A + \$320 = \$430 + \$320 = \$750 \).

3. **Sarah's Raise:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the amount Sarah raised.
   - **Given:** \( S = \$300 \).

4. **Maryam's Raise:**
   - Maryam raised \$400 more than Sarah.
   - **Given:** \( M = S + \$400 = \$300 + \$400 = \$700 \).

5. **Total Amount Raised:**
   - **Sum of all raises:** \( A + K + S + M = \$430 + \$750 + \$300 + \$700 \).
   - **Calculation:** 
     \[
     \$430 + \$750 = \$1180
     \]
     \[
     \$300 + \$700 = \$1000
     \]
     \[
     \$1180 + \$1000 = \$2180
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2180}
\]
