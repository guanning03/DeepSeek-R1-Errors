Question:
Ram uses a lot of pens. He discovered that he can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. If he buys 25 pens and then uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low, how many total pens does he get to have?

Correct Answer:
He can make 5 pens when the 25 run low because 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5
He can make 1 pen when the ink in the re-made pens runs low because 5 / 1 = <<5/1=5>>5
He will have 31 total pens because 25 + 5 + 1 = <<25+5+1=31>>31
#### 31

Gold:
31

Wrong Prediction:
30

Wrong Answer:
First, Ram buys 25 pens.

Each new pen requires five empty pens to mix ink.

So, with 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

These 5 new pens then have ink but no empty pens.

Therefore, he can't make any more pens from them.

In total, Ram has the original 25 pens plus the 5 new pens, making a total of 30 pens.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   - Ram buys **25 pens**.

2. **Making New Pens from Ink:**
   - **Each new pen requires 5 empty pens to mix ink.**
   - **Number of new pens Ram can make:**
     \[
     \frac{25 \text{ empty pens}}{5 \text{ pens per mix}} = 5 \text{ new pens}
     \]

3. **Total Pens After Mixing:**
   - **Original pens:** 25
   - **New pens made:** 5
   - **Total pens:** 
     \[
     25 + 5 = 30 \text{ pens}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{30}
\]
