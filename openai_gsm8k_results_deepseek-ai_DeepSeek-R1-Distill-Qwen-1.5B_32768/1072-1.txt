Question:
Vicki is planning a pop concert at her high school. The show will be 2 hours. She is allowing each group 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 minutes to exit the stage. If she allows a 10-minute intermission, how many groups can perform in the concert?

Correct Answer:
First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 â€“ 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances.
Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.
Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.
#### 11

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total time required for each group to perform, including their setup and exit time. Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes for performance, and 2 minutes to exit, totaling 10 minutes per group.

Next, I'll calculate the total time allocated for the concert, which is 2 hours or 120 minutes.

After that, I'll divide the total concert time by the time required per group to find out how many groups can perform. Dividing 120 minutes by 10 minutes per group gives 12 groups.

To determine how many groups can perform at Vicki's pop concert, let's break down the time requirements and calculate step by step.

### Given:
- **Total concert time:** 2 hours = **120 minutes**
- **Time per group:**
  - **Setup and exit:** 2 minutes
  - **Performance:** 6 minutes
  - **Total per group:** **2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes**

### Calculation:
1. **Total time required per group:** 10 minutes
2. **Number of groups:** 
   \[
   \text{Total groups} = \frac{\text{Total concert time}}{\text{Time per group}} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 12 \text{ groups}
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
