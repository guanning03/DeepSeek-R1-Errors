Question:
Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?

Correct Answer:
The 100-centimeter ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts in pieces of 100 / 4 = <<100/4=25>>25 cm
From each piece of 25 cm, he gets 5 equal parts of 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5 cm each.

Wrong Answer:
First, Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. Each of these parts will then be divided into 5 equal parts.

To find the length of each final piece, I'll start by calculating the length of each of the 4 equal parts. I'll divide 100 centimeters by 4, which gives me 25 centimeters per part.

Next, I'll take each 25 centimeter piece and divide it into 5 equal parts. To determine the length of each smaller piece, I'll divide 25 centimeters by 5, resulting in 5 centimeters per final part.

Therefore, each final piece of ribbon will be 5 centimeters long.

To determine the length of each final piece of ribbon, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Cut:**
   - **Total Length of Ribbon:** 100 centimeters
   - **Number of Equal Parts:** 4
   - **Length of Each Part:**
     \[
     \frac{100\, \text{cm}}{4} = 25\, \text{cm}
     \]

2. **Second Cut:**
   - **Length of Each Part After First Cut:** 25 centimeters
   - **Number of Equal Parts:** 5
   - **Length of Each Final Piece:**
     \[
     \frac{25\, \text{cm}}{5} = 5\, \text{cm}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{5\ \text{cm}}
\]
