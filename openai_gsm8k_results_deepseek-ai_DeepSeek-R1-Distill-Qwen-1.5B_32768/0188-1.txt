Question:
Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account.  He loses 10 bills while getting home.  After that, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.  Thomas then triples his money.  He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?

Correct Answer:
He withdrew 1000/20=<<1000/20=50>>50 bills
So he has 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 bills left over
He uses half the bills to pay for something, so he has 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 bills
He triples his money which gives him 20*3=<<20*3=60>>60 bills
So he has 60*20=$<<60*20=1200>>1200
Converting to 5s means he has 1200/5=<<1200/5=240>>240 bills
#### 240

Wrong Answer:
First, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20-dollar bills, which means he has 1000 divided by 20, resulting in 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, leaving him with 50 minus 10, which is 40 bills.

He uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill, leaving him with 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money, so he has 20 times 3, which equals 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all 60 bills into 5-dollar bills, resulting in 60 divided by 5, which is 12 bills.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many \$5 bills Thomas has in the end.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   - Thomas withdraws \$1000 in 20-dollar bills.
   - Number of 20-dollar bills = \(\frac{1000}{20} = 50\) bills.

2. **Loss of Bills:**
   - Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   - Remaining bills = \(50 - 10 = 40\) bills.

3. **Using Half the Remaining Bills:**
   - Thomas uses half of the 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   - Number of bills used = \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) bills.
   - Remaining bills = \(40 - 20 = 20\) bills.

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   - Thomas triples his money.
   - Total bills after tripling = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) bills.

5. **Converting Bills to 5-Dollar Bills:**
   - Thomas converts all 60 bills into 5-dollar bills.
   - Number of 5-dollar bills = \(\frac{60}{5} = 12\) bills.

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
