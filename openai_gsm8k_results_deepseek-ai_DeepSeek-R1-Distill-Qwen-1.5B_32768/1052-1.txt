Question:
Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?

Correct Answer:
3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

Wrong Answer:
To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she spends by winning the auction.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with a bid of $200.
2. **Bidding Increment**: Each subsequent bid increases by $50.
3. **Number of Bids After Competitors**: There are 3 other people who each bid once after Carmen.
4. **Winning the Bid**: Carmen wins after bidding 4 times (once after each competitor).

Calculating the total amount:
- 1st bid: $200
- 2nd bid: $200 + $50 = $250
- 3rd bid: $250 + $50 = $300
- 4th bid: $300 + $50 = $350

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the desk for Carmen.

To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with a bid of **\$200**.

2. **Bidding Increment**: Each subsequent bid increases by **\$50**.

3. **Number of Bids After Competitors**: There are 3 other people who each bid once. Carmen bids after each of these 3 people, which means she makes **4 bids in total**:
   - **First bid**: \$200
   - **Second bid**: \$200 + \$50 = **\$250**
   - **Third bid**: **\$250 + \$50 = **\$300**
   - **Fourth bid**: **\$300 + \$50 = **\$350**

4. **Total Cost**: Carmen wins the auction after making these 4 bids. Therefore, the total cost of the desk for her is the amount of her fourth bid.

\boxed{350}
