Question:
If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000/year. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?

Correct Answer:
First find how many years Marcy works after 20 years: 30 years - 20 years = <<30-20=10>>10 years
Then multiply that number by the amount of her pension she gets per year: 10 years * 5% = 50%
Then multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000
#### 25000

Gold:
25000

Wrong Prediction:
2,500

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate Marcy's total pension income over the 40 years she works for the company. She receives $50,000 annually for the first 20 years. To find the total, I'll multiply $50,000 by 20 years.

Next, after 20 years, her pension increases to 5% of the company's pension amount, which is $50,000. This means each year, she'll receive $2,500 (5% of $50,000). 

She works for another 20 years, so the total pension income from these years will be $2,500 multiplied by 20 years.

Finally, I'll add the two amounts together to find her total pension income over the 40 years. Then, I'll divide the total by 40 to determine her annual pension rate after quitting.

**Solution:**

1. **Total Pension Income Over 40 Years:**
   
   - **First 20 Years:**
     \[
     \text{Annual Pension} = \$50,\!000
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Pension} = 20 \times \$50,\!000 = \$1,\!000,\!000
     \]
   
   - **Next 20 Years:**
     \[
     \text{Annual Pension} = 5\% \times \$50,\!000 = \$2,\!500
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Pension} = 20 \times \$2,\!500 = \$50,\!000
     \]
   
   - **Total Pension After 40 Years:**
     \[
     \$1,\!000,\!000 + \$50,\!000 = \$1,\!050,\!000
     \]

2. **Annual Pension After Quitting After 30 Years:**
   
   - **Years of Accumulated Pension:**
     \[
     30 \text{ years}
     \]
   
   - **Pension Rate After 30 Years:**
     \[
     5\% \text{ of } \$50,\!000 = \$2,\!500 \text{ per year}
     \]
   
   - **Annual Pension After Quitting:**
     \[
     \boxed{\$2,\!500}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$2,\!500}
\]
