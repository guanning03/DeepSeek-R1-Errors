Question:
John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?

Correct Answer:
When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home
He was only able to drive 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours in the first four hours
In half an hour he goes 30*.5=<<30*.5=15>>15 miles
He then drives another 2-.5=<<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 hours
In that time he goes 80*1.5=<<80*1.5=120>>120 miles
So he drove 120+15=<<120+15=135>>135 miles
So he is 180-135=<<180-135=45>>45 miles away from home

125

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the distance John covers going away from home. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so the distance is 3 hours multiplied by 60 mph, which equals 180 miles.

Next, he turns around and tries to return home. He intends to spend 4 hours in traffic, but the first 2 hours are standstill. Therefore, he has 2 hours left to reach home. During these 2 hours, he drives at 30 mph, covering 30 mph multiplied by 2 hours, which is 60 miles.

After that, he drives for the remaining 0.5 hours at 80 mph. The distance covered during this time is 80 mph multiplied by 0.5 hours, resulting in 40 miles.

Finally, to find the total distance from home, I'll add the distance he traveled away from home and the distance he traveled back towards home. That is 180 miles plus 60 miles plus 40 miles, totaling 280 miles.

**Solution:**

John's journey can be broken down into three parts:

1. **Going Away from Home:**
   
   - **Speed:** 60 mph
   - **Time:** 3 hours
   - **Distance:** \( 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Returning Home:**
   
   - **First Half of the 4 Hours:** Standstill traffic at 0 mph
   - **Next Half-Hour:** Drives at 30 mph
     - **Distance:** \( 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \)
   - **Remaining Time:** 0.5 hours (4 hours total - 2 hours standstill)
     - **Speed:** 80 mph
     - **Distance:** \( 80 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{miles} \)
   - **Total Return Distance:** \( 15 \, \text{miles} + 40 \, \text{miles} = 55 \, \text{miles} \)

3. **Final Distance from Home:**
   
   - **Total Distance Away:** 180 miles
   - **Total Distance Return:** 55 miles
   - **Final Distance from Home:** \( 180 \, \text{miles} - 55 \, \text{miles} = 125 \, \text{miles} \)

**Answer:** \(\boxed{125}\) miles
