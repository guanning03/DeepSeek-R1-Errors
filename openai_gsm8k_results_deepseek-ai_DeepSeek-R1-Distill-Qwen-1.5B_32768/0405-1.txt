Question:
John brings his dog to the vet. His dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, and a heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of his total bill. If he brought $125 with him, how much does he leave with?

Correct Answer:
The vaccines cost 40 because 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40
The vaccines are 40% of his total bill because 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40
The total bill is $100 because 40 / .4 = <<40/.4=100>>100
He leaves with $25 because 125 - 100 = <<125-100=25>>25

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the cost of the two vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, so two vaccines cost 2 multiplied by $20, which equals $40.

Next, I'll determine the cost of the heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. To find 60% of the $40 for the vaccines, I'll multiply $40 by 0.60, which equals $24.

Now, I'll add the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check to find the total bill: $40 plus $24 equals $64.

Finally, I'll subtract the total bill from the amount John brought with him. John had $125 and spent $64 on the vet check, leaving him with $61.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money John has left after visiting the vet.

1. **Calculate the cost of the two vaccines:**
   
   Each vaccine costs \$20.
   
   \[
   \text{Cost of vaccines} = 2 \times \$20 = \$40
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the heartworm check:**
   
   The heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill. Since the total bill includes both the vaccines and the heartworm check, let's denote the total bill as \( T \).
   
   \[
   \text{Heartworm check} = 0.60 \times T
   \]
   
   However, we already know that the total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
   
   \[
   T = \text{Cost of vaccines} + \text{Heartworm check}
   \]
   
   Substituting the known values:
   
   \[
   T = \$40 + 0.60 \times T
   \]
   
   To solve for \( T \), subtract \( 0.60 \times T \) from both sides:
   
   \[
   T - 0.60T = \$40
   \]
   
   \[
   0.40T = \$40
   \]
   
   Divide both sides by 0.40 to find \( T \):
   
   \[
   T = \frac{\$40}{0.40} = \$100
   \]
   
3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   
   The total amount spent at the vet is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
   
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = \$40 + \$24 = \$64
   \]
   
4. **Determine how much money John has left:**
   
   John initially brought \$125 with him. Subtract the total amount spent from this amount:
   
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \$125 - \$64 = \$61
   \]
   
**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{61}
\]
