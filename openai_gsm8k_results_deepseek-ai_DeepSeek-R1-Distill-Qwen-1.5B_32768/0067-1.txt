Question:
Jamaar loves fresh fruit and is headed to the store with $10 he earned mowing lawns. Including tax, peaches and pears are $.5 each, apples are $.75 each, kiwis are $1, and plums cost $.25 each. If he has already purchased 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples, how many plums can he buy?

Correct Answer:
He has spent $3.5 on peaches and pears because 7 x .5 = <<7*.5=3.5>>3.5
He has spent $2 on kiwis because 2 x 1 = <<2*1=2>>2
He has spent $3.75 on apples because 5 x .75 = <<5*.75=3.75>>3.75
He has already spent $9.25 because 3.5 + 2 + 3.75 = <<3.5+2+3.75=9.25>>9.25
He can buy three plums because .75 / .25 = <<.75/.25=3>>3

Wrong Answer:
To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, I'll start by calculating the total amount he has already spent on other fruits.

First, I'll calculate the cost of the peaches: 3 peaches at $0.50 each equal $1.50.
Next, the cost of the pears: 4 pears at $0.75 each equal $3.00.
Then, the cost of the kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.00 each equal $2.00.
After that, the cost of the apples: 5 apples at $0.25 each equal $1.25.

Adding up all these expenses: $1.50 + $3.00 + $2.00 + $1.25 = $7.75.

Jamaar has a total of $10, so the remaining amount he can spend is $10.00 - $7.75 = $2.25.

Each plum costs $0.25, so dividing the remaining money by the cost per plum gives 2.25 / 0.25 = 9 plums.

To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the fruits already purchased:**
   - **Peaches:** 3 peaches × \$0.50 = \$1.50
   - **Pears:** 4 pears × \$0.75 = \$3.00
   - **Kiwis:** 2 kiwis × \$1.00 = \$2.00
   - **Apples:** 5 apples × \$0.25 = \$1.25

2. **Sum the costs:**
   \[
   \$1.50 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 + \$1.25 = \$7.75
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining money available for new fruits:**
   \[
   \$10.00 - \$7.75 = \$2.25
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining money:**
   \[
   \frac{\$2.25}{\$0.25 \text{ per plum}} = 9 \text{ plums}
   \]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{9}\) plums.
