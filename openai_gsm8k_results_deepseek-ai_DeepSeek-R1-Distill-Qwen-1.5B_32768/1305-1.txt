Question:
Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. How load does it take to download the file?

Correct Answer:
First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB
Then divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes
Then find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes
Then add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes
#### 160

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, considering the restarts.

Normally, without any restarts, the download would take 200 GB รท 2 GB per minute = 100 minutes.

However, every time Windows forces a restart, it adds 20 minutes to the total time. This restart happens twice during the download.

Therefore, each restart adds 20 minutes, so two restarts add 20 minutes ร 2 = 40 minutes.

Finally, adding the restart time to the base download time gives the total time: 100 minutes + 40 minutes = 140 minutes.

To determine the total time Carla takes to download the 200 GB file, considering the restarts, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Time to Download Without Restarts:**
   
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{File Size}}{\text{Download Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Account for Restarts:**
   
   - **First Restart:**
     
     - **Download Time Before Restart:** 40% of 200 GB = 80 GB
     - **Time to Download 80 GB:** \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)
     - **Restart Time:** 20 minutes
     
   - **Second Restart:**
     
     - **Download Time Before Restart:** 40% of the remaining 120 GB = 48 GB
     - **Time to Download 48 GB:** \(\frac{48 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 24 \text{ minutes}\)
     - **Restart Time:** 20 minutes

3. **Total Time Calculation:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{Base Download Time} + \text{First Restart Time} + \text{Second Restart Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 100 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} + 24 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 184 \text{ minutes}
   \]

\boxed{184 \text{ minutes}}
