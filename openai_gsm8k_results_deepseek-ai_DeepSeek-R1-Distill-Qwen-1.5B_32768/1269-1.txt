Question:
Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook.  She put the same number of the pics into 8 albums.  3 of the albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits.  How many portraits and selfies did she have?

Correct Answer:
Olivia had 72 pictures / 8 albums = <<72/8=9>>9 picture per album.
Olivia had 3 selfie albums * 9 pictures = <<3*9=27>>27 pictures.
Olivia had 2 portrait albums * 9 pictures = <<2*9=18>>18 pictures.
The total of portraits and selfies for Olivia is 27 + 18 = <<27+18=45>>45 pictures.

Wrong Prediction:
27

Wrong Answer:
First, Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures to Facebook.

She distributed these pictures equally into 8 albums.

To find out how many pictures are in each album, divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:
72 pictures ÷ 8 albums = 9 pictures per album.

Out of these 8 albums, 3 are selfies and 2 are portraits.

Therefore, the number of selfie pictures is 3 albums × 9 pictures per album = 27 pictures.

The number of portrait pictures is 2 albums × 9 pictures per album = 18 pictures.

To determine how many portraits and selfies Olivia had, let's break down the information step by step.

**Given:**
- Total pictures uploaded: \(72\)
- Number of albums: \(8\)
- Selfies: \(3\) albums
- Portraits: \(2\) albums

**Step 1: Calculate the number of pictures per album.**

Since Olivia equally distributed the pictures into \(8\) albums:
\[
\text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of selfie pictures.**

There are \(3\) selfie albums:
\[
\text{Selfie pictures} = 3 \times 9 = 27
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of portrait pictures.**

There are \(2\) portrait albums:
\[
\text{Portrait pictures} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{27 \text{ portraits and } 18 \text{ selfies}}
\]
