Question:
The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays, 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays and twice as many on Friday. How many chimichangas do they make on those three days?

Correct Answer:
125*2 = <<125*2=250>>250 chimichangas are made on Friday.
In those three days 125+125+250 = <<125+125+250=500>>500 chimichangas are made.
#### 500

Gold:
500

Wrong Prediction:
750

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the number of chimichangas made on each of the three days: Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the shop makes 125 chimichangas each day.

On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday or Wednesday. So, I'll calculate 2 multiplied by 125, which equals 250 chimichangas on Fridays.

Next, I'll add up the chimichangas made on all three days:
- Tuesday: 125
- Wednesday: 125
- Friday: 250

Adding these together, 125 plus 125 is 250, and 250 plus 250 equals 500.

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on these three days is 500.

To determine the total number of chimichangas made by Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, follow these steps:

1. **Number of chimichangas on Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   \[
   125 \text{ chimichangas/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 250 \text{ chimichangas}
   \]

2. **Number of chimichangas on Friday:**
   \[
   2 \times 125 = 250 \text{ chimichangas}
   \]

3. **Total number of chimichangas over the three days:**
   \[
   250 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 250 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} = 750 \text{ chimichangas}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{750}
\]
