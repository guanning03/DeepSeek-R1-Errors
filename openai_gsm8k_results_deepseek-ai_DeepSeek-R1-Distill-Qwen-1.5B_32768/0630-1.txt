Question:
A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?

Correct Answer:
On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons
In the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons
The amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons
#### 6000

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total capacity of the tank, which is 18,000 gallons.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity. So, Wanda pumped 1/4 × 18,000 = 4,500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 of the amount Wanda filled that day, which is 3/4 × 4,500 = 3,375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of what she did on the first day. So, Wanda pumped (2/3) × 4,500 = 3,000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is (1/3) × 3,375 = 1,125 gallons.

Adding both days of water pumped, the total pumped is 4,500 + 3,375 + 3,000 + 1,125 = 11,900 gallons.

Finally, to find out how many gallons remain to fill the tank, subtract the total pumped from the tank's capacity: 18,000 - 11,900 = 6,100 gallons.

To determine how many gallons of water remain to fill the tank, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Given:**
- **Capacity of the tank:** 18,000 gallons
- **Day 1:**
  - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
  - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the amount Wanda filled.
- **Day 2:**
  - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she did on Day 1.
  - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she did on Day 1.

### **Step 1: Calculate the amount pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on Day 1.**

- **Wanda's work on Day 1:**
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 18,\!000 = 4,\!500 \text{ gallons}
  \]
  
- **Ms. B's work on Day 1:**
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} \times 4,\!500 = 3,\!375 \text{ gallons}
  \]

### **Step 2: Calculate the amount pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on Day 2.**

- **Wanda's work on Day 2:**
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 4,\!500 = 3,\!000 \text{ gallons}
  \]
  
- **Ms. B's work on Day 2:**
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 3,\!375 = 1,\!125 \text{ gallons}
  \]

### **Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days.**

\[
\text{Total Pumped} = 4,\!500 + 3,\!375 + 3,\!000 + 1,\!125 = 11,\!900 \text{ gallons}
\]

### **Step 4: Determine the remaining gallons needed to fill the tank.**

\[
\text{Remaining} = 18,\!000 \text{ gallons} - 11,\!900 \text{ gallons} = 6,\!100 \text{ gallons}
\]

\[
\boxed{6,\!100}
\]
