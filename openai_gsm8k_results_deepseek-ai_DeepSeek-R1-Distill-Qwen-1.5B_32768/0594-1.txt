Question:
The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. How much will it cost to fill the pool?

Correct Answer:
Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet
He followed the pool company instructions and found his pool required 1,400 x 5.9 = <<1400*5.9=8260>>8,260 gallons of water.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 x 8,260 gallons = $<<0.10*8260=826>>826.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool using the given dimensions: width, length, and depth. The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.

Next, I'll use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is volume = width × length × depth. Plugging in the measurements, the volume is 14 × 25 × 4 cubic feet.

After calculating the volume, I need to determine how many gallons of water are required. The pool company recommends multiplying the volume in gallons by 5.9 to get the total water needed.

Finally, to find the total cost, I'll multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon, which is $0.10. This will give me the final amount the pool company charges for filling the pool.

To determine the cost of filling the swimming pool, follow these steps:

**1. Calculate the Volume of the Pool:**

The pool is shaped like a rectangular prism. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:

\[
V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth}
\]

Given:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[
V = 14 \, \text{ft} \times 25 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

**2. Convert Cubic Feet to Gallons:**

The volume in gallons depends on the conversion factor. For swimming pools, 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons.

\[
\text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{ft}^3 \times 7.48 \, \text{gallons/ft}^3 = 10472 \, \text{gallons}
\]

**3. Calculate the Total Cost:**

The pool company charges $0.10 per gallon.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \times \$0.10/\text{gallon} = \$1047.20
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$1047.20}
\]
