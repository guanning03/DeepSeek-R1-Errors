Question:
Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?

Correct Answer:
Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.
Finally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.
Rose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.
But the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.
So Rose has 101-22=<<101-22=79>>79 petals worth remaining

Wrong Prediction:
101

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the number of flowers Rose picked of each type and their corresponding petal counts.

She picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each, totaling 15 petals.
She then picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each, totaling 24 petals.
Next, she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each, totaling 20 petals.
Lastly, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each, totaling 42 petals.

So, the total number of petals is 15 + 24 + 20 + 42, which equals 101 petals.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase.

1. **First Set of Flowers:**
   - **Number of flowers:** 3
   - **Petals per flower:** 5
   - **Total petals:** \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)

2. **Second Set of Flowers:**
   - **Number of flowers:** 4
   - **Petals per flower:** 6
   - **Total petals:** \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \)

3. **Third Set of Flowers:**
   - **Number of flowers:** 5
   - **Petals per flower:** 4
   - **Total petals:** \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)

4. **Fourth Set of Flowers:**
   - **Number of flowers:** 6
   - **Petals per flower:** 7
   - **Total petals:** \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \)

5. **Total Number of Petals:**
   - Sum all the petals from each set:
   \[
   15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101
   \]

Therefore, the total number of petals on all the flowers in the vase is:

\[
\boxed{101}
\]
