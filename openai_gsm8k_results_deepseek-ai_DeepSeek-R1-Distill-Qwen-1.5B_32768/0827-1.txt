Question:
Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade. For each gallon they make it costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. If they made $25 in profit, how much did they spend on lemons?

Correct Answer:
Each gallon sells for a total of $10 because 20 x .5 = <<20*.5=10>>10
Each gallon costs $5 to make because 3 + 2 = <<5=5>>5
They make $5 off each gallon because 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5
They made and sold 5 gallons because 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5
They spent $15 on lemons because 5 x 3 = <<5*3=15>>15
#### 15

Wrong Prediction:
7.50

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the total cost per gallon by adding the costs of lemons and sugar. Lemons cost $3 and sugar costs $2, so the total cost per gallon is $5.

Next, I'll determine how many gallons they sold. Since they made $25 in profit and each gallon yields $0.50, they sold 50 gallons.

Now, I'll find out how much they spent on lemons by multiplying the number of gallons sold by the cost per gallon for lemons. This gives them $300 spent on lemons.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons.

1. **Calculate the total cost per gallon:**
   - **Lemons:** \$3 per gallon
   - **Sugar:** \$2 per gallon
   - **Total Cost per gallon:** 
     \[
     \$3 + \$2 = \$5 \text{ per gallon}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of gallons sold based on profit:**
   - **Profit per gallon:** 
     \[
     \$0.50 \text{ per glass} \times 20 \text{ glasses per gallon} = \$10 \text{ per gallon}
     \]
   - **Number of gallons sold:**
     \[
     \frac{\$25 \text{ profit}}{\$10 \text{ per gallon}} = 2.5 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost spent on lemons:**
   - **Total cost for lemons:**
     \[
     2.5 \text{ gallons} \times \$3 \text{ per gallon} = \$7.50
     \]

\[
\boxed{\$7.50}
\]
