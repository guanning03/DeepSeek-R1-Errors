Question:
Peter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?

Correct Answer:
There are 7 days in a week so if he wishes to spend an equal amount of $70 each day that would be $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10
For four days (Sunday through Wednesday) he will spend 4*$10 = $<<4*10=40>>40
He will spend $40 on wooden action figures of $5 each which gives $40/$5 = <<40/5=8>>8 wooden action figures
For the remaining 3 days he will spend 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30
He will spend $30 on plastic action figures of $2 each which gives $30/$2 = <<30/2=15>>15 plastic action figures
Altogether, he will have 8+15 = <<8+15=23>>23 action figures.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, let me try to figure out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. So, Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, which is 7 days. That means each day, he plans to spend $70 divided by 7, which is $10 per day. Okay, so every day, he's going to spend $10.

From Sunday to Wednesday, that's 5 days, right? So, he's going to spend $10 each day for 5 days. Let me calculate how much he spends on wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so I can find out how many he can buy by dividing the total amount he spends on wooden figures by the cost per figure.

So, $10 per day times 5 days is $50. That means he spends $50 on wooden action figures. Since each wooden figure is $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is 50 divided by 5, which is 10. So, he buys 10 wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday.

Now, for the rest of the week, which is from Thursday to Sunday, that's 3 days. He wants to buy plastic action figures instead, each costing $2. He still needs to spend $10 each day, so over 3 days, that's 3 times $10, which is $30. So, he spends $30 on plastic action figures.

To find out how many plastic action figures he buys, I divide the total amount by the cost per plastic figure. So, $30 divided by $2 is 15. Therefore, he buys 15 plastic action figures.

Now, to find the total number of action figures he has by the end of the week, I need to add the wooden ones and the plastic ones together. So, 10 wooden action figures plus 15 plastic action figures equals 25 action figures in total.

Wait, let me double-check that. On Sundays to Wednesdays, he buys 10 wooden figures. From Thursday to Sunday, that's 3 days, so 3 times 10 is 30. On plastic, each is $2, so 30 divided by 2 is 15. 10 plus 15 is indeed 25. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think he's buying any extra or anything; he's just spending $10 each day, splitting it between wooden and plastic figures. So, the total number should be 25. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{25}

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, which is 7 days. Therefore, he plans to spend $10 per day.

From Sunday to Wednesday (5 days), he spends $10 each day on wooden action figures. The total amount spent on wooden action figures is:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times \$10/\text{day} = \$50 \]
Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:
\[ \$50 \div \$5/\text{figure} = 10 \text{ figures} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday, 3 days), he spends $10 each day on plastic action figures. The total amount spent on plastic action figures is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times \$10/\text{day} = \$30 \]
Since each plastic action figure costs $2, the number of plastic action figures he buys is:
\[ \$30 \div \$2/\text{figure} = 15 \text{ figures} \]

Adding the wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:
\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \]

\[
\boxed{25}
\]
