Question:
A company's HR hires 20 new employees every month to add to its total workforce. If the company's initial employee number is 200, and each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months?

Correct Answer:
If each month the company hire 20 new employees, the total number of employees in the company in the first month is 200 employees + 20 employees = <<200+20=220>>220 employees
If each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money paid by the employee to its workers in the first month is 220 employees * $4000/employee = $<<220*4000=880000>>880000
In the second month, 20 more workers are hired, bringing the total number of employees to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees
The company pays a total of 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000 in wages for its employees in the second month.
When an additional 20 workers are hired in the third month, the total number of workers become 240 employees + 20 employees = <<240+20=260>>260 employees
In total, the company 260 employees * $4000/employee = $<<260*4000=1040000>>1040000 in wages on the third month.
The total amount of money the company pays to all its employees in the three months is $1040000 + $960000 + $880000 = <<1040000+960000+880000=2880000>>2880000

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the initial number of employees and the number of employees added each month.

The company starts with 200 employees, and 20 new employees are hired each month.

After three months, the total number of employees is calculated by adding the initial employees to the product of the number of employees added each month and the number of months.

Next, calculate the total salary by multiplying the total number of employees by the monthly salary per employee.

Finally, present the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months.

To determine the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of employees after three months:**

   - **Initial number of employees:** 200
   - **Number of employees added each month:** 20
   - **Number of months:** 3

   \[
   \text{Total employees} = \text{Initial employees} + (\text{Employees added per month} \times \text{Number of months})
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total employees} = 200 + (20 \times 3) = 200 + 60 = 260
   \]

2. **Calculate the total salary paid to all employees:**

   - **Monthly salary per employee:** \$4,000
   - **Total number of employees:** 260

   \[
   \text{Total salary} = \text{Total employees} \times \text{Monthly salary}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total salary} = 260 \times 4000 = 1,040,000
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**

   \[
   \boxed{1,\!040,\!000}
   \]
