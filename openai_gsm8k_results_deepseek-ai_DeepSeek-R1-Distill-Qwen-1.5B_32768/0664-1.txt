Question:
Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?

Correct Answer:
In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kernels pop.
Thus, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = <<20+60+80+40+10=210>>210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out how many popcorn kernels Garrett has to eat after he pops them for his snack. Let me try to break this down step by step because it seems a bit complicated with all these different rates and time intervals. I'll take it slowly and make sure I understand each part before moving on.

First, the problem says that as the pan heats up, the kernels start popping faster. Let me note down the given information:

- **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
- **Next 30 seconds**: Three times that amount. So, 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
- **Next 30 seconds**: Four times the initial rate. Wait, hold on. Is that four times the initial rate, or four times the number of kernels popped in the first 30 seconds? Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read it again: "four times the initial popping rate." So, the initial rate was 20 kernels in 30 seconds. So, four times that would be 4 * 20 = 80 kernels in the next 30 seconds. Yeah, that makes sense.
  
- **Final 30 seconds**: The popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. Wait, so the past 30 seconds refers to the initial 30 seconds? Or the most recent? Hmm. It says "the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds." So, the rate in the final 30 seconds is half of the rate it had in the previous 30 seconds. But wait, the previous 30 seconds would be the initial 30 seconds, which was 20 kernels. So, half of that would be 10 kernels in the last 30 seconds. Is that right? Let me think. So each subsequent 30-second interval is half the rate of the previous one. So, initial is 20, next is 60 (which is 3*20), next is 80 (which is 4*20), and the last is 10 (which is half of 20). So that seems consistent.

Now, after all that, the problem says: After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 10 popped from the residual heat. So, 10 / 4 = 2.5. Wait, but you can't have half a kernel, so maybe 2 or 3. Hmm, but let me think again. Maybe the problem doesn't require fractional kernels, so maybe it's okay to have 2.5, but actually, popping from residual heat might imply that the residual heat is what's left, but the number of kernels popping from the residual heat is a quarter of the final 30 seconds. So, 10 popped in the final 30 seconds, so a quarter of that is 2.5. Hmm, but that might not be an integer. Maybe I need to check if this part needs to round up or down. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe it's okay to have 2.5, but since we can't have half a kernel, perhaps it's 2 or 3. Hmm, but let's hold on that part for now.

So, the total number of popped kernels would be the sum of all the popping in each interval plus the popping from the residual heat. So, let's note down:

- First interval (30 sec): 20 kernels.
- Second interval (30 sec): 60 kernels.
- Third interval (30 sec): 80 kernels.
- Fourth interval (30 sec): 10 kernels.

But then, after the pan is off, a quarter of the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. So, the final 30 seconds popped 10 kernels, so a quarter is 2.5, which we can treat as 2.5 for now.

Wait, but actually, maybe the residual heat is the remaining kernels, but the popping from residual heat is dependent on how much is left. So, perhaps we need to calculate how many kernels are left after each interval and then compute how many pop from the residual heat.

Let me try that approach.

Let me denote:

- Let’s say the pan starts with N kernels. But the problem doesn't specify how many kernels were on the pan to begin with. Hmm, that's a problem. The problem says "as the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster." So, maybe all the kernels are popping simultaneously as the pan heats up? Or does the pan have some number of kernels that start popping?

Wait, the problem is a bit unclear on whether the pan has a certain number of kernels or if all the kernels are being popped as the pan heats up. But the problem says "the kernels start popping faster," so I think all the kernels are being popped as the pan heats up.

But then, when the pan is taken off, some residual heat remains, but how much? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that as the pan heats up, all the kernels are popping, and as it cools, the residual heat causes some popping as well. But the problem says "a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat." So, maybe the number of kernels popped in the final 30 seconds is 10, and a quarter of that is 2.5 pop from residual heat.

But since we can't have half a kernel, perhaps we have to consider that the residual pop is 2 or 3. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe we can take 2.5 as is.

Alternatively, maybe I have to consider the residual heat as the remaining kernels that are left from the last interval. So, perhaps the residual pop is dependent on how many kernels were left in the last interval. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is structured so that after each interval, some kernels remain, and the residual heat is the remaining kernels that can pop. So, let me try to model that.

Let's denote:

- Let’s say the pan starts with a certain number of kernels, say K.

- First 30 seconds: 20 kernels pop. So, K becomes K - 20.

- Next 30 seconds: 60 kernels pop. So, K becomes K - 20 - 60.

- Next 30 seconds: 80 kernels pop. K becomes K - 20 - 60 - 80.

- Final 30 seconds: 10 kernels pop. So, K becomes K - 20 - 60 - 80 - 10 = K - 170.

But, after the pan is taken off, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. So, 10 popped in the final 30 seconds, so a quarter is 2.5. So, 2.5 popped from residual heat.

But the number of residual kernels is K - 170. So, 2.5 popped from residual heat. So, 2.5 = K - 170. So, K = 170 + 2.5 = 172.5.

Wait, but the number of kernels must be an integer. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the residual heat is only the residual from the last interval, so the residual pop is 10*(1/4) = 2.5. But perhaps the residual is the remaining kernels, so perhaps we need to model the total popped kernels as the sum of each interval, plus the residual pop.

But I think the problem is probably intended to be solved without considering the initial number of kernels, but rather just the rates over time.

Wait, maybe the problem is saying that each interval is 30 seconds, and the popping rate is proportional to the initial rate.

Wait, let's read the problem again:

"Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds."

So, the initial rate is 20 pops per 30 seconds. Then, it's three times that in the next 30 seconds, so 60 pops. Then, four times the initial rate, so 80 pops. Then, half of the past rate, so 10 pops.

So, each 30-second interval has a certain number of pops:

- 30-60 seconds: 20 pops
- 60-90 seconds: 60 pops
- 90-120 seconds: 80 pops
- 120-150 seconds: 10 pops

So, total pops would be 20 + 60 + 80 + 10 = 170 pops.

Then, after the pan is taken off, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, 10 pops in the final 30 seconds, so a quarter is 2.5 pops from residual heat.

So, total popped kernels would be 170 + 2.5 = 172.5. But since you can't have half a kernel, perhaps it's 173? Or maybe I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, but maybe the residual heat isn't about the remaining kernels, but about the residual popping rate. Hmm. Maybe the residual popping rate is half of the previous rate, so the residual popping rate is 10 pops per 30 seconds. So, if you have some residual heat, then the residual popping rate is 10 pops per 30 seconds. Then, a quarter of that, which is 2.5 pops, pop from the residual heat. So, 2.5 pops from residual heat.

But again, you can't have half a kernel. So, maybe the problem expects us to consider 2 or 3. Hmm, but in reality, you can't have half a kernel, so perhaps the problem is expecting a fractional result, but since the question is asking how many pieces to eat, maybe it's okay to have a fractional number? But I don't think so, because you can't eat half a kernel. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I misinterpret the problem. Maybe the residual popping is from the residual heat, but the number of popped kernels is only the residual pops, which are dependent on how much is left.

Wait, maybe the residual popping is just the residual amount, so if in the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the popped kernels (10) pop from the residual heat, so 2.5 popped from residual. So, total popped is 170 + 2.5 = 172.5. But since you can't have half a kernel, maybe we need to round to the nearest whole number, which is 173. But the problem says "how many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat," which is a countable number, so 173 is not a whole number. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to model the total number of kernels popped in each interval and then the residual popping. But without knowing the initial number of kernels, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps another way. Maybe all the popped kernels are in the first interval, then each subsequent interval is a certain number, and then the residual heat is 2.5 pops, so total is 170 + 2.5 = 172.5. But since you can't have half a kernel, maybe the problem expects 172 or 173.

But the problem is structured such that each interval is 30 seconds, and the number of popped kernels is given as 20, 60, 80, 10. So, maybe the residual popping is 2.5, but since we can't have half a kernel, maybe they just expect 2.5 added to 170, so 172.5. But the problem is in a math competition or something, so maybe it's expecting a fractional answer? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat." So, 10 popped in the final 30 seconds, so a quarter is 2.5. So, 2.5 popped from residual heat. So, total popped is 170 + 2.5 = 172.5.

But since we can't have half a kernel, maybe it's 173. But the problem is in a math problem, so maybe it's okay to have a fractional answer. But I think in the context of the problem, they might expect a whole number, so maybe it's 173.

But wait, let's think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial intervals.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again.

"Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds."

So, first 30 seconds: 20.

Next 30 seconds: 3*20 = 60.

Next 30 seconds: 4*20 = 80.

Final 30 seconds: 80 / 2 = 40? Wait, wait, hold on.

Wait, the problem says "the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds." So, is it half of the initial rate or half of the current rate?

Wait, let's parse that sentence again: "in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds." So, "half the rate as the past 30 seconds." Hmm, so it's half of what it was in the past 30 seconds.

But the past 30 seconds would be the initial 30 seconds, which was 20. So, half of 20 is 10. So, final 30 seconds rate is 10 pops per 30 seconds.

Therefore, the final 30 seconds is 10 pops.

So, the total popped is 20 + 60 + 80 + 10 = 170.

Then, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds (which is 10) pop from the residual heat. So, 10 * (1/4) = 2.5.

So, total popped is 170 + 2.5 = 172.5.

But as I said earlier, we can't have half a kernel, so maybe it's 173, but 172.5 is the exact value.

Wait, but maybe I misinterpreted the last sentence. Maybe it's half of the current popping rate, not half of the past 30 seconds.

Wait, the problem says: "the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds." Hmm, so "as the past 30 seconds" suggests it's referring to the rate in the past 30 seconds, which would be 20. So, half of 20 is 10. So, the final rate is 10.

Alternatively, maybe it's half of the current rate. Wait, the sentence is ambiguous. If it's "half the rate as the past 30 seconds," then yes, half of 20 is 10. But if it's "half the rate of the current rate," then it's half of the current rate. But the wording is "as the past 30 seconds," which is more likely referring to the rate in the past 30 seconds.

So, I think 10 is correct.

Therefore, total popped is 170 + 2.5 = 172.5, which is 172.5. But since you can't have half a kernel, maybe 173. But the problem is asking for how many pieces of popcorn, so it's expecting a whole number. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the residual popping is 2.5, but since we can't have half a kernel, perhaps we have to round up, so 3. But that might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe I need to model the residual popping as the residual from the last interval, so:

After each interval, some kernels are left, and then a quarter of the popped in the last interval pop from residual heat.

Wait, let's try that approach.

So, first interval (30 sec): 20 popped. So, remaining kernels: N - 20.

Second interval (30 sec): 60 popped. So, remaining kernels: N - 20 - 60.

Third interval (30 sec): 80 popped. Remaining: N - 20 - 60 - 80.

Fourth interval (30 sec): 10 popped. Remaining: N - 20 - 60 - 80 - 10 = N - 170.

So, after the pan is taken off, the residual heat would have N - 170 kernels remaining.

Then, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds (10) pop from the residual heat. So, 10 * (1/4) = 2.5 popped from residual heat.

Thus, total popped is 20 + 60 + 80 + 10 + 2.5 = 172.5.

But again, the number of popped kernels must be integer. So, maybe N is such that after popping 20, 60, 80, 10, the remaining is 0 or some number that allows for a quarter of 10 to pop from residual heat.

Wait, if the residual popping is 2.5, then the residual heat must have 2.5 kernels. But you can't have half a kernel, so perhaps N is such that after each interval, the residual is 2.5. Hmm.

Wait, if after the first interval, 20 popped, so remaining is N - 20.

After the second interval, 60 popped, so remaining is N - 20 - 60.

After the third interval, 80 popped, so remaining is N - 20 - 60 - 80.

After the fourth interval, 10 popped, so remaining is N - 170.

So, if we have residual popping of 2.5, then N - 170 must equal 2.5, so N = 172.5. But N must be an integer, so 172 or 173. Hmm.

But we don't know the initial number of kernels N. So, we can't determine it without more information. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the total popped as 172.5, which is 172.5, but since we can't have half a kernel, maybe it's 173, but then the residual popping would be 2.5, which is half a kernel, so that doesn't add up.

Wait, no, the residual popping is dependent on the residual heat. So, if in the final 30 seconds, 10 popped, and a quarter of that popped from residual, which is 2.5. So, the residual popping is 2.5. So, total popped is 172.5.

But since we need an integer, maybe the answer is 173, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the residual popping and just add 170 + 2.5 = 172.5, and since the problem says "how many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat," it might accept 172.5 as the answer, but since you can't eat half a kernel, perhaps they expect 173.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe we're overcomplicating it, and all the popping is additive without worrying about residual, so just add all the popped pops plus the residual pops.

Wait, let's think about the residual popping. The problem says, "a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat." So, if in the final 30 seconds, 10 popped, then a quarter of that is 2.5 pop from residual heat. So, the residual popping is 2.5. So, the total popped is 170 + 2.5 = 172.5.

But since we can't have half a kernel, maybe the problem is expecting 173, but since the original question is in a math context, maybe fractional answers are allowed, so 172.5 is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to ignore the residual popping and just add all the popped pops, so 170, but that doesn't make sense because the residual is adding another 2.5.

Wait, let me think again.

Each interval has a certain number of popped kernels, and then a quarter of the last interval's popped pops pop from residual. So, the total popped would be the sum of each interval plus the residual popping.

So, 20 + 60 + 80 + 10 + 2.5 = 172.5.

Alternatively, maybe the residual popping is 2.5, but it's a quarter of the last interval, so maybe the residual popping is 2.5, but that's 2.5, which is a quarter of 10. So, 2.5 popped from residual, but the residual itself is 2.5.

Wait, maybe the residual popping is a quarter of the last interval, so 10 * 0.25 = 2.5.

Therefore, total popped is 20 + 60 + 80 + 10 + 2.5 = 172.5.

But since you can't have half a kernel, maybe we have to round up or down. Hmm. But the problem is presented as a math problem, so it's likely expecting an exact number. So, maybe 172.5 is the answer, but that's 172.5, which is a fraction. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the residual popping is 2.5, but then the residual popping is 2.5, so 2.5 popped from residual, and the rest popped in the last interval is 10. So, total popped is 20 + 60 + 80 + 10 + 2.5 = 172.5.

But perhaps the problem is designed so that you can have a fractional number, so 172.5 is acceptable, but in the context of the problem, the number of kernels popped is a whole number, so maybe 173 is the answer. But I don't know.

Wait, let me see. If the problem is presented in a math competition, sometimes fractional answers are okay, but in others, maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is designed so that the residual popping is 2.5, but you can have half a kernel pop from residual. Maybe, for the sake of the problem, we just add 172.5, and since the answer is how many pieces, we can write it as 172.5, but since it's a math problem, maybe it's 172.5.

Wait, no, 172.5 is 172 and a half, but you can't have half a kernel, so maybe you have to eat 173, but you can't have a half kernel popping. So, unless the problem is expecting fractional, but since it's about pieces of popcorn, likely integer.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me go back.

"Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds."

So, after the initial 30 seconds, 20 popped.

Next 30 seconds: 3*20 = 60 popped.

Next 30 seconds: 4*20 = 80 popped.

Final 30 seconds: 80 / 2 = 40 popped? Wait, no, the problem says "half the rate as the past 30 seconds," which is 20, so 10 popped.

So, 10 popped in final 30 seconds.

Then, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. So, 10 * (1/4) = 2.5 popped from residual.

So, total popped is 20 + 60 + 80 + 10 + 2.5 = 172.5.

So, maybe the answer is 172.5, but since we can't have half a kernel, perhaps the problem expects us to consider 173, but it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have all the popped pops as integers, so 170 + 2.5 = 172.5. So, maybe 172.5 is the answer.

But let me check, maybe the residual popping is 2.5, but 2.5 is only a quarter of 10, so maybe the problem expects 172.5, and we can write it as 172.5. But in the context of the problem, maybe it's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem, and the residual popping is not 2.5, but rather 10 * 0.25 = 2.5, but that's the same.

Wait, maybe the problem is expecting me to sum all the popped pops, regardless of the residual, so 20 + 60 + 80 + 10 = 170, plus 2.5 from residual, so 172.5.

But I think in the context of the problem, they might accept 172.5, but perhaps they want it as a fraction, like 172.5, which is 172 and a half.

But since it's in the context of a snack, the number of popped kernels is a whole number, so maybe the answer is 173.

Wait, but 172.5 is exactly half of 173, but maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe I need to model the residual popping as the residual from the last interval, but the problem says a quarter of the popped in the final 30 seconds pop from residual.

So, if in the final 30 seconds, 10 popped, a quarter is 2.5 pop from residual heat.

So, total popped is 170 + 2.5 = 172.5.

Therefore, the answer is 172.5, but since we can't have half a kernel, maybe the problem is expecting 173, but I can't be sure.

Wait, but 2.5 is exactly half of 5, so maybe 172.5 is the correct answer, and we can present it as 172.5.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that we can ignore the residual popping, and just add all the popped pops, so 170, but that can't be, because a quarter of the final interval is popping from residual, so 2.5 is needed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the residual popping be 2.5, but since it's a quarter of the final interval, it's 2.5.

Wait, I think I have to go with 172.5, as that's the exact calculation.

But in the problem statement, the number of popped in the final 30 seconds is 10. So, a quarter of that is 2.5, so 2.5 popped from residual. So, total is 170 + 2.5 = 172.5.

So, maybe the answer is 172.5, or 173.

But let's think again: The problem says "a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat." So, 10 popped in the final 30 seconds, so a quarter is 2.5 popped from residual.

So, it's not 2.5 popped from residual, but 2.5 pops popped from residual. So, the residual popping is 2.5.

Therefore, total popped is 170 + 2.5 = 172.5.

So, in conclusion, I think the answer is 172.5, which is 172.5. So, I think that's the answer they expect.

**Final Answer**
Garrett has to eat \boxed{172.5} pieces of popcorn.

Wait, but the problem is about the number of pieces, so it's expecting an integer. Hmm. Maybe I need to present it as 173? Or maybe it's 172.5 is acceptable. Hmm.

Wait, in the problem, the popping rates are in number of pops per 30 seconds, but they are not necessarily integers. So, the number of popped kernels is 20, 60, 80, 10, which are integers, but the residual popping is 2.5, which is non-integer. But in reality, you can't have half a kernel popping. So, perhaps the problem expects 173, or maybe 172.5 is acceptable.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the initial intervals. Let me check again.

First interval: 20 popped.

Second: 3 times that amount: 60 popped.

Third: 4 times the initial rate: 80 popped.

Fourth: half the rate of the past: 10 popped.

So, total popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 10 = 170.

Residual popping: 10 * 0.25 = 2.5.

So, total: 170 + 2.5 = 172.5.

So, 172.5 is the exact number. So, maybe that's the answer. Since it's a math problem, it's okay to have a fractional answer.

Therefore, I think the answer is 172.5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{172.5}
</think>

Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. The problem states that the kernels start popping faster as the pan heats up. The initial interval of 30 seconds has 20 popped kernels. The next interval of 30 seconds has three times that rate, which is 60 popped kernels. The third interval of 30 seconds has four times the initial rate, which is 80 popped kernels. The final interval of 30 seconds has half the rate of the previous interval, which is 10 popped kernels.

Additionally, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds (10) pop from the residual heat, which is 2.5 popped kernels.

The total number of popped kernels is calculated as follows:
- First interval: 20
- Second interval: 60
- Third interval: 80
- Fourth interval: 10
- Residual popping: 2.5

Adding these together, the total number of popped kernels is:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 10 + 2.5 = 172.5 \]

Thus, the number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[
\boxed{172.5}
\]
