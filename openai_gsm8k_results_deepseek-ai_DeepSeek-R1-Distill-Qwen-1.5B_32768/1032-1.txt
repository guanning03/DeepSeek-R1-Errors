Question:
Patrick has three glue sticks that are partially used. One has 1/6 left, the second has 2/3 left and the third one has 1/2 left. If a glue stick is 12 millimeters long originally, what is the total length of the glue sticks that are not used?

Correct Answer:
The first glue stick has 12 x 1/6 = <<12*1/6=2>>2 millimeters left.
The second glue stick has 12 x 2/3 = <<12*2/3=8>>8 millimeters left.
The third glue stick has 12 x 1/2 = <<12*1/2=6>>6 millimeters left.
There are a total of 2 + 8 + 6 = <<2+8+6=16>>16 millimeters of glue sticks that are not used.
#### 16

Wrong Answer:
To determine the total length of the unused glue sticks, I will calculate the unused portion of each glue stick separately and then sum them up.

First, I'll find the unused length of the first glue stick. It has 1/6 of its original length left, and since the original length is 12 millimeters, the unused length is 12 multiplied by 1/6, which equals 2 millimeters.

Next, I'll calculate the unused length of the second glue stick. It has 2/3 of its original length remaining, so the unused length is 12 multiplied by 2/3, resulting in 8 millimeters.

Then, I'll determine the unused length of the third glue stick. It has 1/2 of its original length left, meaning the unused length is 12 multiplied by 1/2, which equals 6 millimeters.

Finally, I'll add up the unused lengths of all three glue sticks: 2 millimeters + 8 millimeters + 6 millimeters equals 16 millimeters in total.

To find the total length of the unused glue sticks, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the unused length of each glue stick:**
   
   - **First glue stick:** 
     \[
     \frac{1}{6} \times 12\ \text{mm} = 2\ \text{mm}
     \]
   
   - **Second glue stick:** 
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 12\ \text{mm} = 8\ \text{mm}
     \]
   
   - **Third glue stick:** 
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 12\ \text{mm} = 6\ \text{mm}
     \]

2. **Sum the unused lengths:**
   
   \[
   2\ \text{mm} + 8\ \text{mm} + 6\ \text{mm} = 16\ \text{mm}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16\ \text{mm}}
\]
