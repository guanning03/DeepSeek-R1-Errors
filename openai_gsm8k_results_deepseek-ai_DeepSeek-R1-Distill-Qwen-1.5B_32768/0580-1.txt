Question:
Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, driving 55 miles per hour. Tom is driving 70 miles per hour. How long will it take Tom to catch up with Bob?

Correct Answer:
Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour to Bob's 55 miles per hour, meaning Tom is gaining at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = <<70-55=15>>15 mph.
Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, and if Tom is gaining 15 mph on him, it will take Tom 75 miles / 15 mph = <<75/15=5>>5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Wrong Answer:
First, identify the initial distance between Bob and Tom, which is 75 miles.

Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour, and Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour.

The relative speed between Tom and Bob is the difference in their speeds: 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.

To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up, use the formula:
Time = Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours.
</think>

To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we can use the concept of relative speed. Here's a step-by-step solution:

**Given:**
- **Distance between Bob and Tom:** 75 miles
- **Bob's speed:** 55 miles per hour (mph)
- **Tom's speed:** 70 mph

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate the Relative Speed:**
   \[
   \text{Relative Speed} = \text{Tom's speed} - \text{Bob's speed} = 70\,\text{mph} - 55\,\text{mph} = 15\,\text{mph}
   \]
   
2. **Determine the Time to Catch Up:**
   The time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob can be found by dividing the initial distance between them by the relative speed.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75\,\text{miles}}{15\,\text{mph}} = 5\,\text{hours}
   \]
   
**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{5\ \text{hours}}
\]
