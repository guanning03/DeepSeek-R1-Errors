Question:
Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $350 000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?

Correct Answer:
The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.
The transfer fee is $350 000 x 12/100 = $<<350000*12/100=42000>>42000.
The total price of the house is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $409 500.
So, it is $409 500 - $400 000 = $<<409500-400000=9500>>9500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.
#### 9500

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total additional costs associated with purchasing the house. These include the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The brokerage fee is calculated as 5% of the selling price, which is $350,000. So, 5% of $350,000 is $17,500.

Similarly, the transfer fee is 12% of the selling price. Calculating 12% of $350,000 gives $42,000.

Adding these two amounts together, the total additional costs are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500.

Next, I need to find out how much more this exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000. Subtracting the additional costs from the budget: $400,000 - $59,500 = $340,500.

Therefore, the total price of the house is $340,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

To determine how much more the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Brokerage Fee:**
   
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \times \$350,\!000 = 0.05 \times 350,\!000 = \$17,\!500
   \]

2. **Calculate the Transfer Fee:**
   
   The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \times \$350,\!000 = 0.12 \times 350,\!000 = \$42,\!000
   \]

3. **Determine the Total Additional Costs:**
   
   Add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Additional Costs} = \$17,\!500 + \$42,\!000 = \$59,\!500
   \]

4. **Find the Excess Over the Budget:**
   
   Subtract the total additional costs from Mrs. Cruz's budget.
   
   \[
   \text{Excess} = \$400,\!000 - \$59,\!500 = \$340,\!500
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$340,\!500}
\]
