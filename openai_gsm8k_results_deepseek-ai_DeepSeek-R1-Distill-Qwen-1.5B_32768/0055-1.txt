Question:
Carolyn works for a delivery service company that hires on a contract basis. In May, they hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.

Correct Answer:
When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000
#### 168000

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the total number of employees in June. Since 1/4 of the 40 employees' contracts expired, that means 10 employees left the company.

Next, I'll determine how many hours each employee was paid in May. Each employee worked 40 hours a week at $15 per hour, totaling $600 per week.

Then, I'll calculate the total expenses for May by multiplying the number of employees by the weekly salary: 40 employees × $600 = $24,000.

In June, the remaining 30 employees continued working. Each employee still earned $600 per week, so the expenses for June would be 30 employees × $600 = $18,000.

Finally, I'll add the expenses from May and June to find the total amount paid to employees over the two months: $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total amount of money Carolyn's delivery service company paid to employees in May and June.

### **Step 1: Understand the Information**

- **May:**
  - **Number of employees hired:** 40
  - **Hourly wage per employee:** \$15 per hour
  - **Workweek:** 40 hours

- **June:**
  - **1/4 of the employees' contracts expired:** 
    - **Number of employees who left:** \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) employees
  - **Remaining employees:** \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) employees

### **Step 2: Calculate Monthly Expenses**

#### **May's Expenses**

1. **Total Hours Worked by All Employees in May:**
   - Each employee worked 40 hours.
   - Total hours = \( 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours} = 1,600 \text{ hours} \)
   
2. **Total Earnings for May:**
   - Hourly wage = \$15
   - Total earnings = \( 1,600 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$24,000 \)

#### **June's Expenses**

1. **Total Hours Worked by Remaining Employees in June:**
   - Remaining employees = 30
   - Total hours = \( 30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours} = 1,200 \text{ hours} \)
   
2. **Total Earnings for June:**
   - Hourly wage = \$15
   - Total earnings = \( 1,200 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$18,000 \)

### **Step 3: Calculate Total Expenses Over Two Months**

1. **Total May Expenses:** \$24,000
2. **Total June Expenses:** \$18,000
3. **Total Expenses for Two Months:** 
   
   \[
   \$24,000 + \$18,000 = \$42,000
   \]

### **Final Answer**

The total amount of money Carolyn's company paid to the employees in May and June is:

\[
\boxed{42000}
\]
