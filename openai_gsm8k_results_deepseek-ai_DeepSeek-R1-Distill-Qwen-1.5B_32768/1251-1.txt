Question:
Trinity sells magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought the magazines. If she bought the magazines at $72, what is her profit?

Correct Answer:
Trinity sells magazines at 11/8*$72=$<<11/8*72=99>>99.
If she bought the magazines at $72, she makes a profit of $99-$72=$27
#### 27

Gold:
27

Wrong Prediction:
Profit=99x-72

Wrong Answer:
To determine Trinity's profit, I need to calculate her total revenue from selling the magazines and then subtract her cost of purchasing them.

First, I'll find the selling price by multiplying the purchase price of $72 by the profit margin of 11/8. This will give me the amount she receives for each magazine.

Next, I'll calculate the total revenue by multiplying the selling price by the number of magazines she sells. Since the exact number isn't provided, I'll represent it with a variable, such as 'x'.

Finally, I'll subtract the total cost of purchasing the magazines (which is 8/8 of $72) from the total revenue to find her profit.

To determine Trinity's profit, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Selling Price per Magazine:**

   Trinity sells magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them. If she bought them for \$72, the selling price \( P \) is:

   \[
   P = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{792}{8} = 99
   \]

   So, she sells each magazine for \$99.

2. **Determine the Total Cost:**

   The total cost \( C \) is the amount she spent to buy the magazines:

   \[
   C = \frac{8}{8} \times 72 = 72
   \]

3. **Calculate the Profit:**

   Profit \( \text{Profit} \) is the total revenue minus the total cost. Assuming she sells \( x \) magazines:

   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = P \times x = 99x
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - C = 99x - 72
   \]

   If the number of magazines sold is known, you can substitute \( x \) to find the exact profit.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\text{Profit} = 99x - 72}
\]
