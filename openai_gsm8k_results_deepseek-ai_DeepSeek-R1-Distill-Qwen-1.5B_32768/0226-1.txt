Question:
Mark is a copy-editor. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?

Correct Answer:
Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.
From Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<5*500=2500>>2500 cents.
Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.
Thus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.
#### 7500

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the weekly earnings for Publisher B. Since Mark earns 5 cents per sentence and edits 500 sentences per week, Publisher B pays twice that amount per sentence, totaling 10 cents per sentence.

Next, calculate the total earnings for both publishers. Publisher A earns 500 sentences × 5 cents = 2500 cents. Publisher B earns 500 sentences × 10 cents = 5000 cents.

Finally, add both amounts to find Mark's total weekly earnings: 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

To determine how much Mark earns in a week, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Earnings from Publisher A:**
   - **Number of sentences edited per week:** Let's denote this as \( S \).
   - **Payment per sentence by Publisher A:** 5 cents.
   - **Total earnings from Publisher A:** \( S \times 5 \) cents.

2. **Earnings from Publisher B:**
   - **Payment per sentence by Publisher B:** It is given that Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays per sentence. Therefore, the payment per sentence by Publisher B is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) cents.
   - **Total earnings from Publisher B:** \( S \times 10 \) cents.

3. **Total Weekly Earnings:**
   - **Total earnings = Earnings from Publisher A + Earnings from Publisher B**
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = S \times 5 + S \times 10 = 15S \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Determine the value of \( S \):**
   - **Total sentences edited per week:** Since Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, we have \( S = 1000 \).

5. **Calculate the Total Earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = 15 \times 1000 = 15,000 \text{ cents}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{15000}
\]
