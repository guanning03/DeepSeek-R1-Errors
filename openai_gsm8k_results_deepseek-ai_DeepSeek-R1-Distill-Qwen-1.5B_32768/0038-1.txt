Question:
Robyn sends sixteen emails a day. Seven are work emails, and two-thirds of the remainder are to family. One-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. How many emails a day does she send to her boyfriend?

Correct Answer:
Robyn sends 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 non-work emails.
She sends 9 * 2 / 3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 emails to family.
There are 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 emails remaining.
Of the remaining 3, 1/3 are to her boyfriend, so Robyn sends him 3 * 1 / 3 = <<3*1/3=1>>1 email a day.

Wrong Answer:
First, Robyn sends a total of 16 emails daily.

Out of these, 7 are work emails. This leaves 16 - 7 = 9 emails that are not work emails.

Two-thirds of these remaining emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is (2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

This means the remaining emails, which are 9 - 6 = 3 emails, are sent to her boyfriend.

Therefore, Robyn sends 3 emails to her boyfriend each day.
