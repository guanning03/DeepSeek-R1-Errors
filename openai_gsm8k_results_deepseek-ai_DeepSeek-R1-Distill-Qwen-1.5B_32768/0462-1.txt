Question:
Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. She painted them and sold them at a craft fair for $8 each. How much profit did she earn on her bags?

Correct Answer:
The total number of bags is 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40
The cost of the 40 bags is 40*4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Tara sold the 40 bags at 8 each earning her 40*8 = <<40*8=320>>320
Her profit was 320-160 = <<320-160=160>>160

Wrong Prediction:
288

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara purchased. She bought 8 packs, each containing 5 canvas bags, at a price of $4 each.

Next, I'll determine the total revenue from selling the canvas bags at the craft fair. She sold each bag for $8.

Finally, I'll subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find out how much profit Tara earned.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Cost:**

   Tara bought 8 packs of canvas bags, with each pack containing 5 bags. Each pack costs \$4.

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Packs} \times \text{Cost per Pack} = 8 \times \$4 = \$32
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**

   Tara sold each canvas bag for \$8. Assuming she sold all 8 packs, the total number of bags sold is:

   \[
   \text{Total Bags Sold} = 8 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ bags/pack} = 40 \text{ bags}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Bags Sold} \times \text{Selling Price per Bag} = 40 \times \$8 = \$320
   \]

3. **Determine the Profit:**

   Profit is calculated as the difference between the total revenue and the total cost.

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$320 - \$32 = \$288
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{288}
\]
