Question:
James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  He swims 60% of the distance.  After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  How long did it take him to get across the lake?

Correct Answer:
He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.
That took him 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 hours.
So he rested 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours.
He then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.
His pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.
So it took him 8/1=<<8/1=8>>8 hours.
So in total, he took 6+3+8=<<6+3+8=17>>17 hours.

Wrong Answer:
To determine the total time James took to swim across the lake, I need to break down the problem into parts.

First, I'll calculate the total distance James needs to swim, which is 20 miles.

Next, I'll determine how much of this distance he swam initially. He swam 60% of the total distance:
0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles.

He swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour, so the time taken to swim 12 miles is:
Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, he rests for half as long as the swimming time. Therefore, the resting time is:
0.5 * 6 hours = 3 hours.

He then swims the remaining distance on an island. The remaining distance is:
20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

However, he swims at half the original speed, which is 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is:
Time = 8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours.

Finally, I'll add up all the times:
Swimming initial part: 6 hours
Resting: 3 hours
Swimming final part: 8 hours
Total time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how long James took to swim across the lake.

**1. Total Distance to Swim:**
James needs to swim across a 20-mile lake.

**2. Initial Swimming Distance:**
James swims 60% of the total distance.
\[
\text{Initial Swimming Distance} = 0.60 \times 20 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles}
\]

**3. Time to Swim the Initial Distance:**
James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ mph}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

**4. Resting Time:**
James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
\[
\text{Resting Time} = 0.5 \times 6 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

**5. Remaining Distance and Swimming Speed:**
After resting, James swims the remaining distance on an island at half the original speed.
\[
\text{Remaining Distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
\]
\[
\text{Swimming Speed} = \frac{2 \text{ mph}}{2} = 1 \text{ mph}
\]
\[
\text{Time to Swim Remaining Distance} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mph}} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

**6. Total Time Taken:**
\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time for Initial Swimming} + \text{Resting Time} + \text{Time for Remaining Swimming}
\]
\[
\text{Total Time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
\]

\[
\boxed{17\ \text{hours}}
\]
