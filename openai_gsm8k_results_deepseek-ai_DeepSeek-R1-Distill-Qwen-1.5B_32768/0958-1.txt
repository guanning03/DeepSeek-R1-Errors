Question:
Sarahâ€™s basketball games are 4 quarters that are each 12 minutes long. In the last quarter, there was a tie so the game was extended for five minutes. How long did the entire game last?

Correct Answer:
The four quarters lasted for 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 minutes.
The total time of the game for the entire game was 48 + 5 = <<48+5=53>>53 minutes.
#### 53

Gold:
53

Wrong Prediction:
41

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total time of the first three quarters. Each quarter is 12 minutes long, so three quarters would be 12 minutes multiplied by 3, which equals 36 minutes.

Next, I'll add the tiebreaker in the last quarter. The game was extended for an additional 5 minutes.

Finally, I'll sum the time of the first three quarters and the tiebreaker to find the total duration of the game.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the time for the first three quarters:**
   \[
   3 \text{ quarters} \times 12 \text{ minutes per quarter} = 36 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Add the tiebreaker time in the last quarter:**
   \[
   36 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 41 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{41 \text{ minutes}}
\]
