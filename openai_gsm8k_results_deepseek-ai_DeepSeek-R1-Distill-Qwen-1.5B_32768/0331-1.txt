Question:
Chase and Rider can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days; but on two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. How many times do they ride their bikes a week?

Correct Answer:
Each person rides his bike 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 times for 5 days.
Together, they ride 15+15 = <<15+15=30>>30 times for five days.
Each person rides his bike 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 times for every day of the other two days.
This means each person rides 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 times on each day of the other two days.
The total for the other two days is 12+12 = <<12+12=24>>24
For the whole week the together ride 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 times

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many days Chase and Rider ride their bikes. They ride three times a day for five days, so that's 5 multiplied by 3, which equals 15 days.

Next, there are two other days where they ride twice the usual number of times. Each of these days is 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6 days.

Finally, to find the total number of biking days in a week, I add the usual days and the doubled days together: 15 plus 6 equals 21 days.

To determine how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, let's break down the information step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Usual Rides
- **Usual Days:** 5 days
- **Rides per Day:** 3 times

\[
\text{Usual Rides} = 5 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ times/day} = 15 \text{ rides}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Doubled Rides
- **Extra Days:** 2 days
- **Rides per Double Day:** \(2 \times 3 = 6\) times/day

\[
\text{Doubled Rides} = 2 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ times/day} = 12 \text{ rides}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Weekly Rides
\[
\text{Total Weekly Rides} = \text{Usual Rides} + \text{Doubled Rides} = 15 + 12 = 27 \text{ rides}
\]

\[
\boxed{27}
\]
