Question:
Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the following year he starts buying 2 games a month.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?

Correct Answer:
Steve buys 1 game a month his first year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*1=<<1*12=12>>12 games
Steve then buys 2 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*2=<<2*12=24>>24 games
Steve then buys 4 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*4=<<4*12=48>>48 games
Steve also gets 5 games for Christmas each year for three years, for another 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 games.
In total over three years, Steve gets 12+24+48+15=<<12+24+48+15=99>>99 games
Since Steve started with 5 games, he has 5+99=<<5+99=104>>104 games after 3 years
#### 104

Wrong Answer:
First, Steve receives 5 games on his birthday each year, totaling 5 games per year.

Next, he buys 1 game per month for the first year. There are 12 months in a year, so he spends 12 games during this period.

In the second year, he increases his purchase to 2 games per month, which amounts to 24 games.

For the third year, he buys 4 games a month, resulting in 48 games.

Additionally, Steve receives 5 games at each Christmas, adding another 15 games over the three years.

Finally, we add up all the games Steve has: 5 (birthday) + 12 (first year) + 24 (second year) + 48 (third year) + 15 (Christmas) = 104 games in total after three years.

Let's break down Steve's game purchases year by year to determine the total number of games he has after 3 years.

### Year 1:
- **Birthday Gift:** 5 games
- **Monthly Purchase:** 1 game per month for 12 months
  - Total games bought: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games

**Total Games after Year 1:**
\[ 5 + 12 = 17 \text{ games} \]

### Year 2:
- **Monthly Purchase:** 2 games per month for 12 months
  - Total games bought: \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games

**Total Games after Year 2:**
\[ 17 + 24 = 41 \text{ games} \]

### Year 3:
- **Monthly Purchase:** 4 games per month for 12 months
  - Total games bought: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games
- **Christmas Gifts:** 5 games
  - Total Christmas games: 5

**Total Games after Year 3:**
\[ 41 + 48 + 5 = 94 \text{ games} \]

### Final Answer:
\[\boxed{94}\]
