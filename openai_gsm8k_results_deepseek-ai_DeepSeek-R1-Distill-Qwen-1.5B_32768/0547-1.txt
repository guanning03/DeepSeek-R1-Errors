Question:
In the first half of a soccer match, team A scores 4 goals while team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. What's the total number of goals scored in the match?

Correct Answer:
In the first half, team B scores 4 goals - 2 goals = <<4-2=2>>2 goals.
The total number of goals scored in the first half is 2 goals + 4 goals = <<2+4=6>>6 goals
During the second half, team B scores 4 goals * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 goals.
Team A 1/4 * 8 goals = <<1/4*8=2>>2 goals in the second half.
The total number of goals in the second half is 8 goals + 2 goals = <<8+2=10>>10 goals
The total number of goals in the match is 6 goals + 10 goals = <<6+10=16>>16 goals

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine the number of goals scored by team A in the first half. Team A scored 4 goals in the first half.

Since team B scored 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, team B scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

Next, in the second half, team A scored one-fourth of the goals team B scored in the first half, which is 2 / 4 = 0.5 goals.

Additionally, team B scored 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half.

Finally, to find the total number of goals scored in the entire match, I'll add up all the goals: team A scored 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 goals, and team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals. Therefore, the total number of goals is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5.

To determine the total number of goals scored in the soccer match, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **First Half:**
   - **Team A:** Scores 4 goals.
   - **Team B:** Scores 2 goals fewer than Team A.
     \[
     \text{Team B's goals in the first half} = 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ goals}
     \]

2. **Second Half:**
   - **Team A:** Scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the goals scored by Team B in the first half.
     \[
     \text{Team A's goals in the second half} = \frac{1}{4} \times 2 = 0.5 \text{ goals}
     \]
   - **Team B:** Scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half.
     \[
     \text{Team B's goals in the second half} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ goals}
     \]

3. **Total Goals in the Match:**
   - **Team A's total goals:**
     \[
     4 \text{ (first half)} + 0.5 \text{ (second half)} = 4.5 \text{ goals}
     \]
   - **Team B's total goals:**
     \[
     2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10 \text{ goals}
     \]
   - **Overall Total:**
     \[
     4.5 \text{ (Team A)} + 10 \text{ (Team B)} = 14.5 \text{ goals}
     \]

\[
\boxed{14.5}
\]
