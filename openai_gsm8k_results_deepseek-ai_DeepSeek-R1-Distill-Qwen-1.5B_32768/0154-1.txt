Question:
Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. How high is the roof from the second floor's floor in inches?

Correct Answer:
Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.
#### 240

Wrong Answer:
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how high the roof is from the second floor's floor. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. So, if Mattison's height is 60 inches, then the height of the house would be 7 multiplied by 60 inches. Let me write that down:

Height of the house = 7 * 60 inches.

Let me calculate that. 7 times 60 is... 420. So, the two-story house is 420 inches tall. Got that.

Now, the problem mentions the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is three times as high as Mattison's height. Wait, so Mattison's height is 60 inches, so three times that would be... 3 * 60 inches. Let me do that:

Height of first floor ceiling = 3 * 60 inches = 180 inches.

Hmm, so the first floor ceiling is 180 inches above the ground. That must mean the first floor itself is 180 inches tall? Or is it the ceiling? Hmm, I think it's the ceiling because the floor to ceiling height is the distance from the floor to the ceiling. So, the first floor ceiling is 180 inches high from the ground.

Wait, actually, Mattison is 60 inches tall, so his height is 60 inches. So, the first floor ceiling is three times that. So, 180 inches. So, the first floor ceiling is 180 inches from the ground. So, the ceiling is 180 inches above the ground, meaning the first floor is 180 inches tall? Because Mattison is 60 inches, so the first floor would be Mattison's height plus the space between the floor and ceiling. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says the floor to ceiling height on the first floor is three times as high as Mattison's height. So, Mattison's height is 60 inches, so the first floor ceiling is 3 * 60 = 180 inches. So, the ceiling is 180 inches above the ground. So, the first floor is 180 inches high. Hmm, but Mattison is 60 inches tall, so the first floor is the same as Mattison's height. So, the first floor is 180 inches tall, which is three times Mattison's height.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me read the problem again:

"Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. How high is the roof from the second floor's floor in inches?"

So, Mattison's height is 60 inches.

The house is 7 times his height: 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The first floor ceiling is 3 times Mattison's height: 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

So, the first floor ceiling is 180 inches high. So, the first floor is 180 inches tall, but Mattison is 60 inches. So, that means the first floor is 180 inches tall, which is 3 times Mattison's height. So, the first floor is taller than Mattison by 120 inches (3*60 - 60 = 120 inches). But I don't know if that's relevant.

Wait, no. The first floor's ceiling is 180 inches. So, from the ground to the ceiling of the first floor is 180 inches. So, the first floor itself is 180 inches tall. Then, the second floor is on top of the first floor. The question is asking for the height of the roof from the second floor's floor to the top of the house.

So, let me visualize the house. It's two-story. So, the ground floor is the first floor, and the second floor is above it. The first floor goes up to 180 inches. Then, the second floor is above that. The roof is on top of the second floor. So, the total height of the house is 420 inches, as calculated earlier.

So, the first floor is 180 inches. Then, the second floor must be... Let me see. The entire house is 420 inches. The first floor goes up to 180 inches. So, the remaining height from the first floor to the roof would be 420 - 180 = 240 inches. That's from the first floor to the top of the house.

But wait, the roof is on the second floor. So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof would be the height from the first floor's ceiling to the roof minus the height of the first floor.

So, the total height from first floor to roof is 240 inches. The first floor is 180 inches. So, the second floor is 180 inches (first floor height) plus the height of the first floor. Wait, no.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to draw a diagram in my mind.

Ground floor: 0 inches.

First floor: height from ground to ceiling is 180 inches.

So, the first floor starts at 0 and ends at 180 inches.

Then, the second floor is placed above the first floor. But how high is the second floor?

Wait, the question is asking for the height of the roof from the second floor's floor to the top of the house.

So, the second floor's floor is above the first floor's ceiling. So, the height from the first floor's ceiling to the roof is 240 inches.

So, if the first floor is 180 inches, then the second floor must be 180 inches plus the height of the first floor. Wait, but Mattison's height is 60 inches. Wait, maybe I need to think about the floor to ceiling height of the first floor.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see.

If the house is 420 inches tall, and the first floor ceiling is 180 inches, then the second floor's floor is somewhere below that. The total height from the ground to the roof is 420 inches.

So, if the first floor goes up to 180 inches, then the second floor must be 180 inches plus the height of the first floor. But wait, the height of the first floor is 180 inches. So, the second floor is 180 + 180 = 360 inches? But that would make the total height 360 inches, which is less than the house's total height of 420 inches. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. Maybe the first floor is 180 inches, which is Mattison's height. So, Mattison is 60 inches. So, the first floor is 180 inches, which is 3 times Mattison's height. So, the first floor is 180 inches tall.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of floor heights.

The house is made up of two floors. The first floor goes up to 180 inches, and the second floor goes up from 180 inches to... Hmm, the question is asking for how high the roof is from the second floor's floor to the top of the house. So, the total height of the house is 420 inches. The first floor is 180 inches, so the roof is 420 - 180 = 240 inches above the ground.

But the roof is on the second floor. So, the second floor's floor is at some point above the first floor. So, if the first floor goes up to 180 inches, then the second floor is somewhere above that.

Let me think of it as two floors: the first floor from 0 to 180 inches, and the second floor from 180 inches up to... Let's call the height of the second floor h. Then, the roof is h + 240 inches?

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the total height is 420 inches. So, if the first floor is 180 inches, then the roof is 420 - 180 = 240 inches above the ground. But the roof is on the second floor, so the second floor must be at 180 inches plus the height of the first floor.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe another way. Let's denote the height of the first floor as F1 and the height of the second floor as F2. The total height of the house is F1 + F2 + R, where R is the roof height from the second floor's floor to the top.

But we don't know R, which is what we need to find.

Wait, but the problem says: "How high is the roof from the second floor's floor in inches?"

So, that's the height from the second floor's floor to the top of the house. So, if the second floor's floor is at height F1, then the roof is at height F1 + F2 + R. But that might not be helpful.

Wait, no. The second floor's floor is at F1, and the roof is on top of the second floor. So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is (Total house height) - F1.

So, the total height is 420 inches. The second floor's floor is at F1. So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 420 - F1. But wait, that would be the height from the second floor's floor (which is F1) to the top, which is 420 inches. So, 420 - F1.

But we need to find that value.

But we don't know F1 yet, which is the height of the first floor. Wait, but it's given that the floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice Mattison's height.

So, the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches. So, the floor to ceiling height is 180 inches. So, the floor (ground) to first floor is 0 inches, and the ceiling is 180 inches.

But then, is the height of the first floor 180 inches? Or is it 180 inches from the floor to the ceiling?

Wait, no, the floor to ceiling height is 180 inches, meaning that the height from the floor to the ceiling is 180 inches. So, the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches above the ground. Then, the first floor itself is Mattison's height, which is 60 inches. So, the first floor is 60 inches tall, and the ceiling is 180 inches above the ground.

Wait, but that seems contradictory because the ceiling height is 180 inches, but the floor to ceiling height is 180 inches. So, the floor is at 0 inches, the ceiling is at 180 inches, so the first floor is 60 inches tall. So, the first floor is 60 inches tall, and the ceiling is 180 inches above the ground. So, that makes the first floor's ceiling at 180 inches.

So, the first floor is from 0 to 60 inches? Wait, no. Wait, no, the floor to ceiling height is 180 inches, so the floor is at 0 inches, and the ceiling is at 180 inches.

So, the first floor must be 60 inches tall, so it goes from 0 to 60 inches, and the ceiling is at 180 inches. That seems possible.

Then, the second floor is on top of the first floor. So, the second floor starts at 60 inches and goes up to... Let's say the second floor is F2 inches tall, so it goes from 60 inches to 60 + F2 inches. Then, the roof is on top of the second floor, so it goes from 60 + F2 inches to 60 + F2 + R, where R is the roof height.

But the total height of the house is 420 inches, so 60 + F2 + R = 420 inches.

So, we have 60 + F2 + R = 420, so F2 + R = 360 inches.

But we need to find R, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof. The second floor's floor is at 60 inches, so R = 360 - F2 inches.

But we don't know F2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe we can find F2 from the given information.

Wait, the problem says the floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height. So, that's 3 * 60 = 180 inches, which is the ceiling height. So, the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches. So, the first floor itself is 60 inches tall, and the ceiling is 180 inches above the ground.

But then, the second floor is on top of the first floor. So, the first floor ends at 60 inches, and the second floor starts at 60 inches.

But how tall is the second floor?

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the height of the second floor. It only specifies the height of the first floor's ceiling and the total height of the house.

So, perhaps we can assume that the second floor is the same height as the first floor? Or maybe the second floor is just on top of the first floor, so it's 0 inches? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the second floor is the same height as the first floor.

But if that's the case, the first floor is 60 inches, the ceiling is 180 inches, so the second floor starts at 60 inches, and the ceiling is 180 inches, so the second floor is 120 inches tall. So, the second floor is 120 inches, and the roof is 420 - 180 = 240 inches. But that doesn't make sense because 180 + 120 + R = 420, so R = 120 inches. But 180 + 120 is 300, so R would be 120 inches. But the problem is asking for the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, which is 240 inches.

Wait, that seems too big. Because the second floor is 120 inches, so the roof is 120 inches above the second floor's floor.

Wait, but the second floor's floor is at 60 inches, so the roof is at 60 + 120 + R = 420. So, 180 + R = 420, so R = 240 inches. So, the roof is 240 inches above the second floor's floor, which is at 60 inches.

So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 240 inches. So, is that the answer? 240 inches.

Wait, but let me confirm. The first floor is 60 inches, ceiling is 180 inches. Then, the second floor is 120 inches, so 60 + 120 = 180 inches. Then, the roof is 180 + 240 = 420 inches, which is the total height. So, yes, that seems to add up.

But wait, the problem says the floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height. So, that's 180 inches, which is correct. The house is 420 inches tall, so the first floor is 60 inches, ceiling is 180 inches.

Then, the second floor is 120 inches tall, so the roof is 240 inches above the second floor's floor. So, that seems to add up.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think.

Total height of the house: 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

First floor ceiling: 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

So, first floor is 60 inches tall, ceiling at 180 inches.

Then, the remaining height is 420 - 180 = 240 inches, which is the height from the first floor's ceiling to the roof.

But the roof is on the second floor, so the second floor's floor is above the first floor's ceiling.

Wait, so the first floor is 180 inches tall, so the first floor's ceiling is at 180 inches. Then, the second floor's floor is somewhere above that.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the height from the second floor's floor to the roof.

So, the total height is 420 inches.

If the first floor is 180 inches, then the roof is 420 - 180 = 240 inches above the first floor's ceiling.

Wait, no. The roof is on the second floor, so the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches above the ground, and the roof is on the second floor, which is above the first floor.

Wait, perhaps the total height from the ground to the roof is 420 inches. The first floor's ceiling is at 180 inches, so the roof is 420 - 180 = 240 inches above the ground. But that can't be, because the roof is on the second floor.

Wait, no. Let me think of it as the house has two floors. The first floor's ceiling is 180 inches tall. Then, the second floor is on top of the first floor, so the second floor's floor is at some point above the first floor's ceiling.

Wait, no. The first floor is 60 inches tall, so it goes from the ground to 60 inches. The ceiling is at 180 inches, which is 120 inches above the first floor's ceiling. So, the second floor is 120 inches tall? Or maybe not.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to draw it.

Let me denote:

Ground: 0 inches.

First floor: 60 inches tall, so it goes up to 60 inches.

Ceiling of first floor: 180 inches (3 * 60).

So, the first floor is 60 inches tall, from 0 to 60 inches.

Then, the second floor starts at 60 inches and goes up to... Let's say the second floor is F2 inches tall, so it goes from 60 to 60 + F2 inches.

Then, the roof is on the second floor, so it goes from 60 + F2 inches to 60 + F2 + R inches, where R is the roof height.

But the total height of the house is 420 inches, so 60 + F2 + R = 420.

But the problem doesn't give us the height of the second floor, F2.

Wait, but the problem says the floor to ceiling height on the first floor is 180 inches, which is the ceiling. So, the first floor is 60 inches tall, starting at 0 inches, ending at 60 inches. So, the second floor starts at 60 inches, and is F2 inches tall, ending at 60 + F2 inches.

Then, the roof is on the second floor, so it starts at 60 + F2 inches and goes up to 60 + F2 + R inches. But the total height of the house is 420 inches, so 60 + F2 + R = 420. Therefore, F2 + R = 360 inches.

But we need to find R, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof. The second floor's floor is at 60 + F2 inches, so the height from that to the roof is R inches. So, R = 420 - (60 + F2) inches.

But we have F2 + R = 360 inches. So, substituting R = 360 - F2 inches into the equation, we get:

R = 420 - 60 - F2 = 360 - F2 inches. So, that checks out. So, R is 360 - F2 inches.

But we don't know F2. Hmm.

Wait, is there any other information given? The problem only says the first floor's ceiling is thrice Mattison's height, which is 180 inches, and the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 420 inches.

Wait, perhaps the second floor's height is the same as the first floor? Or maybe the second floor is the same as the first floor. But that may not necessarily be the case.

Wait, maybe the second floor is the same height as the first floor, so 60 inches. Then, R would be 360 - 60 = 300 inches. But that seems too large.

Alternatively, perhaps the second floor is twice the height of the first floor.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is only about the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, which is R. And we have R = 360 - F2 inches. But since we don't know F2, maybe we can find F2 from another way.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches, which is the first floor's height. So, the first floor is 60 inches tall, from 0 to 60 inches. So, the second floor's starting point is 60 inches. Then, the second floor's ceiling is at 60 + F2 inches.

But the problem doesn't specify how high the second floor is. So, maybe the house is only two floors, each 60 inches? But that would make the second floor's ceiling at 120 inches, but then the total height would be 180 inches, which is less than 420 inches.

Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me read the problem again:

"Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. How high is the roof from the second floor's floor in inches?"

So, the first floor's ceiling is thrice Mattison's height, which is 180 inches. So, the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches. So, the first floor is 60 inches tall, from ground to ceiling. So, the second floor is above the first floor.

So, the second floor is F2 inches tall. So, the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches. So, the second floor is at 180 inches, starting at 180 inches? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. If the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches, then the first floor is from 0 to 60 inches, and the ceiling is at 180 inches. So, the second floor is above 180 inches. So, the second floor starts at 180 inches and goes up to 180 + F2 inches.

Then, the roof is on the second floor, so it goes from 180 + F2 inches to 180 + F2 + R inches. The total height of the house is 420 inches, so 180 + F2 + R = 420. So, F2 + R = 240 inches.

But we need to find R, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, which is R inches. So, R = 240 - F2 inches.

But we don't know F2. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any other information about the second floor. Maybe it's assumed that the second floor is the same height as the first floor. If that's the case, then F2 = 60 inches, so R = 240 - 60 = 180 inches.

But that seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.

Alternatively, if the second floor is taller, then R would be less. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we can assume that the second floor is the same height as the first floor.

Wait, but in that case, the total height would be 60 + 60 + R = 120 + R = 420, so R = 300 inches, which seems too high.

Wait, but that would mean the second floor is 60 inches, same as the first floor, which is 60 inches. So, the ceiling of the first floor is 180 inches, and the ceiling of the second floor is 180 + 60 = 240 inches.

Then, the roof is on the second floor, so it starts at 240 inches and goes up to 240 + R inches, which is 420 inches. So, R = 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 180 inches. Hmm, that seems reasonable.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify that the second floor is the same height as the first floor. So, maybe the second floor is taller or shorter.

Wait, perhaps it's implied that the second floor is the same height as the first floor? Or maybe it's the same as the ceiling of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

Wait, the problem says the floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height. So, it's thrice 60 inches, which is 180 inches. So, that's the ceiling height.

So, the first floor is 60 inches tall, and the ceiling is 180 inches above the ground.

Then, the second floor is on top of the first floor.

Wait, no, the first floor is 60 inches tall, so it's 60 inches from the ground to the ceiling.

Then, the second floor is somewhere above that.

Wait, no, the problem says the floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, so that's 180 inches.

So, the first floor is 60 inches tall, from ground to ceiling. Then, the second floor is a second floor. So, the second floor's floor is at 60 inches, and it's F2 inches tall, so it goes up to 60 + F2 inches.

Then, the roof is on the second floor. So, if the second floor's ceiling is at 60 + F2 inches, then the roof is at 60 + F2 + R inches, which is the total height of the house, 420 inches.

So, 60 + F2 + R = 420.

So, F2 + R = 360 inches.

But we need to find R, which is the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, which is R inches. So, R = 360 - F2 inches.

But we don't know F2. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe the second floor is the same height as the first floor, so F2 = 60 inches. Then, R = 360 - 60 = 300 inches. But that seems too high, as before.

Alternatively, maybe the second floor is the same height as the ceiling of the first floor, so 180 inches. Then, R = 360 - 180 = 180 inches, which is the same as the first floor's ceiling. That seems possible.

But the problem doesn't specify that.

Wait, maybe another approach: the height of the second floor is equal to the height of the first floor ceiling. So, 180 inches.

So, first floor: 60 inches.

Second floor: 180 inches.

Then, the roof is on the second floor, so the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is R = 420 - (60 + 180) = 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

So, R is 180 inches. So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 180 inches.

But is that the case? Is the second floor the same height as the first floor's ceiling?

Alternatively, maybe the second floor is the same as the first floor, so 60 inches. Then, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 180 inches.

But then, the roof is 180 inches above the second floor's floor.

Wait, that seems possible.

But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is the same as the first floor's ceiling. So, 180 inches.

So, 180 inches is the height from the second floor's floor to the roof.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to calculate it step by step.

So, ground: 0 inches.

First floor: 0 to 60 inches.

Ceiling of first floor: 180 inches.

Second floor: starts at 180 inches.

Second floor: F2 inches.

So, second floor goes from 180 inches to 180 + F2 inches.

Roof: starts at 180 + F2 inches, goes up to 180 + F2 + R inches, which is 420 inches.

So, 180 + F2 + R = 420 inches.

So, F2 + R = 240 inches.

But we need to find R.

But we don't know F2.

Wait, is there a way to find F2? The problem doesn't specify. It only mentions the height of the first floor's ceiling is thrice Mattison's height.

So, that's 180 inches.

But the second floor's height isn't given. So, maybe the problem assumes that the second floor is the same height as the first floor, so 60 inches.

So, F2 = 60 inches.

Then, R = 240 - 60 = 180 inches.

So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 180 inches.

Alternatively, maybe the second floor is the same as the ceiling of the first floor, so 180 inches.

So, F2 = 180 inches.

Then, R = 240 - 180 = 60 inches.

But that seems less likely.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about the second floor, so maybe it's just 60 inches.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, which is R.

But if we don't know F2, we can't find R. So, maybe we need to express R in terms of F2.

But the problem doesn't give us F2, so maybe it's just 180 inches.

Wait, but 180 inches is the ceiling of the first floor.

Wait, no, the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches, which is the top of the first floor.

Then, the second floor is on top of the first floor.

Wait, maybe I need to think of the house as two floors, each floor being 60 inches tall, making the total height 120 inches, but that's not matching the given info.

Wait, no, the house is two-story, so two floors. But it's 7 times Mattison's height, which is 420 inches.

Wait, wait, no, the house is two stories, so 7 times Mattison's height is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

So, the house is two stories, each story is 210 inches? Wait, no, 420 is the total height.

Wait, no, 7 times Mattison's height, which is 60 inches, is 420 inches. So, 420 inches is the total height.

So, two stories, each story is 210 inches, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the two-story house has a floor-to-ceiling height of 7 times Mattison's height, which is 420 inches. So, the total height is 420 inches.

Wait, no, the problem says: "His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is."

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to write down the given information:

- Mattison's height: 60 inches.

- House height: 7 * Mattison's height = 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

- First floor's ceiling height: thrice Mattison's height = 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

- Second floor's floor is above the first floor's ceiling.

- We need to find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof.

So, first, first floor's ceiling is 180 inches.

So, the first floor is 60 inches tall (from ground to ceiling), so it spans from 0 to 60 inches.

So, the first floor's ceiling is at 180 inches, so the first floor must be 60 inches tall, starting at 0 inches, so ending at 60 inches.

So, the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches.

So, the second floor starts at 180 inches.

Then, the second floor's ceiling is at 180 + F2 inches.

But the total house height is 420 inches, so:

180 + F2 + R = 420

So, F2 + R = 240.

But we need to find R, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof.

So, if the second floor's floor is at 180 inches, and the roof is at 180 + F2 + R inches.

Wait, no, if the ceiling of the second floor is at 180 + F2 inches, then the roof is at 180 + F2 + R inches, which is 420 inches.

So, 180 + F2 + R = 420

So, F2 + R = 240

But we don't know F2, so we can't find R.

Wait, unless F2 is equal to something else.

Wait, maybe the second floor is a single story? No, it's a two-story house.

Wait, maybe the second floor's height is the same as the first floor's ceiling, so 180 inches.

So, F2 = 180 inches.

Then, R = 240 - 180 = 60 inches.

So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 60 inches.

Alternatively, if F2 is 60 inches, R = 180 inches.

But which one is it? The problem doesn't specify.

Wait, maybe the second floor's height is the same as the first floor's ceiling, so 180 inches.

So, F2 = 180 inches.

Then, the second floor's ceiling is at 180 + 180 = 360 inches.

Then, the roof is at 360 + R = 420 inches.

So, R = 60 inches.

Therefore, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 60 inches.

Wait, that seems more reasonable because the house is two stories, each story being 210 inches? No, wait, the house is two stories, each floor is 60 inches, so 60 + 60 = 120 inches. But 420 inches is the total height.

Wait, no, the house is two stories, each story is a floor, but each floor is 60 inches. So, 60 + 60 = 120 inches. But that's not matching the given info.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused again.

Wait, the house is two-story, so two floors.

First floor: 60 inches.

Ceiling of first floor: 180 inches.

Second floor: F2 inches.

Roof: R inches.

Total height: 60 + F2 + R = 420 inches.

But the problem says, "the floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height."

So, 3 * 60 = 180 inches, which is the ceiling height, so that's correct.

But we don't know F2.

Wait, unless the second floor is the same as the ceiling of the first floor, so F2 = 180 inches.

So, 180 + R = 420 - 60 = 360 inches.

Wait, 420 - 60 = 360 inches. So, 180 + R = 360 inches.

So, R = 180 inches. So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 180 inches.

Wait, that seems correct.

So, step by step:

- First floor: 60 inches, ceiling at 180 inches.

- Second floor: F2 inches, so from 180 inches to 180 + F2 inches.

- Roof: R inches, so from 180 + F2 inches to 180 + F2 + R inches.

Total height: 420 inches, so 180 + F2 + R = 420.

But we don't know F2, but the problem doesn't specify it, so maybe it's the same as the ceiling of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

So, F2 = 180 inches.

Then, 180 + R = 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

So, R = 60 inches.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, 180 + F2 + R = 420.

If F2 = 180, then 180 + 180 + R = 420.

So, 360 + R = 420.

So, R = 60 inches.

Therefore, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 60 inches.

Alternatively, if F2 = 60 inches, then 180 + 60 + R = 420.

So, 240 + R = 420.

So, R = 180 inches.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, if the second floor is 60 inches, then it's the same height as the first floor, so the ceiling is at 180 + 60 = 240 inches.

Then, the roof is at 240 + 180 = 420 inches.

So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 180 inches.

Alternatively, if the second floor is 180 inches, then it's 180 inches tall, so the ceiling is at 180 + 180 = 360 inches.

Then, the roof is at 360 + R = 420 inches, so R = 60 inches.

So, we have two possibilities: R is either 60 inches or 180 inches.

But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we have to assume that the second floor's height is the same as the first floor's ceiling. So, 180 inches.

Therefore, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 60 inches.

But that seems odd because 180 inches is the ceiling of the first floor, so the second floor is the same.

Alternatively, maybe the second floor is the same height as the first floor, so 60 inches, making the roof 180 inches above the second floor.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is that the second floor's height is the same as the first floor's ceiling, so 180 inches, making the height from the second floor's floor to the roof 60 inches.

But that seems a bit small. Alternatively, maybe the second floor is the same height as the first floor, so 60 inches, making the height from the second floor's floor to the roof 180 inches.

I think the correct way is to assume that the second floor is the same height as the first floor, so 60 inches, so that the total height is 60 + 60 + 180 + R = 420. Wait, no, that would be 300 + R = 420, so R = 120 inches. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, the total height is 420 inches, which includes the first floor, second floor, and the roof.

Wait, no, it's only the two floors. Wait, confusion arises.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the house as two stories, each story is the height of Mattison's height, which is 60 inches. So, each story is 60 inches, so two stories would be 120 inches, but the house is 420 inches. So, that can't be.

Wait, no, the house is two-story, so two floors, each floor is a certain height.

Wait, given that the house is 7 times Mattison's height, so 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

So, total height is 420 inches.

First floor's ceiling is 180 inches, so the first floor is 60 inches tall.

So, the first floor is 60 inches, from ground to ceiling.

So, the second floor is on top of the first floor.

Wait, but the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches, so the second floor must start at 180 inches.

So, the second floor is F2 inches tall, so it goes from 180 inches to 180 + F2 inches.

Then, the roof is on the second floor, so it's from 180 + F2 inches to 180 + F2 + R inches.

Total height is 420 inches, so 180 + F2 + R = 420.

So, 180 + F2 + R = 420.

So, F2 + R = 240 inches.

But we don't know F2.

Unless, perhaps, the second floor is the same height as the first floor, so F2 = 60 inches.

Then, R = 240 - 60 = 180 inches.

So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 180 inches.

Alternatively, if F2 is 180 inches, then R = 60 inches.

But I think the problem expects a numerical answer, so I need to figure out which is correct.

Wait, if the second floor's height is equal to the first floor's ceiling, which is 180 inches, then the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 180 inches.

Alternatively, if the second floor is the same as the first floor, which is 60 inches, then the height is 180 inches.

But the problem doesn't specify.

Wait, maybe the second floor is the same height as the first floor's ceiling, so 180 inches, making the height from the second floor's floor to the roof 60 inches.

But 60 inches is the first floor's height.

Wait, no, the first floor's height is 60 inches, but the second floor's height is 180 inches.

Wait, so the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 180 inches, which is the second floor's height.

But that seems a bit off.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it as:

The height from the second floor's floor to the ceiling is F2 + R = 180 inches.

But we also know that the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps the height from the second floor's floor to the ceiling is F2 + R = 180 inches.

But that would mean the second floor's ceiling is 180 inches above the ground, which is the same as the first floor's ceiling.

So, that would mean the second floor is on top of the first floor.

Wait, that can't be, because the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches, so the second floor's floor is at 180 inches, meaning the second floor is the same height as the first floor.

But that seems too much.

Wait, but the problem says "the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height," so that means the ceiling is 180 inches, so the first floor is 60 inches tall.

So, the second floor is above the first floor.

Wait, but the first floor's ceiling is at 180 inches, so the second floor starts at 180 inches.

Therefore, the second floor is 180 inches tall, so F2 = 180 inches.

Therefore, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is R = 240 - 180 = 60 inches.

So, R is 60 inches.

Therefore, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 60 inches.

But let me confirm:

- First floor: 0 to 60 inches.

- Ceiling of first floor: 180 inches.

- Second floor: starts at 180 inches, goes up to 180 + 180 = 360 inches.

- Roof: starts at 360 inches, goes up to 420 inches.

So, R = 420 - 360 = 60 inches.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 60 inches.

Wait, but that seems like the same height as the first floor, which is 60 inches.

So, the second floor is 180 inches tall, same as the first floor, and the roof is 60 inches above the second floor.

So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 60 inches.

Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is 60 inches.

Wait, but the problem says "how high is the roof from the second floor's floor in inches."

So, R is 60 inches.

Yes, that seems to be the answer.

So, after all that, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 60 inches.

**Final Answer**
The roof is \boxed{60} inches high from the second floor's floor.
</think>

First, we determine Mattison's height, which is 60 inches.

The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison's height, so the total height of the house is:
\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is three times Mattison's height, which is:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor's ceiling is 180 inches above the ground. The second floor is on top of the first floor, so it starts at the same height as the first floor's ceiling, which is 180 inches. The second floor itself is 180 inches tall, making its ceiling at:
\[ 180 + 180 = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The roof is on top of the second floor, so its height from the ground is 420 inches. Therefore, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is:
\[ 420 - 360 = 60 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
