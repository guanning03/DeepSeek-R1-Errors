Question:
Christina is planning a birthday party and needs .75 gift bags per invited guest, because 1/4 of attendees don't show up. She invited 16 friends. Gift bags are $2 each. How much will she spend?

Correct Answer:
She needs 12 gift bags because 16 x .75 = <<16*.75=12>>12
She will spend $24 because 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24
#### 24

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many friends will actually show up to Christina's birthday party. She invited 16 friends, and 1/4 of them didn't show up. 

To find 1/4 of 16, I can calculate 16 multiplied by 1/4, which equals 4 friends that didn't show up.

Subtracting the number of absent friends from the number of invited friends gives me the total number of attendees. So, 16 friends minus 4 absent friends equals 12 attendees who will show up.

Next, Christina needs to prepare 0.75 gift bags per invited guest. However, since the number of gift bags doesn't need to be a whole number, I can multiply the number of attendees by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags required. 

Calculating 12 attendees multiplied by 0.75 gift bags per attendee gives 9 gift bags in total.

Finally, each gift bag costs $2. To find the total cost, I multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per bag. 

12 attendees times $2 per gift bag equals $24 in total.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of attendees:**
   
   Christina invited 16 friends. 
   
   \[
   \text{Number of attendees} = 16 \text{ friends} - \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ friends}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of gift bags needed:**
   
   Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest.
   
   \[
   \text{Total gift bags} = 0.75 \times 12 = 9 \text{ gift bags}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for the gift bags:**
   
   Each gift bag costs \$2.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 9 \times \$2 = \$18
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{18}
