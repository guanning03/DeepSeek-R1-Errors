Question:
Three friends: Mike, Jim, and Tony decided to play a game. After 3 rounds Mike has 21 points, Jim 3 points less than Mike, and Tony 2 times more than Mike. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. How many points do all three players have in total after the extra points had been distributed?

Correct Answer:
After 3 rounds Jim has 21 points - 3 points = <<21-3=18>>18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so he has 2 * 21 points = <<2*21=42>>42 points.
In total they have 42 points + 18 points + 21 points = <<42+18+21=81>>81 points.
Only two of them have over 20 points, so in total, all friends have 81 points + 2 points = <<2+81=83>>83 points.
#### 83

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the initial points each player has after three rounds.

Mike has 21 points.

Jim has 21 points minus 3 points, which equals 18 points.

Tony has 21 points multiplied by 2, which equals 42 points.

Next, I'll calculate the points each player earns in the fourth round.

Mike, Jim, and Tony each receive an extra point since they all have more than 20 points.

Adding 1 point to each player's initial points:

Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points.

Jim: 18 + 1 = 19 points.

Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Finally, I'll sum up all the players' points to find the total after the extra points are distributed.

22 (Mike) + 19 (Jim) + 43 (Tony) = 84 points in total.

Let's determine the points each player has after three rounds and then account for the extra points in the fourth round.

1. **Initial Points After Three Rounds:**
   - **Mike:** 21 points
   - **Jim:** 21 points − 3 points = 18 points
   - **Tony:** 21 points × 2 = 42 points

2. **Points Earned in the Fourth Round:**
   - Every player gets an extra **1 point** because they all have more than **20 points**.
   - **Mike:** 21 + 1 = 22 points
   - **Jim:** 18 + 1 = 19 points
   - **Tony:** 42 + 1 = 43 points

3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**
   \[
   \text{Total Points} = 22 + 19 + 43 = 84
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{84}
