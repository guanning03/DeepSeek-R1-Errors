Question:
Gary likes to walk around the edge of the local park, which is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he walks at 3 miles/hour, how many hours does he spend walking?

Correct Answer:
First find the length of the two long sides of the park: 6 miles * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles
Then find the length of the two short sides of the park: 1.5 miles * 2 = <<1.5*2=3>>3 miles
Then add those two lengthes to find the total distance around the park: 12 miles + 3 miles = <<12+3=15>>15 miles
Then divide the total length by Gary's speed to find how long he spends walking: 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = <<15/3=5>>5 hours

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the sum of its length and width.

The length of the park is 6 miles, and the width is 1.5 miles. Adding these together gives 7.5 miles.

Multiplying this sum by 2 to find the perimeter results in 15 miles.

Next, I'll calculate the time Gary spends walking by dividing the total distance by his walking speed. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour.

Dividing the perimeter of 15 miles by his speed of 3 miles per hour gives a time of 5 hours.

**Solution:**

To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the rectangular park, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Park:**

   The park is a rectangle with a length of **6 miles** and a width of **1.5 miles**. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
   \]

   Plugging in the given values:

   \[
   P = 2 \times (6\ \text{miles} + 1.5\ \text{miles}) = 2 \times 7.5\ \text{miles} = 15\ \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the Time spent Walking:**

   Gary walks at a speed of **3 miles per hour** (\( 3\ \text{mph} \)). The time \( t \) taken to walk a distance \( d \) is given by:

   \[
   t = \frac{d}{\text{speed}} = \frac{15\ \text{miles}}{3\ \text{mph}} = 5\ \text{hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{5\ \text{hours}}
\]
