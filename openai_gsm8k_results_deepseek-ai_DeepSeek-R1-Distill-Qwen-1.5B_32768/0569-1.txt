Question:
James decided to walk to the store.  When he got halfway there he realized he forgot something at home and had to walk back.  If his home is 4 miles from the store and he walks 4 miles per hour how long did it take him to reach the store?

Correct Answer:
He walked 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 miles there before turning around
So in total he walked 2+2+4=<<2+2+4=8>>8 miles, he walked 2 miles to the halfway point than 2 miles home.
That means it took him 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 hours

Okay, so James decided to walk to the store. The store is 4 miles away from his home. When he got halfway there, he realized he forgot something and had to walk back. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. The question is, how long did it take him to reach the store?

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, the total distance from home to the store is 4 miles. That means halfway would be half of 4 miles, which is 2 miles. So, James walked 2 miles to get halfway. But then he realized he forgot something, so he had to walk back 2 miles.

So, in total, he walked 2 miles to the halfway point and then another 2 miles back. That makes a total distance of 4 miles, which matches the original distance to the store. But wait, maybe I should double-check that. If he went halfway, that's 2 miles, and then back 2 miles, so yes, total is 4 miles.

Now, he's walking at a speed of 4 miles per hour. So, time is equal to distance divided by speed. I remember that formula: time = distance / speed. So, I need to find the total distance he walked and then divide that by his speed.

Total distance is 4 miles, and his speed is 4 mph. So, plugging into the formula: time = 4 miles / 4 mph. That simplifies to 1 hour. So, it took him 1 hour to reach the store.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. He walked 2 miles to the halfway point, which took him 2 miles / 4 mph = 0.5 hours. Then he walked back 2 miles, another 2 miles / 4 mph = 0.5 hours. So, adding them together, 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 hour. Yeah, that makes sense.

But just to think about it another way, maybe considering the entire trip. He started at home, went 2 miles, then came back 2 miles. So, each leg of the trip is 2 miles. Each at 4 mph. So, time for each leg is 0.5 hours, so 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 hour. Yep, same answer.

I wonder if there's another way to think about this. Maybe considering relative positions or something, but I think the straightforward approach is the easiest here. He made two trips: out and back, each 2 miles. So, 2 miles out, 2 miles back. Each at 4 mph, so each took 0.5 hours, totaling 1 hour.

Alternatively, if we consider the entire path as a single trip, he went 4 miles in total at 4 mph, so time is 1 hour.

Wait, let me check the units. 4 miles divided by 4 miles per hour. The miles cancel out, leaving hours. So, yes, 1 hour.

Is there any chance I misread the question? It says he walked halfway there, realized he forgot something, and then had to walk back. So, the total distance is 4 miles, which is correct. So, yes, time is 1 hour.

I might also think about if he had to walk all the way back, but no, he only walked back the half mile. So, total distance walked is 4 miles, time is 1 hour.

So, I think that's correct. It took him 1 hour to reach the store.

**Final Answer**
It took James \boxed{1} hour to reach the store.

James decided to walk to the store, which is 4 miles away from his home. When he reached halfway, he realized he forgot something and had to walk back the same distance. 

1. The total distance from home to the store is 4 miles, so halfway is 2 miles.
2. James walked 2 miles to the halfway point and then another 2 miles back, making the total distance 4 miles.
3. James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
4. Time is calculated as distance divided by speed. The total distance is 4 miles, and his speed is 4 mph.
5. Time = 4 miles / 4 mph = 1 hour.

Thus, it took James \boxed{1} hour to reach the store.
