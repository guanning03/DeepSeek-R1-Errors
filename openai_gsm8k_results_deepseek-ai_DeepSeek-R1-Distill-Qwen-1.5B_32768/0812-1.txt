Question:
Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less, each, because she had to complete some assignments. If the rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total throughout the week?

Correct Answer:
If on Monday she slept 8 hours, then she slept 8-2 = <<8-2=6>>6 hours on each of the next two days.
The total number of hours slept for the two days will be 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours.
If she slept 1 hour more for the rest of the week each day, then each day she slept 6+1 = <<6+1=7>>7 hours.
The total for the rest of the week will be 4*7 = <<4*7=28>>28 hours.
The total number of hours slept for the whole week will be 8+12+28 = <<8+12+28=48>>48 hours.

Wrong Answer:
First, Sadie slept for 8 hours on Monday.

On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, which is 8 - 2 = 6 hours.

On Wednesday, she slept another 2 hours less than Tuesday, which is 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

So, for the first three days, Sadie slept a total of 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 hours.

For the rest of the week (from Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than on Tuesday. Since Tuesday was 6 hours, each of these days she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours.

There are 5 days from Thursday to Sunday, so she slept 7 * 5 = 35 hours during this period.

Adding the hours from the first three days to the hours from the remaining five days, Sadie slept a total of 18 + 35 = 53 hours throughout the week.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many hours Sadie slept in total during the week.

1. **Monday:**
   - **Sleep duration:** 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - **Sleep duration:** 2 hours less than Monday.
   - **Calculation:** \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - **Sleep duration:** 2 hours less than Tuesday.
   - **Calculation:** \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.

4. **Total for the first three days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday):**
   - **Sum:** \(8 + 6 + 4 = 18\) hours.

5. **Days from Thursday to Sunday:**
   - **Sleep duration:** 1 hour more than what she slept on Tuesday.
   - **Tuesday's sleep duration:** 6 hours.
   - **Each day from Thursday to Sunday:** \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
   - **Total for these five days:** \(7 \times 5 = 35\) hours.

6. **Total for the entire week:**
   - **Sum of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to Sunday:**
   - **Calculation:** \(18 + 35 = 53\) hours.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{53}
