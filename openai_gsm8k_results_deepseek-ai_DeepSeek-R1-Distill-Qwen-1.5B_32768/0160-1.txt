Question:
Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?

Correct Answer:
The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000

Wrong Answer:
To determine Josh's profit from flipping his house, I'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost after repairs**: Josh initially bought the house for $80,000 and spent an additional $50,000 on repairs. Adding these together gives a total cost of $130,000.

2. **Determine the increased value of the house**: The repairs increased the house's value by 150%. To find the increased value, I'll calculate 150% of $130,000. 

3. **Find the new value of the house**: Adding the increased value to the original total cost will give the new value of the house. 

4. **Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value**.

To determine Josh's profit from flipping his house, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost After Repairs**

Josh purchased the house for:
\[
\$80,\!000
\]

He spent an additional:
\[
\$50,\!000
\]
on repairs.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$80,\!000 + \$50,\!000 = \$130,\!000
\]

### **Step 2: Determine the Increased Value of the House**

The repairs increased the house's value by **150%**. This means the value increased by 1.5 times the original total cost.

\[
\text{Increase in Value} = 150\% \times \$130,\!000 = 1.5 \times \$130,\!000 = \$195,\!000
\]

\[
\text{New Value} = \text{Total Cost} + \text{Increase in Value} = \$130,\!000 + \$195,\!000 = \$325,\!000
\]

### **Step 3: Calculate the Profit**

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{New Value} - \text{Total Cost} = \$325,\!000 - \$130,\!000 = \$195,\!000
\]

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{\$195,\!000}
\]
