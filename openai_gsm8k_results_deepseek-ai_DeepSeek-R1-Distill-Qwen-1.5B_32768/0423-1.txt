Question:
Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each. The stock price increases 50% the first year Maria holds it, then decreases 25% in the second year. What is the final value of all Maria's shares?

Correct Answer:
First find the initial total value of Maria's purchase: 8 shares * $8/share = $<<8*8=64>>64
Then find the amount of the first price increase: $64 * .5 = $<<64*.5=32>>32
Add that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: $64 + $32 = $<<64+32=96>>96
Then multiply that amount by 25% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: $96 * 25% = $<<96*25*.01=24>>24
Then subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: $96 - $24 = $<<96-24=72>>72
#### 72

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the initial cost of Maria's 8 shares. At $8 each, the total is 8 multiplied by 8, which equals $64.

Next, I'll determine the stock price after a 50% increase in the first year. A 50% increase on $64 is calculated as 64 multiplied by 0.5, resulting in $32.

Then, in the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. A 25% decrease on $32 is found by multiplying 32 by 0.25, which equals $8.

Finally, the stock price after the second year is the initial price after the increase minus the decrease. That is $32 minus $8, giving a final stock price of $24.

To find the total value of Maria's 8 shares after two years, I'll multiply the final stock price by the number of shares: 8 multiplied by $24, resulting in $192.

To determine the final value of Maria's shares, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Initial Cost**
Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.

\[
\text{Initial Total Cost} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64
\]

### **Step 2: Calculate the Stock Price After the First Year**
The stock price increases by **50%** in the first year.

\[
\text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$64 = 0.5 \times 64 = \$32
\]
\[
\text{Stock Price After First Year} = \$64 + \$32 = \$96
\]

### **Step 3: Calculate the Stock Price After the Second Year**
The stock price decreases by **25%** in the second year.

\[
\text{Decrease} = 25\% \times \$96 = 0.25 \times 96 = \$24
\]
\[
\text{Final Stock Price} = \$96 - \$24 = \$72
\]

### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Value of Maria's Shares**
Now, multiply the final stock price by the number of shares Maria holds.

\[
\text{Total Value} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$72/\text{share} = \$576
\]

\[
\boxed{\$576}
\]
