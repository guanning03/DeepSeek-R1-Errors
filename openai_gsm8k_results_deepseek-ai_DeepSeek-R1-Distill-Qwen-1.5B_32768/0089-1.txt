Question:
Shannon makes herself iced coffee by brewing hot coffee and adding ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees but makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Any added liquid also weakens the coffee. How many milliliters weaker is Shannon’s iced coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream?

Correct Answer:
Shannon’s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.
The ice makes the coffee 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 milliliters weaker.
After adding cream, Shannon’s iced coffee is 60 + 15 = <<60+15=75>>75 milliliters weaker.
#### 75

Gold:
75

Wrong Prediction:
795

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how much each degree of cooling affects the strength of the iced coffee. Each degree of cooling weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters.

Next, I'll calculate the total cooling effect by multiplying the cooling degrees (65) by the per-degree effect (12 milliliters per degree):
65 × 12 = 780 milliliters.

Then, I'll account for the additional 15 milliliters of cream added, which also weakens the coffee by 1 milliliter per milliliter of cream:
15 × 1 = 15 milliliters.

Finally, I'll add the cooling effect and the cream effect to find the total weakening:
780 + 15 = 795 milliliters.

To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we'll break down the problem into two main components: the cooling effect and the cream effect.

### 1. Cooling Effect
Each degree of cooling weakens the coffee by **12 milliliters**. Shannon's iced coffee is cooled by **65 degrees**.

\[
\text{Cooling Effect} = 65 \text{ degrees} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per degree} = 780 \text{ milliliters}
\]

### 2. Cream Effect
Shannon adds **15 milliliters** of cream, which also weakens the coffee by **1 milliliter per milliliter** of cream.

\[
\text{Cream Effect} = 15 \text{ milliliters} \times 1 \text{ milliliter per milliliter} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
\]

### 3. Total Weakening
To find the total weakening, add the cooling effect and the cream effect together.

\[
\text{Total Weakening} = 780 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 795 \text{ milliliters}
\]

\[
\boxed{795}
\]
