Question:
Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. If 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, what percent of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes?

Correct Answer:
First find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 80% = 20%
Then multiply that percentage by the percentage of water taken from the river: 20% * 40% = 8%
#### 8

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine what percentage of the river's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.

The problem states that Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water for industrial purposes. To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, I'll subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage of water used.

So, 100% minus 40% equals 60%.

Therefore, 60% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

To determine what percentage of the river's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Total Water Usage:**
   - Colorado City uses **40%** of the river's water for industrial purposes.

2. **Calculate Non-Industrial Water Usage:**
   - Since the total water usage is **100%**, subtract the industrial water usage from the total.
   \[
   \text{Non-Industrial Usage} = 100\% - 40\% = 60\%
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{60\%}
\]
