Question:
Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. For 11 months Stephen will give his sister $25 per month and the remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid on the twelfth month. How much will Stephen pay in the twelfth month?

Correct Answer:
Stephen will pay an additional $300 x 2/100 = $<<300*2/100=6>>6.
He should return a total of $300 + $6 = $<<300+6=306>>306.
For eleven months Stephen will pay a total of $25 x 11 = $<<25*11=275>>275.
Therefore, Stephen will pay 306 - 275 = $<<306-275=31>>31 on the twelfth month.

31

Wrong Prediction:
37

Wrong Answer:
First, calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return to his sister. He borrowed $300 and needs to add 2% interest to it. 

The interest is calculated as:
2% of $300 = $6

So, the total amount owed is:
$300 + $6 = $306

Next, determine the total amount Stephen will pay over the 11 months. He will receive $25 each month for 11 months, which totals:
11 months Ã— $25/month = $275

Subtract the total amount received from the total amount owed to find the remaining balance:
$306 - $275 = $31

Finally, Stephen will pay the remaining balance plus the interest on the twelfth month. Therefore, the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
$31 + $6 = $37
</think>

**Solution:**

Step 1: **Calculate the Total Amount to Return**

Stephen borrowed **\$300** from his sister and needs to return it with an **additional 2% interest**.

\[
\text{Interest} = 2\% \text{ of } \$300 = 0.02 \times 300 = \$6
\]

\[
\text{Total Amount to Return} = \$300 + \$6 = \$306
\]

Step 2: **Calculate the Total Amount Received Over 11 Months**

Stephen will give his sister **\$25** per month for **11 months**.

\[
\text{Total Amount Received} = 11 \text{ months} \times \$25/\text{month} = \$275
\]

Step 3: **Determine the Remaining Balance for the Twelfth Month**

Subtract the total amount received from the total amount to return.

\[
\text{Remaining Balance} = \$306 - \$275 = \$31
\]

Step 4: **Calculate the Total Payment for the Twelfth Month**

Stephen will pay the remaining balance plus the **interest**.

\[
\text{Total Payment} = \$31 + \$6 = \$37
\]

**Final Answer:**

Stephen will pay \(\boxed{37}\) dollars in the twelfth month.
