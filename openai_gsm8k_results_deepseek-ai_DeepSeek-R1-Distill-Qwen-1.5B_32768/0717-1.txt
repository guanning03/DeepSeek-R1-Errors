Question:
A farm has 10 2-legged animals and 15 4-legged animals. If all animals are healthy, how many pairs of animal legs in total are on the farm?

Correct Answer:
2-legged animals have 2 legs. Therefore 10 2-legged animals will have 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 legs
4-legged animals have 4 legs. Therefore 15 4-legged animals will have 15*4=<<15*4=60>>60 legs
In total there are 20+60= <<20+60=80>>80 legs
A pair of legs equals 2 legs. If there are 80 legs on the farm, there will be 80/2= <<80/2=40>>40 pairs of legs
#### 40

Wrong Answer:
To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, I'll start by calculating the number of legs contributed by each type of animal.

First, the 10 two-legged animals contribute 10 multiplied by 2, which equals 20 legs.

Next, the 15 four-legged animals contribute 15 multiplied by 4, resulting in 60 legs.

Finally, by adding the legs from both groups, I'll obtain the total number of animal legs on the farm.

To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given:
- **10 two-legged animals**
- **15 four-legged animals**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs from each type of animal.

1. **Two-legged animals:**
   \[
   10 \text{ animals} \times 2 \text{ legs/animal} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Four-legged animals:**
   \[
   15 \text{ animals} \times 4 \text{ legs/animal} = 60 \text{ legs}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of legs on the farm.
\[
20 \text{ legs} + 60 \text{ legs} = 80 \text{ legs}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{80}
\]
