Question:
A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. The island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?

Correct Answer:
Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.
They dug 10 + 13 + 8 = <<10+13+8=31>>31 holes the first three days.
After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.
Thus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.
#### 11

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the total number of holes the pirate crew dug by the end of the first day. They dug 10 holes.

Next, on the second day, they dug 13 more holes, bringing the total to 23 holes by the end of the second day.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes, making the total 31 holes. However, they stopped early and filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes by the end of the third day is 29.

By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes on the island was four times the number of holes they had by the end of the first day. This means the total number of holes became 4 * 23 = 92 holes.

To find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day, I'll subtract the number of holes they had by the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. So, 92 - 29 equals 63 holes.

Therefore, the pirates dug 63 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Number of holes dug: 10

2. **Second Day:**
   - Number of holes dug: 13
   - Total holes after two days: \(10 + 13 = 23\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Number of holes dug: 8
   - Total holes before stopping: \(23 + 8 = 31\)
   - They stopped early and filled in 2 holes:
     - Total holes by the end of the third day: \(31 - 2 = 29\)

4. **Fourth Day:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day.
   - By the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes on the island became four times the number of holes at the end of the first day.
   - Number of holes at the end of the first day: 23
   - Therefore, by the end of the fourth day: \(4 \times 23 = 92\)
   - Equation: \(29 + x = 92\)
   - Solving for \(x\): \(x = 92 - 29 = 63\)

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{63}
