Question:
Michael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 50km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If he goes on like this for 3 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has he covered?

Correct Answer:
There are 24 hours in each day, so he has been traveling for a total of 3*24 = <<24*3=72>>72 hours
At a rate of 50km/hr he has covered 50*72 = <<50*72=3600>>3600 km
3600km as a percentage of 6000km is (3600/6000)*100% = 60%
#### 60

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total distance Michael travels over the three days. Since he drives at an average speed of 50 km/hr and drives for 3 days, the total distance is 50 km/hr multiplied by 3 days, which equals 150 km/day multiplied by 3 days, resulting in 450 km.

Next, I'll determine the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered. The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, so the percentage is calculated by dividing the distance Michael traveled (450 km) by the total distance (6000 km) and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

Doing the math, 450 divided by 6000 is 0.075, and multiplying by 100 gives a 7.5% coverage of the total distance.

To determine what percentage of the **distance between Alaska and Texas** Michael has covered, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Distance Traveled:**
   
   - **Average Speed:** 50 km/hr
   - **Time Driven:** 3 days

   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 450 \, \text{km}
   \]

2. **Determine the Percentage of the Distance Covered:**
   
   - **Total Distance:** 6000 km
   - **Distance Traveled:** 450 km

   \[
   \text{Percentage Covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance Traveled}}{\text{Total Distance}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{450 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 7.5\%
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**

   \[
   \boxed{7.5\%}
   \]
