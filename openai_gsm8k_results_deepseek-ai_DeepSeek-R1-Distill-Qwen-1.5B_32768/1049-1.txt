Question:
Tiffany is measuring how many surfers can ride a big wave without falling. She sees that when a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. Of these riders, 60% are women. If there are 100 riders, how many men can stay upright on the wave?

Correct Answer:
25 riders stayed upright because 100 x .25 = <<100*.25=25>>25
Of these riders 10 were men because 25 x .4 = <<25*.4=10>>10
#### 10

Wrong Answer:
To determine the number of men who can stay upright on a wave, I'll follow these steps:

First, I'll calculate how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can do so, and there are 100 riders in total, I'll find 25% of 100, which is 25 riders.

Next, I'll determine how many of these upright riders are women. Given that 60% of the upright riders are women, I'll calculate 60% of 25, which equals 15 women.

Since the total number of riders is 100 and there are 15 women who can stay upright, the remaining riders must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is the total riders minus the women who can stay upright, which is 100 minus 15, resulting in 85 men.

To determine the number of men who can stay upright on a wave, follow these steps:

1. **Total Number of Riders:** 
   \[
   \text{Total riders} = 100
   \]

2. **Number of Riders Who Can Stay Upright:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage of riders who can stay upright} = 25\%
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of upright riders} = 25\% \times 100 = 25 \text{ riders}
   \]

3. **Number of Women Among Upright Riders:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage of women among upright riders} = 60\%
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of women} = 60\% \times 25 = 15 \text{ women}
   \]

4. **Number of Men Among Upright Riders:**
   \[
   \text{Number of men} = \text{Total upright riders} - \text{Number of women}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of men} = 25 - 15 = \boxed{85}
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{85}\)
