Question:
Luke is spending time at the beach building sandcastles. He eventually notices that each level of a sandcastle will have half the square footage as the level below it. If he makes a 4 leveled sandcastle where the top level has a square footage of 16, what is the average square footage of a level?

Correct Answer:
Level 3 is 32 square feet because 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32
Level 2 is 64 square feet because 32 x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64
Level 1 is 128 square feet because 64 x 2 = <<64*2=128>>128
The four levels total to 240 square feet because 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = <<128+64+32+16=240>>240
The average square footage of a level is 60 because 240 / 4 = <<240/4=60>>60

7.5

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the square footage of each level of the sandcastle. Luke's sandcastle has 4 levels, with each subsequent level having half the square footage of the level below it. The top level has a square footage of 16.

Starting from the top, the top level is 16 square feet. The next level below it would be half of 16, which is 8 square feet. The level below that would be half of 8, resulting in 4 square feet. The bottom level would then be half of 4, which is 2 square feet.

To find the average square footage of a level, I will add up all the square footage levels and then divide by the total number of levels.

Adding them together: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 equals 30 square feet.

Finally, dividing the total by the number of levels: 30 square feet divided by 4 levels equals an average of 7.5 square feet per level.

To determine the average square footage of each level of Luke's 4-level sandcastle, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the square footage of each level:**
   
   - **Top Level (Level 4):** 16 square feet
   - **Level 3:** Half of Level 4 = \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
   - **Level 2:** Half of Level 3 = \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
   - **Level 1 (Bottom Level):** Half of Level 2 = \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

2. **Calculate the total square footage:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Square Footage} = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the average square footage per level:**
   
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Square Footage}}{\text{Number of Levels}} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet}
   \]

\(\boxed{7.5}\)
