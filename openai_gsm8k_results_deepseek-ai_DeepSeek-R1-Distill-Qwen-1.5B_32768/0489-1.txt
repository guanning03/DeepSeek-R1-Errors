Question:
Fishio posted her selfie on Instagram. She received 2000 likes on the photo after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. If she received 20000 more new likes recently, how many Instagram likes are there?

Correct Answer:
After receiving 2000 likes on her photo on Instagram on the first week, Fishio received 70*2000 = <<70*2000=140000>>140000 new likes on the photo after three more weeks.
The total number of likes in the four weeks is 140000+2000 = <<140000+2000=142000>>142000
If Fishio received 20000 more likes recently, the number of likes on the photo is 142000+20000=<<142000+20000=162000>>162000
#### 162000

Wrong Answer:
I start by identifying the initial number of likes, which is 2000.

Next, I calculate the number of likes after three weeks. It is given that the likes have grown to 70 times the initial number, so I multiply 2000 by 70 to get 140,000.

Then, I add the recent increase in likes, which is 20,000. This brings the total number of likes to 160,000.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Initial number of likes = 2000
- After 3 weeks, the number of likes is 70 times the initial number.
- Recent increase in likes = 20,000

**Step 1: Calculate the number of likes after 3 weeks.**

\[
\text{Likes after 3 weeks} = 70 \times \text{Initial number of likes} = 70 \times 2000 = 140,000
\]

**Step 2: Add the recent increase in likes.**

\[
\text{Total likes} = \text{Likes after 3 weeks} + \text{Recent increase} = 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{160000}
\]
