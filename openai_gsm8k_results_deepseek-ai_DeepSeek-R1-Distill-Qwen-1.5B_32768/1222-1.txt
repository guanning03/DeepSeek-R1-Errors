Question:
Each solid 10-foot section of a redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. Termites ate 30% of this redwood's wood. If the redwood is 200 feet tall, how much does it weigh?

Correct Answer:
First find how many 10-foot sections are in the redwood: 200 feet / 10 feet/section = <<200/10=20>>20 sections
Then multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = <<20*400=8000>>8000 pounds
Then find the amount of the wood the termites ate: 8000 pounds * 30% = <<8000*30*.01=2400>>2400 pounds
Then subtract that amount from the total weight of the wood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = <<8000-2400=5600>>5600 pounds
#### 5600

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total weight of the redwood tree. The tree is 200 feet tall and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. So, there are 200 divided by 10, which equals 20 sections. Each section weighs 400 pounds, so 20 sections multiplied by 400 pounds gives a total weight of 8000 pounds.

Next, I'll calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate. The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood. To find 30% of 8000 pounds, I multiply 8000 by 0.3, which equals 2400 pounds.

Finally, I'll subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the remaining weight. So, 8000 pounds minus 2400 pounds equals 5600 pounds.

To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate 30% of its wood, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree:**
   
   - Each 10-foot section weighs **400 pounds**.
   - The tree is **200 feet tall**.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of 10-foot sections} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total weight of the tree} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the weight of the wood eaten by the termites:**
   
   - The termites ate **30%** of the redwood's wood.
   
   \[
   \text{Weight eaten by termites} = 30\% \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 0.3 \times 8000 = 2400 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining weight of the redwood:**
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
   \]

\[
\boxed{5600\ \text{pounds}}
\]
