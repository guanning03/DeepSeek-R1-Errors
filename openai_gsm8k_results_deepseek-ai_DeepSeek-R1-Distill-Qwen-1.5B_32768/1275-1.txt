Question:
Pauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. The cost of one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years. How much did Pauline spend on all visits to the museum?

Correct Answer:
Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.
That means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.
After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the original cost of one museum visit, which is $2.

Next, I'll calculate the increase in cost after 5 years. A 150% increase on $2 is calculated as 1.5 times $2, which equals $3. This means the cost per visit after 5 years is $3.

Since Pauline visited the museum 3 more times after the 5-year period, I'll multiply the new cost of $3 by 3 to find the additional spending, resulting in $9.

Finally, I'll add the original visits of 5 years, each costing $2, totaling $10, to the additional spending of $9. This gives a combined total of $19 that Pauline spent on all museum visits.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Original Cost of One Visit:**
   - **Cost per visit:** \$2

2. **Increase in Cost After 5 Years:**
   - **Percentage increase:** 150%
   - **Calculation:** 
     \[
     \text{Increased cost} = 2 + (150\% \times 2) = 2 + 3 = \$5
     \]
   - **Note:** After a 150% increase, the cost becomes \$5 per visit.

3. **Total Visits Over 5 Years:**
   - **Number of visits:** 5
   - **Total cost for 5 visits:** 
     \[
     5 \times \$2 = \$10
     \]

4. **Additional Visits Over 3 More Years:**
   - **Number of additional visits:** 3
   - **Total cost for additional visits:** 
     \[
     3 \times \$5 = \$15
     \]

5. **Total Spending on All Visits:**
   \[
   \$10 + \$15 = \$25
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{25}
\]
