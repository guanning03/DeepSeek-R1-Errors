Question:
Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?

Correct Answer:
Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.
With those, he can make 144 / 12 = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.
Thus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.

Wrong Answer:
First, calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has by multiplying the number of bags by the number of chips per bag. 

2 bags × 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Next, determine how many glass chips are needed to cover the height of the mosaic. Since each square inch requires 12 chips and the mosaic is 3 inches tall, multiply the number of inches by the number of chips per inch.

3 inches × 12 chips/inch = 36 chips

Subtract the number of chips used for the height from the total number of chips to find out how many chips are left for the length.

144 chips - 36 chips = 108 chips

Finally, divide the number of remaining chips by the number of chips needed per inch to find out how many inches long the mosaic can be.

108 chips ÷ 12 chips/inch = 9 inches

To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total chips} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Chips per bag} = 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. **Determine how many glass chips are needed to cover the height of the mosaic:**
   
   \[
   \text{Chips for height} = \text{Height in inches} \times \text{Chips per inch} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ chips}
   \]

3. **Subtract the chips used for the height from the total chips to find the remaining chips for the length:**
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining chips} = \text{Total chips} - \text{Chips for height} = 144 - 36 = 108 \text{ chips}
   \]

4. **Calculate how many inches long the mosaic can be with the remaining chips:**
   
   \[
   \text{Length in inches} = \frac{\text{Remaining chips}}{\text{Chips per inch}} = \frac{108}{12} = 9 \text{ inches}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{9}
