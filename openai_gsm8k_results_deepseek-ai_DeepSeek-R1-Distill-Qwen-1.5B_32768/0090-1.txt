Question:
The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. How many loaves of bread did they have left?

Correct Answer:
The Bakery sold 93 + 39 = <<93+39=132>>132 loaves.
The Bakery made 200 loaves and sold 132, leaving 200 - 132 = <<200-132=68>>68 loaves remaining.
The grocery store returned 6 loaves, so there were 6 + 68 = <<6+68=74>>74 loaves left.

Wrong Prediction:
62

Wrong Answer:
First, the bakers started with 200 loaves of bread.

They sold 93 loaves in the morning, so subtracting that from the total: 200 - 93 = 107 loaves remaining.

Then, they sold 39 loaves in the afternoon, so subtracting that next: 107 - 39 = 68 loaves remaining.

Finally, a grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves, so subtracting that: 68 - 6 = 62 loaves of bread left.

Let's determine how many loaves of bread the Beverly Hills Bakery had left after their operations.

1. **Initial Number of Loaves:**
   \[
   \text{Total loaves baked} = 200
   \]

2. **Loaves Sold in the Morning:**
   \[
   \text{Sold in the morning} = 93
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining after morning sales} = 200 - 93 = 107
   \]

3. **Loaves Sold in the Afternoon:**
   \[
   \text{Sold in the afternoon} = 39
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining after afternoon sales} = 107 - 39 = 68
   \]

4. **Loaves Returned by the Grocery Store:**
   \[
   \text{Returned loaves} = 6
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final remaining loaves} = 68 - 6 = 62
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{62}
\]
