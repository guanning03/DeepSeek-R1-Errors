Question:
Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. Peter wants a quarter of that and Paul wants 1/3 of that. How many kilograms will James have left?

Correct Answer:
Peter wants 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 kg of apples.
Paul wants 12 * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 kg of apples.
Together, Peter and Paul want a total of 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 kg of apples.
So James will have 12 - 7 = <<12-7=5>>5 kg.

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the total amount of apples that Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought, which is 12 kilograms.

Next, calculate how much Peter wants. Since Peter wants a quarter of the apples, he will take 12 kg multiplied by 1/4, which equals 3 kilograms.

Then, calculate how much Paul wants. Paul wants one-third of the apples, so he will take 12 kg multiplied by 1/3, resulting in 4 kilograms.

Add the amounts Peter and Paul want together: 3 kilograms plus 4 kilograms equals 7 kilograms.

Finally, subtract the total apples taken by Peter and Paul from the original 12 kilograms to find out how many kilograms James will have left: 12 kilograms minus 7 kilograms equals 5 kilograms.

Let's determine how many kilograms of apples James will have left step by step.

**Given:**
- Total apples bought by Pierre, Paul, and Jacques: **12 kg**
- Peter wants **1/4 of the apples**
- Paul wants **1/3 of the apples**
- James wants the remaining apples

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of apples Peter wants**

\[
\text{Apples Peter wants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12\ \text{kg} = 3\ \text{kg}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of apples Paul wants**

\[
\text{Apples Paul wants} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12\ \text{kg} = 4\ \text{kg}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total apples taken by Peter and Paul**

\[
\text{Total apples taken by Peter and Paul} = 3\ \text{kg} + 4\ \text{kg} = 7\ \text{kg}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining apples for James**

\[
\text{Apples left for James} = 12\ \text{kg} - 7\ \text{kg} = 5\ \text{kg}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{5\ \text{kg}}
\]
