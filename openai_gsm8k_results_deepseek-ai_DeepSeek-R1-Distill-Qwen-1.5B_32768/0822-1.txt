Question:
There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but John has to take 2 extra classes.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning?

Correct Answer:
He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day
That means he spends 40*8=<<40*8=320>>320 minutes per day in class
So he spends 320*5=<<320*5=1600>>1600 minutes a week
That means he spends 1600/16=<<1600/16=100>>100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday
So he spends 1600+100+100=<<1600+100+100=1800>>1800 minutes per week
So he spends 1800/60=<<1800/60=30>>30 hours per week

28\frac{1}{3}

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total number of classes John is taking. He has 6 normal periods and adds 2 extra classes, totaling 8 classes.

Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in class each week is 8 classes multiplied by 40 minutes, which equals 320 minutes.

Next, since John attends class 5 days a week, the total weekly class time is 5 days multiplied by 320 minutes, resulting in 1600 minutes.

Additionally, he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. This additional time is calculated by dividing 1600 minutes by 16, which gives 100 minutes.

Finally, to find the total weekly learning time in hours, I convert the combined minutes into hours. The total minutes are 1600 (class) + 100 (extra) = 1700 minutes. Dividing by 60 gives approximately 28.33 hours.

To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, let's break down the problem step by step.

### 1. Calculate the Total Number of Classes
- **Normal Periods:** 6 classes
- **Extra Classes:** 2 classes

**Total Classes:** 
\[
6 + 2 = 8 \text{ classes}
\]

### 2. Determine the Total Weekly Class Time
- **Minutes per Class:** 40 minutes
- **Total Class Minutes:** 
\[
8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes}
\]

- **Days Attended:** 5 days a week

**Total Weekly Class Time:**
\[
5 \text{ days} \times 320 \text{ minutes/day} = 1600 \text{ minutes}
\]

### 3. Calculate the Extra Learning Time
- **Fraction of Weekly Minutes:** \(\frac{1}{16}\)

**Extra Time in Minutes:**
\[
\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes}
\]

### 4. Determine the Total Weekly Learning Time
- **Total Minutes:** 
\[
1600 \text{ minutes (class)} + 100 \text{ minutes (extra)} = 1700 \text{ minutes}
\]

- **Convert Minutes to Hours:**
\[
\frac{1700 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 28.\overline{3} \text{ hours}
\]

### **Final Answer**
\[
\boxed{28 \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours}}
\]
