Question:
John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?

Correct Answer:
He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day
That means he travels 60*5=<<60*5=300>>300 miles per week
So he pays 300*2=$<<300*2=600>>600 per week
That means he pays $600*50=$<<600*50=30000>>30000 a year for miles driven
He also gives $150*12=$<<150*12=1800>>1800 a year as a bonus to his driver
So he pays $30000+$1800=$<<30000+1800=31800>>31,800 a year
#### 31800

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total distance John drives each day. Since his work is 30 miles away and he returns home each day, he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.

Next, I'll determine how many miles he drives in a week. John works 5 days a week, so multiplying 60 miles by 5 days gives 300 miles per week.

Then, I'll find out how many miles he drives in a year. With 50 weeks of work, multiplying 300 miles by 50 weeks results in 15,000 miles per year.

Now, I'll calculate the cost of driving. At $2 per mile, the total mileage cost is 15,000 miles multiplied by $2, which equals $30,000.

Finally, I'll add the annual bonus to the driving cost. The bonus is $150 per month, so for 50 weeks (which is approximately 50 months), the total bonus is $150 multiplied by 50, resulting in $7,500.

Adding the driving cost and the bonus together, John pays a total of $37,500 per year for driving.

To determine how much John pays annually for driving, let's break down the costs step by step.

### 1. Calculate Daily Driving Distance
- **One-way distance:** 30 miles
- **Return distance:** 30 miles

**Total daily driving distance:**  
\[
30 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
\]

### 2. Calculate Weekly Driving Distance
- **Days worked per week:** 5

**Total weekly driving distance:**  
\[
60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week}
\]

### 3. Calculate Annual Driving Distance
- **Number of weeks worked per year:** 50

**Total annual driving distance:**  
\[
300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15,000 \text{ miles/year}
\]

### 4. Calculate Driving Cost
- **Cost per mile:** \$2

**Total driving cost:**  
\[
15,000 \text{ miles} \times \$2/\text{mile} = \$30,000
\]

### 5. Calculate Annual Bonus
- **Monthly bonus:** \$150
- **Number of months worked:** 50

**Total bonus:**  
\[
\$150/\text{month} \times 50 \text{ months} = \$7,500
\]

### 6. Calculate Total Annual Driving Cost
\[
\text{Driving Cost} + \text{Bonus} = \$30,000 + \$7,500 = \$37,500
\]

\[
\boxed{37500}
\]
