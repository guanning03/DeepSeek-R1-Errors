Question:
Gene is sewing a quilt out of old souvenir t-shirts. He has one shirt from each vacation he has been on. Every shirt is its own quilt block. Each row is made of blocks from a different year of vacations. He goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. He is now 34. How many quilt blocks does he have in total?

Correct Answer:
Gene has been on 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years of vacations, so he has 11 rows of blocks.
He goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.
Gene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.
#### 44

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many years Gene has been on vacation. He is now 34 and started when he was 23, so that means he has been on vacation for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Next, since each vacation year results in one new shirt, and each shirt is a separate quilt block, Gene has 11 different years of vacation, each contributing one block.

Finally, multiplying the number of vacation years by the number of blocks per year gives the total number of quilt blocks: 11 years * 1 block/year = 11 blocks.

To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Number of Years on Vacation:**
   
   Gene is now 34 years old and started when he was 23. 
   
   \[
   \text{Years on Vacation} = 34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine the Total Number of Quilt Blocks:**
   
   Each year of vacation results in one new shirt, which is a separate quilt block. Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the number of vacation years.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Quilt Blocks} = 11 \text{ years} \times 1 \text{ block/year} = 11 \text{ blocks}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{11}
\]
