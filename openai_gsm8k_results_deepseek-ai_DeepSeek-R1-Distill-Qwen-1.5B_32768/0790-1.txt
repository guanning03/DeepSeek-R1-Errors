Question:
In Tateâ€™s garden pond, there are 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes.  He buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.  How many more female fishes than male fishes does Tate have?

Correct Answer:
Tate has a total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 male fishes.
He has a total of 7 + 5 = <<7+5=12>>12 female fishes.
After the purchases, he has 7 + 2 + 2 = <<7+2+2=11>>11 male fishes.
After the purchases, he has 12 + 1 + 3 = <<12+1+3=16>>16 female fishes.
In his pond, there are this many more female fishes than male fishes 16 - 11 = <<16-11=5>>5 fishes.

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll identify the number of each type of fish Tate initially has in his pond.

There are 4 male guppies and 7 female guppies. Then, there are 3 male goldfishes and 5 female goldfishes.

Next, Tate buys additional fish. He purchases 2 more male guppies and 1 female guppy, as well as 2 more male goldfishes and 3 female goldfishes.

Now, I'll calculate the total number of male and female fish after the purchase.

For males:
- Initial guppies: 4
- Additional guppies: 2
- Total male fish: 4 + 2 = 6

For females:
- Initial guppies: 7
- Additional guppies: 1
- Total female fish: 7 + 1 = 8

For goldfishes:
- Initial goldfishes: 3
- Additional goldfishes: 2
- Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Finally, I'll determine how many more female fishes there are than male fishes by subtracting the total number of male fish from the total number of female fish.

Total female fish: 8
Total male fish: 6

Difference: 8 - 6 = 2

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Initial Counts:**
- **Male Guppies:** 4
- **Female Guppies:** 7
- **Male Goldfishes:** 3
- **Female Goldfishes:** 5

**Fishes Bought:**
- **Male Guppies:** 2
- **Female Guppies:** 1
- **Male Goldfishes:** 2
- **Female Goldfishes:** 3

**Calculating Total Female Fishes:**
\[
\text{Total Female Fishes} = \text{Initial Female Guppies} + \text{Additional Female Guppies} = 7 + 1 = 8
\]

**Calculating Total Male Fishes:**
\[
\text{Total Male Fishes} = \text{Initial Male Guppies} + \text{Additional Male Guppies} = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

**Difference Between Female and Male Fishes:**
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total Female Fishes} - \text{Total Male Fishes} = 8 - 6 = 2
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2}
\]
