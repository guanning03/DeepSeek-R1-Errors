Question:
Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog and another dog that is half the weight of Kory’s dog. If Kory’s dog is 60 pounds, how much do Elijah and Kory’s dogs weigh altogether, in pounds?

Correct Answer:
Elijah’s first dog is 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 pounds
Elijah’s second dog is 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 pounds
The total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is 15 + 30 + 60 = <<15+30+60=105>>105 pounds
#### 105

Wrong Answer:
First, identify the weight of Kory’s dog, which is 60 pounds.

Next, determine the weight of Elijah’s first dog, which is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog. Calculate one-fourth of 60 pounds:
60 pounds * (1/4) = 15 pounds.

Then, find the weight of Elijah’s second dog, which is half the weight of Kory’s dog. Calculate half of 60 pounds:
60 pounds * (1/2) = 30 pounds.

Finally, add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight:
15 pounds + 30 pounds = 45 pounds.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Weight of Kory’s Dog:**
   
   Kory’s dog weighs **60 pounds**.

2. **Weight of Elijah’s First Dog:**
   
   Elijah’s first dog is **one-fourth** the weight of Kory’s dog.
   
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60\, \text{pounds} = 15\, \text{pounds}
   \]

3. **Weight of Elijah’s Second Dog:**
   
   Elijah’s second dog is **half** the weight of Kory’s dog.
   
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60\, \text{pounds} = 30\, \text{pounds}
   \]

4. **Total Weight of Both Dogs:**
   
   Add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight.
   
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 15\, \text{pounds} + 30\, \text{pounds} = 45\, \text{pounds}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{45\ \text{pounds}}
\]
