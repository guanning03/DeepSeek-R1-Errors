Question:
Mark makes custom dog beds. A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing, a bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing, and a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the first two kinds of beds. How many pounds of stuffing does Mark need to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds?

Correct Answer:
First, find the total amount of stuffing in one Rottweiler bed and one chihuahua bed: 2 pounds + 8 pounds = <<2+8=10>>10 pounds
Then divide the total stuffing amount by 2 to find the average stuffing amount: 10 pounds / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 pounds
Then find the amount of stuffing in 4 chihuahua beds: 2 pounds/bed * 4 beds = <<2*4=8>>8 pounds
Then find the amount of stuffing in 3 collie beds: 5 pounds/bed * 3 beds = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds
Then add the two amounts of stuffing to find the total amount of stuffing needed: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = <<8+15=23>>23 pounds

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the stuffing required for each type of bed.

A bed for a Rottweiler requires 8 pounds of stuffing.

A bed for a chihuahua requires 2 pounds of stuffing.

A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. The average between 8 and 2 is 5 pounds.

Next, I'll calculate the total stuffing needed for 4 Rottweiler beds and 3 chihuahua beds.

For the Rottweiler beds: 4 beds × 8 pounds per bed = 32 pounds.

For the chihuahua beds: 3 beds × 2 pounds per bed = 6 pounds.

Finally, I'll add the stuffing needed for both types of beds to find the total amount Mark needs.

Total stuffing = 32 pounds (Rottweiler) + 6 pounds (chihuahua) = 38 pounds.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the Stuffing Required for Each Bed Type:**

   - **Rottweiler Bed:**  
     A bed for a Rottweiler requires **8 pounds** of stuffing.

   - **Chihuahua Bed:**  
     A bed for a chihuahua requires **2 pounds** of stuffing.

   - **Collie Bed:**  
     A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.  
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds} + 2 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Stuffing Needed for 4 Rottweiler Beds and 3 Collie Beds:**

   - **For Rottweiler Beds:**  
     \[
     4 \text{ beds} \times 8 \text{ pounds per bed} = 32 \text{ pounds}
     \]

   - **For Collie Beds:**  
     \[
     3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Find the Total Stuffing Needed:**  
   \[
   32 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 47 \text{ pounds}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{47}
\]
