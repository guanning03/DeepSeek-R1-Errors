Question:
A customerâ€™s loyalty card at a store gives them rewards of $1 off their next purchase for every $20 they spend. Their last shopping trip, they spent $80. This shopping trip, they spent $43, used their rewards, and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. How many dollars did the customer pay on this shopping trip?

Correct Answer:
The customer had 80 / 20 = $<<80/20=4>>4 in rewards.
Their coupon was worth 4 * 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8.
Thus, they paid 43 - 4 - 8 = $<<43-4-8=31>>31 on this shopping trip.
#### 31

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total amount the customer spent during their shopping trip. Their last trip was $80, and this trip was $43. Adding these together gives a total of $123.

Next, I'll determine how much rewards the customer earned. The store offers $1 off their next purchase for every $20 spent. Applying this to the total of $123, the customer earned $6 in rewards.

Since the customer used their rewards and then applied a coupon that took twice the rewards amount off the price, the coupon effectively reduced the price by $12.

Finally, I'll subtract the coupon reduction from the total spending to find out how much the customer actually paid on this trip. This results in a final payment of $111.

To determine how much the customer paid on their shopping trip, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the Total Spending:**
   
   - Last trip: \$80
   - This trip: \$43
   
   **Total Spending:** 
   \[
   80 + 43 = 123 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the Rewards Earned:**
   
   - **Rewards Offer:** \$1 off for every \$20 spent.
   
   **Rewards Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Rewards} = \left(\frac{123}{20}\right) = 6.15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Apply the Coupon:**
   
   - **Coupon Reduction:** The coupon takes twice the rewards amount off the price.
   - **Coupon Reduction:** 
     \[
     2 \times 6.15 = 12.30 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   
   **Final Payment:**
   \[
   123 - 12.30 = 110.70 \text{ dollars}
   \]

However, since the coupon is applied after using the rewards, the correct way is:

1. **Calculate the Rewards Earned:**
   
   \[
   \text{Rewards} = \left(\frac{123}{20}\right) = 6.15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Apply the Coupon:**
   
   \[
   6.15 \times 2 = 12.30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Amount Paid:**
   
   \[
   123 - 12.30 = 110.70 \text{ dollars}
   \]

But since the customer can't pay a fraction of a cent in this context, we'll round to the nearest cent:

\[
\boxed{110.70}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{110.70}
\]
