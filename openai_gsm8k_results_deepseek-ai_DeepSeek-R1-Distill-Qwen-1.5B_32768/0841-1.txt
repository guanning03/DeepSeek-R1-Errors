Question:
John is raising money for a school trip. He has applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover half the cost of the trip. How much money is John missing if he has $50 and the trip costs $300?

Correct Answer:
John's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.
In total John has covered 150 + 50 = $<<150+50=200>>200 for his trip
Therefore, John needs 300 - 200 = $<<300-200=100>>100 more for the trip.
#### 100

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total cost of the trip, which is $300.

Next, the school has agreed to cover half of this cost, so I'll calculate half of $300, which is $150.

John already has $50. To find out how much more money he needs beyond what the school will cover, I'll subtract his $50 from the required $150. This means John needs an additional $100 to cover the school's contribution.

Finally, to find out how much more money John is missing beyond his own funds, I'll subtract the $50 he has from the $100 he needs. This results in John missing $50.

**Solution:**

1. **Total Trip Cost:**  
   The total cost of the trip is \$300.

2. **School Contribution:**  
   The school will cover half of the trip cost.  
   \[
   \text{School Contribution} = \frac{300}{2} = \$150
   \]

3. **John's Current Funds:**  
   John has \$50.

4. **Amount John Needs Beyond School Contribution:**  
   Subtract John's funds from the school's contribution.  
   \[
   \$150 - \$50 = \$100
   \]

5. **Total Amount John is Missing:**  
   Since John has only covered \$50, he is missing an additional \$100.  
   \[
   \boxed{\$50}
   \]
