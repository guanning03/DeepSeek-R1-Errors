Question:
Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?

Correct Answer:
In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

Wrong Answer:
First, identify the total number of small rodents and the total amount of straw distributed to them. There are 160 pieces of straw used for the rats.

Next, determine the total number of rats. Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, divide the total straw by the amount per rat:

160 pieces ÷ 6 pieces per rat = 26.666... rats

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, round up to the nearest whole rat, which is 27 rats.

Finally, calculate the number of rats per cage by dividing the total number of rats by the number of cages. There are 3 cages in each group:

27 rats ÷ 3 cages = 9 rats per cage

Therefore, there are 9 rats in each cage.

Let's determine the number of rats in each cage step by step.

**Given:**
- **Total straw distributed to rats:** 160 pieces
- **Straw per rat:** 6 pieces
- **Number of cages for rats:** 3

**Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Rats**
\[
\text{Total Rats} = \frac{\text{Total Straw for Rats}}{\text{Straw per Rat}} = \frac{160}{6} = 26.\overline{6} \text{ rats}
\]

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number:
\[
\text{Total Rats} = 27 \text{ rats}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Rats per Cage**
\[
\text{Rats per Cage} = \frac{\text{Total Rats}}{\text{Number of Cages}} = \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ rats per cage}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{9}
\]
