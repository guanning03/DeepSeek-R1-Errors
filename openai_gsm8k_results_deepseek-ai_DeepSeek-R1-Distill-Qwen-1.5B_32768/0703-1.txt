Question:
Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at 20$, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. What's the total amount of money she earned in the second year?

Correct Answer:
If her sales in the current year are 45, she sold 45*2 = <<45*2=90>>90 books in the first year.
The total number of books sold in the first and current year is 90+45 = <<90+45=135>>135.
The total number of books sold in the second year is 250 of the original number of books - 135 sold books - 50 unsold books = <<250-135-50=65>>65 books.
If each book sells at 20$, then she earned 20*65 = $<<20*65=1300>>1300 in the second year

Wrong Prediction:
900

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine the number of books sold in the current year. Since there are currently 50 unsold books and 45 books sold this year, the total number of books sold in the current year is 50 plus 45, which equals 95 books.

Next, I'll find out how many books were sold in the first year. It's given that the number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold this year. Therefore, the first year's sales would be 2 multiplied by 95, resulting in 190 books.

Finally, to calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year, I'll multiply the number of books sold this year by the price per book. Multiplying 45 books by $20 each gives a total of $900.

To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total Number of Books:**
   
   Elise has a total collection of **250 books**.

2. **Books Sold in the Second Year:**
   
   It's given that **45 books** were sold this year.

3. **Calculating the Number of Books Sold in the First Year:**
   
   It's stated that **Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year**.

   \[
   \text{Books sold in the first year} = 2 \times \text{Books sold this year} = 2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ books}
   \]

4. **Determining the Number of Unsold Books:**
   
   It's mentioned that there are currently **50 unsold books**.

5. **Calculating the Total Revenue from the Second Year:**
   
   The revenue from the second year is calculated by multiplying the number of books sold by the selling price per book.

   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Books sold this year} \times \text{Price per book} = 45 \times 20 = 900
   \]

6. **Final Answer:**

   \[
   \boxed{900}
   \]
