Question:
Heather bought a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins in it. She wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with the raisins. A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. How many batches of oatmeal cookies can Heather make if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix?

Correct Answer:
Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.
Thus, she will be able to make (9/3) * 4 = <<9/3*4=12>>12 batches of oatmeal cookies.
#### 12

Wrong Answer:
To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, I need to know the total amount of raisins available and the amount required for each batch.

Heather has 27 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup. To find out how many batches she can make, I'll divide the total raisins by the amount needed per batch.

So, 27 divided by 3/4 is the same as 27 multiplied by 4/3.

27 multiplied by 4/3 equals 36. Therefore, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.

To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total amount of raisins:**
   - Total raisins = 27 cups

2. **Determine the amount of raisins needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies:**
   - Raisins per batch = \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup

3. **Calculate the number of batches:**
   - Number of batches = Total raisins รท Raisins per batch
   - Number of batches = \( 27 \div \frac{3}{4} \)

4. **Perform the division:**
   - Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal.
   - \( 27 \div \frac{3}{4} = 27 \times \frac{4}{3} \)
   - \( 27 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 4 = 36 \)

So, Heather can make \(\boxed{36}\) batches of oatmeal cookies.
