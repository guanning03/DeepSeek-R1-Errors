Question:
It takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube.  The second and third sides each take twice that long.  The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first, and once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides.  How long does the Rubik's cube take?

Correct Answer:
The second and third side each take 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes
So they take 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 minutes together
The last 2 sides take 5/2=<<5/2=2.5>>2.5 minutes
So they take 2.5*2=<<2.5*2=5>>5 minutes
So the total time is 5+20+5=<<5+20+5=30>>30 minutes

32.5

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the time it takes for each of the six sides of the Rubik's cube.

The first side takes John 5 minutes.

The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each.

The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so that's 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, I'll add up the time for all six sides: 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5.

Adding these together: 5 + 10 + 10 = 25; 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 7.5.

Finally, the total time is 25 + 7.5 = 32.5 minutes.

To determine the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, let's break down the time taken for each side:

1. **First side:**  
   \[
   5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Second and Third sides:**  
   Each takes twice the time of the first side.  
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ minutes each}
   \]

3. **Fourth and Fifth sides:**  
   Each takes half the time of the first side.  
   \[
   \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \text{ minutes each}
   \]

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

\[
5 \text{ (first side)} + 10 \text{ (second side)} + 10 \text{ (third side)} + 2.5 \text{ (fourth side)} + 2.5 \text{ (fifth side)} + 2.5 \text{ (sixth side)} = 32.5 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{32.5 \text{ minutes}}
\]
