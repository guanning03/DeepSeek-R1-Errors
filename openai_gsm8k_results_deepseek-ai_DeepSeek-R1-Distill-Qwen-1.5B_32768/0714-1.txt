Question:
Sunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for two days?

Correct Answer:
He sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.
The total number of boxes of gingerbread that Sunny sold is 10 + 15 = <<10+15=25>>25.
Sunny earned 25 x $6 = $<<25*6=150>>150 for selling gingerbread.
He sold 15 - 4 = <<15-4=11>>11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.
The total number of boxes of apple pie that Sunny sold is 15 + 11 = <<15+11=26>>26.
He earned 26 x $15 = $<<26*15=390>>390 for selling apple pie.
So, Sunny earned $150 + $390 = $<<150+390=540>>540 for two days.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the number of boxes Sunny sold on both Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which means he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread.

For apple pie, on Saturday he sold 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday. Since he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of boxes sold each day:
- Saturday: 10 gingerbread boxes + 11 apple pie boxes = 21 boxes
- Sunday: 15 gingerbread boxes + 15 apple pie boxes = 30 boxes

Now, I'll calculate the total earnings from each item:
- Gingerbread: 21 boxes × $6 = $126
- Apple pie: 30 boxes × $15 = $450

Finally, I'll add the earnings from both items to find the total amount Sunny earned over the two days: $126 + $450 = $576
</think>

Let's break down Sunny's sales and earnings step by step.

### **1. Determine the Number of Boxes Sold Each Day**

- **Gingerbread:**
  - **Saturday:** 10 boxes
  - **Sunday:** 5 more than Saturday → \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes

- **Apple Pie:**
  - **Saturday:** 4 fewer than Sunday → Let Sunday's sales be \(S\). Then, Saturday's sales are \(S - 4\).
  - Given that Sunday's sales were 15 boxes, Saturday's sales are \(15 - 4 = 11\) boxes.

### **2. Calculate Total Boxes Sold Each Day**

- **Saturday:**
  - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
  - Apple Pie: 11 boxes
  - **Total:** \(10 + 11 = 21\) boxes

- **Sunday:**
  - Gingerbread: 15 boxes
  - Apple Pie: 15 boxes
  - **Total:** \(15 + 15 = 30\) boxes

### **3. Calculate Earnings from Each Item**

- **Gingerbread:**
  - **Price per box:** \$6
  - **Total sales:** 21 boxes
  - **Earnings:** \(21 \times 6 = \$126\)

- **Apple Pie:**
  - **Price per box:** \$15
  - **Total sales:** 30 boxes
  - **Earnings:** \(30 \times 15 = \$450\)

### **4. Calculate Total Earnings for Two Days**

\[
\$126 \text{ (Gingerbread)} + \$450 \text{ (Apple Pie)} = \$576
\]

### **Final Answer**

Sunny earned a total of \(\boxed{576}\) dollars for the two days.
