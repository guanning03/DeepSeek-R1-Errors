Question:
Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest. Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?

Correct Answer:
Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400
Sydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = <<35*12=420>>420
This totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820
The average total distance is 410 because 820 / 2 = <<820/2=410>>410
#### 410

Wrong Answer:
First, calculate the total distance Zoey spits by multiplying the number of her seeds by the distance each is spit: 40 seeds × 10 feet = 400 feet.

Next, calculate the total distance Sydney spits by multiplying her seeds by the distance each is spit: 35 seeds × 12 feet = 420 feet.

Add these two distances together to find the combined total distance: 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

Finally, divide the combined distance by the total number of seeds to find the average distance per seed: 820 feet ÷ 75 seeds ≈ 10.93 feet.

To determine the **average total distance** that Zoey and Sydney spat, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance each person spat.**

   - **Zoey:**
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Number of Seeds} \times \text{Distance per Seed} = 40 \times 10\ \text{feet} = 400\ \text{feet}
     \]
   
   - **Sydney:**
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Number of Seeds} \times \text{Distance per Seed} = 35 \times 12\ \text{feet} = 420\ \text{feet}
     \]

2. **Find the combined total distance spat.**
   \[
   \text{Combined Total Distance} = 400\ \text{feet} + 420\ \text{feet} = 820\ \text{feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the average distance per seed.**
   \[
   \text{Average Distance} = \frac{\text{Combined Total Distance}}{\text{Total Number of Seeds}} = \frac{820\ \text{feet}}{75\ \text{seeds}} \approx 10.93\ \text{feet}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{10.93\ \text{feet}}
\]
