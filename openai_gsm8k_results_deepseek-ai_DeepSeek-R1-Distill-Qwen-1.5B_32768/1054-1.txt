Question:
Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?

Correct Answer:
Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80
#### 80

80

Wrong Prediction:
7340

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the distance each runner covers.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Each back-and-forth is 100 yards, so his total distance is 15 times 100 yards, which equals 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards, and then swims to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards each way, totaling 160 yards. She does this 34 times. So, her total distance is 160 yards multiplied by 34, which equals 5440 yards.

Finally, I'll subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance to find the difference. 5440 yards minus 1500 yards is 3940 yards.

Let's determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser by comparing the distances covered by Blake and Kelly.

### **Blake's Distance**

- **Distance per back-and-forth:** 100 yards
- **Number of back-and-forth runs:** 15

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance per run} \times \text{Number of runs} = 100 \, \text{yards} \times 15 = 1500 \, \text{yards}
\]

### **Kelly's Distance**

- **First run:** 100 yards (back and forth)
- **Distance to the 40-yard line and back:** 80 yards each way
- **Number of such runs:** 34

\[
\text{Total distance} = (\text{First run} + 2 \times \text{Distance to 40-yard line}) \times \text{Number of runs} = (100 \, \text{yards} + 2 \times 80 \, \text{yards}) \times 34
\]

\[
= (100 + 160) \, \text{yards} \times 34 = 260 \, \text{yards} \times 34 = 8840 \, \text{yards}
\]

### **Difference in Distance**

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Kelly's distance} - \text{Blake's distance} = 8840 \, \text{yards} - 1500 \, \text{yards} = 7340 \, \text{yards}
\]

\[
\boxed{7340 \text{ yards}}
\]
