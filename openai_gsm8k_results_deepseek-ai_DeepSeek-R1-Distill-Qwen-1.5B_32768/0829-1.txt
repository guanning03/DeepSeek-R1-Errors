Question:
Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?

Correct Answer:
The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.
The total sale discount comes to 60 * 0.3 = <<60*0.3=18>>18 dollars.
The final sale price comes to 60 - 18 = <<60-18=42>>42 dollars.
Joe ends up with 50 - 42 = <<50-42=8>>8 dollars change.
#### 8

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts without discounts by adding their individual prices: $25 for the shirt and $35 for the shorts, which gives a subtotal of $60.

Next, I'll apply the 30% off sale to the total amount: 30% of $60 is $18, so the discounted price becomes $60 minus $18, resulting in $42.

Then, I'll add the sales tax of 8% to the discounted price: 8% of $42 is $3.36, so the final amount to be paid is $42 plus $3.36, totaling $45.36.

Finally, I'll subtract the total amount Joe spends from his initial $50 to find out how much money he has left: $50 minus $45.36 equals $4.64.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Amount Before Discount**

Joe wants to buy a shirt and a pair of shorts. The prices are:
- **Shirt:** \$25
- **Pair of Shorts:** \$35

**Total before discount:**
\[
\$25 + \$35 = \$60
\]

### **Step 2: Apply the 30% Off Sale**

The store is offering a 30% discount on the total purchase.

**Discount amount:**
\[
30\% \text{ of } \$60 = 0.30 \times \$60 = \$18
\]

**Total after discount:**
\[
\$60 - \$18 = \$42
\]

### **Step 3: Add the Sales Tax**

The sales tax rate is 8%. We need to calculate the sales tax on the discounted total.

**Sales tax:**
\[
8\% \text{ of } \$42 = 0.08 \times \$42 = \$3.36
\]

**Total amount to be paid:**
\[
\$42 + \$3.36 = \$45.36
\]

### **Step 4: Calculate the Change Received**

Joe initially has \$50. Subtract the total amount he spends from this amount to find out how much change he receives.

\[
\$50 - \$45.36 = \$4.64
\]

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{\$4.64}
\]
