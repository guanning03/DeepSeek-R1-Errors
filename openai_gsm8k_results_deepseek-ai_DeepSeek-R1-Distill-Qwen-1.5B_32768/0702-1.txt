Question:
Morgan's dad said that she had $90 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is $5. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?

Correct Answer:
The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20
Each person costs $30 because 5 + 5 + 20 = <<5+5+20=30>>30
Three total people can attend because 90 / 30 = <<90/30=3>>3
She can invite 2 friends because 3 - 1 =<<3-1=2>>2

Wrong Answer:
Morgan has a budget of $90 for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends can play mini-golf, use arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice.

First, the cost of one round of mini-golf is $5. Since she wants to play one round, that costs $5.

Next, she wants to have $5 in arcade tokens. This is a fixed amount she can spend.

She also wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10. So, two rides would cost 2 times $10, which is $20.

Adding up the costs for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts, we get $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Subtracting this from her total budget of $90, she has $60 left for other expenses, such as invitations or additional items.

Since she wants to invite friends, each friend will take one spot at the party. Since she already has herself, the number of friends she can invite is $60 divided by 1, which is 60.

So, Morgan can invite 60 friends to her birthday party.

To determine how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party, let's break down the costs and budget step by step.

### **Given:**
- **Total Budget:** \$90
- **Costs:**
  - **Mini-golf:** \$5 per round
  - **Arcade Tokens:** \$5
  - **Go-karts:** \$10 per ride, ridden twice

### **Calculations:**

1. **Total Cost for Mini-golf:**
   \[
   \text{Mini-golf cost} = \$5
   \]

2. **Total Cost for Arcade Tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Arcade tokens cost} = \$5
   \]

3. **Total Cost for Go-karts:**
   \[
   \text{Go-karts cost} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

4. **Total Expenses:**
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = \$5 \, (\text{Mini-golf}) + \$5 \, (\text{Arcade tokens}) + \$20 \, (\text{Go-karts}) = \$30
   \]

5. **Remaining Budget for Friends:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 \, (\text{Total budget}) - \$30 \, (\text{Total expenses}) = \$60
   \]

6. **Number of Friends (Each Taking One Spot):**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{1} = 60
   \]

### **Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{60}
\]
