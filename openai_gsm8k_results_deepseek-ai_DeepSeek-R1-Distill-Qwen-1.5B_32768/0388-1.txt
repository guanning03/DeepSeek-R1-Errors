Question:
Apple High School is holding graduation in their Fine Arts Center this year which has space for 6000 people.  After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?

Correct Answer:
Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates
Minus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6000 - 1250 = <<6000-1250=4750>>4750 remaining seats.
Divide amount of graduates by remaining seats. 4750/950 = <<4750/950=5>>5 tickets

Wrong Prediction:
316

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total number of tickets available for graduates and faculty. The school has a capacity of 6000 seats, and 950 seats are reserved for graduates and 300 seats for faculty. Adding these together gives a total of 950 + 300 = 1250 seats available.

Next, I need to calculate how many tickets are left for the graduates. Subtracting the 1250 seats reserved from the total capacity: 6000 - 1250 = 4750 tickets are available for the graduates.

Finally, to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive if the tickets are split equally among the graduates, I divide the total number of tickets available for graduates by the number of graduates. If there are 15 graduates, for example, each graduate would receive 4750 รท 15 = 316.67 tickets. However, since you can't have a fraction of a ticket, each graduate would receive 316 tickets, with 14 tickets left over.

To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Seats Available for Graduates and Faculty:**

   The school has a total capacity of **6000** seats.

   - **Seats for Graduates:** 950
   - **Seats for Faculty:** 300

   \[
   \text{Total seats for graduates and faculty} = 950 + 300 = 1250 \text{ seats}
   \]

2. **Determine the Number of Tickets Available for Graduates:**

   Subtract the seats reserved for faculty from the total capacity:

   \[
   \text{Tickets for graduates} = 6000 - 1250 = 4750 \text{ tickets}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Number of Tickets per Graduate:**

   If there are **15** graduates, the number of tickets each graduate would receive is:

   \[
   \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{15} = 316.67
   \]

   Since you can't have a fraction of a ticket, each graduate would receive **316 tickets**, with **14 tickets** left over.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{316}
\]
