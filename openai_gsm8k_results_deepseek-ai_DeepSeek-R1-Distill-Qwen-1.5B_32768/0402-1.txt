Question:
Josh runs a car shop and services 3 cars a day.  He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday.  He gets paid $4 per car.  How much does he make in 2 weeks?

Correct Answer:
He runs 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 days a week
That means he serves 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 cars a week
So he makes 15*4=$<<15*4=60>>60 a week
So he makes 60*2=$<<60*2=120>>120 in 2 weeks

Wrong Prediction:
864

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many cars Josh can service in one week. Since he works six days a week (excluding Sunday and Wednesday), and he services 3 cars each day, the total number of cars he services in a week is 6 multiplied by 3, which equals 18 cars.

Next, I calculate his daily earnings by multiplying the number of cars he services by his pay per car. At $4 per car, his daily earnings are 18 cars multiplied by $4, resulting in $72 per day.

To find out his weekly earnings, I multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a week. With 18 cars per day and 6 working days, his weekly earnings are $72 multiplied by 6, which equals $432.

Finally, to find out his earnings over two weeks, I multiply his weekly earnings by 2. Thus, his total earnings for two weeks are $432 multiplied by 2, resulting in $864.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of working days in a week:**
   - Josh works 6 days a week (excluding Sunday and Wednesday).

2. **Calculate the number of cars he services in a week:**
   - He services 3 cars each day.
   \[
   6 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ cars/day} = 18 \text{ cars/week}
   \]

3. **Compute his daily earnings:**
   - He is paid \$4 per car.
   \[
   18 \text{ cars} \times \$4/\text{car} = \$72 \text{ per day}
   \]

4. **Find his weekly earnings:**
   \[
   \$72 \text{ per day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$432 \text{ per week}
   \]

5. **Calculate his earnings for 2 weeks:**
   \[
   \$432 \text{ per week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = \$864
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{864}
\]
