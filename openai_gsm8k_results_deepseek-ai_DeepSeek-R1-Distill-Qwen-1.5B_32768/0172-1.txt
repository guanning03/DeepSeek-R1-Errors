Question:
James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. If he loses 8 of the water type and buys 14 grass type, what's the percentage chance (rounded to the nearest integer) that a randomly picked card will be a water type?

Correct Answer:
First find the final number of grass type Pokemon: 20 grass type + 14 grass type = <<20+14=34>>34 grass type
Then find the final number of water type Pokemon: 40 water type - 8 water type = <<40-8=32>>32 water type
Then add the number of each type of Pokemon to find the total number: 34 Pokemon + 32 Pokemon + 30 Pokemon = <<34+32+30=96>>96 Pokemon
Then divide the number of water type Pokemon by the total number of Pokemon and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 32 water type / 96 Pokemon * 100% = 33.333...%, which rounds down to 33%

Wrong Prediction:
73

Wrong Answer:
First, I will determine the total number of Pokemon cards James has by adding up the fire, grass, and water type cards. That gives a total of 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards.

Next, I'll calculate the number of water type cards after James loses 8 of them and gains 14 grass type cards. Subtracting 8 from 40 results in 32 water type cards, and adding 14 grass type cards brings the total to 32 + 14 = 46 water type cards.

Finally, to find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, I'll divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100. This gives (46 / 90) * 100 â‰ˆ 51.11%, which rounds to 51%.

**Solution:**

James has the following number of Pokemon cards:

- **Fire type:** 30
- **Grass type:** 20
- **Water type:** 40

**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of Pokemon cards.

\[
\text{Total cards} = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90
\]

**Step 2:** Determine the number of water type cards after the changes.

- **Water type after losing 8:** \( 40 - 8 = 32 \)
- **Grass type after buying 14:** \( 20 + 14 = 34 \)

So, the number of water type cards becomes:

\[
32 \text{ (water type)} + 34 \text{ (grass type)} = 66 \text{ water type cards}
\]

**Step 3:** Calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card.

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{66}{90} \right) \times 100 \approx 73.33\%
\]

**Rounded to the nearest integer:**

\[
\boxed{73\%}
\]
