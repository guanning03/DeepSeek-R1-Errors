Question:
Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?

Correct Answer:
When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.
Thus it has been 31 - 17 = <<31-17=14>>14 years since Raymond's son was born.

Gold:
14

Wrong Prediction:
31

Wrong Answer:
First, determine Samantha's age by subtracting 6 years from her current age of 31, which gives 25 years old.

Next, find out when Samantha was born by subtracting her age from the current year. Assuming the current year is 2023, Samantha was born in 2023 - 25 = 1998.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, his birth year is 1998 - 6 = 1992.

Finally, calculate the number of years ago the son was born by subtracting 1992 from 2023, resulting in 31 years ago.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Samantha's Age:**
   
   - **Current Age of Samantha:** 31 years
   - **Age Difference Between Raymond and Samantha:** 6 years

   - **Samantha's Age:** 
     \[
     \text{Samantha's Age} = \text{Current Age} - 6 = 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years}
     \]

2. **Find Samantha's Birth Year:**
   
   - **Current Year:** Let's assume the current year is 2023 for simplicity.
   - **Samantha's Birth Year:**
     \[
     \text{Samantha's Birth Year} = \text{Current Year} - \text{Samantha's Age} = 2023 - 25 = 1998
     \]

3. **Determine Raymond's Birth Year:**
   
   - **Raymond's Age When Son Was Born:** 23 years
   
   - **Raymond's Birth Year:**
     \[
     \text{Raymond's Birth Year} = \text{Samantha's Birth Year} - 6 = 1998 - 6 = 1992
     \]

4. **Calculate the Number of Years Ago the Son Was Born:**
   
   - **Current Year:** 2023
   - **Son's Birth Year:** 1992
   - **Years Ago:**
     \[
     \text{Years Ago} = 2023 - 1992 = 31 \text{ years ago}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{31}
\]
