Question:
Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges at the market. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each. Then she kept 1/4 of the oranges and sold the rest. How many oranges did Mrs. Harrington sell if each box contains 20 oranges?

Correct Answer:
Mrs. Harrington gave a total of 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 boxes of oranges to her mom and sister.
She then had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes of oranges left.
She kept 8 x 1/4 = <<8*1/4=2>>2 boxes of oranges.
So, she had 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 boxes of oranges to be sold.
Hence, Mrs. Harrington sold 6 boxes x 20 oranges = <<6*20=120>>120 oranges.
#### 120

Wrong Answer:
First, I determine the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought. She purchased 12 boxes, and each box contains 20 oranges. Multiplying these gives the total number of oranges: 12 boxes × 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.

Next, she gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. That's a total of 4 boxes given away. Each box contains 20 oranges, so the number of oranges given away is 4 boxes × 20 oranges per box = 80 oranges.

Subtracting the given oranges from the total gives the number of oranges she kept: 240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of these oranges, which is 160 oranges × 1/4 = 40 oranges.

Finally, the number of oranges she sold is the remaining after keeping some: 160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of Oranges Purchased:**
   
   Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
   
   \[
   12 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 240 \text{ oranges}
   \]

2. **Oranges Given Away:**
   
   - She gave 2 boxes to her mom.
   - She gave 2 boxes to her sister.
   
   \[
   \text{Total boxes given away} = 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Oranges given away} = 4 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 80 \text{ oranges}
   \]

3. **Oranges Kept:**
   
   She kept \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the oranges.
   
   \[
   \text{Oranges kept} = \frac{1}{4} \times 240 = 60 \text{ oranges}
   \]

4. **Oranges Sold:**
   
   The number of oranges sold is the remaining after keeping some.
   
   \[
   \text{Oranges sold} = \text{Total oranges} - \text{Oranges kept}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Oranges sold} = 240 - 60 = 180 \text{ oranges}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{180}
\]
