Question:
Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours. If Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, what's the average speed he was traveling?

Correct Answer:
After traveling 110 miles at first, Sid traveled 110 + 140 = <<110+140=250>>250 miles in total
Since he spends 3 hours traveling after the first 2 hours, he traveled 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 hours
On average, Sid traveled 250 miles / 5 hours = <<250/5=50>>50 miles per hour.
#### 50

Wrong Answer:
To determine Sid's average speed for the entire trip, I first need to calculate the total distance he traveled. He covered 110 miles in the first part and an additional 140 miles in the second part, so the total distance is 110 + 140 = 250 miles.

Next, I'll find the total time he spent traveling. He traveled for 2 hours initially and then took another 3 hours, making the total time 2 + 3 = 5 hours.

Finally, to find the average speed, I'll divide the total distance by the total time. So, 250 miles divided by 5 hours equals 50 miles per hour.

To determine Sid's average speed for the entire trip, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Distance Traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 110\ \text{miles} + 140\ \text{miles} = 250\ \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the Total Time Spent Traveling:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 2\ \text{hours} + 3\ \text{hours} = 5\ \text{hours}
   \]

3. **Compute the Average Speed:**
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{250\ \text{miles}}{5\ \text{hours}} = 50\ \text{miles per hour}
   \]

\[
\boxed{50\ \text{mph}}
\]
