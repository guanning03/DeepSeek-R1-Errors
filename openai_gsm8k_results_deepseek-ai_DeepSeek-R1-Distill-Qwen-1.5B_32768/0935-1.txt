Question:
Marcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes among the types listed. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?

Correct Answer:
First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.
#### 131250

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine the number of each type of bike sold.

Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, which is 150 bikes.

15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, which is 45 bikes.

The remaining bikes sold were MTB bikes, which is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes.

Next, I'll calculate the revenue from each type of bike.

MTB bikes: 105 bikes × $500 = $52,500.

BMX bikes: 45 bikes × $250 = $11,250.

Trekking bikes: 150 bikes × $450 = $67,500.

Finally, I'll add up the revenues from all bike types to find the total earnings.

$52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during the month.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**

   - **Total bikes sold:** 300
   
   - **Trekking bikes:** 15% of 300
     \[
     0.15 \times 300 = 45 \text{ bikes}
     \]
   
   - **BMX bikes:** 15% of 300
     \[
     0.15 \times 300 = 45 \text{ bikes}
     \]
   
   - **MTB bikes:** Remaining bikes
     \[
     300 - 45 - 45 = 210 \text{ bikes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from each type of bike:**

   - **MTB bikes:**
     \[
     210 \text{ bikes} \times \$500 = \$105,000
     \]
   
   - **BMX bikes:**
     \[
     45 \text{ bikes} \times \$250 = \$11,250
     \]
   
   - **Trekking bikes:**
     \[
     45 \text{ bikes} \times \$450 = \$20,250
     \]

3. **Find the total revenue:**

   \[
   \$105,000 + \$11,250 + \$20,250 = \$136,500
   \]

**Final Answer:**

Marcel earned a total of \(\boxed{136500}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month.
