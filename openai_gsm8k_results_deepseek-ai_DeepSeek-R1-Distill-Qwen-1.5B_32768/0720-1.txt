Question:
Theo has $6000 he wishes to spend on his upcoming business trip to South Africa. He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, 3 suitcases at $50 each, a flight ticket that costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. He wishes to save $2000 for this trip, how much does he have to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa?

Correct Answer:
Theo buys business suits for 6 suits * $100/suit = $<<6*100=600>>600.
Theo buys suitcases for 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $<<3*50=150>>150.
Theo buys a flight ticket that costs $700 + 5 * $100 = $<<700+5*100=1200>>1200.
Theo can spend $6000 - $600 - $150 - $1200 - $2000 = $<<6000-600-150-1200-2000=2050>>2050 on gifts for his friends.

Wrong Answer:
To determine how much Theo needs to spend on gifts, I'll follow these steps:

First, calculate the total amount Theo spends on business suits. He buys 6 suits at $100 each, so that's 6 multiplied by $100, which equals $600.

Next, calculate the total cost for the 3 suitcases. Each suitcase costs $50, so 3 multiplied by $50 is $150.

Then, determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Five times $100 is $500, and adding $700 gives a total cost of $1200 for the flight ticket.

Adding up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket, the total spending is $600 + $150 + $1200, which equals $2050.

Theo's total budget is $6000, and he wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he has left for other expenses, including gifts, is $6000 minus $2000, which is $4000.

Finally, subtract the amount spent on business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket from the remaining budget to find out how much he needs to spend on gifts. This is $4000 minus $2050, resulting in $1950.

To determine how much Theo needs to spend on gifts for his business partners, let's break down his expenses step by step.

**Given:**
- **Total budget:** \$6,000
- **Savings:** \$2,000
- **Costs:**
  - Business suits: 6 suits at \$100 each.
  - Suitcases: 3 suitcases at \$50 each.
  - Flight ticket: \$700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Spending on Business Suits**
\[
\text{Cost of business suits} = 6 \times \$100 = \$600
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Total Spending on Suitcases**
\[
\text{Cost of suitcases} = 3 \times \$50 = \$150
\]

**Step 3: Calculate Cost of Flight Ticket**
\[
\text{Cost of flight ticket} = 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200
\]

**Step 4: Calculate Total Spent on Business Items**
\[
\text{Total business expenses} = \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050
\]

**Step 5: Determine Remaining Budget for Gifts**
\[
\text{Budget for gifts} = \text{Total budget} - \text{Savings} - \text{Total business expenses}
\]
\[
\text{Budget for gifts} = \$6,000 - \$2,000 - \$2050 = \$1,950
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1950}
\]
