Question:
My wife wants to evenly split the check but wants me to pay an additional 20% tip on our $50 dinner bill. How much did I end up paying?

Correct Answer:
If the total bill is $50, the total tip of 20% would be $50*20% = $<<50*20*.01=10>>10
Similarly, if the bill was $50 an even split (1/2) would be $50 * 1/2 = $<<50*1/2=25>>25 to be paid by each person
That means I paid $25 for the bill + $10 for the tip = $<<25+10=35>>35
#### 35

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total amount of the dinner bill, which is $50.

Next, I need to determine the 20% tip to be added on top of the bill. To find 20% of $50, I multiply 50 by 0.20, which equals $10.

Then, I add the tip to the original bill amount to find the total amount to be paid. Adding $50 and $10 gives a total of $60.

Finally, I find out how much I paid by dividing the total amount by 2. Dividing $60 by 2 results in $30.

Therefore, I paid $30.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the Tip:**
   
   You want to leave a 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.
   
   \[
   \text{Tip} = 20\% \times \$50 = 0.20 \times 50 = \$10
   \]

2. **Determine the Total Amount to Pay:**
   
   Add the tip to the original bill.
   
   \[
   \text{Total} = \$50 + \$10 = \$60
   \]

3. **Split the Total Amount Between You and Your Wife:**
   
   You want to evenly split the check.
   
   \[
   \text{Amount Paid by You} = \frac{\$60}{2} = \$30
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$30}
\]
