Question:
Carson lives in an old house where the pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees. Every log of wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees. If it was 45 degrees during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, how many logs does Carson need to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing?

Correct Answer:
First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees
Then find how much Carson needs to heat his house to avoid the pipes freezing: 32 degrees - 12 degrees = <<32-12=20>>20 degrees
Then divide the amount of heat Carson needs by the amount of heat each log produces: 20 degrees / 5 degrees/log = <<20/5=4>>4 logs

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how much the temperature drops during the night. If the day's temperature is 45 degrees and it's 33 degrees colder at night, the night temperature is 45 degrees minus 33 degrees, which equals 12 degrees.

Next, I'll calculate the total temperature increase required to prevent the pipes from freezing. Since the pipes freeze at 32 degrees and the day's temperature is 45 degrees, the house needs to be maintained at or above 32 degrees. Therefore, the temperature increase needed is 45 degrees minus 32 degrees, which equals 13 degrees.

Now, I'll find out how many logs of wood are needed to provide this temperature increase. Each log heats the house by 5 degrees, so I'll divide the required temperature increase by the heating capacity of one log: 13 degrees divided by 5 degrees per log equals 2.6 logs.

Since Carson can't burn a fraction of a log, I'll round up to the next whole number, which means he needs to burn 3 logs to ensure the temperature remains above 32 degrees.

To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the Temperature Increase Needed:**
   
   - **Day Temperature:** 45 degrees
   - **Night Temperature:** 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees
   - **Desired Temperature to Prevent Freezing:** 32 degrees
   
   The house needs to be heated enough to reach at least 32 degrees during the night. Therefore, the required temperature increase is:
   
   \[
   45\,^{\circ} - 32\,^{\circ} = 13\,^{\circ}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Number of Logs Needed:**
   
   Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to provide the required temperature increase:
   
   \[
   \frac{13\,^{\circ}}{5\,^{\circ} \text{ per log}} = 2.6\, \text{logs}
   \]
   
   Since Carson can't burn a fraction of a log, he needs to round up to the next whole number.
   
   \[
   2.6 \approx 3\, \text{logs}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
