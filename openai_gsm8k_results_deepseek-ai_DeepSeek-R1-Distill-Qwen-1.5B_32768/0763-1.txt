Question:
Cedar Falls Middle School has students in grades 4 – 7 and each year they are challenged to earn as many Accelerated Reader points as they can. The 10 students in each grade with the most points get to try an escape room set up by the teachers. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. They have 45 minutes to try and escape. If every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?

Correct Answer:
There are 4 grades in the middle school x 10 students = <<4*10=40>>40 students who get to try the escape room.
There will be 40 students / 8 students in a group = <<40/8=5>>5 groups who get to try the escape room.
It will take 5 groups x 45 minutes = <<5*45=225>>225 minutes.
#### 225

Wrong Answer:
To determine how long it will take for all 10 students in each grade to try the escape room, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of groups that can try the escape room simultaneously:**
   - There are 8 students per group and 10 students in total.
   - Dividing 10 by 8 gives 1.25 groups.
   - Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to 2 groups.

2. **Determine how many cycles are needed for all students to try the escape room:**
   - Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room.
   - If there are 2 groups working simultaneously, both groups will finish trying the escape room at the same time.
   - Therefore, it will take 45 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

3. **Account for all grades:**
   - The problem mentions grades 4–7, but the calculation applies to each grade separately.
   - Since each group in a grade takes 45 minutes, the same duration applies to all grades.

Thus, it will take 45 minutes for everyone in each grade to try the escape room.

To determine how long it will take for all 10 students in each grade to try the escape room, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Number of Groups**
- **Total Students:** 10
- **Students per Group:** 8

\[
\text{Number of Groups} = \frac{\text{Total Students}}{\text{Students per Group}} = \frac{10}{8} = 1.25
\]

Since you can't have a fraction of a group, you round up to the next whole number:

\[
\text{Number of Groups} = 2
\]

### **Step 2: Determine the Time Needed**
- **Students per Group:** 8
- **Total Students:** 10
- **Students per Grade:** 10

With 2 groups working simultaneously:

\[
2 \text{ groups} = 16 \text{ students}
\]

Since only 10 students are in each grade, both groups will finish trying the escape room at the same time. Therefore, it takes:

\[
\boxed{45\ \text{minutes}}
\]

for everyone in each grade to try the escape room.
