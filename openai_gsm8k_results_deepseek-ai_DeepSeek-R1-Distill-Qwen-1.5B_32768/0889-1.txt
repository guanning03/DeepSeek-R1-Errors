Question:
Tim has a box with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. If he uses 3 blue shoeboxes and 1/3 red of his shoeboxes to go fishing, how many red and blue shoe boxes are left in Tim's box?

Correct Answer:
If Tim uses 3 blue shoeboxes, he remains with 7-3=<<7-3=4>>4 blue shoe boxes in the box.
Tim also uses 1/3 of the red shoeboxes, a total of 1/3*9=<<1/3*9=3>>3 red shoe boxes.
Tim remains with 9-3=<<9-3=6>>6 red shoeboxes.
The total number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10
#### 10

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the initial number of shoeboxes Tim has. He has 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes, which adds up to a total of 16 shoeboxes.

Next, I'll calculate how many shoeboxes he uses for fishing. He uses 3 blue shoeboxes and one-third of the red shoeboxes. Since there are 9 red shoeboxes, one-third of that is 3.

After using 3 blue and 3 red shoeboxes, the remaining blue shoeboxes are 7 minus 3, which equals 4. The remaining red shoeboxes are 9 minus 3, which equals 6.

Therefore, Tim has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left in his box.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial number of shoeboxes:**
   - **Blue shoeboxes:** 7
   - **Red shoeboxes:** 9
   - **Total shoeboxes:** \( 7 + 9 = 16 \)

2. **Calculate the number of shoeboxes used for fishing:**
   - **Blue shoeboxes used:** 3
   - **Red shoeboxes used:** \(\frac{1}{3}\) of 9
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
     \]
   - **Total shoeboxes used:** \( 3 + 3 = 6 \)

3. **Find the number of shoeboxes remaining:**
   - **Remaining blue shoeboxes:** \( 7 - 3 = 4 \)
   - **Remaining red shoeboxes:** \( 9 - 3 = 6 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4 \text{ blue shoeboxes and } 6 \text{ red shoeboxes}}
\]
