Question:
Two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head.  Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree.  This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.  How many apples did he bring home?

Correct Answer:
Two apples fell out of the tree, and Newton threw one away, leaving him with 2-1=<<2-1=1>>1 apples.
5 more apples fell out of the tree, bringing his total to 5+1=<<5+1=6>>6 apples.
Newton threw one at the tree, leaving him with 6-1=<<6-1=5>>5 apples.
6 more apples fell out of the tree, bringing Newton's apple collection to a total of 5+6=<<5+6=11>>11 apples.
#### 11

Wrong Answer:
First, I recognize that the problem involves a sequence of events where apples fall out of a tree and may be picked up or thrown into another location, affecting the total number of apples.

Starting with 10 apples, the first event reduces the total by 5, leaving 5 apples.

In the second event, 5 more apples fall out, bringing the total to 10 apples.

In the third event, 6 apples fall out, leaving 4 apples.

Finally, when Newton picks up all remaining apples, he brings home 4.

The answer is 4.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many apples Newton brings home.

1. **Initial Count:**
   - **Total Apples:** 10

2. **First Event:**
   - **Action:** One apple lands on Newton's head.
   - **Result:** 5 more apples fall out of the tree.
   - **Remaining Apples:** \(10 - 5 = 5\)

3. **Second Event:**
   - **Action:** 5 more apples fall out of the tree.
   - **Result:** 10 apples fall out of the tree.
   - **Remaining Apples:** \(5 + 5 = 10\)

4. **Third Event:**
   - **Action:** 6 more apples fall out of the tree.
   - **Result:** 4 apples remain.
   - **Remaining Apples:** \(10 - 6 = 4\)

5. **Final Action:**
   - **Action:** Newton picks up all remaining apples and goes home to make a pie.
   - **Apples Brought Home:** 4

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
