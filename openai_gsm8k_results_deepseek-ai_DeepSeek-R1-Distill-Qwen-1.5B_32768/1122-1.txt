Question:
John likes to have a glass of water with breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Finally, he has one before he goes to bed as well.  John does this every weekday, but on the weekends he likes to relax and have a soda with dinner instead.  How many glasses of water does John drink in a week?

Correct Answer:
John has 4 glasses of water a day on each of the 5 weekdays, for 4*5= <<4*5=20>>20 glasses.
He has 3 glasses of water on both weekend days, for 3*2= <<3*2=6>>6 glasses of water.
He has 20+6=<<20+6=26>>26 total glasses of water in a week.
#### 26

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine how many days John consumes water during the week. There are 5 weekdays, and on each of these days, he has one glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. That's 3 glasses per day, so 5 days multiplied by 3 equals 15 glasses.

Next, I'll account for the weekend. On Saturday and Sunday, John has a glass of water for breakfast and lunch, totaling 2 glasses per day. This amounts to 2 glasses on Saturday and another 2 glasses on Sunday, adding up to 4 glasses.

Finally, I'll sum the water consumed during the weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of glasses John drinks in a week. That means 15 glasses during the week plus 4 glasses on the weekend, resulting in a total of 19 glasses of water.

To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, let's break down his consumption day by day.

### **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
- **Breakfast:** 1 glass
- **Lunch:** 1 glass
- **Dinner:** 1 glass
- **Total per weekday:** \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\) glasses

Since John consumes water every weekday:
\[
3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ glasses}
\]

### **Weekend (Saturday and Sunday):**
- **Breakfast and Lunch:** 1 glass each
- **Dinner:** Instead of water, he drinks a soda
- **Total per weekend day:** \(1 + 1 = 2\) glasses

Since he consumes water on both Saturday and Sunday:
\[
2 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ glasses}
\]

### **Total Water Consumed in a Week:**
\[
15 \text{ glasses (weekdays)} + 4 \text{ glasses (weekend)} = \boxed{19} \text{ glasses}
\]
