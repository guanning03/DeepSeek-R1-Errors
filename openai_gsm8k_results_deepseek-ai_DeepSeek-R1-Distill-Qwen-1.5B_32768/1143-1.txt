Question:
Dolly has two books. Pandora has one. If both Dolly and Pandora read each others' books as well as their own, how many books will they collectively read by the end?

Correct Answer:
There are 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 books in total.
Dolly and Pandora both read all 3 books, so 3 books/person x 2 people = <<3*2=6>>6 books total
#### 6

Wrong Answer:
To determine the total number of books that Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, I'll break down the problem into parts.

First, Dolly has two books: one from Pandora and one from herself.

Pandora has one book: the one from Dolly.

When they both read each other's books, Dolly will read the two books from Pandora, and Pandora will read the one book from Dolly.

In addition, each of them reads their own book.

So, Dolly reads 2 + 1 = 3 books, and Pandora reads 1 + 1 = 2 books.

Adding these together, the total number of books read by both of them is 3 + 2 = 5.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read.

1. **Initial Books:**
   - **Dolly:** 2 books (1 from Pandora and 1 for herself).
   - **Pandora:** 1 book (1 from Dolly).

2. **Reading Each Other's Books:**
   - **Dolly Reads Pandora's Book:** 1 book.
   - **Pandora Reads Dolly's Book:** 1 book.

3. **Reading Their Own Books (Additional Books):**
   - **Dolly Reads Her Own Book:** 1 book.
   - **Pandora Reads Her Own Book:** 1 book.

4. **Total Books Read by Each:**
   - **Dolly:** 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) + 1 (Pandora's) = **4 books.**
   - **Pandora:** 1 (her own) + 1 (Dolly's) + 1 (Dolly's) = **3 books.**

5. **Total Collectively:**
   - **Total Books = Dolly's Books + Pandora's Books = 4 + 3 = 7 books.**

\boxed{7}
