Question:
Mrs. Tatiana owns a grocery store that sells different fruits and vegetables, which includes carrots. The price of carrots in the grocery store increases by 5% of the original price every year. What would be the price of carrots after three years if it was $120 initially? (Round to the nearest integer)

Correct Answer:
In the first year, the price of carrots increases by 5/100*120 = $<<5/100*120=6>>6
After 3 years, the price of carrots will increase by $6*3 = $<<6*3=18>>18
The total price of carrots after three years will be 120+18 = $<<120+18=138>>138
#### 138

Wrong Answer:
To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, I'll use the concept of compound interest.

First, I'll identify the original price: $120.

Next, I'll calculate the price after each year using the formula:
\[ \text{Price after 1 year} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05) \]
\[ \text{Price after 2 years} = \text{Price after 1 year} \times (1 + 0.05) \]
\[ \text{Price after 3 years} = \text{Price after 2 years} \times (1 + 0.05) \]

After performing the calculations for each year, I'll round the final price to the nearest integer.

Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Mrs. Tatiana owns a grocery store where the price of carrots increases by **5%** every year. If the initial price of carrots is **\$120**, what will be the price after **3 years**? Round your answer to the nearest integer.

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - **Initial Price (Pâ‚€):** \$120
   - **Annual Increase Rate (r):** 5% or 0.05
   - **Number of Years (t):** 3

2. **Formula for Compound Interest:**
   The formula to calculate the price after a certain number of years with compound interest is:
   \[
   A = P \times (1 + r)^t
   \]
   Where:
   - \( A \) = Final amount
   - \( P \) = Initial principal amount
   - \( r \) = Annual interest rate (in decimal)
   - \( t \) = Number of years

3. **Applying the Formula:**
   \[
   A = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3
   \]
   \[
   A = 120 \times (1.05)^3
   \]

4. **Calculating \((1.05)^3\):**
   \[
   (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 = 1.157625
   \]

5. **Computing the Final Price:**
   \[
   A = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915
   \]

6. **Rounding to the Nearest Integer:**
   \[
   A \approx 139
   \]

---

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{139}
\]
