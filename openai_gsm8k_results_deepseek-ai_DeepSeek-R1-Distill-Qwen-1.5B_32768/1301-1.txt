Question:
Sasha notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. Since she has leftovers, she decides to sell them. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?

Correct Answer:
She bought the 2 x 4s for $100 because 10 x 10 = 100
She bought the 4 x 4s for 80 because 5 x 16 = 80
She paid $180 for the lumber because 100 + 80 = <<100+80=180>>180
The same number now sells for $270 because 180 x 1.5 = <<180*1.5=270>>270
She made $90 in profit because 270 - 180 = <<270-180=90>>90
#### 90

Wrong Answer:
To determine Sasha's profit from selling her leftover lumber, I need to calculate both her total revenue and her total cost.

First, I'll calculate the revenue from selling the boards. She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each sold at a 50% markup. The original cost per board is $10, so the selling price is $15 each. Multiplying the number of boards by the selling price gives her $150 from these.

Next, she has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each sold at a 25% markup. The original cost per board is $16, so the selling price is $20 each. Multiplying the number of boards by the selling price gives her $100 from these.

Adding the revenue from both types of boards, her total revenue is $250.

Now, I'll calculate her total cost. She bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each, totaling $100, and five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each, totaling $80. Her total cost is $180.

Finally, to find her profit, I'll subtract her total cost from her total revenue: $250 - $180 equals $70.

Therefore, Sasha makes a $70 profit from selling her lumber.

**Solution:**

Sasha sells her leftover lumber, which consists of two types of boards: 
1. **10 boards of size 2 x 4 x 10**
2. **5 boards of size 4 x 4 x 10**

Each board has a marked price with a markup. To find the total profit, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Selling Price per Board:**
   
   - **For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
     - Original Cost = \$10
     - Markup = 50%
     - Selling Price = Original Cost + Markup = \$10 + (0.5 × \$10) = \$15

   - **For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
     - Original Cost = \$16
     - Markup = 25%
     - Selling Price = Original Cost + Markup = \$16 + (0.25 × \$16) = \$20

2. **Calculate the Total Revenue from Each Type of Board:**
   
   - **From 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
     - Number of Boards = 10
     - Revenue = Number of Boards × Selling Price = 10 × \$15 = \$150

   - **From 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
     - Number of Boards = 5
     - Revenue = Number of Boards × Selling Price = 5 × \$20 = \$100

3. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**
   
   - **Total Revenue = Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards**
   - **Total Revenue = \$150 + \$100 = \$250**

4. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   
   - **Cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
     - Number of Boards = 10
     - Cost = Number of Boards × Original Cost = 10 × \$10 = \$100

   - **Cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
     - Number of Boards = 5
     - Cost = Number of Boards × Original Cost = 5 × \$16 = \$80

   - **Total Cost = Cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards**
   - **Total Cost = \$100 + \$80 = \$180**

5. **Calculate the Profit:**
   
   - **Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost**
   - **Profit = \$250 - \$180 = \$70**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\$70}
