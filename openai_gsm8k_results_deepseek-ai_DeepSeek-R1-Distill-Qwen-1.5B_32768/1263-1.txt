Question:
James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy. James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?

Correct Answer:
James has 4+8=<<4+8=12>>12 toys.
There were 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 dogs.
James needed to buy 24-12=<<24-12=12>>12 more toys.
There are 36 total toys.
36-3=<<36-3=33>>33 toys are now needed.

Wrong Answer:
First, James has 4 toys for his 4 dogs. There are now 8 more dogs in the shelter, making the total number of dogs 12. He buys 12 toys, bringing the total to 16.

When he returns, the shelter has twice as many dogs as before, which is 24 dogs. He buys another 8 toys, increasing the total to 24.

Finally, when he returns again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. The total number of toys James needs is 24 - 3 = 21.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many toys James needs in total.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - James currently has **4 toys** for **4 dogs**.
   - There are **8 more dogs** in the shelter now.
   - **Total dogs at this point:** \(4 + 8 = 12\)
   - **Toys bought initially:** 12

2. **After the First Visit:**
   - James returns and notices there are **twice as many dogs as before**.
   - **Total dogs now:** \(2 \times 12 = 24\)
   - **Toys bought again:** 8 (since he had 12 before, now he needs to buy enough for 24 dogs)
   - **Total toys now:** \(12 + 8 = 20\)

3. **After the Second Return:**
   - James finds that **3 dogs are gone**.
   - **Toys no longer needed:** 3
   - **Toys James needs now:** \(20 - 3 = 17\)

Thus, **James needs a total of \boxed{21} toys**.
