Question:
Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. If his father also gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, and each marble weighs 2kgs, calculate the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store.

Correct Answer:
After buying twenty marbles from his friend Johanna, Solomon had 20+50 = <<20+50=70>>70 marbles.
Solomon's father gave him 2/5*20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 more marbles.
Adding Johanna's and Solomon's marbles, he has a total of 8+70 = <<8+70=78>>78 marbles.
If each marble weigh 2 kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in store is 78 * 2 kgs = <<78*2=156>>156 kgs
#### 156

Gold:
156

Wrong Prediction:
156\

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many marbles Solomon bought from Johanna. He purchased 20 marbles.

Next, I'll calculate the number of marbles his father gave him. His father provided 2/5 times the 20 marbles, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, I'll find the total number of marbles in the store. The store originally had 50 marbles, plus 20 bought and 8 from his father, totaling 50 + 20 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2 kilograms, so the total weight of all the marbles is 78 marbles multiplied by 2 kilograms per marble, which equals 156 kilograms.

Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store.

### **Step 1: Determine the Number of Marbles Solomon Bought**
- **Marbles bought from Johanna:** 20 marbles.

### **Step 2: Calculate the Number of Marbles Given by Solomon's Father**
- **Marbles given by father:** \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the marbles Solomon bought.
  
  \[
  \text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ marbles}
  \]

### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Marbles in the Store**
- **Original marbles in the store:** 50 marbles.
  
  \[
  \text{Total marbles} = 50 + 20 (bought) + 8 (from father) = 78 \text{ marbles}
  \]

### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Weight of the Marbles**
- **Weight per marble:** 2 kilograms.
  
  \[
  \text{Total weight} = 78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kg/marble} = 156 \text{ kg}
  \]

### **Final Answer**
The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
\boxed{156\ \text{kg}}
\]
