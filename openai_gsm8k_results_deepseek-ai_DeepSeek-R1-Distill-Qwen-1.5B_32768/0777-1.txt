Question:
Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 a meter. Sarah plans to use the profit to buy a new rope, which at the store costs $1.5 a meter. How much money will she have left over after she buys the new rope?

Correct Answer:
Her friend pays her $40 for the rope because 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40
She can buy the rope at the store for $30 because 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30
She has $10 left over because 40 - 30 = <<40-30=10>>10

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total cost of the new rope Sarah plans to buy. The new rope costs $1.50 per meter, and she wants to buy 20 meters.

Next, I'll determine how much money Sarah has in total by multiplying the length of the rope by the price per meter. 

Finally, I'll subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money Sarah has to find out how much money she will have left over.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total cost of the new rope:**
   
   - **Length of the new rope:** 20 meters
   - **Cost per meter of the new rope:** \$1.50
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Length} \times \text{Cost per meter} = 20 \, \text{m} \times \$1.50/\text{m} = \$30.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the leftover money after buying the new rope:**
   
   - **Total money Sarah has:** \$20.00
   - **Total cost of the new rope:** \$30.00
   
   \[
   \text{Leftover money} = \text{Total money} - \text{Total cost} = \$20.00 - \$30.00 = -\$10.00
   \]

   **Explanation:** Sarah does not have enough money to buy the new rope as the total required cost exceeds the money she currently has by \$10.00.

\[
\boxed{-\$10.00}
\]
