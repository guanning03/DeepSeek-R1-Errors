Question:
A bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning and half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. How many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon?

Correct Answer:
60 x 2/3 = <<60*2/3=40>>40 loaves of bread are sold in the morning.
60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon and evening.
Therefore, 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.
#### 10

Wrong Answer:
First, the bakery produces 60 loaves of bread daily.

Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning. Calculating two-thirds of 60 gives 40 loaves sold in the morning.

This leaves 20 loaves remaining after the morning sales.

Half of the remaining 20 loaves is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is 10 loaves.

Since these 10 loaves are split equally between the afternoon and evening, each segment sells 5 loaves, but specifically, the afternoon sales amount to 5 loaves.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

1. **Total Daily Production:**
   \[
   60 \text{ loaves}
   \]

2. **Loaves Sold in the Morning:**
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \text{ of } 60 = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Loaves Remaining After the Morning:**
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Loaves Sold in the Afternoon and Evening:**
   - Half of the remaining 20 loaves is sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   - Calculate half of 20:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
     \]
   - These 10 loaves are split equally between the afternoon and evening:
     \[
     \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves in the afternoon}
     \]
     \[
     5 \text{ loaves in the evening}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{5}
   \]
