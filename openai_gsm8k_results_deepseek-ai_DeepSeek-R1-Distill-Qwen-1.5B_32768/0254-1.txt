Question:
You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?

Correct Answer:
The super ticket costs $20 and for $1 extra I can get a popcorn and a soda, there I'd pay in total $20+$1 = $<<20+1=21>>21
If I didn't buy the ($21) super ticket but bought everything included on it and still saved $2, then I spent in total $21-$2 = $<<21-2=19>>19
If the regular movie ticket costs $12 and the soda costs $3 then the popcorn would cost $19-$12-$3=$4

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to identify the costs involved in both options. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a free popcorn and soda. Without the super ticket, a movie ticket is $12, popcorn is p dollars, and soda is $3. 

The total cost for the regular ticket, including popcorn and soda, is $12 + p + $3 = $15 + p. 

By purchasing the super ticket, the total cost is $20, which is $5 more than the regular ticket cost. However, the question states that by not buying the super ticket and saving $2, we can determine the regular price of popcorn.

Setting up the equation: $15 + p = $20 - $2, which simplifies to $15 + p = $18. Solving for p gives p = $3. But wait, the soda costs $3, which would make the regular price of popcorn also $3. This seems inconsistent because the total cost would then be $18. 

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is $3.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the regular price of popcorn.

1. **Identify the Costs:**
   - **Super Ticket:**
     - **Cost:** \$20
     - **Included:** Popcorn and Soda (free)
   - **Regular Ticket:**
     - **Cost:** \$12
     - **Plus:** Popcorn (p) and Soda (s)
     - **Total:** \$12 + p + s

2. **Given Information:**
   - Soda costs \$3.
   - Without the super ticket, you ended up saving \$2 by purchasing the regular ticket instead of the super ticket.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total cost without the super ticket is \$12 + p + s.
   - With the super ticket, the cost is \$20.
   - The saving is the difference between the two costs:
     \[
     (\text{Without Super Ticket Cost}) - (\text{Super Ticket Cost}) = \text{Savings}
     \]
     \[
     (\$12 + p + s) - \$20 = \$2
     \]
   
4. **Plug in the Known Values:**
   - Soda (s) = \$3
   - Savings = \$2
   \[
   (\$12 + p + \$3) - \$20 = \$2
   \]
   \[
   \$15 + p - \$20 = \$2
   \]
   
5. **Solve for Popcorn Price (p):**
   \[
   p - \$5 = \$2
   \]
   \[
   p = \$7
   \]

Wait, this doesn't make sense because the soda already costs \$3. Let's check our equation again.

**Correction:**

The correct equation should be:
\[
(\text{Without Super Ticket Cost}) - (\text{Super Ticket Cost}) = \text{Savings}
\]
\[
(\$12 + p + s) - \$20 = \$2
\]
Plugging in the known values:
\[
12 + p + 3 - 20 = 2
\]
\[
p + 15 - 20 = 2
\]
\[
p - 5 = 2
\]
\[
p = 2 + 5
\]
\[
p = 7
\]

**Re-evaluate:** The soda is \$3, and the regular price of popcorn is \$7. This seems high, but let's verify.

**Verification:**
- Without super ticket:
  - Movie ticket: \$12
  - Popcorn: \$7
  - Soda: \$3
  - Total: \$12 + \$7 + \$3 = \$22
- With super ticket:
  - Movie ticket: \$20
  - Popcorn and Soda: \$0 (included)
  - Total: \$20

**Savings:**
\[
\$22 - \$20 = \$2
\]

This matches the given information. Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]
