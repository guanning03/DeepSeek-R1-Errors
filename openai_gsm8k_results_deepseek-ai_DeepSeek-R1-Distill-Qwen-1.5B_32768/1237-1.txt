Question:
Candy has a chair rental business. During the weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day; but during weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. If this continues, how many chairs in total will Candy be able to rent out in two 4-week months?

Correct Answer:
During weekdays, a total of 60 x 5 = <<60*5=300>>300 chairs are rented.
During the weekends, a total of 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200 chairs are rented.
In a week, 300 + 200 = <<300+200=500>>500 chairs are rented.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 500 x 4 = <<500*4=2000>>2000 chairs are rented in a month.
Thus, a total of 2000 x 2 = <<2000*2=4000>>4000 chairs are rented in two months.

1,280

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day. There are 4 weekdays, so the total chairs rented during weekdays in a month are 60 chairs/day * 4 days = 240 chairs.

During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. There are also 4 weekend days, so the total chairs rented during weekends in a month are 100 chairs/day * 4 days = 400 chairs.

Add the chairs rented during weekdays and weekends to find the total chairs rented in one month: 240 chairs + 400 chairs = 640 chairs.

Since the question asks for the total chairs rented in two months, multiply the monthly total by 2: 640 chairs/month * 2 months = 1,280 chairs.

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out a total of 1,280 chairs in two 4-week months.

To determine how many chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months, we'll break down the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Calculate Chairs Rented During Weekdays in One Month**
- **Chairs per weekday:** 60 chairs/day
- **Number of weekdays in a month:** 4 days

\[
\text{Chairs during weekdays} = 60 \, \text{chairs/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 240 \, \text{chairs}
\]

### **Step 2: Calculate Chairs Rented During Weekends in One Month**
- **Chairs per weekend day:** 100 chairs/day
- **Number of weekend days in a month:** 4 days

\[
\text{Chairs during weekends} = 100 \, \text{chairs/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 400 \, \text{chairs}
\]

### **Step 3: Total Chairs Rented in One Month**
\[
\text{Total chairs per month} = 240 \, \text{chairs} + 400 \, \text{chairs} = 640 \, \text{chairs}
\]

### **Step 4: Total Chairs Rented in Two Months**
\[
\text{Total chairs for two months} = 640 \, \text{chairs/month} \times 2 \, \text{months} = 1,\!280 \, \text{chairs}
\]

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{1,\!280}
\]
