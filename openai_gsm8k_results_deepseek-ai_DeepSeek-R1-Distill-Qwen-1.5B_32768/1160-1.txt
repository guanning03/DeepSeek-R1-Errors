Question:
After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. How many points did Erin have before?

Correct Answer:
Erin now has three times more points than Sara, which is 3*8= <<3*8=24>>24 more points than Sara.
This means Erin has a total of 8+24 = <<8+24=32>>32 points now.
Before, Erin had 32-14= <<32-14=18>>18 points
#### 18

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many points Sara has before Erin's recent score. The problem states that after Erin scores 14 points, her total will be three times the number of points Sara has.

Let’s denote the number of points Sara has before Erin scores as \( x \). After Erin scores 14 points, her total will be \( x + 14 \).

According to the problem, \( x + 14 = 3x \). Solving for \( x \), we subtract \( x \) from both sides to get \( 14 = 2x \), which means \( x = 7 \).

This means Sara had 7 points before Erin scored. Therefore, Erin had 14 points before scoring.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points will be three times the number of points Sara has.
- Sara's score before Erin's score was 8 points.

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( E \) be Erin's points before scoring.
- After scoring 14 points, Erin's total will be \( E + 14 \).

**According to the problem:**
\[
E + 14 = 3 \times \text{Sara's points}
\]
Since Sara scored 8 points, we substitute:
\[
E + 14 = 3 \times 8
\]
\[
E + 14 = 24
\]
\[
E = 24 - 14
\]
\[
E = 10
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
