Question:
The power goes out in Brianna's house one night so she and her family gather all their candles and flashlights. There are 8 rooms in the house and 4 people living there, including Brianna. There is a flashlight for every person to carry and two for each room. They have a variety of candles available; 4 small candles each for half the rooms and 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms. With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?

Correct Answer:
For every one of the 8 rooms in the house, there are 2 flashlights, 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 flashlights.
For every person there is 1 flashlight, 1 x 4 people = <<1*4=4>>4 flashlights.
Total, there are 16 + 4 = <<16+4=20>>20 flashlights in the house being used by Brianna and her family.
For half of the 8 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, 8/2 x 4 = <<8/2*4=16>>16 small candles in half the rooms.
For the other half of the 8 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, 8/2 x 5 = <<8/2*5=20>>20 medium candles in all the rooms.
Total, there are 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 candles in the house.
Combined, there are 20 flashlights + 36 candles = <<20+36=56>>56 flashlights and candles in the house.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total number of flashlights available in the house. There are 8 rooms, and each room has 2 flashlights, so that's 8 times 2, which equals 16 flashlights.

Next, I'll calculate the number of candles. Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 times 4, totaling 16 small candles. The other half of the rooms has 5 medium candles each, which is 5 times 4, giving 20 medium candles. Adding these together, there are 16 plus 20, which equals 36 candles.

Finally, to find the total number of candles and flashlights, I'll add the number of candles and flashlights: 36 candles plus 16 flashlights equals 52 items.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family has when the power goes out.

### **1. Number of Flashlights**

- **Total number of rooms:** 8
- **Flashlights per room:** 2

\[
\text{Total flashlights} = 8 \text{ rooms} \times 2 \text{ flashlights/room} = 16 \text{ flashlights}
\]

### **2. Number of Candles**

- **Rooms with small candles:**
  - **Number of rooms:** 4 (since half of 8 is 4)
  - **Candles per room:** 4 small candles

\[
\text{Small candles} = 4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ candles/room} = 16 \text{ small candles}
\]

- **Rooms with medium candles:**
  - **Number of rooms:** 4 (since half of 8 is 4)
  - **Candles per room:** 5 medium candles

\[
\text{Medium candles} = 4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ candles/room} = 20 \text{ medium candles}
\]

- **Total candles:**

\[
\text{Total candles} = 16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 36 \text{ candles}
\]

### **3. Total Candles and Flashlights**

\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Total candles} + \text{Total flashlights} = 36 + 16 = 52
\]

\[
\boxed{52}
\]
