Question:
The vending machines sell chips for 40 cents and candy bars for 75 cents. George spent $5 and got 3 bags of chips and had 1% of his money left. How many candy bars did he buy?

Correct Answer:
George got $.05 in change because 5 x .01 = <<5*.01=.05>>.05
George spent $4.95 because 5 - .05 = <<5-.05=4.95>>4.95
George spent $1.2 on chips because 3 x .4 = <<3*.4=1.2>>1.2
George spent 3.75 on candy bars because 4.95 - 1.2 = <<4.95-1.2=3.75>>3.75
George bought 5 candy bars because 3.75 / .75 = <<5=5>>5

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how much money George spent on chips and how much he had left.

George spent a total of $5. He bought 3 bags of chips, each costing 40 cents. So, the total cost for the chips is 3 multiplied by 0.40 dollars, which equals $1.20.

Subtracting the cost of the chips from the total amount spent gives the remaining money:
$5.00 - $1.20 = $3.80.

He had 1% of his original money left, which is 1% of $5.00, equaling $0.05. This matches the remaining $3.80 from the previous calculation, confirming that George bought 3 bags of chips.

Now, to find out how many candy bars he bought, I'll subtract the money spent on chips from the total and divide the remaining by the price of a candy bar.

Total money: $5.00
Money spent on chips: $1.20
Remaining money: $3.80

Number of candy bars = $3.80 / $0.75 â‰ˆ 5.066...

Since George can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll take the whole number, which is 5 candy bars.

However, since 5 candy bars would cost exactly $3.75, and he had $3.80 left, there's a discrepancy. This means he could have bought 5 candy bars, with the extra $0.05 covered by the 1% tax.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

To determine how many candy bars George bought, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Cost of one bag of chips: \$0.40
- Cost of one candy bar: \$0.75
- Total money George spent: \$5.00
- 1% of his money was left after purchasing chips.

**Step 1: Calculate the total money spent on chips.**

Let \( x \) be the number of chips George bought.

\[
\text{Total cost on chips} = 0.40x
\]

**Step 2: Express the remaining money after buying chips.**

George had 1% of his money left, which is:

\[
\text{Money left} = 0.01 \times 5.00 = \$0.05
\]

Therefore, the total money spent on chips and candy bars is:

\[
\text{Total spent} = \$5.00 - \$0.05 = \$4.95
\]

But since he only bought chips, the money spent on chips is:

\[
\text{Total spent on chips} = \$4.95
\]

**Step 3: Solve for the number of chips bought.**

\[
0.40x = 4.95
\]

\[
x = \frac{4.95}{0.40} = 12.375
\]

Since George can't buy a fraction of a chip, we'll consider the whole number, which is 12 chips. However, this leaves an extra 12.375 - 12 = 0.375 chips, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, George bought 12 chips.

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining money after buying chips.**

\[
\text{Total spent on chips} = 12 \times \$0.40 = \$4.80
\]

\[
\text{Remaining money} = \$5.00 - \$4.80 = \$0.20
\]

**Step 5: Determine the number of candy bars bought.**

\[
\text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{\$0.20}{\$0.75} \approx 0.2667
\]

Since George can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, he bought 0 candy bars.

**Final Answer:**

George bought \(\boxed{0}\) candy bars.
