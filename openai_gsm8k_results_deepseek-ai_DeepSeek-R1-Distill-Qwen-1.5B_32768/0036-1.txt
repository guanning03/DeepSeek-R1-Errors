Question:
Tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending a function at Mia’s restaurant. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. If there are 8 high chairs, how many more chairs does she have to get?

Correct Answer:
Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 regular chairs
The total number of both types of chairs is therefore 8 + 40 = <<8+40=48>>48 chairs
However, the total number of attendants will be 42 + 15 = <<42+15=57>>57 people
Mia will therefore need 57-48 = <<57-48=9>>9 more chairs
#### 9

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total number of chairs required for the event. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies, with each adult requiring one chair and each baby requiring one chair. This means a total of 42 + 15 = 57 chairs are needed.

Next, I know that the restaurant has 8 high chairs. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, I can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying the number of high chairs by 5. So, 8 high chairs × 5 = 40 regular chairs.

Now, to find out how many more chairs Mia's restaurant needs, I'll subtract the number of chairs it currently has from the total number of chairs required. That is 57 chairs needed - 40 regular chairs = 17 more chairs required.

Therefore, Mia's restaurant needs to acquire 17 additional chairs.

To determine how many more chairs Mia's restaurant needs, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of chairs required:**
   
   - **Adults:** 42
   - ** babies:** 15
   
   \[
   \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57
   \]

2. **Determine the number of regular chairs available:**
   
   - **High chairs:** 8
   
   Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs:
   
   \[
   \text{Regular chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40
   \]

3. **Find out how many more chairs are needed:**
   
   \[
   \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Regular chairs} = 57 - 40 = 17
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{17}
\]
