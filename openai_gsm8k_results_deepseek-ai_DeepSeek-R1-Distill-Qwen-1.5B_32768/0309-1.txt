Question:
Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?

Correct Answer:
Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.
Thus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.
Thus, Tanya uses 4Z = <<4=4>>4 ounces of oil.

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll list out all the ingredients Tanya uses and define variables for each to simplify the calculations.

Let \( s \) represent the amount of salt in ounces.
According to the problem, the amount of sugar is the same as the salt, so \( \text{Sugar} = s \).

The amount of oil is twice the salt, so \( \text{Oil} = 2s \).

The amount of fragrance is the same as the salt, so \( \text{Flavour} = s \).

Finally, the amount of citrus zest is the same as the salt, so \( \text{Zest} = s \).

The total volume of the scrub is the sum of all ingredients:
\[
\text{Salt} + \text{Oil} + \text{Flavour} + \text{Zest} + \text{Sugar} = 10 \text{ ounces}
\]
Substituting the expressions in terms of \( s \):
\[
s + 2s + s + s + s = 10
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
6s = 10
\]
Solving for \( s \):
\[
s = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \text{ ounces}
\]
Now, to find the amount of oil:
\[
\text{Oil} = 2s = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ ounces}
\]
So, Tanya uses approximately 3.33 ounces of oil.

Let's determine how many ounces of oil Tanya uses in her salt scrub recipe. 

**Given:**
- **Amount of salt** = \( s \) ounces
- **Amount of sugar** = \( s \) ounces (same as salt)
- **Amount of oil** = \( 2s \) ounces (twice the salt)
- **Amount of fragrance** = \( s \) ounces (same as salt)
- **Amount of citrus zest** = \( s \) ounces (same as salt)

**Total volume of the scrub:** 10 ounces

**Step 1: Set up the equation for the total volume.**

\[
\text{Salt} + \text{Oil} + \text{Flavour} + \text{Zest} + \text{Sugar} = 10 \text{ ounces}
\]

Substituting the known quantities:

\[
s + 2s + s + s + s = 10
\]

**Step 2: Combine like terms.**

\[
6s = 10
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( s \).**

\[
s = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \text{ ounces}
\]

**Step 4: Determine the amount of oil.**

\[
\text{Oil} = 2s = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ ounces}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{10}{3} \text{ ounces}}
\]
