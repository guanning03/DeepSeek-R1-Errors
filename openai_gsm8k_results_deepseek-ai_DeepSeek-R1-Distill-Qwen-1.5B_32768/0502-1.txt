Question:
Erica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out.  Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each.  She passed out 24 to her classmates, 5 to her family and received 17 from family and friends.  How many Valentine's Day cards does Erica now have?

Correct Answer:
Her dad gave her 2 boxes of 15 cards so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30
She made 20, was given 30 and received 17 so 20+30+17 = <<20+30+17=67>>67 cards
She passed out 24 and gave 5 cards to family and friends so she gave away 24+5 = <<24+5=29>>29 cards
She had 67 cards and gave away 29 cards so 67-29 = <<67-29=38>>38 cards left
#### 38

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica has. She made 20 cards herself. Her dad provided two boxes, each containing 15 cards. Multiplying the number of boxes by the number of cards per box gives 15 cards Ã— 2 = 30 cards.

Next, I'll determine the total number of cards Erica passed out. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates, 5 to her family, and received 17 from family and friends. Adding these together: 24 + 5 + 17 = 46 cards.

Finally, to find out how many cards Erica has left, I'll subtract the total number of cards she passed out from the total number of cards she initially had. That is 20 + 30 - 46 = 4 cards.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Cards Initially:**
   - Erica made **20** cards herself.
   - Her dad brought **2 boxes** of pre-made cards, each containing **15** cards.
     \[
     2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ cards}
     \]
   - **Total cards initially:**
     \[
     20 + 30 = 50 \text{ cards}
     \]

2. **Cards Passed Out:**
   - She passed out **24** cards to classmates.
   - **5** cards to her **family**.
   - She received **17** cards from **family and friends**.
   
   - **Total cards passed out:**
     \[
     24 + 5 + 17 = 46 \text{ cards}
     \]

3. **Cards Remaining:**
   - **Total cards initially** minus **Total cards passed out:**
     \[
     50 - 46 = 4 \text{ cards}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
