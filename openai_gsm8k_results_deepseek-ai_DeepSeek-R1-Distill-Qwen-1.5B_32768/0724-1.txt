Question:
In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% of the class are football players.  Out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band.  These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away game.  How many students are leaving early?

Correct Answer:
20% of the 30 student class are football players so that's .20*30 = <<.20*30=6>>6 students
There are 30 students and 6 are football players so that leaves 30-6 = <<30-6=24>>24 students
25% of the remaining 24 students are part of band or cheerleading so that's .25*24 = <<.25*24=6>>6 students
6 students are football players and 6 are part of band/cheerleading so 6+6 = <<6+6=12>>12 students will be leaving early
#### 12

Gold:
12

Wrong Prediction:
18

Wrong Answer:
Alright, let me try to figure out how many students are leaving early in Mr. Roper's class. So, we have a class of 30 students. First, 20% of them are football players. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate 20% of 30. Let me remember how percentages work. 1% of 30 is 0.3, right? So 20% would be 20 times that. 20 * 0.3 equals 6. So, there are 6 football players.

Now, out of the remaining class, 25% are cheerleaders or part of band. Hmm, so first, after subtracting the football players, how many students are left? The total class is 30, and 6 are football players, so 30 - 6 = 24 students are left. Okay, so 24 students are not football players. Now, 25% of these 24 are cheerleaders or part of band. Let me calculate 25% of 24. 25% is the same as a quarter, so 24 divided by 4 is 6. So, 6 students are cheerleaders or part of band.

Wait, so now I have 6 football players, 6 cheerleaders, and 6 band members. But the question says these three groups will need to leave early. So, are any of these overlapping? Like, could a student be both a football player and a cheerleader or band member? Hmm, that's a good question. The problem doesn't specify any overlap, so I think I can assume they are distinct groups. So, no overlap, meaning no one is counted twice.

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is the sum of the football players, cheerleaders, and band members. That would be 6 + 6 + 6. Let me add those up. 6 plus 6 is 12, and 12 plus another 6 is 18. So, altogether, 18 students are leaving early.

Wait a second, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with percentages and different groups, it's easy to make a mistake. So, 20% of 30 is indeed 6, right? 30 divided by 5 is 6, so 20% is 6. Then subtract 6, 30 minus 6 is 24. 25% of 24 is 6 because 24 divided by 4 is 6. So that's 6 cheerleaders or band members. So, 6 football players, 6 cheerleaders, 6 band members: 6 + 6 + 6 is 18. That seems correct.

I don't think there's any overlap mentioned, so we can safely add them up. So, yeah, 18 students are leaving early.

**Final Answer**
The number of students leaving early is \boxed{18}.

First, we calculate 20% of the 30 students in Mr. Roper's class, which are football players. 

\[
20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6
\]

This means there are 6 football players. 

Next, we subtract the number of football players from the total number of students to find the remaining students:

\[
30 - 6 = 24
\]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of band. 

\[
25\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6
\]

This means there are 6 cheerleaders or band members. 

Since the problem states that these three groups (football players, cheerleaders, and band members) are leaving early without any overlap, we add the number of students from each group:

\[
6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12
\]

However, this is incorrect because it only accounts for the football players and the 25% of the remaining students, which is 6. We need to add all three groups together:

\[
6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band)} = 18
\]

Thus, the total number of students leaving early is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\]
