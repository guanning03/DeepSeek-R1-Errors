Question:
Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.  They normally order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.  How much do they make a week if they are open 2 days a week?

Correct Answer:
The meals cost 2*5=$<<2*5=10>>10 per table
So each table pays 10+5=$<<10+5=15>>15 a night
So they make 6*$15=$<<6*15=90>>90 a night
That means they make $90*2=$<<90*2=180>>180 a week
#### 180

Wrong Answer:
To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, I'll start by calculating the daily revenue.

First, I'll calculate the cost of the meals and wine per night. Each meal costs $5, and there are 6 meals, so the total meal cost is 6 multiplied by $5, which equals $30. The wine costs $5, so adding that to the meal cost gives a total of $35 per night.

Next, since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, I'll multiply the daily revenue by 2. Therefore, the weekly revenue is $35 multiplied by 2, resulting in $70.

In summary, Tom's restaurant makes $70 per week.

To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Daily Revenue:**
   
   - **Meals:** 
     - Each meal costs \$5.
     - There are 6 meals per night.
     - Total cost for meals per night: 
       \[
       6 \times \$5 = \$30
       \]
   
   - **Wine:**
     - The wine costs \$5.
   
   - **Total Daily Cost:**
     \[
     \$30 \, (\text{meals}) + \$5 \, (\text{wine}) = \$35 \, \text{per night}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Weekly Revenue:**
   
   - The restaurant is open for 2 days a week.
   - **Total Weekly Revenue:**
     \[
     2 \times \$35 = \$70
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$70}
\]
