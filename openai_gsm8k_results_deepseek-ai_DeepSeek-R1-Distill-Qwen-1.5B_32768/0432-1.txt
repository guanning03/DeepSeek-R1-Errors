Question:
Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?

Correct Answer:
The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, a total of 1/4*20=<<1/4*20=5>>5 times.
Jerome's second friend pressed on the doorbell 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25
The first two friends pressed on the doorbell 25+20=<<25+20=45>>45 times altogether before Jerome could open the door.
Jerome's third friend pressed on the doorbell 60+10=<<60+10=70>>70 times before Jerome could open the door.
Altogether, Jerome's third and fourth friends pressed on the doorbell 70+60=<<70+60=130>>130 times before Jerome could open.
The number of doorbell rings that Jerome's friend made before Jerome could open the door is 130+45=<<130+45=175>>175 times.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 25 times, which is 20 plus 5.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 600 times, which is 10 times more than the fourth friend.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of doorbell rings pressed by all friends.

1. **First Friend:**
   - The first friend pressed the doorbell **20 times**.
   
2. **Second Friend:**
   - The second friend pressed the doorbell **1/4 times more** than the first friend.
   - Calculation: \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
   
3. **Fourth Friend:**
   - The fourth friend pressed the doorbell **60 times**.
   
4. **Third Friend:**
   - The third friend pressed the doorbell **10 times more** than the fourth friend.
   - Calculation: \( 60 \times 10 = 600 \) times.
   
5. **Total Doorbell Rings:**
   - Add the number of presses from all friends:
     \[
     20 \ (\text{First Friend}) + 25 \ (\text{Second Friend}) + 600 \ (\text{Third Friend}) + 60 \ (\text{Fourth Friend}) = 705
     \]
   
**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{705}
\]
