Question:
Peter has twice as many socks as Jack and half times as many dishes as jack. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store. If jack collected 60 dishes, calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together?

Correct Answer:
Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he has 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 socks.
In total, he has 30+60 = <<30+60=90>>90 socks and dishes.
Peter has twice as many socks as jack which totals 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 socks.
He also has half times as many dishes as Jack which is 1/2*60 = 30 dishes.
In total, he has 60+30 = <<60+30=90>>90 socks and dishes.
The total number of socks and dishes they both have is 90+90 = <<90+90=180>>180
#### 180

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the number of socks and dishes that Jack collected. The problem states that Jack collected 60 dishes.

Next, since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, I can calculate the number of socks by multiplying Jack's socks by 2.

Then, Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. I'll calculate Peter's dishes by taking half of Jack's dishes.

Finally, I'll add up the total number of socks and dishes that both Jack and Peter have to find the combined total.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Jack's Dishes:**
   
   It's given that Jack collected **60 dishes**.

2. **Determine Peter's Socks:**
   
   Peter has **twice as many socks as Jack**. 
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Peter's Socks} = 2 \times \text{Number of Jack's Socks}
   \]
   
   Let \( J_s \) represent Jack's socks. Therefore,
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Peter's Socks} = 2 \times J_s
   \]
   
3. **Determine Peter's Dishes:**
   
   Peter has **half as many dishes as Jack**.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Peter's Dishes} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of Jack's Dishes}
   \]
   
   Substituting the known number of Jack's dishes:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Peter's Dishes} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30
   \]
   
4. **Calculate the Total Number of Socks and Dishes:**
   
   - **Total Socks:**
     
     \[
     \text{Total Socks} = \text{Jack's Socks} + \text{Peter's Socks} = J_s + 2J_s = 3J_s
     \]
   
   - **Total Dishes:**
     
     \[
     \text{Total Dishes} = \text{Jack's Dishes} + \text{Peter's Dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90
     \]
   
   - **Combined Total:**
     
     \[
     \text{Total Socks and Dishes} = \text{Total Socks} + \text{Total Dishes} = 3J_s + 90
     \]
   
   However, since the problem doesn't provide the exact number of socks Jack collected (\( J_s \)), we can express the final answer in terms of \( J_s \).

   Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:

   \[
   \boxed{3J_s + 90}
   \]

   **But if we consider that Jack's socks (\( J_s \)) are not provided, the problem might have additional constraints or information not mentioned.**
