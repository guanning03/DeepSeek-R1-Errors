Question:
An interior design firm offers installation for $129.00.  It includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.  They will install additional items for an extra $15.00 per item.  Angela has 6 mirrors and 2 chandeliers and 20 pictures that she needs installed/hung.  How much will this cost her?

Correct Answer:
The service includes 4 mirrors and she has 6 so that's 6-4 = <<6-4=2>>2 extra mirrors
An additional item is an extra $15.00 so that's 2*15 = $30.00
The service includes 1 chandelier and she has 2 so that's 2-1 = 1 extra chandelier
An additional item is an extra $15.00 so that's 1*15 = $<<1*15=15.00>>15.00
The service includes 10 pictures and she has 20 to that's 20-10 = <<20-10=10>>10 extra pictures
An additional item is an extra $15.00 so that's 10*15 = $<<10*15=150.00>>150.00
The service costs $129.00 and the extra mirrors are $30.00, the chandelier is $15.00 and the pictures are $150.00 for a total of 129+30+15+150 = $<<129+30+15+150=324.00>>324.00

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine how many of each item Angela needs to install or hang.

She needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.

Next, I'll calculate the cost for each type of item:

- Mirrors: 6 mirrors × $129.00 = $774.00
- Chandeliers: 2 chandeliers × $129.00 = $258.00
- Pictures: 20 pictures × $129.00 = $2,580.00

Adding these amounts together: $774.00 + $258.00 + $2,580.00 = $3,612.00

Finally, she will install additional items for an extra $15.00 per item. She needs 6 + 2 + 20 = 28 items.

The additional cost is 28 × $15.00 = $420.00

Adding the additional cost to the initial cost: $3,612.00 + $420.00 = $4,032.00

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the total cost for Angela's installations and hangs.

1. **Identify the cost per item:**
   - **Interior Design Firm:** \$129.00 per item

2. **Determine the number of items needed:**
   - **Mirrors:** 6
   - **Chandeliers:** 2
   - **Pictures:** 20
   - **Total Items:** 6 + 2 + 20 = 28

3. **Calculate the cost for each type of item:**
   - **Mirrors:** 6 × \$129.00 = \$774.00
   - **Chandeliers:** 2 × \$129.00 = \$258.00
   - **Pictures:** 20 × \$129.00 = \$2,580.00

4. **Sum the costs for all items:**
   \[
   \$774.00 + \$258.00 + \$2,580.00 = \$3,612.00
   \]

5. **Calculate the additional cost for installing extra items:**
   - **Installations per item:** \$15.00
   - **Total Items to Install:** 28
   \[
   28 \times \$15.00 = \$420.00
   \]

6. **Add the additional cost to the initial cost:**
   \[
   \$3,612.00 + \$420.00 = \$4,032.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\$4,\!032.00}
