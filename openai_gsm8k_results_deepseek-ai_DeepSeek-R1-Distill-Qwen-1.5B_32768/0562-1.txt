Question:
Erika is saving for a new laptop. The laptop she wants costs $600. The sales assistant told her that if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. Her mom agrees to give her $80 to help her. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?

Correct Answer:
Selling the old laptop reduced the cost of the new laptop to $600 – $200 = $<<600-200=400>>400 dollars.
We know she doesn't have all the money yet, so she actually has $400 – $50 = $<<400-50=350>>350 dollars.
Some of this money came from her mom, so the money she had herself was $350 – $80 = $<<350-80=270>>270.
Subtracting her part-time wages shows that she had $270 – $150 = $<<270-150=120>>120 in her purse.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total amount Erika will spend after the price reduction and considering her current savings.

The laptop costs $600. If she gets a $200 discount by trading in her old laptop, the new laptop will cost $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has already received $150 from her part-time job and her mom has given her $80. So, her total savings are $150 + $80 = $230.

Subtracting her savings from the discounted price of the laptop: $400 - $230 = $170.

Therefore, Erika needs an additional $50 to buy the laptop, as indicated.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Erika currently has in her purse.

**Given:**
- **Laptop cost:** \$600
- **Discount from trade-in:** \$200
- **Erika's current savings:** Not directly provided, but we can calculate it.
- **Amount received from part-time job:** \$150
- **Amount given by mom:** \$80
- **Additional amount needed:** \$50

**Step 1: Calculate Erika's total savings.**

Erika has received:
- Part-time job payment: \$150
- Amount from mom: \$80

\[
\text{Total Savings} = \$150 + \$80 = \$230
\]

**Step 2: Determine the discounted price of the laptop.**

The laptop originally costs \$600, and there's a \$200 discount.

\[
\text{Discounted Price} = \$600 - \$200 = \$400
\]

**Step 3: Calculate how much more Erika needs to buy the laptop.**

The discounted price is \$400, and Erika currently has \$230 in savings.

\[
\text{Additional Amount Needed} = \$400 - \$230 = \$170
\]

However, the problem states that Erika only needs an **extra** \$50 to buy the laptop. This discrepancy suggests there might be a misinterpretation of the given information. To align with the problem statement:

\[
\text{Erika's total savings} = \$400 - \$50 = \$350
\]

But this doesn't align with the previously calculated savings of \$230. To resolve this, let's verify the steps again.

**Revised Step 1: Calculate Erika's total savings.**

Erika has received:
- Part-time job payment: \$150
- Amount from mom: \$80

\[
\text{Total Savings} = \$150 + \$80 = \$230
\]

Given that she only needs an extra \$50, her total savings should be:

\[
\text{Erika's Current Savings} = \$230 + \$50 = \$280
\]

However, this contradicts the earlier calculation of \$230. To reconcile this, there might be an error in the problem statement or an additional factor not considered. Assuming the problem statement is correct, Erika's current savings should be:

\[
\text{Erika's Current Savings} = \$400 - \$50 = \$350
\]

But this doesn't align with the previously calculated savings of \$230. To resolve this discrepancy, it's best to conclude that based on the given information, Erika has:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]
