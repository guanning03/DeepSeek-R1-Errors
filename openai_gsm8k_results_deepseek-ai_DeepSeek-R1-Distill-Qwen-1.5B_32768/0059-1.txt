Question:
Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?

Correct Answer:
First find the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75
Now subtract the cost of the asphalt and the fine from the cost of the damage Ron avoids: $450 - $75 - $120 = $<<450-75-120=255>>255

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total cost of fixing the pothole. The pothole costs $450 to repair. Additionally, Ron has to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25. This amounts to an additional expense of $75.

By fixing the pothole, Ron saves the cost of the pothole repair and the asphalt purchase. Therefore, the total savings are $450 (repair) plus $75 (asphalt), which equals $525.

To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to consider both the repair cost and the additional expenses incurred.

1. **Repair Cost:**
   - The pothole costs **\$450** to repair.

2. **Asphalt Purchase:**
   - Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt.
   - Each bucket costs **\$25**.
   - Total cost for asphalt = \(3 \times \$25 = \$75\).

3. **Total Savings:**
   - Ron's savings are the sum of the repair cost and the asphalt purchase.
   - Total savings = \$450 ( repair) + \$75 (asphalt) = **\$525**.

\[
\boxed{525}
