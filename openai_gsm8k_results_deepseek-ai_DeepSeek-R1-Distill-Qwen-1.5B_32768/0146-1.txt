Question:
Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. If they worked for 12 hours in a day, calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together.

Correct Answer:
Merissa makes 3/4 * 120 pounds = <<3/4*120=90>>90 pounds of chocolate in an hour.
Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolate in two hours; this means she makes 120 pounds / 2 hours = <<120/2=60>>60 pounds of chocolate in an hour.
If they worked for 12 hours, Ruiz made 12 hours * 60 pounds/hour = <<12*60=720>>720 pounds of chocolate while
Marissa made 90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = <<90*12=1080>>1080 pounds of chocolate
The combined amount of pounds of chocolate they both ate is 1080 pounds + 720 pounds = <<1080+720=1800>>1800 pounds of chocolate

Wrong Prediction:
1,260

Wrong Answer:
First, determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, dividing 120 by 2 gives 60 pounds per hour.

Next, calculate Marissa's production rate. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds as Ruiz in one hour. So, Marissa makes 60 multiplied by 3/4, which equals 45 pounds per hour.

Then, calculate the total chocolates produced by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours. Multiply each of their hourly rates by 12. Ruiz makes 60 times 12, totaling 720 pounds. Marissa makes 45 times 12, resulting in 540 pounds.

Finally, add the totals produced by both Ruiz and Marissa to find the combined amount. Adding 720 and 540 gives a total of 1,260 pounds of chocolates.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total amount of chocolate pounds produced by both Ruiz and Marissa in a day.

### **Step 1: Determine Ruiz's Production Rate**

**Ruiz's Production:**
- **Total Pounds in 2 Hours:** 120 pounds
- **Hours Worked:** 2 hours

\[
\text{Ruiz's Production Rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

### **Step 2: Determine Marissa's Production Rate**

**Marissa's Production:**
- **Marissa Makes 3/4 Times as Many as Ruiz per Hour**
- **Ruiz's Rate:** 60 pounds per hour

\[
\text{Marissa's Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

### **Step 3: Calculate Total Production in 12 Hours**

**Ruiz's Total Production:**
\[
60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Marissa's Total Production:**
\[
45 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Total Production Together:**
\[
720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1,\!260 \text{ pounds}
\]

\[
\boxed{1,\!260}
\]
