Question:
Richard wants to make a video to share online of him doing a science experiment that creates a fountain of diet soda after placing a specific branded candy inside it. Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the driveway. After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?

Correct Answer:
If Richard's driveway is 24 feet long and he puts a bottle of soda every 3 feet, then out of 24 feet total there are 24 / 3 feet between each bottle = <<24/3=8>>8 bottles.
If Richard starts at 0 seconds with the first bottle and it takes him 5 seconds to go onto the next bottle to drop the candy, then it will take him 5 seconds x 7 bottles = 35 seconds total.
#### 35

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many soda bottles Richard will place in his 24-foot wide driveway. Since he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet and starts at the first bottle, I'll divide the total width by the distance between each bottle. That gives me 24 divided by 3, which equals 8 bottles.

Next, I'll calculate the total time it will take Richard to set off all the fountains. He takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 bottles, there will be 7 intervals between them. Multiplying the number of intervals by the time per interval will give the total time. So, 7 intervals multiplied by 5 seconds per interval equals 35 seconds.

Therefore, it will take Richard a total of 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

To determine the total time Richard will take to set off all the soda fountains, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard needs:**

   - **Width of the driveway:** 24 feet
   - **Distance between each bottle:** 3 feet

   The number of intervals between the bottles is the total width divided by the distance between them:
   \[
   \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ intervals}
   \]

   Since Richard starts at the first bottle and needs to place a bottle after every 3 feet, the total number of bottles is:
   \[
   \text{Number of bottles} = \text{Number of intervals} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. **Determine the total time to set off all the fountains:**

   - **Time per interval:** 5 seconds
   - **Number of intervals:** 8

   The total time is calculated by multiplying the number of intervals by the time per interval:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:
\[
\boxed{40 \text{ seconds}}
\]
