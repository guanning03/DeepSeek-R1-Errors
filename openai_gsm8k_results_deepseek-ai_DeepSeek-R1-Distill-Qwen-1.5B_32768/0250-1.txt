Question:
It takes 240 minutes of walking to break in a new pair of shoes. Jason wants to try out for the track team in three weeks. If he can walk 4 days a week to break in the new shoes, how long does he have to spend walking each day?

Correct Answer:
First find how many days Jason has to prepare for the tryouts: 3 weeks * 4 days/week = <<3*4=12>>12 days
Then divide the time it takes to break the shoes in by the time Jason can spend each day to find how long he needs to walk each day: 240 minutes / 12 days = <<240/12=20>>20 minutes/day
#### 20

Wrong Answer:
First, identify the total walking time needed to break in the new shoes, which is 240 minutes.

Jason plans to walk for 4 days every week.

Next, divide the total minutes by the number of days he walks each week to find the daily walking time.

Finally, calculate the daily walking time by performing the division: 240 minutes divided by 4 days equals 60 minutes per day.

**Solution:**

To determine how many minutes Jason needs to walk each day to break in the new shoes, follow these steps:

1. **Total Walking Time:**  
   It takes **240 minutes** to break in the new shoes.

2. **Number of Walking Days per Week:**  
   Jason plans to walk for **4 days** every week.

3. **Calculate Daily Walking Time:**  
   \[
   \text{Daily Walking Time} = \frac{\text{Total Walking Time}}{\text{Number of Walking Days per Week}} = \frac{240\ \text{minutes}}{4\ \text{days}} = 60\ \text{minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{60\ \text{minutes}}
\]
