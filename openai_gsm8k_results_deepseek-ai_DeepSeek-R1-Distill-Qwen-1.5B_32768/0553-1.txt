Question:
The Llesis family drove and hiked 6 hours to their vacation spot. They drove an average of 50 miles per hour and hiked an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive. If it took them 1.5 hours to hike, how far was their vacation spot?

Correct Answer:
Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.
Hence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.
So, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.
It took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.
So, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.
Therefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.
#### 255

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the driving speed of the Llesis family. They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for 6 hours. 

Next, calculate their hiking speed. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, and subtracting 5 gives a hiking speed of 20 miles per hour.

Since it took them 1.5 hours to hike, multiply the hiking speed by the time to find the distance they hiked. 

Finally, add the distance driven to the distance hiked to find the total distance of the vacation spot.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the driving speed:**
   
   The Llesis family drove at an average speed of **50 miles per hour**.

2. **Calculate the driving distance:**
   
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Driving Distance} = 50 \, \text{mph} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the hiking speed:**
   
   - The hiking speed is **5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed**.
   
   \[
   \text{Hiking Speed} = \left( \frac{\text{Driving Speed}}{2} \right) - 5
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Hiking Speed} = \left( \frac{50}{2} \right) - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \, \text{mph}
   \]

4. **Calculate the hiking distance:**
   
   \[
   \text{Hiking Distance} = \text{Hiking Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Hiking Distance} = 20 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

5. **Find the total distance of the vacation spot:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Driving Distance} + \text{Hiking Distance}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{330}
