Question:
There are 29 pupils in a class. The teacher has 9 coupons; each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. The teacher gives each student 2 bottles of apple juice to drink for lunch. After redeeming all her coupons and giving each student their apple juice lunch, how many bottles of apple juice does the teacher have for herself?

Correct Answer:
The teacher can redeem her coupons for 9 * 100 = <<9*100=900>>900 bottles of apple juice.
In total, the pupils receive 29 * 2 = <<29*2=58>>58 bottles of apple juice from the teacher.
Thus the teacher has 900 - 58 = <<900-58=842>>842 bottles of apple juice for herself.
#### 842

Wrong Answer:
First, I determine the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has. Since there are 29 students and each receives 2 bottles, the total is 29 multiplied by 2, which equals 58 bottles.

Next, I calculate how many bottles the teacher can redeem with her 9 coupons. Each coupon provides 100 bottles, so 9 coupons can redeem a total of 9 multiplied by 100, resulting in 900 bottles.

Finally, I subtract the number of bottles redeemable with coupons from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles the teacher keeps for herself. This is 58 minus 900, which equals -842. Since the number of bottles cannot be negative, it means the teacher has 0 bottles left.

To determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles given to students:**
   
   There are 29 students, and each receives 2 bottles.
   
   \[
   \text{Total bottles given to students} = 29 \times 2 = 58 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. **Determine how many bottles can be redeemed with the coupons:**
   
   The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles.
   
   \[
   \text{Total bottles redeemable with coupons} = 9 \times 100 = 900 \text{ bottles}
   \]

3. **Find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself:**
   
   Subtract the number of bottles redeemable with coupons from the total bottles given to students.
   
   \[
   \text{Bottles for the teacher} = 58 - 900 = -842
   \]
   
   Since the teacher cannot have a negative number of bottles, the result indicates that she has **no bottles left** for herself.

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
