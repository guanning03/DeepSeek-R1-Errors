Question:
Mary has 30 sheep. She gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half every day. How much milk does she collect every day?

Correct Answer:
Half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15.
Mary gets (15 * 1) + (15 * 2) = <<15*1+15*2=45>>45 kg of milk every day.
#### 45

Gold:
45

Wrong Prediction:
45\

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many sheep Mary has. She has a total of 30 sheep.

Next, I'll divide the sheep into two equal groups. Half of 30 sheep is 15 sheep.

Mary gets 1 kg of milk from each group of 15 sheep.

So, for each day, she collects 1 kg from the first 15 sheep and 2 kg from the remaining 15 sheep.

Adding these together, she collects a total of 3 kg of milk every day.

To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Number of Sheep:**
   
   Mary has a total of **30 sheep**.

2. **Dividing the Sheep:**
   
   Mary divides her sheep into two equal groups:
   
   - **First Group:** 15 sheep
   - **Second Group:** 15 sheep

3. **Milk Production from Each Group:**
   
   - **First Group:** Mary gets **1 kg** of milk from each of these 15 sheep.
   - **Second Group:** Mary gets **2 kg** of milk from each of these 15 sheep.

4. **Calculating Daily Milk Collection:**
   
   - **Milk from First Group:** \( 15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg} \)
   - **Milk from Second Group:** \( 15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg} \)
   
   - **Total Daily Milk Collection:** \( 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg} \)

**Final Answer:**

Mary collects **45 kg** of milk every day.

\[
\boxed{45\ \text{kg}}
\]
