Question:
It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.  It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.  After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.  How much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken?

Correct Answer:
It takes 20*.4=8 more minutes to go from 300 to 400 degrees than from room temperature to 300
So it takes 20+8=<<20+8=28>>28 minutes to warm up
So the total warming time was 28+20=<<28+20=48>>48 minutes
So it took 48-5=<<48-5=43>>43 minutes to cook the chicken
So it took 48+43=<<48+43=91>>91 minutes to make the chicken.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here about cooking chicken with oil, and I need to figure out the total time it takes from starting the oil until the chicken is cooked. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

It says: It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, how much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken?

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.

First part: It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. So, that's straightforward—20 minutes initial warming.

Then, it says it takes 40% longer to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. So, I need to figure out how much time that is. 40% longer than 20 minutes. Let me calculate that.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, 40% longer would be 20 + 8 = 28 minutes. Therefore, heating from 300 to 400 takes 28 minutes.

Wait, hold on—is that correct? Because heating from 300 to 400 is 100 degrees, right? So, 40% longer in temperature might not necessarily mean 40% longer in time. Hmm, the question says, "It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees." So, it's talking about the additional time needed beyond the initial 20 minutes.

So, the first part is 20 minutes to get to 300. Then, from 300 to 400 is 40% longer. So, 40% of 20 minutes is 8 minutes, so 20 + 8 = 28 minutes. That seems right.

So, heating from 300 to 400 takes 28 minutes.

Now, after warming the oil to 400 degrees, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, I need to figure out how long it takes to cook the chicken after reaching 400 degrees.

Wait, what is being heated after warming? Is it just the oil heating up to 400, or is the chicken being cooked in the oil? Hmm, the problem says "it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil." So, the cooking time is less than the warming time.

So, if warming the oil from 0 to 400 degrees took 28 minutes, then cooking the chicken would take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes? Is that it?

Wait, hold on. Let me think again. So, heating the oil to 400 degrees took 28 minutes, and then cooking the chicken takes 5 minutes less than that. So, yes, 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

So, if that's the case, then the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the initial 20 minutes to warm to 300, plus 28 minutes to warm to 400, plus 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

So, adding those up: 20 + 28 + 23.

Let me calculate that: 20 + 28 is 48, and 48 + 23 is 71.

So, 71 minutes total. Is that right?

Wait, but hold on, maybe I misread the problem. Let me double-check.

The problem says: "It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees. After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. How much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken?"

So, it's heating the oil from 0 to 300: 20 minutes.

Then, heating from 300 to 400: 40% longer than 20 minutes, which is 28 minutes.

Then, cooking the chicken: 5 minutes less than the warming time. So, 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

Therefore, adding 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes.

Wait, but is the cooking time after warming the oil referring to the entire period, or is it referring to the time from when the oil was warmed at 400 degrees? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the problem says: "After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil." So, the cooking time is 5 minutes less than the warming time, which was 28 minutes. So, cooking is 23 minutes.

So, that seems correct.

But, let me think again: Is the cooking time after warming the oil 5 minutes less than the warming time, which was 28 minutes? So, 28 - 5 = 23 minutes. So, total time is 20 + 28 + 23.

Alternatively, maybe the cooking time is 5 minutes less than the warming time for the oil? Wait, but the problem says: "After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil." So, it's comparing the cooking time to the warming time of the oil. So, the cooking time is 5 minutes less than the warming time to get to 400 degrees.

So, the cooking time is 28 minutes (the time to warm to 400) minus 5 minutes, which is 23 minutes.

Therefore, total time is 20 (warming to 300) + 28 (warming to 400) + 23 (cooking) = 71 minutes.

Wait, is this too straightforward? I wonder if I'm missing something.

Another way to think about it: Maybe the 5 minutes less is the time after warming the oil, meaning that after warming it takes 5 minutes longer to warm it up. But no, the problem says: "It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil." So, that's cooking time = warming time - 5 minutes.

So, I think my original calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps time from start to finish is 71 minutes.

But let me cross-verify.

Another approach: The entire process is: warm oil to 300 (20 min), warm oil to 400 (28 min), cook chicken (unknown). The problem says that cooking time is 5 minutes less than warming time for the oil.

So, the warming time for the oil is 28 minutes, so cooking is 23 minutes.

Total time: 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes.

Alternatively, if we thought that cooking time is 5 minutes less than the 20 minutes, then it would be 15 minutes, but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the cooking time is 5 minutes less than the total warming time (20 + 28 = 48 minutes), so 43 minutes. But that would be wrong because the problem says "after warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil." So, that should be 28 -5 =23.

So, the initial 20, then 28, then 23.

So, 20 + 28 is 48, plus 23 is 71.

Alternatively, maybe is the cooking time after warming the oil is 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil from 0 to 400, which is 28 minutes. So, 28 -5 =23.

Yes, that's correct.

So, 20 + 28 +23=71.

Wait, but hold on, let me check if the problem is in another language, because sometimes problems say "after warming the oil it takes...", but sometimes it's ambiguous.

Wait, let me read it again:

"It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees. After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil."

So, the key is: first, 20 minutes to 300. Then, 40% longer to 400. Then, after warming the oil (to 400), it takes 5 minutes less to cook than it took to warm up the oil.

So, the cooking time is 5 minutes less than the warming time to 400, which is 28.

So, 28 -5=23.

So, yeah, 20 +28 +23=71.

Alternatively, is the cooking time 5 minutes less than the total warming time? That would be 20 +28=48, 48 -5=43. But that's not what the problem says.

The problem says: "After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil."

So, it's comparing the cooking time to the warming time, not to the total.

So, the cooking time is 5 minutes less than the warming time, which is 28 minutes.

So, 28-5=23.

Therefore, total time is 20 + 28 +23=71 minutes.

So, I think that's the answer.

But just to make sure, let me think of another perspective.

Suppose, after warming the oil to 400 degrees, it takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm the oil to 400 degrees. So, if warming to 400 took 28 minutes, then cooking takes 23.

So, yes, 20 +28 +23=71.

Alternatively, maybe 40% longer is 20 minutes, so 28 minutes. Then, 5 minutes less than that is 23. So, yes.

Alternatively, maybe the total time is 20 (warm to 300) + 28 (warm to 400) +23 (cook)=71.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Wait, is 40% longer a percentage of the initial 20 minutes, or is it 40% of the total?

The problem says: "It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees."

So, if the initial time is 20 minutes, then 40% longer is 20 + 0.4*20=28 minutes, which is correct.

So, 28 minutes.

Then, after warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, the cooking time is 28 -5=23 minutes.

So, 20 +28 +23=71.

So, I think 71 is the answer.

But just to be thorough, let me try to think if the "it takes 40% longer" could be interpreted differently.

If it's 40% longer in the sense of 40% more than the previous 20 minutes, so 20 + 8=28. So, that's 40% of 20, which is correct.

Alternatively, if the 40% is of the desired temperature, but no, the problem doesn't specify. It's about the heating time.

So, yeah, 20 minutes to warm to 300, 40% longer to warm to 400: 28 minutes, then cook for 23.

So, total is 71 minutes.

I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is \boxed{71} minutes.
</think>

It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up the oil to the desired temperature of 400 degrees. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.

1. The initial heating time to 300 degrees is 20 minutes.
2. The time to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees is 40% longer than 20 minutes. This is calculated as:
   \[
   0.4 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, the total time to heat up to 400 degrees is:
   \[
   20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. The cooking time after warming the oil is 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil to 400 degrees. This is:
   \[
   28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]
4. Adding up all the times:
   \[
   20 \text{ (to warm to 300)} + 28 \text{ (to warm to 400)} + 23 \text{ (to cook)} = 71 \text{ minutes}
   \]

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is \boxed{71} minutes.
