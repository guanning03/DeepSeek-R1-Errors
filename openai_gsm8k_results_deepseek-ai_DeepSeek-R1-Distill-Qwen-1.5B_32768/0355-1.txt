Question:
Bryce and four of his friends each ordered their own pizzas after football practice. Each pizza had 12 slices. Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. How many slices of pizza were left?

Correct Answer:
Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.
#### 18

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the number of slices each pizza has. Since each pizza has 12 slices and there are four friends in total, including Bryce, each pizza is divided into 12 slices.

Next, calculate how many slices each person consumed. Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which amounts to 8 slices per pizza (2/3 of 12). The remaining friend ate ¾ of their pizza, consuming 9 slices.

Finally, subtract the total number of slices consumed from the total number of slices available to find the number of slices left.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Number of friends:** 4 (Bryce and his 3 friends)
- **Slices per pizza:** 12
- **Bryce and 2 friends ate:** \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas.
- **Remaining 2 friends ate:** \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices.**

\[
4 \text{ friends} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 48 \text{ slices}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many slices each person ate.**

- **Bryce and 2 friends:**
  
  \[
  \text{Slices eaten} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices per person}
  \]
  
  For 3 people:
  
  \[
  3 \text{ people} \times 8 \text{ slices} = 24 \text{ slices}
  \]

- **Remaining 2 friends:**
  
  \[
  \text{Slices eaten} = \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices per person}
  \]
  
  For 2 people:
  
  \[
  2 \text{ people} \times 9 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices eaten.**

\[
24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices}
\]

**Step 4: Determine the number of slices left.**

\[
\text{Slices left} = \text{Total slices} - \text{Slices eaten} = 48 - 42 = 6 \text{ slices}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{6}
\]
