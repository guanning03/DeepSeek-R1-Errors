Question:
John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?

Correct Answer:
He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.
So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.

Wrong Answer:
To determine John's running speed, I'll start by calculating the total distance he runs each day.

John runs 60 miles in total across three days. On the first day, he runs 3 hours. 

Since he runs half as much on the other two days, I'll find the distance for those days by dividing the first day's distance by 2. 

This means each of the other two days he runs 1.5 miles.

Adding these together, the total distance for the three days is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 miles.

Finally, to find his average speed, I'll divide the total distance by the total time. 

So, his average speed is 6 miles divided by 3 hours, which equals 2 miles per hour.

To determine how fast John runs, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total Weekly Distance:** 
   - John runs **60 miles** each week.

2. **Days He Runs:**
   - He runs **3 days** a week.

3. **Distance on the First Day:**
   - He runs **3 hours** (which we'll assume is in miles per hour, so the units are consistent).

4. **Distance on the Other Two Days:**
   - He runs half as much on each of the other two days.

Let's calculate the distance he runs each day:

- **First Day:**  
  \( 3 \text{ hours} \) (since it's given as hours, we'll assume this is miles per hour).

- **Other Two Days:**  
  Each day is half of the first day:  
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ miles per day}
  \]

Now, let's add up the distances to find the total weekly distance:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Finally, to find his average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \boxed{2} \text{ miles per hour}
\]

\(\boxed{2}\) miles per hour
