Question:
Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?

Correct Answer:
First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%
Then find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3
Now multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24
Finally, multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .24 * 100% = <<.24*100=24>>24%

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so Marcus is trying to decide if he needs to do his homework tomorrow. There are a few probabilities here, and I need to figure out the chance he has to turn in his homework. Let's break it down step by step.

First, there's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher. If that happens, I think the homework might not get collected because the teacher isn't there. So, if Marcus has a substitute, he probably won't have his homework. So, that's 50% chance that he can't get his homework from the substitute.

Then, even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give him an extension. Hmm, so regardless of whether he has a substitute or not, there's a 40% chance she'll give him some help. So, that's like an additional 40% chance of turning in his homework but not having to do it all by himself.

But wait, even if the teacher doesn't give him an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince his dog to steal his assignment. So, even if the teacher doesn't give him an extension, he can still get an extra one from the teacher. That's another 20%.

So, putting this all together, I think we need to calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework. That would happen if either he has a substitute, or if he gets an extension from the teacher, or if he gets an extension from the teacher by his dog.

Wait, actually, let me make sure. So, if he has a substitute, he can't get his homework. If he doesn't have a substitute, but the teacher gives him an extension, he can still turn in his homework. But if the teacher doesn't give him an extension, there's a 20% chance he can get an extension from the dog. So, his homework is only turned in if neither the teacher gives an extension nor the dog gives an extension.

So, the probability he has to turn in his homework is the complement of the probability that he gets at least one extension. So, maybe I should calculate the probability of getting an extension from either the teacher or the dog, and subtract that from 100%.

Let me try to structure this.

First, the chance of having a substitute teacher is 50%. If that happens, he can't get his homework. So, the probability he can't get his homework because of a substitute is 50%.

Then, if there is a substitute, he can still get an extension from the teacher with a 40% chance. But wait, is that 40% regardless of whether he has a substitute, or conditional on having a substitute? The problem says "there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension." So, maybe that's unconditional. So, the overall probability that the teacher gives an extension is 40%, but if there's a substitute, that might affect it? Or is it still 40% regardless.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify any dependency between the substitute and the teacher's extension. It just says 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, maybe it's independent.

Similarly, if the teacher doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can get an extension by his dog. So, that's another 20%, independent of the teacher's extension.

So, perhaps the total probability of Marcus getting an extension is the probability the teacher gives an extension plus the probability the teacher doesn't give an extension but the dog does.

So, let's denote:

Let A be the event that Marcus has a substitute teacher. P(A) = 50% or 0.5.

Let B be the event that the teacher gives an extension. P(B) = 40% or 0.4.

Let C be the event that the dog steals the assignment and gives an extension. P(C) = 20% or 0.2.

But we need to find the probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework, which is the complement of the probability that he gets at least one extension. So, P(not (B or C)).

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, P(B or C) = P(B) + P(C) - P(B and C).

But wait, are B and C independent? Since the problem doesn't specify any relationship between the substitute teacher and the teacher's extension, nor between the teacher's extension and the dog's extension, I think we can assume that B, C, and their joint events are independent.

So, P(B and C) = P(B) * P(C) = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08.

Therefore, P(B or C) = 0.4 + 0.2 - 0.08 = 0.52.

So, the probability that Marcus gets at least one extension is 52%. Therefore, the probability that he has to turn in his homework is 1 - 0.52 = 0.48, which is 48%.

Wait, but hold on. Is that correct? Let me double-check.

So, P(not A) = 0.5, and within that, he might get an extension. So, the probability he has to do his homework is (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)) * (1 - P(C)). Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, if P(A) is the substitute, then he can't get his homework. So, the probability he can get his homework is (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)) * (1 - P(C)). But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me represent all possibilities.

There are four possible scenarios:

1. Substitute teacher (A occurs): 0.5. In this case, he can't get his homework, so he has to turn it in. So, probability for this scenario is 0.5, and it's a "has to turn in homework" case.

2. Substitute teacher (A occurs): 0.5. Then, the teacher gives an extension with 40%: 0.4. So, he can get an extension, so he doesn't have to turn in his homework. So, probability is 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.

3. Substitute teacher (A occurs): 0.5. The teacher doesn't give an extension: 0.6. Then, the dog steals the assignment: 0.2. So, he gets an extension from the dog, so he doesn't have to turn in homework. So, probability is 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06.

4. No substitute teacher (A doesn't occur): 0.5. Then, the teacher gives an extension with 40%: 0.4. So, he gets an extension, doesn't have to turn in homework. Probability: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.

5. No substitute teacher (A doesn't occur): 0.5. The teacher doesn't give an extension: 0.6. Then, the dog steals the assignment: 0.2. So, he gets an extension from the dog. Probability: 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06.

6. No substitute teacher (A doesn't occur): 0.5. The teacher doesn't give an extension: 0.6. The dog doesn't steal the assignment: 0.8. So, he doesn't get any extension. So, he has to turn in his homework. Probability: 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24.

Now, let's add up all the probabilities where he has to turn in his homework:

1. Substitute teacher and extension from teacher: 0.2

2. Substitute teacher, no extension, dog steals: 0.06

6. No substitute teacher, no extension, no dog steal: 0.24

Adding these up: 0.2 + 0.06 + 0.24 = 0.5

Wait, that's 50%. Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 48%. So, which one is correct?

Wait, so in the first approach, I thought P(B or C) = 0.48, so 1 - 0.48 = 0.52, but in this second approach, I added up the probabilities where he has to turn in homework and got 0.5. So, which is correct?

Wait, hold on, in the second approach, I considered all possible cases where he has to turn in his homework, and in each case, calculated the probability.

But in reality, the events are not independent in the first approach. Because in the first approach, I considered P(B) = 0.4, but if substitute teacher occurs, that affects the probability. However, in reality, in the second approach, we considered all four scenarios, each with their own probabilities, but in the first approach, I considered P(B) regardless of substitute.

So, perhaps the way to do it correctly is to compute the overall probability.

Wait, maybe another way to think about it: the probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework is the probability that he doesn't get an extension from the teacher and doesn't get an extension from the dog.

So, that's (1 - P(B)) * (1 - P(C)) multiplied by the probability that a substitute teacher is present or not?

Wait, no, because P(B) is the probability that the teacher gives an extension, regardless of whether he has a substitute or not. Similarly, P(C) is the probability that the dog steals the assignment, regardless of whether the teacher gives an extension.

Wait, maybe we can model it as:

P(having to turn in homework) = P(A) * 0 + (1 - P(A)) * [P(B) + P(C) - P(B and C)].

Wait, that might be the way to go.

So, first, if there is a substitute teacher (A occurs), he can't get his homework, so that's 0 probability.

If there isn't a substitute teacher (A doesn't occur), then he has a 40% chance of getting an extension from the teacher, and a 20% chance of getting an extension from the dog. So, the total probability of getting at least one extension is P(B) + P(C) - P(B and C) = 0.4 + 0.2 - 0.08 = 0.52, as before.

Therefore, the probability that he has to turn in his homework is (1 - P(A)) * 0.52 = 0.5 * 0.52 = 0.26, which is 26%.

Wait, but that contradicts my previous calculations. So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as two separate probabilities: first, whether he has a substitute, and if not, whether he gets an extension from the teacher and/or the dog.

So, the total probability he has to turn in his homework is:

P(A) * 0 + (1 - P(A)) * [P(B) + P(C) - P(B and C)]

So, that would be 0 + 0.5 * (0.4 + 0.2 - 0.08) = 0.5 * 0.52 = 0.26, which is 26%.

But in my previous calculation, I added up all the probabilities where he had to turn in homework: 0.2 + 0.06 + 0.24 = 0.5. So, which is correct?

Wait, let me list all the possibilities:

1. Substitute teacher and teacher gives extension: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2

2. Substitute teacher and no extension: 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

   Then, dog steals: 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06

3. No substitute teacher and teacher gives extension: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2

4. No substitute teacher and no extension: 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

   Then, dog steals: 0.3 * 0.8 = 0.24

So, total probabilities where he has to turn in homework are 0.2, 0.06, and 0.24, which add up to 0.5.

But in my other approach, I considered P(A) * 0 + (1 - P(A)) * [P(B) + P(C) - P(B and C)] which gave 0.26. So, these are conflicting results.

So, which is correct? Let's think.

The problem is that in the first approach, I considered that if substitute is present, he cannot get his homework, regardless of extension. But in reality, the substitute teacher's presence is independent of the teacher's extension.

Wait, no, the teacher's extension is a separate event.

Wait, perhaps the two events (substitute teacher and teacher extension) are independent, as are the dog's extension.

So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the overall probability.

Wait, so perhaps the probability that Marcus gets an extension is:

P(A) * 0 + (1 - P(A)) * [P(B) + P(C) - P(B and C)]

Which is 0 + 0.5 * [0.4 + 0.2 - 0.08] = 0.5 * 0.52 = 0.26.

But in my earlier approach, I considered that if substitute teacher is present, he can't get the homework, regardless of the teacher's extension.

So, in that case, the probability he has to turn in homework is (1 - P(A)) * [P(B) + P(C) - P(B and C)].

But in that case, 0.5 * 0.52 = 0.26.

But in the other approach, I considered all the possible cases where he has to turn in homework and added them up, which gave 0.5.

So, why the discrepancy?

Wait, because in the second approach, I considered all the possible combinations of events, which included both substitute and no substitute, and whether extensions were given.

But in reality, if he has a substitute teacher, he can't get the homework regardless of the teacher's extension. So, if substitute teacher is present, he can't get his homework, whether teacher gives extension or not.

But if substitute teacher is absent, then the teacher gives an extension with 40%, and then the dog gives an extension with 20% if the teacher didn't give an extension.

Wait, so in that case, the probability he has to turn in homework is:

P(A) * 0 + (1 - P(A)) * [P(B) + P(C) - P(B and C)]

Which is 0 + 0.5 * 0.52 = 0.26.

But in the other approach, I considered all four cases and added up the probabilities where he has to turn in homework, which was 0.2 + 0.06 + 0.24 = 0.5.

So, which one is correct? I think the second approach is correct because it considers all the possible scenarios and their respective probabilities.

Wait, but let's think in another way.

Let me represent the events.

Let A: Substitute teacher (50% chance).

Let B: Teacher gives extension (40% if no substitute).

Let C: Dog steals (20% if no teacher gives extension).

We need to find the probability that Marcus has to turn in homework, which is (A and not B and not C) or (not A and B and not C) or (not A and not B and C).

So, the probability is:

P(A) * P(not B) * P(not C) + P(not A) * P(B) * P(not C) + P(not A) * P(not B) * P(C)

Calculating each term:

P(A) = 0.5

P(not B) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6

P(not C) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

So, first term: 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24

Second term: P(not A) = 0.5

P(B) = 0.4

P(not C) = 0.8

Second term: 0.5 * 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.16

Third term: P(not A) = 0.5

P(not B) = 0.6

P(C) = 0.2

Third term: 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06

Adding up all three terms: 0.24 + 0.16 + 0.06 = 0.46

Wait, that's 46%.

Hmm, but in my earlier calculation, I had 0.2 + 0.06 + 0.24 = 0.5, which is 50%.

So, now, using this third approach, I get 0.46, which is 46%.

But in the first approach, I got 0.26, which is 26%.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, let's think about it again.

If substitute teacher is present (50% chance), then Marcus can't get his homework, regardless of the teacher or the dog.

If substitute teacher is absent (50% chance), then:

- With 40% chance, the teacher gives an extension.

- With 60% chance, the teacher doesn't give an extension.

   - With 20% chance, the dog steals the assignment.

   - With 80% chance, the dog doesn't steal.

So, let's compute the probability he has to turn in homework.

Case 1: Substitute teacher present (50% chance) => 0 probability.

Case 2: Substitute teacher absent (50% chance):

   Subcase 2a: Teacher gives extension (40% of 50% = 20% of overall probability) => 0 probability.

   Subcase 2b: Teacher doesn't give extension (60% of 50% = 30% of overall probability):

      Sub-subcase 2b1: Dog steals (20% of 30% = 6% of overall probability) => 0 probability.

      Sub-subcase 2b2: Dog doesn't steal (80% of 30% = 24% of overall probability) => 1 probability.

So, the overall probability he has to turn in homework is 24%.

Wait, that's 24%, which is 0.24. But that's only if substitute teacher is absent. However, in the previous approach, when I calculated (1 - P(A)) * [P(B) + P(C) - P(B and C)] = 0.5 * 0.52 = 0.26, that's 26%.

But in the third approach, using all possible cases, it's 0.24.

So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the confusion is in the way I model the events.

In the third approach, I considered all four cases:

- Substitute teacher and teacher extension

- Substitute teacher and no teacher extension but dog steal

- Substitute teacher and no teacher extension and no dog steal

- No substitute teacher and teacher extension

- No substitute teacher and no teacher extension but dog steal

- No substitute teacher and no teacher extension and no dog steal

Then, I calculated the probabilities where he has to turn in homework: 0.2, 0.06, 0.24, which add up to 0.5.

But in the other approach, I considered the overall probability as (1 - P(A)) * [P(B) + P(C) - P(B and C)] which is 0.5 * 0.52 = 0.26.

But in the third approach, when I broke it down, it's 24%, which is 0.24.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that in the third approach, I didn't account for the fact that if the teacher doesn't give an extension, the dog can steal, but that is considered in the third term.

Wait, but in the third approach, when I broke it down further, I considered the different cases.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should use a tree diagram.

Let me try that.

First branch: Substitute teacher (50%) and no substitute (50%).

If Substitute is present:

   Then, no matter what happens with teacher and dog, Marcus cannot get his homework. So, 50% chance he has to turn in homework.

If Substitute is absent:

   Then, 40% chance teacher gives extension, 60% no teacher.

      If teacher gives extension:

         20% chance dog steals, 80% no dog steal.

         So, if teacher gives and dog steals: 40% * 20% = 8% chance.

         If teacher gives and no dog steal: 40% * 80% = 32% chance.

      If teacher doesn't give:

         60% chance, then dog steals: 20% chance, 80% no steal.

         So, 60% * 20% = 12% chance.

         60% * 80% = 48% chance.

So, now, let's calculate the probabilities of each outcome:

1. Substitute and teacher and dog: 0

2. Substitute and teacher and no dog: 0

3. Substitute and no teacher and dog: 0

4. Substitute and no teacher and no dog: 0

5. No substitute and teacher and dog: 8%

6. No substitute and teacher and no dog: 32%

7. No substitute and no teacher and dog: 12%

8. No substitute and no teacher and no dog: 48%

So, the only cases where Marcus has to turn in homework are (5), (6), and (7), which add up to 8% + 32% + 12% = 52%.

Wait, that's 52%, which is 0.52.

But earlier, in the second approach, when I considered the different cases, I added up the probabilities of (0.2 + 0.06 + 0.24) = 0.5.

Wait, so now I get conflicting results: 52% vs 50%.

Wait, what's the discrepancy?

In the tree diagram approach, I have 52% as the probability he has to turn in homework.

In the other approach, I have 50%.

Which one is correct?

Wait, in the tree diagram approach, we have:

- Substitute (50%): 0 probability.

- Substitute (50%):

   - teacher gives extension (40%): 0 probability.

   - teacher doesn't give extension (60%):

      - dog steals (20%): 0 probability.

      - dog doesn't steal (80%): 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48.

- No substitute (50%):

   - teacher gives extension (40%): 0 probability.

   - teacher doesn't give extension (60%):

      - dog steals (20%): 0 probability.

      - dog doesn't steal (80%): 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48.

So, the total probability he has to turn in homework is 0.48.

Wait, so that's 48%. Which is 0.48.

But in the previous tree diagram, I had 52%. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps in the second approach, I'm not accounting for the correct conditional probabilities.

Wait, let's see: in the second approach, I considered:

P(not A) * [P(B) + P(C) - P(B and C)] = 0.5 * (0.4 + 0.2 - 0.08) = 0.5 * 0.52 = 0.26.

But in reality, in the tree diagram, the total probability is 48%.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, let me structure this.

The two different approaches are considering different scenarios.

First approach:

- If there's a substitute teacher (50%), he can't get his homework.

   If there's a substitute teacher AND teacher gives extension (40%) AND dog steals (20%), he still can't get his homework.

   So, the only way he can still get his homework is if both the teacher doesn't give extension and the dog doesn't steal.

   So, P(not A) * [1 - P(B) - P(C) + P(B and C)].

Wait, P(not A) * [1 - P(B) - P(C) + P(B and C)].

So, 0.5 * [1 - 0.4 - 0.2 + 0.08] = 0.5 * [0.48] = 0.24.

Wait, that's 24%.

But if that's the case, then Marcus has a 24% chance of turning in homework if he has a substitute teacher and 48% if he doesn't have a substitute teacher.

Wait, so maybe the correct way is to compute P(Has homework) = P(Has homework | Substitute) * P(No Substitute) + P(Has homework | No Substitute).

So, P(Has homework) = 0 * 0.5 + [P(No Substitute) * (1 - P(B) - P(C) + P(B and C))] = 0 + 0.5 * 0.48 = 0.24.

Wait, that's 24%.

But in the tree diagram, I had 52%.

Wait, now I'm really confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it step by step.

Let me denote:

Event A: Substitute teacher (50% chance)

Event B: Teacher gives extension (40% if no substitute)

Event C: Dog steals (20% if no teacher gives extension)

We need to find the probability that Marcus has to turn in homework, which is the probability that he is not given an extension.

So, P(not (B or C)) = 1 - P(B or C).

Assuming B and C are independent events.

So, P(B or C) = P(B) + P(C) - P(B and C).

But in this case, are B and C independent?

P(B and C) = P(B) * P(C) = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08.

So, P(B or C) = 0.4 + 0.2 - 0.08 = 0.52.

Therefore, P(not (B or C)) = 1 - 0.52 = 0.48.

But that would be if the events were independent, which they might not be.

Wait, but in reality, the presence of a substitute teacher and the dog's action are independent, so perhaps it is independent.

Therefore, P(not (B or C)) = 0.48.

But then, in the tree diagram, I had 52%.

Wait, perhaps I misrepresented the tree diagram.

Wait, in the tree diagram, I considered the different paths:

1. Substitute and teacher and dog: 0

2. Substitute and teacher and no dog: 0

3. Substitute and no teacher and dog: 0

4. Substitute and no teacher and no dog: 0

5. No substitute and teacher and dog: 8%

6. No substitute and teacher and no dog: 32%

7. No substitute and no teacher and dog: 12%

8. No substitute and no teacher and no dog: 48%

So, the only paths where Marcus has to turn in homework are 5, 6, and 7, which add to 8% + 32% + 12% = 52%.

But that's inconsistent with the inclusion-exclusion approach.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, in the tree diagram, I considered each path as separate. So, the 52% is the sum of probabilities of all paths where he has to turn in homework.

But in the inclusion-exclusion approach, I considered only the paths where there's no substitute teacher and the teacher and dog didn't give an extension, which is 48%.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the confusion is whether the dog's steal is conditional on the teacher not giving extension.

In other words, if the teacher gives an extension, does the dog's steal happen? Or is it independent?

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension."

So, perhaps the presence of a substitute teacher is independent of the teacher's extension.

Similarly, the dog's steal is independent.

Therefore, the events are independent.

Therefore, P(B and C) = P(B) * P(C) = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08.

Therefore, P(B or C) = 0.4 + 0.2 - 0.08 = 0.52, so P(not (B or C)) = 0.48.

But in the tree diagram, I considered all the possibilities, which gives 52%.

Wait, so this is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the tree diagram is wrong because it's assuming all combinations, but in reality, if a substitute teacher is present, the dog's steal is not a separate event.

Wait, no, the dog's steal is separate.

Wait, maybe the tree diagram is not considering that if substitute teacher is present, the dog's steal is not considered.

Wait, but the problem is that if substitute teacher is present, then the teacher's extension is irrelevant. So, the dog's steal is irrelevant.

But in the tree diagram, I considered all possibilities, so it's 52%, which is 0.52, but the inclusion-exclusion approach gives 0.48.

So, which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is wrong because it assumes that the dog's steal is independent of the teacher's extension, which may not be the case.

But wait, in the problem statement, the dog's steal is a separate event, and the teacher's extension is another. So, they are independent.

Therefore, P(B and C) = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08, so P(B or C) = 0.52, so P(not (B or C)) = 0.48.

But in the tree diagram, I'm getting 52%.

Wait, perhaps the tree diagram is wrong because it's considering all the possibilities, but in reality, if substitute teacher is present, the dog's steal is irrelevant.

Wait, in the tree diagram, I considered all four cases, which is:

- Substitute and teacher and dog: 0

- Substitute and teacher and no dog: 0

- Substitute and no teacher and dog: 0

- Substitute and no teacher and no dog: 0

- No substitute and teacher and dog: 8%

- No substitute and teacher and no dog: 32%

- No substitute and no teacher and dog: 12%

- No substitute and no teacher and no dog: 48%

So, the only paths where he has to turn in homework are 5, 6, 7: 8% + 32% + 12% = 52%.

But according to the inclusion-exclusion approach, it's 0.48.

So, which one is correct.

Wait, I think the confusion is in the fact that the two approaches are considering different things.

In the tree diagram, we are considering all possible scenarios, which includes substitute teacher and dog steal, substitute teacher and no dog steal, no substitute teacher and dog steal, and no substitute teacher and no dog steal.

But in reality, if substitute teacher is present, dog steal is not a separate event because the substitute teacher is already present.

Therefore, in the tree diagram, perhaps we should not consider the dog steal in the case where substitute teacher is present.

Wait, so perhaps the correct way is to condition on the substitute teacher.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should represent this in a formula.

Let me denote:

Let A be the event that Marcus has a substitute teacher.

Let B be the event that the teacher gives an extension.

Let C be the event that the dog steals the assignment.

We need to find P(not (B or C)).

Assuming that A, B, and C are independent.

Then, P(B or C) = P(B) + P(C) - P(B)P(C).

So, if A, B, C are independent, then P(not (B or C)) = 1 - P(B) - P(C) + P(B)P(C).

So, plugging in the numbers:

P(not (B or C)) = 1 - 0.4 - 0.2 + 0.4*0.2 = 1 - 0.6 + 0.08 = 0.48.

So, Marcus has a 48% chance of having to turn in homework.

But wait, in the tree diagram approach, I had 52%.

Wait, but if A, B, and C are independent, then the tree diagram should reflect that.

Wait, but in the tree diagram, when we have substitute teacher, dog steal doesn't occur, so the dog steal is 0.

Similarly, if no substitute teacher, dog steal is 20%.

But in the inclusion-exclusion approach, we have:

P(not A) * [1 - P(B) - P(C) + P(B)P(C)] = 0.5 * [1 - 0.4 - 0.2 + 0.4*0.2] = 0.5 * [0.48] = 0.24.

But in the tree diagram, it's different.

Wait, maybe I should model it as:

P(not A) * [P(not B) * P(not C)]

But P(not B) is 1 - P(B) = 0.6

P(not C) is 1 - P(C) = 0.8

But if substitute teacher is there, then P(not B) doesn't apply.

Wait, no, it's better to think in terms of conditional probabilities.

When A occurs, then P(not B) = 1 (since substitute teacher is present, so teacher can't give extension or dog steal), but in reality, if substitute teacher is present, the dog steal is not a separate event.

Wait, this is so confusing.

I think perhaps the correct approach is to model it using the inclusion-exclusion principle considering that the dog steal is only relevant if substitute teacher is absent.

Therefore, the total probability he has to turn in homework is:

P(A) * 0 + P(not A) * [P(not B) * P(not C) + P(B) * P(not C) * P(not D) + P(not B) * P(C) * P(not D) + P(B) * P(C) * P(not D))].

Wait, that seems complicated, but perhaps that's the correct way.

Wait, no, actually, it's:

If there is substitute teacher, he can't get the homework, regardless of extension and dog.

If there is no substitute teacher, then:

- If teacher gives extension, dog steals: 40% extension, 20% dog steal.

- If teacher gives extension, dog doesn't steal: 40% extension, 80% no dog steal.

- If teacher doesn't give extension, dog steals: 60% no extension, 20% dog steal.

- If teacher doesn't give extension, dog doesn't steal: 60% no extension, 80% no dog steal.

So, in all these cases, the probability he has to turn in homework is:

- Substitute: 0

- No substitute:

   - Teacher gives, dog steals: 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08

   - Teacher gives, dog doesn't steal: 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32

   - Teacher doesn't give, dog steals: 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.12

   - Teacher doesn't give, dog doesn't steal: 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48

So, the total is 0.08 + 0.32 + 0.12 + 0.48 = 1.0.

Wait, that can't be. That would mean he always has to turn in homework if there is no substitute.

But in reality, if there is no substitute, he might not have to turn in homework if the teacher doesn't give extension and the dog doesn't steal.

Wait, this is conflicting.

Wait, actually, in the no substitute case, the probability that he has to turn in homework is 1 - P(B or C).

So, 1 - 0.52 = 0.48.

So, if he has a substitute teacher, he can't get homework, so 0.

If he doesn't have a substitute teacher, then:

- 48% chance he has to turn in homework.

So, overall:

P(having to turn in homework) = P(A) * 0 + (1 - P(A)) * P(not B or not C)

Which is 0 + 0.5 * P(not B or not C)

But P(not B or not C) = 1 - P(B and C) = 0.52.

So, 0.5 * 0.52 = 0.26.

Wait, that's 26%.

But in the tree diagram, I had 52%, which is 0.52.

Wait, why the difference.

Wait, in the tree diagram, I considered all four cases, which gave 52%, but in the formula, it's 26%.

Hmm, so I think the correct formula is:

P(having to turn in homework) = P(A) * 0 + (1 - P(A)) * P(not B or not C)

Which is 0 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.08) = 0.5 * 0.92 = 0.46.

Wait, that's 46%.

Wait, that still doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 1 - P(A and B and C) = 1 - 0.5 * 0.4 * 0.2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. No, that can't be.

Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps let's model the events:

- A: Substitute teacher (50%)

- B: Teacher gives extension (40%)

- C: Dog steals (20%)

We need P(not B or not C) = 1 - P(B and C) = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92.

But if substitute teacher is present, P(not B and not C) = 1.

Therefore, P(not B or not C) = P(A) * 1 + (1 - P(A)) * 0.92 = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0.92 = 0.5 + 0.46 = 0.96.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, that formula is wrong because if A occurs, not B or not C is 1, so the correct way is:

P(not B or not C) = P(not B or not C) = P(not B) + P(not C) - P(not B and not C).

But if A occurs, then P(not B) is not applicable because A implies the teacher can't give extension.

Wait, no, it's getting too tangled.

Wait, let me use the law of total probability.

Law of total probability states that:

P(not B or not C) = P(not B or not C | A) P(A) + P(not B or not C | not A) P(not A).

So, first, P(not B or not C | A) = 1, because if A occurs, he can't get any extension or dog steal.

P(not B or not C | not A) = 1 - P(B and C) = 0.52.

Therefore, P(not B or not C) = 1 * 0.5 + 0.52 * 0.5 = 0.5 + 0.26 = 0.76.

Wait, 0.76, which is 76%.

But in the previous tree diagram, I had 52%.

Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe I should compute it as follows:

P(not B or not C) = 1 - P(B and C) = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92.

But in reality, if substitute teacher is present, then B and C are irrelevant.

So, P(not B or not C) = P(not B or not C) = P(not B) + P(not C) - P(not B and not C).

But P(not B) is 1 - P(B) = 0.6.

P(not C) is 1 - P(C) = 0.8.

P(not B and not C) is 1 - P(B or C) = 1 - 0.52 = 0.48.

Therefore, P(not B or not C) = 0.6 + 0.8 - 0.48 = 0.92.

So, that's 92%.

But how does that reconcile with the previous definitions?

Wait, perhaps it's better to just compute it step by step.

P(not B or not C) = P(not B) + P(not C) - P(not B and not C).

If A occurs (substitute teacher), then P(not B and not C) = 1.

So, P(not B or not C | A) = 1.

Therefore, P(not B or not C) = P(A) * 1 + P(not A) * P(not B or not C | not A).

Now, P(not B or not C | not A) = P(not B) + P(not C) - P(not B and not C) = (1 - 0.4) + (1 - 0.2) - (1 - 0.4 - 0.2 + 0.4*0.2) = 0.6 + 0.8 - 0.48 = 0.92.

So, P(not B or not C) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0.92 = 0.5 + 0.46 = 0.96.

Wait, 0.96 is 96%.

Hmm, now I'm even more confused.

Wait, ultimately, I think the correct answer is 48%, because that's the probability of not getting an extension or the dog stealing.

But in the tree diagram, I had 52%. So, which is correct.

Wait, let me think about it in another way.

Assuming all events are independent:

P(having homework) = P(have substitute) * 0 + P(not have substitute) * [1 - P(homework given by teacher) - P(dog steals) + P(homework given by teacher) * P(dog steals)]

Which is 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * [1 - 0.4 - 0.2 + 0.4 * 0.2] = 0.5 * [0.48] = 0.24.

So, 24% chance.

But if events are independent, but dog's steal is conditional on teacher not giving extension, then P(not B or not C) = 1 - P(B) - P(C) + P(B)P(C) = 0.48.

But in the tree diagram, 52% is 0.52, which is higher.

Wait, so which is correct.

I think the key is whether the dog's steal is conditionally independent on the teacher not giving extension.

If so, then P(not B or not C) = 1 - 0.4 - 0.2 + 0.4*0.2 = 0.48.

But in reality, the dog's steal is not a separate event if the teacher doesn't give extension.

Therefore, when the teacher doesn't give extension, the dog's steal is a separate event.

Therefore, in that case, the total probability is:

P(not A) * [1 - P(B) - P(C) + P(B)P(C)] = 0.5 * 0.48 = 0.24.

But wait, that's 24%.

But in the tree diagram, when substitute teacher is present, he doesn't have homework regardless of extension and dog.

When substitute is absent, he has 48% chance.

So, 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0.48 = 0.24.

But the tree diagram was showing 52%.

So, maybe I need to reconcile the two.

Wait, perhaps the tree diagram was wrong because when substitute teacher is present, the dog steal is not a separate event.

Wait, in the tree diagram, when substitute teacher is present, dog steal is not a separate event.

So, in the tree diagram, when substitute is present, dog steal is 0.

But in reality, when substitute is present, dog steal is not independent.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The dog steal is independent of the teacher's extension.

Therefore, when substitute is present, dog steal is 0, but teacher's extension can still happen.

Wait, but in the tree diagram, the dog steal is considered as 0 when substitute is present.

So, in that case, the tree diagram is correct.

But that would mean, when substitute is present, dog steal is 0, and teacher's extension is irrelevant.

But in reality, maybe the dog steal is not 0 when substitute is present.

Wait, in the problem statement, it just says that if no substitute teacher comes, there's a 40% chance a teacher gives an extension, and the dog steals with 20% chance.

It doesn't specify anything else.

So, perhaps, in the case of no substitute, dog steal is 0.

Wait, that is, if substitute is present, then dog steal is irrelevant.

So, when substitute is present, teacher's extension is irrelevant.

Therefore, in the tree diagram, when substitute is present, dog steal is 0.

So, in the tree diagram, it's correct.

Therefore, the tree diagram is 52%, but according to the inclusion-exclusion approach, it's 0.48.

But according to the law of total probability, it's 0.24.

This is very confusing.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 48%, as in the inclusion-exclusion approach, because it's considering the dog steal as 0 when substitute is present.

But in reality, dog steal is 0 only when substitute is present.

So, is the dog steal 0 when substitute is present, or is it 20% regardless?

In the problem statement, it says "if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension." So, maybe it's a 40% chance regardless of substitute.

Wait, no, perhaps it's 40% if no substitute.

So, in the problem statement, it's "if no substitute teacher comes, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension."

So, if substitute teacher is present, then the teacher wouldn't give an extension.

But the dog steal is a separate thing.

Wait, so when substitute teacher is present, dog steal is irrelevant, so dog steal is 0.

When no substitute teacher is present, dog steal is 20%.

Therefore, in the tree diagram, when substitute teacher is present, dog steal is 0.

Therefore, in the tree diagram, it's correct.

Therefore, the total probability is 52%.

But according to the inclusion-exclusion approach, it's 0.48.

So, why the discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the law of total probability is incorrect because it's considering substitute teacher and dog steal.

Wait, no, it's correct.

Wait, in the tree diagram, the probability is 52%.

But in the inclusion-exclusion approach, it's 0.48.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 52%, because when substitute teacher is present, dog steal is irrelevant, so the dog steal is 0.

But in reality, the dog steal is 20% regardless.

Wait, no, but when substitute teacher is present, dog steal is 0.

So, in the tree diagram, it's correct.

Wait, but when substitute teacher is present, dog steal is 0, and teacher's extension is irrelevant.

Therefore, in the tree diagram, the probability is 52%.

But according to the inclusion-exclusion approach, it's 0.48.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 52%.

But since the problem says "even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension," which is likely independent of substitute teacher.

Similarly, the dog steal is 20% regardless.

Therefore, in the tree diagram, since substitute teacher is 50%, when present, dog steal is 0, and when absent, dog steal is 20%.

Therefore, the tree diagram is correct, giving 52%.

So, maybe the correct answer is 52%.

But then why the inclusion-exclusion approach gave 0.48.

Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is incorrect because the events are not independent.

Wait, in the inclusion-exclusion approach, I assumed that B and C are independent, but in reality, they are not.

Because if substitute teacher is present, dog steal is 0.

Therefore, P(B and C) = P(B) * P(C | substitute is present) * P(substitute is present) + P(C | substitute is not present) * P(substitute is not present)

Wait, no, actually:

Wait, P(B and C) = P(B) * P(C) if they are independent.

But in reality, if substitute teacher is present, C is 0.

Therefore, P(B and C) = P(B) * P(C) - P(B) * P(C | substitute is present) * P(substitute is present)

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, P(B and C) = P(B) * P(C | B) * P(B) + P(not B) * P(C | not B) * P(not B)

But in reality, when B occurs, C is 0.

So, P(B and C) = P(B) * 0 * 0.5 + P(not B) * 0.2 * 0.5 = 0 + 0.8 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.2.

But earlier, I thought P(B and C) = 0.08.

Wait, perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, let me think.

P(B and C) = P(B) * P(C | B).

But if B occurs, then C is irrelevant, but in reality, B and C are not independent because if B occurs, the dog steal is not a separate event.

Wait, in reality, when B occurs, dog steal is not a separate event, so P(C | B) = 0.

Similarly, when not B, then P(C | not B) = 0.2.

So, P(B and C) = P(B) * 0 + P(not B) * 0.2 = 0 + 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.12.

Therefore, P(B or C) = 0.4 + 0.2 - 0.12 = 0.48.

Therefore, P(not B or not C) = 1 - 0.48 = 0.52.

Therefore, the probability he has to turn in homework is 0.52, which is 52%.

Therefore, the correct answer is 52%.

Wait, but earlier, I thought P(B and C) = 0.08, but that was wrong because when B occurs, C is 0, not 0.2.

Therefore, the correct P(B and C) is 0.12, so P(not B or not C) = 0.52.

Therefore, Marcus has a 52% chance of having to turn in homework.

So, in conclusion, the correct answer is 52%, so the percentage is 52%.

**Final Answer**
The percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is \boxed{52\%}.
</think>

To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of various events affecting his situation.

1. **Substitute Teacher**: There is a 50% chance a substitute teacher will come, in which case Marcus won't get his homework.
2. **Teacher Extension**: There is a 40% chance the teacher will give Marcus an extension, regardless of whether a substitute teacher is present.
3. **Dog Steal**: If a substitute teacher is not present, there is a 40% chance the teacher will give Marcus an extension and a 20% chance the dog will steal.

We use the law of total probability to find the probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework.

First, we define the events:
- \( A \): Substitute teacher comes (50% chance).
- \( B \): Teacher gives an extension (40% chance).
- \( C \): Dog steals (20% chance).

We need to find \( P(\text{not } (B \text{ or } C)) \).

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{not } (B \text{ or } C)) = 1 - P(B \text{ and } C) \]

We calculate \( P(B \text{ and } C) \):
- If a substitute teacher comes, \( C \) is irrelevant, so \( P(C | A) = 0 \).
- If no substitute teacher comes, \( C \) is 20%.

Thus,
\[ P(B \text{ and } C) = P(B) \cdot P(C | \text{not } A) \cdot P(\text{not } A) \]
\[ P(B \text{ and } C) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.04 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(\text{not } (B \text{ or } C)) = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96 \]

However, considering the tree diagram approach, we find the probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework is 52%.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{52\%}
\]
