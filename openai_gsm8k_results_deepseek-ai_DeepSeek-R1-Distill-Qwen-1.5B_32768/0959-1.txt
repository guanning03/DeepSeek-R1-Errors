Question:
Jason works as a salesperson at a car dealership.  He needs to sell 15 cars this month to earn a big bonus.  He knows based on historical averages, that for every 25 telephone calls he makes to potential customers, he gets one person to come into the car dealership to look at new cars.  And for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car.  Based on these average numbers, how many telephone calls would Jason need to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus?

Correct Answer:
If it takes 2 customers to make one sale, then to get his 15 sales Jason will need 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 customers to come into the car dealership.
Since Jason needs to make 25 telephone calls to get one person to come into the dealership, to get 30 customers, Jason must make 25*30=<<25*30=750>>750 telephone calls.
#### 750

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the ratio of cars sold to telephone calls made. For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 person to look at cars.

Next, calculate the number of telephone calls needed to sell 15 cars by dividing the total number of cars by the number of cars sold per telephone call. This gives 375 telephone calls.

Then, find out how many telephone calls are needed per sale by dividing the total number of telephone calls by the number of cars sold. This results in 187.5 telephone calls.

Finally, since Jason can't make half a call, round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jason needs to make 188 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Cars Sold per Telephone Call:**
   - For every **25 telephone calls**, Jason gets **1 person** to look at cars.
   
2. **Cars Sold per Car Visit:**
   - For every **2 customers** that come into the dealership, **1 customer** buys a car**.

3. **Total Cars to Sell:**
   - Jason needs to sell **15 cars**.

4. **Calculating Telephone Calls:**
   - **Step 1:** Determine how many telephone calls are needed to get 15 cars sold.
     - Since 25 telephone calls yield 1 car, to get **15 cars**, Jason needs:
     \[
     \text{Telephone Calls} = 25 \times 15 = 375 \text{ telephone calls}
     \]
   
5. **Calculating Calls per Sale:**
   - **Step 2:** Determine how many telephone calls are needed per sale.
     - For every **2 cars**, Jason sells **1 car**. Therefore, to sell **15 cars**, Jason needs:
     \[
     \text{Telephone Calls per Sale} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ telephone calls}
     \]
   
6. **Total Telephone Calls Needed:**
   - **Step 3:** Multiply the telephone calls per sale by the total number of cars to get the total telephone calls required:
     \[
     \text{Total Telephone Calls} = 30 \times 15 = 450 \text{ telephone calls}
     \]
   
However, considering the rounding up for half a call and the initial calculation, Jason **needs to make**:

\[
\boxed{450}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Jason needs to make \boxed{450} telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.
