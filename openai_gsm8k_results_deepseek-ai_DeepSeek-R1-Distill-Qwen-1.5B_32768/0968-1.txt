Question:
In one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more. How many books have they read altogether?

Correct Answer:
If Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more in the next hour, he has read a total of 300+150=<<300+150=450>>450
Since Ezra reads twice as many books as Ahmed, Ahmed has read 450/2=<<450/2=225>>225 books.
Together, Ahmed and Ezra has read 225+450=<<225+450=675>>675 books
#### 675

Wrong Answer:
To determine the total number of books Ezra and Ahmed have read, I start by noting that in one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Given that Ezra read 300 books, Ahmed must have read half of that, which is 150 books.

Ezra then decided to read an additional 150 books. Adding this to his original count, Ezra now has 300 + 150 = 450 books read in total.

Finally, by adding both Ezra's and Ahmed's totals together, the combined number of books they've read is 450 + 150 = 600 books.

Let's determine the total number of books Ezra and Ahmed have read step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of books Ahmed read
- **Given:** Ezra read **300 books** in one hour.
- **Given:** Ezra read **twice as many books as Ahmed**.
  
Let \( A \) represent the number of books Ahmed read.

\[
\text{Ezra's books} = 2 \times \text{Ahmed's books} \\
300 = 2A \\
\Rightarrow A = \frac{300}{2} = 150
\]

So, Ahmed read **150 books**.

### Step 2: Calculate the new total for Ezra
- **Given:** Ezra decided to read **150 more books**.
  
\[
\text{New total for Ezra} = 300 + 150 = 450
\]

### Step 3: Determine the total number of books read by both
- **Total for Ezra**: 450 books
- **Total for Ahmed**: 150 books

\[
\text{Combined total} = 450 + 150 = \boxed{600}
\]

### **Final Answer**
\boxed{600}
