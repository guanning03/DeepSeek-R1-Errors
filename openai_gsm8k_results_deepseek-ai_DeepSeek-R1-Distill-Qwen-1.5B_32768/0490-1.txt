Question:
Tim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party.  For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?

Correct Answer:
Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch
In addition, he will make 4 regular gallons of lemonade, which each need 1 cup juice so 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups total
All total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice
Each cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many cups of lemonade Tim initially planned to make. Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and he needs 4 gallons, that's 4 cups of lemon juice.

Next, I'll calculate the number of lemons needed for 4 cups of lemon juice. Given that 6 lemons yield 1 cup, 4 cups would require 24 lemons.

Additionally, Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that's twice as tart as the others. This means each of the 4 gallons needs an extra 24 lemons, totaling 48 lemons.

Finally, by combining the initial 4 cups (24 lemons) with the additional 48 lemons for the extra gallon, Tim will need a total of 72 lemons for all the lemonade.

To determine how many lemons Tim needs, let's break down the requirements step by step.

1. **Lemonade for the Party:**
   - Tim needs to make **4 gallons** of lemonade.
   - **1 gallon** requires **1 cup** of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, **4 gallons** will require **4 cups** of lemon juice.

2. **Lemons for the Initial Lemonade:**
   - **6 lemons** yield **1 cup** of juice.
   - To find out how many lemons are needed for **4 cups**:
     \[
     4 \text{ cups} \times \frac{6 \text{ lemons}}{1 \text{ cup}} = 24 \text{ lemons}
     \]

3. **Additional Lemonade for Allen:**
   - Allen wants **1 extra gallon** of lemonade.
   - **1 gallon** requires **1 cup** of lemon juice, so **1 extra gallon** will need **1 additional cup** of lemon juice.
   - **1 cup** of lemon juice requires **6 lemons**.
   - Therefore, **1 cup** of lemon juice for the extra lemonade:
     \[
     1 \text{ cup} \times \frac{6 \text{ lemons}}{1 \text{ cup}} = 6 \text{ lemons}
     \]
   - **Total for the extra gallon**:
     \[
     24 \text{ lemons} + 6 \text{ lemons} = 30 \text{ lemons}
     \]

4. **Total Lemons Needed:**
   - **Initial lemonade** requires **24 lemons**.
   - **Additional lemonade** requires **30 lemons**.
   - **Total**:
     \[
     24 \text{ lemons} + 30 \text{ lemons} = 54 \text{ lemons}
     \]

Therefore, Tim will need \(\boxed{54}\) lemons in total.
