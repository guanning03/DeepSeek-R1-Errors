Question:
Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs $100. He has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of them and gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. How many cards did he start with?

Correct Answer:
He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150
He sold 100 cards because 150 / 1.5 = <<150/1.5=100>>100
The cards he sold were 2/3 of his collection because 1 - (1/3) = 2/3
He started with 150 cards because 100 / (2/3) = <<100/(2/3)=150>>150
#### 150

Wrong Answer:
To determine how many Pokemon cards Kenny started with, I need to calculate the total amount of money he has after selling his cards and then figure out how many cards he needs to sell to reach that total.

First, Kenny plans to sell each card for $1.50 and keep 1/3 of the cards. He also has $50 in spending cash when he goes to the amusement park.

Let's denote the total number of cards he starts with as \( x \).

Each card sells for $1.50, so the revenue from selling \( x \) cards is \( 1.50x \).

He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.

The money he has after selling the cards is \( 1.50x - \frac{2}{3}x \).

Simplifying this, he has \( 0.50x \) left after keeping 1/3 of the cards.

He uses $50 for transportation and spending, so the total money he has is \( 0.50x + 50 \).

This total must be equal to the cost of the amusement park ticket, which is $100.

Setting up the equation:
\[ 0.50x + 50 = 100 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 0.50x = 50 \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{0.50} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 100 Pokemon cards.

To determine how many Pokemon cards Kenny started with, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Cost of amusement park ticket:** \$100
- **Selling price per card:** \$1.50
- **Amount of spending cash:** \$50
- **Fraction of cards kept:** \( \frac{1}{3} \)

**Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny starts with.**

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all cards:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = \$1.50 \times x
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of cards kept and sold:**
   - **Cards kept:** \( \frac{1}{3}x \)
   - **Cards sold:** \( x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \)

3. **Calculate the total money after selling the cards:**
   \[
   \text{Money after selling} = \$1.50 \times \frac{2}{3}x = 1.50 \times \frac{2}{3}x = 1.00x
   \]

4. **Add the spending cash to the money after selling:**
   \[
   \text{Total money} = \$1.00x + \$50
   \]

5. **Set up the equation since the total money must equal the amusement park ticket cost:**
   \[
   1.00x + 50 = 100
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   1.00x = 100 - 50
   \]
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{100}
\]
