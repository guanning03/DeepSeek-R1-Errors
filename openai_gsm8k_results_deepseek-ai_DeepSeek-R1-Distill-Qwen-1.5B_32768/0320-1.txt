Question:
Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year.  She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.  Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine.  How many magazines does she get every year?

Correct Answer:
She has 3 magazines that send 12 issues so that’s 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 issues
Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine so that’s 4*6 = <<4*6=24>>24 issues
All total she receives 36+24+6 = <<36+24+6=66>>66 magazine issues a year
#### 66

Gold:
66

Wrong Prediction:
42

Wrong Answer:
First, I identify the number of each type of magazine Susan receives.

She has one magazine that sends 6 issues per year.

The second magazine sends her 12 issues a year, which is double the 6 issues magazine.

The third magazine sends her 4 times the 6 issues magazine, which is 24 issues per year.

Next, I add up the issues from all three magazines to find the total number of issues per year.

Finally, since each magazine she receives contributes one copy to her collection, the total number of magazines she gets every year is the sum of the issues divided by the issues each magazine sends per year.

Let's determine how many magazines Susan gets every year by analyzing the information provided:

1. **Magazines and Their Issues:**
   - **Magazine A:** Sends **12 issues** a year.
   - **Magazine B:** Sends **6 issues** a year.
   - **Magazine C:** Sends **4 times the amount of Magazine B**, which is \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues.

2. **Total Issues per Year:**
   \[
   \text{Total Issues} = 12 \, (\text{Magazine A}) + 6 \, (\text{Magazine B}) + 24 \, (\text{Magazine C}) = 42 \, \text{issues}
   \]

3. **Number of Magazines per Year:**
   - Since each magazine Susan receives contributes one copy to her collection, the total number of magazines she gets every year is equal to the total number of issues she receives.
   \[
   \text{Number of Magazines} = 42
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{42}
\]
