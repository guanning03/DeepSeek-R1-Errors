Question:
Faraday owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $2 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $8. If Faraday earned $26 from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Faraday able to sell after 3 days?

Correct Answer:
Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.
So he was able to sell a total of 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 sunflowers from the bouquets.
And he was able to sell a total of $26/$2= <<26/2=13>>13 Sunflowers.
The sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 84 + 13 = <<84+13=97>>97.
Therefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 x 3 = <<97*3=291>>291.

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine how many bouquets Faraday sold in a day. He earned a total of $56 from the bouquet, and each bouquet sells for $8. Dividing $56 by $8 gives 7 bouquets sold per day.

Next, I'll calculate the number of sunflowers sold with each bouquet. Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. Multiplying 7 bouquets by 12 sunflowers per bouquet results in 84 sunflowers sold daily.

Finally, to find out how many sunflowers were sold over 3 days, I'll multiply the daily sales by 3. This gives 84 sunflowers multiplied by 3, resulting in 252 sunflowers sold in total.

To determine how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   
   - **Revenue from bouquets per day:** \$56
   - **Price per bouquet:** \$8
   
   \[
   \text{Number of bouquets per day} = \frac{\$56}{\$8/\text{bouquet}} = 7 \text{ bouquets/day}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of sunflowers sold per bouquet:**
   
   - **Sunflowers per bouquet:** 12
   
   \[
   \text{Sunflowers per bouquet} = 12 \text{ sunflowers/bouquet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold daily:**
   
   \[
   \text{Sunflowers sold per day} = 7 \text{ bouquets/day} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers/bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers/day}
   \]

4. **Find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total sunflowers sold} = 84 \text{ sunflowers/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 252 \text{ sunflowers}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{252}
