Question:
John makes himself a 6 egg omelet with 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham.  Eggs are 75 calories each.  Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.  Ham is 40 calories per ounce.  How many calories is the omelet?

Correct Answer:
The eggs contributed 6*75=<<6*75=450>>450 calories
He eats 2*120=<<2*120=240>>240 calories of cheese
He eats 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 calories of ham
So in total he eats 450+240+80=<<450+240+80=770>>770 calories
#### 770

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total weight of the cheese and ham in the omelet.

The omelet contains 6 eggs, and each egg weighs 2 ounces. So, the total weight of the eggs is 6 multiplied by 2 ounces, which equals 12 ounces.

There is an equal amount of ham as there are eggs, so the ham also weighs 12 ounces.

Next, I'll calculate the total calories from each ingredient.

Each egg contributes 75 calories, so 6 eggs contribute 6 multiplied by 75 calories, which is 450 calories.

The cheese provides 120 calories per ounce, so 12 ounces of cheese contribute 12 multiplied by 120 calories, totaling 1,440 calories.

The ham provides 40 calories per ounce, so 12 ounces of ham contribute 12 multiplied by 40 calories, which equals 480 calories.

Finally, I'll add up all the calories to find the total calorie content of the omelet: 450 calories from eggs, 1,440 calories from cheese, and 480 calories from ham, resulting in a total of 2,370 calories.

To determine the total number of calories in John's omelet, we'll calculate the calories contributed by each ingredient separately and then sum them up.

### Given:
- **Number of eggs**: 6
- **Weight per egg**: 2 oz
- **Calories per egg**: 75
- **Weight of cheese**: 12 oz (equal to the number of eggs)
- **Calories per ounce of cheese**: 120
- **Weight of ham**: 12 oz (equal to the number of eggs)
- **Calories per ounce of ham**: 40

### Step 1: Calculate Calories from Eggs
\[
\text{Calories from eggs} = \text{Number of eggs} \times \text{Calories per egg} = 6 \times 75 = 450 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Calories from Cheese
\[
\text{Calories from cheese} = \text{Weight of cheese (oz)} \times \text{Calories per ounce} = 12 \times 120 = 1,440 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Calories from Ham
\[
\text{Calories from ham} = \text{Weight of ham (oz)} \times \text{Calories per ounce} = 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Calories
\[
\text{Total calories} = \text{Calories from eggs} + \text{Calories from cheese} + \text{Calories from ham} = 450 + 1,440 + 480 = 2,370 \text{ calories}
\]

\[
\boxed{2370}
\]
