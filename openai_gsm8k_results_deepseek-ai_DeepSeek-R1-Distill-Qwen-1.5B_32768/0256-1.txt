Question:
Juliaâ€™s boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?

Correct Answer:
It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.
Thus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.
In those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.
Thus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.
#### 16

Gold:
16

Wrong Prediction:
12.8

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how long it takes Julia to row 64 feet. Since she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, I can calculate the time per foot by dividing 16 seconds by 20 feet, which equals 0.8 seconds per foot.

Next, I'll multiply the time per foot by the total distance to find the total time taken to reach shore: 0.8 seconds/foot * 64 feet = 51.2 seconds.

Now, I need to calculate the amount of water the boat took on during this time. The boat takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find the total water consumption, I'll divide the total distance by 10 and then multiply by 2 liters: (64 feet / 10) * 2 liters = 12.8 liters.

Therefore, by the time Julia reaches shore, the boat has taken on 12.8 liters of water.

To determine how much water the boat took on by the time Julia reached shore, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Time to Reach Shore**

Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. To find the time it takes her to row 64 feet:

\[
\text{Time per foot} = \frac{16 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ feet}} = 0.8 \text{ seconds per foot}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 64 \text{ feet} \times 0.8 \text{ seconds per foot} = 51.2 \text{ seconds}
\]

### **Step 2: Calculate the Amount of Water Taken**

The boat takes **2 liters** of water for every **10 feet** rowed. To find the total water consumption for 64 feet:

\[
\text{Water consumption} = \left( \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 12.8 \text{ liters}
\]

### **Final Answer**

By the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on:

\[
\boxed{12.8 \text{ liters}}
\]
