Question:
Maggie's oven is malfunctioning. When she sets it to 450 the actual temperature is 468. If it's off by the same percentage for any recipe, what temperature should she set it at if her recipe calls for 520 degrees?

Correct Answer:
The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18
The oven is off by 4% because 18 / 450 x 100 = <<18/450*100=4>>4%
Therefore X + .04X = 520
Therefore 1.04X = 520
The temperature to set it is 500 because 520 / 1.04 = <<520/1.04=500>>500

Wrong Answer:
To solve the problem, I'll start by understanding the relationship between the oven temperature and the actual temperature.

First, I'll determine the percentage by which the oven is malfunctioning. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but the actual temperature is 468 degrees. To find the percentage deviation, I'll use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Deviation} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Percentage Deviation} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

Next, I'll apply this percentage deviation to the new recipe requirement of 520 degrees. 

\[
\text{Malfunctioned Temperature} = 520 \times (1 - 0.04) = 520 \times 0.96 = 499.2\degree
\]

Finally, I'll round the result to the nearest whole number for clarity.

\[
\text{Final Temperature} \approx 499\degree
\]

To determine the correct temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Percentage Deviation:**

   The oven is currently set to **450 degrees**, but the actual temperature is **468 degrees**. The deviation is:

   \[
   \text{Percentage Deviation} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

2. **Apply the Same Percentage Deviation to the New Recipe Requirement:**

   The recipe calls for **520 degrees**. Applying the **4% deviation**:

   \[
   \text{Malfunctioned Temperature} = 520 \times (1 - 0.04) = 520 \times 0.96 = 499.2\degree
   \]

3. **Round to the Nearest Degree:**

   \[
   \text{Final Temperature} \approx 499\degree
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{499}
\]
