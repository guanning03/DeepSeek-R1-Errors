Question:
James wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?

Correct Answer:
First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet
Now do the same multiplication to find out how much crepe paper James needs for the short sides: 15 feet * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 feet
Now add the amounts for the short and long sides together to find the total amount of crepe paper needed: 40 feet + 30 feet = <<40+30=70>>70 feet
#### 70

Gold:
70

Wrong Prediction:
70\

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total length of the fence around the backyard, which is the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the sum of the length and the width. 

Given that the long side of the fence is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet, the perimeter will be calculated as follows:

Perimeter = 2 × (20 feet + 15 feet) = 2 × 35 feet = 70 feet.

Since James wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from each post, he needs as much crepe paper as there is along the fence. Therefore, he should buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we'll calculate the perimeter of his rectangular backyard. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
\]

Given:
- **Length of the long side** = 20 feet
- **Width of the short side** = 15 feet

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (20\ \text{feet} + 15\ \text{feet}) = 2 \times 35\ \text{feet} = 70\ \text{feet}
\]

Therefore, James needs to buy:

\[
\boxed{70\ \text{feet}}
\]

of crepe paper.
