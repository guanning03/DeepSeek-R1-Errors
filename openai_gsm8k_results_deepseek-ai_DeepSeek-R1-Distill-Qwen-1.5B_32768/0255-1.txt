Question:
At the trip to the county-level scavenger hunt competition, 90 people were required to split into groups for the competition to begin. To break people up into smaller groups with different leaders, 9-person groups were formed. If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each, how many seashells did they bring?

Correct Answer:
Since the total number of people at the competition was 90, they formed 90/9=<<90/9=10>>10 groups after splitting into 9-person groups.
If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bringing back 2 seashells each, then 3/5*10=<<3/5*10=6>>6 groups had members bringing back 2 seashells.
Since each group had 9 people, the number of people in the 6 groups, who found 2 seashells each, was 6*9= <<6*9=54>>54.
The total number of seashells the 54 people brought is 54*2=<<54*2=108>>108 seashells.

Wrong Prediction:
12

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how many groups there are in total. Since there are 90 people and each group has 9 people, I'll divide 90 by 9 to find there are 10 groups.

Next, I'll calculate how many people brought back seashells. It's given that 3/5 of the number of groups each had members brought back seashells. So, I'll multiply 10 by 3/5 to find that 6 groups brought back seashells.

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells, so I'll multiply 6 by 2 to find a total of 12 seashells brought back by all the groups.

Therefore, the total number of seashells they brought is 12.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of groups:**
   
   - Total number of people: 90
   - Number of people per group: 9
   
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of groups that brought seashells:**
   
   - Fraction of groups that brought seashells: \(\frac{3}{5}\)
   
   \[
   \text{Number of groups with seashells} = 10 \times \frac{3}{5} = 6 \text{ groups}
   \]

3. **Find the total number of seashells brought:**
   
   - Number of seashells per group: 2
   
   \[
   \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
