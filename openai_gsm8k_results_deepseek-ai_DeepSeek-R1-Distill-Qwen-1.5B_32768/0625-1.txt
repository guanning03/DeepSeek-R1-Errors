Question:
In a grocery store, four apples cost $5.20, and three oranges cost $3.30. How much will Clyde pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges?

Correct Answer:
Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.
Each orange cost $3.30/3 = $<<3.30/3=1.10>>1.10.
So 5 apples cost $1.30 x 5 = $<<5*1.30=6.50>>6.50.
And 5 oranges cost $1.10 x 5 = $<<5*1.1=5.50>>5.50.
Thus, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $<<6.5+5.5=12>>12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the cost per apple by dividing the total cost of 4 apples by 4. This gives $1.30 per apple.

Next, determine the cost per orange by dividing the total cost of 3 oranges by 3, which is $1.10 per orange.

Finally, calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges by multiplying the number of each fruit by their respective costs and adding the results together. This gives a total of $14.80.

To determine how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, follow these steps:

1. **Find the cost per apple:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per apple} = \frac{\$5.20}{4} = \$1.30
   \]

2. **Find the cost per orange:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per orange} = \frac{\$3.30}{3} = \$1.10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = (5 \text{ apples} \times \$1.30) + (5 \text{ oranges} \times \$1.10) = \$6.50 + \$5.50 = \boxed{\$14.80}
   \]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{\$14.80}\)
