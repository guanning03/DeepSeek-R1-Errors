Question:
Mr. Tan sold his house for $400 000. He paid the transfer fees that amount to 3% of the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price. If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?

Correct Answer:
Mr. Tan paid $400 000 x 3/100 = $12 000 for the transfer fees.
He paid $400 000 x 5/100 = $20 000 for the brokerage fee.
So, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.
Hence, Mr. Tan's net proceeds is $400 000 - $282 000 = $118 000.

Wrong Prediction:
618,000

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total amount Mr. Tan received from selling his house, which is $400,000.

Next, I'll calculate the transfer fees, which amount to 3% of the selling price. This is calculated as 0.03 multiplied by $400,000, resulting in $12,000.

Then, I'll calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price. This is calculated as 0.05 multiplied by $400,000, resulting in $20,000.

After deducting both the transfer fees and brokerage fees from the selling price, the proceeds from the sale are $400,000 minus $12,000 minus $20,000, which equals $368,000.

Finally, I'll add the amount he paid for the remaining loan, which is $250,000, to the proceeds to determine the net proceeds. This totals $368,000 plus $250,000, resulting in a net proceeds of $618,000.

To determine Mr. Tan's **net proceeds** from selling his house, we need to account for all costs associated with the sale and then subtract these costs from the total selling price.

1. **Total Selling Price:** 
   \[
   \$400,\!000
   \]

2. **Transfer Fees (3% of Selling Price):**
   \[
   3\% \text{ of } \$400,\!000 = 0.03 \times 400,\!000 = \$12,\!000
   \]

3. **Brokerage Fee (5% of Selling Price):**
   \[
   5\% \text{ of } \$400,\!000 = 0.05 \times 400,\!000 = \$20,\!000
   \]

4. **Total Costs:**
   \[
   \$12,\!000 + \$20,\!000 = \$32,\!000
   \]

5. **Proceeds After Deducting Costs:**
   \[
   \$400,\!000 - \$32,\!000 = \$368,\!000
   \]

6. **Net Proceeds After Adding Loan Amount:**
   \[
   \$368,\!000 + \$250,\!000 = \$618,\!000
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{618,\!000}
\]
