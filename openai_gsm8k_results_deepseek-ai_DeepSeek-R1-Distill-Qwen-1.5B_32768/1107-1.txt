Question:
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, college student Kimo has three 1-hour  classes each day.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day.  In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school.  In one semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?

Correct Answer:
Kimo spends 3 x 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours in class on any given Monday, Wednesday or Friday.
Each week, he spends 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 hours in class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
In one semester, he spends 9 x 16 = <<9*16=144>>144 hours in class for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
He spends 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours in class on any given Tuesday or Thursday.
Each week, he spends 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.
In one semester, he spends 8 x 16 = <<8*16=128>>128 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.
In total for one semester, Kimo spends 144 + 128 = <<144+128=272>>272 hours attending classes.

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll identify the days Kimo has classes and the number of classes per day.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. That's 3 days multiplied by 3 hours, totaling 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. That's 2 days multiplied by 4 hours, totaling 8 hours per week.

Adding these together, Kimo spends 9 hours on weekdays and 8 hours on weekends, totaling 17 hours per week.

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 17 hours per week multiplied by 16 weeks.

To determine how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the schedule for Kimo's classes:**
   - **Weekdays (Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays):** 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour.
   - **Weekends (Tuesdays, Thursdays):** 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours.

2. **Calculate the total class time per week:**
   - **Weekdays:** 
     \[
     3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/day} = 3 \text{ hours/week}
     \]
   - **Weekends:**
     \[
     2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ hours/week}
     \]
   - **Total per week:**
     \[
     3 \text{ hours (weekdays)} + 4 \text{ hours (weekends)} = 7 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total class time for the semester:**
   - **Number of weeks in the semester:** 16
   \[
   7 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 112 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{112}
\]
