Question:
On Tuesday, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes. On Monday he exercised for 16 minutes. How many minutes does he have to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal?

Correct Answer:
On Sunday and Monday he exercised a total of 39 minutes because 23 + 16 = <<23+16=39>>39
On Tuesday he has to exercise for 78 minutes because 39 x 2 = <<39*2=78>>78
#### 78

Gold:
78

Wrong Prediction:
39

Wrong Answer:
First, determine the total exercise time Peter had on both Monday and Sunday.

On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes, and on Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. Adding these together gives 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Peter's goal is to exercise twice the total time he spent on these two days. Therefore, his target exercise time on Tuesday is 2 * 39 = 78 minutes.

To find out how much more he needs to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal, subtract his current exercise time from his target: 78 - 39 = 39 minutes.

Thus, Peter needs to exercise for 39 minutes on Tuesday.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Monday's Exercise Time:**  
   Peter exercised for **16 minutes** on Monday.

2. **Sunday's Exercise Time:**  
   Peter exercised for **23 minutes** on Sunday.

3. **Total Exercise Time on Monday and Sunday:**  
   \[
   16 \text{ minutes (Monday)} + 23 \text{ minutes (Sunday)} = 39 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Peter's Goal for Tuesday:**  
   He wants to exercise **twice** the total time he did on Monday and Sunday combined.  
   \[
   2 \times 39 \text{ minutes} = 78 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Exercise Time Needed on Tuesday:**  
   To reach his goal of **78 minutes**, Peter needs to exercise:  
   \[
   78 \text{ minutes} - 39 \text{ minutes} = 39 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{39}
\]
