Question:
Sasha and Julie are best friends playing on opposing basketball teams. The teams have two practice games scheduled. In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. Sasha always struggles during away games and their second match was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. How many total points did Sasha score during both games?

Correct Answer:
In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points, and Julie scored four fewer points: 14-4 = <<14-4=10>>10 points.
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 points fewer than Julie's score in the first game, meaning she scored 10-6=<<10-6=4>>4 points.
Sasha scored 10+4=<<10+4=14>>14 points in the two games.
#### 14

Gold:
14

Wrong Prediction:
18

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine Sasha's points in the first game. She scored 14 points at home.

Next, I'll calculate Julie's points in the first game. Since she scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, she scored 14 minus 4, which equals 10 points.

Moving on to the second game, which was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Julie scored 10 points, so Sasha scored 10 minus 6, which is 4 points in the second game.

Finally, to find the total points Sasha scored during both games, I'll add her points from the first and second games: 14 plus 4, resulting in a total of 18 points.

To determine the total points Sasha scored during both games, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **First Game (Sasha's Home Court):**
   - **Sasha's Points:** 14 points.
   - **Julie's Points:** Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha.
     \[
     \text{Julie's Points} = 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points}
     \]

2. **Second Game (Sasha's Away Game):**
   - Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game.
     \[
     \text{Sasha's Points in Second Game} = 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total Points Sasha Scored:**
   - **First Game:** 14 points
   - **Second Game:** 4 points
     \[
     \text{Total Points} = 14 + 4 = 18 \text{ points}
     \]

\[
\boxed{18}
\]
