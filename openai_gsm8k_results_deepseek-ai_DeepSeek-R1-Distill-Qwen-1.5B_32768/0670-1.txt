Question:
Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?

Correct Answer:
In the first four days, Tom made 4 * 200 = <<4*200=800>>800 kilometers.
For the next two days, he made only 30/100 * 800 = <<30/100*800=240>>240 kilometers.
During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day, which means 7 * 300 = <<7*300=2100>>2100 kilometers during the whole week.
During his whole trip, Tom made 800 + 240 + 2100 = <<800+240+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers.
#### 3140

Gold:
3140

Wrong Prediction:
1880

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total distance Tom traveled during the first four days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day, so the total for these days is 200 km/day multiplied by 4 days, which equals 800 kilometers.

Next, for the next two days of the first week, Tom traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. Since he traveled 800 kilometers in the first four days, 30% of that is 0.3 times 800, which equals 240 kilometers.

On the fifth day of the first week, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so he covered 0 kilometers.

For the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day. There are two days in this week, so the total distance is 300 km/day multiplied by 2 days, which equals 600 kilometers.

Finally, to find the total distance Tom traveled over the entire two-week trip, I add up the distances from both weeks: 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 600 km, resulting in a total of 1640 kilometers.

To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, let's break down the journey day by day.

### **First Week**

1. **Days 1 to 4:**
   - **Distance per day:** 200 km
   - **Total distance for 4 days:**  
     \[
     200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km}
     \]

2. **Day 5:**
   - **Distance:** 0 km (Tom wasn't traveling)
   - **Total distance so far:**  
     \[
     800 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} = 800 \, \text{km}
     \]

3. **Days 6 and 7:**
   - **Distance per day:** 30% of the first four days  
     \[
     0.3 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km}
     \]
   - **Total distance for 2 days:**  
     \[
     240 \, \text{km/day} \times 2 \, \text{days} = 480 \, \text{km}
     \]
   - **Total distance for the first week:**  
     \[
     800 \, \text{km} + 480 \, \text{km} = 1280 \, \text{km}
     \]

### **Second Week**

4. **Days 8 and 9:**
   - **Distance per day:** 300 km  
   - **Total distance for 2 days:**  
     \[
     300 \, \text{km/day} \times 2 \, \text{days} = 600 \, \text{km}
     \]

### **Total Distance for the Two-Weeks**

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{First Week Distance} + \text{Second Week Distance} = 1280 \, \text{km} + 600 \, \text{km} = 1880 \, \text{km}
\]

\[
\boxed{1880 \text{ kilometers}}
\]
