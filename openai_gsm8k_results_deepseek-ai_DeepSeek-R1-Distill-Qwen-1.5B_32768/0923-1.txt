Question:
Every day Charisma meditates for 15 minutes when she first wakes up and again before she goes to sleep.  5 days a week she practices 1 hour of yoga.  in 4 weeks, how much time has she spent on meditation/yoga practice?

Correct Answer:
She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night for a total of 15+15 = <<15+15=30>>30 minutes
She meditates 30 minutes daily so in 7 days/1 week she meditates 30*7 = <<30*7=210>>210 minutes
She meditates 210 minutes in 1 week so in 4 weeks she meditates 210*4 = <<210*4=840>>840 minutes
60 minutes are in an hour so she meditates for 840/60 = <<840/60=14>>14 hours
She practices yoga for 1 hour 5 days a week so that's 1*5 = <<1*5=5>>5 hours
Over 4 weeks she practices yoga for 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 hours
She spends 14 hours meditating and 20 hours practicing yoga for a total of 14+20 = <<14+20=34>>34 hours
#### 34

Wrong Answer:
To determine the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga over 4 weeks, I'll break down her daily practices and calculate the weekly totals.

First, she meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, which adds up to 30 minutes of meditation each day.

She practices yoga for 1 hour, which is 60 minutes, 5 days a week. Multiplying this by 5 gives 300 minutes of yoga practice per week.

Adding the meditation and yoga times together, Charisma spends 330 minutes each week on these practices.

Finally, to find the total over 4 weeks, I'll multiply the weekly total by 4, resulting in 1,320 minutes.

To determine the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks, let's break down her activities step by step.

### **1. Meditation Practice**
- **Frequency:** Charisma meditates for **15 minutes** when she wakes up and **before she goes to sleep**.
- **Daily Practice:** She meditates twice a day, once in the morning and once at night.
- **Daily Total:** 
  \[
  15\ \text{minutes (morning)} + 15\ \text{minutes (night)} = 30\ \text{minutes}
  \]
- **Weekly Total (5 days):**
  \[
  30\ \text{minutes/day} \times 5\ \text{days/week} = 150\ \text{minutes/week}
  \]

### **2. Yoga Practice**
- **Frequency:** Charisma practices yoga **5 days a week**.
- **Daily Practice:** She practices yoga for **1 hour** (which is **60 minutes**) each time.
- **Weekly Total:**
  \[
  60\ \text{minutes/day} \times 5\ \text{days/week} = 300\ \text{minutes/week}
  \]

### **3. Total Practice per Week**
- **Meditation:** \(150\ \text{minutes}\)
- **Yoga:** \(300\ \text{minutes}\)
- **Combined Total:**
  \[
  150\ \text{minutes} + 300\ \text{minutes} = 450\ \text{minutes/week}
  \]

### **4. Total Practice over 4 Weeks**
- **Weekly Total:** \(450\ \text{minutes}\)
- **Over 4 Weeks:**
  \[
  450\ \text{minutes/week} \times 4\ \text{weeks} = 1,\!800\ \text{minutes}
  \]

To convert minutes into hours:
\[
1,\!800\ \text{minutes} \div 60\ \text{minutes/hour} = 30\ \text{hours}
\]

### **Final Answer**
Charisma has spent a total of \(\boxed{30}\) hours on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks.
