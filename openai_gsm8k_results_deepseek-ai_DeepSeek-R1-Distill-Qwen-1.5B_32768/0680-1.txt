Question:
John is very tired. He decides to take a nap, but he wants to finish his homework first. If John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework and 3 hours before he has to eat dinner, how many minutes does John have to nap?

Correct Answer:
John has to spend 20+40+20 = <<20+40+20=80>>80 minutes on homework.
John has 3 hours*60 minutes= <<3*60=180>>180 minutes before dinner.
Thus, John has 180-80=<<180-80=100>>100 minutes for his nap.
#### 100

Wrong Answer:
First, calculate the total time John has for his homework by adding up the time he needs for each subject: 20 minutes of math, 40 minutes of reading, and 20 minutes of history.

Next, convert the mandatory time before dinner from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours equals 180 minutes.

Finally, subtract the total homework time from the mandatory time before dinner to find out how much time John has to nap.

**Solution:**

John has the following tasks to complete before dinner:

1. **Math Homework:** 20 minutes
2. **Reading Homework:** 40 minutes
3. **History Homework:** 20 minutes
4. ** mandatory time before dinner:** 3 hours

**Step 1: Calculate the Total Time for Homework**

\[
\text{Total Homework Time} = 20\ \text{minutes} + 40\ \text{minutes} + 20\ \text{minutes} = 80\ \text{minutes}
\]

**Step 2: Convert the Mandatory Time Before Dinner to Minutes**

\[
3\ \text{hours} = 3 \times 60\ \text{minutes} = 180\ \text{minutes}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the Time John Has to Nap**

\[
\text{Time to Nap} = \text{Total Mandatory Time} - \text{Total Homework Time}
\]

\[
\text{Time to Nap} = 180\ \text{minutes} - 80\ \text{minutes} = 100\ \text{minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{100\ \text{minutes}}
\]
