Question:
Jenna starts out with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for two rubies. If sapphires are worth $800 and rubies are worth $1200, how much money are all her jewels worth?

Correct Answer:
First find the total number of sapphires Jenna still has: 8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = <<8-3=5>>5 sapphires
Then multiply this number by the cost per sapphire to find the total cost of the sapphires: 5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $<<5*800=4000>>4000
Then find the total value of the rubies: 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $<<2*1200=2400>>2400
Then amount this to the cost of the sapphires to find the total value of her jewelry: $2400 + $4000 = $<<2400+4000=6400>>6400
#### 6400

Wrong Answer:
Jenna begins with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 of them for 2 rubies. Each sapphire is worth $800, so 3 sapphires are worth 3 times $800, which is $2400. Each ruby is worth $1200, so 2 rubies are worth 2 times $1200, which is $2400. Adding the remaining 5 sapphires to the $2400 gives a total of $4800. Therefore, all her jewels are worth $4800.

**Solution:**

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. 

1. **Trade for Rubies:**
   - She trades **3 sapphires** for **2 rubies**.
   - **Value of 3 sapphires:**  
     \( 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800/\text{sapphire} = \$2400 \)
   - **Value of 2 rubies:**  
     \( 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200/\text{ruby} = \$2400 \)

2. **Remaining Sapphires:**
   - She has \( 8 - 3 = 5 \) sapphires left.

3. **Total Value of All Jewels:**
   - **Value from sapphires:**  
     \( 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800/\text{sapphire} = \$4000 \)
   - **Value from rubies:**  
     \( \$2400 \) (from the trade) + \( \$2400 \) (from rubies) = \( \$4800 \)
   - **Total:**  
     \( \$4000 + \$4800 = \$8800 \)

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{8800}
