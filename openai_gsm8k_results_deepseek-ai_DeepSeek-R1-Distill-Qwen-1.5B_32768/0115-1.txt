Question:
John collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes.  The first two have 200 apartments each and the last one is 60% bigger than the other two combined.  He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment.  How much money does he make in a week?

Correct Answer:
The first two complexes have 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 apartments
The third one has 400*.6=<<400*.6=240>>240 more apartments than those 2 combined
So in total, it has 400+240=<<400+240=640>>640 apartments
So he goes to 640+400=<<640+400=1040>>1040 apartments each time
That means he visits 1040*3=<<1040*3=3120>>3120 apartments every week
So he makes 3120*$0.4=$<<3120*0.4=1248>>1248 every week
#### 1248

Wrong Answer:
To determine how much money John makes in a week, I'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The first two complexes each have 200 apartments.
   - Combined, they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.
   - The third complex is 60% bigger than these combined apartments.
   - 60% of 400 is 0.60 * 400 = 240 apartments.
   - Therefore, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

2. **Determine the total number of apartments John collects from in a week:**
   - From the first complex: 200 apartments.
   - From the second complex: 200 apartments.
   - From the third complex: 640 apartments.
   - Total apartments per week: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

3. **Calculate the total payment for the week:**
   - John collects garbage from 1040 apartments.
   - He is paid $0.40 per apartment.
   - Total payment: 1040 * $0.40 = $416.
</think>

To determine how much money John makes in a week, we'll break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**

   - Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
   - Combined, they have:
     \[
     200 \text{ apartments} + 200 \text{ apartments} = 400 \text{ apartments}
     \]
   - The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined apartments of the first two complexes.
   - Calculate 60% of 400 apartments:
     \[
     0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ apartments}
     \]
   - Therefore, the third complex has:
     \[
     400 \text{ apartments} + 240 \text{ apartments} = 640 \text{ apartments}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of apartments John collects from in a week:**

   - From the first complex: 200 apartments.
   - From the second complex: 200 apartments.
   - From the third complex: 640 apartments.
   - Total apartments per week:
     \[
     200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total payment for the week:**

   - John is paid \$0.40 per collection for each apartment.
   - Total payment for the week:
     \[
     1040 \text{ apartments} \times \$0.40 \text{ per apartment} = \$416
     \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{416}
\]
