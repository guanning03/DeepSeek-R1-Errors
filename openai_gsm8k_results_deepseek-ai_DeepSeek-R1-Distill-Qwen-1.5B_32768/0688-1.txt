Question:
Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. The two girls decided to combine their allowance to surprise their father on his birthday. They bought a cake which costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?

Correct Answer:
There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pairs of balloons in 1 dozen.
The cost for buying a dozen balloons was $0.5 x 6 = $<<0.5*6=3>>3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream was $7 x 2 = $<<7*2=14>>14.
The total cost of their purchases is $11 + $3 +$14 = $<<11+3+14=28>>28.
So their mother gave each of them $28/2 = $<<28/2=14>>14.
#### 14

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine the total amount Julia and Nadine spent. They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons at $0.5 each for 2 balloons. 

Next, I'll calculate the cost of the balloons. Since 1 dozen equals 12 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 multiplied by $0.5, which equals $6.

Now, I'll add the cost of the cake and the balloons to find the total expenditure: $11 + $6 = $17.

The total allowance combined is $17. Since Julia and Nadine were given the same amount, I'll divide the total by 2 to find out how much each received: $17 divided by 2 equals $8.50.

Therefore, each of them received $8.50 from their mother.

Let's determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them.

**Given:**
- **Total Allowance Combined:** \( \$17 \)
- **Cost of the Cake:** \( \$11 \)
- **Cost of Balloons:** 1 dozen balloons sold for \( \$0.5 \) each for 2 balloons.
- **Remaining Money:** Spent on 2 tubs of ice cream at \( \$7 \) each.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Cost of Balloons:**
   
   - **Number of Balloons:** 1 dozen = 12 balloons.
   - **Cost per 2 Balloons:** \( \$0.50 \).
   - **Cost for 12 Balloons:** 
     \[
     \frac{12 \text{ balloons}}{2 \text{ balloons per } \$0.50} = 6 \times \$0.50 = \$6
     \]

2. **Determine the Remaining Money After Buying the Cake and Balloons:**
   
   - **Total Expenditure on Cake and Balloons:** 
     \[
     \$11 \text{ (cake)} + \$6 \text{ (balloons)} = \$17
     \]
   - **Remaining Money:** 
     \[
     \$17 \text{ (total)} - \$17 \text{ (expenditure)} = \$0
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Allowance:**
   
   - **Total Allowance Combined:** \( \$17 \)
   - **Total Cost for Ice Cream:** 
     \[
     2 \text{ tubs} \times \$7 \text{ per tub} = \$14
     \]
   - **Remaining Money for Ice Cream:** 
     \[
     \$0 \text{ (remaining after cake and balloons)} - \$14 \text{ (ice cream)} = -\$14
     \]
   
   **Wait, this doesn't make sense.** It seems there's a miscalculation.

4. **Re-evaluate the Remaining Money:**
   
   - **Total Allowance:** Let's denote the total allowance as \( A \).
   - **Total Expenditure:** \( \$11 \) (cake) + \( \$6 \) (balloons) + \( \$14 \) (ice cream) = \( \$31 \).
   - **Remaining Money:** 
     \[
     A - \$31
     \]
   - Since the remaining money was used to buy the ice cream, and they had no money left after buying the cake and balloons, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     A - \$31 = \$0
     \]
     \[
     A = \$31
     \]
   
5. **Determine Each's Share:**
   
   - **Total Allowance:** \( \$31 \)
   - **Each Girl's Share:**
     \[
     \frac{\$31}{2} = \$15.50
     \]

**Final Answer:**

Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{15.50}\) dollars.
