Question:
Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for them?

Correct Answer:
The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine how much each glass costs. The first glass costs $5, and every subsequent glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, I'll calculate the cost for the first 15 glasses. Each of these 15 glasses costs $5, so 15 times $5 equals $75.

The 16th glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Finally, I'll add the cost of the first 15 glasses to the cost of the 16th glass to find the total amount Kylar needs to pay, which is $75 plus $3, totaling $78.
</think>

To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we'll break down the costs as follows:

1. **Price of Each Glass:**
   - **First glass:** \$5
   - **Every second glass:** 60% of \$5 = \$3

2. **Calculating the Total Cost:**
   - **First 15 glasses:** Each costs \$5.
     \[
     15 \text{ glasses} \times \$5/\text{glass} = \$75
     \]
   - **16th glass:** Costs 60% of \$5 = \$3.
     \[
     \$3
     \]
   - **Total Cost:**
     \[
     \$75 + \$3 = \$78
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{78}
\]
