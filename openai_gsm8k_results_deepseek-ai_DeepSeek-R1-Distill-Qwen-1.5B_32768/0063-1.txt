Question:
Ford owns a garden and he grows 40 roses every week. He supplies Roses to the local flower shops. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. How many roses does Ford lack to supply all the flower shops every month?

Correct Answer:
The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.
The second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.
The third flower shop needs 30 x 4 = <<30*4=120>>120 roses every month.
So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Therefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.

Wrong Answer:
To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, I'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses supplied by each flower shop in a month.
   - First shop: 20 roses/week × 12 weeks = 240 roses
   - Second shop: 15 roses/week × 12 weeks = 180 roses
   - Third shop: 30 roses/week × 12 weeks = 360 roses

2. Add the total number of roses supplied by all three shops in a month.
   - 240 + 180 + 360 = 780 roses

3. Multiply the number of weeks in a month by the number of roses Ford grows each week.
   - 12 weeks × 40 roses/week = 480 roses

4. Subtract the total number of roses supplied by the shops from the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
   - 480 roses - 780 roses = -300 roses

Since the result is negative, Ford actually has 300 roses more than he needs to supply all the flower shops in a month.

To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given:
- **Roses grown by Ford per week:** 40
- **Number of weeks in a month:** 12
- **Orders from each flower shop:**
  - **First shop:** 20 roses/week
  - **Second shop:** 15 roses/week
  - **Third shop:** 30 roses/week

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Roses Supplied by Each Shop in a Month
- **First shop:**
  \[
  20 \text{ roses/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 240 \text{ roses}
  \]
  
- **Second shop:**
  \[
  15 \text{ roses/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 180 \text{ roses}
  \]
  
- **Third shop:**
  \[
  30 \text{ roses/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ roses}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Roses Supplied by All Shops in a Month
\[
240 \text{ roses} + 180 \text{ roses} + 360 \text{ roses} = 780 \text{ roses}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Roses Ford Grows in a Month
\[
40 \text{ roses/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 480 \text{ roses}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the Difference
\[
480 \text{ roses} - 780 \text{ roses} = -300 \text{ roses}
\]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Ford **lacks** roses to satisfy the orders of all the flower shops.

\[
\boxed{-300}
\]

Ford needs **300 roses** more to supply all the flower shops in a month.
