Question:
Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.  He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he walks his dog for an hour each day.  How much free time does Harold have left in his day?

Correct Answer:
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he sleeps for 10 hours so he works 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 hours
He sleeps for 10 hours, works for 8 hours and walks his dog for 1 hour for a total of 10+8+1 = <<10+8+1=19>>19 hours
There are 24 hours in a day and his busy for 19 hours so that leaves 24-19 = <<24-19=5>>5 hours left of free time

Wrong Answer:
First, I'll determine Harold's total sleep time, which is given as 10 hours.

Next, since Harold works 2 hours less than he sleeps, I'll subtract 2 from his sleep time:
10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours of work.

Then, I'll add the time Harold spends walking his dog, which is an additional hour:
8 hours (work) + 1 hour (walking dog) = 9 hours spent on activities.

Finally, to find the free time Harold has left in his day, I'll subtract the total time spent on activities from the total sleep time:
10 hours (sleep) - 9 hours (activities) = 1 hour of free time.

Let's determine how much free time Harold has left in his day by following these steps:

1. **Total Sleep Time:**
   \[
   \text{Sleep Time} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Work Time:**
   Harold works 2 hours less than he sleeps.
   \[
   \text{Work Time} = \text{Sleep Time} - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Walking the Dog:**
   Harold walks his dog for an additional hour each day.
   \[
   \text{Walking Time} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Total Time Spent on Activities:**
   \[
   \text{Total Activities Time} = \text{Work Time} + \text{Walking Time} = 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Free Time Left in the Day:**
   \[
   \text{Free Time} = \text{Sleep Time} - \text{Total Activities Time} = 10 - 9 = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

\[
\boxed{1 \text{ hour}}
\]
