Question:
A basic manicure starts at $35 while a pedicure starts at $40. A certain salon offers 20% off if you get both. Suppose Karen chooses to do both and would also like to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. How much would she pay in all?

Correct Answer:
The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.
The discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.
So, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.
The cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.
Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.

Wrong Answer:
First, calculate the total cost of the manicure and pedicure before any discounts. The manicure costs $35, and the pedicure costs $40. Adding these together gives a subtotal of $75.

Next, apply the 20% discount for getting both services together. To find the discount, multiply the subtotal by 20% (or 0.20), resulting in $15 discount.

Subtract the discount from the subtotal to get the discounted total, which is $60.

Then, determine the number of nails Karen wants to add. Since she has two fingers, she needs two nails, and each nail costs $3. Multiplying the number of nails by the cost per nail gives a total of $6 for nail art.

Finally, add the cost of nail art to the discounted total to find the final amount Karen will pay. Adding $6 to $60 results in a total payment of $66.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how much Karen will pay in total.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost of Both Services Before Discount
- **Manicure:** \$35
- **Pedicure:** \$40

\[
\text{Total before discount} = \$35 + \$40 = \$75
\]

### Step 2: Apply the 20% Discount
\[
\text{Discount} = 20\% \times \$75 = 0.20 \times \$75 = \$15
\]

\[
\text{Total after discount} = \$75 - \$15 = \$60
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Cost of Nail Art
- **Nails per finger:** 1 nail
- **Cost per nail:** \$3
- **Fingers:** 2

\[
\text{Total nail art cost} = 2 \times \$3 = \$6
\]

### Step 4: Determine the Total Amount Paid
\[
\text{Total payment} = \text{Total after discount} + \text{Total nail art cost} = \$60 + \$6 = \$66
\]

\[
\boxed{\$66}
\]
