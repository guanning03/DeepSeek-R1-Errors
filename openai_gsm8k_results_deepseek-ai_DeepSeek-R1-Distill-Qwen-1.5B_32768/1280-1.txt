Question:
Hannah's city is having a big display of fireworks for the 4th of July. They're going to set off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. How many fireworks will Hannah see in total?

Correct Answer:
First find the total number of fireworks the city sets off: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks
Then multiply that number by the proportion of the fireworks Hannah can see: 300 fireworks * 40% = <<300*40*.01=120>>120 fireworks
Then find the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her own backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks
Then add the number of city fireworks to the number of personal fireworks to find the total number of fireworks: 15 fireworks + 120 fireworks = <<15+120=135>>135 fireworks
#### 135

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to calculate the total number of fireworks in the city display. There are 15 boxes, each containing 20 fireworks. Multiplying these together gives 15 × 20 = 300 fireworks.

Next, I'll determine how many fireworks Hannah sees in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes, each containing 5 fireworks. This results in 3 × 5 = 15 fireworks.

Finally, I'll add the fireworks from both the city display and Hannah's backyard to find the total number of fireworks she will see. 300 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 315 fireworks.

To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Fireworks in the City Display:**
   - **Number of Boxes:** 15
   - **Fireworks per Box:** 20
   - **Total Fireworks:** \( 15 \times 20 = 300 \) fireworks

2. **Fireworks Hannah Sees in Her Backyard:**
   - **Number of Boxes:** 3
   - **Fireworks per Box:** 5
   - **Total Fireworks:** \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) fireworks

3. **Total Fireworks Hannah Will See:**
   - **City Display Fireworks:** 300
   - **Backyard Fireworks:** 15
   - **Total:** \( 300 + 15 = 315 \) fireworks

\(\boxed{315}\)
