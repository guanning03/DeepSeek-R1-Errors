Question:
George, a grade six teacher, ordered 600 burritos for the sixth-grade class picnic. If there were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given ten burritos, with Mr. George eating 20 of them, calculate the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic?

Correct Answer:
The total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50*10 = <<50*10=500>>500
If Mr George also ate 20, the total number of burritos eaten at the picnic is 500+20 = <<500+20=520>>520
There were 600-520 = <<600-520=80>>80 leftover burritos.
#### 80

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total number of burritos ordered by George, which is 600.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. There are 50 students, and each received 10 burritos. So, 50 multiplied by 10 equals 500 burritos were distributed to the students.

Then, I'll account for the burritos that Mr. George ate. He consumed 20 burritos.

Finally, to find the number of leftover burritos, I'll subtract the total burritos given to students and the ones eaten by Mr. George from the initial order. That is, 600 minus 500 minus 20, which equals 60 burritos left over.

To determine the total number of leftover burritos, follow these steps:

1. **Total Burritos Ordered:**
   \[
   600 \text{ burritos}
   \]

2. **Burritos Given to Students:**
   \[
   50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos}
   \]

3. **Burritos Eaten by Mr. George:**
   \[
   20 \text{ burritos}
   \]

4. **Calculate Leftover Burritos:**
   \[
   600 \text{ (total)} - 500 \text{ (given to students)} - 20 \text{ (eaten by Mr. George)} = \boxed{60} \text{ leftover burritos}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
