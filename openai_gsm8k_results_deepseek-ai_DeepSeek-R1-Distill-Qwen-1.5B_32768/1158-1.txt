Question:
Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?

Correct Answer:
If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.
#### 20

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total amount of mixed chicken feed Wendi uses per day for her flock of 20 chickens.

Each chicken requires three cups of feed per meal. Since there are three meals a day—morning, afternoon, and final—each chicken consumes 3 cups × 3 meals = 9 cups of feed per day.

With a flock of 20 chickens, the total feed needed per day is 20 chickens × 9 cups per chicken = 180 cups.

Next, I'll calculate the total feed Wendi has already provided. In the morning, she gave 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gave 25 cups. Adding these together, 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups have been used so far.

Finally, to find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, I'll subtract the amount already used from the total required. That is, 180 cups - 40 cups = 140 cups.
</think>

To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total feed required per day for 20 chickens:**
   
   - **Feeding per chicken per meal:** 3 cups
   - **Number of meals per day:** 3 (morning, afternoon, final)
   
   \[
   \text{Total feed per day} = 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 180 \text{ cups/day}
   \]

2. **Determine the total feed already given:**
   
   - **Morning:** 15 cups
   - **Afternoon:** 25 cups
   
   \[
   \text{Total feed given so far} = 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Calculate the feed needed for the final meal:**
   
   \[
   \text{Feed needed for final meal} = \text{Total feed per day} - \text{Total feed given so far} = 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{140}
\]
