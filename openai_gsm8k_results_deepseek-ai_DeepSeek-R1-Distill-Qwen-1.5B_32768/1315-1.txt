Question:
Gloria is shoe shopping when she comes across a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that together cost five dollars less than the boots. If one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, how many dollars are the boots?

Correct Answer:
The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.
The heels together cost 66 + 33 = $<<66+33=99>>99.
The boots cost $5 more than both pairs of heels together, so the boots cost 99 + 5 = $104.

104

Wrong Prediction:
198

Wrong Answer:
First, I need to determine the total cost of the two high heels. One pair costs $33, and the other costs twice that amount, so $33 multiplied by 2 equals $66. 

Next, I'll add the cost of the two pairs of high heels together, which is $33 plus $66, totaling $99.

Gloria has a shoe budget, and the boots are the only option besides the high heels. The boots cost $99 less than the total cost of the high heels. 

Finally, I'll subtract the $99 from the total cost of the high heels to find out how much the boots cost: $99 minus $99 equals $0.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because boots shouldn't cost nothing. I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Let me try again. The two pairs of high heels cost $99 in total. If the boots are $99 less than that, then the boots should cost $99 minus $99, which is $0. This can't be correct.

I think I misinterpreted the problem. The boots are the only other option, and the total cost of the boots and the high heels is $99. So, if the boots are $99 less than $99, that would mean the boots cost $0. This still doesn't make sense.

Perhaps I should consider that the boots cost $99 less than the total cost of the high heels, which is $99. So, the boots would cost $99 minus $99, which is $0. This doesn't make sense either. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says the boots and the two pairs of high heels together cost $99 less than the boots. That doesn't make sense because you can't have something less than nothing.

I think I need to approach this differently. Let me define the cost of the boots as B. The two pairs of high heels cost $33 and $66, totaling $99. The total cost of the boots and high heels is B plus $99. According to the problem, B plus $99 is $99 less than the boots. This still doesn't make sense.

I must have misunderstood the problem. Let me try to rephrase it. The total cost of the boots and the high heels is $99. The boots are $99 less than the total cost of the high heels. If the high heels cost $99, then the boots would be $99 minus $99, which is $0. This doesn't make sense.

I think I need to look for another way to interpret the problem. Maybe the total cost of the boots and the high heels is $99 less than the cost of the boots. That would mean B + $99 = B - $99, which again doesn't make sense.

I'm confused. Perhaps there's a translation issue in the problem statement. Let me read it again carefully.

"Gloria is shoe shopping when she comes across a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that together cost five dollars less than the boots. If one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, how many dollars are the boots?"

Wait, maybe the total cost of the high heels is $99 less than the cost of the boots. So, if the high heels cost $99 less than the boots, and the high heels cost $99, then B = $99 + $99 = $198.

But the problem states that the high heels together cost $99 less than the boots. So, if the high heels cost $99, then the boots cost $99 + $99 = $198.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the high heels together cost $99, which is $99 less than the boots. Therefore, the boots would cost $198.

I think that's the correct interpretation. So, the boots cost $198.
</think>

The boots cost $198.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Determine the cost of the high heels:**
   - One pair costs $33.
   - The other pair costs twice as much: 2 Ã— $33 = $66.
   - Total cost for high heels = $33 + $66 = $99.

2. **Understand the relationship between the boots and the high heels:**
   - The boots cost $99 less than the high heels.
   - Therefore, the cost of the boots = Total cost of high heels - $99.
   - Cost of boots = $99 - $99 = $0.

Wait, this result doesn't make sense because a pair of boots can't cost $0. It indicates a mistake in interpretation.

**Correct Interpretation:**

The problem likely states that the combined cost of the two pairs of high heels is $99 less than the cost of the boots. Therefore:

1. **Total cost of high heels = $99.**
2. **Cost of boots = Total cost of high heels + $99 = $99 + $99 = $198.**

**Final Answer:**
The boots cost $\boxed{\$198}$.
