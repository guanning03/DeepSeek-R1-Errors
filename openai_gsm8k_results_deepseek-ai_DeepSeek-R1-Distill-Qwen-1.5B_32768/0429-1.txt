Question:
James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.  He gets 1 hour free.  The first paid hour is $15 and each hour after that is twice the cost.  How much did he pay?

Correct Answer:
He got it for 9-5=<<9-5=4>>4 hours
He pays for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours
The first hour cost 1*15=$<<1*15=15>>15
The other 3-1=2 hours are more expensive
They cost 15*2=$<<15*2=30>>30 per hour
So those 2 hours cost 2*30=$<<2*30=60>>60
So he pays 60+15=$<<60+15=75>>75 per hours
#### 75

Wrong Answer:
To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, I start by noting the total time he spent and the duration of the free hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. He received 1 hour of free time. This means he was charged for 3 paid hours.

The cost structure is as follows: the first paid hour costs $15, and each subsequent hour doubles the cost of the previous one. Therefore, the second paid hour costs $30, and the third paid hour costs $60.

Adding these amounts together: $15 + $30 + $60 equals a total payment of $105.
