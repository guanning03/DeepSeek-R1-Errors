Question:
The twelve letters $A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K$, and $L$ are randomly grouped into six pairs of letters. The two letters in each pair are placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form six two-letter words, and those six words are listed alphabetically. For example, a possible result is $AB,CJ,DG,EK,FL,HI$. The probability that the last word listed contains $G$ is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where there are twelve letters from A to L, and they're randomly grouped into six pairs. Each pair is then turned into a two-letter word, sorted alphabetically, and all six words are listed alphabetically. I need to find the probability that the last word contains the letter G. The answer should be in the form of a reduced fraction m/n, and then I have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the total number of ways to pair up twelve letters into six pairs is a standard combinatorial problem. The number of ways to do this is given by the formula (12)! divided by (2!^6 * 6!). That's because for each pair, we're considering the order within the pair doesn't matter, and the order of the pairs themselves doesn't matter either.

So, total number of possible groupings is (12)! / (2!^6 * 6!). Let me compute that just to have a number in mind. 12! is 479001600. 2!^6 is 64, and 6! is 720. So, 479001600 / (64 * 720) = 479001600 / 46080 = 10395. So, there are 10395 total possible ways to pair up the letters.

Now, we need to find how many of these pairings result in the last word containing G. Let's think about what that means. The six two-letter words are sorted alphabetically. So, the last word is the one that comes last in the alphabetical order. For that word to contain G, it must be the case that the last word is either "G..." or "...G", but since it's the last word, it must be the highest possible word. So, the last word must be something like "G..." but given that all words are two letters, it has to be the highest possible two-letter word in the entire set.

Wait, hold on. If we have all six words sorted alphabetically, the last word is the highest one. So, for the last word to contain G, it must be the highest possible two-letter word in the entire pairing. Since G is the 7th letter in the alphabet, the highest word containing G would be "GL", right? Because L is the last letter. So, if "GL" is one of the words, and it's the highest, then it will be the last word. Alternatively, if we have a word like "GG", but since all letters are unique, we can't have two Gs. So, the best possible word with G is "GL".

So, in order for the last word to contain G, "GL" needs to be one of the six pairs, and it needs to be the highest pair, so all other words must come before "GL" alphabetically. Therefore, we need to count the number of pairings where "GL" is a pair, and in the remaining letters, the other five pairs form words that are all alphabetically before "GL".

Wait, but hold on, if "GL" is a pair, then the remaining letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K. So, ten letters left, which will form five pairs. Each of these pairs, when sorted, must form a word that is alphabetically before "GL". That is, each pair must be a word that comes before "GL" in the alphabetical order.

So, let's think about what words come before "GL". Any two-letter word that starts with a letter before G will definitely come before "GL". Also, words that start with G but have a second letter before L (i.e., "GC", "GD", ..., "GK") also come before "GL". So, in the remaining letters, we have A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K. So, letters from A to F, H to K.

So, the remaining letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K. So, ten letters. So, we need to pair these ten letters into five pairs such that when each pair is sorted, they form a word that is alphabetically before "GL".

Wait, but "GL" is fixed as a pair, so we can ignore the rest. So, the problem reduces to: Given the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, how many ways can we pair them into five pairs, such that each pair, when sorted, is alphabetically before "GL".

So, what is the condition for a pair to be alphabetically before "GL"? Let's see. If a pair starts with a letter before G, then regardless of the second letter, the pair will be before "GL". For example, "AB" is before "GL", "AC" is before "GL", etc. If a pair starts with G, then the second letter must be before L, so G followed by any letter from A to K. But in our remaining letters, we don't have G anymore because it's already paired with L. So, in our remaining letters, we don't have G anymore, so all the pairs starting with G are not possible. Therefore, all the pairs must start with letters A-F or H, and since H is after G, any pair starting with H or K will be after "GL". So, we have to ensure that all pairs either start with A-F or start with a letter before G, and for those starting with G, but in our case, since we don't have G, we don't have that. Wait, no.

Wait, actually, in the remaining letters, we have A-F and H-K. So, in order for a pair to be before "GL", it must either start with a letter before G, which is A-F, or if it starts with H or K, which are after G, then the pair cannot be before "GL". So, in order for all the other five pairs to be before "GL", we must ensure that none of the pairs start with H or K, because those would be after G, hence making the pair after "GL", which would prevent "GL" from being the last word. So, in order for "GL" to be the last word, all other pairs must start with letters A-F, and each of these pairs must also be such that their second letter is before L, but since L is already paired with G, the second letters can be anything.

Wait, but in our remaining letters, we have A-F and H-K, so if we have a pair starting with H or K, that pair would be "HH", "HK", etc., but since all letters are unique, we can't have "HH". So, the pairs starting with H or K will be of the form HX or KX, where X is another letter. But since H and K are both after G, any pair starting with H or K will come after "GL". Therefore, to have "GL" as the last word, we must not have any pairs starting with H or K.

Therefore, in the remaining letters A-F and H-K, we must pair them such that none of the pairs start with H or K. So, effectively, all pairs must start with A-F, and the second letters can be anything except H or K, but wait, H and K are still present.

Wait, no. If we have letters A-F and H-K, but we can't have any pairs starting with H or K. So, H and K must be paired with something else. But since they can't be paired with themselves, they must be paired with letters from A-F. But if we pair H and K with letters from A-F, then the pair will be something like AH, BK, etc., which is fine, but we have to make sure that these pairs, when sorted, are alphabetically before "GL".

Wait, but when you sort a pair, it's in alphabetical order, so for example, if you have the pair H and A, it becomes AH, which is before GL. Similarly, BK becomes BK, which is before GL. So, actually, as long as the pair starts with a letter before G, the pair is before GL. So, if we have H paired with A-F, that pair becomes AH, BH, CH, DH, EH, or FH, all of which are before GL.

Similarly, K paired with A-F becomes AK, BK, CK, DK, EK, FK, all of which are before GL. So, in fact, if we pair H and K with letters from A-F, the pairs will still be before GL. So, perhaps my earlier thought was incorrect.

Wait, so perhaps I was mistaken in thinking that we can't have pairs starting with H or K. Because when you sort the pair, the first letter is the smaller one, so even if you have H paired with something, it becomes the second letter in the sorted pair.

Wait, let's test this with an example. Suppose we have the pair H and A. When sorted, it becomes AH, which is definitely before GL. Similarly, if you have K and B, it becomes BK, which is also before GL. So, in fact, as long as the first letter in the sorted pair is before G, the entire pair is before GL. So, if we have a pair starting with a letter before G, regardless of what the second letter is, the pair is before GL. If the pair starts with G, it's after GL, but since we don't have G anymore, that case is already taken care of.

Wait, but in our remaining letters, we don't have G, so all pairs will start with letters A-F or H-K. So, any pair starting with H or K will have their first letter as H or K, but when you sort the pair, the first letter is the smaller one. So, if the pair is H and something, the sorted pair will have the something as the first letter if it's smaller than H, otherwise H as the first letter.

Wait, no. When you sort two letters, the smaller one comes first. So, if you have a pair of H and A, the sorted pair is AH. If you have a pair of H and B, it's BH. Similarly, pair H and C, it's CH, and so on.

Wait, so if you have a pair of H and a letter from A-F, the sorted pair will have the A-F letter first, then H. So, for example, H and A becomes AH, H and B becomes BH, etc. So, in that case, AH, BH, CH, DH, EH, FH are all the pairs where H is paired with A-F.

Similarly, if you have K paired with A-F, it becomes AK, BK, CK, DK, EK, FK.

So, in that case, the pair starting with H or K, when sorted, will still have the first letter as A-F or H or K, but the second letter is the other one.

Wait, but in terms of alphabetical order, AH comes before BK, which comes before CL, etc. So, if H is paired with A, it's AH, which is before BK, which is before CH, etc.

Wait, so in reality, the sorted pair will have the first letter as the smaller one, so if H is paired with A-F, the pair will be in the range AH to FH, which are all before GL.

Similarly, if K is paired with A-F, the pairs will be AK, BK, CK, DK, EK, FK, all of which are before GL.

Therefore, in order for all the other five pairs to be before GL, we don't necessarily have to prevent H and K from being paired; instead, we just have to make sure that when they are paired with A-F, the resulting pair is still before GL.

But wait, AH, BH, CH, DH, EH, FH, AK, BK, CK, DK, EK, FK are all before GL.

But wait, what about pairs that start with G? But in our initial pairing, G is already paired with L, so in the remaining letters, we don't have G anymore.

So, actually, all the pairs formed by H and K with A-F will still be before GL when sorted.

Therefore, perhaps my initial thought was wrong, and we can have all possible pairings where "GL" is a pair, and the other pairs are formed from the remaining letters, regardless of whether H or K are paired with A-F.

Wait, but hold on, that can't be the case because if H or K are paired together, then the pair would be HK, which when sorted is HK, which is after GL, because H comes after G.

Wait, that's a key point. So, if H and K are paired together, then the pair becomes HK, which is after GL. Therefore, in order for the last word to be GL, all other pairs must be before GL, so we cannot have a pair that is after GL. Therefore, if H and K are paired together, that pair HK would come after GL, which would make the last word HK instead of GL. Therefore, in order for GL to be the last word, HK cannot be a pair.

Similarly, any pair that starts with H or K when sorted would come after GL. So, for example, if H is paired with a letter from A-F, the sorted pair is AH, BH, etc., which are before GL. If K is paired with a letter from A-F, it's AK, BK, etc., which are before GL. However, if H is paired with K, the sorted pair is HK, which is after GL. Therefore, in order to have GL as the last word, we must ensure that H and K are not paired together, and also, that they are not paired with each other.

Wait, more precisely, to prevent any pair from coming after GL, we must ensure that all pairs either start with a letter before G or are pairs that when sorted are before GL. But as we saw, if H is paired with A-F, it becomes AH, which is before GL. Similarly, if K is paired with A-F, it becomes AK, which is also before GL.

But if H is paired with K, it becomes HK, which is after GL, so we must avoid that.

Wait, but if H is paired with A-F, it becomes AH, which is before GL, so that's okay. Similarly, K paired with A-F becomes AK, which is before GL.

Therefore, as long as H and K are not paired together, the pairs involving H and K will be before GL when sorted. So, actually, to have GL as the last word, the only constraint is that H and K are not paired together, and that all other pairs are formed from the remaining letters.

Wait, no. Because suppose we have a pair like AH, which is before GL, and another pair like BK, which is also before GL, and so on. So, as long as H and K are not paired together, all other pairs are fine.

Therefore, in order for the last word to be GL, the necessary conditions are:

1. G is paired with L, so "GL" is one of the pairs.

2. H and K are not paired together, so they must be paired with other letters.

But actually, wait, no. Because even if H is paired with K, the pair becomes HK, which is after GL, so in that case, the last word would be HK instead of GL.

Therefore, in order for GL to be the last word, we must avoid having H and K paired together, and all other pairs must be before GL.

But since when H is paired with A-F or K is paired with A-F, the sorted pair is AH, BH, etc., which are before GL, so the only problem is if H and K are paired together, resulting in HK.

Therefore, to have GL as the last word, "GL" must be a pair, and H and K must not be paired together.

Therefore, the number of such pairings is equal to the number of pairings where "GL" is a pair, and H and K are not paired together.

Therefore, the total number of favorable pairings is equal to (number of pairings where "GL" is a pair) minus (number of pairings where "GL" is a pair AND H and K are paired together).

So, let's compute that.

First, total number of pairings where "GL" is a pair: we fix G and L as a pair, so we have the remaining 10 letters. These 10 letters can be paired in (10)! / (2!^5 * 5!) ways, which is 945.

But wait, no. Wait, 10 letters can be paired in (10)! / (2^5 * 5!) ways. Let's compute that.

10! is 3628800. 2^5 is 32. 5! is 120. So, 3628800 / (32 * 120) = 3628800 / 3840 = 945. So, yes, 945 pairings.

But among these 945 pairings, some pairings have H and K together, and some don't. So, the number of pairings where "GL" is a pair and H and K are paired together is equal to the number of pairings where "GL", "HK" are both pairs, and the remaining 8 letters are paired arbitrarily.

So, if we fix "GL" and "HK" as pairs, then we have the remaining letters A, B, C, D, E, F, J, I. Wait, no, wait, original letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L. If we fix "GL" and "HK", then we have the remaining letters A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J. So, 8 letters left, which can be paired in (8)! / (2^4 * 4!) = 105 ways.

So, the number of pairings where "GL" and "HK" are both pairs is 105.

Therefore, the number of pairings where "GL" is a pair and H and K are not paired together is 945 - 105 = 840.

Therefore, the number of favorable pairings is 840.

Hence, the probability is 840 / 10395.

Wait, let's simplify that fraction. 840 / 10395.

Divide numerator and denominator by 105: 840 ÷ 105 = 8, 10395 ÷ 105 = 99.

So, 8/99. Are 8 and 99 coprime? 8 is 2^3, 99 is 9*11, so yes, they are coprime.

Therefore, the probability is 8/99, so m + n = 8 + 99 = 107.

Wait, hold on, is that correct? Let me double-check.

So, total number of pairings is 10395.

Number of pairings where "GL" is a pair is 945.

Number of pairings where "GL" and "HK" are both pairs is 105.

Therefore, number of pairings where "GL" is a pair and H and K are not paired together is 945 - 105 = 840.

Therefore, favorable pairings: 840.

Probability: 840 / 10395.

Simplify: Divide numerator and denominator by 105: 840 ÷ 105 = 8, 10395 ÷ 105 = 99. So, 8/99.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me think again: is the only constraint that H and K are not paired together, or are there other constraints?

Because when we fix "GL" as a pair, and pair the remaining letters, we have to make sure that all other pairs, when sorted, are before "GL".

But as we saw earlier, when H or K are paired with A-F, the resulting pairs are AH, BH, etc., which are before GL. However, if H is paired with K, it becomes HK, which is after GL. So, the only forbidden pairing is HK.

Therefore, the only forbidden case among the 945 is when HK is a pair. So, the number of forbidden pairings is equal to the number of pairings where "GL" is a pair and HK is a pair, which is 105, as computed earlier.

Therefore, the favorable pairings are 945 - 105 = 840.

Hence, the probability is 840 / 10395, which simplifies to 8/99.

Therefore, m is 8, n is 99, m + n is 107.

Wait, hold on, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the initial step, when I fixed "GL" as a pair, the remaining letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K. So, 10 letters.

But when I consider the number of pairings where H and K are paired together, I considered H and K as a pair, so the remaining 8 letters can be paired in 105 ways. So, that seems correct.

But wait, another way to think about it is that, given that "GL" is a pair, the probability that H and K are paired together is equal to the number of ways to pair H and K together divided by the total number of pairings of the remaining letters.

So, the number of pairings where H and K are paired together is 105, as we saw. So, the probability that H and K are paired together is 105 / 945 = 1/9.

Therefore, the probability that H and K are not paired together is 1 - 1/9 = 8/9.

Therefore, the probability that "GL" is a pair and H and K are not paired together is (1/10395) * (8/9)?

Wait, no, wait, the total probability is the probability that "GL" is a pair multiplied by the probability that, given "GL" is a pair, H and K are not paired together.

The probability that "GL" is a pair is (number of pairings with "GL") / total pairings, which is 945 / 10395 = 1/11.

Wait, 945 / 10395: 10395 ÷ 945 is 11. So, yes, 945 / 10395 is 1/11.

Then, the probability that, given "GL" is a pair, H and K are not paired together is 8/9, as computed.

Therefore, the overall probability is 1/11 * 8/9 = 8/99, which is the same as before.

Therefore, that seems consistent.

Therefore, I think 8/99 is the correct probability, so the answer is 8 + 99 = 107.

But wait, hold on, let me think again. Another way to compute is:

Total number of possible pairings: 10395.

Number of favorable pairings: ?

Alternatively, instead of fixing "GL" as a pair, maybe think about the position of "GL" in the sorted list of all possible two-letter words.

Wait, but that might complicate things because the last word depends on all pairings.

Alternatively, maybe compute the probability that "GL" is the last word by considering that all the other words must come before "GL".

But in our previous reasoning, we saw that the last word is the highest word, which must be "GL", so all other words must be before "GL".

So, for "GL" to be the last word, it has to be a pair, and all other pairs must be such that when sorted, they are before "GL".

So, in the remaining letters, as we saw, H and K cannot be paired together because that would make a pair after "GL". So, the number of favorable pairings is equal to the number of pairings where "GL" is a pair, and H and K are not paired together.

Which is 840, as above.

Therefore, 840 / 10395 reduces to 8/99.

So, 8 + 99 is 107.

Therefore, I think the answer is 107.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{107}
</think>

The twelve letters \(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K,\) and \(L\) are randomly grouped into six pairs. Each pair is turned into a two-letter word, which is then sorted alphabetically. We need to find the probability that the last word listed contains \(G\).

First, we determine the total number of ways to pair up the twelve letters, which is given by:
\[
\frac{12!}{2^6 \cdot 6!} = 10395
\]

Next, we consider the condition that the last word must be "GL". For "GL" to be the last word, it must be a pair, and all other pairs must be alphabetically before "GL". This means that none of the other pairs can start with \(H\) or \(K\) because those would result in words after "GL".

We need to count the number of pairings where "GL" is a pair and \(H\) and \(K\) are not paired together. Fixing "GL" as a pair, we have 10 remaining letters: \(A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K\). The number of ways to pair these 10 letters is:
\[
\frac{10!}{2^5 \cdot 5!} = 945
\]

However, we must exclude the cases where \(H\) and \(K\) are paired together. If \(H\) and \(K\) are paired together, the remaining 8 letters can be paired in:
\[
\frac{8!}{2^4 \cdot 4!} = 105
\]

Thus, the number of favorable pairings is:
\[
945 - 105 = 840
\]

The probability is then:
\[
\frac{840}{10395} = \frac{8}{99}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{8}{99}\) is in its simplest form, so \(m = 8\) and \(n = 99\). Therefore, \(m + n = 8 + 99 = 107\).

\[
\boxed{107}
\]
