Question:
The twelve letters $A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K$, and $L$ are randomly grouped into six pairs of letters. The two letters in each pair are placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form six two-letter words, and those six words are listed alphabetically. For example, a possible result is $AB,CJ,DG,EK,FL,HI$. The probability that the last word listed contains $G$ is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the last word in this list contains the letter 'G'. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem clearly. We have twelve letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L. These are to be randomly grouped into six pairs. Each pair is then placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form two-letter words. After forming all six words, they are listed alphabetically. We need to find the probability that the last word in this list contains the letter 'G'.

Alright, so the key here is that after all the pairs are formed and the words are sorted alphabetically, what's the chance that the last word (which would be the word that comes last in the alphabetical order) includes 'G'.

Let me think about the structure of the problem. Since all the words are two letters and we sort them alphabetically, the last word would be the one that is lexicographically largest. So, for example, if the words are AB, CJ, DG, EK, FL, HI, then HI is the last word.

So, we need to find the probability that the largest word in this sorted list contains 'G'. That is, when all the words are arranged from A to Z, the last one, which is the one that starts with the highest possible letter, or maybe if there are multiple words starting with the same letter, the one with the highest second letter, contains 'G'.

But wait, the last word is the lex greatest one, so it's the word that is the last in the alphabetical order. So, it's the word that either is the one with the highest first letter, or if there's a tie, the highest second letter.

So, for the last word to contain 'G', either 'G' is the first letter of the last word or the second letter of the last word, but since the last word is the largest, it must be that the first letter is as large as possible, or if the first letters are equal, the second letter is as large as possible.

Wait, but in the example given, they have HI as the last word. So, H is the highest first letter, so the last word is HI.

But wait, if another word could have a higher first letter, that would be the last word. So, if in the grouping, we had something like KI or something, that would come after HI, right?

Wait, but hold on, the letters are grouped into pairs. So, for example, if we have pairs like KI, that's a word, and if that's the highest, then it would be the last one.

So, to have the last word contain 'G', we need that in the pairs, there's a word where 'G' is either the first or the second letter, and that word is the last in the alphabetical order.

But let me think more carefully.

First, the entire process is about forming six pairs, pairing up all twelve letters. Then, each pair is sorted alphabetically, so each word is in order, like AB, CD, etc. Then, all six words are sorted alphabetically, and the last one is the one we care about.

So, the last word is the one that is lex greatest among the six words.

We need to find the probability that this last word contains 'G' as one of its letters.

So, the last word must have 'G' either as the first or the second letter.

Wait, but more accurately, the last word must contain 'G' in one of its positions, i.e., either as the first or second letter.

So, the last word could be something like GH, GI, GJ, GK, GL, HG, IG, JG, KG, LG, etc. But wait, no, because in each pair, the letters are sorted alphabetically, so each word is in order. So, if a word contains 'G', it would have the smaller letter first and the larger one second, right?

Wait, no, since each pair is sorted alphabetically. So, if a pair is, say, HG, it would be written as GH.

So, actually, in the list of words, the word containing 'G' would have its letters in alphabetical order, so if 'G' is paired with a higher letter, it would be G followed by that letter, and if 'G' is paired with a lower letter, it would be that letter followed by G.

So, for example, if G is paired with A, then the word would be AG; if G is paired with H, the word would be GH; if G is paired with L, it would be GL.

Therefore, the word containing 'G' could be either AG, BG, CG, DG, EG, FG, GH, GG (but GG isn't possible since all letters are distinct), etc.

Wait, but in the pairing, all letters are distinct, so each letter is paired with exactly one other letter. So, only one word will contain 'G', and in that word, 'G' will be either the first or the second letter, depending on whether it's paired with a letter before or after it in the alphabet.

So, in order for the last word to contain 'G', 'G' must be in that word, and that word must be the last word in the sorted list.

So, to have the last word contain 'G', 'G' must be part of the last word, which is the lex greatest word.

So, in other words, the maximum word in the list must be a word that contains 'G'.

So, the maximum word will be the word with the highest first letter, or if there are multiple words with the same highest first letter, the one with the highest second letter.

Therefore, for the maximum word to contain 'G', either:

1. The first letter of the maximum word is 'G', or

2. The maximum word is something like 'GH', where 'G' is the second letter, but since the first letter is the highest possible, which is higher than 'G', it can't be that 'G' is the second letter and the first letter is higher.

Wait, hold on, that's an important point.

If the maximum word is something like 'GH', then since 'G' is the first letter, it's already a word that starts with 'G'. So, if the maximum word starts with a letter higher than 'G', say 'H' or 'I', then the word containing 'G' would be either AG, BG, etc., which would come before the maximum word.

Therefore, in order for the maximum word to contain 'G', the maximum word must start with 'G'. Because if it starts with a higher letter, like 'H' or 'I', then the word with 'G' as the first letter would come before it in the list, making that word not the maximum.

Therefore, the maximum word must start with 'G', which would make the maximum word either 'GH', 'GI', 'GJ', 'GK', or 'GL'.

Alternatively, is there a scenario where a word starting with 'G' is not the maximum word? Only if there's a word starting with a letter higher than 'G' that is higher than 'GH', 'GI', etc.

But wait, for example, suppose we have a word like 'HI', which starts with 'H', which is higher than 'G', so 'HI' would come after any word starting with 'G'.

Therefore, unless all words starting with 'G' are somehow higher than any word starting with higher letters, which isn't possible because 'G' is the 7th letter, and higher letters are after that.

Wait, unless the word starting with a higher letter has a second letter that is higher than 'G'. For example, if a word is 'GZ' (but we don't have 'Z'), or 'G' paired with a higher letter. But since 'G' is already the 7th letter, the letters after are H, I, J, K, L. So, 'GH' is the highest possible word starting with 'G', right? Because 'G' is followed by 'H', but if 'G' is paired with a higher letter, like 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', or 'L', then that would make the word 'GH', 'GI', 'GJ', 'GK', or 'GL', respectively.

But wait, if 'G' is paired with 'H', the word is 'GH'; if paired with 'I', it's 'GI', etc. Now, these words are all higher in alphabetical order than any word starting with a letter after 'G', i.e., 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', or 'L', paired with any letter.

Wait, but that can't be. Because if you have a word starting with 'H', say 'HI', which is higher than 'GH', because 'H' comes after 'G'. So, regardless of how you pair letters, the word starting with 'H' will always come before the word starting with 'G' in the alphabetical list. So, for example, 'HI' comes after 'GH', right?

Wait, hold on, alphabetical order compares the first letters first. So, if two words start with different letters, the one with the earlier letter comes first. So, 'GH' starts with 'G', 'HI' starts with 'H'; since 'G' comes before 'H', 'GH' comes before 'HI'. So, in the list of words, all words starting with 'G' would come before any word starting with 'H' or higher.

Therefore, the maximum word in the list is the maximum among all the words, which is the word with the highest starting letter, or if multiple words have the same highest starting letter, the one with the highest second letter.

Therefore, the maximum word is either:

- The highest letter among all the first letters of the words, or

- If multiple words have the same highest starting letter, the one with the highest second letter.

So, for the maximum word to contain 'G', the highest starting letter among all the words must be 'G'. Because if the highest starting letter is higher than 'G', say 'H', then all the words starting with 'H' would be after the words starting with 'G', so the maximum word would start with 'H', and hence, the maximum word would not contain 'G'.

Therefore, for the maximum word to contain 'G', all the words must have their starting letters less than or equal to 'G', and at least one word must start with 'G'. Therefore, the maximum starting letter is 'G', and among the words starting with 'G', the one with the highest second letter is the maximum word, which would contain 'G'.

So, in order for the last word to contain 'G', 'G' must be the highest starting letter in the list of words.

So, that translates to: in the pairing, all pairs that include 'G' must be such that 'G' is the first letter in its pair, meaning 'G' is paired with a letter that comes after it in the alphabet. Because if 'G' is paired with a letter before it, say 'A', then the pair would be 'AG', which is a word starting with 'A', which is lower than 'G'.

Therefore, to have all pairs either start with a letter less than or equal to 'G', and at least one pair starts with 'G', with the second letter coming after 'G', we need that 'G' is paired with a letter after it, i.e., 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', or 'L'.

Thus, the problem reduces to: what is the probability that in the random pairing, 'G' is paired with a letter after it (i.e., 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', or 'L'), and all other pairs have their first letter less than or equal to 'G'. Wait, no, actually, the only condition is that 'G' is paired with a letter after it, because if 'G' is paired with a letter before it, then the word will start with that earlier letter, making the maximum word start with that earlier letter, which is less than 'G', so 'G' won't be in the maximum word.

Therefore, in other words, the maximum word will contain 'G' if and only if 'G' is paired with a letter after it, i.e., 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', or 'L'. Because then, the word will be 'GH', 'GI', 'GJ', 'GK', or 'GL', which starts with 'G' and hence will be a candidate for the maximum word.

But wait, we have to ensure that all other pairs do not start with a letter higher than 'G', because if any pair starts with a letter higher than 'G', say 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', or 'L', then the word starting with that letter will be after the word starting with 'G', so the maximum word would be the one starting with that higher letter, and hence, not containing 'G'.

Therefore, in order for the maximum word to contain 'G', two conditions must be met:

1. 'G' is paired with a letter after it (i.e., 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', or 'L').

2. All other letters after 'G' (i.e., 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L') are paired with letters that are less than or equal to 'G'.

Wait, no, hold on. If 'G' is paired with a letter after it, say 'H', then 'H' is already paired with 'G', so it can't be paired with anything else. Therefore, the other letters after 'G' must be paired among themselves or with letters before 'G'.

But if another letter after 'G' is paired with a letter before 'G', then the word formed by that pair will start with the letter before 'G', which is lower than 'G', so it won't affect the maximum word, which is 'GH', 'GI', etc.

But if another letter after 'G' is paired with another letter after 'G', say 'H' with 'I', then the word would be 'HI', which starts with 'H', which is higher than 'G', so in that case, the maximum word would be 'HI', not containing 'G'.

Therefore, in order for 'G' to be the starting letter of the maximum word, all letters after 'G' must be paired with letters that are not higher than 'G'. That is, the letters after 'G' must be paired with letters that are less than or equal to 'G'.

Therefore, the letters after 'G' are 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L' (five letters). We need to pair each of these five letters with a letter that is less than or equal to 'G'.

The letters less than or equal to 'G' are 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G' (seven letters). However, 'G' is already paired with one of the letters after it, so the remaining six letters (A, B, C, D, E, F) can be used to pair with the remaining four letters after 'G' (since one letter after 'G' is already paired with 'G').

Wait, let me think again.

Total letters: 12.

Letters after 'G': H, I, J, K, L (5 letters).

Letters before or equal to 'G': A, B, C, D, E, F, G (7 letters).

We need to form six pairs. Each pair is two letters.

We need that all letters after 'G' are paired with letters that are not higher than 'G'. So, each of H, I, J, K, L must be paired with a letter from A, B, C, D, E, F, or G.

But 'G' is already paired with one of H, I, J, K, L. So, the remaining four letters after 'G' must be paired with letters from A, B, C, D, E, F.

Therefore, the number of ways to pair H, I, J, K, L with letters from A, B, C, D, E, F (each of H, I, J, K, L paired with one of A-F, and G is already paired with one of them).

So, the number of ways to pair H, I, J, K, L with A, B, C, D, E, F is equal to the number of injective functions from the set {H, I, J, K, L} to the set {A, B, C, D, E, F}, which is 6P5 = 6*5*4*3*2 = 720.

Wait, but actually, when pairing, the order doesn't matter. So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of permutations.

Wait, actually, when pairing, it's similar to forming a perfect matching. So, for the letters H, I, J, K, L, we need to pair each with a letter from A, B, C, D, E, F. So, this is equivalent to a bipartite matching between two sets: one set of size 5 (H, I, J, K, L) and one set of size 6 (A, B, C, D, E, F). So, the number of possible pairings is 6P5 = 6! / (6-5)! = 720.

But actually, wait, in the entire pairing, we have 12 letters, so the total number of pairings is (12)! / (2^6 * 6!) = 10395, right? Because the number of ways to partition 12 objects into 6 pairs is 12! divided by (2^6 * 6!).

But in our case, we have constraints on certain pairings.

So, the problem is to compute the number of pairings where:

1. 'G' is paired with one of H, I, J, K, L.

2. The remaining letters H, I, J, K, L are each paired with a letter from A, B, C, D, E, F.

So, first, let me compute the total number of such pairings.

First, choose which letter after 'G' is paired with 'G'. There are 5 choices: H, I, J, K, or L.

Once we've paired 'G' with one of these, say H, then we have to pair the remaining four letters after 'G' (I, J, K, L) with four letters from A, B, C, D, E, F.

Wait, no, we have five letters after 'G' (H, I, J, K, L). We paired one with 'G', so we have four letters left: I, J, K, L. These four letters need to be paired with four letters from A, B, C, D, E, F. The remaining letters in A-F are six letters: A, B, C, D, E, F. So, we need to pair four letters (I, J, K, L) with four letters from A-F.

So, the number of ways to pair four letters is equal to the number of injective functions from four elements to six elements, which is 6P4 = 6*5*4*3 = 360.

But wait, actually, in pairing, it's a bit different because each pairing is a perfect matching.

So, perhaps it's better to think of it as: after pairing 'G' with one of H, I, J, K, L, we have four letters left after 'G' and four letters left before 'G' (since one letter before 'G' was already paired with 'G').

Wait, no. Wait, letters before 'G' are A, B, C, D, E, F, G. When we pair 'G' with one letter after it, say H, then we have A, B, C, D, E, F left to pair with the remaining four letters after 'G': I, J, K, L.

Therefore, the number of ways to pair I, J, K, L with A, B, C, D, E, F is equal to the number of ways to choose four letters from A-F and pair them with I, J, K, L.

So, that's C(6,4) * 4! = 15 * 24 = 360.

Therefore, the number of favorable pairings is 5 * 360 = 1800.

Wait, 5 choices for which letter after 'G' is paired with 'G', and for each such choice, 360 ways to pair the remaining four letters after 'G' with four letters before 'G'. So, total favorable pairings: 5 * 360 = 1800.

Now, the total number of possible pairings is 10395, as we calculated before.

Therefore, the probability that the last word contains 'G' is 1800 / 10395.

But wait, hold on. Is that the only condition? Let me double-check.

We have to make sure that in these favorable pairings, the maximum word is indeed 'GH', 'GI', etc., and that no other word starts with a higher letter. Because if another word starts with a higher letter, then the last word won't contain 'G'.

But in our favorable pairings, we have already ensured that all letters after 'G' are paired with letters before 'G', so all such words will start with letters before 'G'. Therefore, the words starting with 'G' will be the only ones starting with 'G', and since all words starting with letters after 'G' are not present, the maximum word will be the word starting with 'G', which is either 'GH', 'GI', 'GJ', 'GK', or 'GL'.

Therefore, in these favorable pairings, the maximum word will definitely contain 'G'.

Hence, the probability is 1800 / 10395.

Simplify that fraction.

First, let's find the GCD of 1800 and 10395.

Divide both by 5: 1800 ÷5=360, 10395 ÷5=2079.

So, 360 / 2079.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 360 ÷3=120, 2079 ÷3=693.

120 / 693.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3 again: 120 ÷3=40, 693 ÷3=231.

40 / 231.

Check if 40 and 231 have any common factors. 40 is 2^3 *5, 231 is 3*7*11. No common factors, so 40/231 is reduced.

Therefore, the probability is 40/231.

Wait, but 40 and 231: 40 is 8*5, 231 is 3*7*11. So, yes, co-prime.

Therefore, the probability is 40/231.

Wait, but hold on, let me verify that the total number of pairings is indeed 10395.

Yes, 12 letters: (12)! / (2^6 * 6!) = 479001600 / (64 * 720) = 479001600 / 46080 = 10395. So, that's correct.

Number of favorable pairings: 5 * 6P4 = 5 * 360 = 1800. So, 1800/10395 reduces to 40/231.

Therefore, m is 40, n is 231. Since they are coprime, m + n = 271.

Wait, but hold on, let me think again.

Wait, when we paired 'G' with one of H, I, J, K, L, and the remaining four letters after 'G' with four letters before 'G', we assumed that the maximum word is one of the words starting with 'G'. But is that always the case?

Wait, suppose we have another scenario where 'G' is paired with a letter after it, say 'H', so the word is 'GH'. Then, the letters after 'G' are I, J, K, L, which are paired with A, B, C, D, E, F. So, the other words will be something like AI, BJ, CK, DL, etc. So, in this case, the maximum word is 'GH', which is the word starting with 'G'.

But what if in such a pairing, another word starts with 'G' as well? Wait, no, because we have only one 'G', so only one word will start with 'G'. So, in all such pairings, only one word starts with 'G', and that word is the maximum word because all other words start with letters before 'G'.

Thus, the maximum word will always be the word starting with 'G', and since 'G' is in that word, the last word contains 'G'.

Therefore, the number of favorable pairings is indeed 5 * 6P4 = 1800, and the total number of pairings is 10395, so the probability is 40/231, leading to m + n = 271.

Wait, hold on, but I'm a bit confused because 40/231 is approximately 0.173, which is about 17.3%, which seems a bit low.

Wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps using probability concepts instead of counting.

So, another approach: think about where 'G' is placed in the pairing.

What's the probability that 'G' is paired with a letter after it (H, I, J, K, L). The number of letters after 'G' is 5, and the number of letters before or equal to 'G' is 7 (including 'G' itself).

But since in the pairing, each letter is paired with exactly one other letter, the probability that 'G' is paired with a particular letter is 1/11, because there are 11 possible partners for 'G'.

But specifically, the probability that 'G' is paired with a letter after it is 5/11, since there are 5 letters after it.

But wait, is that correct? Because when pairing, it's not just about the probability of 'G' being paired with a specific letter, but the overall structure.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent.

Wait, if we think of all possible pairings, the probability that 'G' is paired with a letter after it is equal to the number of such pairings over the total pairings.

Which is exactly what we did before: 5 * 6P4 / total pairings = 1800 / 10395 = 40 / 231, which is approximately 0.173.

But in that case, is this the same as the probability that 'G' is paired with a letter after it, which is 5/11?

Wait, 5/11 is approximately 0.4545, which is different from 40/231, which is approximately 0.173.

Wait, that suggests that my previous reasoning might be flawed.

So, perhaps I need to re-examine my approach.

Wait, perhaps the key is not just whether 'G' is paired with a letter after it, but also whether all letters after 'G' are paired among themselves or with letters before 'G'.

Because, even if 'G' is paired with a letter after it, if another letter after 'G' is paired with another letter after 'G', then that word will start with a letter after 'G', which would make the maximum word start with that higher letter, thus excluding 'G' from the maximum word.

Therefore, the favorable cases are those where 'G' is paired with a letter after it, and all other letters after 'G' are paired with letters before or equal to 'G'.

Therefore, to compute the number of favorable pairings, we need to pair 'G' with one of the five letters after it, and then pair the remaining four letters after 'G' with four letters from A, B, C, D, E, F.

Which is exactly what we did before, resulting in 5 * 6P4 = 1800.

So, the probability is 1800 / 10395 = 40 / 231.

But why is this different from just 5/11? Because 5/11 would be the probability that 'G' is paired with a letter after it, but without considering the other pairings.

So, in reality, the probability is lower because even if 'G' is paired with a letter after it, we also have to ensure that none of the other letters after 'G' are paired with each other, which would create a word starting with a letter after 'G', thus making the maximum word not contain 'G'.

Therefore, the probability is not just 5/11, but actually lower, as we have to also account for the pairings of the remaining letters after 'G'.

Therefore, our original calculation of 40/231 is correct.

But let me verify once more.

Total number of pairings: 10395.

Number of favorable pairings:

- Choose a letter after 'G' to pair with 'G': 5 choices.

- Then, pair the remaining four letters after 'G' with four letters from A-F. The number of ways to do this is C(6,4) * 4! = 15 * 24 = 360.

- Therefore, total favorable pairings: 5 * 360 = 1800.

Probability: 1800 / 10395.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 360 / 2079.

Divide by 3: 120 / 693.

Divide by 3 again: 40 / 231.

Yes, so 40/231 is correct.

Therefore, m = 40, n = 231. Since 40 and 231 share no common factors besides 1, they are coprime.

Thus, m + n = 40 + 231 = 271.

So, the final answer is 271.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{271}
</think>

To determine the probability that the last word listed contains the letter 'G', we need to consider the structure of the pairings and their alphabetical order. 

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have twelve letters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L) which are randomly grouped into six pairs. Each pair is sorted alphabetically and then the six words are listed alphabetically. We need to find the probability that the last word contains 'G'.

2. **Key Insight**: For the last word to contain 'G', 'G' must be paired with a letter after it (H, I, J, K, or L) and all other letters after 'G' must be paired with letters before 'G' (A, B, C, D, E, F). This ensures that the maximum word is the one starting with 'G'.

3. **Counting Favorable Pairings**:
   - Choose one letter from H, I, J, K, L to pair with 'G'. There are 5 choices.
   - Pair the remaining four letters after 'G' with four letters from A, B, C, D, E, F. The number of ways to do this is given by the permutation \( P(6, 4) = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 = 360 \).
   - Total favorable pairings: \( 5 \times 360 = 1800 \).

4. **Total Pairings**: The total number of ways to pair 12 letters is given by \( \frac{12!}{2^6 \times 6!} = 10395 \).

5. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is the ratio of favorable pairings to total pairings:
   \[
   \frac{1800}{10395}
   \]
   Simplifying this fraction, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1800}{10395} = \frac{40}{231}
   \]

6. **Final Result**: The probability that the last word contains 'G' is \( \frac{40}{231} \). Therefore, \( m = 40 \) and \( n = 231 \), leading to \( m + n = 271 \).

\[
\boxed{271}
\]
