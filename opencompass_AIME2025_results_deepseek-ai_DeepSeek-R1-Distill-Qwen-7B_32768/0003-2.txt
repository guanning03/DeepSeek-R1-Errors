Question:
A piecewise linear periodic function is defined by $f(x)=\begin{cases}x&\text{if }x\in[-1,1)\\2-x&\text{if }x\in[1,3)\end{cases}$ and $f(x+4)=f(x)$ for all real numbers $x$. The graph of $f(x)$ has the sawtooth pattern. The parabola $x=34y^2$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at finitely many points. The sum of the $y$-coordinates of these intersection points can be expressed in the form $\frac{a+b\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a,b,c,$ and $d$ are positive integers, $a,b,$ and $d$ have greatest common divisor equal to 1, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b+c+d$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the y-coordinates of the intersection points between the parabola \( x = 34y^2 \) and a piecewise linear periodic function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is defined over the interval \([-1, 3)\) and is extended periodically with period 4. The function has a sawtooth pattern, which I think means it goes up and down linearly in each interval.

First, I need to understand the function \( f(x) \) better. It's defined as:

\[
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
x & \text{if } x \in [-1, 1) \\
2 - x & \text{if } x \in [1, 3)
\end{cases}
\]

And it's periodic with period 4, meaning \( f(x + 4) = f(x) \) for all real numbers \( x \). So, the graph of \( f(x) \) repeats every 4 units. Since the original definition is from \([-1, 3)\), which is a 4-unit interval, the function is built in that interval and then repeats.

Let me sketch this function mentally. From \( x = -1 \) to \( x = 1 \), the function is \( f(x) = x \), so it's a straight line starting at (-1, -1) and going up to (1, 1). Then, from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = 2 - x \), which is a straight line starting at (1, 1) and going down to (3, -1). So, over each interval of length 4, the function goes from -1 to 1 linearly, then from 1 back to -1 linearly, and repeats.

Since the function is periodic with period 4, every 4 units, the pattern repeats. So, the graph will have a sawtooth pattern, going up from -1 to 1 over each 2-unit interval and then down from 1 to -1 over the next 2-unit interval. So, the period is 4, with a "tooth" rising from -1 to 1 and falling back to -1.

Now, the parabola given is \( x = 34y^2 \). This is a standard parabola that opens to the right, with vertex at the origin. It's symmetric about the x-axis because if you replace \( y \) with \( -y \), the equation remains the same.

I need to find the points where this parabola intersects the function \( f(x) \). So, these points must satisfy both equations: \( x = 34y^2 \) and \( x = f(y) \). Therefore, the intersection points are solutions to the equation \( 34y^2 = f(y) \).

So, essentially, I need to solve \( f(y) = 34y^2 \). Because \( x = 34y^2 \) must also lie within the domain where \( f(x) \) is defined. Since \( f(x) \) is periodic, I can consider the intersections within one period and then extend it to all periods.

But wait, actually, since \( f(x) \) is periodic every 4 units, and the parabola \( x = 34y^2 \) extends infinitely in the positive x-direction as \( y \) increases or decreases. So, there might be infinitely many intersections? But the problem states that the parabola intersects the graph of \( f(x) \) at finitely many points. So, that suggests that within each period, there are a finite number of intersections, and maybe the intersections only occur within a certain range of \( y \) values.

Wait, but \( x = 34y^2 \) is a parabola that only covers \( x \geq 0 \), since \( y^2 \) is non-negative. So, \( x \) must be non-negative. That means we only need to consider \( x \geq 0 \) for the intersections.

Looking at the function \( f(x) \), it is defined over all real numbers, but since it's periodic with period 4, we can consider its behavior over each interval of length 4. However, since we have \( x = 34y^2 \geq 0 \), the intersections must occur where \( f(x) \) is non-negative as well.

Wait, is \( f(x) \) always non-negative? Let's see. In the interval \([-1,1)\), \( f(x) = x \), so it can be negative or positive. In the interval \([1,3)\), \( f(x) = 2 - x \), which ranges from 1 to -1. So, in the interval \([1,3)\), \( f(x) \) can also be negative.

But since \( x = 34y^2 \) is always non-negative, the intersection points must satisfy \( f(y) = 34y^2 \geq 0 \). So, actually, the left-hand side, \( f(y) \), must be non-negative as well.

Therefore, we need to find all \( y \) such that \( f(y) \geq 0 \) and \( f(y) = 34y^2 \). So, let me analyze where \( f(y) \geq 0 \).

Looking at \( f(y) \):

1. For \( y \in [-1, 1) \), \( f(y) = y \). So, \( f(y) \geq 0 \) when \( y \geq 0 \), i.e., \( y \in [0, 1) \).
2. For \( y \in [1, 3) \), \( f(y) = 2 - y \). So, \( f(y) \geq 0 \) when \( 2 - y \geq 0 \), i.e., \( y \leq 2 \). So, \( y \in [1, 2] \).

But since the function is periodic, beyond \( y = 3 \), the function \( f(y) \) repeats its behavior. So, for \( y \in [3, 5) \), \( f(y) = f(y - 4) \). Similarly, \( y \in [5,7) \), \( f(y) = f(y - 8) \), and so on. So, in each interval \( [4k - 1, 4k + 1) \) for integer \( k \), \( f(y) \) behaves like \( y - 4k \) in \( [-1, 1) \) and \( 2 - (y - 4k) \) in \( [1, 3) \).

But since \( x = 34y^2 \) is non-negative, and \( f(y) \) is periodic, but \( f(y) \) can be positive or negative depending on \( y \). However, since \( x = 34y^2 \geq 0 \), we only need to consider \( y \) such that \( f(y) \geq 0 \).

Therefore, the possible \( y \) values where \( f(y) \geq 0 \) are in intervals where \( f(y) \) is non-negative. As we saw:

- In \( [-1, 1) \), \( f(y) = y \), so non-negative on \( [0, 1) \).
- In \( [1, 3) \), \( f(y) = 2 - y \), so non-negative on \( [1, 2] \).
- In \( [3, 5) \), since \( f(y) = f(y - 4) \), which for \( y \in [3,5) \), \( y - 4 \in [-1,1) \), so \( f(y) = y - 4 \). So, non-negative when \( y - 4 \geq 0 \), i.e., \( y \geq 4 \). But \( y \in [3,5) \), so \( y \in [4,5) \).
- Similarly, in \( [5,7) \), \( f(y) = f(y - 8) \), which is \( f(z) \) where \( z = y - 8 \in [-3, -1) \). But \( f(z) \) is defined for all \( z \), so \( f(z) = z + 4 \) if \( z \in [-5, -3) \), but this is getting more complicated.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider that for each period, the function \( f(y) \) repeats every 4 units. So, for each integer \( k \), \( f(y) \) in \( [4k - 1, 4k + 1) \) is equal to \( f(y - 4k) \). So, the positive parts of \( f(y) \) occur in each period \( [4k - 1, 4k + 1) \) where \( f(y) \) is non-negative.

Specifically, in each interval \( [4k, 4k + 2] \), \( f(y) \) is non-negative because:

- For \( y \in [4k, 4k + 1) \), \( f(y) = y - 4k \), which is non-negative.
- For \( y \in [4k + 1, 4k + 2] \), \( f(y) = 2 - (y - 4k) = 2 - y + 4k \). Wait, hold on: if \( y \in [4k + 1, 4k + 3) \), \( f(y) = 2 - (y - 4k) \). So, \( f(y) = 2 - y + 4k \). Wait, that can't be right because 2 - (y - 4k) is 2 - y + 4k.

But hang on, 4k is an integer multiple of 4, so in each period, the function is defined as:

- \( f(y) = y - 4k \) for \( y \in [4k - 1, 4k + 1) \)
- \( f(y) = 2 - (y - 4k) \) for \( y \in [4k + 1, 4k + 3) \)

So, in each interval \( [4k - 1, 4k + 3) \), \( f(y) \) is a triangular wave going from 0 at \( y = 4k - 1 \) up to 1 at \( y = 4k \), then back down to -1 at \( y = 4k + 2 \), and then back up to 0 at \( y = 4k + 3 \).

But since \( f(y) \) is non-negative only on \( [4k, 4k + 2] \) in each period?

Wait, no. Let me analyze more carefully.

In each interval \( [4k - 1, 4k + 1) \), \( f(y) = y - 4k \). So, that's a line starting at \( y = 4k - 1 \), \( f(y) = -1 + something? Wait, no. Let's plug in \( y = 4k - 1 \): \( f(y) = (4k - 1) - 4k = -1 \). Then at \( y = 4k + 1 \), \( f(y) = (4k + 1) - 4k = 1 \). So, in \( [4k - 1, 4k + 1) \), \( f(y) \) goes from -1 to 1.

Then, in \( [4k + 1, 4k + 3) \), \( f(y) = 2 - (y - 4k) = 2 - y + 4k \). So, at \( y = 4k + 1 \), \( f(y) = 2 - (4k + 1) + 4k = 2 -1 = 1 \). At \( y = 4k + 3 \), \( f(y) = 2 - (4k + 3) + 4k = 2 - 3 = -1 \).

So, in each period \( [4k - 1, 4k + 3) \), \( f(y) \) starts at -1, goes up to 1 at \( y = 4k \), then back down to -1 at \( y = 4k + 2 \), and then up again to 0 at \( y = 4k + 3 \). Wait, hold on, at \( y = 4k + 3 \), \( f(y) = -1 \), but that's the start of the next period.

Wait, actually, because of periodicity, \( f(y) \) at \( y = 4k + 3 \) is equal to \( f(y - 4k) = f(3) \), but \( f(3) = f(3 - 4) = f(-1) = -1 \). So, yes, \( f(y) \) is -1 at \( y = 4k + 3 \).

But in terms of non-negativity, in each period:

- From \( y = 4k \) to \( y = 4k + 2 \), \( f(y) \) is non-negative? Let's check:

In \( [4k, 4k + 1) \), \( f(y) = y - 4k \), which goes from 0 to 1, so non-negative.

In \( [4k + 1, 4k + 2] \), \( f(y) = 2 - (y - 4k) = 2 - y + 4k \). So, at \( y = 4k + 1 \), \( f(y) = 1 \); at \( y = 4k + 2 \), \( f(y) = 2 - (4k + 2) + 4k = 0 \). So, in this interval, it goes from 1 down to 0, which is non-negative.

Then, from \( y = 4k + 2 \) to \( y = 4k + 3 \), \( f(y) \) is negative, going from 0 down to -1.

Therefore, in each period \( [4k - 1, 4k + 3) \), \( f(y) \) is non-negative on \( [4k, 4k + 2] \).

Therefore, the equation \( f(y) = 34y^2 \) only has solutions where \( y \) is such that \( y \in [4k, 4k + 2] \) for some integer \( k \).

But since \( x = 34y^2 \) is non-negative, and \( x = f(y) \), which is also non-negative in those intervals, we can consider each interval \( [4k, 4k + 2] \) for integer \( k \) and find the solutions \( y \) in those intervals.

However, since \( x = 34y^2 \) can be very large as \( y \) increases, we need to see for which \( k \) the equation \( 34y^2 = f(y) \) is feasible.

Given that \( f(y) \) is periodic, each interval \( [4k, 4k + 2] \) has the same behavior as the base interval \( [0, 2] \). So, essentially, for each \( k \), the equation \( 34y^2 = f(y) \) would be similar in each interval \( [4k, 4k + 2] \).

But since \( 34y^2 \) is a parabola that opens to the right, it will intersect each "tooth" of the function \( f(y) \) at two points, one on the rising slope and one on the falling slope.

Wait, but in each interval \( [4k, 4k + 2] \), \( f(y) \) is first increasing from 0 to 1, then decreasing back to 0. So, the equation \( 34y^2 = f(y) \) would intersect the rising part and the falling part, each in one point.

But to check whether these intersections occur, we need to see whether the parabola \( x = 34y^2 \) intersects the function \( f(y) \) within each interval.

However, given that \( 34y^2 \) grows quadratically, while \( f(y) \) only goes up to 1 in each interval. So, for larger \( k \), \( f(y) \) is small, but \( 34y^2 \) is large. So, the equation \( 34y^2 = f(y) \) can have solutions only when \( 34y^2 \leq 1 \), which implies \( y^2 \leq 1/34 \), so \( |y| \leq \sqrt{1/34} \).

Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me think again.

Wait, no, because \( f(y) \) is periodic, but \( x = 34y^2 \) is a parabola that opens to the right. So, for each period, \( f(y) \) is a triangular wave with amplitude 1, but \( x = 34y^2 \) is a parabola that goes upwards as \( |y| \) increases.

Therefore, the intersections can only occur where \( 34y^2 \leq 1 \), because \( f(y) \leq 1 \) everywhere. So, \( y^2 \leq 1/34 \), which means \( |y| \leq \sqrt{1/34} \).

Therefore, the only possible \( y \) values where the parabola and the function can intersect are \( y \in [-\sqrt{1/34}, \sqrt{1/34}] \). But since \( f(y) \) is even? Wait, no. Let me check:

Wait, \( f(y) \) is defined piecewise, but not symmetric. Let's see:

- For \( y \in [-1,1) \), \( f(y) = y \)
- For \( y \in [1,3) \), \( f(y) = 2 - y \)
- Then, for higher periods, it repeats.

But \( f(-y) \) is equal to \( f(y) \) if the function is even, but in this case, \( f(-y) = -y \) for \( y \in [-1,1) \), but \( f(-y) = -y \) when \( y \in [-1,1) \), which is not the same as \( f(y) \) when \( y \) is positive. So, the function is not even.

Therefore, \( f(y) \) is an odd function in the interval \( [-1,1) \), but since it repeats, the entire function is not even or odd.

Therefore, the only intersections can occur for positive \( y \) because for negative \( y \), \( x = 34y^2 \) is still positive, but \( f(y) \) is negative for some \( y \), but as we saw earlier, \( f(y) \geq 0 \) only on \( [4k, 4k + 2] \).

But \( y \) is squared, so \( y^2 \) is the same for \( y \) and \( -y \). However, \( f(y) \) is different for positive and negative \( y \). Since \( f(y) \) is not even, so the function \( f(y) \) is not symmetric about the y-axis.

But since the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, the intersections on the negative side would have different \( y \)-coordinates than on the positive side. Wait, but actually, the parabola is symmetric, so if you have an intersection at \( y = a \), there might be a corresponding intersection at \( y = -a \). But since \( f(y) \) is not symmetric, the equations for positive and negative \( y \) would be different.

Wait, let me clarify.

Suppose \( y \) is positive, then \( f(y) = \) either \( y - 4k \) or \( 2 - (y - 4k) \), depending on the interval.

If \( y \) is negative, then \( f(y) = \) either \( y + 4k \) or \( 2 - (y + 4k) \), depending on the interval.

But since the parabola is symmetric, \( x = 34y^2 \) is same for \( y \) and \( -y \), but \( f(y) \) is different.

Therefore, if \( y = a \) is a solution, then \( y = -a \) is another solution only if \( f(-a) = 34a^2 \). But since \( f(-a) \) is different from \( f(a) \), unless \( f(-a) = f(a) \), which is not necessarily true.

Therefore, the intersections can be asymmetric, but since the parabola is symmetric, I have to consider both positive and negative \( y \).

But earlier, I thought that the intersections can only occur where \( |y| \leq \sqrt{1/34} \). But wait, that would be a very small interval around \( y = 0 \). However, since the function \( f(y) \) is periodic, maybe the intersections occur in each period where \( f(y) \) is positive.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better.

Let me consider that \( x = 34y^2 \) is a parabola, and \( f(x) \) is a periodic function.

Each period of \( f(x) \) is 4 units long. So, in each interval \( [4k, 4k + 4) \), \( f(x) \) repeats.

Therefore, the equation \( x = 34y^2 \) and \( x = f(y) \) can be rewritten as \( 34y^2 = f(y) \). So, for each \( y \), we can compute \( f(y) \), which is periodic, and check if it equals \( 34y^2 \).

But \( f(y) \) is a triangular wave, so in each interval \( [4k, 4k + 2] \), it goes from 0 up to 1 and back down to 0.

Given that \( 34y^2 \) is a parabola, which is zero at \( y = 0 \) and increases as \( |y| \) increases.

So, the equation \( 34y^2 = f(y) \) will have solutions where the parabola intersects the triangular wave.

Because \( f(y) \) is periodic, but the parabola is not, I think the number of intersections is countably infinite, but the problem says it's finitely many. So, maybe within a certain range of \( y \), the equation holds.

But \( since 34y^2 \) grows rapidly, and \( f(y) \) is bounded between -1 and 1, the only solutions can be where \( 34y^2 \leq 1 \), i.e., \( |y| \leq \sqrt{1/34} \approx 0.164 \). So, only very close to zero.

But let me check: \( f(y) \) is positive in \( [4k, 4k + 2] \), so for \( y \) in \( [4k, 4k + 2] \), \( f(y) \) is positive, so \( 34y^2 = f(y) \) can have solutions in those intervals.

But since \( 34y^2 \) is a parabola opening to the right, and \( f(y) \) is a series of triangles, each period 4, with height 1.

So, in each positive interval \( [4k, 4k + 2] \), the parabola \( x = 34y^2 \) will intersect the triangular wave \( f(y) \) twice: once on the rising slope and once on the falling slope.

Wait, but if \( 34y^2 \) is small, as \( y \) is near zero, maybe it only intersects once? Or not at all? Let's think.

Wait, when \( y = 0 \), \( f(y) = 0 \), so \( 34y^2 = 0 \), so that's a solution.

But as \( y \) increases, \( f(y) \) goes up to 1, while \( 34y^2 \) goes up quadratically. So, as \( y \) increases from 0, \( 34y^2 \) will intersect the rising slope of \( f(y) \) at some point, then intersect the falling slope at another point. So, two intersections per period?

Wait, but only if \( 34y^2 \) is less than or equal to 1. Once \( 34y^2 \) exceeds 1, which happens when \( |y| > \sqrt{1/34} \approx 0.164 \), then \( 34y^2 \) will be above the peaks of \( f(y) \), so no intersections beyond that.

Therefore, the only intersections occur where \( |y| \leq \sqrt{1/34} \), so in the interval \( [-\sqrt{1/34}, \sqrt{1/34}] \).

But within this interval, how does \( f(y) \) behave?

Since \( y \) is in \( [-\sqrt{1/34}, \sqrt{1/34}] \), which is approximately \( [-0.164, 0.164] \), which is within the interval \( [-1,1) \) where \( f(y) = y \).

Therefore, for \( y \) in \( [-\sqrt{1/34}, \sqrt{1/34}] \), \( f(y) = y \). So, the equation becomes \( 34y^2 = y \), which is \( 34y^2 - y = 0 \), so \( y(34y - 1) = 0 \).

Therefore, the solutions are \( y = 0 \) and \( y = 1/34 \approx 0.0294 \).

Wait, but hold on, \( 34y^2 = f(y) \), and in this interval, \( f(y) = y \). So, 34y² = y.

So, 34y² - y = 0 => y(34y - 1) = 0 => y = 0 or y = 1/34.

Similarly, for negative \( y \), since \( f(y) = y \) in \( [-1,1) \), so \( 34y^2 = y \), which gives \( y = 0 \) or \( y = 1/34 \). But \( y \) is negative, so \( y = 0 \) is the only solution in negative.

Wait, but if \( y \) is negative, \( f(y) = y \), which is negative, while \( 34y^2 \) is positive, so \( 34y^2 = y \) can't hold for negative \( y \), because left side is positive, right side is negative. So, only \( y = 0 \) is the solution.

Wait, so in the interval \( [-\sqrt{1/34}, \sqrt{1/34}] \), only \( y = 0 \) is a solution.

But earlier, I thought that \( f(y) \) is positive on \( [0, 2] \), but in reality, \( f(y) \) is defined as \( y \) on \( [-1,1) \) and \( 2 - y \) on \( [1,3) \). So, in the interval \( [0,1) \), \( f(y) = y \), and in \( [1,2] \), \( f(y) = 2 - y \).

But within \( y \in [0, \sqrt{1/34}] \), which is approximately [0, 0.164], \( f(y) = y \). So, equation is 34y² = y, so y = 0 or y = 1/34.

Similarly, for negative \( y \), equation is 34y² = y, but since y is negative, equation is 34y² = y (negative), meaning 34y² - y = 0, which gives y = 0 or y = 1/34. But y negative, so no solution.

Therefore, only y = 0 is a solution? But that can't be, because the graph is a sawtooth, and a parabola should intersect it at more points.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is that f(y) is actually defined piecewise over all real numbers, not just over [-1,3). Because the function is periodic with period 4, so f(y + 4) = f(y).

Therefore, in the interval [4k, 4k + 2], f(y) = y - 4k. So, for y in [4k, 4k + 1], f(y) = y - 4k, which is from 0 to 1, and for y in [4k + 1, 4k + 2], f(y) = 2 - (y - 4k) = 2 - y + 4k, which is from 1 to 0.

But in that case, for each k, the function f(y) is a triangle wave going from 0 to 1 and back to 0 over each interval [4k, 4k + 2].

Therefore, if I set x = 34y² = f(y), then in each interval [4k, 4k + 2], the equation is 34y² = f(y).

But since f(y) is periodic, and 34y² is a parabola, perhaps the equation 34y² = f(y) will have two solutions per period? But only if 34y² is less than or equal to 1.

But 34y² <= 1 => y² <= 1/34 => |y| <= sqrt(1/34) ≈ 0.164.

But since the function f(y) is periodic, each period [4k, 4k + 2] for integer k could have solutions if the parabola intersects the triangular wave in that interval.

But for |y| > 0.164, 34y² > 1, so f(y) can't reach that high, so no solutions beyond that.

But wait, in each interval [4k, 4k + 2], f(y) goes from 0 up to 1 and back to 0. So, for each such interval, the equation 34y² = f(y) can have two solutions: one while f(y) is increasing (on the rising slope) and one while f(y) is decreasing (on the falling slope).

But since 34y² is a parabola opening to the right, which is uniquely determined for each x, but in this case, the equation is x = 34y² and x = f(y). So, for each x, y can be positive or negative.

But in each interval [4k, 4k + 2], the function f(y) is a triangle wave. So, the intersections would be points where x = 34y² intersects with the triangle wave in that interval.

But given that f(y) is a periodic function, and the parabola is symmetric, each intersection in a positive interval would have a corresponding intersection in the negative interval.

Wait, but since f(y) is not symmetric, as we saw earlier, this might not hold.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the equations for each interval.

Let me consider the interval [4k, 4k + 2]. In this interval, f(y) is defined as:

- For y ∈ [4k, 4k + 1): f(y) = y - 4k
- For y ∈ [4k + 1, 4k + 2]: f(y) = 2 - y + 4k

So, in [4k, 4k + 1), f(y) = y - 4k, which is a line from 0 to 1.

In [4k + 1, 4k + 2], f(y) = 2 - y + 4k, which is a line from 1 back down to 0.

So, in each of these intervals, we can set 34y² equal to the respective expressions and solve for y.

So, in [4k, 4k + 1):

Equation: 34y² = y - 4k

Similarly, in [4k + 1, 4k + 2]:

Equation: 34y² = 2 - y + 4k

So, for each integer k, we can solve these two equations in their respective intervals.

But since 34y² is always non-negative, and in [4k, 4k + 1), y - 4k is non-negative as y ≥ 4k.

In [4k + 1, 4k + 2], 2 - y + 4k is non-negative as y ≤ 4k + 2.

So, for each k, we can solve:

1. In [4k, 4k + 1):

34y² - y + 4k = 0

2. In [4k + 1, 4k + 2]:

34y² + y - 2 - 4k = 0

So, these are quadratic equations in y. For each k, we can find solutions y in the respective intervals.

But since 34y² is going to be positive, and the right-hand side is also positive, these quadratics might have real solutions.

But, we have to check if the solutions lie within the respective intervals [4k, 4k + 1) and [4k + 1, 4k + 2].

But, given that 34y² is equal to f(y), which is ≤1, we have:

34y² ≤ 1 => y² ≤ 1/34 => |y| ≤ sqrt(1/34) ≈ 0.164

But in the interval [4k, 4k + 1), y is at least 4k. So, if 4k > sqrt(1/34) ≈ 0.164, then y would have to be greater than 0.164, but 34y² would be greater than 1, which is more than f(y) which is at most 1.

Therefore, for k ≠ 0, the intervals [4k, 4k + 1) and [4k + 1, 4k + 2] lie beyond y = sqrt(1/34), so 34y² >1, which is beyond f(y)'s maximum. Therefore, for k ≠ 0, there are no solutions.

Therefore, only k = 0 can have solutions.

Therefore, in the interval [0,1):

34y² = y

Which is 34y² - y = 0 => y(34y - 1) = 0 => y = 0 or y = 1/34.

Similarly, in [1,2]:

34y² = 2 - y

Which is 34y² + y - 2 = 0

Let me solve these equations.

First, in [0,1):

Equation: 34y² - y = 0

Solutions: y = 0 and y = 1/34 ≈ 0.0294, which is within [0,1). So, y = 0 and y = 1/34.

But wait, at y = 0, f(y) = 0, and 34y² = 0, so that's an intersection. But as y approaches 0 from the right, f(y) = y, so the parabola is tangent to f(y) at y = 0?

Wait, no, because f(y) is linear in [0,1), so 34y² is a parabola, which at y = 0 has a derivative of 0, while f(y) has a derivative of 1. So, the curves cross at y = 0, but it's not a tangency.

Wait, actually, let me compute the derivatives.

f(y) in [0,1) is y, so f’(y) = 1.

The parabola x = 34y² has derivative dx/dy = 68y, so dy/dx = 1/(68y). At y = 0, the slope is undefined, but approaching from the right, the slope is vertical. So, the parabola is vertical at y = 0, while f(y) is a straight line with slope 1. So, the curves intersect at y = 0, but it's a crossing point, not a tangency.

Similarly, at y = 1/34 ≈ 0.0294, which is in [0,1), so f(y) = y, so 34y² = y.

So, that gives another intersection point.

Then, in the interval [1,2]:

Equation: 34y² = 2 - y

So, 34y² + y - 2 = 0

Let me solve this quadratic equation.

Quadratic formula: y = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a = 34, b = 1, c = -2

So, discriminant D = 1² - 4*34*(-2) = 1 + 272 = 273

So, sqrt(273) ≈ 16.524

Thus, solutions:

y = [-1 ± 16.524]/(2*34)

So,

First solution: (-1 + 16.524)/68 ≈ (15.524)/68 ≈ 0.228

Second solution: (-1 - 16.524)/68 ≈ (-17.524)/68 ≈ -0.257

But in the interval [1,2], y must be between 1 and 2.

Therefore, neither of these solutions lie in [1,2]. So, no solutions in [1,2].

Therefore, only in [0,1), we have two solutions: y = 0 and y = 1/34.

But wait, let's check if these are the only solutions.

But, the function f(y) is periodic, so do we have other solutions in other periods?

Wait, earlier, I thought that for k ≠ 0, the intervals [4k, 4k + 1) and [4k + 1, 4k + 2] are beyond y ≈ 0.164, so 34y² would be greater than 1, which is more than f(y).

But let me test for k = 1:

In [4,5):

Equation: 34y² = y - 4

So, 34y² - y + 4 = 0

Discriminant D = 1 - 4*34*4 = 1 - 544 = -543 < 0

No real solutions.

In [5,6]:

Equation: 34y² = 2 - y + 4 = 6 - y

So, 34y² + y - 6 = 0

Discriminant D = 1 + 4*34*6 = 1 + 816 = 817

Solutions: y = [-1 ± sqrt(817)]/(2*34)

sqrt(817) ≈ 28.583

So, y = (-1 + 28.583)/68 ≈ 27.583/68 ≈ 0.405

y = (-1 - 28.583)/68 ≈ negative, which is not in [5,6]

So, y ≈ 0.405 is in [0,1), not in [5,6]. So, no solutions in [5,6].

Similarly, for k = -1:

In [-4, -3):

Equation: 34y² = y - (-4) = y + 4

So, 34y² - y - 4 = 0

Discriminant D = 1 + 4*34*4 = 1 + 544 = 545

Solutions: y = [1 ± sqrt(545)]/(2*34) ≈ [1 ± 23.345]/68

Positive solution: (1 + 23.345)/68 ≈ 24.345/68 ≈ 0.357

Negative solution: (1 - 23.345)/68 ≈ negative

But in [-4, -3), y is between -4 and -3. So, 0.357 is not in that interval. Similarly, negative solution is not in that interval.

In [-3, -2]:

Equation: 34y² = 2 - y + (-4) = -2 - y

So, 34y² + y + 2 = 0

Discriminant D = 1 - 4*34*2 = 1 - 272 = -271 < 0

No real solutions.

So, for k = -1, no solutions.

Therefore, only for k = 0, we have solutions in [0,1): y = 0 and y = 1/34.

But wait, at y = 0, f(y) = 0, so that's an intersection. But in the interval [0,1), y = 0 is the left endpoint.

But since the function is periodic, is there another intersection in a different period?

Wait, actually, the equation f(y) = 34y² is symmetric around y = 0 because f(y) is not symmetric, but x = 34y² is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that y can be both positive and negative, but f(y) is not even, so the equation f(y) = 34y² can have different solutions for positive and negative y.

But in the interval [0,1), we have two solutions: y = 0 and y = 1/34.

But for negative y, let's see:

In [-1,0], f(y) = y (since f(y) is defined as y for y ∈ [-1,1)). So, in [-1,0], f(y) = y.

So, equation: 34y² = y

Which is 34y² - y = 0 => y(34y - 1) = 0 => y = 0 or y = 1/34

But in [-1,0], y can be 0 or 1/34? But 1/34 is positive, so only y = 0 is in [-1,0].

But at y = 0, we already have an intersection.

So, for negative y, does 34y² = f(y) have a solution?

Wait, for y negative, f(y) = y, which is negative, while 34y² is positive. So, 34y² = f(y) would require a positive number equals a negative number, which is impossible. Therefore, there are no solutions for y negative.

Therefore, the only solutions are y = 0 and y = 1/34.

But wait, when y = 0, x = 0, which is the origin.

But let me check if the parabola intersects the function f(x) anywhere else.

Wait, in the interval [0,1), f(y) = y, so equation is 34y² = y, solutions y = 0 and y = 1/34.

In [1,2], f(y) = 2 - y, so equation is 34y² = 2 - y, which has solutions y ≈ 0.228 and y ≈ -0.257, but 0.228 is in [0,1), not in [1,2], so no solution in [1,2].

Similarly, in other intervals, as k increases or decreases, the parabola is too far to the right or left, so no intersections.

Therefore, the only intersections are at y = 0 and y = 1/34.

So, the y-coordinates of the intersection points are y = 0 and y = 1/34.

Thus, the sum of the y-coordinates is 0 + 1/34 = 1/34.

But the problem says the sum can be expressed in the form (a + b√c)/d, where a, b, c, d are positive integers, a, b, d are relatively prime, and c is square-free.

But 1/34 is already in the form (0 + 1√1)/34, but a, b, d must be positive integers. So, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps there are more solutions.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I miscalculated something. Let me double-check.

Wait, in the interval [0,1), we have two solutions: y = 0 and y = 1/34.

But wait, when k = 0, we have the interval [0,2], but in [0,1) and [1,2], we only found y = 1/34 in [0,1). In [1,2], we didn't find any solution because the quadratic didn't yield a solution in that interval.

But, wait, let me re-examine the equation in [1,2]:

34y² + y - 2 = 0

Wait, perhaps I made an error in solving.

Wait, let me re-derive:

In [1,2], f(y) = 2 - y.

So, 34y² = 2 - y

Thus, 34y² + y - 2 = 0

So, quadratic equation: 34y² + y - 2 = 0

Solutions:

y = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 272)]/(2*34) = [-1 ± sqrt(273)]/68

sqrt(273) ≈ 16.524

So, positive solution: (-1 + 16.524)/68 ≈ 15.524 / 68 ≈ 0.228

Negative solution: (-1 - 16.524)/68 ≈ -17.524 / 68 ≈ -0.257

So, in [1,2], y must be ≥ 1, but 0.228 is less than 1, so no solutions in [1,2].

Therefore, only two solutions: y = 0 and y = 1/34.

But, wait, at y = 0, f(y) = 0, and x = 34y² = 0, which is the origin.

But is that the only intersection? Or is there another intersection?

Wait, perhaps in the negative y direction, but for y negative, f(y) is negative, and x = 34y² is positive, so they can't intersect.

But, wait, hold on. Let me think about how the function f(x) is defined beyond [ -1, 3). Since it's periodic, f(x) beyond that is repeating.

So, for x in [2, 5), f(x) is equal to f(x - 4). So, x in [2,5):

If x -4 is in [-2,1), but f is defined piecewise on [-1,3). So, for x -4 in [-2, -1), which corresponds to f(x) = 3 - (x -4) = 7 - x, as in the earlier analysis.

Similarly, for x -4 in [1,2), f(x) = 2 - (x -4) = 6 - x.

So, for x in [2,5):

- For x in [2,3): f(x) = 7 - x
- For x in [3,5): f(x) = 6 - x

So, graphically, in [2,3), f(x) is a line from 5 (at x=2) down to 4 (at x=3), and in [3,5), f(x) is a line from 4 down to 1.

But the parabola x = 34y² is still on the right side, so for x ≥ 4, y is |x|^{1/2}/sqrt(34). Wait, no, x = 34y², so y = ±sqrt(x/34).

But in the interval x ∈ [2,3), f(x) = 7 - x, which is positive, going from 5 to 4.

But f(x) is decreasing, while the parabola is increasing.

So, is there an intersection in [2,3)?

Set 34y² = 7 - x.

But x = 34y², so 34y² = 7 - 34y²

Thus, 68y² =7 => y² =7/68 => y = ±sqrt(7/68)

But in [2,3), x = 34y² is between 2 and 3, so y = sqrt(x/34) is between sqrt(2/34) ≈ 0.242 and sqrt(3/34) ≈ 0.287.

But sqrt(7/68) ≈ sqrt(0.1029) ≈ 0.3205, which is outside the interval [0.242, 0.287]. So, no solution in [2,3).

Similarly, in [3,5), f(x) = 6 - x, which is positive but decreasing from 4 to1.

Set 34y² =6 - x

But x =34y², so 34y² =6 -34y²

Thus, 68y² =6 => y² =6/68=3/34 => y=±sqrt(3/34)≈±0.291

Again, in [3,5), y would be sqrt(3/34)≈0.291, which is within [0.287, 0.3205]?

Wait, wait, hold on.

Wait, in [3,5), x ranges from 3 to5, so y = sqrt(x/34) ranges from sqrt(3/34)≈0.291 to sqrt(5/34)≈0.387.

So, y ≈0.291 is within [sqrt(3/34), sqrt(5/34)]≈ [0.291, 0.387].

But the solution y = sqrt(3/34) ≈0.291 is the boundary between where?

Wait, in [3,5), the equation 34y² =6 -x, but x=34y², so substituting, we have 34y² =6 -34y², so 68y² =6, y²=6/68=3/34, y=±sqrt(3/34). So, only positive y≈0.291.

But in [3,5), x=34y²≈34*(3/34)=3. So, x=3 is the left endpoint of [3,5).

But at x=3, f(x)=4, but 34y²=3, so y≈0.291, which is less than sqrt(1/34)≈0.164? Wait, no, sqrt(3/34)=sqrt(3)/sqrt(34)=approx1.732/5.830≈0.297.

Wait, sqrt(1/34)=approx0.164, so 0.297 is larger than that.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the intervals.

Wait, when I set 34y² =6 -x and x=34y², so substituting, 34y²=6 -34y² => 68y²=6 => y²=6/68=3/34.

Thus, y=±sqrt(3/34)≈±0.291.

But in the interval [3,5), x=34y²=34*(3/34)=3, so x=3 is the left endpoint of [3,5). So, x=3, y= sqrt(3/34)≈0.291 is in [3,5). So, it's a valid solution.

Therefore, in [3,5), there is another solution at y≈0.291.

But wait, does that make sense?

Wait, x=34y²=34*(3/34)=3, so at x=3, f(x)=4, but 34y²=3, so y= sqrt(3/34)=approx0.291.

But in [3,5), f(x)=6 -x. So, at x=3, f(x)=4, which is equal to 34*(sqrt(3/34))²=34*(3/34)=3. But wait, 4≠3. So, that can't be.

Wait, hold on, no. Wait, in [3,5), f(x)=6 -x. So, at x=3, f(x)=6 -3=3. While 34y²=34*(sqrt(3/34))²=34*(3/34)=3. So, yes, f(x)=3 and 34y²=3, so they are equal at x=3, y=sqrt(3/34).

Therefore, that's a valid solution.

So, in the interval [3,5), which is x ∈ [3,5), we have another solution at y= sqrt(3/34).

Similarly, in [2,3), f(x)=7 -x, which is 5 at x=2 and 4 at x=3.

Set 34y²=7 -x, but x=34y², so 34y²=7 -34y²

Thus, 68y²=7 => y²=7/68 => y=±sqrt(7/68)≈±0.3205.

But in [2,3), x=34y² must be between 2 and3, so y= sqrt(2/34)=sqrt(1/17)≈0.242 and sqrt(3/34)≈0.291.

But y≈0.3205 is larger than sqrt(3/34)≈0.291, so it's outside [2,3). Therefore, no solution in [2,3).

But wait, the solution at y≈0.3205 is in [3,5), where x=34y²≈34*(7/68)=3.5, which is in [3,5). So, that's a valid solution.

Therefore, in [3,5), we have another solution at y=sqrt(7/68).

Wait, but is this correct?

Wait, let me clarify:

In the interval [3,5), f(x)=6 -x.

Set 34y²=6 -x, and x=34y², so 34y² +34y²=6 =>68y²=6 => y²=6/68=3/34 => y=±sqrt(3/34). So, y= sqrt(3/34)≈0.291.

But in [3,5), x=34y²=34*(3/34)=3, so x=3, which is the left endpoint. So, that's a valid solution, but is y≈0.291.

Wait, but then wouldn't there be another solution in [3,5)?

Wait, no, because the equation only has one positive solution in that interval.

Wait, but when I set 34y²=6 -x, with x=34y², I get y²=3/34, so only one solution.

So, in [3,5), y= sqrt(3/34)≈0.291 is the solution.

Similarly, in [5,7), we can have the same kind of solutions, but we saw earlier that for k=1, the quadratic equation had solutions outside of [5,7].

But wait, let me check:

In [5,7), f(x)=2 - (x -4)=6 -x.

Wait, no, in [5,7), f(x) is periodic, so f(x)=f(x-4). Since x ∈ [5,7), x-4 ∈ [1,3). In [1,3), f(x)=2 - (x -4)=6 -x.

Wait, no, f(x)=2 - (x -4)=6 -x for x ∈ [5,7).

Wait, but 6 -x for x ∈ [5,7) is from 1 to -1, so it's positive in [5,6) and negative in [6,7).

But since we're equating to 34y², which is positive, so in [5,6):

Set 34y²=6 -x, with x ∈ [5,6). So, x=34y², so 34y²=6 -34y² =>68y²=6 => y²=6/68=3/34, so y= sqrt(3/34)≈0.291.

But in [5,6), x=34y²=3, which is less than5. So, no solution in [5,6).

In [6,7), f(x)=6 -x is negative, so 34y²=negative, which is impossible.

Therefore, in [5,7), there are no solutions.

Similarly, in [7,9), f(x)=f(x -4)=f(x -4 -4)=f(x -8). Since x ∈ [7,9), x -8 ∈ [-1,1), so f(x)=f(x -8)=x -8. So, f(x)=x -8 in [7,9).

Setting 34y²=x -8, with x=34y², so 34y²=34y² -8 => 0= -8, which is impossible.

Therefore, in [7,9), no solution.

Similarly, in [9,11), f(x)=f(x -8)=f(x -8 -4)=f(x -12). But x ∈ [9,11), x -12 ∈ [-3, -1). So, f(x)=3 + (x -12)=x -9. So, f(x)=x -9 in [9,11).

Set 34y²=x -9, but x=34y², so 34y²=34y² -9 => 0= -9, impossible.

So, in [9,11), no solution.

Similarly, in [11,13), f(x)=f(x -12)=f(x -12 -4)=f(x -16). Since x ∈ [11,13), x -16 ∈ [-5, -3). f(x)=3 + (x -16)=x -13. So, f(x)=x -13.

Set 34y²=x -13, but x=34y², so 34y²=34y² -13 =>0= -13, impossible.

Therefore, no solutions in higher intervals.

Therefore, in [3,5), we have another solution at y=sqrt(3/34), which is approximately0.291.

Similarly, in [5,7), no solutions.

But wait, in [3,5), f(x)=6 -x, which is decreasing from4 to1, while x=34y² is increasing from3 to5.

So, at y=sqrt(3/34), x=3, which is the left endpoint. So, that's one solution.

But in [3,5), since f(x) is decreasing from4 to1, and x=34y² is increasing from3 to5, they must intersect at one point. So, that's another solution.

But wait, earlier when I considered k=0, I had y= sqrt(3/34)≈0.291 as a solution in [3,5). So, that's another intersection.

Similarly, in negative y direction, but as discussed, f(y) is negative while 34y² is positive, so no solutions.

Wait, but in the interval [3,5), we have another solution at y= sqrt(3/34). So, that's another point of intersection.

But in the interval [ -1,1), we had two solutions: y=0 and y=1/34.

But wait, hold on: in [ -1,1), we have y=0 and y=1/34.

In [1,3), we had y= sqrt(7/68)≈0.228, but that didn't correspond to a solution in [1,2).

Wait, but in [3,5), we have y= sqrt(3/34)≈0.291.

So, in total, in the interval [ -1,5), we have y= -1/34, 0, 1/34, and sqrt(3/34). But y can't be negative because f(y) is negative there, so only y=0, 1/34, and sqrt(3/34).

Wait, but in the interval [ -1,1), we have y=0 and y=1/34.

In [1,3), we have y= sqrt(7/68)≈0.228, but that's in the interval [1,2), but does it correspond to a solution?

Wait, let's re-examine.

In [1,2), f(x)=2 - (x -4)=6 -x. So, equation is 34y²=6 -x, with x=34y².

Therefore, 34y²=6 -34y² =>68y²=6 => y²=6/68=3/34 => y=sqrt(3/34)≈0.291.

But in [1,2), x=34y²=3, which is the left endpoint, so x=3 is in [3,5), but in [1,2), x=3 is not in that interval.

Therefore, in [1,2), the solution y= sqrt(3/34)≈0.291 is not in [1,2). Therefore, no solution in [1,2).

Similarly, in [2,3), f(x)=7 -x.

Set 34y²=7 -x, with x=34y². So, 34y²=7 -34y² =>68y²=7 => y²=7/68 => y≈0.3205.

But in [2,3), x=34y²=34*(7/68)=3.5, which is in [3,5). So, this is a solution in [3,5), which is covered in the previous interval.

Therefore, the solution in [2,3) is at x=3.5, y≈0.3205, which is already accounted for in [3,5).

Therefore, the only unique solutions are in [ -1,1), [3,5), and [5,7), but [5,7) doesn't yield a solution.

Wait, in [ -1,1), we have y=0 and y=1/34.

In [3,5), we have y= sqrt(3/34).

So, in total, three solutions: y=0, y=1/34, and y= sqrt(3/34).

Wait, but y= sqrt(3/34) is approximately0.291, which is greater than y=1/34≈0.0294.

But, wait, hold on. In [ -1,1), y=0 is a solution, and y=1/34≈0.0294 is another solution.

In [3,5), y= sqrt(3/34)≈0.291 is another solution.

But in [ -1,1), the interval is y ∈ [-1,1). So, y= sqrt(3/34)≈0.291 is within [ -1,1), so that's another solution.

Wait, but in [ -1,1), f(y) is equal to y for y ∈ [-1,1). So, the equation is 34y² = y, giving y=0 and y=1/34.

But wait, y= sqrt(3/34)≈0.291 is not a solution because f(y)= y in [ -1,1), so setting 34y² = y, which only gives y=0 and y=1/34.

Wait, but earlier, I thought of [3,5) giving another solution.

But, no, in [3,5), we have x=34y² in [3,5), so y= sqrt(3/34)≈0.291, which is in [ -1,1), so it's accounted for in the interval [ -1,1).

Therefore, in [3,5), the solution is already considered as y= sqrt(3/34) in [ -1,1). So, no need to count it again.

Wait, but in [3,5), f(x)=6 -x, which is different from f(y)= y.

But in the equation x=34y², x is in [3,5), y is in [ -1,1). So, for each y in [ -1,1), you get an x in [0,34). So, in [ -1,1), the solutions are y=0 and y=1/34, corresponding to x=0 and x=34*(1/34)=1.

In [3,5), x=34y² ranges from3 to5, so y ranges from sqrt(3/34)≈0.291 to sqrt(5/34)≈0.387. So, since in [ -1,1), y ranges up to1, these y values are within [ -1,1). Therefore, in [3,5), the solutions correspond to y= sqrt(3/34) and y= sqrt(5/34), but wait, why?

Wait, in [3,5), f(x)=6 -x, so equation is 34y²=6 -x.

But x=34y², so 34y²=6 -34y² =>68y²=6 => y²=6/68=3/34 => y= sqrt(3/34). So, in [3,5), only one solution at y= sqrt(3/34).

But in [ -1,1), we have two solutions: y=0 and y=1/34. So, in total, three solutions: y=0, y=1/34, and y= sqrt(3/34).

But wait, in [3,5), the solution at y= sqrt(3/34) is already in [ -1,1). So, is it a duplicate?

Wait, no, because the x in [3,5) corresponds to y= sqrt(3/34). So, it's a different point.

Therefore, in the entire real line, the solutions for y are:

1. y=0

2. y=1/34

3. y= sqrt(3/34)

But wait, y= sqrt(3/34) is approximately0.291, which is in [ -1,1). So, it's a different solution.

But then, in the interval [3,5), we have another solution?

Wait, no, in [3,5), we have x=34y²=3, which is the left endpoint, so x=3, y= sqrt(3/34). So, it's the same solution as in [ -1,1).

Therefore, in reality, the only unique solutions are y=0 and y=1/34 and y= sqrt(3/34). But y= sqrt(3/34) is approximately0.291, which is a different point.

Wait, hold on, in [ -1,1), we have two solutions: y=0 and y=1/34.

In [3,5), we have another solution: y= sqrt(3/34).

So, in total, three solutions: y=0, y=1/34, y= sqrt(3/34).

But wait, when k=0, we have the interval [0,4), which includes [0,1), [1,2), [2,3), [3,4). So, in [0,1): y=0 and y=1/34.

In [3,4): equation 34y²=2 - (y -4)=6 -y.

So, 34y² + y -6=0.

Solutions: y = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 816)]/(2*34) = [-1 ± sqrt(817)]/68.

sqrt(817)≈28.583

So, y=( -1 +28.583 )/68≈27.583/68≈0.403.

But in [3,4), y must be between sqrt(1/34)≈0.164 and sqrt(3/34)≈0.291. So, 0.403 is outside that interval, so no solution in [3,4).

Therefore, in [3,4), no solution.

Therefore, in the interval [0,4), we have two solutions: y=0 and y=1/34.

Similarly, in [ -4,0), we have two solutions: y=0 and y=-1/34.

But wait, in [ -4,0), equation 34y²= f(y)= y.

So, 34y²= y =>34y² - y=0 => y(34y -1)=0 => y=0 or y=1/34.

But in [ -4,0), y is negative, so only y=0 is a solution.

So, in [ -4,0), only y=0.

Therefore, in total, for all k, the solutions are:

1. y=0

2. y=1/34

3. y= sqrt(3/34)

But wait, y= sqrt(3/34) is approximately0.291, which is in [ -1,1), so it's a different solution.

Therefore, the sum of the y-coordinates is y=0 + y=1/34 + y= sqrt(3/34).

But hold on, I thought in [3,5), we had y= sqrt(3/34). But in reality, in [3,5), the solution is at y= sqrt(3/34), which is already considered in [ -1,1). So, it's a separate solution.

Wait, but in the equation x=34y², for each y in [ -1,1), we get an x in [0,34). So, for y=0, x=0; for y=1/34, x=34*(1/34)=1; for y= sqrt(3/34), x=34*(3/34)=3.

So, three solutions: (0,0), (1,1/34), and (3, sqrt(3/34)). But wait, hold on, (3, sqrt(3/34)) is a point on the parabola, but sqrt(3/34) is y≈0.291, so 34*(0.291)^2≈34*(0.0846)≈2.88, which is not equal to 3. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, in [3,5), we have x=34y²=3, which is the left endpoint. So, in that case, y= sqrt(3/34). So, the point is (3, sqrt(3/34)), which is on the parabola x=34y².

But in the equation x=34y², if x=3, then y= sqrt(3/34). So, that's a valid point.

Therefore, the intersection points are:

1. (0,0)

2. (1,1/34)

3. (3, sqrt(3/34))

But wait, but hold on, in [ -1,1), we only have y=0 and y=1/34.

In [3,5), we have y= sqrt(3/34), which is another point.

Therefore, in total, three intersection points.

But hold on, y= sqrt(3/34) is approximately0.291, which is in [ -1,1), so it's a separate solution.

So, the y-coordinates are 0, 1/34, and sqrt(3/34). Therefore, the sum is 0 + 1/34 + sqrt(3/34).

But the problem states that the sum can be expressed as (a + b√c)/d. So, 0 is just 0, so the sum is (1 + sqrt(3))/34, since sqrt(3/34) is sqrt(3)/sqrt(34).

But sqrt(3)/sqrt(34) can be rationalized as sqrt(102)/34.

So, sqrt(3)/sqrt(34) = sqrt(3*34)/34 = sqrt(102)/34.

Therefore, the sum is 0 + 1/34 + sqrt(102)/34 = (1 + sqrt(102))/34.

But wait, 1 + sqrt(102) over 34. So, a=1, b=1, c=102, d=34.

But check if 102 can be simplified. 102 factors into 2*3*17, which is square-free, so c=102 is square-free.

Also, 1 and 34 are coprime, and 1 and 34 are coprime with 102.

Therefore, the sum is (1 + sqrt(102))/34.

Therefore, a=1, b=1, c=102, d=34.

So, a + b + c + d=1 +1 +102 +34=138.

But wait, before confirming, let me double-check my steps.

First, in [ -1,1), equation is 34y² = y, so y=0 or y=1/34.

In [3,5), equation is 34y²=6 -x, with x=34y², which gives 34y² +34y²=6 =>68y²=6 => y²=3/34 => y= sqrt(3/34).

So, that is another solution.

Similarly, in [ -4,0), equation is 34y² = y, which gives y=0 or y=1/34, but since y is negative, only y=0 is a solution.

Therefore, in total, three solutions: y=0, y=1/34, and y= sqrt(3/34). So, the sum is 0 + 1/34 + sqrt(3/34) = (1 + sqrt(102))/34.

Therefore, a=1, b=1, c=102, d=34.

Sum:1+1+102+34=138.

But the problem statement says the sum is (a + b√c)/d, where a, b, c, d are positive integers, a, b, d are relatively prime, and c square-free.

In our case, a=1, b=1, c=102, d=34.

Check if 1,1,34 are relatively prime: gcd(1,1)=1, gcd(1,34)=1, gcd(34,1)=1. So, they are pairwise coprime, so overall, they are relatively prime.

c=102, which factors into 2*3*17, which is square-free.

So, yes, this is in the required form.

Therefore, the answer is 1 +1 +102 +34=138.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{138}
</think>

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as a periodic function with period 4, given by:

\[
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
x & \text{if } -1 \leq x < 1, \\
2 - x & \text{if } 1 \leq x < 3, \\
f(x - 4) & \text{for all } x.
\end{cases}
\]

We need to find the sum of the \( y \)-coordinates of the intersection points between the parabola \( x = 34y^2 \) and the graph of \( f(x) \).

1. **Understanding the function \( f(x) \)**:
   - The function is periodic with period 4.
   - On the interval \([-1, 1)\), \( f(x) = x \).
   - On the interval \([1, 3)\), \( f(x) = 2 - x \).

2. **Intersection with the parabola**:
   - The equation to solve is \( 34y^2 = f(y) \).
   - For \( y \) in \([-1, 1)\), \( f(y) = y \). Thus, \( 34y^2 = y \) gives solutions \( y = 0 \) and \( y = \frac{1}{34} \).
   - For \( y \) in \([3, 5)\), \( f(y) = 6 - y \). Setting \( 34y^2 = 6 - y \) gives solutions \( y = \sqrt{\frac{3}{34}} \).

3. **Verification of solutions**:
   - The solutions \( y = 0 \), \( y = \frac{1}{34} \), and \( y = \sqrt{\frac{3}{34}} \) are valid as they lie within the respective intervals.

4. **Sum of \( y \)-coordinates**:
   - The sum of the \( y \)-coordinates is \( 0 + \frac{1}{34} + \sqrt{\frac{3}{34}} \).
   - Expressing \( \sqrt{\frac{3}{34}} \) as \( \frac{\sqrt{102}}{34} \), the sum becomes \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{102}}{34} \).

5. **Final result**:
   - The sum is expressed as \( \frac{a + b\sqrt{c}}{d} \) where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 102 \), and \( d = 34 \).
   - The sum \( a + b + c + d = 1 + 1 + 102 + 34 = 138 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{138}
\]
