Question:
The set of points in 3-dimensional coordinate space that lie in the plane $x+y+z=75$ whose coordinates satisfy the inequalities $x-yz<y-zx<z-xy$ forms three disjoint convex regions.

The area of this finite region can be expressed in the form $a\sqrt{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of a specific region in 3-dimensional space. The region is defined by the plane equation x + y + z = 75 and a set of inequalities: x - yz < y - zx < z - xy. They mentioned that this forms three disjoint convex regions, but only one of them has a finite area, and I need to find that area expressed in the form a√b, then compute a + b.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the inequalities and how they relate to each other on the plane x + y + z = 75.

So, the inequalities given are x - yz < y - zx and y - zx < z - xy. Let me write them down:

1. x - yz < y - zx
2. y - zx < z - xy

I can rewrite these inequalities to make them easier to handle. Let's take the first inequality:

x - yz < y - zx

Let me subtract x from both sides:

- yz < y - zx - x

Hmm, maybe factoring terms would help.

Wait, another approach: Let me bring all terms to one side.

x - yz - y + zx < 0

Similarly, factor:

x + zx - y - yz < 0

Factor terms with x and y:

x(1 + z) - y(1 + z) < 0

Factor out (1 + z):

(1 + z)(x - y) < 0

Similarly, do the same for the second inequality:

y - zx < z - xy

Bring all terms to one side:

y - zx - z + xy < 0

Factor:

y + xy - zx - z < 0

Factor terms with y and z:

y(1 + x) - z(1 + x) < 0

Factor out (1 + x):

(1 + x)(y - z) < 0

So, now the inequalities become:

1. (1 + z)(x - y) < 0
2. (1 + x)(y - z) < 0

Interesting. So, we have two inequalities:

(1 + z)(x - y) < 0
(1 + x)(y - z) < 0

Now, let's analyze these. Since x, y, z are coordinates on the plane x + y + z = 75, which is a plane in 3D space, but we can parameterize it somehow.

But perhaps it's better to consider the signs of (1 + z) and (1 + x) because that's what the inequalities depend on. Let's see.

First, (1 + z)(x - y) < 0. So, either (1 + z) is positive and (x - y) is negative, or (1 + z) is negative and (x - y) is positive. Similarly, for (1 + x)(y - z) < 0, either (1 + x) is positive and (y - z) is negative, or (1 + x) is negative and (y - z) is positive.

So, let's denote:

Case 1: Both (1 + z) and (1 + x) are positive.

Then, from first inequality: (x - y) < 0 => x < y

From second inequality: (y - z) < 0 => y < z

So, in this case, we have x < y < z

Case 2: (1 + z) is positive and (1 + x) is negative.

From first inequality: x - y > 0 => x > y

From second inequality: Since (1 + x) is negative, (y - z) must be positive to make the product negative. So, y - z > 0 => y > z

Thus, in this case, x > y > z

Case 3: (1 + z) is negative and (1 + x) is positive.

First inequality: (1 + z) < 0, so (x - y) > 0 => x > y

Second inequality: (1 + x) > 0, so (y - z) < 0 => y < z

So, x > y < z

Case 4: Both (1 + z) and (1 + x) are negative.

From first inequality: (x - y) > 0 => x > y

From second inequality: (y - z) > 0 => y > z

So, x > y > z

Wait, hold on. So, Cases 2 and 4 both result in x > y > z, but with different conditions on (1 + z) and (1 + x). Similarly, Cases 1 and 3 both result in different orderings but with different signs.

But I need to consider where (1 + z) and (1 + x) are positive or negative.

So, (1 + z) positive implies z > -1, and negative implies z < -1.

Similarly, (1 + x) positive implies x > -1, and negative implies x < -1.

Therefore, the regions where x, z are greater than -1 or less than -1.

So, the plane x + y + z = 75. Since x + y + z = 75, which is a large positive number, it's unlikely that x, y, z are negative because their sum is 75, which is positive.

But let's verify. Suppose x, y, z are all greater than -1, which is possible, but if one of them is less than -1, say x < -1, then y + z = 75 - x > 75 + 1 = 76, so y and z would need to compensate. But since we're dealing with 3D space, it's possible for one coordinate to be negative while others are larger.

But let's see: in our inequalities, only (1 + z) and (1 + x) come into play, not (1 + y). So, perhaps y can be arbitrary?

Wait, no, because the inequalities involve both x, y, z. So, perhaps we can model this.

Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize the plane x + y + z = 75.

Let me try to express two variables in terms of the third.

Let me set x and y as parameters, then z = 75 - x - y.

So, all points on the plane can be represented as (x, y, 75 - x - y).

Then, substitute z into the inequalities.

So, starting with the first inequality:

(1 + z)(x - y) < 0

z = 75 - x - y, so 1 + z = 1 + 75 - x - y = 76 - x - y

So, the first inequality becomes:

(76 - x - y)(x - y) < 0

Similarly, the second inequality:

(1 + x)(y - z) < 0

z = 75 - x - y, so y - z = y - (75 - x - y) = y - 75 + x + y = x + 2y - 75

Therefore, second inequality:

(1 + x)(x + 2y - 75) < 0

So, now we have two inequalities in terms of x and y:

1. (76 - x - y)(x - y) < 0
2. (1 + x)(x + 2y - 75) < 0

So, now we have a system of inequalities in x and y. Let me write them down:

Inequality 1: (76 - x - y)(x - y) < 0

Inequality 2: (1 + x)(x + 2y - 75) < 0

So, now, we can consider each inequality separately and then find the intersection.

Let me first analyze Inequality 1: (76 - x - y)(x - y) < 0

Let me denote A = 76 - x - y and B = x - y.

So, A * B < 0.

Which means that A and B have opposite signs.

So, either A > 0 and B < 0, or A < 0 and B > 0.

So, either:

Case 1: 76 - x - y > 0 and x - y < 0

Which is:

x + y < 76 and x < y

Or,

Case 2: 76 - x - y < 0 and x - y > 0

Which is:

x + y > 76 and x > y

So, Inequality 1 divides the plane into two regions: either below the line x + y = 76 with x < y or above x + y = 76 with x > y.

Similarly, let's analyze Inequality 2: (1 + x)(x + 2y - 75) < 0

Let me denote C = 1 + x and D = x + 2y - 75.

So, C * D < 0

Again, this means that either C > 0 and D < 0, or C < 0 and D > 0.

So, either:

Case A: 1 + x > 0 and x + 2y - 75 < 0

Which is:

x > -1 and x + 2y < 75

Or,

Case B: 1 + x < 0 and x + 2y - 75 > 0

Which is:

x < -1 and x + 2y > 75

So, Inequality 2 divides the plane into two regions: either right of x = -1 with x + 2y < 75 or left of x = -1 with x + 2y > 75.

Now, combining Inequalities 1 and 2, we have four possible cases:

1. Case 1 and Case A: (x + y < 76 and x < y) and (x > -1 and x + 2y < 75)
2. Case 1 and Case B: (x + y < 76 and x < y) and (x < -1 and x + 2y > 75)
3. Case 2 and Case A: (x + y > 76 and x > y) and (x > -1 and x + 2y < 75)
4. Case 2 and Case B: (x + y > 76 and x > y) and (x < -1 and x + 2y > 75)

But considering that x + y + z = 75, and z is a coordinate, I wonder if the plane cuts through positive and negative coordinates. For example, if x is very negative, then y + z must be 75 - x, which would be larger than 75, so y and z can be large positive numbers.

But since x is a coordinate, it can be any real number, positive or negative, as long as the sum is 75.

So, let's try to visualize these inequalities.

First, Inequality 1: (x + y < 76 and x < y) or (x + y > 76 and x > y). So, it's the regions above the line x + y = 76 but x > y, or below the line x + y = 76 but x < y.

Similarly, Inequality 2: (x > -1 and x + 2y < 75) or (x < -1 and x + 2y > 75). So, it's the regions right of x = -1 but below x + 2y = 75, or left of x = -1 but above x + 2y = 75.

So, now, to find the regions where both inequalities hold, we need to intersect these regions.

Given that, let's consider each case.

Case 1 and Case A: x + y < 76 and x < y, and x > -1 and x + 2y < 75.

So, x > -1, x < y, x + y < 76, x + 2y < 75.

Similarly, let's see if these can be satisfied.

Case 1 and Case A: x > -1, x < y, x + y < 76, x + 2y < 75.

Since x < y, so replacing y with something larger. Let me see.

From x + 2y < 75, since y > x, 2y > 2x, so x + 2y > x + 2x = 3x.

But x > -1, so 3x > -3.

Therefore, x + 2y < 75, which is a larger upper bound.

But x + y < 76, so x + 2y < 75 is a stricter condition since 2y > y.

So, the stricter condition is x + 2y < 75.

So, combining x > -1, x < y, and x + 2y < 75.

Similarly, let's try to find the bounds.

Case 1 and Case B: x + y < 76 and x < y, and x < -1 and x + 2y > 75.

So, x < -1, x < y, x + y < 76, and x + 2y > 75.

But since x < -1 and x + 2y > 75, let's see if that's possible.

So, x < -1, and x + 2y > 75 => 2y > 75 - x.

But since x < -1, 75 - x > 75 - (-1) = 76.

Therefore, 2y > 76 => y > 38.

Similarly, from x + y < 76 and x < -1, since x < -1 and y > 38, x + y can be less than 76 as long as y < 76 - x.

But since x < -1, 76 - x > 76 + 1 = 77.

Therefore, y > 38 and y < 76 - x.

So, 38 < y < 76 - x.

But since x < -1, and y must be greater than 38, perhaps this region is possible.

But let's see.

Case 2 and Case A: x + y > 76 and x > y, and x > -1 and x + 2y < 75.

So, x > -1, x > y, x + y > 76, and x + 2y < 75.

Wait, but x + y > 76 and x + 2y < 75.

If x + y > 76, then x + 2y = (x + y) + y > 76 + y.

But x + 2y < 75, so 76 + y < x + 2y < 75 => 76 + y < 75 => y < -1.

But from x > -1 and x > y, and y < -1, so x > -1, y < -1, and x > y.

But x + y > 76, but x > -1 and y < -1, so x + y > (-1) + y, but y < -1, so x + y > -1 + y, but y is less than -1, so x + y is less than x - 1.

But x > -1, so x - 1 > -2.

But x + y > 76, which is a very large number. But x > -1, y < -1, so x + y is at most x + (-1), but x > -1, so x + y > -1 + (-1) = -2.

But 76 is way larger than -2, so this is a contradiction.

Therefore, Case 2 and Case A is impossible because x + y cannot be both >76 and <75.

Similarly, Case 2 and Case B: x + y >76 and x > y, and x < -1 and x + 2y >75.

So, x < -1, x > y, x + y >76, and x + 2y >75.

But x + y >76 and x < -1.

So, x < -1, y >76 - x.

But since x < -1, 76 - x >76 +1=77.

Therefore, y >77.

Also, x + 2y >75.

Given x < -1 and y >77, let's see.

x + 2y >75.

Since y >77, 2y >154, so x + 2y > x + 154.

Since x < -1, x + 154 <153.

But 153 <75? No, 153 is greater than 75.

Wait, 153 >75, so x + 2y >75 is automatically satisfied because x + 2y > x + 154 > (-1) + 154 =153 >75.

Wait, but x can be less than -1, so x + 2y could be less than 153.

Wait, let me rephrase.

From x + 2y >75, but x < -1, y >77.

So, x + 2y >75 => 2y >75 -x.

But x < -1, so 75 -x >75 +1=76.

Thus, 2y >76 => y >38.

But y >77, so y >77 is more restrictive.

So, in this case, the conditions are x < -1, y >77, and x > y.

But x > y, but y >77, so x >77.

But x < -1, so x >77 and x < -1 is impossible.

Therefore, Case 2 and Case B is impossible as well.

So, only Case 1 and Case A, and Case 1 and Case B are possible.

So, in total, two regions.

But the problem says three disjoint convex regions. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the cases.

Wait, in the first analysis, I considered four cases, but perhaps some of them are impossible, leaving only two regions.

But the problem states three regions, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, let me double-check.

Looking back, the inequalities (1 + z)(x - y) <0 and (1 + x)(y - z) <0.

Wait, when I set z =75 -x - y, I get (76 -x - y)(x - y) <0 and (1 +x)(x + 2y -75) <0.

So, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Let me consider the two inequalities:

1. (76 - x - y)(x - y) <0

2. (1 + x)(x + 2y -75) <0

Let me denote u = x + y.

Then, inequality 1 becomes (76 - u)(x - y) <0

Inequality 2 becomes (1 + x)(x + 2y -75) <0

But since u =x + y, we can write 2y = 2u - 2x - 2y? Wait, no. Wait, x + 2y = x + 2(u - x) = 2u - x

Wait, yes, x + 2y = 2u - x.

So, inequality 2 becomes (1 + x)(2u - x -75) <0

So, substituting u into the inequalities.

So, now, with u =x + y.

So, inequality 1: (76 - u)(x - y) <0

Inequality 2: (1 + x)(2u - x -75) <0

But u = x + y, so y = u - x.

Therefore, inequality 1: (76 - u)(x - (u - x)) <0 => (76 - u)(2x - u) <0

Similarly, inequality 2: (1 + x)(2u - x -75) <0

So, now, let's write both inequalities:

1. (76 - u)(2x - u) <0

2. (1 + x)(2u - x -75) <0

Now, perhaps I can analyze this in terms of u and x.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the regions in the plane.

So, the plane x + y + z =75 is a 2D plane, so the inequalities define regions on this plane, which are convex.

But the problem says three convex regions, but only one has finite area. Hmm.

But in our analysis, it seems we have only two regions.

Wait, maybe I missed some cases.

Wait, originally, the inequalities (1 + z)(x - y) <0 and (1 + x)(y - z) <0 can have different signs depending on the regions.

Wait, so perhaps we should analyze the signs of (1 + z), (x - y), (1 + x), and (y - z).

Each of these factors can be positive or negative, so the signs can be arranged in different ways.

So, perhaps, the inequalities can be satisfied in multiple ways.

Wait, let me think.

Each inequality is a product of two terms less than zero, so each inequality corresponds to one term positive and the other negative.

So, for the first inequality, (1 + z)(x - y) <0: either (1 + z) >0 and (x - y) <0, or (1 + z) <0 and (x - y) >0.

Similarly, for the second inequality, (1 + x)(y - z) <0: either (1 + x) >0 and (y - z) <0, or (1 + x) <0 and (y - z) >0.

So, each inequality splits into two cases, so in total, 2 * 2 =4 combinations.

So, four cases:

1. (1 + z) >0 and (x - y) <0; and (1 + x) >0 and (y - z) <0

2. (1 + z) >0 and (x - y) <0; and (1 + x) <0 and (y - z) >0

3. (1 + z) <0 and (x - y) >0; and (1 + x) >0 and (y - z) <0

4. (1 + z) <0 and (x - y) >0; and (1 + x) <0 and (y - z) >0

So, these are four cases. Each case may lead to a different region.

So, let's analyze each case.

Case 1: (1 + z) >0 and (x - y) <0; and (1 + x) >0 and (y - z) <0

So, (1 + z) >0 => z > -1

(x - y) <0 =>x < y

(1 + x) >0 =>x > -1

(y - z) <0 => y < z

So, combining these, we have z > -1, x > -1, x < y, y < z.

So, x > -1, x < y < z.

But since z =75 -x - y, so y <75 -x - y => 2y <75 -x => y < (75 -x)/2

Therefore, in this case, x > -1, x < y, y < (75 -x)/2.

Additionally, z =75 -x - y > y, so 75 -x - y > y =>75 -x >2y => y < (75 -x)/2, which is already included.

So, in this case, the region is x > -1, x < y < (75 -x)/2.

Similarly, let's consider the inequalities.

But in addition, we have the inequalities we derived earlier:

(76 - x - y)(x - y) <0 and (1 + x)(x + 2y -75) <0

Wait, perhaps I should integrate these.

But maybe it's better to consider the four cases.

Case 2: (1 + z) >0 and (x - y) <0; and (1 + x) <0 and (y - z) >0

So, (1 + z) >0 => z > -1

(x - y) <0 =>x < y

(1 + x) <0 =>x < -1

(y - z) >0 =>y > z

So, combining: z > -1, x < -1, x < y, y > z.

Since y > z, and z =75 -x - y, so y >75 -x - y =>2y >75 -x => y > (75 -x)/2

Also, from x < -1, and z =75 -x - y > -1 (since z > -1), so 75 -x - y > -1 =>x + y <76

So, in this case, x < -1, x < y, y > (75 -x)/2, and x + y <76.

Case 3: (1 + z) <0 and (x - y) >0; and (1 + x) >0 and (y - z) <0

So, (1 + z) <0 =>z < -1

(x - y) >0 =>x > y

(1 + x) >0 =>x > -1

(y - z) <0 =>y < z

So, combining: z < -1, x > y, x > -1, y < z

But z =75 -x - y < -1 =>75 -x - y < -1 =>x + y >76

So, x > -1, x > y, y < z =75 -x - y

Also, from y < z, y <75 -x - y =>2y <75 -x => y < (75 -x)/2

But x > -1 and x > y, and y < (75 -x)/2, and x + y >76.

So, this case is x > -1, x > y, y < (75 -x)/2, x + y >76.

Case 4: (1 + z) <0 and (x - y) >0; and (1 + x) <0 and (y - z) >0

So, (1 + z) <0 =>z < -1

(x - y) >0 =>x > y

(1 + x) <0 =>x < -1

(y - z) >0 =>y > z

So, combining: z < -1, x > y, x < -1, y > z

Since z < -1, y > z, so y can be greater than z but less than something.

Also, from z =75 -x - y < -1 =>x + y >76

From x < -1, x > y, and x + y >76

So, x < -1, x > y, x + y >76

But x + y >76 and x < -1, so y >76 -x.

But since x < -1, 76 -x >76 +1=77.

Thus, y >77

Also, y > z =75 -x - y =>2y >75 -x

But x < -1, so 75 -x >75 +1=76, so 2y >76 => y >38

But since y >77, this is already satisfied.

So, in this case, x < -1, x > y, y >77, x + y >76.

But x + y >76 and y >77, so x + y >76 is automatically satisfied because y >77.

But x < -1, so x + y >76 => y >76 -x

But x < -1, so 76 -x >76 +1=77

Thus, y >77, which is consistent.

But x > y is contradictory with x < -1 and y >77, since x < -1 and y >77 =>x < y is not true, but x > y is required.

So, x > y and x < -1 and y >77.

But if x > y, then y <x, but x < -1 and y >77. But y >77 and y <x < -1 is impossible, because 77 < y <x < -1, which is impossible.

Therefore, Case 4 is impossible.

So, now, we have four cases, but Cases 1, 2, 3 are possible, and Case 4 is impossible.

Wait, that contradicts the problem statement which says three convex regions.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in the initial analysis, I considered four cases, but upon closer inspection, some cases are impossible.

Wait, so in Case 1, the region is x > -1, x < y < (75 -x)/2.

Case 2: x < -1, x < y, y > (75 -x)/2, and x + y <76.

Case 3: x > -1, x > y, y < (75 -x)/2, x + y >76.

So, these are three distinct regions.

Therefore, the set of points in the plane x + y + z =75 satisfying the inequalities form three convex regions.

Now, among these, only one has finite area.

So, we need to analyze each of these three cases.

First, let's consider Case 1: x > -1, x < y < (75 -x)/2.

Since y must be greater than x and less than (75 -x)/2.

So, we have x < y < (75 -x)/2.

But we can also express this as x < y < (75 -x)/2.

But we also have x > -1.

Additionally, since z =75 -x - y, which is greater than y because z > y (from Case 1).

But z =75 -x - y, so z > y =>75 -x - y > y =>75 -x >2y =>y < (75 -x)/2, which is already given.

So, in this case, the inequalities reduce to x > -1 and x < y < (75 -x)/2.

So, this is a region in the plane.

Similarly, let's analyze Case 2: x < -1, x < y, y > (75 -x)/2, and x + y <76.

So, here, x is less than -1, and y is between (75 -x)/2 and something less than76 -x.

Because x + y <76 => y <76 -x.

Given x < -1, 76 -x >76 +1=77.

And y > (75 -x)/2.

So, for x < -1, let's see the range of y.

(75 -x)/2 > (75 - (-1))/2 = (76)/2=38

So, y >38, and y <76 -x.

So, in this case, y is between 38 and76 -x, with x < -1.

So, x is less than -1, y is between38 and76 -x.

Similarly, z =75 -x - y, which is less than z =75 -x - y.

But since y > (75 -x)/2, z =75 -x - y <75 -x - (75 -x)/2 = (75 -x)/2

So, z < (75 -x)/2, which is less than y (since y > (75 -x)/2). So, z < y.

So, in this case, z < y.

But in Case 2, from the inequalities, we had (1 + z)(x - y) <0 and (1 +x)(y - z) <0.

We had z < -1, but wait, hold on.

Wait, in Case 2, we have (1 + z)(x - y) <0, which in Case 2: (1 + z) >0 and (x - y) <0.

But if z < -1, then 1 + z <0.

Wait, no, in Case 2, (1 + z) >0 and (x - y) <0, so z > -1.

But earlier, in Case 2, we had from (1 + z) >0 and (y - z) >0 because in Case 2, the second inequality is (1 +x) <0 and (y - z) >0.

Wait, in Case 2, (1 + z) >0, so z > -1, and (y - z) >0 => y > z.

So, in this case, z > -1, y > z, so y > z > -1.

So, z < y and z > -1.

But in Case 2, y > (75 -x)/2, and z =75 -x - y < (75 -x)/2, as we saw earlier.

So, z < (75 -x)/2 < y.

Therefore, in this case, z is between -1 and (75 -x)/2, and y is between z and76 -x.

Wait, but x is less than -1, so let's check if y > z.

Given that, yes, y > z because z =75 -x - y, so y > z => y >75 -x - y =>2y >75 -x, which is given as y > (75 -x)/2.

So, in this case, we have:

x < -1, y between (75 -x)/2 and76 -x, z =75 -x - y, which is between -1 and (75 -x)/2.

So, this is another region.

Case 3: x > -1, x > y, y < (75 -x)/2, and x + y >76.

So, in this case, x > -1, x > y, y < (75 -x)/2, and x + y >76.

But since y < (75 -x)/2, and x + y >76, let's see.

From x + y >76 and y < (75 -x)/2, substituting y < (75 -x)/2 into x + y >76, we get x + (75 -x)/2 >76.

Compute that:

x + (75 -x)/2 = (2x +75 -x)/2 = (x +75)/2 >76

So, (x +75)/2 >76 =>x +75 >152 =>x >77

So, in this case, x >77, x > y, and y < (75 -x)/2.

But if x >77, then (75 -x)/2 < (75 -77)/2= (-2)/2=-1

So, y < -1.

But in this case, from (1 + z)(x - y) <0, we had (1 + z) <0 and (x - y) >0, so z < -1.

So, in this case, z < -1, y < (75 -x)/2 < -1, and x >77.

So, let's summarize:

Case 1: x > -1, x < y < (75 -x)/2

Case 2: x < -1, x < y, y > (75 -x)/2, x + y <76

Case 3: x >77, x > y, y < (75 -x)/2, x + y >76

So, these are the three regions.

Now, to check if they are convex.

Each region is defined by linear inequalities, so they should be convex.

Now, we need to find the area of the finite region.

So, let's analyze each case.

Case 1: x > -1, x < y < (75 -x)/2

We need to see if this is a bounded region.

But x can go to infinity? Wait, no, since y < (75 -x)/2, so as x increases, (75 -x)/2 decreases.

But x is bounded below by -1.

Wait, let's see.

If we fix x > -1, then y must be greater than x and less than (75 -x)/2.

So, the upper bound on y is (75 -x)/2, which is a decreasing function of x.

As x approaches -1 from above, (75 -x)/2 approaches (75 - (-1))/2=76/2=38.

So, at x approaching -1, y is between -1 and38.

But as x increases, the upper bound on y decreases.

So, when does the upper bound on y become less than the lower bound on y?

That is, when (75 -x)/2 <x.

Solve for x:

(75 -x)/2 <x

75 -x <2x

75 <3x

x >25

So, when x >25, the upper bound on y is less than x, which is the lower bound, so no solution.

Therefore, for x >25, there is no y satisfying x < y < (75 -x)/2.

Therefore, the region is bounded in x between -1 and25.

So, x ranges from -1 to25, and for each x, y ranges from x to (75 -x)/2.

Therefore, this is a bounded region, so the area is finite.

Similarly, let's check Case 2: x < -1, x < y, y > (75 -x)/2, x + y <76.

So, x < -1, y > (75 -x)/2, and y <76 -x.

So, y is between (75 -x)/2 and76 -x.

But since x < -1, let's see.

Compute when (75 -x)/2 <76 -x:

(75 -x)/2 <76 -x

Multiply both sides by2:75 -x <152 -2x

75 -x -152 +2x <0

(75 -152) +x <0

(-77) +x <0 =>x <77

But since x < -1, this is automatically satisfied.

So, for x < -1, y is between (75 -x)/2 and76 -x.

Now, we can check if this region is bounded.

As x approaches -infty, (75 -x)/2 approaches +infty, and76 -x approaches +infty. So, y can go to infinity.

Therefore, this region is unbounded, so its area is infinite.

Similarly, Case 3: x >77, x > y, y < (75 -x)/2, x + y >76.

So, x >77, x > y, y < (75 -x)/2, and x + y >76.

So, let's see.

Given x >77, and x + y >76, so y >76 -x.

But since x >77, 76 -x < -1

Also, y < (75 -x)/2, but since x >77, (75 -x)/2 <(75 -77)/2=-1.

So, y must be between76 -x and (75 -x)/2, but since both bounds are less than -1, and y < (75 -x)/2.

But also, since x >77 and y < (75 -x)/2, and y <x.

But let's compute the upper and lower bounds on y.

Given x >77, 76 -x < -1, and (75 -x)/2 < -1.

So, y must satisfy:

76 -x < y < (75 -x)/2

But since 76 -x < y < (75 -x)/2, and 75 -x <76 -x because x >77.

Wait, no, if x >77, then 75 -x <76 -x.

So, 75 -x <76 -x < y?

Wait, no, since y must be greater than76 -x, and less than (75 -x)/2, but 75 -x <76 -x, so (75 -x)/2 <(76 -x)/2.

But 76 -x is less than (75 -x)/2?

Wait, let's check.

Compute 76 -x vs (75 -x)/2.

For x >77:

Multiply both sides by2:152 -2x vs75 -x

So, 152 -2x <75 -x?

152 -2x <75 -x

152 -75 <2x -x

77 <x

Which is true because x >77.

Therefore, 76 -x < (75 -x)/2.

Therefore, y must satisfy76 -x < y < (75 -x)/2, which is a bounded interval.

So, for each x >77, y is between76 -x and (75 -x)/2.

Now, we can compute the range of x.

Since y must be greater than76 -x and less than (75 -x)/2.

But also, since y <x, because in Case 3, y <x.

So, we have y <x.

But y >76 -x, so76 -x <y <x.

Therefore,76 -x <x =>76 <2x =>x >38.

But x >77, so that's satisfied.

Therefore, for x >77, y is between76 -x and (75 -x)/2, which is less thanx, so the region is bounded.

But wait, as x increases beyond77, (75 -x)/2 becomes more negative.

So, is this region bounded?

Wait, x can go from77 to infinity.

But as x increases, y must be between76 -x and (75 -x)/2.

As x approaches infinity, both76 -x and(75 -x)/2 approach negative infinity.

Therefore, the region is unbounded in the x direction, but bounded in y direction for each x.

So, the area would be infinite because x can go to infinity.

Wait, but for each x, the y interval is finite, but the x interval is infinite, so the area is infinite.

Therefore, only Case1 and Case2 are bounded? Wait, no.

Wait, in Case1, x ranges from -1 to25, and y is bounded betweenx and(75 -x)/2, so it's a finite area.

In Case2, x ranges from -infty to-1, but y is bounded between(75 -x)/2 and76 -x, which are both increasing functions as x approaches -infty, but y can go to infinity, so the area is infinite.

In Case3, x ranges from77 to infinity, but y is bounded between76 -x and(75 -x)/2, which are both decreasing functions as x increases, but y can go to negative infinity as x increases, so the area is also infinite.

Therefore, only the region in Case1 is finite.

Therefore, the finite region is in Case1: x > -1, x < y <(75 -x)/2.

So, the area of this finite region is to be found.

So, let's compute the area.

So, in Case1: x ranges from-1 to25, and for each x, y ranges fromx to(75 -x)/2.

So, the area is the integral overx from-1 to25 of [(75 -x)/2 -x] dx.

Simplify the integrand:

(75 -x)/2 -x = (75 -x -2x)/2 = (75 -3x)/2

So, the area A is:

A = ∫ from x = -1 tox =25 of (75 -3x)/2 dx

Compute this integral.

First, factor out1/2:

A = (1/2) ∫ from -1 to25 (75 -3x) dx

Compute the integral:

∫ (75 -3x) dx =75x - (3/2)x² +C

Evaluate from-1 to25:

At upper limit25:

75*(25) - (3/2)*(25)² =1875 - (3/2)*625=1875 -937.5=937.5

At lower limit-1:

75*(-1) - (3/2)*(-1)²= -75 - (3/2)*1= -75 -1.5= -76.5

Subtract lower limit from upper limit:

937.5 - (-76.5)=937.5 +76.5=1014

Then, multiply by1/2:

A= (1/2)*1014=507

So, the area is507.

But the problem states that the area can be expressed as a√b, wherea andb are positive integers andb is not divisible by the square of any prime.

But 507 factors:507 divided by3 is169, which is13².

So,507=3*13²

Therefore,507=3*(13)^2

Wait, but that would mean a=507 andb=1, but that doesn't match the form a√b.

Wait, but maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, no, Area=507, which is507√1, soa=507,b=1, so a +b=508.

But the problem says the area is expressed as a√b, which can be as simple as507√1, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the integral.

So, A=∫ from-1 to25 of (75 -3x)/2 dx

= (1/2) ∫ (75 -3x)dx from-1 to25

= (1/2)[75x - (3/2)x²] from-1 to25

Compute at25:

75*25=1875, (3/2)*25²= (3/2)*625=937.5

So,1875 -937.5=937.5

Compute at-1:

75*(-1)= -75, (3/2)*(-1)²=1.5

So, -75 -1.5= -76.5

Subtract:937.5 - (-76.5)=937.5 +76.5=1014

Multiply by1/2:1014*(1/2)=507

So, the integral is correct.

So, the area is507, which is507√1, soa=507,b=1, soa +b=508.

But the problem says the area is expressed in the forma√b, so maybe 507√1 is acceptable.

But let me think again.

Wait, 507=3×13², so perhaps the area is meant to be expressed as3×13²√1, but that still leaves it as507√1.

But maybe I have a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the finite region is actually a triangle or some polygon.

Wait, in Case1, the region is bounded byx > -1, x < y <(75 -x)/2.

So, plotting this, it's betweenx=-1 tox=25, with y betweenx and(75 -x)/2.

But perhaps it's a triangle.

Wait, let's check the boundaries.

Whenx=-1, y is between-1 and(75 -(-1))/2=38.

So, the upper boundary atx=-1 isy=38, but y must also be greater thanx=-1.

Similarly, atx=25, y is between25 and(75 -25)/2=25.

So, atx=25, y must be equal to25, but since it's a strict inequality, y approaches25 from above.

Wait, but in reality, the region atx=25 is a single point, so the upper limit approaches25.

Similarly, whenx=0, y is between0 and75/2=37.5

Wait, but whenx=25, (75 -25)/2=25, so the upper bound becomes equal to the lower bound, so the region ends atx=25.

So, maybe the area is a triangle with vertices at(-1,-1), (25,25), and(25,38). But wait, since y must be less than(75 -x)/2.

Wait, atx=25, y approaches25.

But maybe the region is a trapezoid or a triangle.

Wait, let me think.

Fromx=-1 toy=(75 -x)/2.

The line y=(75 -x)/2 is a straight line.

Similarly, the line y=x is another straight line.

So, the region betweenx=-1 andx=25, between the linex=y andy=(75 -x)/2.

So, the intersection of these lines occurs where x=(75 -x)/2.

Solve forx:

x=(75 -x)/2

Multiply both sides by2:2x=75 -x

3x=75 =>x=25

So, the lines intersect atx=25, y=25.

Therefore, the region is bounded byx=-1, y=x, y=(75 -x)/2, andx=25.

So, the shape is a quadrilateral with vertices at(-1,-1), (-1,38), (25,25), and(25,25). Wait, but (25,25) is a single point.

Wait, no, actually, the region is bounded betweenx=-1 tox=25, with y betweenx and(75 -x)/2.

So, the figure is a region under the liney=(75 -x)/2 and abovey=x, fromx=-1 tox=25.

So, the shape is a trapezoid.

But atx=-1, the upper bound is38, lower bound is-1.

Atx=25, the upper and lower bounds meet at25.

So, the figure is a trapezoid with vertices at(-1,-1), (-1,38), (25,25), and another point?

Wait, no, because atx=25, both lines meet at(25,25). So, the figure is a triangle with vertices at(-1,-1), (-1,38), and(25,25).

Wait, not exactly, because the region is betweenx=-1 tox=25, betweeny=x andy=(75 -x)/2.

So, the figure is a trapezoid with two sides vertical atx=-1 andx=25, but atx=25, the lines meet.

Wait, perhaps it's a triangle with vertices at(-1,-1), (-1,38), and(25,25).

Yes, because fromx=-1 to25, the upper boundary is the liney=(75 -x)/2, which goes from( -1,38) to(25,25), and the lower boundary isy=x, going from(-1,-1) to(25,25).

So, the region is a triangle with vertices at(-1,-1), (-1,38), and(25,25).

Yes, because the linesy=(75 -x)/2 andy=x intersect at(25,25), and the vertical line atx=-1 connects(-1,-1) toy=38.

So, the area is the area of this triangle.

So, to compute the area, we can use the coordinates of the vertices.

Vertices areA(-1,-1),B(-1,38), andC(25,25).

We can use the shoelace formula.

Compute the area as follows:

Arrange the points:

A(-1,-1), B(-1,38), C(25,25)

Shoelace formula:

Area =1/2 |sum over edges|

Compute:

From A to B: x changes from-1 to-1, y from-1 to38

From B to C: x from-1 to25, y from38 to25

From C to A: x from25 to-1, y from25 to-1

Compute the sum:

First, list the coordinates:

A(-1,-1), B(-1,38), C(25,25), back to A(-1,-1)

Compute the products:

(-1)*38 + (-1)*25 +25*(-1) = (-38) + (-25) + (-25) = -88

Compute the other diagonal products:

(-1)*(-1) +38*25 +25*(-1) =1 +950 -25=926

So, area is1/2 | -88 -926 | =1/2 | -1014 | =507

So, same as before, the area is507.

Therefore, the area is507, which is507√1, soa=507, b=1, thusa +b=508.

But wait, the problem states "the area of this finite region can be expressed in the form a√b", so expressing it as507√1 is acceptable becauseb=1 is square-free (since1 is trivially square-free).

Therefore, the answer is507 +1=508.

So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{508}
</think>

The problem involves finding the area of a finite region on the plane \(x + y + z = 75\) that satisfies the inequalities \(x - yz < y - zx\) and \(y - zx < z - xy\). 

First, we rewrite the inequalities in terms of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):

1. \(x - yz < y - zx\) simplifies to \((1 + z)(x - y) < 0\).
2. \(y - zx < z - xy\) simplifies to \((1 + x)(y - z) < 0\).

We analyze the regions defined by these inequalities by considering the signs of the factors. We parameterize the plane \(x + y + z = 75\) with \(z = 75 - x - y\) and substitute into the inequalities:

1. \((76 - x - y)(x - y) < 0\)
2. \((1 + x)(x + 2y - 75) < 0\)

We identify three regions based on the signs of the factors. After analyzing each region, we find that only one region is finite. This region is bounded by \(x > -1\), \(x < y < \frac{75 - x}{2}\), and \(x + y < 76\).

To find the area of this finite region, we compute the integral over the region:

\[
A = \int_{-1}^{25} \left( \frac{75 - 3x}{2} \right) \, dx
\]

Evaluating this integral, we find the area to be 507. Expressing this area in the form \(a\sqrt{b}\), we get \(507\sqrt{1}\), where \(a = 507\) and \(b = 1\). Therefore, \(a + b = 508\).

\[
\boxed{508}
\]
