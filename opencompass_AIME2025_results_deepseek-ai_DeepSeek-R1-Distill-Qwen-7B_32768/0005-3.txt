Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of eight-digit integers that use each of the digits 1 through 8 exactly once and are divisible by 22. Then, I have to find the difference between that number, which they're calling N, and 2025. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First off, I know that 22 is equal to 2 multiplied by 11, so if a number is divisible by 22, it must be divisible by both 2 and 11. That means I can tackle this problem by considering the divisibility rules for 2 and 11 separately and then find the numbers that satisfy both conditions.

Starting with divisibility by 2: I remember that a number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. In the digits 1 through 8, the even digits are 2, 4, 6, and 8. So, the last digit of our eight-digit number must be one of these four digits for the number to be divisible by 2.

Now, moving on to divisibility by 11. The rule for 11 is that the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be a multiple of 11, including zero. So, if I denote the positions as 1 to 8, the sum of digits in positions 1, 3, 5, 7 minus the sum of digits in positions 2, 4, 6, 8 should be either 0 or ±11 or ±22, etc. But since we’re dealing with digits 1 through 8, the maximum possible sum for any four digits is 8+7+6+5 = 26, and the minimum is 1+2+3+4 = 10. So, the difference can range from (26 - 10) = 16 down to (10 - 26) = -16. The only multiple of 11 within this range is 0 and 11, but 11 is possible because 26 - 15 = 11, but wait, let me think.

Wait, actually, the difference can be 0, 11, or -11 because 22 is too large since the maximum difference is 16. So, the possible differences are -11, 0, and 11.

But let's calculate the total sum of all digits from 1 to 8. That's (8×9)/2 = 36. If the total sum is 36, then the sum of the digits in the odd positions plus the sum of the digits in the even positions equals 36. Let me denote S_odd as the sum of the digits in odd positions and S_even as the sum in even positions. So, S_odd + S_even = 36, and S_odd - S_even must be divisible by 11. Therefore, S_odd - S_even = 11k where k is an integer. Since S_odd + S_even = 36, we can write S_odd = (36 + 11k)/2 and S_even = (36 - 11k)/2.

Given that both S_odd and S_even must be integers, 36 + 11k must be even, which implies that 11k must be even. But 11 is odd, so k must be even. Let's denote k = 2m, so S_odd - S_even = 22m. But earlier, we saw that the difference can only be 0, 11, or -11. So, 22m must be one of those. Therefore, m can be 0 or ±0.5. But m has to be an integer, so m can only be 0. So, 22m = 0, which means S_odd - S_even = 0. Therefore, S_odd = S_even = 18.

Wait, hold on, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought about the difference being 11 or -11. Let me check:

Wait, total sum is 36, so if S_odd - S_even is 11, then S_odd = (36 + 11)/2 = 47/2 = 23.5, which is not an integer. Similarly, if S_odd - S_even is -11, then S_odd = (36 - 11)/2 = 25/2 = 12.5, which is also not an integer. Therefore, actually, the only possible difference that keeps S_odd and S_even as integers is when S_odd - S_even = 0, giving S_odd = S_even = 18. So, that means the difference must be 0. Therefore, for the number to be divisible by 11, the sum of the digits in the odd positions must equal the sum of the digits in the even positions, each being 18.

So, now, putting it all together: the number must satisfy two conditions:

1. The last digit (which is in an even position, since positions are 1 to 8, so even positions are 2,4,6,8) must be even.

2. The sum of the digits in the odd positions (positions 1,3,5,7) must each add up to 18, and the sum of the digits in the even positions (positions 2,4,6,8) must also add up to 18.

Wait, but hold on: the last digit is in position 8, which is an even position, right? So, position 8 is an even position. So, the last digit being even is condition 1, and the sum of the even positions must be 18. So, in addition to the last digit being even, the other three even positions must sum up to 18 minus the last digit.

Wait, let me clarify:

Total sum is 36.

Sum of even positions is 18.

Sum of odd positions is 18.

But position 8 is an even position, so the sum of the other three even positions (positions 2,4,6) must be 18 minus the last digit (which is in position 8).

So, if the last digit is, say, d, then sum of positions 2,4,6 = 18 - d.

But d is an even digit: 2,4,6,8.

So, 18 - d must be equal to the sum of three distinct digits from 1 to 8, excluding d and the digits in odd positions.

Wait, this might get complicated, but perhaps I can structure it as follows:

First, choose the last digit, which must be even: 2,4,6,8. So, 4 choices.

Then, for each choice of last digit d, the sum of the other three even positions must be 18 - d. Let's denote the sum needed as S = 18 - d.

But S must be equal to the sum of three distinct digits from 1 to 8, excluding d. Also, the digits in the odd positions must sum to 18 as well.

Wait, but we have to make sure that the total sum is 36, so if we fix the last digit, the sum of the other three even digits is 18 - d, and the sum of the odd digits is 18. So, the sum of all digits is 18 (odd) + 18 (even) = 36, which checks out.

So, the key point is, for each even digit d, we need to determine how many ways we can choose three distinct digits (from the remaining seven digits) that sum up to 18 - d, such that the remaining four digits (which would be in the odd positions) also sum up to 18.

But since the sum of the three even digits (excluding the last digit) plus the sum of the four odd digits is 18 - d + 18 = 36 - d, but the total sum is 36, so this seems consistent.

Wait, actually, no: the sum of the three even digits is 18 - d, and the sum of the four odd digits is 18, so total is (18 - d) + 18 = 36 - d. But the total sum of all digits is 36, so we must have d = 0, which is impossible because d is one of 2,4,6,8. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, hold on. I think I made a mistake here. The total sum is 36. If the last digit is d, then the remaining seven digits sum up to 36 - d. These seven digits are split into three even positions (sum 18 - d) and four odd positions (sum 18). So, the sum of the remaining seven digits is (18 - d) + 18 = 36 - d, which matches. So, that is consistent.

Therefore, for each even digit d, the number of ways to choose three digits from the remaining seven digits that sum to 18 - d, and the remaining four digits will automatically sum to 18, which is what we need.

So, for each d in {2,4,6,8}, we need to count the number of triplets of digits from the remaining seven digits that add up to 18 - d.

Therefore, N is equal to the sum over d in {2,4,6,8} of the number of such triplets, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the digits in the odd and even positions.

So, let me formalize this:

For each d in {2,4,6,8}, let T(d) be the number of triplets (a,b,c) where a, b, c are distinct digits from {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} excluding d, such that a + b + c = 18 - d. Then, for each such triplet, the remaining four digits will be in the odd positions, which automatically sum to 18. Then, once we have the triplet and the four digits, we can arrange the three digits in the even positions (excluding the last digit) in 3! ways, and the four digits in the odd positions in 4! ways. So, for each d, the number of such numbers is T(d) × 3! × 4!.

Therefore, N = [T(2) + T(4) + T(6) + T(8)] × 3! × 4!.

So, I need to compute T(2), T(4), T(6), and T(8). Let's compute each one.

First, let's compute T(2):

d = 2, so 18 - d = 16. So, we need triplets from the remaining digits {1,3,4,5,6,7,8} that sum to 16.

How many such triplets are there?

Let me list all possible triplets:

Start with 1:

1, x, y such that x + y = 15. The possible pairs from {3,4,5,6,7,8} that sum to 15: 7+8=15, 6+9=15 but 9 isn't in the set. So, only 7 and 8. So, triplet (1,7,8).

Next, starting with 3:

3, x, y with x + y = 13. Possible pairs in {4,5,6,7,8}:

5+8=13, 6+7=13. So, triplets (3,5,8) and (3,6,7).

Starting with 4:

4, x, y with x + y = 12. Possible pairs in {5,6,7,8}:

5+7=12, 6+6=12 but duplicates not allowed. So, triplet (4,5,7).

Starting with 5:

5, x, y with x + y = 11. Possible pairs in {6,7,8}:

3+8=11 but 3 is already used in starting digit? Wait, no: remaining digits are {1,3,4,5,6,7,8}, but we've already started with 5, so the remaining digits are {1,3,4,6,7,8}. So, looking for x + y = 11. 3+8=11, 4+7=11, 5+6=11 but 5 is already used. So, triplet (5,3,8) but 3 is already in the starting, wait, no: the triplet is (5,3,8) but 3 is already used as a starting digit? Wait, no, in this case, we started with 5, and then we're looking for two other digits. So, 5,3,8 and 5,4,7. But 3 is allowed because it hasn't been used yet in the triplet. Wait, but in the remaining digits, after starting with 5, the remaining digits are {1,3,4,6,7,8}. So, 3 is still available.

So, triplet (5,3,8) and (5,4,7).

But wait, (5,3,8) is the same as (3,5,8) which we already counted. Similarly, (5,4,7) is same as (4,5,7) which we also already counted. So, no new triplets here.

Moving on, starting with 6:

6, x, y with x + y = 10. Possible pairs in {7,8}:

7 + 3=10, but 3 is already used? Wait, no. Wait, remaining digits after starting with 6 are {1,3,4,5,7,8}. So, looking for x + y = 10. Possible pairs: 2+8=10 (but 2 is used as d=2), 3+7=10, 4+6=10 (6 is already used as starting), 5+5=10 (duplicate). So, only triplet (6,3,7). But 3 is in the remaining digits, so yes, triplet (6,3,7). But we already have (3,6,7) earlier.

Similarly, starting with 7:

7, x, y with x + y = 9. Possible pairs in {1,3,4,5,6,8}:

1+8=9, 3+6=9, 4+5=9. So, triplets (7,1,8), (7,3,6), (7,4,5).

But (7,1,8) is same as (1,7,8) which we already have.

(7,3,6) is same as (3,6,7) which we have.

(7,4,5) is same as (4,5,7) which we have.

Starting with 8:

8, x, y with x + y = 8. Possible pairs in {1,3,4,5,6,7}:

1+7=8, 3+5=8, 4+4=8 (duplicate). So, triplets (8,1,7), (8,3,5).

But (8,1,7) is same as (1,7,8) which we have.

(8,3,5) is same as (3,5,8) which we have.

So, in total, the unique triplets for d=2 are:

(1,7,8), (3,5,8), (3,6,7), (4,5,7).

So, T(2) = 4.

Wait, let me count them:

1. (1,7,8)
2. (3,5,8)
3. (3,6,7)
4. (4,5,7)

Yes, that's four triplets. So, T(2) = 4.

Now, moving on to T(4):

d = 4, so 18 - 4 = 14. We need triplets from remaining digits {1,2,3,5,6,7,8} that sum to 14.

Let me find all such triplets.

Start with 1:

1, x, y with x + y = 13. Possible pairs in {2,3,5,6,7,8}:

5+8=13, 6+7=13. So, triplets (1,5,8), (1,6,7).

Starting with 2:

2, x, y with x + y = 12. Possible pairs in {3,5,6,7,8}:

4+8=12 but 4 is used as d=4. 5+7=12, 6+6=12 (duplicate). So, triplet (2,5,7).

Starting with 3:

3, x, y with x + y = 11. Possible pairs in {2,5,6,7,8}:

3+8=11, but 3 is starting. So, x + y = 11: 2+9=11 (invalid), 3+8=11, 4+7=11 (4 is used), 5+6=11. So, triplet (3,5,6) and (3,2,9) but 9 isn't there. So, only (3,5,6).

Wait, starting with 3, the remaining digits are {2,5,6,7,8}. So, 3 + 5 + 6 = 14? Wait, no: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14? 3+5=8, 8+6=14? Wait, 3+5+6=14. Yes, so triplet (3,5,6).

But 3,5,6: 3 is starting, 5 and 6 are remaining. So, that's a valid triplet.

Starting with 5:

5, x, y with x + y = 9. Possible pairs in {2,3,6,7,8}:

1+8=9, 2+7=9, 3+6=9, 4+5=9 (4 is used). So, triplet (5,2,7), (5,3,6).

But (5,2,7) is same as (2,5,7) which we have.

(5,3,6) is same as (3,5,6) which we have.

Starting with 6:

6, x, y with x + y = 8. Possible pairs in {2,3,5,7,8}:

1+7=8 (1 is used?), wait remaining digits: {2,3,5,7,8}. So, 1 isn't in here. So, 2+6=8, but 6 is starting. So, 2+6=8, but 6 is already used. 3+5=8. So, triplet (6,3,5), but that's same as (3,5,6).

Starting with 7:

7, x, y with x + y = 7. Possible pairs in {2,3,5,6,8}:

1+6=7, 2+5=7, 3+4=7 (4 is used). So, triplet (7,2,5) and (7,3,4). But 4 is used, so only (7,2,5), which is same as (2,5,7).

Starting with 8:

8, x, y with x + y = 6. Possible pairs in {2,3,5,6,7}:

1+5=6, 2+4=6 (4 is used), 3+3=6 (duplicate). So, triplet (8,1,5) but 1 is not in remaining digits. Wait, no: starting with 8, remaining digits are {2,3,5,6,7}. So, looking for x + y = 6: 2+4=6 (4 is used), 3+3=6 (duplicate). So, no triplet here.

So, compiling all unique triplets for d=4:

1. (1,5,8)
2. (1,6,7)
3. (2,5,7)
4. (3,5,6)

So, T(4) = 4.

Moving on to T(6):

d = 6, so 18 - 6 = 12. We need triplets from the remaining digits {1,2,3,4,5,7,8} that sum to 12.

Let me find these triplets.

Start with 1:

1, x, y with x + y = 11. Possible pairs in {2,3,4,5,7,8}:

3+8=11, 4+7=11, 5+6=11 (6 is used). So, triplets (1,3,8), (1,4,7).

Starting with 2:

2, x, y with x + y = 10. Possible pairs in {3,4,5,7,8}:

2+8=10, but 2 is starting. So, looking for x + y =10: 3+7=10, 4+6=10 (6 is used), 5+5=10 (duplicate). So, triplet (2,3,7).

Starting with 3:

3, x, y with x + y = 9. Possible pairs in {2,4,5,7,8}:

2+7=9, 4+5=9. So, triplet (3,2,7), (3,4,5).

But (3,2,7) is same as (2,3,7) which we have.

(3,4,5) is a new triplet.

Starting with 4:

4, x, y with x + y = 8. Possible pairs in {2,3,5,7,8}:

1+7=8 (1 is not in remaining digits), 2+6=8 (6 is used), 3+5=8. So, triplet (4,3,5).

But (4,3,5) is same as (3,4,5) which we have.

Starting with 5:

5, x, y with x + y = 7. Possible pairs in {2,3,4,7,8}:

2+5=7 (5 is starting), 3+4=7. So, triplet (5,3,4) which is same as (3,4,5).

Starting with 7:

7, x, y with x + y = 5. Possible pairs in {2,3,4,5,8}: 2+3=5. So, triplet (7,2,3) which is same as (2,3,7).

Starting with 8:

8, x, y with x + y = 4. Possible pairs in {2,3,4,5,7}: 2+2=4 (duplicate). So, no triplet here.

So, compiling all unique triplets for d=6:

1. (1,3,8)
2. (1,4,7)
3. (2,3,7)
4. (3,4,5)

So, T(6) = 4.

Now, moving on to T(8):

d = 8, so 18 - 8 = 10. We need triplets from the remaining digits {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} that sum to 10.

Let me find these triplets.

Start with 1:

1, x, y with x + y = 9. Possible pairs in {2,3,4,5,6,7}:

2+7=9, 3+6=9, 4+5=9. So, triplets (1,2,7), (1,3,6), (1,4,5).

Starting with 2:

2, x, y with x + y = 8. Possible pairs in {3,4,5,6,7}:

1+7=8 (1 is not in remaining digits), 2+6=8 (2 is starting), 3+5=8, 4+4=8 (duplicate). So, triplet (2,3,5).

Starting with 3:

3, x, y with x + y =7. Possible pairs in {2,4,5,6,7}:

1+6=7 (1 is not there), 2+5=7, 3+4=7 (3 is starting). So, triplet (3,2,5) which is same as (2,3,5).

Starting with 4:

4, x, y with x + y =6. Possible pairs in {2,3,5,6,7}:

1+5=6 (1 not there), 2+4=6 (4 is starting), 3+3=6 (duplicate). So, no triplet here.

Starting with 5:

5, x, y with x + y =5. Possible pairs in {2,3,4,6,7}: 2+3=5. So, triplet (5,2,3) which is same as (2,3,5).

Starting with 6:

6, x, y with x + y =4. Possible pairs in {2,3,4,5,7}: 2+2=4 (duplicate). So, no triplet here.

Starting with 7:

7, x, y with x + y =3. Possible pairs in {2,3,4,5,6}: 1+2=3 (1 not there). So, no triplet here.

So, compiling all unique triplets for d=8:

1. (1,2,7)
2. (1,3,6)
3. (1,4,5)
4. (2,3,5)

So, T(8) = 4.

Therefore, for each d in {2,4,6,8}, T(d) = 4. So, total number of such triplets is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16.

But wait, hold on. Is that correct? Each T(d) is 4, so 4 d's give 4 × 4 = 16 triplets. But let me verify:

For d=2: 4 triplets.

d=4: 4 triplets.

d=6: 4 triplets.

d=8: 4 triplets.

Total triplets: 16. So, T = 16.

Therefore, the number of such numbers N is 16 × 3! × 4!.

Wait, because for each triplet, we can arrange the three digits in the even positions (positions 2,4,6,8) which are three positions, so 3! ways, and the four digits in the odd positions can be arranged in 4! ways.

So, N = 16 × 6 × 24.

Calculate that: 16 × 6 = 96, 96 × 24. Let me compute 96 × 24:

24 × 96:

24 × 90 = 2160,

24 × 6 = 144,

So, 2160 + 144 = 2304.

Wait, so N = 2304.

But hold on, the total number of eight-digit numbers using 1-8 exactly once is 8! = 40320.

So, N = 2304.

Then, the problem asks for the difference between N and 2025. So, 2304 - 2025.

Compute 2304 - 2025:

2304 - 2000 = 304,

304 - 25 = 279.

So, 2304 - 2025 = 279.

Therefore, the difference is 279.

Wait, but let me just double-check my calculations because 2304 seems a bit high.

Wait, so N is 16 × 6 × 24 = 16 × 144 = 2304. That seems correct.

But 2025 is a round number, so the difference is 279. Hmm.

But just to make sure, maybe I made a mistake in calculating T(d). Let me verify each T(d):

For d=2, T(2)=4: triplets were (1,7,8), (3,5,8), (3,6,7), (4,5,7). That's four.

For d=4, T(4)=4: (1,5,8), (1,6,7), (2,5,7), (3,5,6). Four.

For d=6, T(6)=4: (1,3,8), (1,4,7), (2,3,7), (3,4,5). Four.

For d=8, T(8)=4: (1,2,7), (1,3,6), (1,4,5), (2,3,5). Four.

Yes, each T(d)=4, so 16 in total.

Therefore, N=16×6×24=2304.

2304 - 2025 = 279.

Wait, that's correct.

But just to make sure, is 2304 the correct number of such numbers?

Wait, another way to think about it is: the total number of numbers divisible by 11 is N, and numbers divisible by 2 is 8! / 2 = 20160, since half of the numbers are even. But we are looking for numbers divisible by both 2 and 11, so it's N = numbers divisible by 22.

But wait, 22 is 2 × 11, and since 2 and 11 are coprime, the number of numbers divisible by 22 is equal to the number of numbers divisible by both 2 and 11.

In general, for permutations, the probability that a random permutation is divisible by 11 is roughly 1/11, so N ≈ 8! / 11 ≈ 40320 / 11 ≈ 3665.45. But our N is 2304, which is less than that. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe my approach is wrong. Because in fact, the total number of permutations is 8! = 40320.

The number of permutations where the last digit is even is 4 × 7! = 20160.

Now, among these 20160 numbers, how many are divisible by 11.

But 11 is co-prime to 2, so the divisibility by 11 is independent of the last digit. Therefore, the probability that a number is divisible by 11 is 1/11, so the expected number is 20160 / 11 ≈ 1832.727.

But wait, that's conflicting with my previous result of 2304.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, maybe my initial reasoning is wrong.

Wait, let me clarify.

The total number of numbers with last digit even is 4 × 7! = 20160.

Within these, the number of numbers divisible by 11 is equal to the number of such numbers where the sum of odd positions minus sum of even positions is 0. So, perhaps it's 20160 / 11 ≈ 1832.727, but since the number must be integer, it's either 1832 or 1833.

But in our previous calculation, we got 2304, which is higher.

So, that suggests that my initial reasoning might be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that all T(d) are equal to 4. Maybe not. Let me think again.

In the case of d=8, we have T(8)=4. But is that correct?

Wait, for d=8, triplets that sum to 10: (1,2,7), (1,3,6), (1,4,5), (2,3,5). Four triplets.

Similarly, for d=2, triplets summing to 16: (1,7,8), (3,5,8), (3,6,7), (4,5,7). Four triplets.

Same for d=4 and d=6: four triplets each.

So, that seems correct.

Wait, but why the discrepancy between 2304 and 20160 / 11 ≈ 1832.727?

Wait, perhaps because the divisibility by 11 is not uniform among the even numbers, especially since the last digit is fixed as even.

Wait, no, actually, the divisibility by 11 is independent of the last digit, right? So, the ratio should still hold.

But 2304 / 20160 = 2304 / 20160 ≈ 0.1142857, which is approximately 1/8.75. Not 1/11. So, something's wrong here.

Wait, 2304 / 40320 ≈ 0.057142857, which is approximately 1/17.5, which is still not 1/11.

So, that suggests that my earlier approach is flawed.

Wait, so maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps, the error is in assuming that for each d, the number of triplets is 4. Maybe the number of triplets is not the same for each d.

Wait, let me check for d=8 again.

Wait, when d=8, the remaining digits are {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}.

We need triplets that sum to 10. So, possible triplets:

(1,2,7), (1,3,6), (1,4,5), (2,3,5). So, four triplets. So, that's correct.

Similarly, for d=2, triplets summing to 16: {1,3,4,5,6,7,8}. So, triplets summing to 16:

(1,7,8), (3,5,8), (3,6,7), (4,5,7). So, four triplets. Correct.

Similarly, for d=4, triplets summing to 12:

(1,5,6), (1,5,7), (1,5,8), etc., but wait no, for d=4, triplets sum to 12. Let me re-examine:

Wait, d=4, so remaining digits are {1,2,3,5,6,7,8}.

Looking for triplets summing to 12.

(1,3,8), (1,4,7), (1,5,6), (2,3,7), (2,4,6), (3,4,5). Wait, I thought earlier it was four triplets, but now I see more.

Wait, so perhaps my initial count was wrong. For d=4, triplets summing to 12:

1. (1,3,8)
2. (1,4,7)
3. (1,5,6)
4. (2,3,7)
5. (2,4,6)
6. (3,4,5)

So, actually, six triplets, not four.

Wait, that's different from before. Did I miss something earlier?

Wait, let's go through it methodically.

Starting with 1:

1, x, y with x + y = 11. Possible pairs: (3,8), (4,7), (5,6). So, triplets (1,3,8), (1,4,7), (1,5,6).

Starting with 2:

2, x, y with x + y = 10. Possible pairs: (3,7), (4,6). So, triplets (2,3,7), (2,4,6).

Starting with 3:

3, x, y with x + y =9. Possible pairs: (4,5). So, triplet (3,4,5).

So, total triplets: 3 (starting with 1) + 2 (starting with 2) + 1 (starting with 3) = 6 triplets. So, T(4)=6.

Similarly, for d=6, we had T(6)=4, but let me check again.

For d=6, remaining digits {1,2,3,4,5,7,8}, need triplets summing to 12.

Starting with 1:

1, x, y with x + y =11: (2,9) invalid, (3,8), (4,7), (5,6). But 6 is used, so (3,8), (4,7). So, triplets (1,3,8), (1,4,7).

Starting with 2:

2, x, y with x + y =10: (3,7), (4,6) (6 is used), so (3,7). Triplet (2,3,7).

Starting with 3:

3, x, y with x + y =9: (4,5). Triplet (3,4,5).

Starting with 4:

4, x, y with x + y =8: (3,5). Triplet (4,3,5) same as (3,4,5).

So, triplets: (1,3,8), (1,4,7), (2,3,7), (3,4,5). So, four triplets. Therefore, T(6)=4.

Wait, so for d=4, we have six triplets, but for d=6, only four.

Similarly, for d=2, T(2)=4? Wait, let me check.

For d=2, remaining digits {1,3,4,5,6,7,8}, need triplets summing to 16.

Possible triplets:

1,7,8

3,5,8

3,6,7

4,5,7

Wait, is that all?

Starting with 1:

1, x, y with x + y =15: 7+8=15. So, triplet (1,7,8).

Starting with 3:

3, x, y with x + y =13: 5+8=13, 6+7=13. So, triplets (3,5,8), (3,6,7).

Starting with 4:

4, x, y with x + y =12: 5+7=12. So, triplet (4,5,7).

So, total triplets: (1,7,8), (3,5,8), (3,6,7), (4,5,7). So, four triplets. So, T(2)=4.

Similarly, for d=8, T(8)=4.

But for d=4, T(4)=6.

So, that changes things. So, T(d) is not equal for all d.

So, T(2)=4, T(4)=6, T(6)=4, T(8)=4.

Therefore, total T=4+6+4+4=18.

Therefore, N=18 × 6 × 24=18×144=2592.

Therefore, N=2592.

Wait, so my previous calculation was wrong because I had miscalculated T(4)=6 instead of 4. So, that changes the total.

Therefore, N=2592.

So, N=2592, the difference between N and 2025 is 2592 - 2025 = 567.

But wait, let's compute that: 2592 - 2000 = 592, 592 -25=567.

So, the difference is 567.

But now, let me make sure.

Wait, let me think about this again. For d=4, we had six triplets, correct? So, 18 triplets total.

Each triplet can be arranged in 3! ways in the even positions, and the remaining four digits can be arranged in 4! ways in the odd positions.

So, N=18×6×24=18×144=2592.

But let's test if this is consistent with the divisibility by 11.

Total numbers divisible by 11: total permutations / 11 = 40320 / 11 ≈ 3665.45. So, not exactly 3665.45, but maybe 3665 or 3666.

But in our case, we have 2592 numbers that are divisible by 22, which is 2 × 11.

But 2592 is roughly 2592 / 40320 ≈ 0.0644 or 6.44%. 1/11 is approximately 9.09%. So, it's still lower than expected.

Wait, perhaps is it because the last digit is fixed as even, so perhaps the probability of divisibility by 11 is 1/11 as usual? But with the last digit fixed, so maybe not.

Wait, actually, the sum of the digits is fixed at 36, so the difference between the sums of the odd and even positions is zero. So, actually, the sum of the digits in odd positions is 18, same as even positions. So, the difference is zero, which is divisible by 11.

But wait, that's always the case? Because the total sum is 36, so S_odd + S_even = 36, and S_odd - S_even = 0.

Therefore, 2*S_odd = 36 ⇒ S_odd=18. So, regardless of the permutation, as long as the last digit is even, the difference is zero. So, all such numbers are divisible by 11. Wait, that's a key point.

Wait, hold on. If the last digit is even, and the sum of digits is 36, then S_odd = S_even = 18. Therefore, the difference S_odd - S_even = 0, which is divisible by 11. Therefore, all such numbers are divisible by 11.

Wait, that's a game-changer.

So, if that's the case, then all numbers that use each digit 1-8 exactly once, ending with an even digit, are automatically divisible by 11.

Therefore, N is equal to the number of such numbers, which is 4 × 7! = 20160.

Therefore, N=20160.

Then, the difference between N and 2025 is 20160 - 2025 = 18135.

Wait, that's a different result altogether. So, which is correct?

Wait, if the last digit is even, and the total sum is 36, which is fixed, then S_odd + S_even = 36, and S_odd - S_even = 0. So, regardless of the permutation, as long as the last digit is even, the difference is zero, so the number is divisible by 11.

Therefore, N is just equal to the number of such numbers where the last digit is even, which is 4 × 7! = 20160.

Therefore, N=20160, and 20160 - 2025 = 18135.

But then, why did I go through all that triplet counting earlier?

Wait, because I thought that only some of them are divisible by 11, but actually, all of them are.

So, that changes everything.

So, the correct N is 20160, so the difference is 20160 - 2025 = 18135.

But wait, let me confirm with the problem statement: "the number of these integers that are divisible by 22."

But if all numbers ending with even digits are divisible by 22, because they are divisible by both 2 and 11, then N is 20160.

Therefore, the difference is 20160 - 2025 = 18135.

But that seems too straightforward, which makes me think that perhaps my earlier approach was wrong.

Wait, but let me check the logic:

Given that the sum of all digits is 36, which is fixed.

A number is divisible by 11 if and only if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11 (including zero).

In this case, if the last digit is even, then the number is divisible by 2, and the difference S_odd - S_even must be a multiple of 11. But since S_odd + S_even = 36, we can write:

Let S_odd = a, S_even = b.

Then, a + b = 36,

and a - b = 11k, where k is an integer.

Adding these two equations:

2a = 36 + 11k ⇒ a = 18 + (11k)/2.

Since a must be an integer, (11k)/2 must be integer. Therefore, k must be even.

Let k = 2m, then a = 18 + 11m.

Possible values for m:

Since S_odd must be between 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 and 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26.

So, 10 ≤ a ≤ 26.

So, 10 ≤ 18 + 11m ≤ 26.

Subtract 18: -8 ≤ 11m ≤ 8.

Divide by 11: -8/11 ≈ -0.727 ≤ m ≤ 8/11 ≈ 0.727.

Since m must be integer, m=0.

Therefore, a = 18 + 0 = 18.

Therefore, S_odd = 18, S_even = 18.

Therefore, regardless of the permutation, as long as the last digit is even, the number is divisible by 11.

Hence, all such numbers are divisible by 11.

Therefore, N is equal to the number of such numbers, which is 4 × 7! = 20160.

Therefore, N=20160.

Therefore, the difference between N and 2025 is 20160 - 2025 = 18135.

Therefore, the answer is 18135.

But then, that seems straightforward, so why did I go through the triplet counting earlier? Because I thought that only some of them are divisible by 11, but actually, all of them are because the total sum is fixed.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose the last digit is even, so the number is even. Then, the difference S_odd - S_even must be a multiple of 11. But since S_odd + S_even = 36, and S_odd - S_even must be 0 mod 11.

But from the equation above, the only possible value is 0, because a = 18, b = 18.

Hence, regardless of the permutation, as long as the last digit is even, the difference is 0, hence divisible by 11.

Therefore, N is indeed 20160.

Therefore, the difference is 20160 - 2025 = 18135.

So, that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{18135}
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find the number of eight-digit integers using each digit from 1 to 8 exactly once that are divisible by 22. We then need to find the difference between this number and 2025.

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in an even digit. The even digits available are 2, 4, 6, and 8.
2. **Divisibility by 11**: The difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be a multiple of 11. Given the total sum of all digits is 36, the sums of the digits in the odd and even positions must each be 18.

Since the total sum of the digits is 36, which is fixed, the difference between the sums of the digits in the odd and even positions is zero. This means that all numbers ending in an even digit will automatically satisfy the divisibility rule for 11.

3. **Counting the numbers**: The number of such permutations is calculated by fixing the last digit as an even digit and permuting the remaining digits. There are 4 choices for the last digit (2, 4, 6, 8) and 7! ways to arrange the remaining digits.

Thus, the number of valid permutations is:
\[ 4 \times 7! = 4 \times 5040 = 20160 \]

4. **Finding the difference**: Subtract 2025 from the number of valid permutations:
\[ 20160 - 2025 = 18135 \]

Therefore, the difference between \( N \) and 2025 is:
\[
\boxed{18135}
\]
