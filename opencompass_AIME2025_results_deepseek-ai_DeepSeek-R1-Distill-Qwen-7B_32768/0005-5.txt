Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of eight-digit integers that use each of the digits 1 through 8 exactly once and are divisible by 22. Then, I have to find the difference between that number, N, and 2025. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a number divisible by 22 must be divisible by both 2 and 11 because 22 is the product of these two primes. So, I need to figure out how many eight-digit numbers made from the digits 1-8 without repetition are divisible by both 2 and 11.

Starting with divisibility by 2: For a number to be divisible by 2, its last digit must be even. The digits we have are 1 through 8, so the even digits are 2, 4, 6, and 8. That means the last digit has to be one of these four. So, for the last digit, I have 4 choices.

Now, moving on to divisibility by 11. I remember the rule for divisibility by 11 is that the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be a multiple of 11, including zero. So, I need to calculate this difference and ensure it's a multiple of 11.

Since we're dealing with an eight-digit number, the positions are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th. The odd positions are 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th, and the even positions are 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th.

Let me denote the sum of the digits in the odd positions as S_odd and the sum of the digits in the even positions as S_even. Then, the condition is that S_odd - S_even ≡ 0 mod 11.

But wait, let me think about the total sum of all digits. The digits are 1 through 8, so the total sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36. Therefore, S_odd + S_even = 36.

So, if I have S_odd - S_even ≡ 0 mod 11, and S_odd + S_even = 36, I can set up these two equations:

1. S_odd - S_even ≡ 0 mod 11
2. S_odd + S_even = 36

Let me solve for S_odd and S_even. From equation 1, S_odd ≡ S_even mod 11. From equation 2, S_odd = 36 - S_even.

Substituting into equation 1: (36 - S_even) - S_even ≡ 0 mod 11 => 36 - 2*S_even ≡ 0 mod 11.

So, 36 ≡ 2*S_even mod 11. Let me compute 36 mod 11 first. 11*3=33, so 36-33=3. So, 36 ≡ 3 mod 11.

Therefore, 3 ≡ 2*S_even mod 11. So, we have 2*S_even ≡ 3 mod 11.

To solve for S_even, I can multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 2 mod 11. The inverse of 2 mod 11 is 6 because 2*6=12 ≡ 1 mod 11.

So, multiplying both sides by 6: S_even ≡ 3*6 ≡ 18 ≡ 7 mod 11.

Therefore, S_even ≡ 7 mod 11. So, S_even can be 7, 18, 29, etc., but since S_even is the sum of four distinct digits from 1 to 8, let me find the possible values of S_even.

What is the minimum possible sum for four digits? That would be 1+2+3+4=10. The maximum possible sum would be 5+6+7+8=26. So, S_even can be between 10 and 26. Since S_even ≡7 mod 11, the possible values are 7, 18, 29. But 7 is below 10, so only 18 and 29. But 29 is above 26, so only 18 is possible.

Therefore, S_even must be 18. So, S_odd = 36 - 18 = 18 as well.

Wait, so both S_odd and S_even have to be 18? Interesting. So, the sum of the digits in the odd positions must be 18, and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be 18.

So, now, the problem reduces to finding the number of permutations of digits 1-8 such that:

1. The last digit (position 8, which is an even position) is even (2,4,6,8).
2. The sum of digits in positions 2,4,6,8 is 18.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the number of such permutations by first choosing the last digit, then selecting the other three even-position digits such that their sum, along with the last digit, is 18.

Wait, no, because the sum of the even positions is 18, and the last digit is one of 2,4,6,8. So, the sum of the other three even-position digits plus the last digit must be 18. So, if I denote the last digit as d, then the sum of the remaining three even digits is 18 - d.

So, for each possible d (which is even: 2,4,6,8), I need to find the number of ways to choose three distinct digits from the remaining seven digits (since d is already used as the last digit), such that their sum is 18 - d. Then, for each such set, we can arrange the digits in the odd positions and the remaining even positions.

Wait, maybe I should structure this step by step:

1. The last digit is even: 4 choices (2,4,6,8).
2. For each such last digit, the sum of the remaining three even digits must be 18 - d.
3. For each d, find the number of triplets from the remaining digits (excluding d) that sum to 18 - d.
4. For each such triplet, arrange the three digits in the remaining even positions (positions 2,4,6) and the four digits in the odd positions (positions 1,3,5,7).

But wait, actually, once we choose the four even digits (including the last digit), the three other even digits are chosen, and then the odd positions are filled with the remaining four digits.

But let me think again.

Wait, actually, the total digits are 8: four even digits (2,4,6,8) and four odd digits (1,3,5,7). So, in the even positions (positions 2,4,6,8), we need to have four digits whose total sum is 18, and the odd positions will have the remaining four digits, whose sum will also be 18 since 36 - 18 = 18.

Therefore, regardless of the last digit, the sum of the even digits is 18, so the last digit is part of those even digits. Therefore, the rest of the even digits (positions 2,4,6) must sum to 18 minus the last digit.

Therefore, for each possible last digit d (even digits: 2,4,6,8), the sum of the other three even digits is 18 - d.

So, for each d:

- d = 2: sum needed for the other three even digits: 18 - 2 = 16
- d = 4: sum needed: 18 - 4 = 14
- d = 6: sum needed: 18 - 6 = 12
- d = 8: sum needed: 18 - 8 = 10

So, for each d, we need to find the number of triplets from the remaining seven digits (excluding d) that sum to the required value.

But let's note that the remaining digits for the even positions are from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} excluding d. But since d is already used in the last position, we have seven digits left.

Wait, actually, no: the even digits are four in total: 2,4,6,8. So, if d is one of them, the other three even digits must be selected from the remaining three even digits (since d is fixed as the last digit). Wait, hold on, this seems conflicting.

Wait, no, the even digits are 2,4,6,8. So, if we fix d as the last digit, the remaining three even digits must come from the other three even digits. But wait, that's only three digits, but we need three digits to sum to 18 - d.

But wait, if d is fixed as, say, 2, then the other three even digits are 4,6,8, which sum to 18. But 18 - 2 = 16, so we need three even digits (excluding d) that sum to 16. But 4 + 6 + 8 = 18, which is more than 16.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here.

Let me clarify: the even digits are 2,4,6,8. If we fix d as one of them, say d=2, then the remaining three even digits must come from {4,6,8}, but they must sum to 16. However, 4 + 6 + 8 = 18, which is higher than 16.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if d=2, the required sum is 16, but the remaining three even digits must sum to 16, but the only other even digits are 4,6,8, which sum to 18. So, 18 ≠ 16.

Wait, that suggests that perhaps when d=2, there are no possible triplets of the remaining even digits that can sum to 16. Similarly, let's check for other d:

For d=4: required sum is 14. The remaining even digits are 2,6,8, which sum to 16. Again, 16 ≠14.

d=6: required sum is 12. The remaining even digits are 2,4,8, which sum to 14. 14 ≠12.

d=8: required sum is10. The remaining even digits are 2,4,6, which sum to12. 12≠10.

Wait, so none of the d's seem to satisfy the required sum for the other three even digits. But that can't be, because the total sum of even digits is 2+4+6+8=20. So, if S_even=18, then S_odd=18 as well. So, the even digits must sum to 18, so if d is fixed, the remaining three even digits must sum to 18 - d. But when we fix d as 2,4,6,8, the remaining even digits are three, but their sum is 20 - d, right?

Wait, hold on: total even digits sum is 2+4+6+8=20. So, if we fix d as one of them, the remaining three even digits sum to 20 - d.

But we need S_even =18, which is the sum of all four even digits (positions 2,4,6,8). So, 20 - d =18? No, that would imply d=2, but 20 -2=18.

Wait, hold on, maybe I confused something.

Wait, S_even is the sum of the four even digits, regardless of which position they are in. So, regardless of where the digits are placed, the four even digits (2,4,6,8) have a fixed sum of 20. But earlier, I thought S_even had to be 18 because S_odd=18 and S_even=18, so S_odd + S_even=36. But 18+18=36, which is correct, but 20≠18.

Wait, this is a contradiction. So, my earlier reasoning must be flawed.

Wait, let's go back. S_odd + S_even=36.

If the four even digits sum to 20, then S_even=20. Therefore, S_odd=36 -20=16.

But earlier, I had S_even=18, which is incorrect. So, this was my mistake.

So, correcting myself: S_even is the sum of the even digits, which are 2,4,6,8, so S_even=2+4+6+8=20. Therefore, S_odd=36 -20=16.

Wait, so S_odd must be 16, not 18. Therefore, my earlier conclusion that S_even=18 was wrong. It should be S_odd=16.

So, that changes things. I need to have the sum of the digits in the odd positions (positions 1,3,5,7) to be 16, and the sum of the even positions (positions 2,4,6,8) is 20.

Therefore, the digits in the odd positions must sum to 16, and the digits in the even positions must sum to 20.

But wait, the even digits are fixed as 2,4,6,8, which sum to 20. So, positions 2,4,6,8 must contain 2,4,6,8 in some order, so their sum is automatically 20. Therefore, the sum of the digits in the even positions is fixed at 20, so the sum of the digits in the odd positions must be 16. Therefore, the digits in the odd positions must be the remaining four digits, which are 1,3,5,7, because 1+3+5+7=16.

Wait, that's perfect! So, the odd positions must contain digits 1,3,5,7 in some order, and the even positions must contain digits 2,4,6,8 in some order.

Therefore, the total number of such permutations is equal to the number of ways to arrange the four odd digits (1,3,5,7) in the four odd positions and the four even digits (2,4,6,8) in the four even positions.

Thus, the number of such numbers is 4! (for the odd digits) multiplied by 4! (for the even digits). So, 4! *4! =24*24=576.

But wait, but the problem says the number is eight-digit, using digits 1-8 exactly once, and divisible by 22. But 576 is the number of such numbers where the odd digits are 1,3,5,7 and even digits are 2,4,6,8.

But wait, but we also need divisibility by 22, which requires divisibility by 2 and 11. Divisibility by 2 is already satisfied because the last digit is even (positions 2,4,6,8). But we also have to ensure divisibility by 11.

Wait, so my initial reasoning was incorrect because I thought of the sum of even positions as 18, but actually, it's 20, which is fixed. So, the sum of the odd positions must be 16, which is fixed as well.

But wait, so if the sum of the odd positions is 16, and the sum of the even positions is 20, then the difference between them is 4, which is 20 -16=4, but for divisibility by 11, we need the difference to be a multiple of 11, including zero.

4 is not a multiple of 11, so actually, none of these numbers satisfy divisibility by 11. But that can't be, because the problem is asking for N, the number of such integers that are divisible by 22.

Wait, so perhaps I made a wrong turn here. Let me reassess.

Wait, no, the sum of the digits in the odd positions is 16, and the sum in the even positions is 20. So, the difference is 4, which is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, none of these numbers satisfy the divisibility by 11 condition.

But that seems contradictory because the problem is asking for N, which must be some number, not zero.

Wait, so where is the mistake?

Let me go back.

Total sum: 36.

Sum of even digits (positions 2,4,6,8): 2+4+6+8=20.

Sum of odd digits (positions 1,3,5,7): 1+3+5+7=16.

Therefore, S_odd - S_even =16 -20= -4. The absolute difference is 4.

But for divisibility by 11, the difference must be a multiple of 11. So, 4 is not a multiple of 11, so such numbers are not divisible by 11, hence not divisible by 22.

But that can't be, because the problem is asking for N, which should be positive. So, is my reasoning wrong?

Wait, perhaps I confused S_odd and S_even. Let me check the divisibility rule again.

The rule is that the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be a multiple of 11, including zero.

So, S_odd - S_even ≡0 mod11.

In our case, S_odd=16, S_even=20.

16 -20= -4≡7 mod11, which is not 0. So, the difference is 7 mod11, which is not 0. Therefore, such numbers are not divisible by 11.

But wait, that seems like a problem because the question is asking for numbers divisible by 22, so N should be the number of such numbers where S_odd - S_even is 0 mod11.

But according to my reasoning, S_odd is fixed at 16, S_even is fixed at 20, so the difference is fixed at -4, which is 7 mod11, not 0. Therefore, none of these numbers are divisible by 11, hence N=0.

But that can't be, because 8! is 40320, and N is a positive number. So, maybe my initial assumption that S_odd is fixed is wrong.

Wait, no, the digits 1,3,5,7 are fixed in the odd positions, so their sum is fixed at16, and 2,4,6,8 are fixed in the even positions, sum at20. Therefore, the difference is fixed, which is -4.

Therefore, none of these permutations satisfy the divisibility by 11. Thus, N=0.

But the problem says "the number of these integers that are divisible by 22", so N=0? Then, 2025 -0=2025.

But that seems counterintuitive because 22 is a reasonable modulus, so perhaps there are some numbers that satisfy the condition.

Wait, maybe I was wrong in assuming that the digits in the odd and even positions are fixed as 1,3,5,7 and 2,4,6,8 respectively.

Wait, no, actually, the digits in the odd positions can be any four digits, not necessarily 1,3,5,7. Similarly, the even positions can have any four digits, not necessarily 2,4,6,8.

Wait, that's a key point. Because in the initial reasoning, I assumed that the even digits must be 2,4,6,8 because they are the only even digits, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, no, the even digits are 2,4,6,8, so if we're using all digits 1-8, then the even digits must be 2,4,6,8, and the odd digits must be 1,3,5,7.

Wait, that's correct, because 1-8 are all distinct, so the four even digits must be 2,4,6,8 and the four odd digits must be 1,3,5,7. Therefore, the sum of the even digits is fixed at20, and the sum of the odd digits is fixed at16, which gives a difference of -4, not 0 mod11. Therefore, such numbers cannot satisfy the divisibility by11.

Therefore, N=0.

But that seems strange because the problem is asking for N and the difference. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, another way: Let me consider that a number is divisible by 22 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11.

We already know that to be divisible by 2, the last digit must be even.

For divisibility by11, the difference between the sum of the digits in odd positions and the sum of digits in even positions must be a multiple of11, including zero.

So, let me denote S_odd as the sum of digits in odd positions and S_even as the sum of digits in even positions.

We have S_odd - S_even ≡0 mod11.

But since the total sum is36, we have S_odd + S_even=36.

Thus, S_odd - S_even ≡0 mod11.

So, adding these two equations:

2*S_odd ≡36 mod11.

36 mod11 is3, as 11*3=33, 36-33=3.

Therefore, 2*S_odd ≡3 mod11.

So, S_odd ≡ (3)*(2^{-1}) mod11.

Since 2^{-1} is6, as 2*6=12≡1 mod11.

Therefore, S_odd ≡3*6=18≡7 mod11.

So, S_odd≡7 mod11.

Similarly, since S_odd + S_even=36, we can find S_even≡36 -7=29≡7 mod11 as well.

Therefore, both S_odd and S_even must be congruent to7 mod11.

So, the sum of the digits in the odd positions must be7 mod11, and the sum of the digits in the even positions must also be7 mod11.

But S_odd and S_even are sums of four distinct digits from1-8.

So, let me compute all possible sums of four digits from1-8 and see which are congruent to7 mod11.

Total sum is36, so S_odd can be from1+2+3+4=10 to5+6+7+8=26.

So, possible sums S_odd:10,11,12,...,26.

Which of these are≡7 mod11?

Compute 10 mod11=10,

11≡0,

12≡1,

13≡2,

14≡3,

15≡4,

16≡5,

17≡6,

18≡7,

19≡8,

20≡9,

21≡10,

22≡0,

23≡1,

24≡2,

25≡3,

26≡4.

So, only 18≡7 mod11.

Therefore, S_odd must be18 and S_even must be36 -18=18.

Wait, so both S_odd and S_even must be18.

Therefore, we have to find the number of permutations where the digits in the odd positions sum to18, and the digits in the even positions also sum to18.

But earlier, we saw that the odd digits must be1,3,5,7 which sum to16, but we need them to sum to18.

Similarly, the even digits (2,4,6,8) sum to20, which is higher than18.

Therefore, we cannot have the odd digits as1,3,5,7, because their sum is16, which is less than18. So, we need to have some other combination.

Wait, so how can we get S_odd=18?

We need four digits from1-8 that sum to18, and the remaining four digits must also sum to18.

Therefore, we need two sets of four digits each, both summing to18, using all digits1-8.

So, the problem reduces to partitioning the digits1-8 into two groups of four, each summing to18.

So, let's find such partitions.

Total sum is36, so each group must sum to18.

So, how many ways can we partition1-8 into two subsets of four digits each, both summing to18?

Once we find the number of such partitions, each partition can be arranged in4! *4! ways, as the digits in each group can be permuted independently in their respective positions.

Therefore, N= number of such partitions * (4! *4!).

So, first, let's find the number of such partitions.

Let me list all possible combinations of four digits from1-8 that sum to18.

This seems like a classic partition problem, which might be time-consuming, but let's try.

First, start with the smallest digits:

1,2,3,12 → too big, since maximum digit is8.

Wait, 1,2,3,12 is invalid.

Wait, let's think differently.

We can use a systematic approach.

Let me list all combinations of four distinct digits from1-8 that sum to18.

Start with the smallest possible digits and increase one by one.

1,2,3,12 invalid.

Wait, 1,2,4,11 invalid.

Wait, this approach is messy.

Alternatively, since the total is36, and each subset is18, we can think of it as a partition problem.

I think the number of such partitions is limited.

Let me look for all possible combinations.

First, let me note that 8 is a large digit, so maybe it's included in a subset.

Case 1: 8 is in the first subset.

Then, the remaining three digits in the first subset must sum to10.

So, we need three distinct digits from1-7 that sum to10.

Possible triplets:

1,2,7=10

1,3,6=10

1,4,5=10

2,3,5=10

That's it.

So, for each of these triplets, we can form a subset by adding8.

Therefore:

Subset1: {8,1,2,7}

Subset2: {8,1,3,6}

Subset3: {8,1,4,5}

Subset4: {8,2,3,5}

Case2: 8 is not in the first subset.

But wait, since we are partitioning into two subsets, if8 is in the second subset, it's equivalent to case1, just swapping the subsets.

Therefore, these four subsets are the only possible ones.

But let me confirm if there are more.

Is there a subset without8 that sums to18?

Let's see.

Check if four digits without8 can sum to18.

What's the maximum sum without8:7+6+5+4=22.

Minimum sum:1+2+3+4=10.

So,18 is between10 and22.

So, let's try to find such subsets.

Let me start with the highest digit,7.

If7 is included, then the remaining three digits need to sum to11.

Possible triplets from1-6:

1,2,8 invalid.

Wait, 7 is included, so digits are from1-7 excluding7.

Wait, 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Wait, 1,2,3,12 no.

Wait, 1,2,4,12 no.

Wait, 1,3,4,10 no.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, 7 is included, so the remaining three digits must sum to11.

So, looking for triplets from1-6 that sum to11.

Possible triplets:

1,2,8 invalid

Wait, no, digits are from1-6.

So:

1,2,8 invalid.

Wait, 1,2,3,15 no.

Wait, actually, 7 + a + b + c=18, so a + b + c=11.

Possible triplets:

1,2,8 invalid.

1,3,7 invalid.

Wait, no, digits are from1-6.

So, triplet from1-6:

Possible triplets:

1,2,8 no.

Wait, 1,4,6=11.

1+4+6=11

2,3,6=11

2,4,5=11

3,4,4 invalid.

So, the triplets are:

{1,4,6}, {2,3,6}, {2,4,5}

Therefore, the subsets are:

{7,1,4,6}, {7,2,3,6}, {7,2,4,5}

But wait, let me check if these are valid:

{7,1,4,6}: sum is7+1+4+6=18.

{7,2,3,6}:7+2+3+6=18.

{7,2,4,5}:7+2+4+5=18.

So, these are three more subsets without8.

Therefore, in total, we have:

From case1:4 subsets (including8)

From case2:3 subsets (without8)

Total of7 subsets.

Wait, let me list them:

1. {8,1,2,7}

2. {8,1,3,6}

3. {8,1,4,5}

4. {8,2,3,5}

5. {7,1,4,6}

6. {7,2,3,6}

7. {7,2,4,5}

Therefore, there are7 such subsets.

But wait, is that all?

Let me check if there are more subsets without8.

For example, is there a subset {6,5,4,3}=18? 6+5+4+3=18.

Yes, that's another one.

So, subset8: {6,5,4,3}

Similarly, {6,5,3,4} is same as above.

Wait, is there another one?

What about {6,5,2,5} but duplicates.

No, digits must be distinct.

What about {6,4,3,5}= same as above.

Wait, no, that's the same.

Wait, what about {5,4,3,6}= same.

So, only one such subset: {3,4,5,6}

Wait, but that's the same as {6,5,4,3}.

Therefore, that's another subset.

So, subset8: {3,4,5,6}

Therefore, total subsets are8.

Wait, let me check:

1. {8,1,2,7}

2. {8,1,3,6}

3. {8,1,4,5}

4. {8,2,3,5}

5. {7,1,4,6}

6. {7,2,3,6}

7. {7,2,4,5}

8. {3,4,5,6}

Yes, that's8 subsets.

Each of these subsets sums to18.

Therefore, the number of partitions is8.

But wait, each partition is a unique way to divide the digits into two subsets summing to18. However, some subsets might be rotations or reflections, but in terms of unique partitions, they are distinct.

Therefore, the number of such partitions is8.

But wait, let me confirm if {3,4,5,6} is the only subset without8.

Yes, because any other subset without8 would require four digits from1-7 summing to18, and the only such subsets are those that include7 and some others or don't include7.

But {3,4,5,6} is the only subset without8 that sums to18.

Therefore, total partitions:8.

Thus, the number of such permutations is8 partitions, each of which can be arranged in4! ways for the odd positions and4! ways for the even positions.

Therefore, total number N=8*(4! *4!)=8*24*24=8*576=4608.

But wait, the total number of eight-digit numbers is8!=40320, which is much larger than4608.

Wait, but hold on, if each partition corresponds to (4! *4!) permutations, then8 partitions correspond to8*576=4608 numbers.

So, N=4608.

But earlier, I thought that the number of such numbers is576 because of the fixed even digits, but that was incorrect because the even digits don't have to be2,4,6,8 in order.

Wait, no, actually, earlier reasoning was wrong because the even digits don't have to be fixed as2,4,6,8—they can be any four digits, but in reality, the even positions must contain four digits summing to20, but since the total even digits are2,4,6,8 summing to20, they have to be exactly those digits.

Wait, but that contradicts with the current reasoning.

Wait, maybe I need to reconcile these two thoughts.

Wait, initially, I thought that the digits in the even positions must be2,4,6,8, but in reality, S_even must sum to20.

But in the problem, the digits are1-8, each used once. So, regardless of where they are placed, the sum of the even digits is fixed at20.

Therefore, the even digits must be2,4,6,8 in some order, and the odd digits must be1,3,5,7 in some order.

Thus, the number of such numbers is4! *4!=576.

But that can't be, because according to the partitioning, N=4608.

So, which is correct?

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, let me clarify.

The sum of even digits is20, which is fixed, regardless of their positions.

But, the digits used in the even positions must be2,4,6,8, because those are the only even digits. Similarly, the odd positions must be1,3,5,7.

Therefore, the number of such numbers is4! *4!=576.

But then, why did the partitioning approach give me N=4608?

Because in that case, I was considering subsets of four digits summing to18, which is incorrect because the even digits must sum to20, not18.

Wait, no, actually, the partitioning approach was for when S_odd and S_even both sum to18, but in reality, S_odd=16 and S_even=20, which do not satisfy the divisibility by11.

Therefore, my earlier mistake was in thinking that both S_odd and S_even must be18, but actually, S_odd=16 and S_even=20, which don't satisfy the divisibility by11.

Therefore, the number of such numbers is zero, but that contradicts the partitioning approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconcile these two.

So, in the problem, the digits are1-8, each used once.

To be divisible by22, the number must have last digit even (so last digit is2,4,6,8), and the difference between the sum of the odd positions and the even positions must be multiple of11.

Earlier, I thought that the sum of the even digits is20, so S_odd=16, which does not satisfy the divisibility by11, but that's only if we fix the digits in the even positions as2,4,6,8.

However, if we don't fix the digits in the even positions, but allow any four digits, then the sum of the even digits could vary.

Wait, but the total sum is36, so if S_even is variable, S_odd=36 - S_even.

Then, for divisibility by11, we have S_odd - S_even ≡0 mod11.

Which as we saw, requires both S_odd and S_even to be congruent to7 mod11.

Since S_odd + S_even=36, which is≡3 mod11.

So, if S_odd≡7, then S_even=36 -7=29≡7 mod11, which works.

Therefore, we need both S_odd and S_even to be congruent to7 mod11.

But S_odd can be from10 to26, so possible values are18 only, since18≡7 mod11.

Similarly, S_even must also be18.

Therefore, both S_odd and S_even must be18.

Therefore, the digits in the odd positions must sum to18, and the digits in the even positions must also sum to18.

Therefore, the number of such numbers is equal to the number of ways to partition the digits1-8 into two sets of four digits each, both summing to18, and then permuting each set.

Earlier, I found that there are8 such partitions.

Therefore, N=8*(4! *4!)=8*24*24=4608.

But wait, earlier, I thought that the even digits must be2,4,6,8, but that is only if we don't consider rearrangement.

But in reality, even digits can be any four digits, as long as they sum to20, but no, wait, in this case, S_even=18, which is different.

Wait, confusion arises.

Wait, no, if we are to have S_odd=18 and S_even=18, then the digits in the odd positions must sum to18, and the digits in the even positions must also sum to18.

But since the total sum is36, each subset must sum to18.

Therefore, the number of such numbers is equal to the number of such partitions, times the permutations.

So, since there are8 such partitions, each giving4! *4! permutations, N=8*24*24=4608.

But wait, the problem is that if the even digits are not fixed as2,4,6,8, but can be any four digits, but in our case, the even digits must sum to18.

But the even digits are four distinct digits from1-8, not necessarily2,4,6,8, but can be any four digits as long as they sum to18.

Wait, but in our initial analysis, we saw that the digits in the odd positions must be1,3,5,7, which sum to16, which doesn't satisfy S_odd=18.

Therefore, this seems like a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong that the digits in the odd and even positions are fixed.

Wait, perhaps the even digits can be any four digits, not necessarily2,4,6,8, as long as they sum to18.

Similarly, the odd digits can be any four digits, summing to18.

Therefore, the correct approach is:

1. Find all possible 4-digit combinations from1-8 that sum to18.

Each such combination can be assigned to the odd positions, and the remaining four digits assigned to the even positions.

2. For each such combination, the number of permutations is4! *4!.

3. Therefore, total N is equal to the number of such combinations multiplied by4! *4!.

Earlier, I found that there are8 such combinations.

Therefore, N=8*24*24=4608.

Thus, N=4608.

But wait, the problem states that the number is divisible by22, so it must be divisible by2 and11.

Divisible by2 requires the last digit to be even.

Divisible by11 requires S_odd - S_even≡0 mod11.

Therefore, to satisfy both, S_odd - S_even must be0 mod11, which as we saw, requires S_odd=18 and S_even=18.

Therefore, the number of such numbers is equal to the number of ways to choose four digits from1-8 summing to18, assign them to the odd positions, and the rest to the even positions, then permute each.

Since there are8 such combinations, each giving4! *4! permutations, N=4608.

Therefore, N=4608.

Then, the problem asks for the difference betweenN and2025.

So,2025 - N=2025 -4608= -2583.

But since the question says "the difference between N and2025", it's likely asking for the absolute value, but it's not specified. However, since N=4608 is greater than2025, the difference is4608 -2025=2583.

Therefore, the answer is2583.

But wait, let me double-check the number of such combinations.

Earlier, I found8 such partitions.

Wait, let me recount:

1. {8,1,2,7}

2. {8,1,3,6}

3. {8,1,4,5}

4. {8,2,3,5}

5. {7,1,4,6}

6. {7,2,3,6}

7. {7,2,4,5}

8. {3,4,5,6}

Yes, that's8.

Therefore, N=8*(4! *4!)=8*24*24=4608.

Therefore, difference=4608 -2025=2583.

But wait, let me think again.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the number of these integers that are divisible by22".

But according to my reasoning, N=4608, which is much larger than2025.

But the total number of 8-digit numbers using digits1-8 exactly once is40320, which is about40k, but N=4608 is about11.4% of that.

But 2025 is much less than40320, so N=4608 is greater than2025, so difference is4608 -2025=2583.

Therefore, the answer is2583.

But wait, let me check my work again.

Is N=4608 correct?

So, according to the logic, the sum of the digits is36.

To be divisible by11, the difference between the sum of the odd positions and the sum of the even positions must be0 mod11.

Thus, S_odd ≡ S_even mod11.

Given that S_odd + S_even=36≡3 mod11, so S_odd ≡ (36 - S_even)≡ (3 - S_even) mod11.

But since S_odd ≡ S_even mod11, then 3 - S_even ≡ S_even mod11 ⇒3≡2*S_even mod11.

Which leads to S_even≡(3*6)≡18≡7 mod11.

Therefore, S_even≡7 mod11, which gives S_even=18, as S_even can be from10 to26.

Similarly, S_odd=18.

Therefore, both S_odd and S_even must be18.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of such numbers where the digits in the odd positions sum to18 and the digits in the even positions sum to18.

Each such partition contributes4! *4! permutations.

Number of such partitions is8, as we found.

Therefore, N=8*24*24=4608.

Thus, the difference is4608 -2025=2583.

So, I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2583}
</think>

To determine the number of eight-digit integers using each digit from 1 to 8 exactly once that are divisible by 22, we need to check for divisibility by both 2 and 11.

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The last digit must be even. The even digits are 2, 4, 6, and 8, giving 4 choices.

2. **Divisibility by 11**: The difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be a multiple of 11. The total sum of all digits (1 through 8) is 36. Let \( S_{\text{odd}} \) be the sum of the digits in the odd positions and \( S_{\text{even}} \) be the sum of the digits in the even positions. We need \( S_{\text{odd}} - S_{\text{even}} \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \) and \( S_{\text{odd}} + S_{\text{even}} = 36 \).

   Solving these, we find:
   \[
   S_{\text{odd}} \equiv 7 \pmod{11} \quad \text{and} \quad S_{\text{even}} \equiv 7 \pmod{11}
   \]
   Given \( S_{\text{odd}} + S_{\text{even}} = 36 \equiv 3 \pmod{11} \), we find \( S_{\text{odd}} = 18 \) and \( S_{\text{even}} = 18 \).

3. **Finding valid partitions**: We need to partition the digits 1-8 into two sets of four digits each, both summing to 18. The valid partitions are:
   - {8, 1, 2, 7}
   - {8, 1, 3, 6}
   - {8, 1, 4, 5}
   - {8, 2, 3, 5}
   - {7, 1, 4, 6}
   - {7, 2, 3, 6}
   - {7, 2, 4, 5}
   - {3, 4, 5, 6}

   There are 8 such partitions.

4. **Calculating permutations**: Each partition can be arranged in \( 4! \) ways for the odd positions and \( 4! \) ways for the even positions. Thus, each partition contributes \( 4! \times 4! = 24 \times 24 = 576 \) permutations.

5. **Total number of valid integers**: The total number \( N \) is \( 8 \times 576 = 4608 \).

6. **Difference**: The difference between \( N \) and 2025 is:
   \[
   4608 - 2025 = 2583
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2583}
\]
