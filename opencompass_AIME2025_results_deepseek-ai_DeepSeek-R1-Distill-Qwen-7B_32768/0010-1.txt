Question:
The twelve letters $A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K$, and $L$ are randomly grouped into six pairs of letters. The two letters in each pair are placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form six two-letter words, and those six words are listed alphabetically. For example, a possible result is $AB,CJ,DG,EK,FL,HI$. The probability that the last word listed contains $G$ is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where there are twelve letters from A to L, and they're grouped into six pairs. Each pair is then put together in alphabetical order to form two-letter words, and these words are listed alphabetically. I need to find the probability that the last word contains the letter G. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the setup. We have letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L. They are randomly grouped into six pairs. Each pair is then sorted alphabetically to form a two-letter word. Then, all six words are listed in alphabetical order. The question is about the probability that the last word in this list contains the letter G.

Hmm. So, to rephrase, after all the words are formed and sorted, what's the probability that the last word has G in it? That is, either G is the first letter or the second letter of that last word.

Wait, but the last word is the sixth word in the sorted list. So, if all six words are listed alphabetically, the last word will be the one that comes last in the entire list. So, we need this last word to contain G. So, either G is the first letter of the last word or the second letter of the last word.

But in a two-letter word, the first letter is always before the second letter since they are sorted. So, the last word would be the one that is the lex greatest among all six words.

So, for example, in the given example, AB, CJ, DG, EK, FL, HI. The last word is HI. So, it doesn't contain G. But in our case, we want the last word to contain G.

So, how can G be the last word? Well, G is a letter, so if G is in the last word, it can be either the first letter or the second letter. But since the word is sorted, if G is the first letter, it would be the first letter, but if G is paired with a higher letter, then it would be first, or if it's paired with a lower letter, it would be the second letter.

Wait, but since the words are sorted alphabetically, the last word is the one that comes last. So, for example, if the last word is GH, that would come after any word starting with G and a letter after H, but since H is the last letter here, maybe not. Wait, in our case, the letters go up to L.

Wait, actually, no. Let me think. The letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L. So, the words are two letters, each sorted, so the first word is the first two letters in the group, the next word is the next two, etc., but actually, no. Wait, no, the pairing is random.

Wait, no, the grouping is into six pairs, each pair is sorted, then all six words are listed in alphabetical order. So, for example, if one pair is AG, then it becomes AG. If another pair is BH, it becomes BH, and so on. Then, all six words are sorted alphabetically, so AG, BH, etc., and the last one is the highest word.

So, in this case, the last word is the sixth word in the sorted list of six words. So, we need this sixth word to contain G in it. So, either G is the first letter of that sixth word or the second letter.

But since the words are sorted alphabetically, the sixth word is the last one, so in order for that word to contain G, it must be either GH, GI, GJ, GK, GL, or even GF, GE, etc., but no, since G is in the middle.

Wait, but G is the seventh letter in the alphabet, right? A is first, B is second, ..., G is seventh.

So, the words that contain G could be something like GA, GB, ..., GL, but since each pair is sorted, the word with G would have G as the first letter or the second letter. But if G is the second letter, then the first letter must be before G, so A, B, C, D, E, F.

Similarly, if G is the first letter, then the second letter is H, I, J, K, L.

But in the overall sorted list of words, the last word is the last one. So, for the last word to contain G, it must be either a word starting with G or ending with G.

But wait, in the list of six words, sorted alphabetically, the last word is the one that is the highest in the alphabetical order. So, for example, if the highest word is HI, that's the last one. If the highest word is GL, that's the last one.

So, to have G in the last word, G must be the first letter of the last word or the second letter of the last word. But since all words are two letters, if G is the first letter, it would have to be the first letter of that word, but if G is the second letter, then the first letter must be before G.

But in this case, the last word is the highest word in the list. So, if G is in the last word, then it's either the highest word that starts with G, or the highest word that ends with G but starts with a letter before G.

Wait, but G is the seventh letter, so if a word ends with G, the first letter must be before G. So, the highest word ending with G would be something like FG. But the highest word starting with G would be GH, GI, GJ, GK, GL.

But in terms of the order, which is higher: the highest word starting with G or the highest word ending with G. Since words are compared letter by letter, starting from the first. So, words starting with G would come after all words starting with F, E, etc.

Wait, no, the words are sorted alphabetically, so the order is based on the first letter, and then the second letter if the first letters are the same.

Therefore, words starting with G would come after all words that start with letters before G, like F, E, etc. So, the highest word would be the highest starting with L, right? So, the highest word is LL? No, but all letters are unique, so it's something like KL or something else.

Wait, no, all letters are unique, so in the pairing, each letter is used exactly once. So, no, no letter is repeated. So, the highest possible word would be something like KL, if K and L are paired.

But in this case, the last word is the highest word in the sorted list. So, if we have a word starting with G, it would come before any word starting with letters after G, like H, I, J, K, L.

Wait, so if the highest word is, say, KL, then G is not in that word. If the highest word is, say, GL, then that word comes before KL because G comes before K. But since the words are sorted, KL would come after GL.

Wait, but in the overall list of words, the last word is the highest one, so if the highest word is GL, then GL is the last word. If the highest word is something like HI, then HI is the last word. Similarly, if the highest word is KL, then KL is the last word.

Wait, but G is the seventh letter, so any word starting with G comes before any word starting with H, I, J, K, or L. So, the only way that G is in the last word is if the last word is a word that starts with G, because if the last word starts with H, I, J, K, or L, then G is not in that word.

But hold on, the last word is the highest word. So, the highest word is the one that comes last in the alphabetical order. So, the highest word is the one whose first letter is the highest possible, and if there are multiple words starting with the same highest letter, then the one with the highest second letter comes next.

So, for example, if we have words starting with L, the highest word would be LL, but since all letters are unique, it's something like KL and LL is not possible. Wait, all letters are used exactly once, so each pair is unique.

So, the highest word would be the pair with the two highest remaining letters. So, if the highest possible word is KL, then it would be the last word. But if KL is not formed, then maybe the next one is JL, then IL, etc.

Wait, but in any case, the highest word is the one that's the highest in the list, so it's the pair of the two highest remaining letters.

But in order for G to be in the last word, that last word must either contain G as the first letter or as the second letter.

But if the last word is the highest word, it's the pair of the two highest remaining letters. So, if G is in that pair, then either G is the first letter (so it's paired with a higher letter) or G is the second letter (so it's paired with a lower letter). However, since the letters are all unique, if G is in the last word, it must be paired with either a higher or a lower letter, but since G is the 7th letter, a higher letter would be H, I, J, K, or L.

Wait, so the last word is the highest word, which is either a word starting with L or, if L is already used, then the next highest, which would be K or something else.

But, in order for G to be in the last word, that last word must be either GL or something starting with G, but if the last word is starting with G, then it's the highest word starting with G, but since all higher letters have already been used in higher words, no.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently.

We need to compute the probability that the last word in the sorted list contains G. So, to compute this probability, we need to count the number of possible pairings where the last word contains G, divided by the total number of possible pairings.

The total number of pairings is the number of ways to partition twelve distinct letters into six pairs, which is (12)! / (2^6 * 6!) = 10395. I remember that formula.

But maybe I don't need to compute it right now, but just keep in mind that the total number of possible pairings is 10395.

Now, the number of favorable pairings where the last word contains G.

So, how can we compute the number of such pairings?

Well, perhaps, instead of thinking about the last word, we can think about the position of G in the sorted list of words.

Wait, but the last word is the sixth word, so let's consider the sixth word. For G to be in the sixth word, the sixth word must either be something like GH, GI, GJ, GK, GL, or GF, GE, etc., but actually, considering that the sixth word is the last one in the sorted list, it's going to be the highest word.

Therefore, the sixth word is the highest word, which is the pair of the two highest remaining letters.

So, if G is in the sixth word, that word must be either GH, GI, GJ, GK, GL, or GF, but wait, no, because G is the seventh letter, so the highest letters after G are H, I, J, K, L.

Therefore, the highest word containing G must be either GH, GI, GJ, GK, or GL. Because H, I, J, K, L are all higher than G.

But wait, if G is paired with a higher letter, then GH, GI, GJ, GK, GL are possible, and those would be the highest words starting with G. But since the sixth word is the highest word in the list, that would have to be the highest possible word, which is either KL, JL, IL, HL, or GL, etc., depending on how the letters are paired.

Wait, so the highest word is the pair of the two highest remaining letters. So, if G is to be in the highest word, then G must be the second letter in that highest word because the first letter must be before G, but since the highest word comes after all other words, the first letter can't be after G.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Let me clarify.

If we have the highest word, say, KL, which is the last word. Then, G is not in that word. If the highest word is GL, then that word is before KL because G comes before K. So, the last word is KL, which doesn't contain G.

Similarly, if the highest word is JL, then the last word is JL, which doesn't contain G.

Wait, but if G is the second letter in the highest word, say, GL, then the highest word is GL, which is after words like AB, CD, etc., but before KL. So, in that case, GL would be the sixth word.

Similarly, if the highest word is something else, like FI, but that would be before GL because F comes before G. So, to have the last word contain G, G must be the second letter in the highest word.

But wait, is that possible? Because for the highest word to contain G as the second letter, the first letter must be a letter before G, say, F, but then that word would come before any word starting with G or higher.

So, if the highest word is FG, then it's before GL, which is before KL. Therefore, the last word would be KL, not FG.

Therefore, in order for G to be in the last word, G must be the first letter of the last word.

But wait, if G is the first letter of the last word, then that word would be the highest word starting with G, which would be higher than any word starting with letters after G, but since letters after G are H, I, J, K, L, and those are higher than G, so if G is the first letter, then the word starting with G is before any word starting with H, I, J, K, L.

But in that case, the last word would be a word starting with H, I, J, K, or L, not G. So, how can G be in the last word?

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think about it differently.

Let me consider that the last word is the highest word in the list, which is determined by the alphabetical order of the two-letter words.

Therefore, to have G in the last word, that word must be the highest possible word that includes G. So, the highest word including G would be GL, because L is the highest letter. So, if G is paired with L, then GL is a word. But is that the highest word?

Wait, if G is paired with L, then GL is a word, but if there's another pair that forms a higher word, like KL, then the last word would be KL, not GL. So, for GL to be the last word, KL must not be formed.

Similarly, for GL to be the last word, G must be paired with L, and K must be paired with someone else, and the highest remaining word after that would be... Hmm, maybe.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as the probability that in the pairing, G is paired with L, and all the other letters are paired in such a way that the highest word is GL.

Alternatively, maybe the probability that G is paired with the highest remaining letter at the time of forming the last word.

Wait, perhaps it's getting too convoluted.

Another approach: The words are sorted alphabetically, so the last word is the maximum of the six words. So, the last word is the maximum two-letter word among all possible two-letter words formed by the pairing.

So, for the last word to contain G, it must be that G is part of the maximum two-letter word.

So, the maximum two-letter word is the one that is the largest in the alphabetical order. So, the maximum two-letter word is the pair of the two largest remaining letters.

Therefore, for G to be in the maximum two-letter word, G must be one of the two largest letters.

Wait, no, because if G is not the largest letter, which it isn't, because L is the largest, then for G to be in the maximum two-letter word, G must be paired with the next largest letter, which is L.

So, if G is paired with L, then GL is the maximum two-letter word, which would be the last word. If G is paired with someone else, then the maximum two-letter word would be something else, possibly containing L, but not G.

Therefore, the only way that G is in the last word is if G is paired with L, making GL the last word.

Therefore, the probability that the last word contains G is equal to the probability that G and L are paired together.

So, if that's the case, then the problem reduces to finding the probability that in a random pairing of twelve letters, G and L are paired together.

So, how many ways are there to pair twelve letters? It's 10395, as before.

How many pairings have G and L paired together? Well, if we fix G and L as a pair, then we have ten letters left, which can be paired in (10)! / (2^5 * 5!) = 945 ways.

So, the number of favorable pairings is 945.

Therefore, the probability is 945 / 10395. Simplify that fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 945: 945 ÷ 945 = 1, 10395 ÷ 945 = 11.

So, the probability is 1/11. Therefore, m = 1, n = 11, so m + n = 12.

Wait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because in the earlier reasoning, I thought that the last word is the maximum two-letter word, which is the pair of the two largest remaining letters. So, G is in the last word only if G is paired with L, making GL the maximum word.

But is that necessarily the case? Suppose G is paired with someone else, say, F, then the maximum word might still be something else, like KL or something.

Wait, but if G is paired with someone else, then L is still available to pair with someone else, so the maximum word would be something else.

Wait, but no, actually, in the pairing, if G is paired with someone else, say, F, then L is still available, so L could pair with K, making the maximum word KL, which is higher than any word containing G.

Therefore, the maximum word is independent of G unless G is paired with L.

Therefore, only when G is paired with L, the maximum word is GL, which is the last word.

Thus, the probability that the last word contains G is equal to the probability that G is paired with L, which is 1/11.

Wait, because in the pairing, each letter is equally likely to be paired with any other letter. So, for G, the probability that it is paired with L is 1/11, since there are 11 possible partners for G.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the probability is 1/11, so m + n is 1 + 11 = 12.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a case where G is paired with someone else, but the maximum word is still a word containing G? For example, if G is paired with H, and then the maximum word is KL, which doesn't contain G. If G is paired with I, the maximum word is KL, which doesn't contain G. Similarly, if G is paired with J, K, or L, but wait, if G is paired with L, then the maximum word is GL, which is the last word. If G is paired with someone else, the maximum word is KL, which is still the highest.

Wait, so if G is paired with L, then the maximum word is GL, which is the last word. If G is paired with someone else, then the maximum word is KL, which is the last word. Therefore, the only way that the last word contains G is if G is paired with L, making GL the last word.

Therefore, the probability is 1/11, so m + n = 12.

Wait, but in the example given in the problem, the last word is HI, which doesn't contain G. So, in that case, G is paired with someone else. So, in the example, G is paired with C, I think. Let me check: AB, CJ, DG, EK, FL, HI. So, G is paired with D, making DG, which is not the last word. So, in that case, the last word is HI, which is the maximum word.

Therefore, in the example, G is paired with D, so the maximum word is HI, which doesn't contain G.

Therefore, to have G in the last word, G must be paired with L, making GL the last word.

Hence, the probability is 1/11, so m + n is 12.

Wait, but hold on, is there another scenario where G is in the last word without being paired with L?

Suppose G is paired with someone else, but the maximum word is something else that includes G.

But wait, the maximum word is the highest two-letter word, which is the pair of the two highest remaining letters. So, unless G is paired with L, which is the highest letter, the maximum word will be KL or something else.

But if G is paired with someone else, say, F, then the maximum word is KL or something else.

Wait, but in the sorted list, the words are in order. So, the word with G as the first letter can be followed by a word with L as the first letter.

Wait, for example, suppose G is paired with F, making FG, and L is paired with someone else, say, K, making KL. Then, in the sorted list, FG comes before KL, so KL is the last word, which doesn't contain G. Similarly, if G is paired with H, making GH, which comes before KL.

Wait, so even if G is paired with a letter before L, the maximum word is KL, which doesn't contain G.

Therefore, the only way that G is in the last word is if G is paired with L, making GL the last word.

Therefore, the probability is indeed 1/11, so m + n is 12.

Wait, but hold on. Let me test another case. Suppose G is paired with L, making GL. Then, the other letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K. So, the next highest pair would be K and J, making KJ. Then, next would be HI, then something else.

Wait, no, letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K. So, the highest possible pair is KJ, then HI, then something else. So, the list would be AB, CD, EF, HI, KJ, GL. So, in this case, GL is indeed the last word. So, that works.

But suppose G is paired with someone else, say, A, making GA. Then, the highest word is KL, as before. So, the list would be AB, GA, CD, EF, HI, KL. So, the last word is KL, which doesn't contain G.

So, in that case, G is not in the last word.

Alternatively, if G is paired with someone in the middle, like H, making GH. Then, the highest word is KL, so the list would be AB, CD, EF, GH, HI, KL. So, again, the last word is KL, which doesn't contain G.

Therefore, only when G is paired with L, making GL, is GL the last word.

Thus, the probability is the number of pairings where G and L are paired together divided by the total number of pairings.

As before, total number of pairings is 10395.

Number of pairings where G and L are paired together is (10)! / (2^5 * 5!) = 945.

Therefore, probability is 945 / 10395 = 1/11.

Hence, m is 1, n is 11, so m + n = 12.

But wait, let me just think again: could there be another scenario where G is in the last word without being paired with L?

Suppose, for example, that G is not paired with L, but someone else, and the last word is a word that includes G as the second letter. But in that case, G would have to be paired with a letter higher than L, but L is the highest letter, so that's impossible.

Alternatively, if G is paired with someone, say, F, making FG, but then L is paired with someone else, say, K, making KL. So, the last word is KL, which doesn't contain G.

Alternatively, if G is paired with someone lower, like C, making GC, but then again, the maximum word is KL, so the last word is KL.

Therefore, the only way G is in the last word is if G is paired with L, making GL the last word.

So, the probability is 1/11.

Therefore, the answer is 1 + 11 = 12.

**Final Answer**
The probability that the last word contains G is $\boxed{12}$.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the last word in the sorted list of six two-letter words contains the letter G. The six letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, and L are randomly grouped into six pairs, each pair is sorted alphabetically, and then the resulting words are listed alphabetically. 

1. **Understanding the Setup**:
   - The letters are grouped into six pairs.
   - Each pair is sorted alphabetically to form a two-letter word.
   - These words are then sorted alphabetically, and the last word is considered.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The last word in the sorted list is the highest word, which is the pair of the two highest remaining letters.
   - For the last word to contain G, G must be the first letter of the highest word. However, since G is the 7th letter, the highest word containing G would be GL, but this cannot be the last word because KL (the highest possible word) would come after GL.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The only way for G to be in the last word is if G is paired with L, making GL the last word.
   - The probability of G being paired with L is calculated by considering the total number of ways to pair the letters and the number of favorable pairings.

4. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The total number of ways to pair twelve letters is given by \(\frac{12!}{2^6 \cdot 6!} = 10395\).
   - The number of favorable pairings where G and L are paired together is \(\frac{10!}{2^5 \cdot 5!} = 945\).
   - The probability is \(\frac{945}{10395} = \frac{1}{11}\).

Thus, the probability that the last word contains G is \(\frac{1}{11}\). Therefore, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 11\), leading to \(m + n = 12\).

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
