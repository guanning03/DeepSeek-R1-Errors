Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ordered triples (a, b, c) such that each of a, b, c is a positive integer less than or equal to 3^6, and the sum a^3 + b^3 + c^3 is divisible by 3^7. Then, I have to find the remainder when this number N is divided by 1000.

First, let's parse the problem. We have a, b, c each up to 3^6, which is 729. So, each of a, b, c can be any integer from 1 to 729. The condition is that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 is divisible by 3^7, which is 2187. So, we're looking for triples where the sum of their cubes is a multiple of 2187.

I think this is a problem that relates to modular arithmetic, specifically modulo powers of 3. Maybe I can consider the possible residues of a^3, b^3, c^3 modulo 3^7 and then count how many triples add up to 0 modulo 3^7.

But 3^7 is a pretty high power. Maybe it's easier to approach this using the concept of lifting the exponent or Hensel's lemma? Or perhaps using generating functions?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the number of solutions can be found using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or some combinatorial counting with modular conditions.

But let's see. First, let's think about the possible residues of a cube modulo 3^k. For higher powers of 3, the behavior of cubes modulo 3^k can be more complex, but perhaps there's a pattern or formula.

I recall that for modulo 3, the cubes are either 0 or 1. Because 0^3 ≡ 0 mod 3, 1^3 ≡ 1, and 2^3 = 8 ≡ 2 mod 3. Wait, that's interesting. So, in mod 3, cubes can be 0, 1, or 2. Hmm, but 2 is not a cube in mod 3, because 2 isn't a cube residue mod 3? Wait, 2 is equivalent to -1 mod 3, but is that a cube?

Wait, no, actually, let me compute 2^3 mod 3. 2^3 is 8, which is 2 mod 3. So, in mod 3, 2 is a cube residue because 2 ≡ (-1)^3. So, yes, 2 is a cube residue mod 3.

But then, when we go to higher powers, like mod 9, 27, etc., the behavior becomes more nuanced. The number of solutions to x^3 ≡ k mod 3^m can vary depending on k and m.

I think I remember that for odd primes, the number of solutions to x^3 ≡ a mod p^m can be determined by Hensel's lemma. For p=3, which is odd, Hensel's lemma applies.

But maybe it's better to think about the multiplicative inverses and how the cubes distribute modulo 3^7.

Alternatively, I might consider using generating functions. The idea would be to construct a generating function where the coefficient of x^k represents the number of integers a ≤ 729 such that a^3 ≡ k mod 2187. Then, the number N would be the coefficient of x^0 in the cube of this generating function, since we have three variables a, b, c.

But constructing such a generating function seems complicated, especially for modulus 2187. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I can find the number of solutions modulo 3^7 by considering the solutions modulo 3^k for increasing k and using some recursive formula.

But let's try to understand the cube residues modulo 3^m.

First, let's consider modulo 3. For any integer a, a ≡ 0, 1, or 2 mod 3. Then, a^3 ≡ 0, 1, or 2 mod 3. So, the cubes modulo 3 are the same as the residues.

Similarly, modulo 9: Let's compute a^3 mod 9 for a from 0 to 8.

0^3 = 0

1^3 = 1

2^3 = 8

3^3 = 27 ≡ 0 mod 9

4^3 = 64 ≡ 1 mod 9

5^3 = 125 ≡ 8 mod 9

6^3 = 216 ≡ 0 mod 9

7^3 = 343 ≡ 1 mod 9

8^3 = 512 ≡ 8 mod 9

So, modulo 9, the cubes are either 0, 1, or 8. So, similar to modulo 3, but now 8 is equivalent to -1 mod 9.

Similarly, for higher powers, perhaps the cube residues modulo 3^m follow a pattern.

Wait, I think the number of cube residues modulo 3^m is 3^{m-1} or something like that? Let me check.

Actually, for modulus 3^m, the number of cubic residues is 3^{m-1}. So, for each m ≥ 1, there are 3^{m-1} cubic residues modulo 3^m.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, for modulus 3, number of cubic residues is 3^{1-1}=1? But earlier, we saw that modulo 3, the residues are 0,1,2, so 3 in total. So that doesn't align.

Wait, maybe that formula isn't correct. Maybe the number of cubic residues modulo 3^m is 3^{m} for m ≥ 1? But that would mean for m=1, 3 residues, which is correct, for m=2, 9 residues, but modulo 9, the cube residues are only 0,1,8. So, 3 residues, not 9. So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I need a better approach.

I recall that for odd primes p, the number of solutions to x^3 ≡ a mod p^m can be determined by whether a is a cubic residue modulo p. For p=3, which is a prime where 3 ≡ 0 mod 3, so it's a special case.

In general, for p an odd prime, the number of solutions to x^3 ≡ a mod p^m is:

- If a ≡ 0 mod p, then there is exactly one solution.

- If a is a cubic residue modulo p, then there are three solutions.

- Otherwise, there are no solutions.

But p=3 is a special case because 3 divides the exponent 3.

Wait, actually, for p=3, I think the number of solutions can be different.

Wait, let's check a reference.

Wait, actually, I found a resource that says:

For an odd prime p, the equation x^k ≡ a mod p^m has solutions if and only if a is a k-th power residue modulo p, and if so, the number of solutions is equal to the number of solutions modulo p, times p^{m-1}.

But for p=3 and k=3, the number of solutions modulo 3 is 3, since 0^3 ≡ 0, 1^3 ≡1, 2^3 ≡8≡2 mod 3, so all residues are cubes. So, for p=3 and k=3, the equation x^3 ≡ a mod 3 has 3 solutions for any a.

Wait, but that seems contradictory because when m increases, the number of solutions should increase as well.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

I think for the equation x^3 ≡ a mod 3^m, if a ≡ 0 mod 3, then the equation has a unique solution modulo 3^{m}, because Hensel's lemma applies to simple roots.

But if a is not divisible by 3, then the number of solutions depends on whether a is a cubic residue modulo 3.

Wait, but modulo 3, as we saw, any a is a cubic residue because 0,1,2 are all cubes.

So, for a ≡ 0 mod 3, x^3 ≡ a mod 3^m has one solution. For a not divisible by 3, x^3 ≡ a mod 3^m has three solutions.

Wait, that seems to make sense because when lifting solutions from mod 3 to mod 9, each non-zero solution modulo 3 can be lifted uniquely, but since in mod 3, each non-zero a has three cube roots, do we have three solutions modulo 9?

Wait, let me test with a specific example. Let's take a=1. So, x^3 ≡1 mod 9.

Looking at numbers 1 to 8:

1^3=1, 4^3=64≡1, 7^3=343≡1. So, x=1,4,7 are the solutions mod9. So, indeed, three solutions.

Similarly, for a=8 mod9, x^3≡8 mod9. The solutions are 2,5,8 because 2^3=8,5^3=125≡8,8^3=512≡8.

So yes, for a≡1 or 8 mod9, which are non-zero mod3, we have three solutions each.

But for a≡0 mod3, say a=3, x^3≡3 mod9. Let's see:

0^3=0, 3^3=27≡0, 6^3=216≡0 mod9. So, x=0,3,6 are solutions.

Wait, so for a≡0 mod3, x^3≡a mod9 has three solutions as well.

Wait, so maybe my earlier statement is wrong. For a≡0 mod3, x^3≡a mod3^m has three solutions? But when m=1, we have x^3≡0 mod3, which has x≡0 mod3, which is one solution.

Wait, so for a≡0 mod3, x^3≡a mod3 has one solution, x≡0. Then, lifting to higher powers, how does it go?

I think in Hensel's lemma, when the derivative of the function is non-zero at the root, you can lift the solution uniquely. For f(x)=x^3 -a, f'(x)=3x^2. If a≡0 mod3, then x≡0 mod3, so f'(0)=0, which is a problem because Hensel's lemma requires the derivative to be non-zero.

So, in that case, when a≡0 mod3, x^3 ≡a mod3^m has multiple solutions?

Wait, in our case, when a=0 mod3, then x=0 mod3, but how does the number of solutions lift?

Wait, for x^3≡0 mod9, the solutions are x≡0 mod3, so x=0,3,6 mod9. So, three solutions.

Similarly, for x^3≡0 mod27, the solutions would be x≡0 mod3, so x=0,3,6,...,24 mod27, which are nine solutions.

Wait, so for a≡0 mod3, x^3≡a mod3^m has 3^{m-1} solutions?

Wait, for m=1: 3^{0}=1 solution, which is x≡0 mod3, correct.

For m=2: 3^{1}=3 solutions, x≡0,3,6 mod9, correct.

For m=3: 3^{2}=9 solutions, x≡0,3,6,...,24 mod27, correct.

So, yes, for a≡0 mod3, x^3≡a mod3^m has 3^{m-1} solutions.

For a not≡0 mod3, i.e., a≡1 or 2 mod3, then f'(x)=3x^2≡0 mod3, so Hensel's lemma doesn't apply directly. But in this case, for a≡1 or 2 mod3, we saw that mod9, there are 3 solutions each. So, for a≡1 or 2 mod3, the equation x^3≡a mod3^m has 3 solutions.

Wait, so generalizing:

If a ≡0 mod3, then x^3≡a mod3^m has 3^{m-1} solutions.

If a not≡0 mod3, then x^3≡a mod3^m has 3 solutions.

Is that right?

Let me verify for m=3.

Take a=1 mod9. Then, x^3≡1 mod27. Let's see how many solutions there are.

We know that mod9, x^3≡1 mod9 has solutions x=1,4,7. Now, lifting these to mod27.

For x≡1 mod3:

Let x=1 + 3k. Then, x^3 = (1 + 3k)^3 = 1 + 3*(3k) + 3*(3k)^2 + (3k)^3 = 1 + 9k + 27k^2 + 27k^3 ≡1 + 9k mod27.

Set this ≡1 mod27: 1 +9k ≡1 mod27 => 9k≡0 mod27 => k≡0 mod3. So, k=0,3,6,...,24? Wait, k must be less than 3, since x=1 +3k, and we're working mod27.

Wait, k is an integer such that x=1 +3k <27, so k=0,1,2,3,...,8. But x^3≡1 mod27 requires 9k≡0 mod27, which is k≡0 mod3. So, k=0,3,6. So, x=1,10,19 mod27.

Similarly, for x≡4 mod9:

Let x=4 +9k. Then x^3=64 + 3*16*9k + 3*4*81k^2 + 729k^3. Wait, maybe a better approach.

Alternatively, x=4 + 3k. Then, x^3=64 + 3*16*3k + 3*4*9k^2 + 27k^3.

Wait, 4^3=64≡1 mod27. So, (4 +3k)^3=64 + 3*16*3k + 3*4*9k^2 + 27k^3 ≡1 + 144k + 108k^2 +27k^3 mod27.

Simplify: 1 + (144 mod27)k + (108 mod27)k^2 + (27 mod27)k^3.

144 ÷27=5*27=135, 144-135=9. So, 144≡9 mod27.

108 ÷27=4, so 108≡0 mod27.

27≡0 mod27.

So, x^3≡1 +9k mod27. Set this ≡1 mod27: 1 +9k≡1 mod27 =>9k≡0 mod27 =>k≡0 mod3. So, k=0,3,6,... Again, since x=4 +3k, k must be 0,1,2,...,8.

So, k=0,3,6. Therefore, x=4,13,22 mod27.

Similarly, for x≡7 mod9:

x=7 +3k. Compute x^3:

7^3=343. 343 mod27: 27*12=324, 343-324=19. So, 343≡19 mod27.

Wait, 7 +3k: x^3= (7 +3k)^3 =343 + 3*49*3k + 3*7*9k^2 +27k^3.

Again, 343≡19 mod27.

Compute each term mod27:

343 ≡19 mod27.

3*49*3k= 147k ≡147-5*27=147-135=12, so 12k mod27.

3*7*9k^2=189k^2≡189-7*27=0, so 0 mod27.

27k^3≡0 mod27.

Thus, x^3≡19 +12k mod27. Set this ≡1 mod27:

19 +12k ≡1 mod27 =>12k≡-18≡9 mod27.

Divide both sides by GCD(12,27)=3: 4k≡3 mod9.

Multiplicative inverse of 4 mod9 is 7 because 4*7=28≡1 mod9.

So, k≡3*7=21≡3 mod9. So, k≡3 mod9. But since x=7 +3k, k must be 0,1,2,...,8.

So, k=3 is the only solution in this range. Thus, x=7 +9=16 mod27.

Wait, hold on, that's only one solution. But earlier, for x≡1,4,7 mod9, each gave 3 solutions mod27, but here, for x≡7 mod9, only one solution? That contradicts my earlier assumption.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, when x=7 + 3k, x^3≡19 +12k mod27.

Set equal to 1 mod27: 19 +12k≡1 =>12k≡-18≡9 mod27.

So, 12k ≡9 mod27.

Divide both sides by 3: 4k≡3 mod9.

So, 4k≡3 mod9. Multiply both sides by 7: k≡21≡3 mod9.

So, k=3,12,... But since k is mod9, k=3.

So, x=7 +3*3=16 mod27.

Is 16^3 ≡1 mod27?

16^3=4096. 4096 ÷27: 27*151=4077, 4096-4077=19. So, 16^3≡19 mod27≠1. Hmm, that's not 1. So, something's wrong.

Wait, maybe my computation is wrong. Let me compute 16^3 mod27.

16 mod27=16

16^2=256. 256 ÷27: 27*9=243, 256-243=13. So, 16^2≡13 mod27.

16^3=16*13=208. 208 ÷27=7*27=189, 208-189=19. So, 16^3≡19 mod27, which is consistent with the earlier result.

Wait, so 16^3≡19 mod27, not 1. So, how come x=16 is a solution for x^3≡19 mod27? Because x=16 is a solution for x^3≡19 mod27, but not for x^3≡1 mod27.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that x=7 +3k gives a solution for x^3≡1 mod27. It doesn't, so maybe the only solution for x^3≡19 mod27 is x=7 +9=16? But that only gives one solution.

Wait, but 7^3=343≡19 mod27, so x=7 is already a solution mod9, but lifting it to mod27 only gives x=16. So, perhaps for x≡7 mod9, x^3≡19 mod27, which is a different residue.

Wait, but in our earlier case, for a≡1 mod3, x^3≡a mod9 has three solutions, but when lifting to mod27, each of those solutions only gives one solution in mod27?

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust my approach. Perhaps for a≡1 mod3, x^3≡a mod3^m has 3 solutions for m=1, but for m≥2, each of those solutions can be lifted uniquely, so still 3 solutions?

But in the case of mod27, for a=1, x^3≡1 mod27 has only one solution, which is x=1. Wait, but earlier, when I considered x≡1 mod3, lifting x=1,4,7 mod9, each gave a unique solution mod27, but in reality, x=1 mod3, lifting x=1 mod9 gives x=1,10,19 mod27? Wait, no, earlier, when I did x=1 +3k, for x≡1 mod9.

Wait, perhaps I confused the lifting. Let me clarify.

Let me separate the cases:

Case 1: a ≡0 mod3.

Then, x^3 ≡0 mod3^m has 3^{m-1} solutions.

Case 2: a ≡1 or 2 mod3.

Then, x^3≡a mod3^m has 3 solutions.

But in the specific case of m=2, we saw that for a=1 mod3, x^3≡1 mod9 has three solutions: 1,4,7. Then, lifting each of these to mod27, each can be lifted uniquely, so for each of the three solutions mod9, we have one solution mod27.

Wait, so for a≡1 mod3, x^3≡a mod3^m has 3 solutions for all m≥1.

Similarly, for a≡2 mod3, x^3≡a mod3^m has 3 solutions for all m≥1.

But in the case of a≡1 mod3, lifting from mod9 to mod27, each of the three solutions mod9 gives one solution mod27. So, in total, 3 solutions.

Similarly, for a≡1 mod3, in mod3^m, there are 3 solutions.

Wait, so that would mean for m=2, 3 solutions mod9, each lifting to 1 solution mod27, so 3 solutions in total.

But earlier, when I tried to compute x≡7 mod9, lifting to mod27, I only found one solution, x=16. But maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think.

If I have x≡7 mod9, which is a solution to x^3≡19 mod27. So, if I set a=19, which is 1 mod3, then x^3≡19 mod27. How many solutions does this have?

Well, in mod27, does x^3≡19 mod27 have only one solution?

Wait, let's compute 7^3=343≡19 mod27.

16^3=4096≡19 mod27, as above.

25^3=15625. 15625 ÷27: 27*578=15606, 15625-15606=19. So, 25^3≡19 mod27.

Wait, so 7,16,25 mod27 are all solutions to x^3≡19 mod27.

Wait, that's three solutions. So, x=7,16,25 mod27.

So, that's consistent with the idea that for a≡1 mod3, x^3≡a mod3^m has 3 solutions.

So, my earlier mistake was that I thought x=16 is a solution for x^3≡1 mod27, but actually, x=16 is a solution for x^3≡19 mod27.

So, in general, for a≡1 or 2 mod3, x^3≡a mod3^m has 3 solutions.

Therefore, in our problem, for each a, depending on a mod3, the number of solutions x mod3^7 is:

- If a≡0 mod3, x^3≡a mod3^7 has 3^{7-1}=3^6=729 solutions.

- If a≡1 or 2 mod3, x^3≡a mod3^7 has 3 solutions.

So, for each a, the number of x such that x^3 ≡a mod3^7 is either 3 or 729, depending on whether a is 0 mod3 or not.

But in our problem, we have three variables a, b, c. So, the total number of triples (a,b,c) such that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 ≡0 mod3^7 is equal to the convolution of the number of solutions for each a, b, c.

Wait, more formally, the number N is the sum over all a,b,c of [x^3≡a] * [y^3≡b] * [z^3≡c], where [x^3≡a] is 1 if x^3≡a mod3^7, else 0.

But since each a, b, c can be considered independently, the total number N is equal to the product of the number of possible x, y, z for each a, b, c.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because N is the number of triples (a,b,c) such that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 ≡0 mod3^7.

So, it's the number of triples where the sum of their cubes is 0 mod3^7.

So, to compute N, we can think of it as the sum over all a, b, c of the indicator function that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 ≡0 mod3^7.

Alternatively, using generating functions, as I thought before.

Let me define a generating function F(t) = sum_{x=1}^{3^7} t^{x^3 mod3^7}.

Then, the number N is the coefficient of t^0 in F(t)^3, considering the exponents modulo3^7.

But computing this directly is not feasible.

Alternatively, using the orthogonality of characters, we can write:

N = (1/3^7) * sum_{k=0}^{3^7 -1} (sum_{x=1}^{3^7} e^{2πi k x^3 /3^7})^3.

But this is getting into more complex territory, perhaps using discrete Fourier transforms.

But maybe there's a simpler way.

Given that for each a, the number of x such that x^3 ≡a mod3^7 is either 3 or 729, depending on a.

So, let me define f(a) as the number of x such that x^3 ≡a mod3^7.

Then, f(a)=729 if a≡0 mod3,

f(a)=3 if a≡1 or 2 mod3.

So, f(a) is a function that is 729 for a≡0 mod3, and 3 otherwise.

Then, the total number N is the sum over all a,b,c such that a + b + c ≡0 mod3^7 of f(a)f(b)f(c).

But wait, no, that's not exactly the case.

Wait, actually, N is the sum over a,b,c where a^3 + b^3 + c^3 ≡0 mod3^7 of 1.

But since x^3 ≡a has f(a) solutions, then for each a, b, c such that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 ≡0 mod3^7, the number of triples (x,y,z) is f(a)f(b)f(c). So, N = sum_{a,b,c} [a^3 + b^3 + c^3 ≡0 mod3^7] * f(a)f(b)f(c).

But this seems complicated. Maybe using generating functions is still the way to go.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that the number of solutions is equal to the convolution of f(a), f(b), f(c) evaluated at 0.

But perhaps instead of thinking in terms of a, b, c, we can model this as the sum over all x,y,z of [x^3 + y^3 + z^3 ≡0 mod3^7], which can be written using roots of unity.

Specifically, using the orthogonality of characters, we can write:

N = (1/3^7) * sum_{k=0}^{3^7 -1} (sum_{x=1}^{3^7} e^{2πi k x^3 /3^7})^3 * e^{-2πi k *0 /3^7}.

But since e^{-2πi k *0} =1, this simplifies to N = (1/3^7) * sum_{k=0}^{3^7 -1} (F(k))^3, where F(k) = sum_{x=1}^{3^7} e^{2πi k x^3 /3^7}.

But computing F(k) for each k is non-trivial.

However, for our purposes, maybe we can compute F(k) for k=0 and other k's where k is not 0 modulo3.

Because when k≡0 mod3, then F(k) is sum_{x=1}^{3^7} e^{0} =3^7.

But when k≡1 or 2 mod3, F(k) can be computed more cleverly.

Wait, let's consider k=0 mod3^m for some m. But perhaps we can use some properties.

Alternatively, since 3 is a prime, maybe the function F(k) can be evaluated using Gauss sums or something similar.

Wait, Gauss sums usually deal with multiplicative characters and additive characters, but in this case, it's a cubic character.

Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of multiplicative functions.

Wait, another approach: Since the function x^3 is a bijection modulo3^m when m=1, but not for higher m? Wait, no, for m>1, the function x^3 is not a bijection because, for example, both x and x + 3^m are mapped to the same cube.

Wait, actually, the mapping x →x^3 modulo3^m is not a bijection for m>1.

But from our earlier analysis, we saw that for each non-zero a≡1 or 2 mod3, there are three solutions x to x^3≡a, and for a≡0 mod3, there are 3^{m-1} solutions.

So, for each a, the number of x with x^3≡a is either 3 or 3^{m-1}.

But in our case, m=7, so f(a)=3^{7-1}=3^6=729 if a≡0 mod3, and f(a)=3 otherwise.

So, for each a, f(a)=3^6 if a≡0 mod3, else f(a)=3.

So, N = sum_{a,b,c} [a^3 + b^3 + c^3 ≡0 mod3^7] * f(a)f(b)f(c).

But how do we compute this?

Wait, maybe we can use the fact that the number of solutions is equal to the sum over all x,y,z of [x^3 + y^3 + z^3 ≡0 mod3^7], which can be expressed using additive characters.

But perhaps, instead of trying to compute it directly, we can think in terms of the expectation.

But maybe a generating function approach is better.

Define G(t) = sum_{x=1}^{3^7} t^{x^3 mod3^7}.

Then, the number of solutions N is the coefficient of t^0 in G(t)^3.

But computing G(t) is difficult.

Alternatively, use the fact that G(t) can be expressed as a sum over additive characters.

Wait, another idea: Since the number of solutions is multiplicative, maybe we can compute the number of solutions modulo3^7 as the product of the number of solutions modulo3, 3^2, ..., up to 3^7.

But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, actually, in general, for equations over p-adic integers, sometimes solutions can be lifted uniquely, but in this case, we have a constraint on the sum of three cubes.

Wait, perhaps the number of solutions is (3^7)^2, because for each a and b, there is a unique c such that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 ≡0 mod3^7. But that would give N=(3^7)^2=3^{14}, but that's likely incorrect because c is restricted to integers from1 to3^7, and each cube is taken mod3^7.

Wait, that would be the case if the mapping were bijective, but it's not. Because multiple x can map to the same x^3.

Wait, but if for each a and b, c is uniquely determined mod3^7, but since c must be in the range 1 to3^7, which is exactly the modulus, then for each a and b, there is exactly one c in that range such that a^3 + b^3 +c^3 ≡0 mod3^7.

Therefore, N=(3^7)^2=3^{14}.

But hold on, is that correct?

Wait, for each a and b, there is a unique c mod3^7 such that c^3≡-a^3 -b^3 mod3^7.

Since c is in the range1 to3^7, which are exactly the residues mod3^7, then yes, for each a and b, there exists exactly one c in that range such that c^3≡-a^3 -b^3 mod3^7.

Therefore, the number of solutions N is (3^7)^2=3^{14}.

But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I feel like I might be missing something because the problem is about counting triples (a,b,c) with a,b,c ≤3^7. But if we fix a and b, then c is uniquely determined modulo3^7, but c can range up to3^7, so there is exactly one c in that range for each a and b.

Therefore, N=(3^7)^2=3^{14}.

But in that case, N=3^{14}=4782969. Then, N mod1000 is 769.

Wait, but that seems too easy, and the problem mentions a, b, c≤3^6, not 3^7. Wait, no, it says a,b,c ≤3^6, but the modulus is3^7.

Wait, so for each a,b,c in1 to3^6, we need a^3 + b^3 +c^3≡0 mod3^7.

But since 3^7=2187, and a,b,c ≤729, we need to count the number of triples (a,b,c) where a,b,c are in1 to729, and a^3 +b^3 +c^3≡0 mod2187.

But according to the earlier reasoning, since for each a and b, there is exactly one c in1 to2187 such that c^3≡-a^3 -b^3 mod2187, but since c must be in1 to729, it's not necessarily the case that for each a and b, there is a c in1 to729 that satisfies the equation.

Wait, so the earlier reasoning that N=(3^7)^2=3^{14} counts all triples where a,b,c range over1 to3^7=2187, but in our problem, a,b,c are only up to3^6=729.

Therefore, we need to adjust the count.

So, the number of triples (a,b,c) in1 to729 with a^3 +b^3 +c^3≡0 mod2187.

So, it's not the full number, but a subset.

Therefore, my earlier conclusion that N=3^{14} is incorrect because it counts all triples in1 to2187, but we only want a,b,c in1 to729.

So, perhaps I need a different approach.

Wait, maybe we can think in terms of the multiplicative inverses.

Wait, considering the mapping (a,b) ↦ (a^3 +b^3) mod2187.

Then, for each possible value of a^3 +b^3 mod2187, we can see how many c's in1 to729 satisfy c^3≡ - (a^3 +b^3) mod2187.

But each c is uniquely determined modulo2187, but whether c is ≤729 is another question.

So, for each a and b, the value of c^3 ≡- (a^3 +b^3) mod2187 may have multiple solutions c in1 to2187, but we only want those c's in1 to729.

So, for each (a,b), how many c's in1 to729 satisfy c^3≡k mod2187, where k= - (a^3 +b^3) mod2187.

Therefore, N is the number of (a,b,c) where a,b,c ∈1 to729 and c^3≡- (a^3 +b^3) mod2187.

So, N = sum_{a=1}^{729} sum_{b=1}^{729} sum_{c=1}^{729} [c^3 ≡ - (a^3 +b^3) mod2187].

So, N = sum_{a=1}^{729} sum_{b=1}^{729} (number of c ∈1 to729 with c^3≡- (a^3 +b^3) mod2187).

So, for each a and b, let’s denote k= - (a^3 +b^3) mod2187.

Then, the number of c in1 to729 such that c^3≡k mod2187.

So, if k is a cube residue mod2187, then the number of solutions c is equal to the number of cube roots of k in1 to729.

But earlier, we saw that for modulus3^7, the number of solutions x^3≡a mod3^7 is 3 if a≡0 mod3 and 729 otherwise.

But in our case, c is restricted to1 to729, which is exactly the range of numbers less than or equal to3^6. So, for modulus3^7, the number of cube roots of k in1 to729 is either 0 or 3.

Wait, because if k is a cube residue mod3^7, then in the range1 to3^7, there are either 3 or729 solutions. But in the range1 to3^6, how many solutions?

Wait, for each cube residue k mod3^7, the solutions c are spread out over the modulus. Since the mapping x ↦x^3 mod3^7 is 3-to-1 for non-zero residues (since there are3^{7-1}=729 solutions for x^3≡k when k≡1 or 2 mod3), but in the range1 to3^6, how many of these 729 solutions lie?

Wait, since 3^7=2187 and3^6=729, and the solutions are spread periodically every3^6 numbers, perhaps each residue mod3^6 has 3 solutions in1 to3^7.

But maybe not. Wait, actually, since the solutions are x ≡c mod3^6, because when you cube x, if x is congruent mod3^6, then x^3 is congruent mod3^{18}, but our modulus is only3^7.

Wait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.

Let’s consider k ≡0 mod3. Then, the equation c^3≡k mod3^7 has729 solutions. So, how many of these are in1 to729?

Each solution c is congruent to some x mod3^{7}. But x can be written as x = y + m*3^6, where m=0,1,2.

So, for each solution c in1 to3^7, it's of the form c= y + m*3^6, m=0,1,2, y ∈1 to3^6.

Therefore, in1 to3^7, there are exactly3 solutions for each cube residue k≡0 mod3.

Similarly, for k≡1 or 2 mod3, which have729 solutions in1 to3^7, each residue class mod3^6 has exactly one solution in1 to3^7.

Wait, no, maybe for k≡1 or2 mod3, the equation c^3≡k mod3^7 has729 solutions, which are spread over the modulus.

But since we're restricting c to1 to3^6, which is exactly one period of the solutions, each residue mod3^{7}/3^6=3 has exactly one solution in1 to3^6.

Wait, no, maybe this is the other way.

Wait, think about k fixed. For k≡1 or2 mod3, the equation c^3≡k mod3^7 has729 solutions. Each of these solutions is congruent to some c mod3^7, and since3^7=3*3^6, each residue mod3^6 lifts to3 solutions mod3^7.

Therefore, in1 to3^7, for each cube residue k≡1 or2 mod3, there are3 solutions in each block of3^6. So, in1 to3^6, there is exactly1 solution, and similarly in3^6 +1 to2*3^6, and2*3^6 +1 to3^7, each with1 solution.

Therefore, for k≡1 or2 mod3, the number of solutions c in1 to3^6 is1.

Similarly, for k≡0 mod3, the equation c^3≡k mod3^7 has729 solutions, which are spread over3 blocks of3^6, so in each block, there are729 /3=243 solutions.

Wait, 729 solutions over3 blocks, so243 per block.

Therefore, in1 to3^6, the number of solutions c withc^3≡k mod3^7 is243 if k≡0 mod3, and1 if k≡1 or2 mod3.

Therefore, going back to N.

N = sum_{a=1}^{729} sum_{b=1}^{729} [number of c ∈1 to729 withc^3≡ - (a^3 +b^3) mod2187].

Let’s denote k= - (a^3 +b^3) mod2187.

Then, the number of c's is:

- If k≡0 mod3, then243 c's.

- If k≡1 or2 mod3, then1 c.

Therefore, we can write N =243 * M +1 * (729^2 - M), where M is the number of pairs (a,b) such thatk= - (a^3 +b^3)≡0 mod3.

Because, for each pair (a,b), ifk≡0 mod3, we have243 c's, else1 c.

So, N=243*M + (729^2 - M)*1=243M +729^2 -M=729^2 +242M.

But to find M, the number of pairs (a,b) such that - (a^3 +b^3)≡0 mod3, which is equivalent to a^3 +b^3≡0 mod3.

But since a and b are from1 to729, which is3^6, and we know that a^3 mod3 is equal to a mod3.

Because for any integer x, x^3≡x mod3.

Wait, is that true?

Let me check:

0^3≡0 mod3,

1^3≡1 mod3,

2^3=8≡2 mod3,

3≡0, 4≡1, 5≡2, etc.

Yes, indeed, for any integer x, x^3≡x mod3.

Therefore, a^3 ≡a mod3, and similarly b^3≡b mod3.

Therefore, a^3 +b^3 ≡a +b mod3.

Therefore, a^3 +b^3≡0 mod3 if and only if a +b≡0 mod3.

Therefore, M is the number of pairs (a,b) witha,b ∈1 to729 and a +b≡0 mod3.

So, to find M, we need to count the number of such pairs.

Since a and b are from1 to729, which is a multiple of3, specifically3^6.

In each block of3 consecutive numbers, exactly one is ≡0 mod3, one≡1, one≡2.

Therefore, in1 to729, there are729/3=243 numbers≡0 mod3,243≡1,243≡2.

Therefore, the number of pairs (a,b) witha≡0, b≡0:243*243.

Similarly, pairs witha≡1,b≡2:243*243.

Pairs witha≡2,b≡1:243*243.

Therefore, total M=243^2 +243^2 +243^2=3*(243^2).

Wait, no, because a +b≡0 mod3 can happen in three ways:

a≡0,b≡0,

a≡1,b≡2,

a≡2,b≡1.

Each of these contributes 243*243 pairs.

Therefore, M=243^2 +243^2 +243^2=3*243^2=3*(243)^2.

Compute that:

243^2=59049,

3*59049=177147.

Therefore, M=177147.

Therefore, plugging back into N:

N=729^2 +242*M=729^2 +242*177147.

Compute729^2:

729*729: 700^2=490000, 29^2=841, 2*700*29=40600, so (700+29)^2=490000 +40600 +841=531441.

Therefore,729^2=531441.

Compute242*177147:

First, compute177147 *200=35,429,400,

177147 *40=7,085,880,

177147 *2=354,294.

Adding them together:

35,429,400 +7,085,880=42,515,280,

42,515,280 +354,294=42,869,574.

Therefore,242*177147=42,869,574.

Therefore, N=531,441 +42,869,574=43,399,015.

Wait, 531,441 +42,869,574:

42,869,574 +500,000=43,369,574,

43,369,574 +31,441=43,401,015.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, 531,441 +42,869,574:

42,869,574 +500,000=43,369,574,

43,369,574 +31,441=43,401,015.

Yes, that's correct.

So, N=43,401,015.

But wait, 43,401,015 divided by1000 gives a remainder of1015, but 1015 mod1000 is15.

Wait, but N=43,401,015, so mod1000 is015.

But wait, 43,401,015 divided by1000 is43,401 with remainder15.

Therefore, N mod1000=15.

But let me double-check my calculations because the number seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me verify the steps.

First, M was the number of pairs (a,b) witha +b≡0 mod3, which is3*(243)^2=3*59049=177147.

Then, N=729^2 +242*M=531441 +242*177147.

Compute242*177147:

177,147 *200=35,429,400,

177,147 *40=7,085,880,

177,147 *2=354,294.

Adding:35,429,400 +7,085,880=42,515,280,

42,515,280 +354,294=42,869,574.

Then, N=531,441 +42,869,574=43,399,015.

Wait, adding 531,441 +42,869,574:

42,869,574 +500,000=43,369,574,

43,369,574 +31,441=43,401,015.

Wait, 531,441 is500,000 +31,441.

So, 42,869,574 +500,000=43,369,574,

43,369,574 +31,441=43,401,015.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, N=43,401,015. So, N mod1000=1015 mod1000=15.

But wait, the problem is asking for the remainder when N is divided by1000, so it's15.

But I feel like this is too straightforward, and I might have made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, another way to look at it is: we're counting the number of (a,b,c) in [1,729]^3 such that a^3 +b^3 +c^3≡0 mod2187.

But 729=3^6, so 729^3=3^{18}.

But2187=3^7.

So, the equation a^3 +b^3 +c^3≡0 mod3^7.

But we can model this as a problem in additive combinatorics, perhaps using the fact that the equation is linear in the exponents.

Wait, but maybe not.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of probability: For each triple (a,b,c), the probability that a^3 +b^3 +c^3≡0 mod3^7 is roughly1/3^7, since the residues are uniformly distributed.

But since a,b,c are in the range1 to3^6, maybe the distribution isn't uniform.

But in our case, we actually computed N=43,401,015, which is(3^6)^3 +242*(3^6)^2 /3.

Wait, 3^6=729, so N=729^3 +242*729^2 /3.

Wait, 729^3=3^{18}, 242*729^2 /3=242*3^{12}=242*531441=128,558, 122? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, notice that N=729^2*(729 +242)=729^2*971.

But that might not help.

Wait, but in any case, I think my previous calculation is correct.

Therefore, the remainder when N is divided by1000 is15.

So, the answer is15.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{15}
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) such that \(a, b, c \leq 3^6\) and \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\) is a multiple of \(3^7\). We then need to find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.

First, we recognize that the problem involves counting the number of solutions to \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3^7}\) where \(a, b, c \leq 3^6\). 

We start by analyzing the number of solutions to \(x^3 \equiv a \pmod{3^7}\). For each \(a\), the number of solutions \(x\) modulo \(3^7\) depends on \(a\):
- If \(a \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\), there are \(3^{6}\) solutions.
- Otherwise, there are 3 solutions.

Next, we consider the number of pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(- (a^3 + b^3) \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\). This is equivalent to \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\). We count the number of such pairs:
- There are \(243\) numbers congruent to 0, 1, and 2 modulo 3 in the range 1 to \(3^6\).
- The number of pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\) is \(3 \times 243^2 = 177147\).

Using these counts, we compute the number of valid triples \((a, b, c)\):
- For each pair \((a, b)\) where \(- (a^3 + b^3) \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\), there are \(243^2\) valid \(c\).
- For each pair \((a, b)\) where \(- (a^3 + b^3) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3}\), there is 1 valid \(c\).

Thus, the total number of valid triples \(N\) is:
\[ N = 729^2 + 242 \times 177147 \]

Calculating this:
- \(729^2 = 531441\)
- \(242 \times 177147 = 42869574\)
- Adding these, we get \(N = 531441 + 42869574 = 43401015\)

Finally, we find the remainder when \(43401015\) is divided by 1000:
\[ 43401015 \mod 1000 = 15 \]

Thus, the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{15}\).
