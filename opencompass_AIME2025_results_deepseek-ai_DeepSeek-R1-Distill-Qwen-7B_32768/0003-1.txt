Question:
A piecewise linear periodic function is defined by $f(x)=\begin{cases}x&\text{if }x\in[-1,1)\\2-x&\text{if }x\in[1,3)\end{cases}$ and $f(x+4)=f(x)$ for all real numbers $x$. The graph of $f(x)$ has the sawtooth pattern. The parabola $x=34y^2$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at finitely many points. The sum of the $y$-coordinates of these intersection points can be expressed in the form $\frac{a+b\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a,b,c,$ and $d$ are positive integers, $a,b,$ and $d$ have greatest common divisor equal to 1, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b+c+d$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the y-coordinates where the parabola \( x = 34y^2 \) intersects the piecewise linear periodic function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is defined in a specific way and is periodic with period 4. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the function \( f(x) \). It's given as:

\[
f(x) = \begin{cases}
x & \text{if } x \in [-1, 1) \\
2 - x & \text{if } x \in [1, 3)
\end{cases}
\]

and \( f(x + 4) = f(x) \) for all real \( x \). So, this is a periodic function with period 4. The function is linear in each interval, so it should form a sawtooth pattern. Let me sketch this out mentally.

From \( x = -1 \) to \( x = 1 \), the function is \( f(x) = x \), which is a straight line increasing from (-1, -1) to (1, 1). Then, from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), it's \( f(x) = 2 - x \), which is a straight line decreasing from (1, 1) to (3, -1). Since it's periodic with period 4, this pattern repeats every 4 units along the x-axis.

So, over the interval \( [-1, 3) \), the function is a peak at (1,1) and valleys at (-1, -1) and (3, -1). Then it repeats every 4 units.

Now, the parabola given is \( x = 34y^2 \). That's a standard parabola that opens to the right, with vertex at the origin (0,0). It's symmetric about the x-axis because for each \( y \), there's a corresponding \( -y \). So, for each intersection point, there will be another one with the same x-coordinate but opposite y-coordinate. This suggests that when I find these intersection points, the sum of their y-coordinates might be zero? But wait, the problem says the sum can be expressed in a specific form, so maybe I need to check.

But before jumping to conclusions, let me actually see.

First, since \( f(x) \) is periodic with period 4, and the parabola is defined for all real numbers, the intersections will occur periodically as well. So, perhaps I can find the intersections within one period and then extend that.

But since the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, but in this case, it's \( x = 34y^2 \), which is symmetric about the x-axis. So, for each positive y, there's a corresponding negative y with the same x. Therefore, the intersection points come in pairs \( (x, y) \) and \( (x, -y) \), unless y is zero.

But wait, since \( f(x) \) is defined piecewise, it's a sawtooth, but let me check if it ever crosses the parabola at y=0. Let's see, when y=0, x=0. What is f(0)? Looking at the function definition, since 0 is in [-1,1), f(0)=0. So, yes, (0, 0) is an intersection point. Therefore, the intersection point at y=0 is unique.

But the parabola is \( x = 34y^2 \), so for each y, x is determined, and thus each y corresponds to an x, which in turn corresponds to f(x). So, to find the intersections, we need to solve \( f(x) = y \) and \( x = 34y^2 \).

Wait, actually, to clarify, the parabola is \( x = 34y^2 \), so for each x, y can be positive or negative. But when we solve for intersections, we can think of plugging \( x = 34y^2 \) into \( f(x) \), so we get \( f(34y^2) = y \). But since \( f(x) \) is periodic, it's defined for all x, but in terms of y, which can be any real number, but \( f(x) \) is a function where for each x, there's a corresponding y.

But actually, for each x, y is determined by the parabola equation \( y = \pm \sqrt{x/34} \). So, to find the points of intersection, we need to find all x such that \( f(x) = \sqrt{x/34} \) or \( f(x) = -\sqrt{x/34} \). So, essentially, for each x, check if \( f(x) \) equals either the positive or negative square root of x over 34.

But since \( f(x) \) is periodic, with period 4, and the parabola is defined for all real numbers, we can expect the intersections to occur in each period. So, perhaps we can find the number of intersections in one period and then multiply, but we need to be cautious because the parabola's equation might only intersect a finite number of times in each period.

Wait, but since the parabola is symmetric and f(x) is periodic, maybe we can find all the intersections within one period and then see if they repeat in other periods.

Let me consider one period of f(x), say from x = -1 to x = 3. Because from x = -1 to x = 1, f(x) = x, and from x = 1 to x = 3, f(x) = 2 - x. Then, it repeats every 4 units.

So, let me first consider the interval x ∈ [-1, 3). Within this interval, f(x) is piecewise linear. So, to find the intersections, I can solve \( f(x) = \sqrt{x/34} \) and \( f(x) = -\sqrt{x/34} \) for x in [-1, 3). Then, since the function is periodic, any solutions found in this interval will have solutions in other intervals as well, shifted by multiples of 4.

But wait, hold on. Because the parabola is \( x = 34y^2 \), which is defined for all real x, but we need to ensure that the x-values where f(x) intersects the parabola are such that \( x = 34y^2 \) is non-negative because \( y^2 \) is always non-negative. So, x must be non-negative. So, the intersections can only occur where x is non-negative. Therefore, in each period, we only look at the right half, from x = 0 to x = 4, but actually, since the period is 4, starting from x = -1 to x = 3, but since x must be non-negative, the first period where x is non-negative starts at x = 0.

Wait, actually, let me think again. The function f(x) is defined for all real numbers, but the parabola is only defined for x ≥ 0, because x = 34y^2 must be non-negative. Therefore, the intersections can only happen in x ≥ 0. So, we can limit our consideration to x ≥ 0.

Therefore, in the interval x ∈ [0, 3), we have f(x) defined as:

- From x = 0 to x = 1: f(x) = x

- From x = 1 to x = 3: f(x) = 2 - x

And beyond x = 3, the pattern repeats every 4 units. So, in x ∈ [3, 4), f(x) = f(x - 4), which is f(x - 4) = (x - 4) if x - 4 ∈ [-1, 1), which would be x ∈ [3, 5). But since we are looking for x ≥ 0, let's see.

But wait, the function is periodic, so for x ≥ 0, the function repeats every 4 units. So, in [0, 4), it's the same as the original f(x) in [-1, 3). Then, in [4, 8), it's the same as [0, 4), and so on.

But since the parabola is only defined for x ≥ 0, but it extends infinitely. So, the intersections can occur in each interval [4k, 4k + 4) for k = 0,1,2,... until the parabola's x becomes too large for f(x) to reach it.

But how high does x go? Since f(x) is a periodic function, it oscillates between -1 and 1, but wait, no. Wait, hold on. Wait, no, f(x) is a sawtooth function.

Wait, in the interval [-1,1), f(x) = x, which goes from -1 to 1. Then, in [1,3), f(x) = 2 - x, which goes from 1 to -1. So, f(x) actually oscillates between -1 and 1, with period 4.

Wait, no, wait. f(x) is a sawtooth function that goes from -1 to 1 over each interval of length 2, but since it's periodic with period 4, it's a combination of two such sawteeth.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, hold on, the function is defined as x in [-1,1), 2 - x in [1,3), and then repeats every 4 units. So, over the interval [-1, 3), it goes from -1 to 1, then back down to -1. So, over the interval [3,7), it's the same as [-1,3), so it's another cycle.

But since f(x) is bounded between -1 and 1, because in each interval it goes from -1 to 1 or 1 to -1.

Wait, hold on, f(x) is defined as x in [-1,1), which is from -1 to 1, then 2 - x in [1,3), which is from 1 to -1. So, yes, f(x) is bounded between -1 and 1. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is 1, and the minimum is -1.

But the parabola is \( x = 34y^2 \), which is a right-opening parabola. So, for each x, y can be sqrt(x/34) or -sqrt(x/34). But since f(x) is bounded between -1 and 1, the y-values must satisfy |f(x)| ≤ 1. Therefore, \( |y| = |f(x)| \leq 1 \), so \( |y| \leq 1 \), which means \( x = 34y^2 \leq 34(1)^2 = 34 \). So, the intersections can only occur for x ≤ 34, because beyond that, the parabola would require |y| > 1, but f(x) cannot exceed 1 in magnitude.

Therefore, the intersections occur only in the interval x ∈ [0, 34]. So, since the function is periodic with period 4, we can divide the interval [0,34] into segments of length 4, and find the intersections in each segment.

But 34 divided by 4 is 8.5, so we have 8 full periods from x=0 to x=32, and a half period from x=32 to x=34.

But actually, x=34 is beyond 32, which is 8*4, so x=34 is 2 units beyond x=32. But since the function is periodic with period 4, the behavior from x=32 to x=34 is the same as from x=0 to x=2. So, perhaps we can model the intersections in [0,4) and then multiply accordingly, but adjusting for the last half period.

But wait, let me think again.

First, let's consider the interval [0,4). Within this, f(x) is defined as:

- From x=0 to x=1: f(x) = x

- From x=1 to x=3: f(x) = 2 - x

- From x=3 to x=4: f(x) = f(x - 4) = (x - 4), since x - 4 ∈ [-1,1) when x ∈ [3,5). But wait, in x ∈ [3,4), x - 4 ∈ [-1, 0), so f(x) = x - 4.

So, in [3,4), f(x) = x - 4.

Wait, but in [3,4), x - 4 is between -1 and 0, so f(x) = x - 4. So, in [3,4), f(x) is a line from (3, -1) to (4, 0).

So, in [0,4), f(x) is:

- [0,1): f(x) = x

- [1,3): f(x) = 2 - x

- [3,4): f(x) = x - 4

So, to find intersections with the parabola \( x = 34y^2 \), we have two cases for each x: \( y = f(x) \) and \( y = -f(x) \). But since \( x = 34y^2 \), for each x, y can be sqrt(x/34) or -sqrt(x/34). So, for each x, if f(x) = sqrt(x/34) or f(x) = -sqrt(x/34), then that's an intersection point.

Therefore, we can write equations:

1. \( f(x) = \sqrt{x/34} \)
2. \( f(x) = -\sqrt{x/34} \)

And solve for x in [0,4), and then since the function repeats every 4 units, the solutions will be at x = solution + 4k for integer k such that x remains in [0,34].

So, first, let's handle the interval [0,4).

Case 1: x ∈ [0,1)

Here, f(x) = x.

So, equation 1 becomes:

\( x = \sqrt{x/34} \)

Equation 2 becomes:

\( x = -\sqrt{x/34} \)

But since x ∈ [0,1), x is non-negative. So, equation 2 would imply x = -sqrt(x/34), but sqrt(x/34) is non-negative, so x must be negative, which contradicts x ∈ [0,1). Therefore, in this interval, equation 2 has no solutions.

So, only equation 1 is relevant here.

So, equation 1: \( x = \sqrt{x/34} \)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

\( x^2 = x / 34 \)

Multiply both sides by 34:

\( 34x^2 = x \)

Bring all terms to one side:

\( 34x^2 - x = 0 \)

Factor:

\( x(34x - 1) = 0 \)

So, x = 0 or x = 1/34.

x = 0 is a solution, but it's at the boundary of the interval [0,1). So, x = 0 is included.

x = 1/34 ≈ 0.0294, which is in [0,1), so that's another solution.

Therefore, in [0,1), we have two solutions: x=0 and x=1/34.

But wait, x=0: f(0) = 0, and the parabola at x=0 is y=0, so that's consistent.

x=1/34: f(1/34) = 1/34, so y = ±1/34, but in this case, equation 1: y = sqrt(x/34) = sqrt( (1/34)/34 ) = sqrt(1/1156) = 1/34. So, that's one solution.

But actually, wait, in this interval, x ∈ [0,1), so f(x) = x, which is positive, and the parabola is x = 34y^2, so y = ±sqrt(x/34). So, in equation 1, we have f(x) = sqrt(x/34), which is positive, so x is positive, so that's okay.

But equation 2: f(x) = -sqrt(x/34), but in this interval, f(x) is positive, so equation 2 would have no solutions here.

So, in [0,1), two solutions: x=0 and x=1/34.

But wait, when x=0, y=0, and that's the point (0,0). When x=1/34, y=1/34. So, two intersection points.

Case 2: x ∈ [1,3)

Here, f(x) = 2 - x.

So, equation 1 becomes:

\( 2 - x = \sqrt{x/34} \)

Equation 2 becomes:

\( 2 - x = -\sqrt{x/34} \)

So, let's solve equation 1 first.

Equation 1:

\( 2 - x = \sqrt{x/34} \)

Let me square both sides:

\( (2 - x)^2 = x/34 \)

Expand the left side:

\( 4 - 4x + x^2 = x/34 \)

Bring all terms to one side:

\( x^2 - 4x + 4 - x/34 = 0 \)

Multiply through by 34 to eliminate the fraction:

\( 34x^2 - 136x + 136 - x = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( 34x^2 - 137x + 136 = 0 \)

So, quadratic equation: 34x² -137x +136=0.

Let me compute discriminant D:

D = (-137)^2 - 4*34*136

Compute each part:

137^2: 137*137. Let's calculate:

130^2 = 16900

130*7*2 = 1820

7^2 = 49

So, (130 +7)^2 = 16900 + 1820 + 49 = 16900 + 1820 is 18720, plus 49 is 18769.

So, D = 18769 - 4*34*136.

Compute 4*34 = 136, 136*136.

136^2: 130^2 + 2*130*6 + 6^2 = 16900 + 1560 + 36 = 16900 + 1560 is 18460, plus 36 is 18496.

So, D = 18769 - 18496 = 273.

So, discriminant is 273. So, roots are:

x = [137 ± sqrt(273)] / (2*34) = [137 ± sqrt(273)] / 68.

Compute sqrt(273). 16^2=256, 17^2=289, so sqrt(273)= approx 16.52, but exact value is sqrt(273).

So, x = (137 ± sqrt(273))/68.

Now, we need to check if these solutions lie in [1,3).

First, compute (137 + sqrt(273))/68:

sqrt(273) ≈16.52, so 137 + 16.52 ≈153.52, divided by 68 ≈2.257.

Similarly, (137 - sqrt(273))/68 ≈(137 - 16.52)/68≈120.48/68≈1.769.

So, both solutions are approximately 1.769 and 2.257, which are in [1,3). So, both are valid.

So, equation 1 gives two solutions in [1,3): x≈1.769 and x≈2.257.

Now, equation 2:

\( 2 - x = -\sqrt{x/34} \)

So, bringing the sqrt to the other side:

\( 2 - x + \sqrt{x/34} = 0 \)

But let me rearrange it:

\( 2 - x = -\sqrt{x/34} \)

Multiply both sides by -1:

\( x - 2 = \sqrt{x/34} \)

Now, square both sides:

\( (x - 2)^2 = x/34 \)

Expand the left side:

\( x² - 4x + 4 = x/34 \)

Bring all terms to one side:

\( x² - 4x + 4 - x/34 = 0 \)

Multiply through by 34:

\( 34x² - 136x + 136 - x = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( 34x² - 137x + 136 = 0 \)

Wait, that's the same quadratic equation as before! So, this equation reduces to the same quadratic equation.

But wait, that can't be, right? Because equation 2 is different.

Wait, hold on, in equation 2, we have:

\( 2 - x = -\sqrt{x/34} \)

Which is equivalent to:

\( x - 2 = \sqrt{x/34} \)

But if x - 2 is equal to sqrt(x/34), then x - 2 must be non-negative, because sqrt is non-negative. So, x - 2 ≥ 0 ⇒ x ≥ 2.

But in the interval [1,3), so x ∈ [2,3).

Therefore, in equation 2, we have solutions only in [2,3).

But when we solved equation 2, we ended up with the same quadratic equation as equation 1, but that quadratic equation's solutions were approximately 1.769 and 2.257.

But since in equation 2, x must be ≥ 2, so x ≈2.257 is a valid solution, but x≈1.769 is less than 2, so it's not in the domain of equation 2.

Therefore, equation 2 in [1,3) gives only one solution: x≈2.257.

Wait, but wait, let me check. When we squared equation 2, we might have introduced an extraneous solution.

So, it's essential to check the solutions in the original equation.

So, let's compute for x≈1.769:

In equation 2: 2 - x = -sqrt(x/34)

Left side: 2 - 1.769 ≈0.231

Right side: -sqrt(1.769/34)≈-sqrt(0.052)≈-0.228

So, 0.231 ≈ -0.228? No, that's not true, so x≈1.769 is an extraneous solution introduced by squaring.

Similarly, x≈2.257:

Left side: 2 - 2.257≈-0.257

Right side: -sqrt(2.257/34)≈-sqrt(0.0664)≈-0.257

So, -0.257≈-0.257, which is true. So, x≈2.257 is a valid solution.

Therefore, in equation 2, only x≈2.257 is valid.

But wait, equation 2 is 2 - x = -sqrt(x/34), which would imply that 2 - x is negative because sqrt is positive, so 2 - x must be negative, so x > 2. Therefore, in [1,3), x must be in (2,3) for equation 2 to have a solution.

But when we solved, the solution was x≈2.257, which is in (2,3), so valid.

So, in total, in [1,3):

- Equation 1 gives two solutions: x≈1.769 and x≈2.257.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, equation 1 was 2 - x = sqrt(x/34), which gave two solutions, but equation 2 was 2 - x = -sqrt(x/34), which gave one solution in [2,3). So, overall, equation 1 gave two solutions, and equation 2 gave one solution in [1,3). But wait, when we solved equation 1, we had two solutions in [1,3): approximately 1.769 and 2.257.

But wait, wait, when equation 1 is solved, we obtained two solutions, but equation 2, when solved, only one is valid in the domain. So, actually, equation 1 gives two solutions, but equation 2 gives one solution, so in total, three solutions in [1,3). But hold on, that can't be because the quadratic equation only has two roots.

Wait, no, in equation 1, we had two roots, but both were in [1,3). However, when we checked equation 2, one of the roots was extraneous. Therefore, in equation 1, two solutions, equation 2, one solution.

Wait, but when we squared equation 2, we got the same quadratic as equation 1, which had two roots, but only one was in the domain. So, that suggests that equation 2 has one solution, which was one of the roots.

Therefore, in [1,3), equations 1 and 2 have in total three solutions: two from equation 1 and one from equation 2. But that seems contradictory because a quadratic equation can have only two roots.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, equation 1: 2 - x = sqrt(x/34) gives two roots, both in [1,3): approximately 1.769 and 2.257.

Equation 2: 2 - x = -sqrt(x/34) gives one root, x≈2.257.

But when we solved equation 2, we ended up with the same quadratic as equation 1, but since equation 2 requires x > 2, only one solution is valid.

Therefore, in [1,3), equation 1 gives two solutions, and equation 2 gives one solution, but actually, equation 2 is the same as equation 1, just the negative version. So, perhaps the total number of solutions is two.

Wait, no, because equation 1 is 2 - x = sqrt(x/34), which is a different equation than equation 2: 2 - x = -sqrt(x/34). So, if you consider both, we get three solutions? Or is it that equation 2's solution is already included in equation 1's?

Wait, no, because if you have both equations:

1. 2 - x = sqrt(x/34) ⇒ equation 1

2. 2 - x = -sqrt(x/34) ⇒ equation 2

So, these are two separate equations, each leading to a quadratic. But in reality, equation 2 is equation 1 multiplied by -1 on both sides, so equation 2 is equivalent to equation 1 but with the RHS negative.

But when we square both sides, we get the same quadratic equation.

But the difference is in the domain: equation 1 allows x in [1,3), and equation 2 requires x in (2,3).

So, when solving equation 1, we get two solutions, both in [1,3), but when solving equation 2, we get one solution, which is in (2,3).

Therefore, in total, in [1,3), we have three solutions: two from equation 1 and one from equation 2. But that seems conflicting because the quadratic equation only has two roots.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in my approach. Let me think.

Wait, actually, equation 1 and equation 2 are not separate equations, but different cases depending on the sign of sqrt(x/34). So, in effect, when we have f(x) = sqrt(x/34) or f(x) = -sqrt(x/34), but since f(x) is positive in [1,3), equation 1 is the applicable one, and equation 2 is not because f(x) is positive. Wait, but f(x) is 2 - x, which is positive in [1, 2) and negative in (2, 3). Wait, hold on, is that correct?

Wait, in [1,3), f(x) = 2 - x.

So, when x is in [1,2), f(x) is positive (since 2 - x > 0).

When x is in (2,3), f(x) is negative (since 2 - x < 0).

Therefore, in [1,2), equation 1: f(x) = sqrt(x/34) is applicable because f(x) is positive.

Equation 2: f(x) = -sqrt(x/34) would imply that f(x) is equal to a negative number, but in [1,2), f(x) is positive, so equation 2 is not applicable here.

In [2,3), f(x) is negative, so equation 1: f(x) = sqrt(x/34) would imply f(x) is positive, which is contradictory because f(x) is negative here. So, equation 1 is not applicable in [2,3).

Equation 2: f(x) = -sqrt(x/34) is applicable here, because f(x) is negative, so it can equal -sqrt(x/34). So, in [2,3), equation 2 is the one that is relevant.

Therefore, in [1,3):

- [1,2): equation 1: f(x) = sqrt(x/34)

- [2,3): equation 2: f(x) = -sqrt(x/34)

Thus, in [1,2):

Solve 2 - x = sqrt(x/34)

In [2,3):

Solve 2 - x = -sqrt(x/34)

So, equation 1 is only for [1,2), equation 2 is only for [2,3).

Therefore, in [1,2):

Equation: 2 - x = sqrt(x/34)

Square both sides: (2 - x)^2 = x/34

4 - 4x + x² = x/34

Multiply by 34: 34x² - 136x + 136 = x

So, 34x² - 137x + 136 = 0

Which is the same quadratic as before.

Solutions: x = [137 ± sqrt(137² - 4*34*136)] / (2*34)

Which was x ≈1.769 and x≈2.257.

But in this case, equation is in [1,2), so x must be in [1,2). Therefore, x≈1.769 is valid, x≈2.257 is in [2,3), so it's in the next interval.

Therefore, in [1,2): x≈1.769 is a solution.

In [2,3):

Equation: 2 - x = -sqrt(x/34)

So, 2 - x = -sqrt(x/34) ⇒ x - 2 = sqrt(x/34)

Square both sides: (x - 2)^2 = x/34

x² -4x +4 = x/34

Multiply by 34: 34x² -136x +136 = x

So, 34x² -137x +136 =0

Same quadratic as before.

Solutions: x ≈1.769 and x≈2.257

But in equation 2, x must be in [2,3). So, x≈2.257 is valid.

Therefore, in [2,3): x≈2.257 is a solution.

Therefore, in [1,3), we have two solutions: x≈1.769 and x≈2.257.

But wait, earlier, when I considered equation 1 in [1,3), I thought there were two solutions, but now, considering that equation 1 is only in [1,2), and equation 2 is only in [2,3), each leading to one solution, so total two solutions in [1,3).

So, in total:

In [0,1): x=0 and x=1/34.

In [1,3): x≈1.769 and x≈2.257.

So, four solutions so far in [0,3): x=0, 1/34, 1.769, 2.257.

But wait, x=0 is in [0,1), and the others in [1,3).

But wait, in [0,1), when x=0, y=0; in [1,3), x≈1.769 and x≈2.257.

But x=0 is a solution, but in [0,1), so when we consider periodicity, we can get more solutions in the next periods.

But before moving on, let me get exact expressions instead of approximate decimal values.

Earlier, we saw that in [0,1), equation 1 gave x=0 and x=1/34.

In [1,3), equation 1 in [1,2): quadratic equation 34x² -137x +136=0

Solutions: x = [137 ± sqrt(18769 - 18496)] / 68

Which was sqrt(273). So, x = [137 ± sqrt(273)] /68.

But 137 divided by 68 is 2.0147..., and sqrt(273)≈16.52, so [137 - sqrt(273)] /68≈(137 -16.52)/68≈120.48/68≈1.769

Similarly, [137 + sqrt(273)] /68≈153.52/68≈2.257

But in [1,2): only x≈1.769 is valid.

In [2,3): same quadratic, but only x≈2.257 is valid.

So, exact solutions in [1,3): x = [137 - sqrt(273)] /68 and x = [137 + sqrt(273)] /68.

So, in [0,3), we have four intersection points:

1. x=0, y=0

2. x=1/34, y=1/34

3. x = [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt( [137 - sqrt(273)] /68 /34 )

Wait, actually, hold on.

Wait, in [0,1), equation 1: f(x) = x = sqrt(x/34). So, y = x = sqrt(x/34). So, y is equal to sqrt(x/34). So, for x=1/34, y=1/34.

Similarly, in [1,3), equation 1 in [1,2): f(x)=2 -x = sqrt(x/34). So, y = sqrt(x/34). Similarly, in [2,3), equation 2: f(x)=2 -x = -sqrt(x/34). So, y = -sqrt(x/34).

Therefore, in each case, y is determined as either positive or negative sqrt(x/34).

So, for each x, y is uniquely determined as either positive or negative.

Therefore, for each x solution, there is one y.

So, in [0,1): x=0, y=0; x=1/34, y=1/34.

In [1,3): x≈1.769, y≈sqrt(1.769/34)≈sqrt(0.052)≈0.228; and x≈2.257, y≈-sqrt(2.257/34)≈-sqrt(0.066)≈-0.257.

But to get the exact y values, let's compute them in terms of exact expressions.

In [0,1):

x=1/34, so y=1/34.

In [1,3):

x = [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, so y = sqrt( x /34 ) = sqrt( ([137 - sqrt(273)] /68 ) /34 ) = sqrt( [137 - sqrt(273)] / (68*34) ) = sqrt( [137 - sqrt(273)] / 2312 ).

Similarly, x = [137 + sqrt(273)] /68, so y = -sqrt( [137 + sqrt(273)] /2312 ).

But let me see if I can write it more neatly.

First, note that [137 ± sqrt(273)] /68 divided by 34 is [137 ± sqrt(273)] / (68*34) = [137 ± sqrt(273)] / 2312.

So, y = ± sqrt( [137 ± sqrt(273)] /2312 ).

But 2312 factors: 2312 divided by 16 is 144.5, not integer. Let's see, 2312 ÷ 8 = 289. So, 2312 = 8*289 = 8*17².

So, 2312 = 8*289 = 8*17².

So, sqrt( [137 ± sqrt(273)] /2312 ) = sqrt( [137 ± sqrt(273)] / (8*17²) ) = (1/17) * sqrt( [137 ± sqrt(273)] /8 ).

So, y = ± (1/17) * sqrt( [137 ± sqrt(273)] /8 ).

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but perhaps we can rationalize or represent it differently.

Alternatively, maybe we can write it as fractions:

sqrt( [137 ± sqrt(273)] /2312 ) = sqrt(137 ± sqrt(273)) / sqrt(2312 )

But sqrt(2312) = sqrt(4*578) = 2*sqrt(578). And 578 is 2*17², so sqrt(578) = 17*sqrt(2). Therefore, sqrt(2312) = 2*17*sqrt(2) = 34*sqrt(2).

So, sqrt( [137 ± sqrt(273)] /2312 ) = sqrt(137 ± sqrt(273)) / (34*sqrt(2)).

Therefore, y = ± sqrt(137 ± sqrt(273)) / (34*sqrt(2)).

But we can rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):

y = ± sqrt(137 ± sqrt(273)) * sqrt(2) / (34*2) = ± sqrt(2(137 ± sqrt(273))) /68.

So, y = ± sqrt(274 ± 2*sqrt(273)) /68.

Wait, that's a nice expression. Let me write it:

y = ± sqrt(274 ± 2*sqrt(273)) /68.

So, in exact terms, the y-coordinates are:

1. y=1/34

2. y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

3. y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68

Wait, hold on, let me verify.

Wait, from above:

sqrt( [137 ± sqrt(273)] /2312 ) = sqrt( [137 ± sqrt(273)] ) / sqrt(2312 )

But sqrt(2312) = sqrt(4*578) = 2*sqrt(578). sqrt(578) = sqrt(2*17²) = 17*sqrt(2). So, sqrt(2312)=2*17*sqrt(2)=34*sqrt(2).

Therefore, sqrt( [137 ± sqrt(273)] /2312 ) = sqrt(137 ± sqrt(273)) / (34*sqrt(2)) = sqrt(137 ± sqrt(273)) / (34*sqrt(2)).

Multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):

= sqrt(2)*sqrt(137 ± sqrt(273)) / (34*2) = sqrt(2*(137 ± sqrt(273))) /68.

So, yes, y = ± sqrt(274 ± 2*sqrt(273))/68.

Wait, because 2*(137 ± sqrt(273)) = 274 ± 2*sqrt(273).

Therefore, y = ± sqrt(274 ± 2*sqrt(273))/68.

So, in terms of the solutions:

1. x=0, y=0.

2. x=1/34, y=1/34.

3. x = [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68.

4. x = [137 + sqrt(273)] /68, y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68.

So, these are the four intersection points in [0,3).

Now, since the function is periodic with period 4, each subsequent period will have the same intersection points, shifted by 4 units in x.

So, in the interval [4,8), there will be intersection points at x=4 +0=4, x=4 +1/34, x=4 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, and x=4 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68.

Similarly, in [8,12), x=8 +0, x=8 +1/34, x=8 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, and x=8 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68.

But wait, 34y² =x, so x must be non-negative, so in each period, these four points exist.

But our domain is x ≤34, because y² =x/34, so y is real when x ≤34.

Therefore, the last period where x is in [32,34), because 34 -32=2.

So, in [32,34), we also have four intersection points:

x=32, x=32 +1/34, x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, and x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68.

But need to check if x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68 is less than or equal to34.

Compute 32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68.

Compute [137 + sqrt(273)] /68 ≈ (137 +16.52)/68≈153.52/68≈2.257.

So, 32 +2.257≈34.257, which is greater than34, so it's outside the domain.

Similarly, [137 - sqrt(273)] /68≈(137 -16.52)/68≈120.48/68≈1.769.

So, 32 +1.769≈33.769, which is less than34.

Therefore, in [32,34), we have three intersection points: x=32, x=32 +1/34, and x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68.

But x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68≈34.257>34, so it's outside.

So, in total, how many intersection points do we have?

In each period [4k,4k+4), for k=0,1,2,..., we have four intersection points, but in the last period, [32,34), we only have three because one solution is beyond x=34.

But let's check how many full periods are in x≤34.

Since the period is 4, and 34 divided by4 is8.5. So, there are8 full periods (0-4,4-8,...,28-32) and a half period (32-34).

In each full period, there are four intersection points: x=4k, x=4k +1/34, x=4k + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, and x=4k + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68.

But in the last half period, [32,34), we have four points but one is beyond34, so we have three points.

Therefore, the total number of intersection points is:

Number of full periods:8, each contributing four points:8*4=32 points.

But wait, actually, no: because when k=8, the period would be [32,36), but since x≤34, we only go up to [32,34). So, the number of full periods is8, each from [4k,4k+4) where4k+4≤34. So, 4k+4≤34 ⇒4k≤30 ⇒k≤7.5. Since k is integer, k=0 to7, giving8 full periods: [0,4), [4,8),..., [28,32). Each of these8 periods has four intersection points.

Then, in the last half period [32,34), we have three intersection points.

So, total number of intersections:8*4 +3=35.

But hold on, in the initial period [0,3), we had four points, but in reality, the first period [0,4) is split into [0,3) and [3,4). Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation.

Wait, no, each full period is4 units, so [0,4), [4,8), etc. So, up to [28,32), which is the8th period.

Then, the last interval is [32,34), which is a partial period.

So, in [0,4):4 points

[4,8):4 points

...

[28,32):4 points

[32,34):3 points

Total:8*4 +3=35 points.

Each of these points has a y-coordinate.

So, for the sum of the y-coordinates, we need to sum all y's from these points.

Each intersection point in [4k,4k+4) has y-coordinates:

1. y=0 (at x=4k)

2. y=1/34 (at x=4k +1/34)

3. y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68 (at x=4k + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68 )

4. y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68 (at x=4k + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68 )

But in the last period [32,34), the four points would have y-coordinates:

1. y=0 (at x=32)

2. y=1/34 (at x=32 +1/34)

3. y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68 (at x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68 )

4. y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68 (at x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68 )

But x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68≈34.257>34, so it's excluded.

Therefore, in [32,34), we have three y-coordinates.

So, to compute the sum of all y-coordinates, we can compute the sum over each full period and then add the partial sum from the last period.

But note that in each full period [4k,4k+4), the four intersection points have y-coordinates:

1. y=0

2. y=1/34

3. y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

4. y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68

So, the sum over each full period is 0 + 1/34 + sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68 - sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68.

Now, notice that sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273)) - sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273)) is equal to something.

Let me compute this expression:

Let me denote A = sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))

and B = sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))

Then, A - B.

Compute A - B:

But perhaps, square A - B.

(A - B)^2 = A² + B² - 2AB

Compute A² =274 - 2*sqrt(273)

B² =274 + 2*sqrt(273)

AB = sqrt( (274 - 2*sqrt(273))(274 + 2*sqrt(273)) ) = sqrt(274² - (2*sqrt(273))² ) = sqrt(75076 - 4*273) = sqrt(75076 - 1092)=sqrt(73984).

Compute 73984. Hmm, 73984 divided by 16 is 4624, which is 68². So, sqrt(73984)=sqrt(16*4624)=4*68=272.

So, AB=272.

Therefore, (A - B)^2 = (274 - 2*sqrt(273)) + (274 + 2*sqrt(273)) -2*272 = 274 -2sqrt273 +274 +2sqrt273 -544 = (274 +274 -544) + (-2sqrt273 +2sqrt273) = (548 -544) +0=4.

Therefore, (A - B)^2=4, so A - B=±2.

But since A = sqrt(274 - 2sqrt273) and B = sqrt(274 + 2sqrt273), and sqrt273≈16.52, so 2sqrt273≈33.04.

So, A≈sqrt(274 -33.04)=sqrt(240.96)=≈15.53

B≈sqrt(274 +33.04)=sqrt(307.04)=≈17.52

Therefore, A - B≈15.53 -17.52≈-1.99≈-2.

So, A - B= -2.

Therefore, sqrt(274 - 2sqrt273) - sqrt(274 + 2sqrt273)= -2.

Therefore, going back to the sum over each full period:

Sum per full period =0 +1/34 + (A)/68 - (B)/68= (A - B)/68 +1/34= (-2)/68 +1/34= (-1/34)+1/34=0.

Wait, that's interesting. So, each full period contributes 0 to the sum of y-coordinates.

So, over each full period [4k,4k+4), the total sum of y-coordinates is 0.

Therefore, each full period doesn't contribute to the total sum. Only the partial periods contribute.

Therefore, the total sum is equal to the sum of the y-coordinates in the last partial period [32,34).

In [32,34), we have three intersection points:

1. x=32, y=0

2. x=32 +1/34, y=1/34

3. x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

So, the sum of y-coordinates in [32,34) is:

0 +1/34 + sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

But wait, in the last period, the four points would have been:

1. y=0

2. y=1/34

3. y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

4. y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68

But the fourth point is excluded because x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68≈34.257>34.

Therefore, in the last partial period, we have three points, and the sum is 0 +1/34 + sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68.

But wait, also, note that at x=32, y=0 is included, but in the previous reasoning, in each full period, the sum cancels out, but in the last partial period, we have an extra point at x=32, which is the start of the period.

But wait, x=32 is included in the domain, so we have to include it as well.

But wait, perhaps we should consider whether x=32 is part of a full period or a partial period.

But x=32 is the left endpoint of the period [32,36), but since x≤34, we only go up to34, so [32,34) is a half period.

So, in that half period, we have:

1. x=32, y=0

2. x=32 +1/34, y=1/34

3. x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

And the fourth point is outside, so excluded.

Therefore, the sum of y-coordinates in the last half period is:

0 +1/34 + sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68.

But wait, we have to check if x=32 is part of the function. At x=32, f(x)=x -4 =28, which is y=28/34=14/17≈0.8235.

Wait, but in the intersection point, y=0 at x=32, which would imply that 34*0² =x ⇒x=0. So, x=32, y=0 is a solution because f(32)=28, but 28≠0, so actually, this is a mistake.

Wait, wait a minute: f(x) at x=32 is 28, so equation is 28 = y, and x=34y² ⇒32=34y² ⇒y²=32/34=16/17 ⇒y=±4/sqrt(17)=±(4sqrt17)/17≈±1.56.

But in the intersection points, when x=32, y=0, which would imply f(32)=0, but f(32)=28≠0. So, that can't be. Therefore, x=32, y=0 is not a solution.

Wait, this is a problem.

Wait, where did I go wrong?

Earlier, I thought that in each full period, the sum is zero because we have four points, but actually, in reality, in each full period, the four points have y-coordinates that sum to zero.

But when I get to the last period, [32,34), the point at x=32, y=0 is actually not a solution because f(32)=28≠0.

So, that point is not an intersection point. So, in the last period, we have to adjust.

So, in [32,34), the four intersection points would have been:

1. x=32, y=0 (not a solution, since f(32)=28≠0)

2. x=32 +1/34, y=1/34

3. x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

4. x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68, y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68

But the first point, x=32, y=0, is not a solution because f(32)=28≠0.

Therefore, in the last half period, we only have three solutions:

x=32 +1/34, y=1/34

x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68, y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68

But wait, x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68≈34.257>34, so it's excluded.

Therefore, in the last period, only two solutions:

x=32 +1/34, y=1/34

x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

Wait, but that's only two points. What about the symmetric one?

Wait, in the last period, x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68≈34.257 is beyond34, so we don't include it.

But does the other intersection point in this period have a y-coordinate? It would be y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68, but since x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68 is excluded, do we have another point?

Wait, in the last period, we have:

From equation1: x=32 +1/34, y=1/34

From equation2: x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

From equation3: x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68, y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68 (excluded)

But wait, in the previous periods, each full period had four solutions: two with positive y and two with negative y. But in the last partial period, since we have a half period, perhaps we only get two solutions, but one of them is excluded because x>34.

But also, the point at x=32, y=0 is not a solution because f(32)=28≠0.

Therefore, in the last partial period, only two intersection points:

1. x=32 +1/34, y=1/34

2. x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

Wait, but that's only two points. Then, where is the other point?

Wait, perhaps I made an error. Let me recount:

In each full period [4k,4k+4), the four intersection points are:

1. x=4k, y=0

2. x=4k +1/34, y=1/34

3. x=4k + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

4. x=4k + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68, y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68

But in reality, for k=8, 4k=32, and the four points would be:

1. x=32, y=0 (not a solution)

2. x=32 +1/34, y=1/34

3. x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

4. x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68, y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68

But among these, x=32 +1/34, x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68 are valid, while x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68 is beyond34.

But in the full period [32,36), we have four points, but only two are within [32,34). So, their y-coordinates are 1/34 and sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68.

But wait, why is the point at x=32, y=0 not a solution? Because f(32)=28, which does not equal y=0. So, that point is not actually an intersection point.

Therefore, in each full period, the four points are:

1. x=4k, y=0 (but only if f(4k)=0)

But f(4k)=4k -4k=0. So, f(4k)=0, so y=0 is a solution because f(4k)=0= y, so 0=34y² ⇒x=0, but x=4k≠0 unless k=0.

Wait, hold on, if x=4k, then f(x)=0, so 0=y, so 34y²=0 ⇒y=0.

Wait, but x=4k is in the function f(x)=0, so 0=34*0² ⇒0=0, so it's a valid solution.

But in reality, in the function f(x), when x=4k, f(x)=0, so y=0, so the point is (4k,0). But in the parabola, y² =x/34, so x=0 when y=0. So, (4k,0) is on the parabola only when k=0, that is, (0,0). For k≠0, (4k,0) is not on the parabola, because plugging into y² =x/34, we get 0²=4k/34 ⇒0=4k/34 ⇒k=0. Therefore, except for k=0, the points (4k,0) are not on the parabola.

Therefore, for k≠0, the points (4k,0) are not intersection points because f(4k)=0≠0=34y² only when y=0, but x=4k≠0.

Therefore, in each full period [4k,4k+4), we have three intersection points:

1. x=4k +1/34, y=1/34

2. x=4k + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

3. x=4k + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68, y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68

But the first point at x=4k is not a solution except when k=0.

Wait, so actually, in each full period [4k,4k+4), excluding k=0, we have three intersection points.

But wait, in the first period [0,4), we have four points:

1. x=0, y=0

2. x=1/34, y=1/34

3. x≈1.769, y≈0.228

4. x≈2.257, y≈-0.257

So, four points because x=0 is included.

For k=0, the period [0,4), x=0 is included, so it's a solution.

For k=1, period [4,8):

1. x=4 +1/34, y=1/34

2. x=4 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

3. x=4 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68, y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68

But x=4 is not a solution because f(4)=0≠y=0 (since for x=4, y=0, but 34y²=0 ⇒x=0≠4).

Wait, but x=4 is in [4,8), but f(4)=0, so y=0, but y²= x/34 ⇒0=4/34 ⇒4=0, which is false. Therefore, x=4 is not a solution.

Therefore, in each period [4k,4k+4) for k≥1, we have three intersection points.

Similarly, in the last period [32,34):

1. x=32 +1/34, y=1/34

2. x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

3. x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68, y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68 (excluded)

Therefore, in [32,34), we have two intersection points.

But wait, in the last period, [32,36), but we only go up to34, so only two points.

But for k=8, 4k=32, so [32,36). But we only take up to34.

Therefore, in each full period [4k,4k+4) for k=0,1,...,7, we have four intersection points, but for k=8, we have two intersection points.

Wait, but in reality, for k=0: [0,4): four points.

For k=1: [4,8): three points.

Similarly, for k=2: [8,12): three points.

...

k=7: [28,32): three points.

k=8: [32,36): but we only go up to34, so two points.

Therefore, total number of intersection points:

- For k=0: four points

- For k=1 to7: seven periods, each with three points: 7*3=21

- For k=8: two points

Total:4 +21 +2=27 points.

But wait, when k=0, we have four points: x=0, x=1/34, x≈1.769, x≈2.257.

Similarly, for k=1, we have three points: x≈4.029, x≈4.769, x≈5.257.

Wait, but no, let's think again.

Wait, for each k, in [4k,4k+4):

- If k=0: four points: x=0, x=1/34, x= [137 - sqrt(273)] /68≈1.769, x= [137 + sqrt(273)] /68≈2.257.

- For k=1: three points: x=4 +1/34≈4.029, x=4 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68≈4 +1.769≈5.769? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no, in each period [4k,4k+4), the solutions are:

x=4k +1/34, x=4k + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, x=4k + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68.

Wait, no, that would make x=4k + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68 exceeding 4k +4 for k≥1.

Wait, let me plug k=1:

x=4 +1/34≈4.029,

x=4 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68≈4 + (137 -16.52)/68≈4 +120.48/68≈4 +1.769≈5.769,

x=4 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68≈4 +153.52/68≈4 +2.257≈6.257.

Wait, but 4 +2.257=6.257, which is in [4,8).

So, in each period [4k,4k+4), the three intersection points are:

x=4k +1/34,

x=4k + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68,

x=4k + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68.

But for k=1, 4k + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68≈6.257<8, so it's within the period.

Wait, but [137 + sqrt(273)] /68≈2.257, so 4k +2.257≈6.257.

Similarly, for k=2:

x=8 +1/34≈8.029,

x=8 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68≈8 +1.769≈9.769,

x=8 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68≈8 +2.257≈10.257.

But 10.257 is less than12, so it's within [8,12).

Wait, so in each period [4k,4k+4), for k=0,1,...,7, we have three intersection points (except for k=0, which has four points because x=0 is included). So, actually, in [4k,4k+4) for k=0: four points, k=1,...,7: three points each, k=8: two points.

Therefore, total points:

k=0:4, k=1-7:3 each, k=8:2.

Total:4 +7*3 +2=4 +21 +2=27.

Therefore, 27 intersection points.

But in the last period, k=8, [32,36), we have x=32 +1/34≈32.029, x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68≈32 +1.769≈33.769, x=32 + [137 + sqrt(273)] /68≈32 +2.257≈34.257.

But x=34.257>34, so in [32,34), we have two intersection points: x≈32.029, x≈33.769.

But x=33.769 is in [32,34), so it's included.

Therefore, in [32,34), two intersection points.

Therefore, in total, 27 intersection points.

But in terms of sum of y-coordinates, each full period [4k,4k+4) for k=1,...,7 contributes three points, each with y-coordinates:

1. y=1/34

2. y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68

3. y= -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68

So, sum per period k=1,...,7:

1/34 + sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68 - sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68.

But as before, sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273)) - sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))= -2.

Therefore, sum per period:

1/34 + (-2)/68=1/34 -1/34=0.

So, each full period k=1,...,7 contributes 0.

Then, in k=0: [0,4), four points with y-coordinates:

0,1/34, sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68, -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68.

Sum:0 +1/34 + sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68 - sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68=1/34 + (-2)/68=1/34 -1/34=0.

Wait, in k=0, we have four points, but the sum is zero.

Wait, but we have x=0, x=1/34, x≈1.769, x≈2.257.

So, y-coordinates:0,1/34, sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68, -sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))/68.

Sum:0 +1/34 + [sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273)) - sqrt(274 + 2*sqrt(273))]/68=0 +1/34 + (-2)/68=1/34 -1/34=0.

Similarly, for k=8: in [32,34), two points:

x=32 +1/34, y=1/34,

x=32 + [137 - sqrt(273)] /68, y= sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68.

So, their y-coordinates:1/34 and sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68.

Therefore, the sum for k=8:1/34 + sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68.

So, adding all together:

Total sum= sum over k=0 to7 of sum per period + sum for k=8.

But sum over k=0 to7: each period contributes0, so total is0.

Then, sum for k=8:1/34 + sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68.

But wait, in k=0, we had four points, but the sum was0, so the only contributions are from k=8.

Therefore, the total sum of y-coordinates is1/34 + sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))/68.

Simplify this expression.

First, note that sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273)) is equal to sqrt( (sqrt(273) -1)^2 ).

Wait, let me compute (sqrt(273)-1)^2=273 - 2*sqrt(273) +1=274 - 2*sqrt(273). Yes, exactly.

Therefore, sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))=sqrt( (sqrt(273)-1)^2 )=sqrt(273)-1, since sqrt(273) >1.

Therefore, sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))=sqrt(273)-1.

So, the expression becomes:

1/34 + (sqrt(273) -1)/68.

Combine the terms:

1/34=2/68,

So, 2/68 + (sqrt(273) -1)/68= (2 + sqrt(273) -1)/68=(1 + sqrt(273))/68.

Therefore, the total sum is (1 + sqrt(273))/68.

But wait, let me confirm:

sqrt(274 - 2*sqrt(273))=sqrt( (sqrt(273)-1)^2 )=sqrt(273)-1.

So,

Sum =1/34 + (sqrt(273)-1)/68= (2 + sqrt(273) -1)/68= (1 + sqrt(273))/68.

Yes, that's correct.

But let me double-check:

1/34=2/68,

So, 2/68 + (sqrt(273)-1)/68= [2 + sqrt(273) -1]/68= (1 + sqrt(273))/68.

Therefore, the sum of y-coordinates is (1 + sqrt(273))/68.

But in the problem statement, the answer is given in the form (a + b*sqrt(c))/d, where a,b,d are positive integers, and c is square-free.

Here, (1 + sqrt(273))/68 is in that form with a=1, b=1, c=273, d=68.

But we need to check if c=273 is square-free.

273 factors into 3*7*13. All primes, so yes, 273 is square-free.

Therefore, the sum is (1 + sqrt(273))/68.

But wait, 273 is 3×7×13, so yes, square-free.

Therefore, the answer is (1 + sqrt(273))/68, so a=1, b=1, c=273, d=68.

But the problem states that a, b, d are positive integers, c is square-free, and gcd(a, b, d)=1.

Compute gcd(1,1,68)=1, since gcd(1,68)=1.

Therefore, the conditions are satisfied.

Hence, a + b + c + d=1 +1 +273 +68=1 +1=2, 2 +273=275, 275 +68=343.

Therefore, the final answer is 343.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{343}
</think>

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as a piecewise linear function with period 4. It is given by:

\[
f(x) = \begin{cases} 
x & \text{if } x \in [-1,1) \\
2 - x & \text{if } x \in [1,3), 
\end{cases}
\]

and \( f(x + 4) = f(x) \) for all \( x \).

The parabola \( x = 34y^2 \) intersects the graph of \( f(x) \). We need to find the sum of the y-coordinates of all intersection points.

1. The function \( f(x) \) is periodic with period 4, so we analyze it within one period \([0, 4)\).
2. The function \( f(x) \) is defined as \( x \) on \([0,1)\), \( 2 - x \) on \([1, 2)\), \( x - 2 \) on \([2, 3)\), and \( 4 - x \) on \([3, 4)\).
3. The equation \( x = 34y^2 \) is solved for \( x \) in each piece of \( f(x) \):
   - For \( x \in [0, 1) \), solving \( x = 34y^2 \) gives \( y = 0 \).
   - For \( x \in [1, 2) \), solving \( 2 - x = y \) gives \( y = \frac{1}{34} \).
   - For \( x \in [2, 3) \), solving \( x - 2 = y \) gives \( y = \sqrt{\frac{273}{34}} \) and \( y = -\sqrt{\frac{273}{34}} \).
   - For \( x \in [3, 4) \), solving \( 4 - x = -y \) gives \( y = -\sqrt{\frac{273}{34}} \).

4. These solutions are repeated every 4 units due to the periodicity of \( f(x) \).

5. The intersection points in each period are:
   - \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \)
   - \( x = \frac{1}{34} \), \( y = \frac{1}{34} \)
   - \( x = \frac{137 - \sqrt{273}}{68} \), \( y = \sqrt{\frac{274 - 2\sqrt{273}}{34}} \)
   - \( x = \frac{137 + \sqrt{273}}{68} \), \( y = -\sqrt{\frac{274 + 2\sqrt{273}}{34}} \)

6. Summing the y-coordinates for each period, we find that each full period contributes 0, except for the last partial period.

7. The sum of the y-coordinates for the last partial period (from \( x = 32 \) to \( x = 34 \)) is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{34} + \sqrt{\frac{274 - 2\sqrt{273}}{34}}
   \]
   Simplifying, we find this sum is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{273}}{68} \).

8. Thus, the total sum of the y-coordinates is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{273}}{68} \).

9. The values \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 273 \), and \( d = 68 \) are given. The gcd of 1, 1, and 68 is 1, and 273 is square-free.

10. Therefore, \( a + b + c + d = 1 + 1 + 273 + 68 = 343 \).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{343}
\]
