Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I need to figure out where the original parabola \( y = x^2 - 4 \) intersects with its image after being rotated 60 degrees counterclockwise around the origin. The question specifically mentions a unique point in the fourth quadrant, which has a y-coordinate of the form \( \frac{a - \sqrt{b}}{c} \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are positive integers, with \( a \) and \( c \) being coprime. Then, I have to find \( a + b + c \).

First, let me visualize what's happening. I have a parabola that opens upwards, vertex at (0, -4). Then, when I rotate this parabola 60 degrees counterclockwise around the origin, it will open in a different direction. The intersection point in the fourth quadrant is where the original parabola and the rotated parabola meet.

Since the rotation is around the origin, I think I need to use rotation transformations on the coordinates. For a point \( (x, y) \), rotating it 60 degrees counterclockwise gives the new coordinates \( (x\cos\theta - y\sin\theta, x\sin\theta + y\cos\theta) \), where \( \theta = 60^\circ \). So, \( \cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

So, if I have a point \( (x, y) \) on the original parabola, after rotation, it becomes \( \left( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{y\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{y}{2} \right) \). This rotated point lies on the image of the parabola.

But wait, the intersection point lies on both the original parabola and the rotated parabola. So, the point \( (x, y) \) is on \( y = x^2 - 4 \), and when rotated, it becomes another point \( (x', y') \) which should also lie on the rotated parabola. But actually, since it's an intersection, both the original and the rotated parabola pass through this point. So, perhaps I need another equation.

Hold on, maybe I need to write the equation of the rotated parabola. Let me think: If I rotate the parabola \( y = x^2 - 4 \) by 60 degrees, what does that look like?

Alternatively, maybe using the inverse rotation. Since the image of the parabola is the rotated one, but since we need the intersection, maybe it's better to consider the rotated parabola equation.

Alternatively, considering that any point \( (x, y) \) on the original parabola, when rotated 60 degrees, maps to another point \( (x', y') \) on the rotated parabola. But since they intersect, \( (x, y) \) should satisfy both the original parabola equation and the rotated parabola equation.

Wait, perhaps I should express the rotated parabola in terms of \( x' \) and \( y' \), and then write the equation in terms of the original coordinates.

Let me recall that when you rotate a curve, you can represent the rotated curve with equations derived from the original curve by replacing \( x \) and \( y \) with their expressions in terms of the rotated coordinates.

So, if we have a point \( (x, y) \) on the original parabola, then the rotated point \( (x', y') \) is given by:

\( x' = x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta \)

\( y' = x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta \)

But since we want the equation of the rotated parabola, we can express \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of \( x' \) and \( y' \). That is, solving for \( x \) and \( y \).

So, let me solve the rotation equations:

Given:

\( x' = x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta \)

\( y' = x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta \)

Let me write this as a system:

1. \( x' = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}y \)

2. \( y' = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}y \)

I need to solve for \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of \( x' \) and \( y' \). To do this, I can treat this as a linear system and use substitution or matrix inversion.

Let me write it in matrix form:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
y'
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
\]

To get \( x \) and \( y \), we can invert the rotation matrix. The inverse of a rotation matrix is its transpose because rotation matrices are orthogonal. So, the inverse matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

So, multiplying both sides by this inverse matrix:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
y'
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Therefore,

\( x = \frac{1}{2}x' + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}y' \)

\( y = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x' + \frac{1}{2}y' \)

So, the original parabola equation is \( y = x^2 - 4 \). Substituting \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of \( x' \) and \( y' \):

\( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x' + \frac{1}{2}y' = \left( \frac{1}{2}x' + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}y' \right)^2 - 4 \)

That's the equation of the rotated parabola in terms of \( x' \) and \( y' \). Let me write that more clearly:

\( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x' + \frac{1}{2}y' = \left( \frac{x'}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3} y'}{2} \right)^2 - 4 \)

So, now we have two equations:

1. The original parabola: \( y = x^2 - 4 \)
2. The rotated parabola: \( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x' + \frac{1}{2}y' = \left( \frac{x'}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3} y'}{2} \right)^2 - 4 \)

But at the intersection point, \( (x, y) \) is the same as \( (x', y') \), right? Wait, no. Because before rotation, the point is \( (x, y) \), and after rotation, the image is \( (x', y') \). But if they intersect, then the point lies on both the original parabola and the image parabola. So, the coordinates \( (x, y) \) must satisfy both equations.

Wait, so for the original parabola, \( y = x^2 - 4 \). For the rotated parabola, the equation is in terms of \( x' \) and \( y' \). But since the intersection point is the same point in both the original and rotated coordinates, we can write \( x' = x \) and \( y' = y \). Therefore, substituting \( x' = x \) and \( y' = y \) into the equation of the rotated parabola.

So, substituting:

\( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}y = \left( \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3} y}{2} \right)^2 - 4 \)

But since \( y = x^2 - 4 \), we can substitute that in as well.

So, replacing \( y \) with \( x^2 - 4 \):

Left side: \( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 4) \)

Right side: \( \left( \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(x^2 - 4) \right)^2 - 4 \)

So, now we have an equation in terms of \( x \) only. Let me write that out:

Left side: \( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 2 \)

Right side: \( \left( \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2 - 2\sqrt{3} \right)^2 - 4 \)

So, expanding the right side:

First, let me denote \( A = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2 - 2\sqrt{3} \). Then, the right side is \( A^2 - 4 \).

Let me compute \( A \):

\( A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x - 2\sqrt{3} \)

So, \( A^2 = \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x - 2\sqrt{3} \right)^2 \)

This seems like it will involve expanding a trinomial, which will take time.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, write \( A = a + b + c \), where:

\( a = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2 \)

\( b = \frac{1}{2}x \)

\( c = -2\sqrt{3} \)

Then, \( A^2 = (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc \)

Compute each term:

1. \( a^2 = \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2 \right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}x^4 \)

2. \( b^2 = \left( \frac{1}{2}x \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}x^2 \)

3. \( c^2 = (-2\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 \times 3 = 12 \)

4. \( 2ab = 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}x^3 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^3 \)

5. \( 2ac = 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2 \times (-2\sqrt{3}) = 2 \times (-\frac{\sqrt{3} \times 2\sqrt{3}}{2})x^2 = 2 \times (-\frac{6}{2})x^2 = 2 \times (-3)x^2 = -6x^2 \)

Wait, let me compute that again.

\( 2ac = 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2 \times (-2\sqrt{3}) = 2 \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{3} \times (-2\sqrt{3})}{2} \right) x^2 \)

Compute the constants inside:

\( \frac{\sqrt{3} \times (-2\sqrt{3})}{2} = \frac{-2 \times 3}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3 \)

Hence, \( 2ac = 2 \times (-3)x^2 = -6x^2 \)

6. \( 2bc = 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x \times (-2\sqrt{3}) = 2 \times \left( \frac{-2\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) x = 2 \times (-\sqrt{3})x = -2\sqrt{3}x \)

So, putting all together:

\( A^2 = \frac{3}{4}x^4 + \frac{1}{4}x^2 + 12 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^3 -6x^2 -2\sqrt{3}x \)

Simplify like terms:

- \( x^4 \): \( \frac{3}{4}x^4 \)
- \( x^3 \): \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^3 \)
- \( x^2 \): \( \frac{1}{4}x^2 - 6x^2 = -\frac{23}{4}x^2 \)
- \( x \): \( -2\sqrt{3}x \)
- Constants: \( 12 \)

Thus,

\( A^2 = \frac{3}{4}x^4 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^3 - \frac{23}{4}x^2 - 2\sqrt{3}x + 12 \)

Therefore, the right side of the equation is \( A^2 - 4 \):

\( \frac{3}{4}x^4 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^3 - \frac{23}{4}x^2 - 2\sqrt{3}x + 12 - 4 \)

Simplify constants:

\( 12 - 4 = 8 \)

So,

\( A^2 - 4 = \frac{3}{4}x^4 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^3 - \frac{23}{4}x^2 - 2\sqrt{3}x + 8 \)

Now, let's write the left side:

Left side: \( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 2 \)

So, set left side equal to right side:

\( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 2 = \frac{3}{4}x^4 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^3 - \frac{23}{4}x^2 - 2\sqrt{3}x + 8 \)

Let me bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:

\( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 2 - \frac{3}{4}x^4 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^3 + \frac{23}{4}x^2 + 2\sqrt{3}x - 8 = 0 \)

Simplify term by term:

- \( x^4 \): \( -\frac{3}{4}x^4 \)
- \( x^3 \): \( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^3 \)
- \( x^2 \): \( \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{23}{4}x^2 = \frac{2}{4}x^2 + \frac{23}{4}x^2 = \frac{25}{4}x^2 \)
- \( x \): \( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + 2\sqrt{3}x = \left( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right)x = \left( \frac{-1 + 4}{2} \sqrt{3} \right)x = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}x \)
- Constants: \( -2 - 8 = -10 \)

So, putting it all together:

\( -\frac{3}{4}x^4 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^3 + \frac{25}{4}x^2 + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}x - 10 = 0 \)

To eliminate the fractions, I can multiply both sides by 4:

\( -3x^4 - 2\sqrt{3}x^3 + 25x^2 + 6\sqrt{3}x - 40 = 0 \)

So, the equation becomes:

\( -3x^4 - 2\sqrt{3}x^3 + 25x^2 + 6\sqrt{3}x - 40 = 0 \)

This is a quartic equation, which seems quite complicated. Maybe I made a mistake earlier in expanding A^2. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, before that, perhaps there's a smarter way. Since we're looking for the intersection in the fourth quadrant, which is where x is positive and y is negative. So, the point we're looking for is in the fourth quadrant, so x > 0 and y < 0. On the original parabola, y = x^2 - 4, so when y is negative, x^2 < 4, so x is between -2 and 2. But since it's the fourth quadrant, x is positive, so x is between 0 and 2.

So, the intersection point is somewhere between x=0 and x=2.

Given that, maybe we can consider substituting x = something in that range. But before that, perhaps I should reconsider the approach.

Alternatively, maybe using complex numbers might help, but I don't think that's the right approach here.

Wait, maybe I can parameterize the parabola differently. For instance, parametrize \( y = x^2 - 4 \) as \( (t, t^2 - 4) \), then apply the rotation transformation to this parametric point. Then, the image point is \( (t \cos 60^\circ - (t^2 - 4)\sin 60^\circ, t \sin 60^\circ + (t^2 - 4)\cos 60^\circ) \). Then, since this image point must lie on the original parabola, we can set up the equation \( y' = (x')^2 - 4 \).

So, let's try that.

Let me denote the original point as \( (t, t^2 - 4) \). After rotation, the image point is:

\( x' = t \cos 60^\circ - (t^2 - 4)\sin 60^\circ \)

\( y' = t \sin 60^\circ + (t^2 - 4)\cos 60^\circ \)

Since the image point lies on the original parabola, \( y' = (x')^2 - 4 \).

So, plug in \( x' \) and \( y' \):

\( t \sin 60^\circ + (t^2 - 4)\cos 60^\circ = \left( t \cos 60^\circ - (t^2 - 4)\sin 60^\circ \right)^2 - 4 \)

This seems similar to the previous approach, but maybe it's easier to handle since it's parametric.

Let me write the values:

\( \cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \)

\( \sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \)

So, substituting:

\( t \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + (t^2 - 4) \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \left( t \cdot \frac{1}{2} - (t^2 - 4) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2 - 4 \)

Let me compute the left side:

Left side: \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t + \frac{1}{2}(t^2 - 4) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t + \frac{t^2}{2} - 2 \)

Right side: \( \left( \frac{t}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(t^2 - 4) \right)^2 - 4 \)

Let me compute the term inside the square on the right:

\( \frac{t}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(t^2 - 4) = \frac{t}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^2 + 2\sqrt{3} \)

So, squaring this:

\( \left( \frac{t}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^2 + 2\sqrt{3} \right)^2 \)

Let me denote \( A = \frac{t}{2} \), \( B = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^2 \), \( C = 2\sqrt{3} \). Then, \( (A + B + C)^2 = A^2 + B^2 + C^2 + 2AB + 2AC + 2BC \)

Compute each term:

1. \( A^2 = \left( \frac{t}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{t^2}{4} \)

2. \( B^2 = \left( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^2 \right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}t^4 \)

3. \( C^2 = (2\sqrt{3})^2 = 12 \)

4. \( 2AB = 2 \times \frac{t}{2} \times \left( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^2 \right) = 2 \times \left( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}t^3 \right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^3 \)

5. \( 2AC = 2 \times \frac{t}{2} \times 2\sqrt{3} = 2 \times \sqrt{3}t = 2\sqrt{3}t \)

6. \( 2BC = 2 \times \left( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^2 \right) \times 2\sqrt{3} = 2 \times \left( -\frac{3}{2}t^2 \right) = -3t^2 \)

Putting all together:

\( A^2 + B^2 + C^2 + 2AB + 2AC + 2BC = \frac{t^2}{4} + \frac{3}{4}t^4 + 12 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^3 + 2\sqrt{3}t - 3t^2 \)

Simplify like terms:

- \( t^4 \): \( \frac{3}{4}t^4 \)
- \( t^3 \): \( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^3 \)
- \( t^2 \): \( \frac{t^2}{4} - 3t^2 = -\frac{11}{4}t^2 \)
- \( t \): \( 2\sqrt{3}t \)
- Constants: \( 12 \)

So, the square is \( \frac{3}{4}t^4 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^3 - \frac{11}{4}t^2 + 2\sqrt{3}t + 12 \)

Therefore, the right side is this minus 4:

\( \frac{3}{4}t^4 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^3 - \frac{11}{4}t^2 + 2\sqrt{3}t + 12 - 4 = \frac{3}{4}t^4 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^3 - \frac{11}{4}t^2 + 2\sqrt{3}t + 8 \)

So, the equation is:

Left side: \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t + \frac{t^2}{2} - 2 \)

Right side: \( \frac{3}{4}t^4 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^3 - \frac{11}{4}t^2 + 2\sqrt{3}t + 8 \)

Bring all terms to left side:

\( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t + \frac{t^2}{2} - 2 - \frac{3}{4}t^4 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^3 + \frac{11}{4}t^2 - 2\sqrt{3}t - 8 = 0 \)

Simplify term by term:

- \( t^4 \): \( -\frac{3}{4}t^4 \)
- \( t^3 \): \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^3 \)
- \( t^2 \): \( \frac{1}{2}t^2 + \frac{11}{4}t^2 = \frac{13}{4}t^2 \)
- \( t \): \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t - 2\sqrt{3}t = -\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}t \)
- Constants: \( -2 - 8 = -10 \)

So, the equation becomes:

\( -\frac{3}{4}t^4 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t^3 + \frac{13}{4}t^2 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}t - 10 = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:

\( -3t^4 + 2\sqrt{3}t^3 + 13t^2 - 6\sqrt{3}t - 40 = 0 \)

This is the same quartic equation as before, just in terms of \( t \) instead of \( x \). So, either way, we end up with the same quartic. This seems difficult because quartic equations can be quite complicated.

But perhaps we can factor this equation or find rational roots. Let me check the Rational Root Theorem, which says that any possible rational root \( p/q \) must have \( p \) dividing the constant term and \( q \) dividing the leading coefficient.

The constant term is -40, and the leading coefficient is -3.

So, possible roots are \( \pm1, \pm2, \pm4, \pm5, \pm8, \pm10, \pm20, \pm40 \) divided by 1, 3. So, possible rational roots are \( \pm1, \pm2, \pm4, \pm5, \pm8, \pm10, \pm20, \pm40, \pm1/3, \pm2/3, \pm4/3, \pm5/3, \pm8/3, \pm10/3, \pm20/3, \pm40/3 \).

Since we're looking for a root in the fourth quadrant, which is x between 0 and 2, let's try plugging in t = 1, t = 2, t = 1/2, etc.

First, t = 1:

\( -3(1)^4 + 2\sqrt{3}(1)^3 + 13(1)^2 - 6\sqrt{3}(1) - 40 = -3 + 2\sqrt{3} + 13 - 6\sqrt{3} - 40 = (-3 + 13 - 40) + (2\sqrt{3} - 6\sqrt{3}) = (-30) + (-4\sqrt{3}) \) which is negative, so not zero.

t = 2:

\( -3(16) + 2\sqrt{3}(8) + 13(4) - 6\sqrt{3}(2) - 40 = -48 + 16\sqrt{3} + 52 - 12\sqrt{3} - 40 = (-48 + 52 - 40) + (16\sqrt{3} - 12\sqrt{3}) = (-36) + (4\sqrt{3}) \). Also not zero.

t = 1/2:

Compute each term:

\( -3*(1/2)^4 = -3*(1/16) = -3/16 \)

\( 2\sqrt{3}*(1/2)^3 = 2\sqrt{3}*(1/8) = \sqrt{3}/4 \)

\( 13*(1/2)^2 = 13*(1/4) = 13/4 \)

\( -6\sqrt{3}*(1/2) = -3\sqrt{3} \)

\( -40 \)

Adding all together:

\( -3/16 + \sqrt{3}/4 + 13/4 - 3\sqrt{3} - 40 \)

Convert to 16 denominator:

-3/16 + 4\sqrt{3}/16 + 52/16 - 48\sqrt{3}/16 - 640/16

Combine like terms:

Constants: (-3 + 52 - 640)/16 = (-621)/16

\( \sqrt{3} \) terms: (4 - 48)/16 \sqrt{3} = (-44)/16 \sqrt{3} = -11/4 \sqrt{3}

So total: \( -621/16 - 11\sqrt{3}/4 \) which is not zero.

t = 1/3:

\( -3*(1/3)^4 + 2\sqrt{3}*(1/3)^3 + 13*(1/3)^2 - 6\sqrt{3}*(1/3) - 40 \)

Compute each term:

\( -3*(1/81) = -1/27 \)

\( 2\sqrt{3}/(27) = 2\sqrt{3}/27 \)

\( 13*(1/9) = 13/9 \)

\( -6\sqrt{3}/3 = -2\sqrt{3} \)

\( -40 \)

Adding all:

\( -1/27 + 2\sqrt{3}/27 + 13/9 - 2\sqrt{3} - 40 \)

Convert to 27 denominator:

-1/27 + 2\sqrt{3}/27 + 39/27 - 54\sqrt{3}/27 - 1080/27

Combine like terms:

Constants: (-1 + 39 - 1080)/27 = (-1042)/27

\( \sqrt{3} \) terms: (2 - 54)/27 \sqrt{3} = (-52)/27 \sqrt{3}

So, total: \( -1042/27 - 52\sqrt{3}/27 \neq 0 \)

Not zero.

t = sqrt(3)/3 ≈ 0.577, which is less than 1, but maybe.

Wait, t is a variable for x, which is between 0 and 2 for the fourth quadrant intersection.

Maybe trying t = sqrt(3):

Compute each term:

\( -3*(sqrt(3))^4 = -3*(9) = -27 \)

\( 2\sqrt{3}*(sqrt(3))^3 = 2\sqrt{3}*(3*sqrt(3)) = 2\sqrt{3}*3\sqrt{3} = 2*3*3 = 18 \)

\( 13*(sqrt(3))^2 = 13*3 = 39 \)

\( -6\sqrt{3}*sqrt(3) = -6*3 = -18 \)

\( -40 \)

Adding up:

-27 + 18 + 39 - 18 - 40 = (-27 - 40) + (18 + 39 - 18) = (-67) + (39) = -28 ≠ 0

t = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866

Compute:

\( -3*(sqrt(3)/2)^4 + 2\sqrt{3}*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 + 13*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 - 6\sqrt{3}*(sqrt(3)/2) - 40 \)

Compute each term:

\( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 \), so \( (sqrt(3)/2)^4 = (3/4)^2 = 9/16 \)

So,

-3*(9/16) = -27/16

\( 2\sqrt{3}*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 = 2\sqrt{3}*(3*sqrt(3)/8) = 2\sqrt{3}*(3\sqrt{3}/8) = (6*3)/8 = 18/8 = 9/4 \)

13*(3/4) = 39/4

\( -6\sqrt{3}*(sqrt(3)/2) = -6\sqrt{3}*(sqrt(3)/2) = -6*(3)/2 = -9 \)

-40

Adding all:

-27/16 + 9/4 + 39/4 - 9 - 40

Convert to 16 denominator:

-27/16 + 36/16 + 156/16 - 144/16 - 640/16

Compute constants:

(-27 + 36 + 156 - 144 - 640)/16

= (-27 + 36 = 9; 9 + 156 = 165; 165 - 144 = 21; 21 - 640 = -619)/16

So, total: -619/16 ≈ -38.6875 ≠ 0

Not zero.

This is getting tedious. Maybe instead of trying rational roots, I can see if the quartic factors into quadratics.

Suppose the quartic factors as \( (-3t^4 + 2\sqrt{3}t^3 + 13t^2 - 6\sqrt{3}t - 40) = (at^2 + bt + c)(dt^2 + et + f) \)

Multiply out:

\( ad t^4 + (ae + bd) t^3 + (af + be + cd) t^2 + (bf + ce) t + cf \)

Comparing coefficients:

1. \( ad = -3 \)
2. \( ae + bd = 2\sqrt{3} \)
3. \( af + be + cd = 13 \)
4. \( bf + ce = -6\sqrt{3} \)
5. \( cf = -40 \)

So, need to find integers a, b, c, d, e, f such that these are satisfied.

Looking at 1: \( ad = -3 \). So possible pairs (a,d) = (3, -1), (-3, 1), (1, -3), (-1, 3), etc.

Similarly, 5: \( cf = -40 \). So possible pairs (c,f) are (1, -40), (-1, 40), (2, -20), (-2, 20), (4, -10), (-4, 10), (5, -8), (-5, 8), (8, -5), (-8,5), (10, -4), (-10,4), (20, -2), (-20,2), (40, -1), (-40,1)

Let me try a = 3, d = -1.

Then, 1: okay.

Then, 5: c and f such that c*f = -40.

Trying c = 5, f = -8.

Then, 2: ae + bd = 3e + (-1)b = 3e - b = 2√3. Hmm, not likely since 3e - b is an integer, but RHS is irrational. So, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps c = 8, f = -5.

Then, 2: 3e - b = 2√3, same issue.

Alternatively, maybe a different pair for c and f.

Wait, perhaps c = -5, f = 8.

Then, 2: 3e - b = 2√3. Still irrational.

Alternatively, maybe c = 10, f = -4.

Then, 2: 3e - b = 2√3. Still problem.

Alternatively, perhaps c = -10, f = 4.

Then, 2: 3e - b = 2√3. Hmm, same issue.

Alternatively, perhaps a different a and d.

Let me try a = -3, d = 1.

Then, 1: (-3)(1) = -3, okay.

Then, 5: c*f = -40.

Trying c = 5, f = -8.

Then, 2: (-3)e + 1*b = -3e + b = 2√3. So, equation: -3e + b = 2√3.

Which would require b = 3e + 2√3. But b and e are integers, so 3e + 2√3 is irrational, which is impossible. So, discard.

Alternatively, c = 8, f = -5.

Then, 2: (-3)e + 1*b = -3e + b = 2√3. Similarly, b = 3e + 2√3. Not integer.

Similarly, c = -5, f = 8.

Then, 2: (-3)e + b = 2√3. So, b = 3e + 2√3. Still not integer.

Alternatively, c = 4, f = -10.

Then, 2: (-3)e + b = 2√3. So, b = 3e + 2√3. Still, same issue.

Alternatively, c = -4, f =10.

Then, 2: (-3)e + b = 2√3. So, b = 3e + 2√3. Again, same problem.

Hmm, perhaps a = 1, d = -3.

Then, 1: (1)(-3) = -3, okay.

Then, 5: c*f = -40.

Let me try c = 5, f = -8.

Then, 2: 1*e + (-3)*b = e - 3b = 2√3.

Hmm, e - 3b = 2√3.

But e and b are integers, so e - 3b is integer, but RHS is irrational. So, impossible.

Alternatively, c = -5, f =8.

Then, 2: e - 3b = 2√3. Again, same problem.

c = 8, f = -5.

Then, 2: e - 3b = 2√3. Still same.

c = -8, f =5.

Then, 2: e - 3b = 2√3. Still no.

Alternatively, c =10, f = -4.

Then, 2: e - 3b = 2√3. Same issue.

c = -10, f =4.

Then, 2: e - 3b = 2√3. Same.

Hmm, not working.

Alternatively, maybe a = -1, d = 3.

Then, 1: (-1)(3) = -3, okay.

5: c*f = -40.

Trying c =5, f = -8.

Then, 2: (-1)e +3b = -e + 3b = 2√3.

So, 3b - e = 2√3. Again, 3b - e is integer, RHS is irrational. Not possible.

Similarly, c = -5, f =8.

Then, 2: -e +3b = 2√3. Again, same issue.

c =8, f= -5.

Then, 2: -e +3b = 2√3. Same.

c = -8, f=5.

Then, 2: -e +3b = 2√3. Same.

c=10, f=-4.

Then, 2: -e +3b = 2√3. Same.

c=-10, f=4.

Then, 2: -e +3b = 2√3. Same.

Not working.

Hmm, perhaps this quartic doesn't factor into quadratics with integer coefficients. Maybe it's better to consider substitution.

Wait, looking back at the original problem, maybe we can avoid the quartic equation. Perhaps parametrize the original parabola and then find the image equation.

But earlier, that approach also leads to the same quartic.

Alternatively, maybe consider using complex numbers. The rotation can be represented as a complex multiplication.

Let me try that.

Express the point \( (x, y) \) as a complex number \( z = x + iy \).

Rotation by 60 degrees is equivalent to multiplying by \( e^{i\pi/3} = \cos 60^\circ + i \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

So, the image point is \( z' = z \times e^{i\pi/3} \).

So, \( z' = (x + iy)(\frac{1}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) \)

Multiply this out:

\( z' = x \cdot \frac{1}{2} + x \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + iy \cdot \frac{1}{2} + iy \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \)

Simplify each term:

1. \( x \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{2} \)
2. \( x \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x \)
3. \( iy \cdot \frac{1}{2} = i \frac{y}{2} \)
4. \( iy \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = i^2 \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} y = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} y \)

Combine all terms:

\( z' = \frac{x}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} y + i \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{y}{2} \right) \)

So, the image point in complex plane is \( z' = \left( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} y \right) + i \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{y}{2} \right) \)

Since \( z' \) lies on the original parabola \( y' = x'^2 - 4 \), which in complex terms is the imaginary part equals the square of the real part minus 4.

So, equate the imaginary part to the square of the real part minus 4:

Imaginary part of \( z' \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{y}{2} \)

Real part of \( z' \) is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} y \)

So, set:

\( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{y}{2} = \left( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} y \right)^2 - 4 \)

Which is the same equation as before. So, same quartic.

It seems like no matter the approach, we end up with the same quartic equation.

Hmm, maybe instead of trying to solve the quartic directly, I can use substitution.

Let me note that in the original equation, \( y = x^2 - 4 \). So, perhaps substituting \( y \) in terms of \( x \) into the quartic equation.

Wait, but we already did that earlier.

Alternatively, maybe we can use substitution like \( t = x + k \) to eliminate the cubic term, but that might complicate more.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution \( x = u \cos \theta - v \sin \theta \) and \( y = u \sin \theta + v \cos \theta \), which is a rotation, but I think that's similar to the earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps a better idea is to rotate the coordinate system. Since we're rotating the parabola by 60 degrees, maybe it's easier to consider rotating the coordinate system by -60 degrees so that the parabola is expressed in the new coordinates, and then find the intersection.

So, let me try that.

Let me denote the original coordinates as (x, y). Let me define a new coordinate system (x', y') obtained by rotating the original system by -60 degrees. So, the rotation matrix is:

\( x' = x \cos(-60^\circ) - y \sin(-60^\circ) = x \cdot \frac{1}{2} - y \cdot (-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} y \)

\( y' = x \sin(-60^\circ) + y \cos(-60^\circ) = x \cdot (-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + y \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{y}{2} \)

In this new coordinate system, the original parabola equation \( y = x^2 - 4 \) can be expressed in terms of x' and y'.

So, express \( y \) in terms of x' and y':

From the rotation equations:

We have:

\( x' = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} y \)

\( y' = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{y}{2} \)

Let me solve these equations for x and y.

First, from the second equation:

\( y' = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{y}{2} \)

Multiply both sides by 2:

\( 2y' = -\sqrt{3}x + y \)

So, \( y = 2y' + \sqrt{3}x \)

Now, substitute this into the first equation:

\( x' = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} y = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(2y' + \sqrt{3}x) \)

Simplify:

\( x' = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 2 y' + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{3} x \)

Simplify term by term:

\( x' = \frac{x}{2} + \sqrt{3} y' + \frac{3}{2}x \)

Combine like terms:

\( x' = \left( \frac{x}{2} + \frac{3x}{2} \right) + \sqrt{3} y' = 2x + \sqrt{3} y' \)

So, \( x' = 2x + \sqrt{3} y' \)

From this, we can express x in terms of x' and y':

\( x = \frac{x' - \sqrt{3} y'}{2} \)

Now, plug this back into the expression for y:

\( y = 2y' + \sqrt{3}x = 2y' + \sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{x' - \sqrt{3} y'}{2} \)

Simplify:

\( y = 2y' + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x' - \frac{3}{2} y' \)

Combine like terms:

\( y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x' + \left(2y' - \frac{3}{2} y'\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x' + \frac{1}{2}y' \)

So, now we have:

\( x = \frac{x' - \sqrt{3} y'}{2} \)

\( y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x' + \frac{1}{2} y' \)

Now, substitute these expressions into the original parabola equation \( y = x^2 - 4 \):

\( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x' + \frac{1}{2} y' = \left( \frac{x' - \sqrt{3} y'}{2} \right)^2 - 4 \)

Simplify the right side:

\( \left( \frac{x' - \sqrt{3} y'}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{(x')^2 - 2x' \sqrt{3} y' + 3(y')^2}{4} \)

So, the equation becomes:

\( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x' + \frac{1}{2} y' = \frac{(x')^2 - 2\sqrt{3}x' y' + 3(y')^2}{4} - 4 \)

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:

\( 2\sqrt{3}x' + 2 y' = (x')^2 - 2\sqrt{3}x' y' + 3(y')^2 - 16 \)

Bring all terms to one side:

\( (x')^2 - 2\sqrt{3}x' y' + 3(y')^2 - 16 - 2\sqrt{3}x' - 2 y' = 0 \)

So, the equation in the rotated coordinate system is:

\( (x')^2 - 2\sqrt{3}x' y' + 3(y')^2 - 2\sqrt{3}x' - 2 y' - 16 = 0 \)

Hmm, that's still a complicated equation. Perhaps it's better to now express this equation in terms of y' and x', but I don't see an easy way.

Wait, but we're looking for the intersection point in the original coordinate system. But in the rotated system, the intersection point lies on both the rotated parabola and the original parabola.

Wait, no, the image of the parabola is a different curve, but in the rotated coordinate system, the image parabola is expressed as above.

But the intersection point in the original coordinate system is a point that lies on both the original parabola and its image. But in the rotated system, that point would have coordinates (x', y') such that it lies on the image parabola, which is the equation above, and also lies on the original parabola.

Wait, this seems too vague. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that in the rotated coordinate system, the fixed point lies on both the original parabola and the rotated parabola.

But since the fixed point is the same in both coordinate systems, it's (x, y) in original and (x', y') in rotated, but (x, y) lies on both the original and rotated parabola.

But that might not be directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the fixed point as (x, x^2 - 4) and set it equal to the rotated coordinates (x', y') and solve for x.

Wait, but this seems circular.

Wait, let's think differently. The fixed point (x, y) is on both the original parabola and its image. So, in the rotated coordinate system, the point (x, y) corresponds to (x', y'), which is on the image parabola. But since (x, y) is fixed, it must satisfy both the original equation and the image equation.

But in the rotated system, the image parabola is given by \( (x')^2 - 2\sqrt{3}x' y' + 3(y')^2 - 2\sqrt{3}x' - 2 y' - 16 = 0 \)

But also, in the original system, \( y = x^2 - 4 \). So, in the rotated system, the point (x, y) corresponds to some (x', y'), which must satisfy both the image parabola equation and the original equation.

But I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to step back.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of using coordinates, think geometrically. The original parabola is y = x² - 4, which is an upward-opening parabola with vertex at (0, -4). Rotating it 60 degrees counterclockwise about the origin would tilt it. The intersection point in the fourth quadrant is where the original parabola and its image intersect.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to parametrize the fixed point as (x, x² - 4) and also as the rotated image of some point on the original parabola.

Wait, but the fixed point is on both, so (x, x² - 4) must be the image of some point (t, t² - 4) under the rotation. So, (x, x² - 4) = rotation of (t, t² -4).

Therefore, using the rotation equations:

\( x = t \cos 60^\circ - (t² - 4)\sin 60^\circ \)

\( x² - 4 = t \sin 60^\circ + (t² - 4)\cos 60^\circ \)

Which is the same system as before. So, same quartic.

Hmm, maybe I can consider using substitution for t.

Let me write down the two equations again:

1. \( x = \frac{1}{2}t - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(t² - 4) \)

2. \( x² - 4 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t + \frac{1}{2}(t² - 4) \)

So, from equation 1, \( x = \frac{1}{2}t - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t² + 2\sqrt{3} \). Let's denote this as equation 1a.

From equation 2, \( x² - 4 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t + \frac{1}{2}t² - 2 \). Let's denote this as equation 2a.

So, equation 2a can be rewritten as:

\( x² = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t + \frac{1}{2}t² - 2 + 4 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t + \frac{1}{2}t² + 2 \)

So, \( x² = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t + \frac{1}{2}t² + 2 \)

From equation 1a, \( x = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t² + \frac{1}{2}t + 2\sqrt{3} \)

Let me denote \( u = t \). So, equation 1a is:

\( x = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}u² + \frac{1}{2}u + 2\sqrt{3} \)

Equation 2a:

\( x² = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}u + \frac{1}{2}u² + 2 \)

So, we can substitute equation 1a into equation 2a.

Let me denote equation 1a as:

\( x = A u² + B u + C \), where \( A = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), \( B = \frac{1}{2} \), \( C = 2\sqrt{3} \)

Then, equation 2a is:

\( x² = D u + E u² + F \), where \( D = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), \( E = \frac{1}{2} \), \( F = 2 \)

So, substituting x into equation 2a:

\( (A u² + B u + C)^2 = D u + E u² + F \)

Which is exactly the quartic equation we had before.

Therefore, this seems unavoidable. So, perhaps despite the quartic being complex, we can attempt to find a solution.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider that the equation is a quadratic in t² or something.

Wait, looking at the quartic:

\( -3t^4 - 2\sqrt{3}t^3 + 13t^2 - 6\sqrt{3}t - 40 = 0 \)

Let me try to factor out a common term. It's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution \( s = t + \frac{k}{t} \), but that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe the quartic can be factored into two quadratics with real coefficients. Let me try that.

Assume \( -3t^4 - 2\sqrt{3}t^3 + 13t^2 - 6\sqrt{3}t - 40 = (a t^2 + b t + c)(d t^2 + e t + f) \)

Multiply them out:

\( a d t^4 + (a e + b d) t^3 + (a f + b e + c d) t^2 + (b f + c e) t + c f \)

Set equal to:

\( -3t^4 - 2\sqrt{3}t^3 + 13t^2 - 6\sqrt{3}t - 40 \)

So, we have the following equations:

1. \( a d = -3 \)

2. \( a e + b d = -2\sqrt{3} \)

3. \( a f + b e + c d = 13 \)

4. \( b f + c e = -6\sqrt{3} \)

5. \( c f = -40 \)

Let me try to find integer or rational values for a, b, c, d, e, f.

Given that \( a d = -3 \), possible pairs (a, d) are (3, -1), (-3, 1), (1, -3), (-1, 3), etc.

Let me try a=3, d=-1.

Then, equation 1: 3*(-1) = -3, okay.

Equation 2: 3 e + b*(-1) = -2√3.

So, 3e - b = -2√3.

Equation 3: 3 f + b e + c*(-1) = 13.

Equation 4: b f + c e = -6√3.

Equation 5: c f = -40.

So, we have:

Equation 2: 3e - b = -2√3.

Equation 3: 3f + b e - c = 13.

Equation 4: b f + c e = -6√3.

Equation 5: c f = -40.

Now, equation 5: c f = -40.

Let me try possible integer pairs for c and f such that c f = -40.

Possible pairs (c, f): (1, -40), (-1, 40), (2, -20), (-2,20), (4, -10), (-4,10), (5, -8), (-5,8), (8, -5), (-8,5), (10, -4), (-10,4), (20, -2), (-20,2), (40, -1), (-40,1)

Try c=5, f=-8.

Then, equation 5: 5*(-8)= -40, okay.

Equation 2: 3e - b = -2√3.

Equation 3: 3*(-8) + b e -5 = -24 + b e -5 = b e -29 = 13 => b e = 42.

Equation 4: b*(-8) + 5 e = -8b +5 e = -6√3.

So, from equation 2: 3e - b = -2√3 => b = 3e + 2√3.

From equation 3: b e = 42.

Substitute b: (3e + 2√3) e = 42 => 3e² + 2√3 e -42 =0.

This is a quadratic in e: 3e² + 2√3 e -42 =0.

Solve for e:

e = [ -2√3 ± sqrt( (2√3)^2 - 4*3*(-42) ) ] / (2*3)

Compute discriminant:

(2√3)^2 = 4*3=12

4*3*(-42) = -504

So, sqrt(12 + 504) = sqrt(516) = sqrt(4*129) = 2 sqrt(129). Hmm, irrational.

Thus, e is irrational, which complicates things. So, maybe c=5, f=-8 is not suitable.

Try c=8, f=-5.

Equation 5: 8*(-5)= -40, okay.

Equation 2: 3e - b = -2√3.

Equation 3: 3*(-5) + b e -8 = -15 + b e -8 = b e -23 =13 => b e = 36.

Equation 4: b*(-5) + 8 e = -5b +8 e = -6√3.

From equation 2: b = 3e + 2√3.

Plug into equation 3: (3e + 2√3) e = 36 => 3e² + 2√3 e -36 =0.

Solve for e:

e = [ -2√3 ± sqrt( (2√3)^2 -4*3*(-36) ) ] / (2*3) = [ -2√3 ± sqrt(12 + 432) ] /6 = [ -2√3 ± sqrt(444) ] /6.

Simplify sqrt(444): sqrt(4*111)=2 sqrt(111). So,

e = [ -2√3 ± 2 sqrt(111) ] /6 = [ -√3 ± sqrt(111) ] /3.

Again, irrational. So, equation 2 gives irrational e, which is problematic.

Try c=10, f=-4.

Equation 5:10*(-4)= -40, okay.

Equation 2:3e - b = -2√3.

Equation 3:3*(-4) + b e -10 = -12 + b e -10 = b e -22 =13 => b e =35.

Equation 4: b*(-4) + 10 e = -4b +10 e = -6√3.

From equation 2: b = 3e + 2√3.

Plug into equation 3: (3e + 2√3) e =35 =>3e² + 2√3 e -35=0.

Solve for e:

e = [ -2√3 ± sqrt( (2√3)^2 -4*3*(-35) ) ] / (2*3) = [ -2√3 ± sqrt(12 + 420) ] /6= [ -2√3 ± sqrt(432) ] /6.

Simplify sqrt(432)=sqrt(16*27)=4*sqrt(27)=4*3*sqrt(3)=12√3.

Thus,

e = [ -2√3 ±12√3 ] /6.

So,

e = (10√3)/6 = (5√3)/3, or e= (-14√3)/6= (-7√3)/3.

First, e=(5√3)/3.

Then, from equation 2: b=3*(5√3/3) +2√3=5√3 +2√3=7√3.

From equation 4: -4b +10e = -4*(7√3) +10*(5√3/3)= -28√3 + (50√3)/3= (-84√3 +50√3)/3= (-34√3)/3 ≠ -6√3. So, no.

Second, e= (-7√3)/3.

Then, b=3*(-7√3/3) +2√3= -7√3 +2√3= -5√3.

From equation 4: -4*(-5√3) +10*(-7√3/3)=20√3 -70√3/3= (60√3 -70√3)/3= (-10√3)/3 ≠ -6√3.

So, doesn't satisfy equation 4.

Thus, c=10, f=-4 doesn't work.

Try c=-5, f=8.

Equation 5: (-5)*8= -40, okay.

Equation 2:3e - b= -2√3.

Equation 3:3*8 +b e - (-5)=24 +b e +5= b e +29=13 => b e= -16.

Equation 4: b*8 + (-5)e=8b -5e= -6√3.

From equation 2: b=3e +2√3.

Plug into equation3: (3e +2√3)e= -16 =>3e² +2√3 e +16=0.

Discriminant: (2√3)^2 -4*3*16=12 -192= -180 <0. So, no real solution.

Thus, no.

Try c=-8, f=5.

Equation 5: (-8)*5= -40, okay.

Equation 2:3e - b= -2√3.

Equation3:3*5 + b e - (-8)=15 +b e +8= b e +23=13 =>b e= -10.

Equation4: b*5 + (-8)e=5b -8e= -6√3.

From equation2: b=3e +2√3.

Plug into equation4:5*(3e +2√3) -8e=15e +10√3 -8e=7e +10√3= -6√3.

Thus, 7e= -16√3 => e= (-16√3)/7.

Then, b=3*(-16√3/7) +2√3= (-48√3/7) +14√3/7= (-34√3)/7.

Check equation3: b e= [ (-34√3)/7 ] * [ (-16√3)/7 ]= (34*16*3)/49= (1632)/49 ≈33.3. But equation3 says b e= -10. Doesn't match.

Thus, no.

Try c=4, f=-10.

Thus, -26e= 14√3 => e= -14√3 /26= -7√3 /13.

Then, b=3*(-7√3 /13) +2√3= (-21√3)/13 +26√3/13=5√3/13.

Check equation3: b e= (5√3/13) * (-7√3/13)= (-35*3)/169= (-105)/169 ≈-0.62. But equation3 says b e=47. Not matching.

From equation2: b=3e +2√3.

Plug into equation4:10*(3e +2√3) -4e=30e +20√3 -4e=26e +20√3= -6√3.

Thus,26e= -26√3 => e= -√3.

Then, b=3*(-√3) +2√3= -3√3 +2√3= -√3.

Check equation3: b e= (-√3)*(-√3)= 3. But equation3 says b e= -21. Not matching.

Nope.

Another pair: c=2, f=-20.

Equation5:2*(-20)= -40, okay.

Equation2:3e -b= -2√3.

Equation3:3*(-20) +b e -2= -60 +b e -2= b e -62=13 =>b e=75.

Equation4: b*(-20) +2 e= -20b +2e= -6√3.

From equation2: b=3e +2√3.

Plug into equation4: -20*(3e +2√3) +2e= -60e -40√3 +2e= -58e -40√3= -6√3.

Thus, -58e= 34√3 => e= -34√3 /58= -17√3 /29.

Then, b=3*(-17√3 /29) +2√3= (-51√3)/29 +58√3/29=7√3/29.

Check equation3: b e= (7√3 /29)*(-17√3 /29)= (-119*3)/841= (-357)/841 ≈-0.424. But equation3 says b e=75. Nope.

Another pair: c= -2, f=20.

Equation5: (-2)*20= -40, okay.

Equation2:3e -b= -2√3.

Equation3:3*20 +b e - (-2)=60 +b e +2= b e +62=13 =>b e= -49.

From equation2: b=3e +2√3.

Plug into equation4:20*(3e +2√3) -2e=60e +40√3 -2e=58e +40√3= -6√3.

Thus,58e= -46√3 => e= (-46√3)/58= (-23√3)/29.

Then, b=3*(-23√3 /29) +2√3= (-69√3)/29 +58√3/29= (-11√3)/29.

Check equation3: b e= [ (-11√3)/29 ] * [ (-23√3)/29 ]= (253*3)/841=759/841≈0.903. But equation3 says b e= -49. Doesn't match.

No.

Another pair: c=1, f= -40.

Equation5:1*(-40)= -40, okay.

Equation2:3e -b= -2√3.

Equation3:3*(-40) +b e -1= -120 +b e -1= b e -121=13 =>b e=134.

Equation4: b*(-40) +1*e= -40b +e= -6√3.

From equation2: b=3e +2√3.

Plug into equation4: -40*(3e +2√3) +e= -120e -80√3 +e= -119e -80√3= -6√3.

Thus, -119e=74√3 => e= -74√3 /119.

Then, b=3*(-74√3 /119) +2√3= (-222√3)/119 +238√3/119=16√3/119.

Check equation3: b e= (16√3 /119)*(-74√3 /119)= (-16*74*3)/14161= (-3552)/14161≈-0.251. But equation3 says b e=134. Nope.

Similarly, other pairs would likely lead to similar issues.

So, maybe the quartic doesn't factor into quadratics with integer coefficients. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the quartic is a quadratic in \( t^2 \). Let me see.

Wait, original quartic is:

\( -3t^4 - 2\sqrt{3}t^3 + 13t^2 - 6\sqrt{3}t - 40 = 0 \)

It's not obviously a quadratic in \( t^2 \) because of the linear and cubic terms.

Alternatively, maybe using the substitution \( u = t + k \), but I don't see a clear path.

Alternatively, maybe using the rational root theorem but considering possible roots with radicals.

Wait, perhaps suppose that t is of the form \( t = \frac{m + n\sqrt{3}}{p} \), where m, n, p are integers.

This is a common technique in such problems.

So, let me assume that \( t = \frac{a + b\sqrt{3}}{c} \), where a, b, c are integers with c ≠0.

Then, plug into the quartic equation and solve for a, b, c.

This might be time-consuming, but let's attempt.

Let me denote \( t = \frac{a + b\sqrt{3}}{c} \), then \( t^2 = \frac{(a + b\sqrt{3})^2}{c^2} = \frac{a² + 2ab\sqrt{3} + 3b²}{c²} \)

Similarly, \( t^3 = \frac{(a + b\sqrt{3})^3}{c^3}= \frac{a³ + 3a² b\sqrt{3} + 3a b² *3 + b³*(3\sqrt{3})}{c³}= \frac{a³ + 3a b² *3 + (3a² b + 3b³)\sqrt{3}}{c³}= \frac{a³ +9ab² + (3a² b + 3b³)\sqrt{3}}{c³} \)

Similarly, \( t^4 = \left( \frac{a + b\sqrt{3}}{c} \right)^4= \frac{(a + b\sqrt{3})^4}{c^4} \). Calculating this would be more involved, but likely we can expand it.

But perhaps this approach is too tedious.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that the quartic is a quadratic in \( t \) with coefficients involving sqrt(3). Maybe using substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let \( t = k \sqrt{3} \), where k is a rational number. Maybe this would help, as sqrt(3) appears in the equation.

Let me set \( t = k \sqrt{3} \). Then, \( t^2 = 3k² \), \( t^3 = 3√3 k³ \), \( t^4=9k⁴ \).

Substitute into the quartic:

\( -3*(9k⁴) - 2√3*(3√3 k³) +13*(3k²) -6√3*(√3 k) -40 = 0 \)

Simplify each term:

1. \( -3*9k⁴ = -27k⁴ \)
2. \( -2√3*3√3 k³ = -2*3*3 k³ = -18k³ \)
3. \(13*3k² = 39k² \)
4. \( -6√3*√3 k = -6*3 k = -18k \)
5. -40

So, equation becomes:

\( -27k⁴ -18k³ +39k² -18k -40 =0 \)

Multiply both sides by -1:

\(27k⁴ +18k³ -39k² +18k +40=0\)

Now, this is a quartic equation in k, with integer coefficients. Maybe this factors.

Let me try rational roots. Possible rational roots are factors of 40 over factors of 27, so ±1, ±2, ±4, ±5, ±8, ±10, ±20, ±40, ±1/3, etc.

Test k=1:

27 +18 -39 +18 +40=27+18=45; 45-39=6; 6+18=24; 24+40=64≠0.

k= -1:

27*(-1)^4 +18*(-1)^3 -39*(-1)^2 +18*(-1) +40=27 -18 -39 -18 +40= (27-18)=9; (9-39)=-30; (-30-18)=-48; (-48+40)=-8≠0.

k=2:

27*16 +18*8 -39*4 +18*2 +40=432 +144 -156 +36 +40=432+144=576; 576-156=420; 420+36=456; 456+40=496≠0.

k= -2:

27*16 +18*(-8) -39*4 +18*(-2) +40=432 -144 -156 -36 +40=432-144=288; 288-156=132; 132-36=96; 96+40=136≠0.

k=4: Maybe too big, but let's try:

27*256 +18*64 -39*16 +18*4 +40=6912 +1152 -624 +72 +40=6912+1152=8064; 8064-624=7440; 7440+72=7512; 7512+40=7552≠0.

k=1/3:

27*(1/81) +18*(1/27) -39*(1/9) +18*(1/3) +40=27/81 +18/27 -39/9 +6 +40=1/3 + 2/3 -13/3 +6 +40= (1+2-13)/3 +46= (-10)/3 +46= ( -10 +138 ) /3=128/3≠0.

k= -1/3:

27*(1/81) +18*(-1/27) -39*(1/9) +18*(-1/3) +40=27/81 + (-18)/27 -39/9 -6 +40=1/3 - 2/3 -13/3 -6 +40= (1-2-13)/3 +34= (-14)/3 +34= ( -14 +102 ) /3=88/3≠0.

k=5: Too big, likely not.

k= -4: Similarly, too big.

Hmm, perhaps this quartic doesn't have rational roots. So, perhaps this approach is also stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the quartic can be factored into quadratics with integer coefficients by another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the substitution \( w = t + something \), but without knowing, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe using the quartic formula, but that's too time-consuming.

Alternatively, since I need only one real root in the fourth quadrant, maybe I can use the fact that it's the only intersection in that quadrant, so perhaps I can approximate it numerically.

But since I'm supposed to get an exact answer, that won't help. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the rotation process. Maybe I should have rotated the original parabola, not the point.

Let me double-check.

If I rotate the parabola, it's equivalent to rotating the coordinate system. So, the fixed point is (x, y) on both the original and rotated parabola. So, rotating the parabola by 60 degrees, which would give another parabola, and the intersection of the two parabolas would be the fixed point.

But maybe I can parametrize the rotated parabola.

Alternatively, since the original parabola is y =x² -4. If I rotate this parabola by 60 degrees, I can parametrize the rotated parabola.

Parametric equations for the original parabola are:

x = t

y = t² -4

So, the rotated point is:

x' = x cos θ - y sin θ = t cos 60° - (t² -4) sin 60°

y' = x sin θ + y cos θ = t sin 60° + (t² -4) cos 60°

So, parametric equations for the rotated parabola are:

x' = (1/2)t - (√3/2)(t² -4)

y' = (√3/2)t + (1/2)(t² -4)

So, the rotated parabola is:

x' = (1/2)t - (√3/2)t² + 2√3

y' = (√3/2)t + (1/2)t² - 2

Now, the fixed point (x, y) lies on both the original and rotated parabola, so:

x = t

y = t² -4

and

x = (1/2)s - (√3/2)s² + 2√3

y = (√3/2)s + (1/2)s² - 2

Where s is the parameter for the rotated parabola.

Thus, equating x and y:

t = (1/2)s - (√3/2)s² + 2√3  ...(A)

t² -4 = (√3/2)s + (1/2)s² - 2  ...(B)

So, same as before. So, maybe I can subtract equation (A) from equation (B) or something.

Wait, equation (A): t = (1/2)s - (√3/2)s² + 2√3

Equation (B): t² = (√3/2)s + (1/2)s² - 2 +4= (√3/2)s + (1/2)s² +2

So, t² = (1/2)s² + (√3/2)s +2

So, equation (B) is same as equation (1). So, same as earlier.

So, the quartic is the same.

Alternatively, maybe I can write equation (A) as:

t = - (√3/2)s² + (1/2)s + 2√3

So, multiplying both sides by 2:

2t = -√3 s² + s +4√3

Rearranged:

√3 s² -s + (2t -4√3)=0

Which is a quadratic in s:

√3 s² -s + (2t -4√3)=0

So, discriminant D=1 -4*√3*(2t -4√3)=1 -8√3 t +48=49 -8√3 t

Since s must be real, D ≥0, so 49 -8√3 t ≥0 => t ≤49/(8√3)= 49√3 /24 ≈ 3.41.

So, t is ≤ ~3.41.

But regardless, this doesn't help with solving.

Wait, maybe using the fact that the fixed point lies in the fourth quadrant, so t must be negative. So, t <0. So, we're looking for negative real roots of the quartic.

Let me compute the quartic for t= -2:

-3*(-2)^4 -2√3*(-2)^3 +13*(-2)^2 -6√3*(-2) -40

= -3*16 -2√3*(-8)+13*4 -6√3*(-2) -40

= -48 +16√3 +52 +12√3 -40

= (-48 +52 -40) + (16√3 +12√3)

= (-36) +28√3 ≈-36 +48.49≈12.49>0

At t=-2, quartic≈12.49

At t=-3:

-3*81 -2√3*(-27) +13*9 -6√3*(-3) -40

= -243 +54√3 +117 +18√3 -40

= (-243 +117 -40) + (54√3 +18√3)

= (-166) +72√3 ≈-166 +124.7≈-41.3<0

So, quartic crosses zero between t=-3 and t=-2.

Also, at t=0: -3*0 -2√3*0 +13*0 -0 -40= -40 <0

At t approaching -infty: leading term -3t⁴, which tends to -infty.

So, the quartic goes from -infty at t=-infty, comes up, crosses zero between t=-3 and t=-2, then goes to -infty as t approaches +infty.

Wait, but the quartic is negative at t=0 and t=-2, positive at t=-3, so only one real root in t < -2.

Wait, but the fixed point is in the fourth quadrant, which corresponds to t <0.

But in our case, the fixed point is in the fourth quadrant, so t must be negative. So, the fixed point corresponds to the real root t <0.

So, since the quartic crosses zero once between t=-3 and t=-2, and another crossing? Wait, quartic is degree four, so must have even number of real roots.

But perhaps only two real roots: one negative, one positive, but the positive may not correspond to the intersection in the fourth quadrant.

Wait, let me compute quartic at t=4:

-3*(256) -2√3*(64) +13*16 -6√3*4 -40

= -768 -128√3 +208 -24√3 -40

= (-768 +208 -40) + (-128√3 -24√3)

= (-600) + (-152√3 )≈-600 -262≈-862 <0

At t= -4:

-3*256 -2√3*(-64) +13*16 -6√3*(-4) -40

= -768 +128√3 +208 +24√3 -40

= (-768 +208 -40) + (128√3 +24√3)

= (-600) +152√3≈-600 +262≈-338 <0

So, quartic is negative at t=-4, t=-3, t=-2, t=0, and positive at t approaching +infty.

Wait, but at t=-1:

-3*1 -2√3*(-1)^3 +13*1 -6√3*(-1) -40

= -3 +2√3 +13 +6√3 -40

= (-3 +13 -40) + (2√3 +6√3)

= (-30) +8√3≈-30 +13.85≈-16.15 <0

So, seems like quartic is negative for all t < approx t≈-2.5? Hmm.

Wait, from t=-infty, quartic tends to -infty, then comes up, crosses zero between t=-3 and t=-2, then goes back to -infty as t approaches +infty.

So, only one real root at t≈-2.5?

Wait, but quartic is negative at t=0, and positive at t approaching +infty? Wait, no, at t approaching +infty, leading term is -3t⁴, so it tends to -infty.

Wait, maybe I need to re-examine.

Wait, quartic is -3t⁴ -2√3 t³ +13 t² -6√3 t -40=0.

As t approaches +infty: -3t⁴ dominates, so tends to -infty.

As t approaches -infty: -3t⁴ dominates, which is negative, but t⁴ is positive, so overall -3t⁴ tends to -infty.

Wait, so quartic tends to -infty on both ends. So, if it's positive somewhere, it must cross zero twice.

Wait, at t=0, it's -40. At t=1, it's -3 -2√3 +13 -6√3 -40= (-3+13-40)+( -2√3 -6√3)= (-30) -8√3≈-30 -13.85≈-43.85

At t=2: -3*16 -2√3*8 +13*4 -6√3*2 -40= -48 -16√3 +52 -12√3 -40= (-48+52-40)+( -16√3 -12√3)= (-36) -28√3≈-36 -48.49≈-84.49

At t=3: -3*81 -2√3*27 +13*9 -6√3*3 -40= -243 -54√3 +117 -18√3 -40≈-243 +117 -40 + (-54√3 -18√3)= (-166) -72√3≈-166 -124.7≈-290.7

At t=4: as before,≈-862

So, quartic is negative at t=0, t=1, t=2, t=3, t=4, t=5, etc.

But at t approaching -infty, quartic tends to -infty.

Wait, but earlier, at t=-2, quartic≈12.49>0. So, quartic crosses zero between t=-3 and t=-2.

Is that the only crossing?

Wait, let me compute quartic at t=-1.5:

-3*(5.0625) -2√3*(-3.375) +13*(2.25) -6√3*(-1.5) -40≈-15.1875 +6.0625√3 +29.25 +9√3 -40≈

Compute numerically:

-15.1875 +6.0625*1.732≈6.0625*1.732≈10.505 +29.25 +9*1.732≈15.588 -40

Compute:

-15.1875 +10.505≈-4.6825 +29.25≈24.5675 +15.588≈40.1555 -40≈0.1555≈0.1555>0

So, at t=-1.5, quartic≈0.1555>0

Wait, so quartic is positive at t=-1.5, and at t=-2, quartic≈12.49>0, but at t=-3, quartic≈-41.3<0.

So, quartic crosses zero between t=-3 and t=-2, and also between t=-2 and t=-1.5? Wait, no, at t=-2, it's≈12.49, t=-1.5≈0.1555, t=-1≈-16.15.

So, it's positive at t=-2, positive at t=-1.5, negative at t=-1, so crosses zero between t=-1.5 and t=-1.

Thus, quartic has two real roots: one between t=-3 and t=-2, another between t=-1.5 and t=-1.

But in our case, the fixed point in the fourth quadrant would correspond to t <0, so we have two possible t's: one between t=-3 and t=-2, another between t=-1.5 and t=-1.

But since the point is in the fourth quadrant, x =t <0, y =t² -4.

We need to determine which one is the correct one.

Since the original parabola is y=x² -4, which is a U-shaped parabola opening upwards, with vertex at (0, -4). The rotated parabola is another U-shaped opening, but direction depends on rotation.

But in any case, the fixed point is in the fourth quadrant, so x <0, y <0.

So, for each real root t <0, we can compute y =t² -4.

We need to see which one lies in the fourth quadrant. Since both roots t=-2.5 and t=-1.5 lie in the fourth quadrant (because y =t² -4, which for t=-2.5 is y≈6.25 -4=2.25>0, which is in the second quadrant. For t=-1.5, y≈2.25 -4≈-1.75<0, which is in the fourth quadrant.

Wait, hold on:

Wait, for t ≈-2.5, y = t² -4 ≈6.25 -4=2.25, which is positive, so point (-2.5, 2.25), which is in the second quadrant.

For t≈-1.5, y≈2.25 -4≈-1.75, so point (-1.5, -1.75), which is in the fourth quadrant.

So, only the root in t≈-1.5 corresponds to the fixed point in the fourth quadrant.

So, the quartic has two real roots: one in second quadrant (t≈-2.5), one in fourth quadrant (t≈-1.5). So, the one we need is the one in fourth quadrant, t≈-1.5.

Wait, but is that t=-1.5? Wait, we computed at t=-1.5, quartic≈0.1555>0, but at t=-1, quartic≈-16.15<0.

So, the root is between t=-1.5 and t=-1.

Thus, we need to approximate the root.

Let me compute quartic at t=-1.2:

-3*(-1.2)^4 -2√3*(-1.2)^3 +13*(-1.2)^2 -6√3*(-1.2) -40

Compute step by step:

1. (-1.2)^4 = (1.44)^2=2.0736; so -3*2.0736≈-6.2208

2. (-1.2)^3= -1.728; so -2√3*(-1.728)=3.456√3≈3.456*1.732≈5.967

3. (-1.2)^2=1.44; 13*1.44=18.72

4. -6√3*(-1.2)=7.2√3≈7.2*1.732≈12.47

5. -40

So, adding all together:

-6.2208 +5.967 +18.72 +12.47 -40≈

Compute step by step:

-6.2208 +5.967≈-0.2538

-0.2538 +18.72≈18.4662

18.4662 +12.47≈30.9362

30.9362 -40≈-9.0638

So, quartic≈-9.0638 <0 at t=-1.2

So, the root is between t=-1.5 and t=-1.2, since at t=-1.5, quartic≈0.1555>0, at t=-1.2≈-9.06<0.

Let me try t=-1.4:

-3*(-1.4)^4 -2√3*(-1.4)^3 +13*(-1.4)^2 -6√3*(-1.4) -40

1. (-1.4)^4= (1.96)^2≈3.8416; -3*3.8416≈-11.5248

2. (-1.4)^3≈-2.744; -2√3*(-2.744)=5.488√3≈5.488*1.732≈9.56

3. (-1.4)^2=1.96; 13*1.96≈25.48

4. -6√3*(-1.4)=8.4√3≈8.4*1.732≈14.54

5. -40

Sum:

3.4955 +5.196≈8.6915

8.6915 -40≈-31.3085

So, quartic is negative at t=-0.5.

Wait, so quartic is negative at t=-0.5, t=-1.0, etc.

Wait, but earlier, at t=-1.5, quartic≈0.1555>0, and t=-1.25≈-7.258, so it must cross between t=-1.5 and t=-1.25.

Wait, but at t=-1.5:≈0.1555

t=-1.4:≈-1.9448

Wait, no, wait. Earlier, at t=-1.5:≈0.1555

t=-1.4:≈-1.9448

So, the root is between t=-1.5 and t=-1.4.

Wait, at t=-1.5:≈0.1555>0

t=-1.4:≈-1.9448<0

So, the root is between t=-1.5 and t=-1.4.

Similarly, let's approximate t≈-1.45:

Compute quartic at t=-1.45:

1. (-1.45)^4≈(2.1025)^2≈4.420; -3*4.420≈-13.26

2. (-1.45)^3≈-3.05; -2√3*(-3.05)=6.10√3≈6.10*1.732≈10.57

3. (-1.45)^2≈2.1025; 13*2.1025≈27.3325

4. -6√3*(-1.45)=8.7√3≈8.7*1.732≈15.05

5. -40

Sum:

-13.26 +10.57 +27.3325 +15.05 -40≈

Compute:

-13.26 +10.57≈-2.69

-2.69 +27.3325≈24.6425

24.6425 +15.05≈39.6925

39.6925 -40≈-0.3075

So, quartic≈-0.3075 at t=-1.45

So, between t=-1.5 and t=-1.45, quartic goes from≈0.1555 to≈-0.3075.

Thus, the root is approximately t≈-1.475

Using linear approximation:

Between t=-1.5 (0.1555) and t=-1.45 (-0.3075). The difference in t is 0.05, difference in quartic≈-0.463

We need to find t where quartic=0.

So, fraction needed: 0 -0.1555 / (-0.463 -0.1555)= -0.1555 / (-0.6185)=≈0.2527

Thus, t≈-1.5 +0.2527*0.05≈-1.5 +0.0126≈-1.4874

So, t≈-1.4874

Thus, x≈-1.4874

Then, y≈t² -4≈(1.4874)^2 -4≈2.2125 -4≈-1.7875

So, point is approximately (-1.4874, -1.7875)

But, we need an exact form.

Wait, but maybe this fixed point corresponds to something in terms of sqrt(3) and sqrt(7) or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartic can be solved with the substitution t = something.

Alternatively, perhaps since the polynomial is quartic with real coefficients, it's factorable into quadratics with real coefficients.

Wait, perhaps it's factorable into (at² + bt + c)(dt² + et + f)=0.

Assume:

(ax² + bx + c)(dx² + ex + f)=a d x⁴ + (a e + b d)x³ + (a f + b e + c d)x² + (b f + c e)x + c f= quartic.

Compare to quartic:

-3x⁴ -2√3x³ +13x² -6√3x -40

So, set:

a d = -3

a e + b d = -2√3

a f + b e + c d =13

b f + c e = -6√3

c f = -40

Assume a=1, d=-3.

Then,

a=1, d=-3

Then,

1*(-3) = -3 (good)

a e + b d = e + b*(-3) = e -3b = -2√3

a f + b e + c d =f + b e + c*(-3) = f + b e -3c =13

b f + c e = b f + c e = -6√3

c f = -40

So, we have:

1. e -3b = -2√3

2. f + b e -3c =13

3. b f + c e = -6√3

4. c f = -40

We need to solve for b, c, e, f.

From equation 4: c f = -40. Let's look for integer factors of -40.

Possible pairs (c,f): (1,-40),(2,-20),(4,-10),(5,-8),(8,-5),(10,-4),(20,-2),(40,-1), (-1,40), etc.

Let's try c=5 and f=-8: 5*(-8)=-40. Yes.

So, c=5, f=-8.

Then, from equation 3: b*(-8) +5 e =-6√3 => -8b +5e =-6√3

From equation 1: e = -2√3 +3b

Substitute into equation 3:

-8b +5*(-2√3 +3b)= -6√3

Simplify:

-8b -10√3 +15b = -6√3

(7b) -10√3 = -6√3

7b =4√3

Thus, b= (4√3)/7

Then, from equation 1: e= -2√3 +3*(4√3/7)= -2√3 +12√3/7= (-14√3 +12√3)/7= (-2√3)/7

Thus, e= -2√3 /7

Now, from equation 2: f + b e -3c = (-8) + (4√3 /7)*(-2√3 /7) -3*5= (-8) + ( (4√3)(-2√3) )/(49) -15

Compute:

(-8) + ( -8*3 ) /49 -15= (-8) -24/49 -15≈(-8 -15) -24/49≈-23 -24/49≈-23.489

But equation 2 is supposed to be equal to13, but it's -23.489≠13. So, this factorization doesn't work.

Let me try another pair: c=8, f=-5.

Then, equation 4: c f=8*(-5)=-40.

From equation 3: b*(-5) +8 e =-6√3 => -5b +8e =-6√3

From equation 1: e = -2√3 +3b

Substitute into equation 3:

-5b +8*(-2√3 +3b)= -5b -16√3 +24b=19b -16√3= -6√3

Thus,

19b=10√3

So, b= (10√3)/19

Then, e= -2√3 +3*(10√3/19)= -2√3 +30√3/19= (-38√3 +30√3)/19= (-8√3)/19

Thus, e= -8√3 /19

Now, equation 2: f + b e -3c= (-5) + (10√3 /19)*(-8√3 /19) -3*8= (-5) + ( -80*3 / 361 ) -24= (-5) -240/361 -24≈-5 -0.666 -24≈-29.666≠13

Not working.

Try c=10, f=-4.

Equation 4: c f=10*(-4)=-40.

Equation 3: b*(-4) +10 e =-6√3

Equation 1: e = -2√3 +3b

Substitute into equation 3:

-4b +10*(-2√3 +3b)= -4b -20√3 +30b=26b -20√3= -6√3

Thus,

26b=14√3 => b=14√3 /26=7√3 /13

Thus, e= -2√3 +3*(7√3 /13)= -2√3 +21√3 /13= (-26√3 +21√3)/13= (-5√3)/13

Thus, e= -5√3 /13

Now, equation 2: f + b e -3c= (-4) + (7√3 /13)*(-5√3 /13) -3*10= (-4) + ( -35*3 / 169 ) -30= (-4) -105/169 -30≈-34 -0.623≈-34.623≠13

Nope.

Another pair: c=20, f=-2.

Equation 4: c f=20*(-2)=-40.

Equation 3: b*(-2) +20 e =-6√3

Equation 1: e= -2√3 +3b

Substitute into equation 3:

-2b +20*(-2√3 +3b)= -2b -40√3 +60b=58b -40√3= -6√3

Thus,

58b=34√3 => b=34√3 /58=17√3/29

Then, e= -2√3 +3*(17√3 /29)= -2√3 +51√3 /29= (-58√3 +51√3)/29= (-7√3)/29

Thus, e= -7√3 /29

Equation 2: f + b e -3c= (-2) + (17√3 /29)*(-7√3 /29) -3*20= (-2) + ( -119*3 / 841 ) -60= (-2) -357/841 -60≈-62 -0.424≈-62.424≠13

Not working.

Alternatively, c= -5, f=8.

Equation 4: c f= -5*8=-40.

Equation 3: b*8 + (-5) e =-6√3 =>8b -5e= -6√3

Equation 1: e= -2√3 +3b

Substitute into equation 3:

8b -5*(-2√3 +3b)=8b +10√3 -15b= -7b +10√3= -6√3

Thus,

-7b= -16√3 => b=16√3 /7

Then, e= -2√3 +3*(16√3 /7)= -2√3 +48√3 /7= (-14√3 +48√3)/7=34√3 /7

Thus, e=34√3 /7

Equation 2: f + b e -3c=8 + (16√3 /7)*(34√3 /7) -3*(-5)=8 + (544*3)/49 +15=8 +1632/49 +15≈8 +33.306 +15≈56.306≠13

Nope.

Another pair: c= -8, f=5.

Equation 4: c f= -8*5=-40.

Equation 3: b*5 + (-8)e =-6√3

Equation 1: e= -2√3 +3b

Substitute into equation 3:

5b -8*(-2√3 +3b)=5b +16√3 -24b= -19b +16√3= -6√3

Thus,

-19b= -22√3 => b=22√3 /19

Then, e= -2√3 +3*(22√3 /19)= -2√3 +66√3 /19= (-38√3 +66√3)/19=28√3 /19

Then, equation 2: f + b e -3c=5 + (22√3 /19)*(28√3 /19) -3*(-8)=5 + (616*3)/361 +24=5 +1848/361 +24≈5 +5.12 +24≈34.12≠13

Not working.

Another pair: c= -10, f=4.

Equation 4: c f= -10*4=-40.

Equation 3: b*4 + (-10)e =-6√3

Equation 1: e= -2√3 +3b

Substitute into equation 3:

4b -10*(-2√3 +3b)=4b +20√3 -30b= -26b +20√3= -6√3

Thus,

-26b= -26√3 => b=√3

Then, e= -2√3 +3*√3=√3

Equation 2: f + b e -3c=4 +√3*√3 -3*(-10)=4 +3 +30=37≠13

Nope.

Another pair: c= -40, f=1.

Equation 4: c f= -40*1=-40.

Equation 3: b*1 + (-40)e =-6√3

Equation 1: e= -2√3 +3b

Substitute into equation 3:

b -40*(-2√3 +3b)=b +80√3 -120b= -119b +80√3= -6√3

Thus,

-119b= -86√3 => b=86√3 /119= simplify: 86 and 119 have GCD 29: 86=29*2, 119=29*4.1? Wait, 119=7*17. Hmm, no. 29*4=116, so 119-116=3, so no.

Thus, b=86√3 /119

Then, e= -2√3 +3*(86√3 /119)= -2√3 +258√3 /119= (-238√3 +258√3)/119=20√3 /119

Thus, equation 2: f + b e -3c=1 + (86√3 /119)*(20√3 /119) -3*(-40)=1 + (1720*3)/(14161) +120≈1 +0.373 +120≈121.373≠13

Nope.

This trial and error isn't working. Maybe the quartic is not factorable with integer coefficients, so perhaps I have to accept that it's not factorable with rational coefficients and proceed with numerical approximation.

So, the fixed point is approximately x≈-1.4874, y≈-1.7875.

But we need an exact form.

Wait, perhaps the fixed point can be represented as t= -√3.

Wait, let's test t=-√3≈-1.732.

Compute quartic at t=-√3:

(-√3)^4 -2√3*(-√3)^3 +13*(-√3)^2 -6√3*(-√3) -40

= 9 -2√3*(-3√3) +13*3 -6√3*(-√3) -40

=9 -2√3*(-3√3) +39 -6√3*(-√3) -40

Compute each term:

-2√3*(-3√3)=6*3=18

-6√3*(-√3)=6*3=18

Thus,

=9 +18 +39 +18 -40= (9 +18 +39 +18) -40=84 -40=44≠0

Not zero.

Alternatively, maybe t= -2√3≈-3.464. But that's outside the interval.

Wait, maybe t= -√(7). Wait, sqrt(7)=2.645, so t≈-2.645.

Compute quartic at t≈-2.645:

1. (-2.645)^4≈(7.0)^2≈49

2. -2√3*(-2.645)^3≈-2√3*(-18.56)≈34.28√3≈59.3

Total≈49 +59.3 +91 +27.7 -40≈49+59.3=108.3 +91=199.3 +27.7=227 -40≈187≠0

Not zero.

Wait, maybe t= - (sqrt(7)/2)≈-1.322.

Compute quartic at t≈-1.322:

1. (-1.322)^4≈(1.748)^2≈3.056

2. -2√3*(-1.322)^3≈-2√3*(-2.306)≈4.612√3≈7.91

3. 13*(-1.322)^2≈13*(1.748)≈22.724

Nope.

Alternatively, perhaps t= -2.

Compute quartic at t=-2:

1. 16

2. -2√3*(-8)=16√3≈27.7

3. 13*4=52

4. -6√3*(-2)=12√3≈20.78

Sum≈16 +27.7 +52 +20.78 -40≈(16+27.7)=43.7 +52=95.7 +20.78=116.48 -40≈76.48≠0

Nope.

Alternatively, t= -1.

Compute quartic at t=-1:

1. 1

2. -2√3*(-1)^3=2√3≈3.464

3. 13*1=13

4. -6√3*(-1)=6√3≈10.392

Nope.

Wait, perhaps t= - (sqrt(3)/2)≈-0.866.

Compute quartic at t≈-0.866:

1. (-0.866)^4≈(0.75)^2≈0.5625

2. -2√3*(-0.866)^3≈-2√3*(-0.6495)≈1.299√3≈2.25

3. 13*(0.75)=9.75

4. -6√3*(-0.866)=5.196√3≈9

5. -40

No.

I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I should accept that the quartic doesn't factor nicely and use approximate values.

But the problem says to express y in terms of sqrt(7), so maybe there's an exact solution.

Wait, maybe the quartic can be rewritten as:

-3t^4 -2√3 t^3 +13 t^2 -6√3 t -40=0

Let me factor out a negative sign:

3t^4 +2√3 t^3 -13 t^2 +6√3 t +40=0

Let me see if I can factor this quartic.

Assume it factors as (at² + bt +c)(dt² + et +f)=0

Assume a=1, d=3.

Thus,

( t² + bt +c )(3t² + et +f )=0

Multiply:

3t^4 + (e +3b)t³ + (f +be +3c)t² + (bf +ce)t +cf=0

Compare with 3t^4 +2√3 t^3 -13 t^2 +6√3 t +40=0

Thus:

1. e +3b=2√3

2. f +b e +3c= -13

3. b f +c e=6√3

4. c f=40

Looking for integer solutions.

Equation4: c f=40. So possible c and f pairs: (1,40),(2,20),(4,10),(5,8),(-1,-40), etc.

Try c=5, f=8.

Equation3: b*8 +5 e=6√3

Equation1: e +3b=2√3

So, from equation1: e=2√3 -3b

Substitute into equation3:

8b +5*(2√3 -3b)=6√3

8b +10√3 -15b=6√3

(-7b) +10√3=6√3

Thus,

-7b= -4√3 => b= (4√3)/7

Then, e=2√3 -3*(4√3 /7)=2√3 -12√3 /7= (14√3 -12√3)/7=2√3 /7

Thus, b=4√3 /7, e=2√3 /7

Check equation2: f +b e +3c=8 + (4√3 /7)(2√3 /7) +15=8 + (8*3)/49 +15=8 +24/49 +15≈8 +0.489 +15≈23.489≠-13

Nope.

Try c=8, f=5.

Equation3: b*5 +8 e=6√3

Equation1: e=2√3 -3b

Substitute:

5b +8*(2√3 -3b)=6√3

5b +16√3 -24b=6√3

(-19b) +16√3=6√3

Thus,

-19b= -10√3 => b=10√3 /19

Then, e=2√3 -3*(10√3 /19)=2√3 -30√3 /19= (38√3 -30√3)/19=8√3 /19

Equation2: f +b e +3c=5 + (10√3 /19)*(8√3 /19) +24=5 + (80*3)/361 +24≈5 + 6.666 +24≈35.666≠-13

Nope.

Try c=10, f=4.

Equation3: b*4 +10 e=6√3

Equation1: e=2√3 -3b

Substitute:

4b +10*(2√3 -3b)=6√3

4b +20√3 -30b=6√3

(-26b) +20√3=6√3

Thus,

-26b= -14√3 => b=14√3 /26=7√3 /13

Then, e=2√3 -3*(7√3 /13)=2√3 -21√3 /13= (26√3 -21√3)/13=5√3 /13

Equation2: f +b e +3c=4 + (7√3 /13)*(5√3 /13) +30=4 + (35*3)/169 +30≈4 +0.592 +30≈34.592≠-13

Nope.

Try c= -5, f= -8.

Equation3: b*(-8) + (-5)e=6√3

Equation1: e=2√3 -3b

Substitute:

-8b -5*(2√3 -3b)=6√3

-8b -10√3 +15b=6√3

7b -10√3=6√3

Thus,

7b=16√3 => b=16√3 /7

Then, e=2√3 -3*(16√3 /7)=2√3 -48√3 /7= (14√3 -48√3)/7= (-34√3)/7

Equation2: f +b e +3c= -8 + (16√3 /7)*(-34√3 /7) +3*(-5)= -8 + (-544*3)/49 -15≈-8 -33.71 -15≈-56.71≠-13

Nope.

Try c= -4, f= -10.

Equation3: b*(-10) + (-4)e=6√3

Equation1: e=2√3 -3b

Substitute:

-10b -4*(2√3 -3b)=6√3

-10b -8√3 +12b=6√3

2b -8√3=6√3

Thus,

2b=14√3 => b=7√3

Then, e=2√3 -3*7√3=2√3 -21√3= -19√3

Equation2: f +b e +3c= -10 +7√3*(-19√3) +12= -10 -399 +12= -397≠-13

Nope.

Try c= -2, f= -20.

Equation3: b*(-20) + (-2)e=6√3

Equation1: e=2√3 -3b

Substitute:

-20b -2*(2√3 -3b)=6√3

-20b -4√3 +6b=6√3

-14b -4√3=6√3

Thus,

-14b=10√3 => b= -10√3 /14= -5√3 /7

Then, e=2√3 -3*(-5√3 /7)=2√3 +15√3 /7= (14√3 +15√3)/7=29√3 /7

Equation2: f +b e +3c= -20 + (-5√3 /7)*(29√3 /7) +3*(-2)= -20 + (-435*3)/49 -6≈-20 -27.96 -6≈-53.96≠-13

Nope.

Try c= -1, f= -40.

Equation3: b*(-40) + (-1)e=6√3

Equation1: e=2√3 -3b

Substitute:

-40b - (2√3 -3b)=6√3

-40b -2√3 +3b=6√3

-37b -2√3=6√3

Thus,

-37b=8√3 => b= -8√3 /37

Then, e=2√3 -3*(-8√3 /37)=2√3 +24√3 /37= (74√3 +24√3)/37=98√3 /37

Equation2: f +b e +3c= -40 + (-8√3 /37)*(98√3 /37) +3*(-1)= -40 + (-784*3)/1369 -3≈-40 -1.666 -3≈-44.666≠-13

Nope.

This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe the quartic doesn't factor nicely, and I need to accept that the solution involves sqrt(7). Alternatively, maybe the fixed point is at y = sqrt(7), but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps since the fixed point is in the fourth quadrant, and the original parabola is symmetric about the x-axis, the fixed point might have coordinates related to sqrt(7). Maybe y= sqrt(7). Let me test t= sqrt(7).

Compute quartic at t=√7:

1. (√7)^4=49

2. -2√3*(√7)^3= -2√3*(7√7)= -14√21

3. 13*(√7)^2=13*7=91

4. -6√3*(√7)= -6√21

5. -40

Sum:49 -14√21 +91 -6√21 -40= (49 +91 -40) + (-14√21 -6√21)=90 -20√21≈90 -20*4.583≈90 -91.66≈-1.66≠0

Nope.

Alternatively, t= sqrt(7)/2.

Compute quartic at t=√7 /2:

1. t^4=(7/4)^2=49/16≈3.0625

2. -2√3 t^3= -2√3*(7√7)/8= - (14√49)/8= - (14*7)/8= -98/8= -12.25

3. 13 t^2=13*(7/4)=91/4≈22.75

4. -6√3 t= -6√3*(√7)/2= -3√{21}≈-14.216

5. -40≈-40

Sum≈3.0625 -12.25 +22.75 -14.216 -40≈(3.0625 -12.25)= -9.1875 +2
