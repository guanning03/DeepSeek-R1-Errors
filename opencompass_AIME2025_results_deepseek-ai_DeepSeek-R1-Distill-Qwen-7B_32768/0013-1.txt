Wrong Answer:
Alright, so I've got this problem here: The parabola with equation y = x² - 4 is rotated 60 degrees counterclockwise around the origin. I need to find the unique point in the fourth quadrant where the original parabola and its image intersect. Then, the y-coordinate of this intersection point is given in the form (a - sqrt(b))/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and a and c are relatively prime. Finally, I have to find a + b + c.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step. First, I know that rotating a graph involves transforming each point on the graph by the given angle. Since we're rotating around the origin, I can use rotation matrices to find the equation of the rotated parabola.

Let me recall the rotation matrix. For a counterclockwise rotation by an angle θ, the transformation is:

x' = x cos θ - y sin θ

y' = x sin θ + y cos θ

So, in this case, θ is 60 degrees. I should convert that to radians because the trigonometric functions in most calculations use radians, but since I can do it in degrees, let's stick with degrees for now.

What's cos 60° and sin 60°? I remember cos 60° is 0.5 and sin 60° is sqrt(3)/2. So, plugging these into the rotation matrix, we get:

x' = x*(0.5) - y*(sqrt(3)/2)

y' = x*(sqrt(3)/2) + y*(0.5)

So, the original parabola is y = x² - 4. I need to find the equation of the rotated parabola. To do that, I can express the original x and y in terms of x' and y', then substitute into the original equation.

Wait, actually, it might be better to express x and y in terms of x' and y', so that I can substitute into the original equation. Alternatively, express x and y as functions of x' and y' and then plug into y = x² - 4.

Let me try that. So, from the rotation equations:

x' = 0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)y => 0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)y = x'

y' = (sqrt(3)/2)x + 0.5y => (sqrt(3)/2)x + 0.5y = y'

So, I have two equations:

1) 0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)y = x'

2) (sqrt(3)/2)x + 0.5y = y'

I need to solve this system for x and y in terms of x' and y'. Then I can substitute into the original equation y = x² - 4.

Let me write these equations as:

Equation (1): 0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)y = x'

Equation (2): (sqrt(3)/2)x + 0.5y = y'

Let me rewrite these to make it clearer:

0.5x - (√3/2)y = x'

(√3/2)x + 0.5y = y'

Hmm, maybe I can write this in matrix form and solve for x and y. Let me represent this as a linear system:

[0.5   -√3/2] [x]   = [x']

[√3/2   0.5 ] [y]     [y']

So, the coefficient matrix is:

| 0.5   -√3/2 |

| √3/2    0.5  |

To solve for x and y, I need to find the inverse of this matrix. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is (1/(ad - bc)) * [d -b; -c a]

So, let's compute the determinant first:

Determinant = (0.5)(0.5) - (-√3/2)(√3/2) = 0.25 - (-3/4) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1.

Oh, nice, the determinant is 1, so the inverse is straightforward.

Inverse matrix = [ 0.5    √3/2 ]

                  [ -√3/2   0.5 ]

So, multiplying both sides by the inverse matrix:

[x]   = [0.5    √3/2][x']

[y]     [-√3/2   0.5][y']

Therefore,

x = 0.5x' + (√3/2)y'

y = (-√3/2)x' + 0.5y'

So, that gives me x and y in terms of x' and y'. Now, since the original equation is y = x² - 4, let's substitute x and y.

So, substituting into y = x² - 4:

(-√3/2 x' + 0.5 y') = (0.5x' + (√3/2)y')² - 4

Let me expand the right-hand side.

First, compute (0.5x' + (√3/2)y')²:

= (0.5x')² + 2*(0.5x')*(√3/2 y') + (√3/2 y')²

= 0.25x'² + (0.5 * √3)x'y' + (3/4)y'²

So, the right-hand side becomes:

0.25x'² + (0.5√3)x'y' + 0.75y'² - 4

Therefore, putting it all together:

Left-hand side: (-√3/2 x' + 0.5 y')

Right-hand side: 0.25x'² + 0.5√3 x'y' + 0.75y'² - 4

So, bring everything to one side:

0.25x'² + 0.5√3 x'y' + 0.75y'² - 4 + √3/2 x' - 0.5 y' = 0

Wait, actually, let's move the left-hand side to the right:

0.25x'² + 0.5√3 x'y' + 0.75y'² - 4 - (-√3/2 x' + 0.5 y') = 0

Simplify:

0.25x'² + 0.5√3 x'y' + 0.75y'² - 4 + (√3/2)x' - 0.5y' = 0

So, let me write this equation out:

0.25x'² + 0.5√3 x'y' + 0.75y'² + (√3/2)x' - 0.5y' - 4 = 0

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps we can multiply through by 4 to eliminate the decimals and fractions.

Multiplying each term by 4:

(0.25x'²)*4 = x'²

(0.5√3 x'y')*4 = 2√3 x'y'

(0.75y'²)*4 = 3y'²

(√3/2 x')*4 = 2√3 x'

(-0.5y')*4 = -2y'

(-4)*4 = -16

So, the equation becomes:

x'² + 2√3 x'y' + 3y'² + 2√3 x' - 2y' - 16 = 0

Okay, that seems a bit better. So, the equation of the rotated parabola is:

x'² + 2√3 x'y' + 3y'² + 2√3 x' - 2y' - 16 = 0

Hmmm. Now, I need to find the intersection points between the original parabola y = x² - 4 and its rotated image. So, both curves have points (x, y) where they intersect.

But wait, actually, the original parabola is y = x² - 4, and the rotated parabola is given by that equation above. So, to find their intersection points, I can set up the system:

y = x² - 4

and

x'² + 2√3 x'y' + 3y'² + 2√3 x' - 2y' - 16 = 0

But here, x and y are both expressed in terms of x' and y', but in reality, for the rotated parabola, (x', y') are the coordinates in the rotated system, which correspond to the original (x, y) after rotation. Wait, that might not be correct.

Wait, actually, when we rotate the parabola, the coordinates (x', y') are the rotated coordinates. So, to find the intersection points in the original coordinate system, do we have to consider both the original and rotated parabola in the same coordinate system?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think.

The original parabola is y = x² - 4, which is in the original coordinate system. When we rotate the entire parabola 60 degrees counterclockwise, we get a new parabola in the same coordinate system. So, to find their intersection points, we need to find points (x, y) that satisfy both y = x² - 4 and the equation of the rotated parabola.

But to get the equation of the rotated parabola, I think I have to express it in terms of x and y, not x' and y'. So, perhaps I messed up earlier.

Let me clarify: when we rotate the graph of y = x² - 4 by 60 degrees counterclockwise, the image of the parabola is another parabola. The equation of this image can be found by applying the rotation transformation to every point on the original parabola.

So, if (X, Y) is a point on the rotated parabola, then it corresponds to a point (x, y) on the original parabola such that:

X = x cos θ - y sin θ

Y = x sin θ + y cos θ

Where θ is 60 degrees.

But since (x, y) is on the original parabola, y = x² - 4. So, substituting y into the equations:

X = x cos θ - (x² - 4) sin θ

Y = x sin θ + (x² - 4) cos θ

Therefore, the parametric equations for the rotated parabola are:

X = x cos θ - (x² - 4) sin θ

Y = x sin θ + (x² - 4) cos θ

So, now, if I can express this in terms of X and Y, I can find the equation of the rotated parabola.

Alternatively, since I have X and Y in terms of x, I can try to eliminate x to get a relation between X and Y.

Given that θ is 60°, which is π/3 radians, we can substitute cos θ = 0.5 and sin θ = sqrt(3)/2.

So, plugging these in:

X = x*(0.5) - (x² - 4)*(sqrt(3)/2)

Y = x*(sqrt(3)/2) + (x² - 4)*(0.5)

Let me write these equations as:

Equation (3): X = 0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)(x² - 4)

Equation (4): Y = (sqrt(3)/2)x + 0.5(x² - 4)

So, equation (3): X = 0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)x² + 2sqrt(3)

Equation (4): Y = (sqrt(3)/2)x + 0.5x² - 2

So, now, we have two equations:

X = - (sqrt(3)/2)x² + 0.5x + 2sqrt(3)

Y = 0.5x² + (sqrt(3)/2)x - 2

So, we can write these as:

X = - (sqrt(3)/2)x² + 0.5x + 2sqrt(3)  ...(3)

Y = 0.5x² + (sqrt(3)/2)x - 2          ...(4)

Our goal is to express X and Y in terms of x, then eliminate x to get an equation in X and Y.

So, let me try to solve for x in terms of Y from equation (4), then substitute into equation (3) to get X in terms of Y, and then find the intersection points with Y = X² - 4.

Wait, but equation (4) is quadratic in x, so solving for x in terms of Y might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can express x in terms of Y from equation (4) and substitute into equation (3) to get X in terms of Y, but since equation (4) is quadratic, it might result in a quartic equation when combined with equation (3). Hmm, that seems messy.

Alternatively, since both equations (3) and (4) are quadratic in x, perhaps we can parameterize x and express X and Y in terms of x, then find the intersection points.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to notice that the intersection points lie on both the original parabola and the rotated parabola. So, in the rotated parabola, points are given by (X, Y) as defined above, but in the same coordinate system as the original parabola.

Wait, so we need to find points (x, y) such that:

1) y = x² - 4

2) There exists some x' such that X = x' cos θ - y sin θ and Y = x' sin θ + y cos θ, but in this case, since the point lies on both the original and the rotated parabola, the (x, y) must satisfy both equations.

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach. Since (x, y) is a point on the original parabola, and (X, Y) is the rotated version of (x, y). But the rotated parabola is the image of the original parabola, so for the intersection point, the rotated point (X, Y) must coincide with the original point (x, y). Therefore, (X, Y) = (x, y).

So, that gives us the system:

x = X = x cos θ - y sin θ

y = Y = x sin θ + y cos θ

But since (x, y) is on the original parabola, y = x² - 4.

So, substituting y = x² - 4 into the equations:

x = x cos θ - (x² - 4) sin θ

y = x sin θ + (x² - 4) cos θ

But since y = x² - 4, the second equation is just an identity. So, essentially, we just have the first equation:

x = x cos θ - (x² - 4) sin θ

So, that's an equation in x. Let's write that out.

x = x cos θ - (x² - 4) sin θ

Plug in cos θ = 0.5 and sin θ = sqrt(3)/2:

x = x*(0.5) - (x² - 4)*(sqrt(3)/2)

Let me rearrange this equation:

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:

2x = x - (x² - 4)sqrt(3)

Bring all terms to one side:

2x - x + (x² - 4)sqrt(3) = 0

Simplify:

x + (x² - 4)sqrt(3) = 0

Factor out sqrt(3):

sqrt(3)(x² - 4) + x = 0

So, sqrt(3)x² + x - 4sqrt(3) = 0

So, we have a quadratic equation in x:

sqrt(3)x² + x - 4sqrt(3) = 0

Let me write that as:

sqrt(3) x² + x - 4 sqrt(3) = 0

To solve for x, let's apply the quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a)

Where a = sqrt(3), b = 1, c = -4 sqrt(3)

Compute discriminant:

D = b² - 4ac = 1 - 4*(sqrt(3))*(-4 sqrt(3)) = 1 - 4*(sqrt(3))*(-4 sqrt(3))

Wait, let's compute it step by step:

First, 4ac = 4*sqrt(3)*(-4 sqrt(3)) = 4*(-4)*(sqrt(3))² = (-16)*3 = -48

So, D = b² - 4ac = 1 - (-48) = 1 + 48 = 49

So, discriminant is 49, which is a perfect square, so we have real solutions.

Therefore,

x = [ -1 ± sqrt(49) ] / (2*sqrt(3)) = [ -1 ± 7 ] / (2 sqrt(3))

So, two solutions:

x = ( -1 + 7 ) / (2 sqrt(3)) = 6 / (2 sqrt(3)) = 3 / sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)

And,

x = ( -1 - 7 ) / (2 sqrt(3)) = (-8) / (2 sqrt(3)) = -4 / sqrt(3) = (-4 sqrt(3))/3

So, we have two x-values: sqrt(3) and (-4 sqrt(3))/3.

Now, since we are looking for the intersection in the fourth quadrant, we need to figure out which of these x-values correspond to points in the fourth quadrant.

The fourth quadrant is where x is positive and y is negative.

So, let's compute y for each x.

First, for x = sqrt(3):

y = x² - 4 = (sqrt(3))² - 4 = 3 - 4 = -1

So, the point is (sqrt(3), -1). This is in the fourth quadrant because x is positive and y is negative.

Second, for x = (-4 sqrt(3))/3:

Compute y:

y = x² - 4 = [ (-4 sqrt(3)/3)^2 ] - 4 = (16*3)/9 - 4 = 48/9 - 4 = 16/3 - 12/3 = 4/3

So, the point is (-4 sqrt(3)/3, 4/3). This is in the second quadrant, since x is negative and y is positive.

Therefore, the intersection point in the fourth quadrant is (sqrt(3), -1). But wait, the problem says "the unique point in the fourth quadrant where the original parabola and its image intersect." So, is that correct?

Wait, hold on. Wait, when we solved the equation, we got two points: (sqrt(3), -1) and (-4 sqrt(3)/3, 4/3). But the problem mentions the unique point in the fourth quadrant. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here?

Wait, but perhaps when we rotated the parabola, the image might intersect the original parabola at two points, but only one of them is in the fourth quadrant. So, (sqrt(3), -1) is in the fourth quadrant, but (-4 sqrt(3)/3, 4/3) is in the second quadrant.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because the quadratic equation gave us two solutions, but the problem states that there's a unique intersection point in the fourth quadrant. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I should check whether both these points lie on both the original and the rotated parabola.

Wait, so (sqrt(3), -1): Let's plug into the rotated parabola equation.

Earlier, we had the equation of the rotated parabola as:

X = - (sqrt(3)/2)x² + 0.5x + 2sqrt(3)

Y = 0.5x² + (sqrt(3)/2)x - 2

So, plugging x = sqrt(3) into these equations:

Compute X:

X = - (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3))² + 0.5*sqrt(3) + 2sqrt(3)

= - (sqrt(3)/2)*3 + 0.5 sqrt(3) + 2 sqrt(3)

= - (3 sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) + 2 sqrt(3)

= (-3 sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2) + 2 sqrt(3)

= (-2 sqrt(3)/2) + 2 sqrt(3)

= (-sqrt(3)) + 2 sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)

Compute Y:

Y = 0.5*(sqrt(3))² + (sqrt(3)/2)*sqrt(3) - 2

= 0.5*3 + (3/2) - 2

= 1.5 + 1.5 - 2 = 1

Wait, so when x = sqrt(3), the rotated coordinates are (sqrt(3), 1). But the original point is (sqrt(3), -1). So, unless (sqrt(3), 1) is the same as (sqrt(3), -1), which it isn't, that point isn't on both parabolas.

Wait a second, so does that mean that (sqrt(3), -1) is on the original parabola but not on the rotated parabola? But that can't be, because we derived it by setting x = X, y = Y, meaning that (x, y) is on both parabolas.

Wait, maybe I messed up the equations.

Wait, earlier, I thought that (x, y) is on both the original and the rotated parabola, leading to the equation in x only. But when I plug x = sqrt(3) into the rotated parabola, I get (sqrt(3), 1), which doesn't match (sqrt(3), -1). So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the point (sqrt(3), -1) is only on the original parabola, and not on the rotated one.

Wait, that can't be. The intersection points should lie on both parabolas, so I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let's go back.

I said that if (x, y) is on both parabolas, then (x, y) must satisfy both y = x² - 4 and the rotated equations.

But when I tried to set (x, y) = (X, Y), meaning that the rotated point coincides with the original point, that led to a quadratic equation with two solutions, one in the fourth quadrant, one in the second.

But when I plugged in x = sqrt(3) into the rotated parabola equations, I didn't get (sqrt(3), -1), but rather (sqrt(3), 1). So, that suggests that (sqrt(3), -1) is not on the rotated parabola.

Wait, that can't be, because we derived it by setting (x, y) = (X, Y), which should mean that it lies on both.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.

Wait, let me think again. If we have a point (x, y) on the original parabola, then its image after rotation is (X, Y) = (x cos θ - y sin θ, x sin θ + y cos θ). So, (X, Y) is the rotated point, which lies on the rotated parabola.

But (x, y) is on the original parabola. So, for their intersection, we need a point (x, y) such that (x, y) is on the original parabola, and (x, y) is also on the rotated parabola. So, (x, y) must satisfy both y = x² - 4 and the equation of the rotated parabola.

So, the equation of the rotated parabola is in terms of (X, Y), so to check whether (x, y) is on both, we need to see if (x, y) satisfies the rotated parabola equation.

So, let's plug (x, y) into the rotated parabola equation.

Earlier, we had the rotated parabola equation as:

X = - (sqrt(3)/2)x² + 0.5x + 2sqrt(3)

Y = 0.5x² + (sqrt(3)/2)x - 2

So, if (x, y) is on both parabolas, then substituting (X, Y) = (x, y) should satisfy the equations.

So, we have:

x = - (sqrt(3)/2)x² + 0.5x + 2sqrt(3)  ...(A)

y = 0.5x² + (sqrt(3)/2)x - 2  ...(B)

But since y = x² - 4, equation (B) becomes:

x² - 4 = 0.5x² + (sqrt(3)/2)x - 2

Simplify equation (B):

x² - 4 = 0.5x² + (sqrt(3)/2)x - 2

Bring all terms to one side:

x² - 4 - 0.5x² - (sqrt(3)/2)x + 2 = 0

Simplify:

0.5x² - (sqrt(3)/2)x - 2 = 0

Multiply through by 2 to eliminate fractions:

x² - sqrt(3)x - 4 = 0

So, equation (B) simplifies to x² - sqrt(3)x - 4 = 0

Similarly, equation (A) is:

x = - (sqrt(3)/2)x² + 0.5x + 2sqrt(3)

Bring all terms to one side:

x + (sqrt(3)/2)x² - 0.5x - 2sqrt(3) = 0

Simplify:

(sqrt(3)/2)x² + 0.5x - 2sqrt(3) = 0

Multiply through by 2:

sqrt(3)x² + x - 4sqrt(3) = 0

Which is the same quadratic equation as before: sqrt(3)x² + x - 4sqrt(3) = 0

So, both equations lead to the same quadratic, which is consistent.

So, solving sqrt(3)x² + x - 4sqrt(3) = 0, as before, gives x = sqrt(3) and x = -4sqrt(3)/3

But when we plug x = sqrt(3) into equation (B), which is x² - sqrt(3)x - 4 = 0, we get:

(3) - sqrt(3)*sqrt(3) - 4 = 3 - 3 - 4 = -4 ≠ 0

Wait, that's not zero. Hmm, that suggests that my previous conclusion that x = sqrt(3) satisfies equation (B) is wrong.

Wait, that's contradictory because we had equation (B) leading to sqrt(3)x² + x - 4sqrt(3) = 0, which we solved to get x = sqrt(3) and x = -4sqrt(3)/3.

But when I plug x = sqrt(3) into equation (B), which was x² - sqrt(3)x - 4 = 0, I don't get zero.

Wait, let me check my substitution.

Equation (B): y = 0.5x² + (sqrt(3)/2)x - 2

But since y = x² - 4, then:

x² - 4 = 0.5x² + (sqrt(3)/2)x - 2

Subtract 0.5x² and add 2:

0.5x² - (sqrt(3)/2)x - 2 = 0

Multiply by 2:

x² - sqrt(3)x - 4 = 0

So, that is correct.

Thus, x = sqrt(3) is a solution to x² - sqrt(3)x - 4 = 0?

Wait, let me compute:

x² - sqrt(3)x - 4 at x = sqrt(3):

(3) - sqrt(3)*sqrt(3) - 4 = 3 - 3 - 4 = -4 ≠ 0

So, x = sqrt(3) is not a solution to this equation, which seems contradictory because when I solved sqrt(3)x² + x - 4sqrt(3) = 0, I got x = sqrt(3) as a solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check.

Wait, equation (A): x = - (sqrt(3)/2)x² + 0.5x + 2sqrt(3)

Equation (B): y = 0.5x² + (sqrt(3)/2)x - 2

But since y = x² - 4, equation (B) becomes x² - 4 = 0.5x² + (sqrt(3)/2)x - 2

So, that's correct.

So, equation (B) gives x² - sqrt(3)x - 4 = 0

Equation (A) gives sqrt(3)x² + x - 4sqrt(3) = 0

But these are two different quadratics, but they should be consistent because they both come from the same system.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying equation (A).

Let me check equation (A):

x = - (sqrt(3)/2)x² + 0.5x + 2sqrt(3)

Bring all terms to the left:

x + (sqrt(3)/2)x² - 0.5x - 2sqrt(3) = 0

Simplify:

(sqrt(3)/2)x² + 0.5x - 2sqrt(3) = 0

Multiply by 2:

sqrt(3)x² + x - 4sqrt(3) = 0

Which is the same as earlier.

But equation (B) gives x² - sqrt(3)x - 4 = 0

So, these are two different equations. So, how come both x = sqrt(3) and x = -4sqrt(3)/3 satisfy equation (A) but not equation (B)?

Wait, this suggests that perhaps the substitution is incorrect or that my initial approach has a mistake.

Wait, I think the confusion arises because equation (A) and equation (B) are both derived from the fact that (x, y) is on both the original and rotated parabola.

But if we set (x, y) = (X, Y), we get equation (A) and equation (B). However, equation (B) is derived from the substitution of y into equation (A).

But in reality, if (x, y) is on both, then equations (A) and (B) must both be satisfied, so the solutions must satisfy both equations.

But since equation (A) and equation (B) are different, we have to solve them together.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to solve the system:

sqrt(3)x² + x - 4sqrt(3) = 0

and

x² - sqrt(3)x - 4 = 0

So, let me write both equations:

1) sqrt(3)x² + x - 4sqrt(3) = 0

2) x² - sqrt(3)x - 4 = 0

Let me try to solve this system.

From equation (2): x² = sqrt(3)x + 4

Plug this into equation (1):

sqrt(3)(sqrt(3)x + 4) + x - 4sqrt(3) = 0

Simplify:

sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)*4 + x - 4sqrt(3) = 0

Which is:

3x + 4sqrt(3) + x - 4sqrt(3) = 0

Simplify:

(3x + x) + (4sqrt(3) - 4sqrt(3)) = 0

Which is:

4x + 0 = 0 => x = 0

But x = 0 is not a solution to equation (2): 0 - 0 - 4 = -4 ≠ 0

So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution? But that can't be, since we know that the rotated parabola should intersect the original one.

Wait, maybe the mistake is in assuming that (x, y) must satisfy both equations (A) and (B). But in reality, (x, y) is on the original parabola, and (X, Y) is on the rotated parabola, but (x, y) is not necessarily equal to (X, Y). So, my mistake was to set (x, y) = (X, Y). Instead, (X, Y) is the rotated version of (x, y), so (X, Y) is on the rotated parabola, and (x, y) is on the original. So, the intersection points are points where (x, y) is on both the original and the rotated parabola. Therefore, we need to find (x, y) such that:

1) y = x² - 4

2) There exists some (X, Y) such that (X, Y) is the rotated version of (x, y), and (X, Y) is also on the original parabola.

Therefore, the point (X, Y) must satisfy both y = x² - 4 and the rotated parabola equation.

But (X, Y) is the rotated version of (x, y), so:

X = x cos θ - y sin θ

Y = x sin θ + y cos θ

Therefore, since (X, Y) is on the original parabola, Y = X² - 4.

So, the system is:

1) y = x² - 4

2) X = x cos θ - y sin θ

3) Y = x sin θ + y cos θ

4) Y = X² - 4

So, four equations with four variables: X, Y, x, y.

But since y = x² - 4, we can substitute that into equations 2 and 3.

So, equations 2 and 3 become:

X = x cos θ - (x² - 4) sin θ

Y = x sin θ + (x² - 4) cos θ

And equation 4: Y = X² - 4

So, substituting equations 2 and 3 into equation 4:

x sin θ + (x² - 4) cos θ = [x cos θ - (x² - 4) sin θ]^2 - 4

That's the equation we need to solve for x.

Let me write that out:

x sin θ + (x² - 4) cos θ = [x cos θ - (x² - 4) sin θ]^2 - 4

Substituting θ = 60°, so sin θ = sqrt(3)/2, cos θ = 0.5.

Plugging these in:

Left-hand side (LHS):

x*(sqrt(3)/2) + (x² - 4)*(0.5)

Right-hand side (RHS):

[ x*(0.5) - (x² - 4)*(sqrt(3)/2) ]^2 - 4

So, simplifying LHS:

LHS = (sqrt(3)/2)x + 0.5x² - 2

RHS:

First, compute the expression inside the square:

[0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)(x² - 4)] = 0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)x² + 2sqrt(3)

So, square that:

[0.5x - (sqrt(3)/2)x² + 2sqrt(3)]²

Let me denote this as (A + B + C)² where A = 0.5x, B = - (sqrt(3)/2)x², C = 2sqrt(3)

So, expanding (A + B + C)²:

A² + B² + C² + 2AB + 2AC + 2BC

Compute each term:

A² = (0.5x)² = 0.25x²

B² = [ - (sqrt(3)/2)x² ]² = (3/4)x⁴

C² = (2sqrt(3))² = 12

2AB = 2*(0.5x)*(-sqrt(3)/2 x²) = 2*(-sqrt(3)/4)x³ = - (sqrt(3)/2)x³

2AC = 2*(0.5x)*(2sqrt(3)) = 2*(sqrt(3)/1)x = 2sqrt(3)x

2BC = 2*(-sqrt(3)/2 x²)*(2sqrt(3)) = 2*(-3 x²) = -6x²

So, putting it all together:

(A + B + C)² = 0.25x² + (3/4)x⁴ + 12 - (sqrt(3)/2)x³ + 2sqrt(3)x - 6x²

Simplify:

Combine like terms:

0.25x² - 6x² = -5.75x² = -23/4 x²

So, (A + B + C)² = (3/4)x⁴ - (sqrt(3)/2)x³ - (23/4)x² + 2sqrt(3)x + 12

Therefore, RHS = (3/4)x⁴ - (sqrt(3)/2)x³ - (23/4)x² + 2sqrt(3)x + 12 - 4 = (3/4)x⁴ - (sqrt(3)/2)x³ - (23/4)x² + 2sqrt(3)x + 8

So, now, set LHS = RHS:

(sqrt(3)/2)x + 0.5x² - 2 = (3/4)x⁴ - (sqrt(3)/2)x³ - (23/4)x² + 2sqrt(3)x + 8

Bring all terms to the left:

0 = (3/4)x⁴ - (sqrt(3)/2)x³ - (23/4)x² + 2sqrt(3)x + 8 - (sqrt(3)/2)x - 0.5x² + 2

Simplify term by term:

- (3/4)x⁴: remains as is.

- (sqrt(3)/2)x³: remains as is.

- (23/4)x²: remains as is.

+2sqrt(3)x - (sqrt(3)/2)x = (2sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)/2)x = (4sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2)x = (3sqrt(3)/2)x

+0.5x²: remains as is.

+8 + 2 = +10

So, combining all:

(3/4)x⁴ - (sqrt(3)/2)x³ - (23/4 + 0.5)x² + (3sqrt(3)/2)x + 10 = 0

Simplify the x² term:

23/4 + 0.5 = 23/4 + 2/4 = 25/4

So,

(3/4)x⁴ - (sqrt(3)/2)x³ - (25/4)x² + (3sqrt(3)/2)x + 10 = 0

Multiply through by 4 to eliminate denominators:

3x⁴ - 2sqrt(3)x³ - 25x² + 6sqrt(3)x + 40 = 0

So, the quartic equation is:

3x⁴ - 2sqrt(3)x³ - 25x² + 6sqrt(3)x + 40 = 0

This looks complicated, but perhaps it factors nicely. Let me try to factor this quartic.

Let me attempt to factor it into quadratics.

Suppose it factors as (ax² + bx + c)(dx² + ex + f) = 0

Multiply out:

adx⁴ + (ae + bd)x³ + (af + be + cd)x² + (bf + ce)x + cf = 0

Compare to our equation:

3x⁴ - 2sqrt(3)x³ - 25x² + 6sqrt(3)x + 40 = 0

So, ad = 3, which suggests a = 3, d = 1 or a = 1, d = 3.

Similarly, cf = 40. 40 factors as 1&40, 2&20, 4&10, 5&8.

Let me try a = 3, d = 1.

So, (3x² + bx + c)(x² + ex + f) = 0

Multiply out:

3x⁴ + (3e + b)x³ + (3f + be + c)x² + (bf + ce)x + cf = 0

Set equal to original equation:

3x⁴ - 2sqrt(3)x³ - 25x² + 6sqrt(3)x + 40 = 0

Therefore, coefficients must satisfy:

1) 3e + b = -2sqrt(3)

2) 3f + be + c = -25

3) bf + ce = 6sqrt(3)

4) cf = 40

Hmm, okay, so let's try to find integers b, c, e, f such that these hold.

Given that cf = 40, which is a positive number, so c and f are both positive or both negative.

Looking at equation 3: bf + ce = 6sqrt(3). Since sqrt(3) is irrational, and b, c, e, f are integers, this suggests that either b or c must be a multiple of sqrt(3), but since b, c, e, f are integers, this seems impossible. Wait, that might be a problem.

Wait, hold on, our quartic equation has coefficients with sqrt(3). So, perhaps the quartic factors into quadratics with sqrt(3) terms.

Alternatively, maybe the quartic factors into (sqrt(3)x² + ...)(something). Hmm, but that might complicate.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor out sqrt(3) from some terms.

Alternatively, maybe try rational roots. Let me see.

According to the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are factors of 40 divided by factors of 3. So possible roots: ±1, ±2, ±4, ±5, ±8, ±10, ±20, ±40, ±1/3, etc.

But since we have sqrt(3) in coefficients, perhaps the actual roots are irrational.

Alternatively, maybe we can use substitution to make it a quadratic in terms of x².

But given the x³ and x terms, it's a quartic and not directly a biquadratic.

Alternatively, let me try to substitute y = x sqrt(3). Let me see.

Wait, perhaps a substitution such as t = x sqrt(3). Let me try.

Let me set t = x sqrt(3), so x = t / sqrt(3). Let's substitute into the quartic.

Wait, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution z = x + k, where k is some constant. But without knowing k, this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps since we know that the original quadratic in x had roots sqrt(3) and (-4 sqrt(3))/3, and when we tried to plug in x = sqrt(3), the rotated point didn't lie on the original parabola. Maybe the quartic equation can be factored using those roots.

So, if x = sqrt(3) and x = -4 sqrt(3)/3 are roots of the quadratic equation, but since the quartic is of higher degree, perhaps these roots are also roots of the quartic.

Let me test x = sqrt(3) in the quartic equation:

3x⁴ - 2sqrt(3)x³ -25x² + 6sqrt(3)x +40

Compute each term:

3*(sqrt(3))^4 = 3*(9) = 27

-2sqrt(3)*(sqrt(3))^3 = -2sqrt(3)*(3sqrt(3)) = -2sqrt(3)*3sqrt(3) = -2*3*3 = -18

-25*(sqrt(3))^2 = -25*3 = -75

6sqrt(3)*sqrt(3) = 6*3 = 18

+40

Add them together:

27 - 18 -75 + 18 + 40 = (27 - 18) + (-75 + 18) + 40 = 9 - 57 + 40 = (9 + 40) - 57 = 49 - 57 = -8 ≠ 0

So, x = sqrt(3) is not a root of the quartic. Hmm.

Similarly, test x = -4 sqrt(3)/3:

Compute each term:

3x⁴: 3*(-4 sqrt(3)/3)^4

First, compute (-4 sqrt(3)/3)^4:

= ( ( -4 sqrt(3) )^4 ) / (3^4 ) = ( (256 * 9 ) ) / 81 = (2304)/81 = 2304 ÷ 81 = 28.444... Wait, but let's compute step by step.

(-4 sqrt(3)/3)^4 = [ (-4)^4 * (sqrt(3))^4 ] / 3^4 = (256 * 9) / 81 = 2304 /81 = 28.444...

So, 3x⁴ = 3*(28.444...) ≈ 85.333...

-2sqrt(3)x³: -2sqrt(3)*(-4 sqrt(3)/3)^3

Compute (-4 sqrt(3)/3)^3:

= [ (-4)^3 * (sqrt(3))^3 ] / 3^3 = (-64 * 3 sqrt(3)) / 27 = (-192 sqrt(3))/27 = (-64 sqrt(3))/9

Thus, -2sqrt(3)*(-64 sqrt(3)/9) = -2sqrt(3)*(-64 sqrt(3)/9) = (128 * 3)/9 = 128/3 ≈ 42.666...

-25x²: -25*(-4 sqrt(3)/3)^2 = -25*(16*3)/9 = -25*(48)/9 = -25*(16/3) ≈ -133.333...

6sqrt(3)x: 6sqrt(3)*(-4 sqrt(3)/3) = 6*(-4)*3 /3 = -24

+40

So, adding all together:

≈85.333 + 42.666 - 133.333 -24 +40 ≈ (85.333 + 42.666) + (-133.333 -24) +40 ≈ 128 - 157.333 +40 ≈ (128 +40) -157.333 ≈ 168 -157.333 ≈ 10.666... ≈ 32/3 ≈ 10.666...

Which is not zero. So, x = -4 sqrt(3)/3 is not a root either.

So, that approach didn't help.

Alternatively, maybe the quartic can be factored into two quadratics with sqrt(3) terms.

Let me try:

Let me suppose that the quartic factors into (sqrt(3)x² + a x + b)(sqrt(3)x² + c x + d) = 0

Multiply out:

3x⁴ + (a + c sqrt(3))x³ + (b sqrt(3) + d sqrt(3) + ac)x² + (ad + bc)x + b d = 0

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe:

Let me consider that the quartic is a quadratic in x². Let me see:

3x⁴ - 2sqrt(3)x³ -25x² + 6sqrt(3)x +40 =0

Not exactly, because of the odd-powered x terms. So, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe substitute t = x + k/x, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, given that it's a quartic, perhaps use substitution y = x + m/x or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps use the substitution t = x sqrt(3). Let me try that.

Let t = x sqrt(3) => x = t / sqrt(3)

Substitute into quartic:

3*(t / sqrt(3))^4 - 2sqrt(3)*(t / sqrt(3))^3 -25*(t / sqrt(3))^2 +6sqrt(3)*(t / sqrt(3)) +40 = 0

Compute each term:

3*(t^4)/(3^2) = 3*(t^4)/9 = t^4 / 3

-2sqrt(3)*(t^3)/(3 sqrt(3)) = -2sqrt(3)*(t^3)/(3 sqrt(3)) = -2t^3 /3

-25*(t^2)/3 = -25t² /3

6sqrt(3)*(t)/sqrt(3) = 6t

+40

So, equation becomes:

t^4 /3 - (2/3)t³ - (25/3)t² +6t +40 =0

Multiply through by 3 to eliminate denominators:

t^4 - 2t³ -25t² +18t +120 =0

Hmm, now that's a quartic in t: t⁴ -2t³ -25t² +18t +120=0

This seems more manageable. Let me try to factor this.

Let me attempt rational roots. Possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±5, ±6, ±8, ±10, ±12, ±15, ±20, ±24, ±30, ±40, ±60, ±120.

Test t=1: 1 -2 -25 +18 +120= 1-2= -1; -1-25= -26; -26+18= -8; -8+120= 112≠0

t=2: 16 -16 -100 +36 +120= 16-16=0; 0-100=-100; -100+36=-64; -64+120=56≠0

t=3: 81 -54 -225 +54 +120= 81-54=27; 27-225=-198; -198+54=-144; -144+120=-24≠0

t=4: 256 -128 -400 +72 +120= 256-128=128; 128-400=-272; -272+72=-200; -200+120=-80≠0

t=5: 625 -250 -625 +90 +120= 625-250=375; 375-625=-250; -250+90=-160; -160+120=-40≠0

t=6: 1296 - 432 - 900 +108 +120= 1296-432=864; 864-900=-36; -36+108=72; 72+120=192≠0

t= -1: 1 +2 -25 -18 +120=1+2=3; 3-25=-22; -22-18=-40; -40+120=80≠0

t= -2: 16 +16 -100 -36 +120=16+16=32; 32-100=-68; -68-36=-104; -104+120=16≠0

t= -3: 81 +54 -225 -54 +120=81+54=135; 135-225=-90; -90-54=-144; -144+120=-24≠0

t= -4: 256 +128 -400 -72 +120=256+128=384; 384-400=-16; -16-72=-88; -88+120=32≠0

t= -5: 625 +250 -625 -90 +120=625+250=875; 875-625=250; 250-90=160; 160+120=280≠0

t= -6: 1296 + 432 -900 -108 +120=1296+432=1728; 1728-900=828; 828-108=720; 720+120=840≠0

Hmm, none of these are roots. Maybe I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, perhaps t= something else. Let me try t= sqrt(3). Wait, t is x sqrt(3), so unless x is sqrt(3), which is not necessarily.

Alternatively, maybe t= something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the quartic can be factored into (t² + a t + b)(t² + c t + d).

So, suppose:

(t² + a t + b)(t² + c t + d) = t⁴ + (a + c)t³ + (ac + b + d)t² + (ad + bc)t + b d = t⁴ -2t³ -25t² +18t +120

Therefore, equate coefficients:

1) a + c = -2

2) a c + b + d = -25

3) a d + b c = 18

4) b d = 120

So, we have four equations:

1) a + c = -2

2) a c + b + d = -25

3) a d + b c = 18

4) b d = 120

We need to find integers a, b, c, d satisfying these.

From equation 4: b d = 120. So, possible pairs (b, d): (1,120),(2,60),(3,40),(4,30),(5,24),(6,20),(8,15),(10,12), and their negatives.

Let me try positive factors first.

Let me assume b and d positive. Let's try b=5, d=24.

Then, equation 4: 5*24=120.

Now, equation 1: a + c = -2

Equation 2: a c +5 +24 = a c +29 = -25 => a c = -54

Equation 3: a*24 +5*c =18

So, from equation 1: c = -2 - a

From equation 2: a c = -54

Substitute c = -2 -a into equation2:

a*(-2 - a) = -54 => -2a -a² = -54 => a² +2a -54 =0

Solutions: a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +216)] /2 = [-2 ± sqrt(220)] /2, which is not integer. So, discard.

Next, try b=6, d=20.

Equation4: 6*20=120.

Equation2: a c +6 +20 = a c +26 = -25 => a c = -51

Equation3: a*20 +6*c =18

From equation1: c = -2 -a

Substitute into equation2:

a*(-2 -a) = -51 => -2a -a² = -51 => a² +2a -51 =0

Solutions: a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +204)] /2 = [-2 ± sqrt(208)] /2, not integer.

Next, b=8, d=15

Equation4: 8*15=120

Equation2: a c +8 +15 = a c +23 = -25 => a c = -48

Equation3: a*15 +8*c =18

From equation1: c = -2 -a

Substitute into equation3:

15a +8*(-2 -a) =18 =>15a -16 -8a =18 =>7a -16=18 =>7a=34 =>a=34/7, not integer.

Next, b=10, d=12

Equation2: a c +10 +12 = a c +22 = -25 => a c= -47

Equation3: a*12 +10*c =18

From equation1: c = -2 -a

Substitute into equation3:

12a +10*(-2 -a)=18 =>12a -20 -10a =18 =>2a -20=18 =>2a=38 =>a=19

Then, c = -2 -19= -21

Check equation2: a c =19*(-21)= -399 ≠ -47. Doesn't work.

Next, b=4, d=30

Equation2: a c +4 +30 = a c +34= -25 => a c= -59

Equation3: a*30 +4*c=18

From equation1: c= -2 -a

Substitute:

30a +4*(-2 -a)=18 =>30a -8 -4a=18 =>26a -8=18 =>26a=26 =>a=1

Thus, a=1, c= -3

Check equation2: a c=1*(-3)= -3≠-59. Doesn't work.

Next, b=3, d=40

Equation2: a c +3 +40= a c +43= -25 =>a c= -68

Equation3: a*40 +3*c=18

From equation1: c= -2 -a

Substitute:

40a +3*(-2 -a)=18 =>40a -6 -3a=18 =>37a -6=18 =>37a=24 =>a=24/37, not integer.

Try negative factors for b and d.

Let me try b= -5, d= -24.

Equation4: (-5)*(-24)=120

Equation2: a c + (-5) + (-24)= a c -29= -25 => a c=4

Equation3: a*(-24) + (-5)*c=18

From equation1: c= -2 -a

Substitute into equation3:

-24a -5*(-2 -a)=18 =>-24a +10 +5a=18 =>-19a +10=18 =>-19a=8 =>a= -8/19, not integer.

Next, b=-6, d=-20

Equation4: (-6)*(-20)=120

Equation2: a c + (-6) + (-20)= a c -26= -25 => a c=1

Equation3: a*(-20) + (-6)*c=18

From equation1: c= -2 -a

Substitute into equation3:

-20a -6*(-2 -a)=18 =>-20a +12 +6a=18 =>-14a +12=18 =>-14a=6 =>a= -6/14= -3/7, not integer.

b=-8, d=-15

Equation2: a c + (-8) + (-15)= a c -23= -25 => a c= -2

Equation3: a*(-15) + (-8)*c=18

From equation1: c= -2 -a

Substitute into equation3:

-15a -8*(-2 -a)=18 =>-15a +16 +8a=18 =>-7a +16=18 =>-7a=2 =>a= -2/7, not integer.

b=-10, d=-12

Equation2: a c + (-10) + (-12)= a c -22= -25 => a c= -3

Equation3: a*(-12) + (-10)*c=18

From equation1: c= -2 -a

Substitute into equation3:

-12a -10*(-2 -a)=18 =>-12a +20 +10a=18 =>-2a +20=18 =>-2a= -2 =>a=1

Thus, a=1, c= -3

Check equation2: a c=1*(-3)= -3, which matches.

So, we have a=1, c=-3, b=-10, d=-12

So, the quartic factors as:

(t² + a t + b)(t² + c t + d) = (t² +1 t -10)(t² -3 t -12)

Therefore, the quartic factors as (t² + t -10)(t² -3 t -12)=0

So, t² + t -10=0 or t² -3 t -12=0

Solving t² + t -10=0:

t = [-1 ± sqrt(1 +40)] /2 = [-1 ± sqrt(41)]/2

Solving t² -3 t -12=0:

t = [3 ± sqrt(9 +48)] /2 = [3 ± sqrt(57)]/2

So, t is in terms of x sqrt(3). So, we have:

t = [-1 ± sqrt(41)]/2 or t = [3 ± sqrt(57)]/2

But t = x sqrt(3), so x = t / sqrt(3)

So, x = [ -1 ± sqrt(41) ] / (2 sqrt(3)) or x = [3 ± sqrt(57) ] / (2 sqrt(3))

Simplify:

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):

x = [ (-1 ± sqrt(41)) sqrt(3) ] / 6 or x = [ (3 ± sqrt(57)) sqrt(3) ] / 6

Simplify sqrt(57)=sqrt(3*19)=sqrt(3)*sqrt(19), so:

x = [ (3 ± sqrt(3)*sqrt(19)) sqrt(3) ] /6 = [3 sqrt(3) ± sqrt(57) ] /6

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait:

Wait, sqrt(57) is separate. So, the second solution:

x = [3 ± sqrt(57)] / (2 sqrt(3)) = [3/(2 sqrt(3))] ± [sqrt(57)/(2 sqrt(3))]

Simplify:

3/(2 sqrt(3)) = (sqrt(3)/2)

Similarly, sqrt(57)/sqrt(3) = sqrt(19)

Thus, x = sqrt(3)/2 ± sqrt(19)/2

Therefore, x = (sqrt(3) ± sqrt(19))/2

Therefore, the real roots of the quartic are:

x = [ -1 ± sqrt(41) ] / (2 sqrt(3)) and x = [ sqrt(3) ± sqrt(19) ] / 2

Now, let's compute each x.

First, x = [ -1 + sqrt(41) ] / (2 sqrt(3)) ≈ (-1 +6.4)/3.464 ≈5.4 /3.464≈1.56

x = [ -1 - sqrt(41) ] / (2 sqrt(3))≈ (-1 -6.4)/3.464≈-7.4 /3.464≈-2.138

x = [ sqrt(3) + sqrt(19) ] /2 ≈(1.732 +4.358)/2≈6.09/2≈3.045

x = [ sqrt(3) - sqrt(19) ] /2≈(1.732 -4.358)/2≈-2.626/2≈-1.313

So, the quartic has four real roots: approximately 1.56, -2.138, 3.045, -1.313

Now, since the original problem is about the intersection in the fourth quadrant, which requires x negative and y negative.

So, from these x values, the negative x candidates are x≈-2.138 and x≈-1.313

We need to substitute these into the equation Y = X² -4 to get y.

First, for x≈-2.138:

y = (-2.138)^2 -4 ≈4.57 -4≈0.57. Positive y, so not in fourth quadrant.

For x≈-1.313:

y=(-1.313)^2 -4≈1.724 -4≈-2.276, which is negative. So, the point is approximately (-1.313, -2.276), which is in the third quadrant.

Wait, but the problem states that the unique point in the fourth quadrant. So, perhaps one of the positive x's is in the fourth quadrant?

Wait, for x≈1.56:

y= (1.56)^2 -4≈2.43 -4≈-1.57, so y≈-1.57, so point is (1.56, -1.57), which is in the fourth quadrant.

Similarly, for x≈3.045:

y=(3.045)^2 -4≈9.27 -4≈5.27, which is positive, so point is in first quadrant.

So, we have two points of intersection in the fourth quadrant? Wait, no, only one, because the other one is in the third.

Wait, but the quartic equation had two real roots in x negative: one with positive y and one with negative y.

Wait, the point with x≈-1.313 is in third quadrant, and the point with x≈1.56 is in fourth quadrant.

But the problem says "the unique point in the fourth quadrant", so perhaps the other intersection is not in fourth.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, when I solved the quartic, t = x sqrt(3) where t was found as t = [-1 ± sqrt(41)] / 2 or t = [3 ± sqrt(57)] / 2

But then when I converted back, x = t / sqrt(3). So, the quartic had four real roots: x≈1.56, x≈-2.138, x≈3.045, x≈-1.313

Wait, actually, in the original substitution, I had t = x sqrt(3). So, t = [ -1 ± sqrt(41) ] /2, which is approximately [ -1 +6.4 ] /2≈5.4 /2≈2.7 and [ -1 -6.4 ] /2≈-7.4 /2≈-3.7

And t = [3 ± sqrt(57)] /2≈[3 ±7.55]/2≈(10.55)/2≈5.275 and (-4.55)/2≈-2.275

Therefore, t≈2.7, t≈-3.7, t≈5.275, t≈-2.275

Thus, x = t / sqrt(3), so x≈2.7 /1.732≈1.56, x≈-3.7 /1.732≈-2.138, x≈5.275 /1.732≈3.045, x≈-2.275 /1.732≈-1.313

Thus, x≈1.56, x≈-2.138, x≈3.045, x≈-1.313

So, two positive x, two negative x.

So, for positive x≈1.56, y≈-1.57, so in fourth quadrant.

For positive x≈3.045, y≈5.27, in first quadrant.

For negative x≈-2.138, y≈0.57, in first quadrant.

For negative x≈-1.313, y≈-2.276, in third quadrant.

So, only one point in the fourth quadrant: (≈1.56, ≈-1.57)

Similarly, one point in the third quadrant: (≈-1.313, ≈-2.276)

So, perhaps because of the rotation, the image of the parabola intersects the original parabola in two points in fourth quadrant? But the problem says "the unique point in the fourth quadrant where the original parabola and its image intersect"

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier when I thought that x = sqrt(3) and x = -4 sqrt(3)/3 were roots. They are not roots of the quartic, as we saw. So, in reality, the quartic has two points in fourth quadrant: x≈1.56 and x≈-1.313, but one is in fourth, one in third.

But the problem states "the unique point in the fourth quadrant", so maybe I was wrong in my initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps after rotation, the parabola is only intersecting the original parabola once in the fourth quadrant. So, maybe the x≈1.56 is an extraneous solution?

Wait, no, because when I checked x≈1.56, it's in fourth quadrant, and lies on both the original parabola and the rotated parabola.

Wait, but the original quartic had two real roots in the fourth quadrant? Or one?

Wait, the quartic equation, when factoring, gave four real roots, two positive x, two negative x.

But the original quartic equation comes from setting the rotated parabola equal to the original parabola, so for each x, y must satisfy both equations.

But when I plug x≈1.56 into the original parabola, y≈-1.57

But when I plug x≈1.56 into the rotated parabola equations, I must also get the same y.

But earlier, when I tried to plug x=sqrt(3) into the rotated parabola, it didn't lie on the original.

So, maybe the quartic is correct, but in reality, only one of the points is in the fourth quadrant.

Wait, but the quartic equation had x≈1.56 which is in the fourth quadrant, and x≈-1.313 in the third quadrant.

So, only one point in the fourth quadrant. So, perhaps x≈1.56 is the unique point.

But the problem says "the unique point in the fourth quadrant where the original parabola and its image intersect".

So, perhaps that is the point.

But let's compute the exact value, not the approximate. So, from the quartic factoring, we had:

t = [ -1 ± sqrt(41) ] /2 or t = [3 ± sqrt(57)] /2

But t = x sqrt(3), so x = t / sqrt(3)

So, the positive x in the fourth quadrant is:

x = [ sqrt(41) -1 ] / (2 sqrt(3)) or x= [3 + sqrt(57)] / (2 sqrt(3))

Wait, no. From t = [ -1 + sqrt(41) ] /2, x = [ (-1 + sqrt(41)) /2 ] / sqrt(3) = (-1 + sqrt(41))/(2 sqrt(3))

Similarly, t = [3 + sqrt(57)] /2, x= [ (3 + sqrt(57)) /2 ] / sqrt(3)= (3 + sqrt(57))/(2 sqrt(3))

But the positive x in the fourth quadrant is x = [ -1 + sqrt(41) ] / (2 sqrt(3)) because sqrt(41)≈6.4 >1, so the other root is negative.

Wait, no: t = [ -1 + sqrt(41) ] /2 is positive, so x = [ -1 + sqrt(41) ] / (2 sqrt(3)) is positive.

Similarly, t = [3 + sqrt(57)] /2 is positive, so x = [3 + sqrt(57)] / (2 sqrt(3)) is positive.

So, both are positive x, but only x≈1.56 is in the fourth quadrant.

x≈3.045 is in the first quadrant.

So, the point in the fourth quadrant is x = [ -1 + sqrt(41) ] / (2 sqrt(3)), and y = x² -4

Compute y:

x = [ sqrt(41) -1 ] / (2 sqrt(3))

So, x² = [ (sqrt(41) -1)^2 ] / (4*3) = [41 - 2 sqrt(41) +1 ] /12 = [42 - 2 sqrt(41)] /12 = [21 - sqrt(41)] /6

So, y = x² -4 = [21 - sqrt(41)] /6 -4 = [21 - sqrt(41) -24]/6 = [ -3 - sqrt(41) ] /6

So, the point is ( [ sqrt(41) -1 ] / (2 sqrt(3)) , [ -3 - sqrt(41) ] /6 )

But the problem states that in the fourth quadrant, the y-coordinate is [a +0b sqrt(c)] /d, where a, b, d are relatively prime positive integers, and c is square-free.

Wait, in our case, the y-coordinate is [ -3 - sqrt(41) ] /6. So, it can be written as [ -3 - sqrt(41) ] /6, but since we want it in the form [a + b sqrt(c)] /d, where a, b are integers.

But in this case, a = -3, b = -1, c=41, d=6.

But the problem says "the unique point in the fourth quadrant... where the y-coordinate is ... a/b + c/b sqrt(d)", and "a, b, c, d are positive integers...".

Wait, in the problem statement, the user mentions "the y-coordinate... is a/b + c/b sqrt(d)", which is a bit ambiguous. It could be interpreted as (a + c sqrt(d))/b, or a/b + c sqrt(d), which is a different interpretation.

But in the original problem statement, it's written as "a/b + c/b sqrt(d)". So, more precisely, it's (a + c sqrt(d)) / b.

So, in our case, the y-coordinate is [ -3 - sqrt(41) ] /6, which can be written as ( -3 + (-1) sqrt(41) ) /6. So, a= -3, c= -1, but they have to be positive integers.

Wait, the problem says a, b, c, d are positive integers. So, a, c must be positive. So, if we have negative coefficients, that would not fit.

But perhaps we can factor out a negative sign.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let's compute y again.

Given x = [ sqrt(41) -1 ] / (2 sqrt(3))

So, x² = [ (sqrt(41) -1)^2 ] / (4*3) = (41 - 2 sqrt(41) +1)/12 = (42 - 2 sqrt(41))/12 = (21 - sqrt(41))/6

So, y = x² -4 = (21 - sqrt(41))/6 - 4 = (21 - sqrt(41) -24)/6 = (-3 - sqrt(41))/6

So, it's correct. But the problem says a, b, c, d positive integers.

Thus, perhaps we can write it as ( -3 - sqrt(41) ) /6 = [ -3 + (-1) sqrt(41) ] /6, but since a and c are positive, perhaps I need to write it differently.

Alternatively, maybe the x-coordinate is negative, which would place it in the second quadrant, but the problem specifies the fourth quadrant.

Wait, no. Wait, the x-coordinate is [ sqrt(41) -1 ] / (2 sqrt(3)) ≈(6.4 -1)/3.464≈5.4/3.464≈1.56, which is positive.

So, x is positive, y is negative, so it's in the fourth quadrant. So, it's correct.

But the y-coordinate is [ -3 - sqrt(41) ] /6, which is negative.

Given that a, b, c, d are positive integers, we can write [ -3 - sqrt(41) ] /6 as [ -3 - sqrt(41) ] /6, but a and c are positive. So, perhaps factor a negative sign.

Wait, but the problem says "the y-coordinate is a/b + c/b sqrt(d)", so if we factor out a negative, it would be a = -3, c = -1, which are not positive. So, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps we have to consider that when solving for y, we can write it as y = x² -4 = [ (sqrt(41) -1)^2 / (12) ] -4, which is positive? No, because sqrt(41)≈6.4, so (6.4 -1)^2≈29.16, divided by 12≈2.43, minus 4≈-1.57. So, y≈-1.57, which is negative. So, the exact value is [21 - sqrt(41)]/6 -4 = [21 - sqrt(41) -24]/6 = [ -3 - sqrt(41) ] /6, as we had before.

Wait, perhaps the problem's wording is different. It says "the unique point in the fourth quadrant... where the y-coordinate is a/b + c/b sqrt(d)", so maybe it's (a + c sqrt(d))/b, with a, c positive.

But in our case, it's ( -3 - sqrt(41) ) /6, which is negative. So, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, maybe when we rotated the point, it's supposed to be in the fourth quadrant, but perhaps I rotated in the wrong direction.

Wait, earlier, I assumed the rotation was 60 degrees, but the direction is counterclockwise. Wait, in the standard coordinate system, counterclockwise rotation would move the point from the first to the second quadrant, but maybe in our case, the point is in the fourth quadrant.

Wait, maybe the point is in the fourth quadrant, so perhaps we need to consider the inverse rotation? Maybe rotate clockwise instead.

Wait, perhaps if we rotate the parabola clockwise by 60 degrees, the intersection point would be in the fourth quadrant.

But that would change the rotation matrix.

So, the rotation matrix for clockwise rotation by theta is:

X = x cos(theta) + y sin(theta)

Y = -x sin(theta) + y cos(theta)

So, for theta=60 degrees:

cos(theta)=0.5, sin(theta)=sqrt(3)/2

So, the equations become:

X = 0.5 x + (sqrt(3)/2) y

Y = - (sqrt(3)/2) x + 0.5 y

So, if I apply this rotation, and then set the rotated point to lie on the original parabola X² - Y =4.

So, substituting:

(0.5 x + (sqrt(3)/2) y)^2 - ( - (sqrt(3)/2) x + 0.5 y ) =4

And since the original point lies on y =x² -4, so y =x² -4.

So, substituting y =x² -4 into the rotated equations.

Compute each term:

First, compute X:

X =0.5 x + (sqrt(3)/2) y =0.5 x + (sqrt(3)/2)(x² -4) =0.5 x + (sqrt(3)/2)x² - 2 sqrt(3)

Compute Y:

Y = - (sqrt(3)/2) x + 0.5 y = - (sqrt(3)/2) x + 0.5(x² -4) = - (sqrt(3)/2)x +0.5 x² -2

So, the rotated point (X, Y) lies on the original parabola, so:

X² - Y =4

So, substitute:

[0.5 x + (sqrt(3)/2)x² - 2 sqrt(3)]² - [ - (sqrt(3)/2)x +0.5 x² -2 ] =4

Expand the left-hand side:

First term: [0.5 x + (sqrt(3)/2)x² - 2 sqrt(3)]²

Let me denote A =0.5 x, B = (sqrt(3)/2)x², C = -2 sqrt(3)

So, (A + B + C)^2 = A² + B² + C² + 2AB + 2AC + 2BC

Compute each:

A² = (0.5 x)^2 =0.25 x²

B² = (sqrt(3)/2 x²)^2 = (3/4)x⁴

C² = ( -2 sqrt(3) )² =12

2AB =2*(0.5x)*(sqrt(3)/2 x²)=2*(0.5*sqrt(3)/2)x³= (sqrt(3)/2)x³

2AC =2*(0.5x)*(-2 sqrt(3))=2*(-x sqrt(3))= -2 sqrt(3) x

2BC =2*(sqrt(3)/2 x²)*(-2 sqrt(3))=2*( -3 x² )= -6 x²

So, adding all together:

0.25 x² + (3/4)x⁴ +12 + (sqrt(3)/2)x³ -2 sqrt(3) x -6 x²

Simplify:

(3/4)x⁴ + (sqrt(3)/2)x³ + (0.25 x² -6 x²) -2 sqrt(3)x +12

= (3/4)x⁴ + (sqrt(3)/2)x³ - (11/4) x² -2 sqrt(3) x +12

Second term: -Y = -[ - (sqrt(3)/2)x +0.5 x² -2 ]= (sqrt(3)/2)x -0.5 x² +2

Therefore, entire left-hand side:

(3/4)x⁴ + (sqrt(3)/2)x³ - (11/4) x² -2 sqrt(3)x +12 + (sqrt(3)/2)x -0.5 x² +2

Simplify:

Combine like terms:

- x⁴: (3/4)x⁴

- x³: (sqrt(3)/2)x³

- x²: - (11/4)x² -0.5x² = - (11/4 + 2/4)x² = - (13/4)x²

- x terms: -2 sqrt(3) x + (sqrt(3)/2)x = (-2 sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2)x = (- (4 sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2))x = (-3 sqrt(3)/2)x

- constants: 12 +2=14

So, overall:

(3/4)x⁴ + (sqrt(3)/2)x³ - (13/4)x² - (3 sqrt(3)/2)x +14 =4

Subtract 4:

(3/4)x⁴ + (sqrt(3)/2)x³ - (13/4)x² - (3 sqrt(3)/2)x +10 =0

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:

3x⁴ + 2 sqrt(3) x³ -13 x² -6 sqrt(3)x +40=0

So, we get another quartic equation:

3x⁴ + 2 sqrt(3)x³ -13x² -6 sqrt(3)x +40=0

Let me see if this quartic can be factored.

Again, using substitution t =x sqrt(3), so x = t / sqrt(3)

So, x² = t² /3, x³ = t³ / (3 sqrt(3)), x⁴ =t⁴ /9

Substitute into quartic:

3*(t⁴ /9) + 2 sqrt(3)*(t³ / (3 sqrt(3))) -13*(t² /3) -6 sqrt(3)*(t / sqrt(3)) +40=0

Simplify each term:

1) 3*(t⁴ /9)= t⁴ /3

2) 2 sqrt(3)*(t³ / (3 sqrt(3)))= 2 sqrt(3)/ (3 sqrt(3)) t³= 2/3 t³

3) -13*(t² /3)= -13/3 t²

4) -6 sqrt(3)*(t / sqrt(3))= -6 t

5) +40=40

So, equation becomes:

(t⁴)/3 + (2/3)t³ - (13/3)t² -6t +40=0

Multiply both sides by 3:

t⁴ +2 t³ -13 t² -18 t +120=0

So, quartic equation: t⁴ +2 t³ -13 t² -18 t +120=0

Let me try to factor this quartic.

Possible rational roots: factors of 120 over factors of 1: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±5, ±6, ±8, ±10, ±12, ±15, etc.

Wait, this is not working. Maybe use rational root theorem.

Wait, since the quartic is t⁴ +2 t³ -13 t² -18 t +120=0, perhaps factor into quadratics.

Assume (t² + a t + b)(t² + c t + d)=t⁴ + (a +c)t³ + (ac +b +d)t² + (ad +bc)t +bd

Set equal to t⁴ +2 t³ -13 t² -18 t +120

Thus,

1) a + c =2

2) a c + b + d= -13

3) a d + b c= -18

4) b d=120

We need integer b and d such that b d=120, and a c + b + d= -13.

Looking for factors of 120:

Possible pairs (b,d): (1,120),(2,60),(3,40),(4,30),(5,24),(6,20),(8,15),(10,12), and negatives.

Trying positive pairs first:

Try b=5, d=24:

Then, a +c=2

ad + bc= a*24 +5 c= -18

From a +c=2 =>c=2 -a

Substitute into ad + bc:

24 a +5(2 -a)=24a +10 -5a=19a +10= -18

Thus, 19a= -28 => a= -28/19, not integer.

Next, b=6, d=20:

ad + bc=20a +6c= -18

With a +c=2, c=2 -a

Thus, 20a +6(2 -a)=20a +12 -6a=14a +12= -18

14a= -30 =>a= -30/14= -15/7, not integer.

Next, b=8, d=15:

ad + bc=15a +8c= -18

With a +c=2, c=2 -a

Thus, 15a +8(2 -a)=15a +16 -8a=7a +16= -18

7a= -34 =>a= -34/7, not integer.

Next, b=10,d=12:

ad + bc=12a +10c= -18

With a +c=2, c=2 -a

Thus, 12a +10(2 -a)=12a +20 -10a=2a +20= -18

2a= -38 =>a= -19

Then, c=2 - (-19)=21

Check condition 2: a c + b + d= (-19)*21 +10 +12= -399 +22= -377≠-13

Not matching.

Next, b= -5, d= -24:

ad + bc= a*(-24) + (-5)c= -24a -5c= -18

With a +c=2, c=2 -a

Thus, -24a -5(2 -a)= -24a -10 +5a= -19a -10= -18

-19a= -8 =>a= 8/19, not integer.

Similarly, trying b= -6,d= -20:

ad + bc= a*(-20) + (-6)c= -20a -6c= -18

With a +c=2, c=2 -a

Thus, -20a -6(2 -a)= -20a -12 +6a= -14a -12= -18

-14a= -6 =>a=6/14=3/7, not integer.

Similarly, b= -8, d= -15:

ad + bc= a*(-15) + (-8)c= -15a -8c= -18

With a +c=2, c=2 -a

Thus, -15a -8(2 -a)= -15a -16 +8a= -7a -16= -18

-7a= -2 =>a= 2/7, not integer.

b= -10,d= -12:

ad + bc= a*(-12) + (-10)c= -12a -10c= -18

With a +c=2,c=2 -a

Thus, -12a -10(2 -a)= -12a -20 +10a= -2a -20= -18

-2a=2 =>a= -1

Then, c=2 - (-1)=3

Check condition 2: a c + b + d= (-1)(3) + (-10) + (-12)= -3 -10 -12= -25≠-13

Not matching.

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Maybe try other factor pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartic is not factorable with integers, so maybe I should use substitution.

Let me set u = t² + t, then the quartic becomes:

t⁴ +2 t³ -13 t² -18 t +120= (t⁴ +2 t³) -13 t² -18 t +120= u² -13 t² -18 t +120

But u = t² +t, so t² = u - t

So, u² -13(u - t) -18 t +120= u² -13u +13 t -18 t +120= u² -13u -5t +120

But since u = t² + t, this doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, maybe try to factor as (t² + a t + b)(t² + c t + d)= t⁴ + (a +c)t³ + (ac + b + d)t² + (ad + bc)t + b d= t⁴ +2 t³ -13 t² -18 t +120

So, again, same as before. Maybe using substitution t = w + k for some k to eliminate the cubic term.

But this is getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps use numerical methods to approximate the roots.

But since the problem is about exact form, perhaps the quartic is factorable in some other way.

Wait, perhaps try t= -5:

(-5)^4 +2*(-5)^3 -13*(-5)^2 -18*(-5) +120=625 -250 -325 +90 +120=625-250=375;375-325=50;50+90=140;140+120=260≠0

Wait, so perhaps there are no rational roots, which suggests that this quartic might not factor easily. Therefore, maybe the initial approach of using the rotated system was better, but it didn't give the correct result.

Wait, let me think differently.

Maybe using the parametric equations for the parabola.

Given that the original parabola is y =x² -4, any point on it can be written as (t, t² -4). When we rotate this point by 60 degrees, we get another point (X, Y) on the rotated parabola.

So, using rotation formulas:

X = t cos 60 - (t² -4) sin 60

Y = t sin 60 + (t² -4) cos 60

Simplify.

cos 60=0.5, sin60= sqrt(3)/2

Thus,

X= t*(0.5) - (t² -4)(sqrt(3)/2)=0.5 t - (sqrt(3)/2)(t² -4)

Y= t*(sqrt(3)/2) + (t² -4)*0.5= (sqrt(3)/2) t +0.5(t² -4)

Now, since (X,Y) lies on the original parabola X² - Y =4

So,

(0.5 t - (sqrt(3)/2)(t² -4))² - ( (sqrt(3)/2) t +0.5(t² -4) ) =4

Let me compute each term.

First, compute X:

X= 0.5 t - (sqrt(3)/2)(t² -4)=0.5 t - (sqrt(3)/2)t² + 2 sqrt(3)

Second, compute Y:

Y= (sqrt(3)/2) t +0.5(t² -4)= (sqrt(3)/2)t +0.5 t² -2

Now, compute X²:

X²= [0.5 t - (sqrt(3)/2)t² + 2 sqrt(3)]²

= (0.5 t)^2 + [ - (sqrt(3)/2)t² +2 sqrt(3) ]² + 2*(0.5 t)*[ - (sqrt(3)/2)t² +2 sqrt(3) ]

=0.25 t² + [ (3/4)t⁴ - 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*2 sqrt(3) t² + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 *4 ] + 2*( -0.5 sqrt(3)/2 t³ +0.5*2 sqrt(3) t )

=0.25 t² + [ (3/4)t⁴ - 6 t² + 3 t² ] + [ - (sqrt(3)/2) t³ + 2 sqrt(3) t ]

Simplify:

=0.25 t² + (3/4 t⁴ -3 t² ) + ( - (sqrt(3)/2) t³ + 2 sqrt(3) t )

= 3/4 t⁴ - (3/4) t² - (sqrt(3)/2) t³ + 2 sqrt(3) t

Now, compute Y:

Y= (sqrt(3)/2) t +0.5 t² -2

So, Y=0.5 t² + (sqrt(3)/2) t -2

Compute Y²:

Y²= [0.5 t² + (sqrt(3)/2) t -2]²

= (0.5 t²)^2 + [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ]² + (-2)^2 + 2*(0.5 t²)*(sqrt(3)/2 t) + 2*(0.5 t²)*(-2) + 2*(sqrt(3)/2 t)*(-2)

=0.25 t⁴ + (3/4) t² +4 + (sqrt(3)/2) t³ - 2 t² -2 sqrt(3) t

Simplify:

=0.25 t⁴ + (3/4 -2) t² +4 + (sqrt(3)/2) t³ -2 sqrt(3) t

=0.25 t⁴ - (5/4) t² +4 + (sqrt(3)/2) t³ -2 sqrt(3) t

Now, compute X² - Y:

X² - Y= [3/4 t⁴ - (3/4) t² - (sqrt(3)/2) t³ + 2 sqrt(3) t ] - [0.25 t⁴ - (5/4) t² +4 + (sqrt(3)/2) t³ -2 sqrt(3) t ]

=3/4 t⁴ - (3/4) t² - (sqrt(3)/2) t³ + 2 sqrt(3) t -0.25 t⁴ + (5/4) t² -4 - (sqrt(3)/2) t³ +2 sqrt(3) t

Combine like terms:

t⁴: 3/4 -0.25= 3/4 -1/4=2/4=1/2

t³: -sqrt(3)/2 -sqrt(3)/2= -sqrt(3)

t²: -3/4 +5/4=2/4=1/2

t: 2 sqrt(3) +2 sqrt(3)=4 sqrt(3)

Constants: -4

Thus, X² - Y= (1/2)t⁴ - sqrt(3) t³ + (1/2) t² +4 sqrt(3) t -4=4

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate fractions:

t⁴ -2 sqrt(3) t³ + t² +8 sqrt(3) t -8=8

Thus,

t⁴ -2 sqrt(3) t³ + t² +8 sqrt(3) t -16=0

So, we have the quartic equation in terms of t:

t⁴ -2 sqrt(3) t³ + t² +8 sqrt(3) t -16=0

We can try to factor this quartic.

Perhaps factor it as (t² + a t + b)(t² + c t + d)=t⁴ + (a +c)t³ + (ac +b +d)t² + (ad + bc)t + b d= t⁴ -2 sqrt(3) t³ + t² +8 sqrt(3) t -16

Therefore,

1) a +c= -2 sqrt(3)

2) a c +b +d=1

3) a d +b c=8 sqrt(3)

4) b d= -16

We need to find integers b and d such that b d= -16.

Possible pairs:

(1, -16), (-1,16),(2, -8),(-2,8),(4, -4), etc.

Trying b=4, d= -4:

Then, equation 2: a c +4 -4= a c=1

Equation3: a*(-4) +4 c= -4a +4c=8 sqrt(3)

Equation1: a +c= -2 sqrt(3)

So, from equation1: c= -2 sqrt(3) -a

Plug into equation3: -4a +4*(-2 sqrt(3) -a)= -4a -8 sqrt(3) -4a= -8a -8 sqrt(3)=8 sqrt(3)

Thus, -8a=16 sqrt(3)=> a= -2 sqrt(3)

Then, c= -2 sqrt(3) - (-2 sqrt(3))=0

Check equation2: a c= (-2 sqrt(3))(0)=0≠1. Doesn't work.

Next, try b=8, d= -2:

Equation4:8*(-2)= -16

Equation2: a c +8 -2= a c +6=1 => a c= -5

Equation3: a*(-2) +8 c= -2a +8c=8 sqrt(3)

Equation1: a +c= -2 sqrt(3)

So, c= -2 sqrt(3) -a

Plug into equation3:

-2a +8*(-2 sqrt(3) -a)= -2a -16 sqrt(3) -8a= -10a -16 sqrt(3)=8 sqrt(3)

Thus, -10a=24 sqrt(3)=> a= -24 sqrt(3)/10= -12 sqrt(3)/5

Not integer. Not suitable.

Trying b=2, d= -8:

Equation4:2*(-8)= -16

Equation2: a c +2 -8= a c -6=1 => a c=7

Equation3: a*(-8) +2 c= -8a +2c=8 sqrt(3)

Equation1: a +c= -2 sqrt(3)

From equation1: c= -2 sqrt(3) -a

Plug into equation3:

-8a +2*(-2 sqrt(3) -a)= -8a -4 sqrt(3) -2a= -10a -4 sqrt(3)=8 sqrt(3)

Thus, -10a=12 sqrt(3)=> a= -12 sqrt(3)/10= -6 sqrt(3)/5

Not integer. Not suitable.

Next, try b= -4, d=4:

Equation4: (-4)(4)= -16

Equation2: a c + (-4) +4= a c=1

Equation3: a*4 + (-4)c=4a -4c=8 sqrt(3)

Equation1: a +c= -2 sqrt(3)

So, c= -2 sqrt(3) -a

Plug into equation3:

4a -4*(-2 sqrt(3) -a)=4a +8 sqrt(3) +4a=8a +8 sqrt(3)=8 sqrt(3)

Thus, 8a=0 => a=0

Then, c= -2 sqrt(3)

Check equation2: a c=0*(-2 sqrt(3))=0≠1. Doesn't work.

Next, try b= -2, d=8:

Equation4: (-2)(8)= -16

Equation2: a c + (-2)+8= a c +6=1 => a c= -5

Equation3: a*8 + (-2)c=8a -2c=8 sqrt(3)

Equation1: a +c= -2 sqrt(3)

From equation1: c= -2 sqrt(3) -a

Plug into equation3:

8a -2*(-2 sqrt(3) -a)=8a +4 sqrt(3) +2a=10a +4 sqrt(3)=8 sqrt(3)

Thus, 10a=4 sqrt(3)=>a= 2 sqrt(3)/5

Not integer.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartic is not factorable over integers, so perhaps use substitution.

Let me set u = t sqrt(3) => t= u / sqrt(3)

Then, t sqrt(3)=u

Compute each term:

t⁴= u⁴ / (sqrt(3))⁴= u⁴ /9

-2 sqrt(3) t³= -2 sqrt(3)*(u³ / (sqrt(3))³)= -2 sqrt(3)*(u³ / (3 sqrt(3)))= -2 sqrt(3)*(u³)/(3 sqrt(3))= -2 u³ /3

t²= u² /3

8 sqrt(3) t=8 sqrt(3)*(u / sqrt(3))=8u

So, the quartic equation becomes:

(u⁴)/9 - (2/3) u³ + (u²)/3 +8 u -16=0

Multiply by 9:

u⁴ -6 u³ +3 u² +72 u -144=0

So, quartic equation in u:

u⁴ -6 u³ +3 u² +72 u -144=0

Let me try to factor this.

Check for rational roots: possible roots are factors of 144 over 1.

So, ±1, ±2, ±3, etc.

Test u=3:

81 - 162 +27 +216 -144=81-162= -81; -81+27=-54; -54+216=162;162-144=18≠0

u=4:

256 - 384 +48 +288 -144=256-384=-128; -128+48=-80; -80+288=208;208-144=64≠0

u=6:

1296 - 6*216=1296-1296=0;0+3*36=108;108+432=540;540-144=396≠0

u=2:

16 -48 +12 +144 -144=16-48=-32; -32+12=-20; -20+144=124;124-144=-20≠0

u=1:

1 -6 +3 +72 -144=1-6=-5; -5+3=-2; -2+72=70;70-144=-74≠0

u= -3:

81 +162 +27 -216 -144=81+162=243;243+27=270;270-216=54;54-144=-90≠0

u=12:

Too large, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe factor quartic into quadratics:

(u² + a u + b)(u² + c u + d)=u⁴ + (a +c)u³ + (ac +b +d)u² + (ad + bc)u + b d= u⁴ -6 u³ +3 u² +72 u -144

Thus,

1) a +c= -6

2) a c +b +d=3

3) a d +b c=72

4) b d= -144

Looking for integer solutions.

Possible factor pairs for b d= -144:

(12, -12),(9, -16),(16, -9),(18, -8),(24, -6),( etc.)

Try b=12, d= -12:

Equation4:12*(-12)= -144

Equation2: a c +12 -12= a c=3

Equation3: a*(-12) +12 c= -12a +12c=72 => -a +c=6

Equation1: a +c= -6

So, we have:

From equation3 and1:

c=6 +a

Plug into equation1:

a +6 +a= -6 =>2a +6= -6 =>2a= -12 =>a= -6

Thus, c=6 + (-6)=0

Check equation2: a c= (-6)(0)=0≠3. Not good.

Next, try b= -12,d=12:

Equation4: (-12)(12)= -144

Equation2: a c + (-12) +12= a c=3

Equation3: a*12 + (-12)c=12a -12c=72 =>a -c=6

Equation1: a +c= -6

Thus, from equation3: a -c=6

From equation1: a +c= -6

Adding both equations:

2a=0 =>a=0

Then, c= -6

Check equation2: a c=0*(-6)=0≠3. Not good.

Next, try b=9, d= -16:

Equation4:9*(-16)= -144

Equation2: a c +9 -16= a c -7=3 =>a c=10

Equation3: a*(-16) +9 c= -16a +9c=72

Equation1: a +c= -6

From equation1: c= -6 -a

Plug into equation3:

-16a +9*(-6 -a)= -16a -54 -9a= -25a -54=72

Thus, -25a=126 =>a= -126/25, not integer. Not good.

Next, try b=16, d= -9:

Equation4:16*(-9)= -144

Equation2:a c +16 -9= a c +7=3 =>a c= -4

Equation3: a*(-9) +16c= -9a +16c=72

Equation1: a +c= -6

From equation1: c= -6 -a

Plug into equation3:

-9a +16*(-6 -a)= -9a -96 -16a= -25a -96=72

Thus, -25a=168 =>a= -168/25, not integer.

Next, try b= -9, d=16:

Equation4: (-9)(16)= -144

Equation2: a c -9 +16= a c +7=3 =>a c= -4

Equation3: a*16 + (-9)c=16a -9c=72

Equation1: a +c= -6

From equation1: c= -6 -a

Plug into equation3:

16a -9*(-6 -a)=16a +54 +9a=25a +54=72

Thus, 25a=18 =>a=18/25, not integer.

Next, try b=24, d= -6:

Equation4:24*(-6)= -144

Equation2: a c +24 -6= a c +18=3 =>a c= -15

Equation3: a*(-6) +24c= -6a +24c=72 => -a +4c=12

Equation1: a +c= -6

So, from equation1: a= -6 -c

Plug into equation3: -(-6 -c) +4c=6 +c +4c=6 +5c=12

Thus, 5c=6 =>c=6/5, not integer.

Next, try b= -24,d=6:

Equation4: (-24)(6)= -144

Equation2: a c -24 +6= a c -18=3 =>a c=21

Equation3: a*6 + (-24)c=6a -24c=72 =>a -4c=12

Equation1: a +c= -6

From equation3: a=12 +4c

Plug into equation1:12 +4c +c=12 +5c= -6 =>5c= -18 =>c= -18/5, not integer.

Next, try b= 18,d= -8:

Equation4:18*(-8)= -144

Equation2: a c +18 -8= a c +10=3 =>a c= -7

Equation3: a*(-8) +18c= -8a +18c=72

Equation1: a +c= -6

From equation1: a= -6 -c

Plug into equation3:

-8*(-6 -c) +18c=48 +8c +18c=48 +26c=72

Thus, 26c=24 =>c=24/26=12/13, not integer.

Similarly, trying other factor pairs, it's not working.

Perhaps the quartic is irreducible, so we need to use substitution.

Let me set z= u +k, to eliminate the cubic term.

Equation: u⁴ -6 u³ +3 u² +72 u -144=0

Let z= u + p

Then, u= z -p

Substitute:

(z -p)^4 -6(z -p)^3 +3(z -p)^2 +72(z -p) -144=0

Expand:

(z⁴ -4 p z³ +6 p² z² -4 p³ z +p⁴) -6(z³ -3 p z² +3 p² z -p³) +3(z² -2 p z +p²) +72 z -72 p -144=0

= z⁴ -4 p z³ +6 p² z² -4 p³ z +p⁴ -6 z³ +18 p z² -18 p² z +6 p³ +3 z² -6 p z +3 p² +72 z -72 p -144=0

Group like terms:

z⁴ +(-4 p -6) z³ + (6 p² +18 p +3) z² + (-4 p³ -18 p² -6 p +72) z + (p⁴ +6 p³ +3 p² -72 p -144)=0

Set the coefficient of z³ to zero:

-4 p -6=0 =>p= -6/4= -3/2

Thus, z= u - 3/2

Plug p= -3/2 into other coefficients:

Coefficient of z²:

6*(-3/2)^2 +18*(-3/2) +3=6*(9/4) -27 +3=27/2 -27 +3=13.5 -27 +3= -10.5= -21/2

Coefficient of z:

-4*(-3/2)^3 -18*(-3/2)^2 -6*(-3/2) +72= -4*(-27/8) -18*(9/4) -6*(-3/2) +72=13.5 -40.5 +9 +72= (13.5 -40.5)+(9 +72)= (-27)+(81)=54

Constant term:

(-3/2)^4 +6*(-3/2)^3 +3*(-3/2)^2 -72*(-3/2) -144= (81/16) +6*(-27/8) +3*(9/4) +108 -144=81/16 -162/8 +27/4 +108 -144

Convert all to 16ths:

81/16 -324/16 +108/16 +1728/16 -2304/16= (81 -324 +108 +1728 -2304)/16= (81 +108 +1728=1917; -324 -2304= -2628; 1917 -2628= -711)/16= -711/16

Thus, transformed equation:

z⁴ - (21/2) z² +54 z -711/16=0

Multiply through by 16 to eliminate denominators:

16 z⁴ -168 z² +864 z -711=0

Hmm, still complicated.

Perhaps factor quadratic in z²:

16 z⁴ -168 z² +864 z -711=0

Not obviously factorable.

Alternatively, use substitution y= z², but equation remains:

16 y² -168 y +864 z -711=0

Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps try rational roots for quartic in z:

Possible roots are factors of 711 over 16, but messy.

Alternatively, approximate roots.

But I think this is getting too involved, so perhaps it's best to accept that the quartic has no rational roots, and perhaps the real roots are complex? No, since original problem says intersection in the fourth quadrant, which is real.

Alternatively, perhaps the only real root in positive x is the one with y negative, which is in the fourth quadrant.

From the previous quartic in t, we had t= [sqrt(41) -0.75]/(2 sqrt(3)) which is approximately [6.403 -0.75]/5.196≈5.653/5.196≈1.083, positive t, so y= t² -4=1.913 -4≈-2.087, negative.

So, that is in the fourth quadrant.

Similarly, the other quartic in t had roots at t≈-2.103 and t≈15.84. So, t=-2.103 is negative, gives x≈0.5 t²≈0.5*(4.423)=2.211, positive x, and y≈4.423 -4≈0.423, positive y, so in first quadrant.

While t=15.84 gives x≈15.84² /2≈125.97, y≈15.84² -4≈251. So, in first quadrant.

Thus, the only real intersection in the fourth quadrant is at t≈1.083, so x≈1.172, y≈-2.087.

But problem says y is expressed in terms of x as (a +b sqrt(c))/d with a,b,c,d positive integers, y≠0.

So, we need to express y= x² -4= (something). But in our case, from parametric equations, we have:

y=0.5 t² - (sqrt(3)/2) t +2 sqrt(3)

And x=0.5 t²

Thus, express y in terms of x.

Let me write t²=2x, so t= sqrt(2x)

Thus, y=0.5*(2x) - (sqrt(3)/2)*sqrt(2x) +2 sqrt(3)=x - (sqrt(6)/2) sqrt(x) +2 sqrt(3)

But this is not in the form (a +b sqrt(c))/d.

Alternatively, perhaps square both sides.

But this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps set sqrt(x)=k, then x= k², so y= k² - (sqrt(6)/2) k +2 sqrt(3)

But not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe our quartic equation is wrong, and we should go back.

Wait, in the parametric approach, we get an expression for y in terms of t, and t in terms of x, but since t is sqrt(2x), it's not possible to write y as (a +b sqrt(c))/d.

Wait, but in the parametric solution, the y-coordinate is:

y=0.5 t² - (sqrt(3)/2) t +2 sqrt(3)

But x=0.5 t², so t= sqrt(2x)

Thus, y= x - (sqrt(3)/2) sqrt(2x) +2 sqrt(3)

Thus, y= x +2 sqrt(3) - (sqrt(6)/2) sqrt(x)

But to express this as (a +b sqrt(c))/d, we need to eliminate the square root.

Alternatively, perhaps it's in terms of sqrt(x). If we set sqrt(x)=m, then x=m², and y= m² +2 sqrt(3) - (sqrt(6)/2) m

But it's still not in the required form.

Wait, maybe it's possible to rationalize or manipulate to get rid of the square root.

But unless we can express sqrt(x) in terms of y, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is quadratic in sqrt(x), but I don't think so.

Wait, maybe go back to the quartic equation in x:

3x⁴ +2 sqrt(3)x³ -13x² -6 sqrt(3)x +12=0

Wait, maybe factor as quadratic in sqrt(x):

Let me set k= sqrt(x), so k²=x, then equation becomes:

3(k²)^4 +2 sqrt(3)(k²)^3 -13(k²)^2 -6 sqrt(3)(k²) +12=0

Which is:

3k⁸ +2 sqrt(3)k⁶ -13k⁴ -6 sqrt(3)k² +12=0

Still complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps quartic in t is solvable as quadratic in t².

But equation is:

3t⁴ +2 sqrt(3) t³ -13 t² -6 sqrt(3) t +12=0

It's a quadratic in t²: 3 t⁴ -13 t² +12 +2 sqrt(3) t³ -6 sqrt(3) t=0

Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe divide equation by t²:

3 t² +2 sqrt(3) t -13 -6 sqrt(3)/t +12/t²=0

Set u= t + sqrt(3)/t, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substitution u= t + 1/t

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution v= t - something.

Wait, maybe let me write equation as:

3 t⁴ -13 t² +12 +2 sqrt(3) t³ -6 sqrt(3) t=0

Group terms:

(3 t⁴ -13 t² +12) + sqrt(3)(2 t³ -6 t)=0

Factor:

(3 t⁴ -13 t² +12) +2 sqrt(3) t (t² -3)=0

But not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe factor as (at² +bt +c)(dt² +et +f)=0

Looking for integers a,b,c,d,e,f such that:

a d=3

a e +b d=2 sqrt(3)

a f +b e +c d= -13

a c +b f= -6 sqrt(3)

c f=12

This is too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps accept that y cannot be expressed as (a +b sqrt(c))/d with integer a,b,c,d.

But the problem statement says it is. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps in the parametric substitution, I should have considered that the rotation is 60 degrees, but in reality, the slope of the tangent line is different.

Wait, perhaps the angle of rotation is not 60 degrees, but something else.

Wait, the problem says "rotated 60 degrees", so 60 degrees is the angle of rotation of the parabola, not the slope.

Wait, maybe the tangent line's slope changes by 60 degrees, but in reality, when you rotate the parabola, the tangent lines also rotate, so the angle between the original and rotated tangent lines is 60 degrees.

But the problem is to find the intersection point, which would imply that the rotated tangent line intersects the original parabola's tangent line at some point.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the intersection point is such that the angle between the two tangent lines is 60 degrees.

But without more information, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe the point P is the intersection of two lines: the original tangent at (x0, x0² -4) and the rotated tangent at (X0, X0² -4).

But without knowing the angle of rotation, perhaps it's the same as the rotation of the parabola.

Alternatively, maybe it's the point where the original parabola and the rotated parabola intersect at exactly one point (the vertex).

But in that case, the intersection point is the vertex, but the vertex is at (0, -4), but in that case, y= -4, which is not allowed.

Wait, but in our parametric solution, it's (x,y)= (approx1.172, approx -2.087). So, y is negative, but in the problem, it's given that y≠0, which is satisfied.

But in the problem statement, it's given that y is expressed in terms of x as (a +b sqrt(c))/d. But in our case, y is expressed as x - (sqrt(6)/2) sqrt(x) +2 sqrt(3), which is not of the form (a +b sqrt(c))/d.

Thus, perhaps the problem is expecting us to use a different method.

Wait, perhaps instead of rotating the parabola, they mean that the point P lies on both the original parabola and the rotated parabola, so the intersection points are the points where the two parabolas meet.

In that case, solving the system of equations:

y= x² -4

and

Y= X² -4, but with (X,Y) being the rotated coordinates of (x,y).

But unless we have a relation between X and x, Y and y, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the point where the tangent line is rotated by 60 degrees, resulting in another parabola, and the intersection point is the vertex of the rotated parabola.

But perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the point is simply the vertex of the original parabola, but that's (0,-4), which is in the fourth quadrant, but y= -4 is not of the form (a +b sqrt(c))/d.

Alternatively, perhaps the tangent at (0.5, -3.5). Wait, but that's not on the parabola.

Alternatively, perhaps the point is the intersection of the two parabolas, which is at the vertex.

Wait, the two parabolas intersect at the vertex (0, -4), but in that case, y= -4, which is not the required form.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in parametrization.

Wait, going back, the parametric equations were:

x=0.5 t²

y=0.5 t² -4

And the rotated parabola is y= x² -4.

Thus, setting 0.5 t² -4= (0.5 t²)^2 -4, leading to t⁴ -2 t²=0, which has t=0 as a solution, but that's the vertex. The other solutions lead to x=15.84, which is far from the vertex.

Thus, perhaps the only intersection is at the vertex, so y= -4, which is not the required form.

But problem says y is expressed as (a +b sqrt(c))/d, which is not -4.

Thus, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the quartic equation.

But wait, perhaps the quartic equation in x is:

3x⁴ +2 sqrt(3)x³ -13x² -6 sqrt(3)x +12=0

We can factor this as:

( sqrt(3) x² + a x + b)( sqrt(3) x² + c x + d)=0

But maybe:

( sqrt(3)x² + p x + q)( sqrt(3)x² + r x + s)=0

Expanding:

3x⁴ + (p sqrt(3) + r sqrt(3))x³ + (q sqrt(3) + s sqrt(3) + p r)x² + (p s + q r)x + q s=0

Compare with original equation:

3x⁴ +2 sqrt(3)x³ -13x² -6 sqrt(3)x +12=0

Thus,

1) p sqrt(3) + r sqrt(3)=2 sqrt(3) => p + r=2

2) q sqrt(3) + s sqrt(3) + p r= -13 => sqrt(3)(q +s) + p r= -13

3) p s + q r= -6 sqrt(3)

4) q s=12

Looking for integers p,q,r,s such that:

From equation 4: q s=12

From equation 1: p +r=2

From equation 3: p s + q r= -6 sqrt(3). Wait, this is a mix of rational and irrational terms. To make this hold, the rational part and the irrational part must separately cancel.

Thus,

From equation 3:

p s + q r= -6 sqrt(3)=0 + (-6 sqrt(3))

Thus, equate rational and irrational parts:

Rational part: p s + q r=0

Irrational part: -6= -6, which holds.

Thus,

From equation 3:

p s + q r=0

From equation 1: p + r=2

From equation 4: q s=12

From equation 2: sqrt(3)(q +s) + p r= -13

Thus, we have system:

1) p + r=2

2) q s=12

3) p s + q r=0

4) sqrt(3)(q +s) + p r= -13

We need integers p, r, q, s.

Let me consider possible integer pairs for q and s such that q s=12.

Possible pairs:

(q, s)= (1,12),(2,6),(3,4),(4,3),(6,2),(12,1), (-1,-12), (-2,-6), (-3,-4), (-4,-3), (-6,-2), (-12,-1)

For each, compute p=2 - r, then compute p s + q r=0, and sqrt(3)(q +s) + p r= -13

Let me try q=3, s=4:

Then p + r=2

p*4 +3 r=0

Express p=2 -r

Thus, 4*(2 -r) +3 r=0 =>8 -4 r +3 r=0 =>8 -r=0 =>r=8

Thus, p=2 -8= -6

Check equation 4: sqrt(3)(3 +4) + (-6)(8)=7 sqrt(3) -48≈12.12 -48≈-35.88≠-13

Not good.

Next, q=4, s=3:

p + r=2

p*3 +4 r=0

p=2 -r

Thus, 3*(2 -r) +4 r=6 -3 r +4 r=6 +r=0 =>r= -6

Then, p=2 -(-6)=8

Equation 4: sqrt(3)(4 +3) +8*(-6)=7 sqrt(3) -48≈12.12 -48≈-35.88≠-13

No.

Next, q=2, s=6:

p + r=2

p*6 +2 r=0

p=2 -r

6*(2 -r) +2 r=12 -6r +2 r=12 -4 r=0 =>4 r=12 =>r=3

Then, p=2 -3= -1

Equation4: sqrt(3)(2 +6) + (-1)(3)=8 sqrt(3) -3≈13.85 -3≈10.85≠-13

No.

Next, q=6, s=2:

p + r=2

p*2 +6 r=0

p=2 -r

2*(2 -r)+6 r=4 -2 r +6 r=4 +4 r=0 =>4 r= -4 =>r= -1

Then, p=2 -(-1)=3

Equation4: sqrt(3)(6 +2) +3*(-1)=8 sqrt(3) -3≈13.85 -3≈10.85≠-13

No.

Next, q=12, s=1:

p + r=2

p*1 +12 r=0

p=2 -r

2 -r +12 r=2 +11 r=0 =>11 r= -2 =>r= -2/11, not integer.

q= -3, s= -4:

p + r=2

p*(-4) + (-3) r=0 =>-4 p -3 r=0

p=2 -r

Thus, -4*(2 -r) -3 r= -8 +4 r -3 r= -8 +r=0 =>r=8

Then, p=2 -8= -6

Equation4: sqrt(3)(-3 + (-4)) + (-6)(8)=sqrt(3)(-7) -48≈-7*1.732 -48≈-12.124 -48≈-60.124≠-13

No.

q= -4, s= -3:

p + r=2

p*(-3) + (-4) r=0 =>-3 p -4 r=0

p=2 -r

Thus, -3*(2 -r) -4 r= -6 +3 r -4 r= -6 -r=0 =>r= -6

Then, p=2 -(-6)=8

Equation4: sqrt(3)(-4 + (-3)) +8*(-6)=sqrt(3)(-7) -48≈-7*1.732 -48≈-12.124 -48≈-60.124≠-13

No.

q= -2, s= -6:

p + r=2

p*(-6) + (-2) r=0 =>-6 p -2 r=0 =>3 p +r=0

p=2 -r

Thus, 3*(2 -r) + r=6 -3 r +r=6 -2 r=0 =>2 r=6 =>r=3

Then, p=2 -3= -1

Equation4: sqrt(3)(-2 + (-6)) + (-1)(3)=sqrt(3)(-8) -3≈-8*1.732 -3≈-13.856 -3≈-16.856≠-13

Close, but not exact.

q= -6, s= -2:

p + r=2

p*(-2) + (-6) r=0 =>-2 p -6 r=0 =>p +3 r=0

p=2 -r

Thus, (2 -r) +3 r=2 +2 r=0 =>2 r= -2 =>r= -1

Then, p=2 -(-1)=3

Equation4: sqrt(3)(-6 + (-2)) +3*(-1)=sqrt(3)(-8) -3≈-13.856 -3≈-16.856≠-13

No.

q= -12, s= -1:

p + r=2

p*(-1) + (-12) r=0 =>-p -12 r=0 =>p= -12
