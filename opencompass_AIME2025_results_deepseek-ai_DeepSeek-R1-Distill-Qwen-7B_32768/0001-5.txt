Question:
The set of points in 3-dimensional coordinate space that lie in the plane $x+y+z=75$ whose coordinates satisfy the inequalities $x-yz<y-zx<z-xy$ forms three disjoint convex regions.

The area of this finite region can be expressed in the form $a\sqrt{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b$.

Wrong Answer:
Alright, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we're dealing with points in 3D space lying on the plane \( x + y + z = 75 \). Additionally, these points must satisfy the inequalities \( x - yz < y - zx < z - xy \). The problem states that these points form three disjoint convex regions, but only one of them has a finite area, and we need to find that area expressed in the form \( a\sqrt{b} \) and then compute \( a + b \).

First, let me write down the given plane equation and the inequalities:

Plane: \( x + y + z = 75 \)

Inequalities:
1. \( x - yz < y - zx \)
2. \( y - zx < z - xy \)

So, we have two inequalities to satisfy. Let me try to manipulate these inequalities to express them in terms of variables that might be easier to handle.

Starting with the first inequality: \( x - yz < y - zx \).

Let me bring all terms to the left side:

\( x - yz - y + zx < 0 \)

Factor terms:

\( x + zx - y - yz < 0 \)

Factor x and y:

\( x(1 + z) - y(1 + z) < 0 \)

Factor further:

\( (x - y)(1 + z) < 0 \)

Hmm, interesting. So, \( (x - y)(1 + z) < 0 \). That means either \( (x - y) \) and \( (1 + z) \) are both positive or both negative.

But \( 1 + z \) is a linear term. Since we're dealing with coordinates in 3D space, z can be any real number, so \( 1 + z \) can be positive or negative. So, we have two cases:

1. \( 1 + z > 0 \) and \( x - y < 0 \)
2. \( 1 + z < 0 \) and \( x - y > 0 \)

Similarly, let's look at the second inequality: \( y - zx < z - xy \).

Again, bring all terms to the left:

\( y - zx - z + xy < 0 \)

Factor terms:

\( y + xy - z - zx < 0 \)

Factor y and z:

\( y(1 + x) - z(1 + x) < 0 \)

Factor further:

\( (y - z)(1 + x) < 0 \)

Same structure as the first inequality. So, \( (y - z)(1 + x) < 0 \). Thus, either:

1. \( 1 + x > 0 \) and \( y - z < 0 \)
2. \( 1 + x < 0 \) and \( y - z > 0 \)

So, now we have four cases, but actually, they're not independent because the plane equation relates x, y, z. Let me think about how to handle this.

Given that \( x + y + z = 75 \), we can express one variable in terms of the other two. Maybe express z as \( z = 75 - x - y \). Then, substitute this into the inequalities to reduce the problem to two variables.

Let me try that.

First, substitute \( z = 75 - x - y \) into the first inequality:

\( (x - y)(1 + z) < 0 \)

So, \( (x - y)(1 + 75 - x - y) < 0 \)

Simplify inside the parentheses:

\( 1 + 75 - x - y = 76 - x - y \)

So, the inequality becomes:

\( (x - y)(76 - x - y) < 0 \)

Similarly, substitute \( z = 75 - x - y \) into the second inequality:

\( (y - z)(1 + x) < 0 \)

Which becomes:

\( (y - (75 - x - y))(1 + x) < 0 \)

Simplify inside the parentheses:

\( y - 75 + x + y = x + 2y - 75 \)

So, the inequality is:

\( (x + 2y - 75)(1 + x) < 0 \)

Okay, so now we have two inequalities in terms of x and y:

1. \( (x - y)(76 - x - y) < 0 \)  --- Inequality A
2. \( (x + 2y - 75)(1 + x) < 0 \)  --- Inequality B

So, now we can analyze these inequalities.

Let me first handle Inequality A: \( (x - y)(76 - x - y) < 0 \)

This product is negative, so either:

Case 1: \( x - y > 0 \) and \( 76 - x - y < 0 \)

OR

Case 2: \( x - y < 0 \) and \( 76 - x - y > 0 \)

Similarly, for Inequality B: \( (x + 2y - 75)(1 + x) < 0 \)

This product is negative, so either:

Case 1: \( x + 2y - 75 > 0 \) and \( 1 + x < 0 \)

OR

Case 2: \( x + 2y - 75 < 0 \) and \( 1 + x > 0 \)

So, now we have four combinations of these cases. Let me list them:

1. Case 1 from A and Case 1 from B: \( x - y > 0 \), \( 76 - x - y < 0 \), \( x + 2y - 75 > 0 \), \( 1 + x < 0 \)
2. Case 1 from A and Case 2 from B: \( x - y > 0 \), \( 76 - x - y < 0 \), \( x + 2y - 75 < 0 \), \( 1 + x > 0 \)
3. Case 2 from A and Case 1 from B: \( x - y < 0 \), \( 76 - x - y > 0 \), \( x + 2y - 75 > 0 \), \( 1 + x < 0 \)
4. Case 2 from A and Case 2 from B: \( x - y < 0 \), \( 76 - x - y > 0 \), \( x + 2y - 75 < 0 \), \( 1 + x > 0 \)

Each of these combinations might lead to different regions in the xy-plane. Our goal is to find the regions where all four inequalities hold, which would be the intersection of the regions defined by each case.

But before diving into each case, let me note that \( 1 + x > 0 \) is equivalent to \( x > -1 \), and \( 1 + x < 0 \) is \( x < -1 \). Similarly, \( 76 - x - y > 0 \) is \( x + y < 76 \), and \( 76 - x - y < 0 \) is \( x + y > 76 \). Also, \( x - y > 0 \) is \( y < x \), and \( x - y < 0 \) is \( y > x \). Similarly, \( x + 2y - 75 > 0 \) is \( x + 2y > 75 \), and \( x + 2y - 75 < 0 \) is \( x + 2y < 75 \).

So, perhaps drawing the lines defined by these equalities can help visualize the regions.

Lines:

1. \( x = -1 \)
2. \( x + y = 76 \)
3. \( y = x \)
4. \( x + 2y = 75 \)

These four lines divide the plane into regions, and we can analyze each inequality in each region.

But since we have three inequalities to satisfy (original two and the plane equation), but actually, we're in 2D now with x and y, and z is dependent.

But let's try to figure out for each combination.

Starting with Case 1 from A and Case 1 from B:

1. \( x - y > 0 \) (i.e., y < x)
2. \( x + y > 76 \)
3. \( x + 2y > 75 \)
4. \( x < -1 \)

So, in this case, we have:

- y < x
- x + y > 76
- x + 2y > 75
- x < -1

Let me see if such a region exists. If x < -1, and y < x, then y is less than something negative. Also, x + y > 76, but if x and y are both negative, their sum can't be greater than 76. So, x + y > 76 is impossible if x < -1 and y < x. Therefore, this case leads to no solutions.

Similarly, let's check Case 1 from A and Case 2 from B:

1. \( x - y > 0 \) (y < x)
2. \( x + y < 76 \)
3. \( x + 2y < 75 \)
4. \( x > -1 \)

So, in this case, x > -1, y < x, x + y < 76, and x + 2y < 75.

Let me try to find the feasible region here.

First, since x > -1 and y < x, but not sure yet. Maybe I can graph these.

But maybe it's better to express y in terms of x for some inequalities.

From y < x,

From x + y < 76: y < 76 - x

From x + 2y < 75: 2y < 75 - x => y < (75 - x)/2

So, in this case, the constraints on y are:

y < min(x, 76 - x, (75 - x)/2 )

But since x > -1, let's see for x > -1, what is the relationship between x, 76 - x, and (75 - x)/2.

Let me find where x = 76 - x: 2x = 76 => x = 38

x = (75 - x)/2: 2x = 75 - x => 3x = 75 => x = 25

So, depending on x, the min will change.

For x < 25, (75 - x)/2 is greater than x? Let's check x=0: (75)/2=37.5 > 0, yes. x=20: 55/2=27.5 >20. So, for x <25, min(x, 76 -x, (75 -x)/2 )=x, because x is less than (75 -x)/2 for x <25.

Wait, let me check at x=25: (75 -25)/2=25, which is equal to x=25.

So, for x <25, min is x.

For 25 <x <38: Let's take x=30. (75 -30)/2=22.5 <30, so min is 22.5.

So, for 25 <x <38, the min is (75 -x)/2.

For x>38: 76 -x is less than x? Let's check x=40: 76 -40=36 <40. So, yes. So, for x>38, 76 -x is less than x, so min is 76 -x.

So, in summary:

- For x <25: y <x
- For 25 <x <38: y < (75 -x)/2
- For x>38: y <76 -x

But also, remember x > -1.

So, the region is bounded by these lines and x > -1.

But since x + y <76 and x + 2y <75, and y <x.

I think this is a feasible region, but maybe a polygon.

But perhaps it's better to see if this region is convex.

But since it's bounded by linear inequalities, it should be convex.

Similarly, moving on to Case 2 from A and Case 1 from B:

1. \( x - y <0 \) (y >x)
2. \( x + y >76 \)
3. \( x + 2y >75 \)
4. \( x < -1 \)

Again, x < -1 and y >x. Then, x + y >76. But x is less than -1, so x + y >76 implies y >76 -x. Since x < -1, 76 -x >77, so y >77. But y >x, which is already satisfied as x < -1 and y >77. So, let's see if this region is possible.

So, x < -1, y >76 -x, y >x.

But since x < -1, 76 -x >77, which is way above, so the region is y >77, x < -1, and y >x. So, it's a region in the plane. But does it form a convex region?

Yes, as it's bounded by two lines y =76 -x and y =x, but since x < -1, the intersection of these would form a convex region.

But I need to check if this region is bounded or not. Since x can go to negative infinity, but given that z =75 -x -y, if x approaches negative infinity, z would approach positive infinity as well. But in 3D space, the plane is infinite, so this region might be unbounded.

Wait, but the problem mentions three disjoint convex regions. So, maybe each case corresponds to one region, but some are bounded and some are unbounded.

Wait, perhaps only one of them is bounded (finite area) and the others are unbounded. So, maybe this case leads to an unbounded region.

Similarly, Case 2 from A and Case 2 from B:

1. \( x - y <0 \) (y >x)
2. \( x + y <76 \)
3. \( x + 2y <75 \)
4. \( x > -1 \)

So, x > -1, y >x, x + y <76, and x + 2y <75.

Again, let's express y in terms of x.

From y >x,

From x + y <76: y <76 -x

From x + 2y <75: 2y <75 -x => y < (75 -x)/2

So, similar to the previous case, the constraints on y are:

y >x,

y < min(76 -x, (75 -x)/2 )

So, let's analyze this.

As before, for x <25: (75 -x)/2 is greater than x, so min is x, but y has to be greater than x, which conflicts with y <x. So, no solution for x <25.

For 25 <x <38: (75 -x)/2 <x, so min is (75 -x)/2.

So, y must be greater than x and less than (75 -x)/2.

But if x >25, is (75 -x)/2 greater than x?

Let me check x=30: (75 -30)/2=22.5 <30, so y must be >30 and <22.5, which is impossible. Therefore, no solution for 25 <x <38.

For x >38: 76 -x is less than x, so min is 76 -x.

So, y must be >x and <76 -x.

But for x >38, 76 -x <38 <x, so y must be >x and <76 -x, which is impossible because x >38 and 76 -x <38. So, no solution in this case.

Wait, so in this case, none of the subcases have a solution.

Wait, that can't be, maybe I made a mistake in reasoning.

Wait, for x >38, 76 -x <x, so y must be >x and <76 -x, but 76 -x <x, so no solution.

Similarly, for 25 <x <38, (75 -x)/2 <x, but y must be >x, which conflicts with y < (75 -x)/2.

So, the only possible region is when x <25, but in that case, y must be >x and <(75 -x)/2, but for x <25, (75 -x)/2 >x, so y is between x and (75 -x)/2.

But since x can go from -1 upwards, let's see:

When x approaches -1 from above, y must be >-1 and <(75 -(-1))/2=76/2=38.

So, y is between (-1 and 38). But also, y >x, which is y >-1.

Wait, but x >-1, so y must be greater than x which is greater than -1. So, in this region, x is between -1 and 25, y is between x and (75 -x)/2.

So, that's a bounded region. Because x is limited between -1 and 25, and y is limited above by (75 -x)/2 and below by x.

Therefore, this is a bounded convex region.

So, in total, we have regions from each case.

Wait, but in the Cases above:

Case 1 from A and Case 1 from B: no solution.

Case 1 from A and Case 2 from B: feasible region for x > -1.

Case 2 from A and Case 1 from B: feasible region for x < -1.

Case 2 from A and Case 2 from B: no solution.

So, in total, we have two feasible regions: one for x > -1 (Case 1A and Case 2B) and another for x < -1 (Case 2A and Case 1B).

Wait, but the problem statement mentions three disjoint convex regions. Hmm, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe the first case, when x + y >76 and x + 2y >75, and x < -1, is a feasible region?

Wait, earlier, when x < -1, and x + y >76, but x < -1, so y >76 -x, but x is negative, so 76 -x is greater than 76. So, y >76.

But in that case, since x < -1, y >76, and z =75 -x -y, which would be 75 - (x + y). Since x + y >76, z would be negative.

But in the plane, z can be any real number. So, perhaps that region is possible, but is it bounded?

Wait, x < -1, y >76, and z =75 -x -y. So, as x approaches -infinity, y approaches infinity as y >76 -x, so y would approach +infinity as x approaches -infinity. So, z =75 -x -y would approach 75 - (-infty) - infty, which is undefined. Hmm, not sure.

But in terms of the region, it's x < -1, y >76 -x, and y >x.

But since x < -1, y >76 -x >76 -(-1)=77.

So, the region is x < -1, y >77, and y >x (which is automatically satisfied because y >77 >x since x < -1).

So, this is a region in the plane, but it's unbounded because x can go to -infinity and y can go to +infinity. So, it's an unbounded region.

Similarly, the other case where x > -1, y <x, y < (75 -x)/2, y <76 -x.

Which is a bounded region.

So, in total, we have three regions:

1. x > -1, y < min(x, 76 -x, (75 -x)/2 )

Which is a bounded region.

2. x < -1, y >77

Which is unbounded.

3. x > -1, y between x and (75 -x)/2

Wait, actually, no, the other case was x > -1, y < min(x, 76 -x, (75 -x)/2 )

Wait, but in the earlier cases, we had:

When x > -1, y <x, but also y <76 -x and y <(75 -x)/2.

But for x >25, y is bounded above by (75 -x)/2.

So, actually, the regions are:

1. For x > -1:

   Sub-region 1a: y <x, y <76 -x, y <(75 -x)/2

   Sub-region 1b: y >x, y <76 -x, y <(75 -x)/2

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me try to think differently.

We have two inequalities:

1. (x - y)(76 - x - y) <0

   Which gives us either:

   - x - y <0 and 76 -x - y >0

   OR

   - x - y >0 and 76 -x - y <0

Similarly, for the second inequality.

But perhaps a better approach is to substitute u = x + y and v = x - y, to simplify the inequalities.

Let me try that.

Let u = x + y, v = x - y.

Then, z =75 - u.

So, first inequality:

(x - y)(76 - x - y) <0 => v*(76 - u) <0

Second inequality:

(y - z)(1 + x) <0.

Express y - z in terms of u and v:

y - z = y - (75 - u) = y -75 + u.

But u =x + y, so:

y -75 + u = y -75 +x + y =x + 2y -75.

But x = (v + y) (Wait, no.)

Wait, perhaps better to express y in terms of u and v.

Wait, u =x + y, v =x - y.

So, solving for x and y:

x = (u + v)/2

y = (u - v)/2

Thus, y - z = (u - v)/2 - z.

But z =75 -u, so:

y - z = (u - v)/2 - (75 - u) = (u - v)/2 -75 + u = (3u - v)/2 -75.

But the second inequality is (y - z)(1 + x) <0.

Expressed in terms of u and v:

[(3u - v)/2 -75] * (1 + (u + v)/2 ) <0

Simplify this expression.

First, compute (3u - v)/2 -75:

= (3u - v - 150)/2

Similarly, 1 + (u + v)/2:

= (2 + u + v)/2

So, the product is:

[(3u - v - 150)/2] * [(2 + u + v)/2] <0

Which simplifies to:

(3u - v - 150)(2 + u + v) <0

So, now, our two inequalities are:

1. v*(76 - u) <0

2. (3u - v -150)(2 + u + v) <0

So, now, we have:

Inequality 1: v*(76 - u) <0

Inequality 2: (3u - v -150)(2 + u + v) <0

So, perhaps this substitution makes it easier.

So, Inequality 1: v*(76 - u) <0

This implies either:

- v >0 and 76 - u <0 => v >0 and u >76

OR

- v <0 and 76 -u >0 => v <0 and u <76

Similarly, Inequality 2: (3u - v -150)(2 + u + v) <0

Which implies either:

- 3u - v -150 >0 and 2 + u + v <0

OR

- 3u - v -150 <0 and 2 + u + v >0

So, now, we can consider these four cases.

Case 1: v >0 and u >76

Case 2: v <0 and u <76

Case 3: 3u - v -150 >0 and 2 + u + v <0

Case 4: 3u - v -150 <0 and 2 + u + v >0

So, each case corresponds to a pair of inequalities. Let me analyze each case.

Case 1: v >0 and u >76

So, v >0, u >76

Inequality 2: (3u - v -150)(2 + u + v) <0

Compute each factor:

3u - v -150: Since u >76, 3u >228, so 3u -v -150 >228 -v -150=78 -v

But v >0, so 78 -v <78.

But v could be greater than 78, but we don't know.

Similarly, 2 + u + v: Since u >76, v >0, so 2 + u + v >76 +2 +0=78 >0

So, the second factor is positive.

First factor: 3u -v -150.

If u >76, 3u >228, so 3u -v -150 >228 -v -150=78 -v.

But since v >0, but we don't know if v >78 or not.

So, if v >78, then 3u -v -150 >78 -v, but 78 -v could be positive or negative.

Wait, actually, 3u -v -150=3u - (v +150). Since u >76, 3u >228. So, 3u - (v +150) >228 - (v +150)=78 -v.

But since v >0, but v can be up to any value.

Wait, maybe not useful.

Alternatively, let's consider that 3u - v -150 and 2 + u + v.

But 2 + u + v >0, as above.

So, for the product to be negative, (3u - v -150) must be negative.

So, 3u - v -150 <0 => v >3u -150

But in this case, u >76, so 3u -150 >228 -150=78.

But v >0, so for v >3u -150, but since u >76, 3u -150 >78, so v >78.

Therefore, in this case, we have:

v >0,

u >76,

and v >3u -150.

So, for u >76, and v >max(0, 3u -150)

But 3u -150 is greater than 0 when u >50. So, for u >76, 3u -150 >78.

So, so in this case, v >3u -150.

But 3u -150 is 3*(u) -150.

Given u >76, 3u -150 >78, so v >78.

So, so the region is:

u >76,

v >3u -150,

and v >0.

So, v >3u -150.

But 3u -150 is a line in the uv-plane.

Similarly, we can write the inequalities as:

u >76,

v >3u -150,

v >0.

This is a region in the uv-plane.

But since we are trying to find the area in 3D, we can perhaps compute the area in the uv-plane and map it back.

But before that, let's see if this region is bounded or not.

As u increases, v needs to be greater than 3u -150, which increases without bound, so v will go to infinity as u increases.

Therefore, this region is unbounded.

Similarly, let's check the other cases.

Case 2: v <0 and u <76

So, v <0,

u <76

Inequality 2: (3u -v -150)(2 + u + v) <0

Compute each factor:

3u -v -150: Since u <76, 3u <228, so 3u -v -150 <228 -v -150=78 -v

But v <0, so 78 -v >78.

So, 3u -v -150 <78 -v, but since v <0, 78 -v >78, so 3u -v -150 <78 -v.

But is this positive or negative?

Wait, 3u -v -150: Let me consider u <76, v <0.

Let me rewrite it as 3u -150 -v.

Since v <0, -v >0, so 3u -150 -v = (3u -150) + |v|

But 3u -150: Since u <76, 3u <228, so 3u -150 <78.

Thus, 3u -150 -v = (something less than 78) + something positive.

So, it's possible that 3u -v -150 is positive or negative.

Similarly, 2 + u + v: Since u <76, v <0, so 2 + u + v <76 +2 +0=78.

But since u can be as low as negative infinity (I think).

Wait, but in the plane, u =x + y can be any real number, so it's not necessarily bounded.

So, 2 + u + v is less than 78, but could be positive or negative.

But for the product (3u -v -150)(2 + u + v) <0,

Either:

- Both factors positive and negative, but since it's a product, one positive and one negative.

So, either:

- 3u -v -150 >0 and 2 + u + v <0

OR

- 3u -v -150 <0 and 2 + u + v >0

So, in Case 2, we have v <0 and u <76.

So, let's see the subcases.

Subcase 2a: 3u -v -150 >0 and 2 + u + v <0

So, 3u -v -150 >0 => v <3u -150

And 2 + u + v <0 => v < -2 -u

So, in this subcase, v must satisfy both:

v < min(3u -150, -2 -u )

But v <0.

So, let's see when 3u -150 < -2 -u.

Solve 3u -150 < -2 -u

3u + u <150 -2

4u <148

u <37

So, for u <37, 3u -150 < -2 -u

Thus, for u <37, the min is -2 -u

For u >=37, min is 3u -150.

But since in Case 2, u <76.

So, for u <37, v < -2 -u

For 37 <=u <76, v <3u -150

But also, v <0.

So, let me check:

For u <37:

v < min(3u -150, -2 -u ) = -2 -u

But v < -2 -u.

But since u <37, and v <0.

But -2 -u can be negative or positive depending on u.

Wait, for u <37:

If u < -2, then -2 -u >0.

If -2 <=u <37, then -2 -u <0.

So, for u < -2: -2 -u >0, so v < -2 -u, but v <0. So, v < min( -2 -u, 0 ). Since -2 -u >0, min is 0. So, v <0, but also v < -2 -u.

But since -2 -u >0, v must be less than a positive number but also less than 0, so it's automatically satisfied as v <0.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, no:

Wait, when u <37:

If u < -2, then -2 -u >0, so v must be less than both -2 -u and 0.

But since v <0, the condition is v < min(-2 -u, 0). But since -2 -u >0, min is 0. So, v <0.

But also, in Subcase 2a, which is part of Case 2, which is v <0 and u <76.

So, for u < -2, v <0.

But then, the condition is automatically satisfied as v <0.

Wait, but we have to also have v < -2 -u.

But if u < -2, then -2 -u >0, so v < -2 -u is more restrictive than v <0.

But v < -2 -u is only possible if -2 -u > v and v <0.

But since u < -2, -2 -u = (-u) -2, which is positive.

So, for u < -2, v must be less than (-u) -2.

But also, v <0.

So, the region is:

u < -2,

v < (-u) -2

and v <0.

Which is a region in the uv-plane.

But let's check if this is bounded.

As u approaches negative infinity, (-u) -2 approaches positive infinity, so v can go to negative infinity.

So, this region is unbounded.

Similarly, for u between -2 and 37:

-2 <=u <37,

So, -2 -u <=0,

So, in Subcase 2a, v must be less than min(3u -150, -2 -u )

Since u <37, 3u -150 < -2 -u

So, min is -2 -u

But for u >= -2, -2 -u <=0

So, v < -2 -u

But also, v <0.

So, for u in [-2,37), v < min(-2 -u, 0 )= -2 -u

Thus, the region is:

-2 <=u <37,

v < -2 -u

and v <0.

But for u in [-2,37), -2 -u varies from -2 -(-2)=0 to -2 -37= -39.

So, for u in [-2,37), -2 -u is in (-39, 0].

So, v < -2 -u, which is a line with negative slope.

Thus, for each u in [-2,37), v is below the line v = -2 -u, which is a straight line from (u=-2, v=0) to (u=37, v=-39).

So, this is a bounded region.

Wait, because u is between -2 and37, and for each u, v is less than a linear function, so the region is a triangle bounded by u=-2, v=-2 -u, and v=0.

Yes, that's a triangle.

So, that region is bounded.

Similarly, for u >=37 and u <76:

In Subcase 2a, v <3u -150

But since v <0, and 3u -150 is positive when u >50.

So, for u in [37,50):

3u -150 is negative, so v <3u -150 is automatically satisfied because v <0.

But we also have v < -2 -u.

But for u in [37,50):

-2 -u is negative (since u >=37), so v < min(3u -150, -2 -u )

But 3u -150 is negative for u <50, and -2 -u is also negative.

Which is more restrictive?

Compare 3u -150 and -2 -u.

Set 3u -150 < -2 -u

So, 4u <148 => u <37

But in this case, u >=37, so 3u -150 >=-2 -u.

Thus, min is -2 -u.

So, for u in [37,50), v < -2 -u.

But u >=37, so -2 -u <= -2 -37= -39.

Thus, for u in [37,50), v < -2 -u.

But since v <0, this is a bounded region, because u is between37 and50, and v is below the line v = -2 -u.

So, this is a trapezoid or triangle.

Similarly, for u in [50,76):

3u -150 is positive, so since in Subcase 2a, v <3u -150.

But v <0, so v <min(3u -150,0)=0.

So, for u in [50,76), v <0.

But since u is variable, and v is unrestricted except v <0, but also in this case, v < -2 -u.

Wait, no, in Subcase 2a, for u >=37, v <3u -150 or v < -2 -u, whichever is lower.

But for u >=50, 3u -150 >=0, so min is -2 -u.

But for u >=50, -2 -u <=-52.

So, v < -2 -u.

But since u >=50, v < -2 -u, which is negative, so for each u >=50, v is less than a negative number.

So, this is a bounded region, as u is between50 and76, and v is below a line.

So, overall, in Subcase 2a, which is in Case 2 (v <0, u <76), we have:

- For u < -2, v < -u -2

- For -2 <=u <50, v < -2 -u

- For 50 <=u <76, v < -2 -u

Thus, the region is a polygon bounded by u=-2, u=76, v=0, and v=-2 -u.

Wait, actually, it's a polygon with vertices at (-2,0), (50,-52), (76,-78), but wait, but when u=76, v=-2 -76=-78.

But in Subcase 2a, u <76, so it approaches u=76 but doesn't include it.

So, it's an open region approaching u=76.

But, in any case, the region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (-2,0), (76, -78), but actually, it's unbounded towards negative infinity for u.

Wait, no, when u approaches negative infinity, v is less than -u -2, so v approaches positive infinity, but v is supposed to be less than that. Wait, no, v is less than -u -2, so as u approaches negative infinity, -u -2 approaches positive infinity, so v is less than a large positive number, but v is also less than 0, so actually, v can go to negative infinity.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

But perhaps I should compute the area in the uv-plane for each case.

But, actually, in Case 2, Subcase 2a, the region is bounded below by v approaching negative infinity if u is less than -2, but actually, no, since for u < -2, v < -u -2, which is positive, but v must also be less than0.

Wait, no, for u < -2, v < -u -2, which is positive, but v <0, so the condition is v <0.

So, in this region, for u < -2, v can go from negative infinity up to 0, but also v < -u -2.

But since -u -2 is positive, the upper bound is less restrictive than v <0.

Wait, so for u < -2, the region is v <0, but v is also bounded above by -u -2, which is positive.

But since we are looking for v < min( -u -2, 0 ), which is 0, so the region is v <0 for u < -2.

Which is unbounded.

So, in total, Subcase 2a is unbounded.

Subcase 2b: 3u -v -150 <0 and 2 + u + v >0

So, 3u -v -150 <0 => v >3u -150

And 2 + u + v >0 => v >-2 -u

So, in Subcase 2b, v must satisfy v > max(3u -150, -2 -u )

But v <0 as per Case 2.

So, the region is where v > max(3u -150, -2 -u ) and v <0.

So, let's analyze when max(3u -150, -2 -u ) is less than0.

Which is when both 3u -150 <0 and -2 -u <0.

So, 3u -150 <0 => u <50

And -2 -u <0 => u >-2

So, for u in (-2,50), max(3u -150, -2 -u ) is:

- For u in (-2,37): max(3u -150, -2 -u )= -2 -u

- For u in [37,50): max(3u -150, -2 -u )=3u -150

At u=37, both are equal to 3*37 -150=111 -150=-39 and -2 -37=-39

So, for u in (-2,37): v > -2 -u

For u in [37,50): v >3u -150

And since v <0, the region is:

For u in (-2,37):

-2 -u <v <0

For u in [37,50):

3u -150 <v <0

So, this is a bounded region.

Because u is between -2 and50, and for each u, v is between two lines.

Specifically, for u in (-2,37), it's between v=-2 -u and v=0, forming a trapezoid.

For u in [37,50), it's between v=3u -150 and v=0, forming another trapezoid.

So, the total region is a polygon with vertices at (-2,0), (50,0), and (37, -39).

Wait, let me see:

At u=-2, v=-2 -(-2)=0, but v <0, so it's approaching ( -2,0 )

At u=37, v=3*37 -150= -39

At u=50, v=3*50 -150=0, but v <0, so approaching (50,0 )

So, the region is a quadrilateral bounded by:

- u=-2, v= -2 -u (from u=-2 to37)

- u=37, v=3u -150 (from u=37 to50)

- u=50, v=0

But actually, it's a polygon with vertices at (-2,0), (50,0), (37,-39), and back to (-2,0). Wait, but the path is not closed.

Wait, actually, it's a triangular region with vertices at (-2,0), (50,0), and (37,-39)

But because for u from -2 to37, the boundary is v=-2 -u, and for u from37 to50, the boundary is v=3u -150.

So, connecting these, it's a polygon with three vertices: (-2,0), (50,0), and (37,-39). But when u=50, v=0, but v must be <0, so it's open at (50,0).

Similarly, at u=-2, v=0, but it's open.

So, it's a triangle with vertices at (-2,0), (50,0), and (37,-39), but excluding the points themselves.

So, that's a bounded region.

So, in total, Case 2 has two subcases:

Subcase 2a: Unbounded region

Subcase 2b: Bounded region (triangle)

So, only Subcase 2b is bounded.

Case 3: 3u - v -150 >0 and 2 + u + v <0

So, 3u -v -150 >0 => v <3u -150

And 2 + u + v <0 => v < -2 -u

So, in this case, v must satisfy both v <3u -150 and v < -2 -u.

So, v < min(3u -150, -2 -u )

But also, in Case 3, v <0 and u <76.

So, let's see when min(3u -150, -2 -u ) is negative.

So, 3u -150 <0 => u <50

And -2 -u <0 => u >-2

So, for u in (-2,50):

min(3u -150, -2 -u )=3u -150 if u <37

And -2 -u if u >=37.

But since we have v < min(...), which is:

For u in (-2,37): v <3u -150

But 3u -150 <0, so v <3u -150 is more restrictive than v <0.

But v must also be less than -2 -u.

Wait, no:

Wait, in Case 3, both conditions must hold:

v <3u -150 and v < -2 -u

So, v < min(3u -150, -2 -u )

But for u in (-2,37):

min(3u -150, -2 -u )=3u -150

Because 3u -150 < -2 -u for u <37.

So, for u in (-2,37):

v <3u -150

But 3u -150 <0, so v <3u -150 <0.

Therefore, the region is:

u in (-2,37),

v <3u -150

But 3u -150 is negative, so v must be less than a negative number.

So, this is a bounded region.

Similarly, for u in [37,50):

min(3u -150, -2 -u )= -2 -u

So, v < -2 -u

Which is a bounded region as u is between37 and50.

And for u >=50, 3u -150 >=0, so min(3u -150, -2 -u )= -2 -u

But for u >=50, 3u -150 >=0, so v < -2 -u is a negative number.

But u can be up to76, so:

For u in [50,76):

v < -2 -u

Which is a bounded region.

So, overall, in Case 3, we have:

- For u in (-2,37): v <3u -150 (bounded)

- For u in [37,50): v < -2 -u (bounded)

- For u in [50,76): v < -2 -u (bounded)

But wait, for u in [50,76), v < -2 -u, which is bounded.

But for u approaching76, v approaches -78.

But in total, the region is bounded because u is limited to (-2,76) and v is bounded above by certain lines.

So, actually, all regions in Case 3 are bounded.

Specifically, let's analyze:

For u in (-2,37):

v <3u -150

But 3u -150 <0, so v is bounded below by -infty and above by 3u -150.

But this is a region between u=-2 to37, v approaching from below.

But since u is limited to (-2,37), and v is unbounded below, but in the plane, it's a region extending to negative infinity.

Wait, no, because in the substitution, z is defined as75 -u.

But in terms of area, it's a 2D region, so we might have to consider both u and v.

But for the area to be finite, the region must be bounded.

In Case3:

Subcase3a: u in (-2,37), v <3u -150

This is a region bounded on the left by u=-2, on the right by u=37, and below by v=3u -150.

But as u approaches37, v approaches3*37 -150= -39.

But v can go to negative infinity as u approaches lower bounds.

Wait, no, for u in (-2,37), v <3u -150.

But 3u -150 for u in (-2,37):

At u=-2: 3*(-2)-150=-6-150=-156

At u=37: 3*37 -150= -39

So, as u increases from -2 to37, 3u -150 increases from -156 to -39.

So, the region is bounded on the left by u=-2, on the right by u=37, and above by v=3u -150, but since it's v <3u -150, it's below that line.

But in terms of area, it's a trapezoid with vertices at (-2, -156), (37, -39), and approaching infinity.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, for each u in (-2,37), v can go from negative infinity up to3u -150.

So, in the uv-plane, it's a region under the line v=3u -150 for u between -2 and37.

But since v can go to negative infinity, it's an unbounded region.

Similarly, for u in [37,50), v < -2 -u, which is a line with negative slope.

So, for u in [37,50), v is below the line v= -2 -u.

So, this is a bounded region because u is limited and v is bounded above.

Similarly, for u in [50,76), v < -2 -u, which is a line with negative slope, so the region is bounded.

But for u in (-2,37), v <3u -150 is an unbounded region.

So, only parts of Case3 are bounded.

Specifically:

Subcase3b: u in [37,76), v < -2 -u

And Subcase3c: u in [50,76), v < -2 -u

Wait, actually, for u in [37,76), v < -2 -u is a bounded region.

Similarly, for u in [50,76), v < -2 -u is also bounded.

But for u in [37,50), v < -2 -u is same as u in [37,76).

So, actually, in total, the bounded regions in Case3 are:

- For u in [37,50): v < -2 -u, bounded

- For u in [50,76): v < -2 -u, bounded

And for u in (-2,37): v <3u -150, unbounded.

Thus, in total, in Case3, there are two bounded regions and one unbounded region.

Case4: 3u -v -150 <0 and 2 + u + v >0

So, 3u -v -150 <0 => v >3u -150

And 2 + u + v >0 => v >-2 -u

So, in Case4, v must satisfy v > max(3u -150, -2 -u )

But since in Case4, v >0 and u <76.

So, let's analyze when max(3u -150, -2 -u ) is greater than0.

Which is when both 3u -150 >0 and -2 -u >0.

3u -150 >0 => u >50

And -2 -u >0 => u < -2

But u cannot be both >50 and < -2.

So, there is no overlap where both are positive.

Thus, max(3u -150, -2 -u ) is positive only when u >50 or u < -2.

But for u in (-2,50), max(3u -150, -2 -u ) is:

- For u in (-2,37): max= -2 -u

- For u in [37,50): max=3u -150

So, in Case4, v must be greater than max(...), which is:

For u in (-2,37): v > -2 -u

But in Case4, v >0, so v > max(-2 -u,0 )

Similarly, for u in [37,50): v >3u -150, but v must also be >0.

But 3u -150 in [37,50): 3*37 -150= -39 to 3*50 -150=0

So, for u in [37,50), 3u -150 is negative up to u=50.

Wait, at u=50, 3*50 -150=0.

So, for u in [37,50), 3u -150 is negative, so v >3u -150 is automatically satisfied since v >0.

So, in this case, v >0.

But also, in Case4, v must be > max(3u -150, -2 -u ), which is:

For u in (-2,37): v > -2 -u

But in Case4, v >0, so v > max(-2 -u,0 )

Similarly, for u in [37,50): v >0

For u in [50,76): 3u -150 is positive, so v >3u -150

But v must also be >-2 -u, but since u >=50, -2 -u <=-52, so v >3u -150 is the main condition.

So, in summary:

Case4:

- For u in (-2,37): v > max(-2 -u,0 )

- For u in [37,50): v >0

- For u in [50,76): v >3u -150

So, let's analyze each interval.

Subcase4a: u in (-2,37)

So, v > max(-2 -u,0 )

Which is:

- For u in (-2,37):

If -2 -u >0 => u < -2: But u >= -2, so -2 -u <=0

Thus, max(-2 -u,0 )=0

Therefore, v >0

But in Case4, v >0 and u <76.

So, for u in (-2,37), v >0.

So, the region is u in (-2,37), v >0.

Which is an unbounded region.

Subcase4b: u in [37,50)

v >0

So, u in [37,50), v >0.

Which is also an unbounded region.

Subcase4c: u in [50,76)

v >3u -150

But 3u -150 is increasing from0 to78 as u goes from50 to76.

So, for u in [50,76), v >3u -150.

So, this is a bounded region because u is limited and v is bounded below.

Therefore, in total, in Case4:

- Subcases4a and4b: unbounded regions

- Subcase4c: bounded region

So, in conclusion, in all four cases:

- Case1: unbounded

- Case2: bounded in Subcase2b

- Case3: bounded in Subcases3b and3c

- Case4: bounded in Subcase4c

Wait, but in Case3 and Case4, some regions are bounded.

But in the problem statement, it's said that there are three disjoint convex regions with finite area. So, perhaps each of these bounded regions is one of them.

But let me check the bounded regions.

From the above analysis:

- In Case2, Subcase2b: a triangle with vertices at (-2,0), (50,0), (37,-39)

- In Case3, Subcases3b and3c: For u in [37,50), v < -2 -u, and for u in [50,76), v < -2 -u

But wait, actually, in Case3, for u in [37,50), v < -2 -u, which is a bounded region.

Similarly, for u in [50,76), v < -2 -u, which is a bounded region.

But these are two separate bounded regions?

Wait, no, for u in [37,50), v < -2 -u is a bounded region, and for u in [50,76), v < -2 -u is another bounded region.

So, actually, in Case3, we have two bounded regions.

Similarly, in Case4, Subcase4c: for u in [50,76), v >3u -150, another bounded region.

Wait, so in total, we have:

- From Case2, Subcase2b: 1 bounded region

- From Case3, Subcases3b and3c: 2 bounded regions

- From Case4, Subcase4c: 1 bounded region

But the problem states there are three disjoint convex regions with finite area.

So, likely, each case contributes one region, but some overlap.

Wait, perhaps the three regions are:

1. From Case2: triangle with vertices (-2,0), (50,0), (37,-39)

2. From Case3: region for u in [37,50), v < -2 -u

3. From Case4: region for u in [50,76), v >3u -150

But need to check if these are convex and disjoint.

But actually, let's think in terms of the original inequalities.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parameterize the original inequalities.

But that might be too time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to analyze the feasible region in terms of x, y, z, but given the time I've spent, I think the finite regions are:

1. The triangle from Case2: with area.

2. The regions from Case3 and Case4.

But to compute the area, perhaps the triangle is one finite region, and the other two are infinite, but the problem states three finite regions.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, in the uv-plane, in Case3, for u in [37,50), v < -2 -u, which is a bounded region.

Similarly, in Case4, for u in [50,76), v >3u -150, which is also bounded.

So, these are two bounded regions, and in Case2, Subcase2b is another bounded region.

Thus, total three bounded regions.

So, each of these is a convex region with finite area.

So, we need to compute the area of each and then find which one is finite.

Wait, no, actually, only the regions that are bounded will have finite area.

So, the problem says there are three disjoint convex regions with finite area. So, each of these three bounded regions is finite.

But the problem asks for the area of the finite region, so perhaps each of them is finite, but they might have different areas, and perhaps only one is minimal or something.

Wait, no, the problem states that there are three disjoint convex regions with finite area, and exactly one of those regions has finite area. Wait, no, no, the problem says: "exactly one of those regions has finite area."

Wait, the original problem says:

"the set of points in 3-dimensional coordinate space that lie in the plane \( x + y + z = 75 \) whose coordinates satisfy the inequalities \( x - yz < y - zx < z - xy \) forms three disjoint convex regions. Exactly one of those regions has finite area."

So, exactly one region has finite area, the other two are unbounded.

But in our analysis, we found three bounded regions and one unbounded, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine.

Wait, in Case1: u >76, v < min(x,76 -x)

Which is unbounded

Case2: Subcase2b: bounded

Case3: two bounded regions

Case4: Subcase4c: bounded

But the problem states three disjoint convex regions with finite area. So, likely, in my analysis, two of the regions are bounded, but in fact, perhaps only one is bounded.

Wait, maybe the regions from Case3 and Case4 are actually the same or overlapping.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should approach the problem differently.

Let me note that in the plane \( x + y + z =75 \), the inequalities can be rewritten in terms of x, y, z.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the symmetry of the problem.

Wait, the inequalities are:

1. \( x - yz < y - zx \)

2. \( y - zx < z - xy \)

Which can be rewritten as:

1. \( x - y < yz - zx \)

2. \( y - z < zx - xy \)

Factorizing:

1. \( (x - y) < z(y - x) \)

2. \( (y - z) < x(z - y) \)

So, 1: \( (x - y)(1 + z) <0 \)

2: \( (y - z)(1 + x) <0 \)

So, since \( x + y + z =75 \), none of x, y, z can be too large or too small, but the expressions 1 + z and 1 + x can be positive or negative.

But perhaps, assuming that 1 + z and 1 + x are positive, so that the inequalities simplify.

But maybe not. Alternatively, we can have cases where 1 + z is positive or negative, same with 1 + x.

But let's suppose that 1 + z >0 and 1 + x >0.

Then, inequality1: \( x - y < z(y - x) \)

Inequality2: \( y - z < x(z - y) \)

Which can be written as:

1: \( x - y < z(y - x) \)

2: \( y - z < x(z - y) \)

So, 1: \( x - y + z(y - x) <0 \)

2: \( y - z + x(z - y) <0 \)

Which are the same as:

1: \( (x - y)(1 - z) <0 \)

2: \( (y - z)(1 - x) <0 \)

Wait, that's a different factorization.

Wait, let's check:

1: \( x - y < z(y - x) \)

Bring all terms to left:

\( x - y - z(y - x) <0 \)

Factor:

\( x - y - zy + zx <0 \)

\( x + zx - y - zy <0 \)

\( x(1 + z) - y(1 + z) <0 \)

\( (x - y)(1 + z) <0 \)

Similarly, for inequality2:

\( y - z < x(z - y) \)

Bring all terms to left:

\( y - z - x(z - y) <0 \)

Factor:

\( y - z - xz + xy <0 \)

\( y + xy - z - xz <0 \)

\( y(1 + x) - z(1 + x) <0 \)

\( (y - z)(1 + x) <0 \)

So, same as before.

Therefore, our earlier factorization holds.

So, we have:

1. \( (x - y)(1 + z) <0 \)

2. \( (y - z)(1 + x) <0 \)

So, considering the plane \( x + y + z =75 \), which is a plane in 3D space.

Let me define variables a =x - y, b = y - z.

Then, the inequalities become:

1. \( a(1 + z) <0 \)

2. \( b(1 + x) <0 \)

But since a = x - y, b = y - z.

But perhaps this substitution isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use barycentric coordinates or something, but that might complicate.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that on the plane \( x + y + z =75 \), we can set one variable as 75 -x - y, and express z in terms of x and y.

So, z =75 -x - y.

Thus, the inequalities can be expressed as:

1. \( x - y(75 -x - y) < y - x(75 -x - y) \)

2. \( y - x(75 -x - y) < (75 -x - y) - x y \)

So, let's simplify these inequalities.

First inequality:

1. \( x - y(75 -x - y) < y - x(75 -x - y) \)

Simplify left side:

\( x -75y +xy + y^2 \)

Simplify right side:

\( y -75x +x^2 +xy \)

So, inequality1:

\( x -75y +xy + y^2 < y -75x +x^2 +xy \)

Subtract y -75x +x^2 +xy from both sides:

\( x -75y +xy + y^2 - y +75x -x^2 -xy <0 \)

Simplify:

\( (x +75x) + (-75y - y) + (xy -xy) + y^2 -x^2 <0 \)

Which is:

\(76x -76y + y^2 -x^2 <0\)

Factor:

\( -x^2 +76x + y^2 -76y <0 \)

Multiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality):

\(x^2 -76x - y^2 +76y >0\)

Factor:

\(x^2 - y^2 -76x +76y >0\)

Factor:

\((x - y)(x + y) -76(x - y) >0\)

Factor out (x - y):

\((x - y)(x + y -76) >0\)

So, inequality1 simplifies to:

\((x - y)(x + y -76) >0\)

Similarly, let's simplify inequality2.

Inequality2:

\( y - x(75 -x - y) < (75 -x - y) - x y \)

Simplify left side:

\( y -75x +x^2 +xy \)

Simplify right side:

\(75 -x - y -xy \)

So, inequality2:

\( y -75x +x^2 +xy <75 -x - y -xy \)

Bring all terms to left side:

\( y -75x +x^2 +xy -75 +x + y +xy <0 \)

Simplify:

\( (y + y) + (-75x +x) + (xy +xy) +x^2 -75 <0 \)

Which is:

\(2y -74x +2xy +x^2 -75 <0 \)

Factor:

\(x^2 -74x +2xy +2y -75 <0\)

Hmm, seems complicated. Maybe factor differently.

Wait, let's rearrange:

\(x^2 +2xy -74x +2y -75 <0\)

Perhaps group terms:

\(x^2 +2xy + y^2 - y^2 -74x +2y -75 <0\)

But that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps factor:

But it's complicated. Let me see if it can be written as a quadratic in x:

\(x^2 + (2y -74)x + (2y -75) <0\)

Yes, it's quadratic in x.

So, for each y, the expression is a quadratic in x:

\(x^2 + (2y -74)x + (2y -75) <0\)

The quadratic in x will be less than0 between its two roots, if it has real roots.

Compute discriminant:

Discriminant D = (2y -74)^2 -4*1*(2y -75)

= 4y^2 - 296y + 5476 -8y +300

=4y^2 -304y +5776

Let me compute sqrt(D):

sqrt(4y^2 -304y +5776)

Factor 4: 4(y^2 -76y +1444)

Check if y^2 -76y +1444 is a square:

Compute discriminant: 76^2 -4*1*1444 =5776 -5776=0

So, it's a perfect square: (y -38)^2

Thus, sqrt(D)=sqrt(4(y -38)^2 )=2|y -38|

Assuming y is real, sqrt(D)=2|y -38|

So, the roots are:

x = [ - (2y -74) ±2|y -38| ] /2

= [ -2y +74 ±2|y -38| ] /2

= (-2y +74)/2 ± |y -38|

= (-y +37) ± |y -38|

So, depending on whether y >=38 or y <38.

Case A: y >=38

Then |y -38|=y -38

So, roots:

x1 = (-y +37) + (y -38)= (-y +37 +y -38)= -1

x2 = (-y +37) - (y -38)= -y +37 -y +38= -2y +75

So, for y >=38, quadratic in x is <0 between x=-1 and x=-2y +75.

But since x + y + z =75, and z=75 -x -y, we need x, y, z real numbers.

But x can be negative?

Wait, in the original problem, the coordinates are real numbers, so x, y, z can be negative.

But in the inequalities, we have expressions like x - yz, but z can be negative.

So, x can be any real number, positive or negative.

So, for y >=38, the inequality in x is satisfied for x between -1 and -2y +75.

Case B: y <38

Then |y -38|=38 - y

So, roots:

x1 = (-y +37) + (38 - y)= -y +37 +38 -y= -2y +75

x2 = (-y +37) - (38 - y)= -y +37 -38 +y= -1

So, for y <38, quadratic in x is <0 between x=-2y +75 and x=-1.

But considering x must be real, but also, in the original problem, the point lies on the plane x + y + z=75.

But since z=75 -x -y, and the inequalities involve products like yz, zx, etc., which can be positive or negative depending on the signs of y and z, x and z, etc.

So, perhaps, in the plane x + y + z=75, the regions where these inequalities hold depend on the signs of (x - y), (y - z), (1 + z), (1 +x), etc.

But this is getting too abstract.

Wait, but from our earlier analysis in the uv-plane, there are three bounded regions:

1. Triangle with vertices (-2,0), (50,0), (37,-39)

2. Region in Case3, Subcase3b: u in [37,50), v < -2 -u

3. Region in Case4, Subcase4c: u in [50,76), v >3u -150

Each of these is a convex region with finite area.

But the problem says exactly one has finite area, but in our analysis, three regions are bounded, which have finite area.

Wait, maybe I was wrong in the initial substitution, and the regions are in the three variables x, y, z, but on the plane, so two variables.

But with three variables, the plane is two-dimensional, so each region is two-dimensional.

But in the uv substitution, it's in u and v, which are two variables.

So, perhaps each bounded region is a polygon with finite area.

In that case, the problem says "exactly one of those regions has finite area", but in our analysis, all three bounded regions have finite area.

Wait, perhaps in the uv-plane, the regions are triangles and other polygons, but in reality, on the plane x + y + z=75, the regions may have unbounded extent.

Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the finite region is the triangle in Case2, Subcase2b.

Let me compute its area.

From Case2, Subcase2b: u in (-2,37), v <3u -150

Wait, but in the uv-plane, the region is a triangle with vertices at (-2,0), (50,0), (37,-39)

So, the area can be computed via the shoelace formula.

Coordinates:

A(-2,0), B(50,0), C(37,-39)

Compute area:

Area = 0.5 * | (x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B)) |

Plugging in:

=0.5 * | (-2)(0 - (-39)) +50(-39 -0) +37(0 -0) |

=0.5 * | (-2)(39) +50(-39) +0 |

=0.5 * | -78 -1950 |

=0.5 * | -2028 |

=0.5 *2028=1014

So, the area is1014.

But the problem asks for the form a√b, so 1014 is 1014√1, which is not matching.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, in the uv-plane, the triangle has area1014, but in the original coordinates, perhaps the area is scaled.

Wait, but since we did a linear substitution u =x - y, v= y - z, which is a linear transformation.

The area scaling factor is the determinant of the Jacobian matrix.

Jacobian matrix:

[ du/dx du/dy du/dz ] = [1, -1, 0]

[ dv/dx dv/dy dv/dz ] = [0,1, -1]

Determinant:

|i j k|
|1 -1 0|
|0 1 -1|

= i*( (-1)(-1) -0*1 ) -j*(1*(-1) -0*0 ) +k*(1*1 - (-1)*0 )

= i*(1 -0) -j*(-1 -0) +k*(1 -0)

= i +j +k

Wait, determinant is 1 +1 +1=3.

Wait, no, the determinant is the scalar triple product, but for 2x2 Jacobian, the determinant is the determinant of the Jacobian matrix.

Wait, actually, in 3D, the Jacobian matrix for the transformation is:

[1, -1, 0]

[0, 1, -1]

So, determinant is calculated as:

1*(1*(-1) - (-1)*0) - (-1)*(0*(-1) - (-1)*0) +0*(0*1 -1*0)

=1*(-1 -0) - (-1)*(0 -0) +0*(0 -0)

= -1 -0 +0= -1

So, determinant is -1, so the absolute value is1.

Therefore, the area scales by |det|=1.

Thus, the area in the original coordinates is the same as in the uv-plane, which is1014.

But 1014 is 1014, which is 1014= 2*3*13*13, but 13*13=169, 169*6=1014.

So, 1014= 6*13²

Thus, 1014= 6*13², so sqrt(1014)=13√6

But wait, 1014= (13√6)^2=169*6=1014.

But the area is1014, which is a whole number, not in the form a√b.

But the problem says "the finite area of this region can be expressed in the form a√b", so perhaps 1014 is 1014√1, but that's trivial.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, maybe I need to compute the area in the original x, y, z coordinates.

But on the plane x + y + z=75, the area element is scaled by the area of the plane.

The area scaling factor when projecting from 3D to 2D is 1 / cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the plane and the coordinate system.

But in this case, since the plane is x + y + z=75, the normal vector is (1,1,1), so the angle theta between the normal and the z-axis is arccos(1/√3). So, the area scaling factor is 1 / sin(theta) = √3.

But wait, actually, the area element on the plane is dA = dx dy / sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the plane and the xy-plane.

But in our case, the plane is inclined, so the area is scaled by 1 / sin(theta).

But theta is the angle between the plane's normal and the z-axis, which is arccos(1/√3). So, sin(theta)=√(2/3). Thus, area scaling factor is 1 / sin(theta)=√(3/2)=√6 /2.

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the area element on the plane x + y + z=75 is given by dA = dx dy / |cos(theta)|, where theta is the angle between the normal and the z-axis.

So, cos(theta)=1/√3, so sin(theta)=√(2/3).

Thus, dA = dx dy / sin(theta)= dx dy / (√(2/3))= dx dy * √3 /√2= (√6 /2 ) dx dy.

Thus, the area in the plane is √6 /2 times the area in the xy-plane.

But in our substitution, we transformed to u and v, which is a linear transformation with determinant1, so the area in the uv-plane is preserved.

Thus, the area in the original plane is √6 /2 times the area in the uv-plane.

Wait, but in our case, the area in the uv-plane is1014, so the area in the original plane is1014 * √6 /2= 507√6.

Thus, a=507, b=6, so a+b=513.

But wait, before I get ahead of myself, let me verify.

First, the area in the uv-plane is1014, which is the area of the triangle with vertices at (-2,0), (50,0), (37,-39).

But when we map back to the original coordinates, each area element is scaled by √6 /2.

Thus, the actual area is1014 * √6 /2=507√6

So, a=507, b=6, a+b=513.

Wait, but let me confirm.

Alternatively, since in the uv-plane, the area is1014, but the plane x + y + z=75 is inclined, so the area in 3D is 1014 * √3.

Wait, no, my previous thought was that the scaling factor is √6 /2, but let me think.

The plane x + y + z=75 has a normal vector (1,1,1). The area scaling factor when projecting onto a coordinate plane is 1 / cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the normal and the normal to the coordinate plane.

For example, projecting onto the xy-plane, the scaling factor is 1 / cos(theta)=√3, since cos(theta)=1/√3.

Similarly, when computing the area on the plane, the area element dA is related to the area element in the xy-plane by dA= dx dy / sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the plane and the xy-plane.

Sin(theta)=√(2/3), so dA= dx dy / √(2/3)= dx dy * √3 /√2= (√6 /2) dx dy.

Thus, the area in the plane is scaled by √6 /2 from the xy-plane.

But in our substitution, we have u and v, which are linear combinations of x and y. So, the area in the uv-plane is equal to the area in the xy-plane because the determinant of the Jacobian is1.

Thus, the area in the plane x + y + z=75 is equal to the area in the uv-plane times √6 /2.

Wait, but no, that's not correct. Because u and v are linear combinations of x and y, so the area in the uv-plane is the same as in the xy-plane.

Wait, no, the Jacobian determinant is1, so the area is preserved between xy and uv.

But when you map from uv to the plane x + y + z=75, you have to consider the scaling due to the plane's inclination.

Therefore, the area in the plane is equal to the area in the uv-plane times √6 /2.

Wait, I think that's the correct scaling factor.

So, 1014 * √6 /2=507√6

Thus, the finite area is507√6, so a + b=507 +6=513.

But let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps the area in the plane is computed as follows:

Given a triangle in the uv-plane with area A, the area in the plane x + y + z=75 is A divided by sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the normal vector and the z-axis.

Wait, but that would be A / sin(theta)=A * √3.

But in our case, the area in the uv-plane is1014, so the area in the plane would be1014 * √3.

But 1014 * √3 is not in the form a√b, but 1014 is 1014, and √3 is irrational, but that's another form.

But the problem says "can be expressed in the form a√b", so if the area is507√6, then that's a single radical term.

Alternatively, perhaps I had a mistake in the scaling.

Wait, let me think differently.

If I have a triangle in the uv-plane with area1014, and since u =x - y, v = y - z, the transformation is linear with determinant1, so the area in the original plane is same as in the uv-plane.

But on the plane x + y + z=75, the area element is different.

Wait, perhaps we need to compute the area on the plane.

Given that the plane is x + y + z=75, which is a 2D surface in 3D space.

We can parametrize the plane.

Let me choose parameters u and v, such that:

x = u

y = v

z=75 - u - v

So, the parametrization is (u, v, 75 -u -v)

Then, the area element on the plane is given by the cross product of the partial derivatives.

The partial derivatives are:

r_u = (1,0,-1)

r_v = (0,1,-1)

Cross product:

r_u × r_v = |i j k; 1 0 -1; 0 1 -1|

= i*(0*(-1) - (-1)*1) -j*(1*(-1) - (-1)*0) +k*(1*1 -0*0)

= i*(0 +1) -j*(-1 -0) +k*(1 -0)

= (1,1,1)

The magnitude is√(1 +1 +1)=√3

Thus, the area element on the plane is√3 du dv

Therefore, the area in the plane is√3 times the area in the uv-plane.

Therefore, if in the uv-plane, the triangle has area1014, then on the plane, it's1014 *√3.

But1014 *√3 can be written as a√b where a=1014, b=3.

But the problem says "the finite area of this region can be expressed in the form a√b", so it's 1014√3, so a=1014, b=3, a+b=1017.

But wait, that contradicts the earlier idea of scaling by √6 /2.

Wait, perhaps I confused scaling.

Wait, the area element on the plane is√3 times the area in the uv-plane.

Thus, the actual area is1014 *√3, which is1014√3, so a=1014, b=3, a + b=1017.

But let me confirm.

Yes, since the parametrization has cross product magnitude√3, so area scales by√3.

Therefore, the area is1014 *√3.

Thus, the answer is1014 +3=1017.

But wait, in the initial step, we thought the area in uv-plane is1014, which is a triangle, and on the plane, it's scaled by√3, giving1014√3.

Alternatively, if I need to compute the area of the triangle in the plane.

The triangle has vertices at:

A: (-2,0,75 - (-2) -0)= (-2,0,77)

B: (50,0,75 -50 -0)= (50,0,25)

C: (37,-39,75 -37 -(-39))= (37,-39,75 -37 +39)= (37,-39,77)

Thus, triangle ABC with coordinates:

A(-2,0,77)

B(50,0,25)

C(37,-39,77)

Compute the area using vectors.

Compute vectors AB and AC.

AB = B - A = (50 - (-2), 0 -0,25 -77)= (52,0,-52)

AC = C - A = (37 - (-2), -39 -0,77 -77)= (39,-39,0)

Compute cross product AB × AC:

|i j k;52 0 -52;39 -39 0|

= i*(0*0 - (-52)*(-39)) -j*(52*0 - (-52)*39) +k*(52*(-39) -0*39)

= i*(0 -2028) -j*(0 - (-2028)) +k*(-2028 -0)

= (-2028, -2028, -2028)

Magnitude=√[(-2028)^2 + (-2028)^2 + (-2028)^2] =√[3*(2028)^2]=2028√3

Area=0.5*2028√3=1014√3

So, the area is1014√3, which is in the form a√b, with a=1014, b=3, so a +b=1017.

Therefore, the answer is1017.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1017}
</think>

Given the problem of finding the finite area of a region defined by the inequalities \( x - yz < y - zx < z - xy \) on the plane \( x + y + z = 75 \), we start by analyzing the inequalities and transforming them into a more manageable form.

First, we rewrite the inequalities:
1. \( x - yz < y - zx \)
2. \( y - zx < z - xy \)

By factoring and simplifying these inequalities, we get:
1. \( (x - y)(1 + z) < 0 \)
2. \( (y - z)(1 + x) < 0 \)

We introduce new variables \( u = x - y \) and \( v = y - z \), transforming the plane equation into \( x + y + z = 75 \) and the inequalities into:
1. \( u(1 + z) < 0 \)
2. \( v(1 + x) < 0 \)

We then analyze the regions defined by these inequalities in the \( u \)-\( v \) plane. After considering various cases and transformations, we find that the finite region is a triangle in the plane \( x + y + z = 75 \).

To find the area of this region, we parametrize the plane and compute the area element. The area element on the plane \( x + y + z = 75 \) is scaled by the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives, which is \( \sqrt{3} \).

The area of the triangle in the \( u \)-\( v \) plane is computed to be 1014. Scaling this area by \( \sqrt{3} \) gives the area on the plane \( x + y + z = 75 \) as \( 1014\sqrt{3} \).

Thus, the finite area can be expressed in the form \( a\sqrt{b} \) where \( a = 1014 \) and \( b = 3 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 1014 + 3 = 1017 \).

\[
\boxed{1017}
\]
