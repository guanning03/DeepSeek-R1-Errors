Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of ordered triples of positive integers (a, b, c) such that each of a, b, c is less than or equal to 3^6, and the sum of their cubes, a³ + b³ + c³, is divisible by 3^7. Then, I have to find the remainder when this number, N, is divided by 1000.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, 3^6 is 729, so a, b, c can each be any integer from 1 to 729. The condition is that a³ + b³ + c³ is divisible by 3^7, which is 2187. So, we're dealing with modulo 2187 here.

I remember that for problems involving divisibility by powers of primes, sometimes using modular arithmetic and considering the exponents can help. Since 3 is a prime, maybe I can use some properties related to that.

First, let me think about how cubes behave modulo powers of 3. Maybe I can consider the possible residues of a³ modulo 3^k for some k, and see how that helps.

I know that for any integer n, n³ modulo 3 can be either 0, 1, or -1 because:

- If n ≡ 0 mod 3, then n³ ≡ 0 mod 3.
- If n ≡ 1 mod 3, then n³ ≡ 1 mod 3.
- If n ≡ 2 mod 3, then n³ ≡ 8 ≡ 2 mod 3, which is the same as -1 mod 3.

But we're dealing with higher powers of 3 here, up to 3^7. So, I need to understand the behavior of a³ modulo 3^7.

I recall that lifting the exponent lemma (LTE) might be useful here, but I'm not sure exactly how to apply it yet. Maybe I should look into it.

Wait, LTE applies to specific cases, like when we have v_p(a^n - b^n), where v_p is the exponent of the highest power of prime p dividing the number. But here, we have a sum of cubes, so maybe it's not directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of Hensel's lemma, which is about lifting solutions modulo higher powers of primes. But again, not sure yet.

Maybe a better approach is to analyze the possible values of a³ modulo 3^7. Since a can be up to 3^6, but when considering modulo 3^7, each a can be written as 3^k * m, where m is not divisible by 3, and k can vary.

Wait, but 3^6 is less than 3^7, so a can be written as a = 3^k * m where m is 1, 2, or not divisible by 3, but k can range from 0 to 6.

But maybe even more precise: for each a, we can represent it in base 3, and then when we cube it, the coefficients might get affected in a particular way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expansion of a³ modulo 3^7. Let me try to compute a³ modulo 3^7.

Suppose a is written in base 3 as a = a₀ + a₁*3 + a₂*3² + a₃*3³ + a₄*3⁴ + a₅*3⁵ + a₆*3⁶, since a ≤ 3^6.

Then, a³ would be (a₀ + a₁*3 + ... + a₆*3⁶)³. Expanding this, the terms would involve multiples of powers of 3.

But maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, I remember that for numbers not divisible by 3, their cubes modulo 3^k can take on certain residues.

Wait, let me think about the possible residues of a³ modulo 3^7.

I know that if a is not divisible by 3, then a³ mod 3^7 can be more varied, but if a is divisible by 3, say a = 3b, then a³ = 27b³, so a³ is divisible by 3³, but perhaps higher powers depending on b.

Similarly, if a = 3^2 * b, then a³ = 3^6 * b³, which is divisible by 3^6, but not necessarily by 3^7 unless b is divisible by 3.

So, for a number a, if it's divisible by 3^k but not by 3^{k+1}, then a³ is divisible by 3^{3k}.

Therefore, if a is divisible by 3^k, a³ is divisible by 3^{3k}.

So, in our case, since a can be up to 3^6, the maximum k such that a is divisible by 3^k is k=6 (since 3^6 is the maximum a). Therefore, a³ is divisible by 3^{18}, but since 18 > 7, it's more than enough.

But wait, 3^7 is 2187, and a³ can be as big as (3^6)^3 = 3^18, which is way larger, but modulo 3^7, we only care about the remainder.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem using the concept of modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 3^7, and consider the number of solutions to a³ + b³ + c³ ≡ 0 mod 3^7.

To compute this, maybe I can use generating functions or something similar, but considering that the modulus is a prime power, perhaps the number of solutions can be expressed as a product over each modulus.

Wait, but it's not straightforward. Maybe I can find the number of solutions modulo 3^7 by building up from lower powers.

I remember that sometimes, for equations modulo prime powers, you can use recursion or induction on the exponent, using solutions modulo lower powers.

So, let me start by considering the equation modulo 3, then modulo 3², and so on, up to 3^7, keeping track of the number of solutions at each step.

Let me denote N(k) as the number of solutions (a, b, c) modulo 3^k such that a³ + b³ + c³ ≡ 0 mod 3^k.

Our goal is N(7). But since a, b, c are positive integers up to 3^6, which is less than 3^7, perhaps there is a relation between N(7) and the number of such triples.

Wait, but actually, when we consider modulo 3^7, we can have a, b, c each from 1 to 3^6, which is exactly the range we're considering. So, if I can compute N(7), that should be equal to the number of such triples.

But hold on, actually, when working modulo 3^7, the values are from 0 to 3^7 - 1, but our a, b, c are from 1 to 3^6, so they don't include 0. Hmm, does that affect the count?

Wait, maybe not, because when considering modulo 3^7, each residue from 1 to 3^6 is unique, except for 0. So, the number of triples (a, b, c) with a, b, c from 1 to 3^6 is (3^6)^3, which is 3^18.

But modulo 3^7, the number of solutions would be approximately the same, but adjusted for the fact that 0 is excluded. Hmm, but maybe we can relate N(7) to 3^{18} somehow.

Wait, actually, in the ring of integers modulo 3^7, the number of solutions to a³ + b³ + c³ ≡ 0 mod 3^7 is N(7). But our variables are restricted to 1 to 3^6, which is exactly the multiplicative group modulo 3^7, but not entirely—since 3^6 is less than 3^7, and some numbers are multiples of 3.

Wait, maybe I need to be careful here.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of thinking modulo 3^7, I can think about the exponents of 3 in a, b, c.

Let me denote for each variable, the exponent of 3 in its prime factorization. Let’s say for a, we have a = 3^{k_a} * m_a, where m_a is not divisible by 3. Similarly, b = 3^{k_b} * m_b, and c = 3^{k_c} * m_c.

Then, a³ = 3^{3k_a} * m_a³, and similarly for b³ and c³.

Therefore, the exponents of 3 in a³, b³, c³ are 3k_a, 3k_b, 3k_c respectively.

Now, when we add a³ + b³ + c³, the exponent of 3 in the sum will be the minimum of the exponents in each term, provided that the coefficients (the m's) modulo 3^{something} are non-zero.

Wait, actually, the exponent of 3 in a³ + b³ + c³ is the minimal exponent among 3k_a, 3k_b, 3k_c, provided that the sum of the coefficients (m_a³, m_b³, m_c³) is not divisible by a higher power of 3.

But in our case, we want a³ + b³ + c³ ≡ 0 mod 3^7. So, we need the exponent of 3 in a³ + b³ + c³ to be at least 7.

Therefore, the minimal exponent among 3k_a, 3k_b, 3k_c must be ≥7, or else the sum cannot have exponent ≥7.

But wait, if the minimal exponent is less than 7, then the sum can't have exponent ≥7 because the term with minimal exponent would dominate.

Therefore, for a³ + b³ + c³ to be divisible by 3^7, all of 3k_a, 3k_b, 3k_c must be ≥7. Because if even one of them is less than 7, then the sum will have exponent equal to the minimal one, which is less than 7, so the sum won't be divisible by 3^7.

Therefore, we must have that 3k_a ≥7, 3k_b ≥7, 3k_c ≥7.

Which implies that k_a ≥ ceil(7/3) = 3, similarly k_b ≥3, k_c ≥3.

Therefore, each of a, b, c must be divisible by 3³ = 27.

So, a, b, c must each be multiples of 27.

Therefore, we can write a = 27a', b = 27b', c = 27c', where a', b', c' are positive integers such that a', b', c' ≤ 3^6 / 27 = 3^6 / 3^3 = 3^3 = 27.

Therefore, a', b', c' can be from 1 to 27.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of ordered triples (a', b', c') with each from 1 to 27, such that (27a')³ + (27b')³ + (27c')³ is divisible by 3^7.

But let's compute (27a')³: 27³ * a'³ = 3^9 * a'³. Similarly for the others.

So, the sum is 3^9(a'³ + b'³ + c'³). We want this sum to be divisible by 3^7, which is equivalent to saying that a'³ + b'³ + c'³ must be divisible by 3^{-2}... Wait, no, modulo 3^7.

Wait, 3^9 is divisible by 3^7, so 3^9 * (a'³ + b'³ + c'³) is automatically divisible by 3^7, regardless of a', b', c'. So, actually, any triple (a', b', c') will make the sum divisible by 3^7.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, because 3^9 is divisible by 3^7, so 3^9 * something is divisible by 3^7. So, regardless of a', b', c', the sum will be divisible by 3^7. Therefore, all triples (a', b', c') with a', b', c' from 1 to 27 will satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the number of such triples is simply 27^3 = 19683.

But wait, hold on, let me verify that.

Wait, if a, b, c are multiples of 27, then a³ + b³ + c³ is a multiple of 3^9, which is certainly a multiple of 3^7. Therefore, regardless of a', b', c', the sum is divisible by 3^7.

Therefore, all a', b', c' in 1 to 27 will satisfy the condition. So, the number of such triples is 27^3 = 19683.

But wait, let's compute 27^3: 27*27=729, 729*27=19683, yes.

Therefore, N = 19683.

But wait, the problem says a, b, c are positive integers ≤3^6. Since 3^6 = 729, and 27*27=729, so a', b', c' can be up to 27, as above.

So, that suggests that all such triples, when scaled down by 27, result in a sum that is a multiple of 3^7.

Therefore, N=19683.

Wait, but 19683 is 27^3, which is (3^3)^3 = 3^9, which is 19683. So, 19683 divided by 1000 is 19 with remainder 683. So, the remainder is 683.

But hold on, that seems too straightforward. Did I miss something?

Wait, let me check my reasoning again.

I started by noting that a³ + b³ + c³ must be divisible by 3^7.

I considered the exponents of 3 in a, b, c, denoted as k_a, k_b, k_c.

Then, since a³ = 3^{3k_a} * m_a³, similarly for the others, the minimal exponent among 3k_a, 3k_b, 3k_c must be ≥7.

Thus, each k_a, k_b, k_c must be ≥3, because 3k ≥7 implies k ≥3 (since 3*3=9 ≥7). Therefore, a, b, c must be multiples of 27.

Hence, we can write a=27a', b=27b', c=27c', with a', b', c' ≤27.

Then, a³ + b³ + c³ = 3^9*(a'³ + b'³ + c'³). Since 3^9 is divisible by 3^7, the entire sum is divisible by 3^7 regardless of a', b', c'.

Therefore, all triples (a', b', c') with a', b', c' from 1 to 27 are acceptable, so the number of such triples is 27^3=19683.

Hence, N=19683.

But 19683 divided by 1000 is 19*1000=19000, 19683-19000=683, so remainder is 683.

But I feel like this is correct, but I have a doubt because it seems too straightforward.

Wait, let me think again. When we have a³ + b³ + c³ divisible by 3^7, and we found that if a, b, c are multiples of 27, then the sum is divisible by 3^9, hence divisible by 3^7.

But is the converse true? That is, are all solutions necessarily of the form a, b, c multiples of 27?

Wait, no, perhaps not. Suppose that a, b, c are not multiples of 27, but their cubes add up to a multiple of 3^7.

Is that possible?

For example, suppose that a is 1, b is 1, c is (something). Then, 1 + 1 + c³ ≡ 0 mod 3^7.

So, c³ ≡ -2 mod 3^7. Is that solvable?

I know that modulo 3, -2 ≡1 mod 3, and 1 is a cube residue modulo 3. But does that lift to higher powers?

Wait, Hensel's lemma says that if f(c) = c³ + 2 ≡0 mod 3^k, and f'(c) ≠0 mod 3, then there is a unique lift to mod 3^{k+1}.

So, starting from mod 3: c ≡1 mod 3.

Then, at mod 9: Let's suppose c =1 + 3t. Then, c³ =1 + 9t + 27t² + 27t³. So, c³ ≡1 + 0 + 0 + 0 ≡1 mod 9.

So, 1 + 2 ≡3 ≡0 mod 3, but mod 9, c³ + 2 ≡1 + 2=3≡3 mod9≠0.

So, no solution at mod 9.

Wait, so if I have c³ ≡ -2 mod 3^7, but mod9: c³ ≡-2≡1 mod9, but actually, c³ ≡1 mod9, which isn't equal to -2 mod9, which is 7.

Wait, but 1 ≡1 mod9, 8≡8 mod9, 0≡0, 2≡2, etc. So, 1≠7 mod9, so c³ ≡7 mod9 is not possible because in mod9, the cube residues are limited.

Wait, let me compute the cubes modulo 9:

0³=0,

1³=1,

2³=8,

3³=0,

4³=64≡1,

5³=125≡8,

6³=216≡0,

7³=343≡1,

8³=512≡8.

So, cube residues modulo9 are only 0,1,8.

Therefore, c³ ≡7 mod9 is impossible.

Thus, the equation c³ ≡-2 mod9 is impossible because -2 mod9=7, which is not a cube residue modulo9.

Therefore, the equation c³ ≡-2 mod9 has no solutions, hence c³ ≡-2 mod3^7 has no solutions.

Therefore, there are no triples where a, b, c are not multiples of 3, such that a³ + b³ + c³ ≡0 mod3^7.

Wait, but what if two of them are 1, and the third is something else?

Wait, let's suppose a=1, b=1, then c³ ≡-2 mod3^7.

But as above, this has no solution because c³≡7 mod9 is impossible.

Therefore, in general, the only way for a³ + b³ + c³ ≡0 mod3^7 is if all a, b, c are multiples of 27, because otherwise, their cubes can't add up to a multiple of 3^7.

Therefore, my initial reasoning was correct: all such triples must have a, b, c multiples of 27, which reduces the problem to counting triples (a', b', c') with a', b', c' from 1 to27, and the number of such triples is 27^3=19683.

Therefore, N=19683.

Then, the question is to find N mod1000, so 19683 divided by 1000 is 19*1000=19000, 19683-19000=683.

Hence, the remainder is 683.

But just to be thorough, let me check if N is indeed 19683.

Wait, each of a, b, c is a multiple of27, so let me write them as a=27a', b=27b', c=27c', where a', b', c' are integers from1 to27, since 27*27=729=3^6.

Therefore, a', b', c' can be 1,2,...,27. So, the number of triples is 27 choices for a', 27 for b', 27 for c', so total 27*27*27=27³=19683.

Therefore, N=19683.

Therefore, 19683 divided by1000 is 19 with remainder 683.

Thus, the answer is 683.

Wait, but before I finish, let me consider if there are any cases where a, b, c are not multiples of27, but their cubes still sum to a multiple of3^7.

But as we saw earlier, even for a single variable, equations like a³≡k mod3^7 have solutions only if k is a cube residue mod3^7.

But since, as we saw, at mod9, cube residues are 0,1,8, so any cube must be ≡0,1, or8 mod9.

Therefore, a³ + b³ + c³≡0 mod9 implies that the sum of three cube residues mod9 must be 0.

Possible combinations:

All three 0: 0+0+0=0.

Two 0s and one 0: same as above.

One 0, one1, one8: 0+1+8=9≡0 mod9.

Similarly, all three 1s: 1+1+1=3≡3≠0 mod9.

All three 8s: 8+8+8=24≡6≠0 mod9.

Two 1s and one8: 1+1+8=10≡1≠0 mod9.

Two8s and one1:8+8+1=17≡8≠0 mod9.

So, the only possibilities for the sum being 0 mod9 are either all three cubes≡0 mod9, or one cube≡0 mod9, one≡1 mod9, and one≡8 mod9.

Therefore, the sum a³ + b³ + c³≡0 mod9 can be achieved in two ways.

Now, in our case, we need a³ + b³ + c³≡0 mod3^7, which implies it must ≡0 mod9.

Therefore, either all a, b, c are multiples of3, or exactly one of them is multiple of3, another is ≡1 mod3, and the third is≡2 mod3.

Wait, but in our previous step, we had that a³ + b³ + c³≡0 mod3^7, which is a stronger condition.

But, in order to have a³ + b³ + c³≡0 mod3^7, we must have that a, b, c are multiples of3^3=27.

Because if any of them is not a multiple of27, then their cube is not ≡0 mod27, and so when we add them up, the total sum cannot be ≡0 mod27 unless each term is ≡0 mod27.

Wait, for instance, suppose that a is not a multiple of27, so a³≡m mod27, where m is 1, 8, or something else.

But 3^3=27, so mod27, the cube residues are?

Wait, let me compute the cubes mod27.

Compute n³ mod27 for n from0 to26.

But that's tedious, but maybe we can recall that for n coprime to 3, n³ ≡±1 mod9, but mod27, it's more complicated.

Wait, let me compute a few:

0³=0

1³=1

2³=8

3³=0

4³=64≡10

5³=125≡17

6³=216≡0

7³=343≡343-12*27=343-324=19

8³=512≡512-18*27=512-486=26

9³=729≡0

10³=1000≡1000-37*27=1000-999=1

11³=1331≡1331-49*27=1331-1323=8

12³=1728≡0

13³=2197≡2197-81*27=2197-2187=10

14³=2744≡2744-101*27=2744-2727=17

15³=3375≡0

16³=4096≡4096-151*27=4096-4077=19

17³=4913≡4913-181*27=4913-4887=26

18³=5832≡0

19³=6859≡6859-254*27=6859-6858=1

20³=8000≡8000-296*27=8000-7992=8

21³=9261≡9261-342*27=9261-9234=27≡0

22³=10648≡10648-394*27=10648-10638=10

23³=12167≡12167-450*27=12167-12150=17

24³=13824≡13824-512*27=13824-13824=0

25³=15625≡15625-578*27=15625-15606=19

26³=17576≡17576-650*27=17576-17550=26

So, the cube residues modulo27 are:

0,1,8,10,17,19,26.

So, the possible residues for a cube modulo27 are 0,1,8,10,17,19,26.

Therefore, to have a³ + b³ + c³ ≡0 mod27, we need the sum of three residues in {0,1,8,10,17,19,26} to be ≡0 mod27.

Let’s see if it's possible for a, b, c not all to be multiples of27, but their cubes still adding up to 0 mod27.

For example, suppose a is 1 mod27, b is1 mod27, c is25 mod27.

But wait, 25 is not a cube residue mod27. Wait, 25 is not in {0,1,8,10,17,19,26}.

Wait, maybe a=1, b=1, c=25. But 25 is not a cube residue, so it's impossible for c to be 25 mod27.

Wait, so the cube residues modulo27 are only {0,1,8,10,17,19,26}.

Therefore, to get a sum of 0 mod27, we need combinations of three numbers from this set adding up to 0 mod27.

So, let's check possible combinations.

Case 1: All three are 0. Then, 0+0+0=0≡0 mod27.

Case 2: One is0, one is1, one is26: 0+1+26=27≡0 mod27.

Similarly, 0+8+19=27≡0.

0+10+17=27≡0.

Case3: All three are10:10+10+10=30≡3 mod27≠0.

Case4: Two1s and one25: but 25 isn't a residue.

Wait, actually, all possible combinations must consist of the allowed residues.

So, the only possible ways to get 0 mod27 are:

Either all three are0, or one is0, one is1, one is26; one is0, one is8, one is19; one is0, one is10, one is17.

So, in addition to the case where all a, b, c are multiples of27, we can have other cases where exactly one of a, b, c is multiple of27, and the other two are non-multiples whose cubes are inverses mod27.

For example, if a is multiple of27, then b³ + c³ ≡0 mod27.

Which can happen if b³ ≡ -c³ mod27.

Thus, if b³ ≡k mod27, then c³≡-k mod27.

So, for each non-zero cube residue k, we can pair it with -k.

Looking at the residues:

1 and26: since 1 +26=27≡0.

8 and19:8+19=27≡0.

10 and17:10+17=27≡0.

So, these are the pairs.

Therefore, the only ways to have a³ + b³ + c³ ≡0 mod27 are:

1. All a, b, c ≡0 mod27.

2. Exactly one of a, b, c ≡0 mod27, and the other two are non-zero, with their cubes being negatives of each other mod27.

So, that gives us additional solutions beyond the all-multiples-of-27 case.

Therefore, my initial conclusion that only multiples of27 work is incorrect. There are other solutions where exactly one of a, b, c is multiple of27, and the other two are non-multiples whose cubes are negatives mod27.

So, that complicates things.

Therefore, I need to compute the number of triples where either all are multiples of27, or exactly one is multiple of27 and the other two are non-multiples whose cubes are negatives mod27.

Therefore, let me compute both cases.

First, Case1: All a, b, c are multiples of27. As before, this gives 27³=19683 triples.

Case2: Exactly one of a, b, c is multiple of27, and the other two are non-multiples with their cubes adding up to0 mod27.

So, let's compute how many such triples there are.

First, choose which variable is the multiple of27. There are3 choices: a, b, or c.

Suppose we fix a as multiple of27, so a=27a', a'∈[1,27].

Then, b and c must satisfy b³ + c³ ≡0 mod27.

Which, as above, can be either both b and c are multiples of27, but in this case, since we're considering exactly one multiple, we need b and c not multiples of27.

So, b and c must be non-multiples of27, but their cubes sum to0 mod27.

From the earlier analysis, for each non-zero cube residue k, there is a unique residue -k such that k + (-k) ≡0 mod27.

The pairs are:

k=1, -k=26

k=8, -k=19

k=10, -k=17

So, for each such pair, we can have b³ ≡k and c³≡-k, or vice versa.

Therefore, for each pair, the number of possible (b, c) is equal to the number of b with b³≡k multiplied by the number of c with c³≡-k, plus the number of b with b³≡-k multiplied by the number of c with c³≡k.

But, in our case, since k and -k are different, unless k=-k mod27, which would require 2k≡0 mod27, but 27 is 3^3, so 2k≡0 mod27 ⇒k≡0 mod27/ gcd(2,27)=27, but k≠0. So, k≠-k mod27.

Therefore, for each pair (k, -k), the number of ordered pairs (b, c) is 2*(number of b with b³≡k)*(number of c with c³≡-k).

Wait, actually, for each pair (k, -k), the number of ordered pairs is 2*(number of solutions to b³≡k)*(number of solutions to c³≡-k). Because for each solution b of b³≡k, there are solutions c of c³≡-k, and vice versa.

So, let me compute how many solutions there are to b³≡k mod27 for each k in {1,8,10}.

First, for k=1:

Looking at the cube residues modulo27, for k=1, how many b satisfy b³≡1 mod27?

Looking back at the cube residues:

From above, n³ mod27 for n=1 is1, n=10 is10, n=19 is19, n=25 is25.

Wait, no, from the earlier list:

Wait, actually, for n=1, cube is1.

n=10:10³=1000≡1 mod27.

n=19:19³=6859≡1 mod27.

n=25:25³=15625≡1 mod27?

Wait, no, 25³=15625. 15625 divided by27: 27*578=15606. 15625-15606=19. So, 25³≡19 mod27.

Wait, so actually:

Wait, earlier when I listed n³ mod27 for n=1 to26, for n=1,10,19,25, the cubes are:

n=1:1

n=10:10³=1000≡1 mod27

n=19:19³=6859≡1 mod27

n=25:25³=15625≡19 mod27

Wait, so actually, b³≡1 mod27 has solutions b=1,10,19.

Similarly, b³≡8 mod27: n=2, n=11, n=20.

Because:

n=2:8

n=11:11³=1331≡8 mod27

n=20:20³=8000≡8 mod27

Similarly, b³≡10 mod27: n=3, n=12, n=21, n=26?

Wait, let me check:

Wait, earlier, n=3:3³=27≡0 mod27.

n=12:12³=1728≡0 mod27.

n=21:21³=9261≡0 mod27.

n=26:26³=17576≡26 mod27.

Wait, no, that's conflicting with earlier results.

Wait, let me check n=3:3³=27≡0.

n=12:12³=1728, which is 64*27, so 1728≡0 mod27.

n=21:21³=9261, which is 343*27, so 9261≡0 mod27.

n=26:26³=17576, which is 27*650 + 26, so 17576≡26 mod27.

Therefore, n=26:26³≡26 mod27.

So, perhaps my earlier analysis is wrong.

Wait, perhaps n=3:3³=27≡0.

n=4:4³=64≡10 mod27.

n=5:5³=125≡17 mod27.

n=6:6³=216≡0 mod27.

n=7:7³=343≡10 mod27.

n=8:8³=512≡26 mod27.

n=9:9³=729≡0 mod27.

n=10:10³=1000≡1 mod27.

n=11:11³=1331≡8 mod27.

n=12:12³=1728≡0 mod27.

n=13:13³=2197≡10 mod27.

n=14:14³=2744≡17 mod27.

n=15:15³=3375≡0 mod27.

n=16:16³=4096≡19 mod27.

n=17:17³=4913≡26 mod27.

n=18:18³=5832≡0 mod27.

n=19:19³=6859≡1 mod27.

n=20:20³=8000≡8 mod27.

n=21:21³=9261≡0 mod27.

n=22:22³=10648≡10 mod27.

n=23:23³=12167≡17 mod27.

n=24:24³=13824≡0 mod27.

n=25:25³=15625≡19 mod27.

n=26:26³=17576≡26 mod27.

Therefore, for each k:

k=0: n=3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24.

So, 8 solutions.

k=1: n=1,10,19.

k=8: n=2,11,20.

k=10: n=4,7,13.

k=17: n=5,14,23.

k=19: n=16,25.

k=26: n=8,17,26.

Wait, let me count:

Looking at the list above:

k=0: n=3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24: 8 solutions.

k=1: n=1,10,19:3 solutions.

k=8: n=2,11,20:3 solutions.

k=10: n=4,7,13:3 solutions.

k=17: n=5,14,23:3 solutions.

k=19: n=16,25:2 solutions.

k=26: n=8,17,26:3 solutions.

Wait, so k=19 has only 2 solutions? Wait, n=16:16³≡19 mod27; n=25:25³≡19 mod27. So, yes, 2 solutions.

Similarly, k=26: n=8,17,26: n=8:8³≡26; n=17:17³≡26; n=26:26³≡26.

Thus, 3 solutions.

Therefore, for each cube residue:

k=0:8 solutions.

k=1:3.

k=8:3.

k=10:3.

k=17:3.

k=19:2.

k=26:3.

So, for each non-zero cube residue, the number of solutions is:

k=1,8,10,17,26 have 3 solutions each.

k=19 has 2 solutions.

So, going back to case2, where we have exactly one multiple of27, and the other two are non-multiples with b³ + c³ ≡0 mod27.

So, suppose a is multiple of27, then b and c must satisfy b³ +c³ ≡0 mod27.

Which is equivalent to c³ ≡-b³ mod27.

So, for each b with b³ ≡k, c must satisfy c³≡-k.

So, the number of such pairs (b, c) is equal to the number of b with b³ ≡k multiplied by the number of c with c³≡-k.

So, the number of such ordered pairs is:

For each pair (k, -k):

If k ≠ -k mod27, then number of ordered pairs is (number of b with b³≡k)*(number of c with c³≡ -k).

So, for k=1, -k=26.

Number of b with b³≡1:3.

Number of c with c³≡26:3.

So, 3*3=9 ordered pairs.

Similarly, for k=8, -k=19.

Number of b with b³≡8:3.

Number of c with c³≡19:2.

So, 3*2=6 ordered pairs.

For k=10, -k=17.

Number of b with b³≡10:3.

Number of c with c³≡17:3.

So, 3*3=9 ordered pairs.

Therefore, for each non-zero k, the number of ordered pairs (b, c) is:

k=1:9, k=8:6, k=10:9, k=17:9, k=19:6, k=26:9.

Wait, let's verify:

k=1: b³=1, c³=26. So, 3*3=9.

k=8: b³=8, c³=19. 3*2=6.

k=10: b³=10, c³=17. 3*3=9.

k=17: b³=17, c³=10. 3*3=9.

k=19: b³=19, c³=8. 3*2=6.

k=26: b³=26, c³=1. 3*3=9.

So, total number of ordered pairs for each k is as above.

Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs (b, c) is:

For k=1:9

k=8:6

k=10:9

k=17:9

k=19:6

k=26:9

Total:9+6+9+9+6+9=54.

But wait, this is for each a being multiple of27.

But each a is from1 to27, so 27 choices for a.

For each a, number of (b, c) pairs is54.

Wait, no, wait: No, for each a being multiple of27, which gives a' from1 to27, each a has54 possible (b, c). But wait, actually, for each a being multiple of27, the number of (b, c) is54, regardless of a.

Wait, no, in reality, for each a being multiple of27, the number of possible (b, c) is54. But in the problem, a is from1 to729, which is27*27, so a=27a', a' from1 to27.

So, for each a', a=27a'.

Then, for each a', the number of (b, c) pairs is54.

But wait, no, 54 is per a', but a' can be from1 to27.

Wait, no, 54 is the number of (b, c) pairs for each a', because for each a', b and c can be any such that b³ +c³≡0 mod27, which has54 ordered pairs.

Wait, no, wait: when a' varies, a is varying, but for each a', the equation is independent.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the number of possible (b, c) pairs is54, regardless of a's value, as long as a is multiple of27.

But actually, no, (b, c) pairs are independent of a'.

So, for each a, which is a multiple of27, there are54 possible (b, c) pairs.

Therefore, the number of triples in this case is27 (choices for a') *54 (choices for (b, c))=27*54=1458.

But wait, no, because for each a being multiple of27 (i.e., a' from1 to27), each has54 (b, c) pairs.

But 27 a's, each with54 (b, c) pairs, so total 27*54=1458.

But wait, hold on, is this correct?

Wait, the (b, c) pairs are fixed as54 for each a', but actually, for each a', the (b, c) can vary independently.

Wait, no, no, no, the number of (b, c) pairs is54 regardless of a', so for each a', you have54 (b, c), so total is27*54=1458.

But let me think differently: The total number of triples where exactly one of a, b, c is multiple of27, and the other two are non-multiples with b³ +c³≡0 mod27.

So, for each position (a, b, or c) being the multiple of27, we have:

Number of such triples:3 (choices for which variable is multiple of27) *27 (choices for that variable) *54 (choices for the other two variables).

But wait, no, because when you fix which variable is multiple of27, say a, then b and c must satisfy b³ +c³≡0 mod27, which gives54 possible pairs (b, c). Similarly, if it's b, then a and c must satisfy a³ +c³≡0 mod27, which is again54 pairs, and same for c.

Therefore, total number is3 *27 *54.

But hold on, but in the case where multiple variables are multiples of27, but we are considering exactly one, so actually, in the above, when you fix a as multiple of27, then b and c cannot be multiples of27, because we are considering exactly one multiple.

But in our initial calculation for (b, c), we considered only non-multiples. So, in this case, for each a being a multiple of27, b and c cannot be multiples of27, but must satisfy b³ + c³≡0 mod27.

Which, as above, gives54 ordered pairs.

But in reality, b and c can be any numbers from1 to729, but in this case, we are considering them as non-multiples of27, because we are in the case where exactly one of a, b, c is multiple of27.

Wait, no, actually, non-multiples of27 are numbers from1 to729 that are not multiples of27.

But when we considered the (b, c) pairs, we were considering b and c as non-multiples, but in reality, in this case, b and c could be multiples of27 as long as they are not multiples of27 in the sense of a³≡0 mod27.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the total number of triples where exactly one of a, b, c is multiple of27, and the other two satisfy b³ + c³≡0 mod27.

So, first, choose which variable is multiple of27:3 choices.

Suppose it's a: a is multiple of27, so a=27a', a'∈[1,27].

Then, b and c must satisfy b³ +c³≡0 mod27.

But b and c can be any numbers from1 to729, but in this case, they are not multiples of27, because we're in the case where exactly one is multiple.

Wait, no, actually, in this case, b and c are not restricted to be non-multiples; they can be anything as long as their cubes sum to0 mod27.

But in the previous analysis, we considered b and c as non-multiples, but in reality, b and c can be multiples of27 as well.

Wait, no, in this case, we're in the case where exactly one of a, b, c is multiple of27. Therefore, b and c cannot be multiples of27, because that would make two multiples, which is not allowed.

Therefore, in this case, b and c must be non-multiples of27, i.e., b, c∈[1,729] excluding multiples of27.

But also, their cubes must sum to0 mod27.

From earlier, we have two types of solutions:

Either b³≡0 mod27 and c³≡0 mod27, but since we're considering non-multiples, this is excluded.

Or, b³≡k and c³≡-k mod27 for some k≠0.

Therefore, for each a being multiple of27, the number of (b, c) pairs is the number of ordered pairs (b, c) where b, c are non-multiples of27, and b³ +c³≡0 mod27.

Which is the same as the number of ordered pairs where b³≡k and c³≡-k for some non-zero k.

From our earlier computation, for each non-zero k, the number of ordered pairs is (number of b with b³≡k)*(number of c with c³≡-k).

But in our earlier list, for each k≠0, the number of b with b³≡k is:

k=1:3

k=8:3

k=10:3

k=17:3

k=19:2

k=26:3

Similarly, for -k:

Since -k mod27 is another residue, let's map them:

k=1: -1=26, which has3 solutions.

k=8: -8=19, which has2 solutions.

k=10: -10=17, which has3 solutions.

k=17: -17=10, which has3 solutions.

k=19: -19=8, which has3 solutions.

k=26: -26=1, which has3 solutions.

So, for each k≠0:

Number of ordered pairs (b, c):

k=1:3*3=9

k=8:3*2=6

k=10:3*3=9

k=17:3*3=9

k=19:2*3=6

k=26:3*3=9

Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs is9+6+9+9+6+9=54.

So, for each a multiple of27, there are54 possible (b, c) pairs.

Since a can be any multiple of27 from1 to729, i.e., a=27a', a' from1 to27, so there are27 such a's.

Therefore, the number of triples where exactly one of a, b, c is multiple of27, and the other two satisfy b³ +c³≡0 mod27 is3 *27 *54.

Wait, hold on, 3 positions, each with27 a's, each with54 (b, c) pairs.

But wait, if we do 3*27*54, that would be overcounting, because for each a being multiple of27, we have54 (b, c) pairs, but when we consider another variable being multiple of27, the (a, c) pairs would be different.

Wait, no, actually, it's three separate cases: when a is multiple, when b is multiple, when c is multiple.

Each case is independent, so total is3 *27 *54.

Therefore, total number is3*27*54=3*27*54.

Compute that:

27*54=1458

1458*3=4374

So, 4374 triples where exactly one of a, b, c is multiple of27, and the other two satisfy b³ +c³≡0 mod27.

Therefore, in addition to the4683 triples where all a, b, c are multiples of27, we have4374 more triples.

Therefore, total N=4683 +4374=9057.

Wait, 4683+4374=9057.

Then, 9057 divided by1000 is9 with remainder57.

Therefore, the remainder is57.

Wait, but hold on, is that correct?

Wait, but wait, is the count correct?

Because in case2, for each of the three variables, we have27 choices for a multiple of27, and for each such a,54 pairs for b and c.

But wait, actually, when a is fixed as multiple of27, the number of (b, c) pairs is54.

But since b and c are being chosen from non-multiples of27, but actually, in this case, b and c are being considered as any numbers from1 to729, but with the condition that they are non-multiples of27 and their cubes sum to0 mod27.

But wait, earlier, we considered that for each a multiple of27, the number of (b, c) pairs is54, regardless of a's value.

But in reality, when a is varying, (b, c) pairs are fixed.

Wait, actually, no, the (b, c) pairs are independent of a's choice.

Each (b, c) pair is such that b³ +c³≡0 mod27, regardless of a.

Therefore, for each a multiple of27, we have54 such (b, c) pairs.

Since a can be any multiple of27, which are27 numbers, so total is27*54=1458 for each position.

But since there are three positions, we multiply by3:1458*3=4374.

Therefore, total number is4683 +4374=9057.

Thus, N=9057.

Therefore, 9057 divided by1000 is9 with remainder57.

So, the answer is57.

But wait, but let's verify.

Wait, let's think about this.

Total number of triples where a³ +b³ +c³≡0 mod27:

Case1: All a, b, c multiples of27:27³=19683.

Case2: Exactly one of a, b, c is multiple of27, and the other two are non-multiples with b³ +c³≡0 mod27:3*27*(number of (b, c) pairs).

But number of (b, c) pairs is54, as computed.

Therefore,3*27*54=4374.

So, total N=19683 +4374=24057.

Wait, hold on, that's different from before.

Wait, earlier, I said that in case2, the number of triples is4374, and case1 is19683, so total N=24057.

Wait, but in my initial computation, I thought case1 was19683, case2 was4374, so total N=24057.

But then, why did I get confused earlier?

Wait, no, I think I made a miscalculation.

Wait, no, case1 is all a, b, c multiples of27:27³=19683.

Case2 is exactly one multiple of27 and the other two non-multiples with b³ +c³≡0 mod27:3*27*54=4374.

Therefore, total N=19683 +4374=24057.

Therefore, N=24057.

So, 24057 divided by1000 is24 with remainder57.

Therefore, the remainder is57.

Wait, so why was I confused earlier?

Because I initially thought that in case2, the number of triples was4374, and in case1,19683, so total24057.

Thus, the remainder is57.

Therefore, the answer is57.

But wait, there is a mistake here.

Because in case2, when we fix a as multiple of27, and count (b, c) pairs, but b and c are non-multiples, but in the case where exactly one is multiple of27, but perhaps b and c could also be multiples of27, but in this case, since we are in the exactly one multiple case, they must be non-multiples.

But in our calculation, we have considered (b, c) pairs where b and c are non-multiples, but not necessarily non-multiples of27.

Wait, no, in case2, b and c cannot be multiples of27, because that would make two multiples, which is not allowed.

Therefore, in case2, b and c are non-multiples of27, hence their residues modulo27 are non-zero.

Therefore, the number of (b, c) pairs is indeed54, as computed earlier.

Therefore, total N=24057.

Therefore, modulo1000, 24057 mod1000 is57.

Therefore, the remainder is57.

So, the answer is57.

But wait, just to make sure, let's verify the calculations once more.

Case1: All multiples of27:27³=19683.

Case2: Exactly one multiple of27, other two non-multiples with b³ +c³≡0 mod27:3 positions, each with27 choices for the multiple, and54 (b, c) pairs:3*27*54=4374.

Total N=19683+4374=24057.

24057 divided by1000 is24, remainder57.

Thus, answer is57.

Wait, but is that correct?

Wait, but 27³ is19683, which is correct.

Case2: for exactly one multiple of27, and the other two sum to0 mod27.

But in case2, for each a being multiple of27, the number of (b, c) pairs is54.

But 54 is per a', i.e., per a being27a'.

But no, 54 is the number of (b, c) pairs for each a.

Wait, no, for each a, regardless of a', the number of (b, c) pairs is54.

But actually, the (b, c) pairs are dependent only on mod27, not on the value of a.

Therefore, for each a multiple of27, which are27 choices, each has54 (b, c) pairs.

Therefore, total in case2 is27*54=1458 per variable, but since there are three variables, it's3*1458=4374.

Therefore, N=19683 +4374=24057.

So, yes,24057.

Wait, but 24057 is equal to27³ +3*27*54=19683 +4374=24057.

Yes.

Therefore, 24057 divided by1000 is24*1000 +57, so remainder57.

Therefore, the answer is57.

Therefore, the remainder is57.

But wait, hold on, let me think about the logic.

In case2, when exactly one of a, b, c is multiple of27, and the other two are non-multiples of27 but their cubes sum to0 mod27.

But in reality, when a is multiple of27, then a³≡0 mod27, so b³ +c³≡0 mod27.

But in case2, we have considered that b and c are non-multiples of27, but actually, 27 is3^3, so numbers not divisible by27 can still be divisible by3.

But in our cube residues mod27, we have considered all non-multiples of27, but they can still be divisible by3.

But wait, 27 is a high power.

Wait, let me think: numbers not divisible by27 can be divisible by3^k where k=1,2, but not3^3.

But in our analysis earlier, we saw that for a number to have cube≡0 mod27, it must be≡0 mod3. So, non-multiples of27 can still have cube≡0 mod3, but not mod27.

Therefore, in case2, when a is multiple of27, then b and c can be any numbers from1 to729, except multiples of27, such that b³ +c³≡0 mod27.

Which is equivalent to b³≡-c³ mod27.

Which, as we saw, can be achieved in two ways: both b and c are multiples of27, but we are excluding that, or b³≡k and c³≡-k mod27.

But since b and c are non-multiples of27, their cubes are non-zero mod27, but can be k or -k.

Therefore, our earlier count holds.

Therefore, the logic is correct.

Thus, the total number of triples is24057, which gives a remainder of57 when divided by1000.

Therefore, the answer is57.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{57}
</think>

Given the problem of finding the number of ordered triples of positive integers \((a, b, c)\) such that \(a, b, c \leq 3^6\) and \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\) is a multiple of \(3^7\), we need to consider the residues of \(a, b, c\) modulo powers of 3.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3^7}\).
   - We consider the residues of \(a, b, c\) modulo \(3^k\) for \(k\) up to 7.

2. **Cubes Modulo 27**:
   - For a number \(n\) not divisible by 3, the cube residues modulo 27 are 1, 8, 10, 17, 19, 26.
   - For a number \(n\) divisible by 3 but not by 9, the cube is 0 modulo 27.
   - For a number \(n\) divisible by 9, the cube is 0 modulo 27.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: All \(a, b, c\) are multiples of 27. This gives \(a', b', c' \in [1, 27]\), resulting in \(27^3 = 19683\) triples.
   - **Case 2**: Exactly one of \(a, b, c\) is a multiple of 27, and the other two are non-multiples whose cubes sum to 0 modulo 27. This results in 3 choices for which variable is a multiple of 27, 27 choices for that variable, and 54 pairs for the other two variables, giving \(3 \times 27 \times 54 = 4374\) triples.

4. **Total Count**:
   - Adding the cases, we get \(19683 + 4374 = 24057\).

5. **Finding the Remainder**:
   - Dividing 24057 by 1000, the remainder is 57.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{57}
\]
