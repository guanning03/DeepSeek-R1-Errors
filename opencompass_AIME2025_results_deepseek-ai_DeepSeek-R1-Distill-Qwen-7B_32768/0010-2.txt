Question:
The twelve letters $A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K$, and $L$ are randomly grouped into six pairs of letters. The two letters in each pair are placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form six two-letter words, and those six words are listed alphabetically. For example, a possible result is $AB,CJ,DG,EK,FL,HI$. The probability that the last word listed contains $G$ is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where there are twelve letters from A to L, and they're grouped into six pairs. Each pair is then arranged in alphabetical order to form two-letter words, and these six words are listed alphabetically. I need to find the probability that the last word contains the letter G. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, we have letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L. That's twelve letters. These are going to be grouped into six pairs. Each pair is then sorted alphabetically to form a two-letter word. So, for example, if we have a pair like G and A, it becomes AG because A comes before G. Then, all six of these words are listed alphabetically. So the order is determined by the first letter, and if the first letters are the same, then by the second letter.

Our task is to find the probability that the last word in this list contains the letter G. So, the last word could be something like GH, GL, or maybe even something else if G ends up in the other position, but since we sort each pair alphabetically, the word will always have the first letter before the second letter. So, for G to be in the last word, either the last word is something like GH or something else where G is the second letter.

But wait, the last word in the list is the one that comes last when all six two-letter words are sorted alphabetically. So, to have G in the last word, either G is the second letter in the last word, meaning the last word is something like XG where X is after G in the alphabet, but actually, since we're sorting all the words, it's more about the position of the word in the overall list.

Wait, no, actually, the words are sorted alphabetically, so the first word is the one starting with the earliest letter, and so on. So, the last word will be the one starting with the latest letter. So, for the last word to contain G, either G is the starting letter or the ending letter in the last word. But since G is the 7th letter in the alphabet, it's not the latest letter. The latest letter among the given is L, which is the 12th. So, actually, if G is not the starting letter, it might be the ending letter of the last word.

Wait, that might be the case. So, for the last word to contain G, G must either be the first letter or the second letter in the last word. But since G is in the middle of the alphabet, it's not the highest, so the last word is more likely to start with L or something. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe we can model this as: for the last word to contain G, G must be paired with a letter that is either before or after it. But since we sort each pair, the word will have the smaller letter first. So, for G to be in the last word, it must be paired with a letter that is either before G or after G. But since the words are then sorted alphabetically, the last word will be the one starting with the highest letter. So, the last word's first letter is the highest among the six words. So, if G is in the last word, it's either the first or the second letter.

But wait, no, since each word is sorted, the first letter is the smaller one. Thus, in the last word, the first letter is the highest among all the starting letters of the six words. So, if G is in the last word, it must be either the first or the second letter. But if it's the first letter, then it's the highest letter, which would be L, right? Because L is the last. So, if G is the first letter in the last word, that's impossible because L is already the highest. So, that can't happen.

Wait, no, in the example provided, the last word is HI. So, the last word is the highest when all are sorted. So, in the example, the words are AB, CJ, DG, EK, FL, HI. When sorted, HI is last, which is the highest.

So, in order for the last word to contain G, G must be the second letter in that last word, right? Because the first letter is the highest starting letter, and then G is the second letter. So, the last word would be something like XG, where X is the highest possible letter before G? Wait, no. Wait, if the last word is XG, then X must be the highest letter in the entire set, which is L. But L is the highest, so if X is L, then the last word would be LG. But in the given example, it's HI. So, I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Each pair is sorted, so the first letter is the smaller one. Then, all six words are sorted alphabetically. So, the last word is the one that is last in this alphabetical list. So, to have G in the last word, either:

1. The last word is G followed by something, but since G is not the last letter, that can't happen. Or,
2. The last word is something followed by G, meaning G is the second letter in the last word.

But in that case, the first letter of the last word must be a letter that is higher than G, but since we are sorting all the words, the first letters are from A up to whatever. Wait, no, all the first letters are the smaller ones in their respective pairs. So, the first letters of the words are letters from A to whatever, but the last word is the one that starts with the highest possible first letter. So, the last word must start with the highest possible letter, which is L, but since G is not L, the last word cannot start with G.

Therefore, the only way for G to be in the last word is if G is the second letter in the last word, meaning that the first letter of the last word is something higher than G, but since G is the 7th letter, the only higher letters are H, I, J, K, L. So, if the last word is something like XG where X is among H, I, J, K, L, but since each pair is sorted, the first letter is the smaller one. So, for G to be the second letter in the last word, the first letter must be a letter higher than G? Wait, but higher than G in the alphabet is H, I, J, K, L. But if the first letter is higher, that would mean that G is paired with a letter that is higher than G, but since we sort each pair, that would mean that G would actually come first, making the first letter G, not the higher letter.

Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again.

Suppose I have a pair where G is paired with a letter higher than G, say H. Then, when sorted, the pair becomes GH. Similarly, if G is paired with I, it becomes GI, and so on. So, if G is paired with a higher letter, the word will be GH, GI, GJ, GK, GL. So, these words would be towards the end of the alphabetical list. So, if G is paired with L, which is the highest, it would be GL, which is the second highest two-letter word. Then, HI would be the highest, followed by GL.

Wait, in the example, the words are AB, CJ, DG, EK, FL, HI. So, sorted, it's AB, CJ, DG, EK, FL, HI. So, HI is the last word. So, in that case, G is in the third word, DG, which is in the middle.

So, the last word is HI. So, G is not in the last word. So, in that case, the last word doesn't contain G. So, in that case, the probability is not 1, which is clear.

So, to have G in the last word, we need G to be in the last word. That would mean that either G is the first letter or the second letter of the last word. But, since the last word is the highest in the alphabetical list, its first letter is the highest possible.

But G is the 7th letter, so the highest letter is L, which is 12th. So, the first letter of the last word must be L. But if G is in the last word, then the last word must be either LG or something else? Wait, no, because the words are sorted, so if you have LG, it would be the second word if L is the second letter, but no, when sorted, you have the entire word.

Wait, no, to clarify, each pair is sorted, so for instance, if the pair is G and L, when sorted, it becomes GL, because G comes before L. So, the pair is sorted, so the first letter is the smaller one, and the second letter is the larger one.

Therefore, the first letter of each word is always the smaller one, so the last word will have the largest starting letter. So, the last word will be the one with the largest first letter, which is L. But if G is in the last word, then G must be either the first or the second letter. However, since the first letter is the smaller one, G can't be the first letter unless G is paired with someone higher, which would make the word start with G, but G is already the 7th letter, so someone higher is H, I, J, K, L.

Wait, let me think. If G is paired with H, then the word is GH. If G is paired with I, it's GI, etc. So, these words would be in the middle, not the last. So, in order for the last word to contain G, G must be the second letter, meaning that the first letter is higher than G, but we just saw that if you pair G with a higher letter, the first letter is G. So, unless G is paired with a letter lower than G, making the word start with G, but then the first letter would be G, which is lower than L, so it can't be the last word.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach.

We need the last word in the sorted list to contain G. So, the last word is the highest two-letter word in the alphabetical list. So, the highest two-letter word is the one that starts with the highest possible letter. The highest possible letter is L, so the highest two-letter word is LA or something. Wait, LA is not possible because A is before L. So, the highest two-letter word would be something starting with L, and then the highest possible second letter, which is L itself, but we can't have LL because all letters are unique. So, L must be paired with the next highest letter, which is K, making LK.

Wait, okay, so the highest two-letter word would be LK. So, LK is the highest, then L... but wait, L is already paired with K. So, the next highest would be something like LG, but L paired with G is LG, but G is before L, so LG is the word.

Wait, no, actually, since all the pairs are sorted, each two-letter word is in alphabetical order, meaning that the first letter is the smaller one.

Therefore, the highest two-letter word is the one starting with the highest letter, which is L, and paired with the next highest letter, which is K, making LK. So, the highest two-letter word is LK.

But hold on, if G is in the last word, then the last word should be something containing G, but if the highest two-letter word is LK, then G cannot be in the last word unless G is paired with something higher, but since L is the highest, that's not possible.

Wait, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the last word doesn't necessarily have to be the highest two-letter word in the entire set. Because in the example given, the last word is HI, which is the highest two-letter word in the example, but in that case, the last word doesn't contain G.

Wait, that's confusing. So, in the example, the last word is HI, which is the highest in the list, but it doesn't contain G. So, how can we have the last word containing G?

Wait, perhaps the last word doesn't have to be the highest two-letter word in the entire set, but just the highest in the list of six words.

Wait, no, the problem says that the six words are listed alphabetically, so the last word is the last in that list, which would be the highest two-letter word in the entire set.

Wait, but in the example, HI is the last word, but it's not the highest possible two-letter word, because you can have LK as the highest. So, maybe the problem is that in the example, it's just an example, but the highest two-letter word is indeed LK.

So, in order for G to be in the last word, which is the highest two-letter word, G must be the second letter in LK, but since L is the first letter and G is the second letter, but in that case, LK would still be the highest two-letter word regardless of G. So, unless G is paired with a higher letter, which is impossible because L is the highest, so G can't be in the highest two-letter word.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Let me think about the total number of ways to pair the letters. Then, figure out how many pairings result in G being in the last word.

But how?

Alternatively, maybe think about the probability that, among all possible pairings, G is in the last word when the words are sorted.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the problem as arranging the letters into pairs and then sorting the pairs.

So, first, we have letters A to L, which are 12 letters. They are to be paired into six pairs. Each pair is sorted into a two-letter word, then all six words are sorted alphabetically, and we need the last word to contain G.

So, to model this, perhaps consider all possible pairings, then for each pairing, sort the pairs into words, sort the words alphabetically, and check if G is in the last word.

But that seems too computational. Maybe we can find a symmetry or something.

Wait, perhaps the key is that for any letter, the probability that it's in the last word is the same for each letter? But that can't be, because letters towards the end of the alphabet are more likely to be in the last word.

Wait, no, because in the sorted list of two-letter words, the last word is the highest two-letter word, which is determined by the pairings.

So, to have G in the last word, G must be in the highest two-letter word, which is determined by the pairing.

But the highest two-letter word is the one with the highest starting letter, and the highest starting letter is L. So, the highest two-letter word is either L paired with someone, or someone paired with L, but since each pair is sorted, L can only be paired with someone before it, so the word would be something like L paired with K, making LK.

So, the highest two-letter word is LK. Therefore, the last word must be LK in order to have G in it, but LK doesn't contain G, so that can't be.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Maybe the last word isn't necessarily the highest two-letter word, but just the last in the list when all the two-letter words are sorted.

Wait, no, the problem says that the six words are listed alphabetically, so the last word is the highest one.

Therefore, if the last word is the highest, which is LK, then G cannot be in the last word, unless G is in LK, but LK is L followed by K, so G isn't in that.

Wait, this is confusing. So, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the last word isn't necessarily starting with L, but could be starting with a lower letter if it's the last in the alphabetical list. Wait, no, in alphabetical order, the last word is the highest one, which would be the one starting with the highest letter.

So, for example, if you have words like AB, CD, EF, GH, JK, LM, then LM is the last word.

So, if G is in the word, it would have to be in a word where it's the first or second letter, but only if the word is after LM in the list.

Wait, no, because LM is the last word. So, if G is in a word, say, KL, which would be the second word if it's sorted, but it would still be before LM.

I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I need another approach.

Let me consider that each pairing is a perfect matching of the 12 letters into 6 pairs. Each pair is sorted into a two-letter word, then all words are sorted alphabetically, and we need the last word to contain G.

So, for the last word to contain G, G must be in a pair where it is either the first or the second letter. If G is the first letter, then the word is GA, GB, etc., but since we're pairing randomly, G can be paired with any other letter.

But for G to be in the last word, which is the highest two-letter word, G must be the second letter in the highest two-letter word. So, the highest two-letter word would be something like L paired with G, making LG, but since we sort each pair, it would be GL.

Wait, but if G is paired with L, the word becomes GL, which is the same as LG, but sorted, it's GL. So, the highest two-letter word containing G would be GL, but that is still not the highest two-letter word overall because the highest is LK.

Wait, no, if G is in the highest two-letter word, which is LK, but LK is already the highest, so G can't be in LK because LK is L and K, so G is in a different word.

Wait, this is getting me nowhere. Maybe I need to think about the position of G in the sorted list of words.

Each pair is sorted, so each word is in order. Then, all six words are sorted alphabetically. So, the list is from the first word to the sixth word.

So, the first word is the smallest two-letter word, the sixth word is the largest.

So, to have G in the sixth word, the sixth word must contain G as either the first or the second letter.

But, since the sixth word is the largest, its first letter must be the largest possible. The largest possible first letter is L.

So, the sixth word is either starting with L, or if G is the first letter, but G is not the largest.

So, the sixth word must start with L, and then have the next largest possible letter. So, the sixth word is either LA, LB, ..., LL, but since all letters are unique, it's L paired with the next highest letter, which is K, making LK.

So, the sixth word is LK. So, LK is the sixth word, and it contains K and L. So, G is not in LK.

Therefore, how can G be in the sixth word? It can't be, because LK is the sixth word, and it contains L and K, not G.

Wait, so that suggests that it's impossible for G to be in the sixth word. But that can't be, because in the example, the sixth word is HI, which contains H and I, but not G.

Wait, so maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the sixth word isn't necessarily starting with L. Maybe in some cases, G is the second letter in the sixth word, making the sixth word something like XG, where X is a higher letter than G.

But wait, in order for XG to be the sixth word, X must be the first letter, which is the highest among all the first letters of the six words. But X has to be higher than G, so X can be H, I, J, K, L. So, if we pair G with X, making XG, then the word is XG, which is higher than the words starting with letters lower than X.

But the first letters of all the words are the smaller letters in each pair. So, if we have a pair like HG, it becomes GH, which is the word GH. So, if G is paired with H, the word is GH. If G is paired with I, it's GI, etc.

So, if G is paired with a higher letter, say H, I, J, K, or L, then the word becomes GH, GI, GJ, GK, GL. These words are all in the middle of the sorted list. So, the highest word is still going to be something starting with L, like LK. So, the sixth word is LK.

Therefore, G cannot be in the sixth word because LK is the sixth word, and it doesn't contain G. So, that suggests that the probability is zero. But that can't be right, because the problem is asking for a probability of m/n, so m and n are positive integers.

Wait, maybe my understanding is flawed. Maybe the sixth word isn't necessarily the highest two-letter word. Maybe the problem is that the two-letter words are sorted alphabetically, not the first letters.

Wait, no, the two-letter words are sorted alphabetically. So, the entire word is considered. So, for example, if you have the words AB, CD, EF, GH, JK, LM, when sorted, they are in order AB, CD, EF, GH, JK, LM. So, the last word is LM.

If G is in GH, which is the fourth word, so the last word is LM.

But in another scenario, suppose G is paired with a higher letter, say L. Then, the word is GL. If you have another pair like JK, which is JK, then the words would be AB, CD, EF, GL, JK, HI, but wait, HI is a word, so no, actually, the pairing would have to be such that all letters are used.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of it as the last word being the highest in the sorted list, regardless of its starting letter.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, it's stated that the two-letter words are listed alphabetically. So, the first word is the smallest one, which would be AB, and the last word is the largest one, which would be LM if all pairs are consecutive letters.

Wait, but in that case, the last word is LM, which doesn't involve G.

So, in order to have G in the last word, we need G to be the second letter of the last word, but since the last word is the highest, which is LM, that can't happen.

Wait, so maybe it's impossible for G to be in the last word? But that seems contradictory because the problem is asking for the probability, implying that it is possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, maybe the last word is not necessarily LM. If the pairing is different, maybe the last word is something else.

Wait, let me think. Suppose that instead of pairing letters sequentially, we have a different pairing. For example, if you have pairs like LA, LB, LC, etc., but no, all letters are used.

Wait, for instance, if G is paired with L, making GL, and K is paired with J, making JK, and I with H, making IH, and F with E, making FE, D with C, making DC, and B with A, making BA. Then, when sorted, the words are BA, DC, FE, IH, JK, GL. Then, the last word would be GL, which contains G. So, in this case, G is in the last word.

Wait, that's an interesting case. So, in this pairing, the last word is GL, which contains G, so that's a valid case.

So, in this case, G is paired with L, which is the highest letter, making GL, which is the last word.

So, in this case, G is in the last word.

So, that suggests that it is possible for G to be in the last word if G is paired with L. So, in such a pairing, GL is the last word.

Therefore, the key is that G is paired with L, making GL, which is the last word, containing G.

Therefore, the number of such pairings where G is paired with L is equal to the number of ways to pair the remaining letters.

So, if we fix G paired with L, then the remaining letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K.

These 10 letters need to be paired into five pairs, and each pair will be sorted into a two-letter word, and then all six words will be sorted, making GL the last word.

But wait, if we fix G and L as a pair, making GL, then the other pairs are AB, CD, EF, HI, JK. So, when sorted, the words are AB, CD, EF, GH, JK, GL. Wait, no, GH is another word. Wait, no, GH is not in the pairing.

Wait, hold on, in the pairing where G is paired with L, and the other letters are paired as AB, CD, EF, HI, JK, then the words are AB, CD, EF, GH, JK, GL. But GH is not a word because G is already paired with L.

Wait, no, in that case, the words would be AB, CD, EF, HI, JK, and GL. So, when sorted, they are AB, CD, EF, HI, JK, GL. Thus, the last word is GL, which contains G.

Therefore, in this case, the pairing where G is with L, and the other letters are paired in consecutive order, gives us GL as the last word.

Therefore, the key is that if G is paired with L, then GL becomes the last word, containing G. So, the number of such pairings is equal to the number of ways to pair the remaining letters, which is 10 letters, so the number of ways is (10 - 1)!!, which is 9!! = 9 × 7 × 5 × 3 × 1 = 945.

But wait, total number of ways to pair 12 letters is 11!! = 11 × 9 × 7 × 5 × 3 × 1 = 10395.

Therefore, the number of favorable pairings is 945, so the probability is 945 / 10395.

Simplify this fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 945. 945 ÷ 945 = 1, 10395 ÷ 945 = 11. So, the probability is 1/11.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the probability is 1/11, so m = 1, n = 11, m + n = 12.

But wait, let me verify. Because in the example given, the last word is HI, which is not GL. But in my earlier thought, when G is paired with L, the last word is GL.

So, is that the only way for G to be in the last word? Or are there other pairings where G is not paired with L, but still ends up in the last word?

Wait, in the earlier case, I had G paired with L, making GL the last word. But what if G is paired with someone else, but the word containing G is the last word because it's the highest word.

Wait, for example, if G is paired with K, making KG, which is the word. Then, when the words are sorted, KG would be the last word if it's the highest. But is KG a higher word than LK? Wait, no, because L is higher than K.

Wait, if G is paired with K, making KG, which is higher than LK? No, LK is higher because L is higher than K.

Wait, no, in alphabetical order, the words are compared first by the first letter, then by the second. So, LK is higher than KG because L comes after K. So, LK would still be the last word, regardless of whether G is paired with K or someone else.

So, in that case, if G is paired with someone else, the last word is still LK, so G cannot be in the last word unless it's paired with L.

Wait, unless G is paired with someone else and the word is higher than LK.

But LK is starting with L, which is the highest possible first letter. So, no word can start with a higher letter than L, so LK is the highest possible word.

Therefore, the only way for G to be in the last word is if G is paired with L, making GL the last word.

Therefore, the number of favorable pairings is equal to the number of ways to pair the remaining letters, which is 10 letters, so 9!! = 945.

Total number of pairings is 11!! = 10395.

So, the probability is 945 / 10395. Simplify: Divide numerator and denominator by 945, we get 1/11.

Therefore, the probability is 1/11, so m = 1, n = 11, so m + n = 12.

Wait, so is that the answer? 12.

But let me make sure that I didn't miss any other cases where G is in the last word without being paired with L.

Suppose that G is paired with someone else, say H, making GH. But GH is a word, but the highest word is still LK, so GH would be somewhere in the middle, not the last.

Similarly, if G is paired with I, making GI, which is still before LK.

If G is paired with J, making GJ.

If G is paired with K, making GK.

If G is paired with L, making GL.

So, only when G is paired with L, making GL, which is the last word, containing G.

Therefore, the only favorable case is when G is paired with L.

Hence, the number of favorable pairings is equal to the number of ways to pair the remaining 10 letters, which is 9!! = 945.

Total pairings: 11!! = 10395.

Probability: 945 / 10395 = 1/11.

So, m = 1, n = 11, m + n = 12.

Therefore, the answer is 12.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{12}
</think>

The twelve letters \(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L\) are randomly grouped into six pairs. Each pair is then sorted into a two-letter word, and these words are listed alphabetically. We need to find the probability that the last word contains the letter \(G\).

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The letters are paired randomly and each pair is sorted alphabetically.
   - The resulting two-letter words are sorted alphabetically and listed.
   - We need the probability that the last word contains \(G\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The last word is the highest in alphabetical order.
   - The highest possible two-letter word is \(LK\) since \(L\) is the highest letter.
   - For \(G\) to be in the last word, it must be the second letter of the highest word.

3. **Pairing Consideration**:
   - For \(G\) to be in the last word, it must be paired with \(L\), making the word \(GL\).
   - The remaining letters must be paired such that the highest word is \(GL\).

4. **Counting Favorable Pairings**:
   - Fixing \(G\) and \(L\) as a pair, we need to count the number of ways to pair the remaining 10 letters.
   - The number of ways to pair 10 letters is \(9!! = 945\).

5. **Total Pairings**:
   - The total number of ways to pair 12 letters is \(11!! = 10395\).

6. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The probability is the ratio of favorable pairings to total pairings: \(\frac{945}{10395} = \frac{1}{11}\).

7. **Simplification**:
   - The fraction simplifies to \(\frac{1}{11}\), so \(m = 1\) and \(n = 11\).
   - Therefore, \(m + n = 1 + 11 = 12\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).
