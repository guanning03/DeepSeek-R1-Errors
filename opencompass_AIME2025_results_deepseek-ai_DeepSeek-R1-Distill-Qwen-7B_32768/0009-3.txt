Wrong Answer:
Okay, so I have this problem where Alex divides a disk into four quadrants with two perpendicular diameters. Then he draws 25 more line segments by selecting two random points on the perimeter of the disk, each in different quadrants, and connecting them. I need to find the expected number of regions these 27 line segments divide the disk into.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the disk is already divided into four quadrants by two diameters. So, without any additional line segments, there are four regions. Then, each of these 25 additional line segments is a chord connecting two points on the perimeter, but each point has to be in a different quadrant. So, each chord connects two points, each in separate quadrants. 

I remember that when you add chords to a circle, the number of regions increases based on how the chords intersect. Each new chord can potentially create new regions depending on how many existing chords it intersects. So, maybe I can model this problem using that idea.

Let me recall the formula for the maximum number of regions created by chords in a circle. I think it's related to combinatorial geometry. The maximum number of regions formed by n chords is given by the formula R(n) = C(n,4) + C(n,2) + 1. Wait, is that right? Or is it something else? 

Wait, no, that might be for something else. Let me think. If you have n chords in general position (meaning no three chords intersect at the same point), the number of regions R is given by R = n(n - 1)/2 + n + 1. But that doesn't seem right either because when n=0, R=1, which is correct, but when n=1, R=2, which is correct, n=2, R=4, which is correct, n=3, R=7. Hmm, actually, that formula might not be correct.

Wait, hold on. I think the correct formula is R(n) = C(n,4) + C(n,2) + 1. Let me test that. For n=0, R=1, which works. For n=1, R=1 + 0 +1=2, which is correct. For n=2, R=0 + 1 +1=2, wait, that's incorrect because two chords can intersect once, creating 4 regions. So, maybe the formula is different.

Actually, I think the correct formula is R(n) = C(n,2) + C(n,1) + C(n,0). Wait, that doesn't make sense either. Maybe it's R(n) = n(n + 1)/2 +1? For n=0, R=1. n=1, R=2. n=2, R=4. n=3, R=7. n=4, R=11. Hmm, that seems to fit. But wait, for n=3, three chords can intersect at three points, creating 7 regions? Let me visualize. If you have three chords, each intersecting the others, yes, it should create 7 regions.

But wait, in our case, the chords are not in general position because each chord connects two points in different quadrants. So, maybe the number of intersections is fixed, or perhaps it's less than the maximum possible.

Wait, so perhaps I should think differently. The initial four quadrants are divided by two diameters. Then, each additional chord connects two points, each in different quadrants. So, each chord is like a "chord" that goes from one quadrant to another. So, each chord will cross through two quadrants.

But how does each chord intersect with the existing ones? Each chord is a line segment connecting two points on the perimeter, each in different quadrants. So, each chord can be thought of as a chord that doesn't necessarily cross the existing diameters, but it can cross other chords.

Wait, but all chords are connecting points in different quadrants, so each chord must cross the two diameters, right? Because the diameter divides the disk into two halves, so any chord connecting two points in different quadrants must cross the diameter.

Wait, actually, no. If the two points are in different quadrants, but not necessarily diametrically opposite. So, depending on where the points are, the chord might or might not cross the existing diameters.

Wait, the two diameters are already there, dividing the disk into four quadrants. So, each additional chord connects two points on the perimeter, each in different quadrants. So, these chords can be of two types: those that cross the existing diameters and those that don't. Wait, but actually, since each chord connects two points in different quadrants, which are separated by the diameters, so any chord that connects two points in different quadrants will have to cross one of the diameters, right?

Wait, let me think. Suppose the disk is divided into four quadrants by the x and y axes. If I pick a point in the first quadrant and another in the second quadrant, the chord connecting them will cross the y-axis. Similarly, connecting a first and third quadrant point will cross the origin, but wait, connecting first and third quadrant points would cross the negative x and y axes? Or is it just the x-axis?

Wait, no, actually, if you connect first and third quadrants, that chord would pass through the origin, which is where the diameters intersect. Similarly, connecting first and fourth quadrants would cross the x-axis, and connecting second and fourth would cross the y-axis.

Wait, so each chord connects two points in different quadrants, so each chord must pass through the origin? No, that can't be. Because if you connect two points in adjacent quadrants, their chord won't necessarily pass through the origin.

Wait, no, actually, if you connect two points on the perimeter in different quadrants, the chord might cross one of the diameters, but not necessarily both.

Wait, maybe not. Let me try to visualize. If I have four quadrants, separated by the x and y axes. If I pick a point in the first quadrant and another in the second quadrant, the chord connecting them will cross the y-axis somewhere. Similarly, picking a point in the first and third quadrants, the chord will cross the origin. Picking a point in the first and fourth quadrants, the chord will cross the x-axis somewhere. Similarly, points in second and fourth quadrants will cross the x-axis. Hmm, so depending on which quadrants the points are in, the chord will cross different diameters.

Wait, so each chord can cross either the x-axis, the y-axis, both, or neither? Wait, no, because if you connect two points in different quadrants, depending on the quadrants, you might cross one axis or both.

Wait, let me think again. If you connect first and second quadrants, the chord will cross the y-axis. If you connect first and third, it will cross the origin. If you connect first and fourth, it will cross the x-axis. Similarly, connecting second and fourth quadrants will cross the x-axis, and second and third quadrants will cross the y-axis, I think.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many diameters a chord can intersect. So, for two points in different quadrants, the chord can cross either one or both diameters.

Wait, actually, if two points are in adjacent quadrants, the chord will cross one diameter. If they are in opposite quadrants, it will cross both diameters.

Wait, yes, that makes sense. So, for example, connecting first and second quadrants: adjacent, chord crosses y-axis. Connecting first and third quadrants: opposite, chord crosses both x and y axes. Connecting first and fourth quadrants: adjacent, chord crosses x-axis.

So, in that case, each chord can cross 1 or 2 diameters, depending on the quadrants it connects.

But in our problem, the initial disk is divided into four quadrants, but we're adding 25 more chords, each connecting two points in different quadrants. So, each chord can be of two types: those that cross one diameter and those that cross both diameters.

Wait, but the problem says "different quadrants". So, if you connect two points in opposite quadrants, it's crossing both diameters, but if you connect two points in adjacent quadrants, it's crossing one diameter.

So, in our case, the 25 additional chords can be either crossing one diameter or both diameters.

But I'm not sure if that affects the expected number of regions. Maybe I need to calculate the expected number of intersections each new chord has with the existing ones.

Wait, because each time you add a chord, the number of new regions created is equal to the number of times the new chord intersects existing chords plus one.

So, for example, if a new chord doesn't intersect any existing chord, it will add one region. If it intersects one chord, it adds two regions, and so on.

Therefore, the expected number of regions after adding n chords is 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n} E[number of intersections for the k-th chord] + 1.

Wait, actually, the formula is R(n) = R(n-1) + E[number of intersections] + 1. So, starting from R(0)=1, each new chord adds E[i] + 1 regions, where E[i] is the expected number of intersections.

Wait, so more precisely, the expected number of regions after n chords is R(n) = 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n} (E[i_k] + 1), where E[i_k] is the expected number of intersections for the k-th chord.

But in our case, the chords are not arbitrary; they are constrained to connect two points in different quadrants. So, the probability that a new chord intersects an existing chord depends on the positions of the endpoints.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think in terms of linearity of expectation. The expected number of regions can be calculated by considering each pair of chords and the probability that they intersect, then summing over all pairs.

But wait, actually, the expected number of regions created by n chords is 1 + n + sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} E[intersection of chord i and chord j].

So, each pair of chords contributes 1 region if they intersect, otherwise 0. So, the expected number of intersections is the sum over all pairs of chords of the probability that they intersect.

So, the expected number of regions is R(n) = 1 + n + sum_{i < j} P(chord i intersects chord j).

Therefore, for our problem, we have n = 27 chords (initial 4 quadrants are 2 diameters, so 2 chords, then 25 more, so total 27). Wait, hold on, initial two diameters are two chords, but they are fixed, so do I need to include their intersections?

Wait, actually, the initial two diameters are also chords, so when we add the 25 more chords, each of these 25 can potentially intersect the existing two diameters as well as the other 24 chords.

Therefore, the total number of chords is 27, consisting of 2 diameters and 25 additional chords.

So, the expected number of regions is 1 + 27 + sum_{i < j} P(chord i and chord j intersect).

But wait, that formula is for n chords in general position, where the probability that two chords intersect is 1/3. Because for four random points on a circle, the probability that two chords intersect is 1/3.

But in our case, the chords are not random in the sense that each chord connects two points in different quadrants, which might affect the probability of intersection.

Wait, actually, each chord is selected by picking two random points on the perimeter, each in different quadrants. So, each chord is a chord that connects two points in different quadrants, but not necessarily uniformly random.

Wait, so are these chords more likely or less likely to intersect compared to random chords?

Hmm, that's a good question. If all chords are selected uniformly at random, the probability that two chords intersect is 1/3. But in our case, chords are constrained to connect two points in different quadrants.

So, how does that affect the probability of intersection?

I think it's a bit more structured. Each chord is a chord between two different quadrants, so each chord can be thought of as a chord in a specific "type". So, maybe we can categorize the chords based on which quadrants they connect.

There are four quadrants, so the number of types of chords is C(4,2)=6, but since we are only connecting points in different quadrants, each chord is of type (Q1,Q2), (Q1,Q3), (Q1,Q4), (Q2,Q3), (Q2,Q4), (Q3,Q4). So, six types.

But in our problem, each chord is selected by choosing two random points in different quadrants. So, perhaps each chord is uniformly random among all possible chords connecting different quadrants. But wait, maybe not, because depending on which quadrants the points are selected from, the chord might have different properties.

Wait, but since the points are selected uniformly at random on the perimeter, regardless of the quadrants, each chord is effectively a random chord, but constrained to connect different quadrants.

But in that case, maybe the probability of intersection is still 1/3. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

If I have two chords, each connecting two random points on the circle, in different quadrants, what is the probability that they intersect?

Wait, perhaps I can compute that.

So, suppose we have two chords, each connecting two points in different quadrants. Let's fix the first chord. Without loss of generality, let's say it connects Q1 and Q2. Then, the second chord connects two points, each in different quadrants. What's the probability that it intersects the first chord?

To compute this, we can fix the first chord, and then consider the positions of the second chord's endpoints.

Since the first chord is between Q1 and Q2, it divides the circle into two arcs: one from Q1 to Q2 through Q4 and Q3, and another from Q2 to Q1 through Q3 and Q4.

Wait, but actually, the chord between Q1 and Q2 would divide the circle into two arcs: one arc that's 270 degrees (from Q1 through Q4, Q3, Q2) and another arc of 90 degrees (from Q2 through Q1, which is just the chord itself).

Wait, no, actually, in a circle, a chord divides it into two arcs, each corresponding to the two sides of the chord.

So, the chord between Q1 and Q2 has one arc that goes from Q1 through Q4, Q3, Q2, which is 270 degrees, and another arc that goes from Q2 through Q1, which is 90 degrees.

Wait, no, actually, the chord between Q1 and Q2 in a four-quadrant system actually subtends 90 degrees on one side and 270 degrees on the other. Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, actually, the chord between Q1 and Q2 is just a straight line, and the two arcs it creates are each 180 degrees. Wait, no.

Wait, no, in a circle, any chord divides it into two arcs. The length of the arcs depends on the angle subtended by the chord at the center. So, the chord between Q1 and Q2 would subtend 90 degrees, so the two arcs would be 90 degrees and 270 degrees.

Wait, yes, exactly. So, the chord between Q1 and Q2 creates two arcs: one of 90 degrees (the minor arc) and one of 270 degrees (the major arc).

Therefore, when we choose the second chord, which connects two points in different quadrants, the probability that it intersects the first chord depends on where the endpoints are placed.

So, let's fix the first chord as Q1-Q2. Then, the second chord connects two points, each in different quadrants. So, the second chord can be of types: Q1-Q2, Q1-Q3, Q1-Q4, Q2-Q3, Q2-Q4, Q3-Q4. But since we're connecting different quadrants, it's one of the six types.

But since the first chord is Q1-Q2, let's see how the second chord can intersect it.

If the second chord is Q1-Q3, does it intersect Q1-Q2? Q1-Q3 connects Q1 and Q3, which are in opposite quadrants. The chord Q1-Q3 would cross the origin, and would it intersect Q1-Q2? Let me think.

In terms of the circle, the chord Q1-Q3 would cross the chord Q1-Q2 because they share a common endpoint Q1, but they are different chords. Wait, actually, two chords that share a common endpoint do not intersect unless they are the same chord. So, Q1-Q3 and Q1-Q2 share the point Q1, so they don't intersect elsewhere.

Similarly, a chord Q2-Q4 would share the point Q2 with Q1-Q2, so they also don't intersect elsewhere.

A chord Q3-Q4 would not share any endpoints with Q1-Q2, so it might intersect Q1-Q2. Let me think about that.

The chord Q3-Q4 is in the third and fourth quadrants, which are adjacent to Q2 and Q1 respectively. So, the chord Q3-Q4 would cross the chord Q1-Q2 because they are crossing different diameters. Wait, actually, chord Q3-Q4 is crossing the x-axis, while chord Q1-Q2 is crossing the y-axis, so they intersect at the center.

Wait, no, actually, chord Q1-Q2 is from Q1 to Q2, which is the same as the diameter. Wait, no, in the problem statement, the initial two diameters are already there, but the chords we add are not necessarily diameters.

Wait, hold on. The initial two diameters are part of the setup, but when we add chords, they are chords that connect two points on the perimeter, each in different quadrants. So, these chords are not necessarily diameters. So, in my earlier thinking, I considered the first chord as Q1-Q2, which is a diameter, but actually, when we add a chord, it's a chord connecting two random points in different quadrants, which may or may not be a diameter.

Wait, actually, if the two points are diametrically opposite, then the chord is a diameter. But the probability of that is zero because it's a continuous distribution.

So, in the case of adding a chord, we can assume it's not a diameter, so it doesn't pass through the center. Therefore, the chord Q1-Q2 is not a diameter but just a regular chord.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the initial two diameters divide the disk into four quadrants. Then, when we add chords, each chord connects two points in different quadrants, so each chord must cross one of the diameters, but not necessarily both.

Wait, so in that case, the first chord we add is a chord between two points in different quadrants, which crosses one of the diameters. Depending on which quadrants the points are in, it can cross either the x-axis or the y-axis.

Wait, but maybe I need to think of each chord as crossing one of the two diameters, so each chord is crossing one of the two existing diameters.

Therefore, each chord is intersecting one of the two original diameters, but not both.

Wait, so in that case, if I have a new chord, it can intersect either the x-axis or the y-axis, but not both. So, when adding a chord, it's crossing one of the two diameters.

Therefore, when considering intersections between chords, each new chord can only intersect existing diameters or existing chords.

But wait, the existing diameters are already there, so any new chord will intersect both diameters if it's crossing the center, but since the chord is not a diameter, it only crosses one of them.

Wait, actually, no. If the chord connects two points in different quadrants, it will cross both diameters if and only if the two points are in opposite quadrants. For example, connecting Q1 and Q3 would cross both diameters, but connecting Q1 and Q2 would cross only one diameter.

Wait, so if we have a chord that connects Q1 and Q3, it crosses both diameters, so it will intersect both existing diameters. Similarly, a chord connecting Q1 and Q4 will cross the x-axis, and a chord connecting Q2 and Q4 will cross the x-axis, etc.

Therefore, each chord can intersect either one or two existing diameters, depending on whether it connects adjacent or opposite quadrants.

Wait, so perhaps each chord can intersect 0, 1, or 2 diameters? But no, actually, each chord connects two points in different quadrants, so it must cross at least one diameter. Depending on the quadrants, it can cross one or two.

Wait, for example, connecting Q1 and Q2: crosses the y-axis. Connecting Q1 and Q3: crosses both x and y axes. Connecting Q1 and Q4: crosses the x-axis. Similarly, connecting Q2 and Q3: crosses the y-axis, Q2 and Q4: crosses the x-axis, Q3 and Q4: crosses both axes.

Wait, so actually, each chord either crosses one diameter (if it connects adjacent quadrants) or both diameters (if it connects opposite quadrants). So, each chord is either crossing the x-axis only, the y-axis only, or both.

Therefore, when adding a new chord, it can potentially intersect existing diameters or existing chords.

So, going back to the problem, the initial setup has two diameters, which are two chords. Then, we have 25 additional chords, each of which is either crossing one diameter or both.

So, when we add the k-th chord, it can intersect the two diameters or the existing chords. So, the expected number of intersections is the sum over all existing chords of the probability that the new chord intersects that chord.

But since the existing chords include the two diameters and the previous 24 chords, each with their own properties.

Wait, this is getting really complex. Maybe I need to break it down step by step.

First, let's note that the initial two diameters are fixed. Then, we have 25 additional chords, each of which is a chord connecting two random points in different quadrants.

Each such chord will intersect the existing diameters and the existing chords. So, for each new chord, the number of intersections it has with the existing structure is the number of existing chords it crosses.

But since the existing chords include the two diameters and the previous 25 chords, the probability that a new chord intersects an existing chord depends on the type of the existing chord.

Wait, but all existing chords are similar in the sense that they connect two points in different quadrants, just like the new chords.

Therefore, maybe the probability that a new chord intersects an existing chord is the same for all existing chords, regardless of their type.

Wait, is that true? If the existing chord is a diameter, then the new chord will intersect it with probability 1/2. If the existing chord is a non-diameter chord, then the probability that the new chord intersects it is different.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

If I have a diameter, which is a chord that divides the circle into two equal halves, then a new chord connecting two random points in different quadrants will cross this diameter with probability 1/2, because the two points are in different quadrants, so the chord is equally likely to be on either side of the diameter.

Wait, actually, if the diameter is fixed, say the y-axis, then the two points on the perimeter are in different quadrants, so one is on the left half and the other on the right half. So, the chord will cross the y-axis (the diameter) with probability 1, because it connects left and right.

Wait, no, hold on. If the diameter is the y-axis, and the chord connects two points in different quadrants, then if one point is in Q1 (right, upper) and the other in Q2 (left, upper), the chord connects right to left, crossing the y-axis. Similarly, if one point is in Q1 and the other in Q4 (right, lower), the chord connects right to right, but wait, that would be in the same half.

Wait, no, actually, Q4 is on the right side as well, but lower. So, connecting Q1 (right, upper) to Q4 (right, lower) would be a chord that's on the right half, not crossing the y-axis.

Wait, but in that case, the chord is entirely within the right half, so it doesn't cross the y-axis.

Wait, so actually, if the two points are in quadrants Q1 and Q4, which are both on the right half, then the chord connecting them doesn't cross the y-axis.

Similarly, connecting Q2 and Q3, which are both on the left half, doesn't cross the y-axis. So, in that case, the chord does not cross the y-axis.

Wait, so actually, only chords that connect quadrants on opposite sides of the y-axis cross the y-axis. Similarly, chords connecting quadrants on opposite sides of the x-axis cross the x-axis.

Therefore, for a given diameter, say the y-axis, the probability that a new chord crosses it is equal to the probability that the two points are on opposite sides of the y-axis.

Similarly, for the x-axis.

So, for the y-axis, the probability that a new chord crosses it is equal to the probability that one point is in the right half and the other is in the left half.

Since the points are selected uniformly at random on the perimeter, the probability that a point is in the right half is 1/2, and similarly for the left half. So, the probability that one point is in the right and the other in the left is 2*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/2. So, the probability that a new chord crosses the y-axis is 1/2.

Similarly, the probability that a new chord crosses the x-axis is 1/2.

But wait, actually, for any given diameter, the probability that a new chord crosses it is 1/2, because the two points are in different quadrants, so each chord is equally likely to be on either side of the diameter.

Wait, but actually, no. If we fix a diameter, say the y-axis, and we have a new chord connecting two points in different quadrants, the chord will cross the y-axis if and only if one point is in the right half and the other is in the left half.

Given that the points are selected uniformly at random, the probability that one point is in the right half and the other is in the left half is 1/2.

Similarly, for the x-axis, the probability that a new chord crosses it is 1/2.

Therefore, for each existing diameter, the probability that a new chord crosses it is 1/2.

But then, for a new chord, the probability that it crosses both diameters is the probability that it crosses the x-axis and the y-axis. Since the events are independent, it's 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

Wait, but are these events independent? Hmm, actually, no. Because if a chord crosses the x-axis, it's located in one of the top or bottom halves, but its position relative to the y-axis is still random.

Wait, actually, maybe the probability that a chord crosses both diameters is 1/4, since it needs to cross both the x-axis and the y-axis.

Wait, let's think. For a chord to cross both diameters, it needs to connect a point in Q1 to a point in Q3, or Q2 to Q4? No, wait, no. If a chord crosses both diameters, it must cross both the x-axis and the y-axis, meaning it must connect a point in one quadrant to another in a way that it passes through both axes.

Wait, but actually, no. A chord can cross both diameters only if it connects a point in Q1 to Q3, because that would cross both the x-axis and y-axis. Similarly, Q2 to Q4 would cross both diameters. So, the probability that a chord crosses both diameters is equal to the probability that it connects Q1-Q3 or Q2-Q4.

Since the two points are selected uniformly at random, the probability that one is in Q1 and the other in Q3 is (1/4)*(1/4) for each, but since they can be in any order, we have 2*(1/4)*(1/4) = 1/8. Similarly, for Q2-Q4, another 1/8. So, total probability is 1/4.

Therefore, the probability that a new chord crosses both diameters is 1/4, and the probability that it crosses only one diameter is 1/2, as we found earlier.

Therefore, for each new chord, the expected number of diameters it crosses is 1/2 * 1 + 1/4 * 2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, actually, the expected number of diameters crossed by a new chord is 1/2 * 1 + 1/4 * 2. So, 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, on average, each new chord crosses one diameter.

Wait, but that seems incorrect because crossing both diameters is a possibility, but the expectation is 1.

Wait, let me compute it correctly. The expected number of diameters crossed is equal to the probability of crossing the x-axis times 1 plus the probability of crossing the y-axis times 1. Since each is 1/2, the expectation is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, each new chord crosses one diameter on average.

Wait, but we also have the possibility of crossing both diameters, which would add an extra 1 to the expectation. So, actually, the expectation should be the probability of crossing one diameter times 1 plus the probability of crossing both diameters times 2.

So, the expectation is (1/2)*1 + (1/4)*2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, it still comes out to 1. So, each new chord is expected to cross one diameter. So, that seems consistent.

So, in total, each new chord is expected to cross one diameter. Additionally, it may cross existing chords, which are also non-diameter chords.

So, the total number of intersections that a new chord has is equal to the number of existing diameters it crosses plus the number of existing chords it crosses.

Since each new chord is expected to cross one diameter, and an expected number of existing chords, which is equal to the number of existing chords before it was added. Since we start with two diameters, then add 25 chords one by one, each new chord will have intersections with all the existing chords before it.

But wait, actually, the number of intersections a new chord has with existing chords is equal to the number of existing chords that it crosses. Since chords are added randomly, the probability that a new chord crosses an existing chord is equal to the probability that two random chords intersect, which is 1/3.

Wait, hold on. For two random chords in a circle, the probability that they intersect is 1/3. Is that correct?

Yes, in general, for two randomly chosen chords, the probability that they intersect is 1/3. Because there are three possible ways the four endpoints can be arranged around the circle, and only one of them results in the chords intersecting.

But in our case, all chords are not random; they connect points in different quadrants. So, does that affect the probability?

Wait, since each chord is constrained to connect points in different quadrants, maybe the probability is different.

Wait, let me think. If we fix the first chord, say connecting Q1 and Q2, then the second chord can be of six types. The probability that it intersects the first chord is equal to the number of chord types that intersect the first chord divided by the total number of chord types.

Wait, earlier, we saw that a chord connecting Q1 and Q3 would intersect the first chord. Similarly, a chord connecting Q2 and Q4 would intersect the first chord.

But let me think about the exact probability.

Suppose we have a chord C1 connecting Q1 and Q2. Now, we add another chord C2 connecting two random points in different quadrants. What is the probability that C2 crosses C1?

So, the four endpoints are Q1, Q2, and two other quadrants. So, depending on where C2 connects, it may cross C1.

Let me fix the first chord C1 as Q1-Q2. Then, the second chord C2 connects two points, say A and B, each in different quadrants.

To compute the probability that C2 crosses C1, we need to see how many such chords AB would cross C1.

So, for C2 to cross C1, the points A and B must be in Q3 and Q4, because then the chord AB would cross the chord C1.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, if A is in Q3 and B is in Q4, then chord AB would cross C1. But if A is in Q1 and B is in Q4, chord AB would not cross C1.

Wait, let me be precise. Let me fix chord C1 as Q1-Q2. Then, to cross C1, chord C2 must connect a point in Q3 to a point in Q4, because that's the only way the chord would cross C1.

Therefore, the probability that chord C2 crosses C1 is equal to the probability that A is in Q3 and B is in Q4, plus the probability that A is in Q4 and B is in Q3.

Since the points are chosen uniformly, the probability that A is in Q3 is 1/4, and B in Q4 is 1/4, so the probability is 2*(1/4)*(1/4) = 1/8.

Similarly, if chord C2 connects Q1 and Q3, does it cross C1? No, because it's connecting Q1 to Q3, which is adjacent to Q2.

Wait, no, actually, chord C2 connecting Q1 and Q3 would cross the y-axis, but not necessarily chord C1. Wait, chord C1 is Q1-Q2, which is a different chord.

Wait, if chord C2 is Q1-Q3, does it cross chord C1? Let me visualize. Q1 is at the top right, Q3 is at the bottom left. So, chord C2 is from top right to bottom left, which is a diagonal crossing the center. Chord C1 is from top right to the middle (since it's a diameter). Wait, no, chord C1 is Q1-Q2, which is a different chord.

Wait, actually, chord C1 is from Q1 to Q2, which is a diameter, but chord C2 is from Q1 to Q3, which is a different chord.

So, do they cross? Chord C1 is from Q1 to Q2 (top right to top left), chord C2 is from Q1 to Q3 (top right to bottom left). So, in the upper half, chord C1 goes from Q1 to Q2, chord C2 goes from Q1 to Q3, so they meet at Q1 but don't cross each other in the interior.

Similarly, chord C2 doesn't cross C1 because they share a common endpoint.

Wait, so chord C2 only crosses C1 if it connects Q3 and Q4, so that it passes through the center and crosses C1.

Therefore, the probability that chord C2 crosses C1 is equal to the probability that chord C2 connects Q3 and Q4.

Since chord C2 connects two random points in different quadrants, the number of ways it can connect Q3 and Q4 is 1 (since it's connecting Q3 and Q4), and the total number of ways it can connect any two different quadrants is C(4,2)=6.

Therefore, the probability is 1/6.

Wait, so for chord C2, the probability that it crosses chord C1 is 1/6.

Similarly, this would be the case for any two chords that connect opposite quadrants. Therefore, for two chords connecting opposite quadrants, the probability that they cross is 1/6.

But in our problem, the existing chords are not necessarily connecting opposite quadrants. The first two diameters are connecting opposite quadrants (Q1-Q2 and Q3-Q4). Then, the other chords are connecting two random points in different quadrants.

Wait, actually, no. The initial two diameters are fixed, connecting Q1-Q2 and Q3-Q4. Then, the additional chords are connecting two random points in different quadrants, each chord can be of the six types.

So, when we add a new chord, it's of one of the six types: Q1-Q2, Q1-Q3, Q1-Q4, Q2-Q3, Q2-Q4, Q3-Q4. But actually, the first two diameters are already there, so the other chords are different.

Wait, actually, no, the two diameters are fixed, but the other chords are added on top of them. So, the existing chords include the two diameters and the 24 chords that have been added before the current one.

So, when adding a new chord, it can cross any of the existing diameters or any of the existing chords.

So, the expected number of intersections for the new chord is equal to the number of existing diameters it crosses plus the number of existing chords it crosses.

Since each existing diameter is crossed with probability 1/2, as we established earlier, and each existing chord is crossed with probability 1/6, assuming that chords are independent.

But wait, is that the case?

Wait, actually, for each existing chord, which is a random chord connecting two points in different quadrants, the probability that a new chord crosses it is 1/6, as established earlier.

Therefore, the expected number of intersections for the new chord is equal to the number of existing diameters times 1/2 plus the number of existing chords times 1/6.

But we have to consider that each existing diameter is crossed with probability 1/2, and each existing chord is crossed with probability 1/6.

But in our case, when adding the k-th chord, there are already two diameters, and k-2 chords that have been added before. Therefore, the expected number of intersections is 2*(1/2) + (k-2)*(1/6) = 1 + (k-2)/6.

Therefore, the expected number of new regions created by adding the k-th chord is equal to 1 + the number of intersections. So, the expected number of regions after adding the k-th chord is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{k} [1 + (i-2)/6].

Wait, no, actually, the expected number of regions after n chords is 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n} E[i_k], where E[i_k] is the expected number of intersections for the k-th chord.

But in our case, the initial two diameters are fixed, and then we have 25 additional chords. So, the total number of regions would be 1 (the whole disk) + sum_{k=1}^{25} E[i_k], where E[i_k] is the expected number of intersections for the k-th additional chord.

But wait, actually, we need to include the two diameters in our initial setup. So, the initial number of regions is 4, created by two diameters.

Then, each additional chord can intersect the two diameters and the previous chords.

So, starting with 4 regions, each new chord can add regions based on the number of intersections.

But let's think again.

The formula for the expected number of regions after adding n chords is R(n) = R(n-1) + E[i_n] + 1, where E[i_n] is the expected number of intersections for the n-th chord.

But the initial formula we thought was R(n) = 1 + n + sum_{1 <= i < j <=n} P(chord i intersects chord j).

But in our case, the initial two diameters are fixed, so the first chord is added to the two diameters.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the initial setup.

We have the disk divided into four quadrants by two diameters. Then, we add 25 chords, each connecting two points in different quadrants.

The total number of regions created by these 25 chords can be calculated by considering the initial four regions, and then each chord adds some regions.

So, starting with four regions, each chord can intersect existing chords and diameters, and each intersection can potentially create a new region.

But actually, in general, each time a chord is added, it can intersect all the previous chords and diameters, and each intersection can create a new region. The exact formula is R(n) = R(n-1) + E[i_n] + 1, where E[i_n] is the expected number of intersections.

But since the initial two diameters are already there, when we add the first chord, it can intersect both diameters, so E[i_1] = 1, as each new chord can intersect one diameter on average, as we saw earlier.

Wait, actually, for the first chord, we have two diameters, so the probability that it crosses each diameter is 1/2, so the expected number of intersections is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

Similarly, for the second chord, it can intersect the two diameters and the first chord. So, expected number of intersections is 1 (from diameters) + 1/6 (from the first chord) = 7/6.

Wait, but hold on, for the second chord, it can intersect the two diameters each with probability 1/2, so 1, and the first chord with probability 1/6, so total expected intersections is 7/6.

Similarly, for the third chord, expected intersections would be 1 (from diameters) + 2*(1/6) (from the two existing chords) = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. For each existing chord, the probability that the new chord intersects it is 1/6. So, for the third chord, you have two existing chords, each with probability 1/6 of being intersected. So, expected intersections from existing chords is 2*(1/6) = 1/3. Plus the expected number of intersections from diameters, which is 1. So, total expected intersections is 1 + 1/3 = 4/3.

Similarly, for the fourth chord, it would be 1 (from diameters) + 3*(1/6) = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.

Wait, so in general, for the k-th chord, the expected number of intersections is 1 + (k-1)*(1/6).

Therefore, the total expected number of regions is R = 4 + sum_{k=1}^{25} [1 + (k-1)/6].

Because we start with four regions, and each new chord adds 1 plus the number of intersections, which is 1 + (k-1)/6.

Therefore, sum_{k=1}^{25} [1 + (k-1)/6] = sum_{k=1}^{25} 1 + sum_{k=1}^{25} (k-1)/6.

Calculating the first sum: 25*1 = 25.

Calculating the second sum: sum_{k=1}^{25} (k-1)/6 = (1/6) * sum_{m=0}^{24} m = (1/6)*[24*25/2] = (1/6)*(300) = 50.

Therefore, the total sum is 25 + 50 = 75.

Therefore, the expected number of regions is 4 + 75 = 79.

Wait, so is the expected number of regions 79?

But let me check my logic again.

We start with four regions. Each chord added can intersect the existing diameters and existing chords. For each chord, the expected number of intersections is 1 (from diameters) plus (number of existing chords) * 1/6.

Wait, but in our formula above, for the k-th chord, the expected number of intersections is 1 + (k - 1)/6, where k is from 1 to 25.

Wait, actually, no. For the k-th chord, the number of existing chords before it is (k - 1). So, the expected number of intersections from existing chords is (k - 1)*(1/6). Plus, the expected number of intersections from diameters, which is 1. So, total intersections is 1 + (k - 1)/6.

Therefore, the expected number of regions added by the k-th chord is 1 + intersections.

Wait, no, the formula for regions is R(n) = R(n-1) + E[i_n] + 1, but E[i_n] is the number of intersections, which is already the number of times the new chord crosses existing structures.

Wait, actually, the formula is that each intersection creates a new region. So, if a chord intersects m existing chords, it adds m + 1 regions.

Wait, yes, that's correct. Because a chord that doesn't intersect any existing chords adds 1 region. If it intersects m chords, it passes through m + 1 regions, thereby adding m + 1 regions.

So, actually, the number of regions added by the k-th chord is 1 + E[i_k], where E[i_k] is the expected number of intersections.

Therefore, starting with four regions, each chord k adds 1 + E[i_k] regions. So, the total expected number of regions is 4 + sum_{k=1}^{25} (1 + E[i_k]).

So, E[i_k] for each chord is the expected number of intersections, which is 1 (from diameters) + (k - 1)*(1/6) (from existing chords). Therefore, the number of regions added by chord k is 1 + [1 + (k - 1)/6] = 2 + (k - 1)/6.

Wait, that seems different. Wait, no, the number of regions added is 1 + E[i_k], where E[i_k] is the expected number of intersections. So, if E[i_k] is 1 + (k - 1)/6, then regions added is 1 + 1 + (k - 1)/6 = 2 + (k - 1)/6.

But this seems inconsistent. Maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, actually, let's think about it step by step.

When you add a chord, the number of regions it adds is equal to the number of times it crosses existing structures plus one. That is, each intersection creates an additional region.

So, for example, a chord that doesn't cross any existing structures adds 1 region. A chord that crosses m existing chords adds m + 1 regions.

Therefore, the expected number of regions added by the k-th chord is E[regions added] = 1 + E[i_k], where E[i_k] is the expected number of intersections.

But earlier, we found that E[i_k] = 1 + (k - 1)/6. So, regions added by the k-th chord is 1 + [1 + (k - 1)/6] = 2 + (k - 1)/6.

Therefore, the total expected number of regions is:

R = 4 + sum_{k=1}^{25} [2 + (k - 1)/6].

Calculating this:

First, compute sum_{k=1}^{25} 2 = 25*2 = 50.

Second, compute sum_{k=1}^{25} (k - 1)/6 = (1/6) * sum_{m=0}^{24} m = (1/6)*(24*25)/2 = (1/6)*300 = 50.

Therefore, the total sum is 50 + 50 = 100.

Therefore, R = 4 + 100 = 104.

So, the expected number of regions is 104.

Wait, but let me see if that makes sense.

Wait, another way to compute the expected number of regions is to use the formula:

R(n) = R(n-1) + E[i_n] + 1.

But starting from four regions, each chord adds 1 + E[i_k] regions.

Wait, but as we saw earlier, E[i_k] for the k-th chord is 1 + (k - 1)/6.

Therefore, regions added by chord k is 2 + (k - 1)/6.

So, summing from k=1 to 25:

sum_{k=1}^{25} [2 + (k - 1)/6] = sum_{k=1}^{25} 2 + sum_{k=1}^{25} (k - 1)/6.

Which is 50 + 50 = 100. So, total regions is 4 + 100 = 104.

Alternatively, if I think about it as each chord can intersect the two diameters and all previous chords. So, for the first chord, it can intersect both diameters, so 2 intersections, adding 3 regions.

Wait, actually, no, when a chord crosses two diameters, how many regions does it add? It actually crosses two diameters, which are two lines, so the chord would cross two lines, creating three regions? Wait, no.

Wait, actually, a chord that crosses two diameters divides the disk into four regions. Wait, no, actually, a chord that crosses two diameters is a diameter itself, so it doesn't add any regions beyond the initial four. Wait, no, if you add a chord that crosses two diameters, which are already there, the chord would pass through four regions, dividing each into two, so adding four regions.

Wait, maybe I need to think about it differently.

Wait, let me go back to the general formula for regions formed by lines.

In the case of n lines, the maximum number of regions is (n^2 + n + 2)/2. But in our case, the lines are not all in general position.

But each chord can intersect the two diameters and the other chords.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula:

R = 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n} (number of intersections for the k-th chord + 1).

But in our case, starting with four regions, R = 4 + sum_{k=1}^{25} (E[i_k] + 1).

So, for each chord, E[i_k] is the expected number of intersections, and each intersection adds a region. So, the number of regions added is E[i_k] + 1.

But from our earlier computation, E[i_k] = 1 + (k - 1)/6.

Therefore, number of regions added is 1 + [1 + (k - 1)/6] = 2 + (k - 1)/6.

Therefore, sum_{k=1}^{25} [2 + (k - 1)/6] = 50 + 50 = 100.

Therefore, R = 4 + 100 = 104.

So, the expected number of regions is 104.

But wait, let me verify this with a simpler case.

Suppose we have only the two diameters, which divide the disk into four regions. Then, we add one chord. What's the expected number of regions?

If we add a chord that doesn't cross any diameters, it adds one region. If it crosses both diameters, it adds three regions. But actually, a chord cannot cross both diameters unless it's a diameter itself, which it's not because we're adding chords that connect different quadrants.

Wait, no, actually, a chord can cross both diameters only if it passes through the center, which would make it a diameter, but since we are adding chords that connect different quadrants, they can be diameters or non-diameters.

But in our problem, we are adding chords that connect two random points in different quadrants. So, a chord can be a diameter (if the two points are opposite) or a non-diameter (if they are adjacent).

Therefore, the probability that a new chord is a diameter is some probability, and otherwise, it's a non-diameter.

Wait, but in our case, the initial two diameters are already present. So, when adding a new chord, it can be a diameter or a non-diameter.

Wait, but actually, in the problem statement, it's said that he draws 25 more line segments by selecting two points on the perimeter, drawing each segment by selecting two points at random on the perimeter in different quadrants.

So, each new chord connects two random points in different quadrants. So, it can be a diameter with probability 0, since it's connecting two random points, unless they happen to be opposite. But the probability of that is zero in continuous probability.

Wait, no, actually, it's not zero. Because in continuous probability, the chance of selecting exactly the opposite point is zero. So, effectively, all new chords are non-diameters.

Therefore, each new chord is a non-diameter, so it cannot cross both diameters unless it's passing through the center, which is not the case.

Wait, so each new chord is a non-diameter, so it can intersect at most one diameter.

Therefore, for each new chord, the expected number of intersections with existing diameters is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, each new chord crosses one diameter on average.

Similarly, the expected number of intersections with existing chords is (k - 1)*(1/6).

Therefore, E[i_k] = 1 + (k - 1)/6.

Therefore, the expected number of regions added by the k-th chord is 1 + E[i_k] = 1 + 1 + (k - 1)/6 = 2 + (k - 1)/6.

Therefore, starting with four regions, the total expected number of regions is 4 + sum_{k=1}^{25} [2 + (k - 1)/6] = 4 + 50 + 50 = 104.

So, yeah, 104 is the expected number of regions.

Therefore, after all this thinking, I believe the answer is 104.

**Final Answer**
The expected number of regions is \boxed{104}.
</think>

Alex divides a disk into four quadrants with two perpendicular diameters. He then draws 25 more line segments by selecting two random points on the perimeter of the disk in different quadrants. We need to find the expected number of regions into which these 27 line segments divide the disk.

1. **Initial Setup**: The disk is divided into four quadrants by two diameters, giving an initial number of regions as 4.

2. **Adding Chords**: Each new chord connects two random points in different quadrants. Each chord can intersect existing diameters and other chords.

3. **Expected Intersections**:
   - Each chord intersects the two diameters with an expected value of 1.
   - Each chord can intersect existing chords with an expected value of \(\frac{k-1}{6}\) for the \(k\)-th chord.

4. **Expected Regions Added**:
   - For each chord, the expected number of intersections is \(1 + \frac{k-1}{6}\).
   - The expected number of regions added by the \(k\)-th chord is \(1 + \left(1 + \frac{k-1}{6}\right) = 2 + \frac{k-1}{6}\).

5. **Summing Up**:
   - Summing the expected regions added by each of the 25 chords:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{25} \left(2 + \frac{k-1}{6}\right) = \sum_{k=1}^{25} 2 + \sum_{k=1}^{25} \frac{k-1}{6}
     \]
   - Calculating the sums:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{25} 2 = 25 \times 2 = 50
     \]
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{25} \frac{k-1}{6} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{m=0}^{24} m = \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{24 \times 25}{2} = \frac{1}{6} \times 300 = 50
     \]
   - Total sum:
     \[
     50 + 50 = 100
     \]

6. **Total Regions**:
   - Starting with 4 regions, the total expected number of regions is:
     \[
     4 + 100 = 104
     \]

Thus, the expected number of regions into which the disk is divided is \(\boxed{104}\).
