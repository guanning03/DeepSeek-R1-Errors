Wrong Answer:
Alright, I'm going to try to figure out this problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand.

We have a plane in 3D space defined by the equation x + y + z = 75. On this plane, we're looking at the set of points whose coordinates satisfy the inequalities x - yz < y - zx < z - xy. These points form three disjoint convex regions, and only one of them has a finite area. We need to find the area of this finite region, express it in the form a√b, and then find a + b.

Okay, so first, the plane x + y + z = 75. That's a flat surface in 3D space. Any point on this plane will satisfy that equation.

Now, the inequalities: x - yz < y - zx < z - xy. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me try to parse it.

We have three expressions:

1. x - yz
2. y - zx
3. z - xy

And the inequalities are x - yz < y - zx < z - xy.

So, the first inequality is x - yz < y - zx, and the second is y - zx < z - xy.

Our goal is to find all points (x, y, z) on the plane x + y + z = 75 that satisfy these inequalities, and these points form three convex regions. But only one of them has a finite area, and we need to find that area.

Let me try to simplify these inequalities.

Starting with the first inequality: x - yz < y - zx.

Let me rearrange this:

x - yz - y + zx < 0

Factor terms:

x + zx - y - yz < 0

Factor x from the first two terms and -y from the next two:

x(1 + z) - y(1 + z) < 0

Factor out (1 + z):

(1 + z)(x - y) < 0

So, (1 + z)(x - y) < 0.

Similarly, let's do the same for the second inequality: y - zx < z - xy.

Rearrange:

y - zx - z + xy < 0

Factor terms:

y + xy - z - zx < 0

Factor y(1 + x) - z(1 + x) < 0

Factor out (1 + x):

(1 + x)(y - z) < 0

So, now we have two inequalities:

1. (1 + z)(x - y) < 0
2. (1 + x)(y - z) < 0

So, let me write them again:

1. (1 + z)(x - y) < 0
2. (1 + x)(y - z) < 0

Hmm, okay. So, these are our conditions.

Let me analyze each inequality.

Starting with the first inequality: (1 + z)(x - y) < 0.

This product is negative, meaning either (1 + z) is positive and (x - y) is negative, or (1 + z) is negative and (x - y) is positive.

Similarly, the second inequality: (1 + x)(y - z) < 0.

Again, either (1 + x) is positive and (y - z) is negative, or (1 + x) is negative and (y - z) is positive.

So, let's consider possible cases.

Case 1: Both (1 + z) and (x - y) are negative, so that (1 + z)(x - y) < 0.

Similarly, both (1 + x) and (y - z) are negative, so that (1 + x)(y - z) < 0.

Case 2: (1 + z) positive and (x - y) negative, and (1 + x) positive and (y - z) negative.

Case 3: (1 + z) negative and (x - y) positive, and (1 + x) negative and (y - z) positive.

These are the possibilities. Let me consider each case.

Case 1:

1 + z < 0 and x - y < 0
1 + x < 0 and y - z < 0

So, from 1 + z < 0: z < -1

x - y < 0 implies x < y

From 1 + x < 0: x < -1

y - z < 0 implies y < z

So, putting together:

z < -1

x < y

x < -1

y < z

Wait, but z < -1, and y < z, so y < z < -1

Also, x < -1 and x < y, so x < -1 and y > x, but y < z < -1

So, x < -1, y is between x and z, but z is less than -1.

So, x < y < z < -1.

Is that possible? Let me see.

So, x is less than y, y is less than z, and z is less than -1.

So, that would mean x < y < z < -1.

Okay, that's a possible ordering.

Case 2:

1 + z > 0 and x - y < 0

1 + x > 0 and y - z < 0

So, 1 + z > 0 implies z > -1

x - y < 0 implies x < y

1 + x > 0 implies x > -1

y - z < 0 implies y < z

So, putting together:

z > -1

x < y

x > -1

y < z

So, x > -1, x < y < z, z > -1

So, -1 < x < y < z

Case 3:

1 + z < 0 and x - y > 0

1 + x < 0 and y - z > 0

So, 1 + z < 0 implies z < -1

x - y > 0 implies x > y

1 + x < 0 implies x < -1

y - z > 0 implies y > z

Putting together:

z < -1

x > y

x < -1

y > z

So, x > y > z

But z < -1, so y must be greater than z but less than x, and x is less than -1.

So, z < y < x < -1

So, another ordering: z < y < x < -1

So, now, we have three cases:

Case 1: x < y < z < -1

Case 2: -1 < x < y < z

Case 3: z < y < x < -1

So, we have three regions, each corresponding to an ordering of x, y, z.

But in the problem statement, it says these points form three disjoint convex regions, so each case corresponds to a convex region.

But only one of them has finite area.

So, we need to figure out which of these cases corresponds to a bounded region (finite area) and compute its area.

First, perhaps I should figure out which case is bounded.

Looking at the plane x + y + z = 75, which is a plane in 3D space. So, the intersection of this plane with the regions defined by the inequalities will give us regions on the plane.

Each case, such as x < y < z < -1, corresponds to a region on the plane.

But let's see: The plane x + y + z = 75. Since x + y + z is 75, which is a positive number, and in the case where z < -1, but x + y + z = 75, which is positive, so if z is less than -1, x and y must be sufficiently large to compensate.

Wait, but in Case 1: x < y < z < -1.

But z < -1, so x + y + z = 75. If z is less than -1, then x + y = 75 - z > 75 + 1 = 76.

So, x + y > 76.

But in Case 1, x < y < z < -1, so x and y are both less than z, which is less than -1.

But x + y > 76, but x and y are both less than z, which is less than -1. So, how can x and y add up to something greater than 76 if they are both less than -1? That seems impossible because two negative numbers can't add up to a positive number like 76.

So, Case 1: x < y < z < -1 is impossible because x and y are both less than z, which is less than -1, so x and y are both negative, but x + y + z = 75, which is positive. So, x + y = 75 - z.

If z < -1, then x + y = 75 - z > 75 + 1 = 76.

But x < y < z < -1, so x and y are both less than z < -1, so x and y are both less than -1, so x + y < -2, but 75 - z > 76, which would imply x + y > 76, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Similarly, Case 3: z < y < x < -1, same reasoning.

In Case 3, z < y < x < -1, so all three variables are less than -1.

Then, x + y + z = 75. But if x, y, z are all less than -1, their sum would be less than -3, but 75 is positive. Contradiction.

Therefore, only Case 2 is possible.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the set of points forms three disjoint convex regions. So, maybe my initial analysis is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that these inequalities define three regions, but perhaps not all cases are possible.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the inequalities.

Wait, the inequalities are x - yz < y - zx < z - xy.

So, x - yz < y - zx and y - zx < z - xy.

I transformed both inequalities into (1 + z)(x - y) < 0 and (1 + x)(y - z) < 0.

But perhaps I should consider the sign of (1 + z) and (1 + x) in relation to the inequalities.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better.

Let me think of the inequalities as:

First inequality: x - yz < y - zx.

Let me rearrange this as x - y < yz - zx.

So, x - y < z(y - x)

Which can be written as x - y < -z(x - y)

So, x - y + z(x - y) < 0

Factor out (x - y):

(1 + z)(x - y) < 0

Which is what I had before.

Similarly, the second inequality: y - zx < z - xy.

Rearranged as y - z < zx - xy.

Which is y - z < -x(z - y)

So, y - z + x(z - y) < 0

Factor out (y - z):

(1 + x)(y - z) < 0

So, same result.

So, the two inequalities are:

1. (1 + z)(x - y) < 0

2. (1 + x)(y - z) < 0

So, these inequalities define regions on the plane.

Now, let me consider the plane x + y + z = 75.

We can parametrize this plane to make things easier.

Since it's a 2D plane, we can express two variables in terms of the third.

But since all three variables are involved, maybe using barycentric coordinates or something.

Alternatively, we can set two variables as free variables, express the third as 75 - x - y, and then rewrite the inequalities in terms of x and y.

But before that, perhaps it's better to analyze the inequalities.

Let me see.

From inequality 1: (1 + z)(x - y) < 0

So, either 1 + z > 0 and x - y < 0, or 1 + z < 0 and x - y > 0.

Similarly, from inequality 2: (1 + x)(y - z) < 0

Either 1 + x > 0 and y - z < 0, or 1 + x < 0 and y - z > 0.

So, let me consider the four possible cases:

Case A: 1 + z > 0 and 1 + x > 0

Case B: 1 + z > 0 and 1 + x < 0

Case C: 1 + z < 0 and 1 + x > 0

Case D: 1 + z < 0 and 1 + x < 0

But in our problem, since the inequalities are strict, maybe some cases are impossible.

Wait, in Case A: 1 + z > 0 and 1 + x > 0, so z > -1 and x > -1.

From inequality 1: x - y < 0 => x < y

From inequality 2: y - z < 0 => y < z

Therefore, Case A gives x < y < z

But on the plane x + y + z =75, and x < y < z.

But with x > -1, y > -1, z > -1.

Wait, but if x, y, z are all greater than -1, but x + y + z =75, which is positive. So, in this case, x, y, z can be positive or some negative, but their sum is 75. But since all are greater than -1, perhaps this is feasible.

Case B: 1 + z > 0 and 1 + x < 0.

So, z > -1 and x < -1.

From inequality 1: x - y < 0 => x < y

From inequality 2: y - z < 0 => y < z

So, in this case, x < y < z, but x < -1 and z > -1.

So, x < -1 < z, but y is between x and z.

Case C: 1 + z < 0 and 1 + x > 0

So, z < -1 and x > -1

From inequality 1: x - y > 0 => x > y

From inequality 2: y - z > 0 => y > z

So, in this case, x > y > z, with z < -1 and x > -1.

Case D: 1 + z < 0 and 1 + x < 0

So, z < -1 and x < -1

From inequality 1: x - y > 0 => x > y

From inequality 2: y - z > 0 => y > z

So, x > y > z, with x < -1 and z < -1

But earlier, when I considered these cases, in Cases 1, 3, and 4, I ran into contradictions because it's impossible for x and y to be both less than -1 and add up with z (which is also less than -1) to 75.

So, that suggests that Cases C and D are impossible because they lead to a contradiction. Therefore, only Cases A and B are possible.

Wait, but the problem statement says the set of points forms three disjoint convex regions. So, maybe my analysis is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the inequalities differently.

Wait, maybe each inequality x - yz < y - zx and y - zx < z - xy can be split into two separate inequalities, leading to different regions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the inequalities in terms of ordering.

Let me consider the inequalities:

x - yz < y - zx

and

y - zx < z - xy

Let me denote A = x - yz, B = y - zx, C = z - xy.

So, A < B < C.

So, A < B implies x - yz < y - zx

Which simplifies to (1 + z)(x - y) < 0, as before.

Similarly, B < C implies y - zx < z - xy

Which simplifies to (1 + x)(y - z) < 0, as before.

So, perhaps the key is to figure out the ordering of x, y, z based on these inequalities.

In Case A: 1 + z > 0 and 1 + x > 0, leading to x < y < z.

In Case B: 1 + z > 0 and 1 + x < 0, leading to x < y < z, but x < -1, y can be between -1 and z, which is greater than -1.

Wait, so in Case B, x < -1, y is between x and z, with z > -1.

So, in this case, x is less than -1, y is greater than x but less than z, which is greater than -1.

So, x < -1 < y < z

So, that's another ordering.

Wait, so in Case A, we have x < y < z, all greater than -1.

In Case B, we have x < -1 < y < z.

Similarly, in Case C, which was z < -1 and x > -1, but that led to a contradiction. Similarly, Case D also led to a contradiction.

So, perhaps Cases A and B are the only possible cases.

So, on the plane x + y + z =75, we have two regions:

1. x < y < z, all greater than -1

2. x < -1 < y < z

Each of these regions is convex?

Wait, but the problem says three disjoint convex regions. So, perhaps my initial analysis is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should also consider the cases where (1 + z)(x - y) < 0 and (1 + x)(y - z) < 0, but with different signs.

Wait, let me think of the four quadrants for the inequalities.

Each inequality can be thought of as a product being negative, so each divides the plane into two regions.

So, the intersection of these two inequalities would split the plane into four regions.

But since the inequalities are strict, each inequality is a hyperplane.

Wait, but I'm dealing with two inequalities in a 2D plane, so the intersection would split it into four regions.

But the problem states three disjoint convex regions.

Hmm, perhaps one of the regions is unbounded, and the other two are bounded.

But in the problem statement, it says that exactly one of those regions has finite area.

So, perhaps two of them are unbounded, and one is bounded.

But how?

Wait, maybe when we look at the inequalities, they form three regions, one of which is bounded.

Wait, perhaps I need to visualize the plane x + y + z =75.

This is a plane in 3D space, and the inequalities further divide this plane into regions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the plane.

Let me try to parameterize it.

Let me set z = 75 - x - y.

So, we can express all variables in terms of x and y.

Then, the inequalities become:

1. x - y(75 - x - y) < y - x(75 - x - y)

2. y - x(75 - x - y) < (75 - x - y) - xy

Let me work through these inequalities.

First, let me compute the first inequality:

x - y(75 - x - y) < y - x(75 - x - y)

Simplify left side:

x - 75y + xy + y²

Right side:

y - 75x + x² + xy

So, the inequality becomes:

x -75y + xy + y² < y -75x + x² + xy

Subtract xy from both sides:

x -75y + y² < y -75x + x²

Bring all terms to left:

x -75y + y² - y +75x - x² < 0

Combine like terms:

( x + 75x ) + ( -75y - y ) + ( y² - x² ) < 0

So:

76x -76y + y² - x² < 0

Factor:

76(x - y) + (y² - x²) < 0

Note that y² - x² = (y - x)(y + x) = -(x - y)(x + y)

So, 76(x - y) - (x - y)(x + y) < 0

Factor out (x - y):

(x - y)(76 - (x + y)) < 0

So, (x - y)(76 - x - y) < 0

Similarly, let's do the second inequality.

Second inequality: y - x(75 - x - y) < (75 - x - y) - xy

Simplify left side:

y -75x + x² + xy

Right side:

75 -x - y - xy

So, the inequality becomes:

y -75x + x² + xy < 75 -x - y - xy

Bring all terms to left:

y -75x + x² + xy -75 +x + y + xy < 0

Combine like terms:

(-75x + x) + (y + y) + x² + xy + xy -75 < 0

So:

(-74x) + (2y) + x² + 2xy -75 < 0

Hmm, that seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I can rewrite the first inequality as (x - y)(76 - x - y) < 0, which is similar to the earlier result.

So, the first inequality is (x - y)(76 - x - y) < 0.

So, this tells us that (x - y) and (76 - x - y) must have opposite signs.

Similarly, perhaps I can write similar expressions for the second inequality.

Wait, let me try to see if I can express the second inequality in a similar factored form.

So, the second inequality is:

y - x(75 - x - y) < (75 - x - y) - xy

Which simplifies to:

y -75x + x² + xy < 75 -x - y - xy

Bring all terms to the left:

y -75x + x² + xy -75 +x + y + xy < 0

So, group terms:

x² + ( -75x + x ) + ( y + y ) + (xy + xy ) -75 < 0

Which is:

x² -74x + 2y + 2xy -75 < 0

Hmm, this seems a bit messy.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the first inequality and the second inequality together.

We have:

1. (x - y)(76 - x - y) < 0

2. The second inequality which I have to work on.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the plane x + y + z =75.

Since z =75 -x - y, we can write all variables in terms of x and y.

So, perhaps we can plot this on the x-y plane.

But 76 - x - y is 76 - (x + y) = 76 - (75 - z) = 76 -75 + z = 1 + z.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, in the first inequality, I had:

(x - y)(76 - x - y) < 0

But since z =75 -x - y, so 76 -x - y = 76 - (75 - z) = 1 + z

Therefore, the first inequality is:

(x - y)(1 + z) < 0

Which is consistent with the earlier result.

Similarly, perhaps the second inequality can be expressed as:

(y - z)(1 + x) < 0

Wait, wait, let me check.

Wait, the second inequality was (1 + x)(y - z) < 0.

But in terms of x and y, since z =75 -x - y, we can write:

(1 + x)(y - (75 -x - y)) < 0

Simplify inside the second term:

y -75 +x + y = x + 2y -75

So, the second inequality is:

(1 + x)(x + 2y -75) < 0

So, now, we have two inequalities in terms of x and y:

1. (x - y)(1 + z) < 0, but z =75 -x - y, so:

(x - y)(1 + 75 -x - y) < 0

Which is:

(x - y)(76 -x - y) < 0

2. (1 + x)(x + 2y -75) < 0

So, now, we have two inequalities in x and y:

1. (x - y)(76 -x - y) < 0

2. (1 + x)(x + 2y -75) < 0

This is progress.

So, let me write them again:

Inequality 1: (x - y)(76 -x - y) < 0

Inequality 2: (1 + x)(x + 2y -75) < 0

Now, let's analyze Inequality 1.

Inequality 1: (x - y)(76 -x - y) < 0

So, the product is negative, meaning either:

- (x - y) > 0 and (76 -x - y) < 0

OR

- (x - y) < 0 and (76 -x - y) > 0

Similarly, Inequality 2: (1 + x)(x + 2y -75) < 0

So, either:

- (1 + x) > 0 and (x + 2y -75) < 0

OR

- (1 + x) < 0 and (x + 2y -75) > 0

So, now, we can have four cases:

Case 1:

1. x - y > 0 and 76 -x - y < 0

2. 1 + x > 0 and x + 2y -75 < 0

Case 2:

1. x - y > 0 and 76 -x - y > 0

2. 1 + x < 0 and x + 2y -75 > 0

Case 3:

1. x - y < 0 and 76 -x - y < 0

2. 1 + x > 0 and x + 2y -75 < 0

Case 4:

1. x - y < 0 and 76 -x - y > 0

2. 1 + x < 0 and x + 2y -75 > 0

So, four cases in total.

But given that x + y + z =75, which is quite a large number, so I can assume that 76 -x - y =1 + z is positive or negative depending on z.

Wait, z can be any real number, so 1 + z can be positive or negative.

Similarly, x + 2y -75 can be positive or negative.

But perhaps some cases are impossible.

So, let me analyze each case.

Case 1:

1. x - y > 0 => x > y

2. 76 -x - y < 0 => x + y >76

3. 1 + x > 0 => x > -1

4. x + 2y -75 < 0 => x + 2y <75

So, in this case:

x > y

x + y >76

x > -1

x + 2y <75

So, let's see if these can coexist.

From x + y >76 and x + 2y <75.

Subtract the first inequality from the second:

(x + 2y) - (x + y) <75 -76

Which is y < -1

So, y < -1

But in Case 1, we have x > y, x > -1, and y < -1.

So, x > -1, y < -1, and x > y.

So, x can be greater than -1, y less than -1, and x > y.

But x + y >76, which would require x to be quite large.

Let me see:

y < -1, so let's say y = -2.

Then x > -1, and x > y (so x > -2), and x + y >76.

So, x + (-2) >76 => x >78.

But also, x + 2*(-2) =x -4 <75 => x <79.

So, x must satisfy 78 < x <79.

Similarly, if y = -k, k >1, then:

x > -1

x + y >76 => x >76 - y

x + 2y <75 => x <75 -2y

So, to satisfy x >76 - y and x <75 -2y, we have:

76 - y <75 -2y

Which implies:

76 - y <75 -2y

Add 2y both sides:

76 + y <75

So, y < -1

Which is consistent with the case.

So, this case is possible.

Therefore, Case 1 is feasible.

Case 2:

1. x - y >0 => x > y

2. 76 -x - y >0 =>x + y <76

3. 1 + x >0 =>x > -1

4. x + 2y -75 >0 =>x +2y >75

So, in this case:

x > y

x + y <76

x > -1

x + 2y >75

Again, let's see if these can coexist.

From x + y <76 and x +2y >75.

Subtract x + y from both sides:

(x +2y) - (x + y) >75 -76

Which is y > -1

So, y > -1

But in this case, we have x > y, x > -1, and y > -1.

So, y > -1, x > y, and x + y <76, and x +2y >75.

Let me see:

From x +2y >75 and y > -1, so:

x >75 -2y

But y > -1, so 2y > -2

Thus, 75 -2y <75 +2 =77

So, x >75 -2y, but x > y.

So, x has to be greater than the maximum of y and 75 -2y.

Similarly, x + y <76 =>x <76 -y

So, 75 -2y <x <76 - y

So, 75 -2y <76 - y

Which implies:

75 -2y <76 - y

Subtract 75:

-2y <1 - y

Add 2y:

0 <1 + y

So, y > -1

Which is consistent.

So, for y > -1, x is between 75 -2y and76 - y.

So, this is feasible.

Therefore, Case 2 is possible.

Case 3:

1. x - y <0 =>x < y

2.76 -x - y <0 =>x + y >76

3.1 +x >0 =>x > -1

4. x + 2y -75 <0 =>x +2y <75

So, in this case:

x < y

x + y >76

x > -1

x +2y <75

Let me see if these can coexist.

From x + y >76 and x +2y <75.

Subtract the first inequality from the second:

(x +2y) - (x + y) <75 -76

Which is y < -1

So, y < -1.

But in this case, x < y, x > -1, and y < -1.

So, x > -1, y < -1, and x < y.

So, x is between -1 and y, which is less than -1.

But x > -1 and x < y < -1, so x must be between -1 and y, but y < -1, so x must be less than y < -1, but x > -1.

So, x > -1 and x < y < -1, which is impossible because x cannot be both greater than -1 and less than y, which is also less than -1.

Therefore, Case 3 is impossible.

Case 4:

1. x - y <0 =>x < y

2.76 -x - y >0 =>x + y <76

3.1 +x <0 =>x < -1

4. x +2y -75 >0 =>x +2y >75

So, in this case:

x < y

x + y <76

x < -1

x +2y >75

So, let's see if these can coexist.

From x < -1 and x +2y >75.

So, x +2y >75, with x < -1.

So, 2y >75 -x

But x < -1, so 75 -x >75 +1=76.

Thus, 2y >76 => y >38.

But in this case, x < y, and x < -1, so y must be greater than x, which is less than -1, but y >38.

But x < -1 and y >38, so x < -1 < y, but then x + y <76.

But if y >38 and x < -1, then x + y can be less than 76.

For example, x = -2, y =39: x + y =37 <76.

Wait, but 2y >75 -x

If x = -2, then 2y >75 - (-2)=77 => y >38.5

So, y >38.5.

So, x < -1, y >38.5, x < y.

So, x + y <76.

So, x + y <76, x < -1, y >38.5, x < y.

Let me see:

If x < -1 and y >38.5, then x + y <76.

So, x < -1, y >38.5, x + y <76.

So, x < -1, y >38.5, and x + y <76.

So, for example, x = -2, y =38.6: x + y =36.6 <76.

Alternatively, y =38.5, then x +38.5 <76 =>x <37.5, but x < -1.

So, y >38.5, x < -1, and x + y <76.

This is possible.

So, Case 4 is possible.

Therefore, out of the four cases, Cases 1, 2, and 4 are possible, while Case 3 is impossible.

Therefore, we have three regions on the plane: Cases 1, 2, and 4.

But the problem statement says that these regions are three disjoint convex regions. So, each of these cases corresponds to a convex region.

So, perhaps Cases 1, 2, and 4 correspond to the three convex regions.

But in our earlier analysis, Case 1 and Case 2 and Case 4 are all possible.

But in the problem statement, it says only one of them has finite area.

So, let's analyze each case.

First, let's consider each case as a region on the plane x + y + z =75, and compute their areas.

But since it's a plane in 3D, the area is computed as the 2D area in the plane.

But perhaps we can parameterize the plane and compute the area accordingly.

Alternatively, we can compute the area in terms of the coordinate system on the plane.

But maybe it's easier to use transformation.

Wait, another approach is to realize that the inequalities define regions on the plane, which can be unbounded or bounded.

But since the plane is affine, any convex region on it is either bounded or unbounded.

But in the problem, exactly one region has finite area.

So, perhaps two of them are unbounded, and one is bounded.

So, our task is to find the bounded region and compute its area.

So, let's consider the three cases:

Case 1: (x - y)(76 -x - y) <0, (1 + x)(x +2y -75) <0

Case 2: (x - y)(76 -x - y) <0, (1 + x)(x +2y -75) <0

Wait, no, correction.

Wait, in Cases 1, 2, and 4, each case corresponds to a different combination.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink.

Wait, actually, in the previous analysis, Cases 1, 2, and 4 correspond to different regions.

But in the plane, we can have different regions based on the inequalities.

But perhaps it's better to move to another approach.

Wait, let's go back to the original inequalities:

x - yz < y - zx < z - xy

So, these can be written as:

x - yz < y - zx  --> (1 + z)(x - y) <0

and

y - zx < z - xy  --> (1 + x)(y - z) <0

So, if we denote these as:

(1 + z)(x - y) <0

(1 + x)(y - z) <0

So, let me think in terms of variables.

Let me assume that in a region, (1 + z) >0 and (1 +x) >0.

Then, from the first inequality, x < y

From the second inequality, y > z

So, x < y > z

Which gives x < y and y > z, but doesn't specify x and z.

Wait, but if x < y and y > z, then x and z can be anything.

But given that x + y + z =75, their sum is fixed.

Wait, but perhaps we can define variables in terms of two parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider using barycentric coordinates on the plane, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use substitution.

Let me consider variables u = x - y, v = y - z, w = z - x.

But not sure.

Wait, another approach: consider the three inequalities:

x < yz + z(x - y) ?

Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, let's think of the inequalities as:

x - yz < y - zx --> x - y < yz - zx --> (x - y) < z(y -x ) --> (x - y) < -z(x - y )

So, (x - y)(1 + z) <0

Which is what we had before.

Similarly, y - zx < z - xy --> y - z < zx - xy --> (y - z) <x(z - y) --> (y - z) < -x(y - z )

So, (y - z)(1 +x ) <0

So, again, same as before.

So, maybe I can consider the regions where:

1. (1 + z)(x - y ) <0

2. (1 +x )(y - z ) <0

So, for each inequality, the product is negative.

So, (1 + z)(x - y ) <0 means that either 1 + z >0 and x - y <0, or 1 + z <0 and x - y >0.

Similarly, (1 +x )(y - z ) <0 means either 1 +x >0 and y - z <0, or 1 +x <0 and y - z >0.

So, for each inequality, we have two possibilities.

So, the combination of these leads to four possible cases.

1. 1 + z >0 and x - y <0

   AND

   1 +x >0 and y - z <0

2. 1 + z >0 and x - y <0

   AND

   1 +x <0 and y - z >0

3. 1 + z <0 and x - y >0

   AND

   1 +x >0 and y - z <0

4. 1 + z <0 and x - y >0

   AND

   1 +x <0 and y - z >0

So, these are four cases.

Now, let's analyze each case.

Case 1:

1 + z >0 and x - y <0

AND

1 +x >0 and y - z <0

So, in this case:

From 1 + z >0, so z >-1

From x - y <0, so x < y

From 1 +x >0, so x > -1

From y - z <0, so y < z

So, putting together:

z >-1

x > -1

x < y

y < z

So, ordering is x < y < z

But x + y + z =75

So, x < y < z and x + y + z =75

So, all three variables are greater than -1, but x < y < z.

But as before, x < y < z, all greater than -1, but since x + y + z =75, which is positive, this could be a feasible region.

Case 2:

1 + z >0 and x - y <0

AND

1 +x <0 and y - z >0

So, from 1 + z >0, z >-1

From x - y <0, x < y

From 1 +x <0, x < -1

From y - z >0, y > z

So, we have:

z >-1

x < -1

x < y

y > z

So, ordering is x < -1 < y > z

But z >-1, so x < -1 < z < y

Wait, but z >-1, and y > z, so y > z >-1

But x < -1, so x < -1 < z < y

But in this case, the variables are ordered as x < -1 < z < y.

But let's check if this is feasible with x + y + z =75.

So, x < -1, z >-1, y > z.

So, x is less than -1, y is greater than z, which is greater than -1.

So, x is negative, y and z are positive.

But let's see, can x + y + z =75?

Yes, because y and z are positive enough to compensate for x being negative.

But the problem is, whether this region is bounded or not.

But in any case, let's proceed.

Case 3:

1 + z <0 and x - y >0

AND

1 +x >0 and y - z <0

So, 1 + z <0 implies z < -1

From x - y >0, x > y

From 1 +x >0, x > -1

From y - z <0, y < z

So, putting together:

z < -1

x > -1

x > y

y < z

So, ordering is x > y > z, with z < -1, x > -1.

So, z < -1, y < z < x < y, which is impossible because x > y and y > z, so z < y <x.

But z < -1, y < z <x, but y < z <x, so y < z, but z < -1, so y < z <x, but x > -1.

So, is this feasible?

Well, for example, z = -2, y = -1.5, x =0.

Then, x + y + z =0 -1.5 -2 = -3.5, which is not 75.

But we need x + y + z =75.

So, if x is positive and large enough, and y and z are just slightly less than x, but z < -1.

But then, x + y + z =75 requires that x is very large, and y + z is fixed at 75 -x.

But given that y < z <x, and z < -1, then y < z <x.

So, y and z are both less than x, with z < -1, y < z.

So, x is greater than y and z, but z is less than -1.

Therefore, x must be greater than y and z, but since y and z are less than x, but z is also less than -1, the sum x + y + z would be x + (something less than z) + (something less than z). So, unless x is extremely large, the sum would not be 75.

Wait, but in this case, x must be greater than y and z, but z is less than -1, so y < z <x, x > -1.

But x + y + z =75, so x must be 75 - y - z.

Given that y and z are less than x, but z is less than -1.

Wait, if y < z <x, then y and z are both less than x, so x + y + z <x +x +x =3x.

But 75 <3x => x >25.

But z is less than -1, so z can be as low as it wants, but y is less than z, so y is also less than z.

But if y and z are both less than x, but x is greater than 25, then the sum x + y + z could be 75.

But let me think of specific numbers.

Suppose x =100, then y + z =75 -100= -25.

But y < z <x, with z < -1.

So, y < z < -1, and y + z = -25.

So, possible.

For example, y = -13, z = -12, but y < z <x.

Wait, y = -13 < z =-12 <x=100.

So, x + y + z=100-13-12=75.

So, that's a valid example.

So, it's possible.

Therefore, Case 3 is feasible.

Case 4:

1 + z <0 and x - y >0

AND

1 +x <0 and y - z >0

So, 1 + z <0 => z < -1

x - y >0 =>x > y

1 +x <0 =>x < -1

y - z >0 =>y > z

So, putting together:

z < -1

x < -1

x > y

y > z

So, ordering is x > y > z, with z < -1, x < -1.

So, in this case, z < -1, y > z, x > y, but x < -1.

So, ordering is z < y <x <0

Wait, but x is less than -1, so x is negative, y is greater than z, which is less than -1, so y is also negative.

But x is less than y, so x is the smallest, then y, then z, but z is less than y.

So, wait: z < y <x <0

But x < -1, y > z, but y <x <0.

So, for example, z =-3, y =-2, x =-1.5.

But then x + y + z =-1.5 -2 -3=-6.5≠75.

But we need x + y + z=75.

So, x is negative, y and z are also negative, but their sum is positive.

But x is negative, y and z are negative.

So, sum of three negative numbers is 75? That's impossible because 75 is positive.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, if z < -1, y > z, x > y, but x < -1.

So, z < y <x < -1

So, all three variables are negative.

But x + y + z =75, which is positive. So, the sum of three negative numbers cannot be positive. Therefore, this case is impossible.

Therefore, Case 4 is impossible.

Therefore, only Cases 1, 2, and 3 are possible.

So, in summary:

Case 1: x < y < z, with z >-1, x > -1, and x + y + z=75.

Case 2: x < -1, z >-1, y > z, and x + y + z=75.

Case 3: z < -1, y < z <x, with x > -1, and x + y + z=75.

So, three regions.

Now, the problem states that all three regions are convex, but only one has finite area.

So, let's see.

First, in Case 1: x < y < z.

Since the plane is infinite, this region extends infinitely in the direction where x, y, z increase.

So, it's an unbounded region.

Similarly, in Case 3: z < -1, y < z <x, with x > -1.

Wait, no, in Case 3, z < -1, y < z, but x > -1.

So, x is greater than y and z, but z is less than -1, x is greater than -1.

So, x is between -1 and something, y and z are less than x.

But the sum x + y + z=75, so x must be positive enough to compensate for y and z being negative.

So, this is also an unbounded region, because x can be increased indefinitely, and y and z adjusted accordingly.

But wait, in Case 2: x < -1, z >-1, y > z, and x + y + z=75.

Here, x is negative, z is greater than -1, y is greater than z.

So, x is less than -1, y and z are greater than -1, and their sum is 75.

So, in this case, x is negative, but can be as negative as possible, but y and z can compensate by being sufficiently large.

But as x becomes more negative, y and z must become larger to keep the sum at 75.

So, this is also an unbounded region.

But in Case 1, as x, y, z increase, they can go to infinity, so it's unbounded.

In Case 3, similar to Case 1, but with x bounded below by -1, but y and z can go to negative infinity as x is increased.

Wait, but no, in Case 3, z is bounded above by y, which is bounded above by x, which is greater than -1.

So, in Case 3, x is greater than -1, but can be as large as possible, with y and z being less than x.

But since x can go to infinity, y and z can go to infinity as well, keeping x + y + z=75.

Wait, but if x increases, then y and z must decrease to compensate.

Wait, no, in Case 3, z < -1, y < z <x, with x > -1, and x + y + z=75.

So, if x increases, y and z can be adjusted such that y + z=75 -x.

So, as x increases, y + z decreases, but y and z are constrained by y < z <x.

So, in this case, as x approaches infinity, y + z approaches negative infinity.

But since y < z <x, and x is approaching infinity, y and z can be arranged such that y and z can go to negative infinity, but their sum is 75 -x, which is negative infinity.

So, this region is also unbounded.

Wait, so all three regions are unbounded? But the problem statement says that exactly one region has finite area.

So, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps some of these regions are bounded.

Wait, let's think again.

In Case 1: x < y < z, z >-1, x > -1.

So, x + y + z=75.

This is a region in the plane where x, y, z are ordered, with x, y, z all greater than -1.

But since x + y + z=75, which is a positive number, and x, y, z are all greater than -1, but it's not necessarily bounded.

Wait, in 3D space, the plane x + y + z=75 intersects all octants, but in this case, we are restricted to x < y < z.

So, in the positive octant, but with x < y < z.

So, this is a region that extends infinitely in the direction where x, y, z increase, but as x increases, y and z must also increase to satisfy x < y < z.

But since x + y + z=75, which is fixed, if x increases, y and z must decrease.

Wait, no, if x increases, but y and z are required to be greater than x, so they must also increase.

Wait, but x + y + z=75, so if x increases, y and z have to decrease more to compensate.

But y and z must be greater than x.

So, if x is very large, say x=100, then y and z must be greater than 100, but x + y + z=75.

But 100 + y + z=75 => y + z= -25, but y and z must be greater than 100, which is impossible.

Therefore, x cannot be arbitrarily large.

Wait, perhaps x can't exceed 25.

Wait, let me see.

Suppose x=25, then y + z=50.

But since y >x=25 and z > y, so z >25, y >25.

So, y and z must each be greater than 25, so y + z >50.

But x + y + z=75.

So, 25 +50=75, so equality.

So, when x=25, y=25, z=25.

But in this case, x=y=z=25.

But in Case 1, x < y < z, so y must be greater than x, which is 25.

So, in reality, x cannot exceed 25.

Wait, but if x approaches 25 from below, y and z approach 25 from above.

So, x can be up to 25, but y and z must be greater than x.

Therefore, the region is bounded in x, y, z.

Wait, so perhaps Case 1 is bounded.

Wait, let me think.

If x < y < z, and x + y + z=75, with x, y, z >-1.

But even with these constraints, does the region extend to infinity?

Wait, if x is approaching negative infinity, but x must be greater than -1, so x is bounded below by -1.

Therefore, x is between -1 and 25, as when x=25, y and z=25.

But actually, when x approaches 25, y and z must approach 25, but in Case 1, x < y < z, so y must be greater than x, which is approaching 25.

But x cannot exceed 25 because x + y + z=75, and y and z must be greater than x.

Therefore, x is bounded above by 25.

Similarly, y is bounded above by something?

Wait, if x is bounded above by 25, and y >x, then y can be up to 50, but if y approaches 50, then z=75 -x - y approaches 75 -25 -50=0.

But z must be greater than y, so z must be greater than y, so 75 -x - y > y =>75 -x >2y.

But since x >= -1, 75 -x <=76.

So, 76 >2y => y <38.

But if x approaches 25, y must approach less than 38.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

But perhaps I need to find the bounds of the regions.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can compute the intersection points of the inequalities.

But since it's on a plane, I can parameterize the plane.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use barycentric coordinates.

Wait, maybe an easier way is to realize that the problem is symmetric in some way.

But given the time I've spent, maybe I should instead try to visualize the regions.

Wait, in Case 1, x < y < z, all greater than -1, and x + y + z=75.

This is a region bounded by the plane x + y + z=75 and the inequalities x < y < z.

This is a convex region, but is it bounded?

Wait, in three dimensions, the intersection of the plane with the ordering x < y < z would create a convex region, but whether it's bounded depends on the constraints.

But given that x, y, z are all greater than -1, and x + y + z=75, which is a large positive number, the region is bounded.

Wait, why?

Because, for instance, if x is approaching negative infinity, but x must be greater than -1, so x is bounded below.

But then, if x is bounded below, and y and z are greater than x, so y and z are at least approaching x's lower bound.

But x + y + z=75, so even if x approaches -1, y and z must be approaching (75 - (-1))/2=76/2=38.

So, x is bounded below by -1, and y and z are bounded above by 38.

Similarly, for x approaching 25, y approaching 25, z approaching 25.

So, perhaps the region is a triangle or a simplex.

Wait, actually, in three dimensions, the intersection of a plane with the ordering x < y < z is a convex region bounded by the plane and the ordering hyperplanes.

But is it bounded?

Wait, in 3D, the region x < y < z on the plane x + y + z=75 is actually unbounded because you can go infinitely in the direction where x, y, z increase, but given that x + y + z is fixed at 75, it's actually bounded.

Wait, no, because on the plane x + y + z=75, the region x < y < z is bounded by the intersection with the ordering hyperplanes.

But in reality, in the plane x + y + z=75, it's a 2D plane, so the intersection with the inequalities x < y, y < z, etc., would create bounded or unbounded regions.

Wait, actually, in the plane, the set of points where x < y < z is a convex region, but it's a single convex cone extending to infinity.

Wait, but with the additional constraint that x + y + z=75, which is a fixed value.

So, in the plane, the region where x < y < z and x + y + z=75 is a triangle.

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, because if we fix x + y + z=75, and x < y < z, then the minimal case is when x approaches -1, y approaches 38, z approaches 38, but with x < y < z.

But actually, x can go up to 25, with y and z approaching 25 from above.

So, the region is bounded.

Wait, so in the plane x + y + z=75, the region where x < y < z is a triangle with vertices at (25,25,25), (-1, 38, 36), and (-1, 36, 38).

Wait, maybe not exactly, but it's a bounded region.

Wait, actually, when x approaches -1, y and z must satisfy y + z=76, with y < z.

So, the minimal x is -1, with y approaching 38 from below, z approaching 38 from above.

So, the region is bounded by x=-1, y= z, and x + y + z=75.

Similarly, it's a triangle.

Wait, maybe.

Wait, actually, in the plane x + y + z=75, the intersection with x < y < z is a triangle with vertices at (25,25,25), (-1,38,36), and (-1,36,38).

But I need to confirm.

Wait, when x=25, y and z must be 25 as well because x < y < z is not possible with x=25 unless y and z are greater, but x + y + z=75.

Wait, if x=25, then y + z=50. But y and z must each be greater than 25, so y >25 and z > y.

But y + z=50, so minimum y is 25, but y must be greater than 25, so y approaches 25 from above, and z approaches 25 from above as well, but z must be greater than y.

Wait, so the point (25,25,25) is actually on the boundary of the region x < y < z.

Similarly, when x approaches -1, y and z approach 38 and 36, or 36 and 38.

So, the vertices are (25,25,25), (-1,38,36), and (-1,36,38).

So, in this case, the region is a triangle.

Similarly, in Case 2 and Case 3, perhaps these are triangles as well.

But in the plane, the intersection of a plane with a set of inequalities can form a polygon.

So, for Case 1, the region x < y < z on the plane x + y + z=75 is a triangle with vertices at (25,25,25), (-1,38,36), and (-1,36,38).

So, that's a bounded region.

Similarly, for Cases 2 and 3, perhaps they're also triangles.

But then, the problem states that only one of these regions has finite area.

So, in Case 1, the region is a triangle, which is bounded, so it has finite area.

In Cases 2 and 3, the regions are also bounded?

Wait, in Case 2, x < -1, z >-1, y > z, x + y + z=75.

So, in this case, x is less than -1, and y and z are greater than -1.

But x + y + z=75, so y + z=75 -x.

Since x < -1, y + z=75 -x >76.

So, y + z >76, with y > z >-1.

So, y and z can be arranged as y > z >-1, and y + z >76.

But y and z are real numbers, so y can be as large as needed, but z is bounded below by -1.

So, if x is approaching negative infinity, y and z must approach positive infinity to compensate.

Wait, but x is constrained by x < -1, but can x be arbitrarily large negative?

Wait, if x approaches negative infinity, then y + z=75 -x approaches positive infinity, but y and z must satisfy y > z >-1.

So, y can be arranged as y=75 -x - z, with z >-1, but y > z.

So, as x approaches negative infinity, y and z can approach positive infinity, keeping y > z.

Thus, the region in Case 2 is unbounded.

Similarly, in Case 3, z < -1, y < z <x, with x + y + z=75.

Here, x is greater than y and z, but z < -1, so x must be greater than y, which is greater than z, which is less than -1.

So, x is greater than y > z < -1.

So, x must be greater than y, which is greater than z, which is less than -1.

But x + y + z=75, so x must be very large to compensate for y and z being negative.

So, as z approaches negative infinity, y approaches negative infinity as well, but x must approach positive infinity to keep the sum at 75.

So, this region is also unbounded.

Therefore, only Case 1 is bounded, so it's the only region with finite area.

Therefore, the region with finite area is Case 1, which is a triangle with vertices at (25,25,25), (-1,38,36), (-1,36,38).

So, to compute the area of this triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle in 3D space.

First, let's find the coordinates of the three points:

Point A: (25,25,25)

Point B: (-1,38,36)

Point C: (-1,36,38)

So, the vectors AB and AC can be computed as:

Vector AB = B - A = (-1 -25, 38 -25, 36 -25) = (-26,13,11)

Vector AC = C - A = (-1 -25, 36 -25, 38 -25) = (-26,11,13)

Then, the area of the triangle is half the magnitude of the cross product of AB and AC.

Compute the cross product AB × AC.

First, let me write AB and AC.

AB = (-26,13,11)

AC = (-26,11,13)

Compute cross product:

|i     j     k|
|-26   13    11|
|-26   11    13|

= i*(13*13 -11*11) - j*(-26*13 - (-26)*11) + k*(-26*11 - (-26)*13)

Compute each component:

i: 13*13 -11*11=169 -121=48

j: - [ (-26)*13 - (-26)*11 ]= - [ -338 +286 ]= - [ -52 ]=52

k: (-26)*11 - (-26)*13= -286 +338=52

So, the cross product AB × AC= (48,52,52)

Now, compute the magnitude:

|AB × AC|= sqrt(48² +52² +52²)

Compute each square:

48²=2304

52²=2704

So, 2304 +2704 +2704=2304 +5408=7712

So, sqrt(7712)

Simplify sqrt(7712):

Divide by 16: 7712 /16=482

So, sqrt(7712)=4*sqrt(482)

Check if 482 can be simplified:

482=2*241, and 241 is a prime number.

So, sqrt(7712)=4*sqrt(482)

Therefore, the area is (1/2)*4*sqrt(482)=2*sqrt(482)

But wait, let me double-check the cross product calculation.

Wait, in the cross product:

i:13*13 -11*11=169 -121=48

j: - [ (-26)*13 - (-26)*11 ]= - [ (-338) - (-286) ]= - [ (-338 +286) ]= - [ (-52) ]=52

k: (-26)*11 - (-26)*13= -286 +338=52

Yes, correct.

So, cross product is (48,52,52)

So, magnitude is sqrt(48² +52² +52²)=sqrt(2304 +2704 +2704)=sqrt(2304 +5408)=sqrt(7712)

7712 divided by 16 is 482, which is correct.

So, sqrt(7712)=4*sqrt(482)

Therefore, area is 2*sqrt(482)

But wait, 482=2*241, which is prime. So, it's simplified as 2√482.

But wait, let me compute 482.

241 is a prime number, yes.

So, the area is 2√482.

But wait, let me confirm the cross product again.

Wait, vector AB is (-26,13,11)

Vector AC is (-26,11,13)

So, cross product:

i*(13*13 -11*11)=i*(169 -121)=i*48

j component: - [ (-26)*13 - (-26)*11 ]= - [ (-338) - (-286) ]= - [ (-52) ]=52

k component: (-26)*11 - (-26)*13= -286 +338=52

Yes, correct.

Therefore, cross product is (48,52,52)

So, magnitude is sqrt(48² +52² +52²)=sqrt(2304 +2704 +2704)=sqrt(7712)=4*sqrt(482)

Therefore, area is half that, so 2*sqrt(482)

So, area is 2√482, so a=2, b=482

So, a + b=2 +482=484

But before finalizing, let me make sure that the triangle is indeed with these vertices.

Wait, the three points are:

A: (25,25,25)

B: (-1,38,36)

C: (-1,36,38)

So, the triangle is formed by these three points.

But wait, is this triangle planar?

Yes, because all three points lie on the plane x + y + z=75.

So, the area is correctly computed.

But just to make sure, maybe I can compute the side lengths and check if it's a right triangle or something.

Compute distance AB:

A(25,25,25), B(-1,38,36)

Distance AB: sqrt[ (-26)^2 +13^2 +11^2 ]=sqrt[676 +169 +121]=sqrt[966]

Similarly, distance AC: sqrt[(-26)^2 +11^2 +13^2]=sqrt[676 +121 +169]=sqrt[966]

Distance BC: sqrt[0^2 + (2)^2 + (-2)^2 ]=sqrt[0 +4 +4]=sqrt[8]

So, sides are sqrt(966), sqrt(966), sqrt(8)

So, it's an isoceles triangle with two sides sqrt(966) and base sqrt(8)

So, the area can also be calculated as (base * height)/2.

Take base as sqrt(8)=2*sqrt(2)

To find height, we can use Pythagoras.

Each of the equal sides is sqrt(966), half of the base is sqrt(2).

So, height h satisfies:

h^2 + (sqrt(2))^2 = (sqrt(966))^2

h^2 +2=966

h^2=964

h= sqrt(964)=2*sqrt(241)

Therefore, area is (2*sqrt(2)*2*sqrt(241))/2= (4*sqrt(482))/2=2*sqrt(482)

Which matches the previous result.

Therefore, the area is indeed 2*sqrt(482), so a=2, b=482, so a + b=484.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{484}
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given conditions on the points in the plane \(3x + y = 75\). We need to find the regions where the inequalities \(x - yz < y - zx < z - xy\) hold. 

First, we rewrite the inequalities:
1. \(x - yz < y - zx\) simplifies to \((x - y)(1 + z) < 0\).
2. \(y - zx < z - xy\) simplifies to \((y - z)(1 + x) < 0\).

We analyze the sign conditions for these inequalities:
- For \((x - y)(1 + z) < 0\), either \(x > y\) and \(1 + z < 0\) or \(x < y\) and \(1 + z > 0\).
- For \((y - z)(1 + x) < 0\), either \(y > z\) and \(1 + x < 0\) or \(y < z\) and \(1 + x > 0\).

We then consider the possible cases for the signs of \(1 + z\) and \(1 + x\). After analyzing the cases, we find that the regions are bounded by the plane \(3x + y = 75\) and the inequalities on \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).

We determine that the region with finite area is the triangle formed by the points \((25, 25, 25)\), \((-1, 38, 36)\), and \((-1, 36, 38)\). 

To find the area of this triangle, we compute the cross product of vectors formed by these points and find the magnitude. The area is calculated to be \(2\sqrt{482}\).

Thus, the area is expressed as \(a\sqrt{b}\) where \(a = 2\) and \(b = 482\). Therefore, \(a + b = 2 + 482 = 484\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{484}
\]
